 The following is a conversation with Ryan Schiller, creator of Librex, an anonymous discussion

00:06.080 --> 00:11.840
 feed for college communities starting at first with Yale, then the Ivy Leagues, and now adding

00:11.840 --> 00:18.640
 Stanford and MIT. Their mission is to give students a place to explore ideas and issues

00:18.640 --> 00:24.880
 in a positive way, but with much more personal and intellectual freedom than has defined college

00:24.880 --> 00:31.520
 campuses in recent history. I think this is a very difficult but worthy project. Quick thank you

00:31.520 --> 00:38.720
 to our sponsors. All form, magic spoon, better help, and brave. Click their links to support this

00:38.720 --> 00:45.920
 podcast. As a side note, let me say that Ryan is a young entrepreneur and genuine human being

00:45.920 --> 00:52.160
 who quickly won me over. He's inspiring in many ways, both in the struggle he had to overcome in

00:52.160 --> 00:58.800
 his personal life, but also in the fact that he did not know how to code, but saw a problem in this

00:58.800 --> 01:05.600
 world in his community that he cared about. And for that, he learned to code and built the solution

01:05.600 --> 01:11.840
 in the best way he knew how. That's an important reminder for us humans. Let us not only complain

01:11.840 --> 01:18.160
 about the problems in the world. Let us fix them. I also have to say that there's passion in Ryan's

01:18.160 --> 01:24.160
 eyes for really wanting to make a difference in the world. His story, his effort gives me hope

01:24.160 --> 01:30.400
 for the future. There is hate in this world, but I believe there's much more love. And I believe

01:30.400 --> 01:36.880
 it's possible to build online platforms that connect us through our common humanity as we explore

01:36.880 --> 01:45.040
 difficult, personal, even painful ideas together. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. And here is

01:45.040 --> 01:52.880
 my conversation with Ryan Schiller. Let's start with the basics. What is Librex? What are its

01:52.880 --> 01:58.240
 founding story and founding principles? And looking to the future, what do you hope to achieve with

01:58.240 --> 02:04.800
 Librex? Sure, let me break that down. So what is Librex? Librex is an anonymous discussion feed

02:04.800 --> 02:10.800
 for college campuses. It's a place where people can have important and unfettered discussions and

02:10.800 --> 02:15.600
 open discourse about topics they care about, ideas that matter. And they can do all of that

02:15.600 --> 02:22.560
 completely anonymously with verified members of their college community. And we exist both on

02:23.120 --> 02:29.200
 each Ivy League campus and we have an inter Ivy community. And actually this week we just opened

02:29.200 --> 02:34.880
 to MIT and Stanford. So now we have... No, really? MIT? Yes. So we have MIT and Stanford

02:34.880 --> 02:41.040
 Communities and I expect you to sign up for your MIT account and start posting. What are... For

02:41.040 --> 02:47.200
 people who are not familiar like me, actually, which are the Ivy Leagues? Sure. So we started at

02:47.200 --> 02:52.640
 Yale, which is my... I don't know, can you call it alma mater? Because I haven't technically graduated.

02:52.640 --> 02:58.960
 Yeah. What's that called when you're actually still there? My university. Yeah, I guess home.

02:58.960 --> 03:04.160
 Call it home. That's my home. Educational home. Started my educational home of Yale. And then

03:04.160 --> 03:09.360
 we moved to... And we could get into the story of this eventually if you'd like. And then we went

03:09.360 --> 03:16.400
 to Dartmouth and then quarantine hit. We opened to the rest of the Ivy League and now we have...

03:16.400 --> 03:22.480
 And the Ivy League for those who don't know is Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia,

03:22.480 --> 03:28.960
 Cornell, Brown and Penn. I got it all in one breath. What's the youngest Ivy League, Penn?

03:28.960 --> 03:36.000
 No, Columbia. I can't say that on camera. We'll edit it in post. I don't know. I'll just say each

03:36.000 --> 03:42.160
 of all eight of them and then you can just like get it in like Penn, Harvard. There's actually

03:42.160 --> 03:47.280
 a really nice software that people should check out like a service. It's using machine learning

03:47.280 --> 03:55.920
 really nicely for podcast editing where you can... It learns the voice of the speaker and it can

03:55.920 --> 04:00.800
 change the words you said. It's like some deep fake stuff. It's deep fake, but for positive

04:00.800 --> 04:04.800
 applications. It's very interesting. It's like the only deep fake positive application I see.

04:04.800 --> 04:09.600
 I have a friend who's obsessed with deep fakes. What's great about I think deep fakes is that

04:09.600 --> 04:13.760
 it's going to do the opposite of sort of what's happening with our culture where everyone will

04:13.760 --> 04:20.800
 have plausible deniability. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's the hope for me is there's so many fake

04:20.800 --> 04:28.000
 things out there that we're going to actually be much more skeptical and think and take in

04:28.000 --> 04:34.240
 multiple sources and actually like reason, like use common sense and use my deep thinking to

04:34.240 --> 04:40.240
 understand like what is true and what is not. Because we used to have like traditional sources

04:40.240 --> 04:45.040
 like the New York Times and all these kinds of publications that had a reputation. There are

04:45.040 --> 04:50.400
 these institutions and they're the source of truth. When you no longer can trust anything as a source

04:50.400 --> 04:54.800
 of truth, you start to think on your own and it gets part of the individual. That goes,

04:54.800 --> 04:59.120
 that takes us way back to like where I came from the Soviet Union where you can't really trust

04:59.120 --> 05:03.760
 any one source of news. You have to think on your own. You have to talk to your friends.

05:03.760 --> 05:09.200
 Tremendous amount of intellectual autonomy. Don't you think? Think about the societal consequences.

05:09.200 --> 05:15.440
 Absolutely. I mean, we see so much decentralization in all aspects of our digital lives now, but

05:15.440 --> 05:23.920
 this is like the decentralization of thought. You could say it's sadly, or I don't think it's

05:23.920 --> 05:30.400
 sad, is decentralization of truth where like truth is a clustering thing. We have these like

05:30.400 --> 05:36.640
 this point cloud of people just swimming around like billions of them and they all have certain

05:36.640 --> 05:42.880
 ideas and what's thought of as truth is almost like a clustering algorithm when you just get a

05:42.880 --> 05:47.840
 bunch of people that believe the same thing, that's truth. But there's also another truth

05:47.840 --> 05:53.920
 and there may be like multiple truths and it's almost would be like a battle of truths. Maybe

05:53.920 --> 06:01.040
 even the idea of truth will like lessen its power in society that there is such a thing as a truth

06:01.040 --> 06:08.640
 because like the downside of saying something is true is it owns the downside of what people like

06:08.640 --> 06:14.400
 religious people call scientism, which is like once science has declared something is true,

06:15.040 --> 06:21.440
 you can't no longer question it. But the reality is science is a moving mechanism. You're constantly

06:21.440 --> 06:32.560
 questioning and maybe truth should be renamed as a process, not a final destination. The whole

06:32.560 --> 06:37.680
 point is to keep questioning, keep questioning, keep discovering. Kind of like we're going backwards

06:37.680 --> 06:45.200
 in time. So like back when people were sort of finding their identities and we were less

06:45.200 --> 06:50.240
 globalized, right? Like people would get together and they'd get together around common value system,

06:50.240 --> 06:55.680
 common morals and a common place and those would be sort of these clusters of their truth, right?

06:55.680 --> 07:00.880
 And so we have all these different civilizations and societies across the world that created

07:00.880 --> 07:05.520
 their own truths. We talk about the Jews and the Talmud and Torah. We look at Buddhist texts,

07:05.520 --> 07:10.560
 we can look at all sorts of different truths and how many of them get at the same things,

07:10.560 --> 07:14.240
 but many of them have different ideas or different articulations.

07:14.240 --> 07:19.200
 Yeah, Harari and Sapiens rewinds that even farther back until like gay men times. That's

07:19.200 --> 07:24.240
 the thing that made us human special is who can develop these clusters of ideas, hold them in

07:24.240 --> 07:28.960
 their minds through stories, pass them on to each other and they grows and grows. And finally,

07:28.960 --> 07:38.960
 we have Bitcoin, which money is another belief system that has power only because we believe in

07:38.960 --> 07:46.320
 it. And is that truth? I don't know, but it has power and it's carried in the minds of millions

07:46.320 --> 07:53.680
 and thereby has power. But back to Librex. So what's the founding story? What's the

07:53.680 --> 08:00.400
 founding principles of Librex? Sure. So I was on campus as a freshman and I was talking to my friends.

08:01.120 --> 08:06.800
 Many of them felt like it was hard to raise your hand in class to ask a question. They really felt

08:06.800 --> 08:10.560
 like even outside the classroom, it was hard to be vulnerable. And the thing you have to understand

08:10.560 --> 08:15.760
 about Yale is it's not that big a place. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows you

08:15.760 --> 08:21.920
 basically. And people come to these schools, first of all, they're home for people and they want

08:21.920 --> 08:25.440
 to be themselves. They want to feel like they can be authentic. They want to make real friendships.

08:25.440 --> 08:31.360
 And second of all, it's a place where people go for intellectual vitality to explore important

08:31.360 --> 08:38.240
 ideas and to grow as thinkers. And fortunately, due to the culture, my friends expressed that

08:38.240 --> 08:43.280
 it was very difficult to do that and I felt it too. And then I couldn't talk to my professors and

08:44.480 --> 08:48.800
 I remember I talked to one specific global affairs professor and I was taking his class and

08:48.800 --> 08:53.840
 his area of expertise was in the Middle Eastern conflict. And I went to him and I said, Professor,

08:53.840 --> 08:59.440
 we've, we're almost finished this class. And we haven't even gotten to sort of the reason I

08:59.440 --> 09:02.880
 originally wanted to take the class was to hear about your perspective on the Middle Eastern

09:02.880 --> 09:07.280
 conflict. Because something I'd learned at Yale, and this is maybe a sort of a tangent, but I'll

09:08.080 --> 09:11.760
 flush it out a bit. Something I've learned at Yale is that you can learn all sorts of things

09:11.760 --> 09:17.520
 from a textbook. And what you kind of go to Yale to do is to get like the opinions of the experts

09:17.520 --> 09:22.480
 that go beyond the textbook and to have those more in depth conversations. And so that's sort of the

09:22.480 --> 09:26.640
 added value of going to a place like Yale and taking a course there as opposed to just reading a

09:26.640 --> 09:32.400
 textbook. But also interact with that opinion. Exactly. To interact with that, with that opinion,

09:32.400 --> 09:38.240
 to hear it, to respond to it, to push back on it and to have that with some great minds. And there

09:38.240 --> 09:42.480
 really are great minds at Yale. Don't get me wrong, it's a place, it's still a place of

09:42.480 --> 09:48.000
 tremendous brilliance. So I'm talking to this professor, right? And I'm like, I haven't heard

09:48.000 --> 09:53.200
 your area of expertise. And I'm like, are we going to get to it? What's the deal? And this is

09:53.200 --> 09:58.720
 during office hours, mind you. So we're one on one. It says, Ryan, to be honest, I used to teach

09:58.720 --> 10:03.440
 this area every single year. In fact, I would do a section on it, which is like a small seminar,

10:03.440 --> 10:09.520
 like breakaway from the class where he would talk to the students in small groups and explain his

10:09.520 --> 10:15.520
 perspective, his research and have a real debate about it, like around a harkness table. And he

10:15.520 --> 10:22.560
 said, I used to do this. And then about two years ago, a student reported me to the school. And I

10:22.560 --> 10:27.920
 realized my job was at risk. And I realized the best course of action was basically just not

10:27.920 --> 10:34.320
 to broach the topic. And so now I just don't even mention it. And he's like, you can say whatever

10:34.320 --> 10:40.000
 you want, but I'm not, I'm not going to be a part of it. And it's a real shame. It's a real loss to

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
 all of the students who I think came to the school to learn from these brilliant professors.

10:46.800 --> 10:53.920
 In that context of these world experts, the problem seems to be that reporting mechanism

10:54.960 --> 11:01.360
 where there's a disproportionate power to a complaint of a young student, a complaint that an

11:01.360 --> 11:08.880
 idea is painful, or an idea is disrespectful to, you know, or ideas creating an unsafe space.

11:10.080 --> 11:15.920
 And the conclusion of that, I mean, I'm not sure what to do with that, because it's a single

11:16.480 --> 11:24.080
 reporting, maybe a couple, but that has more power than the idea itself. And that's strange. I don't

11:24.080 --> 11:30.160
 know how to fix that in the administration, except to fire everybody. So like this is to push back

11:30.160 --> 11:36.640
 against this storyline that academia is somehow fundamentally broken. I think we have to separate

11:36.640 --> 11:43.840
 a lot of things out. Like one is you have to look at faculty and you have to look at administration.

11:44.800 --> 11:54.080
 And like at MIT, for example, the administration does tries to do well, but they're the ones that

11:54.080 --> 12:00.640
 often lack courage. They're often the ones who are the source of the problem. When people criticize

12:00.640 --> 12:07.520
 academia, and I'll just speak to myself, you know, I'm willing to take heed for this, is

12:07.520 --> 12:13.600
 they really are criticizing the administration, not the faculty, because the faculty oftentimes

12:14.240 --> 12:21.680
 are the most brilliant. The bolder thinkers that you think, whenever you talk about, we need like

12:21.680 --> 12:27.120
 the truth to be spoken. The faculty are often the ones who are in the possession of the deepest

12:27.120 --> 12:32.800
 truths in their mind. And in that sense, and they also have the capacity to truly educate in the way

12:32.800 --> 12:40.560
 that you're saying. And so it's not broken, like fundamentally, but there's stuff that like needs,

12:40.560 --> 12:44.560
 that's not working that well, it needs to be fixed. You kind of took my words. That's what I

12:44.560 --> 12:48.800
 thought you were going to ask me if I think the Ivy League is broken. That's totally, that's exactly

12:48.800 --> 12:52.960
 it. So you don't think, yeah. So on the question, do you think the Ivy League is broken? Like what,

12:52.960 --> 12:57.280
 how do you think about it? The academia in general, I suppose, but Ivy League,

12:57.280 --> 13:00.880
 still I think it represents some of the best qualities of academia.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.800
 You know, what more is there to say there? I think the Ivy League is producing tremendous

13:04.800 --> 13:11.360
 thinkers to this day. I think the culture has a lot that can be improved. But I have a lot of faith

13:11.360 --> 13:15.600
 in the people who are in these institutions. I think, like you said, the administration,

13:15.600 --> 13:19.920
 and I have to be a little careful because, you know, I've been in some of these committees

13:20.640 --> 13:25.360
 and I've talked to the administration about these sorts of things. I think they have a lot of

13:25.360 --> 13:31.440
 stakeholders and unfortunately it makes it difficult for them to always serve these brilliant

13:31.440 --> 13:37.120
 faculty and the students in the way that they would probably like to. Yeah. Okay. So this is me

13:37.120 --> 13:41.280
 speaking, right? The administration, I know the people and they're oftentimes the faculty

13:41.280 --> 13:46.960
 holding positions in these committees, right? Yes. But it's in the role of, quote unquote,

13:46.960 --> 13:57.920
 service. They're trying to do well. They're trying to do good. But I think you could say

13:57.920 --> 14:06.880
 it's the mechanism is not working. But I could also say my personal opinion is they lack courage

14:06.880 --> 14:18.720
 and, one, courage and, two, grace when they walk through the fire. So courage is stepping into the

14:18.720 --> 14:28.320
 fire and grace when you walk through the fire is like maintaining that like, as opposed to being

14:28.320 --> 14:34.560
 rude and insensitive to the lived, quote unquote, experience of others or like, you know, just not

14:34.560 --> 14:39.760
 eloquent at all. Like as you step in and take the courageous step of talking and saying the

14:39.760 --> 14:44.480
 difficult thing, doing it well, like doing it skillfully. So both of those are important,

14:44.480 --> 14:49.600
 the courage and the skill to communicate difficult ideas. And they often lack them because they

14:49.600 --> 14:56.320
 weren't trained for it, I think. So you can blame the mechanisms that don't, that allow 19, 20 year

14:56.320 --> 15:02.160
 old students to have more power than the entire faculty. Or you could just say that the faculty

15:02.160 --> 15:08.080
 need to step up and grow some guts and skill of graceful communication. And really administration.

15:08.960 --> 15:14.560
 Well, yeah. And the administration, that's right. That's the administration. Because the faculty

15:14.560 --> 15:20.880
 are sometimes some of the most brave, outspoken people. Yes. Within the bounds of their career.

15:20.880 --> 15:31.680
 Yeah. So that takes a, that's like the founding kind of spark of a fire that led you to then say,

15:31.680 --> 15:38.160
 okay, so how can I help? Yeah. And I explored a lot. I explored a lot of options. I wrote many

15:38.160 --> 15:42.800
 articles to my friends, talked to them, and I realized it sort of needed to be a cultural change,

15:42.800 --> 15:49.600
 sort of need to be bottom up grassroots. Something I knew the energy was there because

15:50.240 --> 15:55.600
 you just look at the most recent institutional assessment from Yale. This was basically the

15:55.600 --> 16:00.800
 number one thing that students, faculty and alumni all pointed to, to the administration was

16:00.800 --> 16:05.440
 cultivating more conversations on campus and more difficult conversations on campus.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.720
 So the people on campus know it. And you look at the Gallup poll, 61% of students are

16:15.840 --> 16:20.880
 on Ivy League campuses afraid to speak their minds because of the campus culture.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.880
 The campus culture is causing a sort of freezing effect on discourse.

16:26.880 --> 16:31.600
 Can you pause on that again? So what percentage of students feel afraid to speak their mind?

16:31.600 --> 16:38.240
 61% nationally. And then you're talking about, you know, places, nothing like the Ivy League,

16:38.240 --> 16:45.360
 where I'd say I'd imagine it would be even worse because of just the way that these communities

16:45.360 --> 16:50.400
 kind of come about and the sorts of people who are attracted or are invited to these sorts of

16:50.400 --> 16:56.000
 communities. That's nationwide that college students, and it's going up that college students

16:56.000 --> 17:01.680
 are afraid to say what they believe because of their campus climate. So it's a majority.

17:01.680 --> 17:06.640
 It's not, it's not a conservative thing. It's not a liberal thing. It's a group thing. We're all

17:06.640 --> 17:11.680
 feeling it. The majority of us are feeling it. And basically just it doesn't even, you don't even

17:11.680 --> 17:18.720
 necessarily need to have anything to say. You just have a fear. That's right. So when you're like

17:18.720 --> 17:24.960
 teaching, you know, metaphors, a really powerful thing to explain, you know, and there's just a

17:24.960 --> 17:30.320
 caution that you feel that's just horrible for humor. Now comedians have the freedom to just

17:30.320 --> 17:35.760
 talk shit, which is why I really appreciate somebody who's been a friend recently, Tim Dillon,

17:35.760 --> 17:43.040
 who has, who gives zero, pardon my French, fucks about anything, which is very liberating,

17:43.040 --> 17:50.080
 very important person to just tear down the powerful. But, you know, inside the academia,

17:50.080 --> 17:55.920
 as an educator, as a teacher, as a professor, you don't have the same freedom. So that fear is felt,

17:55.920 --> 18:00.960
 I guess, by a majority of students. It's, and you were getting at something there too, which is that

18:02.640 --> 18:06.160
 if you're afraid to speak metaphorically, if you're afraid to speak imprecisely,

18:07.040 --> 18:12.000
 it can be very difficult to actually think at all and to think to the extremities of what you're

18:12.000 --> 18:16.240
 capable of, because these are the, these are the mechanisms we use when we don't have quite the

18:16.240 --> 18:21.760
 precise mathematical language to quite pinpoint what we're talking about yet. This is the beginning,

18:21.760 --> 18:26.320
 this is the creative step that leads to new knowledge. And so that really scares me is that

18:27.360 --> 18:32.000
 if I'm not allowed to sort of excavate these things, these ideas with people in the sort of messy,

18:32.000 --> 18:37.120
 sloppy way that we do as humans when we're first being creative, are we, how are we going to be

18:37.120 --> 18:41.280
 able to continue to innovate? Are we going to continue to be able to learn? That's what really

18:41.280 --> 18:45.840
 starts to scare me. So you've explored a bunch of different ideas, you've heard a bunch of different

18:45.840 --> 18:53.200
 stuff. How did Librax come about? It basically came to me that it had to be kind of a grassroots

18:53.200 --> 18:58.160
 movement and it had to be something that changed culturally. And it had to be relatively personal,

18:58.720 --> 19:03.920
 people meeting people, people finding out that, no, I'm not the only one on campus

19:03.920 --> 19:09.680
 who feels this way. I feel alone. And there are a lot of other people who feel alone. I believe

19:09.680 --> 19:17.040
 this thing, and it's not as unpopular as I thought, you know, basically creating heterodoxy of thought

19:17.040 --> 19:22.960
 and it's creating that moment where you realize that your politics are personal and that your

19:22.960 --> 19:29.360
 politics are shared by a lot of people on campus. And so I just started coding it. I didn't have

19:29.360 --> 19:35.280
 much coding experience, but I went head first in and figured how hard could it be, you know?

19:35.280 --> 19:40.640
 I mean, this is really fascinating. So I talked to a lot of software engineers, AI people. Obviously,

19:40.640 --> 19:47.840
 that's where my passion, my interests are. My focus has been throughout my life. The fascinating

19:47.840 --> 19:54.240
 thing about your story, I think it should be truly inspiring to people that want to change the world

19:54.240 --> 20:00.880
 is that you don't have a background in programming. You don't have even maybe a technical background.

20:00.880 --> 20:09.040
 So you saw a problem, you explored different ideas, and then you just decided you're going to learn

20:09.040 --> 20:18.240
 how to build an app, like without a technical background. Like you didn't try to, that's so bold.

20:18.240 --> 20:25.200
 That is so beautiful, man. Can you take me through the journey of deciding to do that, of like

20:25.200 --> 20:31.360
 learning to program without a programming background and building the app like detailed? Like what do

20:31.360 --> 20:38.000
 you actually, like how do you start? Sure. I mean, you want to buy a Mac, and you had to buy a Mac.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.360
 I'm just going to go step by step, right? I'll be as dumb as possible, because it was truly,

20:43.360 --> 20:49.520
 you know, like leading by your feet. So you need a computer for this? Oh, yeah. I had a PC at the

20:49.520 --> 20:53.920
 time, and I was Android at the time. And I realized, you know, I realized it should be like an

20:53.920 --> 20:59.520
 iOS app. And so, you know, that was a decision. But, you know, I knew kids these days, they're

20:59.520 --> 21:04.480
 always on their phone. And, you know, I wanted you to be able to say a passing thought, you know,

21:04.480 --> 21:09.040
 in class, make a passing, like you're walking around and you have a thought and you can express it,

21:09.040 --> 21:12.240
 or you're in the dining hall and you have your phone out, you can express it. So it was clear to me,

21:12.240 --> 21:18.560
 it should be an iOS app. By the way, Android is great. Definitely check out. We also are now available

21:18.560 --> 21:25.360
 on Android, but we'll get there for the Android users from MIT, Stanford, or the Ivy League. So,

21:26.160 --> 21:32.160
 back to how it happened. So I realized I needed a Mac. So went out and got a Mac. And I realized

21:32.160 --> 21:38.160
 I needed an iPhone for testing eventually. Got an iPhone. So those were the real robots to start

21:38.160 --> 21:43.760
 with. From there, I mean, there's almost too much information out there about programming. The

21:43.760 --> 21:51.520
 question is, like, where do you start and what's going to be useful to you? And I, my first thought

21:51.520 --> 21:55.200
 was I should look at some Yale classes, but it became very clear very quickly that that was not

21:55.200 --> 22:00.000
 the right place to start. That would probably be the right place to start if I wanted to get a job

22:00.000 --> 22:07.280
 at Amazon. But my goal was slightly different. And I definitely had it in mind that what I was

22:07.280 --> 22:10.960
 trying to make was I'm trying to prove out an idea. I'm not trying to make a finished product.

22:10.960 --> 22:18.560
 I'm just trying to get to the first step. Because I figured if I keep getting to the next step,

22:19.440 --> 22:23.520
 at least I won't die now, you know? Like, at least things will move forward. I'll learn new

22:23.520 --> 22:28.160
 things. Maybe I'll meet new people. I'll show a degree of seriousness about what I'm doing.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.760
 And things will come together. And that is, as you'll see, what ends up happening.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.920
 So I start with Swift, right? And I find this video from the Stanford professor that had like

22:37.920 --> 22:42.880
 a million views that was like how to make basically Swift apps like perfect. And you just like,

22:43.920 --> 22:49.440
 so you got this Mac and you went like go to Google.com and you type in load Xcode.

22:49.440 --> 22:55.840
 And then code. Yeah. And then I type in on YouTube, like Stanford, iOS, Swift, enter

22:57.120 --> 23:01.520
 first YouTube video has a million views. I'm like, it has to be good at Stanford has a million views.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.240
 I got lucky. I mean, that turned out to be a very good video.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.120
 And it's basically like introductory course to Swift.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.640
 Yeah, I mean, you say introductory, I think most of the people in that class

23:13.760 --> 23:15.680
 probably had a much better background than I did.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.640
 The software developers probably. Yeah, computer scientists.

23:18.640 --> 23:23.040
 And it was slow for me. I don't think I realized it fully at the time,

23:23.040 --> 23:26.080
 just how far behind I was from the rest of the class, because I was like, wow,

23:26.080 --> 23:31.040
 seems like people are picking this up really quickly. So it took a little longer and, you know,

23:31.040 --> 23:37.360
 a lot of time on Stack Overflow, but eventually I made a truly minimal viable product, the most

23:37.360 --> 23:43.840
 minimal. Like we're talking, you know, put text on screen, add text to screen, comment on top of

23:43.840 --> 23:50.160
 text, you know, make a post, make a response. And anyone with a Yale email can do this.

23:50.160 --> 23:56.080
 And you plug it into a certain cloud server and you verify people's accounts.

23:56.080 --> 24:03.200
 And you're off. You have to figure out how to, like the whole idea of like having an account.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.240
 So there's a permanence, like you can create an account with an email.

24:08.240 --> 24:12.240
 Verify it. Verify it. Okay. So that, that's not, you know.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.200
 And that's literally how I thought about, right? Like, so what do I need to do?

24:15.200 --> 24:17.680
 And I'm like, well, first thing I need is a login page.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.120
 Yeah. And I'm like, how to make a login page in Swift?

24:21.920 --> 24:24.560
 I mean, it's that easy. If someone, this has been done before, of course.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.840
 And then the first page that pops up was probably a pretty damn good page.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.960
 It wasn't that bad. It wasn't perfect, but like, maybe it got me 80% of the way there.

24:32.960 --> 24:37.360
 And then I came into some bugs and then, you know, I asked Stack Overflow a few questions.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.760
 And then I got a little further and then I found some more bugs. And then I'm like,

24:41.760 --> 24:43.680
 maybe this isn't the right way to do it. Maybe I should do it this way.

24:43.680 --> 24:47.440
 And yeah, I'm sure my code isn't great, but the goal isn't to make great code.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.720
 The goal wasn't to make scalable code. It was to understand,

24:50.720 --> 24:55.120
 and is this something my friends will use? Like, what is the reaction going to be if I

24:55.120 --> 24:58.240
 put it in their hands? And am I capable of making this thing?

24:58.880 --> 25:04.160
 That's awesome. And so you're focusing on the experience, like actually just really driving

25:04.160 --> 25:08.320
 towards that first step, figuring out the first step and really driving towards it.

25:08.320 --> 25:13.680
 Of course, you have to also figure out, like, the concept of like storage, like database.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.640
 You know something funny?

25:14.640 --> 25:15.280
 What's that?

25:15.280 --> 25:19.280
 I just made the database structure with no knowledge of databases whatsoever.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.800
 And I start showing it to my friends who have an experience in CS, and they're like,

25:22.800 --> 25:27.600
 use the heap. That's so interesting. You're like, why did you decide to store it in this way?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.000
 I'm like, bro, I don't even know what a heap is.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.080
 I just did it because it works. Like, I'm trying to make calls and stuff. And they're like,

25:36.080 --> 25:39.440
 yeah, they're like, the hierarchy is really like, I'm like, what?

25:39.440 --> 25:44.160
 Well, there's a deep, profound lesson in there that I don't know how much you've interacted

25:44.160 --> 25:48.800
 with computer science people since, but they tend to optimize and have these kind of discussions

25:48.800 --> 25:54.800
 and what results is over optimization. It's like worrying, is this really the right way to do it?

25:54.800 --> 25:59.760
 And then you go, as opposed to doing the first thing on Stack Overflow, you go down this like

25:59.760 --> 26:06.160
 rabbit hole of what's the actual proper way to do it. And then you're like, you wake up five years

26:06.160 --> 26:13.120
 later working on Amazon because you've never finished the login page. Like, it's kind of hilarious,

26:13.120 --> 26:20.640
 but that's a really deep lesson. Like, just get it done. And there's like, what's a heap, bro?

26:20.640 --> 26:27.200
 Is the right, that should be a t shirt. That's really the right approach to building something

26:27.200 --> 26:34.080
 that ultimately creates an experience and then you iterate eventually. That's how the great,

26:34.080 --> 26:38.720
 some of the greatest software products in this world have been built, is you create it quickly

26:38.720 --> 26:45.360
 and then just iterate. What was, by the way, in your mind, the thing that you're chasing as a

26:45.920 --> 26:52.880
 prototype? Like, what was the first step that it feels like something is working? Like,

26:52.880 --> 26:58.640
 is it you interacting with another friend? Yeah, I think the first step was like,

26:59.920 --> 27:03.600
 it's one thing to tell someone about an idea, but it's another thing to put in their hands and kind

27:03.600 --> 27:11.360
 of see like, the way their eyes kind of look. And when I'd go, I'd walk around cross campus,

27:11.360 --> 27:15.440
 which is part of Yale, and I'd literally just go up to people and run up to them and be like,

27:15.440 --> 27:18.800
 try this, try this, you got to try this. This is pre quarantine, by the way, of course, this would

27:18.800 --> 27:22.160
 never be the same post quarantine, but like, you got to try this, you got to try this. Like,

27:22.160 --> 27:26.240
 what is it? And I'd be like, and I explain, it's like an anonymous discussion feed for our Yale

27:26.240 --> 27:32.480
 campus. And you see their gears turning. And they just, some people would be like, not interested.

27:32.480 --> 27:37.440
 I'm like, fine, not your target demographic, I get it, you'll come eventually. But some people,

27:37.440 --> 27:44.160
 like, you could see it, they got it, they're like, yes. And that's when I was like, okay, okay,

27:44.160 --> 27:51.040
 there is, and you don't need, I mean, you don't need 50% of people to like it. You need what,

27:51.600 --> 27:57.280
 5%, 10% to love it, and then they'll tell 5%, 10%. Yeah, worn a mouth, yeah. And you're good.

27:57.280 --> 28:04.080
 Of course, the first version was very, very crappy, but seeing people trying despite all the

28:04.080 --> 28:09.120
 crappiness wasn't, it was sort of enough to be the first step. And, you know, since, since then,

28:09.120 --> 28:15.280
 all of my codes been stripped out. I now have friends who basically have told me, don't bother

28:15.280 --> 28:18.640
 with the coding part, you do, you do the rest, you just make sure that we can code because they

28:18.640 --> 28:22.880
 want to code of great. I mean, I'm not an engineer. Yeah, I never intended to be an engineer. And

28:22.880 --> 28:28.400
 there's a lot to do that's not engineering. Yes. But the point was just to validate the idea,

28:28.400 --> 28:35.280
 so to speak. When was the moment that you felt like we've created something special? Maybe a

28:35.280 --> 28:44.160
 moment where you're proud of that this is, this is, this has the potential to actually be the very

28:45.440 --> 28:50.880
 implementation of the idea that I initially had. There's so many, there's so many little

28:50.880 --> 28:55.280
 moments. It's like, and I bet there'll still be moments in the, in the future that make,

28:55.280 --> 29:01.280
 that make it hard to like, totally say like. Yeah, we should say this is, this is still very

29:01.280 --> 29:06.560
 early days of Librex. Yeah, it's literally only, it's only been a year since we've had like,

29:06.560 --> 29:11.040
 actual like a lot of people on the app. Yeah, about a year. Oh, wow. Okay. I mean, there's some

29:11.040 --> 29:15.520
 crazy moments I could talk about sort of going to Dartmouth because it's one thing to like get

29:15.520 --> 29:21.360
 some traction at your school. Yeah. People know you and you know, it's, it's your school, you know.

29:21.360 --> 29:26.320
 It's another thing to go to another school and where no one knows you and sign up 90% of the

29:26.320 --> 29:32.320
 campus overnight. Wow. So tell me that story. You're invading another territory. It was literally

29:32.320 --> 29:39.600
 like that. Did you buy it like a Dartmouth sweatshirt? Purposefully, I didn't want to fraud anyone,

29:39.600 --> 29:44.720
 but I was purposefully nondescript in my clothing. Yeah. No yell stuff, no Dartmouth stuff.

29:44.720 --> 29:53.200
 Just blend in. I'll get, I'll go back there. So what happened was this was like March of last year.

29:54.400 --> 30:01.280
 So almost, almost a year ago today. And I really wanted to see if we could go from sort of one

30:01.280 --> 30:07.680
 campus to two campuses. So I didn't know anyone at Dartmouth campus, but I kind of

30:07.680 --> 30:16.080
 had some cold emails, some warm ish emails. And I went to people and I was like, basically,

30:16.080 --> 30:20.800
 can I sleep on your floor for two days during finals period? I had a lot of people who said,

30:20.800 --> 30:24.320
 this is crazy. Like no one's going to, no one wants to download an app during finals period,

30:24.320 --> 30:28.720
 a social app during the finals period. But I emailed a few people and I was like,

30:29.760 --> 30:33.120
 you know, can I sleep on your floor? And one of them was crazy enough to say, sure,

30:33.120 --> 30:39.200
 come to my, come to my door. I have a nice floor. And he ended up today. He's still

30:39.200 --> 30:44.240
 really close. He's a really close friend. But anyway, I take a train knowing nothing about

30:44.240 --> 30:52.480
 this guy besides his first and last name. And I arrive and Dartmouth is really, really remote,

30:53.360 --> 30:58.560
 way more remote than you think to the point where I'm like, he's like, he warned me. He's a really

30:58.560 --> 31:02.560
 hospitable guy. He warned me like, it's going to be hard to get to campus from the train station,

31:02.560 --> 31:06.320
 because it's really remote. And I'm like, I'm sure it's fine. I'll just get an Uber.

31:06.320 --> 31:11.520
 There are no Ubers and handovers. What do you think this is? New Hampshire. So

31:12.240 --> 31:18.000
 Connecticut, I mean, Yale is pretty remote as well. No. Yeah, Yale is, well, I mean,

31:18.000 --> 31:23.440
 Yale's in New Haven, which is a real city. It has Ubers. It has food. It has culture. It has a

31:23.440 --> 31:27.680
 nightclub even. Yeah. Like we're talking about a real city. Like it's not New York. It's not

31:27.680 --> 31:33.280
 Philadelphia where I'm from, but it's a city. New Hampshire is something very different.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.960
 Yeah. Beautiful campus, I'm sure. Beautiful. Oh my gosh. I could tell,

31:36.960 --> 31:42.560
 I could talk so much about, I was blown away by Dartmouth. I started wondering like why I didn't

31:42.560 --> 31:49.520
 apply legitimately between the people and the culture. It was, it was a beautiful vacation.

31:49.520 --> 31:54.720
 So I arrived there, no Uber, but eventually I call this guy who's like the only guy who can

31:54.720 --> 31:59.120
 get you to Dartmouth and takes a couple hours, but we get there. I sleep on this guy's floor.

31:59.120 --> 32:03.360
 I wake up. I ask him if there's any printing. He's like, oh, Dartmouth happens to have free

32:03.360 --> 32:09.840
 printing in the copy room. I print out like 2,000 posters until the guy in the copy room

32:09.840 --> 32:13.200
 literally goes to me. He's like, kid, I don't know what you're doing, but you need to get out of here.

32:15.200 --> 32:20.080
 I'm going, I'm going. I found the limits. I know. Yeah. I found the limit. And I think a lot of

32:20.080 --> 32:25.600
 startups is about finding the limits. That's a little piece of advice. Um, socially. Yeah.

32:25.600 --> 32:31.360
 He's like, you got to get out of here. And I, um, I then go to every single dorm door.

32:31.360 --> 32:36.880
 I put a poster under every single dorm door advertising the app with a QR code. Yeah.

32:36.880 --> 32:42.400
 I walk around campus saying hi to everyone and talking about the app. I go from table to table

32:42.400 --> 32:47.840
 in the cafeteria, introduce myself, say hi, and tell them to download the app. It's exhausting.

32:47.840 --> 32:52.800
 There's so many steps, so many crotch down to slip the poster into the dorm door. My legs were

32:52.800 --> 32:59.920
 burning. Um, but by the end of it, 24 hours later, I'm sitting on a, I'm sitting in a

32:59.920 --> 33:05.200
 bus and I'm just pressing the refresh button on the account creation panel. It's like going up by

33:05.200 --> 33:10.720
 hundreds. And I'm like, oh my gosh, there's something. Word of mouth is working in a sense.

33:10.720 --> 33:16.160
 I mean, it's certainly your like initial seed is, is powerful. Just a piece. Yeah. But then the

33:16.160 --> 33:20.880
 word of mouth is what carries it forward. And what was the explanation you gave to the app?

33:21.440 --> 33:26.320
 It's an anonymity, a fundamental part of it, like saying this is a chance

33:27.280 --> 33:31.040
 for you to speak your mind about your experiences on campus.

33:32.160 --> 33:37.440
 Yeah. I think people get it. You don't need to, what I've realized is you don't need to tell people

33:37.440 --> 33:45.200
 why to try it. They know. Yeah. It's a hunger for this. Exactly. Yeah. So I, all I do is I'm very

33:45.200 --> 33:51.600
 factual. I said, and this is where I kind of ended up coining the kind of the line that I now used

33:51.600 --> 33:56.160
 to say it because I said it so many times and that was 24 hours. I just said it's an anonymous

33:56.160 --> 34:03.840
 discussion feed for Dartmouth. And they're like, yes. Like they've been waiting for it. You know,

34:03.840 --> 34:08.720
 some people are more skeptical, but a lot of people were like, great, I'm excited to try this.

34:08.720 --> 34:13.680
 I'm excited to meet people and connect. And I mean, the way Dartmouth is taken to is incredible.

34:13.680 --> 34:21.040
 Everything from professors writing poems during finals period to be like, good luck in finals

34:21.040 --> 34:26.320
 period, you're going to rise like a phoenix or whatever to like, yeah, it's crazy to, I heard

34:26.320 --> 34:34.560
 about two women meeting on Librex and starting a finance club at Dartmouth to significant others

34:35.120 --> 34:40.720
 meeting. There was an article recently written up at Yale as well about two queer women who

34:40.720 --> 34:45.280
 met on Librex and started a relationship, which was pretty, it was pretty interesting to see people

34:45.280 --> 34:50.720
 throwing parties pre COVID. Yeah, it was just amazing to see how when you allow people to be

34:50.720 --> 34:55.040
 vulnerable and social, they connect, they people have this natural desire to connect.

34:55.600 --> 35:00.480
 Yeah, when you have whatever natural desire to have a voice, and then when that voice

35:02.800 --> 35:08.560
 is paired with freedom, then you could truly express yourself and there's something

35:08.560 --> 35:14.240
 liberating about that. And in that sense, you're like, you're connecting as your true self,

35:14.240 --> 35:19.040
 whatever that is. What are the most powerful conversations you've seen on the app? You mentioned

35:19.040 --> 35:23.920
 like people connecting. The hard part about that is the sorting, you know, figuring out which one,

35:23.920 --> 35:27.680
 which one am I going to put at the top? Mental sorting out, just something to stand out to you.

35:27.680 --> 35:32.720
 Sorry, I don't mean to do like the top 10 conversations ever of all time, ever on the app.

35:32.720 --> 35:37.120
 I just mean like stuff that you remember that stands out to you. I remember this one really

35:37.120 --> 35:46.640
 amazing comment from this, he was a Mexican international student who spoke out and this

35:46.640 --> 35:52.720
 post was super edgy, but yet it got hundreds and hundreds of upvotes within the Yale community.

35:52.720 --> 35:57.200
 It was a Yale community specific post and we should point out that there's a school specific

35:57.200 --> 36:02.080
 community now and there's an all IV community. So this was specifically in the Yale community.

36:02.080 --> 36:09.120
 And this was a little while ago, but it stuck with me. This Mexican international student

36:09.120 --> 36:16.160
 comes to Yale and he starts talking about his experience in the La Casa, which is the Mexican

36:16.160 --> 36:22.080
 Latin X as they would say, cultural center at Yale and how he doesn't feel welcome there because

36:22.080 --> 36:29.120
 he's Roman Catholic basically and international and how he doesn't feel like he fits with their

36:29.120 --> 36:34.240
 agenda. And as a result, this place that's supposed to be home for him, he feels outcasted

36:34.240 --> 36:39.920
 and feels more alone than he does anywhere else on campus. That's powerful. That was powerful to me.

36:39.920 --> 36:45.600
 Yeah. It's hearing someone, someone who should be feeling supported by this culture say,

36:47.440 --> 36:52.720
 actually, this is not doing anything for me. Like this is not helping me. Yeah. This is

36:52.720 --> 37:01.840
 not where I feel at home. So what do you make of anonymity? Because it seems to be a fundamental

37:01.840 --> 37:08.400
 aspect of the power of the app, right? But at the same time, anonymity on the internet,

37:09.680 --> 37:15.840
 so it protects us, right? It gives us freedom to have a voice, but it can also bring out the

37:15.840 --> 37:22.640
 dark sides of human nature like trolls or people who want to be malicious want to hurt others

37:22.640 --> 37:30.160
 purely for the joy of hurting others, being cruel for fun and going to the dark places.

37:30.160 --> 37:35.040
 So like what do you make of anonymity as a fundamental feature of social interaction,

37:35.040 --> 37:40.160
 like the pros and the cons? Yeah, just to break that down a bit, I would say a lot of those same

37:40.160 --> 37:46.000
 things about a place like Twitter where people are very unanonymous. Having said that, of course,

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
 there's a different sort of capacity people have when they're anonymous, right? In all different

37:52.000 --> 37:57.040
 sorts of ways. So what do I make of anonymity? I think it can be incredibly liberating and allow

37:57.040 --> 38:01.920
 people to be incredibly vulnerable and to connect in different ways, both on politics. And there

38:01.920 --> 38:08.000
 was a lot to talk about this year regarding politics and personally being vulnerable,

38:08.000 --> 38:12.800
 talking about relationships and mental health. I think it allows people to have a community

38:12.800 --> 38:20.320
 that's not performative. And of course, there's this other side where people can sometimes break

38:20.320 --> 38:24.800
 rules or say things that they wouldn't otherwise say that people don't always agree with or that

38:24.800 --> 38:31.040
 people might find repugnant. And to an extent, these can facilitate great conversations.

38:31.040 --> 38:35.440
 And on the other hand, we have to have moderation in place and we have to have community guidelines

38:35.440 --> 38:41.120
 to make sure that the anonymity doesn't overwhelm the purpose, which is that anonymity,

38:41.680 --> 38:47.200
 first of all, anonymity is a tool in Librex. It was not the purpose of Librex. It is a way that

38:47.200 --> 38:53.840
 we get towards these authentic conversations given our campus climate. And second of all,

38:53.840 --> 39:00.080
 I would say it's a spectrum. It's not just, it's not just Librex is anonymous, right?

39:01.360 --> 39:06.800
 Because Librex isn't totally anonymous. Everyone's a verified Ivy League student.

39:06.800 --> 39:12.400
 You know exactly what school everyone goes to. You only have one account per person at Yale,

39:12.400 --> 39:19.040
 meaning if, meaning that, I mean, what that amounts to is people have more of an ownership in the

39:19.040 --> 39:24.160
 community and people know that they're connected and they have a common vernacular. So the anonymity

39:24.160 --> 39:29.360
 is a scale and it's a tool. But you can also trust, I mean, this is the difference between Reddit's

39:29.360 --> 39:36.000
 anonymity where you can easily create multiple accounts. When you have only one account per

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
 person, or at least it's very difficult to create multiple accounts, then you can trust

39:42.000 --> 39:48.080
 that the anonymous person you're talking to is a human being. Not a bot. I try to be completely

39:48.080 --> 39:54.640
 unanonymous now in my public interactions. I try to be as real in every way possible,

39:54.640 --> 40:01.360
 like zero gap between private me and public me. Why exactly did you, it seems like this is an

40:01.360 --> 40:06.800
 intentional mission. What made you want to sort of bridge that gap between the private sphere and

40:06.800 --> 40:11.680
 public sphere? Because that's unique. I know a lot of intellectuals who would make a

40:11.680 --> 40:16.640
 different decision. Yeah, interesting. I had a discussion with Naval about this,

40:16.640 --> 40:22.880
 actually, with a few others that have a very clear distinction between public and private.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.760
 Something I'm struggling with, by the way, personally, I'm thinking about.

40:27.760 --> 40:40.960
 One on the very basic surface level is if you carry with yourself lies, small lies or big lies,

40:41.840 --> 40:51.200
 it's extra mental effort to remember what you're supposed to say and not supposed to say.

40:51.200 --> 40:57.920
 That's on a very surface level of like, it's just easier to live life when you have the

40:57.920 --> 41:06.560
 smaller the gap between the private you and the public you. The second is, I think for me,

41:06.560 --> 41:15.120
 from an engineering perspective, if I'm dishonest with others, I will too quickly become dishonest

41:15.120 --> 41:22.080
 with myself. And in so doing, I will not truly be able to think deeply about the world and come up

41:22.080 --> 41:27.840
 and build revolutionary ideas. There's something about honesty that feels like it's that first

41:27.840 --> 41:33.280
 principles thinking that's almost like overused as a term, but it feels like that requires radical

41:33.280 --> 41:39.360
 honesty, not radical asshole and richness, but radical honesty with yourself, with yourself.

41:39.360 --> 41:45.680
 And it feels like it's difficult to be radically honest with yourself when you're being dishonest

41:45.680 --> 41:53.120
 with the public. And also, I have a nice feature, honestly, that in this current social context,

41:53.120 --> 41:59.840
 so we can talk about race and gender, and what are the other topics that are touchy?

41:59.840 --> 42:05.760
 Ethnicity and nationality. All those things. I mean, like family structure.

42:05.760 --> 42:12.320
 Maybe I'm ineliquent in the way I speak about them, but I honestly, when I look in the mirror,

42:13.120 --> 42:19.920
 like, I'm not deeply hateful of a particular race, or even just hateful particular race.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.800
 I'm sure I'm biased and I've tried to like think about those biases and so on. And also,

42:24.800 --> 42:30.640
 I don't have any creepy shit in my closet about living. It seems like everybody,

42:30.640 --> 42:35.680
 it seems like a lot of people got like did a lot of creepy stuff in their life.

42:36.720 --> 42:42.720
 And I just feel like that's really nice and deliberating. And especially now, you know,

42:42.720 --> 42:47.840
 it's funny because I've gotten a bit of a platform. And I think it all started when I went,

42:47.840 --> 42:53.920
 there's a famous comedian, female comedian, Whitney Cummings. And, you know, I've gotten a lot of

42:53.920 --> 43:01.840
 amazing women writing me throughout. But when I went on Whitney, it was like the number of DMs I

43:01.840 --> 43:09.920
 get on Instagram from women, it's just ridiculous. And I think that was a really important moment

43:09.920 --> 43:17.360
 for me is like, I speak and I feel, you know, I really value love long term monogamy with like

43:17.360 --> 43:25.600
 one person. And it's like, I could see where a lot of guys would now continue that message

43:25.600 --> 43:30.720
 in public and in private, just start sleeping around. And so like, that's an important statement

43:30.720 --> 43:35.920
 for me mentally is like, nope. Straight and narrow, just go straight and not out of fear,

43:35.920 --> 43:42.320
 but out of like principle and just like, live life honestly. And I just, I feel like that's

43:42.320 --> 43:49.200
 truly liberating as a human being. Forget public, all that, because then I feel like I'm on sturdy

43:49.200 --> 43:57.360
 ground. When I say difficult things. And at the same time, sorry, I'm ranting on this, I apologize.

43:57.360 --> 44:04.960
 I'm interested personally. So keep going. I honestly believe in the internet

44:04.960 --> 44:12.240
 and people on the internet, that when they hear me speak, they can see if I'm full of

44:12.240 --> 44:20.800
 shit and not like, I won't be able to fake it. Like they'll see it through. Yeah. So

44:22.960 --> 44:27.360
 I feel like if you're not lying about stuff, you have the freedom to truly be yourself and

44:27.920 --> 44:32.080
 the internet will figure it out. Like we'll figure who you are.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.920
 And people have a natural tendency to be able to just tell bullshit and it makes

44:35.920 --> 44:40.320
 sense from an evolutionary standpoint, right? Exactly. Like why, why wouldn't, why, like

44:41.200 --> 44:47.680
 of all the things that we could evolve to be good at, being able to detect honesty seems like one

44:47.680 --> 44:52.160
 that would be particularly valuable, especially in the sorts of societies we developed into.

44:52.160 --> 44:57.440
 And then also from a selfish perspective, like a success perspective, I think there's a lot of

44:57.440 --> 45:05.360
 folks that have inspired me, like Elon is one of them that shows that there's a hunger for

45:05.360 --> 45:13.840
 genuineness. Like you can build a business as a CEO and be genuine and like real and do stupid

45:13.840 --> 45:18.240
 shit every once in a while, as long as it's coming from the same place of who you truly are.

45:18.240 --> 45:23.680
 Like Elon's inspiration with that. And then there's a lot of other people I admire that

45:23.680 --> 45:31.840
 are counter inspirations in the sense like they're very formal. They hold back a lot of themselves.

45:31.840 --> 45:36.000
 And it's like, I know how brilliant those people are. And I think they're not being

45:36.000 --> 45:42.720
 as effective of leaders, public faces of companies as they could be. I mean, to be honest, like

45:43.760 --> 45:48.080
 not to throw shade, but I will is like Mark Zuckerberg is an example of that.

45:48.080 --> 45:54.560
 Jack Dorsey is also a bit of an example of that. I like Jack a lot. I've talked to him a lot. I

45:54.560 --> 46:02.480
 will talk to him more. I think he's a much more amazing person than he conveys through his public

46:03.200 --> 46:08.400
 presentation. I think a lot of that has to do with PR and marketing people having an effect.

46:08.400 --> 46:11.920
 Listen, it's difficult. I think it's really difficult. It's probably many of the same

46:11.920 --> 46:19.200
 difficulties you will face as the pressures. But it's hard to know what to do. But I think

46:19.200 --> 46:23.040
 as much as possible as an individual, you should try to be honest in the face

46:24.400 --> 46:31.680
 of the world and the company that wants you to be more polished. And that being more polished

46:31.680 --> 46:36.880
 turns you into a politician. And politician eventually turns into being dishonest.

46:36.880 --> 46:39.280
 Dishonest with the world and dishonest with yourself.

46:39.280 --> 46:44.720
 Something I noticed, which was of the people you mentioned, those things have had ramifications

46:44.720 --> 46:51.360
 in terms of letting things go too far, get out of hand. And you wonder like, it's an aspect of

46:51.360 --> 46:57.040
 lying, right? You say one lie goes to another lie. You push it down. It doesn't matter. You can

46:57.040 --> 47:02.880
 talk and figure it out later. You can figure it out later pretty soon. You've dug a pretty big

47:02.880 --> 47:08.480
 hole. And I think if we look at Twitter and we look at Facebook, I think it goes without saying

47:08.480 --> 47:13.760
 what sorts of holes have been dug because of, perhaps because of a lack of honesty that goes

47:13.760 --> 47:19.280
 all the way up to the leaders. So yeah, there's two problems within the company. It doesn't make

47:19.280 --> 47:25.520
 you as effective of a leader, I think. That's one. And two, for social media companies,

47:26.720 --> 47:32.000
 I think people need to trust like, it doesn't have to be the CEO, but it has to be like,

47:32.000 --> 47:39.280
 this is how humans work. We want to look to somebody where like, I trust you. If you're

47:39.280 --> 47:46.560
 going to use a social media platform, I think you have to trust the set of individuals working

47:46.560 --> 47:50.560
 at the top of that social network. 100%. Something I realized really quickly,

47:50.560 --> 47:56.640
 one of the lessons throughout the startup was that people don't totally connect to products as much

47:56.640 --> 48:04.160
 as they connect to people. And I mean, I don't know how much you spent on Librex. You've only

48:04.160 --> 48:11.040
 been here the last couple weeks, like last week, but I mean, I love the product. And one of the

48:11.040 --> 48:15.760
 aspects of me loving the product is that I was super active and I've been super active throughout

48:15.760 --> 48:20.800
 the entire time. And the amount of support I've received has made that very easy to do

48:21.840 --> 48:26.240
 from the community and the fact that I could, I mean, so I came to Boston for this interview,

48:26.240 --> 48:34.560
 right? I came to Boston. I got off the train. It was around 5.30pm. I checked Librex. Someone

48:34.560 --> 48:38.480
 is writing, hey, I'm in Boston. Does anyone want to get dinner? 30 minutes later, I'm

48:38.480 --> 48:44.400
 getting dinner with them. That's amazing. And I mean, it's incredible. First of all,

48:44.400 --> 48:49.920
 as an entrepreneur, the amount of stuff I learn from these people and when they

48:49.920 --> 48:54.320
 reiterate and I hear that they got the message through the product, I mean, that's incredibly

48:54.320 --> 49:00.160
 validating. But also, I mean, I think it's just important to be able to put a face to a brand

49:00.160 --> 49:05.920
 and especially a brand that's built on trust. Because fundamentally, the users are trusting us

49:05.920 --> 49:12.560
 with some really important discussions and some really, and a movement to some degree,

49:12.560 --> 49:17.600
 it's a community and a movement. I'll tell you actually why I didn't use the app very much so

49:17.600 --> 49:24.960
 far is there's something really powerful about the way it's constructed, which I felt like a bit

49:24.960 --> 49:31.040
 of an outsider because I don't know the communities. It felt like it's a really strong community

49:31.040 --> 49:38.400
 around each of these places. And so I felt like it made me really wish there was an MIT one.

49:39.280 --> 49:45.520
 And so there's both discussions about the deep community issues within Columbia or Yale or so

49:45.520 --> 49:52.880
 on at Dartmouth. And there's also the broader community of the Ivy Leagues that people are

49:52.880 --> 49:58.480
 discussing. But I could see that actually expanding more and more and more. But which is a powerful

49:58.480 --> 50:03.760
 coupling, which is the feeling of like the little village of this little community we're building

50:03.760 --> 50:10.320
 together, but also the broader issues as you can do both discussions. One thing that was important

50:10.320 --> 50:18.880
 to me is talking about social media as a concept, right? I think the way people socialize is very

50:18.880 --> 50:25.520
 much context dependent. So we're talking about people understanding each other through language,

50:25.520 --> 50:32.880
 through English. And these languages are constructed in a very nuanced way, in a very

50:34.240 --> 50:40.000
 sort of temperamental way, right? And you kind of need a similar context to be able to have

50:40.000 --> 50:46.560
 productive conversations. So to me, it's really important that these groups, they share something

50:46.560 --> 50:52.800
 in common, a really big lived experience, the Ivy League or their school community. And they have

50:52.800 --> 50:56.160
 a similar vocabulary, they have a similar background, they know what's happening in their

50:56.160 --> 51:01.760
 community. And so having social media that is community connected to me was fundamental. Like

51:02.480 --> 51:07.200
 you talked about anonymity. To me, community is the thing that when I think about Librex,

51:07.200 --> 51:13.440
 I think what makes it different. It's the fact that everyone knows what's going on,

51:13.440 --> 51:17.200
 everyone comes from a similar context, and people can socialize in a way where they're,

51:18.160 --> 51:22.640
 they understand each other because they're been through used or lived experience, they've been

51:22.640 --> 51:29.120
 through so many of the same lived experiences. One like clarification, is there an easy way

51:29.120 --> 51:38.400
 if you choose to then connect in meat space, in physical space? So the, I guess the sort of magic

51:38.400 --> 51:43.520
 of it. And I was talking to a bunch of Harvard Librexers who I met off the app while I was in

51:43.520 --> 51:48.160
 Boston. And every time they told me this is my favorite part of the app, this is what I love

51:48.160 --> 51:52.800
 about the app. We have this matching system, which is an anonymous direct message that you can send

51:52.800 --> 52:01.120
 to any poster. So like I was talking to this guy who, he was really into coin collection.

52:01.680 --> 52:05.760
 And he met other people who were really into coin collection through a post and what they,

52:05.760 --> 52:10.800
 he would make a post about coin collection. And then someone would come to him and they'd be like,

52:10.800 --> 52:15.120
 and they could direct message him anonymously. And it would just show them that his, it would

52:15.120 --> 52:20.480
 just show him their school. And then they could just text chat totally anonymously direct message

52:20.480 --> 52:25.920
 if he accepted the anonymous request. Do they see the usernames, right? There are no usernames on

52:25.920 --> 52:34.240
 Librex. It's all just schools names. So he made this post about coin collection. And he got a

52:34.240 --> 52:41.600
 direct message. Yeah, I guess so, right? No user name. I was just looking at the text. Yeah.

52:41.600 --> 52:47.440
 That's interesting. That's right. And I can tell you, I can go into why. That's really interesting.

52:47.440 --> 52:53.760
 Yeah, I can go into truly is anonymous. It's, well, I mean, but it's not exactly. It's a very

52:53.760 --> 53:00.240
 different kind of anonymous. And the reason, the reason that we made that decision is because

53:00.240 --> 53:04.720
 we wanted people to connect to ideas. We want people to connect to things in the moment. We don't

53:04.720 --> 53:10.320
 want people to go, Oh, I know this guy. He said this other thing. And we didn't want people to

53:10.320 --> 53:14.400
 feel like they were at risk of being doxxed. So it's just, these are small communities, right?

53:14.400 --> 53:21.360
 We talked about this. Everyone knows someone who knows you. And in 2021, it would not take much to

53:21.360 --> 53:27.680
 be able to figure out who someone might be just through a couple of posts. So it's both safety

53:27.680 --> 53:32.800
 and about the ideas in terms of not adding usernames. Anyway, we have this anonymous direct

53:32.800 --> 53:38.000
 message system where you can direct message the original poster of any post, the OP, if you're

53:38.000 --> 53:44.480
 a redditor of any post. And you, that, that makes it really easy to meet up because once you guys

53:44.480 --> 53:50.560
 are one on one, you can exchange a number, you can exchange a Snapchat, you can exchange an email

53:51.360 --> 53:56.000
 probably not very often, but you could. And then that's how people meet up, matching.

53:56.560 --> 54:01.920
 And then a lot of people connect in this way. Let me just take a small step into the technical.

54:01.920 --> 54:06.720
 I read somewhere, I don't know if it's true that one of the reasons you were rejected from YC,

54:06.720 --> 54:14.160
 Y Combinator in the final rounds is because one of the principles is to refuse to sell user data.

54:15.200 --> 54:24.480
 Can you speak to that? What's, why do you think it's important not to sell user data and sort of,

54:24.480 --> 54:30.400
 which draws a clear contrast between other, basically any other service on the internet?

54:30.400 --> 54:37.360
 I mean, to be honest, it's quite simple. I mean, we talk about this platform, people are talking

54:37.360 --> 54:43.440
 about their most intimate secrets, their political opinions, you know, what, how, how are they feeling

54:43.440 --> 54:49.600
 about what's going on in their city, you know, during the summer? How, how are they feeling about

54:51.360 --> 54:55.760
 the political cycle and also their mental health, their relationships?

54:55.760 --> 55:03.200
 These are some of the most intimate thoughts that people were having. Point blank, I don't think it was

55:03.200 --> 55:10.400
 ethical to pawn them off for a profit. I didn't think it was moral. I don't think I could sleep

55:10.400 --> 55:15.520
 at night if that was what I was doing is turning these people's most intimate beliefs and secrets

55:15.520 --> 55:22.560
 into a currency that I bought and sold. There's something very off about that.

55:22.560 --> 55:29.840
 Yeah. I tend to believe that there is some room, so like, like Facebook would just take that data

55:29.840 --> 55:35.600
 and sell it, right? But there's some room in transparency and giving people the choice on

55:35.600 --> 55:42.080
 which parts they can, I wouldn't even see it as sell, but like share with advertisers.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.280
 Are you going to give them a profit?

55:44.320 --> 55:48.400
 So right, you have to monetize, you have to create an entire system, you have to rethink this whole

55:48.400 --> 55:55.440
 thing, right? But as long as you give people control and are transparent and make it easy,

55:55.440 --> 55:59.280
 like, I think it's really difficult to delete a Facebook account or like delete all your data.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.520
 I've tried. It's very difficult.

56:03.200 --> 56:08.320
 So like, just make it easy and trust in that if you create a great product, people are not

56:08.320 --> 56:14.320
 going to do it. And if they do it, then they're not actually a deep loving member of the community.

56:14.320 --> 56:20.960
 What's that? So we very quickly realized that user privacy was something that

56:22.160 --> 56:25.200
 was not only a core value, but was something that users really cared about.

56:25.760 --> 56:29.840
 And we added this functionality. It's just a button that says, forget me.

56:30.960 --> 56:37.200
 You press it, like two clicks. It's not that hard. We just remove your email from the database.

56:39.120 --> 56:42.960
 Yeah, you're good. Beautiful. I think Facebook should have that.

56:42.960 --> 56:50.880
 I honestly, so call me crazy, but maybe you can actually speak to this, but I don't think Facebook,

56:51.520 --> 56:55.440
 well, now they would. But if they did it earlier, they would lose that much money.

56:56.480 --> 57:02.320
 If they allow like transparently tell people, you could just delete everything. They also

57:02.320 --> 57:10.480
 explain that like, in ways that's going to potentially like lessen your experience in

57:10.480 --> 57:18.000
 the short term, like explain that. But then there shouldn't be like multiple clicks of a button

57:18.000 --> 57:24.880
 that don't make any sense. I'm trying to hold back from ranting about Instagram. Because let me

57:24.880 --> 57:30.320
 just say it real quick, because I've been locked out of Instagram for a month. And there's a whole

57:30.320 --> 57:37.680
 group inside Facebook that are like supporters of like Lex, help Lex. Freelax? Freelax. I wasn't

57:37.680 --> 57:42.640
 blocked. It was just like a bug in the system. Somebody was hammering the API with my account.

57:42.640 --> 57:47.120
 And so they kept thinking I'm a bot. Anyway, it's a bug. It happens to a lot of people.

57:47.120 --> 57:51.360
 But like, first of all, I appreciate the love from all the amazing engineers and Instagram and

57:51.360 --> 57:58.160
 Facebook. Well, those folks, the entire mechanism though is somehow broken. I mean, I put that on

57:58.160 --> 58:03.280
 the leadership, but it's also difficult to operate a large company once it scales, all those kinds

58:03.280 --> 58:11.680
 of things. But it should not be that difficult to do some basic, basic things that you want to do,

58:11.680 --> 58:20.320
 which is in the case of Facebook, that's verify your identity to the app. And also in the case

58:20.320 --> 58:30.320
 of Facebook, in the case of Librex, like disappear. If you choose, there's downsides to disappearing,

58:30.320 --> 58:37.360
 but it should not be a difficult process. And yeah, I think people are waking up to that.

58:37.360 --> 58:46.320
 I think there's a lot of room for an app like Librex with its foundational ideas to redefine

58:46.320 --> 58:51.520
 what social media should look like. And like you said, I think beautifully, anonymity is not the

58:51.520 --> 58:59.200
 core value. It's just the tool you use. And who knows, maybe anonymity will not always be the

58:59.200 --> 59:04.640
 tool you use. Like if you give people the choice, who knows what this evolves from the login page

59:04.640 --> 59:09.760
 you initially created. The key thing is the founding principles. And again, who knows if you

59:09.760 --> 59:14.000
 give people a really nice way to monetize their data, maybe they'll no longer be a thing that

59:14.800 --> 59:20.000
 you say do not sell user data. Yeah, all those kinds of things. But the basic principles should be

59:20.000 --> 59:29.680
 there. And also a good, simple interface design goes a really long way, like simplicity and

59:29.680 --> 59:37.200
 elegance, which Librex currently is. Clubhouse is a lot better, by the way. I don't mean to go too

59:37.200 --> 59:43.200
 deep into the history, but the... It was bad. I didn't look at the early pictures. Oh, thank goodness.

59:43.200 --> 59:50.560
 I read somewhere that it was like a white screen, like with black... The up and down vote buttons

59:50.560 --> 59:57.920
 were like these big, these big freaking boxes. And I don't know, I could go on, but it was my

59:59.120 --> 1:00:05.760
 genius design skills. I almost failed art class when I was in first grade. And I think

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:10.640
 I still have similar skills to my first grade self. But it's gotten a lot better. And thanks

1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:15.680
 to a lot of my friends who have sort of chipped in here and there. Oh, I love the idea of a button

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:23.440
 that just like, forget me. I don't know, that's really moving, actually. That's actually all

1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:31.440
 people want. Is they want, I think... Okay, I'll speak to my experience. I will give so much more

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:40.400
 if I could just disappear if I needed to. And I trusted the community. I trusted the founders

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:47.280
 and the principals. That's really powerful, man. The trust and ease of escape. Yeah.

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:54.640
 You've also kind of mentioned moderation, which is really interesting. So with this anonymity

1:00:55.280 --> 1:01:01.120
 and this community, I don't know if you've heard of the internet, but there's trolls on the internet.

1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:08.880
 So I've heard. And even if they go to Yale and Dartmouth, there's still people that probably

1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:19.520
 enjoy the sort of being the guerrilla warfare contra revolutionary and just like creating chaos

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:27.040
 in a place of love. So how do you prevent chaos from and hatred breaking out in Librex?

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:34.720
 So the way I think about it is we have these principles. They're pretty simple and they're

1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:39.600
 pretty easy to enforce. And then beyond the principles, we have a set of moderators,

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:43.680
 moderate from every single Ivy League school, a team of diverse moderators who enforce these

1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:48.320
 principles, but not only enforce the principles, but kind of clue us in to what's happening in

1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:54.080
 their community and how the real life context of their community translates to the Librex context

1:01:54.080 --> 1:02:01.200
 of their community. And beyond that, we have conversation with them about the standards

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:05.840
 of the community. And we're constantly talking about what needs to be further elucidated and what

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:11.280
 needs to be tweaked. And we're in constant communication with the community. Now, if you

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.040
 want me to get into the principles that underlie Librex's moderation policy.

1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:18.560
 Yeah, please. Maybe you can explain that there's moderators. What does that mean?

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:21.920
 How are they chosen? And what are the principles under which they operate?

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:28.160
 Sure. So how are the moderators chosen? The moderators are all volunteers. They're Librexers

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:35.840
 who reach out to me and respond to the opportunity to become a moderator. And the way they're chosen

1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:41.200
 is basically we want to make sure that they're in tune with their community. We want to make sure

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:45.360
 they come from diverse backgrounds. And we want to make sure that they sort of understand what

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:50.160
 the community is about. And then we ask them some questions about how they would deal with

1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:55.280
 certain scenarios, ones that we've had in the past and we feel strongly about. And then also ones

1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:58.480
 that are a little more murky, where we want to see that they're sort of thinking about these

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:06.080
 things in a critical way. And from there, we choose a set and they have the power to

1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:13.120
 take down posts. Of course, everything at the end of the day pens my review, but they can take

1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:18.080
 them down and we can reinstate them if it's a problem. But they can take down posts and they

1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:22.960
 can advocate for different moderation standards and different moderation policies.

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:30.160
 So for now, you're the Linus Torvald of this community. And so meaning like you're able to,

1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:38.400
 like people are actually able to like email you or like text me, text you, contact you and get a

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:45.040
 response. Like you respond to basically everybody. And then you're like really, you know, you're

1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:51.520
 living that live on people's floor life currently. That's not necessarily, this is the early days,

1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:58.560
 folks. I knew Ryan before he was a billionaire and he was cool. And then he was in a mansion

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:07.040
 making meats on his barbecue. No, okay. But you know, how does it scale? Like what,

1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:15.600
 I suppose how does it scale is the question. I mean, with Linus, I don't know if you're familiar

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:20.080
 with the Linux open source community, but he still stayed at the top for a while. It was really

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.800
 important like leadership there was really important to drive that large scale, really

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:32.480
 productive open source community. What do you see your role as Librex grows? And in general,

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:35.040
 what are the mechanisms of scaling here for moderation?

1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:42.000
 Do I see it open discourses fundamental to the purpose of the app? Right. So as the,

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:49.040
 I guess you could say founder, CEO, what have you, part of my purpose has to be to

1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:55.120
 enforce the vision, right? And part of the vision is open discourse. And that does come down in part

1:04:55.120 --> 1:05:01.440
 to reasonable moderation and community guide reasonable moderation. So I imagine that will

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:06.880
 always be something that I'm intimately involved with to some degree. Now the degree to which,

1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:15.920
 the way in which that manifests, I imagine will have to change, right? And hopefully I'll be able to,

1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:22.640
 just like you can hire a CTO, hopefully I'll be able to be integrated in hiring people who are,

1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:30.080
 who understand the way that we are sort of operating and the reasonable standards

1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:35.920
 of moderation. And there can be a sort of hierarchical structure. But I think when you have a

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:41.040
 product whose key purpose is to allow people to have these difficult conversations on campus that

1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:48.960
 need to be had, I can never, I can never fully, I don't think I can fully ever abdicate that

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:55.440
 responsibility. I think that would be like, I mean, that would be like Bezos abdicating eCommerce,

1:05:55.440 --> 1:06:00.880
 right? Like that is, that's part of the job. Yeah. Of course you can run companies in different

1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:05.760
 ways. I think the, because he might have abdicated quite a bit of the details there.

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:09.840
 It's hard for me to say because the Amazon does so many things. I think the probably the better

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:15.200
 example is like Elon Woodrock as he's still at the core of the engineering. He's at the core

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:18.880
 of the engineering. There's some fundamental questions of what he probably does way too much

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:24.480
 of the engineering. Like he's like the lowest level detail. But you're saying like the core

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:30.480
 things that are, that make the app work is, is the moderation of difficult conversations.

1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:36.800
 And by the way, I'm 21 years old. Let's, let's remind us everyone of that. If this thing

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:43.440
 does scale and if this thing continues to be a positive force in a lot of people's lives,

1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:50.640
 who knows what will happen in the next, what I'll learn. I'm still growing definitely as a leader,

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:56.640
 still growing as a thinker, still growing as a person. I don't, I can't pretend that I know

1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:02.640
 how to run a business that is worth, you know, up to a billion dollars, whatever. Yeah. I can't

1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:06.400
 pretend I know how to run a business that's, you know, going to have millions and millions of users.

1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:11.360
 I expect that there are going to be a lot of amazing people who will teach me and a lot of

1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:16.400
 people who have already kind of stepped into my life and helped me out and taught me things.

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:21.920
 And I imagine that I'll learn so much more. I just know that moderation is always going

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:27.520
 to be important to me because I don't think Librex is Librex unless we have open discourse

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:34.560
 and moderation. Reasonable open light touch moderation is at the heart of creating that,

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:40.800
 right? So as a creator of this kind of community in place with anonymity and difficult conversations,

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:48.240
 what, what do you think about this touchy three words that people have been tossing around and

1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:52.560
 politicizing, I would say, but as at the core of the founding of this country, which is the freedom

1:07:52.560 --> 1:08:00.000
 of speech? How do you think about the freedom of speech, this particular kind of freedom of

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:06.640
 expression? And do you think it's a fundamental human right? How do you define it to yourself

1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:11.760
 when you, when you're thinking about it? I've, I went on, especially preparing for this conversation

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:18.880
 down a rabbit hole of like just how unclear it is philosophically, what is meant by this kind of

1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:27.120
 freedom. It's not as easy as people think, but it's interesting, pragmatically speaking, to hear

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:33.760
 how you think about it in the context of Librex. Yeah, it's a tough one, right? And there's a lot

1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:40.640
 there. So I come from the background of being a math major. Maybe it's important to start with that.

1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:47.520
 Yeah. And I found myself in the middle of this question of freedom of speech. One of the wonderful

1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:55.040
 things is that the Librex community is filled with PhDs and governance majors who have taught me

1:08:55.040 --> 1:09:00.000
 a ton about this sort of thing. And I'm still learning. I'm still growing. I'm still probably

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:08.000
 going to modify my perspective to some degree, hopefully. Don't worry. I imagine I'll always

1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:16.560
 support free discourse. Like learning how to speak about stuff is critical here because it's like,

1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:23.120
 I'm learning that this is like a minefield of conversations. Because the moment you say like,

1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:30.800
 even saying freedom of speech is a complicated concept, people will be like, oh, we spotted a

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:35.920
 communist. Like they'll say there's nothing complicated about freedom. Freedom is freedom,

1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:42.640
 bro. It is complicated. First of all, if you talk about, there's different definitions of freedom

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:47.680
 of speech. If you want to go constitution, if you want to talk about the United States specifically

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:54.080
 and what's legal, it's actually not as exciting and not as beautiful as people think of.

1:09:54.080 --> 1:10:00.320
 It's complicated. It's complicated. I think there's ideals behind it that we want to see.

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:06.880
 What does that actually materialize itself in the digital world where we're trying to communicate

1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:15.280
 in ways that allows for difficult conversations and also at the same time doesn't result in the

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:24.800
 silencing of voices, not through like censorship, but through like just assholes being rude. Spam.

1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:31.760
 Spam. So it could be just bots. Racism. Racism. Going back to the name of the app,

1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:40.560
 Librex. Yes. Libre, free. X was support onto for free exchange and the free exchange of what?

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:47.840
 My purpose was to create as many as much inner communication of ideas, be them repugnant or

1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:54.720
 otherwise as possible. And of course, to do that within legal bounds and to do that without causing

1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:01.760
 anyone to be harassed or doxxed. So to keep things focused on the ideas, not the people. And then

1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:12.240
 no BS crap stuff. And so to me, the easiest way to moderate around that, because as you said,

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:17.120
 figuring out what is hateful and what is hate speech is really hard, was to say no sweeping

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:23.920
 statements against core identity groups. And that seems to work on the whole pretty well to be

1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:29.440
 pretty light touch. And hard to do though. It's difficult. Because we like to generalize with

1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:36.640
 humans. It's difficult. But what it comes down to is be specific. And when you think about what

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:41.840
 are sweeping statements against core identity groups, oftentimes these are sort of hackneyed

1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:46.800
 subjects. These are things that have been broached and we've heard them before. They don't really

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:52.320
 lead anywhere productive. So it goes under this principle of be specific and the ideas you're

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:59.600
 discussing. So even for like positive and humor stuff, you try to avoid generalizations against

1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:03.440
 core identity core identity groups. Sorry, what are core identity groups? We're talking,

1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:11.040
 you know, race, religion. Okay. Got it. Even positive stuff.

1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:18.560
 Against negative. Oh, against. Sorry, against, against. Okay. Very, very, we've learned to be

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:24.320
 very specific. Very few words. But the community gets it, you know? Yeah, they get it. I mean,

1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:32.480
 this is the thing. The trouble with rules is as the community grows, they'll figure out ways to

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:37.760
 manipulate the rules. Absolutely. It's human nature. It's creativity. Yeah. Something beautiful

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:42.720
 about it, of course. Unlike an... From an evolutionary perspective, yes. Yeah, the fact that

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:48.800
 people are so creative and so looking to... And because people are genuinely interested in figuring

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:54.880
 out these things about social media. And so they'll 100% see where's the edge. And I mean,

1:12:54.880 --> 1:13:00.640
 part of that's maintaining some level of vagueness in your ruleset, which has its own set of questions

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:04.800
 and something we could think about. And I'm not implying I have all the answers. But there is

1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:09.360
 something really interesting about people being so engaged that they're looking to figure out

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:13.040
 where are those edges and what does that mean? What does that edge mean, you know?

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:20.080
 Well, so one of the things I'm kind of thinking about, like from an individual user of Librex

1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:26.480
 or an individual user of the internet, I think about like that one person that is on Reddit saying

1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:32.320
 hateful stuff or positive stuff doesn't matter or funny stuff. One of the things I think about

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:39.600
 is the trajectory of that individual through life and how social media can help that person

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:44.960
 become the best version of themselves. I don't mean from like an Orwellian sense,

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:49.920
 like educate them properly or something. I just mean like, we're all, I believe,

1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:56.320
 we're all fundamentally good. And I also believe we all have the capacity to do,

1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:04.320
 to create some amazing stuff in this world, whether that's ideas or art or engineering,

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:09.280
 all those kinds of things, just to be amazing people. And I kind of think about like,

1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:15.600
 you know, a lot of social media mechanisms bring out the worst in us. And I try to think like,

1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:23.920
 in the long term, how can, as the social media or how can a website, how kind of tool that you

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:28.880
 create can make the best, like you take a trajectory that makes you a better, better,

1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:32.960
 and better, and like the best version of yourself. So I think about that because like,

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:39.120
 you know, Twitter can really take you down some dark trajectories. I've seen people just not

1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:42.880
 being the best version of themselves. Forget the cancel culture and all that kind of stuff.

1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.520
 It's just like they're not developing intellectually in the way that's going to make

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:52.560
 the best version of themselves. I think Reddit, I'm not sure what I think about Reddit yet,

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:58.880
 because one positive side is all the shit posting. I read it could be just like a release valve

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:04.960
 for some stress in life, and you almost have like a parallel life where you're in meat space,

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:09.760
 you might be actually becoming successful and so on and growing and so on. But you just need

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:15.680
 some times to be angry at somebody. But I tend to not think that's possible. I think

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:22.560
 if you're shit posting, you're probably not spending your time the best way you could.

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:29.440
 I don't know. I'm torn on that. But do you think about that with Librex of creating a trajectory

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:34.480
 for the Yale, for the Dartmouth, for the students to where they grow intellectually?

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.800
 One thing that I think about a lot is how do you incentivize positive content creation?

1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:48.400
 How do you incentivize really intellectual content creation? It's something that, frankly,

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:57.520
 I think about every single day. And I think there are ways that, I mean, one thing that's great

1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:02.400
 about humans is that they can be incentivized. And I think there are ways that you can incentivize

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:05.840
 people to make the right kind of content if that's your goal.

1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:10.080
 So you think such mechanisms exist for such incentivization?

1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:13.680
 I do. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, so to speak.

1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:16.480
 You've got concrete ideas in your mind.

1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:20.480
 I have about three concrete ideas that I'm very, very optimistic about.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:26.960
 You don't even need to share them. I understand totally. But the fact that you have them,

1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:32.720
 that's really good. Because I feel like sometimes the downfall of the social media

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:40.240
 is that there's literally not even a thinking or a discussion about the incentivization of

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:47.680
 positive long term content creation. I mean, Twitter, I really was excited about this when

1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:52.000
 they said like, when Jack has talked about like creating healthy conversations.

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.920
 Yeah, he does seem to care. I've listened to him. I mean, he's a very particular way of saying

1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:01.920
 things. But you get the impression that he's someone who actually cares about these things

1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:06.160
 within the limits of his power. Yeah. And that's the question, the limits of the power.

1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:15.680
 Librex is growing not just in the number of communities, but also in the way you're incentivizing

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:20.000
 positive conversations, like coupled with the moderation and so on.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.560
 So you think there's a lot of innovation to be had in that area?

1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:27.280
 There's a tremendous amount. I think when you think about the reasons people post,

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:33.920
 fundamentally, people want to make a positive impact on their community to some degree. Now,

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:38.560
 there'll always be bad actors. And part of the benefit of sort of our moderation structure

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:42.560
 is that we can limit some of those bad actors, you know, no body counts, no purgating.

1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:48.880
 At the same time, the more you incentivize a certain type of behavior, the better it's going

1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:57.840
 to be. And we don't see it as our role as the platform to force the community in a direction.

1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:02.160
 And frankly, I don't think it would be good for anyone, the community, or the conversations,

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:08.960
 if we force a specific type of conversation. We just need to make the tools to allow people

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:15.280
 to be good and to incentivize good behavior. Yeah, I believe that if you will not need to

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:22.240
 censor, if you allow people at scale to be good, the good will overpower the assholes.

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:26.000
 That's my fundamental belief. I'm very optimistic about that.

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:33.280
 But currently, Librex is small in the sense that it's a small set of communities that I believe.

1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:39.360
 And you mentioned to me offline that by design, you're scaling slowly and carefully.

1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:46.320
 So how does Librex scale? Is it possible, you know, Facebook also started with a small set of

1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:53.680
 communities that were schools, and then now grew to be basically the, if not one of the largest

1:18:53.680 --> 1:19:01.760
 social networks in the world. Do you see Librex as potentially scaling to be beyond even college

1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:05.440
 campuses, but encompassing the whole world?

1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:15.200
 It's a long timeline. I'll say this. Let's get back to where Facebook goes wrong, because clearly,

1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:22.480
 they did a lot right. And we can only speculate about what the objectives were of the founders

1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:28.800
 of Facebook. I'm sure they've said some things, but it's always interesting to know what the

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:38.320
 mythology is versus what the truth is of the matter. So perhaps they've been very successful.

1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:45.200
 I mean, they've taken over the world to some extent. At the same time, the goals of Librex

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:51.760
 are to create these positive communities and these open conversations where people can have

1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:56.080
 real conversation and connection in their communities in a vulnerable and authentic way.

1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:04.560
 And so to that end, which I imagine might be different than the goals of a Facebook, for example,

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:08.000
 one thing that we want to do is keep things intimate and community based.

1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:15.280
 So each school is its own community. And perhaps you could have a slightly broader community.

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:20.240
 Maybe you could have a, I know the California system is an obvious one,

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:26.080
 packed time might be an obvious one. And we can think about that. But fundamentally, the unit

1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:33.840
 of community is your school or your school community. So that's one difference that I

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:39.360
 think will help us. The other thing is that we're scaling intentionally, meaning that when we expand

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:44.880
 to a school, we have moderators in place. We have moderators who understand that school's

1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:51.200
 environment in a very personal level. And we're growing responsibly. We're growing as we're ready,

1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:56.240
 both technologically, but also socially. But as we think we have the tools to

1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:02.080
 preserve the community and to encourage the community to create the sort of content that

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:08.320
 we want them to create. And there's a lot of ways to define community. So first of all,

1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:14.400
 there's geographic community as well. But the way you're kind of defining community with Yale

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:20.480
 and Dartmouth is the email, right? That's what gives you, there's a power to the email

1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:28.880
 in the sense that that's how you can verify, efficiently verify yourself with being a single

1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:37.280
 individual in the university. In that same way, you can verify your employment at a company,

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:44.400
 for example, like Google, Microsoft, Facebook. Do you see or potentially taking on those communities?

1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:50.240
 That'd be fascinating. Getting like anonymous community conversations inside Google.

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:55.040
 100% crossed my mind. To some extent, this is, this is something where

1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:02.400
 I understand the college experience. I understand the need. And I've never, I've never worked at

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:07.760
 Google. I don't know if they would hire me. Hopefully, maybe as a product manager.

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:17.280
 I think if there's a community that needs this product and has that will, which I think,

1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:24.720
 especially as Librex continues to grow and expand and change and learn. And because that's what we're

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:29.920
 doing is we're learning, right? With each community. It's not just about growing. It's about learning

1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:36.640
 from each of these communities and iterating. I think it's quite likely there are going to be

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:43.280
 all sorts of communities that could use this tool to improve their culture, so to speak.

1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:49.280
 So forgive me. I'm not actually like that knowledgeable about the history of attempts of

1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:56.080
 building social networks to solve the problem that you're solving. But I was made aware that there

1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:07.920
 was an app or at least a social network called YikYak that was, had a similar kind of focus.

1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:14.960
 I think the thing you've spoken about that differs between Librex and YikYak is that YikYak was

1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:21.520
 defined, am I pronouncing it right even? You're good? I'm good. I met the founder, so I can confirm.

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:28.640
 Okay, you can confirm. Cool. That it was constrained to a geographical area versus

1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:36.800
 like to the actual community. And that somehow had fundamental like actual differences in

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:42.560
 social dynamics that resulted. But can you speak to the history of YikYak? Like, how does Librex

1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:47.600
 differ? What lessons have you learned from that? Oh, and I should say that I guess there was

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:51.840
 controversial, I don't know, I didn't look at the details, but I'm guessing there's a bunch of

1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:57.760
 racism and hate speech and all that kind of stuff that emerged on YikYak. Okay, so that's an example

1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:06.000
 of like, okay, here's how it goes wrong when you have anonymity on college campuses. So how

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:12.080
 does Librex going to do better? Yeah, YikYak had a lot of problems, content problems, but the content

1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:18.560
 problems go deeper than maybe what the press would reveal. There's a lot to say. And part of it is

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:23.840
 parsing exactly what to talk about when it comes to YikYak. And when you talk about startups, I

1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:30.640
 mean, you know this, you know startups, and you look at the postmortem, it's almost never what

1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:36.320
 people think it is. And oftentimes, these things are somewhat unknowable. And the degree to which

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:42.320
 people seeking confirmation bias, to somebody seeking closure, look to find a singular attribute

1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:47.200
 that caused the failure. It feels like the little details often make all the difference.

1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:54.560
 Yes. And I think the details are so little that as humans, we are not capable of parsing even what

1:24:54.560 --> 1:25:00.880
 they are. But I'll tell you my perspective on it, knowing that I am also a human with biases.

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:11.040
 In this particular case, very significant biases. So I started building Librex for its own merits.

1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:16.800
 At first, I wasn't aware of YikYak, but as I started to talk to people about this platform I

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:23.520
 was building, I was made aware of YikYak and I built it from day one with a lot of the issues

1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:30.240
 YikYak had in mind. So as you said, the one difference between YikYak is the geographical

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:36.960
 versus community based aspect. Going along with that, one thing I realized by researching social

1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:42.160
 media sites is that the majority of the negative content, the content that's

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:51.360
 terrible and breaking all the rules is created by really, and the people who are not reformable,

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:57.360
 so to speak, the people who are not showing the best part of the human experience.

1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:03.440
 It's a really small minority, right? I remember I was listening to the founder of

1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:08.800
 4Cham Moot talk about this, how one guy was able to basically destroy

1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:16.080
 large swaths of his community. That's part of what makes it exciting for that

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:22.080
 minority is how much power they can have. So if you're predisposed to think in this way,

1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:27.200
 it's exciting that you can walk into, like I mentioned the party before, you have a party of

1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:35.920
 a lot of positive people and it feels, especially if you don't have much power in this world,

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:46.880
 it feels exceptionally empowering to destroy the lives of many. And if you think this way,

1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:53.360
 it's a problem, but I'm hopeful that you're right that in most cases it's going to be a minority

1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:59.440
 of people. I think it is, and that's what the research has showed. And one really powerful

1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:05.760
 thing is that we can really actively control who comes in and out of our community based on the

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:11.360
.edu verification. And we can also control who's not in our community because we have that lever

1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:17.200
 where each account is associated with a.edu. So that's the first point I would put out,

1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:23.680
 point out there. Second point is controlled expansion, meaning that we have community moderation.

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:30.000
 We have this panel that allows the moderators to see all of the highly downloaded content,

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:34.640
 all of the reported content, all the flagged content and look through it and decide what they

1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:41.280
 like and what's appropriate and what's not appropriate. And we ping every moderator when

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:47.520
 there's a report. So things are taken down pretty quickly. And we have our standards. And we have,

1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:53.440
 I think above all of that, we have a mission. And it's a community based mission. Yikyak was

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:57.840
 more of a fun app. And by its own admission, it was a place where people could enjoy themselves

1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:07.120
 and could sort of yak. Yikyak, chit chat. We have a bigger purpose than that, frankly. And

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:12.480
 I think that shows in the people who self select to be on that app, to be on Librex and to be on

1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:18.960
 Yikyak, respectively. The last thing I'll say is Yikyak was very few characters. It was a Twitter

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:23.520
 esk platform. And that doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of nuance. It doesn't allow for a

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:30.560
 tremendous amount of conversation. Librex is much more long form. And so the kind of posts that you'll

1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:37.840
 get on Librex can span pages. They're like, what people are starting to realize is that they can

1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:44.960
 reach a lot more people at a lot more pertinent of a time, a lot more quickly, by posting their

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:50.720
 thoughts on Librex than if they went to their school newspaper. And I think the school newspapers

1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:53.840
 might be a little worried about that. But more importantly, we're connecting people in this

1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:58.560
 way where long form communication with nuance that takes into account everything that's happening

1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:08.400
 in the community temporally is really available at Librex and not really communicable in 240 or

1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:15.360
 480 or whatever the number of characters the acts were bound to. And I could talk about the history

1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:22.240
 of Yikyak if you want me to go further. They started, I think they were at 12 schools. And then

1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:28.720
 spring break it. People told their friends, look at this app, a thousand schools signed up and

1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:32.640
 we're had active communities. They had a problem on their hands. And then the high schools come

1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:38.400
 on board. Yeah, I think a lot of the things you said ring true to me, but especially the vision

1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:44.560
 one, which I do think having a vision in the leadership, having a mission makes all the

1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:50.000
 difference in the world. That that's both for the engineers that are building, like the team

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:56.400
 that's building the app, the moderation and users because they kind of the mission carries itself

1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:02.480
 through the behavior of the of the people on the social network.

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:06.640
 As a small tangent, let me ask you something about

1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:14.800
 Parler, but it's less about Parler and more about AWS. So AWS removed Parler from his platform,

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:20.000
 you know, for whatever reasons, doesn't really matter. But the fact that AWS would do this

1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:30.080
 was really, really bothered me personally, because I saw AWS as the computing infrastructure.

1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:36.320
 And I always thought that part could not put a finger on its scale. And I don't know what your

1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:42.560
 thoughts are like, were you bothered by Parler being removed from AWS? And how does that affect

1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:47.760
 how you think about the computing infrastructure on which Librex is based?

1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:55.120
 I was bothered not so much by Parler specifically being taken out of AWS, but more the fact that

1:30:55.920 --> 1:31:02.160
 something that's like a highway, something that people rely on that people build on top of,

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:05.280
 that people assume is going to be somewhat position agnostic,

1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:13.040
 like a road that people drive on is is becoming ideologically sort of discriminatory.

1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:18.480
 And of course, mind you, Amazon can do what it wants. It's a private company.

1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:23.440
 And I support the rights of private companies. I just on an ethical and sort of a deep moral

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:32.240
 level, I wonder like, at what point should a company sort of be agnostic in that in that regard

1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:39.280
 and let developers build on top of their infrastructure? And where does that responsibility

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:45.920
 hold? Yes, it makes you hope that there's going to be, from a capitalistic sense,

1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:49.920
 competitors to AWS will say like, we're not going to put our finger on the scale.

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:56.160
 I mean, on the highway is a good sort of example. It's like if a privately owned highway,

1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:03.680
 exactly, said, we're no longer going to allow, we're only going to allow electric vehicles.

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:09.280
 And a bunch of people in this world would be like, yes, because electric is good for the

1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:20.080
 environment. And yes, but then you have to consider the slippery slope nature of it,

1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:25.440
 but also like the negative impact on the lives of many others. And what that means for innovation

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:31.120
 and for like competition, again, in the capitalistic sense. So there's some nature,

1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:38.960
 there's some level to this hierarchy of our existence that we should not allow to manipulate

1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:43.200
 what's built on top of it. It should be truly infrastructure. And it feels like compute

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:52.000
 is storage and compute is the that layer, like it shouldn't be messed with. I haven't seen anybody

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:56.320
 really complain about it, like in terms of government. And I'm not even sure government is

1:32:56.320 --> 1:33:02.400
 the right mechanism to policy and regulation to step in. Because again, they do a messy job

1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:09.200
 of fixing things. But I do hope there's competitors to AWS to make AWS and step up.

1:33:09.200 --> 1:33:15.360
 Because I do think, you know, I'm a fan of AWS, except this service, it's a good service until

1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:22.800
 this until yeah, until they rip out the rug. And the point is, it's not that necessarily

1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:31.360
 their decision was a bad one with Parler in particular. It's that like the slippery slope

1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:37.600
 nature of it, but also the it takes the good actors that are creating amazing products and

1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:42.080
 makes them more fearful. And when you're more fearful, it's the same reason that anonymity

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:46.640
 is a tool that you don't create the best thing you could possibly create. When you're fearful,

1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:54.160
 you don't create. I think we kind of talked about it a little bit. But I wonder if we can kind of

1:33:54.160 --> 1:34:01.200
 revisit it a little bit. I talked to a guy named Ronald Sullivan, who's a faculty at Harvard Law

1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:08.560
 Professor. He was on the legal defense team. He was the lawyer for Harvey Weinstein and Aaron

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:14.800
 Hernandez for the double murder case. So he takes on these really difficult cases of unpopular figures,

1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:23.040
 because he believes like that's the way you test that we believe in the rule of law. But he was

1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:32.400
 there's a big protest in Harvard to get him basically censor him and to get him to no longer be

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:40.400
 faculty dean, all those kinds of things. And it was by minority of students, but it was a huge

1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:46.560
 blowback, obviously in the public, but also inside Harvard, like that's not okay. He stands for the

1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:50.960
 very principles at the founding of Harvard and at the principles of the founding of this country

1:34:50.960 --> 1:35:00.160
 and the law and so on. But the basic argument is that it was about safe spaces, that it's

1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:08.400
 unsafe to have somebody who is basically supporting Harvey Weinstein. What do you think about this

1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:17.440
 whole idea of safe spaces on college campuses? Because it feels like the mission of Librex is

1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:23.840
 pushing back against the idea of safe spaces. I think safe spaces are fine when they're within

1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:29.760
 people's private lives, within their homes, within their religious organizations. I think the problem

1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:40.480
 becomes when the institution starts encouraging or backing safe spaces. Because what are people

1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:47.360
 being safe from? And oftentimes it seems like there's this idea that the harm that's being

1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:52.560
 attempted to be mitigated is the harm of confronting opinions you disagree with,

1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:58.560
 opinions you might find repugnant. And if this is conflated with a need for safety,

1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:06.560
 then that's where the idea of liberal arts education sort of dies. Of course it's complicated and we

1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:13.440
 still want to have safe intellectual environments. But the way that I hear the term safe space used

1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:19.600
 today, I think it doesn't really have a place within the intellectual context.

1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:25.520
 Yeah, it's funny. I mean, this is why Librex is really exciting is it's pushing those

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:32.320
 difficult conversations and I'd love to see ultimately there does seem to be an asymmetry of

1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:41.600
 power that results in the concept of safe spaces and hate speech being redefined in the slippery

1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:48.400
 slope kind of way where it means basically anything you want it to mean. And it basically is used to

1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:56.320
 silence people, to silence people, they're like good, thoughtful experts. Also on that I would say

1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:02.080
 it has not just a pragmatic purpose, which is the silencing, but also sort of an ideological

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:09.600
 purpose, which is an illinguistic purpose, which is to conflate words with unsafety and harm and

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:17.200
 violence, which is what you kind of see on a cultural linguistic level is happening all around

1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:22.720
 us right now is that this idea that words are harm is very dangerous and slippery concept.

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:27.360
 I mean, it's not you don't have to slip that far to see why that's a problem. Once we start

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:31.920
 making words into violence, and we start criminalizing words, we get into some really

1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:38.400
 authoritarian territory, things that I think, I mean, myself and my background, I don't know

1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:43.200
 how much we have to go into it, but things that my ancestors certainly would be worried about.

1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:50.160
 Wow. What's your background? I'm a child of Holocaust survivors and program survivors.

1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:56.560
 So yeah, I mean, me as well, from different directions, I come from the Soviet Union. So

1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:03.120
 there's a, well, like in most of us, hate and love runs through our blood from our history.

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.720
 You mentioned MIT is being added to Librax. Has it already been added? Yes, it was added

1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:16.240
 today. Today. Okay. So let me ask you, this is exciting because I don't know what your thoughts

1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:21.920
 are about this, but I'll tell you from my perspective, if you're in a lot of MIT folks listen

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:28.480
 to this, I would love it if you join Librax. It'd be interesting to explore conversations

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:38.480
 on several topics inside MIT, but one of the most moving that hasn't been discussed at all,

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:48.080
 except in little flourishes here and there is a topic of Jeffrey Epstein. Now,

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:57.360
 there's been a huge amount of like impact that the connections of various faculty to Jeffrey

1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:04.880
 Epstein and the various things that been said had on MIT, but it feels like the difficult

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:11.440
 conversation haven't had been had. It's the administration trying to clean up and give a

1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:17.840
 bunch of BS to try to pretend like, let's just hide this part. Like nothing is broken, nothing to

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:25.440
 see here. Here's a bad dude that did some bad things and some faculty that kind of misbehaved

1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:30.800
 a little bit because they're a little bit clueless. Let's all look the other way. Harvard did this

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:37.360
 much better, by the way. They completely, it's almost like people pretend like Harvard didn't

1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:44.560
 have anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein, but I think I'd be curious to hear what those

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:53.520
 conversations are because there's conversations on the topic of like, well, obviously sort of

1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:59.840
 sexual assault and disrespecting women on any kind of level within academia, but just women in

1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:06.080
 general. That's an important topic to talk about various, many sets of difficult conversations.

1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:16.400
 And the other topic is funding for research. Like, what are we okay taking money from and

1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:21.600
 what are we not okay taking money from? There's a lot of just interesting, difficult conversations

1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:29.440
 to be had. I've worked with people who refuse to take money from DOD, Department of Defense,

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:35.600
 for example, because in some indirect or direct way, you're funding military, industrial complex,

1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:40.960
 all those kinds of things. I think with Jeffrey Epstein, it's even more stark, this contrast of

1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:48.320
 like, well, what is and isn't ethical to take money from? And I just think, forget academia,

1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:54.480
 I think there's just a lot of interesting deep human discussions to be had, and they haven't been.

1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:57.680
 And there's been somebody, I don't know if you're familiar with Eric Weinstein,

1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:03.200
 who has been outraged by the fact that nobody's talking about Jeffrey Epstein.

1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:11.360
 Nobody's having these difficult conversations. And Eric himself has had a sort of complicated

1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:17.920
 journey through academia in the sense that he's a really kind of renegade thinker in many kinds

1:41:17.920 --> 1:41:22.400
 of ways. I'm not sure if you know who Eric is by any chance. I heard the name. Okay. I actually

1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:27.040
 checked out Zev. Zev. It was heartening for me to see that I was not the youngest person

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:31.440
 on this podcast. You're the second youngest. Second youngest.

1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:45.520
 That's hilarious. But Eric has, he's kind of a renegade thinker. He's a mathematical physicist

1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:51.920
 with, I believe, a PhD at Harvard, and he spends some time at MIT and so on. But he speaks to the

1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:57.120
 fact that sort of there's a culture of conformity and so on. And if you're somebody who's a bit

1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:01.520
 outside of the box, a bit weird and whatever dimension of weird, that makes you actually kind

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:07.200
 of interesting that the system kind of wants to make you an outcast, wants to throw you out.

1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:13.200
 And so he kind of opposes that whole idea. He's the perfect person to have conversations with

1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:20.880
 in this kind of Librax kind of context of anonymity. Because I'll tell you the few conversations

1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:28.320
 that came across, and they were very quickly silenced. And I'm troubled by it. I'm not sure

1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:36.640
 what to think of it. Is there's a few threads inside MIT, like on a mailing list, discussing

1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:41.920
 Marvin Minsky. I don't know if you know how that is. He's an AI researcher. He's a seminal figure

1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:47.920
 in AI before your time. But one of the most important people in the history of artificial

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:59.120
 intelligence. And there was a discussion on a thread that involved the interaction between

1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:05.920
 Marvin Minsky and Jeffrey Epstein. That conversation was quickly shut down. One person was pushed out

1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:11.680
 of MIT, Richard Stallman, who's one of the key figures because of that, because he wanted some

1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:19.280
 clarity about the situation. But he also, he spoke, like we mentioned earlier, without grace,

1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:26.720
 right? But he was quickly punished by the administration because of a few people protesting.

1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:33.280
 And just that conversation, I guess what bothered me most is it didn't continue.

1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:42.160
 It didn't expand. There was no complexity. And there was a hunger that was clear behind that

1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:48.560
 conversation, especially for me. I'd like to understand Marvin Minsky was one of the reasons

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:54.480
 I wanted to come to MIT. He's passed away. But he's one of the key figures in the field that I

1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:02.640
 deeply care about, artificial intelligence. And I thought that his name was dragged

1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:10.640
 through the mud through that situation and without ever being resolved. And so it's unclear to me

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:18.000
 what am I supposed to think about all this? And the only way to come to a conclusion there is to

1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:24.480
 keep talking. It's like the thing we started this conversation with about truth is conversation.

1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:31.440
 So in that sense, I'd love if people on Librex, perhaps in other places, but it seems like Librex

1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:38.160
 is a nice platform to discuss Marvin Minsky, to discuss Jeffrey Epstein, to learn from it,

1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:43.600
 to grow from it, to see how we can make MIT better. Because I'm still one of the people.

1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:49.600
 I've always dreamed of being at MIT. And it was a dream come true in many ways. And I still believe

1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:54.400
 that MIT is one of the most special places in this world, like many other universities.

1:44:54.400 --> 1:45:01.200
 Universities in general is a truly special man. It hurts my heart when people speak poorly

1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:06.960
 of academia. I understand what they mean. They're very correct, but there is much more in my opinion

1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:13.200
 that's beautiful about academia than that's broken. I mean, I don't know if you have something to comment.

1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:18.800
 It doesn't necessarily need to be about Jeffrey Epstein, but there's these difficult things that

1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:26.720
 come up that test the academic community, right? That it feels like conversation is the only way

1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:33.920
 to resolve it. I think people have a natural need for closure. And it's not just, I'm not as plugged

1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:40.160
 into what academics are talking about as you would be lax, but I even... Kiss these days,

1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:47.920
 no respect for Minsky. Exactly. I mean, especially in the AI community, I'm not necessarily a programmer.

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:55.600
 But what I will say is that people come to Librex and we always see a huge spike in users

1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:59.200
 whenever there's like a tragedy on campus or something where people need closure.

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:07.840
 Recently, there was a suicide just the other day on Yale's campus and people were just coming to

1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:16.640
 pay respects and to stay rest in peace and speak also about what might have led to an environment

1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:27.360
 where people are drawn to these terrible results. So just having a conversation is important there,

1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:34.000
 because it brings closure. People need the space, especially when no one wants to go out and put

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:41.360
 their head above, be the longest blade of grass on that one because of the stigma. People need to

1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:47.760
 be able to speak. Yeah, that fear really bothers me, the fear that silence is people, like were

1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:58.960
 they self censor? Were they self silence? Well, you've created an amazing place. I'm kind of

1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:09.200
 interested in your struggle and your journey of creating positive incentives, because it's a problem

1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:16.720
 in a very different domain that I'm also interested in. So I love robotics. I love human robot

1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:22.160
 interaction. And so I believe that most people are good and we can bring out the best in human

1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:27.440
 nature. Social networks is a very tricky space to do that in. So I'm glad you're taking on the problem

1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:34.960
 and I'm glad you have the mission that you do. I hope you succeed. But you mentioned offline that

1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:40.560
 you used to be into chess. Tell me about your journey through chess. Sure. I was a very competitive

1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:45.360
 tournament player growing up till about like 13. I got, for the chess fans, I got through around 2000

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:53.440
 USCF. So I was a competitive player, especially my age group. And that actually led me to poker.

1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:59.680
 I was playing a tournament and what happens is when you're like a very strong 13 year old and

1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:04.080
 you're playing locally, if you want to match, you're going to end up playing a lot of adults. And I

1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:11.120
 ended up playing this mid 40s guy who, we played a really strong game. He actually beat me. I still,

1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:15.040
 I still remember the game and think, oh, I could actually play that move instead of that one.

1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:19.600
 But after, after the game, we had a postmortem. It was this me, I think I was 13 at the time

1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:23.760
 in this 40 year old, like hanging over this chessboard and looking over the moves. And

1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:27.840
 even at that, even at my age, it occurred to me that this guy was absolutely brilliant.

1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:33.040
 And after, after the postmortem, not only by the way in chess, but just like in the way he

1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:37.920
 articulates his thoughts as some people are, um, after the postmortem, I went and looked him up

1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:43.280
 online and I found out that he was a World Series of Poker Champion. And his name is Bill Chen.

1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:44.320
 Oh, wow.

1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:48.400
 And I haven't really kept up with him except one time there was another chess tournament when I was

1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:55.280
 around 14. And I followed him into an elevator as he was leaving the chess hall, like pretending

1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:59.920
 that I was going to go up just because I wanted to, I just wanted to talk to him. And I suggested

1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:03.680
 a sequel or some changes that he could, that I thought he should make for his book. And he was

1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:07.680
 like, actually, I was thinking of doing the same thing, which was incredibly validating to my 14

1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:13.040
 year old or 15 year old self. But I really haven't kept up with him. So it's a shout out to him.

1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:18.240
 But, and then that, he wrote a book called The Mathematics of Poker that I started reading.

1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:23.120
 And that, first of all, kickstarted my interest in game theory and second of all, in poker.

1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:30.560
 So it started from chess and then poker. And I started with Bitcoin poker and had a lot of success

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:37.200
 with that, met a lot of amazing friends, learned a ton about, I mean, I think about entrepreneurship

1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:44.560
 as well as taking risks, reasonable risks, positive expected value risks, and also just growing as a

1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:51.280
 person and mathematician. And what's, did you say Bitcoin poker? Yeah, what's Bitcoin poker?

1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:56.560
 See if you understand, I was 14 years old, right? So how is a 14 year old with wonderful parents

1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:03.360
 who care about him and probably don't want him playing poker, going to start playing poker?

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:07.440
 Because I wanted, I wanted the challenge. I love the challenge. I love the competition.

1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:14.720
 And I realized the answer is probably Bitcoin, because the implications of that. And they had,

1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.400
 they had these free roll tournaments, which for those of you who don't know what free rolls are,

1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:23.440
 there's these promotional tournaments that sites put on where they'll put like a few dollars in.

1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:28.240
 And then thousands of people sign up and the winners get like a dollar. And I started there

1:50:28.240 --> 1:50:34.320
 and I worked my way up. And that's amazing. What's your sense about from that time to today

1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:41.760
 of the growth of the cryptocurrency community? I'm actually having like four or five conversation

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:48.880
 with Bitcoin proponents, Bitcoin maximalists. And like all these, I'm just having all these cryptocurrency

1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:54.720
 conversations currently, because there's so many brilliant, like technically brilliant,

1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:58.640
 but also financially and philosophically brilliant people in those communities.

1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:04.080
 It's fascinating with the explosion of impact, like, and also if you look into the future,

1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:09.200
 the possible revolutionary impact on society in general. But what's your sense about this

1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:14.960
 whole growth of Bitcoin? I'm definitely less knowledgeable on the currency. Again,

1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:20.720
 like programming, it was a means to an end. Yes, right. What I will say is that there was this

1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:27.200
 amazing community that grew out of it. And you'd have people who were willing to stake me or have

1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:35.280
 me be their horse and they're my backer for having never met me for literally full Bitcoin

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:39.520
 tournaments, like full Bitcoin entry fee tournaments. And I get a percentage of the

1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:44.400
 profits and they get a percentage. And to have that level of community for that degree of money,

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:52.560
 I mean, it gives you hope about the potential for humans to act in mutual best interests

1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:57.440
 with a degree of trust. Yeah, there's a really fascinating strong community there.

1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:02.800
 But speaking of like bringing out the best of human nature, it's a community that's currently

1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:10.480
 struggling a little bit in terms of their ability to communicate in a positive inspiring way,

1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:18.480
 like the Bitcoin folks, and we talk about this a lot. I honestly think they have a lot of love

1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:27.600
 in their hearts and minds, but they just kind of naturally, because the world has been like

1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:35.920
 institutions and the centralized powers have been sort of mocking and fighting them for many years

1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:41.680
 that they've become sort of worn down and cynical. And so they tend to be a little bit more aggressive

1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:47.440
 and negative on the internet in the way they communicate, especially on Twitter. And it's

1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:54.240
 just created this whole community of basically being derisive and mocking and trolling and all

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:59.760
 this kind of stuff. But people are trying to, as the Bitcoin community grows, as the cryptocurrency

1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:05.120
 community grows, they're trying to revolutionize that aspect too. So they're trying to find the

1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:12.320
 positive core and grow in that way. So it's fascinating because I think all of us are trying

1:53:12.320 --> 1:53:17.760
 to find the positive aspects of ourselves and trying to learn how to communicate in a positive

1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:21.920
 way online. It's like the internet has been around, social networks haven't been around

1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:26.640
 along. We're trying to, we're trying to figure this thing out. Let me ask you the ridiculous

1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:31.760
 question. I don't know if you have an answer, but who is the greatest chess player of all time

1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:35.360
 in your view? So since you like chess, you talk about it.

1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:40.560
 How you define it. But if you're talking about raw skill, like if you put everyone across time

1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:45.280
 into a tournament together, Carlson would win. I don't think that's particularly controversial.

1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:47.760
 Oh, you mean like with the same exact skill level?

1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:52.560
 Exactly. Magnus Carlson. And is the object, now if you talk about political importance,

1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:58.800
 I think Bobby Fisher is a, you know, he's a, he's the only one that people still,

1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:02.160
 usually go to someone on the street, they know Bobby Fisher because he was, because of what he

1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:08.240
 represented, right? Who do you think is more famous on the street, Gary Kasparov or Bobby Fisher?

1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:12.960
 Bobby in America, Bobby Fisher. Do you think so? Yes. That's interesting. I think we're

1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:16.640
 going to have to put that to the test. Yeah, maybe it's, maybe it's more reflective of the

1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:20.720
 community that I was a part of, but yeah. Also in the community, you're a part of like

1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:25.120
 young minds playing chess. Bobby Fisher was a superstar in terms of like the roots.

1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:32.160
 Yeah, I think so. Because he's American and, you know, he stood up against the big bad Russians

1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:39.840
 at the time. And, you know, unfortunately he had a very bad downfall, but, you know, for our

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:45.680
 geopolitical situation, he meant a lot. And then if you talk about compared to contemporaries,

1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:52.480
 actually, I would say Paul Morphe was a bit of a throwback was, he's one of those geniuses that

1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:58.800
 was just head and shoulders above everyone else. Is there somebody that inspired your own play,

1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.320
 like as a young mind? Yeah, I really like Michael Tall. So like you see you were,

1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:08.960
 I think he was very aggressive, right? Yeah, very tactical. Yeah. Which is funny because I

1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:15.040
 found that I was better at like sort of slow methodical play than quick tactics. But I just,

1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:18.560
 I mean, there's something beautiful about the creativity. And that's something I always latched

1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:23.680
 on to is being a creative player, being a creative person. I mean, chess doesn't really reward

1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:28.640
 creativity as much as a lot of other things, especially entrepreneurial pursuits, which I

1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:35.120
 think is part of the reason why I sort of grew out of it. But I always was attracted to the

1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:41.440
 creativity that I did see in chess. So let me ask the flips. The other, because you said poker,

1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:45.920
 is there somebody that stands out to you as could be the greatest poker player of all time?

1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:51.840
 Like who do you admire in that? That's a more controversial one because

1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:58.240
 these chess players are such like, first of all, there's more an objective standard. And

1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:02.320
 second of all, there's like, they're like almost like cultural figures to me. Whereas

1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:08.880
 poker players are more like live living, they feel more like, yeah, they feel more accessible.

1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:13.840
 But they also have like personalities. Yeah, poker have like fill ID, personality,

1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:19.680
 their vices, they have quirks, they have humor. Like, I guess we've seen videos of them.

1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:26.640
 Because it's such a recent development. I'll say one person who I admire so much. And like,

1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:30.320
 if I could like have a dinner list of people that I want to have dinner with, like,

1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:34.000
 maybe it'll happen now, actually. I would love to have dinner with them.

1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:42.320
 Phil Galfont, who I don't, most people probably won't know. But on this podcast, but the way,

1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:49.280
 first of all, he democratized poker learning in like the mathematical nitty gritty, how do you

1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:55.520
 get good at poker type sense to the entire world. And like an unprecedented way he was,

1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:00.240
 he gave, he had this gift that he had learned and distilled by working with some of the greatest

1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:08.160
 poker minds. And he just democratized it through his website. And I learned a ton from him.

1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:12.800
 And not only that, but you just listen to him think, and it's almost like a philosophical

1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:17.760
 meditation, the way that he breaks things down and thinks about these different elements and

1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:23.360
 has such a holistic thought process. It's like watching a genius work. And, you know,

1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:28.720
 he's also just a nice, fun, sociable guy that like you can, you can imagine being at your

1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.280
 dinner table. Yeah. All that combined. Which is not true for a lot of poker players, right?

1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:39.120
 A lot of them are dark souls. To say the least, yes. I like, I really like the,

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:44.160
 what is it, Canadian, Daniel Negrano. He's also a nice guy. He's also a nice guy, but he's also

1:57:44.160 --> 1:57:49.520
 somebody who's able to express his thoughts about poker really well, but also in an entertaining

1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:55.040
 way. He seems to be able to predict cards better than anybody I've ever seen. Like what,

1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:00.400
 did you watch the challenge? Which challenge? He lost like a million dollars recently to

1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:05.920
 Doug Polk. He lost a million dollars to Doug Polk heads up online. It's really interesting.

1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:17.840
 Yeah. It's awesome to watch these guys work. So I know you're 21. 21. 21. So asking you for advice

1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:26.160
 is a little bit funny, but at the same time, not because you've created a social network.

1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:30.960
 You've created a startup from nothing as we talked about earlier, like without knowing how to

1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:35.360
 program, you've programmed. I mean, you've taken this whole journey that a lot of people I think

1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:41.520
 would be really inspired by. So given that, and given the fact that 20 years from now, you probably

1:58:41.520 --> 1:58:45.680
 laugh at the advice you're going to give now. Absolutely. I hope so. If I don't laugh at the

1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:52.080
 advice I give now, something went desperately wrong, right? Yeah. So do you have advice for

1:58:52.080 --> 1:58:59.360
 people that want to follow in your footsteps and create a startup, whether it's in the software

1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:05.920
 app domain or whether it's anything else? So I'll speak specifically about social media apps.

1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:10.640
 Yes. Try to keep it as narrow as possible so I can laugh as little as possible when I'm 41.

1:59:10.640 --> 1:59:18.800
 Yeah. And what I would say is that if you're a 21, 22 year old who's looking at me and being like,

1:59:19.680 --> 1:59:25.360
 I want to do something like this, what I would say is you probably know better than just about

1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:32.160
 anyone. And if you have a feeling in yourself that this is something that I have to do, and this

1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:36.320
 is something I could imagine myself doing for the next 10 years, because if you're successful,

1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:40.960
 you are going to have to do it for the next 10 years. And through the ups and the downs,

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:46.240
 through the amazing interviews with Lex, and through the not so amazing articles you might have

1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:51.920
 with other people, right? And you're going to have to ride those highs and lows, and you have

1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:56.880
 to believe in what you're doing. But if you have that feeling, what I would say is listen to as

1:59:56.880 --> 2:00:03.760
 few people as possible, because people are experts in domains, but when it comes to what's

2:00:03.760 --> 2:00:11.280
 hot and what makes sense in a social context, you are the authority as a young person who's

2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:17.920
 going through these things and living in your sort of milieu. And I mean, I've talked to

2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:30.480
 at this point, so many experts, so many investors, VCs, you'd be amazed at the advice I've gotten.

2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:36.560
 Advice I've gotten. So there's like a minefield of bad advice. That's the hardest part, I think,

2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:42.800
 for young people. And it's the thing when people, like I help, I help Yellies all the time who ask,

2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:47.440
 like, I never turned down when a founder asked me to have a conversation. I never turn it down.

2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:53.360
 I'm always there for them. And the number one thing I worry about is that at Yale we're taught

2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:59.360
 implicitly and explicitly that you listen to the adult in the room, you listen to the person with

2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:05.840
 the highest, you know, pay grade. And it's devastating because that's how innovation dies.

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:14.560
 Yeah, it's intimidating to like, you talk to VC who probably meets worth a billion dollars.

2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:20.720
 Yeah, billion dollars. And they're going to tell you, you know, all the all the successful startups

2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:26.560
 they helped fund or even just a successful business owner is going to tell you some advice.

2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:33.280
 And it's hard psychologically to think that they might be wrong. Yeah. But you're saying

2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:37.120
 that's the only way you succeed is just listen to yourself because if they knew what they were

2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:43.680
 doing, they would have built it themselves. And what's especially hard is people go, oh,

2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:47.920
 of course, you know, I'll listen to the people's I'll listen to their advice, but I'll know why

2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:52.640
 it's wrong. And then I'll, and I'll do my own thing. And that sounds greatly abstract. But

2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:56.960
 sometimes you can't always even put your finger on why they're wrong. And I think to have the

2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:03.040
 conviction to say, you're wrong, and I can't tell you why, but I still think I'm right.

2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:08.640
 It's a rare thing, especially at like, it's very counterintuitive. And you might even say

2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:14.000
 it's hubris or arrogant. But I think it's necessary because a lot of these things are,

2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:21.120
 they're not things that you can really put into words until you see them in action. Like,

2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:25.200
 a lot of them are kind of happy accidents. Yeah, it's been, it's been tough for me,

2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:31.040
 like as a, as a person who, like, I'm very empathetic. So when people tell me stuff,

2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:38.960
 I kind of want to understand them. And it's been a painful process, especially people close to me.

2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:43.760
 Basically, everything I've done, especially in the recent few years,

2:02:44.640 --> 2:02:47.360
 a lot of people close to me said not to do. Yeah.

2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:55.520
 Yeah. And like, my parents too, that's been a hard one. It's, it's to basically acknowledge to

2:02:55.520 --> 2:03:04.640
 myself that you don't know, like, you, you don't, that everything you're going to say

2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:09.760
 by way of advice for me is not going to be helpful. Like, I love my parents very much.

2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:17.600
 But like, they're just like, they don't get it. And, and as you put it beautifully,

2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:24.800
 it's very difficult to put your finger on exactly why. Because a lot of advice

2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:28.560
 sounds reasonable. That's the worst kind. Yeah.

2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:36.400
 If it, if it sounds really good, that just means it's an earworm. Like, that's like a song

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:40.160
 that you hear on the radio. And then you're like, you're humming it in the car. And it's like,

2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:45.120
 it's the same thing. The more, the better it sounds, the more skeptical.

2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:50.400
 Yeah. Reason is a, is a bad drug. Like, should be very careful. Because like,

2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:58.160
 you know, the things that seem impossible, every, every major innovation, every major business

2:03:58.160 --> 2:04:03.280
 seems impossible at birth. But even not just the impossible things. I think, you know,

2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:10.960
 you look at like love, for example, it's very easy to give advice to sort of point out all the

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:17.040
 ways you can go wrong or marriage, all the divorces that people go through, all the pain of years

2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:22.960
 that you go through the divorce, like the system of marriage, the marriage industrial complex,

2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:28.160
 all the money that's wasted, all those kinds of things. But that advice is useless when you're

2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:34.880
 in love. The point, the point is to just pat the person in the back and say, go get him, kid.

2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:42.160
 Like, what is it? Goodwill hunting and went to see about a girl. Oh, yeah. That's a good movie.

2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:49.280
 I love that movie. But yeah, that, that's, that took me a long time to figure out. I'm still

2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:56.480
 trying to fight through it, but especially when you're young, that's hard. But nothing in life is

2:04:56.480 --> 2:05:02.320
 worth accomplishing is easy. So, but I think it's really interesting to make that connection between

2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:07.920
 like startup advice and like your parents, because it's the exact same sort of mechanism

2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:13.760
 where when you're young, your parents are usually like right, right? And the experts are usually

2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:18.080
 right. And you know, if you listen to them and you follow their orders, you're going to go to

2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:25.360
 a school like Yale. And at a certain point stops making sense. And I've seen my friends at Yale

2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:31.040
 go down paths because they just continued listening to their parents that I know in their heart of

2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:38.720
 hearts is not the right path for them. Yeah, you know what? That's how I see the education system.

2:05:38.720 --> 2:05:46.800
 The whole point is to guide you to a certain point in your life and everybody's point is different.

2:05:46.800 --> 2:05:55.760
 And your task is to at that point, to have a personal revolution and create your own path.

2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:59.520
 But no one tells you that nobody tells you that because they're they want you to keep following

2:05:59.520 --> 2:06:04.720
 the same path as they they're leading you towards like they're not going to say your whole job is

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:11.440
 to eventually rebel. Yeah, that's how that's how rebellion works. You're not supposed to be told.

2:06:11.440 --> 2:06:17.040
 But that is the task they can take you just like you said, and depending who you are, they can

2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:21.760
 take you really far. But at a certain point, you have to rebel that could be getting you know,

2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:27.040
 that could be in your undergrad, that could be high school. So at any point, one thing that I

2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:32.880
 think played a pretty pivotal role and I've never really mentioned this. He might not even know the

2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:38.560
 person about to tell you about in sort of me actually going out and making Librex was that

2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:47.440
 I was taking this graduate level math class my sophomore year. And I met this I met this PhD

2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:54.000
 student who was also in it and had considerable citations and also startup experience. And I

2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:59.440
 think he actually ended up being the CTO of a unicorn later on. I've sort of lost touch with

2:06:59.440 --> 2:07:06.960
 him, but we're still Facebook friends as it is in the 21st century. So and I was in a class and

2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:10.640
 I was telling him I really want to I really want to make this thing, but I have no technical

2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:18.400
 background. And he disguised as a computer genius, he worked under Dan Spielman at Yale. So

2:07:19.200 --> 2:07:24.080
 he's a good guy, right? And we were doing some math together. We were doing something on discrepancy

2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:32.080
 for those who really care about math. So combinatorics. And he just turns to me is like,

2:07:32.080 --> 2:07:36.000
 I think you could do it. Like what do you mean? You think I could do is like, I think you could

2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:43.360
 do it. I was like, really? But I respected this guy so much. His name was young duck. Shout out

2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:48.160
 to young duck. I respect this guy so much that I was like, if young duck says I can do it, and

2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:53.760
 young duck is a legit genius. And he knows, he knows me. Because we were in two classes together

2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:59.120
 and we spent a lot of time together. If he thinks I can do it, then who am I to say I can't do it?

2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:03.680
 Yeah, you know, that's a lesson for mentorship is like,

2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:09.520
 oh, he has no idea probably. Well, he might not even remember that interaction, which is funny.

2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:16.320
 But the point is that when a crazy young kid comes up to you with a crazy dream,

2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:22.800
 you know, every once in a while, you should just pat him in the back and say, I believe in you.

2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:29.040
 Like you can do it. If they look up to you, that means your words have power. And if you say,

2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:37.200
 no, no, come on, be like reasonable, like, you know, finish your schoolwork kind of thing,

2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:41.600
 like that's that's unreasonable to take that leap. Now just finish your education, blah, blah, blah,

2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:47.440
 blah, whatever, whatever the reasonable advice is, every once in a while, maybe often as a mentor,

2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:53.680
 you should say, you know, go see about a girl in California, or whatever the equivalent is.

2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:58.160
 That was my moment. That was my good little hunting moment. It's your good little hunting moment.

2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:07.200
 Man, I miss Robin Williams. I was a special guy. People love it when I ask about book recommendations

2:09:07.200 --> 2:09:11.360
 in general. Of course, your journey is just beginning, but is there something that jumps

2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:18.240
 out to you, technical fiction, philosophical sci fi, coloring books, blog posts you read somewhere

2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:25.280
 that had an impact on your life? Video games. Video games that you recommend to all this

2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:32.080
 Minecraft manual. Manga. I mean, yeah, video, you can mention video games too. If there's

2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:38.720
 something that jumps out to you that just had like an impact. I guess I'll say, I really like the book,

2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:44.640
 The War of Art, which is a book about creative resistance and the creative struggle and what

2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:51.360
 it means to be creative. And part of what I see in this conversation and what you're doing, Lex, is

2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:57.520
 so much of The War of Art's idea is that you just keep writing and writing and writing until you

2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:05.120
 get to the new crap. And you just roll with it, right? And that's sort of what happens when you

2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:10.800
 have like three hour conversations with people is you can only have so much scripted or societally

2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:17.440
 constructed stuff until you get to the real you. And you have to show up. I mean, he's that book,

2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:21.840
 that book is kind of painful. It's really painful. And it's not something I would recommend for every

2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:27.280
 part of it. But for what it did in my life at the time, it also kind of normalized, I don't know,

2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:35.520
 part of my coming of age story is part of it's about realizing that I'm a creative person and

2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:41.760
 person who needs to create. That's sort of a God given thing, I think, for a lot of people.

2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:45.760
 But it's something that I don't really feel like I can live without. And part of it was

2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:50.160
 realizing that even within some of these more rigid structures, it's okay that I don't sort of

2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:55.920
 fit in with them. And to hear about the struggles of other creatives was something for my own

2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:01.360
 self esteem and my own growing up that was really important to me. So I don't think the book itself

2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:06.160
 might be perfect. But for what it did for my life, it was really impactful.

2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:13.440
 Yeah, I think exactly the words may not be exactly right by way of advice. But I think

2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:20.800
 the journey that a lot of creatives take by reading that book is kind of profound. He also

2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:26.800
 has another one called Turning Pro, I think. I mean, he in general espouses like, taking it

2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:32.240
 seriously. If you have a creative mind and you want to create something special in this world,

2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:43.600
 go do it. Don't show up. And so many people would tell me would encourage me either blatantly or

2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:50.800
 through implicit means to basically take the app less seriously. It's a good signal, by the way.

2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:57.440
 It's a good signal because my really close friends, the ones who have always supported me,

2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:01.920
 they never said that because they got it. They understood that that was my path. And

2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:05.920
 they might be skeptical. They might be like, I mean, one of my friends I remember told me,

2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:11.840
 I was always taken aback about why you were so certain this would work out. And he's like,

2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:17.520
 I finally got it once I saw it popping off. But before that, I just didn't get it. But he still

2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:24.080
 supported me. And I think it's a really good signal. And actually, just the fact of going

2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:29.840
 through this process has made me socially feel so much more connected. And I've somewhat consolidated

2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:34.720
 my social life to some degree, but it's so much more vulnerable connected. And that's part of

2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:40.320
 the creative process. I have to thank for that, I think. There's something that's unstoppable

2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:47.760
 about the creative mind. It's right there, that fire. And I guess part of the thing that you're

2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:54.480
 supposed to do is let that fire burn in whichever direction. And it's gonna hurt. Fire will hurt.

2:12:55.360 --> 2:13:01.360
 But on the topic of video games, you mentioned Stanley Parable offline. You said you played

2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:05.760
 some video games. Is there a video game that you especially love that you recommend I play, for

2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:11.600
 example? Yeah, I'll mention. It's actually freely in keeping with what we've been talking about.

2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:17.040
 It's The Beginner's Guide, which is what it was made by the same guy, Davey Rendon, who made

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:22.720
 the Stanley Parable, which I briefly saw you. I just clicked the video and then I went to sleep,

2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:32.960
 it was 2am. But I briefly saw you that you were looking at. And it's a game that is better treated

2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:40.800
 as art. And I think I won't claim to understand the creator because that would be a cardinal sin

2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:48.960
 to me as a creative person. But it gets to the heart of a lot of the things that we've been

2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:55.440
 talking about, which is the creative mind. The game can be interpreted in a lot of ways in a

2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:03.360
 feminist way. It could be interpreted as the story of friends. It could be interpreted as the story

2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:08.160
 of critics versus a creative. The way I like to interpret it, and I don't want to give out a way

2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:16.880
 too much, is the story of the creative part of your mind that creates just for the sake of creating,

2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:25.120
 meaning the part that creates for no rhyme or reason or clear meaning. It's almost ethereal,

2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:32.640
 versus the part that you could call it the editor. You could call it the pragmatist. You could call

2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:39.120
 it the necessary force of ego in our lives. We can't totally be egoless, right? But we need

2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:45.920
 to be egoless to be creative. And how that sort of internal censure, what role does it play? And

2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:53.280
 how do we allow our creative minds to be creative? And yet, how do we still become useful? And it's

2:14:53.280 --> 2:15:00.080
 funny that a video game could have this in. It's a fascinating attention, which reminds me about

2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:09.200
 the ridiculous question every once in a while asked about meaning and death. This whole ride

2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:14.960
 ends. You're at the beginning of the ride, but it could end any day, actually. That's the way

2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:20.160
 human life works. You could die today, you could die tomorrow. Do you think about your

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:27.680
 immortality? Do you think about death? Do you meditate on it? And in that context, as the creative,

2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:34.720
 but a pragmatist too, as running a startup, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:47.760
 Yeah, so on mortality, right? About three years ago, four years ago now, I was excited to go to

2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:54.320
 Yale. I was playing six hours of squash a day, which squash is a sport I love so much. And I was

2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:59.680
 really getting a lot better. And I was even thinking I could maybe walk onto the Yale team.

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:12.400
 And I woke up one day. I felt really, really sick. I went and I decided not to go squash that day.

2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:20.080
 And I know, I wanted to, I almost did. And you'll see how the story turns out. So you'll decide

2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:24.400
 if I made the right choice. I decided not to go squash today. And I decided to get my driver's

2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:28.080
 license, or I had to get my driver's license, because I wanted to get driver's license before

2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:32.480
 I, you know, it's just how young I am before I went off to college, because otherwise I might never

2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:40.160
 get it. And I'm going back and I successfully got my driver's license, brush him. And I go back to

2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:45.680
 my house and I decided I don't want to drive back because I just feel so sick.

2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:50.960
 Like things are spinning. I have the worst headache. I come home, I run back right into my bed

2:16:51.680 --> 2:16:56.240
 and feeling really sick to the point where I even like asked my mom, who is the doctor,

2:16:56.240 --> 2:17:00.160
 I'm like, should I, should I go to the hospital? And she's like, you can just wait it out. I'm

2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:06.800
 sure it'll get better. I like your mom. Yeah. And then, you know, and then at one point I look

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:13.360
 at my arms and they're like covered in this like red splotchy stuff. Yeah. And I'm like, mom, I

2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:18.960
 think, and she's like, yeah, we have to go. And so I go there and they're like, you've scarlet fever

2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:22.880
 and they're like, there's nothing we can do. You should probably just go back home. So I go back

2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:30.240
 home. Six hours later, I wake up in the morning. They'd let me out at like 3am. They let me, I

2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:36.720
 come home in the morning and I feel this like a spear through my chest. And I never felt anything

2:17:36.720 --> 2:17:40.400
 like it. And I was, it was very disconcerting when you have a, because we're all used to

2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:44.880
 different sorts of pain, right? And that was sort of pain I never felt before. I suppose as an

2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:50.560
 athlete, you're used to like, you know, pain. So I tell my parents and immediately we hop back

2:17:50.560 --> 2:17:54.960
 in the car, we go up to the same hospital I was at six hours ago. And they initially didn't want

2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:58.160
 to let me in. And I was like, I have chest pain. They're like, oh, come on. Because they're like,

2:17:58.160 --> 2:18:02.080
 you're a healthy guy. Wait your turn. I'm like, no, you don't understand. I have like a pain in my

2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:07.520
 chest. And then they let me in. They start doing tests on me. They like put something like in my

2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:12.880
 back, which is really scary. It's huge needle. And I'm smiling because it's like one of the ways I

2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:18.960
 reduce stress, I guess, or deal with this sort of thing and make light of it. But like, know that,

2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:25.120
 you know, it's definitely very scary in the moment. Shocking and scary. And they go and they

2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:30.960
 they do a bunch of tests and they determine that a virus like attacked my heart. And I had myocarditis

2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:39.280
 and pericarditis. And they said I had maybe 25 to 35% chance at one point of dying. And so

2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:46.000
 I'm sitting in my they met me in the hospital. I'm in the bed in my bed for about three weeks.

2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:55.360
 And I'm just I'm just standing there. And I had this moment also that I remember very specifically

2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:04.320
 where I was in so much pain that like I was crying not out of like emotional standpoint,

2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:10.320
 but actually just purely out of the pain itself. Like, I could feel my heart in my chest. And when

2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:15.360
 I leaned back, I felt it touch my rib cage and feel horrible. So I couldn't go to sleep and lean

2:19:15.360 --> 2:19:20.400
 back. I had to lean forward all throughout the night. Right. And I'm feeling my and I'm feeling

2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:26.480
 my chest. I'm feeling this terrible pain in my chest. I'm crying, unstoppable. And I mean,

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:30.960
 also, maybe I should mention that at the time, I was someone who'd like refuse to take in anything

2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:36.240
 into my body that wasn't natural. And so a lot of the time I tried to be unmedicated.

2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:43.120
 Eventually, I didn't allow them to add a little medication to my body. But there's just so much

2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:48.240
 uncertainty and pain. And the first time I had to come to terms with mortality.

2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:53.120
 First of all, I think you still should have gone play squash. I mean, come on.

2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:55.600
 I mean, yeah, I thought you're I thought you're serious about this.

2:19:56.880 --> 2:19:59.680
 You still carry that with you. Sort of

2:20:02.800 --> 2:20:07.360
 there is power to realizing the ride can end. Right.

2:20:07.360 --> 2:20:15.280
 In very suddenly, very suddenly. Yeah. And painfully. And, you know, it has

2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:21.040
 pragmatic application to like what you to trajectories you take to life. Right.

2:20:21.040 --> 2:20:28.640
 Something else that is worth noting is that I for the next year couldn't walk to my classes.

2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:36.880
 So I get to yell. They put me in a medical single alone. And I have to get shuttled to all my

2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:40.640
 classes. I have to ask I had to ask a few professors to even move classes so I could

2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:47.520
 actually get there. I can't move my book. I can't lift my book bags. I can't I can't walk upstairs.

2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:56.560
 I spent like 12 hours a day in my dorm room, just like staring at the walls. And more so

2:20:56.560 --> 2:21:07.040
 and more than that, all this like you I got to watch my body like deteriorate and like the muscle

2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:11.520
 like fall off of it because I was I was taking these pills and they're kind of catabolic.

2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:17.360
 And for an 18 year old, I mean, I think every 18 year old has feelings about their body.

2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:23.200
 Man or woman. And, you know, just seeing this it's like you're watching sort of

2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:27.840
 dress death transpire. And you're also very fatigued because your heart's not at

2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:33.120
 peak condition. And you're thinking about the future. And a lot of the things you enjoy have

2:21:33.120 --> 2:21:41.040
 kind of been stripped away from you. And I took a meditation practice, like started with like

2:21:41.040 --> 2:21:47.120
 five minutes a day. At my peak, I was at like 40 minutes a day, kept it up consistently for about

2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:54.080
 two years. And I started thinking about like, what do I want to do? And like, what do I care about?

2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:00.480
 And to get to your point, I think you're asking like, how does this carry forward, right?

2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:08.640
 I think I realized that, you know, there's an end. And I realized that there are things I believe

2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.640
 and things that I believe that might not be so overtly popular, but that I truly think make

2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:21.520
 the world a better place. And in spite of, and basically, if my conditions provided,

2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:27.680
 I wanted to make something that I wanted to do something that would make me feel sort of whole

2:22:27.680 --> 2:22:32.400
 in that way. Yeah, I mean, that's an amazing journey to take that time and to come out on the

2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:38.800
 other end. Now, man, that's amazing. I did not realize like there was a long term struggle.

2:22:38.800 --> 2:22:47.840
 I think that's in the end, if you do succeed, we'll have a profound positive impact because

2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:56.000
 struggle is ultimately like humbling, but also empowering. So I'm glad to see that. But from

2:22:56.000 --> 2:23:00.320
 the perspective of the creator of the other ridiculous question about meaning, do you think

2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:12.240
 about this kind of stuff? Is that the meaning of life for you, the meaning of life for us descendants

2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:17.200
 of Apes in general? The first thing I'd like to say is that I think part of like, when we talk

2:23:17.200 --> 2:23:21.360
 about the meaning of life, the part of it is the fact that we get to struggle with this question

2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:28.960
 and we get to do it together for a long time. And we sometimes, I think it's accepting that

2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:33.840
 there's no meaning at all. And sometimes I think it's accepting that we're even just parsing the

2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:40.320
 phrase and thinking about the meaning of life. I sometimes look, I'm very young. Again, I hope

2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:46.800
 that anything I say now is going to be very different in the future because I think life has

2:23:46.800 --> 2:23:53.280
 so many meanings that it'll be crazy to see what I think in 20 years about the meaning of life.

2:23:53.280 --> 2:24:00.480
 Yeah, rise from the future, cut them some slack. Please do. Perspective, perspective,

2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:06.480
 perspective. Having said that, I think part of what brings meaning to my life is things like

2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:12.000
 this, where we think about these things with people who are really, really, really on the ball

2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:16.720
 and we get to connect with these people. That certainly brings meaning to my life, human connection.

2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:24.960
 Yeah, this conversation is just another echo of the thing you're trying to create in the digital

2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:31.440
 space. That's the same kind of magic. From what I understand about what you're trying to create

2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.320
 is the same reason I fell in love with the long form podcast thing like as a fan.

2:24:36.320 --> 2:24:42.400
 That's why I listen to long form podcasts. Is there something deeply human and genuine

2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:49.520
 about the interchange through the voice? But I do think that connection through text can be

2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:56.240
 even more powerful. I think about letters. I still write letters to Russia. There's

2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:04.160
 something powerful in letters. When you put a lot of yourself in the words you say,

2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:10.560
 in the words you write, that's powerful. You can really communicate not just the actual

2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:18.400
 semantic meaning of the words, but a lot of who you are through those words and create real

2:25:18.400 --> 2:25:27.440
 connections. I hope you succeed there. Listen, Ryan, I think this is an incredible conversation.

2:25:27.440 --> 2:25:33.920
 I'm glad that people like you are fighting the good fight for bringing out the best in human

2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:41.120
 nature in the digital space. I think that's a battleground where the good will win, love will

2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:46.240
 win, and I'm glad you're creating technology that does just that. Thank you so much for wasting

2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:50.960
 all your time for coming down. I can't wait to see what you do in the future. Thanks for talking

2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:56.640
 today. Thank you for having me. Bam. How many finger guns have you gotten at the end of the

2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:04.000
 podcast? Zero. Yeah. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ryan Schiller,

2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:10.720
 and thank you to all our sponsors. All form, magic spoon, better help, and brave. Click their

2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:17.360

2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:26.800
 on March 15th, 1783. If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led

2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:48.320
 like sheep to the slaughter. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
