 The following is a conversation with Bob Langer, professor at MIT and one of the most

00:04.880 --> 00:11.040
 cited researchers in history, specializing in biotechnology fields of drug delivery systems

00:11.040 --> 00:17.520
 and tissue engineering. He has bridged theory and practice by being a key member and driving

00:17.520 --> 00:23.440
 force in launching many successful biotech companies out of MIT. This conversation was

00:23.440 --> 00:28.800
 recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. His research and companies are at

00:28.800 --> 00:34.560
 the forefront of developing treatment for COVID 19, including a promising vaccine candidate.

03:06.240 --> 03:12.400
 You have a bit of a love for magic. Do you see a connection between magic and science?

03:13.040 --> 03:19.520
 I do. I think magic can surprise you. And, you know, and I think science can surprise you. And

03:19.520 --> 03:24.320
 there's something magical about, about science. I mean, making discoveries and things like that.

03:24.320 --> 03:30.080
 Yeah. So on the magic side, is there some kind of engineering scientific process to the tricks

03:30.080 --> 03:37.920
 themselves? Do you see, because there's a duality to it? One is you're the, you're, you're sort of

03:37.920 --> 03:42.960
 the person inside and knows how the whole thing works, how the universe of the magic trick works.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.280
 And then from the outside observer, which is kind of the role of the scientists,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.880
 you, the people that observe the magic trick don't know at least initially anything that's

03:52.880 --> 03:58.160
 going on. Do you see that kind of duality? Well, I think the duality that I see is fascination.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.720
 You know, I think of it, you know, when I watch magic myself, I'm always fascinated by it. Sometimes

04:04.720 --> 04:09.200
 it's a puzzle to think how it's done, but just the sheer fact that something that you never thought

04:09.200 --> 04:14.320
 could happen does happen. And I think about that in science too. You know, sometimes you,

04:15.440 --> 04:21.840
 something that you might dream about and helping to discover maybe you do in some way or form.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.080
 What is the most amazing magic trick you've ever seen?

04:26.080 --> 04:32.720
 Well, there's one I like, which is called the invisible pack. And the way it works is you have

04:32.720 --> 04:40.640
 this pack and you hold it up. Well, first you say to somebody, this is invisible. And this deck,

04:40.640 --> 04:45.440
 and you say, well, shuffle it, they shuffle it, but, you know, they sort of make believe.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.720
 And then you say, okay, I'd like you to pick a card, any card, and show it to me. And you show

04:50.720 --> 04:57.440
 it to me. And I look at it. And let's say it's the three of hearts. I said, well, put it back

04:57.440 --> 05:01.520
 in the deck. But what I'd like you to do is turn it upside down from every other card in the deck.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.720
 So they, they do that imaginary. And I said, do you want to shuffle it again? And they shuffle it.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.840
 And I said, well, so there's still one card upside down from every other card in the deck. I said,

05:11.840 --> 05:16.240
 what is that? And they said, well, three hearts. So it just so happens in my back pocket, I have

05:16.240 --> 05:21.040
 this deck. It's, you know, it's a real deck. I show it to you. And I just open it up. And there's

05:21.040 --> 05:23.920
 just one card upside down. And it's the three of hearts.

05:27.200 --> 05:33.280
 And, and you can do this trick. I can. If I don't, I would have probably brought it.

05:34.800 --> 05:42.320
 All right. Well, beautiful. Let's get into the, into the science. As of today, you have over 295,000

05:42.320 --> 05:49.280
 citation and the H index of 269. You're one of the most cited people in history and the most

05:49.280 --> 05:56.800
 cited engineer in history. And yet nothing great, I think, is ever achieved without failure. So

05:57.680 --> 06:03.520
 the interesting part, what rejected papers, ideas, efforts in your life were most painful

06:03.520 --> 06:08.160
 or had the biggest impact on your life? Well, it's interesting. I mean, I've had plenty of rejection

06:08.160 --> 06:14.400
 too. You know, I, but I suppose one way I think about this is that when I first started, and this

06:14.400 --> 06:20.400
 certainly had an impact both ways, you know, I first started, we made two big discoveries,

06:20.400 --> 06:25.520
 and they were kind of interrelated. I mean, one was I was trying to isolate with my postdoctoral

06:25.520 --> 06:31.040
 advisor, Judah Folkman, substances that could stop blood vessels from growing and nobody'd

06:31.040 --> 06:38.640
 done that before. And so that was part A. Let's say a part B is we had to develop a way to study

06:38.640 --> 06:45.360
 that. And what was critical to study that was to have a way to slowly release those substances

06:45.360 --> 06:51.040
 for, you know, more than a day, you know, maybe months. And that had never been done before either.

06:51.600 --> 06:59.520
 So we published the first one we sent to Nature, the journal, and they rejected it. And then we

06:59.520 --> 07:05.840
 sent it, we revised it, we sent it to Science and they accepted it. And the other, the opposite

07:05.840 --> 07:10.080
 happened. We sent it to Science and they rejected it, and then we sent it to Nature and they accepted

07:10.080 --> 07:14.800
 it. But I have to tell you, when we got the rejections, it was really upsetting. I thought,

07:14.800 --> 07:19.280
 you know, I did some really good work and Dr. Folkman thought we'd done some really good work and,

07:20.640 --> 07:25.600
 and, but it, it was very depressing to, you know, get rejected like that.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.240
 If you can linger on just the feeling or the thought process when you get the rejection,

07:30.240 --> 07:38.400
 especially early on in your career, what, I mean, you don't know. Now people know you as,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.040
 as, as a brilliant scientist. But at the time, I'm sure you're full of self doubt.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.760
 And did you believe that maybe this idea is actually quite terrible, that it could have been

07:51.760 --> 07:57.200
 done much better? Or is it underlying confidence? What was the feelings? Well, you feel depressed,

07:57.200 --> 08:01.840
 you feel depressed. And I felt the same way when I got grants rejected, which I did a lot in the

08:01.840 --> 08:10.240
 beginning. I guess part of me, you know, you have multiple emotions. One is being sad and being upset

08:10.960 --> 08:15.120
 and also being maybe a little bit angry because you didn't feel the reviewers didn't get it.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.240
 But then as I thought about it more, I thought, well, maybe I just didn't explain it well enough.

08:20.240 --> 08:25.760
 And, you know, that you go through stages. So you say, well, okay, I'll explain it better next

08:25.760 --> 08:30.400
 time. And certainly you get reviews. And when you get the reviews, you see what they either didn't

08:30.400 --> 08:34.080
 like or didn't understand. And then you try to incorporate that into your next versions.

08:35.280 --> 08:40.080
 You've given advice to students to do something big, do something that really can change the world

08:40.080 --> 08:46.640
 rather than something incremental. How did you yourself seek out such ideas? Is there a process?

08:46.640 --> 08:50.720
 Is there sort of a rigorous process? Or is it more spontaneous?

08:50.720 --> 08:57.520
 It's more spontaneous. I mean, part of its exposure to things, part of it's seeing other people.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.680
 Like I mentioned, Dr. Folkman, he was my postdoctoral advisor. He was very good at that.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.160
 You could sort of see that he had big ideas. And I certainly met a lot of people who didn't.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.560
 And I think you could spot an idea that might have potential when you see it,

09:10.560 --> 09:13.360
 you know, because it could have very broad implications,

09:13.360 --> 09:22.080
 where's a lot of people might just keep doing derivative stuff. But it's not something that

09:22.080 --> 09:29.520
 I've ever done systematically, I don't think. So in the space of ideas, how many are just,

09:29.520 --> 09:36.960
 when you see them, it's just magic. It's something that you see that could be impactful if you dig

09:36.960 --> 09:44.320
 deeper. Yeah, it's sort of hard to say because there's multiple levels of ideas. One type of

09:44.320 --> 09:51.040
 thing is like a new, you know, creation, like that you could engineer tissues for the first time

09:51.040 --> 09:55.440
 or make tissues from scratch from the first time. But another thing is really just deeply

09:55.440 --> 10:02.480
 understanding something. And that's important too. So, and that may lead to other things.

10:02.480 --> 10:09.120
 So sometimes you could think of a new technology or I thought of a new technology. But other times

10:09.760 --> 10:16.080
 things came from just the process of trying to discover things. So it's never, and you don't

10:16.080 --> 10:22.080
 necessarily know, like people talk about a ha moments, but I don't know if I've, I mean,

10:22.080 --> 10:28.640
 I certainly feel like I've had some ideas that I really like. But it's taken me a long time to go

10:28.640 --> 10:34.880
 from the thought process of starting it to all of a sudden knowing that it might work.

10:35.440 --> 10:41.680
 So if you take drug delivery, for example, is the notion, is the initial notion kind of a very

10:41.680 --> 10:48.880
 general one that we should be able to do something like this? And then you start to ask the questions

10:48.880 --> 10:53.520
 of, well, how would you do it? And then digging and digging and digging? I think that's right.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.440
 I think it depends. I mean, there are many different examples. The example I gave about

10:57.440 --> 11:03.360
 delivering large molecules, which we used to study, these blood vessel inhibitors, I mean,

11:03.360 --> 11:10.480
 there we had to invent something that would do that. But other times it's different. Sometimes

11:10.480 --> 11:16.880
 it's really understanding what goes on in terms of understanding the mechanisms. And so it's not

11:16.880 --> 11:22.480
 a single thing. And there are many different parts to it. Over the years, we've invented

11:22.480 --> 11:28.800
 different, or discovered different principles for aerosols, for delivering genetic therapy

11:28.800 --> 11:34.400
 agents, all kinds of things. So let's explore some of the key ideas you've touched on in your life.

11:35.840 --> 11:41.920
 Let's start with the basics. So first, let me ask, how complicated is the biology and

11:41.920 --> 11:47.360
 chemistry of the human body from the perspective of trying to affect some parts of it in a positive

11:47.360 --> 11:54.240
 way? So that you know, for me, especially coming from the field of computer science and computer

11:54.240 --> 11:59.440
 engineering robotics, it seems that the human body is exceptionally complicated. And how the

11:59.440 --> 12:04.480
 heck you can figure out anything is amazing. Well, I agree with you. I think it's super complicated.

12:04.480 --> 12:09.680
 I mean, we're still just scratching the surface in many ways. But I feel like we have made progress

12:09.680 --> 12:15.760
 in different ways. And some of it's by really understanding things like we were just talking

12:15.760 --> 12:20.720
 about. Other times, you know, you might, or somebody might, we or others might invent

12:20.720 --> 12:26.160
 technologies that might be helpful on exploring that. And I think over many years,

12:26.160 --> 12:29.440
 we've understood things better and better, but we still have such a long ways to go.

12:29.440 --> 12:38.080
 Are there, I mean, if you just look, are there things that, are there knobs that are reliably

12:38.080 --> 12:48.160
 controllable about the human body? So if you start to think about controlling various aspects of,

12:48.880 --> 12:55.040
 when we talk about drug delivery a little bit, but controlling various aspects chemically

12:55.040 --> 13:00.880
 of the human body, is there a solid understanding across the populations of humans that are solid,

13:00.880 --> 13:06.480
 reliable knobs that could be controlled? I think that's hard to do. But on the other hand, whenever

13:06.480 --> 13:11.920
 we make a new drug or medical device, to a certain extent, we're doing that, you know, in a small way,

13:11.920 --> 13:16.560
 what you just said. But I don't know that there, that there are great knobs. I mean,

13:16.560 --> 13:21.440
 and we're learning about those knobs all the time. But if there's a biological pathway or

13:21.440 --> 13:26.800
 something that you can affect or understand, I mean, then that might be such a knob.

13:27.600 --> 13:33.360
 So what is pharmaceutical drug? How do you do it? How do you discover a specific one?

13:33.360 --> 13:36.880
 How do you test it? How do you understand it? How do you ship it?

13:36.880 --> 13:42.720
 Yeah. Well, I'll give you an example, which goes back to what I said before. So when I was doing

13:42.720 --> 13:46.800
 my postdoctoral work with Judah Folkman, we wanted to come up with drugs that would stop

13:46.800 --> 13:52.160
 blood vessels from growing or alternatively make them grow. And actually, people didn't even believe

13:52.160 --> 13:56.000
 that, that those things could happen. But

13:56.000 --> 13:57.840
 Can we pause on that for a second? Sure.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.560
 What is a blood vessel? What does it mean for a blood vessel to grow and shrink? And why is that

14:02.560 --> 14:10.720
 important? Sure. So a blood vessel is could be an artery or vein or a capillary. And it,

14:10.720 --> 14:19.040
 it, you know, provides oxygen, it provides nutrients, gets rid of waste. So, you know,

14:19.040 --> 14:24.000
 to different parts of your body, if you so, so the blood vessels end up being very, very important.

14:25.200 --> 14:31.680
 And, you know, if you have cancer, blood vessels grow into the tumor. And that's part of what

14:31.680 --> 14:37.360
 enables the tumor to get bigger. And that's also part of what enables the tumor to metastasize,

14:37.360 --> 14:42.400
 and which means spread throughout the body and ultimately kill somebody. So that was part of

14:42.400 --> 14:46.560
 what we were trying to do. We tried what we wanted to see if we could find substances that could

14:46.560 --> 14:52.080
 stop that from happening. So first, I mean, there are many steps. First, we had to develop a bio assay

14:52.080 --> 14:57.440
 study blood vessel growth. Again, there wasn't one. That's where we needed the polymer systems

14:57.440 --> 15:04.240
 because the blood vessels grew slowly, took months. So after we had the polymer system,

15:04.240 --> 15:10.000
 and we had the bio assay, then I isolated many different molecules initially from cartilage.

15:11.200 --> 15:17.520
 And almost all of them didn't work. But we were fortunate, we found one, it wasn't purified,

15:17.520 --> 15:24.160
 but we found one that did work. And that paper, that was this paper I mentioned in science in 1976,

15:24.160 --> 15:28.880
 those were really the isolation of some of the very first angiogenesis blood vessel inhibitors.

15:29.920 --> 15:38.480
 There's a lot of words there. So first of all, polymer molecules, big, big molecules. So what

15:38.480 --> 15:45.840
 are polymers? What's bio assay? What is the process of trying to isolate this whole thing,

15:45.840 --> 15:54.880
 simplify it to where you can control and experiment with it? Polymers are like plastics or rubber.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.960
 What were some of the other questions? Sorry, so a polymer is some plastics and rubber, and that

15:58.960 --> 16:04.000
 means something that has structure and that could be useful for what? Well, in this case,

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
 it would be something that could be useful for delivering a molecule for a long time. So it

16:10.000 --> 16:15.440
 could slowly diffuse out of that at a controlled rate to where you wanted it to go. So then you

16:15.440 --> 16:22.640
 would find the ideas that there would be particular blood vessels that you can target, say they're

16:22.640 --> 16:29.360
 connected somehow to a tumor, that you could target and over a long period of time to be able to

16:30.240 --> 16:35.520
 place the polymer there and it'd be delivering a certain kind of chemical. That's correct. I think

16:35.520 --> 16:41.440
 what you said is good. So that it would deliver the molecule or the chemical that would stop the

16:41.440 --> 16:46.400
 blood vessels from growing over a long enough time so that it really could happen. So that was

16:46.400 --> 16:51.920
 sort of what we call the bio assay is the way that we would study that. So sorry, so what is the

16:51.920 --> 16:58.720
 bio assay? Which part is the bio assay? All of it. In other words, the bio assay is the way you study

17:00.160 --> 17:05.040
 blood vessel growth. The blood vessel growth and you can control that somehow with,

17:05.840 --> 17:09.360
 is there an understanding what kind of chemicals could control the growth of a blood vessel? Sure.

17:09.360 --> 17:14.000
 Well, now there is. But then when I started, there wasn't. And that gets to your original

17:14.000 --> 17:19.040
 question. So you go through various steps. We did the first steps. We showed that such molecules

17:19.040 --> 17:25.040
 existed and then we developed techniques for studying them. And we even isolated fractions,

17:25.040 --> 17:30.080
 you know, groups of substances that would do it. But what would happen over the next,

17:31.440 --> 17:35.840
 we did that in 1976, we published that, what would happen over the next 28 years

17:35.840 --> 17:41.920
 is other people would follow in our footsteps. I mean, we tried to do some stuff too. But ultimately,

17:41.920 --> 17:46.480
 to make a new drug takes billions of dollars. So what happened was there were different

17:47.680 --> 17:52.080
 growth factors that people would isolate, sometimes using the techniques that we developed.

17:53.040 --> 17:58.800
 And then they would figure out using some of those techniques ways to stop those growth

17:58.800 --> 18:03.680
 factors and ways to stop the blood vessels from growing. That, like I say, took 28 years,

18:03.680 --> 18:11.200
 it took billions of dollars and worked by many companies like Genotech. But in 2004, 28 years

18:11.200 --> 18:20.160
 after we started, the first one of those, Avastin, got approved by the FDA. And that's become, you

18:20.160 --> 18:24.640
 know, one of the top biotech selling drugs in history. And it's been approved for all kinds of

18:24.640 --> 18:30.000
 cancers and actually for many eye diseases too, where you have abnormal blood vessel growth.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.080
 Matthew. So in general, one of the key ways you can alleviate,

18:37.440 --> 18:42.400
 so what's the hope in terms of tumors associated with cancerous tumors?

18:44.400 --> 18:48.320
 What can you help by being able to control the growth of vessels?

18:48.320 --> 18:54.080
 So if you cut off the blood supply, you cut off the, it's kind of like a war almost, right?

18:54.080 --> 19:00.720
 You, if you have, if the nutrition is going to the tumor and you can cut it off, I mean,

19:00.720 --> 19:05.840
 you starve the tumor and it becomes very small, it may disappear or it's going to be much more

19:05.840 --> 19:12.240
 amenable to other therapies because it is tiny, you know, like, you know, chemotherapy or immunotherapy

19:12.240 --> 19:15.920
 is going to have a much easier time against a small tumor than a big one.

19:15.920 --> 19:22.400
 Is that an obvious idea? I mean, it seems like a very clever strategy in this war

19:22.400 --> 19:28.720
 against cancer. Well, you know, in retrospect, it's an obvious idea, but when Dr. Folkman,

19:28.720 --> 19:33.600
 my boss first proposed it, it wasn't, a lot of people didn't thought he was pretty crazy.

19:34.240 --> 19:40.240
 And so, in what sense, if you could sort of linger on it, when you're thinking about these

19:40.240 --> 19:45.840
 ideas at the time, where you're feeling you're out in the dark, so how much mystery is there

19:45.840 --> 19:50.960
 about the whole thing? How much just blind experimentation, if you can put yourself in

19:50.960 --> 19:56.960
 that mindset from years ago? Yeah, well, there was, I mean, for me, actually, it wasn't just the idea,

19:56.960 --> 20:00.960
 it was that I didn't know a lot of biology or biochemistry, so I certainly felt I was in the

20:00.960 --> 20:07.760
 dark. But I kept trying and I kept trying to learn and I kept plugging, but I mean, a lot of it was

20:07.760 --> 20:14.560
 being in the dark. So the human body is complicated, right? We established this. Quantum mechanics

20:14.560 --> 20:19.120
 in physics is a theory that works incredibly well, but we don't really necessarily understand the

20:19.120 --> 20:25.680
 underlying nature of it. So are drugs the same in that you can, you're ultimately trying to show

20:26.640 --> 20:31.680
 that the thing works to do something that you try to do, but you don't necessarily understand

20:32.560 --> 20:38.000
 the fundamental mechanisms by which it's doing it? It really varies. I think sometimes people do

20:38.000 --> 20:43.840
 know them, because they've figured out pathways and ways to interfere with them. Other times,

20:43.840 --> 20:49.680
 it is shooting in the dark, it really has varied. And sometimes people make serendipitous discoveries

20:49.680 --> 20:55.920
 and they don't even realize what they did. So what is the discovery process for a drug?

20:56.720 --> 21:05.280
 You said a bunch of people are trying to work with this. Is it a kind of mix of serendipitous

21:05.280 --> 21:13.760
 discovery and art? Or is there a systematic science to trying different chemical reactions and how

21:13.760 --> 21:19.520
 they affect whatever you're trying to do, like shrink blood vessels? Yeah, I don't think there's

21:19.520 --> 21:26.320
 a single way to go about something in terms of characterizing the entire drug discovery process.

21:26.320 --> 21:34.320
 If I look at the blood vessel one, yeah, there the first step was to have the kinds of theories

21:34.320 --> 21:38.560
 that Dr. Folkman had. The second step was to have the techniques where you could study blood

21:38.560 --> 21:44.720
 vessel growth for the first time and at least quantitate or semiquantitate it. The third step

21:44.720 --> 21:50.400
 was to find substances that would stop blood vessels from growing. The fourth step was to

21:50.400 --> 21:56.960
 maybe purify those substances. There are many other steps too. I mean, before you have an

21:56.960 --> 22:01.120
 effective drug, you have to show that it's safe. You have to show that it's effective and you start

22:01.120 --> 22:05.200
 with animals. You ultimately go to patients and there are multiple kinds of clinical trials you

22:05.200 --> 22:11.920
 have to do. If you step back, is it amazing to you that we descendants of great apes are able

22:11.920 --> 22:22.560
 to create drugs, chemicals that are able to improve some aspects of our bodies? Or is it

22:23.600 --> 22:26.720
 quite natural that we were able to discover these kinds of things?

22:26.720 --> 22:32.400
 Well, at a high level, it is amazing. I mean, evolution is amazing. The way I look at your

22:32.400 --> 22:37.760
 question, the fact that we have evolved the way we've done, I mean, it's pretty remarkable.

22:38.480 --> 22:43.920
 So let's talk about drug delivery. What are the difficult problems in drug delivery? What is

22:43.920 --> 22:50.480
 drug delivery from starting from your early seminal work in a field to today?

22:50.480 --> 22:57.840
 Well, drug delivery is getting a drug to go where you want it, at the level you want it,

22:57.840 --> 23:02.960
 in a safe way. Some of the big challenges, I mean, there are a lot. I mean, I'd say one is,

23:03.520 --> 23:09.600
 could you target the right cell? Like we talked about cancers or some way to deliver a drug just

23:09.600 --> 23:15.120
 to a cancer cell and no other cell. Another challenge is to get drugs across different

23:15.120 --> 23:21.200
 barriers. Like could you ever give insulin orally or give it passively, transdermally?

23:21.200 --> 23:26.320
 Can you get drugs across the blood brain barrier? I mean, there are lots of big challenges. Can

23:26.320 --> 23:32.240
 you make smart drug delivery systems that might respond to physiologic signals in the body?

23:32.240 --> 23:38.960
 Oh, interesting. So smart, they have some kind of sense, a chemical sensor or is there something

23:38.960 --> 23:42.240
 more than a chemical sensor that's able to respond to something in the body?

23:42.240 --> 23:49.360
 Could be either one. I mean, one example might be if you were diabetic, if you had more,

23:51.280 --> 23:56.000
 got more glucose, could you get more insulin? But that's just an example.

23:56.960 --> 24:02.240
 Is there some way to control the actual mechanism of delivery in response to what the body is doing?

24:02.240 --> 24:07.120
 Yes, there is. I mean, one of the things that we've done is encapsulate what are called beta

24:07.120 --> 24:13.440
 cells. Those are insulin producing cells in a way that they're safe and protected. And then what'll

24:13.440 --> 24:21.760
 happen is glucose will go in and cells will make insulin. And so that's an example.

24:22.880 --> 24:29.840
 So from an AI robotics perspective, how close are these drug delivery systems to

24:29.840 --> 24:34.720
 something like a robot? Or is it totally wrong to think about them as intelligent agents?

24:34.720 --> 24:40.480
 And how much room is there to add that kind of intelligence into these delivery systems,

24:40.480 --> 24:44.480
 perhaps in the future? Yeah, I think it depends on the particular delivery system.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.960
 Of course, one of the things people are concerned about is cost. And if you add a lot of bells

24:48.960 --> 24:54.560
 and whistles to something, it'll cost more. But I mean, we, for example, have made what I'll call

24:54.560 --> 25:01.120
 intelligent microchips where you can send a signal and release drug in response to that signal.

25:01.120 --> 25:06.240
 And I think systems like that microchip someday have the potential to do what you and I were just

25:06.240 --> 25:11.440
 talking about, that there could be a signal like glucose and it could have some instruction to say

25:11.440 --> 25:16.560
 when there's more glucose, deliver more insulin. So do you think it's possible that there could be

25:17.120 --> 25:22.000
 robotic type systems roaming our bodies sort of long term and be able to deliver certain kinds

25:22.000 --> 25:28.400
 of drugs in the future? Do you see that kind of future? Someday. I don't think we're very close

25:28.400 --> 25:33.600
 to it yet. But someday, you know, that that's nanotechnology. And that would mean even miniaturizing

25:33.600 --> 25:38.320
 some of the things that I just discussed. And we're certainly not at that point yet. But someday,

25:38.320 --> 25:44.880
 I expect we will be. So some of it is just the shrinking of the technology. That's a part of it.

25:44.880 --> 25:52.960
 That's one of the things. In general, what role do you see AI sort of there? There's a lot of work

25:52.960 --> 25:59.360
 now with using data to make intelligent, create systems that make intelligent decisions. Do you

25:59.360 --> 26:10.080
 see any of that data driven kind of computing systems having a role in any part of this into the

26:10.080 --> 26:17.920
 delivery drugs, the design of drugs and any part of the chain? I do. I think that AI can be useful

26:17.920 --> 26:23.600
 in a number of parts of the chain. I mean, one, I think if you get a large amount of information,

26:23.600 --> 26:27.920
 you know, say you have some chemical data because you've done high throughput screens.

26:28.880 --> 26:33.920
 And let's I'll just make this up. But let's say I have I'm trying to come up with a drug to treat

26:34.640 --> 26:43.520
 disease X, whatever that disease is. And I have a test for that. And hopefully a fast test. And

26:43.520 --> 26:50.000
 let's say I test 10,000 chemical substances and a couple of work. Most of them don't work. Some

26:50.000 --> 26:54.800
 maybe work a little. But if I had it, if you with the right kind of artificial intelligence,

26:54.800 --> 26:58.880
 maybe you could look at the chemical structures and look at what works and see if there's certain

26:58.880 --> 27:04.320
 commonalities, look at what doesn't work and see what commonalities there are. And then maybe

27:04.320 --> 27:07.600
 use that somehow to predict the next generation of things that you would test.

27:07.600 --> 27:13.840
 As a tangent, what are your thoughts on our society's relationship with pharmaceutical drugs?

27:14.800 --> 27:19.920
 Do we, and perhaps I apologize if this is a philosophical, broader question, but

27:20.480 --> 27:26.320
 do we over rely on them? Do we improperly prescribe them? In what ways is the system working well?

27:26.320 --> 27:33.600
 In what way can it improve? Well, I think, you know, pharmaceutical drugs are really important.

27:33.600 --> 27:40.000
 I mean, the life expectancy and life quality of people over many, many years has increased

27:40.000 --> 27:44.640
 tremendously. And I think that's a really good thing. I think one thing that would also be good

27:44.640 --> 27:49.040
 is if we could extend that more and more to people in the developing world, which is something that

27:49.040 --> 27:55.680
 our lab has been doing with the Gates Foundation are trying to do. So I think ways in which it

27:55.680 --> 28:00.720
 could improve. I mean, if there was some way to reduce costs, you know, that that's certainly

28:00.720 --> 28:05.680
 an issue people are concerned about. If there was some way to help people in poor countries,

28:05.680 --> 28:11.200
 that would also be a good thing. And then, of course, we still need to make better drugs for

28:11.200 --> 28:17.200
 so many diseases. I mean, cancer, diabetes, I mean, we, you know, there's heart disease and

28:17.200 --> 28:21.760
 rare diseases. There are many, many situations where it'd be great if we could do better and help

28:21.760 --> 28:29.360
 more people. Can we talk about another exciting, another exciting space, which is tissue engineering?

28:29.360 --> 28:34.080
 What is tissue engineering or regenerative medicine? Yeah. So that tissue engineering or

28:34.080 --> 28:39.680
 regenerative medicine have to do with building an organ or tissue from scratch. So, you know,

28:39.680 --> 28:47.840
 someday maybe we can build a liver, you know, or make new cartilage and also would enable you to,

28:47.840 --> 28:51.840
 you know, someday create organs on a chip, which people we and others are trying to do,

28:52.400 --> 28:57.760
 which might lead to better drug testing and maybe less testing on animals or people.

28:57.760 --> 29:05.360
 Organs and a chip. That sounds fascinating. So what are the various ways to generate tissue?

29:06.000 --> 29:12.240
 And how do, so, you know, the one is, of course, from stem cells. Is there other methods? What

29:12.240 --> 29:17.280
 are the different possible flavors here? Yeah. Well, I think, I mean, there's multiple components.

29:17.280 --> 29:22.480
 One is having generally some type of scaffold. That's what Jay Vikanti and I started many,

29:22.480 --> 29:28.880
 many years ago. And then on that scaffold, you might put different cell types, which could be a

29:28.880 --> 29:33.600
 cartilage cell, a bone cell, could be a stem cell that might differentiate into different things,

29:33.600 --> 29:38.480
 could be more than one cell. And the scaffold, sorry to interrupt, is kind of like a canvas

29:38.480 --> 29:44.160
 that it's a structure that you can, on which the cells can grow? I think that's a good explanation

29:44.160 --> 29:49.120
 what you just did. I'll have to use that. The canvas, that's good. Yeah. So I think that that's

29:49.120 --> 29:55.040
 fair. You know, when the chip could be such a canvas, could be fibers that are made of plastics

29:55.040 --> 29:59.040
 and that you'd put in the body someday. And when you say chip, do you mean electronic chip?

29:59.600 --> 30:04.720
 Like, not necessarily, it could be though, but it doesn't have to be. It could just be a structure

30:04.720 --> 30:09.920
 that's not, not in vivo, so to speak, that's, you know, that's outside the body.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.960
 So is there, canvas is not a bad word.

30:12.960 --> 30:22.080
 So is there a possibility to weave into the scan as a computational component?

30:22.080 --> 30:29.280
 So if we talk about electronic chip, some, some ability to sense, control some aspect of this

30:29.280 --> 30:34.800
 growth process for the tissue? I would say the answer to that is yes. I think right now people

30:34.800 --> 30:42.800
 are working mostly on, on validating these kinds of chips for saying, well, it does work as a

30:42.800 --> 30:49.360
 effectively or hopefully as just putting something in the body. But I think someday what you suggested,

30:49.360 --> 30:53.440
 you certainly would be possible. So what kind of tissues can we engineer today?

30:53.440 --> 30:58.640
 What, yeah. Yeah. Well, well, so skin's already been made and approved by the FDA.

30:58.640 --> 31:02.320
 There are advanced clinical trials, like what are called phase three trials,

31:03.040 --> 31:09.040
 that are at complete or near completion for making new blood vessels. One of my former

31:09.040 --> 31:16.080
 students, Laura Nicholson, led a lot of that. So that's amazing. So human skin can be grown.

31:16.080 --> 31:22.000
 That's already approved through the entire, the FDA process. So that means what,

31:23.520 --> 31:30.320
 so the one that means you can grow that tissue and do various kinds of experiments in terms of,

31:31.840 --> 31:37.280
 in terms of drugs and so on. But what is that, does that mean that some kind of healing and

31:37.280 --> 31:43.440
 treatment of different conditions for human beings? Yes. I mean, they've been approved now for,

31:43.440 --> 31:47.520
 I mean, different groups have made them, different companies and different professors,

31:47.520 --> 31:52.480
 but they've been approved for burn victims and for patients with diabetic skin ulcers.

31:53.040 --> 32:03.360
 That's amazing. Okay. So skin, what else? Well, at different stages, people are like skin,

32:03.360 --> 32:10.320
 blood vessels. There's clinical trials going now for helping patients hear better, for patients

32:10.320 --> 32:15.680
 that might be paralyzed, for patients that have different eye problems. I mean,

32:16.320 --> 32:21.440
 and different groups have worked on just about everything, new liver, new kidneys. I mean,

32:21.440 --> 32:26.560
 there've been all kinds of work done in this area, some of it's early, but there's certainly a

32:26.560 --> 32:33.280
 lot of activity. What about neural tissue? Yeah. The nervous system and even the brain.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.280
 Well, there have been people out of working on that too. We've done a little bit with that,

32:37.280 --> 32:41.680
 but there are people who've done a lot on neural stem cells. And I know Evan Snyder,

32:41.680 --> 32:46.000
 who's been one of our collaborators on some of our spinal cord works done work like that.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.920
 And there have been other people as well. Is there challenges for the,

32:51.120 --> 32:55.840
 when it is part of the human body, is there challenges to getting the body to accept this

32:55.840 --> 32:59.280
 new tissue that's being generated? How do you solve that kind of challenge?

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
 There can be problems with accepting it. I think maybe in particular, you might mean rejection

33:06.000 --> 33:11.760
 by the body. So there are multiple ways that people are trying to deal with that. One way is,

33:11.760 --> 33:16.400
 which was what we've done and with Dan Anderson, who was one of my former postdocs, and I mentioned

33:16.400 --> 33:24.480
 this a little bit before for a pancreas, is encapsulating the cells. So immune cells or

33:24.480 --> 33:32.400
 antibodies can't get in and attack them. So that's a way to protect them. Other strategies could be

33:32.400 --> 33:37.360
 making the cells non immunogenic, which might be done by different, either techniques, which might

33:37.360 --> 33:42.160
 mask them or using some gene editing approaches. So there are different ways that people are

33:42.160 --> 33:47.440
 trying to do that. And of course, if you use the patient's own cells or cells from a close relative,

33:48.080 --> 33:52.640
 that might be another way and increases the likelihood that they'll get accepted

33:52.640 --> 33:57.600
 if you use the patient's own cells. Yes. And then finally, there's some suppressive drugs,

33:57.600 --> 34:02.800
 which will suppress the immune response. That's right now what's done, say, for liver transplant.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.880
 The fact that this whole thing works just fascinating, at least from my

34:08.080 --> 34:14.800
 outside perspective, will we one day be able to regenerate any organ or part of the human body

34:15.520 --> 34:20.400
 in your view? I mean, it's exciting to think about future possibilities of tissue engineering.

34:20.400 --> 34:26.400
 Do you see some tissues more difficult than others? What are the possibilities here?

34:26.960 --> 34:32.240
 Yeah. Well, of course, I'm an optimist. And I also feel a timeframe, if we're talking about someday,

34:32.240 --> 34:37.040
 someday could be hundreds of years. But I think that yes, someday, I think we will be able to

34:37.040 --> 34:42.640
 regenerate many things. And there are different strategies that one might use. One might use some

34:43.680 --> 34:50.000
 cells themselves. One might use some molecules that might help regenerate the cells. And so I

34:50.000 --> 34:53.920
 think there are different possibilities. What do you think that means for longevity?

34:54.640 --> 35:01.200
 If we look maybe not someday, but 10, 20 years out, the possibilities that tissue

35:01.200 --> 35:06.720
 engineering, the possibilities of the research that you're doing, does it have a significant impact

35:06.720 --> 35:12.720
 on the longevity of human life? I don't know that we'll see a radical increase in longevity,

35:12.720 --> 35:21.040
 but I think that in certain areas, we'll see people live better lives and maybe somewhat longer

35:21.040 --> 35:28.080
 lives. What's the most beautiful scientific idea in bioengineering that you've come across

35:28.080 --> 35:32.160
 in your years of research? I apologize for the romantic.

35:33.360 --> 35:38.560
 No, that's an interesting question. I certainly think what's happening right now with CRISPR is

35:38.560 --> 35:45.280
 a beautiful idea. That certainly wasn't my idea. But I think it's very interesting here

35:45.840 --> 35:53.920
 what people have capitalized on is that there's a mechanism by which bacteria are able to destroy

35:53.920 --> 36:05.680
 viruses. And understanding that leads to machinery to cut and paste genes and fix a cell.

36:05.680 --> 36:14.800
 Do you see a promise for that kind of ability to copy and paste? Like we said,

36:14.800 --> 36:22.160
 the human body is complicated. That seems exceptionally difficult to do.

36:23.120 --> 36:28.000
 I think it is exceptionally difficult to do, but that doesn't mean that it won't be done. There's

36:28.000 --> 36:32.560
 a lot of companies and people trying to do it. And I think in some areas it will be done. Some

36:32.560 --> 36:40.800
 of the ways that you might lower the bar are not just taking, not necessarily doing it directly,

36:40.800 --> 36:47.920
 but you could take a cell that might be useful, but you want to give it some cancer killing

36:47.920 --> 36:52.480
 capabilities, something like what's called a CAR T cell. And that might be a different way of

36:52.480 --> 36:58.320
 somehow making a CAR T cell and maybe making it better. So there might be sort of easier things

36:58.320 --> 37:04.000
 than rather than just fixing the whole body. So the way a lot of things have moved with medicine

37:04.000 --> 37:11.760
 over time is stepwise. So I can see things that might be easier to do than say fix a brain.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.520
 That would be very hard to do, but maybe someday that'll happen too.

37:16.240 --> 37:21.680
 So in terms of stepwise, that's an interesting notion. Do you see that if you look at medicine

37:21.680 --> 37:31.360
 or bioengineering, do you see that there is these big leaps that happen every decade or so or

37:31.360 --> 37:38.240
 some distant period? Or is it a lot of incremental work? Not, I don't mean to reduce

37:38.240 --> 37:46.240
 its impact by saying it's incremental, but is there sort of phase shifts in the science,

37:46.240 --> 37:52.720
 big, big leaps? I think there's both. Every so often a new technique or new technology comes out.

37:54.160 --> 38:00.800
 I mean, genetic engineering was an example. I mentioned CRISPR. I think every so often things

38:00.800 --> 38:08.320
 happen that make a big difference, but still to try to really make progress, make a new drug,

38:08.320 --> 38:12.640
 make a new device, there's a lot of things. I don't know if I'd call them incremental,

38:12.640 --> 38:18.080
 but there's a lot, a lot of work that needs to be done. Absolutely. So you have over,

38:19.440 --> 38:25.200
 numbers could be off, but it's a big amount. You have over 1,100 current or pending patents

38:25.200 --> 38:30.560
 that have been licensed, sublicensed to over 300 companies. What's your view?

38:32.160 --> 38:36.240
 What in your view are the strengths and what are the drawbacks of the patenting process?

38:36.240 --> 38:42.240
 Well, I think for the most part there's strengths. I think that if you didn't have patents,

38:42.960 --> 38:47.680
 especially in medicine, you'd never get the funding that it takes to make a new drug or a

38:47.680 --> 38:52.800
 new device, which according to Tufts, to make a new drug costs over $2 billion right now,

38:53.440 --> 38:58.800
 and nobody would even come close to giving you that money, any of that money, if it weren't for

38:58.800 --> 39:08.720
 the patent system, because then anybody else could do it. That then leads to the negative,

39:08.720 --> 39:14.560
 though. Sometimes somebody does have a very successful drug, and you certainly want to try

39:14.560 --> 39:22.720
 to make it available to everybody. And so the patent system allows it, allowed it to happen in

39:22.720 --> 39:28.560
 the first place, but maybe it'll impede it after a little bit or certainly to some people or to

39:28.560 --> 39:37.120
 some companies once it is out there. What's on the point of the cost? What would you say is the

39:37.120 --> 39:45.120
 most expensive part of the $2 billion of making a drug? Human clinical trials. That is by far the

39:45.120 --> 39:51.680
 most expensive. In terms of money or pain or both? Well, money, but pain goes hard to know.

39:51.680 --> 40:00.080
 I mean, but usually proving that something new is safe and effective in people is almost always

40:00.080 --> 40:05.680
 the biggest expense. Could you linger on that for just a little longer and describe what it takes to

40:05.680 --> 40:12.480
 prove for people that don't know in general what takes to prove that something is effective on

40:12.480 --> 40:21.280
 humans? Well, you'd have to take a particular disease, but the process is you start out with

40:21.280 --> 40:25.200
 usually you start out with cells, then you'd go to animal models. Usually you have to do a couple

40:25.200 --> 40:30.000
 animal models. And of course, the animal models aren't perfect for humans. And then you have to

40:30.000 --> 40:35.120
 do three sets of clinical trials at the minimum, a phase one trial to show that it's safe in small

40:35.120 --> 40:39.760
 number of patients, a phase two trial to show that it's effective in a small number of patients,

40:39.760 --> 40:44.480
 and a phase three trial to show that it's safe and effective in a large number of patients.

40:44.480 --> 40:51.120
 And, you know, that could end up being hundreds or thousands of patients. And they have to be

40:51.120 --> 40:55.840
 really carefully controlled studies. And, you know, you'd have to manufacture the drug. You'd

40:55.840 --> 41:02.160
 have to, you know, really watch those patients. You have to be very concerned, you know, that

41:02.160 --> 41:08.240
 it is going to be safe. And then you look at, see, does it treat the disease better than

41:08.240 --> 41:12.800
 whatever the gold standard was before that, assuming there was one?

41:12.800 --> 41:17.520
 That's a really interesting line. Show that it's safe first, and then that it's effective.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.360
 First do no harm.

41:19.360 --> 41:26.240
 First do no harm. That's right. So how, again, if you can linger it a little bit,

41:26.240 --> 41:28.080
 how does the patenting process work?

41:29.200 --> 41:34.400
 Yeah, well, you do a certain amount of research. Though that's not necessarily,

41:34.400 --> 41:38.960
 has to be the case. But for us, usually it is. Usually we do a certain amount of research

41:38.960 --> 41:46.480
 and make some findings. And, you know, we had a hypothesis, let's say we prove it,

41:46.480 --> 41:51.440
 or we make some discovery, we invent some technique. And then we write something up,

41:51.440 --> 41:56.800
 what's called a disclosure. We give it to MIT's Technology Transfer Office. They then give it

41:56.800 --> 42:02.960
 to some patent attorneys, and they use that and plus talking to us and, you know, work on writing

42:02.960 --> 42:08.960
 a patent. And then you go back and forth with the USPTO, that's the United States Patent and

42:08.960 --> 42:14.400
 Trademark Office. And, you know, they may not allow it the first, second, or third time,

42:14.400 --> 42:19.920
 but they will tell you why they don't. And you may adjust it, and maybe you'll eventually get it,

42:19.920 --> 42:20.560
 and maybe you won't.

42:21.360 --> 42:28.400
 So you've been part of launching 40 companies. Together worth, again, numbers could be outdated,

42:28.400 --> 42:36.880
 but an estimated $23 billion. You've described your thoughts on a formula for startup success.

42:36.880 --> 42:42.000
 So perhaps you can describe that formula, and in general describe what does it take to build a

42:42.000 --> 42:43.040
 successful startup?

42:44.160 --> 42:48.560
 Well, I'd break that down into a couple of categories. And I'm a scientist, and certainly

42:48.560 --> 42:53.920
 from the science standpoint, I'll go over that. But I actually think that really the most important

42:53.920 --> 42:59.840
 thing is probably the business people that I work with. And, you know, when I look back at the

42:59.840 --> 43:04.400
 companies that have done well, it's been because we've had great business people. And when they

43:04.400 --> 43:09.200
 haven't done as well, we have it as good business people. But from a science standpoint, I think

43:09.200 --> 43:15.440
 about that we've made some kind of discovery that is almost what I'd call a platform, that you

43:15.440 --> 43:20.800
 could use it for different things. And certainly the drug delivery system example that I gave

43:20.800 --> 43:25.440
 earlier is a good example of that. You could use it for drug A, B, C, D, E, and so forth.

43:27.040 --> 43:32.320
 And that I'd like to think that we've taken it far enough so that we've written at least one

43:32.320 --> 43:38.240
 really good paper in a top journal, hopefully a number, that we've reduced it to practice in

43:38.240 --> 43:47.040
 animal models, that we've filed patents, maybe had issued patents that have what I'll call very

43:47.040 --> 43:53.040
 good and broad claims. That's sort of the key in a patent. And then in our case, a lot of times

43:53.040 --> 43:59.280
 when we've done it, a lot of times it's somebody in the lab, like a postdoc or graduate student,

43:59.280 --> 44:03.760
 that spent a big part of their life doing it and that they want to work at that company because

44:03.760 --> 44:07.600
 they have this passion that they want to see something they did make a difference in people's

44:07.600 --> 44:15.600
 lives. Maybe you can mention the business component. It's funny to hear great side to say that there's

44:15.600 --> 44:25.120
 value to business folks. That's not always said. So what value, what business instinct is valuable

44:25.120 --> 44:32.640
 to make a startup successful, a company successful? I think the business aspects are, you have to

44:33.680 --> 44:39.840
 be a good judge of people so that you hire the right people. You have to be strategic so you

44:39.840 --> 44:43.440
 figure out if you do have that platform that could be used for all these different things.

44:43.440 --> 44:48.800
 And knowing that medical research is so expensive, what thing are you going to do first,

44:48.800 --> 44:55.120
 second, third, fourth, and fifth? I think you need to have a good, what I'll call FDA regulatory

44:55.120 --> 45:02.080
 clinical trial strategy. I think you have to be able to raise money credibly. So there are a lot

45:02.080 --> 45:07.040
 of things. You have to be good with people, good manager of people. So the money and the people

45:07.040 --> 45:14.240
 part I get, but the stuff before, in terms of deciding the ABCD, if you have a platform which

45:14.240 --> 45:20.560
 drugs the first and take a testing, you see nevertheless, scientists as not being always

45:20.560 --> 45:26.320
 too good at that process. Well, I think they're a part of the process, but I'd say there's probably,

45:26.320 --> 45:32.000
 I'm going to just make this up, but maybe six or seven criteria that you want to use and that's

45:32.000 --> 45:37.200
 not just science. I mean, the kinds of things that I would think about is the market big or small.

45:39.120 --> 45:44.000
 Are there good animal models for it so that you could test it and it wouldn't take 50 years?

45:45.440 --> 45:52.240
 Are there clinical trials that could be set up, ones that have clear endpoints where you could

45:52.240 --> 45:59.840
 make a judgment and another issue would be competition. Are there other ways that some

45:59.840 --> 46:07.360
 companies out there are doing it? Another issue would be reimbursement. Can it get reimbursed?

46:07.360 --> 46:12.560
 So a lot of things that you have manufacturing issues you'd want to consider. So I think there

46:12.560 --> 46:17.200
 are really a lot of things that go into what you do first, second, third or fourth.

46:19.120 --> 46:26.880
 So you lead one of the largest academic labs in the world with over $10 million in annual grants

46:26.880 --> 46:30.880
 and over a hundred researchers, probably over a thousand since the lab's beginning.

46:32.960 --> 46:39.760
 Researchers can be individualistic and eccentric. How do I put it nicely? There you go, eccentric.

46:39.760 --> 46:45.200
 So what insights into research leadership can you give having to run such a successful lab

46:45.200 --> 46:52.240
 with so much diverse talent? Well, I don't know that I'm any expert. I think that what you do,

46:52.240 --> 46:57.200
 to me, I mean, I just want, I mean, it's going to sound very simplistic, but I just want people

46:57.200 --> 47:03.200
 in the lab to be happy to be doing things that I hope will make the world a better place to

47:03.200 --> 47:08.400
 be working on science that can make the world a better place. And I guess my feeling is if

47:08.400 --> 47:16.400
 we're able to do that, it kind of runs itself. So how do you make a researcher happy in general?

47:16.400 --> 47:22.240
 What I think when people feel, I mean, this is going to sound like, again, simplistic or maybe

47:22.240 --> 47:26.720
 like motherhood and apple pie, but I think if people feel they're working on something really

47:26.720 --> 47:31.520
 important that can affect many other people's lives and they're making some progress,

47:32.480 --> 47:36.000
 they'll feel good about it and they'll feel good about themselves and they'll be happy.

47:37.120 --> 47:43.840
 But through brainstorming and so on, what's your role and how difficult it is as a group

47:43.840 --> 47:50.480
 in this collaboration to arrive at these big questions that might have impact?

47:51.040 --> 47:55.920
 Well, the big questions come from many different ways. Sometimes it's trying to

47:55.920 --> 48:00.240
 things that I might think of or somebody in the lab might think of, which could be a new

48:00.240 --> 48:05.520
 technique or to understand something better. But gee, we've had people like Bill Gates and

48:05.520 --> 48:10.080
 the Gates Foundation come to us and Juvenile Diabetes Foundation come to us and say,

48:10.080 --> 48:15.200
 gee, could you help us on these things? And I mean, that's good too. It doesn't happen just one way.

48:16.800 --> 48:23.760
 And I mean, you've kind of mentioned it, happiness, but is there something more,

48:24.560 --> 48:30.000
 how do you inspire a researcher to do the best work of their life? So you mentioned passion

48:30.720 --> 48:36.080
 and passion is a kind of fire. Do you see yourself having a role to keep that fire going to

48:36.080 --> 48:42.960
 to build it up, to inspire the researchers through the pretty difficult process of

48:43.600 --> 48:48.800
 going from idea to big question to big answer?

48:49.920 --> 48:58.080
 I think so. I think I try to do that by talking to people, going over their ideas and their progress.

48:58.080 --> 49:05.200
 I try to do it as an individual. Certainly when I talk about my own career, I had my setbacks as

49:06.080 --> 49:14.320
 different times and people know that, that know me. And you just try to keep pushing and so forth.

49:14.320 --> 49:20.000
 But yeah, I think I try to do that as the one who leads the lab.

49:20.800 --> 49:25.680
 So you have this exceptionally successful lab and one of the great institutions in the world,

49:25.680 --> 49:34.320
 MIT, and yet sort of, at least in my neck of the woods and computer science and artificial

49:34.320 --> 49:42.960
 intelligence, a lot of the research is kind of a lot of the great researchers, not everyone,

49:42.960 --> 49:48.800
 but some are kind of going to industry. A lot of the research is moving to industry.

49:49.520 --> 49:55.280
 What do you think about the future of science in general? Is there drawbacks? Is there strength to

49:55.280 --> 50:02.560
 the academic environment that you hope will persist? How does it need to change? What needs

50:02.560 --> 50:07.040
 to stay the same? What are your just thoughts on this whole landscape of science and its future?

50:07.840 --> 50:11.840
 Well, first, I think going to industry is good, but I think being in academia is good.

50:12.800 --> 50:17.760
 I have lots of students who've done both and they've had great careers doing both.

50:18.400 --> 50:24.000
 I think from an academic standpoint, the biggest concern probably that people feel today

50:24.000 --> 50:30.800
 at a place like MIT or other research heavy institutions is going to be funding and particular

50:30.800 --> 50:37.760
 funding that's not super directed so that you can do basic research. I think that's probably

50:37.760 --> 50:44.480
 the number one thing, but it would be great if we as a society could come up with better ways

50:44.480 --> 50:51.680
 to teach so that people all over could learn better. So I think there are a number of things

50:51.680 --> 50:58.720
 that would be good to be able to do better. So again, you're very successful in terms of funding,

50:58.720 --> 51:05.840
 but do you still feel the pressure of that, of having to seek funding? Does it affect the science

51:05.840 --> 51:12.480
 or is it or can you simply focus on doing the best work of your life and the funding comes

51:12.480 --> 51:18.320
 along with that? I'd say the last 10 or 15 years, we've done pretty well funding,

51:18.320 --> 51:24.800
 but I always worry about it. You know, it's like you're still operating on more soft money than

51:24.800 --> 51:33.200
 hard and so I always worry about it, but we've been fortunate that places have come to us like

51:33.200 --> 51:38.720
 the Gates Foundation and others, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, some companies and they're willing

51:38.720 --> 51:43.680
 to give us funding and we've gotten government money as well. We have a number of NIH grants and

51:43.680 --> 51:51.920
 I've always had that and that's important to me too. So I worry about it, but I just view

51:51.920 --> 51:56.080
 that as a part of the process. Now, if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist,

51:57.280 --> 52:04.320
 like say I gave you $100 billion right now, but you couldn't spend it on your own research.

52:04.320 --> 52:14.640
 So how hard is it to decide which labs to invest in, which ideas, which problems,

52:14.640 --> 52:23.040
 which solutions? Because funding is so much such an important part of progression of science in

52:23.040 --> 52:27.440
 today's society. So if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist, how hard is that problem?

52:27.440 --> 52:31.840
 How would you go about solving it? Sure. Well, I think what I do, the first thing

52:31.840 --> 52:36.400
 is different philanthropists have different visions. And I think the first thing is to

52:36.400 --> 52:40.960
 form a concrete vision of what you want. Some people, I mean, I'll just give you two examples

52:40.960 --> 52:48.080
 of people that I know. David Koch was very interested in cancer research and part of that

52:48.080 --> 52:55.280
 was that he had cancer and prostate cancer and a number of people do that along those lines.

52:55.280 --> 52:59.200
 They've had somebody, they've either had cancer themselves or somebody they loved

52:59.200 --> 53:04.080
 had cancer and they want to put money into cancer research. Bill Gates, on the other hand,

53:04.080 --> 53:08.480
 I think when he had got his fortune, I mean, he thought about it and felt, well,

53:08.480 --> 53:13.120
 how could he have the greatest impact? And he thought about helping people in the developing

53:13.120 --> 53:19.520
 world and medicines and different things like that, like vaccines that might be really helpful

53:19.520 --> 53:24.720
 for people in the developing world. And so I think first you start out with that vision.

53:24.720 --> 53:31.120
 And once you start out with that vision, whatever vision it is, then I think you'd try to

53:32.560 --> 53:38.640
 ask the question, who in the world does the best work if that was your goal? I mean,

53:38.640 --> 53:43.520
 but you really, I think, have to have a defined vision. Vision first. Yeah, that comes and I

53:43.520 --> 53:48.640
 think that's what people do. I mean, I have never seen anybody do it otherwise. I mean,

53:48.640 --> 53:54.400
 and that, by the way, may not be the best thing overall. I mean, I think it's good

53:54.400 --> 53:59.280
 that all those things happen. But what you really want to do, and I'll make a contrast in a second,

54:00.240 --> 54:06.800
 in addition to funding important areas, like what both of those people did is to help young people.

54:07.680 --> 54:13.760
 And that they may be at odds with each other because a farm or a lab like ours, which is

54:13.760 --> 54:20.480
 a molder, might be very good at addressing some of those kinds of problems. But I'm not young.

54:20.480 --> 54:24.960
 I train a lot of people who are young, but it's not the same as helping somebody use an assistant

54:24.960 --> 54:32.640
 professor someplace. So I think what's I think been good about our thing, our society or things

54:32.640 --> 54:37.680
 overall, or that there are people who come at it from different ways. And the combination,

54:37.680 --> 54:44.320
 the confluence of the government funding, the certain foundations that that fund things and

54:44.320 --> 54:50.960
 other foundations that you don't want to see disease treated, well, then they can go seek out

54:50.960 --> 54:56.880
 people or they can put a request for proposals and see who does the best. I'd say both David Koch

54:56.880 --> 55:03.120
 and Bill Gates did exactly that. They sought out people, both of them, or their foundations that

55:03.120 --> 55:09.920
 they were involved in, sought out people like myself. But they also had requests for proposals.

55:09.920 --> 55:15.920
 You mentioned young people and that reminds me of something you said in an interview of

55:15.920 --> 55:22.960
 written somewhere that said some of your initial struggles in terms of finding

55:24.320 --> 55:32.000
 a faculty position or so on that you didn't quite for people fit into a particular bucket,

55:32.000 --> 55:41.920
 a particular right. Can you speak to that? How do you see limitations to the academic system that

55:41.920 --> 55:55.200
 it does have such buckets? Is there how can we allow for people who are brilliant, but outside

55:55.200 --> 56:01.200
 the disciplines of the previous decade? Yeah, well, I think that's a great question.

56:01.200 --> 56:07.760
 I think the department has to have a vision, and some of them do. Every so often,

56:09.280 --> 56:18.080
 there are institutes or labs that do that. I mean, at MIT, I think that's done sometimes. I know

56:18.080 --> 56:25.680
 Mechanical Engineering Department just had a search and they hired Geo Traverso, who was a

56:25.680 --> 56:32.960
 fellow with me, but he's actually a molecular biologist and a gastroenterologist, and he's

56:32.960 --> 56:37.200
 one of the best in the world. But he's also done some great mechanical engineering and

56:37.200 --> 56:43.440
 designing some new pills and things like that, and they picked him. Boy, I give them a lot of

56:43.440 --> 56:50.000
 credit. I mean, that's vision to pick somebody, and I think they'll be the richer for. I think

56:50.000 --> 56:56.240
 the Media Lab has certainly hired people like Ed Boyden and others who have done very different

56:56.240 --> 57:02.720
 things, and so I think that that's part of the vision of the leadership who do things like that.

57:03.360 --> 57:09.040
 Do you think one day, you've mentioned David Koch in cancer, do you think one day we'll cure

57:09.040 --> 57:14.160
 cancer? Yeah, I mean, it goes one day. I don't know how long that day will come.

57:14.160 --> 57:17.360
 Soon. Yeah, soon, no, but I think.

57:17.360 --> 57:21.680
 So you think it is a grand challenge. It is a grand challenge. It's not just solvable within a

57:21.680 --> 57:26.720
 few years. I don't think very many things are solvable in a few years. There's some good ideas

57:26.720 --> 57:30.720
 that people are working on, but I mean, all cancers, that's pretty tough.

57:32.080 --> 57:37.120
 If we do get the cure, what will the cure look like? Do you think which mechanisms,

57:37.120 --> 57:42.480
 which disciplines will help us arrive at that cure from all the amazing work you've done

57:42.480 --> 57:46.720
 that has touched on cancer? No, I think it'll be a combination of biology and engineering.

57:46.720 --> 57:53.920
 I think it'll be biology to understand the right genetic mechanisms to solve this problem,

57:53.920 --> 57:59.360
 and maybe the right immunological mechanisms and engineering in the sense of producing the

57:59.360 --> 58:04.240
 molecules, developing the right delivery systems, targeting it, or whatever else needs to be done.

58:05.520 --> 58:11.200
 Well, that's a beautiful vision for engineering. So on a lighter topic, I've read that you love

58:11.200 --> 58:18.560
 chocolate and mentioned two places, Ben and Bill's Chocolate Emporium and the Chocolate Cookies,

58:18.560 --> 58:25.280
 the Soho Globs from Rosie's Bag Curing Chestnut Hill. I went to their website and I was trying

58:25.280 --> 58:31.520
 to finish a paper last night. There's a deadline today, and yet I was wasting way too much time

58:31.520 --> 58:36.960
 at 3 a.m. instead of writing the paper, staring at the Rosie Baker's Cookies, which were just

58:36.960 --> 58:43.840
 look incredible. Soho Globs is look incredible. But for me, oatmeal, white raisin cookies

58:43.840 --> 58:48.320
 won my heart just from the pictures. Do you think one day we'll be able to engineer

58:48.880 --> 58:54.640
 the perfect cookie with the help of chemistry and maybe a bit of data driven artificial

58:54.640 --> 59:02.880
 intelligence or is cookies something that's more art than engineering? I think there's

59:02.880 --> 59:09.120
 some of both. I think engineering will probably help someday. What about chocolate? Same thing,

59:09.120 --> 59:14.560
 same thing. You'd have to go to see some of David Edwards stuff. He was one of my postdocs,

59:14.560 --> 59:20.400
 and he's a professor at Harvard, but he also started Cafe Art Sciences, and there's a really

59:20.400 --> 59:28.560
 cool restaurant around here. But he also has companies that do ways of looking at fragrances

59:28.560 --> 59:35.360
 and trying to use engineering in new ways. That's just an example, but I expect someday that

59:36.240 --> 59:39.760
 AI and engineering will play a role in almost everything.

59:40.880 --> 59:43.280
 Including creating the perfect cookie? Yes.

59:43.280 --> 59:49.040
 Well, I dream of that day as well. When you look back at your life, having accomplished an incredible

59:49.040 --> 59:55.120
 amount of positive impact on the world through science and engineering, what are you most proud

59:55.120 --> 1:00:01.760
 of? My students, I really feel when I look at that, we've probably had close to a thousand

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:08.560
 students go through the lab. They've done incredibly well. I think 18 are in the National

1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:15.200
 Academy of Engineering, 16 in the National Academy of Medicine. They've been CEOs of companies,

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:21.840
 presidents of universities, and they've done, I think, eight are faculty at MIT, maybe about 12

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:28.640
 at Harvard. It really makes you feel good to think that the people, they're not my children,

1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:33.680
 but they're close to my children in a way, and it makes you feel really good to see them have

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:39.440
 such great lives and them do so much good and be happy. Well, I think that's a perfect way to end

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:43.760
 it, Bob. Thank you so much for talking. My pleasure. It was an honor. Good questions. Thank you.

1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:33.680
 from Bill Bryson in his book, A Short History of Nearly Everything. This book has a lesson,

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:40.880
 is that we're awfully lucky to be here. And by we, I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of

1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.400
 life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans, we're doubly lucky,

1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:52.240
 of course. We enjoy not only the privilege of existence, but also the singular ability to

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:59.520
 appreciate it, and even in a multitude of ways to make it better. It is talent we have only barely

1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:17.440
 begun to grasp. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
