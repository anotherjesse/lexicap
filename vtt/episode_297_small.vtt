WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
 We have two tubes that are right next to each other

00:02.440 --> 00:03.280
 in the throat.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.600
 One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,

00:06.600 --> 00:08.320
 whatever you're gonna swallow.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.480
 All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,

00:10.480 --> 00:12.640
 the food tube and end up in the stomach.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.640
 And right next to the esophagus, millimeters away

00:15.640 --> 00:17.520
 is the windpipe or the trachea,

00:17.520 --> 00:19.040
 which goes down to the lungs.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.640
 Throat, heart, feces, genitals.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.920
 Every organ from moment to moment keeps us alive

00:24.920 --> 00:26.000
 and ensures our survival.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.920
 The genitals are in a way the opposite.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.460
 How would you improve the penis and the vagina?

00:33.920 --> 00:36.640
 The following is a conversation with Jonathan Reisman,

00:36.640 --> 00:40.040
 a physician and writer of The Unseen Body,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.600
 a doctor's journey through the hidden wonders

00:42.600 --> 00:44.160
 of human anatomy.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.640
 He has practiced medicine in some of the world's

00:46.640 --> 00:49.720
 most remote places, including the Alaskan

00:49.720 --> 00:52.840
 and Russian Arctic Antarctica

00:52.840 --> 00:56.560
 and the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.740
 This is the Let's Freedmen podcast.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:00.960 --> 01:02.320
 in the description.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.880
 And now, dear friends, here's Jonathan Reisman.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.520
 You wrote a book called Unseen Body,

01:09.520 --> 01:12.160
 all about the human body, the messy, the weird,

01:12.160 --> 01:14.840
 the beautiful and the fascinating details.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.280
 So, from an evolutionary perspective,

01:18.280 --> 01:21.880
 are most parts of the human body a feature or a bug?

01:21.880 --> 01:24.240
 Is it like the optimal solution

01:24.240 --> 01:26.280
 or just a duct tape solution?

01:26.280 --> 01:27.120
 Great question.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.440
 I think that most of the time,

01:29.440 --> 01:32.400
 the way the body works is the best solution.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.620
 I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare.

01:35.620 --> 01:38.200
 But I think there's some parts of the body

01:38.200 --> 01:40.400
 that make more sense than others.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.800
 The way our hands work, for instance,

01:43.800 --> 01:45.280
 the muscles are up in the forearm

01:45.280 --> 01:47.000
 and then the tendons kind of come down,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.880
 like strings on a puppet.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.720
 And just the dexterity it gives our hands

01:50.720 --> 01:52.600
 is just really amazing.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.320
 And it's hard to imagine a better tool

01:55.320 --> 01:56.840
 than the human hand to do everything

01:56.840 --> 01:59.720
 from hold things to play piano

01:59.720 --> 02:02.520
 and do a million other daily activities that we do.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.040
 One thing I talk about in the book,

02:05.040 --> 02:06.240
 there's some other body parts

02:06.240 --> 02:10.200
 that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant design,

02:10.200 --> 02:15.200
 such as the throat, where the food, drink are swallowed

02:15.200 --> 02:17.760
 and air is inhaled and those two paths

02:17.760 --> 02:19.840
 come within millimeters of each other.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.520
 And you slip up once, you laugh while eating,

02:22.520 --> 02:26.360
 or you speak while trying to swallow and you die from choking.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.280
 So it seems less than optimal,

02:28.280 --> 02:30.000
 though I'm not sure it could be better

02:30.000 --> 02:32.960
 from the way we're kind of formed in the womb

02:32.960 --> 02:35.800
 as a beginning as this tiny little tube.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.640
 I don't think it could have been done any better

02:37.640 --> 02:39.040
 or there's any other way to do it,

02:39.040 --> 02:40.400
 but it is an unfortunate thing

02:40.400 --> 02:42.920
 that does lead to some problems.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.360
 So the hand, if I could just link on that for a second.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.360
 You talk about the wisdom of a design in the book.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.280
 What are the important things about the hand?

02:52.280 --> 02:55.200
 It seems like very useful for many things

02:55.200 --> 02:57.360
 and it seems to be quite effective.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.960
 A lot of people think the thumb is foundational

03:00.960 --> 03:05.520
 to the human civilization.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.160
 Is there any truth to that?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.000
 I think that is true.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.200
 Actually, one of the ways in which the importance

03:10.200 --> 03:13.240
 of individual fingers comes to attention

03:13.240 --> 03:15.720
 is when people have severe injuries to their fingers.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.080
 For instance, I have a story in the book about a guy

03:19.080 --> 03:23.120
 whose thumb is nearly ripped off by his dog's leash.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.000
 And when plastic surgeons who are often the ones

03:27.000 --> 03:29.640
 to repair that, sometimes it's orthopedic surgeons,

03:29.640 --> 03:33.920
 they will debate how important is it to save this finger

03:33.920 --> 03:36.040
 or how important is it to save,

03:36.040 --> 03:41.040
 let's say the kind of tip one third of one of your fingers.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.120
 It depends on the length that you'll lose.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.720
 It depends on which finger.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.960
 And so the thumb really is the most crucial

03:47.960 --> 03:50.640
 just for your occupation in most cases

03:50.640 --> 03:54.120
 to just daily life and your ability to get around

03:54.120 --> 03:55.240
 and take care of yourself and others.

03:55.240 --> 03:58.920
 So they'll be more, they're willing to go further,

03:58.920 --> 04:01.400
 do more surgeries, more aggressive therapy

04:01.400 --> 04:03.360
 to save a thumb, let's say,

04:03.360 --> 04:05.440
 than the tip of your pinky finger.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.640
 So in that way, I do think the thumb

04:07.640 --> 04:09.840
 does seem like the most important in many ways.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.320
 It's nice that there's backups.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.120
 I wonder if that's part of the feature

04:13.120 --> 04:15.960
 or is it just the symmetry that nature produces?

04:15.960 --> 04:18.760
 You think the two hands is like,

04:18.760 --> 04:21.480
 is it about the symmetry or is it about backup?

04:21.480 --> 04:24.120
 We'd be much less formidable hunters,

04:24.120 --> 04:27.880
 gatherers, survivors in any way,

04:27.880 --> 04:29.360
 if we only had one hand.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.200
 So I think that is important to have too.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.880
 So we can, you know, even everything

04:33.880 --> 04:35.800
 from kind of spearing an animal

04:35.800 --> 04:37.840
 to firing a bow and arrow to butchering an animal.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.320
 You really need two hands to do it very effectively.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.160
 But can you do a better job with three?

04:43.160 --> 04:44.760
 Great question.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.320
 And we'll never know, perhaps.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.480
 You tweeted, now I'm gonna analyze your tweets,

04:51.480 --> 04:53.160
 like it's Shakespeare sometimes.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.240
 You tweeted that quote,

04:55.240 --> 04:57.680
 millions of years of sex and death

04:57.680 --> 04:59.240
 designed the human body.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.600
 It's like poetry.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.640
 Are those two basic activities

05:04.880 --> 05:06.200
 basically summarize everything

05:06.200 --> 05:09.120
 that resulted in humans on earth?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.960
 So like, is that a good summary

05:11.960 --> 05:13.840
 of the evolutionary process

05:13.840 --> 05:16.520
 that led to this conscious intelligent being

05:16.520 --> 05:19.240
 is death and sex?

05:19.240 --> 05:20.320
 In a way, yeah.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.520
 So sex is how more of us get made, obviously.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.720
 And death is how we get weeded out

05:25.720 --> 05:27.960
 or the gene pool gets weeded out

05:27.960 --> 05:30.160
 and certain genes survive and others don't.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.520
 And, you know, the age at which we die,

05:33.520 --> 05:35.640
 whether it's before we've, you know,

05:35.640 --> 05:38.640
 had sex and reproduced ourselves is a big factor

05:38.640 --> 05:39.960
 and who survives, who doesn't,

05:39.960 --> 05:41.200
 who passes on their genes

05:41.200 --> 05:43.920
 and what the future of the body looks like.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.360
 You know, who lived and who died

05:46.360 --> 05:49.000
 before they were able to be at reproductive age

05:49.000 --> 05:50.880
 a million years ago was pretty important

05:50.880 --> 05:52.680
 in what we look like now.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.840
 And perhaps how we have sex and die now

05:55.840 --> 05:58.200
 will determine what we're shaped like

05:58.200 --> 05:59.960
 unless technology has an even bigger role

05:59.960 --> 06:01.600
 in that, you know, a million years from now.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.240
 So you think that's fundamental to like,

06:03.240 --> 06:05.240
 if there's alien civilizations out there

06:05.240 --> 06:08.400
 that have the same order of magnitude of intelligence

06:08.400 --> 06:11.480
 or a greater, do you think that we will see something

06:11.480 --> 06:13.840
 like sex and something like death?

06:13.840 --> 06:18.720
 So the reproducing and this selection process

06:18.720 --> 06:23.280
 plus the weeding out of the old to make room for the new,

06:23.280 --> 06:25.520
 is that kind of foundational to life?

06:25.520 --> 06:26.360
 I would think so.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.120
 I mean, it sure seems to be on earth, you know,

06:28.120 --> 06:29.880
 perhaps in some distant future

06:29.880 --> 06:33.280
 when medicine is nearing, you know, perfection

06:33.280 --> 06:35.520
 and people can live a really long time.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.960
 Maybe we won't even need to reproduce as much

06:38.960 --> 06:41.080
 or something like that, you know,

06:41.080 --> 06:43.800
 it's hard to even know what life will be like

06:43.800 --> 06:44.640
 in the distant future.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.920
 But I would guess that any alien civilization

06:46.920 --> 06:50.120
 will have the same dependence on who has sex and who dies.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.800
 Well, that's the problem with immortality.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.960
 How are we going to clear out the old

06:55.960 --> 06:58.800
 to make room for the new, which is kind of a,

07:00.400 --> 07:03.400
 it's like a framework of adaptability

07:03.400 --> 07:04.560
 to changing environment.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.640
 So as long as the environment is changing

07:06.640 --> 07:08.280
 and it seems to always be

07:09.160 --> 07:11.360
 because this is the entirety of the earth system

07:11.360 --> 07:14.160
 is a complex system, it seems like you have to adapt

07:14.160 --> 07:19.160
 and to adapt, you have to kill off the stubborn old ideas.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.040
 And unless there's a way to like,

07:22.040 --> 07:24.000
 not become stubborn and old,

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
 but it feels like the nature of wisdom is stubborn and old.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.200
 Like that's what wisdom is.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.120
 It's like the lessons of life, the lessons

07:35.120 --> 07:37.320
 of experience solidified.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.440
 And the solidification is the thing

07:39.440 --> 07:43.400
 that actually prevents you from reinventing yourself

07:43.400 --> 07:47.360
 to adapt to the new changing conditions.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.000
 But then again, why not have that both of those modes?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.640
 Like have two minds in one person, one immortal person

07:52.640 --> 07:56.640
 that like in the morning, they act like a teenager

07:56.640 --> 08:00.000
 in the evening, they act like an old wise man.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.960
 That's possible.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.760
 So you can imagine within one mind,

08:05.240 --> 08:08.440
 both modes, but those are required.

08:08.440 --> 08:13.440
 You have to have the ability to completely reinvent yourself

08:13.840 --> 08:17.080
 which is what death does in an ugly way

08:18.640 --> 08:20.760
 or a beautiful way depending on your perspective,

08:20.760 --> 08:22.520
 depending whether you take the human perspective

08:22.520 --> 08:25.000
 or the nature's perspective

08:25.000 --> 08:27.080
 and then you have to have the selection.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.520
 So competition, so sexual selection.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.400
 It's an interesting little planet we got.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.040
 What's the weirdest part function concept idea

08:37.040 --> 08:38.560
 about the human body to you?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.640
 We'll talk about fascinating details,

08:40.640 --> 08:44.480
 but what's you, I should say for people

08:44.480 --> 08:46.640
 that should read your book,

08:46.640 --> 08:48.960
 they will come face to face with the fact

08:48.960 --> 08:51.400
 that you do not shy away from the weird

08:51.400 --> 08:53.480
 and the wonderful of the human body.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.520
 It's like, it's fun, but it's honest.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.520
 So given that, sorry to make you pick one of your children

09:03.240 --> 09:06.600
 but what's the weirdest one, would you say?

09:06.600 --> 09:11.600
 The weirdest body part or concept or function.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.400
 So the chapters, you divide it up kind of into parts

09:16.400 --> 09:19.480
 but there could be a thread that connects all of them.

09:19.480 --> 09:24.000
 The weirdness, maybe, or maybe the texture of the substance

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
 could be the liquids, the solids, I don't know.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.200
 Definitely everybody part and bodily fluid

09:29.200 --> 09:33.000
 has their own kind of both gross and fascinating aspects.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.080
 That's probably why I'm a generalist as a doctor

09:36.080 --> 09:38.680
 and couldn't just, as you said, pick one of my children,

09:38.680 --> 09:41.000
 become a specialist because I like them all.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.960
 I feel like one of the strangest concepts

09:44.960 --> 09:49.080
 about the human body is that kind of the aspects of it

09:49.080 --> 09:51.640
 that are the most universal that we all do

09:51.640 --> 09:54.400
 are the most taboo socially.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.560
 I wouldn't have expected that if I had, you know,

09:56.560 --> 09:58.680
 just looked from the outside, like what we do

09:58.680 --> 10:00.920
 in the bathroom, what we do in the bedroom,

10:00.920 --> 10:03.720
 what we do to our own genitals,

10:03.720 --> 10:06.880
 what we do to our quote unquote private parts,

10:06.880 --> 10:09.200
 they're private, even though it's sort of the thing

10:09.200 --> 10:12.880
 that we all have in common is the most we try to hide

10:12.880 --> 10:15.480
 from other people and don't talk about in polite company.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.800
 I mean, it makes sense as a human living in the society

10:17.800 --> 10:20.080
 but from the outside, it sort of might be surprising.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.520
 How do you make sense of that if you put

10:21.520 --> 10:26.080
 on your Sigmund Freud hat, the thing we all do,

10:26.080 --> 10:28.920
 why do we make that a taboo thing?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.880
 Is it because we like taboos?

10:30.880 --> 10:35.720
 Maybe we get off or maybe our kinks as humans

10:35.720 --> 10:38.960
 is to have taboos and it's kind of efficient

10:38.960 --> 10:41.920
 to have taboos about the things that everybody does.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.840
 Like you can make walking taboo or something.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.320
 I don't know, but just maybe that's what we love.

10:48.320 --> 10:52.200
 That's what's exciting to us is the forbidden.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.760
 I think, yeah, society loves rules for sure.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.120
 They loves some societies more than others.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.240
 They love controlling how you think

11:00.240 --> 11:02.920
 and what you do in public versus in private.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.160
 There's a lot of societies where, for instance,

11:05.160 --> 11:07.040
 parents have sex in front of children.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.840
 For instance, like in a traditional Inupiat Eskimo societies,

11:12.840 --> 11:14.640
 that was sort of normal.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.560
 I mean, but what are you gonna do?

11:15.560 --> 11:17.800
 Go outside in the middle of the winter in the Arctic

11:17.800 --> 11:19.320
 and do it out there, of course not.

11:19.320 --> 11:23.720
 So there's different taboos in different societies.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.240
 Some taboos make perfect sense.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.880
 Some taboos are even public health measures,

11:28.880 --> 11:32.040
 like as I talk in the book about in India,

11:32.040 --> 11:35.680
 where the hands are symmetric, as you said,

11:35.680 --> 11:38.480
 but in Indian culture and the left hand is taboo

11:38.480 --> 11:41.760
 and the right hand is what you use for shaking hands,

11:41.760 --> 11:43.280
 for eating, for other things.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.280
 And the left hand is the dirty hand that you use

11:46.280 --> 11:47.720
 for wiping your own bottom.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.360
 That's the toilet paper is your left hand.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.720
 So while the body is anatomically symmetric,

11:52.720 --> 11:56.440
 the taboo creates this pretty intense asymmetry.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.520
 But for a good reason, you know,

11:57.520 --> 11:59.920
 yet you probably shouldn't be shaking hands with other people

11:59.920 --> 12:02.200
 with the same hand that you use to kind of clean your bottom.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.480
 So in that sense, it makes sense.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.360
 Yeah, maybe the roots of it makes sense,

12:07.360 --> 12:10.680
 but the way it propagates, especially as the times change,

12:10.680 --> 12:13.320
 might not, because you can wash your hands,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.160
 but the taboo remains.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.120
 Right, society is very slow to change.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.160
 What is the most fascinating part,

12:21.160 --> 12:23.840
 function or concept in the human body?

12:23.840 --> 12:28.840
 So, you know, something that fills you with awe.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.520
 I guess the most obvious one is the brain,

12:32.520 --> 12:36.640
 partly because it's so, you know, sort of poorly understood,

12:36.640 --> 12:39.720
 though we understand more than we ever have in the past,

12:39.720 --> 12:41.560
 there's still so much that we don't understand

12:41.560 --> 12:44.560
 about how the lump of matter in our skulls

12:44.560 --> 12:46.600
 kind of creates this subjective experience

12:46.600 --> 12:49.700
 that we all kind of understand quite this really.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.580
 So that's an easy one.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.780
 I would say the kidneys are an underappreciated organ.

12:54.780 --> 12:58.580
 They, the way they tinker with the bloodstream,

12:58.580 --> 13:01.060
 raise levels of this, lower levels of that,

13:01.060 --> 13:04.860
 kind of our entire lives from inside the womb

13:04.860 --> 13:07.500
 until we die is just really incredible.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.180
 And when you look at how much energy

13:09.180 --> 13:10.540
 different organs consume,

13:10.540 --> 13:13.440
 the brain and the kidneys are two of the biggest ones,

13:13.440 --> 13:16.620
 because the brain obviously in us is always active

13:16.620 --> 13:17.980
 and controlling parts of the body,

13:17.980 --> 13:21.020
 but the kidneys are just consuming a ton of energy

13:21.020 --> 13:21.860
 to do what they do.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.220
 They're kind of the unsung hero of the body

13:24.220 --> 13:26.060
 relegated to the back of the abdomen,

13:26.060 --> 13:28.380
 like some forgotten organ, but they're, they are great.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.980
 I did consider being a nephrologist,

13:29.980 --> 13:31.100
 which is a kidney specialist

13:31.100 --> 13:33.140
 because I was so taken with the kidneys,

13:33.140 --> 13:35.220
 but you know, decided I like all the organs,

13:35.220 --> 13:36.540
 so couldn't pick just one.

13:37.580 --> 13:40.540
 So your book is ordered in a particular way.

13:40.540 --> 13:45.380
 It's throat, heart, feces, genitals, liver,

13:45.380 --> 13:50.380
 pineal gland, brain, skin, urine, fat, lungs, eyes, mucus,

13:54.220 --> 13:57.300
 fingers and toes and blood.

13:57.300 --> 14:02.220
 All right, first of all, great, great chapter titles.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.540
 Is there a reason for this ordering or is it all madness?

14:06.540 --> 14:09.140
 There's a few different reasons that went into it.

14:09.140 --> 14:13.780
 I did want to start with the throat for the reason

14:13.780 --> 14:18.140
 that it kind of presents the topic of death,

14:18.140 --> 14:20.620
 which is sort of obviously very important

14:20.620 --> 14:23.140
 in the training of a physician, in the career of physician.

14:23.140 --> 14:25.420
 It's a big part of what I deal with.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.900
 You know, on the first day of medical school,

14:27.900 --> 14:30.260
 we started the dissection of a cadaver

14:30.260 --> 14:32.060
 in the class called Anatomy Lab.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.980
 And so in a way, we were kind of thrown right in there

14:34.980 --> 14:38.100
 in the beginning, like this is the end of the human story,

14:38.100 --> 14:40.740
 you know, understand this and then we sort of backed up

14:40.740 --> 14:42.260
 to the beginning with embryology

14:42.260 --> 14:43.820
 and reproduction and stuff.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.180
 So it's kind of like we got,

14:45.180 --> 14:48.180
 and I got thrown into that right away,

14:48.180 --> 14:50.300
 right in the beginning, kind of like here's a dead body,

14:50.300 --> 14:52.500
 now start cutting it apart and learn the name

14:52.500 --> 14:54.980
 and function of absolutely every bit of flesh.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.340
 How did that change you,

14:56.340 --> 15:01.340
 that first experience of the cold honesty of human biology?

15:01.740 --> 15:02.980
 All right, that's exactly what it was,

15:02.980 --> 15:05.020
 it's cold honesty about the kind of the story

15:05.020 --> 15:06.780
 of each individual human body.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.340
 It has an end and that's it.

15:08.340 --> 15:13.180
 I think that, well, actually before the end of that first day,

15:13.180 --> 15:14.300
 so what we did on that first day

15:14.300 --> 15:16.420
 was study the superficial muscles of the back,

15:16.420 --> 15:19.180
 like the lats or latissimus dorsi and some other muscles.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.380
 You know, we cut through the skin of the back,

15:21.380 --> 15:23.980
 my cadaver was laying face down on this metal gurney.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.900
 We pulled back the kind of plastic sheets

15:25.900 --> 15:28.300
 that would keep him moist for the next four months

15:28.300 --> 15:31.100
 as we dissected him, cut through the skin on his back

15:31.100 --> 15:32.140
 and then started dissecting

15:32.140 --> 15:34.140
 through the superficial muscles of the back.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.460
 And that was really all we saw that first day.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.660
 We didn't get any deeper, didn't enter the abdominal

15:38.660 --> 15:41.420
 or chest cavity to see internal organs,

15:41.420 --> 15:44.540
 but I was so fascinated with this sort of

15:44.540 --> 15:48.020
 behind the scenes look at how things work in the body,

15:48.020 --> 15:50.420
 how you move your arms, how you arch your back.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.500
 You know, these are the muscles that do it

15:52.500 --> 15:54.740
 that I decided I wanted to donate my own body

15:54.740 --> 15:56.260
 for the same purpose.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.940
 So I made that decision literally

15:57.940 --> 16:00.140
 before the end of that first day of class

16:00.140 --> 16:02.980
 and I'm still sticking to it.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.420
 So someday there'll be a medical student

16:05.420 --> 16:09.300
 that can watch and listen to this podcast

16:09.300 --> 16:11.420
 while dissecting your body.

16:11.420 --> 16:12.260
 It could happen.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.460
 They might not know that that person they're listening to

16:14.460 --> 16:17.180
 on the podcast will be the carcass in front of them,

16:17.180 --> 16:18.940
 but like we don't, we never learned it.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.140
 The universe will know.

16:20.140 --> 16:20.980
 The universe will know.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.700
 And they will acknowledge the irony

16:23.700 --> 16:26.460
 or the humor, the absurdity of that.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.740
 The universe will chuckle,

16:27.740 --> 16:29.860
 but the medical student won't know

16:29.860 --> 16:33.340
 because they never, as I did not learn any, you know,

16:33.340 --> 16:35.700
 personal information about the person,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.740
 only what I could glean from looking inside him,

16:37.740 --> 16:38.980
 which actually tells you quite a bit.

16:38.980 --> 16:40.140
 I knew he was a smoker.

16:40.140 --> 16:41.860
 I knew he had coronary artery disease.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.980
 You know, you get a window into,

16:43.980 --> 16:44.980
 I knew he was overweight.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.620
 You get a window into people's lives

16:46.620 --> 16:49.580
 just by looking in their bodies after death.

16:49.580 --> 16:53.860
 Other cadavers in the lab, not my own,

16:53.860 --> 16:55.820
 or I shared one with three other students,

16:55.820 --> 16:56.740
 but other cadavers.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.940
 Some had, you know, metal joints,

16:58.940 --> 17:00.060
 like a knee replacement.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.460
 Some had a kidney missing.

17:01.460 --> 17:04.460
 So they probably, and we could tell it was surgically removed,

17:04.460 --> 17:07.020
 not that he was born with one.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.980
 And we could tell that he probably had a kidney tumor

17:08.980 --> 17:10.100
 or cancer that was removed.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.580
 So you do get an insight into people's lives

17:12.580 --> 17:16.060
 from, you know, picking them apart after they're dead,

17:16.060 --> 17:17.260
 but you don't know their name

17:17.260 --> 17:19.580
 or what podcast they've been on.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.860
 So the, as the book title says, unseen body.

17:23.780 --> 17:27.860
 So it tells some kind of story of your life.

17:27.860 --> 17:30.900
 So it does capture the decisions you've made in your life,

17:30.900 --> 17:32.460
 the things you've done.

17:32.460 --> 17:37.460
 That might be kind of secret to that person

17:37.500 --> 17:41.700
 and maybe to a few others that knew him or her well.

17:41.700 --> 17:42.860
 It's so fascinating.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.020
 So what kind of things can it reveal?

17:46.020 --> 17:49.860
 Like what kind of choices in terms of the injuries,

17:49.860 --> 17:53.420
 the catastrophic events,

17:53.420 --> 17:56.900
 the lifestyle choices of smoking and diet

17:56.900 --> 17:59.820
 and all those kinds of things, what can you see?

17:59.820 --> 18:03.460
 What kind of history can you see about the human before you?

18:03.460 --> 18:05.900
 So all those things you mentioned are things you can see.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.220
 You can, you know, take the skin, for example, right?

18:08.220 --> 18:11.900
 Most things that happen to us leave a mark, you know,

18:11.900 --> 18:15.340
 as I say, a kind of a story written in the language of scar

18:15.340 --> 18:16.980
 where it tells you injuries you've had.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.020
 And same thing with animals.

18:18.020 --> 18:21.340
 You know, I've seen deer hides that have marks

18:21.340 --> 18:23.740
 that look like they're made by maybe a barbed wire fence,

18:23.740 --> 18:24.580
 something like that.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.900
 You can tell, you know, sometimes it's conjecture,

18:27.900 --> 18:30.100
 but you can sort of imagine what might have happened

18:30.100 --> 18:32.660
 to cause that perhaps, you know, two bucks were fighting

18:32.660 --> 18:34.820
 and one got injured with an antler.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.300
 And the same with humans.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.700
 You know, I have scars on my body

18:37.700 --> 18:40.820
 and when I notice them, I remember what happened.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.220
 You know, I got a big cut on my hand when I was 13

18:44.220 --> 18:45.140
 and it's still there.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.980
 And I remember what happened, you know,

18:47.980 --> 18:48.940
 every time I look at it.

18:48.940 --> 18:52.900
 And so in that way, only I might know that story,

18:52.900 --> 18:54.860
 but other people, you know, when they dissect me

18:54.860 --> 18:56.060
 and notice the same scars,

18:56.060 --> 18:58.100
 they can kind of, it can fire their imagination

18:58.100 --> 19:00.140
 as my cadaver, you know, did for me.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.780
 They know that there is a story there.

19:02.780 --> 19:03.980
 That's such an interesting way

19:03.980 --> 19:05.940
 that the skin does tell a story.

19:07.060 --> 19:09.740
 Both tattoos and scars.

19:09.740 --> 19:10.580
 Right.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.100
 And even the fun you've had

19:12.100 --> 19:14.140
 and some of the damage you've done.

19:14.140 --> 19:14.980
 Right.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.940
 And even when I evaluate a patient,

19:16.940 --> 19:20.540
 I can use scars to help me make medical decisions.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.900
 So for instance, someone that comes in

19:21.900 --> 19:24.280
 with abdominal pain into the emergency room,

19:24.280 --> 19:26.060
 you can see scars on their abdomen

19:26.060 --> 19:27.420
 that tell you about, you know,

19:27.420 --> 19:30.620
 the past kind of activities of a surgeon, perhaps.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.420
 I know, I recognize the scars that are left

19:33.420 --> 19:35.220
 when someone has their gallbladder removed,

19:35.220 --> 19:37.180
 the scars when someone has their appendix removed,

19:37.180 --> 19:38.940
 when maybe when someone's had a hysterectomy.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.300
 And that can tell you what it might be

19:41.300 --> 19:42.660
 or what it isn't, you know,

19:42.660 --> 19:43.980
 if someone doesn't have an appendix,

19:43.980 --> 19:46.660
 their abdominal pain is not appendicitis, end of story.

19:46.660 --> 19:49.740
 So in that way, I'm sort of looking at these,

19:49.740 --> 19:52.740
 the tracks of the footprints of past surgeries

19:52.740 --> 19:55.300
 to tell me what might and might not be the cause

19:55.300 --> 19:56.500
 of this patient's abdominal pain,

19:56.500 --> 19:58.180
 which is kind of my main job in the ER,

19:58.180 --> 20:00.620
 is figuring out what's causing it and to help them.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.540
 Is there ways to get more data about the human body

20:05.540 --> 20:08.780
 as we look into the future of medicine biology,

20:08.780 --> 20:11.260
 that will be helpful to fill in some of the gaps

20:11.260 --> 20:12.680
 of the story?

20:12.680 --> 20:17.140
 So, you know, you have companies,

20:17.140 --> 20:20.580
 you have research that looks at, you know,

20:20.580 --> 20:23.540
 collection of blood over long periods of time

20:23.540 --> 20:26.140
 to see sort of, you know,

20:26.140 --> 20:28.140
 paint the picture of what's happening in your body,

20:28.140 --> 20:29.980
 mostly to help with lifestyle decisions,

20:29.980 --> 20:33.500
 but also to, you know, to anticipate things

20:33.500 --> 20:35.420
 that can go wrong and all that kind of stuff.

20:35.420 --> 20:40.020
 Is there, can you just speak to a greater digital world

20:40.020 --> 20:40.860
 that we're stepping in,

20:40.860 --> 20:44.220
 how that can help tell a richer story?

20:45.120 --> 20:48.740
 I certainly think that we have more data

20:48.740 --> 20:50.380
 than we know what to do with right now,

20:50.380 --> 20:54.300
 especially with kind of direct to consumer medical devices,

20:54.300 --> 20:55.900
 you know, smartwatches, et cetera,

20:55.900 --> 20:58.780
 that are just collecting these reams of data.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.220
 I have not seen them put to,

21:01.220 --> 21:04.220
 I think the eventual use that they will.

21:04.220 --> 21:08.420
 I think that the potential is sort of just, you know,

21:08.420 --> 21:11.700
 unimaginable and I hope we're heading into a new age

21:11.700 --> 21:14.180
 where, you know, you can determine, for instance,

21:14.180 --> 21:17.100
 is a person gonna have more of the dangerous side effects

21:17.100 --> 21:19.140
 to a drug based on their genetics,

21:19.140 --> 21:21.780
 or are they gonna tolerate one drug better

21:21.780 --> 21:24.620
 than the other, you know, based on their genetics?

21:24.620 --> 21:27.740
 And we are slowly moving into that age,

21:27.740 --> 21:30.740
 and especially the age of kind of completely synthesizing

21:30.740 --> 21:35.740
 drugs in a lab, you know, much like, for instance,

21:36.260 --> 21:38.020
 some of the COVID vaccines actually,

21:38.020 --> 21:41.140
 like Moderna never had the virus in their lab.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.580
 They made that vaccine completely

21:42.580 --> 21:44.160
 without ever having the virus themselves,

21:44.160 --> 21:46.580
 just by having the genome, which is sort of astounding.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.260
 And there's a lot of potential going forward, you know,

21:49.260 --> 21:51.220
 based on that technology and some others.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.060
 Well, I didn't know that.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.980
 So they basically, it's all in the computer,

21:53.980 --> 21:54.980
 it's computational.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.300
 Right, you have the genetic code,

21:56.300 --> 21:57.580
 you have tremendous power,

21:57.580 --> 21:59.900
 even if you don't have the organism itself.

21:59.900 --> 22:04.660
 What do you make of Elizabeth Holmes and efforts like that?

22:04.660 --> 22:09.660
 First of all, I'm a curious,

22:11.820 --> 22:16.300
 I'm drawn to the darkness in human nature

22:16.300 --> 22:18.380
 because that somehow reveals

22:20.380 --> 22:23.100
 the full spectrum of what humans could be.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.540
 So there's a lot of sort of controversial thoughts

22:25.540 --> 22:28.580
 about who she is and her efforts and so on.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.940
 I think you may have even tweeted about it,

22:30.940 --> 22:33.940
 but I've read a lot of your tweets, so I'm now forgetting.

22:33.940 --> 22:37.460
 But what do you make of her and both those efforts

22:37.460 --> 22:42.460
 and the charlatans that sort of snake oil salesman

22:42.460 --> 22:47.460
 that promise those efforts to do more than they currently can?

22:49.980 --> 22:54.260
 I think that her, you know, that goal that she had,

22:54.260 --> 22:57.100
 that she created there and I was to try to achieve

22:57.100 --> 23:00.740
 to use less blood in tests is a very worthy goal

23:00.740 --> 23:03.980
 and a huge frontier that we have not achieved

23:03.980 --> 23:05.540
 and that I hope we will achieve.

23:05.540 --> 23:08.340
 So I understand why, you know,

23:08.340 --> 23:11.580
 someone describes what a huge step forward that would be

23:11.580 --> 23:13.220
 and it would be indeed,

23:13.220 --> 23:15.700
 I understand why people put a ton of money behind it.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.900
 Can you describe what was the promise?

23:17.900 --> 23:20.340
 What do we even talk about with Theranos?

23:20.340 --> 23:22.380
 What just for people who don't know?

23:22.380 --> 23:25.620
 So Theranos is a company that was basically started

23:25.620 --> 23:29.740
 to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done,

23:29.740 --> 23:33.060
 both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.860
 You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor

23:34.860 --> 23:37.620
 and had five to 10 tubes of blood removed from them,

23:37.620 --> 23:41.500
 it can be quite surprising how much they take out

23:41.500 --> 23:45.060
 and that's the limitation of our technology

23:45.060 --> 23:46.420
 that we need those volumes of blood

23:46.420 --> 23:47.820
 to run all the tests that we want to.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.100
 And so the promise of Theranos was that

23:50.100 --> 23:51.860
 perhaps with a single drop of blood,

23:51.860 --> 23:55.020
 we would be able to know as much about the person's,

23:55.020 --> 23:58.500
 the condition of their body without drawing all that blood

23:58.500 --> 24:01.620
 and thereby, you know, there would be these devices

24:01.620 --> 24:03.740
 she was gonna create that would sort of do it.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.660
 You put a drop of blood in it and spits out everything

24:05.660 --> 24:07.500
 you ever wanted to know about what's in your bloodstream

24:07.500 --> 24:09.900
 and in a way that would make it so much easier,

24:09.900 --> 24:11.820
 you know, it could be, you could have one in your home

24:11.820 --> 24:14.260
 theoretically and you, I don't know why you'd wonder

24:14.260 --> 24:16.220
 what your potassium level is on any given day,

24:16.220 --> 24:18.020
 but you could check if you wanted to.

24:18.980 --> 24:21.300
 And so that goal is very worthy.

24:21.300 --> 24:25.460
 You know, I put that goal up there with the frontier

24:25.460 --> 24:27.580
 of making painkillers that are as good as opioids

24:27.580 --> 24:28.900
 without the addictive quality.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.660
 You know, that would be such a huge revolution

24:30.660 --> 24:32.100
 if we did have that in medicine,

24:32.100 --> 24:34.420
 but particularly for me,

24:34.420 --> 24:37.420
 because I trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine,

24:37.420 --> 24:40.260
 so I learned to care for both children and adults.

24:40.260 --> 24:42.140
 In children, we do draw much less blood.

24:42.140 --> 24:43.820
 They have a much lower blood volume

24:43.820 --> 24:47.340
 and we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood

24:47.340 --> 24:49.980
 and we seemingly get equivalent information

24:49.980 --> 24:52.180
 out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.580
 And I'm still unclear to be honest,

24:53.580 --> 24:56.300
 why we can't draw that little amount of blood from adults.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.220
 It seems technically possible.

24:58.220 --> 24:59.420
 I don't know what the barriers are.

24:59.420 --> 25:02.220
 I'm sure there are or else we'd be doing it.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.820
 But I do think that it is a very important goal

25:04.820 --> 25:06.060
 and if Theranos had done it,

25:06.060 --> 25:07.380
 they would have really revolutionized

25:07.380 --> 25:09.020
 the practice of medicine.

25:09.020 --> 25:14.020
 So to return to that cadaver that first day

25:16.180 --> 25:18.340
 when you got to meet with a dead,

25:18.340 --> 25:21.100
 with a human body that's no longer living.

25:21.100 --> 25:26.100
 So how quickly did it take for you to get used to sort of,

25:27.940 --> 25:31.060
 you said, looking at the surface muscles of the back.

25:31.060 --> 25:35.020
 I mean, that can be overwhelming as a thought

25:35.020 --> 25:37.500
 and people listening to this that have never dissected

25:37.500 --> 25:40.220
 anything might be overwhelmed by that thought.

25:40.220 --> 25:43.660
 So like how quickly were you able to get used

25:43.660 --> 25:48.540
 to the brutal honesty of the biology before you?

25:48.540 --> 25:50.300
 For me, it did not take long at all.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.100
 I guess I've never been a squeamish person.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.140
 So for me, it was kind of riveting

25:55.140 --> 25:56.980
 and fascinating right from the first moment.

25:56.980 --> 26:00.260
 But I do know some of my fellow classmates

26:00.260 --> 26:01.820
 did have some trouble with it.

26:01.820 --> 26:05.740
 Some of them I heard had nightmares in the first few weeks

26:05.740 --> 26:08.940
 of anatomy lab, but then everyone,

26:08.940 --> 26:10.620
 as far as I know, got used to it.

26:10.620 --> 26:13.500
 And that was also actually a big lesson for me

26:13.500 --> 26:15.860
 that it's pretty amazing what people can get used to

26:15.860 --> 26:16.700
 in their daily lives.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.180
 And I kind of extrapolated that to people living through war

26:20.180 --> 26:23.220
 and through just terrible situations

26:23.220 --> 26:26.860
 and living under oppressive regimes.

26:26.860 --> 26:30.060
 And it really is amazing what people can get used to,

26:30.060 --> 26:31.500
 almost anything.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.740
 But you know, in war, people often come back

26:35.740 --> 26:37.300
 and they have nightmares.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.220
 They suffer through it.

26:38.220 --> 26:41.660
 There's PTSD, there's a lot of complicated feelings

26:41.660 --> 26:42.500
 with that.

26:43.860 --> 26:47.740
 Are echoes of those same complicated feelings possible

26:47.740 --> 26:50.900
 in the case of training to be and becoming a doctor?

26:51.980 --> 26:52.820
 It's a good point.

26:52.820 --> 26:56.340
 Yeah, I think sometimes just as a barbed wire fence

26:56.340 --> 26:58.580
 can leave a scar on your skin,

26:58.580 --> 27:01.020
 emotional psychological experiences

27:01.020 --> 27:03.860
 can leave a mark on your brain or your memory.

27:03.860 --> 27:08.860
 And I think that definitely could be a problem

27:09.900 --> 27:10.740
 in medical training.

27:10.740 --> 27:14.180
 You do see a lot of things that are very shocking,

27:14.180 --> 27:16.980
 very repulsive things that you'd never forget.

27:16.980 --> 27:20.020
 I know one of those students that had nightmares initially

27:20.020 --> 27:21.460
 went on to be a surgeon.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.780
 So I imagine she's not having the PTSD

27:23.780 --> 27:25.980
 of kind of seeing inside her first dead body

27:25.980 --> 27:28.580
 because she sees inside them all day every day now.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.180
 But I'm sure it could.

27:30.180 --> 27:34.420
 You know, we go on to see so many kind of grosser

27:34.420 --> 27:37.180
 or more shocking things in medical training

27:37.180 --> 27:38.660
 through medical school and then by working

27:38.660 --> 27:40.460
 with actual living patients,

27:40.460 --> 27:43.580
 not just dead and embalmed bodies.

27:43.580 --> 27:46.660
 So I do think that things can leave a mark,

27:46.660 --> 27:49.020
 but I don't think that initial cadaver

27:49.020 --> 27:50.420
 would be the most traumatic.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.620
 Yeah, but maybe some of that trauma,

27:54.620 --> 27:57.020
 the demons make you a better surgeon.

27:57.020 --> 28:00.540
 Just like some of your own psychological trauma

28:00.540 --> 28:03.140
 might make you a better psychiatrist.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.700
 Returning to the ordering.

28:05.860 --> 28:07.980
 Is it order or is it chaos?

28:07.980 --> 28:12.500
 To the ordering of the chapters from throat and heart

28:12.500 --> 28:14.940
 and feces and genitals all the way to fingers

28:14.940 --> 28:16.780
 and toes and blood.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.540
 So I did mention that, you know,

28:18.540 --> 28:20.380
 throat was the first one because I kind of wanted

28:20.380 --> 28:24.580
 to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death.

28:24.580 --> 28:27.260
 And I followed it up with feces as the third chapter

28:27.260 --> 28:30.260
 and in a way partly to also throw them right

28:30.260 --> 28:34.020
 into the deep end of how I like discussing parts

28:34.020 --> 28:36.380
 of the body and revealing their gross

28:36.380 --> 28:37.900
 and fascinating aspects.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.660
 So I didn't want to hide anything.

28:39.660 --> 28:41.260
 You know, when you train to be a doctor,

28:41.260 --> 28:44.540
 everything is on the table, literally in the cadaver lab,

28:44.540 --> 28:46.860
 but also just, you know, you deal with blood

28:46.860 --> 28:48.820
 and piss and vomit and feces.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.260
 And that's kind of the medium of your craft.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.780
 And he has the medium of the craft, that's right.

28:54.780 --> 28:55.620
 Right.

28:55.620 --> 28:59.980
 Like if you're a painter, this is the paint that you wear.

28:59.980 --> 29:00.820
 Exactly.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.220
 And then you have to create a masterpiece with it.

29:04.540 --> 29:05.700
 Like almost like a dance,

29:05.700 --> 29:06.900
 because there's multiple painters.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.900
 One of the painters is the biology.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.380
 So let's return to throat.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.060
 You mentioned it's a weird one.

29:12.060 --> 29:14.740
 So first of all, a friend of mine said,

29:14.740 --> 29:19.660
 I just see humans as like a bunch of holes

29:19.660 --> 29:21.540
 that just walk around.

29:24.020 --> 29:25.580
 Not untrue.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.460
 It's a funny way to look at humans.

29:27.460 --> 29:31.700
 So we have ears, we have nose, we have mouth.

29:31.700 --> 29:36.700
 We have the sexual holes, vagina penis.

29:36.980 --> 29:40.540
 And then, you know, what's the medical term

29:40.540 --> 29:41.740
 for your asshole?

29:42.700 --> 29:43.540
 Anus.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.380
 Anus, thank you.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.220
 This is a very technical discussion.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.740
 The rectum's further in, don't confuse the two.

29:49.740 --> 29:51.580
 Oh, that's very important.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.020
 Is there a difference between throat and mouth?

29:54.020 --> 29:56.100
 By the way, so when you say throat,

29:56.100 --> 29:58.260
 are we talking about when that hole

29:58.260 --> 30:00.900
 actually becomes tubular?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.620
 The throat, I would count as just sort of the very back

30:03.620 --> 30:06.140
 of the, you know, the back of the mouth,

30:06.140 --> 30:08.620
 where the nose also comes down and meets it,

30:08.620 --> 30:11.420
 where the tonsils are and the uvula.

30:11.420 --> 30:13.220
 But you're right that, you know, we are a bunch of holes,

30:13.220 --> 30:15.180
 but more accurately, we're a tube, right?

30:15.180 --> 30:18.660
 We start in the womb as kind of this microscopic little disc,

30:18.660 --> 30:21.980
 almost like a, you know, a flatbread.

30:21.980 --> 30:25.980
 And then we roll almost like a burrito into this tube.

30:25.980 --> 30:27.660
 And we're a simple microscopic tube.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.220
 And from there, we grow into this bigger and bigger tube

30:30.220 --> 30:32.180
 and we become more complicated.

30:32.180 --> 30:35.140
 And each end of the tube does split into various holes.

30:35.140 --> 30:37.180
 So all the holes you mentioned at the front end of the tube,

30:37.180 --> 30:38.380
 the front end of our body, right?

30:38.380 --> 30:41.500
 It splits into the nose, the mouth, the ears,

30:41.500 --> 30:46.020
 the sinuses, the tube to the lungs, which is the windpipe,

30:46.020 --> 30:48.780
 the tube down to the stomach, which is the esophagus.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.540
 And then the other end of the tube splits as well.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.940
 You know, men end up with two holes

30:53.940 --> 30:56.740
 and women end up with three holes, you know,

30:56.740 --> 30:59.140
 the urethra, the vagina and the anus and men,

30:59.140 --> 31:00.620
 just, you know, the urethra

31:00.620 --> 31:03.380
 and kind of the reproductive system, they share a whole.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.860
 So I'm learning a lot today.

31:05.860 --> 31:10.180
 It really is incredible that you start from sperm and an egg

31:10.180 --> 31:12.380
 and you have some DNA information.

31:12.380 --> 31:15.540
 And from that, the building project begins.

31:15.540 --> 31:20.540
 And then what that leads to is like a pizza dough

31:20.900 --> 31:25.340
 and then you roll it into a tube and that tube,

31:25.340 --> 31:30.340
 then eventually sort of becomes more and more complicated

31:31.740 --> 31:36.740
 and gets eyes and a brain and then can create a Twitter account.

31:36.740 --> 31:41.740
 So from, it's really incredible that we're just a fancy tube.

31:42.260 --> 31:43.580
 Right, we are.

31:43.580 --> 31:47.580
 And we sprout eyes and a brain and a sense of smell and taste

31:47.580 --> 31:50.580
 pretty much to regulate what comes in the front of the tube.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.740
 You know, we don't want to eat anything dangerous or poisonous.

31:53.740 --> 31:55.740
 You know, we want to choose what we eat,

31:55.740 --> 31:57.140
 even choose who we kiss.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.540
 Well, we seem to be motivated

31:58.540 --> 32:02.580
 by what comes out of the tube as well in part.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.940
 That's not just output, it's a feedback mechanism.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.900
 It's a feedback mechanism, seemingly.

32:07.900 --> 32:11.100
 Like we're also monitoring the functioning of the output.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.020
 We're not just obsessed about the input.

32:14.260 --> 32:15.700
 We're very obsessed with the output.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.940
 You're absolutely right about that.

32:17.940 --> 32:21.460
 People, you know, have medical complaints about their output

32:21.460 --> 32:22.940
 very often that are, you know,

32:22.940 --> 32:24.860
 I never, I never cease to be surprised

32:24.860 --> 32:28.100
 by a new kind of complaint or observation about the output.

32:28.100 --> 32:32.380
 I think people have gone to wars over the output

32:32.380 --> 32:35.020
 and maybe sometimes the lack of the output

32:35.020 --> 32:36.700
 or the desire for output

32:36.700 --> 32:41.020
 for the particular other humans that you fancy,

32:41.020 --> 32:44.380
 the brain and the eyes that sprouted

32:44.380 --> 32:48.140
 somehow convinced the rest of the body

32:48.140 --> 32:51.820
 that this one particular other tube is fanciful.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.460
 So you're going to go to major wars

32:53.460 --> 32:57.460
 and lead global suffering because of the fancy

32:57.460 --> 33:01.660
 and the desire for additional output with the other tube.

33:01.660 --> 33:06.660
 Okay, so that's, so on the throat, that part of the tube.

33:09.500 --> 33:13.580
 Is it, you said the design is not,

33:13.580 --> 33:16.260
 you could have thought of maybe a little bit better options

33:16.260 --> 33:18.340
 because it's too multifunctional.

33:18.340 --> 33:20.820
 Is that, can you sort of elaborate

33:20.820 --> 33:23.780
 on the multifunctional nature of this part

33:23.780 --> 33:26.460
 or a lot of parts of the human body multifunctional

33:26.460 --> 33:29.500
 or do you find that it's more specialization

33:29.500 --> 33:32.260
 is going to get the job done better?

33:32.260 --> 33:34.060
 There is a lot of organs, for instance,

33:34.060 --> 33:35.740
 do have multiple functions.

33:35.740 --> 33:39.540
 The pancreas has two, is like two organs in one,

33:39.540 --> 33:42.460
 one secretes hormones like insulin into the bloodstream

33:42.460 --> 33:45.940
 and the other aspect of it secretes digestive enzymes

33:45.940 --> 33:49.180
 into the gut to help you digest and absorb food.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.060
 The liver is like 15 organs in one.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.820
 It's just amazing how many different things it does.

33:53.820 --> 33:57.460
 But the throat, so basically the problem with the throat

33:57.460 --> 33:59.900
 is as I said, we have two tubes

33:59.900 --> 34:01.860
 that are right next to each other in the throat.

34:01.860 --> 34:05.380
 One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,

34:05.380 --> 34:07.060
 whatever you're gonna swallow.

34:07.060 --> 34:09.260
 All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,

34:09.260 --> 34:11.420
 the food tube and end up in the stomach.

34:11.420 --> 34:14.420
 And right next to the esophagus, millimeters away

34:14.420 --> 34:16.300
 is the windpipe or the trachea,

34:16.300 --> 34:18.380
 which goes down to the lungs.

34:18.380 --> 34:21.860
 And your throat does these daily gymnastics

34:21.860 --> 34:26.340
 to keep everything but air out of the windpipe

34:26.340 --> 34:30.260
 because you slip up once and you can die.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.820
 You can choke, you laugh or speak while eating

34:32.820 --> 34:35.100
 and it's curtains, unfortunately.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.380
 So it seems like every aspect of the body

34:37.380 --> 34:38.820
 when I was learning about it in med school

34:38.820 --> 34:43.460
 seems so brilliant and so perfectly designed by evolution

34:43.460 --> 34:45.500
 or whoever you might think designed it

34:46.340 --> 34:50.540
 to favor survival, to enhance life,

34:51.660 --> 34:53.700
 but the throat seemed the opposite.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.700
 It seemed set up almost for failure.

34:56.700 --> 35:00.340
 And we developed all these mechanisms as a compensation.

35:00.340 --> 35:04.020
 We have the gag reflex whenever food or something

35:04.020 --> 35:07.100
 is headed towards your airpipe, your windpipe

35:07.100 --> 35:08.140
 or down to your lungs.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.660
 Your throat has this rejection of it.

35:10.660 --> 35:13.180
 It pushes it away in a gag reflex.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.500
 At the same time, we have a cough,

35:14.500 --> 35:16.380
 which is something our body does

35:16.380 --> 35:19.060
 when something inappropriate does get down the windpipe.

35:19.060 --> 35:22.260
 When we get a little food down the wrong pipe,

35:22.260 --> 35:24.740
 we end up coughing and the coughing does

35:24.740 --> 35:27.340
 usually flush it out and get rid of it.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.940
 We even have something called the mucus elevator

35:29.940 --> 35:33.740
 in our lungs, which is this constant flow of mucus

35:33.740 --> 35:35.820
 up the airways, up to the trachea,

35:35.820 --> 35:37.940
 dragging with it all kinds of particulates

35:37.940 --> 35:40.100
 that we've inhaled and perhaps some food

35:40.100 --> 35:41.220
 that went down the wrong pipe

35:41.220 --> 35:44.260
 and drags it up into the throat and we swallow it

35:44.260 --> 35:47.140
 kind of unconsciously all day every day is the truth.

35:47.140 --> 35:50.180
 Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.260
 It uses a number of cranial nerves.

35:52.260 --> 35:55.540
 It uses over 15 different muscles.

35:55.540 --> 36:00.380
 It's this coordinated act to keep food out of the airway.

36:00.380 --> 36:02.420
 You can see someone's Adam's apple in their neck

36:02.420 --> 36:05.180
 kind of jump upward when they swallow,

36:05.180 --> 36:09.260
 which helps lift the airway up against the epiglottis,

36:09.260 --> 36:12.980
 which plugs it closed and allows food or swallow drink

36:12.980 --> 36:15.020
 to kind of skirt just past it.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.540
 But every time we swallow,

36:16.540 --> 36:18.580
 those things do come within millimeters

36:18.580 --> 36:19.780
 of going down the wrong pipe

36:19.780 --> 36:22.420
 and it's just thanks to these kind of compensations,

36:22.420 --> 36:24.780
 these adaptations we have to the danger of the throat

36:24.780 --> 36:26.220
 that keeps us alive.

36:27.220 --> 36:30.140
 As I actually took a sip of water,

36:30.140 --> 36:35.140
 it makes you appreciate the wonderful machinery of it all.

36:36.980 --> 36:39.580
 By the way, we have pulled up your Instagram

36:39.580 --> 36:41.100
 that people should follow.

36:41.100 --> 36:44.140
 You have a post about the throat

36:44.140 --> 36:47.660
 and just showing so many different components

36:47.660 --> 36:52.300
 from the tongue to the trachea, the esophagus,

36:52.300 --> 36:54.780
 just the entire machinery of it all.

36:56.500 --> 37:00.460
 The teeth for the chewing, it's so interesting.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.820
 And so a lot of the structure of this,

37:02.820 --> 37:05.500
 the anatomy and the physiology,

37:05.500 --> 37:07.580
 does it echo other mammals?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.780
 So are we just basically borrowing

37:10.780 --> 37:12.060
 a lot of stuff from evolution

37:12.060 --> 37:14.500
 and maybe making small adjustments,

37:14.500 --> 37:17.300
 maybe due to the fact that we're not using our mouth

37:17.300 --> 37:21.580
 to murder things as other predators might?

37:22.500 --> 37:23.780
 We use our thumbs.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.820
 Exactly, we have hands, we don't need to bite them.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.260
 Yeah, there's a lot of overlap

37:28.260 --> 37:29.820
 between different animals,

37:29.820 --> 37:32.940
 which I find very comforting and fascinating.

37:32.940 --> 37:33.780
 Someone asked me,

37:33.780 --> 37:36.660
 is there any animal in which the throat is better designed?

37:36.660 --> 37:38.540
 And my first thought was whales,

37:38.540 --> 37:40.740
 because the blow holes kind of up on the top of their head.

37:40.740 --> 37:44.260
 So I was thinking, oh, maybe they are more separate.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.220
 But when I looked into it,

37:45.220 --> 37:48.260
 I actually know the paths do come very close,

37:48.260 --> 37:49.100
 just like in us.

37:49.100 --> 37:53.260
 And I saw a paper about some new discovered organ

37:53.260 --> 37:55.340
 that actually helps keep food and drink

37:55.340 --> 37:56.740
 out of the airway in whales

37:56.740 --> 37:58.260
 that they hadn't ever noticed before.

37:58.260 --> 37:59.980
 So it's a different mechanism,

37:59.980 --> 38:01.860
 but the same kind of basic problem

38:01.860 --> 38:04.580
 is that we're tubes and the air tube

38:04.580 --> 38:06.540
 and food tube are right next to each other.

38:06.540 --> 38:07.980
 How well do we understand,

38:07.980 --> 38:10.380
 so just even lingering this little part,

38:10.380 --> 38:12.100
 is there still some mysteries

38:12.100 --> 38:13.780
 about the complexity of the system?

38:13.780 --> 38:16.380
 Because you mentioned just even for swallowing

38:16.380 --> 38:18.500
 all these parts in the brain that are responsible

38:18.500 --> 38:20.700
 and all the different things that have to,

38:20.700 --> 38:22.740
 like an orchestra play together.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.620
 Do we have a good sense

38:24.620 --> 38:26.300
 from both a medical perspective

38:26.300 --> 38:27.860
 and a biology perspective,

38:27.860 --> 38:29.060
 or is there still mysteries?

38:29.060 --> 38:30.420
 There's definitely still mysteries.

38:30.420 --> 38:32.420
 We understand a lot about, for instance,

38:32.420 --> 38:35.300
 how the swallowing mechanism is coordinated

38:35.300 --> 38:37.140
 in the brainstem,

38:37.140 --> 38:40.100
 sometimes using some higher levels of the brain.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.020
 But it is a very thoughtless thing,

38:42.020 --> 38:43.980
 as you mentioned when you drank the water.

38:43.980 --> 38:45.820
 It's not something we have to think about, thankfully,

38:45.820 --> 38:47.660
 or we'd be thinking about it all day.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.100
 There's a lot we don't understand

38:50.100 --> 38:51.420
 about the basic mechanisms,

38:51.420 --> 38:53.940
 perhaps about how the nerves fire

38:53.940 --> 38:58.260
 and how they coordinate on the microscopic level,

38:58.260 --> 39:01.220
 how ions rush into and out of nerve cells

39:01.220 --> 39:03.180
 to kind of create that electrical signal.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.660
 But we sure understand a heck of a lot,

39:05.660 --> 39:07.860
 and it's very fascinating.

39:07.860 --> 39:12.140
 So moving on to chapter two, we'll jump around.

39:12.140 --> 39:17.140
 And you actually said the liver does a lot of things.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.580
 I also saw you retweet something

39:21.100 --> 39:23.420
 where it said, you know,

39:23.420 --> 39:25.900
 showing that the liver is bigger than the heart,

39:25.900 --> 39:28.980
 which is the body or the universe's way of saying

39:28.980 --> 39:32.740
 you should drink more and care less, which is a good line.

39:32.740 --> 39:36.900
 So you give props, like you said,

39:36.900 --> 39:38.140
 to the kidney, to the liver,

39:38.140 --> 39:41.340
 to the maybe, to the organs, to the parts

39:41.340 --> 39:44.820
 that don't often get as much credit as they deserve.

39:44.820 --> 39:48.380
 But let us go for time to the human heart.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.680
 We'll get chest pain.

39:52.860 --> 39:55.700
 We talk about it when we talk about love for some reason.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.700
 Why do we talk about the heart when we talk about love?

39:58.700 --> 40:01.500
 There sometimes can actually be some chest pain involved

40:01.500 --> 40:02.340
 in love.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.740
 I remember when I was a med student,

40:03.740 --> 40:06.780
 I was very smitten with another medical student.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.260
 He was totally brilliant and beautiful.

40:09.260 --> 40:11.700
 And it actually does cause this kind of burning

40:11.700 --> 40:12.540
 in your chest.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.700
 I don't know what that is.

40:13.700 --> 40:16.020
 I don't think it's from the heart itself.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.740
 I don't know if it was like acid reflux

40:17.740 --> 40:18.580
 because I was so nervous.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.020
 I'm not really sure.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.500
 But I definitely felt something in my chest

40:22.500 --> 40:23.660
 whenever I saw her.

40:23.660 --> 40:24.700
 I don't know what that is,

40:24.700 --> 40:26.740
 but you could see why someone might think,

40:26.740 --> 40:28.140
 oh, you know, maybe it is your heart.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.340
 That's kind of the most prominent organ in your chest.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.220
 And when people come to the ER with chest pain,

40:32.220 --> 40:33.940
 you know, the big question is, is it my heart?

40:33.940 --> 40:36.900
 And that's my main job is figuring out if it is or not.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.460
 So I could see why, you know,

40:39.460 --> 40:42.260
 the way ancients saw the functions of different organs

40:42.260 --> 40:46.300
 is fascinating, but often hard to explain.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.700
 Would it be fair to say that if you look at the entirety

40:49.700 --> 40:53.260
 of human history, the way most people die

40:53.260 --> 40:55.460
 has to do with the heart?

40:55.460 --> 40:58.100
 Well, like in America today,

40:58.100 --> 41:01.460
 cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease

41:01.460 --> 41:02.580
 is one of the most common,

41:02.580 --> 41:04.780
 perhaps the most common cause of death,

41:04.780 --> 41:07.300
 you know, a hundred years ago, 200 years ago,

41:07.300 --> 41:09.700
 it was probably not, people were not living as long

41:09.700 --> 41:11.420
 and people were dying of infections

41:11.420 --> 41:14.220
 that we tend to die less of these days.

41:14.220 --> 41:15.260
 Sure.

41:15.260 --> 41:17.940
 That's true, but in terms of things to stab.

41:18.940 --> 41:21.140
 So I'm trying to sort of introspect like,

41:21.140 --> 41:24.580
 why talk about the heart and love?

41:25.500 --> 41:28.260
 My thought would be that is because

41:28.260 --> 41:31.780
 the heart was seen as the most important organism.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.740
 It would be like the origin of life comes from the heart,

41:35.740 --> 41:38.340
 the originator of life and the way you figure that out

41:38.340 --> 41:40.620
 from sort of an ancient perspective

41:40.620 --> 41:45.620
 is when you stab things, what is likely to lead to issues.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.740
 It's like, it's possible to imagine that the brain

41:48.740 --> 41:50.980
 is not as special as we might think

41:50.980 --> 41:54.580
 from when you don't understand modern biology

41:54.580 --> 41:58.660
 or physiology or neuroscience, all those kinds of things,

41:58.660 --> 42:01.980
 especially cause pain, you know, it's painless too.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.580
 If you stab it, the brain, I mean.

42:07.540 --> 42:09.900
 Yeah, anyway, so that's really interesting.

42:09.900 --> 42:13.460
 I'm sure there's a kind of a poetic answer to

42:13.460 --> 42:15.260
 maybe the way people wrote about it,

42:15.260 --> 42:20.260
 but what to you is the wisdom in the design of the heart?

42:20.660 --> 42:22.460
 I mean, the main function of the heart basically

42:22.460 --> 42:25.260
 is to push blood through the cardiovascular system,

42:25.260 --> 42:27.780
 through the branching blood vessels

42:27.780 --> 42:30.380
 to feed every cell in the body.

42:30.380 --> 42:33.260
 You know, when I believe our ancestors started off

42:33.260 --> 42:37.300
 as single celled organisms floating in some ancient brew

42:37.300 --> 42:39.340
 and they were surrounded by the medium

42:39.340 --> 42:41.020
 that would bring them all the nutrients they needed.

42:41.020 --> 42:42.500
 So there's no issues there.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.380
 And then once you start getting multicellular organisms,

42:45.380 --> 42:47.780
 the kind that are thicker and the ones on the inside

42:47.780 --> 42:50.540
 aren't in contact with that sort of nutritious brew

42:50.540 --> 42:53.180
 that they're growing in, you kind of need a way

42:53.180 --> 42:55.540
 to distribute those nutrients to every cell.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.580
 And so that's what the heart

42:56.580 --> 42:58.580
 and the branching vascular tree do.

42:58.580 --> 43:02.460
 So the heart, you know, it's the biggest disconnect

43:02.460 --> 43:04.580
 between how the organs talked about in poetry

43:04.580 --> 43:06.900
 and through history versus this actual function

43:06.900 --> 43:09.180
 is probably the heart because we ascribe all these things

43:09.180 --> 43:13.260
 like love and passion and life itself sometimes to the heart.

43:13.260 --> 43:15.740
 But actually it's just a simple mechanical pump.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.180
 You know, that's all it is.

43:17.180 --> 43:18.700
 I don't want to downplay it, it's amazing.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.420
 But you know, it just pushes.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.540
 It fills the blood and then squeezes it.

43:22.540 --> 43:23.580
 Fills the blood and squeezes it.

43:23.580 --> 43:25.260
 And just that squeezing, that pushing

43:25.260 --> 43:27.220
 creates the blood pressure

43:27.220 --> 43:29.740
 that you need to get blood to every cell in your body,

43:29.740 --> 43:31.220
 especially when you're standing upright

43:31.220 --> 43:32.780
 to get blood to your brain,

43:32.780 --> 43:35.500
 you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there.

43:35.500 --> 43:39.300
 Isn't it amazing to you how much volume of blood

43:39.300 --> 43:42.980
 just gets pushed through by this pump?

43:42.980 --> 43:45.140
 Absolutely, they say every red blood cell

43:45.140 --> 43:47.300
 takes about five minutes to circulate

43:47.300 --> 43:48.820
 and come back to the heart.

43:48.820 --> 43:50.460
 And that circulation kind of, you know,

43:50.460 --> 43:52.820
 starts in the womb and continues

43:52.820 --> 43:55.580
 and kind of until the moment that we die.

43:55.580 --> 43:56.900
 But the volume is tremendous

43:56.900 --> 44:00.180
 and it can never, you know, take a break basically.

44:00.180 --> 44:03.020
 And it's sort of propagating

44:03.020 --> 44:04.540
 all kinds of stuff throughout the body.

44:04.540 --> 44:06.140
 It's a delivery mechanism,

44:06.140 --> 44:09.740
 blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad stuff,

44:09.740 --> 44:13.820
 nutrition, drugs, all of that.

44:13.820 --> 44:15.180
 Right, medications too.

44:15.180 --> 44:19.060
 Medications, such a fascinating design.

44:19.060 --> 44:20.740
 And it also takes the waste away.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.940
 You know, it kind of brings the nutritious stuff,

44:22.940 --> 44:24.620
 brings the nutrients, especially oxygen,

44:24.620 --> 44:25.540
 but many other things.

44:25.540 --> 44:27.580
 And then it also, as it passes,

44:27.580 --> 44:29.060
 the cell takes the cells waste.

44:29.060 --> 44:30.940
 So it's sort of the freshwater

44:30.940 --> 44:33.500
 and the sewage system in one.

44:33.500 --> 44:38.500
 So about blood, what to use fascinating about blood?

44:38.820 --> 44:41.780
 So we talk about the pump that spreads the blood,

44:41.780 --> 44:43.220
 but the blood itself.

44:43.220 --> 44:44.980
 Right, so the blood itself is sort of,

44:44.980 --> 44:48.060
 I mean, it's the most important bodily fluid, of course.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.300
 From moment to moment,

44:49.300 --> 44:52.060
 every cell in the body needs a flow of blood

44:53.340 --> 44:55.380
 to bring it most importantly oxygen,

44:55.380 --> 44:57.060
 but also again, all the other nutrients

44:57.060 --> 44:58.020
 and to take away waste.

44:58.020 --> 45:00.260
 And if that stops for even a few moments,

45:00.260 --> 45:02.380
 you can be in big trouble.

45:02.380 --> 45:05.780
 So blood is sort of the most important medium.

45:05.780 --> 45:09.300
 It's also, doctors use it to kind of evaluate the body.

45:09.300 --> 45:12.620
 It does have this kind of all seeing quality to it

45:12.620 --> 45:16.740
 where we can evaluate organs through the blood.

45:16.740 --> 45:18.380
 I can tell you about your liver, your heart,

45:18.380 --> 45:21.220
 your kidney just by taking a sample of your blood.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.820
 So it's sort of like this crystal ball in a way.

45:23.820 --> 45:25.980
 And we use it kind of all the time,

45:25.980 --> 45:29.060
 to assess someone's health, to assess their disease.

45:29.060 --> 45:34.060
 Is it also the attack vector for diseases,

45:34.500 --> 45:37.660
 for bacteria, for viruses and all that kind of stuff.

45:37.660 --> 45:40.460
 So viruses seem to attack either the throat,

45:40.460 --> 45:41.460
 maybe you can correct me,

45:41.460 --> 45:44.140
 but they seem to attack different parts of the body,

45:44.140 --> 45:46.180
 depending on how easy it is to access

45:46.180 --> 45:50.540
 and how easy it is to get in deep,

45:50.540 --> 45:52.260
 depending on what you prefer.

45:52.260 --> 45:54.380
 If you want to do a little bit of hard work,

45:54.380 --> 45:55.900
 but you get in deep,

45:55.900 --> 45:58.540
 or you don't want to do the hard work,

45:58.540 --> 45:59.820
 but you don't get in deep,

45:59.820 --> 46:01.300
 those are the choices viruses have.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.340
 But is blood one of the sort of attack vectors?

46:04.340 --> 46:05.580
 What's like, if you were trying to break

46:05.580 --> 46:06.860
 into the human body,

46:08.420 --> 46:11.900
 like a parasite, a virus, a bacteria,

46:11.900 --> 46:13.020
 how would you do it?

46:13.020 --> 46:13.860
 Like what would you,

46:13.860 --> 46:16.460
 what would be the attack vectors you would explore?

46:16.460 --> 46:19.620
 So you got to look for the body's weaknesses, of course.

46:19.620 --> 46:21.020
 We have inherent weaknesses,

46:21.020 --> 46:22.900
 for instance, like our respiratory tract,

46:22.900 --> 46:23.860
 we have to breathe,

46:23.860 --> 46:26.620
 we have to get air in from the outside.

46:26.620 --> 46:28.660
 And so that's one of the entries into the body.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.300
 And so when we inhale, let's say a poisonous gas,

46:32.300 --> 46:34.420
 it's an easy way in, you have to breathe,

46:34.420 --> 46:35.860
 can't hold your breath very long,

46:35.860 --> 46:39.780
 but air in our lungs is still kind of contiguous

46:39.780 --> 46:41.380
 with the external atmosphere.

46:41.380 --> 46:42.740
 It's not really inside the body

46:42.740 --> 46:46.660
 until it does cross across the lining of the alveoli

46:46.660 --> 46:47.860
 into the blood, as you said,

46:47.860 --> 46:49.980
 that's when it really gets inside.

46:49.980 --> 46:51.460
 And the other besides the respiratory tract,

46:51.460 --> 46:53.940
 the gastrointestinal tract is another way,

46:53.940 --> 46:55.420
 kind of a chink in the armor,

46:55.420 --> 46:57.500
 we have to eat, we have to drink,

46:57.500 --> 46:59.380
 and therefore we're taking the external world

46:59.380 --> 47:01.340
 into ourselves, into our gut,

47:01.340 --> 47:03.140
 in order to extract from it what we need

47:03.140 --> 47:05.340
 and let the rest kind of flow out.

47:05.340 --> 47:08.260
 So those two, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract,

47:08.260 --> 47:11.300
 there's a reason that respiratory tract infections

47:11.300 --> 47:12.980
 and gastrointestinal infections

47:12.980 --> 47:15.260
 are kind of the most common that afflict us

47:15.260 --> 47:17.780
 because those are the ways in to the body.

47:17.780 --> 47:20.140
 So I would definitely pick one of those,

47:20.140 --> 47:22.100
 not just be a lazy cold in the nose,

47:22.100 --> 47:24.460
 but really a more aggressive pneumonia down deep

47:24.460 --> 47:27.060
 in the lungs and get across that barrier into the blood.

47:27.060 --> 47:32.060
 But also the whole sex thing that humans do.

47:32.140 --> 47:36.220
 So speaking of which, let us go for time

47:36.220 --> 47:38.500
 to the genitals chapter.

47:38.500 --> 47:41.300
 So what are genitals?

47:41.300 --> 47:43.380
 I think I've heard of those.

47:43.380 --> 47:45.980
 I think I've read about a penis and a vagina.

47:45.980 --> 47:48.940
 Can you explain to me how those work?

47:48.940 --> 47:50.220
 Just asking for a friend,

47:50.220 --> 47:54.220
 but also what to use, fascinating about it

47:54.220 --> 47:58.820
 and maybe what's misunderstood or little known about them?

48:00.180 --> 48:02.620
 Sure, so they're very unique organs.

48:02.620 --> 48:05.620
 I would say one of the things that I like to point out

48:05.620 --> 48:08.700
 is that while every organ from moment to moment

48:08.700 --> 48:10.860
 keeps us alive and ensures our survival,

48:10.860 --> 48:13.780
 the genitals are in a way the opposite.

48:13.780 --> 48:15.700
 We don't need them from moment to moment.

48:15.700 --> 48:17.900
 You don't even have to use them at all.

48:17.900 --> 48:20.060
 And in fact, they often make us do stupid things

48:20.060 --> 48:23.140
 that are the opposite of kind of enhancing survival.

48:23.140 --> 48:26.460
 So, and they've affected the brain

48:26.460 --> 48:29.140
 and you can become sort of focused and nuts

48:29.140 --> 48:31.900
 based on those desires that kind of stem from the genitals.

48:31.900 --> 48:34.060
 So they can be dangerous organs too.

48:34.060 --> 48:39.060
 But I mean, sexual dimorphism helps with genetic variability

48:39.540 --> 48:41.820
 as it does in so many other organisms.

48:41.820 --> 48:43.620
 You take two people and mix them together.

48:43.620 --> 48:44.460
 They're genetics.

48:44.460 --> 48:46.100
 You just get a lot more variation

48:46.100 --> 48:50.460
 and more opportunities to try different genetic codes

48:50.460 --> 48:52.180
 and see what'll enhance survival

48:52.180 --> 48:54.380
 as we talked about sex and death.

48:54.380 --> 48:55.980
 I talk about in the book a lot of,

48:55.980 --> 48:57.780
 for instance, the female genital tract,

48:57.780 --> 49:00.140
 how the uterus is very unusual

49:00.140 --> 49:02.780
 because it doesn't even sort of wake up

49:02.780 --> 49:06.340
 and start doing its thing until the second decade of life.

49:06.340 --> 49:10.860
 Even though babies, female babies are born

49:10.860 --> 49:13.060
 with all of the eggs they'll ever have

49:13.060 --> 49:14.300
 in their ovaries already.

49:14.300 --> 49:15.980
 They're just sort of in this stasis

49:15.980 --> 49:19.020
 until they start waking up kind of once a month.

49:19.020 --> 49:20.500
 And it's this cycle.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
 There's so much in our bodies that are cyclical

49:22.500 --> 49:25.340
 and rhythmic, the heartbeat, the breathing,

49:25.340 --> 49:28.660
 but menstruation is kind of a very strange rhythm

49:28.660 --> 49:31.340
 that takes over a decade to start.

49:31.340 --> 49:34.100
 And only the rhythm beats once a month,

49:34.100 --> 49:37.500
 which is very slow compared to every other rhythm of the body.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.340
 The other unusual thing is in medicine,

49:40.340 --> 49:43.300
 when rhythms of the body cease, when they stop,

49:43.300 --> 49:44.740
 those are emergencies, right?

49:44.740 --> 49:47.020
 When your heart stops, that's a cardiac arrest.

49:47.020 --> 49:50.180
 You need CPR, maybe an electric shock to restart it.

49:50.180 --> 49:51.940
 When your breathing stops,

49:51.940 --> 49:53.700
 you need a breathing machine to breathe for you

49:53.700 --> 49:56.100
 or something to reverse whatever might be causing

49:56.100 --> 49:58.100
 the suppression of your breathing.

49:58.100 --> 49:59.980
 But when the menstruation stops,

49:59.980 --> 50:03.500
 it's the point of menstruation in the first place.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.180
 The whole reason that the uterus grows aligning

50:06.180 --> 50:08.460
 and sheds it each month is to one day,

50:08.460 --> 50:10.580
 you know, get fertile,

50:10.580 --> 50:11.700
 though of them to get fertilized

50:11.700 --> 50:13.460
 and for it to implant in the lining.

50:13.460 --> 50:14.540
 And then the rhythm ceases.

50:14.540 --> 50:16.620
 And that's obviously not a medical emergency,

50:16.620 --> 50:18.500
 unlike most other rhythms, you know,

50:18.500 --> 50:20.620
 cessations, it's the point of the whole thing

50:20.620 --> 50:21.540
 in the first place.

50:21.540 --> 50:24.460
 So these particular penis and vagina

50:24.460 --> 50:26.940
 are that whole thing, the uterus, whatever.

50:26.940 --> 50:28.980
 Am I not using the wrong terms?

50:28.980 --> 50:31.060
 I don't know, I'll just keep saying.

50:31.060 --> 50:32.220
 You use those terms.

50:32.220 --> 50:35.300
 There's more technical, there's parts, various parts.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.020
 In medical school, you learn every bump

50:38.020 --> 50:40.900
 and you know, every little part of every little organ

50:40.900 --> 50:42.740
 and including the genitals, so.

50:43.860 --> 50:46.580
 I never really thought of it this way.

50:46.580 --> 50:49.020
 As you said, is that most organs

50:49.020 --> 50:51.460
 are kind of full time employees.

50:51.460 --> 50:54.300
 Like 24 seven, they're doing something.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.060
 And then there's some organs,

50:56.060 --> 51:00.900
 penis and vagina being representative of this.

51:00.900 --> 51:03.260
 They're not functioning all the time.

51:03.260 --> 51:05.380
 They're only functioning every once in a while

51:05.380 --> 51:07.740
 and then get us to do stupid stuff

51:07.740 --> 51:09.540
 or awesome stuff and all that kind of stuff.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.700
 But they're not essential for human survival

51:11.700 --> 51:14.220
 on a second by second basis.

51:14.220 --> 51:18.300
 Then the whole cyclical nature of the human body.

51:18.300 --> 51:20.900
 How many other cycles are on a monthly basis?

51:20.900 --> 51:23.380
 Like that far apart.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.820
 That's a fascinating design

51:25.820 --> 51:27.100
 that the human body would do that

51:27.100 --> 51:32.100
 and wouldn't start until the second decade of life.

51:32.460 --> 51:35.740
 It's almost like, what do I wanna say?

51:35.740 --> 51:39.940
 There's some kind of meta planning going on.

51:39.940 --> 51:41.900
 Like this is the optimal solution

51:41.900 --> 51:44.420
 for the sexual selection mechanism

51:44.420 --> 51:48.380
 among like somewhat intelligent species.

51:48.380 --> 51:53.380
 Like it's useful to after the brain has developed

51:53.380 --> 51:57.100
 sufficiently long to now be making

51:57.100 --> 51:58.980
 sexual selection decisions.

51:58.980 --> 52:01.540
 Like you need time for this computer,

52:01.540 --> 52:04.340
 this really powerful computer to load in the info.

52:05.780 --> 52:06.620
 Interesting.

52:06.620 --> 52:08.420
 You also need the body to develop.

52:08.420 --> 52:11.780
 A child simply isn't big enough to be pregnant

52:11.780 --> 52:14.420
 and deliver another baby.

52:14.420 --> 52:16.020
 I wonder if there's animals in which

52:16.020 --> 52:17.860
 this happens much more accelerated pace

52:17.860 --> 52:19.260
 in different stages.

52:19.260 --> 52:21.620
 Definitely, especially certain kinds of insects

52:21.620 --> 52:25.300
 like Drosophila, a lot of the fruit fly,

52:25.300 --> 52:26.580
 a lot of experiments are done on

52:26.580 --> 52:28.740
 because their life cycle is so rapid.

52:28.740 --> 52:31.340
 A lot of insects and other creatures

52:31.340 --> 52:33.540
 are almost ready to mate as soon as they're born.

52:34.540 --> 52:35.580
 Not us.

52:35.580 --> 52:36.620
 Not us.

52:36.620 --> 52:41.620
 Is there any improvements to the design?

52:42.740 --> 52:45.380
 So a lot of people are very interested

52:45.380 --> 52:47.780
 in these particular body parts.

52:47.780 --> 52:49.620
 If you were to sort of step back

52:49.620 --> 52:52.980
 as a geneticist, biological designer,

52:52.980 --> 52:55.500
 or maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer,

52:55.500 --> 53:00.500
 trying to build human 2.0 or maybe a robot,

53:00.620 --> 53:04.220
 how would you improve the penis and the vagina?

53:05.380 --> 53:06.780
 Well, the penis for starters,

53:06.780 --> 53:09.460
 I mean, let's also discuss the testicles.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.780
 They're very important too.

53:10.780 --> 53:14.740
 Which, okay, so they're fragile and they're important

53:14.740 --> 53:18.060
 and yet they're hanging off the body in danger, basically.

53:18.060 --> 53:20.300
 So does that make sense?

53:20.300 --> 53:22.020
 You know, they begin in the womb,

53:22.020 --> 53:23.420
 they begin inside the abdomen

53:23.420 --> 53:26.620
 and they slowly descend and sometimes before birth,

53:26.620 --> 53:29.100
 sometimes in the first year of life, sometimes never.

53:29.100 --> 53:30.740
 They pop out of the body

53:30.740 --> 53:32.700
 and end up hanging in the scrotum.

53:32.700 --> 53:35.060
 There's a reason because the chemical reactions

53:35.060 --> 53:37.700
 that create sperm function best

53:37.700 --> 53:40.860
 at a few degrees cooler than body temperature.

53:40.860 --> 53:44.620
 And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather,

53:44.620 --> 53:47.540
 they might hang further down and in the cold weather,

53:47.540 --> 53:50.340
 they scrunch themselves up to get closer to the body

53:50.340 --> 53:53.500
 to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.260
 So it's hard, you know,

53:56.260 --> 53:58.300
 if you could create a sperm production mechanism

53:58.300 --> 54:00.100
 that did not rely on that lower temperature,

54:00.100 --> 54:00.940
 that would be great.

54:00.940 --> 54:04.460
 Keep them inside the body protected like the ovaries are.

54:04.460 --> 54:07.140
 But oh, then you wouldn't rely on the lower temperature.

54:07.140 --> 54:08.700
 I thought you meant create

54:08.700 --> 54:11.940
 some kind of weird internal cooling mechanism.

54:11.940 --> 54:14.500
 No, well, I guess that would be one solution,

54:14.500 --> 54:18.100
 but just maybe a different type of chemical reaction

54:18.100 --> 54:21.900
 would not be reliant on the lower temperature, let's say.

54:21.900 --> 54:25.180
 You know, it would be great to design sperm metagenesis

54:25.180 --> 54:26.820
 or sperm production process

54:26.820 --> 54:29.260
 that would function best at body temperature.

54:29.260 --> 54:32.580
 And then we can keep those delicate organs inside the body

54:32.580 --> 54:35.220
 and not have them hanging out in danger.

54:35.220 --> 54:40.220
 Or maybe the argument for this design is maybe it's nice

54:40.220 --> 54:45.180
 to put them in danger so you are constantly concerned about it.

54:45.180 --> 54:49.100
 Could be, maybe that's beneficial for male psychology.

54:49.100 --> 54:50.140
 I'm not really sure.

54:50.140 --> 54:51.620
 There's a psychological element here

54:51.620 --> 54:53.340
 about the evolution that could be.

54:53.340 --> 54:57.260
 So that's the testicle's penis.

54:58.780 --> 55:00.660
 A better way to do it, you know?

55:00.660 --> 55:03.340
 I mean, it's pretty good as it is, you know,

55:03.340 --> 55:05.740
 it kind of when it's time for it to work,

55:05.740 --> 55:07.460
 it grows and stiffens.

55:07.460 --> 55:08.940
 And when it's time for it not to work,

55:08.940 --> 55:11.940
 it kind of shrinks and hangs out.

55:12.940 --> 55:15.260
 Saw this on a Seinfeld episode.

55:15.260 --> 55:17.260
 So I know how it works.

55:17.260 --> 55:18.180
 Shrinkage.

55:18.180 --> 55:19.420
 Yeah, that was a good one.

55:19.420 --> 55:22.940
 But, you know, that's also a bit unique,

55:22.940 --> 55:26.540
 I suppose that, you know, the way it has this erectile tissue.

55:26.540 --> 55:30.700
 Actually, they're similar in the mouth of certain baleen whales.

55:30.700 --> 55:34.100
 There's a certain similar kind of erectile tissue

55:34.100 --> 55:37.580
 that helps cool them off

55:37.580 --> 55:39.740
 because they have so much blubber

55:39.740 --> 55:42.620
 and create so much heat in moving around and feeding

55:42.620 --> 55:43.980
 that they have actually a similar,

55:43.980 --> 55:45.660
 similar to the penis organ in their mouth

55:45.660 --> 55:48.100
 that helps cool their bodies because it's a big problem.

55:48.100 --> 55:50.980
 They have to store all that blubber for fuel,

55:50.980 --> 55:52.140
 but it makes them too hot.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.100
 So as a compensation,

55:53.100 --> 55:55.300
 they have this kind of erectile organ in their mouth.

55:55.300 --> 55:59.140
 Okay, what about vagina?

55:59.140 --> 56:02.860
 You know, the fact that miscarriages sometimes happen

56:02.860 --> 56:05.740
 because of sexually transmitted diseases,

56:05.740 --> 56:08.020
 because of trauma, you know, it'd be great

56:08.020 --> 56:11.260
 if the uterus where the growing fetus is

56:11.260 --> 56:13.940
 is sort of even more protected from those things.

56:15.700 --> 56:18.060
 You know, I guess that's a side effect

56:18.060 --> 56:20.140
 of the fact that people still have sex

56:20.140 --> 56:23.140
 when they're pregnant or still exposed to injury.

56:23.140 --> 56:25.380
 There was a way to make it more protected,

56:25.380 --> 56:27.460
 perhaps that would be even better.

56:27.460 --> 56:30.460
 I did see an article recently about artificial wombs,

56:30.460 --> 56:33.700
 which are rapidly becoming a reality.

56:33.700 --> 56:35.300
 And in animal studies,

56:35.300 --> 56:37.740
 they're able to prolong the gestation of a fetus

56:37.740 --> 56:40.740
 by a month in an artificial womb.

56:40.740 --> 56:42.700
 Can you explain the artificial aspect

56:42.700 --> 56:43.660
 of the artificial womb?

56:43.660 --> 56:45.420
 Sure, it's...

56:45.420 --> 56:49.100
 I believe it acts almost like a heart lung bypass machine.

56:49.100 --> 56:51.940
 So when someone's getting bypass surgery,

56:51.940 --> 56:53.340
 their heart is stopped.

56:53.340 --> 56:55.100
 Literally, they throw ice in the chest

56:55.100 --> 56:58.660
 and they give a potassium infusion through the blood,

56:58.660 --> 57:00.020
 which stops the heart.

57:01.020 --> 57:04.180
 But the blood is run through a machine

57:04.180 --> 57:07.980
 that basically does the work of the heart and lungs together.

57:07.980 --> 57:09.340
 It gets oxygen into the blood

57:09.340 --> 57:11.780
 and then pushes it back into the body.

57:11.780 --> 57:14.060
 So I believe it's a sort of similar mechanism

57:14.060 --> 57:16.900
 to keep blood and nutrition flowing to this fetus.

57:18.100 --> 57:20.860
 And so it's just not inside the body of a parent.

57:20.860 --> 57:23.300
 It's in some kind of other device,

57:23.300 --> 57:27.140
 but I think that science is gonna rapidly improve.

57:27.140 --> 57:29.900
 One benefit is babies are born premature

57:29.900 --> 57:34.100
 and while neonatology is able to continuously

57:34.100 --> 57:36.140
 kind of lower the age of viability

57:36.140 --> 57:38.060
 through better technology and understanding

57:38.060 --> 57:40.700
 how what you can medicines and other things

57:40.700 --> 57:43.460
 you can do to premature babies when they're born.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.220
 Ideally, if let's say premature labor begins,

57:46.220 --> 57:47.940
 you can't stop it.

57:47.940 --> 57:49.700
 That baby's coming out one way or the other

57:49.700 --> 57:51.980
 if you could just then stick it into an artificial womb

57:51.980 --> 57:54.420
 where it can continue its development.

57:54.420 --> 57:56.380
 That would save a whole host of problems off

57:56.380 --> 57:59.620
 and those babies born very early suffer from damage

57:59.620 --> 58:01.660
 to various organs, including the brain

58:01.660 --> 58:02.580
 for the rest of their life.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.980
 So that could be a very important technology.

58:04.980 --> 58:07.740
 So some aspects of the human body,

58:07.740 --> 58:10.380
 we can develop technologies that outsource them

58:10.380 --> 58:15.380
 sort of offload some of the stress

58:16.140 --> 58:19.780
 and the workload from the human body to do it elsewhere.

58:19.780 --> 58:21.820
 Like dialysis does that for kidneys.

58:21.820 --> 58:25.220
 People can live decades without kidneys

58:25.220 --> 58:29.020
 as long as they get dialysis, which does the work for them.

58:29.020 --> 58:30.460
 Not every organ can do that.

58:30.460 --> 58:33.580
 For instance, the liver, there's no dialysis version

58:33.580 --> 58:35.420
 for the liver, like if your liver fails,

58:35.420 --> 58:37.660
 you need a liver transplant and that's the only thing

58:37.660 --> 58:39.380
 that's gonna do it for you.

58:40.620 --> 58:45.620
 So that's the world's first artificial womb for humans.

58:45.660 --> 58:47.820
 And we're looking at a picture

58:47.820 --> 58:50.300
 of what looks like gigantic balloons.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.900
 Matrix, here we come.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.740
 This is very matrixy.

58:53.740 --> 58:55.460
 How are they floating?

58:55.460 --> 58:57.260
 What are we even looking at?

58:57.260 --> 59:00.380
 There's giants, red spheres.

59:00.380 --> 59:02.460
 This really looks like the matrix.

59:03.900 --> 59:04.740
 I wonder where it's from.

59:04.740 --> 59:07.700
 So there seems to be a paper on this too.

59:07.700 --> 59:10.660
 I don't know too much about it, but I did see that there.

59:10.660 --> 59:12.780
 It's advancing very rapidly.

59:12.780 --> 59:14.980
 The world's first artificial womb for humans.

59:14.980 --> 59:18.740
 Scientists in the Netherlands say they're within 10 years

59:18.740 --> 59:20.380
 of developing an artificial womb

59:20.380 --> 59:22.980
 that could save the lives of premature babies.

59:22.980 --> 59:24.980
 Premature births before 37 weeks

59:24.980 --> 59:27.660
 is globally the biggest cause of death among newborns,

59:27.660 --> 59:31.380
 but the development also raises ethical questions

59:31.380 --> 59:36.300
 about the future of baby making and so on and so forth.

59:36.300 --> 59:40.460
 Wow, we're going to be facing a lot of ethical questions

59:41.420 --> 59:45.820
 as we start to mess with human biology.

59:45.820 --> 59:50.500
 In an effort to help human biology,

59:50.500 --> 59:52.580
 we might start to mess with it.

59:52.580 --> 59:55.940
 As can be very interesting, let's take steps towards

59:58.140 --> 59:59.300
 towards the matrix.

1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:06.220
 All right, what about the neighbors, poop, feces?

1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:11.700
 There seems to be a lot of interesting stories

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:14.380
 in that particular output as well.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:20.300
 What to you is fascinating.

1:00:20.300 --> 1:00:25.300
 What do you maybe is misunderstood

1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:29.140
 or a little known about poop?

1:00:30.620 --> 1:00:33.820
 Well, it's hilarious for one thing that we do it.

1:00:33.820 --> 1:00:35.140
 Oh, okay.

1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:36.660
 The word is great as well.

1:00:36.660 --> 1:00:38.060
 There's so many different words.

1:00:38.060 --> 1:00:40.620
 I do, you know, when I'm talking to the parents

1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:42.780
 of pediatric patients, I use the word poop.

1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:44.620
 I don't often when I'm talking to adult patients

1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:49.620
 try to choose a more mature word, but poop is amazing.

1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:53.660
 I mean, I guess it's sort of the most, the dirtiest,

1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:57.540
 the most vile, the most hated aspect of our bodies.

1:00:57.540 --> 1:00:59.060
 It's the grossest.

1:00:59.060 --> 1:01:00.980
 We don't want to think about it, talk about it,

1:01:00.980 --> 1:01:05.980
 have it anywhere near our food or social interactions.

1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:09.860
 With good reason, I mentioned gastrointestinal infections

1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:11.340
 are one of the most common infections

1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:12.900
 the human body suffers from.

1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:17.220
 And what we call the way they spread from person to person

1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:20.620
 grossly enough is referred to as the fecal oral route,

1:01:20.620 --> 1:01:22.820
 which means a bit of someone's stool

1:01:22.820 --> 1:01:25.460
 is getting into your, you're swallowing it,

1:01:25.460 --> 1:01:27.860
 you know, through the water supply.

1:01:27.860 --> 1:01:29.620
 For instance, diarrhea is actually

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:32.780
 quite a brilliant mechanism of these microbes, right?

1:01:32.780 --> 1:01:35.700
 If you, let's say you're in the intestine of one person,

1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:38.860
 your goal is to get into the intestines of another person,

1:01:38.860 --> 1:01:41.580
 brilliant to just trick their intestines

1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:44.980
 into secreting all this fluid into the intestines

1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:46.580
 to increase the volume of stool

1:01:46.580 --> 1:01:48.860
 and its runniness so that when they do poop,

1:01:48.860 --> 1:01:50.100
 it gets into the water supply

1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:51.380
 and then everyone else kind of ends up

1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:52.780
 getting infected as well.

1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.380
 Wow, that's brilliant.

1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:55.940
 Just the same way like, you know,

1:01:55.940 --> 1:01:59.060
 tuberculosis or coronavirus kind of infects your lungs

1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:01.380
 and makes you cough and you send it out into the air

1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:02.740
 and it ends up in other people's lungs.

1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:04.580
 And that's all evolution.

1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:05.980
 Yeah, it's brilliant.

1:02:05.980 --> 1:02:10.980
 So diarrhea is intelligent, is a big takeaway lesson.

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:14.020
 It's one of the most intelligent things we can do

1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:16.020
 as an entirety of an organism,

1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:17.940
 not just the particular cognitive organism,

1:02:17.940 --> 1:02:21.500
 but there's, you know, we're made up of bacteria

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:24.340
 and viruses and there's a lot of visitors and so on.

1:02:24.340 --> 1:02:25.780
 As the entirety of the system,

1:02:25.780 --> 1:02:28.380
 diarrhea is one of our better accomplishments.

1:02:28.380 --> 1:02:29.340
 It's fascinating.

1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:33.540
 Why wonder, why is poop funny?

1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:37.060
 I think a lot of that is socially constructed,

1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:39.460
 just how it's sort of supposed to be hidden away

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:41.860
 yet something we always do, something, you know,

1:02:41.860 --> 1:02:44.140
 we chuckle about as children.

1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:46.860
 But even in healthcare, you know, it becomes this big

1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:48.140
 topic of conversation,

1:02:48.140 --> 1:02:50.380
 because you end up talking about it constantly.

1:02:50.380 --> 1:02:52.380
 Like in the ER, people come in,

1:02:53.620 --> 1:02:55.140
 there's complete strangers,

1:02:55.140 --> 1:02:58.740
 sometimes like a nice old lady who resembles my grandmother

1:02:58.740 --> 1:03:00.620
 and all of a sudden I have to ask her all about

1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:02.020
 what's happening in the bathroom,

1:03:02.020 --> 1:03:05.980
 like is she straining, what color is it, what, you know,

1:03:05.980 --> 1:03:07.860
 what's the consistency?

1:03:07.860 --> 1:03:10.340
 Does it float on top of the water more than it should?

1:03:10.340 --> 1:03:11.220
 Is it hard to flush?

1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:13.740
 I mean, there's a million different questions you learn

1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:17.420
 as a medical student and you're like this poop detective

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:19.380
 when people come in with issues.

1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:22.300
 And so it's funny, I guess, you know,

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:25.060
 in the exam room with the doctor patient relationship,

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:26.620
 there's sort of no barriers, you know,

1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:28.420
 you talk about everything and you're talking about

1:03:28.420 --> 1:03:31.380
 the most intimate details of a person's life,

1:03:31.380 --> 1:03:33.260
 even though you just met them a second ago,

1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:36.780
 it's so different than normal social interactions.

1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:38.940
 Yet there is this social aspect,

1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:40.700
 a lot of what I do is social, you know,

1:03:40.700 --> 1:03:43.900
 it seems like doctors, what they do is mostly scientific,

1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:46.540
 but actually it's just relating to another person

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:48.660
 and you have to maintain, you know,

1:03:48.660 --> 1:03:51.300
 your professional demeanor and this normal human level

1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:53.700
 interaction, even though you're talking about poop.

1:03:54.820 --> 1:03:57.460
 And that's a skill, that's an art and a science.

1:03:57.460 --> 1:03:59.620
 Well, okay, actually I wanna linger on that

1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:03.260
 because I'm a fan of just diving into conversations

1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:08.340
 right away with strangers, just getting no small talk.

1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:11.900
 And this is like the ultimate, I don't know if it's

1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:14.540
 the ultimate, but it's one version of no small talk.

1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:16.220
 You get right to the point.

1:04:18.180 --> 1:04:21.340
 That's really powerful from a psychology perspective.

1:04:21.340 --> 1:04:24.140
 You're a kind of therapist or you have the power

1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:26.140
 to be a therapist.

1:04:26.140 --> 1:04:28.780
 I don't mean just about the medical condition of the body,

1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:33.180
 but the psychological, there's so much fear connected

1:04:33.180 --> 1:04:35.860
 to this concern.

1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:40.860
 Also self doubt, insecurities,

1:04:42.780 --> 1:04:46.260
 even sort of existential thoughts about your mortality,

1:04:46.260 --> 1:04:48.860
 all of those things are right there in the room.

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:52.500
 So I think one way doctors deal with that

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.940
 is they kind of have this cold way about them.

1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:56.740
 They almost have a dual mode.

1:04:56.740 --> 1:05:00.860
 One is like, I'm going to be friendly on the surface

1:05:00.860 --> 1:05:05.860
 and cold about the brutal honesty of the biology.

1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:10.660
 But I wonder if there's like a skillful middle ground,

1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:16.100
 this dangerous place where you can help people deal

1:05:16.100 --> 1:05:19.260
 with their psychological insecurities, concerns,

1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:20.980
 fears, all those kinds of things.

1:05:20.980 --> 1:05:23.140
 Is that just really tough to do?

1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:26.700
 Yeah, it's a huge part of being a doctor is dealing

1:05:26.700 --> 1:05:29.300
 with the psychological aspects of whatever's going on

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:30.300
 with a patient's body.

1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:32.980
 I mean, in the ER, you deal with psychiatric emergencies

1:05:32.980 --> 1:05:35.540
 kind of left and right more than ever these days.

1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:37.420
 And that's a huge issue,

1:05:37.420 --> 1:05:41.540
 not to mention sort of drug use, alcohol related stuff.

1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:43.140
 That gets into sort of psychology

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:45.340
 and the human love of intoxicants

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:49.220
 and changing the brain's chemistry and in habit,

1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:50.700
 of course, where creatures of habit

1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:51.940
 and that plays in as well.

1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:53.340
 I mean, a big part of, for instance,

1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:56.180
 pediatrics is reassuring parents

1:05:56.180 --> 1:05:59.220
 and kind of convincing them,

1:05:59.220 --> 1:06:01.260
 giving them the confidence that what's going on

1:06:01.260 --> 1:06:03.940
 with their child is not serious, will go away on its own,

1:06:03.940 --> 1:06:06.500
 does not need any particular intervention.

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:11.500
 And but adults too, reassurance is a huge part of the game.

1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:17.620
 Yeah, in the ER, you see humanity at its most raw.

1:06:17.620 --> 1:06:20.980
 I feel like you get this tremendous insight into people,

1:06:20.980 --> 1:06:22.500
 how they live, what they worry about,

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:24.260
 what they think about, how their body works

1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:25.500
 and also how their mind works

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:28.340
 that you almost don't see anywhere else.

1:06:28.340 --> 1:06:31.140
 It's a really interesting place to work.

1:06:31.140 --> 1:06:33.180
 And also the way our society is shaped,

1:06:33.180 --> 1:06:35.700
 the ER is where people go for almost everything.

1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:37.980
 When they're suicidal, they come to the ER.

1:06:37.980 --> 1:06:39.740
 When they're too high on drugs to walk,

1:06:39.740 --> 1:06:40.860
 they come to the ER.

1:06:40.860 --> 1:06:42.980
 Children who have been abused, sexually abused,

1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:46.100
 physically abused come to the ER for us to investigate.

1:06:46.100 --> 1:06:48.580
 It's sort of like the all purpose waste spin

1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:49.980
 for the dregs of society,

1:06:49.980 --> 1:06:51.500
 what people do to themselves

1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:53.460
 and what they do to other people.

1:06:53.460 --> 1:06:55.620
 You mentioned you're interested in the darkness of humanity.

1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:58.940
 It made me think of the ER where you really see

1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:02.020
 what human life is like in the ER.

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:04.460
 Okay, you tweet about, you write about,

1:07:04.460 --> 1:07:07.700
 you think about the emergency room ER.

1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:09.140
 That's really fascinating.

1:07:10.140 --> 1:07:14.180
 Just the little window you give to that world is fascinating.

1:07:16.420 --> 1:07:20.620
 What lessons about humanity do you draw?

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:24.420
 From this place where you're so near to death,

1:07:24.420 --> 1:07:26.860
 there's so much chaos.

1:07:26.860 --> 1:07:29.180
 There's so much variety of what's wrong,

1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:34.180
 so little information or the urgent nature

1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:39.380
 of the information inflows such that you can't really reason

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.900
 sort of thoroughly and deeply and collect all the data

1:07:41.900 --> 1:07:44.300
 on those kinds of things, you have to act fast

1:07:44.300 --> 1:07:45.900
 and then everybody's freaking out.

1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:48.060
 Can you just speak to the human condition

1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:53.060
 that you get a glimpse at through the ER experience?

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:57.380
 Yeah, I think you do see all those things.

1:07:57.380 --> 1:08:00.340
 I think on one end of the spectrum,

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.060
 it is this very unique place

1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:03.780
 where you get all these unique insights.

1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:07.220
 On the other end, it can become a ho hum workplace

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:09.620
 just like any other, which is sort of surprising.

1:08:09.620 --> 1:08:10.460
 As I mentioned before,

1:08:10.460 --> 1:08:13.300
 humans seem to be able to get used to almost anything

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:15.500
 and doctors can get ho hum used to,

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:18.180
 oh, dying of a heart attack, oh, actively in labor

1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:21.620
 and the baby's half out, oh, just ho hum,

1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:24.140
 I know what to do, going about my job and go home

1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:25.980
 and have dinner with my family

1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:27.260
 and not think too much about it.

1:08:27.260 --> 1:08:28.540
 That's amazing.

1:08:28.540 --> 1:08:33.180
 I do try to maintain both my fascination.

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:35.780
 I think writers in general tend to think more

1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.580
 about what they see, write more about what they see,

1:08:37.580 --> 1:08:40.580
 maybe draw connections with what they see to other things.

1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:42.340
 So I do think that writer's perspective

1:08:42.340 --> 1:08:45.900
 does help me kind of maintain my fascination

1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:48.740
 and my kind of more of an insightful perspective

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:51.780
 than just a ho hum, water cooler conversation.

1:08:53.140 --> 1:08:54.380
 But you do see a lot.

1:08:55.900 --> 1:08:57.980
 In a way, medical problems are sort of

1:08:57.980 --> 1:09:00.140
 the great equalizer, right?

1:09:00.140 --> 1:09:03.140
 Class, race, culture, background,

1:09:03.140 --> 1:09:05.900
 the failings of the human body, the way it fails

1:09:05.900 --> 1:09:08.460
 and what we can do to help in those situations

1:09:08.460 --> 1:09:10.300
 is almost universal.

1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:11.820
 I always like this quote from,

1:09:11.820 --> 1:09:14.100
 Chekhov was a doctor and a writer

1:09:14.100 --> 1:09:19.100
 and he treated a lot of peasants, very low class

1:09:19.180 --> 1:09:20.820
 and also treated a lot of aristocrats

1:09:20.820 --> 1:09:24.220
 and he wrote that they all have the same ugly bodies,

1:09:24.220 --> 1:09:27.340
 basically, which I think is really right on.

1:09:27.340 --> 1:09:29.900
 And it's sort of, you can see people

1:09:29.900 --> 1:09:32.300
 underneath the superficial layer of clothing,

1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:34.060
 maybe it's the most expensive clothing

1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:35.660
 bought from the fanciest places,

1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:38.420
 but underneath their body is still failing in the same way

1:09:38.420 --> 1:09:39.980
 and they still have the same anxieties,

1:09:39.980 --> 1:09:41.900
 the same worry about mortality,

1:09:41.900 --> 1:09:45.500
 the same concerns about whether poop turned green today,

1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:47.340
 all these things that they bring to the table.

1:09:47.340 --> 1:09:49.940
 So in a way, it is this great equalizer

1:09:49.940 --> 1:09:52.500
 where people are kind of all the same in some ways.

1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:56.460
 Yeah, I feel like people sometimes,

1:09:56.460 --> 1:10:01.180
 class, money, fame, power,

1:10:01.180 --> 1:10:06.180
 makes you for time forget that you're just a meat vehicle.

1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:09.780
 And you're just as good and just as bad

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:13.220
 as the other meat vehicles all around you.

1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:18.140
 In that sense, there's this question sometimes raised,

1:10:18.140 --> 1:10:20.260
 are some people better than others?

1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:24.700
 And I usually answer no to that question because of that.

1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:26.580
 Yeah, some people might be better at math,

1:10:26.580 --> 1:10:29.500
 some people might be better at music,

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:31.720
 but in the end, we're just meat bags.

1:10:33.260 --> 1:10:34.980
 Beautiful as we are.

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:39.820
 There's a poem that just a small tangent I wanna take.

1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:44.820
 I just saw it just acting that you have written.

1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:49.980
 I have to, would you classify it as a poem?

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:50.900
 Yeah.

1:10:50.900 --> 1:10:53.220
 At first, if I may read it,

1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:55.860
 at first you enter the clinic shoulders weighed down

1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:59.860
 by white coat pockets, bookstuffed, timid.

1:10:59.860 --> 1:11:03.740
 You act out a role, your white coat, a costume,

1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:08.420
 your questions, a script, your demeanor, a rehearsed act.

1:11:08.420 --> 1:11:10.580
 No one is going to buy this.

1:11:10.580 --> 1:11:13.900
 But then as you play the role again and again,

1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.340
 repeating the lines and the motions,

1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:18.020
 the script slowly dissolves

1:11:18.020 --> 1:11:20.940
 and the interaction becomes thoughtless.

1:11:20.940 --> 1:11:24.340
 And the rehearsed act slowly fades into a profession.

1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:27.000
 You suddenly find yourself unable to tell

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:31.180
 if you're still acting or if you're doing it for real.

1:11:31.180 --> 1:11:33.660
 And now you're a doctor.

1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:36.300
 Jonathan Reisman, MD, Harvard,

1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:38.100
 Massachusetts General Hospital Medicine,

1:11:38.100 --> 1:11:40.020
 Pediatrics Department.

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:40.860
 Beautiful.

1:11:40.860 --> 1:11:44.180
 So that is what it is to be a doctor.

1:11:44.180 --> 1:11:46.420
 You're just acting, fake it till you make it.

1:11:46.420 --> 1:11:48.180
 Exactly, fake it till you make it.

1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:50.460
 And I think, I imagine every medical student

1:11:50.460 --> 1:11:53.060
 has this feeling when they first go into a room.

1:11:53.060 --> 1:11:56.140
 Like I talked about asking this nice old lady

1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:58.460
 about the color of her poop for the first time.

1:11:58.460 --> 1:12:00.340
 And you're just like, what am I doing here?

1:12:00.340 --> 1:12:02.660
 Like, does she believe I'm a doctor?

1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:04.540
 You know, this just feels absurd.

1:12:04.540 --> 1:12:07.760
 But then it's, again, how hum becomes normal.

1:12:09.100 --> 1:12:12.700
 Now, there's not a sperm chapter in your book.

1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:16.700
 This, you mentioned offline that this is a second

1:12:16.700 --> 1:12:18.820
 and a third book that you're working on

1:12:18.820 --> 1:12:19.660
 all about sperm.

1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:21.300
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:22.700
 But, or maybe I'm not.

1:12:23.980 --> 1:12:26.900
 Humor tends to make way for reality.

1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:32.580
 So the tweet was that an average human male

1:12:32.580 --> 1:12:36.140
 produces 500 billion sperm, I believe,

1:12:36.140 --> 1:12:39.340
 which is about four to five times more

1:12:39.340 --> 1:12:42.860
 than the number of people who have ever lived.

1:12:42.860 --> 1:12:45.740
 And each of those sperms is genetically unique.

1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:48.700
 So you can think of them, you can kind of imagine

1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:51.020
 the possible humans they could have created.

1:12:51.020 --> 1:12:53.140
 And they're all different.

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:54.580
 They have similarities, of course,

1:12:54.580 --> 1:12:57.740
 but they have peculiarities that make them different.

1:12:57.740 --> 1:12:59.500
 And you can think of all the different trajectories,

1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:02.620
 all the Einstein's, the Feynman's, the Hitler's,

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:08.180
 and all the people who would have died during childbirth,

1:13:08.180 --> 1:13:09.900
 who would have died early in their years,

1:13:09.900 --> 1:13:11.300
 given the different diseases.

1:13:11.300 --> 1:13:13.260
 It's fascinating to think about.

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.380
 An average human.

1:13:15.420 --> 1:13:19.060
 Yeah, we're all winners of a very competitive race.

1:13:19.060 --> 1:13:23.860
 So the people who make it, we're winners, hashtag winning.

1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:28.100
 Is there something that you find

1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:33.100
 fascinating, interesting, beautiful, ugly,

1:13:35.420 --> 1:13:36.980
 surprising about sperm?

1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:42.380
 I think sperm is, yes, it isn't a very interesting

1:13:42.380 --> 1:13:44.140
 bodily fluid, maybe I'll write about it

1:13:44.140 --> 1:13:45.780
 in a second or third book, we'll see.

1:13:45.780 --> 1:13:48.980
 But I guess sperm is interesting

1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:53.420
 because it's kind of the only projectile bodily fluid

1:13:53.420 --> 1:13:54.540
 from the body.

1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:57.620
 Vomit can be projectile.

1:13:57.620 --> 1:13:59.020
 Usually that's a disease state,

1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:01.420
 that's not the expected kind of normal, healthy state.

1:14:01.420 --> 1:14:03.860
 Oh, sneezing, would you classify that or no?

1:14:03.860 --> 1:14:06.900
 True, I guess there's some particles in the air.

1:14:06.900 --> 1:14:10.180
 I guess it's not a fluid, I mean, not a liquid.

1:14:11.340 --> 1:14:13.820
 But true, I mean cough, in addition to sneeze, right?

1:14:13.820 --> 1:14:16.220
 Sneeze is how our nose gets rid of something

1:14:16.220 --> 1:14:17.060
 that shouldn't be there.

1:14:17.060 --> 1:14:18.460
 Cough is how our lungs get rid of something

1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:19.420
 that shouldn't be there.

1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:20.860
 Vomiting is sometimes how our stomachs

1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:22.900
 get rid of something that shouldn't be there.

1:14:22.900 --> 1:14:25.420
 All projectile, sometimes in their own way.

1:14:25.420 --> 1:14:28.220
 Sperm is sort of interesting, it's created with the food

1:14:28.220 --> 1:14:30.660
 for its journey, sperm mostly feed off of fructose,

1:14:30.660 --> 1:14:33.340
 the kind of sugar for the few days

1:14:33.340 --> 1:14:35.820
 that they live inside the female genital tract.

1:14:35.820 --> 1:14:38.140
 But it's sort of, I like comparing our genitals

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:40.460
 to the genitals of the plant world, which is flowers.

1:14:40.460 --> 1:14:44.580
 And in the same way that a touch me not, for instance,

1:14:44.580 --> 1:14:46.700
 the kind of flower where when you brush up against it,

1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:48.900
 it sort of launches seeds into the distance

1:14:48.900 --> 1:14:53.580
 to try to survive in a way kind of the sperm

1:14:53.580 --> 1:14:56.220
 is doing something similar, launched into the female genital

1:14:56.220 --> 1:14:59.380
 tract, and then all trying to find this competing

1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:01.340
 against each other to find this egg.

1:15:01.340 --> 1:15:03.180
 It's really amazing, and when you learn about it

1:15:03.180 --> 1:15:06.020
 from the biological perspective, the most amazing thing

1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:10.700
 is how many things can go wrong, just in the sperm not

1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:13.540
 surviving long enough for it making it to the egg,

1:15:13.540 --> 1:15:17.700
 and then some genetic abnormality causing a miscarriage.

1:15:17.700 --> 1:15:21.220
 It's sort of astounding that it works as often as it does,

1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:23.660
 and I think the lesson there is just that people

1:15:23.660 --> 1:15:26.180
 have a lot of sex, and so statistics just

1:15:26.180 --> 1:15:29.220
 favor it's going to work out a good number of times.

1:15:29.220 --> 1:15:30.900
 Yeah, and there might be intelligence

1:15:30.900 --> 1:15:33.900
 in the design of just the sheer number of sperm.

1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:38.580
 Maybe that's yet another way to inject variety into the system.

1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:40.260
 And redundancy, I guess.

1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:41.460
 We have two kidneys.

1:15:41.460 --> 1:15:42.620
 We have two hands.

1:15:42.620 --> 1:15:44.500
 If we lose one, we can still go on.

1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:47.860
 We have however many millions of sperm

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:50.140
 get sort of launched in every ejaculation,

1:15:50.140 --> 1:15:54.340
 is if a bunch fail or don't make it inside others will.

1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:56.180
 There's papers on this, by the way,

1:15:56.180 --> 1:15:59.580
 that I've read for some reason, not read, but skimmed,

1:15:59.580 --> 1:16:03.860
 for some reason, which is talking about which sperm usually

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:06.140
 wins, like what are the characteristics of sperms

1:16:06.140 --> 1:16:09.380
 that are winning, and it's not the fastest.

1:16:09.380 --> 1:16:13.380
 So apparently there's some kind of slaughter

1:16:13.380 --> 1:16:15.340
 that happens early on, people will correct me,

1:16:15.340 --> 1:16:17.260
 but it's not the fastest.

1:16:17.260 --> 1:16:19.300
 There is an aspect of it's the luckiest.

1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:21.340
 It really is, like the body tries

1:16:21.340 --> 1:16:23.380
 to make it a random selection.

1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:27.900
 They try to make it fair in making it as random as possible.

1:16:27.900 --> 1:16:30.100
 Interesting, and also interesting that they're fueled

1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:32.300
 by fructose, I didn't really think about that.

1:16:32.300 --> 1:16:37.260
 So they're a car bloated athlete.

1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:38.860
 Right, with food for the journey.

1:16:38.860 --> 1:16:39.700
 Food for the journey.

1:16:39.700 --> 1:16:42.380
 Because I'm somebody that actually does a lot of running

1:16:42.380 --> 1:16:46.380
 on, I guess you would call me a fat adapted athlete,

1:16:46.380 --> 1:16:51.180
 so I do sort of meat heavy diet,

1:16:51.180 --> 1:16:53.860
 and so you could do a lot of endurance kind of stuff

1:16:53.860 --> 1:16:56.500
 when you don't need any carbs, any glucose,

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:59.980
 any of that kind of stuff, and any are very low.

1:16:59.980 --> 1:17:01.900
 It's interesting to think that sperm are like,

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:05.980
 nope, they're total bros, let's go to the gym,

1:17:05.980 --> 1:17:10.980
 sprint, performance, short term performance is everything.

1:17:10.980 --> 1:17:15.980
 All right, well, that sperm, they're turning to the liver,

1:17:16.420 --> 1:17:20.460
 the place that deals with all our poor decisions.

1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:22.420
 No, many of them.

1:17:22.420 --> 1:17:24.060
 Many of our poor decisions.

1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:29.060
 Is there, you said that the liver does quite a few things.

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:32.980
 What do you, is fascinating, beautiful about the liver?

1:17:32.980 --> 1:17:35.860
 I would say it's primary function seems to be

1:17:35.860 --> 1:17:40.220
 as the sort of gatekeeper for what we eat and absorb.

1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:42.900
 You know, the entire gastrointestinal tract

1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:45.820
 from the esophagus to the rectum,

1:17:45.820 --> 1:17:48.700
 the blood flows from it, not back to the heart,

1:17:48.700 --> 1:17:51.900
 but to the liver, where it's first examined

1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:55.660
 kind of things are evaluated, packaged,

1:17:55.660 --> 1:17:59.300
 you know, processed, detoxified perhaps.

1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:01.140
 And it's kind of this great overseer

1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:03.860
 of what we digest and absorb.

1:18:03.860 --> 1:18:07.660
 And so it kind of keeps track of what's coming in,

1:18:07.660 --> 1:18:09.620
 you know, the outside world that comes in

1:18:09.620 --> 1:18:11.860
 and will become part of us.

1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:15.140
 You know, that's why partly the liver suffers sometimes,

1:18:15.140 --> 1:18:19.260
 the injury from certain toxins like alcohol.

1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:21.700
 But beyond that, the liver is also the place,

1:18:21.700 --> 1:18:23.780
 as I said, it metabolizes things too.

1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:26.860
 So it metabolizes alcohol and why it can be injured

1:18:26.860 --> 1:18:29.300
 by alcohol and metabolizes drugs like Tylenol,

1:18:29.300 --> 1:18:33.660
 which is why Tylenol can be very toxic to the liver

1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:35.060
 when taken as an overdose.

1:18:36.460 --> 1:18:38.540
 So the liver, you know, even beyond that,

1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:42.140
 the liver produces a lot of different, you know,

1:18:42.140 --> 1:18:43.580
 things that float in the bloodstream.

1:18:43.580 --> 1:18:46.300
 It packages cholesterol and fats

1:18:46.300 --> 1:18:48.140
 and sends them to where they're needed.

1:18:48.140 --> 1:18:50.140
 It deals with protein in the blood.

1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:51.940
 It deals with clotting factors in the blood,

1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:54.980
 helping the blood clot, you know,

1:18:54.980 --> 1:18:57.380
 processes things like bilirubin and other things.

1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:58.460
 It really, as I mentioned,

1:18:58.460 --> 1:19:00.460
 is like 15 organs wrapped into one.

1:19:00.460 --> 1:19:02.860
 Maybe that's why it's sort of the biggest internal organ.

1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:06.340
 The skin's bigger, but it's not an internal organ.

1:19:06.340 --> 1:19:10.340
 Right, the biggest organ in the human body is the skin.

1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:13.100
 Right, but the liver's the biggest internal organ

1:19:13.100 --> 1:19:16.020
 and it really is a powerhouse and does a lot,

1:19:16.020 --> 1:19:18.620
 which is why when people suffer from liver failure,

1:19:18.620 --> 1:19:20.620
 kind of everything goes wrong in a way.

1:19:21.460 --> 1:19:24.060
 And in terms of replacing organs,

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:29.060
 what are organs that are easily replaceable, which are not?

1:19:29.900 --> 1:19:32.580
 Like on the list of things that are hard to replace and not,

1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:34.820
 where would you put a number one?

1:19:34.820 --> 1:19:37.140
 What would you put it like at the bottom?

1:19:37.140 --> 1:19:39.540
 Well, let's say the kidneys are, you know, nothing's easy,

1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:41.820
 but kidneys are easiest in a way.

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:44.020
 Partly, I mean, maybe a big factor there

1:19:44.020 --> 1:19:46.420
 is that other people have two of them and can give one to you.

1:19:46.420 --> 1:19:47.940
 So you don't have to wait for people to die,

1:19:47.940 --> 1:19:49.980
 which is the case with hearts and livers.

1:19:49.980 --> 1:19:51.940
 Sometimes you can take a part of a liver

1:19:51.940 --> 1:19:53.380
 from someone who's alive.

1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:57.060
 And the liver does have this kind of mythological ability

1:19:57.060 --> 1:20:01.180
 to regenerate itself in the myth of Prometheus.

1:20:01.180 --> 1:20:03.020
 He's, you know, chained to a rock

1:20:03.020 --> 1:20:04.860
 and the bird eats his liver every day

1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:06.860
 and it grows back every day.

1:20:06.860 --> 1:20:09.900
 And that's actually biologically accurate.

1:20:09.900 --> 1:20:11.700
 It's not that you can completely get rid of it

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:13.900
 and it'll appear again, but when pieces of it

1:20:13.900 --> 1:20:15.060
 are removed or injured,

1:20:15.060 --> 1:20:17.220
 it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly.

1:20:19.220 --> 1:20:20.140
 So I'd say the kidneys,

1:20:20.140 --> 1:20:21.900
 the fact that they're more around,

1:20:21.900 --> 1:20:24.140
 also it's, you know, the kidney's a smaller organ.

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:27.260
 It's often just, you don't have to put a transplanted kidney

1:20:27.260 --> 1:20:29.300
 where the kidney should be in the back of the abdomen.

1:20:29.300 --> 1:20:31.620
 You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there

1:20:31.620 --> 1:20:33.660
 because it's a smaller organ, the liver would be hard

1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:34.580
 because it's huge.

1:20:36.180 --> 1:20:38.100
 And I guess we just have the most experience

1:20:38.100 --> 1:20:41.860
 with kidney transplants because they are the most common.

1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:46.420
 And the heart and the brain are probably quite difficult.

1:20:46.420 --> 1:20:49.460
 Brain, as far as I know, hasn't been successfully done.

1:20:49.460 --> 1:20:51.020
 The heart is done.

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:55.340
 And definitely I've evaluated a lot of patients

1:20:55.340 --> 1:20:56.900
 with a heart transplant.

1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:58.180
 It does work pretty well.

1:20:58.180 --> 1:21:01.980
 The mechanical heart substitutes are also advancing

1:21:01.980 --> 1:21:03.620
 quite rapidly these days.

1:21:03.620 --> 1:21:06.220
 For a failing heart, there's certain kinds of devices

1:21:06.220 --> 1:21:08.300
 they can surgically implant.

1:21:08.300 --> 1:21:10.900
 Like when a failing heart isn't able to push hard enough,

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:13.100
 you know, that's the heart's job is pushing blood

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:15.580
 with sufficient pressure to create blood pressure.

1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:17.780
 When it fails, there are actually these devices

1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:21.460
 you can strap onto the heart to help it pump harder.

1:21:21.460 --> 1:21:23.140
 Those are rapidly advancing.

1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:25.300
 Many of those were not available even 10 years ago

1:21:25.300 --> 1:21:26.980
 when I got out of med school

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:29.300
 and now they're commonly used.

1:21:29.300 --> 1:21:31.220
 So maybe heart transplant won't be as necessary

1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:34.500
 in the future if those mechanical things do advance.

1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:37.180
 And as I said, the heart is basically a mechanical pump.

1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:39.220
 So perhaps it would be the easiest organ

1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:41.900
 to replace with some mechanical device.

1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:43.580
 Now for something completely different,

1:21:43.580 --> 1:21:45.060
 returning to testicles for a time.

1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:50.060
 You posted Instagram posts of testicles as food.

1:21:51.540 --> 1:21:54.260
 Perhaps eating them doesn't help libido

1:21:54.260 --> 1:21:58.220
 because ingested testosterone is totally metabolized

1:21:58.220 --> 1:22:01.180
 in the liver, returning to our liver,

1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:03.460
 leaving none to reach the bloodstream.

1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:06.460
 That is why testosterone only comes as injection

1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:10.380
 or topical foam, not as pills.

1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:14.220
 On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone

1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:17.380
 can be absorbed orally, hence the pill.

1:22:17.380 --> 1:22:19.820
 But testosterone is mostly responsible

1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:21.460
 for libido in women too.

1:22:21.460 --> 1:22:23.660
 I was not expecting for this biology lesson

1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:27.060
 when I was looking at an Instagram picture

1:22:27.060 --> 1:22:30.020
 of are we looking at testicles?

1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:30.860
 Yeah.

1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:34.180
 Are these like which species?

1:22:34.180 --> 1:22:36.380
 I believe all those are from cows.

1:22:36.380 --> 1:22:37.380
 From cows, cow testicles.

1:22:37.380 --> 1:22:39.900
 Cows are technically females though, bulls.

1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:42.060
 Yeah, well, speaking of which,

1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:43.820
 just we'll jump around a bit,

1:22:43.820 --> 1:22:47.740
 but you've also traveled the world quite a bit.

1:22:47.740 --> 1:22:52.740
 What have you, what is the craziest food you've eaten

1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:55.980
 across the world?

1:22:55.980 --> 1:22:58.820
 What have you learned about the extremes

1:22:58.820 --> 1:23:02.780
 of the culinary arts by traveling the world?

1:23:03.700 --> 1:23:07.700
 I would say, I guess I've always been extra fascinated

1:23:07.700 --> 1:23:11.620
 with the diets of natives of the far North.

1:23:11.620 --> 1:23:15.300
 I spent some time there in Russia and in Alaska

1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:18.460
 and always loved their diet.

1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:21.540
 So when I worked in Alaska in emergency room

1:23:21.540 --> 1:23:24.060
 and did some other travels in Arctic Alaska,

1:23:24.060 --> 1:23:28.460
 and they eat a lot of fat traditionally

1:23:28.460 --> 1:23:31.420
 before contact, more than half of all calories

1:23:31.420 --> 1:23:35.060
 in the Inupia Descomode diet came from blubber,

1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:37.860
 marine mammal fat, or also fat from fish,

1:23:37.860 --> 1:23:39.820
 fat from ducks and other birds

1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:41.620
 that go up there to mate in the summer.

1:23:41.620 --> 1:23:46.260
 So things like raw whale blubber was especially interesting

1:23:46.260 --> 1:23:48.140
 for me and very exciting.

1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:51.580
 You know, I had some beluga whale chowder,

1:23:51.580 --> 1:23:52.420
 things like that.

1:23:52.420 --> 1:23:55.900
 There's just all these very unusual dishes.

1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:58.700
 You know, there's a dish called Mickey Yuck,

1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:03.340
 which is whale meat fermented in whale blood,

1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:05.020
 which is quite delicious actually.

1:24:05.020 --> 1:24:06.460
 So is it cooked?

1:24:06.460 --> 1:24:07.820
 Is it eaten raw?

1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:09.540
 Is it, how do they like their fat?

1:24:09.540 --> 1:24:14.540
 Like in the same up north in Russia, as you mentioned.

1:24:14.780 --> 1:24:16.780
 So they often eat it raw.

1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:20.140
 So the raw whale blubber is called muck duck,

1:24:20.140 --> 1:24:22.060
 and it's often just sliced thin.

1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:25.580
 And it's sort of cold, but not frozen often when they eat it,

1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:26.820
 and they slice it thin.

1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:30.100
 And a lot of people assume it would be very chewy,

1:24:30.100 --> 1:24:31.380
 but it's not that chewy.

1:24:31.380 --> 1:24:32.500
 It's quite pleasant actually,

1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:36.260
 and has this kind of sea smell to it as you're eating it.

1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:38.060
 I quite like it.

1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:40.300
 And what's the culinary culture like?

1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:45.660
 Meaning, is it just source of energy or is it art?

1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:49.380
 Well, traditionally, there's not a lot of cooking

1:24:49.380 --> 1:24:51.580
 in the Arctic.

1:24:51.580 --> 1:24:53.140
 A lot of things are eaten raw,

1:24:53.140 --> 1:24:56.700
 partly because there's not a lot of fuel for making fires.

1:24:56.700 --> 1:25:00.700
 So they will, some in some of the big rivers in Russia,

1:25:00.700 --> 1:25:01.940
 for instance, that flow north,

1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:05.740
 they will bring trees, dead trees and logs up to the north,

1:25:05.740 --> 1:25:07.660
 and they can get some wood that way.

1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:09.580
 And same thing in some of the rivers

1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:12.860
 kind of flowing northward from the Brooks Range of Alaska.

1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.020
 You do get some trees,

1:25:14.020 --> 1:25:18.220
 but just not enough to really produce a culinary art

1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:20.780
 that requires cooking with heat.

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:24.020
 You know, they do have traditionally blubber lamps

1:25:24.020 --> 1:25:26.340
 where the blubbers of seals and whales are used

1:25:26.340 --> 1:25:28.260
 to create a little flame.

1:25:28.260 --> 1:25:32.300
 Often that's for light and for a little bit of heat,

1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:34.580
 and less for cooking.

1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:37.220
 But eating things raw is definitely a huge part

1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:38.060
 of the culture there.

1:25:38.060 --> 1:25:40.220
 And while I was, I went on a whale hunting trip

1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:44.700
 out on the spring ice in the Arctic Ocean by Barrow, Alaska.

1:25:44.700 --> 1:25:48.820
 And two of the guys, the Inupiat guys who had invited me,

1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:51.460
 were kind of talking about how eating things raw

1:25:51.460 --> 1:25:53.460
 is sort of the most essential characteristic

1:25:53.460 --> 1:25:54.860
 of Inupiat culture.

1:25:54.860 --> 1:25:56.940
 And the one guy who's half white, half Inupiat,

1:25:56.940 --> 1:25:59.140
 said people often doubt his ethnicity

1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:00.660
 because he looks like a white guy.

1:26:00.660 --> 1:26:04.340
 So he'll, you know, bite the head off of a raw bird

1:26:04.340 --> 1:26:07.340
 to show them that he is truly Inupiat, as already said.

1:26:07.340 --> 1:26:09.100
 That's how you prove you're legit.

1:26:09.100 --> 1:26:11.100
 We're looking at an Instagram pic.

1:26:11.100 --> 1:26:14.100
 As a doctor, I was used to knowing fat

1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:17.140
 as the most maligned of all body parts,

1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:19.540
 and the culprit in an obesity epidemic.

1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:23.020
 But in Arctic Alaska, fat has always meant

1:26:23.020 --> 1:26:24.740
 health and survival.

1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:27.300
 In fact, the entire story of life in the Arctic,

1:26:27.300 --> 1:26:30.740
 especially human life, is basically a tale of fat.

1:26:30.740 --> 1:26:33.620
 And in Barrow, what's A.K.?

1:26:33.620 --> 1:26:34.300
 Alaska.

1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:34.900
 Alaska.

1:26:34.900 --> 1:26:36.700
 OK.

1:26:36.700 --> 1:26:39.140
 A lawn covered with a whale blubber

1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:42.460
 is still equivalent of a plush green lawn

1:26:42.460 --> 1:26:46.980
 in temperature suburbia, swelling in its owner with pride.

1:26:46.980 --> 1:26:53.540
 And that's what we're looking at is a lawn full of whale blubber.

1:26:53.540 --> 1:26:55.260
 A beautiful, and this is, I mean,

1:26:55.260 --> 1:26:56.780
 there's a lot of calories there.

1:26:56.780 --> 1:26:57.100
 Oh, yeah.

1:26:57.100 --> 1:26:58.900
 And this can feed a lot of people.

1:26:58.900 --> 1:27:01.220
 A lot of energy, a lot of warmth.

1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:02.100
 Absolutely.

1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:03.300
 And it's delicious.

1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:06.940
 This was like a, I was a kid in a candy store, basically.

1:27:06.940 --> 1:27:08.460
 I rounded a corner in Barrow.

1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:11.300
 So when people do get a whale during the spring

1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:13.060
 whaling season, they raise a flag,

1:27:13.060 --> 1:27:15.500
 or the whaling captain raises a flag over his house,

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:18.660
 and everyone in town is welcome to come try some.

1:27:18.660 --> 1:27:21.580
 And so before I went inside to try some,

1:27:21.580 --> 1:27:23.940
 I was kind of playing around with blubber.

1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:26.300
 And I saw that this is a bowhead whale.

1:27:26.300 --> 1:27:31.540
 I saw its heart, which was huge, like the size of a yoga ball.

1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:33.740
 And that was, for me, just like amazing.

1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:36.020
 I spent probably the next 45 minutes just looking

1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:37.020
 at all aspects of it.

1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:39.580
 And the stump of aorta that was attached to it

1:27:39.580 --> 1:27:41.860
 was the size of my thigh.

1:27:41.860 --> 1:27:43.620
 That was really fascinating.

1:27:43.620 --> 1:27:46.020
 It's similar Alaska and northern Russia,

1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:48.140
 like Siberian out there.

1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:50.540
 So where were you?

1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:53.940
 I think you have some picks from that time.

1:27:53.940 --> 1:27:55.500
 Where were you in Russia?

1:27:55.500 --> 1:27:58.420
 So I spent a lot of time in kind of Western Russia as well.

1:27:58.420 --> 1:28:02.140
 But I did take two trips to Kamchatka,

1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:04.380
 including northern Kamchatka.

1:28:04.380 --> 1:28:07.660
 I didn't go far enough, nor I didn't go to Chukotka,

1:28:07.660 --> 1:28:09.620
 for instance, until more recently when

1:28:09.620 --> 1:28:13.260
 I was a ship doctor on a wildlife cruise that

1:28:13.260 --> 1:28:16.900
 sailed from Anadyr, Russia, up to through the Bering

1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:19.380
 Strait and to Rangel Island.

1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:21.380
 And we stopped in some villages in Chukotka,

1:28:21.380 --> 1:28:25.220
 and I got a chance to try some whale and stuff like that.

1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:28.540
 Northern Kamchatka, where it's more the Koryak or the indigenous

1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:30.460
 people, they do a lot of seal hunting.

1:28:30.460 --> 1:28:32.620
 So I had a lot of seal blubber, but I don't believe

1:28:32.620 --> 1:28:35.500
 they do any whale hunting quite there.

1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:38.020
 But the Chukchi in a way are sort of

1:28:38.020 --> 1:28:42.300
 similar to the Inupia in their diet and their lifeways.

1:28:42.300 --> 1:28:44.460
 Of course, everyone's diet, all these people's diet,

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:47.060
 has changed dramatically in the last 100 years,

1:28:47.060 --> 1:28:49.180
 as it has for actually everyone living in kind

1:28:49.180 --> 1:28:50.740
 of modern societies.

1:28:50.740 --> 1:28:52.580
 But for them, perhaps more than anyone else,

1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:54.660
 since their diet was the most extreme,

1:28:54.660 --> 1:28:57.540
 I think, of any human culture on Earth.

1:28:57.540 --> 1:29:01.100
 Just to stay on the wild travel you did.

1:29:01.100 --> 1:29:03.420
 And I should say, I'm using the word travel,

1:29:03.420 --> 1:29:07.740
 but it really, you were a doctor there.

1:29:11.100 --> 1:29:13.060
 First of all, can you just comment on the decision

1:29:13.060 --> 1:29:18.260
 to go to such places and to help people to be a doctor there?

1:29:18.260 --> 1:29:19.500
 What was the motivation?

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:20.980
 What was the thinking behind it?

1:29:20.980 --> 1:29:22.620
 Well, I think I got the travel bug

1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:25.100
 before I ever went to medical school

1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:26.780
 and even wanted to be a doctor.

1:29:26.780 --> 1:29:31.260
 So right after college, I kind of wasn't very into college,

1:29:31.260 --> 1:29:33.940
 didn't enjoy things, kind of wanted to get out there

1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:36.540
 and see the world, get out of New York City

1:29:36.540 --> 1:29:39.780
 where I was a student at NYU.

1:29:39.780 --> 1:29:42.140
 The first thing I did after finishing college

1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:45.540
 was I was invited to be an intern at a research center

1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:47.300
 in St. Petersburg, Russia.

1:29:47.300 --> 1:29:49.180
 I spent six months there on my first trip

1:29:49.180 --> 1:29:53.780
 and went back four more times to Russia, traveled all over,

1:29:53.780 --> 1:29:57.660
 including to Kamchatka twice and other parts of the country.

1:29:57.660 --> 1:30:00.660
 I'd never heard of cities like Petrozovodsk

1:30:00.660 --> 1:30:02.700
 and Siktivkar and Pskov.

1:30:02.700 --> 1:30:05.700
 I didn't even know a word could start with PSK,

1:30:05.700 --> 1:30:07.620
 like the city of Pskov, but it can.

1:30:07.620 --> 1:30:08.860
 Yeah.

1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:10.940
 And I was sort of fascinated.

1:30:10.940 --> 1:30:14.460
 I was actually studying the international environmental

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:16.540
 movement and how it came to Russia

1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:18.540
 after the fall of the Soviet Union

1:30:18.540 --> 1:30:20.260
 and how organizations like Greenpeace

1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:23.180
 and World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank

1:30:23.180 --> 1:30:27.140
 are trying to kind of push the timber industry,

1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:29.900
 which is huge in Russia, toward a more sustainable path.

1:30:29.900 --> 1:30:34.260
 And so I was sort of evaluating how is it working, if not, why not?

1:30:34.260 --> 1:30:36.300
 And that seems like such a little niche,

1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:38.860
 such a small detail about Russian society.

1:30:38.860 --> 1:30:41.580
 But in a way, researching that in depth

1:30:41.580 --> 1:30:44.700
 was almost this window into the entire country

1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:46.940
 and the history in a place I knew nothing about.

1:30:46.940 --> 1:30:50.740
 And I learned the language, traveled all over the country,

1:30:50.740 --> 1:30:53.020
 got to know the food, the history, the literature.

1:30:53.020 --> 1:30:55.980
 It was just an immersive and amazing and life changing

1:30:55.980 --> 1:31:00.540
 experience that made me want to see every spot on the globe,

1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:03.100
 basically, and learn about every culture.

1:31:03.100 --> 1:31:06.220
 So I took that desire with me to medical school.

1:31:06.220 --> 1:31:08.340
 I decided I would go to medical school.

1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:10.860
 And from the very beginning, I was

1:31:10.860 --> 1:31:13.420
 intent on traveling around the world.

1:31:13.420 --> 1:31:16.140
 So a lot of my career has been fashioned

1:31:16.140 --> 1:31:18.300
 so that I'm practicing medicine in a place

1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:20.420
 with an interesting geographic context,

1:31:20.420 --> 1:31:24.580
 an interesting place, with an interesting cultural context.

1:31:24.580 --> 1:31:27.460
 And that just makes it more interesting, I find.

1:31:27.460 --> 1:31:29.460
 Not only are medical services often more

1:31:29.460 --> 1:31:31.820
 needed in these remote and rural parts of the country

1:31:31.820 --> 1:31:35.460
 and world, so I feel like I'm taking my knowledge

1:31:35.460 --> 1:31:38.500
 and education experience to places where it's needed.

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:41.820
 But also, for me, it's just such an enlightening experience.

1:31:41.820 --> 1:31:44.900
 The way culture, history, geography, climate

1:31:44.900 --> 1:31:47.820
 affects medical disease, but just getting to know people,

1:31:47.820 --> 1:31:51.420
 getting to know their culture, being a very useful traveler

1:31:51.420 --> 1:31:54.740
 by providing medical services in that place.

1:31:54.740 --> 1:31:57.300
 And that's taken me to Arctic Alaska,

1:31:57.300 --> 1:31:59.420
 to Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota.

1:31:59.420 --> 1:32:01.340
 I currently work in a few different parts

1:32:01.340 --> 1:32:04.180
 of Pennsylvania, Appalachia, which for me

1:32:04.180 --> 1:32:08.020
 is a unique geography and culture that I didn't grow up with,

1:32:08.020 --> 1:32:08.860
 wasn't familiar with.

1:32:08.860 --> 1:32:12.140
 So in some ways, it's exotic for me as well.

1:32:12.140 --> 1:32:15.580
 Now, I worked in other places too, like Calcutta, India,

1:32:15.580 --> 1:32:16.620
 and Nepal.

1:32:16.620 --> 1:32:20.580
 Just I think my love of travel has shaped my medical career.

1:32:20.580 --> 1:32:23.460
 And being a doctor does give you these opportunities

1:32:23.460 --> 1:32:27.060
 to go to places and travel in a unique way

1:32:27.060 --> 1:32:30.060
 through the medical profession.

1:32:30.060 --> 1:32:32.340
 You know, there's a documentary, Happy People,

1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:35.660
 You're in the Tiger, or something like that.

1:32:35.660 --> 1:32:39.500
 I think Warner Herzog voices it.

1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:43.780
 It tells a story of a simple life of survival in the tiger.

1:32:43.780 --> 1:32:47.100
 And I think they're trapping for food.

1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:48.980
 And there's a lot.

1:32:48.980 --> 1:32:51.660
 There's an alcoholism problem too as well.

1:32:51.660 --> 1:32:57.460
 There's like a very basic life of survival,

1:32:57.460 --> 1:32:59.460
 of loneliness, of desperation.

1:32:59.460 --> 1:33:04.820
 But also there's a, I think the underlying claim

1:33:04.820 --> 1:33:12.020
 of the documentary is that that simple life actually

1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:17.100
 has a kind of simple happiness to it.

1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:18.420
 Hence the name Happy People.

1:33:18.420 --> 1:33:22.060
 Is there, can you speak to the life

1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:27.220
 that people live in those places when it may be simpler

1:33:27.220 --> 1:33:32.500
 than you would in a sort of big city life?

1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:36.060
 It's definitely very different for sure.

1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:39.860
 You know, I guess I found like in some of the remote villages

1:33:39.860 --> 1:33:42.700
 of Kamchatka, I was actually surprised

1:33:42.700 --> 1:33:45.740
 how similar they were in that, you know,

1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:48.820
 there was, I saw the same family strife,

1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:51.980
 the same fights, the same, you know,

1:33:51.980 --> 1:33:57.460
 kind of pairing of relationships and bickering and politics.

1:33:57.460 --> 1:34:01.020
 And, you know, in a way, I'm from the New Jersey suburbs

1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:05.660
 and yet being in this remote village of Northern Kamchatka,

1:34:05.660 --> 1:34:07.220
 I remember writing an email to my friend

1:34:07.220 --> 1:34:08.940
 about how it just seemed so similar

1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:12.540
 even though on the surface it was this exotic other world.

1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:15.500
 The incredible material know how they must have

1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:17.740
 to get their food from the land, you know,

1:34:17.740 --> 1:34:20.740
 that the number of animal species, plant species,

1:34:20.740 --> 1:34:25.220
 the behaviors of the animals, seasons, how to live that way.

1:34:25.220 --> 1:34:26.980
 In a way, it's more complicated in a way

1:34:26.980 --> 1:34:29.660
 that I find fascinating, how people live on the land

1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:31.420
 and the knowledge and experience it takes

1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:33.380
 to do it well and survive.

1:34:33.380 --> 1:34:35.900
 You know, obviously other aspects of modern life

1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:38.820
 in a city are much more complicated

1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:41.100
 than they would be there, but I guess it's,

1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:42.420
 that was something that struck me too

1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:43.740
 that it's simpler in some ways,

1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:45.820
 but more complicated in other ways.

1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.500
 So some of the complexity that happens in life

1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:52.060
 is originated from humans, not from the technology

1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:54.300
 or all that kind of stuff around us.

1:34:55.460 --> 1:34:57.220
 You can take the human out of modernity,

1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:58.380
 but they're still human.

1:34:58.380 --> 1:34:59.460
 They're still human.

1:34:59.460 --> 1:35:01.060
 And they fill the empty space

1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:03.340
 with their own human complexities.

1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:08.540
 Are there people that just stand out, memorable people,

1:35:08.540 --> 1:35:11.500
 memorable experiences from those places?

1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:16.740
 Some people that maybe made you smile,

1:35:16.740 --> 1:35:20.500
 made you cry, changed who you are as a man,

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.580
 changed who you are as a doctor.

1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:24.100
 Anything jumps to mind?

1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:26.180
 I think, you know, when I was, is interesting,

1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:29.020
 when I was in Russia, I found that most

1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:31.780
 of the people I hung out with were old women.

1:35:31.780 --> 1:35:32.860
 I'm not sure why.

1:35:32.860 --> 1:35:34.780
 I mean, they're, actually I didn't meet a lot

1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:36.780
 of old men in Russia, which might speak

1:35:36.780 --> 1:35:41.140
 to kind of life expectancy there for men in particular.

1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:44.380
 But I found women, older Russian women,

1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.980
 including, you know, Russian from St. Petersburg

1:35:46.980 --> 1:35:50.500
 or some of the elderly women in Kamchatka who were,

1:35:50.500 --> 1:35:52.980
 you know, some were Koryak, some were half Koryak,

1:35:52.980 --> 1:35:55.340
 half Russian, some were Chukchi.

1:35:55.340 --> 1:35:58.060
 I just found them to have, to be so enlightening

1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:01.980
 the way they talked about history, about people,

1:36:01.980 --> 1:36:03.660
 so insightful about humanity.

1:36:03.660 --> 1:36:05.860
 You know, all they've lived through in the last 50 years

1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:07.780
 in some of these parts of Russia,

1:36:07.780 --> 1:36:10.380
 just like the upheaval, societal upheaval,

1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:12.460
 the destruction, the building up,

1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:15.820
 it's just something I could not even imagine.

1:36:15.820 --> 1:36:17.980
 And I think their insights were just very,

1:36:17.980 --> 1:36:19.900
 I'm not thinking of anything in particular,

1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:22.180
 but I just remember I could listen to some

1:36:22.180 --> 1:36:24.140
 of these elderly women talk about their lives

1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:25.380
 for hours and hours.

1:36:25.380 --> 1:36:29.940
 I remember there was this older, elderly blind Koryak woman

1:36:29.940 --> 1:36:32.060
 who you would have thought was the, you know,

1:36:32.060 --> 1:36:34.100
 most country bumpkin of country bumpkin,

1:36:34.100 --> 1:36:35.540
 and yet she couldn't stop talking about

1:36:35.540 --> 1:36:37.980
 how much she loved reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,

1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:41.660
 and which might also speak to the Soviet education system.

1:36:41.660 --> 1:36:43.820
 And it was just sort of surprising and fascinating

1:36:43.820 --> 1:36:46.900
 and just those stories and perspectives on life

1:36:46.900 --> 1:36:48.740
 really stayed with me.

1:36:48.740 --> 1:36:52.220
 Yeah, with Babushki.

1:36:52.220 --> 1:36:57.220
 There's a wisdom, there's a kindness.

1:37:02.220 --> 1:37:06.140
 I mean, I suppose that's true for older people in general,

1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:09.460
 but there's something about, it's not just Russia,

1:37:09.460 --> 1:37:10.900
 it's Eastern Europe.

1:37:11.820 --> 1:37:16.820
 It's like this kind of look of wisdom

1:37:16.820 --> 1:37:21.820
 and not just like sort of middle class wisdom

1:37:22.500 --> 1:37:23.740
 or something like that.

1:37:23.740 --> 1:37:26.500
 It's like I have seen some shit wisdom.

1:37:28.300 --> 1:37:30.140
 I've seen it all.

1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:33.580
 And on the other side, I'm left here

1:37:33.580 --> 1:37:37.220
 with a pragmatism and a compassion

1:37:37.220 --> 1:37:39.660
 and also an ability to cook really well.

1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:41.540
 That's for sure, absolutely.

1:37:41.540 --> 1:37:44.900
 There's just this balance of just deep intelligence

1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:47.060
 and deep kindness.

1:37:47.060 --> 1:37:50.740
 Yeah, I mean, part, much of who I am

1:37:50.740 --> 1:37:53.100
 is because of the relationship I had with my grandmother,

1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:58.100
 who is a Russian, Ukrainian born Russian grandmother.

1:38:01.980 --> 1:38:03.860
 Did you learn the Russian language?

1:38:03.860 --> 1:38:05.940
 I did, it's quite rusty at this point,

1:38:05.940 --> 1:38:10.180
 but I did one of these wonderful elderly Russians

1:38:10.180 --> 1:38:12.620
 in St. Petersburg, it sort of adopted me.

1:38:12.620 --> 1:38:13.660
 I think that was another thing

1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:16.220
 that a lot of these elderly women

1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:19.220
 on every side of the country kind of adopted me

1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:21.780
 or saw me as this real curiosity.

1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:24.940
 Sort of just not, I mean, this was around 2002, 2003.

1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:28.620
 It just wasn't common for this sort of strange American

1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:30.500
 to suddenly show up in the middle of Khomchatka

1:38:30.500 --> 1:38:32.140
 or even St. Petersburg.

1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:34.860
 And just absolutely ravenously curious

1:38:34.860 --> 1:38:36.500
 about everything they had to say.

1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:40.220
 So I often got adopted and one of them taught me Russian

1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:41.500
 and had a ride a horse.

1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:46.500
 So the same Babushka taught me both of those things.

1:38:46.580 --> 1:38:48.660
 And like you said, also I should mention

1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:51.140
 that there's something about the Soviet education system

1:38:51.140 --> 1:38:54.620
 where everybody reads Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.

1:38:54.620 --> 1:38:56.580
 It's exceptionally well read.

1:38:56.580 --> 1:38:58.500
 No matter where life has taken you,

1:38:58.500 --> 1:39:00.260
 no matter where you come from,

1:39:00.260 --> 1:39:02.820
 the literature, the mathematics, the sciences,

1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:06.460
 they're all like extremely well educated.

1:39:06.460 --> 1:39:11.460
 And that creates a fascinating populace.

1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:15.140
 Like then you take that education,

1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:18.380
 that excellent early education

1:39:18.380 --> 1:39:22.060
 and you throw a bunch of hardship at those people.

1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:26.380
 And then they kind of cook in that hardship

1:39:26.380 --> 1:39:29.180
 and come out really fascinating people on the other end.

1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:32.580
 It makes me surprised sort of that, for instance,

1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:35.780
 like Russian medical science is not,

1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:38.860
 doesn't, you don't see a lot of sort of studies,

1:39:38.860 --> 1:39:41.100
 medical studies, advancing of medical science

1:39:41.100 --> 1:39:42.380
 come out of Russia.

1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:44.660
 It's just sort of, I'm surprised sort of,

1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:45.900
 I wish that it would, you know,

1:39:45.900 --> 1:39:49.420
 I visited Akademgorodok outside Novosibirsk,

1:39:49.420 --> 1:39:51.300
 which is an entire city the Soviets created

1:39:51.300 --> 1:39:52.540
 just for the study of science.

1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:54.500
 And it's like, there's the geology building

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:55.900
 and there's the biology building

1:39:55.900 --> 1:39:57.420
 and there's the chemistry building.

1:39:57.420 --> 1:40:00.300
 And I just feel like Russia has this potential

1:40:00.300 --> 1:40:03.100
 to be a science powerhouse or even in the medical sciences,

1:40:03.100 --> 1:40:05.620
 but I guess you just, I don't see it.

1:40:05.620 --> 1:40:06.820
 I'm not sure why.

1:40:07.660 --> 1:40:10.580
 I mean, you can certainly guess as to why.

1:40:10.580 --> 1:40:13.620
 And I see the same thing in the other,

1:40:13.620 --> 1:40:15.900
 in the sciences, I hold the dearest sort of

1:40:15.900 --> 1:40:19.620
 in computer science, in engineering fields.

1:40:20.780 --> 1:40:25.060
 I kind of long held this desire by long,

1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:27.060
 I mean, last couple of years

1:40:27.060 --> 1:40:29.420
 because a bunch of people reached out to me

1:40:29.420 --> 1:40:33.060
 from Yandex and Moscow state to give lectures there,

1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:34.620
 to sort of connect, you know,

1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:37.740
 why so little science is coming out of there?

1:40:37.740 --> 1:40:41.540
 Why so little that we hear about?

1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:42.700
 And it feels like we should be able

1:40:42.700 --> 1:40:44.820
 to bridge the scientific community.

1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:49.820
 Like science, let's even say,

1:40:49.820 --> 1:40:51.780
 even in torumological politics,

1:40:51.780 --> 1:40:53.700
 even in global conflict,

1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:56.740
 I feel like science should be bigger than that.

1:40:56.740 --> 1:41:00.460
 But why do we not hear from the scientists

1:41:00.460 --> 1:41:03.500
 is because of the limitations on human freedoms,

1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:05.060
 on scientific freedoms.

1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:09.100
 I feel like in China, in Russia,

1:41:09.100 --> 1:41:12.100
 in any regime of its sort,

1:41:13.140 --> 1:41:17.780
 you should give freedom to scientists to flourish

1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:19.180
 and to interact with others.

1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:20.860
 And you can only grow from that.

1:41:20.860 --> 1:41:22.300
 You shouldn't suppress that.

1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:27.380
 The sort of Cold War ideas, we should put those aside.

1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:31.140
 As somebody who spent time in Russia,

1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:34.140
 as somebody who learned Russian,

1:41:35.580 --> 1:41:38.620
 do you have some thoughts that you want to say

1:41:38.620 --> 1:41:40.380
 about the war in Ukraine currently?

1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:43.420
 It's tragic, of course,

1:41:44.540 --> 1:41:47.540
 seemingly pointless to watch the destruction

1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:48.940
 of a country in real time.

1:41:51.540 --> 1:41:53.780
 I guess it's, you know, when you read Russian history

1:41:53.780 --> 1:41:55.820
 and Ukrainian history, I guess it just,

1:41:55.820 --> 1:41:59.940
 it's sort of, you know, destruction is a big part of it.

1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:02.780
 The populace being beaten down is a big part of it,

1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.580
 you know, from the Mongolian hordes

1:42:06.780 --> 1:42:09.140
 through the Tsar and the Soviets and Putin.

1:42:09.140 --> 1:42:12.300
 I guess, you know, it's just in science,

1:42:12.300 --> 1:42:13.540
 in particular medical science,

1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:15.900
 it feels like this sort of unrealized potential,

1:42:15.900 --> 1:42:18.140
 you know, the culture is so beautiful,

1:42:18.140 --> 1:42:20.620
 the people are so smart and well educated.

1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:23.100
 I think the word unrealized potential

1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:24.380
 is kind of how I feel.

1:42:24.380 --> 1:42:27.580
 That's why I wanted to celebrate that part of the world.

1:42:27.580 --> 1:42:29.380
 Is there so many beautiful people,

1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:31.020
 so many brilliant people?

1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:33.620
 And I just happened to know the language,

1:42:33.620 --> 1:42:36.500
 so I'm able to appreciate the beauty of those people.

1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:38.660
 I'm sure the same is true in China.

1:42:38.660 --> 1:42:40.020
 I'm sure that that's one of the things

1:42:40.020 --> 1:42:42.220
 that makes me sad is there's all these cultures

1:42:42.220 --> 1:42:44.700
 that I don't know about.

1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:46.420
 I can't fully appreciate their brilliance.

1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:50.580
 Even Japan and places like that that are sort of,

1:42:50.580 --> 1:42:52.940
 there's channels of communication wide open

1:42:52.940 --> 1:42:55.780
 and there's a lot of interaction is still not knowing

1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:58.620
 the language, I feel like I miss some of the culture

1:42:58.620 --> 1:43:00.740
 or Portuguese and, you know,

1:43:00.740 --> 1:43:03.340
 looking at South America and all that kind of stuff.

1:43:04.500 --> 1:43:05.460
 But anyway, in Russia,

1:43:05.460 --> 1:43:08.380
 there certainly is that unrealized potential.

1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:12.060
 In Ukraine, so many brilliant scientists,

1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:14.500
 engineers came from Ukraine, from Russia.

1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:18.500
 And I hope they get to flourish soon.

1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:20.220
 And I hope we put this,

1:43:20.220 --> 1:43:25.780
 I hope we stop this war, because all war is hell.

1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:32.660
 Is there something to comment about the biology of war?

1:43:35.900 --> 1:43:39.420
 Is there echoes of the emergency room experience?

1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:46.020
 Have you dealt with patients

1:43:46.780 --> 1:43:48.540
 that have been touched by wartime?

1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:51.980
 Definitely war and medicine has a very intricate

1:43:51.980 --> 1:43:53.740
 and complex relationship.

1:43:53.740 --> 1:43:55.780
 I don't know if it was Walt Whitman who said it,

1:43:55.780 --> 1:43:58.180
 though he was a nurse during the Civil War,

1:43:58.180 --> 1:44:00.180
 that war is the best medical school,

1:44:00.180 --> 1:44:01.780
 but some people have said that.

1:44:02.780 --> 1:44:05.980
 And, you know, even the advancements in medicine

1:44:05.980 --> 1:44:09.700
 come from war, you know, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

1:44:09.700 --> 1:44:12.900
 have in some ways really revolutionized certain aspects

1:44:12.900 --> 1:44:14.700
 of the way we treat trauma patients

1:44:14.700 --> 1:44:16.340
 in the civilian world as well.

1:44:16.340 --> 1:44:18.740
 The importance of tourniquets,

1:44:18.740 --> 1:44:20.860
 the importance of transusing whole blood

1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:23.340
 instead of, you know, red blood cells isolated

1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:25.780
 from serum and platelets, et cetera.

1:44:25.780 --> 1:44:27.900
 The importance of pain control in the battlefield,

1:44:27.900 --> 1:44:29.300
 that's changed dramatically.

1:44:29.300 --> 1:44:31.060
 Everything from ketamine injections

1:44:31.060 --> 1:44:34.180
 to fentanyl lollipops in the battlefield.

1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:37.580
 So war has really improved medicine in many ways.

1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:41.380
 In another way, you know, the Department of Defense

1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:43.140
 spends a lot of money on medical research

1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:45.340
 and kind of really pushes the envelope

1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:48.900
 you know, DARPA is one aspect of the military budget

1:44:48.900 --> 1:44:51.580
 that really funds these moonshot experiments

1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:54.620
 that are really fascinating and to really push

1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:58.460
 the frontiers more than seemingly most, you know,

1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:01.740
 kind of universities doing doctors and researchers

1:45:01.740 --> 1:45:03.060
 doing their research.

1:45:03.060 --> 1:45:05.620
 So in a way, you know, the space program

1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:07.220
 which sort of was military initially

1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:09.140
 then became civilian under NASA

1:45:09.140 --> 1:45:12.540
 also led to a lot of advances and understandings

1:45:12.540 --> 1:45:14.220
 of health, you know, on Earth.

1:45:14.220 --> 1:45:17.460
 And in space, so the military is,

1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:21.460
 or war in general is a huge way that medicine advances

1:45:21.460 --> 1:45:24.220
 not to mention the epidemics that come, you know.

1:45:24.220 --> 1:45:27.220
 My grandmother was from what's today Moldova,

1:45:27.220 --> 1:45:32.220
 what was then Romania, she got typhus during World War II.

1:45:32.220 --> 1:45:34.220
 So there's typhus outbreaks, there's cholera outbreaks,

1:45:34.220 --> 1:45:37.620
 you know, all these even infectious disease things

1:45:37.620 --> 1:45:39.620
 can advance in war, which you wouldn't expect.

1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:42.420
 You expect sort of trauma to be the sort of main problem.

1:45:42.420 --> 1:45:44.820
 But actually infection is a huge problem

1:45:44.820 --> 1:45:45.820
 throughout history in war.

1:45:45.820 --> 1:45:47.820
 So we can learn a lot.

1:45:47.820 --> 1:45:50.420
 It's this kind of horrific natural experiment

1:45:50.420 --> 1:45:52.420
 in medical care.

1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:55.420
 Yeah, and I've recently been reading about

1:45:55.420 --> 1:45:58.420
 some of the horrific medical experiments

1:45:58.420 --> 1:46:02.420
 performed by Nazi scientists, Nazi Germany.

1:46:02.420 --> 1:46:05.420
 I'll talk about it another time, perhaps,

1:46:05.420 --> 1:46:10.420
 but nothing reveals the honesty of human biology like war.

1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:15.420
 Just to stay on your wild journeys for a little bit longer.

1:46:15.420 --> 1:46:18.420
 You have a tweet about Shackleton saying,

1:46:18.420 --> 1:46:21.420
 here's a photo of Shackleton's medical kit

1:46:21.420 --> 1:46:25.420
 from his storied expedition to Antarctica in the 1910s.

1:46:25.420 --> 1:46:29.420
 Some paragoric for pain, some laxatives.

1:46:29.420 --> 1:46:32.420
 Only the essentials.

1:46:32.420 --> 1:46:35.420
 Would you put laxatives under the essentials?

1:46:35.420 --> 1:46:37.420
 Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

1:46:37.420 --> 1:46:42.420
 When I worked as a ship doctor in Antarctica in 2018,

1:46:42.420 --> 1:46:47.420
 I had a huge cabinet full of meds and even EKG machine.

1:46:47.420 --> 1:46:52.420
 So if you can comment sort of on that contrast.

1:46:52.420 --> 1:46:55.420
 First of all, your own journey, how harsh was it?

1:46:55.420 --> 1:46:57.420
 How difficult was it?

1:46:57.420 --> 1:47:01.420
 And given that context, can you think about

1:47:01.420 --> 1:47:04.420
 how hard Shackleton's journey was?

1:47:04.420 --> 1:47:08.420
 I think the difference is unimaginably stark.

1:47:08.420 --> 1:47:12.420
 One thing I do want to point out is that the use of laxatives

1:47:12.420 --> 1:47:14.420
 early in the 20th century and before that,

1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:18.420
 they were used for a surprising number of ailments

1:47:18.420 --> 1:47:20.420
 where they probably did not help at all.

1:47:20.420 --> 1:47:24.420
 But I think that was a holdover from sort of the old theory of medicine,

1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:28.420
 the humoral theory where you have to balance the fluids in the body

1:47:28.420 --> 1:47:31.420
 and so causing people to vomit, causing them to have diarrhea

1:47:31.420 --> 1:47:36.420
 or purposely taking blood out of them in bloodletting was a big part.

1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:41.420
 And I think that crazy use of laxatives was maybe a holdover from that time.

1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:45.420
 But that being said, they were probably not eating very high fiber food

1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:49.420
 on that expedition, so perhaps laxatives could have been helpful.

1:47:49.420 --> 1:47:54.420
 You know, there's a lot of seal, penguin and seal meat being eaten,

1:47:54.420 --> 1:47:56.420
 which is not super high in fiber.

1:47:56.420 --> 1:48:00.420
 So I don't want to discount the importance of laxatives in that setting.

1:48:00.420 --> 1:48:04.420
 But that wouldn't be the essential thing if you're thinking of a tiny kit

1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:06.420
 that has only the essentials.

1:48:06.420 --> 1:48:11.420
 I mean, pain, yes, laxatives, I don't know, maybe not.

1:48:11.420 --> 1:48:15.420
 I think the medical kit possibilities were much narrower back then.

1:48:15.420 --> 1:48:18.420
 You know, this was before antibiotics,

1:48:18.420 --> 1:48:23.420
 before I think germ theory might have been, you know, it was known,

1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:25.420
 but there wasn't much to do about it.

1:48:25.420 --> 1:48:27.420
 So the availability of medicines,

1:48:27.420 --> 1:48:30.420
 I mean, that's something that exploded over the course of the 20th century.

1:48:30.420 --> 1:48:34.420
 So what I can put in a backpack today filled with modern medications,

1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:37.420
 whether injectable or to be taken orally is, you know,

1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:41.420
 just many orders of magnitude greater than what they had back then.

1:48:41.420 --> 1:48:46.420
 So when I, I mean, when I went, my expedition was nothing like Shackleton's.

1:48:46.420 --> 1:48:51.420
 I was on a huge cruise ship with 160 Japanese passengers

1:48:51.420 --> 1:48:53.420
 who came with their own translators.

1:48:53.420 --> 1:48:58.420
 And as I said, I had a cabinet, not just one cabinet,

1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:04.420
 many cabinets full of medications, both injectable, some patches, some pills.

1:49:04.420 --> 1:49:08.420
 I was very impressed actually with what was available there.

1:49:08.420 --> 1:49:11.420
 And I didn't have to use a lot of it, thankfully,

1:49:11.420 --> 1:49:13.420
 though I did use some of it for people.

1:49:13.420 --> 1:49:19.420
 But, and I slept in, you know, I got free room and board on the ship.

1:49:19.420 --> 1:49:24.420
 Every southern summer cruise ships go take people to Antarctica,

1:49:24.420 --> 1:49:28.420
 the Southern Atlantic Islands, like the Falklands and other parts of the South Pacific.

1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:33.420
 And then in the northern summer, the same kind of cruise ship explosion happens,

1:49:33.420 --> 1:49:37.420
 you know, going to Greenland and Iceland and Svalbard and Franz Josef Land

1:49:37.420 --> 1:49:40.420
 and other parts of the North Alaska.

1:49:40.420 --> 1:49:42.420
 So, and every ship needs a doctor.

1:49:42.420 --> 1:49:44.420
 So it's a great opportunity.

1:49:44.420 --> 1:49:48.420
 They want specifically ER doctors, you know, to deal with emergencies.

1:49:48.420 --> 1:49:51.420
 But you're really working in the middle of nowhere.

1:49:51.420 --> 1:49:55.420
 And all you have is the medications there on the ship and supplies

1:49:55.420 --> 1:49:57.420
 and your knowledge and experience.

1:49:57.420 --> 1:50:01.420
 And so it's a very different experience than working in a high tech modern hospital

1:50:01.420 --> 1:50:05.420
 with every bit of technology and every subspecialist consultant available.

1:50:05.420 --> 1:50:07.420
 But I sort of like that challenge.

1:50:07.420 --> 1:50:09.420
 I mean, I like going to the ends of the earth.

1:50:09.420 --> 1:50:12.420
 It's beautiful. It's exciting. It's fascinating.

1:50:12.420 --> 1:50:15.420
 Practicing medicine in those settings is extra challenging

1:50:15.420 --> 1:50:21.420
 and really makes you hone some of your skills, which is part of the reason that I sought them out.

1:50:21.420 --> 1:50:24.420
 Do you see echoes of some of that same effort?

1:50:24.420 --> 1:50:30.420
 I've gotten a chance to interact with astronauts and those kinds of folks working on space missions.

1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:35.420
 Do you see some of those same echoes of challenging efforts going out into space

1:50:35.420 --> 1:50:41.420
 and maybe landing on Mars and maybe beginning to build a small colony on Mars?

1:50:41.420 --> 1:50:45.420
 Yeah, I think the health care that is needed will be a big part of that.

1:50:45.420 --> 1:50:49.420
 Obviously, we're probably going to send overall quite healthy people.

1:50:49.420 --> 1:50:54.420
 But there's a lot of medical decisions to make about what should be brought, what should be expected.

1:50:54.420 --> 1:50:57.420
 To some extent, I've had a lot of doctors say,

1:50:57.420 --> 1:50:59.420
 oh my goodness, I can't believe you work in the middle of nowhere.

1:50:59.420 --> 1:51:04.420
 What do you do if someone gets a brain bleed, like falls, hits their head, needs a neurosurgeon?

1:51:04.420 --> 1:51:07.420
 I mean, the obvious answer is they die.

1:51:07.420 --> 1:51:11.420
 They get things when you're in the middle of Antarctica, things kill you that wouldn't

1:51:11.420 --> 1:51:16.420
 if you're inside a university hospital that's fully equipped to help with every problem that arises.

1:51:16.420 --> 1:51:20.420
 Mars takes that to a crazy extreme, obviously.

1:51:20.420 --> 1:51:24.420
 I know that even going to Antarctica, different countries have had different strategies.

1:51:24.420 --> 1:51:31.420
 I believe Australia used to, kind of just in anticipation, remove people's gallbladders

1:51:31.420 --> 1:51:36.420
 just so that it wouldn't get inflamed because that is a very common medical emergency.

1:51:36.420 --> 1:51:39.420
 Just remove it beforehand, even though it was not disease at all.

1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:44.420
 Just so that while they're stuck in Antarctica over the winter, for instance, that wouldn't be a problem.

1:51:44.420 --> 1:51:47.420
 There's many other issues that kind of rise.

1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:49.420
 So those are some decisions to make.

1:51:49.420 --> 1:51:53.420
 Maybe the people who go into Mars should have their appendix removed, their gallbladder removed.

1:51:53.420 --> 1:51:56.420
 Maybe they should have a cardiac cath to see if they have coronary artery disease

1:51:56.420 --> 1:52:00.420
 just to know their chances of getting a heart attack there, though it's not always predictive.

1:52:00.420 --> 1:52:02.420
 It's hard to predict who's going to get a heart attack,

1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:06.420
 but maybe with all the data around today, we'll get better at predicting.

1:52:06.420 --> 1:52:07.420
 But that will be a huge part.

1:52:07.420 --> 1:52:12.420
 We can't have people, the few pioneers in a Mars colony dying of heart attacks and things like that.

1:52:12.420 --> 1:52:13.420
 Don't anticipate stuff.

1:52:13.420 --> 1:52:18.420
 Would you go, you've gone to some harsh conditions to be a doctor.

1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:20.420
 Would you go to Mars to be a doctor?

1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:26.420
 It would definitely be amazing, I think, because I have a wife and two small children,

1:52:26.420 --> 1:52:29.420
 probably not in the cards for me at this point.

1:52:29.420 --> 1:52:33.420
 But you humans with your human attachments.

1:52:33.420 --> 1:52:35.420
 Sex and death.

1:52:35.420 --> 1:52:42.420
 If you just put more priority on the death than sex, I think it would be better off.

1:52:42.420 --> 1:52:43.420
 No.

1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:45.420
 I would love to go to Mars.

1:52:45.420 --> 1:52:48.420
 And actually, I practice high altitude medicine in Nepal.

1:52:48.420 --> 1:52:50.420
 Space medicine is sort of an extension of that.

1:52:50.420 --> 1:52:53.420
 The air is just much thinner, like non existent.

1:52:53.420 --> 1:52:58.420
 As you go higher in the mountains, the things that happen to human physiology are very bizarre and strange.

1:52:58.420 --> 1:53:01.420
 And still not well explained by science.

1:53:01.420 --> 1:53:06.420
 And in space, it's just like a crazy extension of high altitude.

1:53:06.420 --> 1:53:08.420
 If I could just return to this.

1:53:08.420 --> 1:53:12.420
 We didn't really, I think we mentioned a little bit about the food you had.

1:53:12.420 --> 1:53:18.420
 Just if we can high level say, what is the greatest meal you've ever had?

1:53:18.420 --> 1:53:19.420
 So your last meal.

1:53:19.420 --> 1:53:20.420
 Let's go.

1:53:20.420 --> 1:53:25.420
 If one more meal, I get to murder you after this.

1:53:25.420 --> 1:53:26.420
 This is your last day.

1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.420
 We get to spend it together.

1:53:28.420 --> 1:53:29.420
 Where in the world would you go?

1:53:29.420 --> 1:53:31.420
 What would you eat?

1:53:31.420 --> 1:53:35.420
 I would say the most delicious thing is bone marrow.

1:53:35.420 --> 1:53:39.420
 And I would love a full meal of bone marrow for my last dish.

1:53:39.420 --> 1:53:46.420
 I did, on my birthday in 2002, eat a kilogram and a half of crab meat in Kamchatka.

1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:49.420
 And that was also amazingly delicious.

1:53:49.420 --> 1:53:52.420
 The king crab they have there is incredible.

1:53:52.420 --> 1:53:57.420
 But I would go with bone marrow, which is I think just one of the most delicious foods.

1:53:57.420 --> 1:53:59.420
 And it's sort of this weird body part.

1:53:59.420 --> 1:54:04.420
 You know, it's basically all your stem cells, not all of them, but the stem cells that produce all your blood cells.

1:54:04.420 --> 1:54:09.420
 So they are spitting out billions of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets every day.

1:54:09.420 --> 1:54:11.420
 And there's a bunch of fat in there as well.

1:54:11.420 --> 1:54:14.420
 Just one of the places the body stores fat.

1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:17.420
 And so you basically add heat and that's all you need.

1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:18.420
 It's like the perfect food.

1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:21.420
 You add heat, the fat for frying the stem cells is already there.

1:54:21.420 --> 1:54:24.420
 There's naturally a bone vessel to contain it all.

1:54:24.420 --> 1:54:26.420
 Probably add some flavor too.

1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:28.420
 It's like the perfect food.

1:54:28.420 --> 1:54:32.420
 Does it matter which animal?

1:54:32.420 --> 1:54:35.420
 I prefer a larger animal just so there's more of it.

1:54:35.420 --> 1:54:40.420
 I actually really like bone marrow from chicken bones.

1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:42.420
 Right, just sucking it out of the bone.

1:54:42.420 --> 1:54:48.420
 Yes, I'm known for leaving absolutely nothing edible on the plate except bone itself.

1:54:48.420 --> 1:54:55.420
 There's one other human I know that loves bone marrow as much as you do.

1:54:55.420 --> 1:54:56.420
 And that's Joe Rogan.

1:54:56.420 --> 1:55:01.420
 So go, it's unnatural how much that man loves bone marrow.

1:55:01.420 --> 1:55:02.420
 I understand why it's amazing.

1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:03.420
 I love the steak part.

1:55:03.420 --> 1:55:11.420
 The bone marrow, like, you know what, let me, let me argue with you because I don't know, it could be an acquired taste,

1:55:11.420 --> 1:55:19.420
 but there's just too much, it's like too much with too little work for it.

1:55:19.420 --> 1:55:26.420
 Like it's as if you gave me lobster meat without the lobster having to clean the lobster.

1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:29.420
 I just feel like I'm spoiling myself.

1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:31.420
 So it's very fatty.

1:55:31.420 --> 1:55:35.420
 I don't know, maybe I want to work for something that tastes like that.

1:55:35.420 --> 1:55:38.420
 Well, if you start from the whole animal, you do have to work to get at it, right?

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:43.420
 A lot of animals have the teeth and the jaw muscles to chomp through bone.

1:55:43.420 --> 1:55:44.420
 We do not.

1:55:44.420 --> 1:55:48.420
 So, you know, when you buy it from the store, it's already sawed up,

1:55:48.420 --> 1:55:52.420
 but I've definitely gotten marrow out of deer bones, you know, with a hatchet,

1:55:52.420 --> 1:55:56.420
 just chop off the fat end and start spooning it out.

1:55:56.420 --> 1:55:57.420
 Well, maybe I'll revisit it.

1:55:57.420 --> 1:55:58.420
 That's fascinating.

1:55:58.420 --> 1:56:01.420
 And where, where would you eat it?

1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:03.420
 Where, in which place of the world?

1:56:03.420 --> 1:56:09.420
 Is there something about who cooks it, who you eat it with?

1:56:09.420 --> 1:56:12.420
 You're not allowed to pick your family.

1:56:12.420 --> 1:56:13.420
 Right.

1:56:13.420 --> 1:56:21.420
 So, like, which place in the world, rural or in the city, those kinds of things,

1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:24.420
 you've been to so many fascinating places.

1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:30.420
 I would say Antarctica, I would say, is one of the most picturesque places I've ever been.

1:56:30.420 --> 1:56:34.420
 I really did not, I didn't know how mountainous it was.

1:56:34.420 --> 1:56:39.420
 And I guess I knew there'd be ice, but just, I didn't know how much ice it was.

1:56:39.420 --> 1:56:41.420
 You know, it's ice and mountains, just overwhelming.

1:56:41.420 --> 1:56:45.420
 I just, you know, as, as kind of overwhelming bone marrow might seem to you,

1:56:45.420 --> 1:56:48.420
 sort of that feast for your eyes.

1:56:48.420 --> 1:56:51.420
 And just ice in general is amazing.

1:56:51.420 --> 1:56:54.420
 Like the icebergs floating around in Antarctica is just astounding.

1:56:54.420 --> 1:56:59.420
 Like the different shapes, the sizes are incredible.

1:56:59.420 --> 1:57:03.420
 There's actually a, I believe it's a U.S. Navy website that tracks the largest icebergs.

1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:08.420
 And you can read about each of them and how big they are and just the formations you see.

1:57:08.420 --> 1:57:12.420
 Similar up near Greenland, though I have not been to Greenland,

1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:14.420
 just ice in general is just amazing.

1:57:14.420 --> 1:57:18.420
 So I could just look at its different forms while eating bone marrow forever until you kill me.

1:57:18.420 --> 1:57:19.420
 Yeah.

1:57:19.420 --> 1:57:21.420
 And afterwards we go.

1:57:21.420 --> 1:57:24.420
 It's back to the death of the death and sex.

1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:26.420
 What is it about the ice?

1:57:26.420 --> 1:57:29.420
 Is it sort of the normity of nature?

1:57:29.420 --> 1:57:34.420
 It just reminds you that it's going to be there before you and after.

1:57:34.420 --> 1:57:39.420
 And then you get to partake in the eating of the thing you need

1:57:39.420 --> 1:57:44.420
 for maintaining of your biological, temporary biological organism.

1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:45.420
 Yeah.

1:57:45.420 --> 1:57:46.420
 I think it's a few things.

1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:50.420
 One is just the shapes that you see, you know, the wave action,

1:57:50.420 --> 1:57:53.420
 just eating away at these pieces of ice.

1:57:53.420 --> 1:57:55.420
 You get these arches and just these shapes.

1:57:55.420 --> 1:57:57.420
 I mean, it's just like geometry.

1:57:57.420 --> 1:57:59.420
 The geometry alone is amazing.

1:57:59.420 --> 1:58:04.420
 I studied math as an undergrad and I've always appreciated geometry.

1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:09.420
 And just the shapes alone are just look like brilliant works of modernist art.

1:58:09.420 --> 1:58:12.420
 And just obviously no two are ever the same.

1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:18.420
 Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color that is just really startling and fascinating.

1:58:18.420 --> 1:58:22.420
 The same color of glaciers, you know, in various parts of the world.

1:58:22.420 --> 1:58:25.420
 That blue color is just really amazing.

1:58:25.420 --> 1:58:31.420
 And I also just love how it's sort of this constant shedding from our Antarctic continent from Greenland.

1:58:31.420 --> 1:58:36.420
 You know, it's this constant process of snow falling inland and pushing the glaciers further out to sea

1:58:36.420 --> 1:58:38.420
 and then breaking loose.

1:58:38.420 --> 1:58:40.420
 I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days,

1:58:40.420 --> 1:58:46.420
 but it's sort of this constant shedding and sort of I always like thinking about how the body has something similar.

1:58:46.420 --> 1:58:51.420
 You know, we're constantly shedding and renewing and rebuilding everything.

1:58:51.420 --> 1:58:55.420
 And so ice is sort of this constant similar process.

1:58:55.420 --> 1:59:00.420
 Yeah, I did not know you were a math undergrad.

1:59:00.420 --> 1:59:04.420
 So that I mean, you're just keep getting more fascinating.

1:59:04.420 --> 1:59:08.420
 Can you maybe take a small step into that direction?

1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:11.420
 What do you find beautiful about mathematics?

1:59:11.420 --> 1:59:15.420
 Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time?

1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:16.420
 I liked math.

1:59:16.420 --> 1:59:18.420
 I especially like so college math.

1:59:18.420 --> 1:59:20.420
 I did some calculus in high school.

1:59:20.420 --> 1:59:26.420
 When I got to college math, I was amazed that there were no more numbers, you know, the digits disappeared.

1:59:26.420 --> 1:59:32.420
 It was just variables, concepts, you know, there was almost no more numbers at all.

1:59:32.420 --> 1:59:38.420
 It was like this totally abstract, you know, kind of way of thinking.

1:59:38.420 --> 1:59:41.420
 But that sort of reflects the natural world and teaches you about the natural world,

1:59:41.420 --> 1:59:46.420
 though it's sort of this perfect, you know, platonic ideal, perhaps of the natural world

1:59:46.420 --> 1:59:49.420
 that can still sort of help explain what happens in the natural world.

1:59:49.420 --> 1:59:56.420
 But just these concepts are so abstract from like life and from, you know, the natural world.

1:59:56.420 --> 2:00:02.420
 I was actually getting interested in the natural world at the same time when I was in at NYU studying math.

2:00:02.420 --> 2:00:09.420
 You know, I took a tour of Central Park that was pointing, the guy Steve Brill was pointing out these wild edible plants.

2:00:09.420 --> 2:00:13.420
 And I was learning to identify the first plants and knowing what's edible, what's not.

2:00:13.420 --> 2:00:18.420
 That was totally fascinating and sort of this kind of thing that I felt like was connecting me to nature.

2:00:18.420 --> 2:00:23.420
 And it was balanced with this utterly abstract science, you know,

2:00:23.420 --> 2:00:28.420
 or utterly abstract lessons I was getting in math class where I was thinking through series, you know,

2:00:28.420 --> 2:00:34.420
 as we approach infinity, what happens to these equations and concepts of like rings and abstract algebra.

2:00:34.420 --> 2:00:39.420
 I don't know, it was just this dichotomy that I enjoyed both aspects of.

2:00:39.420 --> 2:00:51.420
 Yeah, the concepts, but so, so different, this kind of logical, rigorous view of the world and the world of biology.

2:00:51.420 --> 2:01:04.420
 Why the big, how did that feel to take the leap into the biological, the mushy mess of the human body from the mathematical, which is all very clean.

2:01:04.420 --> 2:01:07.420
 Right. It does, it does feel like a big step.

2:01:07.420 --> 2:01:12.420
 I think there's more connection than you think, you know, we talked about symmetry of the body earlier.

2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:21.420
 That is a real thing, you know, fluid dynamics of how our various bodily fluids flow and what makes them not flow as well and what makes them flow better.

2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:27.420
 And, you know, all these different aspects of science go into the body.

2:01:27.420 --> 2:01:35.420
 You know, everything from hard bone to softer kind of flesh to liquids of various consistencies.

2:01:35.420 --> 2:01:45.420
 You know, a lot of science does and math does teach you about kind of how the body works, how it can work better, what happens in sort of disease states.

2:01:45.420 --> 2:01:48.420
 Yeah, I suppose there's a, there's a connection.

2:01:48.420 --> 2:01:54.420
 There's also kind of a sort of computational biologists.

2:01:54.420 --> 2:02:00.420
 There's computational equivalents of each of the disciplines, which are becoming more and more fascinating,

2:02:00.420 --> 2:02:09.420
 with all the work that DeepMind is doing in the work of genetics, all that kind of stuff, simulating different parts of the body to try to gain an intuition and understanding of it.

2:02:09.420 --> 2:02:16.420
 That to me is super fascinating, but sometimes it does feel like an oversimplification of the way the body really does it,

2:02:16.420 --> 2:02:24.420
 because the body is an incredibly weird, complex system and it finds a way.

2:02:24.420 --> 2:02:30.420
 The adaptability, the resilience, the redundancy that's built in, it's weird.

2:02:30.420 --> 2:02:40.420
 It's incredibly powerful and so unlike the kind of computer based systems that we build, at least we engineer in the software engineering world,

2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:50.420
 which kind of starts to make you think, how can we engineer computer systems in a different way that make them more resilient in the real world?

2:02:50.420 --> 2:02:53.420
 That's sort of a robotics question.

2:02:53.420 --> 2:02:55.420
 What do you think about that?

2:02:55.420 --> 2:03:02.420
 What does it take to build a humanoid robot or robots that are as resilient as the human body?

2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.420
 How difficult do you think is that problem?

2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:11.420
 Having studied the human body, how hard is the engineering problem of building systems like that guy over there,

2:03:11.420 --> 2:03:19.420
 the legged guy that is as resilient as the human body to the harsh conditions of the real world?

2:03:19.420 --> 2:03:22.420
 I think it's very hard and we definitely haven't gotten there yet.

2:03:22.420 --> 2:03:29.420
 I think we could probably learn lessons from people who are trying to grow artificial organs in the lab to eventually transplant into people,

2:03:29.420 --> 2:03:36.420
 which would solve the huge problem of needing to get those organs from others and the rejection of putting a foreign material inside your body.

2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:40.420
 Your immune system tends not to like that.

2:03:40.420 --> 2:03:42.420
 That has advanced a lot recently.

2:03:42.420 --> 2:03:49.420
 I think some advances actually have been where we pay a lot of attention to stem cells, stem cells, stem cells.

2:03:49.420 --> 2:03:56.420
 We can grow whatever we want out of stem cells, but now there's sort of a recognition that what we call the extracellular matrix,

2:03:56.420 --> 2:04:05.420
 which is sort of the foundation of the body, the thing that holds all the cells into their proper shape and keeps them where they should be.

2:04:05.420 --> 2:04:09.420
 That is actually crucial and there's probably a lot of signaling that goes on.

2:04:09.420 --> 2:04:12.420
 You stick a stem cell on the right extracellular matrix.

2:04:12.420 --> 2:04:17.420
 It will turn into the kind of cell that you want and take the right shape and position and start functioning.

2:04:17.420 --> 2:04:25.420
 I think that's been a huge advance knowing that it's not just these celebrity stem cells that are the answer.

2:04:25.420 --> 2:04:31.420
 It's this kind of part in the background, this sort of just like laying the foundation, the system that you put these cells onto.

2:04:31.420 --> 2:04:39.420
 We're not there yet, but there's definitely a lot happening, a lot of research happening and I think there'll be some advances probably soon.

2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:47.420
 So now on the topic of interaction of computational systems with biology.

2:04:47.420 --> 2:04:56.420
 So if you look at a company like Neuralink or the whole effort of brain computer interfaces, now there's a neurosurgery component there.

2:04:56.420 --> 2:05:04.420
 We have to connect electrical systems with biological systems.

2:05:04.420 --> 2:05:10.420
 So just even the implanting is difficult, then the communication is difficult.

2:05:10.420 --> 2:05:18.420
 What would you say from what you know about the brain, what you know about the human body and all the beautiful mess that's there?

2:05:18.420 --> 2:05:22.420
 How difficult is the effort of Neuralink? Do you think it's feasible?

2:05:22.420 --> 2:05:24.420
 I think it's definitely feasible.

2:05:24.420 --> 2:05:31.420
 I think we need to probably know more than we do and know how to connect it in all these ways.

2:05:31.420 --> 2:05:40.420
 I think some advances, for instance, much less sexy but really already impacting medical care is something called deep brain stimulation,

2:05:40.420 --> 2:05:48.420
 which is done for Parkinson's disease and others where neurosurgeons implant this device that's electrically stimulates the part of the brain

2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:53.420
 that is not functioning in Parkinson's disease and it's quite dramatic how effective it works.

2:05:53.420 --> 2:06:02.420
 I remember as a med student watching a neurologist literally turn the electricity up on this handheld thing and you could see the person's Parkinson tremor go away

2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:06.420
 and you could see them start to walk in a more steady fashion.

2:06:06.420 --> 2:06:19.420
 There may be studies in the future studying the same deep brain stimulation for everything from eating disorders to severe OCD,

2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:25.420
 like paralyzing OCD, not just like, I want to wash my hands three times.

2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:35.420
 I think the potential is there but I guess connecting the brain in a microscopic way in sort of a multifaceted way,

2:06:35.420 --> 2:06:40.420
 there needs to be sort of a million connections or some very high number of connections for them to work fluidly.

2:06:40.420 --> 2:06:43.420
 As far as I know, I'm not an expert in the area.

2:06:43.420 --> 2:06:50.420
 First of all, I believe and I trust in the adaptability of the biological system to whatever crazy stuff you try to shove in there.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:57.420
 So it's going to potentially reject things, but it's also going to, if it doesn't reject things, adapt.

2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:08.420
 And if we can create computational systems that also adapt, AI systems that adapt and can kind of both of them reach towards each other and figure stuff out.

2:07:08.420 --> 2:07:19.420
 But actually our current AI systems are not very adaptable in the wild way that biology is adaptable, like adaptable to anything.

2:07:19.420 --> 2:07:23.420
 And if we can build AI systems like that, I feel like there's some interesting things you could do.

2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:29.420
 But of course, there's ethics and there's real human lives at stake.

2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:32.420
 And there you can't quite experiment.

2:07:32.420 --> 2:07:34.420
 You have to have things that work.

2:07:34.420 --> 2:07:43.420
 And maybe simulation can help, but reality is it's a dangerous playground to play on.

2:07:43.420 --> 2:07:45.420
 It is messy.

2:07:45.420 --> 2:07:56.420
 You tweeted that quote, if you look back from far enough into the future, every doctor today will look like a total quack.

2:07:56.420 --> 2:07:59.420
 First of all, that's humbling to think about.

2:07:59.420 --> 2:08:09.420
 Like we don't know what we're doing in the great, like there's been so much progress that we kind of have this confidence that we figured it all out.

2:08:09.420 --> 2:08:18.420
 If you look at history and you read how people thought, I mean, there's so many moments in history where people really thought that they figured it all out.

2:08:18.420 --> 2:08:23.420
 It's almost like there's nothing else left to do at every stage in history.

2:08:23.420 --> 2:08:29.420
 And then you realize, no, progress often happens like exponentially.

2:08:29.420 --> 2:08:33.420
 And every moment you continue to think you figured it all out.

2:08:33.420 --> 2:08:39.420
 But if you're being honest, if you're being humble, then you realize we're just shrouded in mystery.

2:08:39.420 --> 2:08:41.420
 So what do we make of this?

2:08:41.420 --> 2:08:42.420
 Like how should we feel that?

2:08:42.420 --> 2:08:44.420
 How should you feel as a doctor?

2:08:44.420 --> 2:08:54.420
 How should we feel as scientific explorers of the human body, the fact that we're probably going to be wrong about everything we currently know?

2:08:54.420 --> 2:09:02.420
 Right. There's a saying actually, by the time you finish med school, half of what you learned is wrong, which is quite illustrative.

2:09:02.420 --> 2:09:10.420
 And becoming more true as time goes on, you know, so much medical research going on, so much learning going on, it's really wonderful in a way.

2:09:10.420 --> 2:09:14.420
 But in some ways, we still learn these concepts, you know, from the past.

2:09:14.420 --> 2:09:24.420
 And I know when you take a test as a medical student, sometimes you know they want you to give the old answer, but you know there's a new answer because of recent science.

2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:28.420
 But you know to give the old answer, that's now incorrect to get the question right on the test.

2:09:28.420 --> 2:09:32.420
 That happens actually quite a bit because things change so quickly.

2:09:32.420 --> 2:09:39.420
 Yet, you know, when I look back at doctors from centuries past, I mean, it's absurd what they were doing to their patients.

2:09:39.420 --> 2:09:43.420
 I mean, probably for most of human history, they were doing more harm than good.

2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:45.420
 You know, they're draining people of their blood.

2:09:45.420 --> 2:09:50.420
 That was, you know, bloodletting was a huge part of medical care.

2:09:50.420 --> 2:10:00.420
 You know, George Washington died of a paratonsular abscess, an abscess right next to the tonsil, which has the great name of Quincy, and they bled him to death.

2:10:00.420 --> 2:10:05.420
 You know, I mean, kind of adding insult to injury. Doctors are menace and do a lot of harm.

2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:13.420
 I mean, hopefully not intentionally. You know, even medical errors are still a huge problem, cause of death and morbidity.

2:10:13.420 --> 2:10:19.420
 So we do a lot of things that are not great, but you know, our knowledge, it's very imperfect at this point.

2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:28.420
 I do have some confidence. You know, I guess perfect scientific studies that try to get at the reality of the universe are essential.

2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:38.420
 Because when I think of why a certain medication works for a certain condition, it might make perfect sense in my head knowing the biology, the biochemistry, the anatomy.

2:10:38.420 --> 2:10:44.420
 It makes perfect sense. It must work. I gave it to the patient. They got better and that's happened 20 times in the last year.

2:10:44.420 --> 2:10:50.420
 But it's, you know, I'm wrong. Like when you actually do a study, it actually doesn't help. Maybe it hurts.

2:10:50.420 --> 2:11:00.420
 And that's really, I think the way we explain medications working in our minds is often wrong when you end up finally doing the study.

2:11:00.420 --> 2:11:05.420
 And some of the most interesting experiments involve what we call sham surgery.

2:11:05.420 --> 2:11:16.420
 So for instance, people who injure their knee, you know, arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon goes in there with a scope, gets bits of bone out, shaves down the cartilage, you know, cleans things up.

2:11:16.420 --> 2:11:25.420
 And it helps some people, but they actually did some studies where one group of people got the true arthroscopy and others just got sham surgery where they put them to sleep,

2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:33.420
 made little cuts in the skin so that they woke up with scars. And then it turned out that it's not clear arthroscopy is actually helping.

2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:41.420
 And the same, there was a recent huge study of putting a stent in someone's coronary arteries if they have stable chest pain.

2:11:41.420 --> 2:11:52.420
 Not like I'm having a heart attack. You need a stent like right then. But, you know, kind of chronic coronary artery disease where every time I run up the stairs, like a chest pain, then when I rest, it goes away.

2:11:52.420 --> 2:12:04.420
 Like obviously you put a stent, you increase blood flow to the heart. Like how could that not work? But then when they did the sham catheterization, it actually looks like it might not actually help better than the sham.

2:12:04.420 --> 2:12:16.420
 So I think those placebo controlled studies are essential. I mean, it is shocking, and this has been driven home during the last two years, how hard it is to figure out what the hell's going on in the universe and especially with our bodies.

2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:31.420
 Like it is really hard to get at the truth. And what you think makes sense, like often turns out, I mean, the history of modern medicine is littered with examples where it made perfect sense and it seemed to help some patients and it turns out it's not doing anything or it's harmful.

2:12:31.420 --> 2:12:41.420
 There's all kinds of narratives swimming around. We convinced ourselves as a human civilization that something is true. There's propaganda machines. There's just self delusion.

2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:51.420
 There's centralized communities. Like there's a scientific community that believes a certain thing. There's the conspiracy theories that believe a certain thing.

2:12:51.420 --> 2:13:02.420
 Sometimes the scientific community writes, sometimes the conspiracy theorists are right throughout human history. I mean, and we now think the scientific community, well, now the science has really figured it out.

2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:19.420
 We're way smarter than we were in the past. And then there's these like interesting studies that I've seen. I think Robin Hansen mentioned it to me, that if you look at the entirety of medication, like the effect of medication on human health,

2:13:19.420 --> 2:13:37.420
 if you do those kinds of broad studies, does it actually help? Like does quality of life, lifespan, certain measures of the well being, if you look at human society as a whole, does taking medication or not actually help?

2:13:37.420 --> 2:13:58.420
 And those studies find there's no positive or negative effect with medication. And that's a very kind of interesting perspective. I mean, you could probably argue a lot of ways, but the point is, because you can bring up literally a billion cases where

2:13:58.420 --> 2:14:12.420
 medication has significant positive impact on a particular patient, but you have to kind of zoom out and honestly look at the positive effects of medicine, of lifestyle choices, diet choices, of exercise or not.

2:14:12.420 --> 2:14:24.420
 You know, maybe we'll find eventually that exercise actually bad for you. Maybe like there's all kinds of things that we're going to, I feel like we're going to figure out.

2:14:24.420 --> 2:14:43.420
 One of the things I think we're going to figure out, everything I've learned about my body is that, aside from it being adaptable, there's a lot of very unique parameters that are opaque to me that I'm measuring through this feedback mechanism by trying stuff and learning about it.

2:14:43.420 --> 2:15:02.420
 And one of the things we might learn is that medicine cannot be done without collecting a huge amount of data about each individual human. So like it's absurd to be, like if I show up and see a doctor, it's absurd for that doctor to have just a couple of minutes with me.

2:15:02.420 --> 2:15:30.420
 Like just, like looking at basic symptoms, looking at such like crappy data, like first of all, no long term data, no longitude, no data, no historical data, no detailed analysis of all the possible things, not just related to your symptoms, but related to other things that you're not complaining about.

2:15:30.420 --> 2:15:41.420
 Just giving you a full picture of the data and then using AI to help the human doctor highlight the things that you should perhaps pay extra attention to.

2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:55.420
 I think we'll look back at this time as ridiculous that doctors were expected to help anybody whatsoever without having the data, without having a huge amount of data about the human body. Like you have to do so much with so little data.

2:15:55.420 --> 2:16:04.420
 It's very 19th century. It's very 19th century. So it relies on the brilliance of doctors and of course the intuition, the instinct you build up over time.

2:16:04.420 --> 2:16:22.420
 And that's quite powerful. The human brain is pretty damn good for using experience to teach you how to make a good decision, but still it's, you might as well be bloodletting. Like it's humbling to think about that. It's humbling.

2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:37.420
 It is humbling and it's important. I think doctors sometimes lose that humble perspective on what they do. And I think it's very important because as I said, you know, medical history is just medical dogma has been tossed into the trash bin so many times.

2:16:37.420 --> 2:16:46.420
 Something doctors were sure of was the case is not. And it's important to be cognizant of that.

2:16:46.420 --> 2:16:55.420
 You tweeted about somebody that had a big impact just by reading about him on my life as well.

2:16:55.420 --> 2:16:57.420
 I still think about him.

2:16:57.420 --> 2:17:15.420
 Rest in peace, Dr. Paul Farmer, a big inspiration to me. His medical career was a testament to what one person can do to improve the world. So who was Paul Farmer? And what made him a great doctor and a great man and somebody who was an inspiration to you?

2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:30.420
 So Paul Farmer was a kind of pioneer of global health. He started Partners in Health, which is kind of an international health organization that operates originally in Haiti, also Rwanda and elsewhere.

2:17:30.420 --> 2:17:50.420
 And I think he was just so a zealot for getting health care to some of the poorest people in the world. And I remember reading some of his books and a book about him by Tracy Kitter, that's really great, Mountains Beyond Mountains, about how even when he was a medical student, he was flying back and forth to Haiti in between exams

2:17:50.420 --> 2:18:10.420
 and just with this really intense focus and interest in getting health care to where it's not. And I think traveling around the world, especially to poorer places like India, Calcutta, Nepal, you really see how unevenly the benefits of modern medicine are spread over the surface of the earth.

2:18:10.420 --> 2:18:30.420
 Not only because if you're an Antarctica and have a heart attack, you're in serious trouble, but just medications that cost pennies a day can help people. A lot of children in India under five die of diarrhea and all they need is oral rehydration solutions to stay hydrated.

2:18:30.420 --> 2:18:44.420
 They can't afford IV fluids, for instance, to get admitted to the hospital and really dehydration just kills hundreds of thousands of kids throughout the world. Not to mention, bacterial pneumonia also is a major cause of death in children under five.

2:18:44.420 --> 2:18:56.420
 And many of them not all would be saved by amoxicillin, which is just pennies. And for me, I took a path and I wanted to have a career in global health.

2:18:56.420 --> 2:19:01.420
 And I started traveling abroad to India and elsewhere when I was a medical student and continued doing that.

2:19:01.420 --> 2:19:12.420
 Paul Farmer was sort of one of the first to kind of open everyone's eyes, I think, about the good you can do with just money that we would change, you know, change that we would throw away.

2:19:12.420 --> 2:19:18.420
 Just, you know, put in a person, forget it or wherever we accumulate change these days. So that's very eye opening.

2:19:18.420 --> 2:19:27.420
 And while medical science advances, and that's good, you know, we shouldn't forget that 100 year old treatments could save lives in parts of the world where they're just not available.

2:19:27.420 --> 2:19:45.420
 People should definitely read mountains beyond mountains. Just for me, at least sort of a person from outside all of it, it was the first person to make me realize how difficult and the amount of humanity that's involved in being a doctor.

2:19:45.420 --> 2:19:54.420
 So it's not some kind of cold economics based argument about where to send treatments and so on. That is there too.

2:19:54.420 --> 2:20:01.420
 Like you said, basic treatments can help hundreds of thousands, millions of people in many parts of the world.

2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:19.420
 But it's also when you have a patient in front of you, there's some aspect of you that's willing to give a lot of your time, a lot of your money, a lot of your effort to saving them, even though it doesn't make any sense.

2:20:19.420 --> 2:20:30.420
 It's irrational in some sense, but it's also human. And that's the struggle of every doctor, like when you have to choose how to allocate your time, how to allocate your mental energy.

2:20:30.420 --> 2:20:43.420
 It's a tough choice that a doctor has to make and it's a human choice. It's not some kind of cold game theoretic choice. It's also a human choice and it can be irrational in some sense.

2:20:43.420 --> 2:20:49.420
 People are asking you for help. That's basically what every patient interaction is. Someone's asking you for help.

2:20:49.420 --> 2:21:04.420
 So your inclination is to help them and even if it means going above and beyond, a lot of factors affect how compassionate a doctor might be in any given day or point in their career, their own stress and burnout, etc.

2:21:04.420 --> 2:21:10.420
 But it's someone asking you for help and so you do what you can to help them.

2:21:10.420 --> 2:21:20.420
 You've done quite a lot of things in your life. It's been an interesting journey. Of course, there's a lot of story yet to be written.

2:21:20.420 --> 2:21:29.420
 But what advice would you give to young people today? In high school, maybe undergrad college starting out on that journey.

2:21:29.420 --> 2:21:38.420
 Maybe trying to pick majors, trying to pick jobs, careers, dreams and goals that can pursue.

2:21:38.420 --> 2:21:45.420
 What advice would you give them to have a career they can be proud of or to even have a life they can be proud of?

2:21:45.420 --> 2:21:52.420
 Well, I think having passion, which isn't always a voluntary thing. You just have it or you don't perhaps.

2:21:52.420 --> 2:21:59.420
 But becoming passionate about something and following it, wherever it takes you, I think is really important.

2:21:59.420 --> 2:22:08.420
 When I finished college and went to Russia for the first time, that was in some ways the beginning of my whole career and passions in my life.

2:22:08.420 --> 2:22:15.420
 I didn't know what I was going for, what was going to happen, what kind of career it would turn into, what kind of job would it help me get when I got back?

2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:20.420
 I wasn't thinking about anything of that. I'm very fortunate I got that opportunity.

2:22:20.420 --> 2:22:33.420
 I was very fortunate to be able to go and see those places and have my mind opened and I think that really just the fuel from that passion that was created during that time is still 20 years later going strong.

2:22:33.420 --> 2:22:44.420
 I'm partial to health care. I love being a doctor. I think it's the perfect combination of intellectual problem solving, being a detective while also working with your hands.

2:22:44.420 --> 2:22:55.420
 When you do procedures, especially in the ER, it's sort of the perfect combination. I'm not a surgeon, but I do use my hands quite a bit for a variety of reasons.

2:22:55.420 --> 2:23:03.420
 I always loved working with my hands. I loved crafts, especially prehistoric crafts, before medical school.

2:23:03.420 --> 2:23:14.420
 I just love problem solving, getting clues, figuring out what's going on, following your nose, using your instincts, your knowledge, and also just keen observation of the patient.

2:23:14.420 --> 2:23:24.420
 After seeing patient after patient, hundreds of patients, maybe thousands over years, you do get this innate sense, this gestalt about what might be going on.

2:23:24.420 --> 2:23:37.420
 It's not always a numbers thing. There's gestalt is actually a big part of medicine. You often in ERs or in hospitals, a nurse or doctor say something like, this patient just doesn't look good.

2:23:37.420 --> 2:23:45.420
 You can't point to a number, a value, a level in their blood, a test, but something about them.

2:23:45.420 --> 2:23:52.420
 A lot of that I think has to do with the color of their skin, believe it or not, which can change in certain disease states.

2:23:52.420 --> 2:24:06.420
 I think that medicine combines this observation, the skills, the knowledge, its art and science, its human and its robotic algorithmic at the same time.

2:24:06.420 --> 2:24:16.420
 I think it just combines all my passions all in one. If anyone's going into healthcare, I'd strongly encourage them to do so, but I'm very biased.

2:24:16.420 --> 2:24:32.420
 With that early passion, whatever that little flame was that brought you to Russia, were you able to vocalize it or was it just something like a gut that pulled you towards some exploration of the unknown or something like this?

2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:39.420
 I think it was a combination of things. One was just going to a different place that was different from where I grew up.

2:24:39.420 --> 2:24:51.420
 The suburbs, when you're in high school, you hate them. Later on, they don't seem so bad. I'm very fortunate how I was raised and never wanted for anything that wasn't rich.

2:24:51.420 --> 2:25:01.420
 Just to get out and see a different place, a different people with a different culture and history and language and literature and to see different climates and geographies and ecosystems.

2:25:01.420 --> 2:25:09.420
 I just wanted to see something different. I guess that's what I've sought after ever since. That was just so fascinating.

2:25:09.420 --> 2:25:17.420
 My trip to Kamchatka in 2003, where I was there for four months and I didn't speak English for, I think, two months out of it.

2:25:17.420 --> 2:25:24.420
 I remember lying on the floor, some wooden floor in a hunter's cabin in the middle of northern Kamchatka just being like,

2:25:24.420 --> 2:25:32.420
 what am I doing here? I was so grateful for the experiences I was having, what I was seeing and realizing and learning.

2:25:32.420 --> 2:25:37.420
 I was so grateful, even though I was lying on this hard uncomfortable floor. It's just like, this is so amazing.

2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:47.420
 I don't think I'll ever have another travel as meaningful and life changing as that particular trip to Kamchatka was, though I'm still striving after it.

2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:55.420
 You never replicate that first high, but you always try. I just think that seeing something different is kind of the game.

2:25:55.420 --> 2:26:07.420
 There wasn't really a plan. I got a chance to talk to the CEO of Qualcomm recently. His advice is, always have a plan.

2:26:07.420 --> 2:26:22.420
 It sounds like you're saying, don't have a plan. Don't need to have a plan. Just listen to your gut, your passion and follow that and see where that takes you because it's telling you something.

2:26:22.420 --> 2:26:31.420
 I guess the plan could be specific or could be as general as, I just want to go far away and see something very different. That's my plan.

2:26:31.420 --> 2:26:40.420
 That's one line. Just followed my nose from one thing to the next, just being interested, following my passion and, again, very fortunate I could do that.

2:26:40.420 --> 2:26:57.420
 Are there places in the world you're kind of thinking about that your life might take you at some point to be a doctor there for a time, to explore for a time that you haven't yet?

2:26:57.420 --> 2:27:04.420
 You know, I have some colleagues who do kind of global health work in various countries in Africa and Central and South America.

2:27:04.420 --> 2:27:16.420
 I would really love to go to some of those places, not just for a short trip, but hopefully for an extended period of time with sort of the health care being the ticket in,

2:27:16.420 --> 2:27:26.420
 but then maybe even bringing my children or just, you know, I guess at this point, some of the travel I dream about is sort of replicating what I did and showing it to my kids in a way.

2:27:26.420 --> 2:27:30.420
 But there's still a lot I haven't seen and would love to see as well.

2:27:30.420 --> 2:27:41.420
 But I think those opportunities sort of lend themselves well, you know, as a doctor with kind of the ability to go there and sort of help patients, but also teach medical students and residents.

2:27:41.420 --> 2:27:49.420
 Teaching is actually a huge part of being a doctor that's underappreciated, but that's actually part of the fun of being a doctor is that you're also a teacher.

2:27:49.420 --> 2:28:04.420
 Of course, the word doctor means teacher, but it's come to mean something else. But, you know, in some of my jobs, I'm working alongside medical students and residents and I'm giving them my knowledge, my wisdom, sharing with them stories.

2:28:04.420 --> 2:28:08.420
 And so that's a very satisfying part of the job.

2:28:08.420 --> 2:28:22.420
 If we could take a brief step into a dark place together for a time. Is there a, what is a dark place you've gone in your mind in your life?

2:28:22.420 --> 2:28:32.420
 What would be the darkest place you've ever gone for time, for a moment?

2:28:32.420 --> 2:28:36.420
 And how did you survive? How did you overcome it?

2:28:36.420 --> 2:28:49.420
 That's a very good question. I would say I haven't had as dark moments as many of the people who I care for in the emergency room.

2:28:49.420 --> 2:28:55.420
 I'm fortunate in that way. I've had a pretty, you know, enjoyable, satisfying life.

2:28:55.420 --> 2:29:00.420
 You know, I think everybody has dark moments, though, including me.

2:29:00.420 --> 2:29:08.420
 One of the most shocking things I feel like becoming an adult, my two big realizations have been, one, no one knows what they're doing.

2:29:08.420 --> 2:29:15.420
 And two, suicide is incredibly common, like in all humans and all societies. That I just find shocking.

2:29:15.420 --> 2:29:25.420
 I mean, I've never seriously contemplated myself, but I wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind during some more stressful times of life.

2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:32.420
 I think it crosses everyone's mind. And it sort of, as a kid, I found that I never would have guessed how common suicide is.

2:29:32.420 --> 2:29:42.420
 It's an important question to sort of the Camus question, like why live? Why? Why?

2:29:42.420 --> 2:29:50.420
 Because like life, especially when you're struggling, especially when life is shit, like why am I doing any of this?

2:29:50.420 --> 2:30:01.420
 And then on top of that chemistry of your brain, it could be as simple as diet and nutrition and aforementioned exercise and things like this

2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:13.420
 that affect the chemistry such that you're more predisposed to go to the places of asking the question why and maybe struggling to find a good answer.

2:30:13.420 --> 2:30:22.420
 Because it's actually a question with no good answer, except something in your chemistry says, well, I kind of like it.

2:30:22.420 --> 2:30:28.420
 But there's no good intellectual answer. And especially if day to day it's pain.

2:30:28.420 --> 2:30:37.420
 You get to see these stories of, you know, Robin Williams, these people that are on top of the world from an external perspective,

2:30:37.420 --> 2:30:44.420
 but from an internal perspective, it's struggle. Every day is pain.

2:30:44.420 --> 2:30:52.420
 It feels hopeless. And yeah, that's the question we all have to struggle with or learn how to ignore.

2:30:52.420 --> 2:30:58.420
 Maybe because if you ask the question too much, you're not going to find a good answer.

2:30:58.420 --> 2:31:05.420
 That's a choice you make. I personally think you should ask that question a lot.

2:31:05.420 --> 2:31:14.420
 But maybe because I have the luxury of the chemistry I have where I'm not in danger of seriously contemplating suicide.

2:31:14.420 --> 2:31:21.420
 But why live is an important question to answer constantly and struggle to answer that constantly.

2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:35.420
 I've been extremely fortunate to meet people over the past couple of years that are really struggling.

2:31:35.420 --> 2:31:44.420
 You have probably met people who are really struggling like orders of magnitude more people who are really struggling.

2:31:44.420 --> 2:31:54.420
 Some of it is psychological. A lot of it is biological. And man, life is a motherfucker. It's pretty tough.

2:31:54.420 --> 2:32:02.420
 Very true. I do think also past trauma plays a big role there like we talked about, you know, war wounds and PTSD.

2:32:02.420 --> 2:32:08.420
 And a lot of people grew up, I mean, with just horrific childhoods, they're abused in one way or another.

2:32:08.420 --> 2:32:16.420
 And I think a lot of people who have not, I'm not saying a majority, but a lot of people, for instance, who I see in the ER

2:32:16.420 --> 2:32:21.420
 coming in for threatening suicide or actually trying and failing and being brought to the ER.

2:32:21.420 --> 2:32:25.420
 You know, a lot of them just have really traumatic experiences.

2:32:25.420 --> 2:32:32.420
 You know, saw their parent commit suicide, were abused, you know, these leave scars in the human brain and mind.

2:32:32.420 --> 2:32:40.420
 And a lot of their subsequent lives of whether it's substance abuse, alcoholism, et cetera, is almost trying to escape from their own memories.

2:32:40.420 --> 2:32:50.420
 And it's sort of such this overwhelming battle sometimes, like sometimes people get ruined, it seems, and just can't be fixed.

2:32:50.420 --> 2:32:57.420
 You know what I mean? Yes, you can improve diet and health and your life choices and seek out your passion and exercise.

2:32:57.420 --> 2:33:03.420
 And those definitely will help. But sometimes just like, you know, you bear the scars of the past and there's no getting rid of them.

2:33:03.420 --> 2:33:09.420
 Yeah, I think it's possible to live with them through the struggle.

2:33:09.420 --> 2:33:11.420
 I would never say give up, you know.

2:33:11.420 --> 2:33:13.420
 Keep fighting.

2:33:13.420 --> 2:33:16.420
 It is a constant, it can be a constant battle for some people.

2:33:16.420 --> 2:33:24.420
 I know it can be, and I've talked to many of those folks, I know it can feel hopeless, but keep up the good fight.

2:33:24.420 --> 2:33:33.420
 Hopelessness is kind of one of the big suicide risk factors that you sort of ask about as a doctor, you know, do you feel hopeless?

2:33:33.420 --> 2:33:36.420
 And that sort of can be a harbinger.

2:33:36.420 --> 2:33:50.420
 I have quite a few dark moments, so if you're listening and you're struggling, we're in this together, brother and sister, keep up the good fight.

2:33:50.420 --> 2:33:54.420
 Life is a motherfucker, as you said. It's really harder.

2:33:54.420 --> 2:34:01.420
 I think as a kid, you know, in a joy free childhood, you don't realize like, obviously there's a ton you don't realize about life.

2:34:01.420 --> 2:34:06.420
 But then when you get to be an adult, you realize just how complex and hard it is.

2:34:06.420 --> 2:34:12.420
 Is it this hard for adult animals? I don't know. I don't think it is.

2:34:12.420 --> 2:34:18.420
 So I haven't seen the honesty of biology before you.

2:34:18.420 --> 2:34:22.420
 Do you think about your own death?

2:34:22.420 --> 2:34:29.420
 Do you contemplate death? Are you afraid of your own death? How do you make sense of it?

2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:35.420
 I've definitely thought about it, especially maybe while doing certain risky things.

2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:46.420
 Ice climbing and others where every time I look down, I thought about my own death, but I think, you know, I think having kids changes the equation for sure.

2:34:46.420 --> 2:34:58.420
 Should change the equation perhaps? So I think a lot of, now when I think about what will happen when I die, you know, there's a lot of worrying about what will happen to the people I care for.

2:34:58.420 --> 2:35:07.420
 You know, you think about things like insurance policy, life insurance and, you know, disability insurance, that's not related to death, but more just injuries.

2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:16.420
 That's part of the weight, I guess, that, you know, you feel as an adult that I think grows rapidly when you have kids.

2:35:16.420 --> 2:35:23.420
 Though not only, you know, there's other people you can care for, your own parents and loved ones, like a lot of people depend on individuals.

2:35:23.420 --> 2:35:27.420
 And so you think about what will happen to the other people when you die.

2:35:27.420 --> 2:35:37.420
 But also to push back that weight might be something you've convinced yourself to think about. It's an important way to think about.

2:35:37.420 --> 2:35:54.420
 But you focus on that weight to escape the other weight, which is, at one point, this consciousness just comes to an end and it's hard to make sense of that.

2:35:54.420 --> 2:36:00.420
 We kind of delude ourselves in thinking, okay, it just, yeah, it's ends. That's the natural way of things and so on that makes sense.

2:36:00.420 --> 2:36:12.420
 Okay, that's the way of life. But I don't think it's, like, cognitively easy to just realize how terrifying that is.

2:36:12.420 --> 2:36:24.420
 We love life so much that the end of it, it just, it's something that makes no sense.

2:36:24.420 --> 2:36:36.420
 And if you linger on that thought, I think it's a painful, it's a painful, I would say even terrifying thought, not scared of, like, in a way that's almost like philosophically terrifying.

2:36:36.420 --> 2:36:44.420
 Like, it just reminds you, maybe humbles you that you don't know anything about anything.

2:36:44.420 --> 2:36:56.420
 But one of the things we do as humans really well is we, especially with kids, you realize, okay, we start caring for others in the community and the family and so on and that distracts us.

2:36:56.420 --> 2:37:02.420
 Because then we can at least focus on other people's problems and not deal with our own.

2:37:02.420 --> 2:37:10.420
 When I was a medical student, I was particularly fascinated with kind of what actually happens as people die, like in the last minute, seconds of life.

2:37:10.420 --> 2:37:18.420
 It's sort of surprising sometimes, like, what actually kills people, you know, like, you can get a, let's say, a bad head injury and, you know, what kills you.

2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:31.420
 Sometimes it's just your consciousness decreases and you become kind of comatose, you aspirate your oxygen plummets and you get cardiac arrest, you know, that kind of sequence of events.

2:37:31.420 --> 2:37:38.420
 Or, you know, a heroin overdose, let's say you stop breathing, similarly, your oxygen goes down, then you get a cardiac arrest.

2:37:38.420 --> 2:37:43.420
 So I was really fascinated with what actually happens, what makes people die.

2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:47.420
 And it was sort of a morbid fascination, obviously, like most of med school is.

2:37:47.420 --> 2:37:59.420
 And I had many instances where I've had patients pass and as a medical student, I was sort of learning what's actually happening, watching it happen and, you know, not always being able to prevent it.

2:37:59.420 --> 2:38:02.420
 It was sort of a scientific exploration.

2:38:02.420 --> 2:38:05.420
 Then the patient's family comes in and are just devastated.

2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:12.420
 And then it's like, rips you out of this scientific perspective and you just realize how horrible death is.

2:38:12.420 --> 2:38:15.420
 But the person's fine, you know, it's the family, I guess.

2:38:15.420 --> 2:38:27.420
 And that's why it's always, I guess, that pointed out just how what people leave behind is often kind of the horribleness of death, like just becoming unconscious and staying that way doesn't seem, I guess, to me personally, so bad.

2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:32.420
 Sort of like going to sleep, not waking up, not counting the pain and stuff that precedes it.

2:38:32.420 --> 2:38:38.420
 So the actual pain, the actual suffering is often felt by the people who love the person who died.

2:38:38.420 --> 2:38:39.420
 Right.

2:38:39.420 --> 2:38:46.420
 So both financial pain, psychological pain for years, missing them, all those kinds of things.

2:38:46.420 --> 2:38:47.420
 Right.

2:38:47.420 --> 2:38:53.420
 Never forgetting the anniversary of their death, you know, just having flashbacks or something reminding you.

2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:57.420
 That sort of brought home to me sort of what death means.

2:38:57.420 --> 2:39:01.420
 And it was more about what people leave behind than what happens to them specifically.

2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:07.420
 See, I like those concerns because I feel like I can do a lot about those.

2:39:07.420 --> 2:39:08.420
 Those make sense to me.

2:39:08.420 --> 2:39:11.420
 Then just be, if you're a father, just be a good father.

2:39:11.420 --> 2:39:17.420
 If you're sort of, you mentioned sort of insurance, yeah, there's like financial stuff to take care of.

2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:28.420
 But I don't know what to do with is the philosophical existential crisis of the fact that this fricking thing ends.

2:39:28.420 --> 2:39:34.420
 It doesn't, like, I don't know how to deal with the mystery that's beyond death.

2:39:34.420 --> 2:39:36.420
 Why are we here?

2:39:36.420 --> 2:39:37.420
 Why are we born at all?

2:39:37.420 --> 2:39:39.420
 What is consciousness?

2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:40.420
 And you just look at yourself.

2:39:40.420 --> 2:39:41.420
 What is this?

2:39:41.420 --> 2:39:43.420
 Why do I have the capacity to suffer?

2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:48.420
 Why? Why? All these kinds of why questions that don't have answers.

2:39:48.420 --> 2:39:51.420
 Speaking of which, let me ask you a why question.

2:39:51.420 --> 2:39:53.420
 The biggest, ridiculous one.

2:39:53.420 --> 2:39:56.420
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:39:56.420 --> 2:40:03.420
 Having with this book studied the incredible, beautiful biology of life.

2:40:03.420 --> 2:40:09.420
 The components, the engineering components, they make up this human body.

2:40:09.420 --> 2:40:14.420
 But when you look at the entirety of it, what is why?

2:40:14.420 --> 2:40:16.420
 Why are we here?

2:40:16.420 --> 2:40:21.420
 Sometimes, probably more often than not, feel like the question of why is a trick of the human brain.

2:40:21.420 --> 2:40:25.420
 And outside of our thoughts, there is no why.

2:40:25.420 --> 2:40:28.420
 Why is not something that's in the universe?

2:40:28.420 --> 2:40:30.420
 It's just this trick happening inside our brain.

2:40:30.420 --> 2:40:36.420
 So why is a game that the human brain plays on itself?

2:40:36.420 --> 2:40:41.420
 And then the reality of life doesn't have whys.

2:40:41.420 --> 2:40:45.420
 I do wonder if asking why is sort of an evolutionary adaptation.

2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:49.420
 Like why, you know, maybe hunting, gathering.

2:40:49.420 --> 2:40:51.420
 Why does this plant grow there and not there?

2:40:51.420 --> 2:40:55.420
 Why do I see the same deer tracks and by the same tree every three days?

2:40:55.420 --> 2:40:57.420
 Why, you know, why is this?

2:40:57.420 --> 2:40:59.420
 Why is that?

2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:03.420
 Why does this plant make me vomit and that plant doesn't?

2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:08.420
 I guess those whys are very practical and oriented towards survival.

2:41:08.420 --> 2:41:15.420
 But then obviously, you know, we not only use whys, you know, we use it to maybe hunt better, gather better, survive better,

2:41:15.420 --> 2:41:22.420
 but then we sort of extrapolate it into these unanswerable questions, you know, about why.

2:41:22.420 --> 2:41:24.420
 Like why does life exist?

2:41:24.420 --> 2:41:30.420
 And it's possible that they're not unanswerable in the long arc of science and history.

2:41:30.420 --> 2:41:33.420
 We're just striving for the really difficult questions.

2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:36.420
 Right now, we just don't know much about anything.

2:41:36.420 --> 2:41:38.420
 And so we're striving.

2:41:38.420 --> 2:41:47.420
 But there's long, so most of human history, you were asking why questions for which we now have very precise answers,

2:41:47.420 --> 2:41:50.420
 including with biology and physics and all those kinds of things.

2:41:50.420 --> 2:41:57.420
 And maybe the whys, the cutting edge of science of the explorer of the curiosity of the human mind.

2:41:57.420 --> 2:42:03.420
 Like man's search for meaning is the sort of the ultimate driver of the whys.

2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:13.420
 And it's almost like it could be an evolutionary adaptation of asking exceptionally hard whys questions that will never get answered.

2:42:13.420 --> 2:42:18.420
 Like, so you should always have, like, it's like a cue.

2:42:18.420 --> 2:42:23.420
 It's a stack of questions, whys questions, and that thing should never come to the bottom.

2:42:23.420 --> 2:42:30.420
 You should always be striving, and that's useful for humans to come up with better and better ways of survival.

2:42:30.420 --> 2:42:36.420
 And maybe in a bigger perspective for the universe to figure out something about itself.

2:42:36.420 --> 2:42:39.420
 And it's just humans, just a useful tool for that.

2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:42.420
 Or life on Earth is a useful tool for that.

2:42:42.420 --> 2:42:49.420
 Well, John, for people who should know, you're from Philadelphia.

2:42:49.420 --> 2:42:50.420
 I'm from Philadelphia.

2:42:50.420 --> 2:42:56.420
 So it's an honor that you will travel all this way from a place I love to the new place I love.

2:42:56.420 --> 2:43:03.420
 And that you will write this really incredible book that celebrates the human body in the most honest of ways.

2:43:03.420 --> 2:43:08.420
 And thank you for everything you do, for being a great educator, for being a great doctor, for being a great person,

2:43:08.420 --> 2:43:11.420
 and for spending your really valuable time with me today.

2:43:11.420 --> 2:43:12.420
 Thank you, John.

2:43:12.420 --> 2:43:14.420
 Thanks for having me, Lex.

2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:17.420
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jonathan Reisman.

2:43:17.420 --> 2:43:21.420
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:43:21.420 --> 2:43:24.420
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Paul Farmer,

2:43:24.420 --> 2:43:32.420
 a doctor who has inspired both Jonathan and me with the way he practiced medicine and the way he lived his life.

2:43:32.420 --> 2:43:39.420
 The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that is wrong with the world.

2:43:39.420 --> 2:43:50.420
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
