00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
 The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.120
 He's the founder, co chairman,

00:05.120 --> 00:08.560
 and co chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates,

00:08.560 --> 00:09.840
 one of the world's largest

00:09.840 --> 00:11.920
 and most successful investment firms

00:11.920 --> 00:14.640
 that is famous for the principles of radical truth

00:14.640 --> 00:17.920
 and transparency that underlies culture.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.760
 Ray is one of the wealthiest people in the world

00:20.760 --> 00:22.520
 with ideas that extend far beyond

00:22.520 --> 00:24.920
 the specifics of how you made that wealth.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.400
 His ideas that are applicable to everyone

00:27.400 --> 00:30.680
 are brilliantly summarizing his book, Principles.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.760
 They're also even further condensed

00:32.760 --> 00:35.280
 on several of the platforms, including YouTube,

00:35.280 --> 00:38.600
 where, for example, the 30 minute video titled

00:38.600 --> 00:40.760
 How the Economic Machine Works

00:40.760 --> 00:43.440
 is one of the best educational videos

00:43.440 --> 00:46.560
 I personally have ever seen on YouTube.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.040
 Once again, you may have noticed

00:49.040 --> 00:50.600
 that the people I've been speaking with

00:50.600 --> 00:52.520
 are not just computer scientists,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.720
 but philosophers, mathematicians, writers, psychologists,

00:55.720 --> 00:59.560
 physicists, economists, investors, and soon much more.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.000
 To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.400
 bigger than computing.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.160
 It is our civilization's journey

01:06.160 --> 01:08.120
 into understanding the human mind

01:08.120 --> 01:10.840
 and creating echoes of it in the machine.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.960
 That journey includes the mechanisms of our economy,

01:13.960 --> 01:15.880
 of our politics, and the leaders

01:15.880 --> 01:18.080
 that shape the future of both.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.200
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.520
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:23.520 --> 01:25.600
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:25.600 --> 01:29.240
 support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.680
 Alex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.960
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:35.960 --> 01:38.480
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.200
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

01:41.200 --> 01:44.640
 but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.440
 Most Bitcoin exchanges take days

01:46.440 --> 01:48.680
 for a bank transfer to become investable.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.040
 Through Cash App, it takes seconds.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.360
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.120
 You can buy fractions of a stock,

01:56.120 --> 01:58.880
 which to me is a really interesting concept.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.120
 So you can buy $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.080
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:06.080 --> 02:09.840
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.680
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

02:11.680 --> 02:14.360
 to support one of my favorite organizations

02:14.360 --> 02:17.320
 that many of you may know and have benefited from,

02:17.320 --> 02:20.760
 called FIRST, best known for their FIRST robotics

02:20.760 --> 02:22.440
 and Lego competitions.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.120
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

02:26.120 --> 02:28.080
 in over 110 countries

02:28.080 --> 02:30.560
 and have a perfect rating on charity navigator,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.160
 which means the donated money is used

02:33.160 --> 02:35.520
 to maximum effectiveness.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.520
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

02:38.520 --> 02:41.000
 and use code LEX Podcast,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.760
 you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

02:44.760 --> 02:46.760
 which again is an organization

02:46.760 --> 02:49.560
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

02:49.560 --> 02:52.480
 to dream of engineering a better world.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.960
 And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.680
 Truth or more precisely,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.200
 an accurate understanding of reality

03:00.200 --> 03:03.360
 is the essential foundation of any good outcome.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.760
 I believe you've said that.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.640
 Let me ask an absurd sounding question

03:08.640 --> 03:10.880
 at the high philosophical level.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.800
 So what is truth?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.960
 When you're trying to do something different

03:14.960 --> 03:16.760
 than everybody else is doing

03:16.760 --> 03:19.800
 and perhaps something that has not been done before,

03:19.800 --> 03:23.480
 how do you accurately analyze the situation?

03:23.480 --> 03:25.480
 How do you accurately discover the truth,

03:25.480 --> 03:27.320
 the nature of things?

03:27.320 --> 03:30.320
 Almost the way you're asking the question implies

03:30.320 --> 03:35.320
 that truth and newness have nothing or almost at odds.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.360
 And I just want to say that I don't think

03:37.360 --> 03:39.040
 that that's true, right?

03:39.040 --> 03:42.640
 So what I mean by truth at truth is,

03:42.640 --> 03:43.600
 you know, what's the reality?

03:43.600 --> 03:45.480
 How does the reality work?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.800
 And so if you're doing something new

03:47.800 --> 03:49.080
 that has never been done before,

03:49.080 --> 03:51.320
 which is exciting and I like to do,

03:51.320 --> 03:54.000
 the way that you would start with that

03:54.000 --> 03:57.160
 is experimenting on what are the realities

03:57.160 --> 03:59.440
 and the premises that you're using on that

03:59.440 --> 04:01.880
 and how to stress test those types of things.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.000
 I think what you're talking about is instead the fact

04:05.000 --> 04:06.320
 of how do you deal with something

04:06.320 --> 04:08.040
 that's never been done before

04:08.040 --> 04:11.160
 and deal with the associated probabilities.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.320
 And so I think in that,

04:13.320 --> 04:15.720
 don't let something that's never been done before

04:15.720 --> 04:20.160
 stand in the way of you doing that particular thing.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.680
 You have a, because almost the only way

04:22.680 --> 04:27.240
 that you understand what truth is, is through experimentation.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.440
 And so when you go out and experiment,

04:29.440 --> 04:32.280
 you're going to learn a lot more about what truth is.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.800
 But the essence of what I'm saying is that

04:35.800 --> 04:38.000
 when you take a look at that,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.440
 use truth that find out what the realities are

04:40.440 --> 04:43.560
 as a foundation, do the independent thinking,

04:43.560 --> 04:47.120
 do the experimentation to find out what's true

04:47.120 --> 04:50.400
 and change and keep going after that.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.320
 So I think that when you're thinking about it

04:54.320 --> 04:56.040
 the way you're thinking about it,

04:56.040 --> 05:00.600
 that almost implies that you're letting people

05:00.600 --> 05:03.160
 almost say that they're reliant

05:03.160 --> 05:06.440
 on what's been discovered before to find out what's true.

05:06.440 --> 05:11.160
 And what's been discovered before is often not true, right?

05:11.160 --> 05:16.160
 Conventional view of what is true is very often wrong.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.760
 It'll go in ups and downs and, you know,

05:18.760 --> 05:20.880
 I mean, there are fads and okay, this thing,

05:20.880 --> 05:22.400
 it goes this way and that way.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.880
 And so definitions of truths that are conventional

05:25.880 --> 05:28.720
 are not the thing to go by.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.280
 How do you know the thing that has been done before

05:32.280 --> 05:33.880
 that it might succeed?

05:33.880 --> 05:37.880
 It's to do whatever homework that you have

05:37.880 --> 05:40.040
 in order to try to get a foundation.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.120
 And then to go into worlds of not knowing

05:43.120 --> 05:45.200
 and you go into the world of not knowing,

05:45.200 --> 05:48.920
 but not stupidly, not naively, you know,

05:48.920 --> 05:51.160
 you go into that world of not knowing

05:51.160 --> 05:53.200
 and then you do experimenting

05:53.200 --> 05:56.400
 and you learn what truth is and what's possible

05:56.400 --> 05:57.680
 through that process.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.960
 I describe it as a five step process.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.080
 The first step is you go after your goals.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.760
 The second step is you identify the problems

06:04.760 --> 06:07.160
 that stand in the way of you getting to your goals.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.320
 The third step is you diagnose those

06:09.320 --> 06:11.360
 to get at the root cause of those.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.760
 Then the fourth step is then now that you know

06:13.760 --> 06:17.880
 the exact root cause, you design a way to get around those

06:17.880 --> 06:21.080
 and then you follow through and do the designs

06:21.080 --> 06:23.880
 you set out to do and it's the experimentation.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.480
 I think that what happens to people mostly

06:27.480 --> 06:31.120
 is that they try to decide whether they're gonna be

06:31.120 --> 06:34.080
 successful or not ahead of doing it.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.200
 And they don't know how to do the process well

06:36.200 --> 06:38.880
 because the nature of your questions are along

06:38.880 --> 06:42.040
 those lines like how do you know or you don't know,

06:42.040 --> 06:45.000
 but a practical person who is also used

06:45.000 --> 06:48.840
 to making dreams happen knows how to do that process.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.600
 I've given personality tests to shapers.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.040
 So the person, what I mean by a shaper is a person

06:56.040 --> 07:00.320
 who can take something from visualization.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.000
 They have an audacious goal and then they go

07:03.000 --> 07:06.160
 from visualization to actualization, building it out.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.360
 That includes Elon Musk, I gave him the personality test.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.200
 I've given it to Bill Gates and then give it

07:12.200 --> 07:15.320
 to many, many such shapers.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.760
 And they know that process that I'm talking about.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.960
 They experience it, which is a process essentially

07:21.960 --> 07:24.440
 of knowing how to go from an audacious goal,

07:24.440 --> 07:27.840
 but not in a ridiculous way, not a dream.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.640
 And then to do that learning along the way

07:31.640 --> 07:34.400
 that allows them in a very practical way

07:34.400 --> 07:38.240
 to learn very rapidly as they're moving toward that goal.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.280
 So the call to adventure, the adventure starts

07:42.280 --> 07:44.720
 not trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation,

07:44.720 --> 07:48.160
 but using what instinct?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.440
 How do you dive in?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.280
 So let's talk about it.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.160
 It is being a, it's simultaneously

07:54.160 --> 07:55.880
 being a dreamer and a realist.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.680
 It's to know how to do that well.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.840
 The pull comes from a pull to adventure.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.160
 For whatever reason, I can't tell you how much

08:05.160 --> 08:07.720
 of its genetics and how much its environment,

08:07.720 --> 08:11.480
 but there's a early on, it's exciting.

08:11.480 --> 08:15.480
 That notion is exciting, being creative is exciting.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.200
 And so one feels that, then one gets in the habit

08:19.200 --> 08:21.480
 of doing that, okay, how do I know?

08:21.480 --> 08:23.560
 How do I learn very well?

08:23.560 --> 08:27.920
 And then how do I imagine and then how do I experiment

08:27.920 --> 08:30.880
 to go from that imagination?

08:30.880 --> 08:33.880
 So it's that process that one,

08:33.880 --> 08:36.200
 and then one, the more one does it,

08:36.200 --> 08:38.920
 the more the better one becomes that.

08:40.160 --> 08:44.200
 You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.960
 What, who are the shapers that you find yourself thinking

08:47.960 --> 08:51.160
 about when you're constructing these ideas?

08:51.160 --> 08:54.440
 Who ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you?

08:54.440 --> 08:57.440
 Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody

08:57.440 --> 09:01.120
 who comes up with a great visualization,

09:02.080 --> 09:04.720
 usually a really unique visualization

09:04.720 --> 09:08.240
 and then actually builds it out and makes the world

09:08.240 --> 09:10.800
 different, changes the world in that kind of a way.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.640
 So when I look at it, Mark Benioff with Salesforce,

09:14.640 --> 09:17.920
 Chris Anderson with Ted, Mohammed Yunus

09:17.920 --> 09:21.360
 with Social Enterprise in philanthropy, Jeffrey Canada

09:21.360 --> 09:23.520
 and Harlem Children's Zone,

09:23.520 --> 09:27.400
 there are all domains have shapers

09:27.400 --> 09:30.040
 who have the ability to visualize

09:30.040 --> 09:32.440
 and make extraordinary things happen.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.000
 What are the commonalities between some of them?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.960
 The commonalities are, first of all,

09:38.960 --> 09:43.280
 the excitement of something new, that quality of venture,

09:43.280 --> 09:47.640
 and then again, that practicality, the capacity to learn.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.760
 The capacity then, they're able to be

09:51.760 --> 09:53.640
 in many ways full rage.

09:53.640 --> 09:57.480
 That means they're able to go from the big, big picture

09:57.480 --> 09:59.320
 down to the detail.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.360
 So let's say, for example, Elon Musk,

10:02.360 --> 10:07.360
 he describes, he gets a lot of money from selling

10:07.360 --> 10:09.600
 PayPal as interest in PayPal.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.000
 He said, why isn't anybody going to Mars or outer space?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.120
 What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.200
 And how are we gonna get that?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.960
 And nobody's paying attention to that.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.680
 He doesn't know much about it.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.440
 He then reads and learns and so on.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.640
 Says I'm gonna take, okay, half of my money

10:27.640 --> 10:29.640
 and I'm gonna put it in there

10:29.640 --> 10:31.680
 and I'm gonna do this thing and he learns, blah, blah,

10:31.680 --> 10:33.440
 blah, blah, and he's got creative, okay.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.040
 That's one dimension.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.520
 So he gave me the keys to his car

10:39.520 --> 10:42.360
 with just early days in Tesla

10:42.360 --> 10:45.720
 and he then points out the details.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.120
 Okay, if you push this button here,

10:48.120 --> 10:49.760
 it's this, the detailed this.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.760
 So he's simultaneously talking about the big,

10:54.760 --> 10:56.040
 the big, big, big picture.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.960
 Okay, when does humanity going to abandon the planet?

10:59.960 --> 11:03.520
 But he will then be able to take it down into the detail

11:03.520 --> 11:06.320
 so he can go, let's call it helicoptering.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.880
 He can go up, he can go down

11:07.880 --> 11:09.840
 and see things at those types of perspectives.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.600
 And then you've seen that with the other shapers.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.160
 And that's a common thing that they can do that.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.480
 Another important difference that they have in mind

11:18.480 --> 11:21.160
 is how they deal with people.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.320
 I mean, meaning there's nothing more important

11:24.320 --> 11:26.200
 than achieving the mission.

11:26.200 --> 11:31.000
 And so what they have in common is that there's a test

11:31.000 --> 11:34.120
 that I give these personality tests

11:34.120 --> 11:36.440
 because they're very helpful for understanding people.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.760
 And so I gave it to all these shapers.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.320
 And one of the things in workplace inventory test

11:42.320 --> 11:44.880
 is this test, and it has a category called

11:44.880 --> 11:49.560
 Concern for Others, they're all having concern for others.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.240
 This includes Mohammed Yunus,

11:51.240 --> 11:54.720
 who invented microfinance, social enterprise,

11:54.720 --> 11:56.800
 impact investing as Mohammed Yunus,

11:56.800 --> 11:59.600
 received the Nobel Peace Prize for this,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.640
 the Congressional Medal of Honor,

12:01.640 --> 12:04.240
 one of the fortune determined,

12:04.240 --> 12:08.920
 one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs of our time.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.000
 He's built all sorts of businesses

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
 to give back money in social enterprise, a remarkable man.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.400
 He has nobody that I know practically

12:17.400 --> 12:20.280
 can have more concern for others.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.360
 He lives a life of a saint.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.160
 I mean, very modest lifestyle,

12:24.160 --> 12:27.280
 and he puts all his money into trying to help others.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.120
 And he tests low on what's called Concern for Others

12:30.120 --> 12:33.240
 because what it really, the questions under that

12:33.240 --> 12:36.840
 are questions about conflict to get at the mission.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.760
 So they all, Jeffrey Canada,

12:38.760 --> 12:41.600
 change Harlem children's zone and develop that

12:41.600 --> 12:44.120
 to take children in Harlem and get them well taken care of,

12:44.120 --> 12:47.000
 not only just in their education, but their whole lives.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.520
 Harlem, him also, Concern for Others.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.640
 What they mean is that they can see

12:53.640 --> 12:58.080
 whether those individuals are performing at a level,

12:58.080 --> 13:00.600
 that an extremely high level

13:00.600 --> 13:03.480
 that's necessary to make those dreams happen.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.600
 So when you think of, let's say Steve Jobs was famous

13:06.600 --> 13:09.840
 for being difficult with people and so on.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.160
 And I didn't know Steve Jobs,

13:11.160 --> 13:13.120
 so I can't speak personally to that.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.800
 But his comments on, do you have eight players?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.800
 And if you have eight players, if you put in B players,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.840
 pretty soon you'll have C players and so on.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.080
 That is a common element of them,

13:22.080 --> 13:24.000
 holding people to high standards

13:24.000 --> 13:28.320
 and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.120
 What do you think about that kind of idea?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.640
 Sorry to pause on that for a second,

13:31.640 --> 13:35.840
 that the A, B and C players

13:35.840 --> 13:39.400
 and the importance of, so when you have a mission

13:39.400 --> 13:41.120
 to really only have A players

13:41.120 --> 13:45.280
 and be sort of aggressively filtering for that.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.400
 Yes, but I think that there are all different ways

13:47.400 --> 13:49.640
 of being A players.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.200
 And I think, and what a great, great team,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.840
 you have to appreciate all the differences

13:55.840 --> 13:59.320
 in ways of being A players, okay?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.520
 That's the first thing.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.720
 And then you always have to be super excellent,

14:04.720 --> 14:07.440
 my opinion, you always have to be really excellent

14:07.440 --> 14:11.960
 with people to help them understand each other themselves

14:11.960 --> 14:15.960
 and get in sync with them about what's true about them

14:15.960 --> 14:18.120
 and their circumstances and how they're doing

14:18.120 --> 14:19.840
 so that they're having a fabulous

14:19.840 --> 14:22.160
 personal development experience

14:22.160 --> 14:24.480
 at the same time as you're dealing with them.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.760
 So when I say that they're all different ways,

14:27.760 --> 14:30.640
 this is one of the then qualities.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.520
 You asked me what are the qualities.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.520
 So one of the third qualities that I would say

14:35.520 --> 14:40.520
 is to know how to deal well with your not knowing

14:41.840 --> 14:46.480
 and to be able to get the best expertise

14:46.480 --> 14:50.400
 so that you're a great orchestrator of different ways

14:50.400 --> 14:53.880
 so that the people who are really, really successful,

14:53.880 --> 14:56.760
 unlike most people believe that they're successful

14:56.760 --> 15:01.640
 because of what they know, they're even more successful

15:01.640 --> 15:04.680
 by being able to effectively learn from others

15:04.680 --> 15:06.840
 and tap into the skills of people

15:06.840 --> 15:09.040
 who see things different from them.

15:09.040 --> 15:09.880
 Brilliant.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.480
 So how do you, when that that personality being,

15:12.480 --> 15:15.000
 first of all, open to the fact that there's

15:15.000 --> 15:18.240
 other people see things differently than you

15:18.240 --> 15:20.640
 and at the same time have supreme confidence

15:20.640 --> 15:22.360
 in your vision?

15:22.360 --> 15:24.960
 Is there just a psychology of that?

15:24.960 --> 15:27.320
 Do you see attention there between the confidence

15:27.320 --> 15:28.600
 and the open mindedness?

15:28.600 --> 15:31.240
 And now it's funny because I think we grow up

15:31.240 --> 15:33.240
 thinking that there's a tension there, right?

15:33.240 --> 15:37.080
 That there's a confidence and the more confidence

15:37.080 --> 15:40.560
 that you have, there's a tension with the open mindedness

15:40.560 --> 15:43.640
 and not being sure, okay?

15:43.640 --> 15:48.640
 Confident and accurate are almost negatively correlated

15:49.160 --> 15:50.120
 in many people.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.800
 They're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.360
 And so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people

15:57.360 --> 16:00.200
 is not realizing how those things to go together

16:00.200 --> 16:05.200
 because instead it's really that by saying I know a lot

16:05.600 --> 16:08.600
 and how do I know I'm still not wrong

16:08.600 --> 16:13.440
 and how do I take that the best thinking available to me

16:13.440 --> 16:16.640
 and then raise my probability of learning?

16:16.640 --> 16:19.560
 All these people think for themselves, okay?

16:19.560 --> 16:21.480
 I mean, meaning they're smart,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.960
 but they take in like vacuum cleaners.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.160
 They take in ideas of others.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.800
 They stress test their ideas with others.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.120
 They assess what comes back to them

16:31.120 --> 16:33.640
 in the form of other thinking

16:33.640 --> 16:36.400
 and they also know what they're not good at

16:36.400 --> 16:38.800
 and what other people who are good at the things

16:38.800 --> 16:39.800
 that they're not good at,

16:39.800 --> 16:41.520
 they know how to get those people

16:41.520 --> 16:43.600
 and be successful all around

16:43.600 --> 16:46.920
 because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.600
 And that I think is one of the great differences.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.400
 So the reason my company has been successful

16:53.400 --> 16:56.560
 in terms of this is because of an idea meritocratic decision

16:56.560 --> 17:00.880
 making a process by which you can get the best ideas.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.800
 You know, what's an idea meritocracy?

17:02.800 --> 17:05.840
 An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas

17:05.840 --> 17:07.080
 that are available out there

17:07.080 --> 17:09.800
 and to work together with other people in the team

17:09.800 --> 17:10.640
 to achieve that.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.000
 That's an incredible process

17:12.000 --> 17:13.720
 that you described in several places

17:13.720 --> 17:16.280
 to arrive at the truth.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.640
 Apologize if I'm romanticizing the notion,

17:18.640 --> 17:19.840
 blame me, linger on it.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.680
 Just having enough self belief.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.600
 You don't think there's a self delusion there

17:27.600 --> 17:30.040
 that's necessary, especially in the beginning

17:30.040 --> 17:31.800
 you talk about in the journey,

17:31.800 --> 17:34.640
 maybe the trials or the abyss.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.640
 Do you think there is value to deluding yourself?

17:41.560 --> 17:46.280
 I think what you're calling delusion is a bad word

17:46.280 --> 17:48.880
 for uncertainty, okay?

17:48.880 --> 17:50.720
 So I mean, in other words,

17:50.720 --> 17:52.800
 because we keep going back to the question,

17:52.800 --> 17:55.080
 how would you know and all of those things?

17:55.080 --> 17:58.640
 No, I think that delusion is not gonna help you

17:58.640 --> 18:01.480
 that you have to find out truth, okay?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.880
 To deal with uncertainty saying,

18:03.880 --> 18:05.360
 listen, I have this dream

18:05.360 --> 18:08.120
 and I don't know how I'm going to get that dream.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.160
 I mentioned in my book principles

18:10.160 --> 18:12.920
 and described the process in a more complete way

18:12.920 --> 18:15.080
 than we're gonna be able to go here.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.080
 But what happens is I say,

18:17.080 --> 18:19.800
 you form your dreams first

18:19.800 --> 18:23.200
 and you can't judge whether you're going to achieve

18:23.200 --> 18:26.920
 those dreams because you haven't learned

18:26.920 --> 18:28.720
 the things that you're going to learn

18:28.720 --> 18:31.440
 on the way toward those dreams, okay?

18:31.440 --> 18:35.680
 So that isn't delusion, I wouldn't use delusion.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.760
 I think you're overemphasizing the importance

18:38.760 --> 18:41.720
 of knowing whether you're just going to succeed or not.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.280
 Get rid of that, okay?

18:43.280 --> 18:46.120
 If you can get rid of that and say, okay,

18:46.120 --> 18:50.880
 no, I can have that dream, but I'm so realistic

18:50.880 --> 18:53.440
 in the notion of finding out, I'm curious,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.480
 I'm a great learner, I'm a great experimenter.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.800
 Along the way, you'll do those experiments

18:58.800 --> 19:00.880
 which will teach you more truths

19:00.880 --> 19:03.200
 and more learning about the reality

19:03.200 --> 19:05.000
 so that you can get your dreams

19:05.000 --> 19:08.440
 because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.400
 And you think delusion's helpful.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.520
 No, the delusion isn't, don't confuse delusion

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
 with not knowing.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.960
 Yes, but nevertheless, so if we look at the abyss,

19:18.960 --> 19:22.080
 we can look at your own that you describe,

19:22.080 --> 19:24.200
 it's difficult psychologically for people.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.480
 So many people quit, many people choose a path

19:27.480 --> 19:29.840
 that is more comfortable than, I mean,

19:29.840 --> 19:34.640
 that the heartbreak of that breaks people.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.440
 So if you have the dream and there's this cycle

19:37.440 --> 19:40.000
 of learning, setting a goal and so on,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.200
 what's your value for the psychology

19:42.200 --> 19:45.440
 of just being broken by these difficult moments?

19:45.440 --> 19:48.360
 Well, that's classically the defining moment.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.720
 It's almost like evolution taking care of,

19:51.720 --> 19:55.440
 okay, now you crash, you're in the abyss,

19:55.440 --> 19:56.960
 oh my God, that's bad.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.320
 And then the question is what do you do?

19:59.320 --> 20:01.280
 And it sorts people, okay?

20:01.280 --> 20:04.720
 And that's what, some people get off the field

20:04.720 --> 20:07.320
 and they say, oh, I don't like this and so on.

20:07.320 --> 20:12.160
 And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis

20:12.160 --> 20:15.560
 and it changes their approach to learning.

20:15.560 --> 20:19.480
 The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty.

20:19.480 --> 20:24.320
 You should take an audacious, dreamier guy

20:24.320 --> 20:28.680
 who wants to change the world, crash, okay.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.720
 And then come out of that crashing and saying,

20:31.720 --> 20:36.560
 okay, I can be audacious and scared

20:36.560 --> 20:39.640
 that I'm gonna be wrong at the same time.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.360
 And then how do I do that? Because that's the key.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.520
 When you don't lose your audaciousness

20:44.520 --> 20:46.880
 and you keep going after your big goal

20:46.880 --> 20:48.360
 and at the same time you say,

20:48.360 --> 20:50.600
 hey, I'm worried that I'm gonna be wrong,

20:50.600 --> 20:53.760
 you gain your radical open mindedness

20:53.760 --> 20:56.080
 that allows you to take in the things

20:56.080 --> 20:59.560
 that allows you to go to the next level of being successful.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.560
 So your own process, I mean, you've talked about it before

21:02.560 --> 21:05.240
 but it would be great if you can describe it

21:05.240 --> 21:07.960
 because our darkest moments are perhaps the most interesting.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.960
 So your own with the prediction of another depression.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.440
 Economic depression.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.120
 Yes, I apologize, economic depression.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.480
 Can you talk to what you were feeling, thinking,

21:22.320 --> 21:24.600
 planning, strategizing at those moments?

21:24.600 --> 21:28.840
 Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay.

21:28.840 --> 21:33.840
 Building my little company, this is in 1981, 82.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.680
 I had calculated that American banks

21:36.680 --> 21:40.040
 had given a lot more money to lend,

21:40.040 --> 21:42.120
 a lot more money to Latin American countries

21:42.120 --> 21:44.040
 than those countries were gonna pay back

21:44.040 --> 21:46.720
 and that they would have a debt crisis

21:46.720 --> 21:49.880
 and that this had sent the economy tumbling.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.520
 And that was an extremely controversial point of view.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.800
 Then it started to happen and it happened in Mexico default

21:56.800 --> 22:00.200
 that in August 1982, I thought that there was gonna be

22:00.200 --> 22:03.360
 an economic collapse that was gonna follow

22:03.360 --> 22:05.640
 because there was a series of the other countries,

22:05.640 --> 22:08.200
 it was just playing out as I had imagined

22:08.200 --> 22:11.040
 and that couldn't have been more wrong.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.120
 That was the exact bottom in the stock market

22:14.120 --> 22:17.480
 because central banks, he's monetary policy, blah, blah, blah

22:17.480 --> 22:19.160
 and I couldn't have been more wrong

22:19.160 --> 22:22.000
 and I was very publicly wrong and all of that

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
 and I lost money for me and I lost money for my clients

22:25.000 --> 22:27.920
 and I only had a small company then

22:27.920 --> 22:32.120
 but these were close people, I had to let them go.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.000
 I was down to me as the last person,

22:35.000 --> 22:39.920
 I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad

22:39.920 --> 22:43.080
 to help to pay for my family bills, very painful.

22:43.080 --> 22:47.520
 And at the same time, I would say it definitely was

22:48.520 --> 22:50.440
 one of the best things that ever happened to me,

22:50.440 --> 22:52.280
 maybe the best thing from happened to me

22:52.280 --> 22:55.040
 because it changed my approach to decision making.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.200
 It's what I'm saying, in other words,

22:57.200 --> 23:00.960
 I kept saying, okay, how do I know whether I'm right?

23:00.960 --> 23:02.800
 How do I know I'm not wrong?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.400
 It gave me that.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.440
 And it didn't give me my audaciousness

23:07.440 --> 23:10.640
 because I was in a position, what am I gonna do?

23:10.640 --> 23:13.200
 Am I gonna go down, back, put on a tie,

23:13.200 --> 23:16.480
 go to Wall Street and just do those things?

23:16.480 --> 23:19.560
 No, I can't bring myself to do that so I'm in a juncture.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.040
 How do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that?

23:22.040 --> 23:25.240
 And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties

23:25.240 --> 23:28.720
 and that taught me, for example, number of techniques.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.680
 First, to find the smartest people I could find

23:31.680 --> 23:35.160
 who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.360
 I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.640
 I learned how to produce diversification.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.720
 I learned how to do a number of things.

23:41.720 --> 23:46.040
 That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.400
 In other words, person by person, I hired them

23:48.400 --> 23:50.280
 and I wanted the smartest people

23:50.280 --> 23:51.720
 who would be independent thinkers

23:51.720 --> 23:54.960
 who would disagree with each other and me well

23:54.960 --> 23:57.520
 so that we could be independent thinkers

23:57.520 --> 24:00.160
 to go off to produce those audacious dreams

24:00.160 --> 24:02.480
 because you have to be an independent thinker to do that

24:02.480 --> 24:05.480
 and to do that not independently of the consensus,

24:05.480 --> 24:06.920
 independently of each other

24:06.920 --> 24:08.760
 and then work ourselves through that

24:08.760 --> 24:11.400
 because who know whether you're gonna have the right answer

24:11.400 --> 24:15.720
 and by doing that, then that was the key to our success.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.240
 And the things that I wanna pass along to people,

24:18.240 --> 24:20.840
 the reason I'm doing this podcast with you

24:20.840 --> 24:25.640
 is I'm 70 years old and that is a magical way

24:25.640 --> 24:28.000
 of achieving success.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.920
 If you can create an idea meritocracy,

24:30.920 --> 24:34.040
 it's so much better in terms of achieving success

24:34.040 --> 24:36.680
 and also quality relationships with people

24:36.680 --> 24:38.920
 but that's what that experience gave me.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.560
 So if we can linger on it a little bit longer,

24:41.560 --> 24:44.880
 the idea of an idea meritocracy, it's fascinating

24:44.880 --> 24:48.040
 but especially because it seems to be rare,

24:48.040 --> 24:50.920
 not just in companies but in society.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.040
 So there is a lot of people on Twitter

24:53.040 --> 24:55.760
 and public discourse and politics and so on

24:55.760 --> 24:58.240
 that are really stuck in certain sets of ideas,

24:58.240 --> 24:59.920
 whatever they are.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.400
 So when you're confronted with an idea

25:03.400 --> 25:08.400
 that's different than your own about a particular topic,

25:09.040 --> 25:12.680
 what kind of process do you go through mentally?

25:12.680 --> 25:16.040
 Are you arguing through the idea with a person?

25:16.040 --> 25:18.320
 Sort of present is almost like a debate

25:18.320 --> 25:21.240
 or do you sit on it and consider the world sort of

25:21.240 --> 25:26.240
 empathetically if this is true, then what does that world

25:26.840 --> 25:28.800
 look like, does that world make sense and so on?

25:28.800 --> 25:32.040
 So what's the process of considering those conflicting

25:32.040 --> 25:32.880
 ideas for you?

25:32.880 --> 25:35.200
 I'm gonna answer that question

25:35.200 --> 25:39.120
 but after saying first, almost implicit in your question

25:39.120 --> 25:42.400
 is it's not common, okay?

25:42.400 --> 25:47.040
 What's common produces only common results, okay?

25:47.040 --> 25:50.400
 So don't judge anything that is good based

25:50.400 --> 25:51.600
 on whether it's common,

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
 because it's only gonna give you common results.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.160
 If you want unique, you have a unique approach, okay?

25:57.160 --> 25:59.960
 And so that art of thoughtful disagreement

26:01.160 --> 26:05.120
 is the capacity to hold two things in your mind

26:05.120 --> 26:06.560
 at the same time.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.720
 The, gee, I think this makes sense

26:09.720 --> 26:13.360
 and then saying, I'm not sure it makes sense

26:13.360 --> 26:17.560
 and then try to say, why does it make sense?

26:17.560 --> 26:20.160
 And then to triangulate with others.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.440
 So if I'm having a discussion like that

26:22.440 --> 26:26.520
 and I work myself through and I'm not sure,

26:26.520 --> 26:29.200
 then I have to do that in a good way.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.960
 So I always give attention, for example,

26:31.960 --> 26:34.320
 let's start off, what does the other person know

26:34.320 --> 26:36.080
 relative to what I know?

26:36.080 --> 26:39.800
 So if a person has a higher expertise or things,

26:39.800 --> 26:42.200
 I'm much more inclined to ask questions.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.800
 I'm always asking questions.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.600
 If you wanna learn, you're asking questions,

26:46.600 --> 26:48.440
 you're not arguing, okay?

26:48.440 --> 26:51.840
 You're taking in, you're assessing when it comes into you.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.080
 Does that make sense or you're learning something?

26:54.080 --> 26:56.040
 Are you getting epiphanies and so on?

26:56.040 --> 26:57.520
 And I try to then do that.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.560
 If the conversation, as we're trying to decide

27:01.560 --> 27:04.560
 what is true and we're trying to do that together

27:04.560 --> 27:06.200
 and we see truth different,

27:06.200 --> 27:10.280
 then I might even call in another really smart,

27:10.280 --> 27:13.280
 capable person and try to say, what is true

27:13.280 --> 27:15.440
 and how do we explore that together

27:15.440 --> 27:17.640
 and you go through that same thing.

27:17.640 --> 27:22.600
 So I said, I describe it as having open mindedness

27:22.600 --> 27:25.000
 and assertiveness at the same time,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.600
 that you can simultaneously be open minded

27:28.600 --> 27:30.960
 and take in with that curiosity

27:30.960 --> 27:32.600
 and then also be assertive and say,

27:32.600 --> 27:33.840
 but that doesn't make sense.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.640
 Why would this be the case?

27:35.640 --> 27:37.480
 And you do that back and forth.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.520
 And when you're doing that kind of back and forth

27:41.520 --> 27:43.400
 on the topic like the economy,

27:43.400 --> 27:46.640
 which you have to me or have some naive,

27:46.640 --> 27:51.200
 but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex,

27:51.200 --> 27:54.680
 the economy, the trading, the transactions,

27:54.680 --> 27:57.720
 that these transactions between two individuals

27:57.720 --> 28:00.320
 somehow add up to this giant mechanism.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.680
 You've put out a 30 minute video.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.520
 You have a lot of incredible videos online

28:06.520 --> 28:10.080
 that people should definitely watch on YouTube,

28:10.080 --> 28:12.040
 but you've put out this 30 minute video titled

28:12.040 --> 28:14.640
 How the Economic Machine Works.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.400
 That is probably one of the best,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.440
 if not the best video I've seen on the internet

28:20.440 --> 28:22.440
 in terms of educational videos.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.280
 So people should definitely watch it,

28:24.280 --> 28:29.280
 especially because it's not that the individual components

28:29.320 --> 28:31.960
 of the video are somehow revolutionary,

28:31.960 --> 28:33.640
 but the simplicity and the clarity

28:33.640 --> 28:36.240
 of the different components just makes you,

28:36.240 --> 28:37.800
 there's a few light bulb moments there

28:37.800 --> 28:40.920
 about how the economy works as a machine.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.200
 So as you described, there's three main forces

28:43.200 --> 28:45.200
 that drive the economy, productivity growth,

28:45.200 --> 28:48.360
 short term debt cycle, long term debt cycle.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.320
 The former productivity growth is how valuable things,

28:53.200 --> 28:56.160
 how much value people create,

28:56.160 --> 28:57.400
 valuable things people create.

28:57.400 --> 29:02.080
 The latter is people borrowing from their future selves

29:02.080 --> 29:05.240
 to hopefully create those valuable things faster.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.440
 So this is an incredible system to me.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.960
 Maybe we can linger on it a little bit,

29:09.960 --> 29:14.160
 but you've also said what most people think about

29:14.160 --> 29:15.680
 as money is actually credit.

29:15.680 --> 29:20.560
 Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion.

29:20.560 --> 29:24.080
 Total amount of money is $3 trillion.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.000
 That's just crazy to me.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.520
 Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me,

29:28.520 --> 29:29.880
 but that seems crazy.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.440
 It gives me just pause that the human civilization

29:33.440 --> 29:37.080
 has been able to create a system that has so much credit.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.840
 So that's a long way to ask,

29:40.840 --> 29:45.000
 do you think credit is good or bad for society?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.120
 That system of that's so fundamentally based on credit.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.240
 I think credit is great,

29:51.240 --> 29:54.400
 even though people often overdo it.

29:54.400 --> 29:58.920
 The credit is that somebody has earned money.

29:58.920 --> 30:03.920
 And what happens is they lend it to somebody else

30:04.760 --> 30:06.960
 who's got better ideas and they cut a deal

30:06.960 --> 30:09.480
 and then that person with the better ideas

30:09.480 --> 30:10.520
 is gonna pay it back.

30:10.520 --> 30:14.560
 And if it works well, it helps resource allocations

30:14.560 --> 30:18.320
 go well, providing people like the entrepreneurs

30:18.320 --> 30:20.480
 and all of those, they need capital.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.160
 They don't have capital themselves.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.000
 And so somebody's gonna give them capital

30:24.000 --> 30:26.600
 and they'll give them credit along those lines.

30:26.600 --> 30:30.160
 Then what happens is it's not managed well

30:30.160 --> 30:31.840
 in a variety of ways.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.480
 So I did another book on principles,

30:34.480 --> 30:38.680
 principles of big debt crisis that go into that.

30:38.680 --> 30:43.680
 And it's free by the way, I put it free online as a PDF.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.080
 So if you go online and you look principles

30:47.080 --> 30:48.880
 for big debt crisis is under my name,

30:48.880 --> 30:50.640
 you can download it in a PDF

30:50.640 --> 30:52.880
 or you can buy a print book of it.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.760
 And it goes through that particular process.

30:55.760 --> 31:00.760
 And so you always have it overdone in always the same way.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.080
 Everything by the way,

31:03.080 --> 31:04.920
 almost everything happens over and over again

31:04.920 --> 31:07.040
 for the same reasons, okay?

31:07.040 --> 31:09.640
 So these debt crisis is all happened over and over again

31:09.640 --> 31:11.080
 for the same reasons.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.040
 They get it overdone in the book,

31:13.040 --> 31:16.080
 it explains how you identify whether it's overdone or not.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.240
 They get it overdone and then you go through the process

31:19.240 --> 31:21.560
 of making the adjustments according that.

31:21.560 --> 31:25.280
 And then it explains how they can use the levers and so on.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.200
 If you didn't have credit,

31:27.200 --> 31:30.800
 then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck.

31:30.800 --> 31:35.320
 So credit is a good thing,

31:35.320 --> 31:37.160
 but it can easily be overdone.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.760
 So now we get into the, what is money?

31:39.760 --> 31:41.000
 What is credit?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.240
 Okay, you get into money and credit.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.680
 So if you're holding credit

31:44.680 --> 31:46.520
 and you think that's worthwhile,

31:46.520 --> 31:48.760
 keep in mind that the central bank,

31:48.760 --> 31:50.480
 let's say it can print the money.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.960
 What is that problem?

31:51.960 --> 31:55.600
 You have an IOU and the IOU says you're gonna get

31:55.600 --> 31:58.000
 a certain number of dollars, let's say,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.200
 or yen or euros.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.600
 And that is what the IOU is.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.800
 And so the question is, will you get that money

32:05.800 --> 32:07.800
 and what will it be worth?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.480
 And then also you have a government

32:10.480 --> 32:13.000
 which is a participant in that process.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.360
 Because they are on the hook, they owe money,

32:16.360 --> 32:18.520
 and then will they print the money

32:18.520 --> 32:20.920
 to make it easy for everybody to pay

32:20.920 --> 32:23.120
 so you have to pay attention to those two?

32:23.120 --> 32:26.360
 I would suggest like you recommend to other people,

32:26.360 --> 32:28.920
 just take that 30 minutes

32:28.920 --> 32:31.560
 and it comes across pretty clearly.

32:31.560 --> 32:35.160
 But my conclusion is that of course you want it.

32:35.160 --> 32:39.880
 And even if you understand it and the cycles well,

32:39.880 --> 32:42.200
 you can benefit from those cycles

32:42.200 --> 32:45.360
 rather than to be hurt by those cycles.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.600
 Because I don't know, the way the cycle works

32:48.600 --> 32:50.400
 is somebody gets over indebted,

32:50.400 --> 32:52.280
 they have to sell an asset.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.680
 Okay, then I don't know, that's when assets become cheaper.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.360
 How do you acquire the asset?

32:57.360 --> 32:59.240
 It's a whole process.

32:59.240 --> 33:03.800
 So again, maybe another dumb question, but...

33:03.800 --> 33:06.000
 There are no such things as dumb questions.

33:06.000 --> 33:06.840
 There you go.

33:06.840 --> 33:07.920
 But what is money?

33:09.400 --> 33:12.560
 So you've mentioned credit and money.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.440
 It's another thing that if I just zoom out

33:16.440 --> 33:17.960
 from an alien perspective

33:17.960 --> 33:19.400
 and look at human civilization,

33:19.400 --> 33:22.720
 it's incredible that we've created a thing

33:22.720 --> 33:27.360
 that only works because currency,

33:27.360 --> 33:30.440
 because we all agree it has value.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.360
 So I guess my question is,

33:34.360 --> 33:38.960
 how do you think about money as this emergent phenomenon?

33:38.960 --> 33:41.720
 And what do you think is the future of money?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.480
 You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms.

33:44.480 --> 33:48.600
 What do you think is its history and future?

33:48.600 --> 33:51.320
 How do you think about money?

33:51.320 --> 33:55.080
 There are two things that money is for.

33:55.080 --> 34:00.080
 It's a medium of exchange, and it's a storehold of wealth.

34:00.080 --> 34:04.320
 That's some money, so you could say,

34:04.320 --> 34:06.760
 something's a medium of exchange,

34:06.760 --> 34:09.280
 and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?

34:11.440 --> 34:16.440
 And money is that vehicle that is those things

34:16.920 --> 34:20.800
 and can be used to pay off your debt.

34:20.800 --> 34:25.000
 So when you have a debt and you provide it,

34:25.000 --> 34:26.840
 it pays off your debt.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.720
 So that's that process.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.200
 And it's, I apologize to interrupt,

34:31.200 --> 34:35.080
 but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth

34:35.080 --> 34:37.680
 when everybody recognizes it to be of value.

34:37.680 --> 34:38.520
 That's right.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.400
 And so you see in the history around the world

34:41.400 --> 34:43.280
 and you go to places,

34:43.280 --> 34:47.320
 I was in an island in the Pacific

34:47.320 --> 34:52.320
 in which they had as money these big stones.

34:53.640 --> 34:56.760
 And literally, they were taking a boat,

34:56.760 --> 34:59.360
 this big carved stone,

34:59.360 --> 35:00.960
 and they were taking it from one of the islands

35:00.960 --> 35:02.840
 to the other, and it sank.

35:02.840 --> 35:07.840
 The piece of this big stone, piece of money that they had,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.120
 and it went to the bottom,

35:10.120 --> 35:13.560
 and they still perceived it as having value

35:13.560 --> 35:15.960
 so that it was, even though it was in the bottom,

35:15.960 --> 35:17.840
 and it's this big hunk of rock,

35:17.840 --> 35:19.280
 the fact that somebody owned it,

35:19.280 --> 35:21.920
 they would say, oh, I'll own it for this and that.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.480
 I've seen beads in different places,

35:25.480 --> 35:28.840
 shells converted to this and mediums of exchange.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
 And when we look at what we've got,

35:30.840 --> 35:32.440
 you're exactly right.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.080
 It is the notion that if I give it to you,

35:35.080 --> 35:37.880
 I can then take it and I can buy something with it.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.680
 And that's, so it's a matter of perception.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.520
 Okay.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.960
 And then we go through then the history of money

35:44.960 --> 35:47.480
 and the vulnerabilities of money.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.760
 And what we have is through history,

35:50.760 --> 35:52.800
 there's been two types of money,

35:52.800 --> 35:57.800
 those that are claims on something of value,

35:58.120 --> 36:01.560
 like the connection of to gold or something.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.400
 That's right.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.600
 That would be, and or they just are money

36:05.600 --> 36:07.400
 without any connection,

36:07.400 --> 36:08.760
 and then we have a system now,

36:08.760 --> 36:10.880
 which is a fiat monetary system.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.600
 So that's what money is.

36:12.600 --> 36:17.600
 Then it will last as long as it's kept of value

36:17.760 --> 36:19.040
 and it works that way.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.000
 So let's say central banks,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.160
 when they get in the position of like,

36:24.160 --> 36:26.160
 they owe a lot of money,

36:26.160 --> 36:29.720
 like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case,

36:29.720 --> 36:33.600
 and they also are a bind and they have the printing press

36:33.600 --> 36:36.600
 to print the money and get out of that.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.400
 And you have a lot of people might be in that position.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.360
 Then you can print it and then it could be devalued

36:42.360 --> 36:45.400
 in there, and so history has shown,

36:45.400 --> 36:48.120
 forget about today, history has shown

36:48.120 --> 36:52.120
 that no currency has,

36:52.120 --> 36:56.360
 every currency has either ended as being a currency

36:56.360 --> 36:59.880
 or devalued as a currency over periods of time,

36:59.880 --> 37:01.360
 long periods of time.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.520
 So it evolves and it changes,

37:03.520 --> 37:06.280
 but everybody needs that medium of exchange

37:06.280 --> 37:08.760
 and everybody needs that storehold of wealth,

37:08.760 --> 37:12.360
 so it keeps changing what is money over a period of time.

37:12.360 --> 37:16.800
 But so much is being digitized today.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.360
 And there's these ideas that are based

37:19.360 --> 37:22.600
 on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on.

37:22.600 --> 37:27.640
 So if all currencies, like all empires, come to an end,

37:27.640 --> 37:29.160
 what do you think will,

37:29.160 --> 37:31.640
 do you think something like Bitcoin might emerge

37:31.640 --> 37:34.720
 as a common store of value,

37:34.720 --> 37:37.840
 store of wealth and a medium of exchange?

37:37.840 --> 37:40.560
 The problem with Bitcoin is

37:40.560 --> 37:44.920
 that it's not an effective medium of exchange,

37:44.920 --> 37:47.440
 like it's not easy for me to go in there

37:47.440 --> 37:49.080
 and buy things with it.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.040
 And then it's not an effective storehold of value

37:52.040 --> 37:55.040
 because it has a volatility that's based

37:55.040 --> 37:56.640
 on speculation and the like.

37:56.640 --> 38:00.000
 So it's not a very effective saving.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.480
 That's very different from Facebook's

38:03.480 --> 38:05.600
 of a stable value currency,

38:05.600 --> 38:09.080
 which would be effective as both a medium of exchange

38:09.080 --> 38:11.120
 and a storehold of wealth,

38:11.120 --> 38:12.840
 because if you were to hold it

38:12.840 --> 38:14.760
 and the way it's linked to,

38:14.760 --> 38:16.880
 number of things that it's linked to,

38:16.880 --> 38:19.320
 would mean that it could be a very effective

38:19.320 --> 38:20.760
 storehold of wealth.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.480
 Then you have a digital currency

38:22.480 --> 38:24.960
 that could be a very effective medium exchange

38:24.960 --> 38:26.760
 and storehold of wealth.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.440
 So in my opinion,

38:28.440 --> 38:32.760
 some digital currencies are likely to succeed more or less

38:32.760 --> 38:35.040
 based on that ability to do it.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.960
 Then the question is what happens?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.600
 Okay, what happens is,

38:39.600 --> 38:42.640
 do central banks allow that to happen?

38:42.640 --> 38:44.840
 I really do believe it's possible

38:44.840 --> 38:47.080
 to get a better form of money

38:47.080 --> 38:50.480
 that central banks don't control, okay?

38:50.480 --> 38:54.560
 A better force of money that central banks don't control.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.840
 But then that's not yet happened.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.680
 And we also have to,

38:59.680 --> 39:03.440
 and so they've got to go through that evolutionary process.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.720
 In order to go through that evolutionary process,

39:05.720 --> 39:09.120
 first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen,

39:09.120 --> 39:11.520
 which is to some extent a threat to them

39:11.520 --> 39:13.120
 in terms of their power,

39:13.120 --> 39:14.640
 and that's an issue.

39:14.640 --> 39:17.560
 And then you have to also build the confidence

39:17.560 --> 39:21.440
 in all of the components of it to say,

39:21.440 --> 39:23.600
 okay, that's going to be effective

39:23.600 --> 39:28.600
 because I won't have problems owning it.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.960
 So I think that digital currencies

39:30.960 --> 39:35.200
 have some element of potential,

39:35.200 --> 39:37.720
 but there's a lot of hurdles

39:37.720 --> 39:39.880
 that are going to have to be gotten over.

39:39.880 --> 39:43.960
 I think that it'll be a very long time, possibly never,

39:43.960 --> 39:47.520
 but anyway, a very long time before we have that,

39:47.520 --> 39:49.000
 let's say, get into a position

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
 that would be in an effective means relative to gold,

39:54.440 --> 39:56.320
 let's say, if you were to think of that,

39:56.320 --> 40:00.720
 because gold is a track record of thousands of years.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.320
 In a union of all across countries,

40:03.320 --> 40:04.800
 it has its mobility,

40:04.800 --> 40:06.480
 it has the ability to put it down,

40:06.480 --> 40:07.520
 it has certain abilities,

40:07.520 --> 40:12.120
 it's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies,

40:12.120 --> 40:14.040
 but central banks will hold it,

40:14.040 --> 40:18.400
 like there's central banks that worry about others,

40:18.400 --> 40:20.560
 other country central banks might worry about

40:20.560 --> 40:23.040
 whether the US dollar is going to print to not that.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.840
 And so the thing they're going to go to

40:24.840 --> 40:26.960
 is not going to be the digital currency,

40:26.960 --> 40:30.760
 the thing they're going to go to is gold or something else,

40:30.760 --> 40:32.800
 some other currency, they got to pick it.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.400
 And so I think it's a long way to go.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.240
 But you think it's possible that one day

40:37.240 --> 40:39.160
 we don't even have a central bank

40:39.160 --> 40:44.160
 because of a currency that cannot be controlled

40:44.760 --> 40:47.960
 by the central bank is the primary currency?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.840
 Or does that seem very unlikely?

40:50.840 --> 40:55.840
 It would be very remote possibility

40:57.920 --> 41:00.400
 or very long in the future.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.440
 Got it.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.200
 Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.040
 When you sit back and you look,

41:06.040 --> 41:09.840
 you describe these transactions between individuals,

41:09.840 --> 41:13.920
 somehow creating short term debt cycles,

41:13.920 --> 41:17.480
 long term debt cycles as productivity growth.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.680
 Does it amaze you that this whole thing works?

41:22.800 --> 41:25.280
 That there's however many million,

41:25.280 --> 41:27.800
 hundreds of millions of people in the United States,

41:27.800 --> 41:30.200
 globally over 7 billion people,

41:30.200 --> 41:33.080
 that this thing between individual transactions,

41:34.200 --> 41:36.160
 it just, it works.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.080
 Yeah.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.480
 It amazes me.

41:38.480 --> 41:43.360
 Like I go back and forth between being in it.

41:43.360 --> 41:48.000
 And then I think like, how did a credit card,

41:48.000 --> 41:49.600
 how does that really possible?

41:49.600 --> 41:51.480
 I'm still used to my look of credit card.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.920
 I put it on, the guy doesn't know me.

41:53.920 --> 41:54.760
 Yeah.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.600
 It's all strangers.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.640
 It signs, okay, we're making the digital entries.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.080
 Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?

42:01.080 --> 42:04.280
 And then it goes back and it goes this and it clears

42:04.280 --> 42:05.520
 and it all happens.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.680
 And what I marvel at that and those types of things

42:09.680 --> 42:14.240
 is because of the capacity of the human mind

42:14.240 --> 42:19.040
 to create abstractions that are true.

42:19.040 --> 42:23.400
 It's imagination and then the ability to go from one level

42:23.400 --> 42:25.680
 and then if these things are true,

42:25.680 --> 42:27.120
 then you go to the next level.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.880
 And if those things are true,

42:28.880 --> 42:30.200
 then you go to the next level.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.720
 And all those miracles that we almost become common,

42:33.720 --> 42:36.440
 it's like when I'm flying in a plane

42:36.440 --> 42:39.520
 or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen,

42:39.520 --> 42:42.600
 when I get communications in the middle of,

42:42.600 --> 42:45.080
 I don't know, Africa or Antarctica

42:45.080 --> 42:48.720
 and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face

42:48.720 --> 42:52.560
 on my iPad of somebody, my grand kid in some place else

42:52.560 --> 42:57.560
 and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me.

42:58.120 --> 43:01.640
 So while being amazing, do you have a sense,

43:01.640 --> 43:03.600
 the principle you described that the whole thing

43:03.600 --> 43:08.440
 is stable somehow also or is this, are we just lucky?

43:08.440 --> 43:11.640
 So the principles that you described,

43:11.640 --> 43:16.640
 are those describing a system that's stable, robust

43:16.760 --> 43:20.840
 and will remain so or is it a lucky accident

43:20.840 --> 43:22.960
 of our early history?

43:22.960 --> 43:26.040
 My area of expertise is economics and markets.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.880
 So I get down to like a real nitty gritty.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.920
 I can't tell you whether the plane is gonna fall

43:30.920 --> 43:35.000
 out of the sky because of its particular fundamentals.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.400
 I don't know enough about that,

43:36.400 --> 43:38.000
 but it happens over and over again.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.760
 And so when it gives me faith, okay?

43:39.760 --> 43:41.280
 So without me knowing it.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.760
 In the markets and the economy,

43:43.760 --> 43:48.440
 I know those things well enough in a sense to say

43:48.440 --> 43:53.440
 that by and large, that structure is right,

43:53.600 --> 43:55.080
 what we're seeing is right.

43:55.080 --> 43:59.960
 Now, whether there are disruptions and it has effects

43:59.960 --> 44:03.160
 that can come not because that structure is right,

44:03.160 --> 44:07.560
 I believe it's right, but whether it can be hurt by,

44:07.560 --> 44:11.160
 let's say connectivity or journal entries.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.480
 They could take all the money away from you

44:13.480 --> 44:15.320
 through your digital entries.

44:15.320 --> 44:19.080
 There's all sorts of things that can happen in various ways.

44:19.080 --> 44:21.960
 That means that that money is worthless

44:21.960 --> 44:24.760
 or the system falls, but from what I see

44:24.760 --> 44:28.400
 in terms of its basic structure and those complexities

44:28.400 --> 44:30.160
 that still take my breath away,

44:30.160 --> 44:33.560
 I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them,

44:33.560 --> 44:34.840
 that doesn't worry me.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.000
 Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime

44:37.000 --> 44:38.280
 that really surprised you?

44:38.280 --> 44:39.120
 Major destruction.

44:39.120 --> 44:39.960
 All the time.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.960
 This is one of the great lessons of my life is that

44:44.640 --> 44:49.640
 many times I've seen things that I was very surprised about

44:50.440 --> 44:55.440
 and that I realized almost all of those I was surprised

44:55.760 --> 44:59.800
 about because they were just the first time it happened

44:59.800 --> 45:02.600
 to me, they didn't happen in my lifetime before.

45:02.600 --> 45:06.360
 But when I researched them, they happened in other places

45:06.360 --> 45:08.200
 or other people lifetimes.

45:08.200 --> 45:13.200
 So for example, I remember in 1971, the dollar,

45:13.480 --> 45:16.680
 there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency.

45:16.680 --> 45:18.480
 It didn't experience it.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.280
 And with the dollar was connected to gold

45:21.280 --> 45:24.000
 and I was watching events happen and then you get on

45:24.000 --> 45:26.480
 and that definition of money,

45:26.480 --> 45:29.000
 all of a sudden went out the window

45:29.000 --> 45:31.320
 because it was not tied to gold

45:31.320 --> 45:33.720
 and then you have this devaluation.

45:33.720 --> 45:37.080
 And so, and then, or the first oil shock

45:37.080 --> 45:41.280
 or the second oil shock or so many of these things.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.320
 And when I, but almost always,

45:44.320 --> 45:48.360
 I realized that they, when I looked in history,

45:48.360 --> 45:50.080
 they happened before.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.000
 They just happened in other people's lifetimes,

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
 which led me to realize that I needed to study history

45:58.280 --> 46:00.880
 and what happened in other people's lifetimes

46:00.880 --> 46:04.120
 and what happened in other countries and places

46:04.120 --> 46:07.760
 so that I would have timeless and universal principles

46:07.760 --> 46:09.320
 for dealing with that thing.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.960
 So I, oh yeah, I've been, you know,

46:11.960 --> 46:13.880
 the implausible happening,

46:13.880 --> 46:17.640
 but it's like a one in a hundred year storm.

46:17.640 --> 46:18.480
 Right.

46:18.480 --> 46:19.320
 Okay.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.000
 Or it's, or...

46:21.000 --> 46:22.160
 They've happened before.

46:22.160 --> 46:23.120
 Yeah, they've happened.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.400
 Just not to you.

46:24.400 --> 46:28.160
 Let me talk about, if we could, about AI a little bit.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.880
 So we've, Bridgewater Associates manage

46:32.880 --> 46:36.640
 about $160 billion in assets.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.200
 And our artificial intelligence systems algorithms

46:41.200 --> 46:43.640
 are pretty good with data.

46:43.640 --> 46:48.640
 What role in the future do you see AI play in analysis

46:48.840 --> 46:52.240
 and decision making in this kind of data rich

46:52.240 --> 46:56.280
 and impactful area of investment?

46:56.280 --> 46:59.080
 I'm going to answer that, not only in investment,

46:59.080 --> 47:04.080
 but I give a more all encompassing rule for AI.

47:05.440 --> 47:10.360
 As I think you know, for the last 25 years,

47:10.360 --> 47:14.840
 we have taken our thinking and put them in algorithms.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.840
 And so we make decisions.

47:16.840 --> 47:21.320
 The computer takes those criteria, algorithms,

47:21.320 --> 47:24.160
 and they put them, and they're in there and it takes data

47:24.160 --> 47:29.160
 and they operate as an independent decision maker,

47:29.480 --> 47:31.640
 in parallel with our decision making.

47:31.640 --> 47:35.440
 So for me, it's like, there's a chess game playing,

47:35.440 --> 47:38.440
 and I'm a person with my chess game,

47:38.440 --> 47:39.920
 and I'm saying it made that move,

47:39.920 --> 47:40.960
 and I'm making the move,

47:40.960 --> 47:42.760
 and how do I compare those two moves?

47:42.760 --> 47:45.960
 So we've done a lot, but let me give you a rule.

47:45.960 --> 47:50.000
 If the future can be different from the past,

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
 and you don't have deep understanding,

47:56.880 --> 48:01.160
 you should not rely on AI, okay?

48:02.120 --> 48:03.240
 Those two things.

48:03.240 --> 48:07.120
 Deep understanding of the cause of fact relationships

48:07.120 --> 48:11.080
 that are leading you to place that bet in anything, okay?

48:11.080 --> 48:12.960
 Anything important.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.000
 Let's say if it was do surgeries,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.440
 and you would say, how do I do surgeries?

48:17.440 --> 48:20.800
 I think it's totally fine to watch all the doctors

48:20.800 --> 48:21.640
 do the surgeries.

48:21.640 --> 48:26.640
 You can put it on, take a digital camera,

48:27.040 --> 48:31.120
 and do that, convert that into AI algorithms

48:31.120 --> 48:34.960
 that go to robots and have them do surgeries,

48:34.960 --> 48:36.720
 and I'd be comfortable with that.

48:36.720 --> 48:40.920
 Because if it keeps doing the same thing over and over again,

48:40.920 --> 48:43.960
 and you have enough of that, that would be fine,

48:43.960 --> 48:46.680
 even though you may not understand the algorithms,

48:46.680 --> 48:49.400
 because if the thing's happening over and over again,

48:49.400 --> 48:52.000
 and you're not asking, the future would be the same,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.200
 that appendicitis or whatever it is,

48:54.200 --> 48:57.600
 will be handled the same way the surgery, that's fine.

48:57.600 --> 49:02.600
 However, what happens with AI is for the most part,

49:02.960 --> 49:05.560
 is it takes a lot of data,

49:05.560 --> 49:09.560
 and with a high enough sample size,

49:09.560 --> 49:13.200
 and then it puts together its own algorithms.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.160
 Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms.

49:16.160 --> 49:18.320
 You can either take your thinking

49:18.320 --> 49:20.600
 and express them in algorithms,

49:20.600 --> 49:25.600
 or you can put the data in and say, what is the algorithm?

49:26.200 --> 49:27.880
 That's machine learning.

49:27.880 --> 49:30.560
 And when you have machine learning,

49:30.560 --> 49:32.040
 it'll give you equations,

49:32.040 --> 49:35.120
 which quite often are not understandable.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.400
 If you would try to say, okay,

49:36.400 --> 49:38.360
 now describe what it's telling you,

49:38.360 --> 49:40.120
 it's very difficult to describe,

49:40.120 --> 49:42.920
 and so they can escape understanding.

49:42.920 --> 49:46.240
 And so it's very good for doing those things

49:46.240 --> 49:47.920
 that could be done over and over again

49:47.920 --> 49:49.920
 if you're watching and you're not taking that.

49:49.920 --> 49:53.040
 But if the future is different from the past,

49:53.040 --> 49:56.240
 and you have that, then the future is different

49:56.240 --> 49:59.040
 from the past, and you don't have deep understanding,

49:59.040 --> 50:00.680
 you're gonna get in trouble.

50:00.680 --> 50:03.120
 And so that's the main thing.

50:03.120 --> 50:05.320
 As far as AI is concerned,

50:05.320 --> 50:09.040
 AI, and let's say computer replications of thinking

50:09.040 --> 50:11.480
 in very ways, I think it's particularly good

50:11.480 --> 50:16.480
 for processing, but the notion of what you want to do

50:18.240 --> 50:23.240
 is better most of the time determined by the human mind.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.440
 What are the principles?

50:24.440 --> 50:27.480
 Like, okay, how should I raise my children?

50:27.480 --> 50:29.920
 It's gonna be a long time before AI,

50:29.920 --> 50:32.520
 you're going to say it has a good enough judgment

50:32.520 --> 50:34.680
 to do that, who should I marry?

50:34.680 --> 50:35.560
 All of those things.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.400
 Maybe you can get the computer to help you,

50:37.400 --> 50:40.040
 but if you just took data and new machine learning,

50:40.040 --> 50:41.280
 it's not gonna find it.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.400
 If you were to then take one of my criteria

50:44.400 --> 50:47.280
 for any of those questions,

50:47.280 --> 50:49.680
 and then say put them into an algorithm,

50:49.680 --> 50:53.120
 and you'd be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it.

50:53.120 --> 50:56.920
 But by and large, the mind should be used

50:56.920 --> 51:00.480
 for inventing and those creative things.

51:00.480 --> 51:03.960
 And then the computer should be used for processing

51:03.960 --> 51:06.880
 because it could process a lot more information,

51:06.880 --> 51:10.240
 a lot faster, a lot more accurately,

51:10.240 --> 51:12.200
 and a lot less emotionally.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.080
 So any notion of thinking

51:15.080 --> 51:17.680
 in the form of processing type thinking

51:17.680 --> 51:19.600
 should be done by a computer.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.520
 And anything that is in the notion of doing that,

51:22.520 --> 51:26.800
 other type of thinking should be operating with the brain,

51:26.800 --> 51:31.320
 operating in a way where you can say, ah, that makes sense.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.320
 You know, the process of reducing your understanding

51:35.320 --> 51:38.840
 down to principles is kind of like the process,

51:38.840 --> 51:43.320
 the first one you mentioned type of AI algorithm

51:43.320 --> 51:45.600
 where you're encoding your expertise,

51:45.600 --> 51:47.920
 you're trying to program, write a program,

51:47.920 --> 51:50.400
 the human is trying to write a program.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.560
 How do you think that's attainable?

51:53.560 --> 51:58.560
 The process of reducing principles to a computer program.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.600
 Or when you say when you write about,

52:03.600 --> 52:05.840
 when you think about principles,

52:05.840 --> 52:09.200
 is there still a human element that's not reducible

52:09.200 --> 52:10.920
 to an algorithm?

52:12.200 --> 52:17.200
 My experience has been that almost all things,

52:17.640 --> 52:19.600
 including those things that I thought

52:19.600 --> 52:23.760
 were pretty much impossible to express,

52:23.760 --> 52:27.640
 I've been able to express in algorithms,

52:27.640 --> 52:31.120
 but that doesn't constitute all things.

52:31.120 --> 52:36.120
 So you can, ooh, you can express far more

52:36.680 --> 52:39.400
 than you can imagine you'll be able to express.

52:39.400 --> 52:41.360
 So I use the example of, okay,

52:41.360 --> 52:43.920
 it's not, how do you raise your children?

52:43.920 --> 52:48.280
 Okay, you will be able to take it one piece by piece.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.600
 Okay, at what age, what school?

52:51.600 --> 52:56.600
 And the way to do that, my experience is to take that,

52:56.600 --> 53:01.600
 and when you're in the moment of making a decision,

53:02.120 --> 53:05.040
 or just past making a decision,

53:05.040 --> 53:09.080
 to take the time and to write down your criteria

53:09.080 --> 53:11.920
 for making that decision in words.

53:11.920 --> 53:16.440
 Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper.

53:16.440 --> 53:19.920
 I created an app, online call,

53:19.920 --> 53:23.440
 it's right now just on the iPhone, it'll be on Android.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
 I try getting it on Android, come on now.

53:25.440 --> 53:29.240
 It'll be a few months, it'll be on Android.

53:29.240 --> 53:33.040
 But it has an app in there that helps people

53:33.040 --> 53:35.160
 write down their own principles,

53:35.160 --> 53:37.160
 because this is very powerful.

53:37.160 --> 53:40.520
 So when you're in that moment where you've just,

53:40.520 --> 53:43.120
 you're thinking about it and you're thinking your criteria

53:43.120 --> 53:46.080
 for choosing the school for your child,

53:46.080 --> 53:47.680
 or whatever that might be,

53:47.680 --> 53:49.680
 and you write down your criteria,

53:49.680 --> 53:52.200
 or whatever they are, those principles,

53:52.200 --> 53:57.200
 you write down and that will, at that moment,

53:57.440 --> 54:00.280
 make you articulate your principles

54:00.280 --> 54:02.160
 in a very valuable way.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.840
 And if you have the way that we operate,

54:04.840 --> 54:06.480
 that you have easy access,

54:06.480 --> 54:08.800
 so when the next time that comes along,

54:08.800 --> 54:11.600
 you can go to that, or you can show those principles

54:11.600 --> 54:13.920
 to others to see if they're the right principles.

54:13.920 --> 54:16.920
 You will get a clarity of that principle

54:16.920 --> 54:19.040
 that's really invaluable in words,

54:19.040 --> 54:21.120
 and that'll help you a lot.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.000
 But then you start to think,

54:23.000 --> 54:26.040
 how do I express that in data?

54:26.040 --> 54:29.280
 And it'll shock you about how you can do that.

54:29.280 --> 54:33.320
 You'll form an equation that will show the relationship

54:33.320 --> 54:35.000
 between these particular parts,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.400
 and then essentially the variables

54:38.400 --> 54:41.560
 that are going to go into that particular equation,

54:41.560 --> 54:43.080
 and you will be able to do that.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.120
 And you take that little piece,

54:45.120 --> 54:48.040
 and you put it into the computer.

54:48.040 --> 54:49.880
 And then take the next little piece,

54:49.880 --> 54:51.920
 and you put that into the computer.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.040
 And before you know it,

54:54.040 --> 54:56.240
 you will have a decision making system

54:56.240 --> 54:58.080
 that's of the sort that I'm describing.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.520
 So you're almost making an argument

55:00.520 --> 55:03.120
 against an earlier statement you've made,

55:03.120 --> 55:04.160
 and you're convincing me.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.400
 At first you said,

55:05.400 --> 55:08.920
 there's no way a computer could raise a child, essentially.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.120
 But now you've described making me think of it.

55:12.120 --> 55:16.040
 If you have that kind of idea, meritocracy,

55:16.040 --> 55:17.560
 you have this rigorous approach

55:17.560 --> 55:19.240
 that Bridgewater takes on investment,

55:19.240 --> 55:21.880
 and apply it to raising a child.

55:21.880 --> 55:24.920
 It feels like through the process he just described,

55:24.920 --> 55:29.120
 we could, as a society, arrive at a set of principles

55:29.120 --> 55:33.880
 for raising a child, and encode it into computer.

55:33.880 --> 55:38.880
 That originality will not come from machine learning.

55:39.280 --> 55:42.280
 The first time you do, so that the original, yes.

55:42.280 --> 55:43.200
 That's what I'm referring to.

55:43.200 --> 55:45.920
 But eventually, as we together develop it,

55:45.920 --> 55:47.280
 and then we can automate it.

55:47.280 --> 55:50.200
 That's why I'm saying the processing

55:50.200 --> 55:51.840
 can be done by the computer.

55:51.840 --> 55:53.240
 So we're saying the same thing.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.960
 We're not inconsistent.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.480
 We're saying the same thing.

55:56.480 --> 55:58.640
 That the processing of that information

55:58.640 --> 56:01.280
 and those algorithms can be done by the computer

56:01.280 --> 56:03.600
 in a very, very effective way.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.280
 You don't need to sit there and process

56:05.280 --> 56:06.880
 and try to weigh all those things

56:06.880 --> 56:09.080
 in your equation and all those things.

56:09.080 --> 56:13.800
 But that notion of, okay, how do I get at that principle?

56:13.800 --> 56:15.760
 And you're saying you'd be surprised.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.920
 Yes, how much you can express.

56:18.920 --> 56:19.760
 That's right.

56:19.760 --> 56:22.120
 You can do that.

56:22.120 --> 56:25.840
 So this is where I think you're going to see the future.

56:25.840 --> 56:30.840
 And right now, we go to our devices

56:31.000 --> 56:35.680
 and we get information to a large extent.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.520
 And then we get some guidance.

56:37.520 --> 56:39.680
 We have our GPS and the like.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.440
 In my opinion, principles.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.840
 Principles, principles, principles.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.000
 I wanna emphasize that.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.480
 You write them down.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.280
 You've got those principles.

56:48.280 --> 56:52.720
 They will be converted into algorithms for decision making.

56:52.720 --> 56:55.200
 And they're gonna also have the benefit

56:55.200 --> 56:57.360
 of collective decision making.

56:57.360 --> 56:59.720
 Because right now, individuals,

56:59.720 --> 57:01.880
 based on what's stuck in their heads,

57:01.880 --> 57:05.200
 are making their decisions in very ignorant ways.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.960
 They're not the best decision makers.

57:06.960 --> 57:10.080
 They're not the best criteria and they're operating.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.520
 When those principles are written down

57:12.520 --> 57:14.840
 and converted into algorithms,

57:14.840 --> 57:16.560
 it's almost like you'll look at that

57:16.560 --> 57:18.240
 and follow the instructions.

57:18.240 --> 57:20.200
 And it'll give you better results.

57:20.200 --> 57:23.760
 Medicine will be much more like this.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.560
 You can go to your local doctor

57:25.560 --> 57:27.840
 and you could ask his point of view and whatever.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.520
 And he's rushed and he may not be the best doctor around.

57:31.520 --> 57:33.440
 And you're gonna go to this thing

57:33.440 --> 57:35.120
 and get that same information

57:35.120 --> 57:37.880
 or just automatically have it input in that.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.680
 And it's gonna tell you, okay,

57:39.680 --> 57:41.440
 here's what you should go do.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.240
 And it's gonna be much better than your local doctor.

57:44.240 --> 57:49.240
 And that, the converting of information into intelligence,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.680
 okay, intelligence is the thing.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.760
 We're coming out with, again, I'm 70

57:55.760 --> 57:57.920
 and I wanna pass all these things along.

57:57.920 --> 58:02.920
 So all these tools that I've found need to develop

58:03.240 --> 58:04.960
 all over these periods of time,

58:04.960 --> 58:07.440
 all those things I wanna make available

58:07.440 --> 58:10.960
 and what's gonna happen as they're going to see this,

58:10.960 --> 58:14.600
 they're going to see these tools operating much more

58:14.600 --> 58:19.600
 that way, the idea of converting data into intelligence.

58:20.040 --> 58:23.680
 Intelligence, for example, on what they are like.

58:23.680 --> 58:25.400
 Or what are your strengths and weaknesses?

58:25.400 --> 58:28.280
 Intelligence on who do I work well with

58:28.280 --> 58:29.480
 under what circumstances?

58:29.480 --> 58:30.240
 The personalized.

58:30.240 --> 58:31.360
 Intelligence.

58:31.360 --> 58:35.680
 We're gonna go from what are called systems of record,

58:35.680 --> 58:37.040
 which are a lot of, okay,

58:37.040 --> 58:41.600
 information organized in the right way, to intelligence.

58:41.600 --> 58:45.560
 And we're gonna, that'll be the next big move,

58:45.560 --> 58:46.640
 in my opinion.

58:46.640 --> 58:49.920
 And so you will get intelligence back.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.480
 And that intelligence comes from reducing things down

58:52.480 --> 58:54.120
 to principles and to...

58:54.120 --> 58:55.520
 That's how it happens.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.920
 So what's your intuition if you look at future societies,

58:58.920 --> 59:03.920
 do you think we'll be able to reduce a lot of the details

59:03.920 --> 59:09.240
 of our lives down to principles that would be further

59:09.240 --> 59:10.240
 and further automated?

59:10.240 --> 59:15.320
 I think the real question hinges on people's emotional,

59:15.320 --> 59:20.320
 emotions and irrational behaviors.

59:20.960 --> 59:25.960
 I think that there's subliminal things that we want, okay?

59:25.960 --> 59:30.040
 And then there's cerebral, you know, conscious logic.

59:30.040 --> 59:32.960
 And the two often are at odds.

59:32.960 --> 59:36.720
 So there's almost like two us and you, right?

59:36.720 --> 59:39.560
 And so let's say, what do you want?

59:40.720 --> 59:42.280
 Your mind will answer one thing,

59:42.280 --> 59:44.680
 your emotions will answer something else.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.960
 So when I think about it, I think emotions are,

59:47.960 --> 59:52.320
 I want inspiration, I want love is a good thing,

59:52.320 --> 59:54.040
 being able to have a good impact,

59:54.040 --> 59:59.040
 but it is in the reconciliation of your subliminal wants

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.720
 and your intellectual wants.

1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:05.800
 So that you really say they're aligned.

1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:08.880
 And so to do that in a way to get what you want.

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.360
 So irrationality is a bad thing

1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:16.480
 if it means that it doesn't make sense

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:18.200
 in getting you what you want,

1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.200
 but you better decide which you you're satisfying.

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:23.400
 Is it the lower level you emotional subliminal one

1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:24.600
 or is it the other?

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.080
 But if you can align them.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:30.440
 So what I find is that by going from my,

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:32.480
 you experience the decision,

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:34.800
 do this thing subliminally.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:36.040
 And that's the thing I want.

1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:37.720
 It comes to the surface.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:40.400
 I find that if I can align that

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:42.640
 with what my logical me wants

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.920
 and do the double check between them

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:47.920
 and I get the same sort of thing,

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:49.760
 that that helps me a lot.

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.120
 I find, for example, meditation is one of the things

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:55.200
 that helps to achieve that alignment.

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.520
 It's fantastic for achieving that alignment.

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.200
 And often then I also wanna not just do it in my head.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:03.600
 I wanna say, does that make sense?

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:06.280
 Help you, and so I do it with other people.

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.640
 And I say, okay, well, let's say I want this thing

1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:10.800
 and whatever, does that make sense?

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:13.680
 And when you do that kind of triangulation,

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:17.840
 you're to use and you do that with also the other way,

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:21.280
 then you certainly wanna be rational, right?

1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:24.640
 But rationality has to be defined by those things.

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:30.000
 And then you discover sort of new ideas that that drive

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.720
 your future, so you're always at the edge

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:34.400
 of the set of principles you've developed.

1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:36.200
 You're doing new things always.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.440
 That's where the intellect is needed.

1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:40.640
 Well, and the inspiration.

1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:43.640
 The inspiration is needed to do that, right?

1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:45.320
 Like what are you doing it for?

1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:49.080
 It's the excitement, the adventure, the curiosity,

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:49.920
 the hunger.

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:52.760
 If you can be Freud for a second,

1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:54.800
 what's in that subconscious?

1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:57.440
 What's the thing that drives us?

1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:00.040
 I think you can't generalize of us.

1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:02.640
 I think different people are driven by different things.

1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.840
 There's not a common one, right?

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:08.000
 So like if you would take the shapers,

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:13.000
 I think it is a combination of subliminally,

1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:18.080
 it's a combination of excitement, curiosity.

1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:20.040
 Is there a dark element there?

1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:22.880
 Is there demons, there's their fears,

1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:26.000
 is there in your sense something dark that drives them?

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.960
 Most of the ones that I'm dealing with,

1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:29.760
 I have not seen that.

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:34.760
 I see the, what I really see is who, if I can do that,

1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:37.760
 that would be the most dream.

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:40.320
 And then the act of creativity.

1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:44.240
 And you say, ooh, so excitement is one of the things.

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:48.000
 Curiosity is a big pull, okay?

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.800
 And then tenacity, you know, okay, to do those things.

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:55.400
 But definitely emotions are entering into it.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:58.800
 Then there's an intellectual component of it too, okay?

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:02.800
 It may be empathy, it may, can I have an impact?

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.480
 Can I have an impact?

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:07.880
 The desire to have an impact, that's an emotional thrill.

1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:10.320
 And, but it also has empathy.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.800
 And then you start to see spirituality,

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:16.000
 but a spirituality, I mean the connectedness to the whole.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.400
 You start to see people operate those things.

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:21.440
 Those tend to be the things that you see the most of.

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:24.880
 And I think you're gonna shut down this idea completely,

1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:28.880
 but there's a notion that some of these shapers

1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:32.840
 really walk the line between sort of madness and genius.

1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:36.320
 Do you think madness has a role in any of this?

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.680
 Or do you still see Steve Jobs and Elon Musk

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.600
 as fundamentally rational?

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.440
 Yeah, there's a continuum there.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:48.440
 And what comes to my mind is that genius

1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:53.440
 is that often at the edge of, in some cases,

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:58.960
 imaginary genius is at the edge of insanity.

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:03.480
 And it's almost like a radio that I think, okay,

1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:06.760
 if I can tune it just right, it's playing right,

1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:11.760
 but if I go a little bit too far, it goes off, okay?

1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:14.760
 And so you can see this.

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:19.320
 K. Jameson was studying bipolar, what it shows is that,

1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:22.000
 that's definitely the case,

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.640
 because when you're going out there,

1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:25.520
 that imagination, whatever,

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:29.000
 is that the can be near the edge sometimes,

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.280
 doesn't have to always be.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.320
 So let me ask you about automation

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.200
 that's been a part of public discourse recently.

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:41.800
 What's your view on the impact of automation

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:45.360
 of whether we're talking about AI, a more basic forms

1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:47.920
 of automation on the economy in the short term

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:49.120
 and the long term?

1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.760
 Do you have concerns about it as some do,

1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:55.360
 or do you think it's overblown?

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.200
 It's not overblown.

1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.480
 I mean, it's a giant thing.

1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.280
 It'll come at us in a very big way in the future.

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:04.440
 We're right at the edge of even really accelerating it.

1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:07.840
 It's had a big impact and it will have a big impact.

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:12.200
 And it's a two edge sword because it'll have

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.480
 tremendous benefits.

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:16.560
 And at the same time,

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:19.480
 it has profound benefits in employment

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:21.400
 and distributions of wealth.

1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.160
 Because the way I think, think about it is,

1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:27.520
 there are certain things human beings can do.

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:32.320
 And over time, we've evolved to go to

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:34.360
 almost higher and higher levels.

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.920
 And now we're almost like, we're at this level.

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:39.120
 You know, it used to be your labor

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.760
 and you would then do your labor and, okay,

1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:42.920
 we can get past the labor.

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:44.200
 We got tractors and things.

1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:46.160
 And you go up, up, up, up, up.

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:49.960
 And we're up to the point in our minds

1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:54.960
 where, okay, anything related to mental processing,

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:58.520
 the computer can probably do better and we can find that.

1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:01.880
 And so other than almost inventing,

1:06:01.880 --> 1:06:05.440
 you're at a point where the machines

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:09.680
 and the automation will probably do it better.

1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:12.840
 And that's accelerating and that's a force.

1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:15.480
 And that's a force for the good.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:20.480
 And at the same time, what it does is it displaces people

1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:22.800
 in terms of employment and changes,

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:25.240
 and it produces wealth gaps and all of that.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:28.000
 So I think the real issue is that,

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.160
 that has to be viewed as a national emergency.

1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:34.160
 In other words, I think the wealth,

1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:37.640
 the wealth gap, the income gap, the opportunity gap,

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:42.640
 all of those things that force is creating the problems

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:43.960
 that we're having today.

1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:47.120
 A lot of the problems, the great polarity,

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:51.080
 the disenfranchised, not equal,

1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:54.800
 not anything approaching equality of education.

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.640
 All of these problems, a lot of problems

1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:59.680
 are coming as a result of that.

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:04.680
 And so it needs to be viewed really as an emergency situation

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:08.400
 in which there's a good work,

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:13.400
 good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively

1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:17.160
 so that it's dealt with effectively.

1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:21.600
 So because it's good for the average,

1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:23.120
 it's good for the impact,

1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:24.440
 but it's not good for everyone

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:25.960
 and that creates that polarity.

1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:27.800
 So it's gotta be dealt with.

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:30.040
 Yeah, and you've talked about the American dream

1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:32.720
 and that that's something that all people

1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:34.080
 should have an opportunity for

1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:36.680
 and that we need to reform capitalism

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:39.440
 to give that opportunity for everyone.

1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:44.440
 Let me ask one of the ideas in terms of safety nets

1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:47.880
 that support that kind of opportunity.

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:49.040
 There's been a lot of discussion

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:51.760
 of universal basic income amongst people.

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.160
 So there's Andrew Yang who's running on that.

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:57.880
 He's a political candidate running for president

1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:00.480
 on the idea of universal basic income.

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:01.880
 What do you think about that?

1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:05.640
 Giving $1,000 or some amount of money to everybody

1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:09.320
 as a way to give them the padding,

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:12.360
 the freedom to sort of take leaps,

1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:14.200
 to take the call for adventure,

1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:16.760
 to take the crazy pursuits.

1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:19.160
 Before I get right into my thoughts

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:20.480
 on universal basic income,

1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:25.480
 I wanna start with the notion that

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.360
 opportunity, education, development,

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:33.680
 creating equality so that people say

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:36.200
 there's equal opportunity

1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:39.720
 and is the most important thing.

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:43.080
 And then to find out what is the amount?

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:44.880
 How are you going to provide that?

1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.880
 Where, how do you get the money into a public school system?

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.320
 How do you get the teaching?

1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:54.600
 How do you, the fleshing out that plan

1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:59.600
 to create equal opportunity in all of its various forms

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:03.000
 is the most pressing thing to do.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.240
 And so I'm, you know, that is that.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.360
 The opportunity, the most important one

1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:11.440
 you're kind of implying is the earlier, the better.

1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:14.480
 Sort of like opportunity to education.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:17.800
 So in the early development of a human being

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.080
 is when you should have the equal opportunities.

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:21.040
 That's the most important.

1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:21.880
 Right.

1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:24.200
 In the first phase of your life,

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:27.840
 which goes from birth until you're on your own

1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:30.440
 and you're an adult and you're now out there

1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:34.640
 and you deal with early childhood development, okay?

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:38.000
 And you take the brain and you say, what's important?

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.360
 The child care, okay?

1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:43.440
 Like it makes a world of difference, for example,

1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:46.480
 if you have good parents who are trying to think about

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:51.080
 instilling the stability in a non traumatic environment

1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:52.080
 to provide them.

1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:53.760
 So I would say the good guidance

1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:55.800
 that normally comes from parents

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:59.520
 and the good education that they're receiving

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.560
 are, you know, the most important things

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:06.200
 in that person's development.

1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:10.360
 The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there

1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:14.520
 and then to go into a market that's an equal opportunity

1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:19.000
 job market to be able to then go into that kind of market

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.800
 is a system that creates not only fairness,

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:25.000
 anything else is not fair.

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.160
 And then in addition to that,

1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.400
 it also is a more effective economic system

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:33.720
 because the consequences of not doing that

1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:35.720
 to a society are devastating.

1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:38.600
 If you look at what the difference in outcomes

1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:40.960
 for somebody who completes high school

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.520
 or doesn't complete high school

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:45.840
 or does each one of those state changes

1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:48.520
 and you look at what that means in terms of

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:52.080
 their costs to society, not only themselves,

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:54.680
 but their cost and incarceration costs

1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:57.480
 and crimes and all of those things,

1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:00.720
 it's economically better for the society

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:05.720
 and it's fairer if they can get those particular things.

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:07.720
 Once they have those things,

1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:09.240
 then you move on to other things.

1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:13.160
 But yes, from birth all the way through that process,

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:18.160
 anything less than that is bad, is a tragedy and so on.

1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:21.160
 So that's what, yeah, those are the things

1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:22.160
 that I'm estimating.

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:25.880
 And so my, what I would want above all else

1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:27.400
 is to provide that.

1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:28.760
 So with that in mind,

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:30.880
 now we'll talk about universal basic income.

1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:32.800
 Start with that, now we can talk about it.

1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.960
 Well, right, because you have to have that.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:39.120
 Now the question is what's the best way to provide that, okay?

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:41.440
 So when I look at UBI,

1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:43.960
 I really think is what is going to happen

1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.360
 with that thousand dollars, okay?

1:11:46.360 --> 1:11:50.600
 And will that thousand dollars come from another program?

1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:54.280
 Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?

1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:57.240
 Who are you giving the thousand dollars to

1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.800
 and what will they do for that thousand dollars?

1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:02.000
 I mean, like my reaction would be,

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.600
 I think it's a great thing that everybody should have

1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:07.840
 almost a thousand dollars in their bank and so on.

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:09.680
 But when do they get to make decisions?

1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:10.760
 Or who's the parent?

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:13.400
 A lot of pit times you can give a thousand dollars

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:15.840
 to somebody and it could have a negative result.

1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:16.880
 It can have, you know,

1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:19.400
 they can use that money detrimentally,

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.160
 not just productively.

1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:24.280
 And if that money's coming away from some of those other

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:26.560
 things that are going to produce the things I want

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.920
 and you're shifted to, let's say,

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:30.480
 to come in and give a check,

1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:32.640
 doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:33.800
 in providing those things

1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:36.600
 that I think are so fundamental important.

1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:39.080
 If it was just everybody can have a thousand dollars

1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:41.960
 and use it so when the time comes and use it well,

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:44.280
 that would be really, really good

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:47.320
 because it's almost like everybody you'd wish

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.760
 everybody could have a thousand dollars worth

1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:51.040
 of wiggle room in their lives.

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:51.880
 Okay.

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:54.000
 And I think that would be great.

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:55.080
 I love that.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.400
 But I want to make sure that these other things

1:12:58.400 --> 1:12:59.440
 that are taken care of.

1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:01.400
 So if it comes out of that budget

1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:04.160
 and I don't want it to come out of that budget

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.040
 that's going to be doing those things.

1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:08.880
 And so you have to figure it out.

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:12.200
 And you have a certain skepticism that human nature

1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:16.360
 will use, may not always, in fact,

1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:19.680
 frequently may not use that thousand dollars for the optimal

1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:21.960
 to support the optimal trajectory.

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:23.800
 Some will and some won't.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:27.400
 One of the big advantages of universal basic income

1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:29.680
 is that if you put it in the hands,

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:32.400
 let's say parents who know how to do the right things

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:34.960
 and make the right choices for their children

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.440
 because they're responsible and you say,

1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:38.960
 I'm going to give them a thousand dollars wiggle room

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:41.480
 to use for the benefit of their children.

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:43.320
 Wow, that sounds great.

1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:46.400
 If you put it in the hands of, let's say,

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:49.760
 an alcoholic or drug addicted parent

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:53.880
 who is not making those choices well for their children

1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:56.400
 and what they do is they take that thousand dollars

1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:58.120
 and they don't use it well,

1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:01.080
 then that's going to produce more harm than good.

1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:03.880
 Well put, you're, if I may say so,

1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:05.800
 one of the richest people in the world,

1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:11.320
 so you're a good person to ask, does money buy happiness?

1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:14.800
 No, it's been shown that between,

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:18.840
 once you get over a basic level of income

1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:21.960
 so that you can take care of the pain

1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:24.280
 that you can health and whatever,

1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:28.160
 there's no correlation between the level of happiness

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:31.520
 that one has and the level of money that one has.

1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:35.200
 That thing that has the highest correlation

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:39.160
 is quality relationships with others, community.

1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:41.240
 If you look at surveys of these things

1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:44.240
 across all surveys and all societies,

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.240
 it's a sense of community and interpersonal relationships.

1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:52.080
 That is not in any way correlated with money.

1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:56.840
 You can go down to native tribes in very poor places

1:14:56.840 --> 1:14:59.960
 or you can go in all different communities

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:02.760
 and so they have the opportunity to have that.

1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:06.520
 I'm very lucky in that I started with nothing

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:07.880
 so I had the full range.

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.920
 I can tell you, I'm not having money

1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:13.440
 and then having quite a lot of money

1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:15.520
 and I did that in the right order.

1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:17.440
 So you start from nothing in Long Island?

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:20.160
 Yeah, and my dad was a jazz musician

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:22.720
 but I had all really that I needed

1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:25.320
 because I had two parents who loved me

1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:28.440
 and took good care of me and I went to a public school

1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:30.360
 that was a good public school

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:33.640
 and basically you don't need much more than that

1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:36.480
 in order to, that's the equal opportunity part.

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:40.280
 Anyway, what I'm saying is I experienced the range

1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:44.200
 and there are many studies on the answer to your question.

1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:46.320
 No money does not bring happiness.

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:52.120
 Money gives you an ability to make choices.

1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:57.120
 Does it get in the way in any way of forming those deep

1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:00.600
 meaningful relationships?

1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:03.360
 It can, there are lots of ways that it makes negative.

1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:04.520
 That's one of them.

1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:06.240
 It could stand in the way of that.

1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:10.760
 Yes, okay, but I could almost list the ways

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:12.840
 that it could stand, it could be a problem.

1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:15.440
 Yeah, what does it buy?

1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:19.600
 So if you can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom.

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:23.440
 At the most fundamental level, it doesn't take a whole lot

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:28.440
 but it takes enough that you can take care of yourself

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:34.920
 and your family to be able to learn, do the basics,

1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:41.760
 of have the relationships, have healthcare,

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:44.440
 the basics of those types of things.

1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:46.560
 You know, you can cover the patients

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:50.320
 and then to have maybe enough security

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.320
 but maybe not too much security.

1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:53.440
 That's right, yeah.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.760
 That you essentially are okay.

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.680
 Okay, that's really good.

1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.200
 And you don't, that's what money will get you.

1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:06.560
 And everything else could go either way.

1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:08.000
 Well, no, there's more.

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:08.840
 There's more.

1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:13.520
 Okay, then beyond that, what it then starts to do,

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.120
 that's the most important thing.

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:18.000
 But beyond that, what it starts to do

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.840
 is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways.

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:27.480
 Okay, so for example, now I, you know, look at my case.

1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:32.080
 It's a, those dreams might not be just my own dreams.

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.760
 They're impact on others, dreams, okay?

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:39.880
 So my own dreams might be,

1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:42.600
 I don't know, I can pass along these,

1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:43.640
 at my stage in life,

1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:45.360
 I can pass along these principles to you

1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:46.880
 and I can give those things

1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:51.880
 or I can do whatever I can go on an adventure.

1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:54.880
 I can start a business.

1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:58.040
 I can do those other things, be productive.

1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:00.720
 I can self actualize in ways

1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:04.280
 that might be not possible otherwise.

1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:08.040
 That's my own belief.

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:11.000
 And then I can also help others.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.760
 I mean, this is, you know, to the extent

1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:15.440
 when you get older and with time and whatever very,

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:17.920
 you start to feel connected, spiritual,

1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:19.960
 spirituality is what I'm referring to.

1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.840
 You can start to have an effect on others

1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.480
 that's beneficial and so on, gives you the ability.

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.120
 I could tell you that people who are very wealthy

1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:32.320
 who have that feel that they don't have enough money.

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:35.200
 Bill Gates will feel almost broke

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:39.040
 because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.760
 through the Gates Foundation and things like that,

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:44.160
 you know, oh my God, he doesn't have enough money

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.440
 to accomplish the things he wishes for.

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:49.240
 But those things are not, you know,

1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:51.560
 they're not the most fundamental things.

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:56.240
 So I think that people sometimes think money has value.

1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:58.480
 Money doesn't have value.

1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:01.480
 Money is like you say, just a medium of exchange

1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:02.960
 at a store although well.

1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:05.000
 And so what you have to say is,

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.400
 what is it that you're going to buy?

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:10.120
 Now there are other people who get their gratification

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.480
 in ways that are different from me.

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:15.520
 But I think in many cases, let's say somebody

1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:18.920
 who used money to have a status symbol.

1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:22.280
 What would I say, or that's probably unhealthy.

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:25.160
 But then I don't know, somebody who says,

1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:28.160
 I love a great gorgeous painting

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:29.960
 and it's gonna cost lots of money.

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:34.120
 In my priorities, I can't get there.

1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.560
 But that doesn't mean, who am I to judge others

1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:41.080
 in terms of let's say their element of the freedom

1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:42.200
 to do those things.

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:43.960
 So it's a little bit complicated.

1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:45.840
 But by and large, that, you know,

1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:48.960
 that's my view on money and wealth.

1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:53.880
 So let me ask you in terms of the idea of,

1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:56.720
 so much of your passions in life has been

1:19:56.720 --> 1:19:59.960
 through something you might be able to call work.

1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:02.040
 Alan Watts has this quote.

1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:06.480
 He said that the real key to life, secret to life

1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:09.040
 is to be completely engaged with what you're doing

1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:10.680
 in the here and now.

1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:13.400
 And instead of calling it work, realize it as play.

1:20:14.280 --> 1:20:18.000
 So I'd like to ask, what is the role of work

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.680
 in your life's journey, or in a life's journey?

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:24.080
 And what do you think about this modern idea

1:20:24.080 --> 1:20:28.160
 of kind of separating work and work life balance?

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.280
 I have a principle that I believe in is,

1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:33.600
 make your work and your passion the same thing.

1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:34.440
 Okay.

1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:35.440
 Okay.

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:38.360
 So that's similar to you.

1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:40.440
 In other words, if you can make your work and your passion,

1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:42.040
 it's just gonna work out great.

1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:45.920
 And then of course, people have different purposes of work.

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:48.760
 And I don't wanna be theoretical about that.

1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:51.040
 People have to take care of their family.

1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:54.480
 So money at a certain point is,

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:57.760
 the base is an important component of that work.

1:20:57.760 --> 1:20:59.800
 So you look beyond that, what is the money

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:02.120
 gonna get you and what are you trying to achieve?

1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:04.880
 But the most important thing I agree

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:07.720
 is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:11.520
 Like if you can get into the thing that your mission,

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:13.800
 that you're on and you are excited

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:15.880
 about that mission that you're on.

1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:18.440
 And then you can do that with people

1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:22.000
 who you have the meaningful relationships with.

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.360
 You have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:29.040
 I mean, that is fabulous for most people.

1:21:30.920 --> 1:21:34.720
 And it seems that many people struggle to get there.

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:39.080
 Not out of, not necessarily because they're constrained

1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.320
 by the fact that they have the financial constraints

1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:45.800
 of having to provide for their family and so on.

1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:50.120
 But it's, I mean, this idea is out there

1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:51.920
 that there needs to be a work life balance,

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.840
 which means that most people,

1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:56.280
 and we're gonna return to the same things,

1:21:56.280 --> 1:21:57.840
 most doesn't mean optimal,

1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:01.960
 but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion,

1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:04.960
 not be not unifying work and passion.

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:06.240
 Why do you think that is?

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:08.760
 Well, the work life balance,

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.880
 there's a life arc that you go through

1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:17.920
 starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:19.840
 and there was a phase and there's a,

1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:22.280
 and you could look at the different degrees of happiness

1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:23.880
 that happen in those phases.

1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.600
 I can go through that if that was interesting,

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.640
 but we don't have time probably for it.

1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:30.640
 But you get in the part of the life,

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:34.360
 that part of the life which has the lowest level

1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:38.640
 of happiness is age 45 to 55.

1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.640
 And because as you move into this second phase

1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:46.400
 of your life, and the first phase of your life

1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:48.960
 is when you're learning dependent on others,

1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:51.680
 second phase of your life is when you're working

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:53.440
 and others are dependent on you

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:55.560
 and you're trying to be successful.

1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:58.120
 And in that phase of one's life,

1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:01.360
 you encounter the work life balance challenge

1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:04.000
 because you're trying to be successful at work

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:05.560
 and successful at parenting

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:08.440
 and successful and successful in all those things

1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:10.080
 that take your demand.

1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:11.240
 And they get into that.

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:15.320
 And I understand that problem in the work life balance.

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:20.080
 The issue is primarily to know how to approach that, okay?

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:24.160
 So I understand it's stressful, it produces stress

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:25.720
 and it produces bad results

1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:29.160
 and it produces the lowest level of happiness in one's life.

1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:31.920
 It's interesting as you get later in life,

1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:33.800
 the levels of happiness rise

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:37.680
 and the highest level of happiness is between ages 70 and 80,

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:39.440
 which is interesting for other reasons.

1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:44.440
 But in that spot, and the key to work life balance

1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:50.560
 is to realize and to learn how to get more

1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:53.760
 out of an hour of life, okay?

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:56.840
 Because an hour of work,

1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:00.560
 what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice

1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:02.520
 between one thing and another.

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.720
 And of course they do,

1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:08.320
 but they don't realize that if they develop the skill

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:11.320
 to get a lot more out of an hour,

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:14.680
 it's the equivalent of having many more hours in your life.

1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:17.480
 And so, you know, that's why in the book principles

1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:19.360
 I try to go into, okay now,

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.320
 how can you get a lot more out of an hour?

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:25.920
 That allows you to get more life into your life

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:28.040
 and it reduces the work life balance.

1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:31.400
 And that's the primary struggle in that 35 to 45.

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:35.160
 If you could linger on that,

1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:37.880
 sort of what are the ups and downs of life

1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:39.960
 in terms of happiness in general

1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:42.960
 and perhaps in your own life

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:46.600
 when you look back at the moments, the peaks?

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:50.040
 It's pretty much the same pattern.

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:54.400
 Early in one's life tends to be a very happy period

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:58.600
 all the way up and 16 is like a really great happy,

1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:00.920
 you know, I think like myself,

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.400
 you start to get elements of freedom,

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:05.640
 you get your driver's license, whatever,

1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:07.680
 but 16 is there.

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:10.560
 Junior year in high school quite often

1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.760
 could be a stressful period

1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:13.760
 to try to get the thing about the high school.

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.240
 You go into college,

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:18.400
 tends to be very happiness, generally speaking.

1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:21.920
 Freedom and then freedom, friendships,

1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:24.160
 all of that freedom is a big thing.

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:28.560
 And then you, and then 23 is a peak point

1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:31.600
 kind of in happiness, that freedom.

1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:34.920
 Then sequentially one has a great time,

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:36.520
 they date, they go out and so on,

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.840
 you find the love of your life,

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:41.520
 you begin to develop a family.

1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:44.360
 And then with that as time happens,

1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:47.960
 you have more of your work life balance challenges

1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:50.120
 that come in your responsibilities.

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:53.840
 And then as you get there in that mid part of your life,

1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:56.480
 that is the biggest struggle.

1:25:56.480 --> 1:25:59.680
 Chances are you will crash in that period of time,

1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:02.400
 you know, you'll have your series of failures,

1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:05.480
 that's when you go into the abyss,

1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:08.960
 you learn, you hopefully learn from those mistakes,

1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:12.360
 you have to metamorphosis, you come out, you change,

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.440
 you hopefully become better

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:17.160
 and you take more responsibilities and so on.

1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:20.720
 And then when you get to the later part,

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:24.520
 as you are starting to approach the transition

1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.520
 and that late part of the second phase of your life

1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:31.160
 before you go into the third phase of your life,

1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:33.760
 second phase is you're working, trying to be successful.

1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:36.720
 Third phase of your life is

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:40.400
 you want people to be successful without you, okay?

1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:41.600
 Yes.

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:43.880
 You want your kids to be successful without you

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.360
 because when you're at that phase,

1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:48.600
 they're making their transition

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.520
 from the first phase to the second phase

1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:51.960
 and they're trying to be successful

1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:53.960
 and you want them to be successful without you

1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:58.680
 and your parents are gone and then you have freedom.

1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:00.600
 And then you have freedom again.

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:04.160
 And with that freedom and then you have these,

1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:06.760
 history has shown with this, you have friendships,

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:09.640
 you have perspective on life, you have different things.

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.040
 And that's one of the reasons

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:13.680
 that that later part of the life can be real.

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:16.160
 On average, actually, it's the highest.

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:17.640
 Very interesting thing.

1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:21.120
 If there are surveys and say,

1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:24.600
 how good do you look and how good do you feel?

1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:28.360
 And that's the highest survey.

1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:30.440
 Now, they're not looking the best

1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:32.200
 and they're not feeling the best, right?

1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:35.160
 Maybe it's 35 that they're actually looking the best

1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:36.320
 and feeling the best.

1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:39.320
 But they rank the highest at that point,

1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:41.560
 survey results of being the highest

1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:44.240
 in that 70 to 80 period of time

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:47.200
 because it has to do with an attitude on life.

1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:48.960
 Then you start to have grandkids.

1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.760
 Oh, grandkids are great.

1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:54.680
 And you start to experience that transition well.

1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:58.440
 So that's what the arc of life pretty much looks like.

1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:00.960
 And I'm experiencing it, you know?

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:02.320
 You've lived it.

1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:05.760
 When you meditate, we're all human, we're all mortal.

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.560
 When you meditate on your own mortality,

1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:14.560
 having achieved a lot of success on whatever dimension,

1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:17.000
 what do you think is the meaning of it all?

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.280
 The meaning of our short existence on earth

1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:22.120
 as human beings?

1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.120
 I think that evolution is the greatest force

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:30.120
 of the universe and that we're all tiny bits

1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:33.480
 of an evolutionary type of process

1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:38.000
 where it's just matter and machines that go through time.

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.000
 And that we all have a deeply embedded inclination

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.480
 to evolve and contribute to evolution.

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:52.000
 So I think it's to personally evolve

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.240
 and contribute to evolution.

1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:56.200
 I could have predicted you would answer that way.

1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:58.280
 It's brilliant and exactly right.

1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:02.960
 And I think we've said it before, but I'll say it again.

1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:05.440
 You have a lot of incredible videos out there

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:07.520
 that people should definitely watch.

1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:08.760
 I don't say this often.

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:11.560
 I mean, it's literally the best spend of time.

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.000
 And in terms of reading principles

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.080
 and reading basically anything you write on LinkedIn

1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:18.480
 and so on is a really good use of time.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.640
 It's a lot of light bulb moments,

1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.680
 a lot of transformative ideas in there.

1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:24.760
 So Ray, thank you so much.

1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:26.640
 It's been an honor, I really appreciate it.

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.040
 It's been a pleasure for me too.

1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:31.320
