00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
 The following is a conversation with Josh Barnett, one of the greatest fighters and

00:04.760 --> 00:10.960
 submission wrestlers in history, with an epic 25 year career that includes being the UFC

00:10.960 --> 00:14.480
 heavyweight champion and countless other accolades.

00:14.480 --> 00:19.680
 He also happens to be one of the most intelligent and brutally honest human beings in all of

00:19.680 --> 00:27.200
 martial arts, and especially so about his appreciation of and fascination with violence.

00:27.200 --> 00:32.080
 Quick mention of our sponsors, which feels ridiculous to say after that introduction.

00:32.080 --> 00:38.440

 As a side note, let me say that I've been a fan of Josh Barnett for a long time.

00:49.160 --> 00:54.480
 This conversation was indeed a long time coming and I'm sure we'll talk many times again.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.720
 For what it's worth, I'm a student of combat sports and admire when they're done at the

00:58.720 --> 01:04.600
 highest level, either through masterful execution of skill or relentless dominance of pure

01:04.600 --> 01:05.800
 guts.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.320
 For context, I'm a black belt in jiu jitsu and have competed in wrestling, submission

01:10.320 --> 01:15.000
 grappling, jiu jitsu, judo, and even catch wrestling, which is a variant of submission

01:15.000 --> 01:20.400
 grappling that Josh is one of the great practitioners, scholars, and teachers of.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.280
 I could probably talk for hours about what I've learned from my time on the mat, but

01:24.280 --> 01:28.640
 if I were to say one thing, it is that the mat is honest.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.480
 You can't run away from yourself when you step on the mat.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.920
 It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself, all the delusions you might

01:35.920 --> 01:41.040
 have, or at least I had, that there's anything in this world that can be achieved except

01:41.040 --> 01:43.720
 through blood, sweat, and tears.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.440
 That honesty, taken to the highest levels, as is the case with Josh, creates the most

01:48.440 --> 01:54.160
 special of human beings and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to.

 And now, here's my conversation with Josh Barnett.

02:07.640 --> 02:11.720
 Who were the philosophers and philosophical ideas that influenced you the most?

02:11.720 --> 02:13.160
 Are we just jumping right in?

02:13.160 --> 02:15.160
 We're right in into the deepest.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.160
 No foreplay on camera.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.440
 I had an interesting philosophical journey, at least I think it's interesting.

02:21.440 --> 02:31.280
 And that was, I think, as far as organized philosophy, or maybe authentic is not the

02:31.280 --> 02:35.840
 right word, but like, yeah, we'll say organized.

02:35.840 --> 02:43.440
 I would say that Nietzsche is probably one of the people with the most influence on me.

02:43.440 --> 02:51.520
 But I also feel like, to a degree, your personality will oftentimes dictate what philosophers that

02:51.520 --> 02:53.520
 you can vibe with.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.880
 So what ideas from Nietzsche was it, the Ubermensch?

02:56.880 --> 03:03.040
 Definitely the Ubermensch is huge to me because I see it as an extension of basically the

03:03.040 --> 03:09.880
 religious concepts of God and higher ideals, but just put into a different secular context.

03:09.880 --> 03:16.040
 And the idea also that the Ubermensch is a striving and overcoming something that you're

03:16.040 --> 03:24.480
 always working towards that very few will ever, it's not like the concept that you can

03:24.480 --> 03:25.480
 just make them.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.880
 It doesn't happen that way.

03:26.880 --> 03:33.720
 And it's not based simply upon, if you were, say, put through a genetic program and turned

03:33.720 --> 03:36.680
 into a super soldier, like that wouldn't make it.

03:36.680 --> 03:42.400
 That's like the very surface level and incorrect understanding of what the Ubermensch is.

03:42.400 --> 03:50.120
 The Ubermensch is the idea of this kind of human that transcends all the weaker lower

03:50.120 --> 03:53.320
 aspects of humans, which we're full of.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.040
 But I also think that there's an element in Nietzsche's writing that suggests that it's

03:57.040 --> 04:01.320
 not something you can even be in all the time.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.560
 Like it's even a temporary state because it's not something that we're capable of maintaining.

04:05.560 --> 04:13.600
 It's something to strive for, like a morality, an image, an ideal, a set of principles that

04:13.600 --> 04:21.680
 we can connect to that doesn't rely on otherworldly kind of out there things deeply human.

04:21.680 --> 04:29.000
 With Nietzsche, I feel like the concept of the Ubermensch is something built on authenticity

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
 as well.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.320
 As Heidegger would say, like Dasein, right?

04:31.320 --> 04:37.600
 So when you are authentic and Heidegger being a follower of Nietzsche's and highly influenced

04:37.600 --> 04:45.480
 by him, I think that the Ubermensch is an example of authenticity in that it isn't about trying

04:45.480 --> 04:52.960
 to be anything that you cannot be or to go against who you are, but to actually understand

04:52.960 --> 04:59.520
 that, accept that, and then work with what you can work with and create from your lump

04:59.520 --> 05:01.480
 of clay that is you.

05:01.480 --> 05:07.600
 Because there are certain things that are just not going to happen for me because it's

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
 not in my proclivity.

05:08.600 --> 05:18.320
 I mean, I'm never going to be five foot tall and 120 pounds, that again, I guess.

05:18.320 --> 05:24.680
 But as you get more in tune with who you are, as you start learning more about what unique

05:24.680 --> 05:31.200
 things or at least what that combination that makes you, that gestalt part of yourself,

05:31.200 --> 05:37.160
 what those things are and how you can use them, then you can work towards taking what

05:37.160 --> 05:40.960
 that is and seeing if you can get to that point.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.320
 Now, the likelihood is, no, maybe probably never.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.960
 I mean, but we can never achieve Godhood yet.

05:45.960 --> 05:52.080
 Religion is a constant striving and a look at a higher ideal concept.

05:52.080 --> 05:57.520
 Even if it's multiple gods or one god, it's still essentially all built around this concept.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.360
 Like I like the idea of Catholic's original sin.

06:01.360 --> 06:06.240
 If you think of sin, not as evil, but as missing the mark, the archer's term where it derives

06:06.240 --> 06:09.440
 or even like in Spanish without.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.960
 So as being, if you accept that you are imperfect, if you accept that you need to constantly

06:14.960 --> 06:20.200
 strive even against yourself, because you will figure out the best ways at which to

06:20.200 --> 06:25.480
 submarine your own capabilities, submarine your own dreams and wishes and whatever, you

06:25.480 --> 06:27.360
 will ruin them more than anything else.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.160
 And you will tell yourself that you ruined them on purpose for a good reason, or you'll

06:31.160 --> 06:35.680
 say that you'll figure out a way to put it on everything else but yourself.

06:35.680 --> 06:41.640
 And so the idea of thinking of, well, as I'm starting off on this whole thing, I got a

06:41.640 --> 06:42.640
 lot of work to do.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.640
 And that's just the way it is.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.040
 And I got to figure out what areas those are going to be.

06:46.040 --> 06:51.080
 And so, you know, I thought, if I think of original sin actually can be, that can be

06:51.080 --> 06:59.120
 kind of a clever idea, but it's also just accepting that we're all uniquely strange

06:59.120 --> 07:01.320
 and unequal in our own ways.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.040
 But we have to figure out how that fits in.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.920
 The word authenticity kind of connects to all of that.

07:05.920 --> 07:12.720
 So striving to be your authentic self means figuring out exactly the shape of the flaws,

07:12.720 --> 07:17.240
 the character of your little demons that you get to play with and around them finding a

07:17.240 --> 07:23.240
 path to whatever the hell, ideal versions of yourself you can carve and pretending like

07:23.240 --> 07:25.520
 that's such a thing as even possible.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.640
 The other idea about Nietzsche is, on his idea of morality, he presents the argument

07:30.640 --> 07:36.680
 that morality is a human illusion and that, you know, there's not such a thing as good

07:36.680 --> 07:37.680
 and evil.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.480
 And these are all kind of constructs.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.640
 Do you think there's such a thing as good and evil?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.800
 That's connected to some objective reality?

07:44.800 --> 07:49.880
 I think that there are some, I actually do believe that there are some universals.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.520
 I'm not Kantian in any way, but I do think that there are some universals.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.160
 And the thing that actually brought me to even the concept of that was Jung.

07:57.160 --> 08:04.840
 So, you know, Jung's concept of the collective unconsciousness and then taking that thought

08:04.840 --> 08:11.760
 and then applying it to looking through history and the most varied history you can find.

08:11.760 --> 08:19.640
 So I would say probably religion is your earliest one that you can get for written history or

08:19.640 --> 08:28.640
 written examples of human behavior and psychology at the furthest that we can look into it from

08:28.640 --> 08:32.800
 man's hand to whatever the medium is, cuneiform or whatever.

08:32.800 --> 08:39.280
 But as you do that, and then let's say going from Mesopotamia to India to, you know, Europe

08:39.280 --> 08:44.080
 to and just going from all these places as disparate as they may seem, as many different

08:44.080 --> 08:47.760
 cultures and ethnicities and religions and how the religions will vary quite a bit from

08:47.760 --> 08:53.600
 monotheist, polytheist and so on and so forth.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.800
 But then just seeing how there's all the through lines.

08:55.800 --> 09:01.880
 And of course, Campbell, he did this much earlier than me thinking about it.

09:01.880 --> 09:08.880
 But I think that by looking at things that way and starting to find the threads instead

09:08.880 --> 09:13.160
 of always just looking at everything as being its own compartmentalized concept is if it

09:13.160 --> 09:19.200
 only applies to this time, this people like getting overly pomo about it is just a really

09:19.200 --> 09:21.600
 idiotic postmodern.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.880
 So you think that there is just like Joseph Campbell, there's a thread that connects all

09:26.880 --> 09:31.320
 of these stories, narratives that we construct for ourselves as we evolve.

09:31.320 --> 09:37.640
 And that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas of maybe on the morality side,

09:37.640 --> 09:39.760
 which is the trickiest one of good and evil.

09:39.760 --> 09:40.760
 Somewhat.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.760
 Yeah.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.240
 I think that a lot of this stuff is just derived from a biological perspective.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.160
 I feel like these things are innate within us.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.240
 Do you think our innately humans are good?

09:50.240 --> 09:51.240
 Like we?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.240
 No.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.240
 I don't.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.600
 I feel like, I also feel like there's an issue of scale too.

09:56.600 --> 10:03.680
 Like, Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his, the way he interacts with groups

10:03.680 --> 10:04.840
 in terms of scale.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.880
 You know, what is this thing about like at a, at the familial level, I'm a, I'm a communist

10:09.880 --> 10:15.680
 and then at the civic level, I'm a, I'm a Republican or something and that's other level.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.600
 And then it goes on at the widest level.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.600
 He's a libertarian or something of that nature, you know, like fundamentally human interaction

10:21.600 --> 10:29.240
 changes on scale, on scale and scale and also from, you know, subjective to the environment

10:29.240 --> 10:30.240
 around them.

10:30.240 --> 10:35.160
 So I don't even mean environment just in the sake of physical environment, nature, right?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.760
 Like nature's constantly trying to murder you.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.840
 Well, it's not really trying.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.600
 It's just nature's being nature, the universe is the universe.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.840
 And at times it takes you out.

10:43.840 --> 10:49.560
 It's just not with any particular compunction or prejudice.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.960
 It just, oops, you know, sorry, there's no more dodos.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.960
 My bad.

10:53.960 --> 11:00.080
 Don't you think the particular flavor of the complexity that is the human mind was created

11:00.080 --> 11:07.000
 like, let me make an argument for that all people are fundamentally good is there's an

11:07.000 --> 11:15.640
 evolutionary advantage to being, to striving, to cooperate, to add more love to the world

11:15.640 --> 11:18.240
 of like compassion, empathy, all that kind of stuff.

11:18.240 --> 11:25.880
 And that the very thing that created the human mind was this evolutionary advantage, whatever

11:25.880 --> 11:29.040
 the force is behind this evolutionary advantage and scale.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
 Yes.

11:30.040 --> 11:36.920
 So when we're dealing with a small tribe, sure, when you meet another tribe, maybe there's

11:36.920 --> 11:39.160
 other factors that are going to end to that.

11:39.160 --> 11:47.560
 Let's say you scale up and so your 150 has exceeded their 150 and like you start to get

11:47.560 --> 11:55.680
 to a certain point where you can't really be close enough to someone down the line of

11:55.680 --> 12:02.400
 some of that next like that 150 is 150, 150, and they just now all of a sudden become some

12:02.400 --> 12:04.280
 guy, whatever.

12:04.280 --> 12:12.680
 And when it comes to some guy at once it starts hitting scale, I don't know that it's capable.

12:12.680 --> 12:19.960
 People can be as as magnanimous to a stranger as to the known.

12:19.960 --> 12:25.320
 If they orient themselves to be secure enough, because it does come to security insecurity

12:25.320 --> 12:30.760
 in one way or the other, either brought on by the unknown, brought on by an actual threat,

12:30.760 --> 12:35.320
 brought on by even their own, as we would use the word insecurity in that their own insecurity

12:35.320 --> 12:41.200
 within their own capabilities, their own belief in themselves, all these things can change

12:41.200 --> 12:47.280
 things from being compassionate and what have you to at least at the very least, maybe not

12:47.280 --> 12:55.080
 evil, but self interest driven to the point of a negative results for those that aren't,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
 you know what I mean?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
 Right.

12:57.080 --> 13:01.800
 But another way to frame that is maybe it's less about scale and more about the amount

13:01.800 --> 13:03.120
 of resources available.

13:03.120 --> 13:11.800
 So if we're overflowing with resources in terms of security and safety, all the things

13:11.800 --> 13:16.960
 you've mentioned, if we have more than enough resources than the way we treat a stranger,

13:16.960 --> 13:23.280
 the way we position ourselves towards that stranger might be in a way that allows us

13:23.280 --> 13:28.160
 to be our real human selves as opposed to sort of our animal self.

13:28.160 --> 13:33.320
 And therefore it's mostly about how clever can we descendants of AIDS be in coming up

13:33.320 --> 13:39.680
 with all cool kinds of technologies and ways to efficiently use the resources we have such

13:39.680 --> 13:41.320
 that we're not constrained.

13:41.320 --> 13:50.640
 And my hope is that we can, that human innovation will outpace the growth of our, the number

13:50.640 --> 13:53.120
 of people that are starting for resources.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.120
 Yes.

13:54.120 --> 13:59.520
 I think that there's a lot of rationality behind this argument.

13:59.520 --> 14:11.120
 And in some ways I agree and a lot of ways I see it as missing the point of how this

14:11.120 --> 14:16.800
 experiment has been playing out across time when you look at what, for one, it's like

14:16.800 --> 14:25.400
 defined resources, you know, what is a, what is a resource of, as humans would define it,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
 right?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
 Or wealth even.

14:27.400 --> 14:33.520
 So you can say, well, you know, an iPhone's a resource, the internet's a resource, water

14:33.520 --> 14:39.440
 obviously is a resource, but if we weigh them, what is more important to human beings?

14:39.440 --> 14:42.760
 Water, internet or iPhones, it's water, right?

14:42.760 --> 14:48.720
 So if we look at resources, if we start with what do human beings need to live?

14:48.720 --> 14:56.520
 I mean, actually live, not live here in this bullshit fantasy creation extension of our

14:56.520 --> 15:01.600
 own ingenuity and, you know, a prison of our own creation and also a paradise of our own

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
 creation.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.200
 But this is not how human beings normally live.

15:05.200 --> 15:12.080
 This is all built upon stuff on, on, this is built on concept, on idea, and some, and

15:12.080 --> 15:16.120
 some of it's built on just, well, this is the paradigm, so this is what you do.

15:16.120 --> 15:22.680
 Human beings need food, they need water to survive, they need shelter from the elements

15:22.680 --> 15:27.560
 and they need certain skills to perpetuate these things and be able to pass them down

15:27.560 --> 15:33.760
 so that they can, so that these things don't become, you don't end up in this, this gap

15:33.760 --> 15:40.760
 where you have to relearn things because if it's lost, then that time before you can

15:40.760 --> 15:45.920
 get it back again is going to be a dark ages of sorts, you know, or it's going to be highly

15:45.920 --> 15:51.680
 detrimental to your group because not knowing how to fish, not knowing how to hunt, not

15:51.680 --> 15:58.120
 knowing how to even clean and cook the game once you have it could be lethal.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
 That's fascinating.

15:59.120 --> 16:03.200
 Do you think that that is a basic resource, the knowledge to attain the very low level

16:03.200 --> 16:04.200
 things of water and food?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
 Right.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.200
 And we'll figure it out.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.600
 We did it once before and we've done it over and over and over and over again.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
 It's just costly.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
 Yes.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.840
 It has costs for sure.

16:14.840 --> 16:22.120
 But when you think of how you look at the, well, we'll just deal with the first world

16:22.120 --> 16:23.520
 of the West.

16:23.520 --> 16:30.560
 You look at the path line, the pathway of Western civilization and its growth and then

16:30.560 --> 16:38.000
 you look at how technology injected into it over time, you know, how it magnifies things

16:38.000 --> 16:43.920
 or pushes things at orders of magnitude faster and then the internet comes along even faster,

16:43.920 --> 16:49.240
 you know, and so you're watching industrial revolution to, what is it, the capacitor

16:49.240 --> 16:50.240
 and then so on.

16:50.240 --> 16:55.320
 It goes further and further and as the internet and technology, especially on the electronic

16:55.320 --> 17:04.200
 side of things, start increasing in capability, it massively outpaces even our necessity for

17:04.200 --> 17:05.200
 it at times.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.480
 It becomes, you know, plant obsolescence happens quicker and over and over and over again.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.240
 And wealth increases, increases, increases, increases in terms of the things that we're

17:15.240 --> 17:16.240
 able to acquire.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.240
 Right.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.800
 I mean, I've seen homeless people with smartphones, you know.

17:19.800 --> 17:30.000
 So we're living in the most wealth laden, luxury laden age of all of humanity yet.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.440
 What happens when we see calamity or people going on hard time, what are they, the things

17:35.440 --> 17:40.080
 that they value, you know, what do people go to an argument about the cost of things

17:40.080 --> 17:44.760
 that are luxury items generally and not necessity items, you know.

17:44.760 --> 17:52.240
 We get into fights about, you know, things that are at the end of the day, not necessities

17:52.240 --> 17:53.240
 to us.

17:53.240 --> 17:58.320
 You know, people are so concerned about Netflix and the internet and personally, I'm very

17:58.320 --> 18:02.600
 concerned about the internet because I look at it as my own little personal library of

18:02.600 --> 18:05.240
 Alexandria in my pocket.

18:05.240 --> 18:09.200
 That's what I love about it and the ability to have a tool as effective as it is, even

18:09.200 --> 18:15.000
 though I'm in a constant battle to not let that tool become a vice or to become something

18:15.000 --> 18:19.720
 that actually brings me to a lower state.

18:19.720 --> 18:25.720
 The question is over the, are we willing to murder each other over Netflix versus murder

18:25.720 --> 18:27.320
 each other over water?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.920
 We're willing to murder each other over water.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
 That's a given.

18:30.920 --> 18:31.920
 Right.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.920
 But that's our animalistic selves.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.680
 Well, it's also a necessity for, it's animalistic, but it's also either you do it or you don't.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.680
 Right?

18:38.680 --> 18:45.880
 Unless somebody's willing to share that water or if that water is of such a limited capability

18:45.880 --> 18:51.360
 or such a limited amount, then you will have to murder to have that water.

18:51.360 --> 18:57.560
 But over Netflix, the argument is the higher, we get up to this hierarchy of what we consider

18:57.560 --> 19:03.040
 in Los Angeles resources, we're less willing to commit violence.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.880
 We're less willing to commit violence, I would say over Netflix, but we are willing to commit

19:06.880 --> 19:11.920
 violence over Netflix, over everything associated with Netflix, over televisions, over sneakers,

19:11.920 --> 19:20.120
 over, you know, I mean, when we look at a good, I mean, the majority of the stuff that

19:20.120 --> 19:27.320
 came with the riots, I mean, it was use car dealerships, targets, I mean, and then you

19:27.320 --> 19:30.600
 look and it's like, well, okay, well, what are people, what are they got?

19:30.600 --> 19:34.400
 What are they so hell bent to get out of this whole thing?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.440
 And I'm even talking about the ideological elements or anything like that.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.640
 Just like, okay, something's going on, boom, looting, whatever, you know, what are you

19:41.640 --> 19:42.640
 going to loot?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.640
 Yeah.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.400
 You know, you'll have AOC say, oh, people needing bread, I didn't see a single loaf of bread.

19:48.400 --> 19:54.520
 You know, I saw TV, television, poetry, Josh, you know, but to me, it is poetry in a sense

19:54.520 --> 20:01.520
 because you get to see who we, how we actually are operating, you know, what are, what is

20:01.520 --> 20:03.640
 becoming first principles to most people.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.960
 Well, wait, wait, but you could also argue though, those riots were more like the madness

20:06.960 --> 20:10.000
 of crowds, which is definitely a lot more than just that.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.720
 I'm just saying that given a chance, it's like, okay, boom, the lights are off, the

20:14.720 --> 20:20.920
 grid is down, we've hacked into the whole system, turn into an 80s movie and you have

20:20.920 --> 20:26.640
 the ability to go get ahold of whatever it is that you think is most important.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.800
 And what do we do?

20:27.800 --> 20:33.080
 And I say we, as in, you know, I'm including all of us, we grab a TV, we, we attack it,

20:33.080 --> 20:35.320
 we break into a sneaker store on Melrose.

20:35.320 --> 20:41.880
 We do, it's just like, we still giant cause statues where the value of that is completely

20:41.880 --> 20:42.880
 market driven.

20:42.880 --> 20:48.240
 Like, it's just a piece of polypropylene or whatever, butyl and, you know, it's cool.

20:48.240 --> 20:55.080
 I'm a big fan of art, but it's like, you know, I can't eat that.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.040
 And at the end of the day, man, you're sitting there with your, with your, like, what'd you

20:58.040 --> 20:59.040
 do today, honey?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.040
 What'd you get?

21:00.040 --> 21:02.480
 You know, man, we were able to, you know, oh, I got this.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.280
 I got this designer art statue.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.280
 Yeah.

21:05.280 --> 21:09.400
 Are you, are you going to go, well, you can't really sell it on the, on like the art markets

21:09.400 --> 21:10.840
 where people were really going to pay for it.

21:10.840 --> 21:15.280
 So are you going to become an underground art dealer with your one piece of cause art?

21:15.280 --> 21:19.520
 One interesting thing, just before I forget it, you mentioned the library of Alexandria

21:19.520 --> 21:26.680
 and your phone, well, your phone, but also just thinking of your little world that you're

21:26.680 --> 21:28.400
 creating for yourself on the internet.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.720
 That's a really powerful way to actually phrase it.

21:30.720 --> 21:34.040
 One of the things that you've been on Joe Rogan several times,

21:34.040 --> 21:36.280
 Although everybody always comes to me and go, oh, that was so great.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.360
 I didn't know you, you're on, you've been on Joe Rogan.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.200
 I go, this is like my fifth time, dude.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.840
 I've been a fan of yours for a long time from, from other avenues.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.160
 This is a long time coming actually everybody.

21:47.160 --> 21:54.040
 You have no idea like how many times through messaging and missing each other over the years.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.040
 This is ridiculous.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.200
 This is a long time coming.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.200
 You don't realize how special this is for us.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.080
 This is a, well, I'm also a starstruck.

22:00.080 --> 22:05.760
 Don't talk about this, but you symbolize something very important to me through my journey,

22:05.760 --> 22:09.960
 through wrestling, through Jiu Jitsu, through Judo, through just street fighting, through

22:09.960 --> 22:11.600
 just combat.

22:11.600 --> 22:17.640
 There's a, you're the, in some sense, the devil on my shoulder of like, of violence

22:17.640 --> 22:22.280
 in a good, in a, in a devil gets a bad rap.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.280
 He does get a bad rap.

22:23.280 --> 22:30.720
 I realize, you know, sitting in, in ice down at that low ass level, you know, but you know,

22:30.720 --> 22:35.000
 the angel side is more like the athletic, the sport, the science, the tech, the, the

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
 technical, the chest side of things.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.480
 So, uh, but on the library, Alexander, let me ask, uh, because you were on Joe Rogan,

22:44.480 --> 22:46.000
 it does make me really sad.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.240
 And I realized that I'm just probably being romantic that his most of his library of interviews

22:53.240 --> 22:58.400
 that were on YouTube have not been taken down because he wanted to Spotify.

22:58.400 --> 23:03.360
 And that was the first, I'm probably an idiot, but it was the first time I realized that

23:03.360 --> 23:07.960
 this knowledge that we've been building up on the internet doesn't necessarily last forever.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.200
 No, it doesn't.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.440
 Unless you preserve it.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.160
 I mean, it's like all things.

23:12.160 --> 23:17.240
 If you do not preserve them, if you do not make, uh, efforts, um, you know, so many of

23:17.240 --> 23:20.760
 my, it just really brings the minor off the top of my head.

23:20.760 --> 23:27.520
 So many friends of mine that are Jewish, uh, you know, they're, they're basically secular,

23:27.520 --> 23:33.360
 but yet through even the secular aspect of just keeping the traditions alive.

23:33.360 --> 23:37.080
 It's like, well, you could always pick a book and read about it.

23:37.080 --> 23:44.360
 Clearly it's called the Torah, but, um, if you don't put these things into action, if

23:44.360 --> 23:50.480
 you don't make them a part of your consciousness, maybe even on the subconsciousness, just by

23:50.480 --> 23:53.680
 through, through repetition, they will die.

23:53.680 --> 23:59.000
 They will become simply something that exists somewhere until you find it again.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.920
 And Carl Gotch used to say something, um, he would say that I don't invent moves.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.920
 I just rediscover them.

24:05.920 --> 24:13.960
 But yet Gotch and Billy Robinson also would understand, um, that you, if someone's not

24:13.960 --> 24:16.920
 carrying the torch, it'll go out.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.840
 Now that doesn't mean fire can't be rekindled.

24:18.840 --> 24:24.480
 It just means that it, that torch no longer is lighting the way on, on this knowledge.

24:24.480 --> 24:32.640
 And so it's, it's important to be an individual, even on, on an individual level to be a repository

24:32.640 --> 24:35.800
 for, for aspects of knowledge.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.320
 You mentioned Gotch.

24:37.320 --> 24:44.720
 You, uh, consider yourself a catch a wrestler.

24:44.720 --> 24:49.280
 So I've mentioned to you offline that I competed in a couple of catch wrestling tournaments.

24:49.280 --> 24:54.720
 Can we go Wikipedia level at the very basic, you're the exactly right person to ask what

24:54.720 --> 24:58.560
 is catch wrestling and what are its defining principles?

24:58.560 --> 25:07.120
 I would say the easiest way for us to talk about and give, uh, an overview of what catch

25:07.120 --> 25:14.040
 is in the simplest terms is think of collegiate wrestling with submissions.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.960
 That is essentially what catch is.

25:15.960 --> 25:20.320
 And it's not surprising because collegiate wrestling is actually derived from catch as

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
 catch can.

25:21.320 --> 25:28.200
 It's just that over time, certain aspects were, were, um, uh, removed from the competition

25:28.200 --> 25:32.880
 structure so that they became, uh, null elements, things that were discarded.

25:32.880 --> 25:40.440
 Uh, but it's funny that you can take a high level, um, amateur collegiate types and you

25:40.440 --> 25:45.280
 can show them a move and then add a little bit to it and go, Oh, well, hey, that was

25:45.280 --> 25:49.840
 just like what we already do here, but except, Oh, I didn't know you could take it all the

25:49.840 --> 25:54.280
 way to this point or, you know, things of that nature, especially when it comes to professional

25:54.280 --> 25:58.080
 wrestling, like, uh, teaching people like, no, that, that, I know you're just using this

25:58.080 --> 26:02.200
 for, uh, in a show, but this is actually a real move and here's how it really feels.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.120
 And so collegiate wrestling and wrestling in general for people who are not aware is basically

26:07.120 --> 26:11.720
 two people started on their feet and that's a score that they're trying to take each other

26:11.720 --> 26:15.960
 down and they have to, um, they score points along the way.

26:15.960 --> 26:20.400
 You can end matches by pinning them, for example, on their back.

26:20.400 --> 26:27.120
 I think one way to describe wrestling is, uh, it's very much about figuring out ways to

26:27.120 --> 26:34.920
 establish control and leverage in these kind of, uh, tie ups or there's different styles

26:34.920 --> 26:38.440
 where you can do more from a distance to where it's more about the timing and all that kind

26:38.440 --> 26:39.440
 of stuff.

26:39.440 --> 26:44.280
 Ultimately, it's an art of like both upper body and lower body and you could choose the

26:44.280 --> 26:46.440
 different puzzles that you solve there.

26:46.440 --> 26:51.520
 You could be attacking the head, the arms, you could be attacking the legs.

26:51.520 --> 26:56.560
 There's also a part of collegiate wrestling that's on the ground that has more, uh, what's

26:56.560 --> 26:58.800
 called like a referee's position, right?

26:58.800 --> 27:02.640
 The referee's position where you're on, uh, your hands and knees, basically.

27:02.640 --> 27:06.520
 And so, uh, do you, do you understand what that's supposed to simulate?

27:06.520 --> 27:08.600
 Why is that one of the standard positions?

27:08.600 --> 27:11.600
 It's one of the standard positions because one, it's one of the easiest ways to actually

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
 get up.

27:12.600 --> 27:16.080
 Um, but two, it's because you cannot be on your back.

27:16.080 --> 27:22.680
 If you're on your back, you're getting pinned and the back exposure or being pinned is pretty

27:22.680 --> 27:27.160
 much the universal wrestling, uh, thing.

27:27.160 --> 27:34.520
 Then taking the guy from their feet to the floor, uh, and to pinning them as you go from

27:34.520 --> 27:43.920
 like, was it, uh, Cornish wrestling, Turkish oil wrestling, Mongolian, Sumo, uh, Indian,

27:43.920 --> 27:46.600
 uh, well, they'll call it Pellewani.

27:46.600 --> 27:51.400
 It's also called Kushdi, um, Jiu Jitsu, Judo.

27:51.400 --> 27:56.920
 Um, so many of them is like, there's a, you saw him, though.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.480
 Even if it doesn't end the match, it's still like, what are the most important aspects

28:00.480 --> 28:04.920
 of the competition itself across every style.

28:04.920 --> 28:11.200
 And this is where submission, like catch wrestling or, uh, submission wrestling or Jiu Jitsu feels

28:11.200 --> 28:18.920
 different, which it seems like for most wrestling, for a lot of wrestling, the dominance is the,

28:18.920 --> 28:26.640
 is the goal, as opposed to submission, which I guess those are two are related, but dominating

28:26.640 --> 28:27.640
 the position.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.640
 So that's what pinning is.

28:28.640 --> 28:35.920
 It's almost like breaking your opponent, like breaking, uh, through all of their defenses

28:35.920 --> 28:39.320
 to where they're completely defenseless and you could do anything with them that you want.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.880
 Maybe that's, uh, what could be a definition of dominance?

28:41.880 --> 28:42.880
 I don't know.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.840
 And then, I mean, it sounds very much like a chain to a radiator.

28:46.840 --> 28:47.840
 Yeah.

28:47.840 --> 28:48.840
 Yeah.

28:48.840 --> 28:54.120
 This, uh, there's a threat that connects all winners, uh, but submission feels different.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.600
 Uh, I mean, it is actually different.

28:56.600 --> 29:00.800
 When you think about it across the landscape, I don't think radically different, but still

29:00.800 --> 29:06.720
 slightly different in that, um, if you think of wrestling as being derived from, from, from

29:06.720 --> 29:07.720
 combat, right?

29:07.720 --> 29:13.000
 So it, well, it is combat sports, but more, more lethal combat, getting somebody off their

29:13.000 --> 29:18.080
 feet and onto their back is about as lethal a place for the person on bottom to be in

29:18.080 --> 29:19.080
 general.

29:19.080 --> 29:24.680
 I mean, I don't, don't come at me with your talks about your fucking worm guards and blah

29:24.680 --> 29:27.040
 blah blah and whatever fit spider, barren.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.040
 Yeah.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.040
 Okay.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.040
 Get out of here with that.

29:30.040 --> 29:34.320
 This is, we're not talking about you in this highly, uh, regimented sporting environment.

29:34.320 --> 29:39.720
 We're talking about general, you know, all the body hair, none of the waxing human beings.

29:39.720 --> 29:44.040
 So, uh, getting someone on their back.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.040
 Okay.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.040
 They're hot.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.920
 You guys, you're trying to get up, you're getting hit with a rock or stabbed or what

29:48.920 --> 29:55.880
 have you set on fire, who knows, generally these conflicts are not just isolated to one

29:55.880 --> 29:56.880
 on one.

29:56.880 --> 30:01.560
 You, it's, if it's four on two, your, your, your, your buddy that was with you back to

30:01.560 --> 30:02.560
 back.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.560
 Now he's on his back.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.560
 What do you think?

30:04.560 --> 30:05.560
 And that was going to be one on one.

30:05.560 --> 30:06.560
 Well, three go on one.

30:06.560 --> 30:11.160
 So, and then you go, you elevate this to, to armored combat, right?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.440
 And it's boom, put them on the ground.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.440
 Oh crap.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.440
 It's hard to get up.

30:14.440 --> 30:18.360
 Well, while you're struggling to get up stab, you know, that's where jujitsu's, uh, concepts

30:18.360 --> 30:23.040
 come from with all their leveraging and off balancing is, Oh man, if I end up in this situation

30:23.040 --> 30:27.760
 and tight close quarters combat, yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives and what

30:27.760 --> 30:28.760
 have you.

30:28.760 --> 30:34.160
 But it's way easier if the first thing I can do is foot sweep you on your back and then

30:34.160 --> 30:36.440
 pull my knife and just go stick.

30:36.440 --> 30:42.840
 Is there a thread that connects all of these different arts from not just arts, but from

30:42.840 --> 30:49.440
 the very base violence of war, just like you said that there's no rules to the very regimented

30:49.440 --> 30:56.160
 IBJF jujitsu tournaments and just, you've kind of laid out some of it, but can you go

30:56.160 --> 31:02.800
 all the way to the, so when you, you start off with absolute skills in the sense of absolute

31:02.800 --> 31:07.400
 offense and defense in the taking or preserving of life, right?

31:07.400 --> 31:14.240
 Pull on at its, at its purest form of self defense and self preservation.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.560
 Okay.

31:15.560 --> 31:23.760
 And then you extrapolate part of that in that all animals train in violence.

31:23.760 --> 31:27.960
 All play usually degenerates into some sort of soft violence.

31:27.960 --> 31:33.280
 So be it cats, when they're kittens and puppies and all the, everything learns how to kill,

31:33.280 --> 31:41.080
 how to fight, not that, you know, just that, that dumb alpha meme stuff where the idea

31:41.080 --> 31:44.120
 is that, oh, by being alpha, that means you run around like basically just being a bully

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
 in a shit head.

31:45.120 --> 31:51.720
 No, actually alpha wolves spend very little time fighting because if you were actually

31:51.720 --> 31:54.160
 alpha, you don't get into fights.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.080
 There's no need to.

31:56.080 --> 32:00.800
 And if you are probably getting into any large amount of fights, it's probably cause you're

32:00.800 --> 32:07.240
 being shitty at being an alpha and now people are tired of you being in charge.

32:07.240 --> 32:12.080
 And yet in the animal world, and it would be the same for human beings at that, that,

32:12.080 --> 32:15.560
 that base beginning level of violence.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.160
 There's a big risk.

32:17.160 --> 32:22.760
 So I know that we live in this place with healthcare and where, or you might be in a

32:22.760 --> 32:24.680
 place with nationalized health, whatever, right?

32:24.680 --> 32:30.760
 There's, there's, there's band aids, there's, there's a penicillin, there's all that kind

32:30.760 --> 32:36.240
 of stuff, but that's not the normal way of things.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.240
 You know?

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
 Yeah.

32:38.240 --> 32:42.760
 There's a channel that just hurts me every time I used to follow and I had to unfollow

32:42.760 --> 32:47.040
 it because it was too painful for me as a human being called nature's metal on Instagram.

32:47.040 --> 32:51.080
 It was sobering and then it was like, this is too sober.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.920
 It is very sobering.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.800
 So in there, the risk is at its highest level.

32:55.800 --> 33:02.840
 Where the damage you take, the winner walks away, hurt.

33:02.840 --> 33:09.960
 Getting blamed when you need every aspect of your physical and athletic faculties to

33:09.960 --> 33:14.720
 survive because it isn't going to be the, this isn't the first and it's definitely not

33:14.720 --> 33:18.280
 going to be the last, especially if you're the slowest one.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.920
 You know, it's a, what is it, there's a lyric from a clutch song.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.640
 Don't go for the fat ones.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.160
 Don't go for the slow ones.

33:27.160 --> 33:35.320
 Man, but that, the universal truth of the way nature works is not cruel, it's not cruel

33:35.320 --> 33:36.320
 as just the way it is.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.320
 Yeah.

33:37.320 --> 33:42.000
 I mean, watch animals getting to fights on, on any of these sort of documentary stuff.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.720
 You'll see an intense short and then dispersal.

33:45.720 --> 33:50.120
 Like you'll see as soon as one feels like, uh, things have switched just enough to boom,

33:50.120 --> 33:51.880
 the bear or whatever it is takes off.

33:51.880 --> 33:55.480
 It's like, I'm not, I'm done with this because if you can get out of there with

33:55.480 --> 34:01.040
 just some scars and what have you, okay, you lose an eye, nah, it's not as good.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.640
 Uh, you really get hurt bad and get infected.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.640
 You're done.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.640
 Yeah.

34:05.640 --> 34:10.640
 You know, so it, there's a, a serious risk to be, um, that can come with these sort of

34:10.640 --> 34:11.640
 things.

34:11.640 --> 34:19.960
 Yet I believe that we are inherently born for at least aspects of, and use of violence.

34:19.960 --> 34:26.280
 And so at the end of the day, we need these things not just to not just survive each other,

34:26.280 --> 34:31.000
 but they're, they're a part of being able to hunt and other things.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.640
 But, uh, so violence is a part of human nature.

34:33.640 --> 34:36.120
 Violence is, is, is again, it's an absolute.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.280
 It is in every person.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.720
 It is a part of every interaction.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.680
 It is in part of every, every law, everything.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.040
 And I'm not, by the way, not an ANCAP.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.520
 So don't even, don't, don't hit your wagon to me on that one.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.520
 ANCAP.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.120
 An anchor, capitalists, yes.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.120
 Not an, not an ANCAP.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.240
 They have nice book, book shops.

34:54.240 --> 34:55.240
 Yeah, they do.

34:55.240 --> 34:59.640
 I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to, you know, sit here and, and talk ANCAPs, uh, although

34:59.640 --> 35:06.000
 I also used to get into the conversations with, uh, with, uh, an ANCOM, uh, anarcho

35:06.000 --> 35:08.440
 communist, uh, a good friend of mine.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.160
 And he would, he would bring up this stuff and I'm like, yeah, cool, man.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.880
 I'm down with anarchy.

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
 You ain't gonna like it.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.880
 What do you mean?

35:15.880 --> 35:18.480
 I go, cause I'm going to take, I'm going to gather all kinds of people.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.440
 I'm going to make this, I'm going to get the strongest together and I'm going to take

35:21.440 --> 35:22.440
 your shit.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.440
 Okay.

35:23.440 --> 35:30.040
 Can I actually, on that topic, I've, um, a friend of mine now, uh, a fellow Russian,

35:30.040 --> 35:33.040
 uh, Ukrainian, uh, Michael Malis.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.520
 Oh yeah, I'm familiar with Michael Malis.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.720
 I watched a little bit of your guys's, uh, conversation.

35:38.720 --> 35:45.040
 So this is really good to ask you because, uh, I like how he's in the white suit and

35:45.040 --> 35:46.800
 you're in the white and black.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.720
 But he, he lives in New York city.

35:49.720 --> 35:55.960
 He is, uh, espoused his ideas at anarchism and his idea, and this is different than,

35:55.960 --> 36:02.600
 um, sort of the iron rand, uh, set of ideas that there's a line between sort of capitalism

36:02.600 --> 36:06.760
 that's backed by the state and just pure anarchism.

36:06.760 --> 36:14.560
 And his idea that violence won't take over, uh, in an anarchism is one that feels to

36:14.560 --> 36:18.240
 me not grounded in reality.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.680
 I may be, I may be wrong.

36:19.680 --> 36:24.440
 So is there some, so, uh, the idea with pure capitalism is that,

36:24.440 --> 36:27.480
 You mean laissez faire completely deregulated?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.480
 Yeah.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.480
 Yeah.

36:29.480 --> 36:34.440
 Well, what it will agree, it'll end up in one, it'll end up in, if, if you're anti globalist,

36:34.440 --> 36:41.760
 it's going to be that it's going to be globalist 100% because it has no, pure capitalism has

36:41.760 --> 36:49.120
 no consideration for, uh, has no consideration for your, your native users or of any sort.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.120
 Like it doesn't.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.120
 It doesn't matter.

36:51.120 --> 36:55.080
 And, but the idea of governments is that the land, the little piece of land you're geographically

36:55.080 --> 37:00.120
 you're born on means you're going to stick to whatever founding documents created that

37:00.120 --> 37:01.120
 little land.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.200
 So anarchism is against that.

37:04.200 --> 37:09.240
 And the argument is you should be able to choose which ideas you live with.

37:09.240 --> 37:16.320
 And the concern there is nobody, uh, the, the geographical land, the governments that

37:16.320 --> 37:22.360
 organize on that land will not, do not need to protect you from the violence and my sense

37:22.360 --> 37:24.080
 is there does need to be an army.

37:24.080 --> 37:30.360
 There does need to be police that help however the form that police takes, but there needs

37:30.360 --> 37:38.680
 to be a more centralized, not completely centralized, but more centralized safety net of to protect

37:38.680 --> 37:39.680
 you from the violence.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.680
 Scale again, right?

37:40.680 --> 37:46.400
 So if you want to have your anarchist utopia, well, well, we won't call it utopia.

37:46.400 --> 37:55.800
 Your anarchist creation here at certain scale, I'm sure it's doable, you know, um, but as

37:55.800 --> 38:02.040
 it scales, as the scale increases, it's completely untenable and a state will emerge.

38:02.040 --> 38:07.400
 A state will always emerge because even people always think of states as like people rubbing

38:07.400 --> 38:11.480
 their hands and smoking cigars and back rooms and just out of nowhere coming around and

38:11.480 --> 38:14.560
 just like, Oh, we're going to create this big centralized thing and just so that we can

38:14.560 --> 38:17.880
 tell everybody what to do and we can be in charge.

38:17.880 --> 38:22.040
 I mean, I know that there are people like that that exists, that they would like to

38:22.040 --> 38:29.080
 do things of that nature and that they see, uh, the use of power as something to be used

38:29.080 --> 38:35.120
 more for their, their personal gains over first, which again, self interest in human

38:35.120 --> 38:36.120
 beings.

38:36.120 --> 38:44.560
 But, um, uh, eventually a state, people want a, they want something to go like, okay, who's

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
 taking care of this and who's taking care of that?

38:46.560 --> 38:53.320
 And who, and how do we create some sort of, uh, some sort of, uh, protocol for this?

38:53.320 --> 38:56.160
 Like, okay, well, when it's not Bob, when is it Susie?

38:56.160 --> 38:57.160
 When is it whatever?

38:57.160 --> 39:00.760
 I mean, like, how do we, you know, it's got to get done if we want this thing to become

39:00.760 --> 39:04.560
 bigger, if we want our, all of our plumbing to work right.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.880
 If we want, it's just, I'm sorry, a state's going to happen.

39:06.880 --> 39:12.800
 A state is also, when you think about it, it's supposed to have consideration to tribe.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.800
 Right.

39:13.800 --> 39:18.120
 So if people think that we're not tribes, well, you're not, you're not really thinking

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
 very deeply.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.880
 We're all tribes of a sort.

39:20.880 --> 39:26.640
 And, uh, everybody likes to use the word tribalism and this idea of, of this, uh, antagonistic

39:26.640 --> 39:27.640
 concept.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.560
 But, and while sure tribalism can be antagonistic, tribalism can also be, uh, a positive thing.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.360
 Or I could just say it just seems to be a natural thing.

39:36.360 --> 39:40.280
 People, you know, they create their, their groups of one sort or another.

39:40.280 --> 39:46.680
 And so when you have, well, when you think about where, when nation states really started

39:46.680 --> 39:52.480
 to become a thing, uh, and I don't mean even the more modern looking variants that we could

39:52.480 --> 39:57.400
 think back of and say the 19th century or something like that, even older than that.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.080
 I mean, you think the Assyrians didn't have a state of some sort?

40:00.080 --> 40:01.080
 Of course they did.

40:01.080 --> 40:06.240
 Um, they, how do you increase your, your, your, your empire if you don't actually have

40:06.240 --> 40:07.240
 a place to start from?

40:07.240 --> 40:08.240
 It has to be a ruler.

40:08.240 --> 40:13.800
 So you're saying like naturally when you start talking and thinking about scale of humans,

40:13.800 --> 40:21.640
 naturally states emerge and can we try to make an argument for anarchism, which is,

40:21.640 --> 40:25.880
 uh, okay, okay, okay.

40:25.880 --> 40:33.320
 So, uh, anarchy in a sense is an opposition to the unhelpful, unproductive, inefficient

40:33.320 --> 40:36.960
 bureaucracies that eventually the states lead to.

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
 Yes.

40:37.960 --> 40:38.960
 And that's what we can see.

40:38.960 --> 40:51.760
 I mean, I would say less anarchy, let more study James Burnham, you know, uh, or, well,

40:51.760 --> 40:55.560
 any, anybody that wants to talk about the, the managerial problem and the managerial.

40:55.560 --> 41:01.280
 So you, you have a sense, uh, I hope maybe let's think like what is the path forward

41:01.280 --> 41:04.320
 with the inefficient state?

41:04.320 --> 41:08.840
 Is it revolution or is it to work within the system to constantly improve it?

41:08.840 --> 41:10.240
 Man, I don't know that one.

41:10.240 --> 41:16.280
 I mean, my general sense, uh, and maybe this is the Nietzschean part of me is that, yeah,

41:16.280 --> 41:22.320
 it would take maybe not even just, maybe not even defining, uh, it specifically as a revolution.

41:22.320 --> 41:28.360
 Maybe it would just take just total calamity to, to get people to stop being shitty, to

41:28.360 --> 41:34.480
 not stop being a lesser version of themselves, to stop thinking more about, uh, things from

41:34.480 --> 41:40.320
 the paradigm that we exist in now where we're, we're giving so much value to stuff that isn't

41:40.320 --> 41:41.320
 really all that valuable.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.320
 Yeah.

41:42.320 --> 41:46.320
 You know, we're, we're so concerned about likes and I don't just mean like whether we

41:46.320 --> 41:51.120
 get them or not, but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off of our platform because

41:51.120 --> 41:54.840
 this is too destabilizing to people and it's like, because once you exceed Dunbar's number,

41:54.840 --> 42:03.320
 I think it's actually without having the right faculties, which would need to be developed

42:03.320 --> 42:09.480
 because this is dealing with, this is dealing with tech that brings things, ways of approaching

42:09.480 --> 42:18.000
 being that we are not naturally programmed to be able, uh, to handle appropriately.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.160
 So, and I think it's even, even, even more, it's even more detrimental to women than

42:23.160 --> 42:31.040
 men because I think, uh, women have a more natural proclivity towards, um, uh, group

42:31.040 --> 42:39.880
 association and, uh, and, and more group oriented thinking and patterning and now, and with

42:39.880 --> 42:49.760
 also coupled with seemingly more sensitivity towards, towards human, uh, states.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.840
 So I feel like women, like the, the classic idea is like, oh, you know, women are psychic

42:53.840 --> 42:55.400
 and I have a sixth sense and what have you.

42:55.400 --> 43:03.920
 And I think that's just a, uh, uh, a way of, uh, simplifying what I think is that women

43:03.920 --> 43:08.920
 may be more in tune with picking up on the unsaid, like they might be better at, at,

43:08.920 --> 43:15.280
 at seeing, um, uh, physical cues, uh, inflection and tone, like different, like they may be

43:15.280 --> 43:19.320
 far more sensitive to these things, which to me would make sense because dealing with

43:19.320 --> 43:24.640
 children that can't, uh, communicate, uh, so, so,

43:24.640 --> 43:25.640
 There's generally more.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.640
 Distinctively.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.640
 In all the full forms.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.640
 Right.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.640
 Now, okay.

43:29.640 --> 43:35.080
 Now, whether it be a woman or a man, but especially with even the social, uh, push on this concept

43:35.080 --> 43:39.240
 of empathy, which of course it gets to the point where it loses any meaning anymore.

43:39.240 --> 43:43.040
 Like people use the word empathy in absolutely incorrectly all the time and they don't even

43:43.040 --> 43:49.320
 understand what you're really asking of people, but let's just take it as, as we're using

43:49.320 --> 43:55.440
 empathy in the correct sense and you're taking on the emotional content of the thing itself.

43:55.440 --> 44:00.080
 Now you open that up to thousands of people, maybe hundreds of thousands of people all

44:00.080 --> 44:04.000
 across the world that you will never meet, that you will never know that you're not even

44:04.000 --> 44:08.760
 getting an actual true representation most of the time of who these people are.

44:08.760 --> 44:16.440
 You're meeting persona and some of these personas are even deliberately created to illicit

44:16.440 --> 44:20.280
 a response inauthentically.

44:20.280 --> 44:24.480
 Are you referring to bots or, uh, could be bots or actual people.

44:24.480 --> 44:29.040
 Bots are one thing, but I mean, there are literal people out there that will create something,

44:29.040 --> 44:33.280
 create, uh, go fund these for, for tragedies that never didn't really, or events that didn't

44:33.280 --> 44:36.080
 happen or any number of things.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.080
 Okay.

44:37.080 --> 44:40.880
 I mean, burn their own house down and then say, you know, we were attacked and then it

44:40.880 --> 44:41.880
 comes down.

44:41.880 --> 44:46.040
 Oh, you did it to yourself because you wanted money and empathy and this, that and you wanted

44:46.040 --> 44:52.240
 all this, this emotional wealth, let's say this emotional, uh, coin as well as actual

44:52.240 --> 44:53.240
 if possible.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.440
 You wanted to leverage it in some way.

44:55.440 --> 45:00.680
 That's not the majority of people, but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking,

45:00.680 --> 45:07.880
 well, if I post this photo, um, and I put this little blurb in there, I bet I can get

45:07.880 --> 45:10.680
 this much cash out of it in this sense.

45:10.680 --> 45:15.200
 And I'm not even, and this isn't just a reference to like butt pics and stuff like that because

45:15.200 --> 45:21.760
 clearly obviously people understand that, that, uh, our inborn, uh, sexual nature is

45:21.760 --> 45:22.760
 easy to manipulate.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.600
 I mean, that's pretty, pretty obvious.

45:25.600 --> 45:32.280
 You're saying this kind of new medium of communication on social media is, uh, is unnatural.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.280
 And it preys on us.

45:33.280 --> 45:40.720
 And so as you, you want this, you know, you look at, you look at an anarchist kind of

45:40.720 --> 45:41.720
 mindset, right?

45:41.720 --> 45:48.800
 And so you're just like, there's no, there, there is no overarching state to, to create

45:48.800 --> 45:52.080
 any kind of, uh, structure, right?

45:52.080 --> 45:59.600
 And so if you have that unfettered capitalism aspect with it, and before I say anything particularly

45:59.600 --> 46:05.320
 damning about unfettered capitalism, uh, I'm a massive capitalist because I view capitalism

46:05.320 --> 46:10.560
 essentially as what it boils down to, these arguments of people too, they, they start

46:10.560 --> 46:14.040
 giving me all these extra definitions about capitalism like, no, no, this is obviously

46:14.040 --> 46:18.080
 some sort of theory you're taking from other ship, but that doesn't describe capitalism.

46:18.080 --> 46:26.680
 Is the ability for us to create whatever we want or, you know, create our thoughts, ideas,

46:26.680 --> 46:33.240
 physical things and trade them freely amongst each other in ways that we find, um, acceptable.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.240
 Right.

46:34.240 --> 46:39.200
 You know, I'm not even using the word fair because I might think it's fair to me.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.760
 You might think, huh, well, I mean, that was actually, I think he, what he thought was

46:42.760 --> 46:47.160
 unfair to him and it's more fair to me than someone a third observer goes, oh man, you

46:47.160 --> 46:49.280
 should have, you should not have paid that for that.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
 You should have paid this.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.280
 And it's like, well, you know what?

46:51.280 --> 46:56.320
 It works for me without sufficiently acceptable that you, you both agree to the transaction.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.320
 Correct.

46:57.320 --> 47:02.200
 And, uh, you know, but, but also at the, at the root of that is freedom, right?

47:02.200 --> 47:06.400
 And as far as I can tell, I've been banging this around in my head.

47:06.400 --> 47:12.360
 It's like for every one unit of freedom, you need two units of accountability.

47:12.360 --> 47:20.200
 And if you don't have that, what you end up with is human self interest.

47:20.200 --> 47:25.040
 We're not even going to get into evil human self interest, sabotaging other things, even

47:25.040 --> 47:26.920
 not in a sense to be malicious.

47:26.920 --> 47:27.920
 Okay.

47:27.920 --> 47:32.360
 So in terms of, uh, let's, let's put this as mathematically speaking, I love this.

47:32.360 --> 47:37.920
 So anarchism is more like two units of freedom and one unit of accountability or maybe zero

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
 units of accountability.

47:38.920 --> 47:39.920
 Possibly.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.280
 I mean, the anarchists tend to think like, no, everyone will be accountable.

47:42.280 --> 47:46.160
 It's like the fuck they will, when did you see this happen in real life?

47:46.160 --> 47:49.680
 You know, I mean, people aren't even accountable in their revolutions at the time.

47:49.680 --> 47:55.520
 So, uh, you aren't looking at the way people really are.

47:55.520 --> 47:59.680
 It's like Marx is like, yeah, the people are like this, they're like that, look at how

47:59.680 --> 48:00.680
 capitalism does it.

48:00.680 --> 48:06.840
 I mean, he, of course, assigns a lot of really ridiculous economic principles and practice.

48:06.840 --> 48:12.240
 And also assumes that everybody, you know, who makes any profit from anything is somehow

48:12.240 --> 48:16.040
 stealing it and, you know, really assigns a negative moral aspect to them.

48:16.040 --> 48:19.720
 And then it's like, oh yeah, but eventually communism will happen to every, no one will

48:19.720 --> 48:20.720
 act that way anymore.

48:20.720 --> 48:21.720
 And you're like, whoa, hold on.

48:21.720 --> 48:27.280
 You just said that people are all, are you saying it's all due to capitalism or it's,

48:27.280 --> 48:28.280
 is it innate?

48:28.280 --> 48:35.320
 It's just, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of, and it's like, hey, look at you.

48:35.320 --> 48:43.000
 You're like a notorious, like anti Semitic, angry, like, uh, just absolute curmudgeon

48:43.000 --> 48:46.880
 of a human being who seems to be really not all that fun to be around.

48:46.880 --> 48:47.880
 Yeah.

48:47.880 --> 48:48.880
 Yeah.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.800
 And then it's just like, so you have to think like, if, if there was one billion Marx's in

48:51.800 --> 48:53.600
 the world, how would they behave?

48:53.600 --> 48:58.760
 It would be absolutely, they would hate each other so bad.

48:58.760 --> 49:03.200
 And you know, this isn't for me to even poison the well on Marx is like, oh, his personality

49:03.200 --> 49:04.200
 sucks.

49:04.200 --> 49:10.360
 That doesn't mean they can't make, I don't know that it's never, what, you know, somebody

49:10.360 --> 49:12.200
 argues he's just a, he's a loner.

49:12.200 --> 49:15.080
 I mean, I don't know that his personality sucked at all.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.280
 Let me walk that back and that he was human.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.680
 Say his personality sucked.

49:19.680 --> 49:23.760
 He was sometimes contradictory, irrational.

49:23.760 --> 49:31.560
 Sometimes he was, uh, quite sexist despite the emails I've gotten that, uh, that, that's

49:31.560 --> 49:42.080
 people was written to me that Nietzsche has been unfairly labeled as sexist in his discussion

49:42.080 --> 49:43.080
 about women.

49:43.080 --> 49:50.520
 I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of documents where he's just like, he's just the bitter

49:50.520 --> 49:51.520
 guy.

49:51.520 --> 49:57.680
 I will agree with you and Marx is as bitter as they come to, but, um, you know, a bitterness

49:57.680 --> 50:04.400
 in and of itself doesn't make like what, why I, I hate Marxism comes from, you know, the,

50:04.400 --> 50:08.320
 the whole, the entirety of the thing.

50:08.320 --> 50:15.320
 And but the dismissal of human nature, but I'm not going to say that Marxism or practic

50:15.320 --> 50:20.680
 man, you can find any forbidden book and it could have something good in it.

50:20.680 --> 50:21.680
 As colonels, a good idea.

50:21.680 --> 50:22.680
 Yeah.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.960
 And like at the end of the day, you know, Marx is a human being.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.960
 It's got a nice beard.

50:26.960 --> 50:27.960
 He does.

50:27.960 --> 50:28.960
 He had a hell of a beard.

50:28.960 --> 50:29.960
 You know, a decent portrait.

50:29.960 --> 50:33.560
 I mean, he looks like the kind of guy like, I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley,

50:33.560 --> 50:39.320
 but thankfully I don't think he was much of a fighter, but in any case, I mean, not the

50:39.320 --> 50:45.040
 anarchists are, are, are, are, they're more hot for like, uh, Max Sterner.

50:45.040 --> 50:49.800
 People like to think that, uh, Nietzsche, uh, borrowed a lot from Sterner and my argument

50:49.800 --> 50:56.720
 is one, you don't have any real evidence for that and two, bullshit, you know, I mean,

50:56.720 --> 51:04.080
 the, the fact that they have some overlapping thoughts doesn't make it, uh, lifted.

51:04.080 --> 51:08.560
 Not to mention, go read a lot more philosophy and see how there's so many different things.

51:08.560 --> 51:15.160
 Oh, this guy said it in, uh, 1722, well, and then this guy says that again in 1922, does

51:15.160 --> 51:16.680
 that mean he read the other guy's stuff?

51:16.680 --> 51:17.680
 Not necessarily.

51:17.680 --> 51:23.200
 I mean, he's working from the same type of human, uh, physiological construct as anybody

51:23.200 --> 51:24.200
 else.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.560
 Like, of course it's possible that this guy could think the same thing.

51:26.560 --> 51:29.280
 We, we think a lot of the same things to be perfectly honest.

51:29.280 --> 51:34.600
 I mean, reading the Haggakure going back to philosophy books, this was really impactful

51:34.600 --> 51:39.440
 on me as a younger adult because here's a book written in the 19th century about someone

51:39.440 --> 51:45.760
 who lived through, uh, the 19th and 18th century at times as a samurai, now a monk, and his

51:45.760 --> 51:52.080
 objections to society at the time, the same objections one was having to society as I

51:52.080 --> 51:59.800
 was reading it, like the same human behaviors, the same, uh, uh, impetus for action that he

51:59.800 --> 52:06.720
 found, uh, a problem, like, well, that's the same, that's the same shit now.

52:06.720 --> 52:11.920
 Like we're not, and this was the thing and then I'm reading more religion, I go, oh,

52:11.920 --> 52:16.160
 we're no different than anyone who wrote the Torah or older.

52:16.160 --> 52:21.360
 We are the same thing with the same problems, with the same, uh, psychological issues, the

52:21.360 --> 52:26.320
 same human behaviors, like these things are not different and we haven't changed.

52:26.320 --> 52:30.440
 Growing set of tools, though, to, to kill each other with or communicate together and

52:30.440 --> 52:33.560
 all that kind of stuff, but underlying it, there's a human nature.

52:33.560 --> 52:35.560
 Well, we're also trying to understand that human nature.

52:35.560 --> 52:39.680
 I think we've, just like you said, learning how to fish, acquire more and more knowledge

52:39.680 --> 52:45.520
 about that human nature, uh, but it's been a very slow journey, slower than people realize

52:45.520 --> 52:49.120
 in terms of understanding, uh, human nature.

52:49.120 --> 52:56.680
 Let me ask in terms of egoism, to be curious, uh, uh, to, to get your sense about Ayn Rand

52:56.680 --> 53:02.600
 and, um, her whole idea of virtue of like selfishness and her, because you mentioned

53:02.600 --> 53:06.560
 that everybody has a kernel of truth.

53:06.560 --> 53:10.720
 There, there's potential for a kernel of truth to be discovered in any, in anything.

53:10.720 --> 53:18.560
 For example, I've been recently reading Mein Kampf, uh, you know what, that's the thing.

53:18.560 --> 53:24.880
 And there's something in, there's probably things in Mein Kampf that are not the surface

53:24.880 --> 53:25.960
 level read.

53:25.960 --> 53:32.200
 If you get all hung up on, on all, probably all his crap about, uh, you know, his anger,

53:32.200 --> 53:35.560
 anger at Jews and this and that, all this crap, it's like, okay, yeah, that, that's

53:35.560 --> 53:37.960
 right on the surface.

53:37.960 --> 53:42.840
 Try to get below that, try to see, you know, how is he, how is he creating the Jews as

53:42.840 --> 53:43.840
 a cope somehow?

53:43.840 --> 53:46.960
 Like how is he using, why, why are they his, his scapegoat?

53:46.960 --> 53:52.400
 And I mean scapegoat in the, so René Girard's, uh, concept of the scapegoat, I mean, in

53:52.400 --> 53:58.160
 that sense, whereas, uh, you know, Hitler uses, he wants to make the, the Jews, uh,

53:58.160 --> 54:00.160
 the scapegoat for World War one.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.160
 Yeah.

54:01.160 --> 54:05.760
 I mean, for me, the starting point, similar with Ayn Rand is, uh, like Mein Kampf is not

54:05.760 --> 54:11.560
 a good place to search, not just because Hitler's evil, but it's just not full of ideas.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.560
 No, it is not.

54:13.560 --> 54:16.200
 It has its significance due to a lot of.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
 Yeah.

54:17.200 --> 54:24.360
 But the starting point for me with Hitler is like to acknowledge that he's human and

54:24.360 --> 54:28.480
 to at least consider the possibility that any one of us could have been Hitler.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.480
 So like that.

54:29.480 --> 54:31.800
 That's a Peterson kind of concept.

54:31.800 --> 54:37.800
 Also, um, Jonathan Haight has a thing about, uh, the difference between hate and disgust

54:37.800 --> 54:39.200
 mechanisms and things like that.

54:39.200 --> 54:45.160
 And so he used, he goes into the, looking at, uh, Hitler and his, through his, his diary

54:45.160 --> 54:49.560
 entries and journals and stuff like that to look, uh, and see it more as the, the disgust

54:49.560 --> 54:55.640
 mechanism, then also try and see, like if there's any evolutionary biological, uh, attachment

54:55.640 --> 54:56.640
 to this, whatever.

54:56.640 --> 54:57.960
 I mean, you're right.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.760
 He is a human being.

54:59.760 --> 55:02.360
 Any of us are, we're all human beings.

55:02.360 --> 55:12.360
 It's not that it's probably jarring for people to think, but we're, we're all, I guess, supposedly

55:12.360 --> 55:17.800
 potentially capable of just being in, and all these evil people in the world think they're

55:17.800 --> 55:22.920
 doing it for the sake of good, which makes them the most dangerous.

55:22.920 --> 55:26.520
 And there's some, there's differences in levels of insane.

55:26.520 --> 55:29.280
 I think Hitler was way more insane than Stalin.

55:29.280 --> 55:33.720
 I think Stalin legitimately thought he was being, doing good.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.160
 I would say that's probably true.

55:36.160 --> 55:39.480
 Stalin, it was just outright brutal.

55:39.480 --> 55:40.480
 Yeah.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.360
 He had, he had his five year plan.

55:42.360 --> 55:44.080
 He had a look at the things.

55:44.080 --> 55:46.720
 He just had a much lower value for human life.

55:46.720 --> 55:47.720
 Yes.

55:47.720 --> 55:53.640
 And so he was willing to take, make decisions about what he actually, as a, as a good executive

55:53.640 --> 55:59.480
 of, which he was of managing different, uh, bureaucracies and so on.

55:59.480 --> 56:07.000
 He was willing to make decisions that resulted in mass human suffering where Hitler was,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.920
 it seems like to me, what much moodier.

56:09.920 --> 56:12.520
 So allowed emotions and moods to make decisions.

56:12.520 --> 56:18.000
 I think we also have to consider, um, the different trajectories and how, where and

56:18.000 --> 56:19.640
 when they were making their decisions.

56:19.640 --> 56:24.440
 And I mean, not by time specifically, but you know, Hitler engaged into this, this conflict

56:24.440 --> 56:27.520
 across multiple continents.

56:27.520 --> 56:36.520
 And then that everything that comes with basically fighting the whole world, Stalin had his conflict

56:36.520 --> 56:41.780
 and then he really mostly compartmentalized the rest of it.

56:41.780 --> 56:46.520
 So he was dealing with his own internal instead of dealing with the internal and the external.

56:46.520 --> 56:50.600
 So if Stalin was put under a World War scenario, I don't know, maybe he would have eventually

56:50.600 --> 56:51.840
 lost his marbles too.

56:51.840 --> 56:52.840
 Yeah.

56:52.840 --> 56:55.040
 I'm not, I'm not sure that, uh, that's, you're right there.

56:55.040 --> 56:58.760
 The hunger for power was more internalized for Stalin.

56:58.760 --> 57:02.480
 He wanted to control the land that already existed as opposed to wanting to colonize

57:02.480 --> 57:03.480
 other land.

57:03.480 --> 57:12.840
 As nationalistic as Hitler, but, uh, and was as capable and willing for, uh, violent conflict

57:12.840 --> 57:16.840
 as Hitler for the names of the state.

57:16.840 --> 57:18.120
 Yeah.

57:18.120 --> 57:27.280
 But he, he, he centered and internalized prior to then externalizing and moving outwards.

57:27.280 --> 57:31.880
 Whereas even maybe prior to him, there was an interest to continually push communism

57:31.880 --> 57:38.560
 in an aggressive sense, following on the momentum from the, the 1918 revolution.

57:38.560 --> 57:45.600
 And that, the halting of that, uh, through various aspects, I guess, uh, in Germany,

57:45.600 --> 57:49.600
 part of that was, uh, the national socialist, like they, they came up and then they, they

57:49.600 --> 57:51.120
 were the other ones to fight the communists.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.640
 And so you had the two totalitarians going after it.

57:53.640 --> 58:01.080
 Um, but then in the rest of the world that was not dealing with, um, totalitarian aspects,

58:01.080 --> 58:05.000
 it was just, it wasn't going to stick, especially in the West and other places.

58:05.000 --> 58:11.760
 But Stalin, just, you know, casually thinking it seemed like Stalin decided to go, all right,

58:11.760 --> 58:15.200
 well, we're not going to go just start launching right into more conflicts here.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.440
 We're going to, these dudes are going down.

58:17.440 --> 58:21.080
 So that's cool for us because they hate us and we hate them.

58:21.080 --> 58:25.520
 Um, but now we're going to, we're going to focus internally and then we're going to

58:25.520 --> 58:30.400
 work on growing at a slower rate and picking our battles a bit more specifically.

58:30.400 --> 58:34.840
 And of course there's, you know, you can get to the, even this is after Stalin, but yeah,

58:34.840 --> 58:39.680
 you got the Besmanov type stuff talking about subversion in, in cultural aspects.

58:39.680 --> 58:40.680
 Yeah.

58:40.680 --> 58:44.440
 I mean, there's, there's fascinating dynamics of propaganda throughout the whole period

58:44.440 --> 58:46.760
 that that's, that's a whole another kernel.

58:46.760 --> 58:47.760
 Yeah.

58:47.760 --> 58:50.280
 Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?

58:50.280 --> 58:57.320
 One of the things that's kind of fascinating to look at is how many nations, both journalists

58:57.320 --> 59:03.560
 and nations wanted almost crave to take Hitler's word that he wanted peace until it was too

59:03.560 --> 59:04.560
 late.

59:04.560 --> 59:07.720
 They almost wanted to be delude themselves.

59:07.720 --> 59:13.840
 I mean, the same is true with the Stalin, uh, people want to take Stalin as word for

59:13.840 --> 59:14.840
 it.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.840
 They still delude themselves.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
 Yeah.

59:16.840 --> 59:20.480
 That way we will dilute, we, we will dilute ourselves over any number of things and until

59:20.480 --> 59:26.080
 even after the fact where the history just says, Hey, fuckface, you know, you, you cannot

59:26.080 --> 59:30.520
 supplement your pseudo reality onto actual reality here.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.840
 But yet we deal with people in pseudo realities constantly.

59:33.840 --> 59:39.920
 I mean, it, we will always find a way to, to change reality, to suit our needs.

59:39.920 --> 59:44.240
 Well, the nature of truth now, there's now multiple actual truth is kind of fascinating.

59:44.240 --> 59:49.520
 There's multiple versions of history that people are telling, you know, the, the version,

59:49.520 --> 59:54.720
 the version of the, the, the great patriotic war in Russia, the world war two in Russia

59:54.720 --> 1:00:00.200
 is very different today under Putin than the version that we're learning on the, in the

1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:04.120
 United States and then different than the version in Europe in the United States.

1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:08.920
 Uh, the, the hero of the war is the United States in Europe.

1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:13.080
 There's a much more sad and solemn story of suffering and so on.

1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:14.080
 Sure.

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:16.520
 And in Russia, it's the great patriotic war.

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:17.520
 Yeah.

1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:24.680
 It was, it was a unifier of a sense and it, I mean, yeah, I mean, you, you can't argue

1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:33.080
 that war and conflict that, and, or I just even, um, reducing that to stressors, agitation,

1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:36.160
 suffering, doesn't create human motivation.

1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:39.800
 You know, we started this off, you brought up, uh, Frankel, I'm like, yeah, Frankel's

1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:43.760
 dope answers for meaning, uh, has those great.

1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:50.380
 And, and I talked to you about how I started to think like, man, do the ability for human

1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:56.520
 beings to, to, to live and, or potentially flourish in the worst environments you can

1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:00.080
 think of is pretty incredible in and of itself.

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:09.240
 And that it's a crazy thought to think that without Frankel and Maslow ending up in concentration

1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:16.400
 camps, do they write some of the most important books on philosophy in the 20th century?

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:20.840
 And that's insane on a lot of different levels, but, um,

1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:21.840
 Yeah.

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:22.840
 Suffering is a creative force.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:25.080
 I mean, I don't, do you think we'll always have war?

1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:26.080
 Yes.

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:28.960
 We will always have war in some form or another.

1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:36.200
 We, we need quote unquote air quotes for those who's listening, uh, war to survive.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:37.440
 We need war to flourish.

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.440
 We need at least.

1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:41.040
 Can you explain the quote, the air quotes around the war?

1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:45.040
 Well, because, uh, take, take, take, take, take the

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:46.560
 Do you see wars as violence?

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:47.560
 No.

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:48.560
 Wars are not violence.

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:52.680
 So like, so no air quotes because, uh, while, you know, us getting on the mat or just getting

1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:57.120
 on these hardwood floors and wrestling around is not literal war.

1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:02.320
 It's war of a sorts, you know, we're, you know, it is, it is a deluded form of war.

1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:04.000
 American football is a deluded form of war.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.960
 All this, these are deluded forms of war.

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:08.240
 Tennis is a deluded form of war.

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:14.800
 Um, and I think the, one of the best explanations I ever got from this and another person very

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:20.680
 uh, impactful on my life and outlook and thinking about things is Cormac McCarthy.

1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:26.920
 And so in blood meridian, there's this fantastic speech about war given by the judge, which

1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:30.600
 there's a ton of fantastic speeches on things given by the judge.

1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:31.600
 Yeah.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:34.360
 All that exists in creation without my knowledge does so without my consent.

1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:35.360
 Okay.

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:37.320
 That's pretty heavy.

1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:38.320
 That's that's hard.

1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:39.320
 Can you break that up?

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:40.400
 Can you say that again?

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:45.840
 All things that exist in creation, all things that exist without my knowledge do so without

1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:49.640
 my consent.

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:50.640
 What does that mean?

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:55.760
 Well, I think from the judge's perspective, it's like, well, I didn't consent to, to that

1:02:55.760 --> 1:03:01.880
 bird or that dog or this building or all this, like all of this, you know, I didn't create

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:02.880
 it.

1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:03.880
 So it's done so without my consent.

1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:09.520
 And if it's up to my consent, well, I'll design it how I want to is another similar

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:17.520
 look into how the judges in that book is, he would study everything everywhere he went.

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:25.600
 And so he's collected this group of Neriduels from all over to go on these hunts against

1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:32.920
 certain tribes in the Southwest and getting paid by the US government, the Mexican government.

1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:41.600
 So he's on these Indian hunts and yet they're going to all these different places and they

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:45.200
 would stay the night in a cave somewhere and he would find cave paintings, he would write

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:47.880
 them all down or he would find old pieces.

1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:53.800
 There's an example of him, the narrator explaining how watching the judge and how he drawing

1:03:53.800 --> 1:04:00.800
 everything's got this notebook just full of things, drawings and writings and how he found

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:04.680
 like a piece of armor from a conquistador or something way back in the day, a Spanish

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:05.680
 armor.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:09.600
 He draws it into his book and then crushes it.

1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:16.720
 So the reason we'll always have war in the society is because there's this struggle amongst

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:19.240
 people that want to be the designers.

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:26.520
 There's that, but I'm just saying that he's got this whole quote on war, like war is play.

1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:30.760
 War is a game and the difference is that what's at stake.

1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:36.160
 So all things are a game of some sort and you're putting up for it or what you're willing

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:40.560
 to put up for it determines whether or not you're going to participate or not.

1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:47.800
 And all aspects of any game is war and it's just what is at stake?

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.000
 If it's your life, it's a different story.

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.400
 If it's just a coin, it's another thing.

1:04:52.400 --> 1:05:01.800
 Another nice way to put it is humans play a game in this pursuit of creating whatever

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:07.720
 the hell the reason is that we keep creating cooler and cooler things, that it seems to

1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:11.400
 be the result of a game that would naturally play, would naturally crave.

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:12.400
 I don't know.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:16.960
 I mean, that's been the struggle of philosophy is to understand what is the underlying force

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:17.960
 of all that?

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:19.480
 Is it the will to power?

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.240
 I think will to power is a really great way of describing it.

1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:25.200
 Do you want to be the winner of the game?

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:28.880
 No, not just, no, I don't look at will to power as being the winner of the game.

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:33.640
 Well, I mean, if we're going to get philosophical, yes, you want to be the winner of the game.

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:36.520
 What does winning the game define how you win?

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:38.760
 Everybody's going to define that win differently.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:42.480
 You could define the win in the most base level like, oh, I got all the things.

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:48.800
 Well, if you got all those things without the needing component of fulfillment, then

1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:51.360
 you're going to be a very unhappy person with a whole lot of things.

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:56.720
 But there's a self referential aspect to where, to me, the winner of the game is defined by

1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:58.680
 the people playing the game.

1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:06.160
 So if I'm playing a game, I want to win in the sense that most of the other people who

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:11.400
 are playing the game will say, yeah, that guy won by our collective definition.

1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:14.720
 If I just come up, listen, I'm sort of, if I come up with my...

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:17.240
 That's a lot of weight on the external on you.

1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:18.240
 Right.

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:21.240
 That's how games seem to work.

1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:22.240
 Somewhat.

1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:27.760
 So I'm already a winner in my life by defining my own definition of success.

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:32.120
 I'm basically the best person in the world at doing me.

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:33.120
 At being Lex.

1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:34.120
 Yeah.

1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:35.880
 So like, and I'm really happy with that.

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:36.880
 That's the source of...

1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:38.640
 Well, I mean, think about it.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:40.560
 Games are also iterated, right?

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:46.200
 So you start off with your game and then your game with your immediate and then the game

1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:49.160
 further than that and the game further than that, and then the game today and the game

1:06:49.160 --> 1:06:50.960
 tomorrow and the game next week.

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.800
 And so it never ends.

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:56.320
 And if you try to keep thinking about it that way, no wonder people go crazy.

1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:59.080
 But we don't want to think about things that way.

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:01.520
 We don't want to think about being towards death.

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:06.680
 We don't want to think about whether or not I'm going anywhere after this other than

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:08.760
 in the ground or what have you.

1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:09.760
 You know...

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.080
 So all of these games are a sense of distraction.

1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:13.080
 This is where we...

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:14.080
 Kind of.

1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:18.760
 The violence is that we need to let this out.

1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:21.960
 And so it is of our...

1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:25.360
 Kids need to wrestle and play, just like animals need to wrestle and play.

1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:27.520
 We need to have forms of competition.

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:33.400
 We need to have ways to test ourselves to create when...

1:07:33.400 --> 1:07:34.400
 What is it?

1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:37.040
 When at peace, a man of war makes war with himself.

1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:41.680
 And so we need to be able to competently go at war with ourselves and go at war with

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:46.480
 our neighbor and go at war with our neighbor's neighbor in a way that is repeatable at the

1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:47.880
 very least.

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:54.240
 So one way of saying that there will always be war, I mean, that's my hopeful view is

1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:58.880
 that most of the war conducted in the future will be, like you said, the man must go to

1:07:58.880 --> 1:07:59.880
 war with himself.

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:01.680
 That would be great.

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:08.040
 That's what, to me, love is, is like focusing on yourself and your own improvement and your

1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:16.440
 own creativity and towards others feeling sort of emphasizing cooperative behavior and

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:18.240
 compassion and empathy.

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:20.160
 It would be great.

1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:23.920
 But I mean, you can have, well, I'll put it to you this way.

1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:33.560
 If you have a whole community of Randians and a whole community of Ancoms and they could

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:40.720
 all like, I don't know, a toast of London on Netflix and they love Netflix and they

1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:46.920
 love the internet and they love picking apart Moncombe with you.

1:08:46.920 --> 1:08:51.600
 They love like they like all these things, even the esoteric that they can, they can

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:52.600
 they can get on with.

1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:59.160
 But at the fundamental root, they cannot help but go to war because they are literally oil

1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:00.160
 and water.

1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:06.240
 They're the perceived, but they would, the very labels they assign to themselves would

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:07.240
 need to dissipate.

1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:08.240
 Well, true.

1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:12.200
 Well, then you would have to stop being whatever it is that you took on as your ideological

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.520
 or religious point, right?

1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:15.520
 Yeah.

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:24.520
 I mean, there's some days I'm an Ancom, some days I'm an Ancapsons, whatever the Anarchy

1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:25.520
 Capital.

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:30.280
 It depends on the hour, the minute of the day, you constantly changing moods and embracing

1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:34.520
 that flow, the change of opinions, of ideas.

1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:38.080
 As there's some days where I'm actually cognizant of the fact because I've been not getting

1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:44.320
 my sleep and after I get some sleep, I see I'm so much more optimistic about the world.

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:48.040
 The less and less sleep I get, the more sad and cynical I get.

1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:49.040
 I can see that.

1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:50.040
 Up and down.

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:54.240
 I don't even let my, well, okay, I try not to let.

1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:56.480
 In most days, it's never a problem.

1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:05.400
 Any sort of, what are the kids call it now, black pilled way of thinking, be my over,

1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:07.720
 the umbrella, which I hang under.

1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:14.560
 We actually, to drag us back, can we talk about Carl Gotch and Cat Tristler?

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:17.760
 Because I do want to make sure I touch it.

1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:20.440
 I mean, who were?

1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:22.160
 Carl Gotch is.

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.560
 Is he the greatest Cat Tristler?

1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:26.800
 I don't know if he was the greatest Cat Tristler ever.

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:35.520
 I don't, I don't, I mean, he's one of them for a myriad of, Carl Gotch, Billy Robinson,

1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:40.120
 Gotch and Robinson's trainer, Billy Riley.

1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:42.000
 So who are these figures and what did they bring to him?

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.680
 Mitsuo Maeda, he's one of the greatest Cat Tristlers ever because he's responsible for

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:48.600
 Brazilian Jiu Jitsu along with Gustavo Gracie.

1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:49.600
 Okay.

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:52.000
 There's so much of things I'd like to say here.

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.840
 One of the things that Cat Tristler seemed to espouse as a principle is that of violence.

1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:04.760
 I just, the tournaments I competed at, the unfortunate thing, and we'll probably hopefully

1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:09.840
 talk about it a little bit, they weren't disorganized and the level of competition was pretty low

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:11.240
 where people really sucked.

1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:12.240
 Pretty typical.

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:13.240
 Is that typical?

1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:14.240
 Okay.

1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:21.760
 Well, it's, I mean, think about local run of the mill, Jiu Jitsu tournament versus IBJJF.

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:22.760
 Yeah.

1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:24.800
 Created, you know, a vast difference.

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:31.920
 So I, you know, but there is a, to me as a human being that like intellectually, philosophically,

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.360
 it was more interesting to go to Cat Tristler tournament.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:40.160
 It seemed more real and honest because of the way they communicated about violence and

1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:41.160
 aggression.

1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:42.160
 I love that.

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:44.120
 So it is, it is often more honest.

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:45.120
 I think that as...

1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:46.120
 Who is that from?

1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:47.120
 Is that originated from Gotch?

1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:48.120
 That Billy Robinson said by Maeda?

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:58.000
 Well, I mean, it originates from all wrestling in that even Wade Chalice, not a, not a classically

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:03.520
 considered catch wrestler, yet the reason why he has the world record for most amount

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:10.160
 of world champions pinned or the record for pins in the NCAA is because, well, of course

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:13.600
 the idea is to put you on your back and pin you, but there's no way you're going to let

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:20.200
 me do that. So how do I make it so that you want me to pin you?

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:23.120
 Well, it's by you put them in excruciating pain.

1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:27.440
 So at the end of the day, you're both there.

1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:29.080
 You both want to win.

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:31.920
 Neither one wants to allow anything to the other.

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:36.520
 So how do I, how do I get you to lose to me?

1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:40.320
 I make it so unbearable for you that you decide losing is better than staying.

1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:45.160
 So those are two, those two are so fascinating because so coming from Russia, I don't know

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:52.560
 if that's where I got it or if it's just my own predisposition is I always loved the,

1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:56.040
 there's two ways to get you to want to pin yourself.

1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:01.120
 One is to making it so painful not to pin yourself that you pin yourself or whatever.

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:07.160
 And the other is it's sort of like Bruce Lee water flows may make it so easy to pin yourself.

1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:11.120
 So it's technique. It's like the elegance, the ease of movement.

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:19.280
 This is the Satya Brothers, Vasya Satya, like the, just the elegance, the efficiency, the

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:20.280
 chance of it.

1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:21.280
 They're practically like ballet watching those guys.

1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:23.560
 You know, it's incredible. Satya Brothers are massive.

1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:29.920
 And also caveat a little bit that like, if you're, if you're approaching this from a

1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:37.120
 Russian perspective, Russians are quite truthful about things, especially when it comes to

1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.120
 something like combat.

1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:42.120
 They just, this is how it is, and this is how it's going to be.

1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:43.120
 It's honest.

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:44.120
 Yes.

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:49.240
 And honesty is what I really like about catch wrestling because I find that we, given any

1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:54.680
 opportunity for us to be dishonest for any number of reasons, we're going to, especially

1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:59.200
 if it's a dishonesty towards a positive, right, like, oh, well, you know, it's all technique

1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:03.240
 and it's all this and it's the gentle art and blah, bro.

1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:08.160
 I have rolled with ADCC world champions, you know, some of the best you have ever heard

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:09.160
 of.

1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:13.360
 There ain't a lot of gentleness when it comes to like, oh yeah, they wanted to sweep you

1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:15.240
 and you said no.

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.160
 And then you did said no again.

1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:20.120
 And then you said no and attacked their leg.

1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:24.400
 It ceases to be all that gentle because at the end of the day, these dudes are strong

1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:25.400
 as hell.

1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:26.400
 They're flexible.

1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.240
 They're all, I mean, they're, they're the difference between the athleticism and, and

1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:35.240
 the, the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap.

1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:39.620
 The athleticism shows up, but then there's all that other extra.

1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:45.480
 And part of that is meanness and, and pain and, uh, getting what you need out of it.

1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:51.400
 But see, there is a philosophical difference in the way it's thought because I think some

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:55.520
 of it is just, they just in denial, like, oh, people will, they like to, people like

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.720
 to espouse a lot of things as theory.

1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:00.120
 And then it's like, okay, let me watch when they're, oh, you're not doing.

1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:02.080
 Anything about what you said right now.

1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:03.960
 In fact, you're doing the opposite.

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:10.080
 You're literally hurting that guy because you, your shit ain't working in the way that you'd

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:11.080
 like it to.

1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:12.080
 So you're having to use strength.

1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:14.480
 You're having to, that's one of my favorites, like, oh, you're using too much strength.

1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:16.360
 And it's like, well, hold on.

1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:21.480
 Do we want people not to use strength at this point to understand more of mechanics?

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:25.480
 Or are you trying to tell people if they use strength at all, uh, that they're somehow

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:26.840
 bad at what they do?

1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:28.360
 Cause you know, it's not my fault.

1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:29.360
 You're not stronger than.

1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:33.520
 I'm speaking of something else that's, uh, that's, well, I tend to think what it comes

1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:38.640
 down to is like, strength is fine until you beat me with it, then it sucks.

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:39.640
 Okay.

1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:41.040
 So strength is another thing.

1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:44.200
 I'm speaking, I'm thinking about more like anger.

1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:45.200
 Oh, sure.

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:46.200
 Okay.

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.640
 So like a lot of angry guys in Jiu Jitsu.

1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:48.640
 I know that.

1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:49.640
 Really?

1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:50.640
 Okay.

1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:51.640
 Okay.

1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:55.400
 Well, but let's talk about, let's talk about the highest level of competitions.

1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:56.880
 There's a book called wrestling tough.

1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:57.880
 Yeah.

1:15:57.880 --> 1:15:58.880
 There's a really good book.

1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:03.440
 Cause I've, I've encountered in my life, a few, uh, especially in wrestling, people

1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:10.400
 who really try to find a way to use anger, to get really angry at their opponent.

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.760
 Not like stupid anger, but just like.

1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:20.880
 Intense pointed, uh, anger, uh, distilled into something, uh, that you can use fuel.

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:24.600
 And like, I remember the story, I don't know where I read it, it might be wrestling tough

1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:30.960
 where a person was imagining that their opponent just raped their mother, raped their, uh,

1:16:30.960 --> 1:16:34.920
 girlfriend or something like that to, to create this like method acting thing in their head

1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:42.680
 to be like, to, to snap them out of this polite interaction of usual like athletic convention

1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:46.600
 and like, you know, design of necessity.

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:55.720
 So my anecdote for this was I was sitting with a backstage before a fight, not my fight

1:16:55.720 --> 1:17:00.080
 and I'm, I'm working with this guy and this dude is, this is a, this is a world champion

1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.080
 guy.

1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:08.520
 Uh, and he's competed at the highest levels, uh, and he, he looks at me and he goes, hmm,

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:11.080
 you know, do you ever get nervous before fights?

1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:14.200
 And I looked at him and I went, no, I don't.

1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:18.000
 And he just looks at me and he's like, fuck man, I'm so nervous, you know, how do you

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000
 do it, man?

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:22.240
 Well, you know, I wish it could be like you and I said, you know what, that doesn't mean

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:24.200
 that what I'm doing is better.

1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:26.080
 It's just what is necessary for me.

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.760
 It's the way I am.

1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:31.520
 And I told him, so this anecdote goes into another anecdote.

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:38.760
 This is a family guy episode, I guess, so, uh, where some, uh, another famous high level

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:46.840
 guy told me about this experience with a world champion boxer in Japan and this guy would

1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:52.720
 get insanely nervous and worked up and anxious before his matches and he hated it and hated

1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:53.720
 it and hated it.

1:17:53.720 --> 1:17:56.160
 And so he wanted to get rid of that feeling.

1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:03.240
 So he went to a hypnotist for a bunch of sessions and managed to, and he goes in and next fight

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:06.440
 cools a cucumber and doesn't perform and loses.

1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:13.400
 And so what I said, going back to anecdote one was, uh, you know, whatever is necessary

1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:19.600
 for you to get yourself in the best state of being right now to compete, whatever that

1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:23.720
 may be, it could be absolute stress and fear.

1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:26.880
 It could be anger, it could be calmness, it could be whatever.

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:33.640
 But there is a, but there is a, there's a state at which you need to be in to do your

1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:34.640
 best.

1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:36.840
 You have to lose to the individual, you have to find that.

1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:40.760
 Can you comment on, uh, Tyson, Mike Tyson?

1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:42.160
 Oh, yeah, that thing.

1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:45.240
 So first, so he, uh, there's two things I want to know.

1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:49.920
 So he's a, in terms of fear, there's a clip there, I think from a documentary where he

1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:55.600
 talks about, he is like fully afraid as he walks up to the ring and as he gets closer

1:18:55.600 --> 1:19:00.080
 and closer and closer, he gets more confident until he gets in and then he's a God or something

1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:01.320
 like that.

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:09.960
 That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan, that he gets aroused, uh, at the possibility

1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:12.840
 of true, like I've hurting somebody in the ring.

1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:15.240
 So like he gets aroused at the violence.

1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:16.240
 Yeah.

1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:22.080
 Uh, I like it cause it's coupled to your, basically statement that we need to own, to find our

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:30.320
 own unique way of existing at our top level of performance and that perhaps is Mike Tyson.

1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:35.360
 So do you think there's something more deeply universal to the, the Mike Tyson speaking

1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:37.680
 to the fact that he's aroused at the possibility of violence?

1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:42.000
 Yeah, I do actually, uh, although I don't think that it always equates to arousal for

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000
 people.

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.720
 In fact, I would say in general, it doesn't, uh, I can say I've never had a boner in the

1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:47.720
 ring.

1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:51.400
 In fact, of anything, you know, old combat cock is like, we're not hanging around.

1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:52.400
 We're leaving.

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:53.400
 We're going up.

1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:54.400
 Yeah.

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:55.400
 We're taking off.

1:19:55.400 --> 1:19:56.400
 Yeah.

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:57.400
 We don't want anything to do with this.

1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:58.400
 Yes.

1:19:58.400 --> 1:19:59.400
 You have fun.

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:00.400
 Yeah.

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:06.080
 But, uh, the power with the feeling of aliveness, yeah, I could see it.

1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:11.080
 It being, you know, back to the, even the concept of the Ubermensch, I feel like the

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:15.800
 states, the highest states of being I've ever been in were in the midst of conflict.

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:19.640
 I felt like that was the time those are the, those are the moments in my life where I felt

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:25.240
 like I was at the highest level of being as a human in existence.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:30.920
 But yet, even being in that state was not, it was not something that you could interact

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:33.040
 with people that weren't in that state with you.

1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:34.040
 Like they wouldn't get it.

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:38.080
 You would almost seem, and to be that way all the time, either A might drive you mad

1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:42.960
 or B is you're not, you're something that's untenable to the rest of society.

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:45.440
 Like you can't function with everybody else.

1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:46.440
 It will not work.

1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:50.400
 It's just like you said with the Ubermensch, it's like, it's perhaps that ideal is not

1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:52.240
 something you can hold for long.

1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:53.760
 That's the very nature of it.

1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:54.760
 Yeah.

1:20:54.760 --> 1:21:00.640
 There's an example in Lesbock's Zarathustra about a snake being down the person's throat

1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:07.000
 and biting it and then having this maniacal laughter erupting.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:15.480
 And you know, to me it was, at least I read it as, yeah, okay, there's this insane moment

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:21.920
 that isn't forever, but that it is life and death and it is, and the overcoming it is

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:27.600
 the thing that all of a sudden gives you that tapping into your highest state, right?

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:34.960
 This is, you know, man is a chasm, a tightrope between man and Ubermensch.

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:42.840
 Well, I don't want to leave your thought about, we'll call those things flourishes to

1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:51.400
 the aspect of Tyson's interpretation or his expression of his feelings in combat.

1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:55.960
 And so I gave this antidote to the guy and I just, you know, at my first anecdote to

1:21:55.960 --> 1:21:59.800
 that athlete I was working with and I said, you know, this isn't, there isn't a superior

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:01.160
 way in this sense.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:02.800
 There is the way that works for you.

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:07.040
 That may be something you can implement to other people if you find that person because

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:12.680
 we all have different personalities and to me, that's an absolute, I don't want to, don't

1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:19.120
 come at me with all your other fucking social sciences crap, no, we have distinct personalities.

1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:21.520
 That personality, that who you really are.

1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:25.400
 And this, you know, again, Heidegger, Dasein, like being authentic.

1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:29.680
 If you're authentic with who you are, goods and bads, you will know how to create what

1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:30.680
 that is.

1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:37.120
 And for me, violence and fighting and conflict was something that always felt normal to me.

1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:42.640
 And I don't mean normal and like I grew up in a war zone or abuse of household or something

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:43.640
 like that.

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:53.120
 And I was a kid who was very joyful and inquisitive and spent a lot of time around older people

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:55.120
 of all things.

1:22:55.120 --> 1:23:00.240
 And also, while I don't think I have much capability towards engineering, my mom said

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:05.000
 that one of the first things as like a little baby, when she put me in my sister's old

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:10.240
 crib, instead of my sister who just milled about and was fine with it all, the first

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:12.040
 thing I did was I completely deconstructed it.

1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:14.040
 I didn't break it.

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:15.040
 I figured out how to pull it apart.

1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:16.040
 Curiosity about the world.

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.520
 And yet that wasn't in conflict with the idea of violence?

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:19.720
 No, not at all.

1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:27.840
 And so being a very joyful and nice kid, but, you know, kids are kids and if kids can find

1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:34.920
 that you respond maybe more easily to agitation, they will agitate you.

1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:40.320
 And if you should stand out in some way by being taller or bigger or something or caring,

1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:42.840
 especially they will agitate you.

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:44.720
 They don't really fully understand it either.

1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:48.360
 And so I don't hold anything against like any of the kids that used to pick on me or

1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:52.280
 whatever, especially at the youngest age is like, man, they don't know shit either.

1:23:52.280 --> 1:24:00.520
 So, but once that line was pushed for me, it was, Oh, well, I was, I was being cool.

1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:01.520
 Now you're being uncool.

1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:02.520
 Yeah.

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.680
 Well, then that gives me license for everything.

1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:09.240
 And so boom, we would just go at it or kids that would try to initiate a fight and it's

1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:10.800
 okay.

1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:17.560
 And being in that moment of just going, going to town with someone else, it just felt like

1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:19.760
 this is I belong here.

1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:20.760
 Yeah.

1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:22.280
 It was, it was never a problem for me.

1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:28.400
 Like the, in fact, if anything, the over what I had to understand was, well, not only did

1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:34.200
 I learn the hard way that it doesn't matter at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:41.680
 what anybody else does, if your response and violence, even to their violence, if you're

1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:49.560
 the winner is often going to be penalized severely, you know, society, state apparatus,

1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:51.440
 they don't want any of that.

1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:55.640
 They want to be the only arbiter of violence in the world always.

1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:00.480
 But I learned a very difficult lesson with that and it was really impactful in a negative

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:07.040
 way on me, but I've also, I had to learn on an individual sense to, you need to manage

1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:13.680
 violence too, because hey, if someone attacks you or starts a fight with you and you go

1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:20.480
 at it, okay, beating them up is one thing, you know, trying to grab a handful of broken

1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:25.680
 glass from the street and throw it in their face, maybe that's a bit much at seven.

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:33.720
 So you need to learn what level is necessary and you need to learn what comes with all,

1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:38.200
 what's the responsibility of, when you enact violence, I mean, you take on something when

1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:40.760
 you have a responsibility for that.

1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:43.320
 This is the extension of your actions.

1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:52.520
 So but as I got older and especially as I found sports and then combat sports, now this

1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:59.880
 was a place for me to flourish and to the point where I was more myself in that space

1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:05.880
 than I was outside of it until time enough where I could learn to get this back together

1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:06.880
 again.

1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:10.520
 And I never say that I, that I'll merge the two or anything like that.

1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:24.720
 So all what happened, my journey from adolescence on to manhood, a huge portion of it, besides

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:30.720
 the normal finding yourself, whatever, whatever, actually what it was was re, getting back

1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:36.440
 to who I always was, getting that curious kid, the kind kid, getting back to the guy

1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:42.120
 that I should have been allowed to become instead of what happened under the pressures

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.760
 of other things.

1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:54.840
 And the attempt for society and certain people within managerial positions to compress what

1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:57.920
 that was into something that they found more suitable.

1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.560
 Yeah, but those pressures allow you to discover this little world, forbidden world in many

1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:09.640
 ways of violence that you could explore through sport, you can explore it and it's more socially

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.400
 acceptable to explore it through sport.

1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:12.400
 For sure.

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.640
 And even, but even then there's like, at times it's socially unacceptable.

1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:25.760
 So I beat some shilt, I'm, he cut my right eyebrow, I cut him and busted his nose and

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:30.040
 he's bleeding all over me as I have an arm bar on top of him getting, you know, it's

1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:37.760
 raining blood, quote, some slayer from a lacerated, some shilt, bleeding in his horror, creating

1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:38.760
 my structures.

1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:39.760
 Now I shall rain in blood.

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:47.920
 But I win the fight, arm bar, nasty one, I get on my feet.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:53.360
 And the first thing I do is I wipe all the blood off onto my hands and I lick it and

1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:55.800
 I do my thing.

1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:01.160
 And all the MMA journalists freaked out, Dana White's like, man, I don't know about that.

1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:05.120
 You know, we don't want him doing, everybody had this huge problem.

1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:11.160
 And then some folks would even contend, oh, you know, we're trying to do, like, no, no,

1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:12.160
 this isn't planned.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:15.080
 This isn't, you know, think of these things, this isn't, this is how I really feel.

1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:17.280
 This is who I really am.

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:22.600
 And you know, it was even kind of comical after the fact, you know, and BJ Penn was on the

1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:27.720
 very card with me, watching him at some point in his career, all of a sudden, win fights

1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:31.280
 and then do this licking the glove thing and everyone thinks it's the coolest thing ever.

1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:33.440
 And I'm like, hey, fuck faces.

1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:38.760
 I did this in 2002 or one, 2001.

1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:42.480
 And BJ Penn actually back then was like, dude, you're a badass, you're a killer, you

1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:43.480
 know.

1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:44.880
 Where did that come from?

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:46.880
 Because that seems like a deeply human moment.

1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:51.480
 I could say, I could just be, you know, goofy about it and call it orgiastic, you know,

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:52.480
 to align with it.

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:53.480
 Go back to Mike Tyson.

1:28:53.480 --> 1:29:00.240
 Yeah, but Tyson, but no, no, it isn't, it's beyond that.

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:01.240
 Is it a celebration of human nature?

1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:05.120
 I've had some pretty decent orgasms in my life at this point, I'm 43, so, but no, none

1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:06.440
 have ever compared to that.

1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:09.960
 Like I said, it is a feeling of highest being to me.

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:18.800
 And I, this is, this is where I feel like the restrictions of general existence in society

1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:26.640
 are gone and I get to fully live in a state that feels more meaningful of the most meaning.

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:33.080
 You know, I think of it as life and death and it's just, it is the way I'm built.

1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:37.000
 And I don't have, I've never had any problem applying violence.

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:41.080
 Like it doesn't, I don't know where it comes from or how you would define it or whatever

1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:47.160
 if you want to stick me under in a psychologist chair, but like I don't, there's a part of

1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:52.000
 me that can just like, no, if I'm gonna apply, I can apply violence to any level and be okay

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:53.000
 with it.

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:56.560
 And it doesn't, I don't lose sleep, it doesn't bother me.

1:29:56.560 --> 1:29:58.560
 It's not a problem.

1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:07.320
 It was me learning how to fully understand violence, humans and the broader perspective

1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:11.880
 that allowed me to think about things and like, well, what am I, what, what do I really

1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:17.120
 want to accomplish with my actions in the world just on a whole, you know, not compartmentalizing

1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:19.120
 my sporting career.

1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:24.520
 Even when I get in the ring, I don't have any mercy generally.

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:31.880
 And if I do, it's because I make a really deliberate attempt to be in a state where

1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:33.480
 I can have mercy.

1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:37.240
 If I just go in there to fight with everything I got, there is zero.

1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:38.240
 The natural state.

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:42.040
 There's nothing, there's nothing that will hold me back other than the referee.

1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:43.040
 And that's that.

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:49.560
 You know, I know I agreed to be allowed to do and not to do, but within that, no.

1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:52.240
 And I expect it to be done to me.

1:30:52.240 --> 1:31:00.240
 But in terms of values, in terms of seeing what, to me, violence is just yet another

1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:04.960
 canvas that humans can paint beautifully on.

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:05.960
 Clearly.

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:09.200
 I mean, we have venerated the violent.

1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:13.080
 There are communists that venerate the violent on their behalf.

1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:16.360
 There are national socialists that venerate the violent there.

1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:21.800
 And then if you remove it from an ideological perspective, we venerate the violent when

1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:23.760
 they're a hero.

1:31:23.760 --> 1:31:26.480
 We venerate the violent in our religion.

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:32.440
 Well, I mean, I guess some people venerate the violence of Yahweh and Saddam and Gomorrah.

1:31:32.440 --> 1:31:34.640
 So or do we say Jehovah?

1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:36.640
 I don't know.

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:42.600
 Is there, you've already mentioned one, but is there a fight where you've achieved the

1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:46.360
 highest of heights for your own personal being?

1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:51.360
 Just when you look within yourself that you're the proudest of or maybe was your most beautiful

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:52.360
 creation?

1:31:52.360 --> 1:31:53.360
 Is this something that stands out?

1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:55.080
 Yeah, there are a few, actually.

1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:56.560
 Fighting semi shield and a rematch.

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.920
 Well, the first one was pretty good, too.

1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:01.640
 But the rematch was I was suffering.

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:07.560
 I'd suffered early prior, the week prior to food poisoning.

1:32:07.560 --> 1:32:16.160
 And so while my abs are looking all right, I in the ring didn't have the power that I

1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:17.680
 expected to.

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:23.280
 And I was struggling in ways in some of the grappling for the submission stuff that I

1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:24.280
 hadn't accounted for.

1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:26.560
 Just exhaustion or mental exhaustion?

1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:28.640
 No, I mean, like just physical.

1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:32.480
 But I wasn't back up to 100% in terms of this power output.

1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:36.840
 And semi was, well, he's always seven foot tall.

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:44.560
 But this time he was, the first time I fought him, he was 260, 257 or 260 something, something

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:45.560
 like that.

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:46.560
 This time he was like 290.

1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:49.280
 And so he was a significantly bigger cat.

1:32:49.280 --> 1:32:51.680
 And he was, he's a big dude.

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:58.960
 And I just remember being up against the ropes with him, changing levels, trying to take

1:32:58.960 --> 1:32:59.960
 him down.

1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:02.000
 And he's fighting and he's hippin.

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:05.440
 And I just thought in my head, there's no fucking way I'm going to lose this fight.

1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:07.080
 There's no way you are not going to beat me.

1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:08.680
 It's not going to happen.

1:33:08.680 --> 1:33:09.680
 And I arm barred him.

1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:10.680
 The other arm.

1:33:10.680 --> 1:33:13.800
 And you remember the fact he's like, man, I really wanted to get you for that.

1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:14.960
 I wanted to get that match back.

1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:16.680
 And then you fucking got my other arm, dick.

1:33:16.680 --> 1:33:20.240
 I'm like, dude, I still love you though.

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:25.720
 But the whole time you're like, so this has to do the, the dichotomy of you're feeling

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.200
 you're worst.

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:28.200
 And having to overcome.

1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:31.160
 You're like literally mentally telling yourself, there's no way.

1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:32.880
 There's no fucking way I'm going to lose this fight.

1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:36.760
 And then there's even my last bare knuckle match and getting in the ring and fighting

1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:41.720
 bare knuckle boxing for the first time.

1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:49.360
 And just thinking, just being in a great state and just looking so forward to seeing, I mean,

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:54.760
 I called someone and I was talking to them the night before and I said, yeah, well, I

1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:59.000
 want, you know, I video called you because this face might not look like this when I

1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:00.000
 see you next.

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:03.320
 And they're just like, uh, okay.

1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:05.240
 That's not just like empty trash talk.

1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:09.160
 That's no, that's like a clarity of mind and the seriousness of all this.

1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:10.760
 I go on my diet.

1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:14.840
 I'm most pretty high of chance of being deformed some way.

1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:16.000
 So the fuck it.

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000
 I don't really.

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.320
 Are you, do you think about, are you accepting your own death?

1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:20.320
 Yes.

1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:21.320
 100%.

1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:22.320
 Yeah.

1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:26.800
 I, in fact, and that's in a strange way, that's partially what makes it so elevated in terms

1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:37.320
 of my, my sense of feeling by being able to have death at my side, it feels good.

1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:43.880
 And to be there and to think that this could be the one, like why not, you know, uh, I'm

1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:49.160
 not a religious person at all, even though I very much have to seem, seems to bang on

1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:54.160
 the drum about the usefulness or understanding the usefulness of religion for people.

1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:59.520
 Um, but, you know, if, if, if, if I got to do something, then yeah, put me in Valhalla,

1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:00.520
 man.

1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:01.520
 I don't want to be anywhere else.

1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:02.800
 Nothing else seems like a good place for me to be.

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.280
 I want to, I want to fight all day long and feast all night.

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:07.280
 You know, that sounds great.

1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:12.000
 I saw you, uh, throw your hat into the ring of fader Emily Nankin.

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:13.000
 Yes.

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.440
 He got COVID, I guess.

1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.760
 I hope he, I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good.

1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:18.760
 If not better.

1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:22.040
 But did I understand correctly that that might be his last fight?

1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:23.040
 Yes.

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:24.040
 That's my understanding.

1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:25.520
 And it would be epic as hell.

1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:31.080
 And it would be epic as hell because the, the person that I want to give my most to

1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:37.600
 is a person that I respect, especially at this, this long, uh, this long, this, this,

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:42.560
 this long career of mine and getting at this, this, this year's like two warriors.

1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:46.640
 And, and, and that's the thing about even this going in there with the aspect of being

1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:51.880
 with death and all that is that when that person is in there, there are my brother with

1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:53.360
 me in this and that.

1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:58.480
 So when you give me your best, even if I, even if I win dominant fashion, but if you

1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:03.120
 show up and you're as authentic and being here as I am, then, then I love you.

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:05.280
 And I'm glad for you to be here and we're in this together.

1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:12.920
 And, and at this point, you know, your loss or my loss or whatever is no less deserving

1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:15.960
 of veneration than the wind, like we're here in this.

1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:21.760
 And so to be in the ring with Fyodor and to venerate him in win or defeat, to be in

1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:29.760
 there with, with someone, uh, like that is to me, it's so rare.

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:37.920
 So it's incredible how the ultimate violence is coupled with like love or respect.

1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:44.000
 And it's like, it's, it's weird how this is, uh, how the competition and his violent

1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:51.280
 form is also a, uh, veneration of just human connection.

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.280
 It's also the removal.

1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:57.600
 I feel like it's the purest, one of the purest ways, purest on the most honest places a person

1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:58.600
 can exist.

1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:01.680
 Uh, that line and fight club, you don't know really who you are until you've been in a

1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:02.680
 fight.

1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:03.880
 I mean, I believe that.

1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:09.680
 And, uh, I've seen so many examples of people trying to portray themselves as one thing.

1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:13.020
 And then in the ring, you see who they really are.

1:37:13.020 --> 1:37:19.240
 Or even when they're trying to portray themselves as one thing and they're winning the crowd

1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:22.200
 at times we'll see who they really are and still hate them.

1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:27.560
 You know, it's like, but I said all the good things, bro, don't work that way.

1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:28.560
 Yeah.

1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:32.520
 But speaking of Fyodor, if we take you out of the picture, who are the greatest mixed

1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:34.360
 martial arts fighters of all time?

1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:41.480
 Uh, I, I feel you out of the picture as a cop out to some degree, I feel like we need

1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:47.640
 a little bit more time, you know, so to, to, to see how, how this unfolds, because you

1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:48.880
 got to compare a lot of things.

1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:55.120
 And I, uh, did I, did I, I think I'm like, I did an interview, I don't know about centuries,

1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:00.360
 but that would help if we can keep accurate records and not allow, uh, too much, uh, bias

1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:09.760
 to, to fall into too much profit, but, um, I made an argument, uh, I was in, I, I get

1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:15.280
 a, it was, it was a interview with an MMA outlet of some sort and I can't recall who

1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:23.200
 it was, but oh, it was an argument about will the winner of came Velazquez versus steep

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:26.600
 Miochik be the greatest MMA heavyweight of all time.

1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:28.600
 And I said, fucking no way.

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.240
 Oh no, it's Cormier Miochik.

1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:32.240
 That's what it was.

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.280
 I said, absolutely not, not even close.

1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:40.160
 And I said, these guys need a bit more time to see how things go and also how things go

1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:41.160
 for some of their opponents.

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:43.640
 And like, there's, there's more factors than just this one fight.

1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:44.640
 It really is.

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:49.440
 And I go, and when you want to weigh these people, even if let's say we'll bring Alistair

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.680
 or, uh, yeah, Alistair Overeem into the, into the equation.

1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:54.000
 Okay.

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.800
 You judge him on what you know now, what he's done for you lately.

1:38:57.800 --> 1:38:58.800
 Okay.

1:38:58.800 --> 1:38:59.800
 Right.

1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:03.200
 Which is a very myopic way of doing it.

1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:10.720
 Because he done over his career K1 champion, uh, he was a champion in, um, uh, dream.

1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:16.880
 Um, he strike force, blah, blah, blah, his overall record, the entirety of all the, the

1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:17.880
 different opponents he's fought.

1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:28.840
 And I just sit back and I go, okay, he's not the UFC champ, but his accolades, his merits

1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:35.600
 in some ways actually stand up higher than Cormier's and Miojito's.

1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:37.240
 So what about the moments?

1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:43.800
 Do you give much value to the special moments, like the highest, highest you rise to not in

1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:49.760
 terms of records or the strikes landed, but just creating a magical moment in, in a, in

1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:50.760
 a, in a fight.

1:39:50.760 --> 1:39:55.360
 It doesn't have to be even a championship fight, but just, you know, Conor McGregor is an example

1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:59.800
 of somebody who creates a narrative, who gets a story, creates a drama, and a special

1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:04.480
 magic happens, even if it's like, not when the myth is greater than reality.

1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:05.480
 And that is always the case.

1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:08.520
 But do you, do you, and so I understand that so very much.

1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:14.640
 And it takes an asshole like me to, to poo poo on your myth, at least get you at the end

1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:20.720
 of the day, you're not going to abandon your myth, but, um, perhaps temper it with the

1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:21.720
 facts and logic.

1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:24.000
 But, uh, so you're not a fan of myth.

1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.640
 No, I'm a absolute massive fan of myth.

1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.140
 But you prefer facts and logic.

1:40:28.140 --> 1:40:33.280
 It's like, it's like when I, no, I mean, I like saying facts and logic because people,

1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:36.200
 I also, I am not a materialist in that sense.

1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.800
 I don't think that materialism can solve for everything.

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:39.800
 It's not enough.

1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:40.800
 It's not, it's not robust enough.

1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:41.800
 I'm sorry.

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:47.040
 If facts and logic and or, uh, reason as the enlightenment scholars all thought, uh, including

1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:53.400
 Marx was enough for people, then we would never, we wouldn't have any religions.

1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:56.840
 We wouldn't have any, like there would be no, we wouldn't have narratives and myths and

1:40:56.840 --> 1:40:58.120
 all this kind of stuff.

1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:02.720
 It would not be, it just, I'm sorry, there is no, there's nothing about history that

1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:07.760
 supports the idea that rationality will over, will, will overcome all.

1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:09.680
 There's something about Ben Shapiro's facts.

1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:15.200
 Don't care about your feelings that feels to be missed feels to be missing something

1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:16.720
 fundamental about human nature.

1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:20.240
 It's not clear to me exactly what is missing.

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:27.200
 To give all, all Ben, Ben, uh, a fair shake and, uh, you know, I don't know Ben Shapiro.

1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:30.680
 I don't really listen to Ben Shapiro, not against Ben Shapiro.

1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:34.960
 Um, I don't, I'm not here to say anything particularly bad about him.

1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:40.240
 Um, although I will say at one time, Tom Arnold was seemingly trying to pick an actionable

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:42.200
 fight with Ben Shapiro.

1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:43.200
 In the ring.

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:44.200
 Or somewhere.

1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:45.200
 Yeah.

1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:49.040
 And I just, and I actually responded like, and I tried to get him to clarify, say, Hey,

1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:53.000
 are you saying that you want to fight Ben Shapiro that you're looking to actually, cause

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:56.760
 I was waiting for him to say something and then I can be like, okay, well, it's one thing

1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:58.080
 to want to get into a fight with someone.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:04.120
 It's another thing to go pick on a little tiny, you know, guy like Ben who's much smaller

1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:05.920
 than you and doesn't train or whatever.

1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.920
 But you know, if it's not me, I can find someone your size and you can go fight him.

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:13.800
 You know, don't be a, basically don't be a bully piece of shit.

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:14.800
 Yeah.

1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:17.600
 You know, which by the way, Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget.

1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:22.280
 You are never going to be able to compete even with Ben Shapiro in an argument on any

1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:23.880
 level about anything.

1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:24.880
 Oh, intellectual argument.

1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:25.880
 Yeah.

1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:26.880
 Intellectual argument.

1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:29.280
 Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever.

1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:35.400
 But, but nevertheless, in the discussion of greatness in fighting.

1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:40.280
 I think you, you need to look at some of the numbers and there's the magic.

1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.440
 There is some context also in that where did Alistair Overeem fight?

1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:48.360
 Oh, we fought in pride where you could soccer kick people and stomp their heads and this

1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:49.360
 and that.

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:53.000
 And so the, the, the game environment is actually different too.

1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.400
 There's more uncertainty.

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:55.800
 There's more chaos and pride.

1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:56.800
 There's more.

1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:01.320
 Go back a little further and go like, what about the guys that used to like Dan Severin

1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:04.560
 fought bare knuckle, head butts, the whole nine.

1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:05.560
 You beat Dan Severin, right?

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:06.640
 I did beat Dan Severin.

1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:10.480
 That was, that was killing an idol, so to speak, although I didn't really kill him because

1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:11.480
 I still love him.

1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:12.480
 You know, he's still an eye.

1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:17.120
 He's still responsible for inspiration along this whole pathway.

1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:24.800
 You know, it's, it's meeting, meeting your God and then putting a knife in it, I guess.

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:27.840
 Realizing they're human and then bringing them down to your level.

1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:28.840
 Exactly.

1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.320
 But also there's a, there's a huge misconception there and that is that I could bring, maybe

1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:37.400
 I could bring Dan Severin down to my level, but I couldn't bring his mustache down to

1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:38.400
 my level.

1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:39.400
 Oh.

1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:41.320
 It is, it is of mythic proportions and.

1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:42.640
 Great than yours.

1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:43.640
 Great.

1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:44.640
 Your facial hair is great than yours.

1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:49.880
 My facial hair is, is, is, is creating its own legacy, but it is not Dan Severin mustache

1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:52.760
 level or now Don Fry mustache.

1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:55.480
 So Don Fry mustache, Dan Severin mustache.

1:43:55.480 --> 1:43:59.000
 You know, now you have like Shia versus Suni, right?

1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:00.000
 Nice.

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:06.680
 You think there'll be a Karl Marx like painting of Josh Barnett one day with the beard and

1:44:06.680 --> 1:44:08.200
 is that, is that basically what you started?

1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:09.200
 I hope so.

1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:16.400
 I will actually comb my hair, unlike Marx, but chaos is, has a charm to it.

1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:17.400
 It does.

1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:18.400
 It does.

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:21.720
 I mean, we all thought talk brown and back to the future was, was quite charming.

1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:24.600
 So you have to throw that into the calculation where they fought.

1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:25.600
 Yes.

1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:28.800
 And the rules that they fought under, you know, some of the guys like Eurvov Chanchin

1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:33.240
 won a 32 man tournament or something like that.

1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:39.720
 And I go, okay, uh, steep and Daniel Cormier are awesome.

1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:46.320
 And they may, they will, they will for sure be, uh, revered as when they're, as for their

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:54.640
 careers, 100% can you say that they're particularly even better overall than Eurvov Chanchin?

1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:56.000
 Maybe one of them could have beat them.

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.240
 Maybe, maybe one of them wouldn't have, you know, maybe, maybe Eur would have fucking

1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:01.080
 got them with the knuckles right away.

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:03.200
 Well, maybe if they fought them in pride, they wouldn't have won.

1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:05.680
 Maybe if they fought them bare knuckle, they wouldn't won.

1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:06.680
 I don't know.

1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:07.800
 And there's something about the cat.

1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:11.080
 Like do you put who is Gracie in the top 10?

1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:18.160
 You know, there's something about top 10 of all time in terms of competitors is capable.

1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:19.520
 Um, I don't know.

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:24.600
 I'd have to think about that maybe not, but I was Gracie as like pyramid level.

1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:28.560
 Like, wow, dude, what a, what an amazing man.

1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:29.560
 Yeah.

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:30.560
 He's so important.

1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:31.560
 Absolutely.

1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:32.560
 Incredibly important.

1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:38.200
 There's something about stepping into, uh, like fighting another human being under all

1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:40.320
 the uncertainty that the early UFC's had.

1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:47.720
 I mean, you don't know what is going to happen and couple that with not much money.

1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:48.720
 All of it.

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:49.720
 Yes.

1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:50.720
 So that the purity of it too.

1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:51.720
 There's something about money.

1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:57.240
 I mean, I guess it's shit for that post world, but that ruins the purity of the violence.

1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:04.640
 But people, given the opportunity for, yeah, yeah, well, the bigger things get the more,

1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:11.600
 I love the fact that, that fighting has opened up to such a degree that the career business

1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:16.440
 side of it, cause I, I absolutely distinctly separate the two.

1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:21.240
 The business side of it has opened up to give me far more possibilities, open way more doors

1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:30.200
 for me than I ever intended it to, uh, whereas the, the athlete side of things has, if anything

1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:36.880
 just gotten substantially worse, I would say, and, uh, some of this can be, some of

1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:45.920
 this is due to all the nature of all games will be learned, will be gamed, uh, without

1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:48.000
 even the rules being broken.

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:51.400
 And once that's figured out, you need to make an adjustment.

1:46:51.400 --> 1:46:53.800
 No adjustments have been made.

1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:59.360
 So the game just appears to be the same game over and over and over and over and over again

1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:04.080
 on ESPN plus on whatever, on whatever, on whatever, it doesn't really matter which night

1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:05.080
 you watch.

1:47:05.080 --> 1:47:07.080
 It's the same game constantly.

1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:13.800
 And that's not because the, the athletes are worse or better because they have had

1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:19.840
 that game, uh, structure long enough that they figured out what do you do to be, to

1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:21.320
 be the most successful at it?

1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:24.560
 What is the highest percentage way of approaching it essentially, even if you're not thinking

1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:25.560
 of percentages?

1:47:25.560 --> 1:47:30.800
 What would the, if we take a step back, it's really fascinating to think about the early

1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:31.800
 UFC's.

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:33.560
 Did you fight Dan Seven in the UFC?

1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:34.560
 I fought him in Super Brawl.

1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:35.560
 Super Brawl.

1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:37.240
 So that was in the early, early days.

1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:38.240
 You're undefeated.

1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:39.240
 2000.

1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:46.640
 Uh, what were those early days, let's say, of mixed martial arts, like, div?

1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:49.240
 Let me tell you the day of high adventure.

1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:54.640
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:55.640
 Yeah, it is.

1:47:55.640 --> 1:48:04.400
 It was so much fun and it made you feel absolutely like you were a part of a novel, a comic book.

1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:11.400
 I mean, I, I would love to transcribe my experiences as what I consider a second generation MMA

1:48:11.400 --> 1:48:24.000
 athlete, except I'm way too sensitive to anybody's personal, anything's that are not, not even

1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.600
 to, you know, I'm not a gossipy person.

1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:32.200
 I really do believe that like small people talk about others, big people talk about ideas.

1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:37.480
 So, um, but there's just some stories that just can't, you can't tell without telling

1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:38.480
 the whole story.

1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:43.600
 And there are so many amazing stories that could be told.

1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:45.760
 People being at their best, people being at their worst.

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:50.960
 Yeah, the whole, the whole, the whole, is there something you could speak to the chaos

1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:51.960
 of the time?

1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:52.960
 Oh, 100%.

1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:53.960
 Like, well, okay.

1:48:53.960 --> 1:49:00.160
 So we at AMC got, uh, connected to somebody that was throwing an event in Nampa, Idaho,

1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:07.280
 and we all piled into this and, uh, Matt Humes, uh, Subaru wagon, and we jammed out and we

1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:16.680
 left Kirkland and we headed over to Idaho only to find out that there was nothing really

1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:17.680
 put in place.

1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:22.200
 It was absolute disrepair and chaos.

1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:24.240
 Like they're, they didn't have a ring.

1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:26.240
 They didn't have this.

1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:28.720
 It was such a bullshit adventure.

1:49:28.720 --> 1:49:34.040
 But we were like, well, you know, there's hardly anywhere to fight.

1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.320
 It's, it's tough to find these opportunities.

1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:37.320
 So okay.

1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:39.720
 Well, how about this?

1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:45.440
 Whoever is here to fight and is willing, all right, well, since there's no venue, there's

1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:49.600
 no this, whatever, we all got gloves, we got mouthpieces, we'll just go to the park.

1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:51.840
 As long as you still get paid.

1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:56.240
 And so folks were kind of like, I don't know about that.

1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:01.320
 The guy I was going to fight was he finally figured that they finally, he finally gets

1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:03.200
 information on who I actually am.

1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:09.480
 And I was undefeated at the time and I'd, I think I had fought super brawl 13 and already

1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:10.560
 won that tournament.

1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:13.920
 And so he's like, yeah, I had no clue.

1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:15.160
 I'm so glad we didn't fight.

1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:16.160
 You would have murdered me.

1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:18.680
 This is, you know, what a setup.

1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:23.440
 And eventually Matt had to, had a strong arm, the guy and get our money that we were supposed

1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:28.120
 to all get and drive back and cause he, his whole position was, well, there ain't no fucking

1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:29.120
 way.

1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.640
 We drove all the way out here for free.

1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:33.080
 This is all in you.

1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:34.320
 You fucked this up.

1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.480
 Not my problem, but what is my problem is the lack of cash in my account.

1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:49.680
 So fix it, you know, or me fighting my first organized fight against an AMC guy on 11 days

1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:54.740
 notice through a connection to an old wrestling coach I had.

1:50:54.740 --> 1:50:59.760
 And I just gathered up with all my old martial arts, my old martial arts instructor that

1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:05.840
 I had worked with and we grappled in his apartment.

1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:08.480
 We did tie pads in the park.

1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:13.320
 I ran a couple of miles every day and then, all right, boom, show it up.

1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:15.920
 Won my fight by front joke in two minutes.

1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:20.400
 And then Matt goes, okay, well, hey, you did really great.

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:22.360
 We'd like you to come back and fight again in the summer.

1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:23.360
 What do you think?

1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:24.360
 Okay.

1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:26.160
 Go back off to university.

1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:31.120
 And then I think, hmm, well, that fight didn't go exactly as how I wanted it to.

1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:34.440
 So I got to find a way to get more experience.

1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:41.800
 I would literally fight people in the university like rec center on the old wrestling mats as

1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:45.880
 they didn't only had a wrestling team, I would find anyone doing martial arts, anyone talking

1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:50.000
 about getting into street fights, anyone, whatever, and just basically go, oh, you ever

1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000
 watch UFC?

1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000
 Yeah.

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000
 Yeah, that stuff's cool.

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:54.000
 What do you think?

1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.000
 Oh, man, I'm super into it, man.

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000
 That's badass.

1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000
 Rad.

1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000
 So would you want to fight?

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:06.520
 I mean, it was way easier picking fights than it was, you know, getting a girlfriend.

1:52:06.520 --> 1:52:10.160
 So I'll just, you know, path lease resistance.

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:14.400
 I think it might be useful for us to get some advice from you.

1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:15.400
 Yeah.

1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:22.880
 If you've accomplished for the journey of a martial artist first, if you accomplished

1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:26.440
 some of the greatest accolades there is in the sport, if somebody who's starting out

1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:34.320
 now or like early on in their journey, what advice would you give on how to become a martial

1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:38.240
 artist, catch wrestler, a fighter?

1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:43.600
 Well, I mean, really what it comes down to is do it because you love it.

1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:47.600
 Do it for that reason and that reason alone.

1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:52.720
 Most people that get into this and attempt to make any sort of professional inroads with

1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:57.040
 it, you are not going to be the world champion.

1:52:57.040 --> 1:53:01.920
 You probably will never even fight for a belt and you're probably not going to net make

1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:03.520
 money at this.

1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:06.280
 So don't do it for those reasons.

1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:08.360
 Do it for the reason of the passion.

1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:13.280
 Do it for the reason to be the absolute best that you can be, whatever that ends up being.

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:18.800
 You might at best only be mediocre, but you won't even be mediocre if you don't do it

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:20.520
 like you really mean it.

1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:25.200
 The passion look, where's the kernel of the passion, would you say?

1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:27.680
 Is it in the learning process itself, the improvement?

1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:29.200
 I think it really depends on the person.

1:53:29.200 --> 1:53:35.560
 I mean, there are some people that really love the fact of they feel like they're growing,

1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:36.560
 right?

1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:37.560
 Well, it's power.

1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:41.520
 You're growing, growing stronger, growing better.

1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:44.840
 The idea of eliminating weakness.

1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:51.520
 So to which I'll quickly define weakness as just like things that weaken you.

1:53:51.520 --> 1:53:55.760
 Not like being physically weak, sure, you could call that weakness, but maybe you're

1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:57.960
 not meant to be a super strong guy.

1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:06.000
 But choosing to be weak is really a different story other than just like we're all deficient

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.520
 in some way or another.

1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:10.560
 So that's neither here nor there.

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.200
 It's a matter of what you decide to do with it.

1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:15.240
 And that's it in terms of strength and weakness, at least the way I look at it.

1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:20.440
 Strength is choosing regardless of the difficulty to make improvements to, strength is even

1:54:20.440 --> 1:54:26.800
 choosing to acknowledge that you do lack and accept it and then make a decision of what

1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:27.800
 to do with it.

1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:32.000
 Yeah, but there's also, there's a bunch of stuff that just like you said is what you're

1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:33.000
 drawn to.

1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.800
 There's an honesty to just grappling that it seems more real than anything else you can

1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:38.800
 do.

1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:39.800
 Sure.

1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:41.280
 And that's where the passion and love can come from.

1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:42.280
 Yeah.

1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:47.800
 I mean, it's being in an environment hopefully that is as true as possible would be a starter.

1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:54.720
 So it's hard to be a bullshit person when you're literally trying to tear each other's

1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:55.720
 arms off.

1:54:55.720 --> 1:54:56.720
 Yeah.

1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:00.480
 You know, as you really sort of see who somebody is, I also feel like you really get to see

1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:05.600
 somebody who, there are a couple of instances where you really see who people are on the

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:10.080
 mats and in the bedroom.

1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:22.200
 Even the aspect of self betterment growth along a path, I mean, hell, that's part of

1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:28.080
 the device of capture for martial arts as a business, give you a belt, put a stripe on

1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:29.080
 your belt.

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:32.720
 Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks.

1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:37.880
 But there's a benefit to that too, I really enjoyed the progression of belts.

1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:38.880
 Sure.

1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:43.840
 You know, a bit of it is OCD or whatever, but you're enjoying the recognition of your

1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.880
 growth when you feel, when you're made to feel, when I think genuinely you do earn it.

1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:49.880
 Yeah, I agree.

1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:50.880
 In that process.

1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:51.880
 I agree.

1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:52.880
 It makes complete sense to me.

1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:59.680
 It just, it's anything that has a goodness in its purity can also have a detriment in

1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:02.200
 its perversion.

1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:06.440
 And there's a value to competition, I've gotten some shit in the past for saying this, I've

1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:16.040
 gotten the most value in giving everything I have to try to win and lose.

1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:23.160
 So I've gotten, I remember most of the matches I've lost and I think that's what I've gotten

1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:25.280
 the most from the sport is losing.

1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:26.280
 Think about it.

1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:30.920
 I mean, if you really think about it.

1:56:30.920 --> 1:56:36.200
 What makes you want to actually, in detail, go over what happened?

1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:39.440
 Oh, it's the time when you didn't get what you wanted.

1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:44.640
 It's the time when you gave it everything you had and you came up short or failed miserably.

1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:45.640
 Okay.

1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:47.800
 Especially if you're embarrassed in some way.

1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:48.800
 Right.

1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:53.000
 And so that's usually the only time people, again, calamity is the impetus for them to

1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.880
 actually turn around and go, who the fuck am I?

1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:56.880
 What am I doing?

1:56:56.880 --> 1:56:57.880
 And why am I doing it?

1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:58.880
 Yeah.

1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:02.480
 I'm going, hmm, okay, well, I won.

1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:03.480
 Why?

1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:04.480
 What was it the cause?

1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:09.920
 And so I think part of my success is that when I win, I'm brutal.

1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.880
 When I lose, I'm brutal and there is no in between.

1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:24.240
 So I remember losing the rematch against Nogara and I still feel like it was a bullshit call.

1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:30.360
 Like I feel like I won that fight, but my, my opinion is that, and this even came up.

1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:33.920
 So one of the coaches in the back was like, oh, you did great.

1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:34.920
 You know, don't feel bad.

1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:35.920
 You know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:36.920
 And I go, no, fuck that.

1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:37.920
 I didn't finish him.

1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:42.880
 I allowed the referees to make a judge a decision that I think is incorrect and bad, but that

1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:44.600
 came because I didn't take him out.

1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:45.600
 You know, fuck that.

1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:46.600
 No, no.

1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:47.600
 He won.

1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:48.600
 He's going to get more money.

1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:51.000
 He's going to get more recognition, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.760
 I accept all this and it's not okay.

1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:58.720
 And I need to, when I get a chance to fight him again, I got to figure out how to take

1:57:58.720 --> 1:57:59.720
 this guy out.

1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:01.400
 I don't want to say forever.

1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:03.160
 I'm not trying to put him six feet underground.

1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:10.920
 Well, when I fight, yes I am, but the point being, I need to find a way to, this is definitive.

1:58:10.920 --> 1:58:15.320
 You don't get to say shit about it because I'm the only one who can stand right now.

1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:16.680
 That's the way it's got to be.

1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:20.000
 Anything less than that is not good enough.

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:25.360
 And even if I achieve that, then I got to figure out, okay, it's not a given.

1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:26.640
 How did I get to this point?

1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:29.000
 How did I make that happen?

1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:36.640
 Was it simply because of his own mistakes or was it because of my successful action?

1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:38.840
 So it's always self critical.

1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:40.560
 Always, constantly.

1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:41.960
 You love movies.

1:58:41.960 --> 1:58:44.000
 I read this somewhere.

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:45.800
 You mentioned Blade Runner as a favorite.

1:58:45.800 --> 1:58:47.600
 Number one of all time, the final cut.

1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:48.600
 That's my go to.

1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:52.880
 So you would say Blade Runner is the greatest movie of all time.

1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:54.800
 It's one of the greatest movies of all time.

1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:55.800
 And it is my number.

1:58:55.800 --> 1:58:57.280
 What's in the top?

1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:01.160
 My top five, Blade Runner, final cut.

1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:03.240
 This is the original Blade Runner.

1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:10.200
 And I used to own On Tape, the original DHS cut.

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:11.800
 And I had the director's cut on DVD.

1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:14.880
 Why Blade Runner, by the way?

1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:17.000
 As a kid, I just thought it was so cool.

1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:18.600
 There was something about it that really spoke to me.

1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:26.720
 The whole cyberpunk landscapes and this guy chasing down rogue, androids, replicants, and

1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:27.720
 all this.

1:59:27.720 --> 1:59:33.120
 Is it just the entire cyberpunk universe or is it just robots as well?

1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:34.120
 No.

1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:37.040
 I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it.

1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:42.960
 On the surface, I've always tended towards dark subject matter.

1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:47.640
 Things that are of the dark, so to speak, are things that have always been gravitated

1:59:47.640 --> 1:59:48.640
 towards.

1:59:48.640 --> 1:59:57.560
 I think maybe part of it is that the things that are darker are more accepting and more

1:59:57.560 --> 2:00:00.480
 upfront with death.

2:00:00.480 --> 2:00:02.680
 And perhaps, I think, maybe that is what was.

2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.800
 Yeah, somehow more honest, perhaps.

2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:08.880
 There's also the aspect of rebelliousness, usually.

2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:17.480
 I was never one to want to just do what somebody told me to do.

2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:25.120
 I'm not sitting around trying to always be such a radical individual that I can't take

2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:26.120
 orders.

2:00:26.120 --> 2:00:27.120
 No.

2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:31.800
 In fact, I'm more than willing to take orders from somebody that I feel is competent and

2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:36.520
 has merit and reason behind what they're doing and makes like, okay, yeah, yeah, I'm

2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:37.520
 100% for it.

2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:41.040
 But only what can I take orders, I will help you achieve whatever it is if I think it's

2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:46.080
 worthwhile, even at my own expense.

2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:49.120
 But to get to that point is a rarity.

2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:51.320
 It's not a given.

2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:55.040
 And so you can even imagine being a grade school teacher and this kid doesn't respect

2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:57.880
 you and he doesn't really think you're that smart.

2:00:57.880 --> 2:01:00.200
 They don't really appreciate that.

2:01:00.200 --> 2:01:01.720
 So cyberpunk is number one.

2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:02.720
 What else is there?

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:03.720
 Cyberpunk is kind of number one.

2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:04.720
 It's an environment I love.

2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:08.400
 But at the same time, Conan the Barbarian by John Milius is one of my favorite films

2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:11.760
 of all time.

2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:17.280
 And that's such a pure film in a way, like the motivations are pure.

2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:23.560
 They're very easy to follow, but not lacking in depth.

2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:30.720
 It's not just explosions and teal and orange.

2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:34.360
 It's more on the human condition and I love it.

2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:36.400
 And it's shot incredibly well.

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:38.240
 It's got an incredible soundtrack.

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.840
 Yeah, I fucking love it.

2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:43.760
 But with Blade Runner also in a deeper sense, again, the human condition.

2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:47.920
 You start seeing what is being, what is being human?

2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:53.520
 How does this relate to, if you can make it and you can tell it what to do, at what point

2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:56.960
 is it like you should or you shouldn't?

2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:59.680
 Why do you get to determine what's alive and what's not?

2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:03.120
 What's a life that should be allowed to live and what isn't?

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:12.200
 And what would be the strain of being Roy Batty and seeing all these incredible moments

2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:20.480
 that with his passing will no longer exist, especially if he hasn't had a chance to put

2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:22.680
 that flame into another torch, so to speak.

2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:29.200
 If he hasn't written them down, if he hasn't passed them down to somebody else, gone like

2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:30.200
 tears in the rain.

2:02:30.200 --> 2:02:32.880
 Like tears in the rain, that scene is incredible.

2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:36.040
 I mean, but it's funny because those two universes are very different going into the

2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:41.240
 barbarian and cyberpunk because that makes me curious about what else might be in the

2:02:41.240 --> 2:02:43.600
 list at the top.

2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:44.600
 Well let me think.

2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:45.600
 It's a pretty...

2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:47.720
 Do you like the Godfather type of universes?

2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:48.720
 No, no.

2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:49.720
 I mean, I'm sure the Godfather...

2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:51.240
 I've never actually even watched the whole Godfather.

2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:54.400
 No, but also like, was it Casino, Goodfellas, all that?

2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:57.200
 Goodfellas is a good movie, but no, that's not on my top.

2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:01.720
 It's a good flick, but it doesn't really do it for me.

2:03:01.720 --> 2:03:06.240
 If people really want to get into this a little more, I did make a hundred, a list of a hundred

2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:09.000
 of my favorite movies on my Facebook fan page.

2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:10.000
 Nice.

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:11.000
 But...

2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:12.000
 Do you remember like...

2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:19.800
 Oh yeah, like Blazing Saddles is on there, Ridge of the Lost Ark, Vahala Rising by Nicholas

2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:31.560
 from Winding Refin, Maniac by William Lustig, it's a 1980 gnarly, video nasty horror movie.

2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:40.040
 It's about a serial killer who murders women and scalps them, and it's gnarly as hell and

2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:47.160
 very brutal and very bleak and very, I mean, it's the kind of thing that like a lot of

2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:53.200
 people would have a real hard time watching, but one, again, I like things that are dark,

2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:59.000
 but two, I thought the performances were fantastic in this film and they really got out, I think

2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:04.840
 what the underlying thing was, and it was, you know, it was a guy who was basically just

2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:11.280
 like run amok by the overbearing mother, Jungian archetype, and she was, she imparted

2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:18.040
 her insanity into him, and he, but yet there is this aspect you could see of him wanting

2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:28.320
 to try and actually be able to be in the world and have love and have feminine companionship

2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:35.080
 to go with his masculine aspect, but he had no way of understanding how to really make

2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:42.560
 that happen, and he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine, so his struggle

2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:50.680
 with, and there's a little part in the movie where he somehow comes across this model or

2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:56.360
 something, and they actually, he starts to feel like maybe he might be able to actually

2:04:56.360 --> 2:05:02.200
 have a relationship with somebody, and it goes somewhere, but yeah, even the Elijah

2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:06.880
 Wood remake I felt was really well done and captured most of the essence of what the movie

2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:12.680
 was about, but I still feel like the original by William Lustig is the best.

2:05:12.680 --> 2:05:16.680
 What's the greatest love movie of all time?

2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:18.960
 I just love the movie of all time.

2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:22.920
 So like something where love is, I mean, I suppose love underlies most of these movies,

2:05:22.920 --> 2:05:23.920
 and especially feel like the dark.

2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:29.840
 I mean, Tecache Mique's films are all about family of all things, as bonkers as those

2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:30.840
 movies are.

2:05:30.840 --> 2:05:36.440
 They, the general theme is family almost entirely in all of his films.

2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:41.480
 Yeah, there's very, I mean, even you can argue later on, yeah, it's everywhere.

2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:43.320
 Greatest love film of all time?

2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:44.320
 That's interesting.

2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:49.840
 I mean, is Excalibur a film about love?

2:05:49.840 --> 2:05:51.480
 What's Excalibur about?

2:05:51.480 --> 2:05:52.480
 King Arthur.

2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:59.960
 Excalibur is about Arthur becoming king of the Britons and his love of his country and

2:05:59.960 --> 2:06:01.680
 his love of Guinevere.

2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:13.960
 But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about the necessity for the king to love, to hold

2:06:13.960 --> 2:06:19.440
 Excalibur, to stay, to realize that while if you're the king, you can love your wife

2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:26.440
 and you can love your best friend, and they may fuck each other behind your back as they

2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:32.480
 fall in love too, but at the end of the day, your love has to be to the country and everyone

2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:40.400
 else first and not your own personal wants, which made a much more interesting story when

2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:49.000
 you have Carmen Berenna and Arthur, oh, what is that one, it's a German opera, but you

2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:55.400
 know, and Horses and Slomo and Sword Fights and an epic death scene between Arthur and

2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:56.400
 his son.

2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:01.160
 Okay, now I definitely have to watch it and I haven't watched it, embarrass me.

2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:06.960
 It is John Borman's second film in Hollywood, his first one being Point Blank with Lee

2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:15.360
 Marvin, which is also one of the upper echelon movies on my list, derived from a book called

2:07:15.360 --> 2:07:21.600
 The Outfit by, what is his name?

2:07:21.600 --> 2:07:27.040
 I forget, but Darwin Cook, the comics illustrator, he did, Donald Westlake wrote, so Darwin

2:07:27.040 --> 2:07:32.880
 Cook does an amazing comic book send up of Darwin Cook's novels and they are fucking

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:33.880
 incredible.

2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:43.200
 So anyways, but the Point Blank with Lee Marvin, it's a man driven by purpose, revenge,

2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:46.640
 but also by really pure motivations.

2:07:46.640 --> 2:07:53.400
 He wants his money, he was betrayed and he wants his cash because this is what he agreed

2:07:53.400 --> 2:07:57.420
 to do the thing for and this is, which also is part of the reason why I like No Country

2:07:57.420 --> 2:08:03.240
 for Old Men so much, which I felt was a great movie, even better book, but I remember talking

2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:09.160
 to my friend and I go, you know, Anton Chigar is the most pure human being in that whole

2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:10.160
 book.

2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:15.200
 Well, that guy's the villain, I go, is he evil?

2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:20.280
 He's the one, he lies to no one, he does everything he says he will do, he always follows his

2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:26.200
 word and on the rare occasion, he allows fate to make a decision as he figures like, well,

2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:30.800
 whatever all led us to here will lead us one way or the other.

2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:35.280
 And if we're at this crossroads, how is there any better or worse way than to do it over

2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:36.600
 a coin flip?

2:08:36.600 --> 2:08:40.960
 And so that whole scene where the guy's going, well, what am I putting up?

2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:44.920
 And he goes, everything, you've been putting it up every day of your life.

2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:46.360
 And that's true.

2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:51.840
 Everything we do is a decision, is a calling, is a choice.

2:08:51.840 --> 2:08:58.800
 And then it bummed me out that they reduced the last interaction between Chigar and what's

2:08:58.800 --> 2:08:59.800
 his face's life.

2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:02.280
 And he finally finds her.

2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:03.640
 And she's like, you don't have to do this.

2:09:03.640 --> 2:09:05.680
 And he's like, yes, I do.

2:09:05.680 --> 2:09:06.840
 This is the way it is.

2:09:06.840 --> 2:09:09.160
 You can think that your life could have turned out any sort of ways.

2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:11.560
 You could have done this, you could have done that, but the reality isn't this is the way

2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:12.560
 your life is.

2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:14.480
 It's the way it was always going to be.

2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:16.800
 The fact that I'm here is the end of it.

2:09:16.800 --> 2:09:17.800
 And that's that.

2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:22.720
 Yeah, it's funny, if you're honest, this is what Dark Movies reveal, that the villains

2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:30.360
 are the purest of humans and can teach us the most profound lessons.

2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.680
 And that's certainly an example of it.

2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:37.960
 What do you think the big, ridiculous, last philosophical question, what do you think is

2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:42.240
 the meaning of this whole thing we've got going on, of life and existence on Earth from

2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:45.800
 your individual perspective, but the entirety of the human species?

2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:49.600
 Life, the universe and everything?

2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:50.600
 Yeah.

2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:51.600
 Don't.

2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:57.720
 We could just leave it at that.

2:09:57.720 --> 2:09:59.720
 You knew exactly where I was going.

2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:00.720
 I love it.

2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:01.720
 Josh, I love you very much.

2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:03.200
 You've been a huge inspiration.

2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:08.360
 I have a friend who she said, do you know Lex Friedman?

2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:09.360
 Have you gone on Lex's content?

2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:10.480
 And I go, yes, I know.

2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:11.760
 I know Lex Friedman is.

2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:18.720
 I've sadly been way too long in contact without making it happen for too long.

2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:23.600
 And yes, I will 100%, I even cut a shirt at the beginning of the pandemic to make my own

2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:27.960
 little mask at one point due to the Lex process.

2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:32.440
 And I can't really hear you, but I'm demonstrating.

2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:38.160
 Just let's see it through, but this has been a blast and I hope you come back.

2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:40.920
 Next time, let's drink some of the Warbringer whiskey.

2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:43.160
 I will bring some Warmaster.

2:10:43.160 --> 2:10:48.200
 I wasn't sure if you were, if you imbibed at all in spirits.

2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:49.200
 100%.

2:10:49.200 --> 2:10:53.360
 It felt a little weird to do it early on in the morning, especially because I'm flying

2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:54.360
 out.

2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:58.800
 I mean, I've had some wonderful morning whiskey at times.

2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.000
 Now that you've mentioned it, it doesn't at all.

2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:06.880
 So next time, let's make sure what Joe Morgan calls the adult beverages.

2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:08.520
 Let's make sure we indulge.

2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:11.200
 I have zero reservations for doing such a thing.

2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:12.200
 I'm into it.

2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:14.000
 Josh, thanks for talking to me.

2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000
 My pleasure.

2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.560
