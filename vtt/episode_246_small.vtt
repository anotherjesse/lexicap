 The following is a conversation with Peter White, a theoretical physicist at Columbia,

00:04.800 --> 00:09.600
 outspoken critical strength theory, and the author of the popular physics and mathematics

00:09.600 --> 00:13.640
 blog called Not Even Wrong.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.680
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.880
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.840
 And now, here's my conversation with Peter White.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.320
 You're both a physicist and a mathematician, so let me ask, what is the difference between

00:29.320 --> 00:31.000
 physics and mathematics?

00:31.000 --> 00:36.880
 Well, there's kind of a conventional understanding of the subject that there are two quite different

00:36.880 --> 00:37.880
 things.

00:37.880 --> 00:45.800
 So that mathematics is about making rigorous statements about these abstract things, things

00:45.800 --> 00:48.520
 of mathematics and proving them rigorously.

00:48.520 --> 00:54.040
 And physics is about doing experiments and testing various models and that.

00:54.040 --> 01:00.640
 But I think the more interesting thing is that there's a wide variety of what people

01:00.640 --> 01:04.440
 do as mathematics, what they do as physics, and there's a significant overlap, and that

01:04.440 --> 01:09.120
 I think is actually a much, much very, very interesting area.

01:09.120 --> 01:15.000
 And if you go back kind of far enough in history and look at figures like Newton or something,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.400
 I mean, at that point, you can't really tell, you know, was Newton a physicist or a mathematician.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.080
 Christians will tell you as a mathematician, the physicists will tell you as a physicist.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.000
 He will say he's a philosopher.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
 Yeah, that's interesting.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.160
 But anyway, there was kind of no such distinction then that's more of a modern thing.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.200
 But anyway, I think these days there's a very interesting space in between the two.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.480
 So in the story of the 20th century and the early 21st century, what is the overlap between

01:43.480 --> 01:45.520
 mathematics and physics, would you say?

01:45.520 --> 01:49.840
 Well, I think it's actually become very, very complicated.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.240
 I think it's really interesting to see a lot of what my colleagues in the math department

01:54.240 --> 01:56.400
 are doing.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.080
 Most of what they're doing, they're doing all sorts of different things, but most of

01:59.080 --> 02:02.480
 them have some kind of overlap with physics or other.

02:02.480 --> 02:07.960
 So I'm personally interested in one particular aspect of this overlap, which I think has

02:07.960 --> 02:12.200
 a lot to do with the most fundamental ideas about physics and about mathematics.

02:12.200 --> 02:19.040
 But you kind of see this really, really everywhere at this point.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.880
 Which particular overlap are you looking at, Goop theory?

02:21.880 --> 02:22.880
 Yeah.

02:22.880 --> 02:28.480
 So at least the way it seems to me that if you look at physics and look at our most

02:28.480 --> 02:35.440
 successful laws of fundamental physics, they have a certain kind of mathematical structure.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.760
 It's based upon certain kind of mathematical objects and geometry, connections and curvature,

02:40.760 --> 02:44.000
 the spinners, the Dirac equation.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
 And this very deep mathematics provides kind of a unifying set of ways of thinking that

02:52.000 --> 02:54.920
 allow you to make a unified theory of physics.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.040
 But the interesting thing is that if you go to mathematics and look at what's been going

02:59.040 --> 03:06.920
 on in mathematics the last 50 hundred years, and even especially recently, there's similarly

03:06.920 --> 03:11.520
 some kind of unifying ideas which bring together different areas of mathematics, which have

03:11.520 --> 03:14.720
 been especially powerful in number theory recently.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.960
 There's a book, for instance, by Edward Frankel about love and math.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.280
 Yeah, that book's great.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.520
 I recommend it highly.

03:21.520 --> 03:29.440
 It's partially accessible, but there's a nice audiobook that I listened to while running

03:29.440 --> 03:35.720
 an exceptionally long distance like across the San Francisco bridge.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.960
 And there's something magic about the way he writes about it, but some of the group

03:39.960 --> 03:41.600
 theory in there is a little bit difficult.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.600
 Yeah, that's the problem with any of these things, to kind of really say what's going

03:45.600 --> 03:49.000
 on and make it accessible is very hard.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.720
 He, in this book and elsewhere, I think takes the attitude that kinds of mathematics he's

03:53.720 --> 03:58.200
 interested in and that he's talking about are, provide kind of a grand unified theory

03:58.200 --> 03:59.280
 of mathematics.

03:59.280 --> 04:05.680
 They bring together geometry and number theory and representation theory, a lot of different

04:05.680 --> 04:09.800
 ideas in a really unexpected way.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.560
 But I think, to me, the most fascinating thing is if you look at the kind of grand unified

04:13.560 --> 04:17.440
 theory of mathematics he's talking about and you look at the physicists kind of ideas

04:17.440 --> 04:22.720
 about unification, it's more or less the same mathematical objects are appearing in both.

04:22.720 --> 04:27.120
 So it's this, I think there's a really, we're seeing a really strong indication that the

04:27.120 --> 04:31.600
 deepest ideas that we're discovering about physics and some of the deepest ideas that

04:31.600 --> 04:36.240
 mathematicians are learning about are really, are intimately connected.

04:36.240 --> 04:40.720
 Is there something, if I was five years old and you were trying to explain this to me,

04:40.720 --> 04:47.400
 is there ways to try to sneak up to what this unified world of mathematics looks like?

04:47.400 --> 04:53.440
 You said number theory, you said geometry, words like topology, what does this universe

04:53.440 --> 04:55.480
 begin to look like?

04:55.480 --> 04:57.560
 What should we imagine in our mind?

04:57.560 --> 05:03.360
 Is it a three dimensional surface and we're trying to say something about it?

05:03.360 --> 05:09.480
 Is it triangles and squares and cubes, like what are we supposed to imagine our minds?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.320
 Is this natural number?

05:11.320 --> 05:17.000
 What's a good thing to try to, for people that don't know any of these tools except

05:17.000 --> 05:20.920
 maybe some basic calculus and geometry from high school that they should keep in their

05:20.920 --> 05:28.480
 minds as to the unified world of mathematics that also allows us to explore the unified

05:28.480 --> 05:30.480
 world of physics?

05:30.480 --> 05:37.520
 I mean, what I find kind of remarkable about this is the way in which we've discovered

05:37.520 --> 05:42.520
 these ideas, but they're actually quite alien to our everyday understanding.

05:42.520 --> 05:47.520
 We grow up in this three spatial dimensional world and we have intimate understanding of

05:47.520 --> 05:53.440
 certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things, but these things that we've discovered

05:53.440 --> 05:59.760
 in both math and physics are, they're not at all close, have any obvious connection

05:59.760 --> 06:02.120
 to kind of human everyday experience.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
 They're really quite different.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.800
 And I can say some of my initial fascination with this when I was young and starting to

06:07.800 --> 06:14.480
 learn about it was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature of these things.

06:14.480 --> 06:20.920
 It was a little bit like being told, well, there are these kind of semi mystical experience

06:20.920 --> 06:27.040
 that you can acquire by a long study and whatever except that it was actually true and there's

06:27.040 --> 06:29.600
 actually evidence that this actually works.

06:29.600 --> 06:34.040
 So I'm a little bit wary of trying to give people that kind of thing because I think

06:34.040 --> 06:35.280
 it's mostly misleading.

06:35.280 --> 06:42.160
 But one thing to say is that geometry is a large part of it and maybe one interesting

06:42.160 --> 06:47.000
 thing to say very, that's about more recent, some of the most recent ideas is that when

06:47.000 --> 06:52.720
 we think about the geometry of our space and time, it's kind of three spatial and one time

06:52.720 --> 06:53.720
 dimension.

06:53.720 --> 07:01.080
 Let's say physics is in some sense about something that's kind of four dimensional in a way.

07:01.080 --> 07:06.120
 And a really interesting thing about some of the recent developments and number theory

07:06.120 --> 07:12.680
 have been to realize that these ideas that we were looking at naturally fit into a context

07:12.680 --> 07:17.320
 where your theory is kind of four dimensional.

07:17.320 --> 07:23.200
 So geometry is a big part of this and we know a lot and feel a lot about two, one, two,

07:23.200 --> 07:24.720
 three dimensional geometry.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.720
 So wait a minute.

07:25.720 --> 07:32.520
 So we can at least rely on the four dimensions of space and time and say they can get pretty

07:32.520 --> 07:35.600
 far by working in that in those four dimensions.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.120
 I thought you were going to scare me that we're going to have to go to many, many, many,

07:39.120 --> 07:41.120
 many more dimensions than that.

07:41.120 --> 07:45.240
 My point of view, which goes against a lot of these ideas about unification is that,

07:45.240 --> 07:53.120
 no, this is really, everything we know about really is about four dimensions that, and

07:53.120 --> 07:56.000
 that you can actually understand a lot of these structures that we've been seeing in

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
 fundamental physics and in number theory just in terms of four dimensions that it's kind

08:02.000 --> 08:12.200
 of, it's in some sense I would claim has been a mistake that physicists have made for decades

08:12.200 --> 08:19.120
 and decades to try to go to higher dimensions, to try to formulate a theory in higher dimensions.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.320
 And then you're stuck with the problem of how do you get rid of all these extra dimensions

08:23.320 --> 08:27.520
 that you've created because we only ever see anything in four dimensions.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.000
 That kind of thing leaves us astray, you think.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.560
 So creating all these extra dimensions just to give yourself extra degrees of freedom.

08:36.560 --> 08:41.400
 I mean, isn't that the process of mathematics is to create all these trajectories for yourself,

08:41.400 --> 08:46.000
 but eventually have to end up at a final place.

08:46.000 --> 08:55.520
 And it's okay to sort of create abstract objects on your path to proving something.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.320
 Yeah, certainly.

08:57.320 --> 09:02.160
 And from a mathematician's point of view, I mean, the kinds of mathematicians also are

09:02.160 --> 09:06.400
 very different than physicists in that we like to develop very general theories.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.200
 If we have an idea, we want to see what's the greatest generality in which you can talk

09:10.200 --> 09:11.200
 about it.

09:11.200 --> 09:17.080
 So from the point of view of most of the ways geometry is formulated by mathematicians,

09:17.080 --> 09:18.080
 it really doesn't matter.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
 It works in any dimension.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.240
 We can do one, two, three, four, any number.

09:22.240 --> 09:28.320
 There's no particular, for most of geometry, there's no particular special thing but four.

09:28.320 --> 09:35.720
 But anyway, but what physicists have been trying to do over the years is try to understand

09:35.720 --> 09:38.480
 these fundamental theories in a geometrical way.

09:38.480 --> 09:44.960
 And it's very tempting to kind of just start bringing in extra dimensions and using them

09:44.960 --> 09:46.320
 to explain the structure.

09:46.320 --> 09:54.200
 But typically this attempt kind of founders because you just don't know, you end up not

09:54.200 --> 09:59.640
 being able to explain why we only see four.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.640
 It is nice in the space of physics that like if you look at Fermat's last theorem, it's

10:04.640 --> 10:10.040
 much easier to prove that there's no solution for n equals three than it is for the general

10:10.040 --> 10:12.240
 case.

10:12.240 --> 10:17.320
 And so I guess that's the nice benefit of being a physicist is you don't have to worry

10:17.320 --> 10:23.000
 about the general case because we live in a universe with n equals four in this case.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.200
 Yeah, physicists are very interested in saying something about specific examples.

10:29.200 --> 10:33.840
 And I find that interesting even when I'm trying to do things in mathematics and I'm

10:33.840 --> 10:39.480
 trying to even teaching courses into mathematics students, I find that I'm teaching them in

10:39.480 --> 10:45.640
 a different way than most mathematicians because I'm very often very focused on examples on

10:45.640 --> 10:52.880
 what's kind of the crucial example that shows how this powerful new mathematical technique,

10:52.880 --> 10:56.040
 how it works and why you would want to do it.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.920
 And I'm less interested in kind of proving a precise theorem about exactly when it's

11:00.920 --> 11:02.320
 going to work and when it's not going to work.

11:02.320 --> 11:08.720
 Do you usually think about really simple examples, like both for teaching and when you try to

11:08.720 --> 11:13.480
 solve a difficult problem, do you construct like the simplest possible examples that captures

11:13.480 --> 11:15.880
 the fundamentals of the problem and try to solve it?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.200
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

11:17.200 --> 11:22.400
 That's often a really fruitful way to, if you've got some idea, just to kind of try

11:22.400 --> 11:28.520
 to boil it down to what's the simplest situation in which this kind of thing is going to happen

11:28.520 --> 11:32.880
 and then try to really understand that and understand that and that is almost always

11:32.880 --> 11:34.520
 a really good way to get insight into it.

11:34.520 --> 11:41.080
 Do you work with paper and pen or like, for example, for me, coming from the programming

11:41.080 --> 11:46.920
 side, if I look at a model, if I look at some kind of mathematical object, I like to mess

11:46.920 --> 11:49.440
 around with it sort of numerically.

11:49.440 --> 11:53.000
 I just visualize different parts of it, visualize however I can.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.440
 So most of the work is like when you're on networks, for example, is you try to play

11:57.440 --> 12:03.840
 with the simplest possible example and just to build up intuition by, you know, any kind

12:03.840 --> 12:08.680
 of object has a bunch of variables in it and you start to mess around with them in different

12:08.680 --> 12:12.360
 ways and visualize in different ways to start to build intuition.

12:12.360 --> 12:19.600
 Or do you go the Einstein route and just imagine like everything inside your mind and sort

12:19.600 --> 12:24.520
 of build like thought experiments and then work purely on paper and pen?

12:24.520 --> 12:32.000
 Well, the problem with this kind of stuff I'm interested in is you rarely can kind of,

12:32.000 --> 12:38.120
 it's rarely something that is really kind of, or even the simplest example, you can

12:38.120 --> 12:42.720
 kind of see what's going on by looking at something happening in three dimensions.

12:42.720 --> 12:48.320
 There's generally the structures involved are either they're more abstract or if you

12:48.320 --> 12:53.840
 try to kind of embed them in some kind of space and where you could manipulate them

12:53.840 --> 12:57.360
 in some kind of geometrical way, it's going to be a much higher dimensional space.

12:57.360 --> 13:03.120
 So even simple examples, embedding them into three dimensional space, you're losing a lot?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.120
 Yeah.

13:04.120 --> 13:09.040
 Or but to capture what you're trying to understand about them, you have to go to four or more

13:09.040 --> 13:14.360
 dimensions so it starts to get to be hard to, and you can train yourself to try it as

13:14.360 --> 13:20.800
 much as to kind of think about things in your mind and, you know, I often use pad and paper

13:20.800 --> 13:27.120
 and often if my office office is the blackboard, and you are kind of drawing things, but they're

13:27.120 --> 13:32.320
 really kind of more abstract representations of how things are supposed to fit together

13:32.320 --> 13:37.520
 and they're not really, unfortunately, not just kind of really living in three dimensions

13:37.520 --> 13:38.520
 where you cannot.

13:38.520 --> 13:44.040
 Are we supposed to be sad or excited by the fact that our human minds can't fully comprehend

13:44.040 --> 13:45.880
 the kind of mathematics you're talking about?

13:45.880 --> 13:51.760
 I mean, what do we make of that? I mean, to me, that makes me quite sad. It makes me,

13:51.760 --> 13:56.480
 it makes it seem like there's a giant mystery out there that will never truly get to experience

13:56.480 --> 13:58.360
 directly.

13:58.360 --> 14:03.440
 It is kind of sad, you know, how difficult this is. I mean, or I would put it a different

14:03.440 --> 14:09.480
 way that, you know, most questions that people have about this kind of thing, you know, you

14:09.480 --> 14:15.080
 can give them a really true answer and really understand it, but the problem is one more

14:15.080 --> 14:20.760
 of time. It's like, yes, you know, I could explain to you how this works, but you'd

14:20.760 --> 14:26.440
 have to be willing to sit down with me and, you know, work at this repeatedly for hours

14:26.440 --> 14:32.320
 and days and weeks. I mean, it's just going to take that long for your mind to really

14:32.320 --> 14:35.760
 wrap itself around what's going on.

14:35.760 --> 14:42.200
 And so that does make things inaccessible, which is sad. But I mean, it's just kind of

14:42.200 --> 14:46.040
 part of life that we all have a limited amount of time, and we have to decide what we're

14:46.040 --> 14:49.840
 going to, what we're going to spend our time doing.

14:49.840 --> 14:55.640
 Speaking of a limited amount of time, we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together

14:55.640 --> 15:02.720
 here on this podcast. Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas that you work

15:02.720 --> 15:08.360
 on in mathematics and physics, what's used the most beautiful idea or one of the most

15:08.360 --> 15:13.520
 beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea. And once again, unfortunately, the way life

15:13.520 --> 15:18.240
 works, we only have a limited time together to try to convey such an idea.

15:18.240 --> 15:24.480
 Okay. Well, actually, let me just tell you something, which I'm tempted to kind of start

15:24.480 --> 15:28.080
 trying to explain what I think is this most powerful idea that brings together math and

15:28.080 --> 15:33.480
 physics ideas about groups and representations and how it fits quantum mechanics. But in

15:33.480 --> 15:37.400
 some sense, I wrote a whole textbook about that. And I don't think we really have time

15:37.400 --> 15:38.880
 to get very far into it.

15:38.880 --> 15:43.240
 Well, can I actually, on a small tangent, you did write a paper towards a grant unified

15:43.240 --> 15:48.560
 theory of mathematics and physics. Maybe you can step there first. What is the key idea

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
 in that paper?

15:49.560 --> 15:53.280
 Well, I think we've kind of gone over that. I think the key idea is what we were talking

15:53.280 --> 15:59.440
 about earlier, that just kind of a claim that if you look and see what's that have been

15:59.440 --> 16:06.560
 successful idea as a unification in physics over the last 50 years or so, and what's been

16:06.560 --> 16:11.080
 happening in mathematics and the kind of thing that Frankel's book is about, that these

16:11.080 --> 16:14.520
 are very much the same kind of mathematics. And so it's kind of an argument that there

16:14.520 --> 16:21.960
 really is, you shouldn't be looking to unify just math or just fundamental physics, but

16:21.960 --> 16:26.120
 taking inspiration for looking for new ideas and fundamental physics, that they are going

16:26.120 --> 16:32.360
 to be in the same direction of getting deeper into mathematics and looking for more inspiration

16:32.360 --> 16:37.440
 in mathematics from these successful ideas about fundamental physics.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.000
 Could you put words to sort of the disciplines we're trying to unify? So you said number

16:41.000 --> 16:45.640
 theory. Are we literally talking about all the major fields of mathematics? So it's like

16:45.640 --> 16:51.840
 the number theory geometry, so like differential geometry, topology, like.

16:51.840 --> 16:58.000
 So the, I mean, one name for this, that this is acquired in mathematics is the so called

16:58.000 --> 17:03.880
 Langlands program. And so this started out in mathematics. It's that, you know, Robert

17:03.880 --> 17:09.920
 Langlands kind of realized that a lot of what people were doing in them, that was starting

17:09.920 --> 17:19.720
 to be really successful in number theory in the 60s. And so that this actually was, anyway,

17:19.720 --> 17:24.440
 that this could be, could be a thought of in terms of these ideas about symmetry in groups

17:24.440 --> 17:32.120
 and representations. And, and in a way that was also close to some ideas about geometry.

17:32.120 --> 17:38.000
 And then more later on in the 80s and 90s, there was something called geometric Langlands

17:38.000 --> 17:41.880
 that people realized that you could take what people have been doing in number theory in

17:41.880 --> 17:46.560
 Langlands and, and get rid, just forget about the number theory and ask, what is this telling

17:46.560 --> 17:51.080
 you about geometry? And you get a whole, some new insights into certain kinds of geometry

17:51.080 --> 17:56.840
 that way. So it's anyway, that's kind of the name for this area is Langlands and geometric

17:56.840 --> 18:01.800
 Langlands. And just recently in the last few months, there's been, there's kind of really

18:01.800 --> 18:09.080
 major paper that appeared by Peter Schultz and Laurel Farg, where they, you know, made,

18:09.080 --> 18:15.880
 you know, some serious advance and try to understand a very much kind of a local problem

18:15.880 --> 18:21.520
 of what happens in number theory near a certain prime number. And they turned this into a

18:21.520 --> 18:26.800
 problem of exactly the, the kind of geometric Langlands people had been doing these kind

18:26.800 --> 18:32.560
 of pure, a pure geometry problem. And they found by generalizing mathematics, they could

18:32.560 --> 18:35.880
 actually reformulate it in that way. And it worked perfectly well.

18:35.880 --> 18:46.160
 One of the things that makes me sad is, you know, I'm a pretty knowledgeable person. And

18:46.160 --> 18:50.800
 then what is it? At least I'm in the neighborhood of like theoretical computer science, right?

18:50.800 --> 18:54.480
 And it's still way out of my reach. And so many people talk about like Langlands, for

18:54.480 --> 18:58.960
 example, is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics and just really admire his

18:58.960 --> 19:05.000
 work. And I can't, it's like, almost I can't hear the music that he composed. And it makes

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
 me sad.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.760
 Yeah. Well, I mean, I think unfortunately, it's not just you. It's I think even most

19:11.760 --> 19:16.520
 mathematicians have no, really don't actually understand what this is about. I mean, the

19:16.520 --> 19:21.360
 group of people who really understand all these ideas. And so for instance, this paper

19:21.360 --> 19:26.280
 of Shultz and Farg that I was talking about, the number of people who really actually understand

19:26.280 --> 19:34.120
 how that works is anyway, very, very small. And so it's a, so I think even you find if

19:34.120 --> 19:38.080
 you talk to mathematicians and physicists, even they will often feel that, you know,

19:38.080 --> 19:42.920
 there's this really interesting sounding stuff going on and which I should be able to understand.

19:42.920 --> 19:47.160
 It's kind of in my own field. I have a PhD in, but it still seems pretty clearly far

19:47.160 --> 19:48.720
 beyond me right now.

19:48.720 --> 19:55.880
 Well, if we can step into the back to the question of beauty, is there an idea that

19:55.880 --> 20:02.120
 maybe is a little bit smaller that you find beautiful in this pace of mathematics or physics?

20:02.120 --> 20:05.760
 There's an idea that, you know, I kind of went, got a physics PhD and spent a lot of

20:05.760 --> 20:11.040
 time learning about mathematics. And I guess it was embarrassing that I hadn't really actually

20:11.040 --> 20:16.560
 understood this very simple idea until I kind of learned it when I actually started teaching

20:16.560 --> 20:23.880
 math classes, which is maybe that there, there, maybe there's a simple way to explain kind

20:23.880 --> 20:29.800
 of fundamental way in which algebra and geometry are connected. So you normally think of geometry

20:29.800 --> 20:35.920
 is about these spaces and these points. And, and you think of algebra is this very abstract

20:35.920 --> 20:41.400
 thing about with these abstract objects that satisfy certain kinds of relations, you can

20:41.400 --> 20:46.720
 multiply them and add them and do stuff. But it's, it's completely abstract. It is nothing

20:46.720 --> 20:53.480
 geometric about it. But the kind of really fundamental idea is that unifies algebra and

20:53.480 --> 20:59.920
 geometry is to, is to realize, is to think whenever, whenever anybody gives you what

20:59.920 --> 21:04.680
 you call an algebra, some abstract thing of things that you can multiply and add that

21:04.680 --> 21:10.960
 you should ask yourself, is that algebra the space of functions on some geometry? So one

21:10.960 --> 21:16.880
 of the most surprising examples of this, for instance, is a standard kind of thing that

21:16.880 --> 21:23.080
 seems to have nothing to do with geometry is the, is the, the integers. So then there,

21:23.080 --> 21:29.480
 you can, you can multiply them and add them. It's, it's an algebra, but the, it has seems

21:29.480 --> 21:33.120
 to have nothing to do with geometry. But what you can, it turns out, but if you ask yourself

21:33.120 --> 21:37.840
 this question and ask, you know, is our integers, can you think if somebody gives you an integer,

21:37.840 --> 21:43.120
 can you think of it as a function on some space on some geometry? And it turns out that

21:43.120 --> 21:48.600
 yes, you can. And the space is the space of prime numbers. And so what you do is you just,

21:48.600 --> 21:53.640
 if somebody gives you an integer, you can make a function on the prime numbers by just,

21:53.640 --> 22:00.000
 you know, at each prime number, taking that, that integer modulo, that prime. So if, as

22:00.000 --> 22:04.680
 you say, I don't know, if you give, give in 10, you know, 10, and you ask, what is its

22:04.680 --> 22:11.080
 value at two? Well, it's, it's five times two. So mod two is zero. So it has zero one.

22:11.080 --> 22:16.440
 What is, what is its value at three? Well, it's nine plus one. So it's, it's one mod

22:16.440 --> 22:22.040
 three. So it's, it's zero at two. It's one at three. And you can kind of keep going.

22:22.040 --> 22:28.560
 And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea. It's at the basis of what's called algebraic

22:28.560 --> 22:33.040
 geometry. And it just links these two parts of mathematics that look completely different.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.480
 And it's just an incredibly powerful idea. And so much of mathematics emerges from this

22:37.480 --> 22:39.840
 kind of simple relation.

22:39.840 --> 22:47.480
 So you're talking about mapping from one discrete space to another, to another. So for a second,

22:47.480 --> 22:52.200
 I thought perhaps mapping like a continuous space to a discrete space, like functions

22:52.200 --> 22:57.800
 over a continuous space, because, yeah, well, you can, I mean, you can take, if somebody

22:57.800 --> 23:04.200
 gives you a space, you can ask, you can say, well, let's, let's, and this is also, this

23:04.200 --> 23:08.080
 is part of the same idea. The part of the same idea is that if you try and do geometry

23:08.080 --> 23:12.280
 and somebody tells you, here's a space, that what you should do is you should wait to say,

23:12.280 --> 23:17.000
 wait a minute, maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra. And so if I do that,

23:17.000 --> 23:21.200
 the way to start is you give me the space, I start to think about the functions on the

23:21.200 --> 23:26.720
 space. Okay. So for each point in the space, I associate a number. I can take different

23:26.720 --> 23:31.080
 kinds of functions and different kinds of values, but, but basically functions on a

23:31.080 --> 23:38.080
 space. So what this insight is telling you is that if you're a geometer, often the way

23:38.080 --> 23:43.600
 to, to, to work is to trans change your problem into algebra by changing your space, stop

23:43.600 --> 23:48.360
 thinking about your space and the points in it and thinking about the functions on it.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.160
 And if you're, and if you're an algebraist and you've got these abstract algebraic gadgets

23:52.160 --> 23:57.600
 that you're multiplying and adding say, wait a minute, are those gadgets, can I think of

23:57.600 --> 24:01.520
 them in some way as a function on a space? What would that space be and what kind of

24:01.520 --> 24:07.160
 functions would they be? And that going back and forth really brings these two completely

24:07.160 --> 24:09.280
 different looking areas of mathematics together.

24:09.280 --> 24:15.480
 Do you have particular examples where it allowed to prove some difficult things by jumping

24:15.480 --> 24:20.640
 from one to the other? Is that something that's a part of modern mathematics where such jumps

24:20.640 --> 24:24.900
 are made? Oh yeah. So this is kind of all the time. A lot, much, much of modern number

24:24.900 --> 24:30.200
 theory is kind of based on this idea. But, and, and when you start doing this, you start

24:30.200 --> 24:36.960
 to realize that you need, you know, what simple things, simple things on one side of the algebra

24:36.960 --> 24:42.160
 is, you know, start to require you to think about the other side about geometry in a new

24:42.160 --> 24:46.920
 way. You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea about geometry. Or if you start thinking

24:46.920 --> 24:51.480
 about the functions on a space, you may have, you may need a more sophisticated kind of

24:51.480 --> 24:56.680
 algebra. But, but in some sense, I mean, much or most of modern number theory is based

24:56.680 --> 25:02.520
 upon this move to geometry. And there's also a lot of geometry and topology is also based

25:02.520 --> 25:07.160
 upon, yeah, change. If you want to understand the topology of something, you look at the

25:07.160 --> 25:11.560
 functions, you do Dharam callmology, and you get the topology.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
 Anyway.

25:12.560 --> 25:19.080
 Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question. You said that this idea is beautiful. Can

25:19.080 --> 25:25.320
 you formalize the definition of the word beautiful? And why is this beautiful? Like, well, first,

25:25.320 --> 25:29.480
 why is this beautiful? And second, what is beautiful?

25:29.480 --> 25:33.680
 Well, and I think there are many different things you can find beautiful for different

25:33.680 --> 25:38.880
 reasons. I mean, I think in this context, the notion of beauty, I think really is just

25:38.880 --> 25:46.520
 kind of an idea is beautiful if it's packages a huge amount of kind of power and information

25:46.520 --> 25:54.560
 into something very simple. So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it

25:54.560 --> 25:59.200
 in the sense of, you know, what's the, what are the implications of this idea? What non

25:59.200 --> 26:05.520
 trivial things does it tell you versus, you know, how, how, how, how simply can you express

26:05.520 --> 26:06.520
 the idea?

26:06.520 --> 26:12.160
 So the level of compression, what does it correlates with beauty?

26:12.160 --> 26:17.200
 Yeah. That's one, one aspect of it. And so you can start to tell that an idea is becoming

26:17.200 --> 26:21.960
 uglier and uglier as you start kind of having to, you know, it doesn't quite do what you

26:21.960 --> 26:26.680
 want. So you throw in something else to the idea and you keep doing that until you get

26:26.680 --> 26:30.760
 what you want. But that's how you know you're doing something uglier and uglier when you

26:30.760 --> 26:38.000
 have to kind of keep adding in more, more, more into what was originally a fairly simple

26:38.000 --> 26:41.640
 idea and making it more and more complicated to get what you want.

26:41.640 --> 26:46.360
 Okay. So let's put some philosophical words on the table and trying to make some sense

26:46.360 --> 26:51.320
 of them. One word is beauty. Another one is simplicity, as you mentioned. Another one

26:51.320 --> 27:00.360
 is truth. So do you have a sense, if I give you two theories, one is simpler, one is more

27:00.360 --> 27:11.320
 complicated. Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true to capture deeply

27:11.320 --> 27:15.240
 the fabric of reality? The simple one or the more complicated one?

27:15.240 --> 27:21.280
 Yeah. I think all of our evidence and what we see in the history of the subject is the

27:21.280 --> 27:28.320
 simpler one. Though often it's a surprise. It's simpler in a surprising way, but yeah,

27:28.320 --> 27:34.080
 that we just don't, we just, anyway, the kind of best theories we've been coming up with

27:34.080 --> 27:40.760
 are ultimately when properly understood, relatively simple and much, much simpler than you would

27:40.760 --> 27:41.760
 expect them to be.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.480
 Do you have a good explanation why that is? Is it just because humans want it to be that

27:45.480 --> 27:51.560
 way? Or we're just like ultra biased and we just kind of convince ourselves that simple

27:51.560 --> 27:57.520
 is better because we find simplicity beautiful? Or is there something about our actual universe

27:57.520 --> 27:59.480
 that at the core is simple?

27:59.480 --> 28:04.600
 My own belief is that there is something about a universe that is that simple and I was trying

28:04.600 --> 28:09.680
 to say that there is some kind of fundamental thing about math, physics, and physics and

28:09.680 --> 28:20.720
 all this picture, which is in some sense simple. It's true that our minds are very limited

28:20.720 --> 28:26.520
 and can certainly do certain things and not others. So it's in principle possible that

28:26.520 --> 28:31.320
 there's some great insight. There are a lot of insights into the way the world works,

28:31.320 --> 28:35.600
 which is aren't accessible to us because that's not the way our minds work. We don't. And

28:35.600 --> 28:40.040
 at what we're seeing, this kind of simplicity is just because that's all we ever have any

28:40.040 --> 28:42.680
 hope of seeing.

28:42.680 --> 28:50.200
 So there's a brilliant physicist by the name of Sabine Hassanfelder who both agrees and

28:50.200 --> 28:59.800
 disagrees with you. I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple. But simplicity

28:59.800 --> 29:07.720
 and beauty leads us astray in the local pockets of scientific progress. Do you agree with

29:07.720 --> 29:13.720
 her disagreement? Do you disagree with her agreement? And agree with the agreement and

29:13.720 --> 29:14.720
 so on?

29:14.720 --> 29:20.600
 Yes, I thought it was really fascinating reading her book. Anyway, I was finding disagreeing

29:20.600 --> 29:25.840
 with a lot. But then at the end, when she says, yes, when we find there, when we actually

29:25.840 --> 29:30.960
 figure this out, it will be simple. And okay, so we agree in the end.

29:30.960 --> 29:37.440
 But does beauty lead us astray, which is the core thesis of her work in that book?

29:37.440 --> 29:42.880
 Actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much. I don't think, and especially,

29:42.880 --> 29:46.440
 and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her about sometimes the way she'll refer

29:46.440 --> 29:52.880
 to math. So the problem is, physicists and people in general just refer to it as math,

29:52.880 --> 29:58.680
 and they're often meaning not what I would call math, which is the interesting ideas

29:58.680 --> 30:07.640
 of math, but just some complicated calculation. And so I guess my feeling about it is more

30:07.640 --> 30:16.360
 that the problem with talking about simplicity and using simplicity as a guide is that it's

30:16.360 --> 30:23.600
 very easy to fool yourself. And it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea.

30:23.600 --> 30:28.400
 You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great, and you fall in love with it. And like any

30:28.400 --> 30:33.040
 kind of love affair, it's very easy to believe that the object of your affections is much

30:33.040 --> 30:38.600
 more beautiful than others might think, and that they really are. And that's very, very

30:38.600 --> 30:45.840
 easy to do. So if you say, I'm just going to pursue ideas about beauty and mathematics

30:45.840 --> 30:51.520
 in this, it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think. And I think that's a lot

30:51.520 --> 30:56.720
 of what the story she was thinking of about where people have gone to stray that, I think

30:56.720 --> 31:02.080
 it's, I would argue that it's more people. It's not that there was some simple, powerful,

31:02.080 --> 31:08.800
 wonderful idea which they'd found, and it turned out not to be useful, but it was more

31:08.800 --> 31:12.560
 that they kind of fooled themselves that this was actually a better idea than it really

31:12.560 --> 31:18.040
 was, and that it was simpler and more beautiful than it really was, is a lot of the story.

31:18.040 --> 31:22.760
 I think so it's not that the simplicity would be Lisa's strays that just people are people

31:22.760 --> 31:29.120
 and they fall in love with whatever idea they have. And then they weave narratives around

31:29.120 --> 31:36.480
 that idea, or they present the institution that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty.

31:36.480 --> 31:42.480
 Yeah, that's part of it. But the thing about physics that you have is that you, you know,

31:42.480 --> 31:47.760
 that really can tell, if you can do an experiment and check and see if nature is really doing

31:47.760 --> 31:54.920
 what your idea expects, that you do in principle have a way of really testing it. And it's

31:54.920 --> 31:59.760
 certainly true that if you, you know, if you thought you had a simple idea and that doesn't

31:59.760 --> 32:04.560
 work and you got into an experiment and what actually does work is somewhere, maybe some

32:04.560 --> 32:12.320
 more complicated version of it, that can certainly happen and that can be true. I think her emphasis

32:12.320 --> 32:20.440
 is more that I don't really disagree with is that people should be concentrating on when

32:20.440 --> 32:25.040
 they're trying to develop better theories on morons, on self consistency, not so much

32:25.040 --> 32:29.560
 on beauty, but, you know, not is this idea beautiful, but, you know, is there something

32:29.560 --> 32:35.600
 about the theory which is not quite consistent and that and use that as a guide that there's

32:35.600 --> 32:40.680
 something wrong there which needs fixing. And so I think that part of her argument,

32:40.680 --> 32:47.160
 I think I was, we're on the same page about what's, what is consistency and inconsistency?

32:47.160 --> 32:55.560
 Well, what, what exactly do you have examples in mind? Well, it can be just simple inconsistency

32:55.560 --> 33:01.040
 between theory and an experiment that if you, so we have this great fundamental theory,

33:01.040 --> 33:04.920
 but there are some things that we see out there which don't seem to fit in like, like

33:04.920 --> 33:08.760
 dark energy and dark matter, for instance. But if there's something which you can't test

33:08.760 --> 33:12.560
 experimentally, I think, you know, she would argue, and I would agree that, for instance,

33:12.560 --> 33:16.360
 if you're trying to think about gravity and how are you going to have a quantum theory

33:16.360 --> 33:23.240
 of gravity, you should kind of be, you know, test any of your ideas with kind of kind of

33:23.240 --> 33:26.960
 a thought experiment, you know, is, does this actually give a consistent picture of what's

33:26.960 --> 33:31.440
 going to happen, of what happens in this particular situation or not?

33:31.440 --> 33:37.800
 So this is a good example you've written about this. You know, since quantum gravitational

33:37.800 --> 33:45.840
 effects are really small, super small, arguably unobservably small, should we have hope to

33:45.840 --> 33:51.640
 arrive at a theory of quantum gravity somehow? What are the different ways we can get there?

33:51.640 --> 33:57.160
 You've mentioned that you're not as interested in that effort because basically, yes, you

33:57.160 --> 34:03.960
 cannot have ways to scientifically validate it given the tools of today.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.640
 You know, I've actually, you know, I've over the years certainly spent a lot of time learning

34:07.640 --> 34:13.600
 about gravity and about attempts to quantize it, but it hasn't been that much in the past,

34:13.600 --> 34:18.960
 the focus of what I've been thinking about. But I mean, my feeling was always, you know,

34:18.960 --> 34:24.920
 as I think speed would agree that the, you know, one way you can pursue this if you can't

34:24.920 --> 34:30.560
 do experiments is just this kind of search for consistency. You know, it can be remarkably

34:30.560 --> 34:36.280
 hard to come up with a completely consistent model of this in a way that brings together

34:36.280 --> 34:42.520
 a quantum mechanics and general relativity. And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional

34:42.520 --> 34:48.720
 way that people who have pursued quantum gravity have often pursued, you know, we have the

34:48.720 --> 34:54.520
 best route to finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity. And string theorists will

34:54.520 --> 35:00.480
 tell you this. Other people will tell you it's kind of what people argue about. But

35:00.480 --> 35:08.880
 the problem with all of that is that you end up, the danger is that you end up with that

35:08.880 --> 35:14.520
 everybody could be successful. Everybody, everybody's program for how to find a theory

35:14.520 --> 35:19.920
 of quantum gravity, you know, ends up with something that is consistent. And so, in some

35:19.920 --> 35:24.280
 sense, you could argue this is what happened to the strength there is they, they solve

35:24.280 --> 35:28.360
 their problem of finding a consistent theory of quantum gravity and then it, but they found

35:28.360 --> 35:34.840
 10 of the 500 solutions. So you, you know, if you believe that everything that they would

35:34.840 --> 35:40.480
 like to be true is true, well, okay, you've got a theory, but it's, it ends up being kind

35:40.480 --> 35:46.120
 of useless because it's just one of an infant, essentially infinite number of things which

35:46.120 --> 35:53.040
 you have no way to experimentally distinguish. And so this is just a depressing situation.

35:53.040 --> 35:59.720
 But I do think that there is a, so again, I think pursuing ideas about what more about

35:59.720 --> 36:04.960
 beauty and how can you integrate and unify these issues about gravity with other things

36:04.960 --> 36:08.680
 we know about physics and can you find a theory which were they, were these fit together

36:08.680 --> 36:13.560
 in a, in a way that makes sense and, and hopefully predict something that's much more promising.

36:13.560 --> 36:19.080
 Well, it makes sense and hopefully, I mean, we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch

36:19.080 --> 36:24.760
 of times because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things, which is like it's nice

36:24.760 --> 36:30.680
 to have a theory that's consistent, but then if the theory is consistent, it doesn't necessarily

36:30.680 --> 36:36.840
 mean anything. So like, it's not enough. It's not enough. It's not enough. And that's a problem.

36:36.840 --> 36:43.480
 So it's like, it keeps coming back to, okay, there should be some experimental validation.

36:43.480 --> 36:49.400
 So okay, let's talk a little bit about strength theory. You've been a bit of an outspoken

36:49.400 --> 36:57.000
 critic of strength theory. Maybe one question first to ask is, what is strength theory?

36:57.000 --> 37:06.320
 And beyond that, why is it wrong? Or rather, as the title of your blog says, not even wrong.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.680
 Okay. Well, one interesting thing about the current state of strength theory is that I

37:10.680 --> 37:15.200
 think it, I'd argue it's actually very, very difficult to, at this point, to say what strength

37:15.200 --> 37:19.360
 theory means. If people say they're strength theorists, what they mean and what they're

37:19.360 --> 37:24.320
 doing is a, it's kind of hard, it's hard to pin down the meaning of the term. But the,

37:24.320 --> 37:30.440
 but the initial meaning I think goes back to, there was kind of a series of developments

37:30.440 --> 37:38.320
 starting in 1984 in which people felt that they had found a unified theory of, of our

37:38.320 --> 37:43.880
 so called standard model of all the standard well known kind of particle interactions and

37:43.880 --> 37:48.560
 gravity and it all fit together in a quantum theory. And that you could do this in a very

37:48.560 --> 37:55.760
 specific way by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory of particles moving

37:55.760 --> 38:00.960
 around in space time, think about quantum theory of kind of one dimensional loops moving

38:00.960 --> 38:06.720
 around in space time, so called strings. And so instead of one degree of freedom, these

38:06.720 --> 38:10.160
 have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. It's a much more complicated theory. But you

38:10.160 --> 38:15.500
 can imagine, okay, we're going to quantize this theory of loops moving around in space

38:15.500 --> 38:21.200
 time. And what they found is that they, is that you could make, you could do this and

38:21.200 --> 38:27.000
 you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly make sense of, of such a quantum theory, but

38:27.000 --> 38:33.240
 only if space and time together were 10 dimensional. And so then you had this problem again, the

38:33.240 --> 38:37.480
 problem I referred to at the beginning of, okay, now, once you make that move, you got

38:37.480 --> 38:43.120
 to get rid of six dimensions. And so the hope was that you could get rid of the six dimensions

38:43.120 --> 38:49.080
 by making them very small and that consistency of the theory would require these, that these

38:49.080 --> 38:55.920
 six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition called being a Kalabiow manifold and that we

38:55.920 --> 39:02.400
 knew very, very few examples of this. So what got a lot of people very excited back in 8485

39:02.400 --> 39:09.160
 was the hope that you could just take this 10 dimensional string theory and find one

39:09.160 --> 39:14.040
 of a limited number of possible ways of, of getting rid of six dimensions by making them

39:14.040 --> 39:18.040
 small and then you would end up with an effective four dimensional theory, which looked like

39:18.040 --> 39:22.840
 the real world. This was the hope. So then there's then a very long story about what

39:22.840 --> 39:28.400
 happened to that hope over the years. I mean, I would argue and part of the point of the

39:28.400 --> 39:35.840
 book and its title was that this ultimately was a failure that you ended up, that this idea just

39:35.840 --> 39:42.120
 didn't, there ended up being just too many ways of doing this and you didn't know how to do this

39:42.120 --> 39:48.200
 consistently. That it was kind of not even wrong in the sense that you couldn't even, you never

39:48.200 --> 39:54.120
 could pin it down well enough to actually get a real falsifiable prediction out of it that would

39:54.120 --> 40:00.280
 tell you it was wrong. But it was kind of in the, in the realm of ideas, which initially look good,

40:00.280 --> 40:05.520
 but the more you look at them, they just, they don't work out the way, the way you want. And

40:05.520 --> 40:09.880
 they don't actually end up carrying the power or the, that you originally had this vision of.

40:09.880 --> 40:16.760
 And yes, the book title is not even wrong. Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong.

40:16.760 --> 40:22.080
 Okay. But there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement about string theory through the

40:22.080 --> 40:30.360
 decades as you mentioned. What are the different flavors of ideas that came, like the branched

40:30.360 --> 40:36.680
 out, you mentioned 10 dimensions, you mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom. What,

40:36.680 --> 40:40.200
 what are the interesting ideas to you that kind of emerged from this world?

40:40.200 --> 40:44.720
 Well, yeah, I mean, the problem in talking about the whole subject and part of the reason I wrote

40:44.720 --> 40:51.320
 the book is that, you know, it gets very, very complicated. I mean, there's a huge amount, you

40:51.320 --> 40:56.800
 know, a lot of people got very interested in this, a lot of people worked on it. And in some

40:56.800 --> 41:02.440
 sense, I think what happened is exactly because the idea didn't really work, that this caused

41:02.440 --> 41:08.040
 people to, you know, instead of focusing on this one idea and digging in and working on that,

41:08.040 --> 41:14.120
 they just kind of kept trying new things. And so people, I think, ended up wandering around in

41:14.120 --> 41:18.960
 a very, very rich space of ideas about mathematics and physics and discovering, you know, all sorts

41:18.960 --> 41:23.360
 of really interesting things. It's just the problem is there tended to be an inverse relationship

41:23.360 --> 41:28.400
 between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful this new idea that they were trying to pursue

41:28.400 --> 41:33.560
 was and how much it looked like the real world. So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came

41:33.560 --> 41:38.920
 out of it. I think one of the most spectacular is what the physicists call two dimensional

41:38.920 --> 41:45.560
 conformal field theory. And so these are basically quantum field theories and kind of think of it

41:45.560 --> 41:51.400
 as one space and one time dimension, which, you know, have just this huge amount of symmetry and

41:51.400 --> 41:58.440
 a huge amount of structure, which does some totally fantastic mathematics behind it. And again,

41:58.440 --> 42:03.920
 and some of that mathematics is exactly also what appears in the Langland's program. So a lot of

42:03.920 --> 42:09.400
 the first interaction between math and physics around the Langland's program has been around

42:09.400 --> 42:15.640
 these two dimensional conformal field theories. Is there something you could say about what

42:15.640 --> 42:24.760
 the major problems are with string theory? So like, besides that there's no experimental

42:24.760 --> 42:33.000
 validation, you've written that a big hole in string theory has been its perturbative definition.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.320
 Yeah. Perhaps that's one. Can you explain what that means?

42:36.320 --> 42:44.400
 Well, maybe to begin with, I think the simplest thing to say is the initial idea really was that,

42:44.400 --> 42:51.120
 okay, we have this, instead of what's great is we have this thing that only works. It's very

42:51.120 --> 43:00.040
 structured and has to work in a certain way for it to make sense. But then you ended up in 10

43:00.040 --> 43:04.920
 space time dimensions. And so to get back to physics, you had to get rid of five of the

43:04.920 --> 43:09.560
 dimensions, six of the dimensions. And the bottom line, I would say in some sense is very simple,

43:09.560 --> 43:15.520
 that what people just discovered is just there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this.

43:15.520 --> 43:19.160
 There's an infinite number of ways of doing it, and you can get whatever you want, depending on

43:19.160 --> 43:24.880
 how you do it. So you end up, the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions and getting to four,

43:24.880 --> 43:29.960
 just kind of collapses out of a lack of any way to kind of get to where you want, because you

43:29.960 --> 43:37.560
 can get anything. The hope around that problem has always been that the standard formulation that

43:37.560 --> 43:43.360
 we have of string theory, which is you can go in by the name perturbative, but it's kind of,

43:43.360 --> 43:52.440
 there's a standard way we know of given a classical theory of constructing a quantum theory and working

43:52.440 --> 44:01.400
 with it, which is the so called perturbation theory, that we know how to do. And that, that by

44:01.400 --> 44:07.880
 itself just doesn't give you any hint as to what to do about the six dimensions. So actual perturbed

44:07.880 --> 44:13.400
 with string theory by itself really only works in 10 dimensions. So you have to start making some

44:13.400 --> 44:20.880
 kinds of assumptions about how I'm going to go beyond this formulation that we really understand

44:20.880 --> 44:25.520
 of string theory and get rid of these six dimensions. So kind of the simplest one was the

44:25.520 --> 44:33.520
 clavial postulate. But when that didn't really work out, people have tried more and more different

44:33.520 --> 44:39.800
 things. And the hope has always been that the solution, this problem would be that you would

44:39.800 --> 44:45.400
 find a deeper and better understanding of what string theory is that would actually go beyond

44:45.400 --> 44:52.880
 this perturbative expansion, which would generalize this. And that once you had that,

44:52.880 --> 44:59.440
 it would solve this problem of, it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions.

44:59.440 --> 45:06.400
 How difficult is this problem? So if I could restate the problem, it seems like there's a

45:06.400 --> 45:15.880
 very consistent physical world operating in four dimensions. And how do you map a consistent

45:15.880 --> 45:21.760
 physical world in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world in four dimensions? And how

45:21.760 --> 45:29.680
 difficult is this problem? Is that something you can even answer? Just in terms of physics

45:29.680 --> 45:35.080
 intuition, in terms of mathematics, mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions?

45:35.080 --> 45:40.520
 Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid of the six of the dimensions. So there's kind

45:40.520 --> 45:45.800
 of two ways of doing it. One is what we call compactification. You say that there really

45:45.800 --> 45:50.320
 are 10 dimensions, but for whatever reason, six of them are really are so, so small, we

45:50.320 --> 45:56.440
 can't see them. So you basically start out with 10 dimensions. And what we call make

45:56.440 --> 46:01.400
 six of them not go out to infinity, but just kind of a finite extent, and then make that

46:01.400 --> 46:10.440
 size go down so small, it's unobservable. That's a math trick. So can you also help

46:10.440 --> 46:16.680
 me build an intuition about how rich and interesting the world in those six dimensions

46:16.680 --> 46:22.720
 is? So compactification seems to imply that it's not very interesting.

46:22.720 --> 46:27.080
 Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn if you start doing mathematics and looking

46:27.080 --> 46:33.960
 at geometry and topology and more and more dimensions is that, I mean, asking the question

46:33.960 --> 46:38.080
 like, what are all possible six dimensional spaces? It's just a, it's kind of an unanswerable

46:38.080 --> 46:42.720
 question. It's just, I mean, it's even kind of technically undecidable in some way. They're

46:42.720 --> 46:46.880
 just too, too, there are too many things you can do with all these. If you start trying

46:46.880 --> 46:51.240
 to make, if you start trying to make one dimensional spaces, it's like, well, you got a line, you

46:51.240 --> 46:55.920
 can make a circle, you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do. But as you

46:55.920 --> 47:02.080
 go to higher and higher dimensions, there's just so many ways you can put things together

47:02.080 --> 47:08.920
 of and get something of that dimensionality. And so it, unless you have some very, very

47:08.920 --> 47:13.920
 strong principle, which is going to pick out some very specific ones of these six dimensional

47:13.920 --> 47:19.600
 spaces, and there's just too many of them and you can get anything you want.

47:19.600 --> 47:25.560
 So if you have 10 dimensions, the kind of things that happen or say that's actually

47:25.560 --> 47:30.840
 the way that's actually the fabric of our realities, 10 dimensions, there's a limited

47:30.840 --> 47:36.000
 set of behaviors of objects, I don't know, even know what the right terminology to use

47:36.000 --> 47:44.000
 that can occur within those dimensions, like in reality. And so like what I'm getting at

47:44.000 --> 47:49.640
 is like, is there some consistent constraints? So if you have some constraints that map to

47:49.640 --> 47:56.440
 reality, then you could start saying like, dimension number seven is kind of boring.

47:56.440 --> 48:01.320
 All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions one, two, three. And time is also

48:01.320 --> 48:08.280
 kind of boring. And like, some are more exciting than others, or we can use our metric of beauty.

48:08.280 --> 48:13.420
 Some dimensions are more beautiful than others. Once you have an actual understanding of what

48:13.420 --> 48:17.680
 actually happens in those dimensions in our physical world, as opposed to sort of all

48:17.680 --> 48:19.640
 the possible things that could happen.

48:19.640 --> 48:23.080
 In some sense, just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them. We don't see them.

48:23.080 --> 48:27.200
 So you need to somehow explain them. The main thing you're trying to do is to explain why

48:27.200 --> 48:33.880
 we're not seeing them. And so you have to come up with some theory of these extra dimensions

48:33.880 --> 48:38.880
 and how they're going to behave. And string theory gives you some ideas about how to do

48:38.880 --> 48:44.880
 that. But the bottom line is where you're trying to go with this whole theory you're

48:44.880 --> 48:54.880
 creating is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable. So it's not a really,

48:54.880 --> 48:58.480
 it's an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing that you're trying to do there. Why are

48:58.480 --> 49:02.200
 you just adding in all the stuff and then trying to explain why we don't see it?

49:02.200 --> 49:03.200
 I mean, it just

49:03.200 --> 49:09.800
 This may be a dumb question, but is this an obvious thing to state that those six dimensions

49:09.800 --> 49:19.000
 are unobservable or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable? Or do you leave a little door

49:19.000 --> 49:25.400
 open to saying the current tools of physics and obviously our brains aren't unable to

49:25.400 --> 49:31.200
 observe them. But we may need to come up with methodologies for observing them. So as opposed

49:31.200 --> 49:36.120
 to collapsing your mathematical theory into four dimensions, leaving the door open a little

49:36.120 --> 49:41.200
 bit too, maybe we need to come up with tools that actually allow us to directly measure

49:41.200 --> 49:42.200
 those dimensions.

49:42.200 --> 49:49.720
 Yes. I mean, you can certainly ask, you know, assume that we've got model, look at models

49:49.720 --> 49:53.480
 with more dimensions and ask, you know, what would be observable effects? How would we

49:53.480 --> 50:00.080
 know this? And then you go out and do experiments. So for instance, you have like gravitationally

50:00.080 --> 50:04.680
 you have an inverse square law forces. Okay, if you had more dimensions, that inverse square

50:04.680 --> 50:09.200
 law would change something else. So you can go and start measuring the inverse square

50:09.200 --> 50:15.560
 law and say, okay, inverse square law is working. But maybe if I get, it turns out to be actually

50:15.560 --> 50:20.520
 kind of very, very hard to measure gravitational effects at even kind of, you know, somewhat

50:20.520 --> 50:25.800
 macroscopic distances because they're so small. So you can start looking at the inverse square

50:25.800 --> 50:31.320
 law and say, start trying to measure it at shorter and shorter distances and see if there

50:31.320 --> 50:35.600
 were extra dimensions at those distance scales, you would start to see the inverse square

50:35.600 --> 50:42.160
 law fail. And so people look for that. And again, you don't see it. But you can, I mean,

50:42.160 --> 50:47.480
 there's all sorts of experiments of this kind, you can imagine which test for effects of

50:47.480 --> 50:54.760
 extra dimensions at different, at different distance scales, but none of them, I mean,

50:54.760 --> 50:57.520
 they all just don't work.

50:57.520 --> 51:03.000
 Nothing yet. But you can say, ah, but it's, it's just, it's just much, much smaller. You

51:03.000 --> 51:10.160
 can say that. Which by the way, makes LIGO and the detection of gravitational waves quite

51:10.160 --> 51:17.280
 an incredible project. Ed Whitten is often brought up as one of the most brilliant mathematicians

51:17.280 --> 51:23.840
 and physicists ever. What do you make of him and his work on string theory?

51:23.840 --> 51:29.680
 Well, I think he's a truly remarkable figure. I've, you know, had the pleasure of meeting

51:29.680 --> 51:36.560
 him first when he was a postdoc. And I mean, he's just completely amazing mathematician

51:36.560 --> 51:43.080
 and physicist. And, you know, he's quite a bit smarter than just about any of the rest

51:43.080 --> 51:47.120
 of us and also more hardworking. It's a, it's a kind of frightening combination to see how

51:47.120 --> 51:53.160
 much he's been able to do. And, but I would actually argue that, you know, his, his greatest

51:53.160 --> 51:57.360
 work, the things that he's done that have been of just this mind blowing significance

51:57.360 --> 52:03.320
 of giving us, I mean, he's completely revolutionized some areas of mathematics. He's totally revolutionized

52:03.320 --> 52:09.720
 the way we understand the relations between mathematics and physics. And most of those,

52:09.720 --> 52:14.800
 his greatest work is stuff that doesn't have as little or nothing to do with string theory.

52:14.800 --> 52:19.680
 I mean, for instance, he, you know, he, so he was actually one of fields. The very strange

52:19.680 --> 52:24.640
 thing about him in some sense is that he, he doesn't have a Nobel Prize. So there, there's

52:24.640 --> 52:29.480
 a very large number of people who are nowhere near as smart as he is and don't work anywhere

52:29.480 --> 52:34.320
 near as hard who have Nobel Prizes. I think he just had the misfortune of coming into

52:34.320 --> 52:39.040
 the field at a time when things had gotten much, much, much tougher and nobody really

52:39.040 --> 52:44.040
 had, no matter how smart you were, it was very hard to come up with a new idea that

52:44.040 --> 52:49.640
 it was going to work physically and get you a Nobel Prize. But he, but he, you know, he,

52:49.640 --> 52:55.520
 he had got a Fields Medal for a certain work he did in, in mathematics. And that's just

52:55.520 --> 52:59.240
 completely unheard of, you know, for mathematicians to give a Fields Medal to someone outside

52:59.240 --> 53:05.520
 their field and physics is really, you know, you wouldn't have before he came around. I

53:05.520 --> 53:07.840
 don't think anybody would have thought that was even conceivable.

53:07.840 --> 53:14.800
 So you're saying is he came into the field of theoretical physics at a time when, and

53:14.800 --> 53:20.000
 still to today is you can't get a Nobel Prize for purely theoretical work.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.840
 The specific problem of trying to do better than the standard, the standard model is just

53:24.840 --> 53:30.920
 this insanely successful thing. And it kind of came together in 1973 pretty much. And

53:30.920 --> 53:36.000
 post and so, and all of the people who kind of were involved in that coming together,

53:36.000 --> 53:41.640
 you know, many of them ended up with Nobel Prizes for that. But, but if you look post

53:41.640 --> 53:48.160
 1973 pretty much, it's a little bit more, there's some edge cases if you like, but the,

53:48.160 --> 53:53.800
 if you look post 1973 at what people have done to try to do better than the standard

53:53.800 --> 53:58.480
 model and to get a better, you know, idea, it really hasn't, it's been too hard a problem.

53:58.480 --> 54:03.080
 It hasn't worked. The theory is too good. And so it's not that other people went out

54:03.080 --> 54:08.080
 there and did it and not him and that they got Nobel Prizes for doing it. It's just that

54:08.080 --> 54:12.360
 no one really, the kind of thing he's been trying to do with string theory is not, um,

54:12.360 --> 54:14.280
 no one has been able to do since 1973.

54:14.280 --> 54:19.280
 Is there something you can say about the standard model? So the four laws of physics that seems

54:19.280 --> 54:26.800
 to work very well. And yet people are striving to do more talking about unification. So on

54:26.800 --> 54:32.080
 why, what's wrong, what's broken about the standard model? Why, why does it need to be

54:32.080 --> 54:33.080
 improved?

54:33.080 --> 54:39.280
 I mean, the thing that gets most attention is, um, is gravity that we have trouble. Um,

54:39.280 --> 54:44.600
 so you want to, you want to in some sense integrate, integrate what we know about the

54:44.600 --> 54:49.480
 gravitational force with it and have a unified quantum field theory that has gravitational

54:49.480 --> 54:54.760
 interactions also. So that's the big problem. Everybody talks about, um, I mean, but it,

54:54.760 --> 54:58.360
 but it's also true that if you look at the standard model, it has these very, very deep

54:58.360 --> 55:06.800
 beautiful ideas, but there's certain aspects of it that are very, that are, let's, let's

55:06.800 --> 55:11.440
 just say that they're not beautiful. They're not, um, you have to, to make the thing work,

55:11.440 --> 55:16.680
 you have to throw in lots and lots of extra parameters at various points. Um, and a lot

55:16.680 --> 55:20.720
 of this has to do with the so called, uh, you know, the so called Higgs mechanism in

55:20.720 --> 55:26.680
 the Higgs field that if you look at the theory, it's everything is, if you forget about the

55:26.680 --> 55:33.400
 Higgs field and what it needs to do, the rest of the theory is, um, is very, very constrained

55:33.400 --> 55:37.000
 and has very, very few free parameters, really a very small number. There's a very small

55:37.000 --> 55:41.680
 number of parameters and a few integers which tell you what the theory is to make this work

55:41.680 --> 55:46.960
 as a theory, the real world. You need a Higgs field and you need to, it needs to do, to

55:46.960 --> 55:53.760
 do something. And once you introduce that Higgs field, all sorts of parameters, um,

55:53.760 --> 55:58.840
 make it apparent. So now when we've got 20 or 30 or whatever, whatever parameters that

55:58.840 --> 56:02.240
 are going to tell you what all the masses of things are and what's going to happen.

56:02.240 --> 56:08.600
 So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing with a couple of parameters to, uh,

56:08.600 --> 56:13.600
 this thing, which the minute you put it in, you had to add all this extra, all these extra

56:13.600 --> 56:19.440
 parameters to make things work. And so that, it may be one argument as well, that's just

56:19.440 --> 56:24.160
 the way the world is. And the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing is

56:24.160 --> 56:28.920
 just your problem or maybe we live in a multiverse and those numbers are just different in every

56:28.920 --> 56:34.920
 universe. But, but, you know, another reasonable conjecture is just that, well, this is just

56:34.920 --> 56:39.840
 telling us that there's something we don't understand about what's going on in a deeper

56:39.840 --> 56:44.720
 way, which would explain those numbers. And there's some kind of deeper idea about where

56:44.720 --> 56:49.120
 the Higgs field comes from and what's going on, which we haven't figured out yet. And

56:49.120 --> 56:52.920
 that that's, that's what we should look for.

56:52.920 --> 56:59.480
 But to stick on string theory a little bit longer, could you play devil's advocate and

56:59.480 --> 57:06.080
 try to argue for string theory? Why it is something that deserve the effort that it

57:06.080 --> 57:12.000
 got and still can, like if you think of it as a flame, still should be a little flame

57:12.000 --> 57:13.880
 that keeps, keeps burning.

57:13.880 --> 57:19.840
 Well, I think the, I mean, the most positive argument for it is all the, you know, all

57:19.840 --> 57:24.880
 sorts of new ideas about mathematics and about parts of physics really emerge from it. So

57:24.880 --> 57:30.000
 it was very a fruitful source of ideas. And I think, you know, this is actually one argument

57:30.000 --> 57:33.600
 you'll definitely, which I kind of agree with all here from, from Whitton and from other

57:33.600 --> 57:38.800
 string theorists, you know, this is, this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea.

57:38.800 --> 57:42.520
 And it's led to so many other different things coming out of it that, you know, there must

57:42.520 --> 57:48.280
 be something right about this. And that's, you know, okay, that anyway, I think that

57:48.280 --> 57:52.280
 that's probably the strong, the strongest thing that they, that they've got.

57:52.280 --> 58:00.040
 But you, you don't think there's aspects to it that could be neighboring to, to, to a

58:00.040 --> 58:04.680
 theory that does unify everything, to a theory of everything, like it could, it may not be

58:04.680 --> 58:13.000
 exactly, exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer might get us closer to the theory

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
 of everything.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.640
 Well, the problem with it now really is that you really don't know what it is now. You've

58:17.640 --> 58:25.040
 never, nobody has ever kind of come up with this nonperturbative theory. So it's, it's

58:25.040 --> 58:30.240
 become more and more frustrating and an odd activity to try to argue with string theorists

58:30.240 --> 58:37.840
 about string theory, because it's become less and less well defined what it is. And it's

58:37.840 --> 58:42.880
 become actually more and more kind of a, whether you have this weird phenomenon of people calling

58:42.880 --> 58:47.680
 themselves string theorists when they've never actually worked on any theory, were there

58:47.680 --> 58:49.640
 any strings anywhere.

58:49.640 --> 58:55.160
 So what has actually happened kind of sociologically is that you started out with this fairly well

58:55.160 --> 59:00.440
 defined proposal. And then I would argue, because that didn't work, people and branched

59:00.440 --> 59:03.880
 out in all sorts of directions doing all sorts of things that became farther and farther

59:03.880 --> 59:12.880
 removed from that. And for sociological reasons, the ones who kind of started out or now are,

59:12.880 --> 59:19.080
 or were trained by the people who worked on that have now become this string, string theorists.

59:19.080 --> 59:27.240
 And, and, but, but it's becoming almost more kind of a tribal denominator than a, so it's

59:27.240 --> 59:30.280
 very hard to know what you're arguing about when you're arguing about string theory these

59:30.280 --> 59:31.280
 days.

59:31.280 --> 59:34.560
 Well, to push back on that a little bit, I mean, string theory, it's just a term, right?

59:34.560 --> 59:40.960
 It doesn't, like you could, like this is the way language evolves is it could start to represent

59:40.960 --> 59:47.680
 something more than just the theory that involves strings, it could represent the effort to unify

59:47.680 --> 59:49.720
 the laws of physics, right?

59:49.720 --> 59:50.720
 Yeah.

59:50.720 --> 59:56.160
 At, at high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right? Or something like that. I

59:56.160 --> 1:00:01.280
 mean, we can sort of put string theory aside. So for example, neural networks in the space

1:00:01.280 --> 1:00:06.200
 of machine learning, there was a time when they were extremely popular, they became much,

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:09.240
 much less popular to a point where if you mentioned neural networks, you're getting

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:15.600
 no funding and you're not going to be respected at conferences. And then once again, neural

1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:21.920
 networks became all the, all the rage about 10, 15 years ago, and as it goes up and down

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:26.880
 and a lot of people would argue that using terminology like machine learning and deep

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:34.560
 learning is, is, you know, often misused over general, you know, everything that works is

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:38.600
 deep learning, everything that doesn't, isn't something like that. You know, that's just

1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:44.320
 the way, again, we're back to sociological things. But I guess what I'm trying to get

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:53.160
 at is if we leave the sociological mess aside, do we throw out the baby with the bathwater?

1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:59.280
 Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas from the admittance of the world,

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:07.520
 is there some core truths there that we should stick by in, in, in the full, beautiful mess

1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:11.040
 of a space that we call string theory, that people call string theory?

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:16.520
 You're right. It is kind of a common problem that, you know, how what you're, what you

1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:22.840
 call some field changes and evolves and in interesting ways as, as the field changes.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:29.960
 But I mean, I guess what I would argue is the, you know, the initial understanding of

1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.800
 string theory that was quite specific, we're talking about a specific idea, 10 dimensional

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:40.600
 super strings compactified as six dimensions. That, to my mind, the, the really bad thing

1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:46.040
 that's happened to the subject is that you, it's hard to get people to admit at least

1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:51.560
 publicly that that was a failure, that this really didn't work. And so de facto, what

1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:55.600
 people do is people will stop doing that and they start doing more interesting things.

1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:02.200
 But they keep talent talking to the public about, about string theory and referring

1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:07.720
 back to that idea and using that as kind of the starting point and as kind of the place

1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:13.680
 where the whole, where the whole tribe starts and everything else comes from. And so the

1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:19.440
 problem with this is that having as your, as your initial name and what everything points

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:27.440
 back to something which, which really didn't work out, it kind of makes everybody makes

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:31.360
 everything you've created this potentially very, very interesting field with interesting

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:37.360
 things happening. But, you know, people in high, in graduate school take courses on string

1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:40.880
 theory and everything kind of, and this is what you tell the public in which you continually

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:45.040
 pointing back. So you're continually pointing back to this idea which never worked out as

1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:52.840
 your guiding inspiration. And it really kind of deforms the whole, your whole way of your,

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:57.160
 your hopes of making progress. And that's to me, I think, you know, the kind of worst

1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:59.040
 thing that's happened in this field.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:04.120
 Because sure. So there's a lack of transparency, sort of authenticity about communicating the

1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:10.880
 things that failed in the past. And so you don't have a clear picture of like firm ground

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:17.480
 that you're standing on. But again, those are sociological things. And I, there's a

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:25.760
 bunch of questions I want to ask you. So one, what's your intuition about why the original

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:31.720
 idea failed? So what can you say about why you're pretty sure it has failed?

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:36.800
 You know, and the initial idea was, as I try to explain it, it was quite seductive in

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:43.640
 that, that you could see why Whitton and others got excited by it. It was, you know, at the

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:47.720
 time it looked like there were only a few of these possible clobby hours that would work.

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:52.320
 And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand this very specific model in these

1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:56.200
 very specific six dimensional spaces, and we're going to get everything. And so it was

1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:03.360
 a very seductive idea. But it just, you know, as people learn more and more about it, it

1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:08.080
 just didn't, they just kind of realized that there are just more and more things you can

1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:12.440
 do with these six dimensions and you can't, and this is just not going to work.

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:23.200
 Meaning like it's, I mean, what was the failure mode here is you could just have an infinite

1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:26.880
 number of possibilities that you could do. So it's, you can come up with any theory you

1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:31.520
 want, you can fit quantum mechanics, you can, you can explain gravity, you can explain anything

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:34.280
 you want with it. Is that the basic failure mode?

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:39.520
 Yeah. So it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea ended up being kind of being essentially

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:44.400
 empty that it just didn't, doesn't end up not telling you anything because it's consistent

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:50.560
 with just about just about anything. And so I mean, there's a complex, if you try and

1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:53.560
 talk with string theorists about this now, I mean, there's a, there's an argument, there's

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:58.880
 a long argument over this about whether, you know, oh no, no, no, maybe there's still our

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:03.560
 constraints coming, coming out of this idea or not. And, or maybe we live in a multiverse

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:09.680
 and, you know, every, everything is true anyway. So you can, there are various ways you can

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:13.000
 kind of, the string theorists have kind of react, react to this kind of argument that

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:17.280
 I'm making, try to hold on to it.

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:25.960
 What about experimental validation? Is that, is that a fair standard to hold before a theory

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:28.680
 of everything that's trying to unify quantum mechanics and gravity?

1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:35.240
 Yeah, I mean, ultimately to be really convinced that, you know, that on some new, you know,

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:39.280
 idea about invocation really works, you need some kind of, you need to look at the real

1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:45.280
 world and see that this is telling you something, something true about it. I mean, you know,

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:50.840
 either, either telling you that if you do some experiment and go out and do it, you'll

1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:57.320
 get some unexpected result and that's the kind of gold standard or it may be just like

1:05:57.320 --> 1:06:01.000
 all those numbers that are, we don't know how to explain it, it will show you how to

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:05.320
 calculate them. I mean, you can, it can be various kinds of experimental validation,

1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:08.760
 but that, that's certainly ideally what you're looking for.

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:12.920
 How tough is this, do you think? For theory of everything, not just string theory. So

1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:17.600
 for something that unifies gravity and quantum mechanics, so the very big and the very small,

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:26.400
 is this a, let me ask it one way, is it a physics problem, a math problem, or an engineering

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:28.200
 problem?

1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:34.120
 My guess is it's a combination of a physics and a math problem that you really need. It's,

1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:38.560
 it's not really engineering. It's not like there's some kind of well defined thing you

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:43.440
 can write down and we just don't have enough computer power to do the calculation. That's

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:48.520
 not the kind of problem it is at all. But the question is, you know, what mathematical

1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:55.120
 tools you need to properly formulate the problem is unclear. So one reasonable conjecture

1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:01.800
 is the way the reason that we haven't had any success yet is just that we're missing either

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:07.400
 or missing certain physical ideas or missing certain mathematical tools, which are some

1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:12.640
 combination of them, which would, which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:16.800
 and see, and see that it, it has a solution that looks like the real world.

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:25.400
 But those you need, I guess you don't, but there's a sense that you need both gravity,

1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:30.160
 all the laws of physics to be operating on the same level. So it feels like you need

1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:38.880
 an object like a black hole or something like that in order to make predictions about. Otherwise,

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:45.440
 you're always making predictions about this joint phenomena. Or can you do that as long

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:48.840
 as the theory is consistent and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?

1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:52.480
 Well, your theory should, I mean, if your theory is going to include gravity, our current

1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:57.600
 understanding of gravity is that you should have, there should be black hole states in

1:07:57.600 --> 1:08:02.600
 it, you should be able to describe black holes in this theory. And, and just one aspect that

1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:07.920
 people have concentrated a lot on is just this kind of questions about if your theory

1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:12.160
 includes black holes like it's supposed to, and it includes quantum mechanics, then there's

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:15.840
 certain kind of paradoxes which come up. And so that's, that's been a huge focus of

1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:19.240
 kind of quantum gravity work, work has been just those paradoxes.

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:27.400
 So stepping outside of string theory, can you just say first at a high level, what is

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.040
 the theory of everything? What is the theory of everything seek to accomplish?

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:36.400
 Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist point of view in the sense that

1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:42.640
 so it's not a theory. This is not going to explain to you, you know, anything, it doesn't

1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:45.960
 really, this kind of theory, theory, this kind of theory of everything we're talking

1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:51.040
 about doesn't say anything interesting, particularly about like macroscopic objects about what

1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:54.920
 the weather is going to be tomorrow or, you know, things are happening at this scale.

1:08:54.920 --> 1:09:01.920
 But just what we've discovered is that as you look at the universe that kind of, you

1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:07.040
 know, if you kind of start, you can start breaking it apart into, and you end up with

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:11.920
 some fairly simple pieces, quanta, if you like, and which are doing, which are interacting

1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:17.440
 in some fairly, in some fairly simple way. And it's some, it's good. So what we mean

1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:25.320
 by theory of everything is a theory that describes all, all the object, all the correct objects

1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:29.640
 you need to describe what's happening in the world and describes how they're interacting

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:35.480
 with each other at a most fundamental level. How you get from that theory to describing

1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:40.680
 some macroscopic incredibly complicated thing is there that becomes, again, more of an engineering

1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:44.440
 problem and you may need machine learning or you made, you know, a lot of very different

1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:45.440
 things to do it.

1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:54.280
 But I don't even think it's just engineering. It's also science. One thing that I find kind

1:09:54.280 --> 1:10:07.440
 of interesting talking to physicists is a little bit, there's a little bit of hubris.

1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.560
 Some of the most brilliant people I know are physicists, both philosophy and just in terms

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:16.360
 of mathematics in terms of understanding the world. But there's a kind of either a hubris

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:22.920
 or what would I call it, like a confidence that if we have a theory of everything, we

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:28.000
 will understand everything. Like this is the deepest thing to understand. And I would say

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:35.880
 and like the rest is details, right? That's the old Rutherford thing. But to me, there's

1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:40.620
 like this is like a cake or something. There's layers to this thing and each one has a theory

1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:51.000
 of everything. Like at every level from biology, like how life originates, that itself like

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:58.000
 complex systems. Like that in itself is like this gigantic thing that requires a theory

1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:04.000
 of everything. And then there's the what in the space of humans, psychology, like intelligence,

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.120
 collective intelligence, the way it emerges among species, that feels like a complex system

1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:14.920
 that requires its own theory of everything. On top of that is things like in the computing

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:19.680
 space, artificial intelligence systems, like that feels like a user theory of everything.

1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:27.120
 And it's almost like once we solve, once we come up with a theory of everything that explains

1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:32.680
 the basic laws of physics that gave us the universe, even stuff that's super complex,

1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:38.360
 like how like how the universe might be able to originate, even explaining something that

1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:43.240
 you're not a big fan of like multiverses or stuff that we don't have any evidence of yet.

1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:52.160
 So we won't be able to have a strong explanation of why food tastes delicious.

1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:58.240
 Oh yeah. No. Anyway, I agree completely. I mean, there is something kind of completely

1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:02.760
 wrong with this terminology of theory of everything. It's not, it's really in some

1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:11.200
 sense very bad term, very heuristic and bad terminology because it's not. This is explaining,

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:16.280
 this is a purely kind of reductionist point of view that you're trying to understand certain

1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:26.000
 very specific kind of things, which in principle, other things emerge from. But to actually understand

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:33.080
 how anything emerges from this, it can't be understood in terms of this underlying

1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:39.720
 fund wealth area is going to be hopeless in terms of kind of telling you what about this

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:43.120
 various emergent behavior. And as you go to different levels of explanation, you're

1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:46.720
 going to need to develop different, completely different ideas, completely different ways

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:53.080
 of thinking. And I guess there's a famous kind of Phil Andersen's slogan is that more

1:12:53.080 --> 1:13:00.600
 is different. And so it's just, even once you understand how what a couple of things,

1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.160
 if you have a collection of stuff and you understand perfectly well how each thing is

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:09.320
 interacting with it, with the others, what the whole thing is going to do is just a completely

1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:12.560
 different problem than it's just not. And you need completely different ways of thinking

1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:13.560
 about it.

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.880
 What do you think about this? I got to ask you at a few different attempts at a theory

1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:24.040
 of everything, especially recently. So I've been, for many years, a big fan of cellular

1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:29.400
 automata of complex systems. And obviously, because of that, a fan of Stephen Wolfram's

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:35.320
 work on in that space, but he's recently been talking about a theory of everything through

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:42.680
 his physics project, essentially. What do you think about this kind of discrete theory

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:48.080
 of everything, like from simple rules and simple objects on the hypergraphs, emerges

1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:52.800
 all of our reality where time and space are emergent, basically everything we see around

1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:53.800
 us is emerging.

1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:58.600
 Yeah. I have to say, unfortunately, I've kind of pretty much zero sympathy for that. I mean,

1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:03.640
 I don't, I spent a little time looking at it and I just don't see, it doesn't seem to

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:09.920
 me to get anywhere. And it really is just really, really doesn't agree at all with what

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:14.360
 I'm seeing, this kind of unification of math and physics that I'm kind of talking about

1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:20.000
 around certain kinds of very deep ideas about geometry and stuff. This, if you want to believe

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:26.800
 that your things are really coming out of cellular automata at the most fundamental level,

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:33.920
 you have to believe that everything that I've seen my whole career and as beautiful, powerful

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:38.800
 ideas that that's all just kind of a mirage, which just kind of randomly is emerging from

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:44.200
 these more basic, very, very simple minded things. And you have to give me some serious

1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:46.280
 evidence for that and I'm saying nothing.

1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:53.880
 So mirage, you don't think there could be a consistency where things like quantum mechanics

1:14:53.880 --> 1:15:00.000
 could emerge from much, much, much smaller, discrete, like computational type systems?

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.240
 Well, I think from the point of view of certain mathematical point of view, quantum mechanics

1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:12.840
 is already mathematically as simple as it gets. It really is a story about really the

1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:16.880
 fundamental objects that you work with and when you write down a quantum theory are in

1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:22.160
 some, in some form point of view, precisely the fundamental objects at the deepest levels

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:27.360
 of mathematics that you're working with are exactly the same. And cellular automata are

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:31.240
 something completely different, which don't fit into these structures. And so I just don't

1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:38.320
 see why. Anyway, I don't see it as a promising thing to do. And then just looking at it and

1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:43.000
 saying, does this go anywhere? Does this solve any problem that I've ever, that I didn't,

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.360
 does this solve any problem of any kind? I just don't see it.

1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:54.240
 Yeah, to me, cellular automata and these hypergraphs, I'm not sure solving a problem is even the

1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:59.960
 standard to apply here at this moment. To me, the fascinating thing is that the question

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:05.240
 it asks have no good answers. So there's not good math explaining, forget the physics

1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:11.640
 of it, math explaining the behavior of complex systems. And that to me is both exciting and

1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:18.440
 paralyzing. Like we're at the very early days of understanding, you know, how complicated

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:21.160
 and fascinating things emerge from simple rules.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:26.640
 Yeah, you know, I agree. I think that is a truly a great problem. And depending where

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:34.720
 it goes, it may be, you know, it may start to develop some kind of connections to the

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:40.800
 things that I've kind of found more fruitful and hard to know. It just, I think a lot of

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:46.880
 that area, I kind of strongly feel I best not say too much about it, because I just,

1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:51.520
 I don't know too much about it. And I mean, again, we're back to this original problem

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:55.480
 that, you know, your time in life is limited. You have to figure out what you're going to

1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:59.800
 spend your time thinking about. And that's something I just never seen enough to convince

1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:01.360
 me to spend more time thinking about.

1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:05.960
 Well, also timing, it's not just that our time is limited, but the timing of the kind

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:10.160
 of things you think about there. There's some aspect to cellular automata, these kinds

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:17.240
 of objects that it feels like we're very many years away from having big breakthroughs

1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:22.200
 on. And so it's like, you have to pick the problems that are solvable today. In fact,

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:30.600
 my intuition, again, not perhaps biased is it feels like the kind of systems that complex

1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:37.040
 systems that cellular automata are would not be solved by human brains. It feels like,

1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:43.360
 well, like it feels like something post human that will solve that problem, or like significantly

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:50.160
 enhance humans, meaning like using computational tools, very powerful computational tools to

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:58.840
 us to crack these problems open. That's, that's if our approach to science, our ability to

1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:03.040
 understand science, our ability to understand physics will become more and more computational,

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:09.120
 or there'll be a whole field as computational nature, which currently is not the case. Currently,

1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:15.040
 computation is the thing that sort of assists us in understanding science the way we've

1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:19.760
 been doing it all along. But if there's a whole new, I mean, that we're from new kind

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:26.560
 of science, right? It's a little bit dramatic. But, you know, this, if computers could do

1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:35.600
 science on their own computational systems, perhaps that's the way they would do the science.

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:39.080
 They would try to understand the cellular automata. And that feels like we're decades

1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:45.760
 away. So perhaps it'll crack open some interesting facets of this physics problem, but it's very

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:48.080
 far away. So timing is everything.

1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:49.840
 That's perfectly possible.

1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:56.640
 Well, let me ask you then in the space of geometry, I don't know how well, you know,

1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:57.640
 Erich Weinstein.

1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:00.240
 Oh, quite well.

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:04.840
 What are your thoughts about his geometric community and the space of ideas that he's

1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:09.840
 playing with on, in his proposal for theory or everything?

1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:16.560
 Well, I think that he has, he fundamentally has, I think, the same problems that everybody

1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:20.880
 has had trying to do this. And, you know, there are various, there are really versions

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:27.880
 of the same problem that you try to, you try to get unity by putting everything into some

1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:33.960
 bigger structure. So he has some other ones that are not so conventional that he's trying

1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:42.720
 to work with. But he has the same problem that even if he can, if he can get a lot farther

1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:48.840
 in terms of having a really well defined, well understood, clear picture of these things

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:54.040
 he is working with, they're really kind of large geometrical structures with many dimensions,

1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:58.880
 many kinds. And I just don't see any way he's going to have the same problem the string

1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:04.160
 there has had. How do you get back down to the structures of the standard model? And

1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:12.800
 how do you, yeah, so I just, anyway, it's the same, and there's another interesting

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:18.840
 example of a similar kind of thing is Garrett Luzi's theory of everything. Again, it's

1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:25.200
 a little bit more specific than Eric's, he's working with this E8. But again, I think all

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:30.880
 these things founder at the same point that you don't, you know, you create this unity,

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:36.920
 but then you have no, you don't actually have a good idea how you're going to get back to

1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:44.000
 the actual, to the objects we're seeing, how are you going to, you create these big symmetries,

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.160
 how are you going to break them? And because we don't see those symmetries in the real

1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:55.080
 world. And so ultimately, there would need to be a simple process for collapsing it to

1:20:55.080 --> 1:21:00.160
 four dimensions. You'd have to explain, well, yeah, and I forget in his case, but it's not

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:05.600
 just four dimensions. It's also these, these structures you see in the standard model, there's

1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:11.480
 a, you know, there's certain very small dimensional groups of symmetries called U1, SU2 and SU3.

1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:16.040
 And the problem with, and this has been the problem since the beginning, almost immediately

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:21.280
 after 1973, about a year later, two years later, people started talking about grand unified

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:27.200
 theories. So you take the U1, the SU2 and the SU3, and you put them in together into

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:33.560
 this bigger structure called the SU5 or SO10. But then you're stuck with this problem that,

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:40.640
 wait a minute, how, why does the world not look, why do I not see these SU5 symmetries

1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:47.440
 in real world? I only see these. And so, and, and, and I think, you know, those, the kind

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.640
 of thing that, that, that Eric and all of a sudden Garrett and lots of people who try

1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:56.200
 to do it, they all kind of found her in that same, in that same way that they don't have,

1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:57.520
 they don't have a good answer to that.

1:21:57.520 --> 1:22:03.160
 Are there lessons, ideas to be learned from theories like that from Garrett Leases from

1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:04.160
 Eric's?

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:10.240
 Um, I don't know. It depends. I have to confess, I haven't looked that closely at, at, at,

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:14.480
 at, at Eric's. I mean, he explained to this to me personally a few times and I looked

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:19.800
 a bit at his paper, but it's, um, again, we're, we're, we're back to the problem of a limited

1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:21.320
 amount of time in life.

1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:30.080
 Yeah. I mean, it's an interesting effect, right? Why don't more physicists look at it?

1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:42.520
 They're, I mean, I, I'm, I'm in this position that somehow, you know, uh, I've, I've, uh,

1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:47.720
 people write me emails for whatever reason. And I had worked in the space of AI and this

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.400
 is, there's a lot of people, perhaps AI is even way more accessible than physics in a

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:56.280
 certain sense. And so a lot of people write to me with different theories about what they

1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:02.440
 have for how to create general intelligence. And it's again, a little bit of an excuse I

1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:07.400
 say to myself, like, well, I only have a limited amount of time. So that's why I'm not investigating

1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:13.480
 it. But I wonder if, um, there's ideas out there that are still powerful. They're still

1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:21.800
 fascinating. And that I'm missing because I'm, because I'm dismissing them because they're

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:26.160
 outside of the sort of the usual process of, uh, academic research.

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:30.080
 Yeah. Well, I mean, I have the same thing and pretty much every day in my email, there's

1:23:30.080 --> 1:23:37.480
 a, somebody's got a theory or everything about why all of what physicists are doing, perhaps

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.640
 the most disturbing thing I should say about my critique being a critic of string theory

1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:46.840
 is, is it when you realize who your fans are, um, that they, every day I hear from somebody

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:50.080
 said, Oh, well, since you don't like string theory, you must of course agree with me that

1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:56.640
 this is the right way to think about everything. Oh no. Oh no. And you know, most of these

1:23:56.640 --> 1:24:01.080
 are, you know, you quickly can see this is person doesn't know very much and doesn't

1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:05.440
 know what they're doing. You know, but there's a whole continuum to, you know, people who

1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:10.360
 are quite serious physicists and mathematicians who are making a fairly serious attempt to

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:16.200
 try to, to do something and like, like Eric and, uh, and Eric. And then, then your, your

1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:21.560
 problem is, you know, you spent, you, you do, so I want to try to spend more time looking

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:25.840
 at it and try to figure out what they're really doing. And, but then at some point you just

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:28.640
 realized, wait a minute, you know, for me to really, really understand exactly what's

1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:33.240
 going on here would just take time. I just don't have.

1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:39.520
 Yeah. It takes a long time, which is the nice thing about AI is unlike the kind of physics

1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:47.160
 we're talking about, if your idea is good, that should quite naturally lead to you being

1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:51.720
 able to build a system that's intelligent. So you don't need to get approval from say

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:56.240
 somebody that's saying you have a good idea here. You can just utilize that idea and engineer

1:24:56.240 --> 1:25:01.880
 system like naturally leads to engineering with physics here. If you have a perfect theory

1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:10.640
 that explains everything that still doesn't obviously lead one to, um, to, to scientific

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.560
 experiments that can validate that theory and two to like, uh, trinkets you can build

1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:18.400
 and sell at a store for $5.

1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:21.280
 I can't make money off of it.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:27.640
 So that, that makes it much, much more challenging. Um, well, let me also ask you about something

1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:34.480
 that you found especially recently appealing, which is Roger Penrose's Twister theory. Um,

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:38.920
 what is it? What kind of questions might it allow us to answer? What will the answers

1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:40.040
 look like?

1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:43.360
 It's only in the last couple of years that I really, really kind of come to really, I

1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:47.680
 think, to appreciate it and to see how to really, I believe to see how to really do something

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:51.840
 with it. And I've gotten very excited about that the last year or two. I mean, one way

1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:58.160
 of saying one idea of Twister theory is that what it's, it's, it's a different way of thinking

1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:03.760
 about what space and time are and about what points in space and time are, but, but which

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:08.360
 only, which is very interesting that it only really works in four dimensions. So four dimensions

1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:13.520
 behaves very, very specially unlike other dimensions. And in four dimensions are certain,

1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:18.000
 there is a way of thinking about space and time geometry where, you know, as well as

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:25.080
 just thinking about points in space and time, you can also think about different objects,

1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:29.960
 these so called twisters. And then when you do that, you end up with a kind of a really

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:36.640
 interesting insight that the, that you can formulate a theory and you can formulate a

1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:41.920
 very, take a standard theory that we formulate in terms of points of space and time. And

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:47.920
 you can reformulate in this Twister language. And in this Twister language, it's be the

1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:52.840
 fundamental objects are actually, are more kind of the, are actually spheres in some

1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:58.120
 sense kind of the light cone. So maybe one way to say it, which, which actually I think

1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:04.440
 is, is really, is quite amazing is if you ask yourself, you know, what do we know about,

1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:09.320
 about the world? We have this idea that the world out there is this, all these different

1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:13.840
 points and these points of time. Well, that's kind of a derived quantity. What really, really

1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:20.120
 know about the world is when we open our eyes, what do you see? You see a sphere. And you,

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:23.800
 and that what you're looking at is you're looking at this, you know, a sphere is worth

1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:30.360
 a light rays coming into, into your eyes. And what Penrose says is that, well, what,

1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:36.920
 what a point in space time is, is that sphere, that sphere of all the light rays coming in.

1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:41.560
 And he says, and you should formulate your, instead of thinking about points, you should

1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:46.760
 think about the space of those spheres, if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom

1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:51.440
 as physics as living on those spheres, living on, so you're kind of, you're kind of living

1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:56.160
 on your degrees of freedom or living on light rays, not on points. And it's a very different

1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:02.680
 way of thinking about, about, about physics. And you know, he and others working with him

1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:08.520
 developed a, you know, a beautiful mathematical, this beautiful mathematical formalism and

1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:13.040
 a way to go back from forth between our kind of some aspects of our standard way we write

1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:19.360
 these things down and work in the so called twister space. And, you know, they, certain

1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:24.000
 things worked out very well, but they ended up, you know, I think kind of stuck by the

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:30.240
 80s or 90s that they weren't a little bit like string theory that they, they, by using

1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:33.600
 these ideas about twisters, they could develop them in different directions and find all

1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:37.540
 sorts of other interesting things. But they were, they were getting, they weren't finding

1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:43.320
 any way of doing that, that brought them back to kind of new insights into physics.

1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:48.360
 And my own, I mean, what's kind of gotten me excited really is what I think I have an,

1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:53.560
 an idea about that I think does actually, does actually work that goes more in that

1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:57.960
 direction. And I can, can go on about that endlessly or talk a little bit about it. But

1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:05.400
 that's the, I think that that's the one kind of easy to explain insight about twister theory.

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:09.320
 There's some more technical ones. I should, I mean, I think it's also very convincing

1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:12.760
 what it tells you about spinners, for instance, but that's a more technical.

1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:18.760
 Well, first let's like linger on the spheres and the light cones. You're saying twisted

1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:23.840
 theory allows you to make that the fundamental object with which you're operating.

1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:24.840
 Yeah.

1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:33.200
 How that, I mean, first of all, like philosophically, that's weird and beautiful. Maybe because

1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:40.880
 it maps, it feels like it moves us so much closer to the way human brains perceive reality.

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:51.840
 So it's almost like our perception is like the, the content of our perception is the

1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:56.040
 fundamental object of reality. That's very appealing.

1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:57.040
 Yeah.

1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:05.720
 Is it mathematically powerful? Is there something you can say, can you say a little bit more

1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:11.160
 about what the heck that even means for, because it's much easier to think about mathematically

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:16.960
 like a point in space time. Like, what does it mean to be operating on the light cone?

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:21.040
 It uses a kind of mathematics that's relative, that, you know, what was kind of goes back

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:26.520
 to the 19th century and mathematicians. It's not, anyway, it's a bit of a long story.

1:30:26.520 --> 1:30:30.760
 The one problem is that you have to start, it's crucial that you think in terms of complex

1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:36.440
 numbers and not just real numbers. And this, for most people, that makes it harder to,

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:40.120
 for mathematicians, that's fine. We love doing that. But for most people, that makes it harder

1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:41.120
 to think about.

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:46.640
 But I think perhaps the most, the way that there is something you can say very specifically

1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:50.480
 about it, you know, in terms of spinners, which I don't know if you want to, I think

1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:51.480
 at some point, you want to talk.

1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:52.480
 Yeah.

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:53.480
 What are spinners?

1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:57.320
 I'll start with spinner, because I think that if we can introduce that, then I can say...

1:30:57.320 --> 1:31:03.880
 By the way, twister is spelled with an O and spinner is spelled with an O as well.

1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:04.880
 Yes.

1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:05.880
 Okay.

1:31:05.880 --> 1:31:06.880
 So...

1:31:06.880 --> 1:31:09.840
 In case you want to Google it and look it up, there's very nice Wikipedia pages. That's

1:31:09.840 --> 1:31:13.360
 the starting point. I don't know what is a good starting point for twister 3.

1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:14.360
 Oh, what?

1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:18.200
 Well, let me just say about Penrose. I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer and

1:31:18.200 --> 1:31:22.400
 also very good draftsman. He's on drafts. To the extent this is visualizable, he actually

1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:26.520
 has done some very nice drawings. So, I mean, almost anything kind of expository thing you

1:31:26.520 --> 1:31:32.640
 can find in handwriting is a very good place to start. He's a remarkable person.

1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:38.460
 But the... So, spinners are something that independently came out of mathematics and

1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:43.760
 out of physics. And to say where they came out of physics, I mean, what people realized

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:48.480
 when they started looking at elementary particles like electrons or whatever, that there seemed

1:31:48.480 --> 1:31:53.920
 to be... There seemed to be some kind of doubling of the degrees of freedom going on. If you

1:31:53.920 --> 1:31:59.120
 counted what was there in some sense in the way you would expect it and when you started

1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:02.120
 doing quantum mechanics and started looking at elementary particles, there were seem to

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:08.720
 be two degrees of freedom. They're not one. And one way of seeing it was that if you put

1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:14.480
 your electron in a strong magnetic field and ask what was the energy of it, instead of

1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:19.480
 having one energy, it would have two energies. It would be two energy levels. And as you

1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:24.400
 increased magnetic field, the splitting would increase. So, physicists kind of realized

1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:28.160
 that, wait a minute. So, we thought when we were doing... First, we're doing quantum mechanics

1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:33.440
 that the way to describe particles was in terms of wave functions and these wave functions

1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:39.960
 were complex values. Well, if we actually look at particles, that's not right. They're

1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:47.040
 pairs of complex numbers. They're pairs of complex numbers. So, one of the kind of fundamental...

1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:50.760
 From the physics point of view, the fundamental question is, why are all our kind of fundamental

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:59.640
 particles described by pairs of complex numbers? It's just weird. And then you can ask, well,

1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:06.560
 what happens if you take an electron and rotate it? So, how do things move in this pair of

1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:12.560
 complex numbers? Well, now, if you go back to mathematics, what had been understood in

1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:19.160
 mathematics some years earlier, not that many years earlier, was that if you ask very,

1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:25.080
 very generally, think about geometry of three dimensions and ask... And if you think about

1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:29.680
 things that are happening in three dimensions in the standard way, everything... The standard

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:34.720
 way of doing geometry, everything is about vectors. So, if you've taken any mathematics

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:38.280
 classes, you probably see vectors at some point. They're just triplets of numbers tell

1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:44.320
 you what a direction is or how far you're going in three dimensional space. And everything

1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:50.960
 we teach in most standard courses in mathematics is about vectors and things you build out of

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:54.720
 vectors. So, you express everything about geometry in terms of vectors or how they're

1:33:54.720 --> 1:34:02.160
 changing or how you put two of them together and get planes and whatever. But what I'd

1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:09.960
 been realized is that if you ask very, very generally, what are the things that you can

1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:16.480
 kind of consistently think about rotating? So, you ask a technical question, what are

1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:21.520
 the representations of the rotation group? Well, you find that one answer is they're

1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:26.520
 vectors and everything you build out of vectors. But then people found, wait a minute, there's

1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:33.280
 also these other things which you can't build out of vectors, but which you can consistently

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:39.160
 rotate and they're described by pairs of complex numbers by two complex numbers. And they're

1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:46.600
 the spinners also. And you can think of spinners in some sense as more fundamental than vectors

1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:51.280
 because you can build vectors out of spinners. You can take two spinners and make a vector,

1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:59.960
 but if you only have vectors, you can't get spinners. So, there's some kind of lower level

1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:05.080
 of geometry beyond what we thought it was, which was kind of spinner geometry. And this

1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:10.800
 is something which even to this day when we teach graduate courses in geometry, we mostly

1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:17.080
 don't talk about this because it's a bit hard to do correctly. If you start with your whole

1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:23.200
 setup is in terms of vectors, describing things in terms of spinners is a whole different

1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:32.280
 ballgame. But anyway, it was just this amazing fact that this kind of more fundamental piece

1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:36.760
 of geometry spinners and what we were actually seeing, if you look at electron, are one and

1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:45.080
 the same. So, it's kind of a mind blowing thing, but it's very counterintuitive.

1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:50.480
 What are some weird properties of spinners that are counterintuitive?

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:56.400
 There are some things that they do. For instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees,

1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:04.800
 it doesn't come back towards, it becomes minus what it was. So, the way rotations work, there's

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.920
 a kind of a funny sign you have to keep track of in some sense. So, they're kind of too

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:15.280
 valued in another weird way. But the fundamental problem is that it's just not, if you're used

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:20.600
 to visualizing vectors, there's nothing you can do visualizing in terms of vectors that

1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:24.000
 will ever give you a spinner. It just is not going to ever work.

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:29.520
 As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector walking along a mobius strip and it

1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:34.920
 ends up being upside down. But you're saying that doesn't really capture.

1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:40.800
 So, what really captures it, the problem is that it's really the simplest way to describe

1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:45.320
 it is in terms of two complex numbers. And your problem with two complex numbers is that's

1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:52.360
 four real numbers. So, your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space. So, that

1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:58.160
 makes it hard to visualize. And it's crucial that it's not just any four dimensions, it's

1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:02.800
 actually complex numbers. You're really going to use the fact that these are two complex

1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:09.240
 numbers. So, it's very hard to visualize. But to get back to what I think is mind blowing

1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:16.000
 about twisters is that another way of saying this idea about talking about spheres, another

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:20.400
 way of saying the fundamental idea of twister theory is, in some sense, the fundamental

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:30.720
 idea of twister theory is that a point is a two complex dimensional space. And that

1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:36.920
 it lives inside, the space that it lies inside is twister space. So, in the simplest case,

1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:42.720
 twister space is four dimensional. And a point in space time is a two complex dimensional

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:49.080
 subspace of all the four complex dimensions. And as you move around in space time, you're

1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:54.440
 just moving, your planes are just moving around. Okay. And that, but then the

1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:57.000
 So, it's a plane in a four dimensional space.

1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:04.600
 It's a plane complex plane. So, it's two complex dimensions in four complex. But then to me,

1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:09.320
 the mind blowing thing about this, is this then kind of tautologically answers the question

1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:16.200
 is what is a spinner? Well, a spinner is a point. I mean, the space of spinners at a

1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.880
 point is the point. In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes. And you

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:27.040
 want me to, and you're asking what a spinner is. Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that

1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:33.200
 two plane. So, it's, you know, just your whole definition of what a pointed space time was,

1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.880
 just told you what a spinner was. It's they're just, it's the same thing.

1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:41.120
 Yeah, we're trying to project that into a three dimensional space and trying to into it.

1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:48.440
 Yeah. So, the intuition becomes very difficult. But from if you don't, you not using twister

1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:53.840
 theory, you have to kind of go through a certain fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe

1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.760
 spinners to describe electrons. Whereas using twister theory, it's just completely tautological.

1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:06.320
 They're just what you want to describe the electron is fundamentally the way that you're

1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:09.640
 describing the point in space time already. It's just there. So.

1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:15.520
 Do you have a hope you mentioned that you've been you found an appealing recently is it just

1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:19.880
 because of certain aspects of its mathematical beauty or do you actually have a hope that this

1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:25.200
 might lead to a theory of everything? Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope because

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:29.680
 what I've found, I think the thing which I've done, which I don't think as far as I can tell,

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:37.240
 no one had really looked at from this point of view before is has to do with it this question of

1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:44.920
 how do you treat time in your quantum theory? And so there's another long story about how we

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:51.640
 do quantum theories and about how we treat time and quantum theories, which is a long story.

1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.080
 But to make this the short version of it is that what people have found when you try and

1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:05.080
 write down a quantum theory that it's often it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate,

1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:10.120
 whatever you're using your time coordinate and multiply it by the screw to minus one and to

1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:17.920
 make it purely imaginary. And so you all these formulas which you have in your standard theory,

1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:23.760
 if you do that to those, I mean, those formulas have some very strange, strange behavior and

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:29.640
 they're kind of singular. If you ask even some simple questions, you have to very take very

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.080
 delicate singular limits in order to get the correct answer. And you have to take them from

1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:40.520
 the right direction. Otherwise, it doesn't work. Whereas if you just take time, and if you just

1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:46.280
 put a factor of screw to minus one, wherever you see the time coordinate, you end up with much

1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:51.360
 simpler formulas, which are much better behaved mathematically. And what I what I hadn't really

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:56.120
 appreciated until fairly recently is also how dramatically that changes the whole structure

1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:01.800
 of the theory, you end up with a consistent way of talking about these quantum theories. But it

1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:07.040
 has very some very different flavor and very different aspects that I hadn't really appreciated.

1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:13.680
 And in particular, the way the way symmetries act on it is not at all what I originally had

1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:19.880
 expected. And so that's the new thing that I have where I think I think gives you something is to

1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:26.960
 do this move, which people often think of as just kind of a kind of a mathematical trick that you're

1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:31.920
 doing to make some formulas work out nicely. But to take that mathematical trick as really

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:38.520
 fundamental, and turns out in twister theory, allows you to simultaneously talk about your

1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:43.840
 usual time and the time times the square root of minus one, they both fit they both fit very

1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:49.720
 nicely into twister theory. And you end up with some structures which look a lot like the standard

1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:58.600
 models. Well, let me ask you about some Nobel Prizes. Okay. Do you think there will be? There

1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:06.080
 was a bet between me, Joe Kaku and somebody else about John, John Horgan, John Horgan about,

1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:12.440
 by the way, maybe discover a cool website long bets.com or that order. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool.

1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:19.160
 It's cool that you can make a bet with people and then check in 20 years later. That's I really

1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:22.520
 love it. There's a lot of interesting bets on there. Yeah, I would love to participate. But

1:42:22.520 --> 1:42:27.880
 it's interesting to see, you know, time flies. Yeah. And you make a bet about what's going to

1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:32.800
 happen 20 years, you don't realize 20 years just goes like this. Yeah. And then and then you get

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:42.200
 to face and you get to wonder, like, what was that person? What was I thinking that person 20

1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:46.400
 years ago is almost like a different person. What was I thinking back then to think that is

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:53.320
 interesting. But so let me ask you this on record, you know, 20 years from now or some number of

1:42:53.320 --> 1:42:58.280
 years from now, do you think there will be a Nobel Prize given for something directly connected

1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:05.480
 to a first broadly theory of everything? And second, of course, one of the possibilities,

1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:15.520
 one of them, strength theory. Strength theory is definitely not that things have gone. Yeah.

1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:19.120
 So if you were giving financial advice, you would say not to bet on it.

1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:24.160
 No, I do not. And even I actually suspect if you ask strength theory is that question,

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:29.240
 these days you're going to get few of them saying, I mean, if you'd asked them that question 20

1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:33.840
 years ago, again, when Kaku was making this bet, whatever, I think some of them would have taken

1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:38.480
 you up on it. But and certainly back in 1984, a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure. Yeah.

1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:45.480
 But now I get the impression that they've even they realize that things are not looking good,

1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:49.800
 for that particular idea. Again, it depends what you mean by strength theory, whether maybe the

1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:55.280
 term will evolve to mean something else, which, which will work out. But yeah, I don't think

1:43:55.280 --> 1:44:00.080
 that's not going to like it to work out whether something else, I mean, I still think it's

1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:06.000
 relatively unlikely that you'll have any really successful theory of everything. And the main

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:12.120
 problem is just the, it's become so difficult to do experiments that hire energy that we've

1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:20.120
 really lost this ability to kind of get unexpected input from, from experiment. And, and you can,

1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:23.960
 you know, while it's maybe hard to figure out what people's thinking is going to be 20 years

1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:31.040
 from now, looking at, you know, energy particle, energy colliders and their technology, it's

1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:36.000
 actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess what it's going to let what, what you're

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:42.760
 going to be doing 20 years from now. And I think actually, I would actually claim that it's pretty

1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:45.720
 clear what, where you're going to be 20 years from now. And what it's going to be is you're

1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:51.960
 going to have the, you're going to have the LHC, you're going to have a lot more data and order

1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:58.120
 of magnitude or more, or more data from the LHC, but at the same energy, you're not going to,

1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:04.720
 you're not going to see a higher energy accelerator operating successfully in the, in the next 20

1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:10.880
 years. And like maybe machine learning or great sort of data science methodologies that process

1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:18.360
 that data will not reveal any major like shifts in our understanding of the underlying physics,

1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.160
 do you think? I don't think so. I mean, I think that, that, that feel that my understanding is

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:27.880
 that they, they're starting to make a great use of those techniques, but, but it seems to look

1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:32.160
 like it will help them solve certain technical problems and be able to do things somewhat

1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:38.160
 better, but not completely change the way they're looking at things. What do you think about the

1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.640
 potential quantum computer is simulating quantum mechanical systems and through that sneak up

1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:50.760
 to sort of sim, through simulation, sneak up to a deep understanding of the fundamental physics.

1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:58.960
 The problem there is that, that's promising more for this, for, you know, for Phil Anderson's

1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:06.360
 problem that, you know, if you want to, there, there's lots and lots of, if you take, you start

1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:10.960
 pointing together lots and lots of things and we think we know they're pair by pair interactions,

1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:16.480
 but what this thing is going to do, we don't have any good calculational techniques, you know,

1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:21.680
 quantum computers, it may, may very well give you those. And so they may, what we think of as

1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:27.280
 kind of strong coupling behavior, we have no good way to calculate, you know, even though we can

1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:31.720
 write down the theory, we don't know how to calculate anything with any accuracy in it,

1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:36.320
 the quantum computer that may solve that problem. But the problem is that they, I don't, I don't

1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:39.800
 think that they're going to solve the problem, that they help you with a problem of not having

1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:47.280
 their, of knowing what the right underlying theory is. As somebody who likes experimental

1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:52.320
 validation, let me ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding, but I don't think it's actually a

1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:58.120
 ridiculous question of, do you think we live in a simulation? Do you find that thought experiment

1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:06.800
 at all useful or interesting? Not, not, not really. I don't, it just doesn't, yeah, anyway,

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:11.360
 to me, it doesn't actually lead to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere interesting.

1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:18.000
 Yeah, to me, so maybe I'll throw a wrench into your thing. To me, it's super interesting from

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:24.600
 an engineering perspective. So if you look at virtual reality systems, the, the actual

1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:34.360
 question is how much computation and how difficult is it to construct a world that, like, there

1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:41.320
 are several levels here. One is you won't know the different, our human perception systems

1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:44.560
 and maybe even the tools of physics won't know the difference between the simulated

1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:52.160
 world and the real world. That's sort of more of a physics question. The, the most interesting

1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:58.640
 question to me has more to do with why food tastes delicious, which is create how difficult

1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:04.160
 and how much computation is required to construct a simulation where you kind of know it's a

1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:12.200
 simulation at first, but you want to stay there anyway. And over time, you don't even

1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:18.560
 remember. Yeah. Well, anyway, I agree. These are kind of fascinating questions. And they

1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:23.960
 may be very, very relevant to our future as a species, but yeah, they're just very far

1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:24.960
 from anything.

1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:30.840
 But so from a physics perspective, it's not useful to you to think, taking a computational

1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:35.440
 perspective to our universe, thinking of as an information processing system, and then

1:48:35.440 --> 1:48:39.400
 they give it as doing computation. And then you think about the resources required to

1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:43.200
 do that kind of computation and all that kind of stuff. You could just look at the basic

1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:46.680
 physics and who cares what the, the computer that's running on us.

1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:50.680
 Yeah. It just, I mean, the kinds of, I mean, I'm willing to agree that you can get into

1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:54.120
 interesting kinds of questions going down that road, but they're just so different from

1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:59.680
 anything from what I found interesting. And I just, again, I just have to kind of go back

1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:05.400
 to life is too short. And I'm very glad other people are thinking about this, but I just

1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:08.840
 don't see anything I can do with it.

1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:16.080
 What about space itself? So I have to ask you about aliens. Again, something, since

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:21.920
 you emphasize evidence, do you think there is how many, do you think there are and how

1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:25.760
 many intelligent alien civilizations are out there?

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:30.040
 Yeah, I have no idea, but I've certainly, as far as I know, unless the government's

1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:35.120
 covering it up or something, we haven't heard from, we don't have any evidence for such

1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:41.080
 things yet, but there's no, there seems to be no, there's no particular obstruction,

1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:46.760
 why there shouldn't be. So I mean, do you, you work on some fundamental

1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:52.440
 questions about the physics of reality? When you look up to the stars, do you think about

1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:54.760
 whether somebody's looking back at us?

1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:59.160
 Yeah. Well, actually, I originally got interested in physics. I actually started out as a kid

1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:03.000
 interested in astronomy, exactly that and a telescope and whatever that. And certainly

1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:09.960
 read a lot of science fiction and thought about that. I find over the years, I find

1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:15.760
 myself kind of less, anyway, less and less interested in that. Well, just because I don't,

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:20.440
 I kind of don't really know what to do with them. I'm also kind of at some point kind

1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:25.200
 of stopped reading science fiction that much, kind of feeling that there was just two, that

1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:29.760
 the actual science I was kind of learning about was perfectly kind of weird and fascinating

1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:35.080
 and unusual enough and better than any of the stuff that, you know, Isaac Asimov, so

1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:36.560
 why should I?

1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:43.280
 Yeah. And you can mess with the science much more than the, the distant science fiction,

1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:48.720
 the one that's exist in our imagination or the one that exists out there among the stars.

1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:49.720
 Yeah.

1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:54.320
 Well, you mentioned science fiction. You've written quite a few book reviews. I gotta

1:50:54.320 --> 1:51:01.760
 ask you about some books perhaps, if you don't mind, is there one or two books that you would

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:10.000
 recommend to others and maybe if you can, what ideas you drew from them? Either negative

1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000
 recommendations or positive recommendations.

1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:13.000
 Well,

1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:14.880
 Do not read this book for sure.

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:20.160
 Well, I must say, I mean, unfortunately, yeah, you can go to my website and there's

1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:25.440
 a, you can click on book reviews and you can see I've written a lot of, a lot of, I mean,

1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:29.800
 as you can tell from my views about string theory, I'm not a fan of a lot of the kind

1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:36.720
 of popular books about, oh, isn't string theory great? And about, yes, I'm not a fan of a lot

1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:37.720
 of things of that kind.

1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:45.040
 Can I ask you a good question on this, a small tangent? Are you a fan? Can you explore the

1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:55.680
 pros and cons of, forget string theory, sort of science communication, sort of cosmos style,

1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:00.400
 communication of concepts to people that are outside of physics, outside of mathematics,

1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:05.440
 outside of even the sciences, and helping people to sort of dream and fill them with

1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:09.280
 awe about the full range of mysteries in our universe?

1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:14.840
 That's a complicated issue. I think, you know, I certainly go back and go back to like what

1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:19.840
 inspired me and maybe to connect a little bit to this question about books. I mean,

1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:24.760
 certainly when the books, some books that I remember reading when I was a kid were about

1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:28.720
 the early history of quantum mechanics like Heisenberg's books that he wrote about, you

1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:32.200
 know, kind of looking back at telling the history of what happened when he developed

1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:38.080
 quantum mechanics. It's just kind of a totally fascinating, romantic, great story. And those

1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:43.400
 were very inspirational to me. And I would think maybe that other people might also find

1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:44.400
 them that.

1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:48.720
 And that's almost like the human story of the development of the ideas.

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:53.640
 Yeah, the human story. But yeah, just also how, you know, these very, very weird ideas

1:52:53.640 --> 1:52:57.360
 that didn't seem to make sense, how they were struggling with them and how, you know, they

1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:05.040
 actually, anyway, it's, I think it's the period of physics kind of beginning in 1905,

1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:11.360
 like in Einstein and ending up with the war when these things are, get used to, you know,

1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:15.800
 make passively destructive weapons. It's just that totally amazing.

1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:20.680
 So many, so many new ideas. Let me on another tangent on top of a tangent on top of a tangent

1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:29.080
 ask, if we didn't have Einstein, so how does science progress? Is it the lone geniuses?

1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:36.560
 Or is it some kind of weird network of ideas swimming in the air and just kind of the geniuses

1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:42.760
 pop up to catch them and others would anyway? Without Einstein, would we have special relativity,

1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:43.760
 general relativity?

1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:49.680
 I mean, it's an interesting case to case base. I mean, I mean, special special relativity,

1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:55.640
 I think we would have had, I mean, there are other people. Anyway, you could even argue

1:53:55.640 --> 1:53:59.560
 that it was already there in some form and some is, but I think special relativity would

1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:06.880
 have had without Einstein fairly, fairly quickly. General relativity, that was much, much harder

1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:13.040
 thing to do and required a much more effort, much more sophisticated. That, I think he

1:54:13.040 --> 1:54:16.400
 would have had sooner or later, but it would have taken, taken quite a bit longer.

1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:21.800
 That took a bunch of years to validate scientifically the general relativity.

1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:26.120
 But even for Einstein, from the point where he had kind of a general idea of what he was

1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:30.880
 trying to do to the point where he actually had a well defined theory that you could actually

1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:35.440
 compare to the real world, that was, I forget the number of the order of magnitude, ten

1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.280
 years of very serious work. And if he hadn't been around to do that, it would have taken

1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:43.120
 a while before anyone else got around to it.

1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.720
 On the other hand, there are things like, with quantum mechanics, you have Heisenberg

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:57.320
 and Schrodinger came up with two, which ultimately equivalent, but two different approaches to

1:54:57.320 --> 1:55:02.880
 it within months of each other. And so if Heisenberg hadn't been there, he already would

1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:06.080
 have had Schrodinger or whatever. And if neither of them had been there, it would have been

1:55:06.080 --> 1:55:13.160
 somebody else a few months later. So there are times when the, just the, a lot often

1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:19.080
 is the combination of the right ideas are in place and the right experimental data is

1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:23.400
 in place to point in the right direction. And it's just waiting for somebody's going

1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:29.160
 to find it. Maybe, maybe to go back to your, to your aliens, I guess the one thing that

1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:34.000
 I often wonder about aliens is, would they have the same fundamental physics ideas as

1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:39.960
 we, if we have in mathematics, would their math, you know, would they, you know, how,

1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:43.240
 how much is this really intrinsic to our minds? If, if you start out with a different

1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:47.080
 kind of mind, wouldn't you end up with a different ideas of what fundamental physics

1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:49.960
 is or what, or what the structure of mathematics is?

1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:56.560
 So this is why, like if I was, you know, I like video games, the way I would do it as

1:55:56.560 --> 1:56:02.080
 a curious being, so first experiment I'd like to do is run earth over many thousands of

1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:08.200
 times and see if our particular, no, you know what, I wouldn't do the full evolution. I

1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:12.960
 would start at homo sapiens first and then see the evolution of homo sapiens millions

1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:18.800
 of times and see how the, the ideas of science would evolve. Like, would you get like, how

1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:22.920
 would physics evolve? How would math evolves? I would particularly just be curious about

1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:28.480
 the notation they come up with. Every once in a while, I would like throw miracles at

1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:33.360
 them to like, to mess with them and stuff. And then I would also like to run earth from

1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:37.480
 the very beginning to see if evolution will produce different kinds of brains that would

1:56:37.480 --> 1:56:42.240
 then produce different kinds of mathematics and physics. And then finally, I would probably

1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:50.640
 millions of times run the universe over to see what kind of, what kind of environments

1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:55.920
 and what kind of life would be created to then lead to intelligent life to then lead

1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:02.440
 to theories of mathematics and physics and to see the full range. And like sort of like

1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:10.480
 Darwin kind of mark. Okay. It took them, what is it, several hundred million years to come

1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:17.840
 up with calculus. I would just like keep noting how long it took and get an average and see,

1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:22.800
 see which ideas are difficult, which are not. And then, and then conclusively sort of figure

1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:29.480
 out if it's, if it's more collective intelligence or singular intelligence, that's responsible

1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:35.480
 for shifts and for big phase shifts and breakthroughs in science. If I was playing a video game

1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:41.840
 and I got a chance to run this whole thing. Yeah. But um, we're talking about books before

1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:46.760
 I distract. Yeah, go back books. And yeah. So, and then, yeah. So that's one thing I'd

1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:50.960
 recommend is the, is the books, books about the, from the original people, especially

1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:55.600
 Heisenberg about the, how that happened. And there's also a very, very good kind of history

1:57:55.600 --> 1:58:02.600
 of, of the kind of what happened during this 20th century in physics. And, you know, up

1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:08.280
 to the time of the standard model in 1973, it's called the, the second creation by Pop

1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:14.000
 Creuson and man, that's one of the best ones. I know that's, but the one thing that I can

1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:20.680
 say is that, so that book, I think, forget when it was late 80s, 90s. The problem is

1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:25.440
 that there just hasn't been much that's actually worked out since then. So most of the books

1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:28.320
 that are kind of trying to tell you about all the glorious things that have happened

1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:34.400
 since 1973 are, they're mostly telling you about how glorious things are, which actually

1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:39.480
 don't really work. And it's really the argument people sometimes make in terms, in favor of

1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:42.360
 these books as well. Oh, you know, they're really great because you want to do something

1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:45.880
 that will get kids excited. And then, you know, so they're getting excited about things,

1:58:45.880 --> 1:58:48.960
 something that's not really quite working. It's doesn't really matter. The main thing

1:58:48.960 --> 1:58:53.720
 is get them excited. The other argument is, you know, wait a minute, when you, if you're

1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:58.000
 getting people excited about ideas that are wrong, you're really kind of, you're actually

1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:02.320
 kind of discrediting the whole scientific enterprise in a, in a not really good way.

1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:08.840
 So there's just problems. So my general feeling about expository stuff is, yeah, it's to the

1:59:08.840 --> 1:59:13.520
 extent you can do it kind of honestly and, and, and well, that's great. There are a lot

1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:20.920
 of people doing that now. But to the extent that you're just trying to get people excited,

1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:24.760
 enthusiastic by kind of telling them stuff, which isn't really true. This is, you really

1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:26.840
 shouldn't be doing that.

1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:31.640
 You obviously have a much better intuition about physics. I tend to, in the space of

1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:38.520
 AI, for example, you could, you could use certain kinds of language, like calling things

1:59:38.520 --> 1:59:44.880
 intelligent, that could rub people the wrong way. But I never had a problem with that kind

1:59:44.880 --> 1:59:49.880
 of thing, you know, saying that a program can learn its way without any human supervision

1:59:49.880 --> 1:59:59.000
 as AlphaZero does to play chess. To me, that may not be intelligence, but I sure that as

1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:06.240
 HEC seems like a few steps down the path towards intelligence. And so like, I think that's

2:00:06.240 --> 2:00:12.360
 a very peculiar property of systems that can be engineered. So even if the idea is fuzzy,

2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:18.820
 even if you're not really sure what intelligence is, or like, if you don't have a deep fundamental

2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:23.320
 understanding, or even a model what intelligence is, if you build a system that sure as heck

2:00:23.320 --> 2:00:29.920
 is impressive, and showing some of the signs of what previously thought impossible for

2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:36.720
 a non intelligent system, then that's impressive. And that's inspiring. And that's okay to celebrate.

2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:41.000
 In physics, because you're not engineering anything, you're just now swimming in the

2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:45.680
 space directly when you do theoretical physics, that it could be more dangerous. You could

2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:55.080
 be out too far away from shore. I think physics is actually hard for people even to believe

2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:02.320
 or really understand how that this particular kind of physics has gotten itself into a really

2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:07.960
 unusual and strange and historically unusual state, which is not really, I mean, I spent

2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:12.160
 half my life among mathematicians, math and physics. And, you know, mathematics is kind

2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:17.720
 of doing fine. People are making progress. And it has all the usual problems, but also,

2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:22.080
 so you could have a, but, but you just, I just, I don't know, I've never seen anything

2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:26.440
 at all happening in mathematics, like what's happened in the specific area in physics. It's

2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:34.320
 just the kind of sociology of this, the way this field works, banging up against this

2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:41.360
 harder problem without anything from experiment to help it. It's really, it's led to some

2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:47.720
 really kind of problematic things. And those, so it's one thing to kind of, you know, oversimplify

2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:52.560
 or to slightly misrepresent to try to explain things in a way that's not quite right. But

2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:58.920
 it's another thing to start promoting to people as a success as ideas, which, which really

2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:04.120
 completely failed. And so, I mean, I'm, I've kind of a very, very specific. If you used

2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:09.120
 to have people, I won't name any names, for instance, coming on certain podcasts like

2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:14.000
 yours telling the world, you know, this is a huge success. And this is really wonderful.

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:20.280
 And it's just not true. And, and this is, this, this is really problematic. And it carries

2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:27.080
 a serious danger of, you know, once when people realize that this is what's going on, you

2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:33.880
 know, they, you know, the loss of credibility of, of science is a real real problem for

2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:39.480
 our society. And, and you don't want, you don't want people to have an all too good

2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:44.920
 reason to think that what they're being, what they're being told by kind of some of the

2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:51.280
 best institutions or a country or authorities is not true, you know, is, is not true. It's

2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:52.280
 a problem.

2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:59.160
 That's, it's obviously characteristic of not just physics. It's a, it's sociology.

2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:04.720
 And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics, it's, that's the history of politics

2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:14.680
 is you, you sell ideas to people even when you don't have any proof that those ideas

2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:15.680
 actually work.

2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:16.680
 Yeah.

2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:24.040
 Because if they've, have worked in that, that seems to be the case throughout history.

2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:30.280
 And just like you said, it's human beings running up against a really hard problem.

2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:36.880
 I'm not sure if this is like a particular like trajectory through the progress of physics

2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:40.920
 that we're dealing with now, or is it just a natural progress of science? You run up against

2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:51.960
 a really difficult stage of a field and different people that behave differently in the face

2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:58.360
 of that. Some sell books and sort of tell narratives that are beautiful and so on. They're not

2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:04.200
 necessarily grounded in solutions that have proven themselves. Others kind of put their

2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:08.760
 head down quietly, keep doing the work. Others sort of pivot to different fields. And that's

2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:14.600
 kind of like, yeah, ants scattering. And then you have fields like machine learning, which

2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:19.480
 is there's a few folks mostly scattered away from machine learning in the, in the nineties

2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:24.760
 in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it. But a few people kept their head down

2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:29.760
 and now they're called the fathers of deep learning. And they didn't think of it that

2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:35.720
 way. And in fact, if there's another AI winter, they'll just probably keep working on it anyway,

2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:42.480
 sort of like a loyal ants, to a particular, so it's, it's interesting. But you're sort

2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:48.800
 of saying that we should be careful over hyping things that have not proven themselves, because

2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:57.680
 people will lose trust in the scientific process. But unfortunately, there's been other ways

2:04:57.680 --> 2:05:02.120
 in which people have lost trust in the scientific process that ultimately has to do actually

2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:07.600
 with all the same kind of behavior as you're highlighting, which is not being honest and

2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:11.240
 transparent about the flaws of mistakes of the past.

2:05:11.240 --> 2:05:16.600
 Yeah, I mean, that's always a problem. But this particular field is kind of, I'm always

2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:22.360
 a, it's always a strange one. I mean, I think in the sense that there's a lot of public

2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:26.240
 fascination with it, that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions about, you

2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:30.400
 know, what is this physical reality? Where do we come from? And what, and these kind

2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:34.920
 of deep issues. So there's, there's this unusual fascination with it. Mathematics is versus

2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:39.080
 very different. Nobody, nobody's that interested in mathematics. Nobody really kind of expects

2:05:39.080 --> 2:05:43.840
 to learn really great deep things about the world from mathematics that much. They don't

2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:49.480
 ask mathematicians that. So, so, so it's a very unusual, it draws this kind of unusual

2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:56.000
 amount of attention. And it really is historically in a really unusual state. It's kind of, it's

2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:04.840
 gotten itself way kind of down a, down a blind alley in a way which it's hard to find other

2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:06.680
 historical parallels.

2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:12.440
 But sort of to push back a little bit, there's power to inspiring people. And if I just empirically

2:06:12.440 --> 2:06:24.520
 look, physicists are really good at combining science and philosophy and communicating it.

2:06:24.520 --> 2:06:28.880
 Like there's something about physics often that forces you to build a strong intuition

2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:35.640
 about the way reality works, right? And that allows you to think through sort of and communicate

2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:40.040
 about all kinds of questions. Like if you see physicists, it's always fascinating to

2:06:40.040 --> 2:06:44.840
 take on problems that have nothing to do with their particular discipline. They think interest

2:06:44.840 --> 2:06:48.920
 in interesting ways and they're able to communicate their thinking in interesting ways. And so

2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:55.680
 in some sense, they have a responsibility not just to do science, but to inspire and

2:06:55.680 --> 2:07:02.200
 not responsibility, but the opportunity. And thereby, I would say a little bit of a responsibility.

2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:07.400
 Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes, but I don't know. Anyway, it's hard to say because, because different

2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:13.800
 there, there's many, many people doing this kind of thing with different degrees of success

2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:20.960
 and whatever. I guess one thing, but I mean, my, what's kind of front and center for me

2:07:20.960 --> 2:07:27.280
 is kind of a more parochial interest is just kind of what, what damage do you do to the

2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:33.400
 subject itself? Ignoring, misrepresenting, you know, what a high school students think

2:07:33.400 --> 2:07:40.160
 about string theory and not that doesn't matter much, but what the smartest undergraduates

2:07:40.160 --> 2:07:44.640
 or the smartest graduate students in the world think about it and what paths you're leading

2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:49.560
 them down and what story you're telling them and what textbooks you're making them read

2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:54.160
 and what they're hearing. And so a lot of what's motivated me is more to try to speak

2:07:54.160 --> 2:08:01.760
 to this kind of a specific population of people to make sure that look, you know, people,

2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:07.160
 it doesn't matter so much what the average person on the street thinks about string theory,

2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:13.920
 but you know, what the best students at Columbia or Harvard or Princeton or whatever who really

2:08:13.920 --> 2:08:18.640
 want to change, work in this field and want to work that way, what they know about it,

2:08:18.640 --> 2:08:22.600
 what they think about it and that they not be going to the field being misled and believing

2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:28.240
 that a certain story, this is where this is all going. This is what I got to do. It's

2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:29.240
 important to me.

2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:34.760
 In general, for graduate students, for people who seek to be experts in the field, diversity

2:08:34.760 --> 2:08:41.040
 of ideas is really powerful and is getting into this local pocket of ideas that people

2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:45.800
 hold on to for several decades is not good. No matter what the idea, I would say no matter

2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:51.680
 if the idea is right or wrong, because there's no such thing as right in the long term, like

2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:58.560
 it's right for now until somebody builds on something much bigger on top of it. It might

2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:04.640
 end up being right, but being a tiny subset of a much bigger thing. You always should

2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:07.240
 question the ways of the past.

2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:15.440
 Yeah. Yeah. So how to achieve that diversity of thought within the sociology of how we

2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:19.440
 organize scientific research. I know this is one thing that I think it's very interesting

2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:24.600
 that Sabina Hossenfelder is very interesting things to say about it. I think also at least

2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:33.360
 Moen and his book, which is also about very much in agreement with them that there's a

2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:44.200
 really important questions about how research in this field is organized and what can you

2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:53.240
 do to get more diversity of thought and get people thinking about a wider range of ideas.

2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:56.320
 At the bottom, I think humility always helps.

2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:02.320
 Well, but the problem is that it's also a combination of humility to know when you're

2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:08.200
 wrong and also, but also you have to have a certain very serious lack of humility to

2:10:08.200 --> 2:10:11.080
 believe that you're going to make progress on some of these problems.

2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:19.000
 I think you have to have both modes, which are between them when needed. Let me ask you

2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:24.680
 a question you're probably not going to want to answer because you're focused on the mathematics

2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:30.720
 of things and mathematics can't answer the why questions, but let me ask you anyway.

2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:34.480
 Do you think there's meaning to this whole thing? What do you think is the meaning of

2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:36.200
 life? Why are we here?

2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:44.760
 I don't know. Yeah, I was thinking about this. So the, and it did occur to me, what interesting

2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:51.080
 thing about that question is that you don't, yeah, so I have this life in mathematics and

2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:58.240
 this life in physics and I see some of my physicists colleagues, you know, kind of seem

2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:01.320
 to be people are often asking them, what's the meaning of life and they're writing books

2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:05.400
 about the meaning of life and teaching courses about the meaning of life. But then I realized

2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:10.880
 that no one ever asked my mathematician colleagues. Nobody ever asked mathematicians.

2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:16.080
 That's funny. Yeah. Everybody just kind of assumes, okay, well, you people are studying

2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:20.000
 about that. I see whatever you're doing, it's maybe very interesting, but it's clearly not

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:24.120
 going to tell me anything useful about the meaning of my life. And I'm afraid a lot

2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:28.600
 of my point of view is that if people realize how little difference there was between what

2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:32.280
 the mathematicians are doing and what a lot of these theoretical physicists are doing,

2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:38.520
 they might understand that it's a bit misguided to look for deep insight into the meaning

2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:44.640
 of life from, from many theoretical physicists. It's not a, they, you know, they're, they're

2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:47.920
 people and they have, they may have interesting things to say about this. You're right. They

2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:53.840
 have, they know a lot about physical reality and about, about in some sense about metaphysics

2:11:53.840 --> 2:12:03.000
 about what is real of this kind. But you're also, to my mind, I think you're also making

2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:08.520
 a bit of a mistake that you're, you're looking to, I mean, I'm very, very aware that, you

2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:13.640
 know, I've led a very pleasant and fairly privileged existence of a fairly, without

2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:20.560
 many challenges of different kinds and of a certain kind. And I'm really not in no way

2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:26.600
 the kind of person that a lot of people who are looking for to try to understand in some

2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:30.440
 of the meaning of life and the sense of the challenges that they're facing in life, I

2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:34.120
 can't really, I'm really the wrong person for you to be asking about this.

2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:41.160
 Well, if struggle is somehow a thing that's core to meaning, perhaps mathematicians are

2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:47.120
 just quietly the ones who are most equipped to answer that question. If in fact, the creation

2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:56.040
 or at least experiencing beauty is, is, is at the core of the meaning of life, because

2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:02.520
 it seems like mathematics is the methodology by which you can most purely explore beautiful

2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:08.560
 things, right? So in some sense, maybe we should talk to mathematicians more.

2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:13.800
 Yeah, yeah, maybe, but, but the, unfortunately, I think, you know, people do have a somewhat

2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:18.760
 correct perception that what these people are doing every day is pretty far removed

2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:26.360
 from anything. Yeah, from what's kind of close to what I'm, what I do every day and what

2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:31.120
 my typical concerns are. So you may learn something very interesting by talking to mathematicians,

2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:37.160
 but it's, it's probably not going to be, you're probably not going to get what you were hoping.

2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:41.840
 So when you put the pen and paper down, you're not thinking about physics, and you're not

2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:46.800
 thinking about mathematics, and you just get to breathe in the air and look around you

2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:53.800
 and realize that you're going to die one day. Yeah, do you think about that? Your ideas

2:13:53.800 --> 2:13:58.680
 will live on, but you the human. Not, not, not especially much. It's certainly

2:13:58.680 --> 2:14:02.800
 I've been getting, getting older. I'm now 64 years old. You start to realize, well,

2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:08.160
 there's probably less ahead than there was behind. And so you start to, that starts

2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:13.280
 to become, you know, what do I think about that? Maybe I should actually get serious

2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:17.920
 about getting some things done, which I, which I may not have, which I may otherwise not

2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.280
 have time to do, which I didn't see. And this didn't seem to be a problem when I was younger,

2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:26.920
 but that's the main, I think the main way in which that thought occurred.

2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:33.400
 But it doesn't, you know, the Stoics are big on this, meditating on mortality helps you

2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:37.960
 more intensely appreciate the beauty when you do experience it.

2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:44.960
 I suppose that's true, but it's not, yeah, it's not, not something I spend a lot of,

2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:47.040
 a lot of time trying, but, but yeah.

2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:49.960
 Day to day, you just enjoy the positive, the mathematics.

2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:58.560
 Just enjoy our life in general. Life is, have a perfectly pleasant life and enjoy it. And

2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:03.800
 often think, wow, this is, things are, I'm really enjoying this. Things are going well.

2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:09.120
 And yeah, life is pretty amazing. I think you and I are pretty lucky. We get to live

2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:14.840
 on this nice little earth with a nice little comfortable climate and we get to have this

2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:19.160
 nice little podcast conversation. Thank you so much for spending your valuable time with

2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:21.960
 me today and having this conversation. Thank you.

2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:22.960
 Good. Thank you.

2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:25.400
 Thank you.

2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:29.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter White. To support this podcast, please

2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:34.600
 check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you some words from Richard

2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:42.000
 Feynman. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest

2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:59.920
 person to fool. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
