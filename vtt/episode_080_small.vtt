00:00.000 --> 00:05.900
 The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin, co creator of an author of the white

00:05.900 --> 00:11.940
 paper that launched Ethereum and Ether, which is a cryptocurrency that is currently the

00:11.940 --> 00:16.100
 second largest digital currency after Bitcoin.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.300
 Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blockchain

00:20.300 --> 00:27.260
 technology and Vitalik is one of the most brilliant people innovating in the space today.

00:27.260 --> 00:34.840
 Like Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown person or group that created Bitcoin, Vitalik is

00:34.840 --> 00:41.480
 very well known and at a young age is thrust into the limelight as one of the main faces

00:41.480 --> 00:47.760
 of the technology that may redefine the nature of money and all forms of digital transactions

00:47.760 --> 00:50.280
 in the 21st century.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.360

 A N.

01:06.680 --> 01:11.240
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that

01:11.240 --> 01:13.200
 can break the flow of the conversation.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.760
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:17.760 --> 01:24.200

 When I first heard about Masterclass, I honestly thought it was too good to be true.

01:53.160 --> 01:59.680
 For $180 a year, you get an all access pass to watch courses from experts at the top of

01:59.680 --> 02:01.000
 their field.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.560
 To list some of my favorites, Chris Hadfield on Space Exploration, Neil deGrasse Tyson on

02:06.560 --> 02:12.940
 Scientific Thinking and Communication, Will Wright, the creator of SimCity and Sims on

02:12.940 --> 02:14.440
 Game Design.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.080
 I love that game.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.720
 Jane Goodall on Conservation, Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists on guitar.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.440
 Gary Kasparov on Chess, obviously I'm Russian.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.000
 I love Gary.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.880
 Daniel Negrano on poker, one of my favorite poker players, also Phil Ivy, gives a course

02:32.880 --> 02:35.640
 as well and many, many more.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.860
 Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work and the experience of being launched into

02:39.860 --> 02:43.280
 space alone is worth the money.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.600
 By way of advice for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.680
 Pick three courses you want to complete.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.640
 Watch each all the way through from start to finish.

02:52.640 --> 02:56.760
 It's not that long, but it's an experience that will stick with you for a long time,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.360
 I promise.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.840
 It's easily worth the money.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.480
 You can watch it on basically any device.

 I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.960
 I honestly love it.

03:25.960 --> 03:31.240
 It's easy to use, press the big power on button and your privacy is protected.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.800
 And if you like, you can make it look like your location is anywhere else in the world.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.080
 I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look like I'm in New York, London, Paris or

03:41.080 --> 03:42.920
 anywhere else.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.560
 This has a large number of obvious benefits.

03:45.560 --> 03:50.400
 For example, certainly it allows you to access international versions of streaming websites

03:50.400 --> 03:55.640
 like the Japanese version of Netflix or the UK version of Hulu.

03:55.640 --> 04:00.720
 As you probably know, I was born in the Soviet Union, so sadly, given my roots and appreciation

04:00.720 --> 04:06.760
 of Russian history and culture, my website and the website for this podcast is blocked

04:06.760 --> 04:08.560
 in Russia.

04:08.560 --> 04:16.120
 So this is another example of where you can use ExpressVPN to access sites like the podcast

04:16.120 --> 04:19.120
 that are not accessible in your country.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.920
 ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.

04:21.920 --> 04:28.120
 I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android, but it's available everywhere else

04:28.120 --> 04:29.360
 too.

04:29.360 --> 04:37.200
 Once again, download it at expressvpn.com slash lexpod to get a discount and to support

04:37.200 --> 04:38.800
 this podcast.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.080
 And now here's my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.

04:44.080 --> 04:50.160
 So before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind Ethereum and cryptocurrency, perhaps

04:50.160 --> 04:58.480
 it'd be nice to talk about the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto.

04:58.480 --> 05:04.440
 You gave a talk that started with asking the question, what did Satoshi Nakamoto actually

05:04.440 --> 05:05.440
 invent?

05:05.440 --> 05:10.400
 Maybe you could say, who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what did he invent?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
 Sure.

05:11.400 --> 05:18.880
 So Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with

05:18.880 --> 05:19.880
 Bitcoin.

05:19.880 --> 05:25.440
 So the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is a anonymous fellow

05:25.440 --> 05:33.640
 who has shown himself to us only over the internet just by first publishing the white

05:33.640 --> 05:39.440
 paper for Bitcoin, then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin, and then talking

05:39.440 --> 05:46.680
 to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and interacting with them and helping

05:46.680 --> 05:49.640
 the project along for a couple of years.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.800
 And then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011, he disappeared.

05:55.800 --> 06:05.160
 So Bitcoin is a fairly unique project in how it has this kind of mythical kind of quasi

06:05.160 --> 06:11.080
 godlike founder who just kind of popped in, did the thing and disappeared and we've somehow

06:11.080 --> 06:13.120
 just never heard from him again.

06:13.120 --> 06:18.360
 So in 2008, so the white paper was the first, do you know the white paper was the first

06:18.360 --> 06:22.320
 time the name would actually appear Satoshi Nakamoto?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.720
 I believe so.

06:23.720 --> 06:31.560
 So how is it possible that the creator of such an impactful project remains anonymous?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.280
 That's a tough question.

06:34.280 --> 06:39.280
 There's no similarity to it in the history of technology as far as I'm aware.

06:39.280 --> 06:46.760
 So one possibility is that it's Healthini because Healthini was also active in the Bitcoin

06:46.760 --> 06:57.520
 community and as Healthini in those two beginning years and Healthini, maybe he is one of the

06:57.520 --> 07:00.760
 people in the early Cypherpunk community.

07:00.760 --> 07:08.120
 He was a computer scientist, just computer scientists, cryptographers, people interested

07:08.120 --> 07:14.840
 in like technology, internet freedom, like those kinds of topics.

07:14.840 --> 07:19.040
 Was it correct that I read that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest

07:19.040 --> 07:21.920
 or the first transaction of Bitcoin?

07:21.920 --> 07:22.920
 Yes.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.440
 The first transaction of Bitcoin was between Satoshi and Healthini.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.560
 Do you think he knew who Satoshi was?

07:28.560 --> 07:31.400
 If he wasn't Satoshi, you probably know.

07:31.400 --> 07:36.920
 How is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything

07:36.920 --> 07:39.880
 about their fundamental identity?

07:39.880 --> 07:43.840
 Is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the internet?

07:43.840 --> 07:52.120
 If we were to think about it, because you and I just met now, there's a depth of knowledge

07:52.120 --> 07:55.680
 that we now have about each other that's like physical.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.200
 My vision system is able to recognize you.

07:58.200 --> 08:05.920
 I can also verify your identity of uniqueness, like it's very hard to fake you being you.

08:05.920 --> 08:11.440
 So the internet has a fundamentally different quality to it, which is just fascinating.

08:11.440 --> 08:19.360
 Yeah, this is definitely interesting as I definitely just know a lot of people just

08:19.360 --> 08:21.760
 by their internet handles.

08:21.760 --> 08:27.880
 To me, when I think of them, I see their internet handles and one of them has a profile picture

08:27.880 --> 08:34.600
 as this face that's not quite human with a bunch of psychedelic colors in it.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.960
 When I visualize him, I just visualize that.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.880
 Not an actual face.

08:40.880 --> 08:48.440
 You are the creator of the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum.

08:48.440 --> 08:53.000
 On this topic, if we just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto for a little bit longer, you may

08:53.000 --> 08:58.200
 be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking

08:58.200 --> 09:00.480
 about.

09:00.480 --> 09:05.400
 Your identity is known, I've just verified it, but from your perspective, what are the

09:05.400 --> 09:11.320
 benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining anonymous?

09:11.320 --> 09:17.160
 If it can psychoanalyze Satoshi Nakamoto, is there something interesting there?

09:17.160 --> 09:20.360
 Or is it just a peculiar quirk of him?

09:20.360 --> 09:29.760
 It definitely helps create this image of a neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone.

09:29.760 --> 09:37.640
 You created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also have disappeared or,

09:37.640 --> 09:42.320
 as unfortunately happened to Helfini, if that is him, he ended up dying of Lou Gehrig's

09:42.320 --> 09:46.520
 disease and he's in a cryogenic freezer now.

09:46.520 --> 09:55.800
 If you pop in and you created and you're gone and all that's remaining of that whole

09:55.800 --> 10:03.920
 process is the thing itself, then no one can go and try to interpret any of your other

10:03.920 --> 10:13.840
 behavior and try to understand, oh, this person wrote this thing in some essay at age 16 where

10:13.840 --> 10:17.440
 he expressed particular opinions about democracy.

10:17.440 --> 10:22.720
 Because of that, this project is a statement that's trying to do this specific thing.

10:22.720 --> 10:30.640
 That it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.000
 It doesn't have the burden of your other ideas, political thought and so on.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.120
 So now that we're sitting with you, do you feel the burden of being kind of the face

10:43.120 --> 10:44.120
 of Ethereum?

10:44.120 --> 10:49.840
 I mean, there's a very large community of developers, but nevertheless, is there like

10:49.840 --> 10:52.160
 a burden associated with that?

10:52.160 --> 10:53.480
 There definitely is.

10:53.480 --> 11:00.240
 This is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to push for the Ethereum ecosystem

11:00.240 --> 11:06.840
 to become more decentralized in many ways, just encouraging a lot of Ethereum work to

11:06.840 --> 11:11.840
 happen outside of the Ethereum foundation and of expanding the number of people that

11:11.840 --> 11:17.080
 are making different kinds of decisions, having multiple software limitations instead of one

11:17.080 --> 11:18.600
 and all of these things.

11:18.600 --> 11:25.400
 There's a lot of things that I've tried to do to remove myself as a single point of failure

11:25.400 --> 11:31.840
 because that is something that a lot of people criticize me for.

11:31.840 --> 11:37.600
 So if you look at like the most fundamentally successful open source projects, it seems

11:37.600 --> 11:43.440
 that it's like a sad reality when I think about it is it seems to be that one person

11:43.440 --> 11:51.760
 is a crucial contributor often if you look at Linus for Linux, for the kernel.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.640
 That is possible and I'm definitely not planning to disappear.

11:56.640 --> 12:04.320
 That's an interesting tension that projects like this kind of desire a single entity and

12:04.320 --> 12:08.760
 yet they're fundamentally distributed.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.920
 I don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking

12:12.920 --> 12:17.600
 about the future of cryptocurrency, does there need to be a leader?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.760
 There's different kinds of leaders.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.880
 There's dictators who control all the money.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.080
 There's people who control organizations.

12:25.080 --> 12:30.520
 There's high priests that just have themselves as their Twitter followers.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.120
 What kind of leader are you, would you say?

12:33.120 --> 12:42.680
 In these days, actually a bit more in the high priest direction than before.

12:42.680 --> 12:47.880
 I definitely actually don't do all that much of kind of going around and ordering Ethereum

12:47.880 --> 12:52.680
 Foundation people to do things because I think those things are important.

12:52.680 --> 12:58.120
 If there's something that I do think is important, I do just usually kind of say it publicly

12:58.120 --> 13:05.120
 or just kind of say it to people and quite often projects just kind of start doing it.

13:05.120 --> 13:10.360
 So let's ask the high philosophical question about money.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.120
 What at the highest level is money?

13:13.120 --> 13:15.360
 What is money?

13:15.360 --> 13:21.080
 It's a kind of game and it's a game where we have points and if you have points, there's

13:21.080 --> 13:24.520
 this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's points

13:24.520 --> 13:26.520
 by the same number.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.840
 So it's a fair game, hopefully.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.400
 Well, it's one kind of fair game.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.960
 For example, you can have other kinds of fair games like you're going to have a game where

13:35.960 --> 13:39.600
 if I give someone a point and you give someone a point instead of that person getting two

13:39.600 --> 13:44.200
 points that person gets four points and that's also fair.

13:44.200 --> 13:52.720
 But money is easy to set up and it serves a lot of useful functions and so it kind of

13:52.720 --> 13:57.800
 just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.600
 It's useful for the storage of wealth.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.080
 It's useful for the exchange of value.

14:04.080 --> 14:10.080
 And it's also useful for denominating future payments, a unit of account.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.400
 A unit of account.

14:11.400 --> 14:18.640
 So if you look at the history of money in human civilization, just if you're a student

14:18.640 --> 14:25.960
 of history, how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view?

14:25.960 --> 14:30.640
 Even if we just look at the 20th century before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies, that's

14:30.640 --> 14:32.160
 something you think about?

14:32.160 --> 14:41.520
 And I think the big thing in the 20th century is we saw a lot more intermediation, I guess.

14:41.520 --> 14:50.800
 The first part is the move from adding more of different kinds of banking and then we

14:50.800 --> 14:57.640
 saw the move from dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that's

14:57.640 --> 15:05.880
 only redeemable by certain people to dollars not being backed by anything and if you have

15:05.880 --> 15:13.160
 a bunch of free floating currencies and then people getting bank accounts and then those

15:13.160 --> 15:17.960
 things becoming electronic, people getting accounts with payment processors that have

15:17.960 --> 15:20.360
 bank accounts.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.400
 So what do you make of that?

15:22.400 --> 15:30.000
 That's such a fascinating philosophical idea that money might not be backed by anything.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.520
 Is that fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something physical?

15:35.520 --> 15:36.520
 It definitely is.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.480
 What do you make of that?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
 How is that possible?

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
 Is that stable?

15:41.480 --> 15:45.800
 If we look at the future of human civilization, is it possible to have money at the large

15:45.800 --> 15:52.480
 scale at such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully

15:52.480 --> 15:55.000
 without money being backed by anything physical?

15:55.000 --> 16:01.240
 I feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of the

16:01.240 --> 16:04.400
 important valuable things are not backed by anything.

16:04.400 --> 16:10.640
 If you look at tech companies, for example, like something like Twitter, you could theoretically

16:10.640 --> 16:16.080
 imagine that if all of the employees wanted to, they could have come together, they would

16:16.080 --> 16:28.160
 quit and start working on Twitter 2.0 and then they have value and just build the exact

16:28.160 --> 16:32.720
 same product or, of course, possibly build a better product and then just continue on

16:32.720 --> 16:40.400
 from there and the original Twitter would not have people left anymore.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.440
 There is theoretically code and IP that's owned by the company, but in reality, good

16:45.440 --> 16:51.480
 programmers could probably rewrite all that stuff in three months.

16:51.480 --> 16:57.280
 The reason why the thing has value is just network effects and coordination problems.

16:57.280 --> 17:02.880
 These employees in reality aren't going to switch all at once and also the users aren't

17:02.880 --> 17:08.440
 all going to switch at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at once.

17:08.440 --> 17:16.360
 There's these metastable and equilibrium interactions between thousands of millions of people that

17:16.360 --> 17:22.400
 are actually quite sticky even though if you try to assume that everyone's a perfectly

17:22.400 --> 17:28.200
 rational and perfectly soliparist, spherical cow, they don't seem to exist at all.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
 That stickiness.

17:29.200 --> 17:36.360
 Do you have a sense, a grasp of the fundamental dynamics, like the physics of that stickiness?

17:36.360 --> 17:45.040
 It seems to work, and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it working.

17:45.040 --> 17:51.000
 It's the sort of thing that's definitely been economically modeled a lot.

17:51.000 --> 18:01.040
 One of the analogy of something similar that you often see in textbooks is what is a government,

18:01.040 --> 18:09.720
 if 80% of people in a country just tomorrow suddenly had the idea that the laws that are

18:09.720 --> 18:15.520
 currently the laws in the government are just people and some other thing is the government

18:15.520 --> 18:19.920
 and they just start acting like it, then that would become the new reality.

18:19.920 --> 18:30.440
 The question is, well, what happens if between zero and 80% of people start believing that?

18:30.440 --> 18:35.560
 Another thing you see is that if there is one of these kind of switches happening, this

18:35.560 --> 18:42.880
 kind of revolution, then if you're the first person to join, then you probably don't have

18:42.880 --> 18:47.760
 the incentive to do that, but then if you're the 55th percentile person to join, then suddenly

18:47.760 --> 18:51.080
 becomes quite safe too.

18:51.080 --> 18:58.360
 This definitely is the sort of thing that you can try to analyze and understand mathematically.

18:58.360 --> 19:08.080
 One of the results is that the sort of when the switch happens definitely can be chaotic

19:08.080 --> 19:09.080
 sometimes.

19:09.080 --> 19:14.360
 Yeah, but still, to me, the idea that the network affects the fact that human beings

19:14.360 --> 19:23.640
 at a scale like millions, billions can share even the idea of currency, all agree.

19:23.640 --> 19:31.000
 I know economists can model it, I'm a skeptic on the economic, so my favorite sort of field,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.240
 maybe recreational, these psychology is trying to understand human behavior and I think sometimes

19:36.240 --> 19:41.200
 people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though

19:41.200 --> 19:45.720
 it's such a messy space that all the models that psychology or economics, those are different

19:45.720 --> 19:52.640
 perspectives on human behavior, can have are difficult, is difficult to know how much that's

19:52.640 --> 19:57.160
 wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of understanding human

19:57.160 --> 20:05.960
 behavior, but on that idea, what do you think is the role of money in human motivation?

20:05.960 --> 20:15.680
 So do you think money from an economics perspective, from a psychology perspective is core to like

20:15.680 --> 20:18.480
 human desires?

20:18.480 --> 20:22.000
 Money is definitely very far from the only motivator.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.160
 It is a big motivator, and that's one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator.

20:30.160 --> 20:36.120
 Because ultimately, almost any person in the world, if you ask them to do something, they'll

20:36.120 --> 20:43.400
 be more inclined to do it if you also offer them money.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.880
 There's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that maximize

20:47.880 --> 20:53.040
 how much money they have and that happens all the time, but a lot of those other things

20:53.040 --> 20:58.440
 are kind of much more specific to and of who that person is and of what their situation

20:58.440 --> 21:02.440
 is, the relationship between the motive and the action and these other things.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.120
 What do you think is the interplay of the other motivator from like Nietzsche in respect

21:06.120 --> 21:07.920
 to his power?

21:07.920 --> 21:09.840
 Do you think money equals power?

21:09.840 --> 21:11.960
 Do you think those are conflicting ideas?

21:11.960 --> 21:17.680
 I mean, that's one of the ideas that decentralized currency, decentralized applications are looking

21:17.680 --> 21:21.880
 at is who holds the power?

21:21.880 --> 21:28.400
 Money is definitely a kind of power, and there's definitely people who want money because it

21:28.400 --> 21:37.000
 gives them power, and then even if money doesn't seem to explicitly be about money, a lot of

21:37.000 --> 21:44.360
 things that people spend money on are ultimately about social status of some kind.

21:44.360 --> 21:50.480
 I definitely view those two things as interplaying, and then there's also money as just a way

21:50.480 --> 21:59.320
 of measuring how successful you are as a scoreboard, so this kind of gets back to the game.

21:59.320 --> 22:08.080
 If you have $4 billion, then one of the big benefits you get from going up to $6 million

22:08.080 --> 22:12.200
 is that now instead of being below the guy who has five, you're above the guy who has

22:12.200 --> 22:13.200
 five.

22:13.200 --> 22:19.440
 So you think money could be kind of in the game of life, it's also a measure of self

22:19.440 --> 22:20.440
 worth.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.840
 It's like how we...

22:21.840 --> 22:25.640
 It's definitely how a lot of people perceive it.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.120
 Define ourselves in the hierarchy of society.

22:29.120 --> 22:34.720
 Not saying it's a healthy thing that people define their self worth as money because it's

22:34.720 --> 22:43.880
 definitely far from a perfect indicator of how much value you provide to society or anything

22:43.880 --> 22:50.040
 like this, but I definitely think that as a matter of current practice, so much of people

22:50.040 --> 22:51.440
 do feel that way.

22:51.440 --> 22:57.200
 So what does utopia from an economic perspective look like to you?

22:57.200 --> 23:00.280
 What does the perfect world look like?

23:00.280 --> 23:09.920
 I guess the economists say utopia would be one where kind of everything is an incentive

23:09.920 --> 23:16.040
 aligned in the sense that there aren't kind of conflicts between what satisfies your goals

23:16.040 --> 23:22.320
 and kind of what is good for everyone in the world as a whole.

23:22.320 --> 23:26.800
 What do you think that would look like?

23:26.800 --> 23:29.880
 Does that mean there's still poor people and rich people?

23:29.880 --> 23:32.400
 There's still income inequality?

23:32.400 --> 23:35.400
 Do you think sort of Marxist ideas are strong?

23:35.400 --> 23:44.840
 Do you think sort of ideas of objectivism, like where the market rules is strong?

23:44.840 --> 23:50.320
 Is there different economic philosophies that just seem to be reflective of what utopia

23:50.320 --> 23:51.320
 would be?

23:51.320 --> 24:01.000
 So I definitely think that existing economic philosophies do end up systematically deviating

24:01.000 --> 24:04.560
 from the utopia in a lot of ways.

24:04.560 --> 24:09.840
 One of the big things I talk about, for example, is public goods, and public goods are especially

24:09.840 --> 24:13.040
 important on the internet.

24:13.040 --> 24:19.680
 The idea is with money as this game where I lose a few coins and you gain the same number

24:19.680 --> 24:23.720
 of coins, is that this usually happens in a trade where I lose some money, you gain

24:23.720 --> 24:29.440
 some money, you lose a sandwich and I gain a sandwich.

24:29.440 --> 24:35.800
 This kind of model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize

24:35.800 --> 24:39.840
 this kind of private goods, things that you provide to one person or the benefit comes

24:39.840 --> 24:43.600
 to one person.

24:43.600 --> 24:49.120
 On the internet especially, but also many, many contexts off the internet, there's actions

24:49.120 --> 24:56.400
 that individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit going to one person,

24:56.400 --> 25:01.080
 the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you can't control who the benefit

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
 goes to.

25:02.080 --> 25:08.680
 For example, this podcast, we publish it and when it's published, you don't have any fine

25:08.680 --> 25:15.400
 grains control over these 38,000 people can watch it and then these other 29,000 people

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
 can't.

25:16.400 --> 25:21.380
 Once the number goes high enough, then people will just copy it and then when I write articles

25:21.380 --> 25:27.240
 on a blog, then they're just free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone

25:27.240 --> 25:29.800
 from copying.

25:29.800 --> 25:36.720
 Aside from that, things like scientific research, for example, and even taking more pedestrian

25:36.720 --> 25:42.920
 examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one.

25:42.920 --> 25:48.880
 There's a lot of things in the world where you have these individual actions with concentrated

25:48.880 --> 25:55.560
 costs and distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a good job of encouraging

25:55.560 --> 25:57.800
 these things.

25:57.800 --> 26:05.280
 One of the other things even, tangentially connected to crypto but theoretically outside

26:05.280 --> 26:10.680
 of it that I work on is this mechanism called quadratic funding and the way to think about

26:10.680 --> 26:22.040
 it is imagine a point system where if one person gives coins to one other person, then

26:22.040 --> 26:23.720
 it works the same way as money.

26:23.720 --> 26:31.320
 But if multiple people give coins to one person and they do so anonymously, so it's not in

26:31.320 --> 26:37.360
 consideration for a specific service to that person themselves, then the number of coins

26:37.360 --> 26:42.560
 that are received by that person is greater than just the sum of the number of coins that

26:42.560 --> 26:45.440
 are given by those different people.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.640
 So the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount that each person gave,

26:49.640 --> 26:53.760
 then you add all the square roots and then you end up square the sum and then you give

26:53.760 --> 26:54.760
 that.

26:54.760 --> 27:01.760
 And the idea here would basically be that if, let's say for example, you would just start

27:01.760 --> 27:06.400
 going off and kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really

27:06.400 --> 27:11.280
 happy that you're planting trees and then so they go and all kind of throw a coin your

27:11.280 --> 27:18.640
 way, then there is basically the fact that you get more than the sum, you get this kind

27:18.640 --> 27:26.400
 of square root of these tiny amounts, that this actually kind of compensates for the

27:26.400 --> 27:28.400
 tragedy of the commons.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.680
 There's even this kind of mathematical proof that it sort of optimally compensates for

27:31.680 --> 27:32.680
 it.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.080
 What is the tragedy of the commons?

27:34.080 --> 27:42.840
 This is just this idea that if there is this situation where there's some public good that

27:42.840 --> 27:47.360
 lots of people benefit from, then no individual person wants to contribute to it because if

27:47.360 --> 27:52.240
 they contribute, they only get a small part of the benefit from their contribution, but

27:52.240 --> 27:54.840
 they pay the full cost of their contribution.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.840
 In which context is this, sorry, what is the term quadratic?

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
 Quadratic funding.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
 Quadratic funding.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.600
 In which context is this mechanism useful?

28:05.600 --> 28:11.480
 Obviously, you said to combat the tragedy of the commons, but in which context do you

28:11.480 --> 28:13.600
 see it as useful actually to practice speaking?

28:13.600 --> 28:17.040
 Yeah, theoretically, public good is in general, right?

28:17.040 --> 28:19.160
 Like services, what are we talking about?

28:19.160 --> 28:21.600
 What's the public good?

28:21.600 --> 28:26.680
 Within the Ethereum ecosystem, for example, we've actually tried using this mechanism.

28:26.680 --> 28:32.040
 I wrote a couple of articles about this on Vitalik.ca where I go through some of the

28:32.040 --> 28:35.240
 most recent rounds and it's been really interesting.

28:35.240 --> 28:44.320
 Some of the top ones that people supported, there were things like just online user interfaces

28:44.320 --> 28:48.600
 that make it easier for people to interact with Ethereum.

28:48.600 --> 28:59.920
 There was documentation, there were podcasts, there were software clients, implementations

28:59.920 --> 29:08.160
 of the Ethereum protocol of privacy tools, just lots of things that are useful to lots

29:08.160 --> 29:09.160
 of people.

29:09.160 --> 29:16.400
 When a lot of people are contributing, funding a particular entity, that's really interesting.

29:16.400 --> 29:21.920
 There's something special about the quadratic, the summing of the square roots and the taken

29:21.920 --> 29:22.920
 square.

29:22.920 --> 29:27.760
 Another way to think about it is imagine if N people each give a dollar, then the person

29:27.760 --> 29:31.680
 gets N squared.

29:31.680 --> 29:37.200
 Each individual person's contribution gets multiplied by N because you have N people.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.920
 That perfectly compensates for the N to 1 tragedy of the commons.

29:41.920 --> 29:45.840
 I just wonder if the squared part is fundamental.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.560
 It is.

29:47.560 --> 29:54.880
 I'd recommend you go on Vitalik.ca, I have this article called Quadratic Payments a Primer

29:54.880 --> 30:01.080
 and I highly recommend it, at least my attempt so far of explaining the intuition behind

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
 this.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
 The intuition.

30:03.080 --> 30:11.520
 If we could, can we go to the very basic, what is the blockchain or perhaps we might

30:11.520 --> 30:18.360
 even start at the Byzantine generals problem, the Byzantine fault tolerance in general,

30:18.360 --> 30:26.480
 that Bitcoin was taking steps to providing a solution for it.

30:26.480 --> 30:33.520
 The Byzantine generals problem, it's this paper that Leslie Lamport published in 1982

30:33.520 --> 30:38.760
 where he has this thought experiment where if you have two generals that are camped out

30:38.760 --> 30:47.000
 on opposite sides of a city and they're planning when to attack the city, then the question

30:47.000 --> 30:52.240
 is how could those generals coordinate with each other and they could send messengers

30:52.240 --> 30:59.520
 between each other, but those messengers could get sniped by the enemy on the road.

30:59.520 --> 31:06.000
 Some of those messengers could end up being traitors and if things could end up happening.

31:06.000 --> 31:13.960
 With just two mess generals, it turns out that there's no solution in a finite number

31:13.960 --> 31:20.240
 of rounds that guarantees that they will be able to coordinate on the same answer.

31:20.240 --> 31:26.120
 But then in the case where you have more than two generals that then Leslie analyzes cases,

31:26.120 --> 31:32.760
 are the messengers just oral messengers, are the messengers signed messengers so I could

31:32.760 --> 31:37.520
 give you a signed message and you can pass along that signed message and the third party

31:37.520 --> 31:42.360
 can still verify that I originally made that message.

31:42.360 --> 31:48.240
 Depending on those different cases, there's different bounds on given how many generals

31:48.240 --> 31:55.040
 and how many traitors among those generals and under what conditions you actually can

31:55.040 --> 31:59.120
 agree on to launch an attack.

31:59.120 --> 32:03.960
 It's actually a big misconception that the business in general's problem was unsolved,

32:03.960 --> 32:05.560
 so Leslie Lamport solved it.

32:05.560 --> 32:10.120
 The thing that was unsolved though is that all of these solutions assume that you've

32:10.120 --> 32:14.760
 already agreed on a fixed list of who the generals are.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.560
 These generals have to be semi trusted to some extent.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.360
 They can't just be anonymous people because if they're anonymous, then the enemy could

32:21.360 --> 32:28.480
 just be 99% of the generals.

32:28.480 --> 32:35.000
 Among the 1980s and the 1990s, the general use case for distributed system stuff was

32:35.000 --> 32:44.520
 more enterprisey stuff where you could assume that you know who the nodes are that are running

32:44.520 --> 32:46.480
 these kind of computer networks.

32:46.480 --> 32:51.200
 If you want to have some decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single computer

32:51.200 --> 32:58.440
 and that you can do operations on, then it's made out of these 15 specific computers.

32:58.440 --> 33:03.640
 We know who and where they are, so we have a good reason to believe that at least 11

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
 of them would be fine.

33:04.640 --> 33:11.800
 It could also be within a single system, almost a network of devices, sensors, so on like

33:11.800 --> 33:19.240
 in airplanes and I think flight systems in general still use these kinds of ideas.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.240
 That's the 80s.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.920
 That's the 80s and 90s.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.880
 The Cypherpunks had a different use case in mind, which is that they wanted to create

33:25.880 --> 33:31.320
 a fully decentralized global permissionless currency.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.600
 The problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want

33:35.600 --> 33:38.760
 any kind of privileged list of people.

33:38.760 --> 33:45.480
 Now the question is, well, how do you use these techniques to create consensus when

33:45.480 --> 33:48.160
 you have no way of measuring identities?

33:48.160 --> 33:54.920
 You have no way of determining whether or not some 99% of participants aren't actually

33:54.920 --> 33:56.920
 all the same guy.

33:56.920 --> 34:02.640
 The clever solution that Satoshi had, this is kind of going back to that presentation

34:02.640 --> 34:06.800
 I made at DEF CON a few months ago where I said that the thing Satoshi invented was

34:06.800 --> 34:14.800
 crypto economics, is this really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind

34:14.800 --> 34:20.840
 of limit how many identities you can get.

34:20.840 --> 34:25.560
 If there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency, then the only way to do this is

34:25.560 --> 34:27.160
 with proof of work.

34:27.160 --> 34:36.400
 With proof of work, the solution is just you publish a solution to a hard mathematical

34:36.400 --> 34:42.840
 puzzle that takes some kind of clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve, you

34:42.840 --> 34:44.440
 get an identity.

34:44.440 --> 34:48.440
 You solve five of those puzzles, you get five identities.

34:48.440 --> 34:52.240
 These are the identities that we run the consensus algorithm between.

34:52.240 --> 34:58.800
 So the proof of work mechanism you just described is the fundamental idea proposed in the white

34:58.800 --> 35:02.280
 paper that defines Bitcoin.

35:02.280 --> 35:07.240
 What's the idea of consensus that we wish to reach?

35:07.240 --> 35:10.160
 Why is consensus important here?

35:10.160 --> 35:12.160
 What is consensus?

35:12.160 --> 35:21.120
 So the goal here in just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wire together

35:21.120 --> 35:26.480
 a set of a large number of computers in such a way that they kind of pretends to the outside

35:26.480 --> 35:31.920
 world to be a single computer where that single computer keeps working even if a large portion

35:31.920 --> 35:35.920
 of the kind of constituents, the computers that make it up break in kind of break in

35:35.920 --> 35:36.920
 arbitrary ways.

35:36.920 --> 35:41.520
 Like they could shut off, they could try to actively break a system, they could do lots

35:41.520 --> 35:43.200
 of mean things.

35:43.200 --> 35:50.360
 So the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run one

35:50.360 --> 35:54.360
 particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program that they

35:54.360 --> 35:56.720
 wanted to run is just a currency system, right?

35:56.720 --> 36:02.560
 It's a system that just processes a series of transactions and for every transaction

36:02.560 --> 36:07.840
 it verifies that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction, it verifies that

36:07.840 --> 36:12.520
 the digital signature is correct and if the check's passed then it subtracts the coins

36:12.520 --> 36:17.000
 from one account and adds the coins to the other account roughly.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.800
 So first of all, the proof of work idea is kind of, I mean, at least to me, seems pretty

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
 fascinating.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.800
 It is.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.520
 I mean, that's a kind of revolutionary idea.

36:28.520 --> 36:34.640
 Is it obvious to come up with that you can use, you can exchange basically computational

36:34.640 --> 36:40.080
 resources for identity?

36:40.080 --> 36:41.800
 It actually has a pretty long history.

36:41.800 --> 36:51.320
 It was first proposed in a paper by McSinthea Dwork in 1994, I believe.

36:51.320 --> 36:54.840
 And the original use case was combating email spam.

36:54.840 --> 36:58.240
 So the idea is that if you send an email you have to send it with a proof of work attached

36:58.240 --> 37:02.760
 and this makes it reasonably cheap to send emails to your friends but it makes it really

37:02.760 --> 37:05.280
 expensive to send spam to a million people.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.280
 Yeah.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.640
 That's a simple, brilliant idea.

37:08.640 --> 37:14.600
 So maybe also taking a step back, so what is the role of blockchain in this?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.600
 What is the blockchain?

37:15.600 --> 37:16.600
 Sure.

37:16.600 --> 37:23.400
 So the blockchain, my way of thinking about it is that it is this kind of system where

37:23.400 --> 37:31.080
 you have this kind of one virtual computer created by a bunch of these nodes in the network.

37:31.080 --> 37:36.280
 And the reason why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure that these

37:36.280 --> 37:45.320
 systems use at least so far is one where they have different nodes in the network periodically

37:45.320 --> 37:51.480
 publish blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer, like

37:51.480 --> 37:56.640
 a hash of a previous block that it builds on top of.

37:56.640 --> 38:03.000
 And so you have a series of blocks that nodes in the network create where each block points

38:03.000 --> 38:05.920
 to the previous block and so you have this chain of them.

38:05.920 --> 38:10.920
 Is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of blockchain or is there a lot of

38:10.920 --> 38:16.400
 possibilities of different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on?

38:16.400 --> 38:19.600
 There are indeed a lot of possibilities.

38:19.600 --> 38:24.080
 So in a kind of just simple architecture as I just described, the way the fault tolerance

38:24.080 --> 38:25.400
 happens is like this, right?

38:25.400 --> 38:30.240
 So you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily occasionally creating blocks, building

38:30.240 --> 38:33.080
 on top of each other's blocks.

38:33.080 --> 38:39.360
 And let's say you have one block, we'll call it block one, and then someone else builds

38:39.360 --> 38:44.080
 another block, honestly, we'll call it block two, then we have an attacker.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.880
 And what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert block two.

38:47.880 --> 38:51.400
 And the way they revert block two is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do,

38:51.400 --> 38:55.920
 which is build a block on top of block two, they're going to build another block on top

38:55.920 --> 38:57.760
 of block one.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.840
 So you have block one, which has two children, block two, and then block two prime.

39:01.840 --> 39:08.240
 Now this might sometimes even happen by random chance if two nodes in the network just happen

39:08.240 --> 39:11.920
 to create blocks at the same time and they don't hear about each other's things before

39:11.920 --> 39:13.480
 they create their own.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.160
 But this also could happen because of an attack.

39:16.160 --> 39:23.600
 Now if this happens, you have an attack, then in the Bitcoin system, the nodes follow the

39:23.600 --> 39:25.120
 longest chain.

39:25.120 --> 39:33.920
 So if this attack had happened when the original chain had more than two blocks on it, so if

39:33.920 --> 39:41.040
 it was trying to revert more than two blocks, then everyone would just ignore it and everyone

39:41.040 --> 39:43.040
 would just keep following the regular chain.

39:43.040 --> 39:47.560
 But here we have block two and we have block two prime, and so the two are kind of even.

39:47.560 --> 39:52.080
 And then whatever block, the next block is created on top of.

39:52.080 --> 39:58.360
 So say block three is now created on top of block two prime, then everyone agrees that

39:58.360 --> 40:04.520
 block three is the new head, and block two prime is just kind of forgotten, and then

40:04.520 --> 40:08.080
 everyone just kind of peacefully builds on top of block three and the thing continues.

40:08.080 --> 40:12.080
 So how difficult is it to mess with the system?

40:12.080 --> 40:19.120
 So if we look at the general problem, what fraction of people who participate in the

40:19.120 --> 40:26.400
 system have to be bad players in order to mess with it truly?

40:26.400 --> 40:27.400
 Is there a good number?

40:27.400 --> 40:28.400
 There is.

40:28.400 --> 40:33.640
 Well, depending on kind of what your model of the participants is and what kind of attack

40:33.640 --> 40:40.920
 we're talking about, it's anywhere between 23.2 and 50%.

40:40.920 --> 40:41.920
 Of what?

40:41.920 --> 40:44.800
 Of all of the computing power in the network.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.800
 Sorry.

40:45.800 --> 40:49.840
 So between 23.2 and 50%.

40:49.840 --> 40:53.920
 And 50% can be compromised.

40:53.920 --> 41:02.880
 So like once your portion of the total computing power in the network goes above the 23.2 level,

41:02.880 --> 41:07.600
 then there's kind of things that you can mean things that you can potentially do.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.000
 And as your percentage of the network kind of keeps going up, then your abilities as

41:12.000 --> 41:16.120
 you mean things kind of goes higher, and then if you have above 50%, then you can just break

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
 everything.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.880
 So how hard is it to achieve that level?

41:19.880 --> 41:26.120
 Like it seems that so far historically speaking, it's been exceptionally difficult.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.720
 This is a challenging question.

41:28.720 --> 41:34.520
 So the economic cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high.

41:34.520 --> 41:38.640
 I think it's somewhere in the low billions of dollars.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.880
 And when you say that stuff, you mean computational resources?

41:41.880 --> 41:42.880
 Yeah.

41:42.880 --> 41:48.720
 So specifically specialized hardware and of ASICs that people use to solve these puzzles

41:48.720 --> 41:50.720
 to do the mining business.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.440
 Small tangent.

41:52.440 --> 41:57.720
 So obviously I work a lot in deep learning with GPUs and ASICs for that application.

41:57.720 --> 42:03.400
 And I tangentially kind of hear that so many of these, you know, sometimes NVIDIA GPUs

42:03.400 --> 42:07.240
 are sold out because of this other application.

42:07.240 --> 42:12.160
 Like what do, if you can comment, I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the

42:12.160 --> 42:18.240
 space, what kind of ASICs, what kind of hardware is generally used these days for to do the

42:18.240 --> 42:20.800
 actual computation for the proof of work?

42:20.800 --> 42:21.800
 Sure.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.280
 So in the case, in Bitcoin and Ethereum are a bit different.

42:24.280 --> 42:30.200
 So in the case of Bitcoin, there is an algorithm called SHA256, it's just a hash function.

42:30.200 --> 42:34.320
 And so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number is below

42:34.320 --> 42:35.600
 some threshold.

42:35.600 --> 42:39.960
 And so because the hashes are designed to be random, you just have to keep on trying

42:39.960 --> 42:42.440
 different numbers until one works.

42:42.440 --> 42:49.920
 And the ASICs are just like specialized circuits that contain and circuits for evaluating this

42:49.920 --> 42:53.480
 hash over and over again, and you have kind of like millions or billions of these hash

42:53.480 --> 42:58.320
 evaluators and just stacked on top of each other inside of a box, and you just keep on

42:58.320 --> 43:00.200
 running the box 24x7.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.400
 In the ASICs, there's literally specialized hardware designed for this.

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
 Yes.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.840
 This is living in an amazing world.

43:06.840 --> 43:12.000
 Another tangent, I'll come back to the basics, but does quantum computing throw a wrench

43:12.000 --> 43:14.320
 into any of this?

43:14.320 --> 43:15.440
 Very good question.

43:15.440 --> 43:22.520
 So quantum computers have two main families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography.

43:22.520 --> 43:28.640
 One is Shor's algorithm, and Shor's algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the

43:28.640 --> 43:33.200
 hardness of some specific kinds of mathematical problems.

43:33.200 --> 43:37.480
 So the one that you've probably heard of is it makes it very easy to factor in numbers.

43:37.480 --> 43:42.360
 So figure out kind of what prime factors are that you need to multiply together to get

43:42.360 --> 43:46.000
 some number, even if that number is extremely big.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.360
 Shor's algorithm can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography.

43:53.360 --> 43:59.880
 It breaks a lot of cryptographic nice things that we're used to.

43:59.880 --> 44:07.360
 But the good news is that for every major use of things that Shor's algorithm breaks,

44:07.360 --> 44:11.200
 we already know of quantum proof alternatives.

44:11.200 --> 44:14.560
 We don't use these quantum proof alternatives yet because in many cases, they're five to

44:14.560 --> 44:22.280
 10 times more efficient, but the crypto industry in general kind of knows that this is coming

44:22.280 --> 44:28.960
 eventually and it's ready to take the hit and switch to that stuff when we have to.

44:28.960 --> 44:34.360
 The second algorithm that is relevant to cryptography is Grover's algorithm.

44:34.360 --> 44:41.680
 And Grover's algorithm might even be more familiar to AI people that's basically usually

44:41.680 --> 44:44.520
 described as solving search problems.

44:44.520 --> 44:51.400
 But the idea here is that if you have a problem over the form, find a number that satisfies

44:51.400 --> 44:58.920
 some property, then if with a classical computer, you need to try and if n times before you

44:58.920 --> 45:05.080
 find a number, then with a quantum computer, you only need to do square root of n computations.

45:05.080 --> 45:13.120
 And Grover's could potentially be used for mining, but there's two possibilities here.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.040
 One is that Grover's could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working quantum

45:18.040 --> 45:22.800
 computer that could do Grover's will just mine way faster than everyone else and we'll

45:22.800 --> 45:27.880
 see another round of what we saw when ASICS came out, which is that kind of the new hardware

45:27.880 --> 45:32.560
 just kind of dominated the old stuff and then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium.

45:32.560 --> 45:41.600
 By the way, way faster, not exponentially faster quadratically faster, which is not sort of

45:41.600 --> 45:46.480
 it's not game changing, I would say it's like ASICS, like you said, it would be exactly.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.480
 Yeah.

45:47.480 --> 45:50.280
 So it would not necessarily break proof of work as a thing.

45:50.280 --> 45:51.280
 That's right.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.280
 Yeah.

45:52.280 --> 45:56.560
 Now, the other kind of possible world, right, is that quantum computers have a lot of overhead.

45:56.560 --> 46:00.320
 There's a lot of complexity involved in maintaining quantum states.

46:00.320 --> 46:06.840
 And there's also, as we've been realizing recently, making quantum computers actually

46:06.840 --> 46:11.520
 work requires kind of quantum error correction, which requires kind of a thousand real qubits

46:11.520 --> 46:13.240
 per logical qubit.

46:13.240 --> 46:17.920
 And so there's the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer

46:17.920 --> 46:22.400
 will be higher than the speed up you get with Grover's, which would be kind of sad,

46:22.400 --> 46:26.680
 but which would also mean that given proof of work, we'll just keep working fine.

46:26.680 --> 46:32.200
 So the beautifully put, so proof of work is the core idea of Bitcoin.

46:32.200 --> 46:36.920
 Is there other core ideas before we kind of take a step towards the origin story and ideas

46:36.920 --> 46:38.160
 of Ethereum?

46:38.160 --> 46:42.240
 Is there other stuff that were key to the white paper of Bitcoin?

46:42.240 --> 46:46.040
 There's proof of work and then there's just the cryptography, just kind of public keys

46:46.040 --> 46:50.120
 and signatures that are used to verify transactions.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.640
 Those two are the big things.

46:51.640 --> 46:57.240
 So then what is the origin story, maybe the human side, but also the technical side of

46:57.240 --> 46:58.240
 Ethereum?

46:58.240 --> 46:59.480
 Sure.

46:59.480 --> 47:06.200
 So I joined the Bitcoin community in 2011, and I started by just writing.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.960
 I first wrote for this sort of online thing called Bitcoin Weekly.

47:09.960 --> 47:16.760
 Then I started writing for Bitcoin Magazine, and sorry to interrupt, you have this funny

47:16.760 --> 47:25.120
 kind of story, true or not, is that you were disillusioned by the downsides of centralized

47:25.120 --> 47:28.640
 control from your experience with, wow, World of Warcraft.

47:28.640 --> 47:30.840
 Is this true or you're just being witty?

47:30.840 --> 47:37.040
 I mean, the event is true, the fact that that's the reason I do decentralization is witty.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.640
 Maybe just a small tangent.

47:39.640 --> 47:44.040
 Have you always had a skepticism of centralized control?

47:44.040 --> 47:50.360
 Is that sort of has that feeling evolved over time, or has that just always been a core

47:50.360 --> 47:55.720
 feeling that decentralized control is the future of a human society?

47:55.720 --> 47:59.400
 It's definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since I could have

47:59.400 --> 48:01.360
 learned that such a thing is possible.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.280
 It's possible, even technically.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.280
 So great.

48:04.280 --> 48:08.560
 So you joined the Bitcoin community in 2011, you said you began writing.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.640
 So what's next?

48:10.640 --> 48:15.840
 I started writing, moved from high school to university halfway in between that and

48:15.840 --> 48:20.000
 spent a year in the university.

48:20.000 --> 48:26.760
 Then at the end of that year, I dropped out to do Bitcoin things full time.

48:26.760 --> 48:31.520
 This was a combination of continuing to write Bitcoin Magazine, but also increasingly work

48:31.520 --> 48:37.040
 on software projects, and I traveled around the world for about six months and just going

48:37.040 --> 48:39.000
 to different Bitcoin communities.

48:39.000 --> 48:46.200
 I went to first in New Hampshire, then Spain, other European places, Israel, then San Francisco,

48:46.200 --> 48:51.040
 and along the way I met a lot of other people that are working on different Bitcoin projects.

48:51.040 --> 48:57.080
 When I was in Israel, there were some very smart teams there that were working on ideas

48:57.080 --> 49:00.840
 that people were starting to kind of call Bitcoin 2.0.

49:00.840 --> 49:06.160
 So one of these was Colored Coins, which is basically saying that, hey, let's not just

49:06.160 --> 49:10.080
 use the blockchain for Bitcoin, but let's also kind of issue other kinds of assets on

49:10.080 --> 49:11.080
 it.

49:11.080 --> 49:15.760
 Then there was a protocol called Mastercoin that supported issuing assets, but also supported

49:15.760 --> 49:21.920
 many other things, like financial contracts, domain name registration, and a lot of different

49:21.920 --> 49:24.160
 things together.

49:24.160 --> 49:33.800
 I spent some time working with these teams, and I quickly realized that this Mastercoin

49:33.800 --> 49:37.960
 protocol could be improved by kind of generalizing it more.

49:37.960 --> 49:41.440
 The analogy I used is that the Mastercoin protocol was like this Swiss Army knife.

49:41.440 --> 49:48.360
 You have 25 different transaction types for 25 different applications, but what I realized

49:48.360 --> 49:53.680
 is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more general purpose.

49:53.680 --> 49:59.280
 One of them was that you could replace three transaction types for three types of financial

49:59.280 --> 50:04.440
 contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial contract that just lets you

50:04.440 --> 50:09.720
 specify a mathematical formula for kind of how much money each side gets.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.400
 By the way, just a small pause.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.520
 What's, you say financial contract, just the terminology.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.520
 What is the contract?

50:15.520 --> 50:18.120
 What's the financial contract?

50:18.120 --> 50:24.840
 So this is just generally an agreement where kind of either one or two parties kind of

50:24.840 --> 50:32.760
 put collateral kind of in, and then depending on certain conditions, like this could involve

50:32.760 --> 50:37.480
 prices of assets, this could involve the actions of the two parties, it could involve

50:37.480 --> 50:44.240
 other things, they kind of get different amounts of assets out that just depend on

50:44.240 --> 50:45.240
 things that happened.

50:45.240 --> 50:52.920
 So a contract is really a financial contract, is it the core interactive element of a financial

50:52.920 --> 50:53.920
 system?

50:53.920 --> 50:58.600
 Yeah, there's many different kinds of financial contracts, like there's things like options

50:58.600 --> 51:02.840
 where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you have for some specific

51:02.840 --> 51:04.520
 price for some period of time.

51:04.520 --> 51:11.640
 There's contracts for difference where you basically are kind of making a bet that says

51:11.640 --> 51:15.880
 like, for every dollar this thing goes up, I'll give you $7 or for every dollar that

51:15.880 --> 51:20.160
 thing goes down, you give me $7 or something like that.

51:20.160 --> 51:24.080
 What the main idea that these contracts have to be enforced and trusted them?

51:24.080 --> 51:25.640
 Yes, exactly.

51:25.640 --> 51:29.880
 You have to trust that they will work out in a system where nobody can be trusted.

51:29.880 --> 51:30.880
 Yes.

51:30.880 --> 51:34.400
 This is such a beautiful, complicated system.

51:34.400 --> 51:42.200
 Okay, so you were seeking to kind of generalize this basic framework of contracts.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.680
 So what does that entail?

51:44.680 --> 51:48.960
 So what technically are the steps to creating Ethereum?

51:48.960 --> 51:53.800
 Sure, so I guess just to kind of continue a bit with this master coin story.

51:53.800 --> 51:58.320
 So started by kind of giving ideas for how to generalize the thing.

51:58.320 --> 52:03.760
 And eventually this turned into a much more kind of fully flushed proposal that just says,

52:03.760 --> 52:08.400
 hey, how about you scrap all your futures and instead you just put in this programming

52:08.400 --> 52:09.520
 language.

52:09.520 --> 52:15.640
 And I gave this idea to them and their response was something like, hey, this is great, but

52:15.640 --> 52:18.760
 this seems complicated and this seems like something that we're not going to be able

52:18.760 --> 52:21.040
 to put onto our roadmap for a while.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.720
 And my response to this was like, wait, do you not realize how revolutionary this is?

52:24.720 --> 52:26.720
 Well, I'll just go do it myself.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
 And then I...

52:27.720 --> 52:29.920
 What was the name of the programming language?

52:29.920 --> 52:32.560
 I just called it ultimate scripting.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.800
 Great.

52:33.800 --> 52:42.080
 So then I went through a couple more rounds of iteration and then the idea for Ethereum

52:42.080 --> 52:49.960
 itself started to form and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the

52:49.960 --> 52:55.880
 core unit of the thing is what we call contracts, it's these, and if accounts that can hold

52:55.880 --> 53:02.720
 assets and they have their own internal memory, but that are controlled by a piece of code.

53:02.720 --> 53:08.280
 And so if I send some Ether to a contract, the only thing that can determine where that

53:08.280 --> 53:15.480
 kind of Ether, the currency inside Ethereum and of course after that is the code of that

53:15.480 --> 53:17.040
 contract itself.

53:17.040 --> 53:24.720
 And so basically kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm

53:24.720 --> 53:29.320
 for creating these self executing agreements.

53:29.320 --> 53:30.320
 Self executing.

53:30.320 --> 53:34.280
 It's so cool that code is sort of part of this contract.

53:34.280 --> 53:37.600
 So that's what's meant by smart contracts.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.720
 So how hard was it to build this kind of thing?

53:40.720 --> 53:41.720
 Harder than expected.

53:41.720 --> 53:46.680
 And originally I actually thought that this would be a thing that I would kind of casually

53:46.680 --> 53:52.120
 work on for a couple of months, publish and then go back to university.

53:52.120 --> 53:57.000
 Then I released it and a bunch of people, or I released the white paper.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.560
 The white paper, the ideas there.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.240
 The idea, the white paper.

54:00.240 --> 54:04.200
 A whole bunch of people came in offering to how about a huge number of people and have

54:04.200 --> 54:05.200
 expressed interest.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.960
 And this was something I was totally not expecting.

54:08.960 --> 54:13.800
 And then I kind of realized that this would be something that's kind of much bigger than

54:13.800 --> 54:17.840
 I had ever thought that it would be.

54:17.840 --> 54:24.800
 And then we started on this kind of much longer developments log of making something that

54:24.800 --> 54:28.360
 lives up to this kind of much higher level of expectations.

54:28.360 --> 54:33.080
 What are some of the, is it fundamental like software engineering challenges?

54:33.080 --> 54:34.080
 It was.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.080
 Social?

54:35.080 --> 54:36.080
 Okay, so there's.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.080
 And social.

54:37.080 --> 54:43.000
 So what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about human civilization

54:43.000 --> 54:47.480
 and software engineering through this process?

54:47.480 --> 54:53.760
 So I guess one of the challenges for me is that like I'm one of the kind of apparently

54:53.760 --> 54:59.160
 unusual geek schools that have never treated with anything but kindness in school.

54:59.160 --> 55:07.040
 And so when I got into crypto, I kind of expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind

55:07.040 --> 55:10.280
 of altruistic and nice in that same way.

55:10.280 --> 55:17.160
 But the algorithm that I used for finding cofounders for this thing was not very good.

55:17.160 --> 55:20.560
 It was literally one computer scientist called the greedy algorithm.

55:20.560 --> 55:25.080
 It's kind of the first 15 people who applied back offering to help kind of are the cofounders.

55:25.080 --> 55:32.880
 Oh, you mean like literally the people that will form to be the cofounders of the community?

55:32.880 --> 55:33.880
 The algorithm.

55:33.880 --> 55:36.560
 I like how you call it the algorithm.

55:36.560 --> 55:45.120
 And so what happened was that these, especially as the projects got really big, like there

55:45.120 --> 55:49.840
 started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of, like I wanted the

55:49.840 --> 55:55.800
 thing to be a nonprofit and some of them wanted to be a for profit and then there started

55:55.800 --> 55:58.880
 to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other.

55:58.880 --> 56:04.640
 There were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot

56:04.640 --> 56:06.640
 of different ways.

56:06.640 --> 56:12.160
 And this just about six months later led to this big governance crisis.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.040
 And then we kind of reshuffled leadership a bit.

56:15.040 --> 56:20.040
 And then the project kept on going then nine months later, there was another governance

56:20.040 --> 56:23.440
 crisis and then there was a third governance crisis.

56:23.440 --> 56:28.480
 So is there a way to, if you're looking at the human side of things, is there a way to

56:28.480 --> 56:32.240
 optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world?

56:32.240 --> 56:38.400
 It seems that there is, from my perspective, there's a lot of different characters and personalities

56:38.400 --> 56:39.400
 and egos.

56:39.400 --> 56:48.320
 And like you said, I don't know, I also like to think that most of the people in the world

56:48.320 --> 56:59.680
 are well intentioned, but the way those intentions are realized may perhaps come off as negative.

56:59.680 --> 57:05.400
 Is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency where

57:05.400 --> 57:07.560
 everyone gets along?

57:07.560 --> 57:11.800
 Here about four rounds of reshuffle, I think we've actually come up with something that

57:11.800 --> 57:15.360
 seems to be pretty stable and happy.

57:15.360 --> 57:23.480
 I think, I mean, I definitely do think that most people are well intentioned.

57:23.480 --> 57:28.400
 I just think that like one of the reasons why I like decentralization is just because

57:28.400 --> 57:33.600
 there's like this thing about power where power attracts people with egos and so that

57:33.600 --> 57:37.800
 just allows us a very small percentage of people to just ruin so many things.

57:37.800 --> 57:44.120
 You think ego has a, you think ego has a use, like is ego always bad?

57:44.120 --> 57:46.120
 It sometimes does.

57:46.120 --> 57:53.000
 But then the Ethereum research team, I feel like we've found also kind of a lot of very

57:53.000 --> 57:59.960
 good people that are just, and if primarily you're just interested in things for the technology

57:59.960 --> 58:06.560
 and things seem to just generally be going quite well.

58:06.560 --> 58:07.560
 Yeah.

58:07.560 --> 58:11.200
 When you're, when the focus and the passions and the tech, so on the, so that's the human

58:11.200 --> 58:15.200
 side of things, but the technology side, like what have you learned?

58:15.200 --> 58:21.480
 What have been the biggest challenges of bringing Ethereum to life on the technology side?

58:21.480 --> 58:28.600
 So I think first of all, just, you know, there's like the first of all software developments,

58:28.600 --> 58:32.920
 which is that when someone gives you a timetable, switch the unit of time to the next largest

58:32.920 --> 58:38.160
 unit of time and add one, and like we basically fell victim to that.

58:38.160 --> 58:45.880
 And so instead of taking like three months, it ended up taking like 20 months to launch

58:45.880 --> 58:46.880
 the thing.

58:46.880 --> 58:53.840
 And that was just, I think, underestimating the sheer technical complexity of the thing.

58:53.840 --> 58:58.440
 There are research challenges, like so for example, one of the things that we've been

58:58.440 --> 59:02.840
 saying from the start that we would do, one is a switch from a proof of work to a proof

59:02.840 --> 59:09.720
 of stake, more proof of stake is this alternative consensus mechanism where instead of having

59:09.720 --> 59:13.640
 to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles that don't mean

59:13.640 --> 59:18.920
 anything, you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system.

59:18.920 --> 59:23.600
 And this, then it gives you some level of participation in the consensus.

59:23.600 --> 59:25.160
 Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit?

59:25.160 --> 59:27.560
 I understand the idea of proof of work.

59:27.560 --> 59:32.040
 I know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of stake is really appealing.

59:32.040 --> 59:35.560
 Can you maybe link Garner to longer explain what it is?

59:35.560 --> 59:36.600
 Sure.

59:36.600 --> 59:44.760
 So basically the idea is like, if I kind of lock up a hundred coins, then I turn that

59:44.760 --> 59:47.400
 into a kind of quote, virtual miner.

59:47.400 --> 59:54.480
 And the system itself kind of automatically randomly assigns that in a virtual miner is

59:54.480 --> 59:58.280
 a right to create blocks at particular intervals.

59:58.280 --> 1:00:03.240
 And then if someone else has 200 coins and they lock and lock those 200 coins, then they

1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:08.400
 get a kind of twice as big virtual miner they'll be able to create blocks twice as often.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:15.080
 So it tries to kind of do similar things to proof of work, except instead of the thing

1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:21.920
 and of rate limiting your participation being your ability to crank out solutions to kind

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:26.080
 of hash challenges, the thing that real limits your participation is kind of how much coins

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.080
 you're kind of locking into this mechanism.

1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:29.080
 Okay.

1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:30.080
 So interesting.

1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:37.440
 So that that limited participation doesn't require you to run a lot of compute.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:47.520
 Does that mean that the richer you are so rich people are more like their identities

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:50.640
 more right in this stable?

1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:54.840
 Yeah, verifiable or whatever, whatever the right terminology is.

1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:55.840
 Right.

1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:57.480
 And this is definitely a common critique.

1:00:57.480 --> 1:01:02.600
 I think my usual answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of

1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:03.600
 system.

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:04.600
 Exactly.

1:01:04.600 --> 1:01:05.600
 Yeah.

1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:06.600
 I didn't mean it in that statement as a criticism.

1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:07.600
 I think you're exactly right.

1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:11.160
 That's equivalent to proof of work is the same kind of thing.

1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:15.280
 But in the proof of work, you have to also use physical resources.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:16.280
 Yes.

1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:19.400
 And burn computers and burn trees and all of that stuff.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:25.200
 Is there a way to mess with the system of the proof of proof of stake?

1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:29.560
 There is, but you will once again need to have a very large portion of all the coins

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.960
 that are locked in the system to do anything bad.

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:32.960
 Got it.

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:33.960
 Yeah.

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:38.440
 And just to that, maybe take a small change in one of the criticisms of cryptocurrencies,

1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:43.480
 the fact that it gets for the proof of work mechanism, you have to use so much energy in

1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:44.480
 the world.

1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:45.480
 Yes.

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:50.000
 Is one of the motivations of proof of stake is to move away from this?

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:51.000
 Definitely.

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:52.720
 What's your sense of that?

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:54.360
 Maybe I'm just under informed.

1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:58.360
 Is there like legitimately environmental impact from this?

1:01:58.360 --> 1:01:59.360
 Yeah.

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:04.720
 So the latest thing was that Bitcoin consumed as much energy as the country of Austria or

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.120
 something like that.

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:07.120
 Yeah.

1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:10.840
 And then Ethereum is like right now, maybe only like half in order of magnitude smaller

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:11.840
 than Bitcoin.

1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:14.840
 I've heard you talk about Ethereum 2.0.

1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:18.560
 So what's the dream of Ethereum 2.0?

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:24.440
 What's the status of proof of stake as a mechanism that Ethereum moves towards?

1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:31.840
 And also, how do you move to a different mechanism of consensus within a cryptocurrency?

1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:37.440
 So Ethereum 2.0 is a collection of major upgrades that we've wanted to do to Ethereum

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:38.760
 for quite some time.

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:44.720
 The two big ones, one is proof of stake and the other is what we call sharding.

1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.920
 Sharding solves another problem with blockchains, which is scalability.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:54.520
 And what sharding does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:59.120
 having to personally download and verify every transaction, every participant in the network

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:04.000
 only downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions, and then you kind of randomly

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.200
 distribute who gets how much work.

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:12.600
 And because of how the distribution is random, it still has the property that you need a

1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:17.920
 large portion of the entire network to corrupt what's going on inside of any shard.

1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:22.600
 But the system is still very redundant and very secure.

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:23.600
 That's brilliant.

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:28.680
 How hard is that to implement and how hard is proof of stake to implement?

1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:32.120
 Like on the technical level, software level?

1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:33.920
 Proof of stake and sharding are both challenging.

1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:37.280
 I'd say sharding is a bit more challenging.

1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:41.760
 The reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change to how the consensus layer

1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:43.080
 works.

1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:47.320
 Sharding does both that, but it's also a change to the networking layer.

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:51.400
 The reason is that sharding is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still do what

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:55.760
 you do today, which is you kind of gossip everything, which means that if someone publishes

1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:01.120
 something, every other node in the client hears it from on the networking layer.

1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:04.840
 And so instead, we have to have subnetworks and the ability to quickly switch between

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.840
 subnetworks and other subnetworks, talk to each other.

1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:12.680
 And this is all doable, but it's a more complex architecture, and it's definitely the sort

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:15.200
 of thing that has not yet been done in cryptocurrency.

1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:21.920
 So most of the networking layer in cryptocurrency is you're shouting, you're like broadcasting

1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:25.280
 messages, and this is more like ad hoc networks.

1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:28.080
 Yeah, you're shouting within smaller groups.

1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:30.320
 Smaller groups, but you have like a bunch of subnetwork.

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:31.320
 Exactly.

1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:36.680
 And you have to switch between, oh man, I'd love to see the, so it's a beautiful idea

1:04:36.680 --> 1:04:43.240
 from a graph theoretic perspective, but just the software that, who's responsible?

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:48.000
 Is the Ethereum project, like the people involved, would they be implementing?

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:54.640
 What's the actual, this is like legit software engineering.

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:55.760
 How does that work?

1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:58.360
 How do people collaborate, build that kind of project?

1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:03.800
 Is this like almost like, is there a software engineering lead?

1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:08.520
 Is there, is it legit, almost like large scale open source project?

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:09.520
 There is, yeah.

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:14.440
 So we have someone named Danny Ryan on our team, who's just been brilliant and great

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:15.600
 all around.

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:22.360
 And he is a kind of de facto kind of development coordinator, I guess.

1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:25.040
 It's like, you have to invent job titles for this stuff.

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:30.240
 The reason is that, like we also have this unique kind of organizational structure where

1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:35.280
 the Ethereum foundation itself does research in house, but then the actual implementation

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:40.360
 is done by independent teams that are separate companies and they're located all around the

1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:45.120
 world and fun places like Australia.

1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:53.160
 And so you kind of just need a bunch of almost nonstop cat herding to just keep getting these

1:05:53.160 --> 1:05:58.640
 people to talk to each other and kind of implement this back, make sure that everyone agrees

1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:03.120
 on what's going on and kind of how to interpret different things.

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.920
 So how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms in Ethereum 2.0?

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:13.640
 What's your sense of the timeline keeping in mind the previous comment you made about

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:19.560
 the sort of general curse of software projects?

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:23.520
 So Ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases.

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:28.560
 So phase zero just creates a proof of stake network and it's actually separate from kind

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:33.280
 of proof of the proof of work network at the beginning, just to kind of give it time to

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:35.160
 grow and improve itself.

1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:36.160
 Do people get to choose?

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:37.160
 Sorry to interrupt.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:38.160
 Do people get to choose?

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:39.160
 I guess.

1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:42.320
 Yes, they get to choose to move over if they want to.

1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:47.360
 Then phase one adds sharding, but it only adds sharding of data storage and not sharding

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:49.160
 of computation.

1:06:49.160 --> 1:06:57.800
 And then after that, there is the merger phase, which is where the accounts, smart contracts,

1:06:57.800 --> 1:07:04.040
 all of the activity on the existing ETH1 system just kind of gets cut and pasted into ETH2

1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:08.880
 and then the proof of work chain gets forgotten and then all the things that were living there

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:13.520
 before just kind of continue living inside of the proof of stake system.

1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:24.720
 So for timelines, phase zero has been kind of almost fully implemented and now it's just

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:29.720
 a matter of a whole bunch of security auditing and testing.

1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:36.400
 My own experience is that right now it feels like we're at about a phase comparable to

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:41.360
 when we were doing the original Ethereum launch when we were maybe about four months away

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:42.360
 from launch.

1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:44.680
 But that's just a hunch.

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:46.680
 That's just a hunch.

1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:53.640
 So how it took over a decade for people to move from Python 2 to Python 3.

1:07:53.640 --> 1:08:00.920
 How do you see the move from this phase zero for different consensus mechanisms?

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:07.400
 Do you see there being a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to this better

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:08.720
 mechanism?

1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:14.320
 So in phase zero, I don't expect too many people to do much because in phase zero and

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:19.480
 phase one, the new chain doesn't have too much functionality turned on.

1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:23.300
 It's there just like if you want to be a proof of stake validator, you can get things started

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:28.440
 if you want to store data for other blockchain applications, you can get started.

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:32.560
 But existing applications will largely keep living on ETH1.

1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:39.080
 And then when the merger happens, then the merger is a operation that happens all at

1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:40.080
 once.

1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:44.840
 So that's one of the benefits of a consensus system that on the one hand you have to coordinate

1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:49.160
 the upgrade, but on the other hand, the upgrade can be coordinated.

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.200
 So what's Casper FFG, by the way?

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:57.840
 Casper FFG is the consensus algorithm that we are using for a proof of stake.

1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:02.800
 Is there something interesting specific about Casper FFG, like some beautiful aspect of

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:03.800
 it?

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:04.800
 There is.

1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:11.240
 So Casper FFG combines together kind of two different schools of like it's not sale

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:12.760
 growth I'm designed.

1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:17.000
 So the general two different schools of the design are right.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:23.280
 One is 50% fault tolerant, but dependent on network synchrony.

1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:29.560
 So 50% fault tolerant, but it tolerate up to 50% of faults, but not more, but it depends

1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:35.320
 on an assumption that all of the nodes can talk to each other within some of a limited

1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:36.320
 period of time.

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:40.640
 Like if I send a message, you'll receive it within a few seconds.

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:46.360
 And the second school is 33% fault tolerant, but safe under a synchrony.

1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:51.920
 Which means that if we agree on something, then that thing is finalized.

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:55.960
 And even if the network goes horribly wonky the second after that thing is finalized,

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:59.400
 there's no way to revert that thing.

1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:03.320
 That's fascinating how you would make that happen.

1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:06.200
 It's definitely quite clever.

1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:08.880
 I'd recommend the Casper FFG paper.

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:13.240
 If you just search like archive as in like ARX, IV, Casper FFG, it's right there.

1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:14.240
 That's an archive.

1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:15.240
 The paper's an archive.

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:16.240
 Yeah, yeah.

1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:17.240
 Who are the authors?

1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.040
 Myself and Virgil Griffith.

1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:21.040
 That's awesome.

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:23.640
 Take a small tangent.

1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:27.280
 This idea of just putting out white papers and papers and putting them on archive and

1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:32.080
 just putting them publicly, is that at the core?

1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:34.520
 Is that a necessary component of the currency?

1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:38.680
 Is that the tradition started with Satoshi Nakamoto?

1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:40.480
 What do you make of it?

1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:42.880
 Like what do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of ideas?

1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:44.320
 I guess so, yeah.

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:51.000
 And it's definitely something that's kind of mandatory for crypto because like crypto

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.640
 is all about making systems where you don't have to trust the operators to trust that

1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:57.720
 the thing works.

1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:03.680
 And so if anything behind how a system works is closed sourced, then that kind of kills

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:04.680
 the point.

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:10.960
 And so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental properties of the category

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:14.920
 of the thing we're trying to build just kind of forces openness.

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:19.120
 But also openness just has proven to be a really great way to collaborate.

1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:23.600
 And then there's actually a lot of innovation and academic collaboration that's just kind

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:27.920
 of happened ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years.

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:34.480
 So like for example, we have this forum called ETH research that's like ETH, R E S E A R

1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:36.840
 and then dot CH.

1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:43.000
 And there we publish kind of just ideas in a form that's kind of half formal.

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.200
 Like it's halfway in between.

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:50.960
 It's kind of a text write up and then you can have math in it, but it's often out of

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.080
 much shorter than a paper.

1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:58.600
 And it turns out that the great majority of new ideas, like they're just kind of fairly

1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:03.240
 small nuggets that you can explain in like five to 10 lines and they don't really need

1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:05.000
 the whole formality of a paper.

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000
 Exactly.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.560
 They don't require the kind of like 10 pages of a filler.

1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:11.320
 And so introduction conclusion is not needed.

1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:12.320
 Yeah.

1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:16.920
 And so instead you just kind of publish the idea and then the people can go comments on

1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:17.920
 it.

1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:18.920
 That's brilliant.

1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:19.920
 Yeah.

1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:20.920
 This has been great for us.

1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:21.920
 I think I interrupted you.

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:23.920
 Was there something else on Casper FFG?

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:29.240
 No, just Casper FFG is just kind of combines together these two schools.

1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:38.880
 And so basically it creates this system where if you have more than 50% that are honest

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:45.360
 then and you have a network synchrony, then the thing kind of goes as a chain, but then

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:49.960
 if network synchrony fails, then kind of the last few blocks in the chain might kind

1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:51.200
 of get replaced.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:59.520
 But anything that was finalized by this kind of more asynchronous process can't be reverted.

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:03.880
 And so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds between those two models.

1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:04.880
 Okay.

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:06.320
 So I know what I'm doing to them.

1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:09.040
 I'm going to be reading the Casper FFG paper.

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:16.240
 Apologize for the romanticized question, but what do you are some or the most beautiful

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:19.200
 idea in the world of Ethereum?

1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:23.040
 Just something surprising, something beautiful, something powerful.

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:24.040
 Yeah.

1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:28.880
 I mean, I think the fact that money can just emerge out of a database if enough people believe

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:33.920
 in it, I think is definitely one of those things that's up there.

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:39.760
 I think one of the things that I really love about Ethereum is also this concept of composability.

1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:45.720
 So this is the idea that if I build an application on top of Ethereum, then you can build an

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:50.920
 application that talks to my application and you don't even need my permission, you don't

1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:52.720
 even need to talk to me.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:58.280
 So one really fun example of this is there was this kind of game on Ethereum called CryptoKitties,

1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:01.080
 they're just involved in breeding digital cats.

1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:07.400
 And someone else created a game called CryptoDragons, where the way you play CryptoDragons is you

1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:15.840
 have a dragon and you have to feed it CryptoKitties and they just created the whole thing just

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:22.320
 like as an Ethereum contract that you would send these tokens that are defined by this

1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:24.320
 other Ethereum contract.

1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:30.040
 And for the interoperability to happen, the projects don't really need to, the teams don't

1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:35.360
 really need to talk to each other, you just kind of interface with the existing program.

1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:39.920
 So it's arbitrarily composable in this kind of way, so you have different groups that

1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:40.920
 could be working in.

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:46.000
 So you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kitties, you could build like

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.360
 entire ecosystems of software in this kind of way.

1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:55.800
 Yeah, especially in the decentralized finance space that's been popping up the last two

1:14:55.800 --> 1:15:01.000
 years, there has been a huge amount of really interesting things happen as a result of this.

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.080
 Is it a particular kind of like financial applications kind of thing?

1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:07.800
 Yeah, I mean, there's like stable coins.

1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:17.560
 So this is kind of tokens retain value equal to $1, but they're kind of backed by cryptocurrency.

1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:20.280
 Then there's decentralized exchanges.

1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:27.560
 So as far as decentralized exchanges goes, there's this really interesting construction

1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:32.640
 that has existed for about one and a half years now called Uniswap.

1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:38.960
 So what Uniswap is, it's a smart contract that holds the balances of two tokens, we'll

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:44.560
 call them token A and token B. And it maintains an invariant that the balance of token A multiplied

1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:47.760
 by the balance of token B has to equal the same value.

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:52.240
 And so the way that you trade against the thing is basically like you have this kind

1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:57.840
 of curve, you know, like X times Y equals K. And before you trade, it's at some points

1:15:57.840 --> 1:15:58.840
 on the curve.

1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:02.400
 After you trade, you just like pick any other points on the curve.

1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:05.920
 And then whatever the delta X is, that's the amount of A tokens you provide, whatever

1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:09.920
 the delta Y is, that's the amount of B tokens you get or vice versa.

1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:16.720
 And that's just kind of the slope at the current points on the curve kind of is the price.

1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:20.240
 And so that just is the whole thing.

1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:29.120
 And that just allows you to have this exchange for tokens and even if there's very few participants

1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:34.880
 and the whole thing is just like so simple and it's just very easy to set up, very easy

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:41.840
 to participate in and it just provides so much value to people.

1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:49.280
 And the fundamental, the distributed application infrastructure allows that somehow.

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:50.280
 Yes.

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:52.360
 So this is a smart contract meeting.

1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:55.680
 This is all a computer program that's just running on Ethereum.

1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:58.200
 Smart contracts too are just fascinating.

1:16:58.200 --> 1:16:59.200
 They are.

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:00.200
 Okay.

1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:05.200
 Do you think cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day?

1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:10.680
 So where do you think we're headed in terms of the role of currency, the structure type

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:12.720
 of currency in the world?

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:20.080
 I definitely expect fiat currencies to continue to exist and get in to be strong and I definitely

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:25.000
 expect kind of fiat currencies to also digitize in their own way over the next couple of decades.

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:26.520
 What's fiat currency by the way?

1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:31.480
 Oh, just like things like US dollars and like dollars and euros and yen and these other

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:32.480
 things.

1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:34.040
 And they're sort of backed by governments.

1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:35.040
 Yes.

1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:41.600
 And I also expect kind of cryptocurrencies to play this kind of important role in just

1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:46.840
 making sure that people always have an alternative if fiat currencies start breaking.

1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:53.240
 So like if or if you're in, you know, some kind of very high inflation place like Venezuela,

1:17:53.240 --> 1:18:04.760
 for example, or if your country just kind of gets cut off from other financial systems

1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:10.240
 because of like something the banks do, like if any kind of, if there's even like some

1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:15.960
 major trade disruption or something worse happens, then like cryptocurrencies are the

1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:19.960
 sort of thing that just because of their kind of global neutrality, they're just kind of

1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:22.280
 always there and you can keep using them.

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:27.720
 It's interesting that you're quite humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency.

1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:33.720
 You don't think there's a possible future where it becomes the main set of currency

1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:40.400
 because it feels like fiat, it feels like the centralized control by governments of

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:47.280
 currencies limiting somehow, maybe my naive utopian view of the world.

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:48.800
 It's definitely very possible.

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:59.600
 I mean, I think like for cryptocurrencies being the main form of value to work well,

1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:05.680
 like you do need to have some much more price stability than they have today.

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:09.880
 And I mean, there are now stable coins and there are kind of cryptocurrency is the try

1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:13.240
 to be more stable than existing things like Bitcoin and Ether.

1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:18.360
 But that just is to me the kind of the main challenge.

1:19:18.360 --> 1:19:22.280
 Do you think, oh, that's, do you think that's a characteristic of just being the early days

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:27.480
 is such a young concept that 10 years is nothing in the history of money?

1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:31.120
 Yeah, and I think it's a combination of two things, right?

1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:37.480
 One is it's it's still early days, but the other is a kind of more durable any kind

1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:42.440
 of economic problem, which is that the demand for currency is volatile, right?

1:19:42.440 --> 1:19:48.480
 Because of like, recessions, boom, changes to technology, lots of things, and if people's

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:51.760
 demand for how much currency they want to hold changes.

1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:57.200
 And if you have a currency that has a fixed supply, then the change in demand has to be

1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.560
 entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency.

1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:04.920
 And so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated

1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:10.180
 into volatility and ahead of prices of things that are dominated in that currency.

1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:15.400
 But if you have a currency where instead the supply can change, and so the supply can go

1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:20.880
 up when there's more demand, then you have the supply ahead of absorbing more of that

1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:21.880
 volatility.

1:20:21.880 --> 1:20:24.960
 And so the price of the currency would absorb loss of the volatility.

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:29.840
 On that topic, so Bitcoin does have a limited supply, a specific fixed supply.

1:20:29.840 --> 1:20:30.840
 Yes.

1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:37.280
 What's, what's the idea and Ethereum doesn't, but can you clarify?

1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:41.800
 Just in the comment you just made, is Ethereum qualified to the kind of currency that you're

1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:44.240
 talking about and being flexible in the supply?

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:50.200
 And it's a bit more flexible, but kind of the thing that you would really want is something

1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:58.040
 that's kind of specifically flexible in response to how valuable the currency is.

1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:01.080
 And I'd recommend, you know, look at stable coins as well.

1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:04.600
 So like things like dye, for example, that's like,

1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:06.600
 How do you spell that?

1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:07.600
 DAI.

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.480
 And what's stable coins?

1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:11.080
 Is it a type of cryptocurrency?

1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:13.040
 It is a type of cryptocurrency.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:18.480
 It's a type of cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract, one of these Ethereum

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:25.000
 computer programs, that where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether, and then it issue,

1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:30.640
 basically, like that people deposit, and then it issues DAI and the reason why people deposit

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:33.800
 is because they want to kind of go high leverage on their ether.

1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:37.520
 And so it kind of pairs these two sets of users, one that wants stability and one that

1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:41.120
 kind of wants extra risk together with each other.

1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:49.680
 And it basically creates or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:55.680
 paid, that they have this asset that can be later converted back into ether, but specifically

1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:57.040
 at kind of the one dollar rate.

1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.920
 And it has some kind of stabilizing network effects.

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:05.800
 Yeah, it has this, yeah, it has many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it.

1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:06.800
 That's fascinating.

1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:07.800
 Okay.

1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:09.880
 This world is awesome technically.

1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:14.240
 At least from a scientific perspective, it's an awesome world that I often don't see from

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:15.560
 an outsider's perspective.

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:24.680
 What I often see is kind of maybe hype and a little bit, if I may say so, like Charltonism.

1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:28.520
 And you don't often see, at least from my outsider's perspective, the beautiful science

1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:31.120
 of it and the engineering of it.

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:39.920
 Maybe, is there a comment you can make of who to follow, how to learn about this world

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:47.160
 without being interrupted by the Charlton's and the hype people in this space?

1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:51.920
 I think you do need to just know the specific kind of just people to follow.

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:57.000
 Like there's, you know, there's all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers

1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:03.240
 and there's just like, even just the Ethereum research crew, like myself, like Dan Cradd,

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:06.600
 Danny Justin and the other people.

1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:14.360
 And then, and of the academic cryptographers, and like before this today, I was at Stanford

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:20.280
 and Stanford has the Center for Blockchain Research and of Dan Bonet, that's really famous

1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:26.760
 and great cryptographer is running it and there's a lot of other people there.

1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:34.000
 And there's people working on zero knowledge proofs, for example, and Zuko from Zcash

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:38.160
 has one other person that I respect.

1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:44.360
 So I think if you follow the technical, you crawl along with the Ethereum group and then

1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:49.400
 look at the academics, Dave Bonet and so on, and then just cautiously expand the network

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:50.400
 of people you follow.

1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:51.400
 Yeah, exactly.

1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:56.880
 And like if someone seems too self promotional, then just like remove them.

1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:03.480
 Is there books that are, there's these white papers and we just discussed about about ideas

1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:06.200
 being condensed into really small parts.

1:24:06.200 --> 1:24:11.280
 Is there books that are emerging that are kind of good introductory material?

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:16.080
 So for historical ones, and there's like Nathaniel Popper's Digital Gold, which is

1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:18.360
 just about the history of Bitcoin.

1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:21.960
 There's like one, and then Matthew Lysing announced that there's one about the history

1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:23.680
 of Ethereum.

1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:28.600
 For technical ones, and there's Andrew Asensinopoulos's Mastering Ethereum.

1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:29.600
 Great.

1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:37.760
 So let me ask you sort of, sorry, to pull back to the idea of governments and decentralized

1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:45.440
 currency, you know, there's a tension between decentralization of currency and the power

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:53.240
 of nations, the power of governments, you, what's your sense about that tension?

1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:56.760
 Is there some rule for regulation of currency?

1:24:56.760 --> 1:25:03.600
 Yeah, is there like, is the government the enemy of digital currency, of distributed

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:08.960
 currency, or can they be like cautious friends?

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:16.000
 I mean, I think like, the one thing that people forget is that it's clearly not entirely

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:25.640
 an enemy because I think if there hadn't been so much government regulation on centralized

1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:32.360
 digital, issuing centralized digital currencies, then we'd be seeing things people like Google

1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:35.440
 and Facebook and Twitter just kind of issuing them left and right.

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:39.120
 And then like, if that was the case, then decentralized currencies would still appeal

1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:42.840
 to some people, but they definitely would appeal to less people than today.

1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:51.040
 So even in that sense, I think it's clearly been kind of more of a help, just kind of

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:56.440
 set the stage for the end of the existence as a sum of the sector in some ways.

1:25:56.440 --> 1:26:03.320
 But also, and I think some of both, you know, like there's definitely things that governments

1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:11.560
 kind of can do in some cases have done to have hurt the spread of growth of blockchains.

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:17.560
 There's things that they've done to help and they've in some cases definitely done a good

1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:23.880
 job of going after fraudulent projects and going after some of the projects that have

1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:28.720
 some of the craziest and most misleading marketing.

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:34.240
 There's also the possibility that governments will end up using blockchains for a lot of

1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:39.320
 different things, like, you know, governments, you know, they do a lot more than just regulating,

1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:40.320
 right?

1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:48.400
 But there's also like, they have the identity records and they have kind of like property

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:55.440
 registries, even their own currency is like secured, lots of different kind of things

1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:00.600
 that they're operating and there's even blockchain applications in a lot of those.

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:01.600
 Yeah.

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.600
 And they can, you know, they can leverage technology to do a lot of good for our societies.

1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:13.000
 It is a little unfortunate that governments often lag behind in terms of their acceptance

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000
 and leverage of technology.

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:22.120
 If you look at the autonomous vehicle space, AI in general, they're a few years behind.

1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:25.560
 It'd be nice to help them catch up.

1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.920
 That's always an ongoing problem.

1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:33.360
 You met Vladimir Putin to discuss the centralized currency here.

1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:35.840
 You're born in, where were you born?

1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:36.840
 Kolomna.

1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:39.800
 It's a city about 115 kilometers south of Moscow.

1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:40.800
 In Russia.

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:41.800
 Yes.

1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:42.800
 Yeah.

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:43.800
 I grew up in Moscow.

1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:49.080
 I mean, that's, Vladimir Putin is a central figure in this part of the world.

1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:53.600
 So what was that like meeting, meeting him?

1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:54.960
 What was that experience like?

1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:57.200
 He's taller in photos than in person.

1:27:57.200 --> 1:27:58.200
 Yeah.

1:27:58.200 --> 1:27:59.200
 Yeah.

1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:00.200
 That's right.

1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:04.040
 He's five, seven, I think, five, eight, maybe.

1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:05.040
 Yeah.

1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:09.880
 And that's, unfortunately, we didn't actually kind of have too much of a chance to talk

1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:10.880
 to him.

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:15.200
 Like I managed to see him for about one minute at the end of this meeting and I did get a

1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:20.480
 chance to see a lot, like some of the other end of government ministers and like he recommended

1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:21.480
 some.

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:30.000
 And some of them are actually interested in trying to use like blockchains to look for

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.080
 various government use cases, the kind of limit corruption and other things.

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:39.400
 And I have like, it's hard to tell from one conversation kind of what things are genuine

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:43.760
 and what things are just like, oh, blockchain is cool, let's do blockchain.

1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:50.960
 But, you know, when I listen to like Barack Obama talk about artificial intelligence,

1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:57.640
 there's certain things I hear where, okay, so he might not be an expert in AI, but he

1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:04.360
 like actually studied it carefully enough to think about it, like even if he's just

1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:09.360
 reading a Wikipedia page, like he really thought about what this technology means.

1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:15.760
 Did you get a sense that Putin or some of the ministers like thought about blockchain,

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:19.840
 like thought about the fundamentals of technology, like understand it intuitively?

1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:23.640
 Or are they too old school to try to grasp it?

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:26.920
 Summer old school, summer more new school.

1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:27.920
 It depends.

1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:30.200
 It's definitely like depends on who you talk to.

1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:34.920
 I mean, that's an open question for me with Putin because Putin has said stuff about AI.

1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:35.920
 I don't know.

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:38.160
 I've only talked to him for about one minute, so.

1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:42.000
 But sometimes you can pick up sort of insights.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.000
 As a quick comment, they're, they're about, maybe you can correct me on this, but they're

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:49.840
 about 3,000 cryptocurrencies being actively traded.

1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:50.840
 Yes.

1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:55.440
 And Ethereum is one of, you know, a lot of people believe that there will be the main

1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.440
 crypto currency.

1:29:56.440 --> 1:30:00.840
 I think Bitcoin is currently still the main cryptocurrency, but Ethereum very likely might

1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:04.480
 become that, the main one.

1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:07.200
 Is this kind of diversity good in the crypto world?

1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:09.080
 Do you see it sticking around?

1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:10.720
 Should there, should there be a winner?

1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:15.880
 Like should there be some consensus globally around Bitcoin or around Ethereum?

1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:17.640
 Like what's your, what's your sense?

1:30:17.640 --> 1:30:19.480
 I definitely think the diversity is good.

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:24.520
 And I definitely think also that there's probably too many people trying to make separate

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:26.880
 blockchains kind of right now.

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:30.480
 The numbers should definitely be greater than one and probably greater than two or even

1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:31.480
 five.

1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:32.480
 Not 3,000.

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:38.360
 Not 3,000, yeah, and also not even like 40 high quality platforms that try to do the

1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:39.360
 same thing.

1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:46.520
 And there's definitely this range from just like one person who just like wrongly thinks

1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:51.680
 that you can create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours and doesn't even think about kind

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:58.280
 of the community aspects of maintaining it, going to people actually trying, but only

1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:04.920
 creating a really tiny one to like scammers, to people like making something that's actually

1:31:04.920 --> 1:31:06.520
 successful.

1:31:06.520 --> 1:31:11.760
 And then, you know, there's a lot of different categories of blockchain and of project in

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:14.920
 terms of what it's trying to do and what applications it's for.

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:20.000
 And I think the experimentation is definitely healthy.

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:25.160
 If you look at the two worlds, there might be a little bit disjoints, but the distributed

1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:29.880
 applications, cryptocurrency, and in the world of artificial intelligence, do you see there's

1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:35.920
 some overlap between these worlds that both worry about centralized control?

1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:40.880
 Is there some overlap that's interesting that you think about, do you think about AI much?

1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:41.880
 Yeah.

1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:48.160
 And I think definitely kind of thought about things like the AI and if control problems

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:50.600
 and aligned to problems and all of those things.

1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:53.280
 Do you worry about the existential threat of AI?

1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:56.360
 It's definitely one of the things I worry about.

1:31:56.360 --> 1:32:05.240
 I think there's a lot of kind of common challenges because in both cases, what you're ultimately

1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:12.080
 trying to do is you're trying to get a simple system to direct a more complex system.

1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:17.800
 In the case of strong AI, the idea would be that the simple system is people and the

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:24.880
 complex system is whatever thing the people end up unleashing on the universe that will

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:28.800
 hopefully be a great thing.

1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:35.040
 In the case of blockchains, the simple thing is the algorithm, which is a piece of static

1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:41.640
 and fully open source code, and the more complex thing is just all of the different possible

1:32:41.640 --> 1:32:48.480
 and if human actors and the strategy is that they might end up used to participate in the

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:49.640
 network.

1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:51.400
 Do you think about your own mortality?

1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:55.080
 What you hope to accomplish in your life in the context?

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:59.760
 I definitely think about ending my own mortality.

1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:02.480
 If I gave you the option to live forever, would you?

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:05.360
 It depends a lot on what the fine bridge is.

1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:10.560
 If it's one of those things where I'm going to be kind of like floating through empty space

1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:13.360
 for 10 to the 75 years, then no.

1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:27.560
 If it's forever worth of having a fulfilling life with friends to spend the time with,

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:34.680
 with meaningful challenges to explore and interesting things to be working on, then

1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:37.680
 I think absolutely.

1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:39.080
 That's beautifully put.

1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:43.720
 It's forever, but you'd have to check the fine print.

1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:46.200
 I think there's no better way to end it, Vitalik.

1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:48.320
 Thank you so much for talking to us.

1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:53.800
 So exciting to follow your work from a distance and thank you for creating a revolutionary

1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:58.240
 idea and sticking with it and building it out and doing some incredible engineering work.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:33:59.240
 Thanks for talking today.

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:00.960
 Thank you.

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:04.680

 And now let me leave you with some words from Vitalik Buterin.

1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:41.800
 The thing that I often ask startups on top of Ethereum is, can you please tell me why

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:44.800
 using Ethereum blockchain is better than using Excel?

1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:49.920
 And if they can come up with a good answer, that's when you know you got something really

1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:51.720
 interesting.

1:34:51.720 --> 1:35:06.560
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
