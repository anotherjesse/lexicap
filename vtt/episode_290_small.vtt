00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
 When you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?

00:04.120 --> 00:10.040
 No, it's kind of a, it's just a, I never think opening, I never think final.

00:10.040 --> 00:14.040
 I think soundscape of how I'm feeling right now.

00:14.160 --> 00:18.240
 So it could be the middle of the song for all I know when I'm, you know, when I'm doing that.

00:18.240 --> 00:25.360
 But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody and music really come at the same time.

00:25.360 --> 00:33.280
 Like, I, by same time, I mean, I'm, I'm a, as I'm expressing, maybe, you know, I'm feeling like

00:40.560 --> 00:43.680
 Like, it's not that simple, but it's like, I'll, I'll hear it.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.360
 Like, it's like, here's all the orchestra and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.280
 And melody in my voice is just one of those instruments.

00:51.280 --> 00:58.480
 The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds, the lead singer of Imagine Dragons,

00:58.480 --> 01:03.920
 one of the most popular bands in the world with over 75 million records sold and with

01:03.920 --> 01:10.560
 four songs being streamed over a billion times on Spotify. Given all that, Dan is one of the most

01:10.560 --> 01:16.880
 down to earth, kind, thoughtful, and fascinating human beings I've ever met, grounded in part

01:16.880 --> 01:24.080
 by his lifelong struggled mental health. The darkness, the love, and the creative brilliance

01:24.080 --> 01:29.680
 are all there in this one humble mind. For this reason, and many others would became fast friends.

01:30.240 --> 01:35.520
 Plus, he recently started his journey in programming, which funny enough is where we start this

01:36.080 --> 01:41.920
 wide ranging, deeply personal, and fun conversation. This is Alex Friedman podcast.

01:41.920 --> 01:47.840
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now dear friends, here's Dan

01:47.840 --> 01:53.120
 Reynolds. So we were talking offline that you're not just getting into programming.

01:53.120 --> 01:58.480
 What's the most beautiful program you've ever written? Something that brought you joy.

02:00.960 --> 02:07.040
 There's something I really love completion. It's the reason that I'm addicted to songwriting.

02:07.040 --> 02:13.840
 I like there being nothing and then having some blocks or tools and building them into

02:13.840 --> 02:18.640
 what you want it to look like. And then I find it incredibly rewarding to

02:20.160 --> 02:24.720
 stand back and look at what you did at the end. It could be anything for me. It's

02:24.720 --> 02:30.880
 it was as simple to begin with as just, you know, because it's object oriented, like

02:30.880 --> 02:37.920
 making a cube move. Simple as that. Understanding that and knowing that I built that and made it do

02:37.920 --> 02:46.160
 that is really rewarding. And I think it's the thing that drew me into wanting to learn more.

02:47.440 --> 02:52.720
 But as far as what is some grand, like some big piece of code that I've done, like,

02:52.720 --> 02:57.600
 absolutely not. It's more, I'm still a level where it's more like, what is a tutorial that I followed

02:57.600 --> 03:03.840
 and got, you know, and then, you know, yeah. So I couldn't say I'm at a level where I've

03:03.840 --> 03:07.840
 done anything beautiful at all in code. But you're also interested in potentially,

03:08.560 --> 03:10.720
 like your heart is drawn to creating games.

03:12.080 --> 03:12.960
 Creating anything.

03:14.000 --> 03:14.960
 And completing it.

03:14.960 --> 03:15.680
 Yeah.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.920
 That's the good, the feel good as it's done.

03:18.560 --> 03:25.760
 Yeah. I mean, I've been working over the last two years with actually a team out of Kiev on,

03:25.760 --> 03:31.120
 and we can get into that as a whole nother story, but on a computer game. And really,

03:31.120 --> 03:36.880
 I've kept that kind of under wraps, but yeah, we're kind of getting to a point now where

03:36.880 --> 03:42.160
 we have a prototype that we can play and it's a lot of fun. And thankfully, all the team members

03:42.160 --> 03:47.040
 are in safe places now. Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit. But, you know,

03:47.040 --> 03:52.640
 when that started is when I really decided, okay, I need to understand base level coding

03:52.640 --> 03:57.760
 and C sharp. So I'm not an idiot talking to these people. And so it's, you know,

03:57.760 --> 03:59.040
 we've been doing that for a couple of years.

03:59.040 --> 04:04.720
 So any parallels between the final completion that you feel with programming,

04:04.720 --> 04:08.720
 which I think is a little bit more definitive, like there's debugging, the code doesn't work,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.840
 it's messing and so on. There's the early design stages, you're not sure,

04:12.480 --> 04:16.640
 like how to have functions and classes, how it's all going to work. And then it comes together,

04:16.640 --> 04:19.840
 and it's really done because it works. And there's a cube moving on the screen.

04:19.840 --> 04:25.520
 Right, right. Is there any parallels between that and music? Because are you really ever done,

04:25.520 --> 04:32.480
 done with a song? It's exactly the same thing for me, just in that it's art.

04:33.360 --> 04:40.720
 I really believe that we have not fully encapsulated artists. Like when we say art,

04:40.720 --> 04:50.800
 I think most people think, okay, the medium must be painting or drawing or music or writing. But

04:50.800 --> 04:57.040
 I really believe anytime you're creating something, engineers, for instance, you're

04:57.040 --> 05:01.440
 creating something with tools that you have, and it can be incredibly beautiful.

05:03.280 --> 05:09.600
 And so yeah, I think, and it's never done. I feel like I look at songs that I've done,

05:09.600 --> 05:16.240
 and I never felt you have to let go or I have to let go. And that's all I've,

05:16.240 --> 05:21.360
 I'm just continually making myself let go. But I look at songs that I've done and wish

05:22.240 --> 05:27.280
 I had done more or kept going down that road and what would have happened. And I'm really

05:27.280 --> 05:34.000
 contained to, because of what our band is and what our fans expect, and there's so much more to it

05:34.000 --> 05:41.120
 that it's like, I'm fitting in a box always. It's like this song shouldn't be longer than

05:41.120 --> 05:46.240
 three minutes and 30 seconds. And I don't know if I remember the chorus after I heard it. Maybe I

05:46.240 --> 05:51.680
 need to hear the chorus three times instead of those two times. There's certain, especially in

05:51.680 --> 06:02.720
 pop music, it's really hard to... Yeah, it feels like there's confines, even though people are

06:02.720 --> 06:06.800
 like, well, there's no confines, but still everybody's writing a pop song that's a few minutes.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.920
 Are those explicit in your mind, or are they just kind of... The gut is, like you said,

06:11.920 --> 06:16.560
 chorus. Should you have chorus once, twice, or three times? Is that a gut thing or is that a

06:16.560 --> 06:21.280
 rule thing? I think it's a rule. I mean, it's obviously a rule I impose on myself. Nobody's

06:22.480 --> 06:27.440
 in my house saying, hey, Dan, if you don't do this, I'm going to punish you. There's no major

06:27.440 --> 06:32.960
 label president that's like, imagine Dragons needs to make pop music, Dan. You know what I mean? My

06:32.960 --> 06:41.280
 manager doesn't even tell me that. I do it because it's what I perceive to be enjoyable. I grew up

06:41.280 --> 06:47.920
 listening to a ton of pop music, and then I ended up being in what is quote unquote a rock band,

06:47.920 --> 06:54.080
 which I've never perceived it as that, but that's kind of what the world has called it, and that's

06:54.080 --> 07:02.080
 fine. So you're a prisoner of a prison that you yourself constructed. There you go. The confines

07:02.080 --> 07:06.960
 are yours. I'm a happy, I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm a happy prisoner of the prison that I

07:06.960 --> 07:11.600
 have created for myself, and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion. So you worked

07:11.600 --> 07:21.600
 with Rick Rubin. What does Rick think about your prison? Rick was interesting to hear

07:21.600 --> 07:31.360
 his outside opinion when we first met because my biggest focus for so much of my life, my biggest

07:31.360 --> 07:37.920
 fear was, and this stems from, I think, middle schools when it started, but everyone being in

07:37.920 --> 07:46.640
 on a joke except for yourself. The thought of thinking you're good at something and really

07:46.640 --> 07:50.000
 you're terrible at it, and you're surrounded by people who are saying, yeah, you're good at it,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.480
 and then by themselves are like, he's terrible at this, and not just in regards to music or art,

07:56.480 --> 08:02.160
 but anything in life. And I think maybe from having six older brothers, it stems from that too,

08:02.160 --> 08:11.040
 like always feeling inadequate and like the annoying younger brother. But anyway, so Rick's,

08:12.000 --> 08:17.360
 and that's something I've learned to let go of is I've gotten older and had life experiences, but

08:17.360 --> 08:22.640
 one of the things that Rick said really early on that has stuck with me was he said, yeah,

08:24.320 --> 08:28.400
 we were resuming the first time we met. He said, I'd really like to work with you because I feel

08:28.400 --> 08:36.800
 like you're not confined to a sound. You've done a lot of different sounds, and so it's exciting

08:36.800 --> 08:41.840
 because I feel like your fans are forgiving more than other rock bands or bands because most people

08:41.840 --> 08:48.720
 when they hear a band, it's like there's a very specific sound with it. It's like they do folk

08:48.720 --> 08:58.800
 music, or they do California rock, or they do surf, or they do, and your fans kind of want that,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.080
 they want them to do that thing, and then they don't do it. And sometimes that goes well,

09:04.080 --> 09:08.960
 but a lot of times it doesn't. And people in critics and everybody is like, go back to the

09:08.960 --> 09:19.520
 thing that you did good and do that. Rick felt, whether he was right or wrong, that we could do,

09:20.480 --> 09:25.760
 we hopped genre so much. And that's been to our benefit and detriment, I think.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.000
 Why detriment?

09:29.280 --> 09:36.480
 Because people want you to be something. You can believe it more. It's like...

09:36.480 --> 09:38.880
 It's more authentic if you never change.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.160
 I guess. I don't know. I mean, it's certainly it's not something I subscribe to because I create

09:44.160 --> 09:51.280
 music, but I also grew up listening to a lot of different genres. I would listen to Cat Stevens,

09:51.920 --> 09:58.160
 and the next song would be like Biggie, and then the next song would be Nirvana. It was like, I like

09:58.160 --> 10:04.320
 a lot of it, and then Billy Joel, and then Enya. It was like, you know what I mean? I was a product,

10:04.320 --> 10:10.160
 and I was a product of the 90s, which if you listen to 90s music, it really was a lot of

10:10.160 --> 10:14.640
 reason that people say, well, 90s were terrible. Like a lot of people say that. I love the 90s

10:14.640 --> 10:24.480
 were my favorite decade of music. There was a lot of genre hopping, and I don't know. I love that.

10:24.480 --> 10:30.000
 She had the 90s had the boy bands, and it had Pearl Jam and Nirvana.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.160
 And it had a lot of women of the 90s was probably my biggest influence,

10:37.440 --> 10:43.040
 kind of that angry rock women of the 90s, like Lannis Morsett, Jag of Little Pills,

10:43.040 --> 10:51.040
 one of my favorite records of all time. The lyrics were so intimate, and I don't know if

10:51.040 --> 10:55.360
 she was angry or not. Sorry if she wasn't. Yeah, but there was an anger to it.

10:55.360 --> 11:01.680
 There was angst. Yeah, it was angstiness. And that in hip hop of the 90s influences me,

11:01.680 --> 11:05.360
 and then my dad. So anything my dad listened to, which my dad didn't listen to any of that,

11:05.360 --> 11:10.800
 my dad listened to like Harry Nelson, The Beatles, Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon,

11:11.760 --> 11:15.680
 Billy Joel. It was very much like singer songwriter.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.040
 Do you mind if we throughout this listen to a few songs, because you mentioned here in this

11:19.040 --> 11:25.440
 and I was actually yesterday and the day before listening to a lot of his stuff. And it's just like,

11:26.800 --> 11:35.840
 damn, he's good. And not as known as he should be. Like I was getting, do you mind if I play?

11:35.840 --> 11:42.000
 No, please. Yeah. I don't know, not to open this conversation with a love song.

11:42.000 --> 11:51.040
 I would like that actually. But without you is an incredible song. Oh man, that's yeah.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.520
 And the heartbreak in the in the longing.

12:00.400 --> 12:06.080
 What? He's the best to do it in my opinion. In my opinion, he's the best to do it.

12:06.080 --> 12:12.800
 I guess that's just the vocal range. And just the sadness of like

12:17.680 --> 12:23.040
 there's something I don't even want to talk over him because this is one of my favorite songs too.

12:23.040 --> 12:30.240
 But I think people have a really good bullshit indicator. And

12:30.240 --> 12:37.920
 music, in my opinion, whenever I meet a young artist and say, well, I'm trying to make a new

12:37.920 --> 12:44.480
 band and I want to do something like how to be successful, I really think understanding that

12:44.480 --> 12:49.760
 people have a really good bullshit indicator is the most important part of being an artist.

12:49.760 --> 13:02.320
 And I'll explain what that means, at least to me. I think that in order to have success or be a

13:02.320 --> 13:08.000
 leader or or whether it's an art or anything, people need to believe that you believe what you're

13:08.000 --> 13:16.400
 doing. I think the best actors, really when they're doing their thing, it's like they,

13:16.400 --> 13:24.320
 it's not acting. They're in it. And it's how they feel. And they're expressing that sorrow or joy

13:24.320 --> 13:33.120
 or whatever it is. Harry, for me, Harry Nelson, I just believe it. He sings that and I feel it.

13:33.120 --> 13:37.840
 And whether he's the greatest bullshit or of all time, or I don't think that's the case,

13:37.840 --> 13:42.960
 I think he probably was singing that song and he just could transport himself to wherever he was.

13:42.960 --> 13:51.600
 It's what makes a great live act. It's what makes a great song. And someone could be the best actor

13:51.600 --> 14:00.000
 and sing that in the same timber, same EQ, same compression, same everything. And there's some

14:00.000 --> 14:06.320
 unknown there that I, you know, I don't, I think hopefully it will be known at some point at some

14:06.320 --> 14:11.280
 scientific thing, but there's something there that the energy or something that people can perceive

14:11.280 --> 14:18.640
 it and say, true or false. And if it resonates, it's true. It's so much more meaningful and it lives

14:18.640 --> 14:25.360
 on. And if it doesn't, that for me is what is good art or bad. Like for people to dispute over,

14:25.360 --> 14:31.840
 like, well, sonics should sound like that's silly to me. It's like a song or even a painting. Like

14:31.840 --> 14:41.120
 it's just the truthfulness of it. Yeah, the, the truly great art ghost has to go to that place

14:41.120 --> 14:45.600
 where you really are feeling it. Like you forget that you're being recorded. If you get there as an

14:45.600 --> 14:52.800
 audience, you really are feeling it. Yeah, which I totally agree with you. One of the things that I

14:52.800 --> 15:02.720
 love about the internet is it's brought the bullshit detector of the masses to power,

15:02.720 --> 15:09.840
 which is beautiful, because then the masses uplift the really authentic. And even if you

15:09.840 --> 15:14.560
 didn't write the song, I think it helps a lot probably if you wrote the song. But, you know,

15:14.560 --> 15:20.240
 I was, I was, I was a little bit, maybe a lot since we're in Vegas, a little heartbroken that

15:20.240 --> 15:27.920
 to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs. But I like, for example, Rocket Man, Elton John,

15:29.280 --> 15:34.480
 like to find out that Elton John didn't really know where the words of Rocket Man came from,

15:35.120 --> 15:39.920
 meaning like the depths of it. It's interesting. But nevertheless, he's super authentic,

15:40.640 --> 15:46.800
 because for Elton John and for Elvis, there's something in the, in the fun and the darkness

15:46.800 --> 15:51.600
 and the entertainment of it. Like he goes to some place in his mind that might not be deeply

15:51.600 --> 15:56.960
 connected from where the lyrics came from. But he relates it. He relates it to whatever is in his

15:56.960 --> 16:02.800
 mind and goes to that place emotionally. Yeah. And that's what I think it is. And that's why an

16:02.800 --> 16:08.800
 actor, like I said, can be completely honest to me. Maybe they didn't write the script. But I

16:08.800 --> 16:12.800
 write off, like I've always written all my own lyrics. It's a really personal thing to me.

16:12.800 --> 16:21.520
 But I will say, I see people all the time who are performers like Elton John, for instance,

16:22.160 --> 16:28.880
 who didn't write the lyrics that I believe that they, it means just as much to them as what I

16:28.880 --> 16:35.440
 wrote, because they find the meaning in it for themselves, at least the greats do. And I think

16:35.440 --> 16:40.960
 that that's the difference maker. And I think you can perceive, and I'm sure you've seen art

16:40.960 --> 16:46.240
 that doesn't move you. And maybe it moves someone else. But for you, for some reason, you perceive

16:46.240 --> 16:52.800
 it to be uninteresting to you. And I feel like a lot of the time, I'm going to say that it's,

16:52.800 --> 16:56.720
 of course, sonically, maybe it's uninteresting to you. But I think the majority of the time,

16:56.720 --> 17:03.760
 for myself, I can find inspiration in any sonic value or painting as long as I see it,

17:03.760 --> 17:06.080
 and I feel truth from the person that created it.

17:06.080 --> 17:12.960
 Yeah. But for me, the lyrics, maybe not the entirety of the lyrics, but a few words can

17:14.000 --> 17:18.240
 do wonders to take you to a place. And sometimes those words don't need to be connected with

17:18.240 --> 17:24.000
 the other words. That's the beauty of music. They're allowed to float in the space of mixed

17:24.000 --> 17:29.200
 metaphors. They're allowed to just jump around and somehow it paints a picture without actually,

17:29.200 --> 17:36.080
 what is it, glycerine by Bush? Right. But it's also how the person says it, right? It's like,

17:36.960 --> 17:42.320
 it's the feeling of exactly, and the same person could say that word 10 other ways,

17:42.320 --> 17:48.160
 and you don't care. But someone says glycerine or whatever it is. And it's like, oh, you know

17:48.160 --> 17:53.840
 what? I feel that for some way. The way he said that, he meant it to me. You know what I mean?

17:53.840 --> 18:01.600
 And no, I can't forget this evening, or your face as you were leaving, but I guess that's

18:01.600 --> 18:08.320
 just the way the story goes. You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows. Yes, it shows.

18:10.160 --> 18:18.400
 Let me ask you to analyze this song. So there's a lady possibly who's leaving him.

18:18.400 --> 18:23.680
 Do you think he's leaving her or she's leaving him? She wants to...

18:23.680 --> 18:32.080
 When I think of all my sorrow, when I had you there, but then I had let you go.

18:34.320 --> 18:43.280
 And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know.

18:43.280 --> 18:48.640
 And then the chorus is, I can't live if living is without you. I can't live, I can't give anymore.

18:48.640 --> 18:55.440
 He's got a voice on him. Yeah, he does. And if you really,

18:56.000 --> 19:00.720
 there's been some incredible documentation on his life and the end of his life. And

19:02.640 --> 19:07.760
 so my answer to this is probably skewed based on what I've seen about his life, too. But he was

19:07.760 --> 19:18.880
 a real alcoholic at the end of his life and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.080
 So when I hear that, I perceive it as

19:25.280 --> 19:30.640
 someone who is destructive and in a destructive place in life and can't love someone properly.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.920
 And so they can't live with them, but they can't live without them type thing,

19:33.920 --> 19:42.080
 which is really something that I really identify with and I think is one of the struggles of life

19:42.080 --> 19:52.000
 is loving yourself enough. It's forgiving yourself for things and letting yourself love someone else.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.360
 And at least when I listen to that, I hear Harry being like, and maybe I'm wrong, but this is how

19:57.360 --> 20:04.960
 I perceive it at least is not loving himself and feeling like he's deserving of this person.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.760
 Like, I have to let you go. I hear that, of course, and people are like, oh, well,

20:07.760 --> 20:12.400
 he's breaking up with her. But there's so much more complexity and nuance to the relationships.

20:14.560 --> 20:22.320
 My wife and I went through really difficult separation. And that's a story for another day

20:22.320 --> 20:28.080
 or a different question or something. But the nuance of it makes me think of this when I hear

20:28.080 --> 20:35.120
 this, which is there's just more to being with someone or not being with someone than, hey,

20:35.120 --> 20:40.880
 I think that person's really attractive or hey, that person makes me laugh or not. I love them

20:40.880 --> 20:45.840
 and now I don't love them. Love is such a complex nuanced thing that a lot of times

20:45.840 --> 20:52.320
 there's just more going on behind the scenes, I think. Yeah. On a small tangent on that,

20:52.320 --> 20:57.520
 just as a curious question, have you paid any attention to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard

20:57.520 --> 21:03.440
 trials? I have watched quite a bit of it because my wife really loves it and she watches it in bed

21:03.440 --> 21:10.400
 at night. So it's raw. Like, to me, it's because you mentioned how complicated love can be. And

21:10.400 --> 21:17.040
 it's, I've never seen, I don't care about the celebrity nature of it. I don't care who it is,

21:17.680 --> 21:23.840
 but it's just laid out in such raw form. For the world to see it. For the world to see the

21:23.840 --> 21:31.600
 toxicity, but also the passion and the clearly sort of the drugs and the drinking, but also like

21:32.560 --> 21:39.680
 the longing and the dreams. And I will always be with you. I will die for you. The places,

21:39.680 --> 21:48.880
 the rollercoaster of love, and it's all there at the end, past the end. So it's like, I've also

21:48.880 --> 21:54.560
 recently reread The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich about Hitler, Nazi Germany. It's the rise

21:54.560 --> 22:00.160
 and the fall. And it's interesting to look at the entirety of that process after it's all over,

22:00.160 --> 22:04.400
 many, many decades after it's all over. That book in particular, written by the person that was

22:04.400 --> 22:11.680
 actually there. And so here we're seeing two people in the context of the courtroom analyzing

22:11.680 --> 22:17.120
 this rise and fall of a love affair. It's fascinating. You know, the truth is, I was

22:17.120 --> 22:20.960
 telling my wife this actually just the other day, because she was asking me when I thought about it.

22:22.160 --> 22:28.480
 It makes me really sad. It's humorous. Don't get me wrong. There's a lot of parts in it that are

22:28.480 --> 22:36.240
 just really funny. But I look at it and I also see the internet. Someone's always the villain

22:36.240 --> 22:41.280
 and someone's the hero, which is such a funny thing. And we talked a little about this offline

22:41.280 --> 22:46.880
 before we got on this. But I have a real firm belief in life that it's just more complex than

22:46.880 --> 22:55.760
 you think. Always, always. And Johnny, for instance, is very charismatic. And you love him

22:55.760 --> 23:00.400
 and he's funny in the way he does things and he looks certain ways and he says things.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.520
 He's just, you really love him. And I feel like, and maybe I'm wrong on this, but it looks like

23:05.520 --> 23:11.600
 the internet has really been like, Johnny is the winner. Amber is the villain. And I kind of look

23:11.600 --> 23:17.360
 at it. Yeah. And I kind of look at it and I feel like, were any of you in their bedroom? Were any

23:17.360 --> 23:23.760
 of you there for these things? And I'm not saying one way or the other. All I see when I look at

23:23.760 --> 23:32.160
 that is two people with a lot of deep seated hurt, anger. And that anger is so poisonous to both of

23:32.160 --> 23:38.080
 them. And they're getting through it in the way that they only know how. And I'm not saying we

23:38.080 --> 23:43.520
 shouldn't be able to look at parts of it and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something.

23:43.520 --> 23:50.880
 But just that there's not a hero. It's more complicated. Yeah. I think unless you've been

23:50.880 --> 23:55.120
 living with Amber and Johnny, you don't know, just because one seems more charismatic in the

23:55.120 --> 24:01.280
 moment or funnier or more believable even, doesn't mean that their truth is the truth.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.480
 And I feel like there's still love there too, which makes, oh, that's the hardest part. He won't

24:08.480 --> 24:13.120
 even look at her. He looks down the whole time. And maybe people say, well, it's because it's

24:13.120 --> 24:20.400
 anger or, or hurt or whatever. But I, the way that she looks and stuff, it feels, it just feels

24:20.400 --> 24:26.160
 like there's so much hurt there that it hurts, it hurts me to watch it. I just feel like, oh,

24:26.160 --> 24:30.480
 my heart just like aches for them and, and for both of them. And I don't know either of them

24:30.480 --> 24:36.160
 personally. And, you know, I don't know, just hurts. But it's, I've never, I've never seen

24:36.160 --> 24:44.320
 sort of love laid out in this raw kind of way. It makes me feel better about, like, it almost

24:44.320 --> 24:50.080
 gives you, seeing people have gone through a struggle in this sort of mundane kind of way,

24:51.200 --> 24:55.200
 gives you room to struggle yourself about the messiness of love.

24:55.200 --> 24:55.760
 So true.

24:55.760 --> 25:00.560
 Like you're supposed to, like relationship is supposed to be simple and whatever. But this

25:00.560 --> 25:02.000
 like, oh man, this.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.640
 It's like art.

25:03.520 --> 25:03.760
 Yeah.

25:04.960 --> 25:10.480
 And for the record, like, I don't feel like it shouldn't be shown. Like, I think it's actually

25:10.480 --> 25:14.000
 really beautiful art. And I agree, there's going to be a lot of people who walk away from it and

25:14.000 --> 25:17.440
 are changed in certain ways or look at things different. I'm not saying it's changed in the

25:17.440 --> 25:20.800
 whole world, the Johnny Depp trial, but it's art. It's just like a, you would look at a painting

25:20.800 --> 25:27.920
 and it might affect you. My only commentary is more that there's not, I think it's silly when

25:27.920 --> 25:32.480
 people say who's right and who's wrong and who's the clear villain and who's the, like, we love

25:32.480 --> 25:36.080
 as humans, we have to have an answer for everything. We have to put everything in a box. And it's

25:36.080 --> 25:41.200
 like, well, we're looking at this and we're deciding you're right and you're wrong. And,

25:41.200 --> 25:46.160
 and I just think it's, it's silly unless it's your life. So speaking of heroes and villains and

25:46.160 --> 25:52.480
 highs and lows, you grew up in Las Vegas. And you said that Vegas is a performing town, a town of

25:52.480 --> 25:58.960
 high stakes, drama and eccentricity. It's a town of high highs and low lows. And I'll be damned

25:58.960 --> 26:05.280
 if my therapist didn't point out that correlation out to me personally a long time ago. So to me,

26:05.280 --> 26:13.440
 Vegas from the outside is romanticized by certain movies. The lows define the beauty of this town

26:14.160 --> 26:22.720
 and certain movies. So to me, Casino with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone,

26:24.240 --> 26:29.520
 leaving Las Vegas with Nicolas Cage, if you're unloading Las Vegas with the

26:29.520 --> 26:36.640
 with the Chinese template, Hunter Stompson. First of all, what's your favorite

26:37.600 --> 26:45.600
 representation of Vegas from a darker side? And do you draw any wisdom insight from the

26:46.880 --> 26:51.200
 the darkness, the lows and the highs from in those movies? Or is it over romanticized?

26:51.200 --> 26:59.920
 So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family. And Vegas was established by the Mormons and

26:59.920 --> 27:06.960
 the mob. Those were like the two very different worlds that created what Vegas is. And if you

27:06.960 --> 27:13.520
 live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways because Vegas has the strip and the parties

27:13.520 --> 27:18.960
 and the craziness, but it also has very like neighborhoods and big families and

27:18.960 --> 27:25.920
 and conservative people and liberal people living together in a really interesting way.

27:27.040 --> 27:34.000
 And for me, growing up here, for instance, was a lot of like driving on the freeway,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.920
 my mom being like, children, close your eyes. There's a naked woman on that billboard and

27:37.920 --> 27:42.640
 everything. Okay, mom, on our way to church, you know what I mean? It was like, but also being like,

27:42.640 --> 27:52.560
 whoa, this is crazy. You know, taking in whatever I could when I could. So I saw and I'm grateful

27:52.560 --> 27:56.160
 for that. Like I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon in, for instance, like

27:56.160 --> 28:01.600
 Utah or something like the typical place, because I saw both sides and I appreciated

28:01.600 --> 28:06.240
 something from both sides. And now as a person now who's not religious, but just spiritually

28:06.240 --> 28:15.040
 minded, you know, I, I, I'm grateful for that divergent character, that juxtaposition, dual

28:15.040 --> 28:22.240
 edged sword that Vegas is. And I try to apply that to everything in life, which is like Johnny

28:22.240 --> 28:26.240
 Depp and Amber. It's like, there's two sides to every story. There's always two sides to every

28:26.240 --> 28:30.320
 coin. There's always, you know, and there's something to be said for both. Like I try to see

28:30.320 --> 28:38.080
 people and even if, you know, it's just, yeah, I try to apply that to life. As far as a movie

28:38.080 --> 28:43.520
 that personifies Vegas or something in that medium that personifies Vegas in a way that,

28:44.560 --> 28:51.440
 that resonates with me. Don't say hangover. No, no, yeah. I also like, I wasn't even allowed to

28:51.440 --> 28:57.120
 watch PG 13 movies growing up. So I, a lot of the movies that you're saying, like I, I didn't,

28:57.120 --> 29:00.800
 I either didn't see, I didn't have cable television. You know, I wasn't like a pilgrim,

29:00.800 --> 29:06.800
 but I had a really, really conservative upbringing. So it didn't define your intellectual, like

29:06.800 --> 29:12.320
 development. No, no, I just, I can't think of any movie that comes to mind where I'm like,

29:12.320 --> 29:16.080
 that's my Vegas movie. You know what I mean? Like I'm sure I've seen some of the movies you've said

29:16.080 --> 29:22.000
 now, but I don't, I can't think of one that I'm like, actually personifies Vegas in a way

29:22.000 --> 29:28.400
 that feels honest to me. Like, or, or, or, like, wasn't there a Chevy, was there a Chevy Chase?

29:28.400 --> 29:33.040
 Yeah, yeah. I think that's maybe the only one I thought of that came to mind where I was like,

29:33.040 --> 29:37.920
 because I love Chevy Chase so much that maybe it's one of his Vegas, Vegas vacation or something.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.160
 Yeah. So, but that's more like lighthearted surge, that kind of stuff.

29:42.160 --> 29:47.440
 Right. It's not like, I guess what I would say is there's no truth that has been, that I've seen

29:47.440 --> 29:54.000
 of Vegas because what I see of Vegas is there's obviously like the parties and stuff in the

29:54.000 --> 29:58.720
 nightlife, which I'm not a big party person. So I haven't really experienced much of that.

29:58.720 --> 30:04.160
 But I've also, there's also drugs and I've, I have a strange relationship with drugs. I've

30:04.160 --> 30:10.160
 lost a few friends to drug overdoses. And so I don't, that's not romantic to me. But there's also

30:10.160 --> 30:16.720
 like, yeah, I mean, you asked for a dark reflection of it. I guess I certainly see a dark reflection

30:16.720 --> 30:22.000
 to Vegas. And I don't, I feel like Vegas is typically personified. It's like, at the tables

30:22.000 --> 30:26.240
 and everything is this, but it's also like, I have like friends who've lost all their money

30:26.240 --> 30:32.720
 to gambling addiction. And so it's like, what I guess, somebody maybe needs to make,

30:32.720 --> 30:38.320
 maybe that's an open spot. There needs to be a dark side to Vegas. And it's about Mormons in Vegas

30:38.320 --> 30:47.040
 that's just a giant drug overdose or getting shot by the mob. Yeah. So you mentioned your

30:47.040 --> 30:55.120
 spirituality. You've, you said that having a crisis of faith or just the philosophical question

30:55.120 --> 31:02.560
 of asking who is God, does God exist? Or in thinking of the flip side of that, of mortality,

31:02.560 --> 31:11.360
 what happens when we die, those kinds of things were extremely difficult, deep things for you

31:11.360 --> 31:17.120
 in terms of your development, the whole process of figuring that out. Why does it hurt so much to

31:17.120 --> 31:24.800
 lose faith in God? Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God, let's say that, is an obsession

31:24.800 --> 31:36.160
 for me and has been since I was young. I really feel that I'm a deep, deeply committed to finding

31:36.160 --> 31:40.720
 answers in life. And there's some answers that I don't think there's an answer to. And I'm also

31:40.720 --> 31:46.080
 very OCD by nature. So I just don't give up to that. I'm like, well, there must be somewhere

31:46.080 --> 31:50.800
 in Tibet. There's some teacher or there's somebody out there that has the answer.

31:50.800 --> 31:58.800
 Or maybe it's yet to be found. I'm going to find it. I'm really, my life has been to date,

31:59.520 --> 32:07.520
 probably unhealthily committed to finding answers about God or the lack thereof and

32:08.560 --> 32:13.040
 mortality. It's all I sing about. It's all our records have been about.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.800
 Who do you think is God? Have you ever gotten a glimpse?

32:16.800 --> 32:23.280
 You know, I will say the closest I feel like I have been to experiencing God is,

32:24.720 --> 32:31.280
 and this sounds so, maybe, I don't know. I don't know how it sounds, but it's through

32:31.280 --> 32:38.000
 ayahuasca for me. That's my honest answer for you. I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope

32:38.000 --> 32:47.840
 of there being anything greater than us being evolving and being here and then dying and

32:47.840 --> 32:52.400
 you're gone and that's it. And from nothingness we came and nothingness we go.

32:53.520 --> 32:59.440
 Where I am now, which is there are answers to be found. I don't know them. I don't know what

32:59.440 --> 33:03.920
 God looks like or if God is anything to do with the word God in the way that we say it.

33:03.920 --> 33:10.480
 But I do believe pretty fervently that there is more to be found.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.000
 Is it motion sensor or no? I don't know what that was.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.880
 Looked like they have all died actually. Do you know which one of it? Is it this one right here?

33:18.880 --> 33:22.880
 Yeah. Why don't I just take it out but then we can do garb and just find the phone here.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.480
 Take it out.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.880
 Do you want to hold this chair? Let's see if I can get it like this.

33:30.880 --> 33:37.760
 Yeah. I'm almost there. I really don't know.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.800
 There's got to be like someone saying about this. There we go.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.080
 It's not Chinese problem. Yeah.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.720
 How many people does it take to? What is it on school?

33:52.720 --> 33:57.360
 A light bulb. A light bulb. It was hot too. It was like us doing like the two finger technique.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.240
 Yeah. I'm glad you survived that. Thanks.

34:00.880 --> 34:04.640
 That'd be pretty ironic if we're talking about mortality and then this would be it for you.

34:07.760 --> 34:13.040
 I've never done ayahuasca so it's a mixture of two plants. One of them is DMT but a lot of people

34:13.040 --> 34:21.440
 I really respect. Very, very intelligent people. I had profound experiences with ayahuasca.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.360
 What is that? Where do you go? Where does the mind go? What the heck is up with that?

34:25.360 --> 34:32.000
 I'll first say that I can't even smoke weed. I really do not enjoy it

34:33.040 --> 34:41.200
 because I hate to let go of control. If I feel out of control in life, it's one of my biggest

34:41.200 --> 34:48.960
 weaknesses. It's very scary for me. Some people really enjoy letting go in that way. I really don't.

34:48.960 --> 34:56.720
 I was pretty terrified to make the jump then to ayahuasca but my wife who I deeply respect

34:59.520 --> 35:03.920
 made a profound change through ayahuasca and I saw it.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.960
 She led the way.

35:04.960 --> 35:11.840
 Yeah. It wasn't a strange. I think we have a thing in America that's like a misconception,

35:11.840 --> 35:21.280
 a stigma on psychedelics where it's a drug and it makes some people crazy and then you're going

35:21.280 --> 35:27.840
 to be on the street and you're going to be out of your mind or you're going to become a crazy person

35:27.840 --> 35:33.840
 basically. I think I really bought into that notion because again, I wasn't even raised with

35:33.840 --> 35:40.720
 cable TV. Ayahuasca is very… You can imagine what that was like for a Mormon kid. I didn't

35:40.720 --> 35:44.080
 know anything about it and never touched drugs at all and never even touched a cigarette.

35:46.960 --> 35:52.160
 Anyway, so I think we have this misconception about it where Americans are quick to go to their

35:52.160 --> 36:04.400
 doctor and take any medication or drug but whoa when it comes to psychedelics.

36:04.400 --> 36:11.520
 Anyway, that being said, so I had that trepidation going into it but I really love and respect my

36:11.520 --> 36:18.560
 wife and I saw it make a profound impact in her life where she suddenly was able to heal from a

36:18.560 --> 36:24.240
 lot of trauma that she had. She went through a lot in her life and it really helped her heal

36:24.240 --> 36:31.200
 but it also set her in a new path spiritually that seemed really like a place that I wanted to be.

36:31.200 --> 36:37.840
 So I did it and I did it twice. The first time it didn't really have an effect on me which happens

36:37.840 --> 36:44.240
 to a lot of people I guess. I drank this little thing and there was this shaman who came over

36:44.240 --> 36:52.640
 from overseas that had been in the plant world for decades and was a really incredible…

36:54.080 --> 36:56.640
 I don't even know if he likes to be called shaman but…

36:56.640 --> 37:05.120
 So it's supposed to be like 30, 60 minutes to take effect and a few hours. The journey lasts…

37:05.120 --> 37:06.320
 About four hours.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.280
 Four hours.

37:07.280 --> 37:12.640
 Yeah, so the second time I took it I took it in I would say 20, 30 minutes in. Exactly. I started

37:14.320 --> 37:25.920
 to feel like I was the dimension of what is reality. The curtain was pulled open and there was

37:25.920 --> 37:32.960
 a lot more to discover and it really blew my mind in a way that I think it would probably blow

37:32.960 --> 37:39.040
 anybody's mind if, for instance, God descended or some Christian God or whatever it is. We all

37:39.040 --> 37:42.720
 think it'd be this beautiful thing but in reality it would probably make people super fearful and

37:42.720 --> 37:49.920
 think that they've lost their mind. I've always joked that if the Mormon God came down and told

37:49.920 --> 37:56.640
 my mom, like, if God himself came down and told my mom, Mormonism is incorrect, she would say, Satan!

37:59.280 --> 38:06.240
 I think our minds are just not prepared for a lot of anything that's really extreme and it was

38:06.240 --> 38:12.480
 very extreme. It was like the curtain of life was cut open which scared me but then I felt

38:12.480 --> 38:17.440
 very much and a lot of people that I've talked to have a similar thing where I felt very much

38:17.440 --> 38:24.960
 like I was either communicating with something that was perceived as God to me or highest sense of

38:24.960 --> 38:30.480
 self or mind or Mother Earth or, you know, it's called so many different names but it's really,

38:30.480 --> 38:38.240
 it's very, a lot of people have a very spiritual, similar experience with ayahuasca and just in

38:38.240 --> 38:43.760
 that it's like this kind of profoundness. It wasn't like, there was nothing at least for me that was,

38:43.760 --> 38:49.920
 that felt like just like psychedelic funny cartoons or something. It was like, I'm about to go on a

38:49.920 --> 38:55.600
 journey and it's, and I'm gonna communicate, I'm communicating with something that feels incredibly

38:55.600 --> 39:01.440
 wise, showed me a lot of things in my life, kind of almost like from a bird's eye, almost like I was

39:01.440 --> 39:06.400
 looking through a video camera at a younger me. There was a particular thing that it communicated

39:06.400 --> 39:20.000
 to me. I really have a hard time with accepting success and not feeling like feeling undeserving

39:20.000 --> 39:25.120
 or something. I can't quite put it into words but of my position and what I've been given,

39:25.120 --> 39:32.880
 I've been given so much. And it showed me this thing from when I was young and explained to me

39:32.880 --> 39:40.960
 why I am, where I am now. And to this day, it did not feel like myself telling myself that.

39:40.960 --> 39:45.040
 That's the only way I can explain it. And there was a lot more that it showed me and

39:45.040 --> 39:54.240
 that was incredibly healing for me. But just to be like, to put it into a short thing because

39:54.240 --> 40:03.760
 there's so much to this, it felt, I walked away feeling very convinced that there is more to be

40:03.760 --> 40:13.440
 known for sure. And a lot of my deep things that were traumatic for me didn't feel traumatic anymore,

40:14.160 --> 40:21.760
 specifically crisis of faith. I was very angry at my parents and my community for raising me

40:21.760 --> 40:32.240
 in what I perceived to be falsehoods. And that, I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed

40:32.240 --> 40:37.600
 was ripped out for me in my 20s. And then it was like, good luck in life. But really,

40:37.600 --> 40:42.720
 my parents had given me everything that they could. And they believed that very much so still.

40:43.840 --> 40:49.440
 But a naive young me was angry and felt like they had been duped and thus I had been duped.

40:49.440 --> 40:56.320
 But ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like, this is truth and you're concerning yourself

40:56.320 --> 41:01.440
 about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever it is. And there may be some truth in

41:01.440 --> 41:06.480
 that tiny grain of sand. And there may be falsities. But so is all these other grains of sand,

41:06.480 --> 41:11.440
 like focus on the truth. Stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless and forgive

41:11.440 --> 41:16.640
 and let go of people believing in those things to begin with. I don't know if that makes sense,

41:16.640 --> 41:23.600
 but that was like the core thing I was taught and to let go of control. Stop needing to control

41:23.600 --> 41:28.080
 everything. And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere. Like it's really, I

41:29.200 --> 41:36.000
 do not believe, at least in my current self, I don't have that, the mindfulness that I believe

41:36.000 --> 41:40.160
 that exists in me to reach a lot of the conclusions that I did. And there was a lot more to it

41:40.160 --> 41:45.920
 that would be for like a late night conversation with you. But it's so hard to put it into,

41:47.440 --> 41:51.360
 you feel like a crazy person. At least at any time I talk about ayahuasca to someone who hasn't

41:51.360 --> 41:55.600
 done it, I'm like, I don't even know where to begin. Like, how do you explain to someone that

41:55.600 --> 42:01.680
 you felt like that a multiple dimension type thing happened in a way that, like putting

42:01.680 --> 42:06.400
 it into words is, and none of it was words, by the way, that was communicated to me. It was like,

42:06.400 --> 42:12.000
 you know how people talk about telepathy? And if it existed, it would be like,

42:12.000 --> 42:16.640
 I could communicate to you in such a deeper way. I'm so confined by me having to articulate these

42:16.640 --> 42:21.040
 words and put them in a sentence to you, Lex. And then tell you, like, if only I could just be like,

42:22.240 --> 42:25.840
 yeah, and emotions do that sometimes, right? You could see my emotions and be like,

42:26.400 --> 42:31.280
 oh, that communicates a lot. So that's what it felt like to me with ayahuasca is it felt like

42:31.280 --> 42:37.920
 it was communicating to me very clear things. But it wasn't like, Daniel, it's me, Mother Earth.

42:38.480 --> 42:44.400
 Let me relax, sit back, let me show you. But it was very clear to me what was being said.

42:44.400 --> 42:49.600
 And no, it did not feel like me. But maybe science, smarter people than me who've done it,

42:49.600 --> 42:53.360
 would say, well, it was you and blah, blah, blah. I don't know. But it was very convincing.

42:53.360 --> 42:59.680
 There's a lot of stuff in that subconscious that we haven't explored. Like, we haven't

42:59.680 --> 43:04.320
 explored the depths of the ocean. We haven't really figured out what's that the younging

43:04.320 --> 43:09.920
 shadow, what's going on underneath the surface of our conscious mind. And what is that connecting

43:09.920 --> 43:14.720
 to? Is that is that just inside our mind? Or is it some kind of, is there some kind of collective

43:14.720 --> 43:20.800
 intelligence going on where all humans are connected to one kind of greater organism?

43:20.800 --> 43:26.400
 Like, what is consciousness? We have a lot of hubris and thinking we understand any of it,

43:26.400 --> 43:34.080
 like how the mind works at all. Like, what is it? Like, where, what is the origin of consciousness?

43:34.720 --> 43:40.400
 What is the origin of intelligence? There's a lot of hubris about this. We would give each other

43:40.960 --> 43:45.680
 PhDs and Nobel Prizes and congratulate ourselves as if we figured it all out.

43:46.640 --> 43:51.600
 But humility is helpful here. Nevertheless, that is the question that humans have been asking for.

43:51.600 --> 43:59.520
 Ever since humans were humans, which is the question of mortality, the question of God.

44:02.400 --> 44:07.600
 So whether it's Hamlet to be or not to be, I think that's the hardest, the most important

44:07.600 --> 44:19.440
 question. Albert Camus asked, why live? So in terms of crisis of faith, in terms of your search

44:19.440 --> 44:24.000
 for truth, in terms of some of the dark places you've gone in your mind, what's the good answer

44:24.000 --> 44:36.000
 to this question? So for Camus with mythosisyphus, it was the question of suicide. What's the purpose?

44:37.280 --> 44:42.800
 Like, what's a good answer to why I keep going, especially when you're struggling, especially

44:42.800 --> 44:51.040
 when you're not, when you're feeling hopeless, when you're feeling like a burden

44:52.800 --> 44:58.320
 in this search for truth, when you feel like you're surrounded by lies, what's the good answer to why

44:58.320 --> 45:07.600
 I live? You ever found one? Well, the simple answer right now is to say for, it's very easy once you

45:07.600 --> 45:12.720
 have kids to say, the right answer is you just, of course, you brought these kids into the world,

45:13.360 --> 45:19.760
 so you have a responsibility that I feel deeply as a father to them to always be there for as

45:19.760 --> 45:25.760
 long as I humanly can, and to take care of them and protect them. It's the most innate sense in

45:25.760 --> 45:34.480
 me. It's wired in my animal existence. So if I take that away, because that's kind of cheating.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.520
 Let's put that aside, because it is cheating. It's cheating.

45:37.520 --> 45:41.040
 You're still, there's still some fundamental way in which you're alone.

45:41.680 --> 45:49.280
 Yeah. And to that, that actually has been a real struggle for me for many years. I had a

45:49.280 --> 45:59.920
 real turning point early in my career, where we were flying somewhere overseas, and we're in a

45:59.920 --> 46:07.040
 really small plane, and the lights went out, and all these red lights were flashing, and the plane

46:07.040 --> 46:14.080
 just started to dive. Completely scariest plane experience I've ever been in. My manager was

46:14.080 --> 46:22.240
 next to me, who's my brother. He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye. That's how crazy this

46:22.240 --> 46:32.640
 moment was. Was it genuine? Genuine engine went out, plane is going down, pilots looking crazy

46:32.640 --> 46:39.680
 in the front, and it was a really tiny jet. And like I said, my brother next to me crying, typing

46:39.680 --> 46:48.160
 a text to his wife. Really, really scary. And I felt nothing. I genuinely sat there and I was like,

46:48.160 --> 46:57.040
 this might actually be nice. I really felt like this goes down, and like,

46:58.880 --> 47:03.680
 man, life sucks and it's hard. And that sounds so ridiculous, I know to say, because again,

47:03.680 --> 47:08.400
 I'm in a different place now, and I see my life for what it is. But at that moment, I did not.

47:09.120 --> 47:12.880
 So life was primarily defined by suffering. It was a burden. And this is what I felt.

47:12.880 --> 47:20.160
 I was incredibly depressed. I had been trying different medications since I was

47:20.160 --> 47:26.400
 young, and I just had not found anything that was working for me. And then I was in a faith crisis,

47:26.400 --> 47:34.240
 lost all my faith, started a band that just became, I wasn't ever thinking that this band. I was like,

47:34.240 --> 47:37.920
 when you call your band Imagine Dragons, you're not thinking that band's gonna be big, okay?

47:37.920 --> 47:45.600
 It was like, this was like a side project that was fun for me. It was like art in college.

47:45.600 --> 47:50.160
 I was in school, and I was like, man, I hate this biology class. I'm gonna write down band names.

47:50.160 --> 47:56.160
 Like, you know what I mean? Like, it was not, hey, put everything aside. This is my career.

47:56.160 --> 48:04.000
 Let's go. Like, it just, it happened. And I'm an introvert by nature. I'm really not an

48:04.000 --> 48:09.760
 extroverted person who likes to go out and like, I like to be at home with a couple friends and

48:09.760 --> 48:14.080
 have a late night conversation over good food. Like that to me is a perfect night.

48:14.080 --> 48:19.920
 Read a good book. Listen to a podcast. Go on a walk. You know, those are things that I really,

48:19.920 --> 48:25.280
 really enjoy. And suddenly I'm in this life where I'm like supposed to be something that I really

48:25.280 --> 48:30.400
 don't want to be, except for on stage, which is a really fast and like strange thing to me, which

48:30.400 --> 48:37.040
 is on stage, I feel so free and exuberant and like an extrovert. And then I come off and I just feel

48:37.040 --> 48:42.640
 like shrivel back into a show. Like it's a, it's, music does that for me and performing on a stage

48:42.640 --> 48:46.080
 does that for me. Can we take a small tangent on that? Yeah, yeah, of course. What's the high,

48:46.800 --> 48:53.280
 can we go through that, the introvert that wants to cuddle up and read a book? You're the frontman

48:53.280 --> 49:00.720
 of one of the, if not the biggest rock bands today, playing in front of huge crowds.

49:02.880 --> 49:06.560
 What's the high of that? And how can you land back on earth?

49:10.000 --> 49:21.520
 The high of it is, it's incredibly beautiful to walk on a stage, sing these songs that you wrote

49:21.520 --> 49:28.160
 and see it resonate with people around you and sing with them. Different cultures, different places

49:28.880 --> 49:35.280
 celebrate life. It suddenly, the world seems like a fantastic place. It feels like we're all on the

49:35.280 --> 49:40.720
 same team. It's like one big hug. Yeah, it's like everybody in that room gets it and they all,

49:40.720 --> 49:48.800
 like it just, it feels like what you want the world to be, which is just like this coexisting

49:48.800 --> 49:55.760
 unit of people. And it's not even about like, you know, I just, it's incredible. It's for sure,

49:55.760 --> 50:00.640
 it's incredible. And I love it. And I wouldn't do it unless I loved it. And then you walk off stage

50:00.640 --> 50:04.320
 and you turn on the news and it's like, you see, you know, we're all against each other,

50:04.320 --> 50:08.080
 everybody hates each other. And it feels that way in the world. So music really,

50:09.280 --> 50:13.040
 that's why live music is so important to people. That's why music is so important to people.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.960
 Because even if it's just you and that person that wrote the song, you're listening to it. And

50:16.960 --> 50:23.680
 the two of you feel connected. You know, it's like, you're hearing Tracy Chapman sing like

50:23.680 --> 50:29.120
 fast car or something. You're just like, oh my gosh, like, yes, I get it. And you feel connected

50:29.120 --> 50:33.440
 that person, you don't feel alone. Like, so that's the high of it, for sure. And then you get off

50:33.440 --> 50:40.320
 stage and then, you know, as my, like my uncle is a heart surgeon, incredible heart surgeon who

50:40.320 --> 50:45.840
 like writes the book, like he's like the guy that the heart surgeons talk to, he's out of Nashville

50:45.840 --> 50:53.840
 Tennessee. He's just incredible, genius man. He always worries and always reached out to me. He's

50:53.840 --> 50:59.120
 like, musicians die all the time. The reason they die, you know, is because you're getting on stage

50:59.120 --> 51:01.840
 and your heart's doing this and your cortisol levels are doing this, you're getting off stage

51:01.840 --> 51:06.480
 and then you're just doing this. And it's a really real thing. Like you get off stage and you feel

51:06.480 --> 51:12.960
 like you need drugs because you're like, I, the world feels like, oh, incredibly daunting. And

51:12.960 --> 51:17.600
 it's also, I'm sure, has to do with like some, some like health things in your heart and the

51:17.600 --> 51:23.600
 cortisol levels that are so crazy. And then you come off and it's like, I know people are like,

51:23.600 --> 51:29.280
 well, then nothing's enough except meth. Yeah. Nothing's enough except heroin. And that's why

51:29.280 --> 51:33.200
 a lot of artists turn to that stuff. And I don't say it in a preach, I don't say it in a preachy

51:33.200 --> 51:41.360
 way. Like I've struggled with drug abuse in my life. And I really, I understand why artists turn

51:41.360 --> 51:50.800
 to it. But also the fact that you're introvert. So the other side of it, the fame, that's something

51:50.800 --> 51:56.400
 that you also said is a double S sword for you. The interesting thing about fame is that you also

51:56.400 --> 52:03.440
 mentioned, is it something you can't take back? Yeah. So it's a thing you can't just like go on

52:03.440 --> 52:07.360
 vacation in Hawaii and it's like, consider, do I like it or not? No, you're staying in Hawaii for

52:07.360 --> 52:12.800
 the rest of your life. And you've never been there before, whether you like it or not. So

52:14.000 --> 52:20.080
 what's that like, being, you know, loved by millions and millions and millions of people,

52:22.160 --> 52:27.760
 which is perhaps the best kind of fame in terms of if you had to choose the kinds of

52:27.760 --> 52:37.440
 fames there are and still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff. So what, do you feel alone,

52:37.440 --> 52:44.560
 more alone being famous? Is there a loneliness? Yeah, I mean, it's such a funny thing because

52:44.560 --> 52:47.520
 for, okay, if you had asked, if we were having this conversation a couple years ago, I'd be

52:47.520 --> 52:55.760
 incredibly guarded about this because the last thing I want to ever do is sound ungrateful

52:55.760 --> 53:02.560
 or unaware of how much I have. And woe is the famous celebrity with money. Oh, is your life

53:02.560 --> 53:06.720
 hard? Is it really telling me about how hard it is? But I'm also at a place in life now where I

53:06.720 --> 53:10.320
 just like, I'm not always just speak my truth because that's the only reason I'm here is I'm

53:10.320 --> 53:14.240
 here to speak my truth to you. So I'm going to tell you my truth, whether it's whatever it is.

53:14.240 --> 53:21.120
 But you're human and feelings are real. And so that's the interesting thing, you win a lottery.

53:21.120 --> 53:24.880
 What's that going to feel like? It's not about complaining, oh, it's so hard to win a lottery

53:24.880 --> 53:29.440
 because you get a lot of money. No, it's still, you're human. You get to experience these feelings

53:29.440 --> 53:34.400
 and it's fascinating. You put humans in different situations. Right. And it's also fascinating

53:34.400 --> 53:39.200
 because a lot of people think, well, I would like to be famous. That's a big thing now on social

53:39.200 --> 53:43.840
 media and Instagram. So the world wants to be famous or rich or famous. And then it's very

53:43.840 --> 53:49.600
 interesting to think, all right, well, once you arrive, are all the problems solved?

53:49.600 --> 53:53.520
 No, yeah. So I will tell you, according to me, what the pitfalls are,

53:53.520 --> 53:58.240
 whether it's pure or not. And there are certainly some pitfalls. Once you're there, you can't go

53:58.240 --> 54:05.680
 back. Whatever. Maybe that's fine because maybe you love it. But the real pitfall for me is that

54:08.000 --> 54:14.160
 you're now, you're Lex and you're what everybody's perception is that Lex is. And that's what you are.

54:15.200 --> 54:21.920
 Now, Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated and has a lot more to Lex

54:21.920 --> 54:31.760
 than the Lex that is the celebrity. So, but anybody who meets you, that's who you are to them.

54:32.640 --> 54:37.600
 And you may, you may not feel this way, but you may feel confined to actually have to be that person

54:37.600 --> 54:43.360
 to that person. Like I've, early in my career, for a long time, anytime I met someone, I suddenly

54:43.360 --> 54:48.240
 felt like I had to be Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons anytime I met someone, including my family

54:48.240 --> 54:52.080
 now who are also like, whoa, this is crazy. You're like, Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.

54:52.720 --> 54:58.480
 And I wanted to just be the goofball that I've been my whole life with my brothers and family,

54:58.480 --> 55:03.600
 but suddenly I found myself feeling like, no, I have to be this, like, because that's who,

55:03.600 --> 55:08.000
 that's who this is. So you're almost like playing a role. And it's like, I've heard a lot of actors

55:08.000 --> 55:11.120
 talk about this, well, they'll take on a role and then it's like, they feel like they have to,

55:11.120 --> 55:16.640
 they like become that. And it's a really scary thing. Like you alter who you are almost

55:16.640 --> 55:23.120
 to fit the notion of other people, because especially if a lot of artists are empaths,

55:24.400 --> 55:29.360
 it, you know, a lot of people get into art in a deep way or empaths. And so you feel a lot of

55:29.360 --> 55:34.160
 what people are feeling. And you're never wanting to burden people. And you're always wanting to

55:34.160 --> 55:39.520
 deliver to that person, you know, what they want is like, people pleasing is very, it goes hand

55:39.520 --> 55:44.800
 in hand with a lot of like, these famous people and they get to where they were because they know

55:44.800 --> 55:48.880
 how to do that. They know how to be in a room with someone and look them in the eye and make them

55:48.880 --> 55:52.800
 feel like they're the only person in the room. And then now they got that role in that movie,

55:52.800 --> 55:58.080
 because they sat with the casting director and they were like, oh, so funny. Oh, has anybody

55:58.080 --> 56:03.280
 to like put on the charisma, do it all. And it's like, anyway, I'm like, I'm going on a different

56:03.280 --> 56:08.560
 tangent here. But long story short, there's a lot of things that are really unhealthy about it.

56:08.560 --> 56:13.520
 And then a lot of people who want the fame, then the second it starts to go away, then they're like,

56:13.520 --> 56:18.160
 who am I anymore? Like, that was everything. And now I'm like on the down. And now I'm not a

56:18.160 --> 56:22.400
 famous person anymore. And now I hate myself. Now I'm going to do drugs. And it's like,

56:22.400 --> 56:26.640
 it's like this vicious cycle, like you could never be famous enough. You're always going to get

56:26.640 --> 56:33.360
 like, there's just so much to it that I've just and I and again, like, I've lost friends in this

56:33.360 --> 56:40.960
 career to do that, for sure. And there's a certain element to sort of just on the losing fame. I've

56:40.960 --> 56:49.600
 interacted with a lot of folks, especially young folks like on YouTube. So fame is a thing that

56:49.600 --> 56:54.160
 has levels. You're always trying to be a little more famous. A lot of folks were chasing fame.

56:54.160 --> 56:57.680
 It doesn't matter how famous you are, you're always trying to chase more. And when you start to lose

56:57.680 --> 57:03.040
 it, interesting things can happen if you're not self aware, which is like, like you mentioned,

57:03.920 --> 57:10.720
 you might be trying to grasp back at where you were by leaning into the formula that got you

57:10.720 --> 57:17.840
 there. And so the constraints of the image that you mentioned becomes the thing that you're now

57:17.840 --> 57:22.480
 trying to lean into, like, and that that's actually walking away from who you really are,

57:22.480 --> 57:27.440
 like you lean further into being that person, that's true for acting, that's true for

57:28.640 --> 57:33.520
 even on like YouTube, which is people acting, they have a role that got them to the table

57:33.520 --> 57:42.480
 somehow. Yeah, it's, it's dark. But I think those are, that's just put for everybody to see.

57:43.680 --> 57:49.200
 But that's a very human struggle, even when you're not famous, finding yourself or being yourself

57:49.200 --> 57:56.080
 of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale, and being trapped by that.

57:56.080 --> 58:00.320
 Yeah. And also feeling like it's never enough. I think that's something all like,

58:00.320 --> 58:05.600
 it's not, it's not just the famous thing, but it's like in the whole, like everybody deals

58:05.600 --> 58:10.080
 with feeling like, when I'm here, I'll be happy. Yeah. When I get that job, I'll be happy. When

58:10.080 --> 58:15.520
 I have that money, then I'll be happy. When my, when I get that surgery and my nose looks like

58:15.520 --> 58:25.360
 this, I will be happy then. It's like a constant chase of happiness instead of happiness. It's

58:25.360 --> 58:30.880
 like the opposite. It's opposite of self love. It's the opposite of happiness. There's no

58:30.880 --> 58:35.760
 presence to it. You're constant. You're never going to find it. You're never going to arrive

58:35.760 --> 58:38.880
 and you're just going to live your life and then you're going to be on your death bed and be like,

58:38.880 --> 58:45.840
 I was chasing the wrong thing my whole life. I should say that podcasts are interesting in

58:45.840 --> 58:51.440
 that way. So for me personally, because you just talk a lot, you can't, people that meet you,

58:51.440 --> 58:57.600
 they know you and they know the evolution of you. And that's the same thing for like you right now,

58:58.560 --> 59:04.400
 Dan of Imagine Dragons, just being on a podcast, like long form reveals the side

59:05.840 --> 59:12.880
 that liberates you more to be yourself. People see it, oh, there's a human. Because they,

59:12.880 --> 59:18.560
 you know, music, they have a deep connection with you. They have experiences with you the

59:18.560 --> 59:23.440
 way they experienced it. And that's who you are with them through the songs. But now you get to

59:23.440 --> 59:30.000
 see, oh, that's a human being. He probably gets angry. He gets sad. He's excited. He's hopeful.

59:30.800 --> 59:35.520
 And there's a core, there's a good human being with the whole roller coaster of emotions all

59:35.520 --> 59:40.240
 there. It's a giant, beautiful mess. And podcasts reveal it. That's why I love podcasts, like long

59:40.240 --> 59:47.600
 form. You get to hear some artists and actors and so on. And some of them you get to see, oh, you've

59:47.600 --> 59:56.240
 lost yourself in the, in the surface. That's the tragedy with some actors, some great actors.

59:57.040 --> 1:00:01.680
 They've, they've, they've left so much of themselves in the roles they've played,

1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:08.880
 that they can no longer be the thing they were before those great roles. That's for sure.

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.680
 That's, it's hard. It's hard to see. So you get to see that with Johnny Depp with, I don't know,

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:18.720
 Pirates. He was talking about that with Pirates of the Caribbean. That was a shift. Right. Like,

1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:26.320
 he's not that guy. Right. He's forever, forever, forever that guy. But the point is to remember

1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:30.480
 that you're not into your family, which is interesting. You said with your family, when I

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:36.800
 see people close to me, they also, there is an element like that while you're that they start

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:42.720
 treating you like the famous person. Yeah. You know, I, I'm fortunate to have my manager,

1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:50.640
 who's my brother, my older brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother. And that's been helpful

1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:56.160
 because like, it's weird. It gets weird with everyone, no matter what. One of the best advice

1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:01.440
 I was given was by Charlie Sheen. You got advice from Charlie Sheen. Yeah. We were playing

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:08.560
 The Wise Sage of Our Generation. The Wise Sage. It was. It was really wise. I was sitting next

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:13.600
 to him and we were, we were playing some late night television and he said, this was right at

1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:20.240
 the beginning. And he just said, boys, just mark my words. Your life is about to get really weird.

1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:23.360
 That's all I said. But it stuck with me forever. And it's Charlie Sheen. So of course it sticks

1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:28.160
 with you. And I remember being like, right. Okay, Charlie Sheen. I'm not Charlie Sheen. It's not

1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:35.360
 going to get weird like, you know, but it got really, really weird, really quick because suddenly

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:40.880
 you've existed your whole life in this way where everybody just, everything you get,

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:47.920
 you achieved, it was because you got it. And every conversation you had, like, if someone liked you

1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:51.840
 at the end of that conversation, it was because they liked you. If they didn't like you, it's

1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:56.000
 because they didn't like you. And you can make complete peace with that. At least I could my

1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:02.320
 whole life. I was like, life is a challenge. And be myself. And I'm going to go through it and

1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:08.240
 find some people along the way that I connect with and others know. And that social integrity

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:15.360
 is so important to us. And we think it would be nice to have this. And this is going back to the

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:19.920
 pitfalls of it. We think it would be nice to walk into a room and have everyone be like,

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.640
 and you could be like, dumpster fire. And everybody's like, Oh my gosh, dumpster fire.

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:32.640
 That was amazing. How you said dumpster fire was amazing. It's like, it's incredibly,

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:39.600
 incredibly lonely. And it just breaks everything that you knew about humaneness. And it sucks.

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:45.280
 So then you're seeking out people who that it doesn't exist with and families the closest you

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:47.840
 can get to that for sure. But even your families, it's going to take a little bit where they're

1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:51.760
 like, Oh, this is a little weird, like all my friends at work are now asking about you. And

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:55.360
 you're my young stupid brother. But now you're suddenly like the young stupid brother they want

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:59.680
 an autograph from and stuff. And it still makes like they have to get over that and figure that

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:06.320
 out. And then you meet people too who know about this whole concept. And they're like,

1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:12.080
 well, I'm going to be an asshole to him to show him that I don't subscribe. And you're dealing

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:17.440
 with like people who are like dumpster fire and the person who's like, you know, you could say

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:21.440
 something actually profound and nice. And they'd be like, that's stupid and you're an idiot.

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:27.680
 Because it's like an actual attempt to like show you how much they don't care. So you live in

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:33.360
 this very like this still nevertheless, even when nobody knew you, you were seeking for deep

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.280
 human connection with a small number of people. And now when a lot of people know you, you're

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:44.640
 still looking for deep connection with a small number of people, the struggle is the same.

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:50.480
 Can you can you speak to because you mentioned some of the dark moments. What advice did you

1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:55.360
 give to people who are struggling with depression? And maybe for the people who love

1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:03.120
 the people who are struggling with depression. So what I have found to be most successful for me,

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:12.080
 it's it's back to the basics of everything that the therapist or psychologist will tell you,

1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:17.040
 psychiatrist will tell you right when you meet them, which is exercise every day,

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:25.200
 eat healthy, for sure, find time, make time every day to do something that you love,

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:32.480
 whatever that may be, whatever brings you joy. And you might, and when you're really depressed,

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:35.600
 that actually feels like nothing. Because the things that brought you joy,

1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:43.360
 don't bring you joy anymore, when I'm really in the thick of it. But for me, like this is the

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:47.600
 cycle that I'll go through is I'll look at my life and I'll say, okay, what, what, what can

1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:52.800
 I clean up? All right, well, for me, it was cutting out alcohol actually helped me a lot.

1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:59.920
 I know that sounds like big, I'm not like, I'm not judging anybody for that. And I still,

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:04.560
 you know, drink on occasion, but I have felt like alcohol has been very unhelpful to my mental

1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:10.480
 state. Feel less drive and less happiness the next day for things that I want to do. I feel

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:15.840
 like it plays a lot with your serotonin. So look for stuff to change. Clean living, yeah.

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:22.560
 Clean living, but also understanding that, that sometimes it's just, it just is. And you just

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:29.440
 keep breathing. And, and it will get better with time. This too shall pass. And I really think

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:34.080
 that in the winter, you know, I'm pretty sure, I mean, I've had a lot of, I've seen a lot of

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:37.680
 therapists and all of them say the same thing, which is like, you have major depressive disorder,

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:41.920
 and this is what it is, but it's certainly worse for me in the winter months. So I know there's

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:46.960
 like, I can't think of the term for it, but there's a term for like seasonal depression,

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:52.160
 there it is. So I'll get to the winter and suddenly I'm like, geez, everything really

1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:58.080
 sucks on a deeper level. And then, you know, so it's like this too shall pass is another thing.

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:03.280
 It's like, just practice those things, absolutely see a therapist. That's my biggest,

1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:08.160
 like my biggest emphasis of life is to like on stage, like my goal, like I have a few things

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:13.520
 that I really, really care about. One is, is mental health, health and de stigmatizing therapy.

1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:17.280
 Because for me, I didn't go to therapy for a long time because I felt that it would be admitting

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:23.280
 that I was broken. It'd be admitting that I was weaker than Lex, who doesn't have to go to a

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:28.640
 therapist because Lex is stronger. So be strong like Lex. You know, I would like look at all my

1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:32.160
 older brothers and I looked up to them so much. And they were all these incredibly successful

1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:38.560
 people. Plastic surgeon, anesthesiologist, a dentist, two attorneys, Stanford, NYU, like just

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:45.840
 like incredible high standards, Eagle scouts, you know, like they, Val Victorians, like they just

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:54.560
 did it all. So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit and none of them went to therapy.

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:59.120
 So it was like, what are you going to be? Are you, are you broken? Are you like the weak one who

1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:05.200
 can't hack life? And I think that's incredibly dangerous. And I feel like it almost cost me my

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:11.120
 life because I took so long to finally go to therapy. So I really want kids to know, hey,

1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:16.080
 like the great people that achieve great things that are doing amazing things,

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:18.560
 they probably have help, almost all of them.

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:24.160
 It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym. What, so I, unfortunately, I want to be

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:29.440
 a psychiatrist when I was growing up. Maybe, maybe that's why I like podcasts. Maybe that's,

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:33.600
 I think you'd be a good one. Maybe I would, I would, I think you are a psychiatrist.

1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:39.760
 Pretty much. Sounds like you're a psychiatrist. I think I need more. I think, I think actually,

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:45.440
 to be a psychiatrist, you'd also need to be seeking therapy from like, you also need to be,

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:52.960
 have some stuff to work through in your mind. I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark

1:07:52.960 --> 1:08:00.480
 places. Empathize. The, the empathy, the ability to empathize, and especially if you've directly

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:05.920
 experienced that you can, you can go to those places in your mind. Like you said, it's with

1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:12.560
 music to be authentic. You have to really go there. What, why did therapy help so much?

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:19.040
 What is the process of therapy? If you can just educate a little more, is it, are you basically

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:27.680
 bringing to the surface and talking through things that you, because of the, the momentum of life,

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:33.520
 you just never allow yourself to speak through, to think through? Is that what therapy is?

1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:39.280
 Or is there some more systematic thing? So I've been to a lot of strange different kinds of

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:44.640
 therapy. So I'll tell you my first therapist. If I could interrupt, how hard is it to find

1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:51.120
 a therapist that connected with you? It is, it's actually pretty hard, I think. I think,

1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:55.360
 I think it for, well, actually, I have a skewed view of that because

1:08:56.880 --> 1:09:02.880
 going back to the beginning of my therapy was with a Mormon therapist. So it was very much like,

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:07.680
 well, are you reading your book of Mormon? And are you praying at night? You know what I mean?

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:13.120
 Like that was a big focus of my therapy to begin with. And you're having a faith crisis in the

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:20.000
 distance somewhere. Yes. Well, and then. You're making it worse. Yes. The next therapist I went to

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:28.400
 was a Scientology therapist. I met my wife and she was Scientologist at the time and she's not

1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:35.280
 anymore. She's like, it's such a funny thing to like, to look back on because we met. And I was

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:38.960
 like this Mormon missionary who had just got home from his mission and I met her and I was,

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:43.680
 she's Scientologist. I was like, wow, that's bad shit crazy. Like, and like that stuff's crazy.

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:48.560
 And she's like, what are you talking about? That's your crazy Mormon. That's bad shit crazy.

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:54.240
 And the two of us were like, huh, maybe there's something to this to both of us here. Yeah,

1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:59.440
 the tension actually forces you to think through like, well, what is true? Yeah. And we really

1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:05.840
 fell in love through that, which was like, maybe we're both on the wrong track. Let's figure this

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:14.080
 out. But before that happened, we went to a Scientologist therapist who that therapy consisted

1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:19.920
 of what have you done wrong to Asia? And they asked, they would ask me that question over and over

1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:24.160
 and over and over and tell them like thinking of the deepest, darkest things that were in the

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:29.840
 recesses of my mind. This was a therapy. This was marriage therapy. Anyway, I'm not gonna get into

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:36.160
 that, but it was Scientology therapy. So that was a different thing. And then I went to therapy

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:40.160
 therapy, like, no, it's not attached to any religion. And that was a really great experience

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.720
 for me. And since then, I've been through a couple different therapists, but that was more because

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:50.000
 where I was and moving and things like that. So is it that hard to find a great therapist?

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.400
 Probably not. But maybe don't go to your Mormon therapist person, Scientology therapist.

1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:58.960
 Or maybe that's, maybe that's the route for you. Maybe it's the route for you. I don't know.

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:02.400
 Yeah. But what is, so is it bringing stuff to the surface, basically?

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:04.320
 Oh, yeah. So I didn't even answer your question.

1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:09.440
 What's the effect? Why is it so effective? Just, is there something you could put words to?

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.600
 Yeah. I mean, I think it's obviously there's the common things you would think of, which is like,

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:17.120
 oh, I've been holding these things in and I don't want to tell anybody and then I tell this person

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:21.760
 and oh, there's relief in that. But that's really not where the real work comes from. I think the

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:29.520
 real work is meeting with someone who is well versed and educated and understands. It's like,

1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:33.680
 it's like coding. It really is. It's like someone who like, they listen to you and they're like,

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:37.120
 well, that was a trigger. And then this became this trigger. And you're probably every time

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:42.000
 you're hearing that thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life. And they just will

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.440
 walk you through scenarios and maybe some of them aren't right. But some of them you'll be like,

1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:51.120
 it'll resonate. Sometimes you're like, wow, I am feeling that because of that. And that did happen.

1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:54.880
 And maybe if I call my mom and say this to her, it will make me feel better. Hey, mom,

1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:59.600
 this happened. It's like work. You put in work and you have hard conversations and do difficult

1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:05.600
 things. And so if your therapy is not difficult, I actually think that's not good therapy. Good

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:12.800
 therapy is it's going to be a little difficult. It's work. During and after. Yes. I had this

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:17.440
 incredible therapist who was who I told him when I was going to do ayahuasca. He was like,

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:21.440
 Jesus, you know, he had actually was a doctor before and a really well educated,

1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:28.080
 studied person who had walked away from brain doctor. What's the word for that? Brain doctor.

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:33.280
 Brain surgeon. Neurologist. Neurologist. And he said, well,

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:39.760
 basically his belief was that ayahuasca was like basically doing therapy like 50 sessions. He was

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.560
 like, it's like really intensive. He was like, I don't know if you want to do that. If you do,

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:50.160
 you can make some big steps forward. But I prefer just to do one session at a time.

1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:57.280
 And so yeah, it's hard work. And I typically like, it's really hard for me to talk about

1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:00.800
 ayahuasca by the way, going back to that because I'm not looking to tell everybody to go do

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:07.280
 ayahuasca. It's incredibly hard. It was the scariest experience of my entire life. It felt

1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:11.920
 like I went to heaven, but it also felt like I went to the darkest, deepest hell that was

1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:17.520
 incredibly scary. Incredibly scary. Yeah.

1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:26.400
 He told the story of how you wrote the song, Believer, or like your childhood friend,

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:33.920
 I guess, Donald, like bullying and that kind of stuff. This song, a lot of your songs are

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:40.320
 super interesting. There's a percussion super interesting, super interesting lyrically,

1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:47.520
 just how it flows. And also pain is at the center of it. I mean, a lot of, like you said,

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:53.040
 the crisis of faith, some of these existential questions are basically behind a lot of your

1:13:53.040 --> 1:14:00.880
 songs, funny enough. Maybe they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see, but it's there.

1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:11.440
 And this song is really interesting in that way that it puts pain, you made me a believer.

1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:20.160
 You break me down, you build me up, believer. That's so interesting. Maybe can you tell the

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:24.080
 story of how the song came to be? I'd love to listen to it too. I have some questions

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:31.040
 musically about it too. Yeah. I mean, it's exactly what we're talking about with therapy. I just

1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:43.040
 feel like the greatest things in my life have come from the deepest hurt. Losing someone

1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:50.240
 that you love is maybe the hardest part of the human path for me, at least thus far.

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:54.080
 Like when I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing? There's like, you know,

1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:58.400
 there's like, you think of physical pain or maybe like going through financial pain or whatever.

1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:05.120
 I think losing someone that you really love to death is one of the hardest. For me,

1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:11.040
 I would say it was the hardest. But it also makes you look at your life completely differently

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:15.200
 and alter your life, at least for me, in ways that were really healthy.

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:21.360
 Being more present, letting go of things that were meaningless, trying to control what other

1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:26.480
 people think about you, like wasting your time on things like that. And you suddenly see like,

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:31.280
 wow, like time, I got a small amount of time, like, how do I want to spend it? I'm going to

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:37.680
 spend it in the best way I know how. And that's it. So yeah, I mean, that's, it's a basic concept

1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:41.920
 that's been said a million times over in a million different ways. But that's pretty much what I was

1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:46.720
 trying to say with believer, which is like, I've lost faith in faith and everything at that time

1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:53.200
 period. And, you know, or previous to that time period. And then I was rebuilding my faith or

1:15:53.920 --> 1:16:02.240
 my spiritual thought process. And it was after I was skin, it was like, you know, finding being a

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:08.720
 believer. And that, and that's not necessarily like a believer in God or a believer in heaven and

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:16.640
 hell or anything like that, but a believer in more believing in goodness, believing in that there is

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:23.600
 some light, like, and again, those words, like, they're just words. And I wish there were better

1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:29.520
 words to formulate the thought that I'm trying to express, but just more, like the thought of

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:41.760
 me dying for me, I don't fear it. I don't fear it. But actually, I really fear not seeing my

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:48.000
 kids again. I'll say that that is fearful for me. I feel like I love so deeply these children that

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:54.720
 the thought of like, leaving them for me is a scary thought or something.

1:16:54.720 --> 1:17:03.040
 They're kind of good reminder how much you love life, actually. Yeah. And you don't always remember

1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:08.800
 that. Yeah. And I think having kids is not for everyone for absolutely for sure. But for me,

1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:14.240
 and especially you shouldn't be having kids to give yourself a reason to live. I mean, like,

1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:19.040
 I feel like dying. I'm going to have a kid. You might feel more like dying after having a kid,

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:25.200
 actually. You know, it's pretty stressful. But it is a place to like, I've changed a lot of people

1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:33.280
 that I've known that it gave them a new intensity of gratitude for life, for sure. God, do you mind

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:38.000
 if we, I'll return to the pain of the believer, you mind if we listen to a little bit of the songs?

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:46.720
 Okay. Did you write the music first or the words first?

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:50.640
 It's same time, which is very typical for me.

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:58.160
 By the way, just the way it opens, the intensity of openings. You ever think about like, what the

1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:04.160
 first few seconds sound like? Is that something that like, when you imagine a song, is it the

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:11.520
 opening you imagine? No, it's kind of a, it's just a, I never think opening. I never think

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.840
 final. I think soundscape of how I'm feeling right now. So it could be the middle of the song for

1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:23.760
 all I know when I'm, you know, when I'm doing that. But my process for me is very much lyrics

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:29.920
 and melody and music really come at the same time. Like I, by the same time, I mean, I'm,

1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:35.360
 I'm, I'm a, as I'm expressing maybe, you know, I'm feeling like

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:46.480
 like it's not that simple, but it's like, I'll, I'll hear it. Like it's like,

1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:50.640
 here's all the orchestra and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once. And melody in

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:55.840
 my voice is just one of those instruments. You know what I mean? It's just utilizing one instrument.

1:18:55.840 --> 1:19:00.480
 So you've seen the landscape. And that landscape includes melody, includes percussion, lyrics a

1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:05.600
 little bit or lyrics. I will be words to begin with, like a word here and there. Like I'll be like

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:16.080
 you know, I'm like, what's a word that I'm thinking of when I'm feeling this soundscape? And I always

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:23.520
 create with no theme in mind. I'm never, for better or for worse, just my process is I'm sitting down

1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:28.000
 and I'm writing a journal entry. Simple as that. It's like, when you sit down and write a journal

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:32.480
 entry, are you sitting down and you're like, Kev, I've had all these words here that I'm going

1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:36.960
 to put on the page and I'm going to order it in this way. And my theme for my journal entry today

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:40.640
 is going to be this, maybe some people do, but I don't, my journal entry is, I don't know what I'm

1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:45.280
 going to say. Oh, how was today? Well, man, today was this and feeling this. And now that I think

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:49.280
 about that, I'm really angry about that. That hurt my feelings when this, you know, you're like,

1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:53.840
 you're like, you're formulating it as you go. And that's the joy of it. And for me, that's what

1:19:53.840 --> 1:20:00.320
 music is. So I'll sit down, not thinking, Hey, I've been wanting to write a song that has a hard beat,

1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:03.680
 or I've been wanting to write a song that's anthemic, or I've been wanting to write a song that's,

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:09.040
 it's like, how am I feeling right now? And is joyful with the, is the feeling joyful to you?

1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:17.840
 Or is it struggle? You just made it sound like it's, I think, or at least fulfilling. Yeah,

1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:22.480
 fulfilling is what I was kind of looking for. But there was a lot of artists talk about really

1:20:23.520 --> 1:20:29.680
 talk about writers, cathartic. That's what I was like. It feels like having a good moment with a

1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:36.480
 therapist where you're like, okay, I'm expressing this thing that I just need to express for whatever

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:41.440
 reason, I need to express this. The majority of the songs I write for the record are never heard.

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:49.280
 I write over 100 songs a year, I release 20 songs every three years. So I don't know what's that

1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:57.840
 percent 20 out of 300. Come on, Lex. It's less than 10% less than 10% 8, 7 or something. Yeah.

1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:04.640
 Anyway, so it's and then like getting together with the band and like getting them selected down

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:12.800
 is really what the process is. So you're really writing a song per one to three days, kind of

1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:19.280
 maybe a song that you can't quite figure out the puzzle of that's going to last a little longer.

1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:24.960
 Where's this struggle? Every idea. Yeah. You finish every idea. I do. I finish every idea.

1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:30.160
 So it's not just like laying completely unfinished. I could open my computer for you right now and I

1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:35.600
 would show you hundreds and hundreds of songs that you would listen to and think that sounds

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:40.080
 like a song. It's like there's rhythm, there's melody, there's multiple instruments, there's lyrics.

1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:47.920
 It's the same thing is for coding for me, which is music, which is I can't walk away until I've

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:53.280
 completed it. But it's finished. Well, finished is it? Yeah, but it sounds like a song. I certainly

1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:58.640
 do a lot more with it after with the band where we pulled all apart, but it's a song. It'll be like,

1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:05.600
 you'll listen to it and say, okay, that was a song. You understand what it is for sure.

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:12.400
 Do you think this is a painful question from a fan perspective? Do you think there's genius

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:20.720
 on your computer that you walked away from that you just didn't notice it? Do you think there's

1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:26.720
 truly great songs that you've written that you just didn't notice how great they are?

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:34.640
 I think greatness is something that I feel I'm, I don't feel like I've achieved greatness,

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:37.760
 genuine. I'm not saying that to you in a way of like humility.

1:22:39.760 --> 1:22:47.520
 No, genuinely, I feel like I am on a journey right now to find who I am. And I'm 34 and it's like,

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:52.000
 I don't even, I haven't begun that journey. I feel like I'm just starting that.

1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:01.200
 But that being said, I certainly don't know the right answer to what songs are,

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:06.880
 beloved or good to the masses. Imagine Dragons is such a massive entity. It's like,

1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:12.080
 there have been, I will say this, there are a couple of times where I fought really hard

1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:17.360
 to decide on the single, really hard. Or I always fight for what goes on the record,

1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:20.720
 always. I always put the record together and that's the record that I wanted to be

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.960
 and me and the guys come up with that. And it's nobody else has influence, no manager, no label.

1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:30.480
 The single, everybody wants to have a say in your label wants to have a say in it,

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:35.360
 your manager wants to have a say in it. And I have fought really hard over that. And I've

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:40.560
 been wrong before and I've been right before. But as far as songs that I haven't put out,

1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:47.040
 I mean, you can imagine so many songs, you think, you think of so many Beatles songs

1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:52.960
 that are like some of their grace while my guitar gently weeps. Let me, I'm trying to imagine

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:58.640
 weird sounding, not that interesting, possibly songs. The majority of what we put them,

1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:04.000
 honestly, they may, it may be our best stuff is that we don't put out, for instance, because our

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:11.440
 band is such a, it's such a complex question. I really don't know, actually, I don't know,

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:15.280
 maybe one day I'll die and people will look and be like, I hated Imagine Dragons, but now,

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:18.160
 listen, that's not, I really liked that, which they would put that out. Or maybe they'll be like,

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:19.840
 oh, it's all sounds like shit. I don't really know.

1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:26.000
 Sorry, it is a tragic thing. That's why I asked it, which is like,

1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:35.200
 there could be some great, incredible things that will take you a long time to rediscover,

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:41.760
 to realize how great they are. And it's also the tragic aspect of being an artist is you don't know,

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:46.160
 if you get fame or all that kind of stuff, you don't know what's going to really move people,

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:51.600
 because ultimately what you want is to, to connect with people and you don't know what that's going

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:57.760
 to be. It's hard. I mean, to me, it's, to me, it's tragic, just as a fan of yours to see,

1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:03.040
 maybe I wonder if there's like, incredible stuff there, just as it is tragic to see great artists

1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:08.240
 throughout history who didn't get recognition until they died. It's like, because they basically

1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:16.160
 held on, you know, France, Kafka was extremely self critical. A lot of these folks had an idea

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:23.200
 of what's good and not, and they were wrong. They had genius. They weren't entirely wrong,

1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:26.560
 because they became sufficiently popular, but it's interesting.

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:30.720
 I try to genuinely to release the songs that move me the most.

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:31.840
 Got it. I'll say that.

1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:33.760
 You're your own audience.

1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:42.480
 Yeah. I try to put out the songs that make me feel the most. I feel that. That's my only gauge,

1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:48.240
 because it's so subjective of like, what is good? What's this? Nobody knows the song that the masses

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:52.400
 are going to like. Nobody knows that formula. Nobody knows it. So for me, it's always what makes

1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:55.680
 me feel something. One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me when we worked with him on this

1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:02.720
 record was he would say, his main point that he would continually bring up went like,

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:06.880
 because he's not the type of person to be like, that's a bad song or that's good. It's just not

1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:12.960
 who Rick Rubin is. It's more like, there's more nuance to it. He would say, I don't really believe

1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:18.560
 you on that song. That's what he would say. He would say, and I knew that was like,

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:24.160
 that song's a no go. He would say, and I would genuinely, there was a time he said it, and it

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:31.360
 was about a song that I really felt it and meant it when I said it, but he didn't believe it when

1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:36.240
 he heard it. And I was like, man, well, at the end of the day, I can believe it all I want,

1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:40.240
 but if the listener doesn't feel the honesty in it, just like we were talking about earlier,

1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.840
 I think the most important ingredient is this truth, perceived as truth to someone else. And

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:49.600
 if it's not, the bullshit indicator goes, and you're like, I don't care. I don't throw it away.

1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:56.240
 I don't care about it. Well, you said that he made you go through line by line, the lyrics.

1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:02.720
 Every song. That was excruciating for me. Why was that excruciating? Well, first of all,

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:07.680
 it's Rick Rubin. So you're in the room with like Rick Rubin, who's done a lot of the greatest

1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:14.160
 of all time. And so I had to first just put that aside and be like, okay, well,

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.800
 you've done a lot of my favorite records, but still you're human and not everything you say

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:23.840
 is going to be right. And I'm a strongly opinionated person, and so is Rick. And so when the two of

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:30.000
 us were sitting down in a room together, it was, you know. But the lyrics, which is interesting.

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:34.720
 So not the entire composition, but just like, let's look at the lyrics. What do I mean here?

1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:41.520
 Yeah. Oh, yeah. Cause he would look over every, there was like, and there was, there were battles

1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:46.160
 he won battles that, that, that he didn't win. And maybe he was right. I don't know. I mean,

1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:49.600
 there was, for instance, I'll give you an example. There was a song on the record called number one.

1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:55.840
 Okay. Rick will probably laugh when he hears this. Cause this was a big one that we kept going back

1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:00.960
 and forth on, but this will give you a good insight of what it's, what it was like, what it was like.

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:05.600
 And there's a line in it that says, um, I don't know. The chorus is, I don't know what I'm meant

1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:12.080
 to be. I don't need no one to believe when it's all been said and done. I'm still my number one.

1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:18.960
 And he was like, nah, just makes me cringe when I hear that. He's like, I just like, do you have

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:22.640
 to be like, can it not be like, you're still my number one? And I was like, no, it's not about

1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:27.520
 anybody else. Like, you know, it's about like self love. He's like, yeah, but like, do you need to

1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:32.080
 like talk about self love like that? And I was like, well, I feel like I need to. It's like, well,

1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:36.480
 but you know, there's something else we could say there. Like we just kept, you know, we kept coming

1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:41.920
 back to this song. Okay. And I was like, I, and I changed it. I tried changing it. What did I

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:45.760
 change it to? It was like, it wasn't you're still my number one. Cause it just made no sense. It wasn't

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:51.680
 about some love thing or like someone else. I changed it to something else. And it just,

1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:57.440
 it was the one thing that I was like, I'm really sorry, Rick. Like I get it. And if it sounds

1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:01.440
 cringey to you, it's definitely sounding cringey to other people too. And that sucks. But I don't

1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:06.320
 know how else to say this in a way that I want to put that song out anymore. But there were other

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:12.320
 songs for sure where Rick was like, that or this, that word feels a little trite. You already said

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:16.560
 that one. Can you say it in a different way? That was really helpful. And then, yeah,

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:23.040
 it's really interesting. Cause you're trying to say something so simply and yet not make it cringe.

1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:28.320
 And that's really hard. That's, that's like a, that's a strange art form because you want to

1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:33.840
 say some of the greatest love songs. We, we looked at the, the without you song. I mean, that's,

1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:40.480
 the whole thing is cringey. If you just read it on paper, like it's like, like it's a court report

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:46.640
 or something, but yet it's not, especially one song, maybe, but no, there's something about,

1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:53.440
 yeah, maybe. Song in a way you believe it. When you believe it, but also written in a way that's

1:29:54.160 --> 1:30:01.120
 singable in the way you believe it. So it's like, it rolls off. It just comes out in a way that just

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:11.920
 feels like silky and no word catches your mind is cringy. Yes. But then music, I think great

1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:19.760
 speeches are like that too, or just, you know, conveying, communicating ideas simply. That's the,

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:25.840
 that's the art form is to not be cringy. So interesting. And then yet, cause like when you're

1:30:25.840 --> 1:30:35.920
 raw and real, it might have first feel cringy. So the battle there, and that, that's where

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:43.200
 you see people fail. Like just regular artists, like, I don't know, open, at open mic, I got

1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:48.080
 open mic. So I just listen to musicians, like when they write songs, like they, they fail that test.

1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:53.120
 They write simple stuff, but it's cringey. Why? I wonder what was that? Like, what is that?

1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:56.160
 I'm telling you, Lex, I tried to explain this to my brother the other day.

1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:02.960
 Cause it's the same thing with a live performance. If I'm not in my right headspace and I walk on

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:09.360
 stage and I walk up and let's say, I say something and I do this. Yeah. Cause I'm like, this is the

1:31:09.360 --> 1:31:14.240
 move, right? I'm like, this is the move. The crowd doesn't care. In fact, the crowd is like,

1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:20.480
 that's cringey when you did this. But if I wasn't thinking about doing this and I went up there

1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:25.280
 and I said something and I really meant it in my body was like, I can't explain this to you.

1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:33.760
 It's so silly to say out loud, but it's, people will resonate to it when it's real. And when it's

1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:38.560
 acted, it doesn't, you could do it the exact, the motion could look the same. Your eyes look the

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:43.760
 same, but there's something about the energy that people know. They know if it's real or not.

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:46.640
 Yeah. People, like you said, incredible bullshit detections.

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:52.000
 100%. I'll go on a stage and if I'm not in the right headspace to be real, it won't be a good

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:56.240
 show. If I'm real, then it's a good show. It's as simple as that. Let's go through the song.

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:04.640
 Like I said, great opener. So you had this in your mind, this landscape? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:12.560
 Yeah. The beat was first on this.

1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:18.880
 What about the first and the second and like first things first? The first line I wrote was

1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:24.800
 first things first. I don't know why it just was like, and then I was like, oh, that principle of,

1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:32.560
 you know. Great line. Don't second things second. Don't you tell me what you think that I could be?

1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:37.280
 I'm the one at the sale. I'm the master of my seat. I'm the master of my seat.

1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:44.320
 My dad had that in his office. He had this saying that was something about the sailor

1:32:44.320 --> 1:32:49.360
 and being the master of his seat that I always loved. There you go. Simple statement.

1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:57.280
 Zero cringing. It's so powerful. It's so simple. I'm the master of my seat. This whole song is

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:06.880
 just trivial, but in terms of lyrically, but extremely powerful and original, unique sounding,

1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:10.800
 something about the words. Just even, you don't have to actually sing them. You just read them,

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:17.200
 and then raw. I was broken from a young age, took myself into the masses, writing my poems for the

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:22.400
 few that look at me, took to me, shaking me, feeling me singing from the heartache, from the

1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:29.760
 pain, taking my message from the thing. I can't. Why am I reciting your words to you? The percussionist

1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:35.760
 throughout it. That was there in the beginning. The percussionist is almost in the lyrics.

1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:42.560
 Yeah. I'm a very percussive singer because I was a drummer first. I think same with Dave Grohl,

1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:50.000
 probably a similar thing, which is I think in percussive sense a lot when I'm writing. I also

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:55.600
 was before I could play an instrument, I would beatbox. I think Michael Jackson did this too,

1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:01.920
 actually. I've heard in the studio that he was very similar, but a lot of what I do is percussive

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:06.080
 because my brain thinks in it, percussively first.

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:08.640
 A little more because it's so good.

1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:09.520
 It's almost like a drum. Like,

1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:15.680
 and then you lay words on that.

1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:19.280
 Yeah. Yeah, this

1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:25.840
 is building. It's almost like drums.

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:36.000
 It's all building to the chorus.

1:34:42.880 --> 1:34:46.240
 What about the word pain? When did that come to you?

1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:51.280
 Pain. You made me a believer.

1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:59.920
 Yeah, just the idea of... I really, one of the things that a lot of the songs that I like,

1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:06.880
 I like divisiveness. For instance, not always, but there's times where I want someone to hear

1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:10.560
 a song and I want them to either love it or hate it. I really don't want them to be in the middle

1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:23.200
 ground. A lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs. For instance, with pain, I want you to

1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:30.080
 hear that. It's something either somebody's going to hear and they'll be like, man, I just

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:33.920
 don't want to hear that like that. Or it's like, oh, I felt that so deeply when he said that in

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:37.840
 that way because it sounded like this. When you think of the word pain, it's like,

1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:46.960
 that's a... At least for me, when I hear that word, it carries a lot of weight.

1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:51.600
 It carries a lot of weight. I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight and to come into that chorus

1:35:51.600 --> 1:36:02.480
 with like, it's a striking moment. I'm also a baritone singing as a tenor. That's where that

1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:08.160
 natural roughness comes from as I'm singing out of my range really, up in my head voice,

1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:11.040
 and it carries a lot of weight with it because of the baritone.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:19.200
 Can I ask you a specific pause before the pain? It's really interesting because it's like a double...

1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:29.920
 What is that? How much work does that take to get that right? That's incredible because it's

1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:36.400
 like a... So you're seeing the beauty through the... And then whatever that sound is the...

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:43.440
 Right, the bass being rolled off. Yeah, I actually, when I first was approaching the chorus, it was

1:36:43.440 --> 1:37:00.240
 actually... Like it came in on one. I'm not singing it right right now, but it did not wait. And it

1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:07.600
 felt like it didn't hit in the way that it was supposed to hit because you predict that. You're

1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:18.640
 waiting to... Right, it was like... So I wanted to feel a little more striking. Again, it's like

1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:23.200
 that thing that makes you kind of do this a little bit. You're like, huh? But once you hear it a few

1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:27.760
 times, you're like, ah, ah. And you predict... You know what I mean? It's like, I'd rather someone

1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:33.200
 hear our song the first time and be confused by it so they play it the second time. And then

1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:40.080
 they're like, oh, okay. You know what I mean? I really don't want... I'd rather turn some

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.320
 people off along the way and then the people who come along for you are going to feel more

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:51.200
 committed, I think. It's just an interesting... It feels gutsy to insert silence.

1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:56.880
 Yeah, that's what makes it... It's like the greatest speakers of all time are like,

1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:06.000
 and I told you... Right. You would know. You're like, oh, yeah. What is that? Yeah,

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:15.440
 that's so interesting to do that just at the right time. And then pain, right? Man, it's a brilliant

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:20.480
 song. Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it? Out of the thousands of songs you've

1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:26.400
 written? You know, it's always the same thing for me, which is all... If I want to listen to the

1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:32.480
 song and I want to listen to it a lot of times, then those are the songs we put out. And I only

1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:37.040
 want to listen to the songs that make me feel something. Whether or not it's... Our single

1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:42.720
 that did the very worst of all our singles was the song that I wanted to listen to the least,

1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:48.240
 but it made the most sense as a single, which was all the wrong reason to choose it. I bet my life

1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:52.480
 is the single off our second album. And that song was originally written. It was just a guitar

1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.800
 and a vocal. And it was very just quiet and laid back. And we were like, well, let's try to dial it

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.760
 up. Let's try to produce it. And we overproduced that song. We self produced it as a band and we

1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:11.520
 overproduced. And that song... I mean, it did good in terms of a song, but for us it did not do good

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:17.040
 compared to our other songs. And I really looked back at that and learned a lesson from that.

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:22.400
 It's like, if I don't want to listen to the song, that's a sign already. If you don't want to listen

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:30.240
 to your own song, it's probably not a good song. Yeah. You said your dad, also wearing today,

1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:38.640
 just said that your dad early on was a kind of the early Rick Rubin. Yeah. So when you were

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:46.160
 starting out, he gave you feedback. He listened. What did you learn about music, about life from

1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:58.880
 your dad? My dad is a really quiet farm, grew up on a farm, very humble. I think he starts every

1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:05.120
 sentence by saying, this is just my two cents, pretty much. He's like, take it or leave it.

1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:08.880
 Like, you know what I mean? He's that kind of a sense, like there's humility in everything.

1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:13.760
 And it's real for him. It's not like false humility. I really feel like when he's saying

1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:18.480
 things, he really is like, maybe this isn't any worth to you, son. And he means it.

1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:21.360
 But here it is. And it's always gold. And I'm like, wow, dad, that's incredible.

1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:26.320
 So what in those early days of you, like, so you were like 12 or something like that,

1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:30.560
 like starting to write songs? I was 12. I wasn't showing my music to anyone. I started writing

1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:34.320
 right when I was 12. And I probably wrote for at least, let's say six months or something.

1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:38.400
 And I had written probably, I don't know, like a lot of songs during that.

1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:40.240
 What was the topic, by the way? Love, anger?

1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:43.680
 It was all sad. No, it was the first song I ever wrote when

1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:56.000
 and it was like a bluesy thing. It was like, there was my voice to that. And then it was like,

1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:07.600
 all by himself, no other one around. And he stood all alone. When would he be found?

1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:19.440
 Did he want company? Or was he found on his own? Everyone needs a friend. So why was he all alone?

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:28.320
 You know what it is? But I was like a 12 year old with, I just felt like depressed for the first

1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:33.040
 time. And I just was like so... I think he discovered the blues as a 12 year old.

1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:36.800
 Yeah, right. It really was. It was like my sense of the blues at that time, for sure.

1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:40.800
 Like bad version of the blues, but it was like 12 year old kid with a bunch of acne.

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:46.560
 I hated going to school. I felt like that I just had not found myself.

1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:49.920
 Sounds like a great song, by the way. I wanted to keep listening. I forgot I was...

1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.120
 Yeah, I don't know about that. But yeah.

1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:58.560
 What was your dad? At which point did you begin to share it with your dad?

1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:02.080
 A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning were very much like Bobby McFerrin like that,

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:06.400
 because Mike was in a part of the house where I couldn't bring over the piano

1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:10.960
 and the only instrument I played at the time was the piano. So I would do everything with my voice.

1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.120
 But then I started teaching myself the guitar in that beginning like six month period,

1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.240
 just watching my brothers play in their garage bands in the basement.

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:22.160
 And then I started to write songs a little more like Enya vibes, like stack my voice like 20,

1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:28.800
 30 times. And like Enya meets like Jarre, which is who my dad would listen to a lot, John Michael

1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:36.640
 Jarre, this is incredible synth genius. But anyway, so I finally got my like gall up enough to show

1:42:36.640 --> 1:42:40.880
 it to my dad one day after work. And I got very little at my dad because there were nine kids

1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:46.240
 and he worked from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m. We'll come home very tired and here's nine kids that are like,

1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:50.320
 dad, you know, and you're the young one, you're not... You're just gonna miss... I was in the middle

1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:54.560
 kind of too, so it's even, you know, middle child thing. But I sat him down and I was like,

1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:59.200
 hey dad, I just want to like kind of show you a song. And he was like, oh, you know, he didn't

1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:03.760
 know I was writing anything and I showed it to him and he listened and he took it off and he

1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:08.800
 really looked at me. It was like, that was really good. He was like, I thought, and this, when you

1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:14.160
 said this, it made me feel this, he was like, and that did it. I probably would have given up music.

1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:19.680
 Like I look back, that was a very pivotal moment for me. I was like in a place where I was like,

1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:24.640
 is this good or bad? I don't know. Maybe it's so embarrassing and terrible. And I was already writing

1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:29.200
 lyrics that were a little like overly metaphorical to hide that I was dealing with faith crisis because

1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:33.360
 I thought, okay, I'm gonna show this to dad. I don't want my dad to know I'm like questioning the

1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:39.360
 truthfulness of Joseph Smith. So I'm not gonna be like, is Joseph Smith a real prophet? Is Mormonism

1:43:39.360 --> 1:43:43.360
 true? I don't really know. Like, you know what I mean? I was like writing way overly metaphorical,

1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:48.560
 but because my dad really validated it and he was a no bullshit person. So I knew when my dad

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:52.400
 said that, I was like, you know what, at least my dad really actually thinks this is cool.

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:57.120
 And I really trusted my dad's taste and thought everything he listened to was cool. So I was

1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:01.200
 like, wow, I'm gonna keep doing this. And I just showed it to my dad for years and years. And still

1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:06.320
 to this day, I sent every song to my dad. So he underneath it with the feedback is always like,

1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:09.040
 ooh, I like this idea. I like this. It's just a positive, like a...

1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:13.600
 Not always positive, no. But like underneath it, do you sense the positivity? Because I think that's...

1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:21.280
 Always. Never mean, never malicious. You know, there's like, there's two types of criticism.

1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:25.040
 There's like criticism that's just like, you're looking to be hurtful to someone. And then there's

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:30.000
 criticism that's like, really important for art. It's the type of criticism that's like,

1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:35.520
 you see the value in what's happening. And if it's honest, then you maybe communicate with that

1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:40.640
 person like, I see what you're trying to do with that. It's not even like you have to say that

1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:46.320
 or whatever, like butter it up. But it's like, my dad would just give me this honest criticism

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:52.560
 that would be like, you know, it certainly wasn't always good, but I knew it was always

1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:54.960
 well intentioned. I guess that's how I would say.

1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:58.880
 So you mentioned, made me re listen to... I'm a big fan of Cass Stevens. You made me

1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:05.360
 re listen to father and son. I probably all sons have issues to work through with their fathers.

1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:11.760
 That's just, and you said that you connect with this song in particular. I think, so you're a

1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:18.560
 father now. What is it about the song that connects with you for people? Let me play it. Let me play

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:23.120
 a little bit. People should educate themselves on Cass Stevens. Oh my gosh. Right on the peace

1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:28.800
 train. The best, the best piece. Right on the peace train. You think this is a hopeful, a sad song?

1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:34.480
 I hear it as hopeful. I hear it as a loving father saying just what his son needs to hear.

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:44.880
 It's not time to make a change. Just relax. Take it easy. You're still young. That's your fault.

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:54.800
 There's so much you have. It's like that calm wisdom. Yeah. There's time. It's wise. If you want, you

1:45:54.800 --> 1:46:02.400
 can marry and look at me. I am old, but I'm happy. And just the way he says that, like, that should

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:08.800
 be a corny line, but it's not corny at all. It's like, yeah. Look at me. I'm old, but I'm happy.

1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:22.800
 Yeah. I mean, the simplicity there. Yeah, but it's such a contrast with, what's his name?

1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:34.640
 I'm Harry Chapman with the Cats in the Cradle, which is like the sadness of... This feels like

1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:44.640
 there's a wise, calm connection between father and son, right? With Cats in the Cradle. I don't know

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:51.520
 if you remember that song. He learned to walk while I was away and he was talking before I knew

1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:55.840
 it. And as he grew, he'd say, I'm going to be like you, dad. You know, I'm going to be like you.

1:46:55.840 --> 1:47:02.800
 And the idea of that song is that he does become like his dad. It's just funny, you know, something

1:47:02.800 --> 1:47:09.840
 you've said. But in a different way, you become too busy to make that connection. His dad was too

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:15.840
 busy to make it connect to his son in a, not a dramatic way, in a very kind of calm, natural

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:21.520
 way. Like you don't, you just don't have time. You're busy at work, you're providing for the

1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:26.400
 family and so on. There's connection, but you don't really get the form that depth of connection.

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:31.680
 And then the father, when the son shows up from college and all that kind of stuff,

1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:37.040
 he doesn't spend any time with the father or that. And there's just the calm sadness of that.

1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:41.360
 We live, we can live parallel lives and never quite connect.

1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:45.440
 And there is a little bit of that in father and son with Cat Stevens too, you know,

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:50.320
 like when the, when the son is saying, um, from the moment that I could talk, I was ordered to

1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:56.880
 listen. I always, I always remember listening to that line, feeling like that really moved me.

1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:01.920
 But the beauty of that song is it shows, it's kind of like the theme of what I feel like we've

1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:05.600
 talked about since the second you got here, which is something I really like, I don't know why it's

1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:11.600
 such an important theme in my life right now, but the duality of just understanding that you

1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:17.200
 don't understand someone else's situation. And there's truth to both sides. Like there's truth

1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:21.280
 to what the father is saying to the son. He's like saying these things and he's like, I'm looking out

1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:26.080
 for you. I love you. Take your time with these things. If you want to get married, you can like

1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:31.360
 these things that we have. And then the son saying, listen, like, I want to pave my own path. I want

1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:36.880
 to do this. Like, why are you telling me this? Like the son's not wrong. Cause there's a lot of parents

1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:43.840
 who tell their kids what to do and they're wrong. And they don't let the kid form the path that

1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:48.640
 they need to. But should you not be a parent? Like, you know what I mean? There's just two sides

1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:57.120
 to everything. There's a thing, it is annoying when you're older, you get to see people do all

1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:06.720
 the same things. You could say, well, this is a phase and you'll see that this actually will

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:11.200
 end up in this way. You can like predict how the life unfolds. And it's very annoying for young

1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:15.200
 people to hear, especially because it's probably going to be true. It's like, no, it's not going to

1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:19.520
 be like this. No, it's going to be different. But then you become that person. But that doesn't mean

1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:26.160
 they also let them live that life, let them make the mistakes. But they're not mistakes actually.

1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:36.240
 They're like beautiful deviations from the path that they end up on. And those make the path.

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:44.080
 Do you have advice for young folks today? You've had like an incredible

1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:53.280
 dark journey and a successful one, a loving one. And one of the most successful

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:58.640
 artists in the world. Is there advice you can give to young people today that would like to find

1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:03.200
 themselves to that way, especially if they're struggling? I thought you said device at first.

1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:10.000
 And I was like, honestly, I feel like that device is not helping. Maybe everybody should get away,

1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:20.160
 throw away their devices. Advice. I would just say like what I emphasize to my kids is

1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:27.440
 I really, really want my kids to just learn to love themselves. It's easier said than done.

1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:34.080
 It's really easy to pick on yourself in life. It's really easy to look in the mirror and wish

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:41.120
 you looked different, wish you were more successful like that person over there, wish that, you know,

1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:50.320
 wish a lot of things. And people that I see that really succeed at life

1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:55.920
 really succeed truly. And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily or they're

1:50:55.920 --> 1:51:01.040
 succeeding and, you know, they're talking to a lot of people like their success to me is like

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:07.520
 happy and real. They have real self love. You meet, you know, when you meet someone,

1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:12.560
 you meet Rick, for instance, you meet Rick Ruhman. Rick has a calmness about him. And it's funny

1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:22.880
 because everybody sees him as this like Zen master like Rick is just a really loving person who also

1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:27.200
 loves himself and have self confidence because you just see it and it resonates and that's why

1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:31.520
 he draws people and that's why he's so great in the studio because you know his intentions always

1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:35.680
 as an artist when a producer comes in, you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are your intentions?

1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:38.560
 What are you trying to do? Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label? Or you're

1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:42.080
 trying to make me something? Are you trying to like make me this so you can prove this about

1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:46.400
 yourself? Like there's a lot in that dynamic. And the reason that Rick is so good is because

1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:52.320
 you know his intentions and his intentions come because Rick has that self love. So for me,

1:51:54.320 --> 1:52:00.880
 find the things about yourself because they're there that you love and really focus in on them.

1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:05.680
 And it's not selfish. Like I feel like I was brought up in a family too where it was like

1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:13.600
 never look inward, like be selfless, like serve, serve, serve, which by the way is a true principle

1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:18.400
 of life. I think you love yourself more when you serve more. I think that's really evident in life.

1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:23.920
 But also spend time doing the things that make you happy. Take time every day to go on that

1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:28.720
 walk that you need to go on, listen to that book tape that you need to listen to. Like for me,

1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:32.800
 that's something I need. I know if I do that, I'm going to be a better dad because I did,

1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:40.080
 I did, I gave myself some, some love back in life. And I just forgive yourself. I think

1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:44.400
 forgive yourself because everybody messes up. Everybody hurts others. Everybody says unkind

1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:51.360
 words at times. Everybody, everybody fails all the time. And if you think that you're going to not,

1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:55.680
 you're wrong and you're eventually going to, and you're either going to punish yourself for it

1:52:55.680 --> 1:53:00.240
 every day and be a lesser version of what you could be, where you're going to forgive yourself

1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:04.240
 for it. And if you learned that that's not something you want, then try not to do it again.

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:08.400
 If you do it again, and you're probably going to do it again, whatever that is, you're going to gossip

1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.360
 about that person. You're going to feel bad because then you gossiped about someone.

1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:17.280
 Is this something you could say in terms of self love? Is there a role for being critical on

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:21.920
 just like that, those demons of like self criticism? Do you need a little bit of that? Tom

1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:26.320
 Waits talks about, I like my Tom with a little drop of poison. Do you need a little poison?

1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:30.960
 Or is it, is that silly or a mental situation poison?

1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:36.160
 Look, it's my biggest thing in life that has been like the thing that I've worked on the

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:46.560
 hardest for the last few years is to not be overly critical and to let go of control. I think

1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:55.760
 it's really easy to kill an artist. It's really easy to kill an artist. Like if my dad would

1:53:55.760 --> 1:54:00.240
 have sat down with me that day, and even if he would have just sat down and been like,

1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:05.920
 good job son, okay. It's not silly, right? Like I didn't, not everybody has a dad who's going to

1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:13.280
 ever do something or put in the time or whatever, but that would, that might have altered everything

1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:18.480
 for me. Like my dad taking the extra time to be, to just give me a thoughtful response,

1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:22.240
 opposed to kids know, kids know when you're, when you're just like trying to get out of the room

1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:26.080
 or whatever. I knew he wasn't and that did a lot. So yeah.

1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:32.720
 But is that, is that a huge, isn't that what makes the artist? Is the fragility of it that,

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:35.680
 like, would you have it any other way?

1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:46.560
 No, no, I agree with you. I think that that's what, that, that's the beauty of art. But I think

1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:55.520
 also on the same token, it's like, I went to, I went to music cares recently, which is a charity

1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:00.160
 for musicians that are down on their luck, that maybe we're successful at one point or I've never

1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:04.960
 been successful and they can't build and pay the bills and this charity contributes money to these

1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:09.680
 artists, aspiring artists or artists who've had drug issues and like there's a lot that they do,

1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:14.320
 but, and there was a statistic that they told it was staggering to me, which is I think it was 75%

1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:22.240
 of artists, musicians say they struggle with severe depression. That's really high. I don't

1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:27.280
 know what the national average is, but I would guess that that's higher than national average

1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:35.920
 per occupation. So I just think there's a tricky balance, there's a tricky balance in, in art.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:44.400
 So yeah, of course, like, it's, it's a necessary thing, the fragility of it all. But um,

1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:51.600
 yeah, I wonder, because I'm extremely self critical. And I sometimes ask myself the question,

1:55:51.600 --> 1:56:00.000
 I've romanticized it, or rather, I've learned to be, for it to be productive to channel it

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:06.720
 into productivity. But I wonder if there's better ways to do that. And I also wonder if it's

1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:11.840
 eventually the thing that destroys me, like if long term, if it's a healthy thing, it might be

1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:21.840
 useful when you're in sort of actively fighting the battles of the day, the, for me, it's engineering

1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:28.240
 challenges and all that kind of stuff. But then when you're sitting back and enjoying life with

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:34.320
 family and so on, is that going to be like, do you need to find that self love, like ability to

1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:41.360
 kind of silence the voice of criticism in your head? You know what, I really, there's a good,

1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:48.720
 you're making a good point. And I think that the middle ground is you need,

1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:59.520
 you need self doubt to push you to be better. I do believe that like, for instance, if I,

1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:04.240
 if I believed, I've hit my, like, when you're like, these are a song on there that you think is

1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:09.760
 genius. If I, if I think I've written a genius song ever, I think I'd probably stop. I think I'd

1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:22.000
 be like, you know what, did it? I wrote, what's that perfect song? Imagine. Imagine, yeah.

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:28.320
 Okay. If I'd written imagine, I'd probably be like, that's it, did it. All right. Perfect song has

1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:34.640
 been written. That's the best thing I'll ever do. So the fact that, that there is like,

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:42.000
 self criticism and criticism outside, I think is necessary. 100% for sure. It pushes you,

1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:49.120
 it pushes you, it pushes you. It's just finding the right middle ground for that young aspiring

1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:55.120
 artist to also not feel squashed and to be heard and to love, just to, not even to feel squashed,

1:57:55.120 --> 1:58:00.880
 just to love themself. So that when they're in the room playing the song, they'll believe it,

1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:05.600
 because they believe themself. They love themself enough that they believe it and then they'll do

1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:08.800
 a great, and then the song will come out great and they'll do a great performance.

1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:17.200
 I have to ask, it's one of the very interesting aspects of your life of the way you put love

1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:22.160
 out there in the world. What is at the core of your support for the LGBT community?

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:30.240
 A couple of things. So one, growing up in, from a young age in the artist community,

1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:35.760
 a lot of my closest friends were LGBTQ, starting in middle school.

1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:44.480
 And I think a lot of the best artists in the world are LGBTQ and that's just, it's not a secret.

1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:52.800
 Like the artist community is filled with lots of LGBTQ people. So I think being raised in that

1:58:52.800 --> 1:59:02.560
 community in that my friends struggled with their faith and their sexuality really opened up my eyes

1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:10.080
 to how incredibly hard that path is. For instance, okay, when I was in high school,

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:18.240
 there was someone who went in front of who was LGBTQ and was Mormon and felt like there was not a

1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:24.080
 place for them in the church. They felt like the path, you know, when you're being told that it's

1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:29.680
 evil and you believe it because you believe in your faith and you feel like it's unchangeable,

1:59:30.480 --> 1:59:36.160
 you're putting a kid in a situation where there's really no good resolution. It's either be alone

1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:41.840
 for the rest of your life or marry outside your sexual preference, which I don't want to marry

1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:47.600
 a man. Like if I was forced to marry a man, I'm like, I don't want to marry a man because I'm

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:53.840
 heterosexual. So you're forcing a kid into a situation where it's very dangerous.

1:59:53.840 --> 1:59:57.200
 Long story short, this kid went in front of the Las Vegas Mormon temple and shot himself,

1:59:58.080 --> 2:00:05.360
 killed himself. That impacted our community. And not just that, but it was like

2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:10.560
 severe bullying to LGBTQ kids. In the 90s, it was especially different. Like,

2:00:11.200 --> 2:00:14.960
 there's still bullying, don't be wrong, but man, like bullying in school, I don't really know

2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:18.800
 actually what it's like in schools now. Maybe the bullying is just as bad as it was in the 90s, but

2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:27.760
 there was like, it was like, I would hear all the time, like the F slur being slung out at people

2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:40.560
 who were LGBTQ all the time. And I wasn't even LGBTQ. So just seeing that, I think that every

2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:51.120
 any social justice issue takes all sides. It takes all pieces of the puzzle. If only the

2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:55.520
 pieces of the puzzle contributed are from the side that is affected, I don't believe that

2:00:55.520 --> 2:01:01.680
 we'll ever have a resolution. We're doing a shit job, and we need to do better. And that's just,

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:08.320
 that's the reality of it. So that's part of the reason I also have family who's LGBTQ,

2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:14.480
 and it's just something that's been part of my path. And I feel like I'm a big believer and

2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:18.800
 take the path that is presented to you. And this was just something that came up in my life a lot.

2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:23.440
 When I met my wife, she was living with her two best friends who are LGBTQ, who really didn't

2:01:23.440 --> 2:01:28.000
 want her to marry me because I was Mormon. And at the time it was Prop 8, which was Mormons were

2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:36.000
 fighting against LGBT gay marriage. And so that then they didn't come to our wedding and that

2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:42.400
 really broke my wife's heart. So it was just like, because Mormonism represented everything that was

2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:49.680
 against their community. So you felt you had to say something? Yeah, I felt like by not saying

2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:56.320
 anything, I was saying everything. I felt like by not speaking up and being like, hey, Dan Reynolds

2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:01.520
 is Mormon singer. Here's this new band, Magic Dragons, and they're Mormons. It was like,

2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:06.320
 okay, well, what do Mormons represent? They represent Prop 8. What does Prop 8 represent?

2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:11.920
 Bigotry towards the LGBTQ community. So what do I do? Okay, I can speak in every interview and be

2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:18.000
 like, well, that's not me. I don't believe that too. Or I could just be more active about it. And

2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.520
 especially when it was affecting my family and friends throughout my entire life, it was like,

2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:26.720
 all right, this seems like a path that you need to go down. So long story short,

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:30.560
 it was a path that just presented itself through things in my life.

2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:36.080
 So just on that topic, religion and God give a lot of meaning to a lot of people. It gives

2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:45.760
 tradition that brings people together across the generations, but it also can hurt people.

2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:54.400
 What do you make about that tension? So a source of meaning, but also a source of pain for people?

2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:01.600
 The reality is, at least to me, again, this is just my reality. I feel like I'm doing my dad's

2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:05.600
 thing every time I'm talking to him. I'm like, I don't really know. Here's my two cents.

2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:06.960
 You have become your father. Yeah.

2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:13.120
 Yeah. The reality, and it's my reality, and it is the reality for sure.

2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:23.440
 There's, I think that religion has brought a lot of hurt and pain to a lot of people.

2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:28.720
 Absolutely, it has. I don't think anybody can dispute that on either side.

2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:38.000
 Whether it's war, whether it's slaughtering of entire peoples,

2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:42.240
 there's been a lot of pain and suffering that has come from religion.

2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:48.400
 So my little thing that has been hard for me is a faith crisis. I had religion,

2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:52.560
 and then I lost it, and then I had nothing. So that's, for me, I was like, well, religion

2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:59.200
 did that to me. But then at one point, it's kind of like, how much of my life am I just

2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:05.760
 going to complain about being raised Mormon or being depressed? As I get older, I'm like, okay,

2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:12.640
 so what? Okay, it's really hurt me, but were there any good things that came out of Mormonism?

2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:15.920
 Well, yeah, there's a lot of good things that have come to my family through Mormonism.

2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:21.440
 Closeness were really, really close. Mormon culture is that you live together forever.

2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:25.760
 The teaching is that your families are forever. We die and then we go to heaven together and

2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:29.840
 we're together forever. My family really believes that principle, all of them do.

2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:37.840
 And that instills a certain way of living that's kind of beautiful, even if it's naivety.

2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:42.560
 There's something kind of beautiful about believing that we're forming these bonds

2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.200
 together as a family and that we're going to be together forever. It brings a lot of comfort to

2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:52.160
 a kid too. When I was little, I was like, wow, it's going to be okay if I die because I get to

2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:57.200
 see my mom again. You know what I mean? I really believe that. Is the right answer that you tell

2:04:57.200 --> 2:05:03.760
 that kid? Actually, when you die, you're not going to see your mom again. Maybe it might be. I don't

2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:09.680
 know. And anybody who has a kid is going to face that moment. I've already faced it where you sit

2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:14.960
 down and my kid was like, hey, dad, when you die, am I going to see you again? That was actually a

2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:21.040
 really hard moment for me because I was suddenly faced with, okay, do I give the answer that I

2:05:21.040 --> 2:05:26.160
 thought was bullshit? Or do I give the answer of what I think it is? Or do I give the real answer

2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:32.880
 which is, I don't know. And that's what I chose, which is a father that's not always the easiest

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:36.560
 answer because your kid, it's a wonderful thing that you feel like you can give your kid the

2:05:36.560 --> 2:05:41.040
 comfort of like, hey, your parents are going to take care of everything. We know everything.

2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:44.960
 We've been around. My kid's always like, are you the strongest? I'm like, yeah, I am the strongest.

2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:51.680
 Stronger than everybody. Yeah. Yeah. So when you're faced with that moment, it's like,

2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:56.560
 it kind of sucks to tell your kid like, you know what? I don't know if you're going to see me after

2:05:56.560 --> 2:06:02.800
 I die. But I hope. That's what I said. I was like, I don't know, but I hope. I really hope

2:06:02.800 --> 2:06:07.760
 because that would be awesome if we can hang out forever. And if there's any way for it to happen,

2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:12.400
 I'll make it happen. You know what I mean? That's kind of what my answer was. So long, so short.

2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:18.160
 Sorry. I know that I'm being lengthy on this. Is there like, what is my thought on religion?

2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:24.000
 It just is, it's gonna, it's been here forever. It's coping. It maybe it's, I can't say whether

2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:30.560
 it's true or false. How the hell am I supposed to know? I mean, like, I've lived 34 years on this

2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:35.360
 planet. A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me. And they really believe very

2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:39.040
 deeply. And a lot of them are smarter than me. You know what I mean? Like, I look at my older

2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:45.280
 brothers, for instance, who are very practicing Mormons. These guys are hyper intelligent.

2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:49.920
 My younger sister, hyper intelligent, all of them start smarter than me. They all believe it

2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:54.640
 still. So what am I supposed to say? Well, you're all stupid. You know what I mean? Like, you're

2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:59.120
 all wrong. I don't know. Maybe like, maybe it's the South Park episode where everybody dies. And

2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:06.960
 then they're like, well, the right answer was Mormonism. And I mean, like Mormon Mormons love

2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:11.760
 that moment in South Park. They're like, Hey, that day may come. That day may come.

2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:18.000
 Yeah. So maybe, maybe I don't know is the honest answer for everybody around the table.

2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:25.520
 But the biggest question for which I didn't know is the right answer is, what's the meaning of this

2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:31.680
 whole thing? What's the meaning of life? No, you're not allowed to say I don't know.

2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:37.760
 You can be just like your dad and say, let me just give my two cents.

2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.560
 Whatever it's worth, take it or leave it. It's probably worth nothing,

2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:54.160
 at least, on the ground. I mean, what, why are we here? Is it just busily creating all these kinds

2:07:54.160 --> 2:08:01.120
 of things, worrying about things, having kids? I, my purpose, at least right now,

2:08:01.120 --> 2:08:17.840
 is to wake up and try to bring light love to the world, light love to myself, and have integrity.

2:08:18.640 --> 2:08:29.120
 That's my purpose. The ultimate purpose of life that I guess that's my ultimate purpose of life.

2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:36.320
 I don't know what happens when I die. Ayahuasca gave me some sense that there's more to be known.

2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:40.960
 I'm sure there are other things in life that would give me that, and I'm looking for it.

2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:48.480
 I'm a seeker. I'm always looking for the next something to give me hope in something more,

2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:52.560
 even if so, I could just not bullshit my kids when they ask me that question and be like,

2:08:52.560 --> 2:09:00.560
 you know what? I really don't know. I want to not know more, if that makes sense. I don't want to,

2:09:01.680 --> 2:09:08.000
 I want to see things that make me confused, that make me question what I already knew.

2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:15.840
 When I meet an atheist who comes up to me and they're like, atheism, atheism, atheism.

2:09:16.400 --> 2:09:20.560
 It's just as laughable to me as when I meet the Mormon who comes up and they're like,

2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:26.800
 Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism. I'm like, how do you anyone? How do you guys know?

2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:36.400
 So you feel like you're doing some, through all your travels, through all the people you

2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:41.840
 meet, you feel like you're still keeping your eyes open and your heart open to discover

2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:49.440
 or discover something new, like the ayahuasca experience, that there might be deeper truths

2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:54.080
 out there. Yeah. And I want to find them. And I want to surround myself with people who are

2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:58.800
 just looking for it. I'm not interested in people who are just looking to point fingers at each,

2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:03.920
 like life is so short. I'm looking for, it's one of the reasons that I wanted to meet with you

2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:08.320
 is I was like, wow, Lex really seems like he's on a journey to find truth. And that

2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:12.720
 humility for me is same thing with Rick. It drew me to Rick. It was like, I really,

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:17.440
 I see that and identify with it. And that's what I'm looking for. There's the final song on our

2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:25.040
 record, our new record that's coming out. The chorus goes, and this is like, this is my best

2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:36.240
 answer to what you're asking. The chorus goes, take it easy on me. I need some lullaby. They tell

2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:43.760
 me heaven's just a lie. Well, I'm not surprised. Tell me that you know. No, you don't. Yeah,

2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:52.240
 you're just like me. Can we just all hope for the best? Take it easy. So that's it for me. It's

2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:58.480
 like, I'm going to play something from like, I don't know. Tell me, you know, I'm not going to

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:04.160
 believe you. Maybe you do. I'm not going to believe it, but like, let's just be easier on each other

2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:10.320
 and like, try to find truth wherever it may lie. But above all, know that we don't know jack shit.

2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:15.600
 I think that's a mic drop moment. Dan, thank you so much. You're an incredible human. I love that

2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:21.920
 you share with the world the darkness of your mind, of your life experience and the beautiful

2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:26.560
 light that you've shown to the world. So it's a huge honor and thank you for spending your valuable

2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:31.280
 time. Good luck on the tour. Thanks, man. Thanks for having me. Thanks for listening to this
