00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
 Humans are fascinated by violence and you've got to ask yourself. Why is it the rash guard? Yes

00:07.280 --> 00:12.680
 And I talked so much shit that I'm like, man if I lose this is gonna be rough. You're learning this shut the fuck up

00:12.680 --> 00:16.360
 I got you man. You were powered by McDonald's and Coca Cola

00:16.360 --> 00:19.240
 I want more and then I spack them and he didn't want to fight anymore

00:22.040 --> 00:24.040
 If George St. Pierre and

00:24.040 --> 00:28.200
 Khabib Nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins

00:31.120 --> 00:33.120
 I'm here with three individuals

00:33.320 --> 00:39.840
 Each of whom are considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective disciplines

00:40.200 --> 00:46.720
 The greatest MMA fighter of all time George St. Pierre the greatest martial arts coach of all time

00:47.160 --> 00:49.160
 John Donahue her and

00:49.560 --> 00:51.920
 the greatest submission grappler of all time

00:51.920 --> 00:53.920
 Gordon Ryan

00:54.680 --> 00:59.040
 So let me ask the first question you guys didn't see the question no preparation here

00:59.320 --> 01:03.960
 What is the key to your success each of you one thing or multiple things that come to mind?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.760
 John go first

01:12.360 --> 01:14.360
 Is it the rash guard

01:15.080 --> 01:17.080
 Yes, I

01:17.080 --> 01:21.600
 I like that you choose John right off the bat. He seemed the most nervous

01:25.600 --> 01:27.600
 For for me, it's about

01:29.720 --> 01:36.400
 Finding a way to work in a world where most of the answers are already known

01:37.040 --> 01:44.880
 Okay, and any developed sport by the time you enter that sport most of the basic precepts through the

01:44.880 --> 01:52.080
 The the major techniques that the major mechanical understandings of the sport are long since worked out and so

01:52.800 --> 01:54.800
 In a highly developed world

01:56.760 --> 02:00.760
 The key to success is to be able to identify

02:01.600 --> 02:06.720
 Some area of the industry that you're in which is currently undervalued

02:07.720 --> 02:09.720
 So do what the other people are not doing

02:10.440 --> 02:12.440
 Deeper than that. You're you

02:12.440 --> 02:18.720
 Everyone has a view of okay. These are the the main skills of the industry I work in

02:19.680 --> 02:21.680
 at any given time

02:21.920 --> 02:24.640
 Some set of skills attributes

02:26.480 --> 02:30.920
 Will always be somewhat undervalued they're underappreciated by the people in the game

02:32.440 --> 02:38.440
 You see that at any in any given industry there are always trends which change

02:38.440 --> 02:42.080
 The nature of the industry over time so

02:43.280 --> 02:47.520
 fashion trends in the clothing industry you'll see at any given time there's a

02:49.040 --> 02:54.680
 General wave of fashion which pushes most of the people in the industry in a given direction at a given time

02:55.840 --> 03:03.400
 What makes people stand out is the ability to look at the various possibilities out there and say here is something which is

03:03.400 --> 03:11.360
 Genuinely useful, but which is currently being underused underutilized and I want to bring that back in and

03:12.040 --> 03:14.040
 develop it and

03:14.560 --> 03:17.400
 Because it's an inherently useful product

03:17.920 --> 03:23.520
 It will be very very successful in its initial applications against people who aren't currently using it

03:26.920 --> 03:31.920
 If you can do this in whatever ever industry you're in I believe you'll be highly successful

03:31.920 --> 03:36.080
 So this implies both for actual specific like techniques and

03:37.080 --> 03:41.120
 The also tactics as well in the case of of jiu jitsu

03:41.360 --> 03:48.320
 So for example in my sport leg locks have always been around. Okay, there's there's no shortage of people

03:48.320 --> 03:54.200
 You can look back in history who are applying leg locks. Nonetheless as in across the industry

03:54.680 --> 04:00.520
 Leg locks were undervalued and underappreciated. There was a general sense in which most of the leading figures of the sport

04:00.520 --> 04:06.280
 for most of the history of the sport of jiu jitsu tended to deemphasize leg locks and

04:08.160 --> 04:15.600
 When I looked at them, I said there was immense potential, but it wasn't being realized and needed to be changed

04:16.840 --> 04:23.480
 Since then that has more or less occurred now most people coming into the sport understand that leg locks are an important

04:23.960 --> 04:28.880
 Aspect and they're no longer undervalued if anything has gone too far the other way and now perhaps they're a little overvalued

04:28.880 --> 04:30.880
 and the

04:31.480 --> 04:36.160
 this kind of fashion trend exists in every industry and

04:37.240 --> 04:42.000
 The job of anyone who wants to excel in a given industry is to be able to identify

04:42.000 --> 04:46.240
 Okay, what are the things that are currently out of fashion and undervalued and then

04:47.080 --> 04:51.560
 Look at what is their actual objective value and then work?

04:52.240 --> 04:56.760
 To to to bring them back to the forefront. So John brought up fashion

04:56.760 --> 05:00.080
 George is wearing a really sexy shirt. So

05:01.120 --> 05:03.120
 Assuming that's not the reason is there

05:03.800 --> 05:08.160
 Is there something that comes to mind as the key to the success of your incredible career?

05:08.160 --> 05:14.880
 Well, of course, everybody knows the famous and sort of every athletes are saying oh, it's could be genetic

05:14.880 --> 05:19.080
 I was maybe gifted that certain predisposition. I worked really hard

05:19.720 --> 05:21.720
 but I think

05:21.840 --> 05:23.360
 something that

05:23.360 --> 05:28.400
 People don't talk enough is when everybody sometimes go right. I

05:29.600 --> 05:36.040
 Was never afraid to try to go left and I felt many time trying to do things that were not

05:39.600 --> 05:43.160
 Known to be things that would bring brought me brought me success

05:43.160 --> 05:49.880
 But I tried it, you know, I was very often I was the first of trying new things and I felt many time

05:49.880 --> 05:54.480
 but certain times it gives me a certain advantage and

05:55.640 --> 05:57.320
 for example, I

05:57.320 --> 06:03.880
 Was sometimes fighting guys that had much better wrestling background than than me on paper and

06:04.400 --> 06:09.840
 Nobody before that thought those guys never nobody had there to try to

06:10.600 --> 06:14.280
 Take them down because their wrestling pedigree were so good

06:14.280 --> 06:19.200
 And I didn't have on paper that wrestling pedigree to take these guys down in a fight

06:19.200 --> 06:21.520
 But when everybody

06:23.440 --> 06:28.600
 Tried to go right I was going left. I fought them in a different way and that was

06:29.320 --> 06:33.680
 The blueprint to beat certain some of these guys, you know, I mean, you know what I mean

06:33.680 --> 06:37.600
 So yeah, so we'll actually talk about a few fights where you did just that this is fascinating

06:38.240 --> 06:44.480
 But let's say at the high level. So Gordon again sticking on fashion may compliment your

06:44.480 --> 06:51.320
 Incredible badass hat trying to fit in here. Yeah, we should say we're in Texas now. So he's

06:52.280 --> 06:58.520
 Become a Texan overnight. So what is there something to speak to that you would attribute to as the key to your success?

06:58.560 --> 07:02.720
 Yeah, so first of all, that has to be a rule where you don't ask us all those same questions because

07:03.480 --> 07:05.560
 How am I supposed to compete with the answer John just gave?

07:06.400 --> 07:10.640
 There's nothing I can do that's gonna pop that. Yeah, but I think it's

07:10.640 --> 07:14.120
 There's many things but I think the number one thing is just is John

07:14.760 --> 07:19.640
 When I came in I was a blue belt and I was beating Brown and black belts in competition already

07:20.560 --> 07:23.880
 But he really changed my way of thinking about the sport

07:23.880 --> 07:25.880
 I would just come in and if something wasn't working

07:25.880 --> 07:31.120
 I would just do it harder and faster and more aggressively and that just degenerated me into

07:31.760 --> 07:33.760
 degenerated into me

07:33.840 --> 07:39.120
 spastically knee sliding into crosshashigurami against Eddie Cummings for six months and then just getting heel hooked repeatedly and

07:39.120 --> 07:43.520
 I'm like this is not working and Eddie like when I met him was like a chubby

07:43.880 --> 07:48.840
 Librarian looking guy and I'm like there's I'm like six to like a jacked like 170 and I'm like

07:48.840 --> 07:51.320
 There's no way I'm losing to a guy who looks like this

07:51.320 --> 07:54.520
 But he just kept heel looking me so I would just go harder and harder and it wouldn't work

07:54.520 --> 08:00.120
 And then John's like well if you learned leg locks you might you might have some more success

08:00.120 --> 08:02.680
 and then I was like, yeah, that probably makes sense and

08:03.040 --> 08:07.720
 From then on I kind of just changed the way I thought about the sport instead of doing doing things harder

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
 I would actually try to get better at your jitsu

08:10.040 --> 08:12.540
 Do you remember like a turning point where?

08:13.800 --> 08:19.320
 You became as opposed to being mediocre not just in technique, but an approach to

08:20.680 --> 08:26.800
 To great um, I think it was somewhere around brown belt level when I was training consistently

08:26.800 --> 08:32.800
 Sorry training full time with John when I was purple belt mid level purple belt and towards the end of my brown belt

08:32.800 --> 08:37.160
 Days I was beating up like legitimate like ADCC champions in the gym

08:38.760 --> 08:42.560
 So I think like brown to black belt was a big thing for me

08:42.560 --> 08:47.800
 And then when I won my first EBI and I was I smitted Yuri who won ADCC and I beat Roostum

08:48.040 --> 08:50.320
 So I think that was like my turning point as a competitor

08:50.720 --> 08:54.760
 But I think I started to to reach world level a little bit before that

08:54.760 --> 08:57.120
 I think somewhere around brown belt mid level to late level brown belt

08:57.120 --> 09:03.640
 It was it's some of that mental like it was there a moment when you like after a training session? You realize

09:03.640 --> 09:05.640
 I can actually do this

09:05.680 --> 09:08.000
 Like I could be at the top of the world

09:08.000 --> 09:12.380
 Yeah, the critical moment for me was when I think it was right

09:12.880 --> 09:15.980
 Right when I got my black belt, maybe a few months before I got my black belt

09:16.480 --> 09:20.000
 we had a former ADCC champion come into the gym and

09:20.720 --> 09:24.640
 We did a hard round together and I think I submitted them like four or five times and

09:24.640 --> 09:29.080
 And no one knew who I was I never won anything up until that point and I was like, okay

09:29.080 --> 09:33.400
 Like if this is like one of the best guys in the world and I could submit him multiple times around

09:33.400 --> 09:39.240
 I think that this is like something that I actually could do professionally and make a make a career out of this

09:40.080 --> 09:43.560
 Okay, so the actual performance was the like you don't need to

09:44.040 --> 09:47.920
 Believe before you could perform like a lot of Olympic gold medalists

09:47.920 --> 09:56.520
 They they have to believe before they can perform because like they're getting their ask it for a long long long time

09:56.720 --> 09:57.200
 Yeah

09:57.200 --> 10:02.280
 I think but the best way for me to believe in something is to have repeated success doing it against high level guys

10:02.280 --> 10:05.600
 Like I'm not gonna just believe I can do a double leg if I can't have double leg on anybody

10:06.000 --> 10:10.280
 So for me the the belief came from the repeated success in the gym

10:10.600 --> 10:16.240
 Yeah, but to get to the point where you're submitting somebody like Yuri Samoa is like one of the greatest grapplers ever

10:16.240 --> 10:18.240
 It's like a long journey

10:19.080 --> 10:21.320
 Yeah, but I had the confidence

10:21.320 --> 10:26.000
 I had to believe in myself because of the success that I had in the gym prior to that got it

10:26.000 --> 10:31.880
 So that man even and it's one step at a time first the brown belt is the black belt and it's world class. Okay

10:32.560 --> 10:37.240
 George was there a turning point for you when you you thought like I can actually do this

10:38.000 --> 10:42.200
 Yes, I am I always dreamed to become champion

10:42.200 --> 10:48.720
 But I think the turning point that there was there was two turning point and there were my two losses

10:50.320 --> 10:54.640
 First my losses to Matt use I went into that fight

10:56.240 --> 11:03.600
 Just to not lose I was not fighting to win and it's after the fight when I watched the

11:04.200 --> 11:08.120
 The replay of the fight. I realized I was like I was doing pretty well

11:08.120 --> 11:12.920
 But during the fight in my own mind, I was not seeing it that way

11:12.920 --> 11:20.080
 I thought I was getting dominated by you was like a hundred percent when I watched the replay I

11:20.840 --> 11:27.080
 Was like man, I can I can't beat this guy. I was beating him until I made that stupid mistake

11:27.080 --> 11:30.080
 so I was very frustrating but but I

11:30.080 --> 11:37.800
 I was that's what gave me the mentally the the championship level man mentality

11:37.800 --> 11:44.920
 and then I became a little bit overconfident because I start beating everybody after that and I

11:45.520 --> 11:49.040
 Start to believe the hype of people when they look at me

11:49.040 --> 11:51.040
 They were like, oh, he's the new up incoming

11:51.920 --> 11:57.080
 Superstar and he's gonna be unstoppable and and then when I became champion I I

11:57.080 --> 12:01.560
 I lost to to to Matt to Matt Sarah. So

12:02.400 --> 12:04.200
 before I believe

12:04.200 --> 12:08.160
 my first failure was because I had a lack of confidence and

12:08.960 --> 12:10.640
 and

12:10.640 --> 12:17.160
 My second failure was I was because I was overconfident. So I think it's there's a perfect

12:18.200 --> 12:21.000
 Center of confidence. I mean, I mean, it's good to be confident

12:21.440 --> 12:25.880
 Because John taught me like confidence. It's it's like money in your bank account

12:25.880 --> 12:29.600
 if you you can have all the skills and in the world, right and and and if you're

12:30.040 --> 12:35.360
 If you don't have the confidence, it's like you it's like you can you can be a millionaire

12:35.360 --> 12:36.840
 But you don't have access to your bank account

12:36.840 --> 12:44.000
 So it's that that's a little bit the analogy that John told me so that's how I feel a confidence plays for an athlete

12:44.000 --> 12:48.880
 But to be overconfident, I think it's always good to to be aware to be afraid of

12:48.880 --> 12:56.000
 Of what can happen. So to have a perfect balance of confidence and fear to me

12:56.320 --> 13:01.560
 That's what mentally gave me the edge to become. I believe successful in my sport

13:02.080 --> 13:03.440
 playing off that

13:03.440 --> 13:07.160
 John gave me a speech one time and he was like you have to be able to

13:08.160 --> 13:14.000
 Like flip a switch and turn it off where like a guy like Mayweather or someone who goes out who's super confident and

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
 He plays the character of someone who's like no one can beat me. I'm the best that there ever was and that's it

13:20.440 --> 13:22.240
 But if you look at me actually train very hard

13:22.240 --> 13:26.640
 You can't you can't play the persona of no one can beat me and have it translate into your life

13:26.640 --> 13:29.600
 And you think that you're so good that you don't have to do anything and no one could ever beat you

13:29.600 --> 13:32.680
 You have to be able to play that public persona of no one could beat me

13:32.680 --> 13:35.880
 But then you have to actually do the training to make that happen

13:35.880 --> 13:39.720
 You can't just you can't believe your own hypen say say that, you know, I can just do whatever

13:39.720 --> 13:45.640
 I want no one's ever gonna beat me if the ability to switch between the persona and the actual athlete and that made a big difference for me

13:45.960 --> 13:47.720
 it's tough because

13:47.720 --> 13:54.160
 Like you're you you dominate such a large fraction of the world and in grappling and

13:54.960 --> 13:58.440
 The George to just the perfect dominance after those two

13:59.520 --> 14:01.520
 It's hard for the confidence not to just

14:03.280 --> 14:07.880
 Like how do you avoid the confidence not becoming a thing that weighs you down where you completely

14:07.880 --> 14:09.880
 deludes your mind

14:11.640 --> 14:15.160
 For me, it's just a number one the guys in the gym are so tough

14:15.160 --> 14:21.480
 So the guys in the guys in the gym that I train with are always like nipping at my butt and always giving me new problems to solve

14:21.800 --> 14:27.520
 And for me, it's really just about trying to learn new stuff over time. So that keeps it interesting for me

14:27.520 --> 14:29.520
 And it's not really about

14:29.920 --> 14:33.120
 You know, no one could beat me. I don't have to train or have to do it. I could do whatever I want

14:33.120 --> 14:38.880
 It's more what keeps me in the gym is more about the fact that I'm learning new stuff all the time of working on something new

14:38.880 --> 14:43.680
 And progressing to new levels at all times. It's not I don't just come in and do the same thing over and over again

14:43.680 --> 14:45.560
 And that gets boring

14:45.560 --> 14:49.600
 You just come in and you don't learn anything new and you just do the same stuff for years at a time and

14:49.880 --> 14:50.920
 Okay, this is boring

14:50.920 --> 14:56.240
 But when you have new stuff to work on and new goals short term and long term goals to reach then it makes it interesting

14:56.640 --> 14:57.760
 it's

14:57.760 --> 15:01.080
 For me, it's a little bit like Gordon says is the fear

15:01.080 --> 15:06.400
 Because sometime in the gym even before when I was competing I was I was getting my butt kicked

15:06.840 --> 15:08.920
 But I don't care what happened in the gym

15:08.920 --> 15:11.800
 I mean it hit my ego of course because I'm a proud person

15:11.800 --> 15:15.800
 I'm a competitor even in the gym, but it's not a malicious competition

15:16.440 --> 15:20.600
 Competition in between each other when you fight you have to be malicious you go there to hurt the guy

15:21.200 --> 15:25.560
 but it hit it hit me in terms of my pride when I get

15:26.240 --> 15:28.520
 beat in a gym, of course, but

15:28.520 --> 15:30.520
 that fear

15:31.320 --> 15:32.600
 that I

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
 Don't want it to happen in public

15:34.920 --> 15:41.680
 Especially not during a fight that what keeps helped me keeps the balance between confidence and and and and fear

15:41.680 --> 15:44.040
 You know what I mean? It's kind of weird. It's a mix

15:44.520 --> 15:47.800
 It's a mixture of both that I believe I

15:48.440 --> 15:49.800
 to me

15:49.800 --> 15:51.320
 Help me

15:51.320 --> 15:57.280
 Succeed to have the right mindset to fight and I talk so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this

15:57.280 --> 16:01.480
 This is gonna be rough. So yeah, you put a lot of I mean

16:01.480 --> 16:05.920
 That's that's a hard thing to do when you talk shit when you when you play the heel is

16:06.640 --> 16:11.400
 So actually perform the pressure is I mean you have to be good under pressure

16:11.520 --> 16:18.080
 It's the conno more Gregor thing, you know the reason I actually started talking shit was actually like indirectly because of George

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
 because

16:20.080 --> 16:22.680
 Because I will become the opposite of George

16:22.680 --> 16:28.680
 I won I won my first EBI and I didn't talk shit and everyone was like being like, oh, you know

16:28.680 --> 16:32.040
 You he only beat Yuri because because he was tired or

16:32.960 --> 16:36.880
 You know this or that and if they have to rematch under any other rules that he would have lost

16:37.480 --> 16:39.160
 And I'm like trying to figure out what I'm gonna do

16:39.160 --> 16:45.800
 So I'm strolling through George's feed one day and he posted a clip of him beating someone and I look at the comments that I'm

16:45.960 --> 16:46.840
 With this in mind

16:46.840 --> 16:50.520
 I'm like George is the nicest person of all time and if you look at the comments

16:50.520 --> 16:57.560
 It's like ten thousand comments and like nine thousand and nine hundred are just people calling him like all you do is lay and pray

16:57.560 --> 16:59.160
 You pussy you suck

16:59.160 --> 17:03.440
 You can't finish anybody and I'm just like I'm looking at this and I'm like people are gonna say

17:03.760 --> 17:06.880
 What they're gonna say regardless they're gonna talk shit regardless

17:06.880 --> 17:09.320
 So you may as well just say whatever you want and then just be yourself

17:10.520 --> 17:16.400
 Is there some aspect that's I mentioned kind of a Gregor he he crossed the line with kabeb

17:16.400 --> 17:22.240
 At least in the eyes of kabeb. Is there something you ever regret about crossing the line?

17:22.240 --> 17:26.120
 Or does that you ever feel like there's a line or do you just keep pushing the line?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.160
 I I basically play it per per person

17:30.160 --> 17:36.940
 I just I basically fire back with like one step above what what they do. It's always plus one. Yeah. Yeah, okay

17:38.560 --> 17:41.760
 So I go I usually go hard like they fire a bullet then I drop a duke

17:41.760 --> 17:47.480
 And then and then after that initial shot then we go back and forth and I'll just keep one upping them

17:47.840 --> 17:50.320
 So, you know, there's a lot of people that love you

17:50.760 --> 17:53.800
 But there's also a lot of people that love to hate you. Yeah

17:54.600 --> 17:55.720
 so

17:55.720 --> 17:59.600
 Like what do those people like energize you or do you just?

18:00.520 --> 18:05.360
 Or is it funny to you like what as an athlete as a performer you should not think about them

18:05.360 --> 18:09.040
 It's like a fun thing. It's like it's just like a fun thing that keeps me occupied

18:09.040 --> 18:13.560
 Like because like because most of them that like talk shit, they like just say stuff

18:13.560 --> 18:18.560
 That's factually incorrect. So then I just argue with like actual statistics. Yeah, it's just like

18:19.160 --> 18:23.040
 You suck or you're not gonna beat this person. I'm like I've already submitted that guy

18:23.560 --> 18:28.360
 So it just it riles them up and it's just it's just a fun thing for me to do my my downtime

18:28.400 --> 18:32.800
 Yeah, your responses are usually very factual very scientific. I appreciate

18:32.800 --> 18:39.720
 Like you you actually you start by talking trash, but then you respond with science. Yeah, it's great. Okay. It's good mix

18:39.720 --> 18:41.720
 That's a good mix. I

18:42.520 --> 18:49.240
 Mean on a topic of haters are more specifically sort of doubts within yourself and doubts around you as you're coming up

18:51.200 --> 18:55.160
 Maybe George you can comment. I'm just gonna ignore John completely in this conversation

18:58.040 --> 19:01.440
 I was gonna ask you another question, but let me just ask you on this on this topic

19:01.440 --> 19:08.440
 Other times in your life yet the you were surrounded by people that that doubted you all the time

19:08.440 --> 19:16.640
 And so what is there something you could say as by way of advice how you overcome the doubt either yourself or others around you?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.960
 all the time

19:19.480 --> 19:21.320
 The first time I

19:21.320 --> 19:26.940
 Manifest my desire to become a professional mix martial art athlete. Everybody doubt me

19:26.940 --> 19:33.660
 Just not even I'm not talking about the UFC just to become a professional fighter. Everybody doubt me and I became a

19:34.380 --> 19:41.580
 Became a professional fighter. I had few amateurs fight. I won them all then I fought my first fight in in Montreal

19:41.580 --> 19:43.580
 I won and I became a professional

19:44.220 --> 19:50.000
 Then I I told people that I wanted to fight in UFC everybody doubt me again. So

19:50.420 --> 19:52.420
 It's a normal thing

19:52.420 --> 19:59.340
 So I work my way up beat a few guys then I at the time a Pete Spratt was

19:59.980 --> 20:03.340
 just knocked knocked out Robbie Lawler with leg kick and

20:04.660 --> 20:07.540
 The person who was my agent at the time did a great move

20:08.100 --> 20:12.740
 For me, so he brought Pete Spratt and Montreal to fight me Pete Spratt came to Montreal

20:12.740 --> 20:15.700
 I and I believe he didn't know who I was

20:15.700 --> 20:20.620
 So he thought that he was coming to collect an easy paycheck and I and I end up beating him

20:20.620 --> 20:23.820
 So that gave me the opportunity to fight in UFC

20:24.500 --> 20:31.580
 Then after I was in UFC I wanted to become champion of the world, you know, but Matt Hughes was there and he seems invincible at the time so

20:32.420 --> 20:38.580
 Everybody doubt me again, and I became world champion and after when you when I was world champion. I wanted to be I

20:39.540 --> 20:43.820
 Was competing against other world champion of other weight class

20:44.460 --> 20:48.100
 For the title, you know for the legacy and everything

20:48.100 --> 20:50.860
 So it's not no longer competing against my opponent

20:50.860 --> 20:57.180
 I was you know as a competitor you always you you never wanted to be you never want to be satisfied because when

20:57.540 --> 21:02.700
 Satisfaction is the death, you know when you're satisfied you better retire because it's over

21:02.780 --> 21:09.140
 So always I have to find motivation what you can have more. I want more. Don't be satisfied in life

21:09.380 --> 21:11.380
 So I wanted to be

21:11.380 --> 21:17.340
 Like the best, you know, I was I was competing, you know, like to become the best and and you know

21:17.340 --> 21:25.620
 Of course that people doubt doubt you all the time every time you say something that it's outside of the norm of the normality

21:25.620 --> 21:33.100
 And when I say there there's nothing normal, but I'm talking about when you you manifest your desire to do something that

21:33.940 --> 21:35.940
 takes special

21:35.980 --> 21:40.580
 Attribute to to to succeed or that is something that is hard to do

21:40.580 --> 21:44.980
 It's for sure you're gonna always have people that doubt you it's so strange that people don't

21:44.980 --> 21:50.940
 They don't lean into supporting like people that love you too. Yeah, even people that love me used to doubt me

21:50.940 --> 21:54.540
 and I believe I you need to use that as a

21:56.220 --> 22:04.140
 Positive positive thing as a motivation to prove them wrong. Yeah, so for me that that was a thing when someone doubt me

22:04.300 --> 22:06.300
 Nothing gave me more

22:06.340 --> 22:13.660
 There's more energy because I want to prove him wrong. I want to look at him in the face and say hey, you see I got you man

22:13.660 --> 22:15.020
 I did it

22:15.020 --> 22:19.060
 So John, do you ever use this in one way or the other by saying?

22:19.060 --> 22:24.540
 I don't think you can do this to motivate them to prove you wrong or more general question of

22:25.620 --> 22:31.940
 You know the mental toughness required to achieve or confidence required to achieve greatness

22:31.980 --> 22:34.980
 Like what's your role as a coach when you have these two athletes?

22:35.220 --> 22:40.900
 Which regards your your first question would I ever say to someone you can't do this as a

22:40.900 --> 22:44.020
 As a kind of reverse psychology. I know

22:46.020 --> 22:53.820
 My job is to prepare people first and foremost with their skills and as Gordon pointed out earlier if you're

22:54.580 --> 23:01.220
 In any way a rational human being and you're noticing that you're getting tremendous success

23:01.580 --> 23:05.100
 with a given move in the gym against high level opponents who

23:05.100 --> 23:13.060
 Give a good read on what your actual opponent in a competition is is like you would have to be a moron to

23:13.980 --> 23:19.020
 Not recognize that kind of success and say this is something I should be building into my game

23:19.020 --> 23:23.540
 And you will carry the confidence that you earned in the gym into the arena

23:24.700 --> 23:28.740
 So I never try to use reverse psychology. I build it

23:28.740 --> 23:33.540
 Everything I do in terms of confidence is to give people physical skills

23:33.540 --> 23:37.060
 I know people say all this physicality on the one hand

23:37.060 --> 23:42.420
 There's mentality on the other and confidence is squarely in the the mental aspect of the game

23:42.740 --> 23:48.060
 But all the underpinnings and beginnings of confidence are physical

23:49.260 --> 23:56.700
 Okay, a rational human being will see where they're having success and where they're having failure and confidence will

23:56.700 --> 24:03.980
 Surround those areas where they're having success and will degenerate in cases where they're having failure

24:04.260 --> 24:12.780
 So my job as a coach is to set them up for success in the gym with a given set of skills and I don't have to do anything

24:14.180 --> 24:16.180
 psychologically after that I just

24:16.980 --> 24:19.220
 If I can set you up to be highly successful

24:19.900 --> 24:25.020
 With a given move or a set of tactics ten times in a row against quality opposition in the gym

24:25.020 --> 24:30.860
 I don't have to do a damn thing when it comes to instilling confidence. I will tell people

24:30.860 --> 24:33.360
 Hey, you're doing a really good job with that move. It's working well for you

24:34.060 --> 24:35.540
 but

24:35.540 --> 24:39.420
 When they nod in agreement, I'm not trying to force anything on them

24:39.460 --> 24:43.620
 They're recognized they or they already recognize that long before the words came out of my mouth

24:44.140 --> 24:51.940
 But on the other hand intelligent rational people will recognize when they're failing with given moves and no amount of talk on my part

24:51.940 --> 24:53.940
 Can ever change that?

24:53.940 --> 24:55.940
 if I teach Gordon

24:56.980 --> 24:58.980
 a given arm lock and

24:59.660 --> 25:04.180
 15 times in a row it tries it over a month and all 15 are failures

25:04.380 --> 25:08.060
 There's nothing I can say verbally to come up to Gordon say hey, you're really good at that move

25:08.060 --> 25:09.540
 He's gonna look at me say bullshit

25:09.540 --> 25:15.420
 I'm terrible at it and that will create a crisis of confidence where Gordon no longer believes the words coming out of my mouth

25:15.940 --> 25:22.140
 So I will never compromise that but isn't there a lot you just said 15 there you have to believe

25:22.140 --> 25:24.140
 that

25:24.780 --> 25:30.020
 Doing this arm lock 15 times over a period of a month is worth it because eventually you might get it

25:30.020 --> 25:33.980
 I think yeah, that's a separate issue that that's a separate issue that

25:37.020 --> 25:44.580
 There are times where I've more or less pushed athletes to go in a certain direction for example

25:45.180 --> 25:47.540
 When I first met Gary Tone and he never had a guillotine

25:47.540 --> 25:55.500
 Strangle and I would say to him Gary, you know, you're a scrambler like one of the greatest weapons a scrambler can ever develop as a guillotine

25:55.660 --> 25:57.660
 like it should be in your arsenal and

25:58.660 --> 26:01.780
 He was like and I just scrambled for the back and I said well

26:01.780 --> 26:07.420
 There's gonna be a day you can't take someone's back and it's always good to better strangle from front and back

26:07.660 --> 26:10.820
 Okay, of course, we all prefer a strangle from the back that makes sense

26:11.100 --> 26:14.180
 But there's gonna come a day where it's gonna be useful for you

26:14.180 --> 26:18.940
 and so that was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said you're learning this shut the fuck up and

26:20.580 --> 26:25.780
 You like literally wouldn't teach him any anything else until you got a guillotine. Yeah, Gary would like ask him a question

26:25.780 --> 26:27.780
 He's like, let's say you're guillotine

26:28.300 --> 26:29.700
 and

26:29.700 --> 26:36.380
 For the first three months as gifted as is Gary Tone and isn't learning most moves most moves Gary gets it like

26:37.020 --> 26:42.460
 in minutes there was something going on with Gary just couldn't get a guillotine on people and

26:42.460 --> 26:49.540
 And finally after around three months, he started having some success until ultimately became one of his best weapons

26:50.780 --> 26:54.060
 We had to go through like 15 different variations of guillotine

26:54.540 --> 27:01.220
 Until he found one which actually worked reliably for him and that was one of the few times where I put my foot down

27:01.220 --> 27:06.340
 I said no, do you have to learn this so the long search had to do more with the physical characteristics

27:06.340 --> 27:12.820
 I couldn't figure out the right like it made sense. It made sense in the case of Gary Tone because there were more opportunities per minute of

27:12.900 --> 27:14.900
 His grappling for guillotines

27:15.140 --> 27:18.500
 That the investment in time was worth it for another athlete

27:18.500 --> 27:21.940
 I might have said well he hardly ever gets in the situation but front and head on so guillotine

27:21.940 --> 27:24.300
 So it's not even worth investing the training time

27:24.940 --> 27:32.620
 Let me ask you a question on the on the competition side mentioned haters and do you think about this aspect of the competition with athletes?

27:32.620 --> 27:36.300
 It's a great question and the answer is no

27:38.620 --> 27:39.900
 I'm

27:39.900 --> 27:44.780
 You can see that you could you couldn't find two more polar opposites

27:45.700 --> 27:48.100
 psychologically than George St. Pierre and

27:48.820 --> 27:50.820
 this monstrosity on my left and

27:51.940 --> 27:59.180
 I've I've never said to my athletes. Hey, I think this is the sort of demeanor you should carry yourself with

27:59.180 --> 28:07.900
 I'm myself a very flawed character and I'm the last person on earth who should be delving out moral advice to other people

28:08.820 --> 28:13.020
 The only thing is that I you know, of course, I believe some things are off limits

28:13.100 --> 28:19.860
 But as long as it's done in the context of sport where no one's physically attacking people or do anything crazy where it just goes completely

28:19.860 --> 28:23.380
 Over the top then I I give almost zero

28:24.740 --> 28:27.660
 Moral advice to my athletes. I'm a jiu jitsu coach not a preacher

28:27.660 --> 28:29.660
 I

28:29.700 --> 28:31.700
 Fight if I may

28:31.820 --> 28:37.460
 We are entertainers, you know, we're athletes for professional athlete, but we make

28:38.500 --> 28:43.940
 We make a living because of people or want to see us perform

28:44.580 --> 28:48.420
 Same thing an actor or something a singer and a lot of the time

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
 especially in the fight game

28:52.140 --> 28:54.060
 An event is

28:54.060 --> 28:57.820
 Promoted it needs to be with emotion

28:58.940 --> 29:01.580
 Love me hate me, but do not ignore me

29:02.620 --> 29:04.220
 and

29:04.220 --> 29:05.700
 You know it

29:05.700 --> 29:07.700
 When it's authentic and it

29:08.740 --> 29:13.740
 It's done. Well, I think me my person in my my favorite fighters to watch are the one that are

29:14.780 --> 29:21.660
 That I that have a sort of some sort of a bad persona. I really enjoyed watching those guys because

29:21.660 --> 29:28.660
 They bring an emotion element into a fight, which is great, you know, I I feel to me

29:28.660 --> 29:33.500
 It's more interesting to watch when there is an emotion involved and I believe that's why

29:34.340 --> 29:38.220
 Some fighters make more money than others, you know, you know, what I mean

29:38.220 --> 29:42.860
 That's the reason why we make we can make a living out of this. Yeah, they're better entertainers

29:42.860 --> 29:47.580
 But you're right the authenticity seems to be really important. There's actually something very interesting there

29:47.580 --> 29:53.260
 Um, it's time to break out some some secrets. Do you know who?

29:53.940 --> 29:57.660
 Like you think of George St. Pierre, you think of like the highly technical polished

29:59.100 --> 30:05.340
 Martial artists. That's just gonna be great. Do you know who his favorite fighters to watch were?

30:06.060 --> 30:10.060
 You'd probably be thinking of probably someone who's really technically advanced

30:10.860 --> 30:11.900
 Actually

30:11.900 --> 30:16.240
 It was Mark Coleman. Oh, no, Kevin Randleman and Phil Barone

30:16.240 --> 30:22.080
 He used to love watching that. That was a hammerhouse. That was his favorite. He would love those guys and

30:22.880 --> 30:26.320
 whenever their fights were on George we watched in the Hammerhouse crew and

30:27.960 --> 30:35.880
 It's funny what you said about how they those guys bought an intensity to to MMA that was off the charts

30:35.880 --> 30:37.880
 Have you ever met those guys in?

30:38.360 --> 30:42.240
 in their prime, let me tell you it was it was something to behold and

30:42.240 --> 30:46.400
 And I had this crazy larger than life personality

30:47.280 --> 30:51.680
 Most of the things I did made no sense whatsoever, but mean technically, but that was their appeal

30:51.680 --> 30:56.160
 Yeah, and they were these guys and George loved to watch them more than anyone else

30:56.400 --> 31:01.360
 You never knew what could happen with these guys. I remember when Mark Coleman won the Pride Grand Prix

31:01.360 --> 31:04.880
 I wasn't my living room. I was jumping. I was so happy. I was like, yeah

31:05.920 --> 31:08.400
 He beat Igor Vorchevchin. I was like

31:08.400 --> 31:11.600
 I like to me. It was amazing. You know what I mean?

31:12.240 --> 31:16.840
 Because of the emotion that they brought into the fight George is actually very

31:17.720 --> 31:20.640
 Interested by something you said that normally when I

31:22.000 --> 31:24.400
 Ask what is the appeal of a given fighter?

31:25.200 --> 31:32.240
 And what makes people watch a fight you you talked about the idea that fighters entertainers and that's absolutely correct that they are

31:33.400 --> 31:36.840
 It's this weird weird industry where you're you're

31:36.840 --> 31:42.840
 You're both an athlete and an entertainer and you need to be successful in both regards to become

31:43.800 --> 31:46.280
 financially successful in so far as

31:47.560 --> 31:54.200
 Your favorite athletes to watch at least with people who are almost like the polar opposite of who you are

31:54.920 --> 31:58.680
 Um, I've always said that most people if you look at

32:00.040 --> 32:03.000
 Say a million people watch a pay per view event

32:03.000 --> 32:08.840
 What percentage of those million people have a genuine technical understanding

32:09.560 --> 32:11.560
 Of what's happening as they watch a fight?

32:12.600 --> 32:14.600
 It's tiny

32:15.080 --> 32:24.040
 It's absolutely tiny the vast majority of people who watch a professional fight have almost no technical understanding

32:24.840 --> 32:28.360
 Of what's going on in front of them. So how do they relate to the fight?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
 What's the only way they can?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
 It's through emotion

32:34.520 --> 32:37.720
 And so when they get a sense that these two don't like each other

32:38.440 --> 32:40.440
 Then they can relate to the fight

32:40.600 --> 32:46.440
 But only a tiny percentage of people watching a given professional fight can relate to it on a technical level

32:47.160 --> 32:49.160
 The overwhelming majority will always

32:49.640 --> 32:54.680
 Form an emotional attachment to the fight. That's why when you see things shows that u of c prime time

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
 They never focus on

32:57.000 --> 33:01.240
 The tactics and the techniques of the fight they focus on the emotional elements the

33:01.640 --> 33:05.240
 Preparation the the view of their own family members as athletes get ready

33:05.560 --> 33:07.560
 It's always an emotional poll

33:07.640 --> 33:12.920
 Because that's how 99 of the viewers relate to the fight if I have think about chess

33:13.320 --> 33:17.320
 Okay, if I have minimal knowledge of two world champions

33:18.280 --> 33:22.600
 Coming to to fight each other and or match up against each other in a game of chess

33:22.600 --> 33:28.200
 I know so little about chess tactics, and I can't really form any kind of technical

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
 Appreciation of what's going on on the board

33:31.800 --> 33:34.840
 But if you tell me that these two chess players hate each other's guts

33:34.840 --> 33:37.240
 And they've got a rivalry which goes back five years

33:37.640 --> 33:42.600
 And they've said this and that about each other in public then suddenly I might is pick up and I'm like, oh, okay

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
 this sounds interesting

33:45.400 --> 33:51.480
 Because I just don't have the the knowledge to appreciate what's going on on the board in a chess game to be able to

33:51.480 --> 33:56.920
 To appreciate the the technical nuances of what they're doing. So any

33:57.960 --> 34:03.000
 Interest that I have in the chess match is going to have to come from some kind of emotional level because I'm just not qualified

34:03.400 --> 34:09.480
 To make technical assessments and that's exactly how it is in the case of both grappling and mixed martial arts

34:09.880 --> 34:15.320
 That's why the ones who evoke the most attention are always the ones who can form some kind of emotional appeal

34:15.640 --> 34:17.640
 Conor McGregor was the all time master of this

34:18.280 --> 34:20.280
 I believe also

34:20.280 --> 34:22.840
 A emotion can be used as a weapon

34:24.040 --> 34:28.680
 For example, I've learned I've learned this from my favorite boxer is sugary Leonard

34:29.480 --> 34:34.440
 Sugary Leonard. I remember I was very young. So I watched his fight later when I was older

34:34.440 --> 34:36.440
 But I know that sugary Leonard

34:37.240 --> 34:40.600
 Was the best boxer of his era to me personally

34:41.160 --> 34:43.160
 And I don't think nobody could

34:43.320 --> 34:47.160
 Beat him. I think he was skill skill wise. It was the best. However

34:47.160 --> 34:50.360
 When he fought in Montreal, Roberto Zoran

34:51.480 --> 34:53.480
 Roberto Zoran

34:55.960 --> 34:59.480
 Made it in a way that Leonard became very emotional

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
 He wanted to stand in front of Zoran

35:02.280 --> 35:04.280
 And fight a different fight that

35:04.680 --> 35:07.880
 That he normally does because he wanted to show that he's a man

35:08.920 --> 35:11.720
 And he lost that fight which was a mistake

35:12.360 --> 35:14.120
 so by by

35:14.120 --> 35:21.160
 Then later on he beat Roberto Zoran in quite easy, you know, the the fair the everybody remembered the no mass thing

35:21.720 --> 35:23.720
 but my point is

35:24.040 --> 35:26.520
 Emotion can be used in a way

35:27.240 --> 35:30.520
 That it can make your derail your opponent

35:31.000 --> 35:35.640
 Out of his game plan and I felt a lot of my opponent trying to do that with me

35:36.040 --> 35:39.880
 So that's why I never got involved. That was my way to defend myself against

35:39.880 --> 35:45.000
 Some kind of bullying to put like a like a shield in front but some other guy like

35:45.960 --> 35:52.920
 Gordon he he expressed himself differently. Of course, there's a language barrier, but for him he's better at

35:53.800 --> 35:57.400
 Giving giving giving back. That says he's a better counter attacker

35:57.400 --> 36:03.640
 You know, that's the way you respond to to to the aggression of of an emotional attack

36:03.640 --> 36:08.520
 I think everybody's different in that regard. It's interesting that John said that he doesn't

36:08.520 --> 36:14.280
 Uh, study the tactics of this game or maybe you're not interested in the tactics of this game

36:14.280 --> 36:19.400
 Because it seems like this is more than just being an entertainer. It seems like it could be an effective part of the match

36:19.400 --> 36:22.760
 Yeah, I just feel like whatever investment you make in that

36:23.640 --> 36:25.240
 is

36:25.240 --> 36:30.760
 It's going to get negligible rewards. First of all, it's probably only going to pertain to one match in front of you rather than the

36:30.760 --> 36:32.760
 totality of your career and

36:33.640 --> 36:35.640
 Whatever gains you get out of psychology

36:35.640 --> 36:37.640
 or trickery and play

36:39.240 --> 36:41.240
 Typically

36:42.280 --> 36:48.280
 Don't last long you you've raised an example with uh, Sugar Radley, and he did fight outside of his usual

36:49.240 --> 36:53.640
 Uh, manner in that regard, but rather than me try to tell someone. Hey

36:54.360 --> 36:56.360
 Uh, behave like this before a fight

36:56.360 --> 37:02.200
 I would have been probably more forceful between rounds with an athlete and say no, no, no you're fighting this fight the wrong way

37:02.200 --> 37:07.400
 and that would have a much more beneficial impact on my athlete than

37:08.120 --> 37:10.120
 psychological trickery before a fight

37:10.360 --> 37:12.360
 I believe another example of

37:13.320 --> 37:15.320
 Emotion that leads to failure is uh

37:16.280 --> 37:18.280
 Jose Aldo against Conor McGregor

37:19.240 --> 37:21.240
 I think it was

37:21.240 --> 37:28.200
 It was uh on purpose that Conor McGregor did this try to bait Aldo to become over aggressive to open himself

37:28.200 --> 37:32.440
 Because he's an excellent counterpuncher puncher. That's what I believe

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
 It made a mistake

37:35.000 --> 37:37.480
 There's another great one my match against cyborg

37:38.280 --> 37:40.280
 2018 no gee worlds

37:40.280 --> 37:41.800
 Where he didn't even try to win

37:41.800 --> 37:46.520
 He just like wanted to smack me in the face the whole time because he was so angry that I was talking shit to him before the match

37:47.160 --> 37:50.120
 And uh, it was like the finals of the absolute. It was like the biggest

37:50.760 --> 37:55.720
 Match of the weekend, and he just didn't even try to pass my guard or do anything. He just wanted to hit me in the face

37:55.720 --> 38:03.240
 And I was like sick. I just won. It was incredibly fresh. It's fascinating to watch like a grown man sort of lose

38:03.240 --> 38:05.240
 composure

38:05.240 --> 38:11.320
 It's very interesting Gordon one thing I've always been very impressed with with you and that's um

38:12.600 --> 38:15.080
 No matter how heated torque gets

38:15.880 --> 38:20.760
 Before a match with you when you go out to grapple you're absolutely cold

38:20.760 --> 38:25.880
 Like I've you've never gone into a a match carrying anything other than just

38:26.680 --> 38:28.680
 cold blooded

38:28.680 --> 38:29.880
 calculation and

38:29.880 --> 38:31.880
 You've always been able to separate very well

38:32.840 --> 38:37.160
 The idea of words and deeds and I think that's always been one of your

38:37.880 --> 38:43.160
 Um, one of your strongest assets a way I often measure this is when a match is over

38:43.160 --> 38:46.760
 I will ask the athlete questions about the match

38:46.760 --> 38:50.760
 And if they can't answer the question, what were you doing in the fourth minute?

38:51.320 --> 38:58.200
 Okay, what was that setup you used in in the third minute that got you into the kimura lock if they can't answer that that tells me

38:59.080 --> 39:03.960
 They were just fighting on instincts and emotion, but with Gordon. It's like a log book

39:05.560 --> 39:11.560
 It's like okay in the seventh minute you went for that uh, uh, jiu jitsu guitar be set up from from uh on the left side

39:12.360 --> 39:13.560
 What were you thinking?

39:13.560 --> 39:17.160
 He can always give an answer. He's absolutely stone cold

39:19.480 --> 39:21.480
 Speaking of emotion

39:22.520 --> 39:30.040
 Uh, Gordon you will potentially if you're healthy face andre govall and the adcc coming up a super fight

39:31.080 --> 39:36.040
 Uh, who is andre govall for people who don't know can you tell the story of your beef with?

39:37.080 --> 39:41.240
 Uh, the the emotional interaction with a man. Yeah, so

39:41.240 --> 39:46.280
 Andre is uh, he's considered the greatest adcc competitor of all time

39:46.840 --> 39:48.840
 multiple time black belt world champion

39:49.400 --> 39:53.000
 uh, winningest adcc champion ever he has six six gold medals

39:53.560 --> 39:56.120
 and uh, I've been trying to compete against him

39:57.480 --> 40:01.800
 Pretty much forever like since I got my black belt in 2016. I've been trying to get matches with him

40:02.520 --> 40:07.480
 Uh, he was in the first dbi that I did and he ended up pulling out and that I've been trying to get matches with him

40:07.480 --> 40:13.400
 And uh, he would always say no and give one reason or another and then uh,

40:14.520 --> 40:20.520
 After the last adcc, I was like, hey andre said he was retiring after this after this uh,

40:21.080 --> 40:26.680
 This competition. So if he wants to retire, you know, he's he's the greatest adcc competitor of all time and

40:27.240 --> 40:31.720
 I think it's great. But if he wants to compete and that's great. I was like super nice and then he started like

40:31.720 --> 40:39.080
 Posting like passive aggressive instagram, uh, uh, captions and uh, then we started going back and forth on the internet

40:39.320 --> 40:43.320
 And there was like one point where I saw him in person when he

40:43.880 --> 40:47.880
 Acknowledged he's like, I understand like what you're doing. Like we're gonna pump this fight up and he was like totally on board

40:48.200 --> 40:54.120
 But then there must have been something that happened where like it changed from like him like going along with it to being like actually pissed

40:54.760 --> 40:58.280
 And then uh, there was that one night at flow where I went to go shake hands with him

40:58.280 --> 41:03.240
 He flipped me off and then he fought me backstage and started to try to fight me and then I spacked him and

41:04.600 --> 41:06.600
 Then he didn't want to fight anymore

41:06.600 --> 41:09.640
 And then we've been going back. He's actually blocked me on instagram now. So

41:10.200 --> 41:13.240
 He won't he just won't engage. No one from atos won't engage now

41:13.240 --> 41:17.400
 But it's gonna be interesting how he how he shows up if he can keep it under control or not

41:17.800 --> 41:23.880
 Do you think how do you explain that level of emotion? Is this fear of losing your throne? Is it

41:23.880 --> 41:30.200
 Is it just the human being like with cyborg? Just just becoming emotionally unstable. It might just be me

41:30.360 --> 41:35.000
 I just have a way to get get under people's skin. It's just I don't know. Uh, he's he's

41:35.640 --> 41:38.280
 He was he was cool for a while and then I just I don't know. It's just

41:39.160 --> 41:44.600
 Everyone gets like this. They're all so emotional by the time they actually step up to compete that it's pretty easy to read them

41:44.600 --> 41:50.200
 They're either so emotional that they want to actually come forward and and beat me like uh, like Tim Spray

41:50.200 --> 41:55.400
 That they want to actually come forward and and beat me like uh, like tim spriggs is a perfect example at avcc

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
 I posted like

41:57.960 --> 42:00.440
 On my story on instagram like 10 minutes before a match

42:01.000 --> 42:03.880
 I said like what i'm going to do to tim spriggs is going to be criminal

42:04.280 --> 42:09.240
 And he's like a very stally guy and he came he saw that and then he came out and actually tried to fight me

42:09.240 --> 42:12.120
 Like he came and actually engaged my guard and I ended up submitting him

42:12.360 --> 42:14.760
 So it either has that effect or it has the effect where

42:14.760 --> 42:21.640
 They know I've talked so much shit leading up to the match that they're so afraid to lose that they just get super stally

42:21.640 --> 42:22.200
 And they move away

42:22.200 --> 42:25.720
 So it either has one effect where they come forward and they want to they want to beat me beat me

42:26.120 --> 42:29.400
 Or they want to just they're so afraid of getting submitted that they know if they engage

42:29.640 --> 42:32.520
 They're super cagey and they just back away and don't really do anything

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
 Do you think this match happens?

42:35.640 --> 42:38.600
 There's a lot of variables and one I have to see how my stomach is and two

42:39.160 --> 42:41.880
 If I'm actually going to show up and compete in my stomachs healthy

42:41.880 --> 42:47.000
 I doubt that Andre will actually show up to compete. I've been trying to compete against him for six years and

42:47.480 --> 42:50.040
 He hasn't done it. So there's no reason to think he would now

42:50.360 --> 42:55.960
 Is it possible for you to speak to where like your estimates are about your stomach or is it too unclear for now?

42:56.360 --> 42:59.480
 Still too early to tell I have this round of treatment that I'm doing until

42:59.960 --> 43:03.400
 Late February and I'm pretty sure that I need to do the same test

43:03.400 --> 43:07.000
 They did initially to retest all my levels and then go from there

43:07.000 --> 43:11.400
 So I've been feeling a little bit better like it's not nearly as bad as it used to be

43:12.040 --> 43:15.320
 I was explaining to someone the other day like for the last four years

43:15.400 --> 43:18.680
 I would be so nauseous that every time I would walk into a new room

43:19.080 --> 43:22.600
 I'd have to actively locate a garbage can in case I have to throw up

43:22.920 --> 43:26.040
 So I'm like one step above that right now. I'm like doing a little bit better than that

43:26.600 --> 43:29.640
 So it's definitely getting a little bit better, but it's not it's not where it needs to be

43:29.640 --> 43:36.280
 Can we can we talk about diet for just a second because both of you George and and Gordon

43:37.320 --> 43:44.200
 like suffered from stomach issues different kind and have arrived for now for different places

43:44.520 --> 43:46.520
 so can you maybe George speak to

43:48.120 --> 43:51.880
 The general question of what is the best diet for performance for training?

43:52.040 --> 43:56.280
 Like what have you learned through your career about this? Well, I think everybody is different

43:56.280 --> 43:58.920
 Um, to me personally

43:59.880 --> 44:01.880
 Uh, I implement fasting

44:02.680 --> 44:03.800
 um

44:03.800 --> 44:06.840
 time restricted eating and and prolonged fasting

44:07.480 --> 44:12.280
 What's the longest you've done so far? The longest I've done is five days. I do it quite often

44:12.680 --> 44:14.680
 I do I do four times a year. I do

44:15.640 --> 44:17.400
 three to five days

44:17.400 --> 44:19.400
 water fast

44:20.120 --> 44:25.160
 And I I liked it. It helps me with inflammation. I think it boosts the immune system

44:25.160 --> 44:32.520
 And uh, that's just about the I read papers about about this and uh, it helps me also feel

44:33.400 --> 44:38.680
 Feel good. It's kind of uh, very therapeutic to me physical and mental just mental

44:39.480 --> 44:45.960
 mental and physical because when I eat my when I break my fast and I sit at the table with with other people

44:47.000 --> 44:51.080
 It doesn't matter what I eat if we all eat the same thing. I always tell them

44:51.080 --> 44:57.240
 I said my my food right now tastes better than all of yours, you know, because I you know, I

44:57.800 --> 44:59.800
 I have this

44:59.800 --> 45:06.280
 thing that I think I believe sometimes you need to put yourself into suffering to realize how

45:07.320 --> 45:09.320
 pleasurable something is

45:09.320 --> 45:11.000
 and uh

45:11.000 --> 45:12.120
 I uh

45:12.120 --> 45:13.320
 tend

45:13.320 --> 45:16.440
 Personally like diet wise I eat whatever I want

45:16.440 --> 45:20.600
 Whenever I want I don't I no longer have any problem with this

45:21.720 --> 45:24.520
 But if I would have a competition coming up like

45:25.240 --> 45:28.440
 Knowing that I what I know now about my body I would

45:29.240 --> 45:31.240
 orient myself

45:31.240 --> 45:33.640
 More towards an animal based diet

45:34.520 --> 45:39.560
 That's because I've tried different things and that's the kind of diet that I believe helped me

45:40.520 --> 45:46.360
 having less inflammation and feel better in terms of performance for for for doing something

45:46.360 --> 45:48.920
 physical so high protein high fat low carbs

45:49.800 --> 45:51.160
 well

45:51.160 --> 45:54.360
 This is is different between animal based diet and keto

45:54.920 --> 46:00.600
 I mean there's carbs. There is a lot of fruit. Uh, I got a lot of the the carbs from the fruit

46:01.560 --> 46:03.800
 a lot of organs organs, um

46:05.720 --> 46:09.560
 I know a little bit about paleontology and in the the past of

46:11.160 --> 46:14.040
 About you a prehistoric human and and I I know that

46:14.040 --> 46:15.640
 Um

46:15.640 --> 46:19.800
 And not not only about that. I know because I've traveled certain place in the world

46:19.880 --> 46:25.960
 I want to to visit the maasai in africa the yantar gather tribe and I know that when they kill an animal

46:26.680 --> 46:31.480
 They go for the organs first and I know a pretty most predatory animal. They do the same thing

46:31.640 --> 46:37.400
 So organs I believe is something that normally in in our culture in the western part of the world

46:37.400 --> 46:40.280
 We don't really eat but it's something that is very nutritious

46:40.280 --> 46:44.040
 Have you been able to convince gordon to try fasting?

46:45.960 --> 46:47.960
 Really talk about diets

46:48.040 --> 46:51.640
 It's a different situation. I think for gordon because he's an heavy weight

46:51.960 --> 46:57.400
 He doesn't want to lose weight. You know when a heavy weight the range of uh, like my my range was like

46:57.480 --> 47:00.200
 I was a welterweight and middle weight, but the heavy weight

47:00.280 --> 47:05.160
 It's like some of the guys that you can can compete against there might be 300 pounds. So

47:05.880 --> 47:07.720
 If you lose weight

47:07.720 --> 47:10.360
 It's a it's a big problem. You know what I mean? So

47:10.680 --> 47:14.040
 And there are things that will work for me that might not work for gordon

47:14.040 --> 47:18.680
 You know, so we have to make his own experience and and I told gordon sometime when everybody goes left

47:18.760 --> 47:22.440
 You try to go right see how you feel with certain things experiment

47:23.240 --> 47:25.240
 not not a topic, uh

47:25.560 --> 47:27.560
 That's part of your optimization

47:27.800 --> 47:29.560
 optimal performance formula

47:29.560 --> 47:33.960
 Well, uh, what I used to do before my stomach issues and for those of you listening who don't know

47:33.960 --> 47:39.560
 I had recurring staph infections in 2018 and I took a bunch of oral antibiotics

47:39.560 --> 47:45.800
 And it just completely wiped out my stomach. So I just was diagnosed. It was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis

47:45.960 --> 47:51.720
 So for those of you messaging me on instagram who are just watching rogan ask me about my gastroparesis. That's not what I have

47:52.120 --> 47:57.400
 Um, they misdiagnosed it and uh, I did some other tests and for four years. They didn't even know what it was

47:58.120 --> 48:01.160
 and then I got this uh, I went to this doctor in california who

48:01.160 --> 48:07.640
 Uh diagnosed me with I have h pylori and then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth of my small intestines

48:07.720 --> 48:09.720
 So the issues in the small intestines

48:09.960 --> 48:13.560
 Um, so what I used to do was I used to do like seasons where I'd have

48:14.040 --> 48:18.200
 A very clean season where I was competing and I would have a lower body weight

48:18.440 --> 48:23.880
 And I would do like an off season kind of like a bodybuilder where I would eat a lot more food and a little bit dirtier food

48:23.960 --> 48:27.560
 And I would have cheeseburgers and pizza at night time to have the extra calories

48:27.560 --> 48:32.840
 Um, but now I can't eat those foods because they upset my stomach. So now I pretty much just try to eat whatever I can

48:32.840 --> 48:34.840
 And maintain the weight the best I can

48:34.840 --> 48:41.000
 Um, based around how my stomach feels. So right now it's like rice chicken eggs fish

48:41.640 --> 48:43.560
 vegetables fruits

48:43.560 --> 48:46.040
 And pretty much nothing else like anything hard to digest

48:46.680 --> 48:52.200
 Uh, anything spicy red meat fast food all that's all that's hard for me

48:52.200 --> 49:00.040
 Which sucks because in Texas all the best things. Yeah barbecue. And I mean this diet is really important for you

49:00.040 --> 49:02.040
 John, I can tell um

49:02.680 --> 49:06.840
 Like is it is that something you think about for athletes at all again? This is part of the

49:06.920 --> 49:10.760
 No, I've um to be honest with you. Um, I've never seen

49:11.320 --> 49:13.160
 Any measurable

49:13.160 --> 49:16.760
 improvement in sports performance in jiu jitsu by change of diet

49:16.760 --> 49:23.480
 Uh, I do believe that diet is important for longevity in human beings and I do think it makes a difference

49:23.480 --> 49:25.480
 Especially once you get past the age of 40

49:25.960 --> 49:26.840
 um

49:26.840 --> 49:28.840
 With regards longevity

49:29.000 --> 49:34.200
 For older athletes, I do believe it makes it some difference. But my observation is in athletes

49:35.480 --> 49:37.480
 In their youth and working up into their prime

49:38.040 --> 49:40.520
 I've seen athletes have the worst

49:41.160 --> 49:43.160
 diets

49:43.160 --> 49:48.760
 Uh, God bless Travis Stevens for that guy won an olympic silver medal basically on mcdonalds and candy. Yeah

49:49.960 --> 49:55.000
 Uh, George st. Pierre for 80 of your career. You were powered by mcdonalds and coca cola

49:55.480 --> 50:00.600
 The two genial freddo that was my yeah my my meal of choice before a championship fight

50:00.920 --> 50:05.960
 Uh, gordon for him his youth was just five guys hamburgers garyton and the same thing

50:06.680 --> 50:12.040
 I've worked with japanese judo players who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and won olympic gold medals

50:12.040 --> 50:16.440
 Um, I've worked with russian wrestlers who just ate

50:18.600 --> 50:23.320
 Whatever was put in front of them and their athletic performance was outstanding

50:23.960 --> 50:24.440
 um

50:24.440 --> 50:28.280
 I've worked with other guys who did have what would be considered a very clean diet and

50:28.840 --> 50:32.680
 Their performance was no better than anyone else on the mat. So I've I've never

50:33.400 --> 50:39.400
 I've never seen someone say okay. I changed my diet and because of that there was a measurable

50:39.400 --> 50:44.360
 Improvement, you know in sports performance another way to phrase it though is um

50:44.600 --> 50:47.640
 I have noticed with a lot of lead athletes what they eat

50:48.280 --> 50:53.000
 They begin to believe that that either is not a hindrance or it's actually good

50:53.240 --> 50:56.920
 Like Travis steve is an example of somebody who eats shitty

50:57.560 --> 50:59.160
 Because he believes

50:59.160 --> 51:01.160
 it's like it's like a power because

51:01.480 --> 51:07.080
 Whatever he's traveling across the world. He can't rely on healthy good food to be there. So i'm going to eat shitty

51:07.080 --> 51:12.440
 So that that's that like my body knows how to perform under whatever skittles or whatever

51:12.520 --> 51:19.400
 Everywhere's got mcdonald's everywhere's got mcdonald's so that makes like and they've convinced themselves and you talk about russian athletes

51:19.560 --> 51:21.560
 a lot of them have very

51:21.960 --> 51:23.960
 strong beliefs about like this

51:24.280 --> 51:29.800
 But a particular food being good for them, but there's no agreement among them. Exactly. It's no agreement

51:29.880 --> 51:32.760
 Yeah, yeah, so believe is more important than the actual diet. Yeah

51:32.760 --> 51:36.040
 Yeah, if I can after

51:36.600 --> 51:40.360
 You know after a night out when you're hanging over

51:41.560 --> 51:45.560
 I think the best thing and and i'm saying this in all sincerity

51:45.960 --> 51:50.920
 I think the best thing to eat to me was like like a cheese cheeseburgers with

51:51.400 --> 51:57.800
 It's we call that a putzin back home because it's very fat. It's greasy. So it up. So the next day

51:57.800 --> 52:02.040
 When you wake up, I think you feel better because it absorbed the alcohol. There you go

52:02.840 --> 52:08.920
 You can train and start the gas. My mom told me the same story once and then I try I was like

52:09.000 --> 52:14.040
 I was hungover for some party and uh, I woke up. I was like probably I don't know 19 or 20

52:14.040 --> 52:18.040
 I woke up and uh, my mom was like, yeah, I just have it have a cheeseburger go

52:18.280 --> 52:21.560
 Go eat something greasy and I did and I was like, oh, I feel kind of better now

52:21.560 --> 52:28.680
 Yeah, I do not know the science the exact science behind it, but I always notice and I don't know if it's placebo

52:29.160 --> 52:31.800
 But I always notice that if I if I'm

52:32.440 --> 52:35.160
 If I'm if I party hard and I've been drinking a lot

52:36.200 --> 52:39.640
 If I don't eat before I go into bed if I don't eat shitty food

52:39.960 --> 52:45.480
 The next day I will wake up and feel worse than if I eat shitty food. I feel better. I know it sounds crazy

52:45.960 --> 52:47.960
 I don't know why but it works for me

52:47.960 --> 52:54.840
 Yeah, but it's also hard to do science on extreme performers. So the discussions we're having is amongst the very

52:55.880 --> 52:59.880
 You know, that this might not apply to a general like recreational athlete

53:00.200 --> 53:04.200
 But for the elite, I've just seen champions in every kind of combat sport

53:04.280 --> 53:09.720
 And I've never seen a correlation between dietary habit and performance and people under the age of 30

53:10.360 --> 53:15.240
 I do believe that diet is important for longevity. However, and uh for that alone

53:15.240 --> 53:17.800
 It that may well be worth investing time in it

53:18.040 --> 53:23.240
 But with regard to sports performance at least in jiu jitsu, I've never seen any significant difference

53:23.320 --> 53:25.320
 Well, we had a little bit of a

53:25.320 --> 53:31.400
 A difference of opinion on this. I think uh, what about strength training and muscle building or at least we had the discussion about this

53:31.480 --> 53:33.480
 So what do you believe is the value of?

53:35.560 --> 53:39.480
 Of you know training outside of the sport so fitness

53:40.280 --> 53:43.720
 Lifting heavy lifting explosive all kinds of lifting

53:43.720 --> 53:49.000
 I believe personally for me. I believe and I've learned that from from john

53:49.960 --> 53:52.280
 uh, I used to to do like

53:53.080 --> 53:58.600
 To train like a bodybuilder before because I thought in my early days of competition

53:58.760 --> 54:04.920
 That was the most efficient way to do things to because it was like I was watching Jean Claude van Damme

54:05.480 --> 54:09.720
 Arnold Schwarzenegger. We thought back back in the day. That was the thing

54:09.720 --> 54:14.520
 That that's how we should do it, you know for to get ready for a fight

54:15.240 --> 54:16.760
 but I realize

54:16.760 --> 54:18.760
 later on

54:19.560 --> 54:21.560
 That it's all about efficiency

54:22.360 --> 54:27.080
 And some guys they don't lift at all and they're doing pretty well. So I

54:27.960 --> 54:31.000
 Do cross training mostly for longevity

54:31.720 --> 54:33.720
 It's mostly for a therapeutic

54:33.720 --> 54:40.920
 There like a therapy. It's more therapeutic than for performances to keep my body healthy to do a certain movement

54:41.000 --> 54:45.880
 That are different than what I do every day in the gym in combat sport to keep me

54:47.240 --> 54:54.200
 Uh, healthy and and athletic so all the interesting movement stuff that you've done outside the sport that was for

54:55.000 --> 54:56.600
 therapeutic mostly therapeutic

54:56.600 --> 54:58.200
 I think it does it could

54:58.200 --> 55:04.120
 Trans transcend to performance, but it's mostly therapeutic. I do not believe that squatting

55:05.000 --> 55:10.920
 Five plates or or bench bench pressing three plate will make me a better fighter

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
 I do not I believe actually it could hurt me more. It could damage me more than than benefit me

55:17.880 --> 55:19.240
 so

55:19.240 --> 55:21.560
 Gordon somebody who on instagram post

55:22.280 --> 55:25.080
 A lot of pictures of you being shredded and huge

55:25.080 --> 55:30.360
 Uh, what's the value of of strength? So I do like a combination of uh

55:31.400 --> 55:33.800
 John got us big into like gymnastics type movements

55:34.360 --> 55:37.560
 Like toes to bar and muscle ups and things like that when we were young

55:38.040 --> 55:38.600
 um

55:38.600 --> 55:43.560
 Like toes to bar because that's like the exact motion you have to do when you're retaining guards needs to chest

55:44.120 --> 55:46.120
 um, so I do a lot of that stuff

55:46.520 --> 55:48.520
 in combination with I do a lot of

55:49.080 --> 55:51.160
 Opposite of george. I do a lot of bodybuilding workouts

55:51.160 --> 55:58.840
 Um, where I do like a basic split like a chest and triceps back and biceps day. Um, and my idea is that

56:01.560 --> 56:08.280
 Weightlifting should always be a supplement to jiu jitsu. So you shouldn't be missing a jiu jitsu session to lift weights

56:08.680 --> 56:14.360
 Um, so I don't do I do probably I train jiu jitsu every day and I lift three to four times a week

56:14.680 --> 56:19.240
 Um, I feel like lifting seven days a week for me is too much and the lifting takes a lot of energy

56:19.240 --> 56:21.240
 When you do like hard lifts like that

56:21.560 --> 56:27.400
 But my idea is if you want to get good at jiu jitsu do jiu jitsu and if you want to be bigger and stronger lift weights and

56:27.880 --> 56:30.360
 uh and eat food and um

56:31.080 --> 56:36.840
 I I generally don't go super heavy when I lift because you start putting crazy weights then start tearing muscles and stuff

56:37.160 --> 56:42.680
 Um, so I usually do moderate weights with a with a very high rep rep range like four sets of 20 with a drop set at the end

56:42.760 --> 56:44.920
 to fatigue the muscles break the fibers and

56:45.560 --> 56:46.840
 grow

56:46.840 --> 56:54.040
 Okay, so uh four sets of 20. That's interesting. So that's more for endurance and raw strength. Yeah, and also I think

56:54.680 --> 56:57.320
 Closer to competition. I'll pick the intensity up and

56:58.040 --> 57:02.200
 While there's no real way to get significant gains in vo2 max

57:02.520 --> 57:06.600
 I think that lifting and just getting used to mentally redlining

57:07.080 --> 57:12.440
 Um gets me kind of in competition shape because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the guys I'm training with

57:12.440 --> 57:18.760
 They're not on a technical level where they can physically exhaust me to the point where I feel like I'm gonna die

57:19.320 --> 57:22.760
 But uh, I get most of that like when I'm wrestling because I'm not as efficient in wrestling

57:22.760 --> 57:24.760
 So I get a lot more tired

57:24.760 --> 57:27.960
 And lifting when you do like if you do like four sets of 20

57:28.280 --> 57:32.120
 Leg press to squat and you go back and forth like you're like about to die at the end

57:32.280 --> 57:37.080
 And I think I feel like gets me in the mental habit of redlining before competition

57:37.400 --> 57:39.160
 But does muscle help you?

57:39.160 --> 57:45.160
 It's like the actual mass of muscle like that. So I think being stronger will always help and the combat will always help

57:45.400 --> 57:46.600
 Yeah

57:46.600 --> 57:49.320
 To some degree it's not going to be to a degree where

57:50.440 --> 57:52.440
 It overrides efficiency, but I think that

57:53.080 --> 57:59.240
 It can't help being or can't hurt being stronger. Well, there's a bunch of people who believe depending on the sport that

58:01.400 --> 58:03.400
 The strength can quickly become uh

58:04.120 --> 58:06.680
 That have detrimental effects to efficiency

58:06.680 --> 58:09.160
 So like I agree that certain kind

58:09.800 --> 58:13.000
 I mean if strength is purely is like very cleanly

58:13.560 --> 58:18.280
 Purely applied to the exact movements of the sport. So in judo the explosiveness you need

58:18.760 --> 58:25.000
 Is very difficult to replicate in any kind of way except by doing judo. Yeah, I mean for us, uh

58:25.560 --> 58:30.280
 I don't always have to understand there's only so much technique that can overcome a certain amount of strength

58:30.280 --> 58:33.560
 Like if we all try to fight a silverback gorilla, it's gonna kill us

58:33.560 --> 58:37.400
 Um, but that that being said, um, I do think that

58:37.960 --> 58:45.080
 Like for example heavyweights are usually the least technical because they rely on their size and strength to beat smaller people

58:45.720 --> 58:50.360
 But I think that if you stay with us with a discipline of doing everything very precise

58:50.600 --> 58:54.920
 And I train with a lot smaller people most of the time. So I get out of the habit of using

58:55.800 --> 58:59.160
 Using my strength. Um, I think if you're very precise of the way that you train

58:59.160 --> 59:05.320
 I think that the the extra size and strength can help you quick question. How would you fight a silverback gorilla?

59:07.720 --> 59:13.400
 I mean, is there which animal do you think you can actually defeat that would be impressive that most people would say you can't

59:14.120 --> 59:16.120
 You know, I actually

59:16.120 --> 59:19.320
 I don't have an uh, an answer to this. I thought you were gonna say I want

59:19.400 --> 59:24.040
 I want I want to say that me and john had like a four hour discussion on this one time

59:24.040 --> 59:29.880
 I'm like, what would win bear or gorilla and he went into like this whole dissertation about how like jaguar

59:30.040 --> 59:35.000
 Spin underneath and like bear and bolo silverbacks and kill them and like rip their rip their artery and their legs out

59:35.080 --> 59:39.080
 It was amazing. I guess okay. So before we talk about strength. John, let me ask you what

59:40.040 --> 59:43.640
 Do you think people would be surprised by if two animals faced

59:44.200 --> 59:46.680
 One of them would win and people wouldn't predict that

59:46.680 --> 59:53.560
 So they would be surprised by the effectiveness of certain animal at fighting in the whether it's in the forest in the jungle

59:53.880 --> 59:55.880
 So let's slow down

59:56.840 --> 59:59.160
 So there's two animals of different species fighting

59:59.960 --> 1:00:01.960
 and most people would pick

1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:08.840
 So for example, the lion gets a lot of credit for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why the king of the jungle

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:12.680
 Well, I you know, a lot of people told me that the lion

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:15.320
 for example, the tiger can

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:18.280
 Be lion. Yeah, this is one of those age old debates

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:23.880
 It's in the most difficult. Yeah. Well in grappling in fighting. It feels like some animals use

1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:25.560
 teeth

1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:27.080
 And some use

1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:31.800
 Other parts of their body also like bear. Actually, I don't even know how they

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.240
 I think they have extraordinarily powerful

1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:42.280
 And long claws and in addition they're powerful biters as well. So I wonder in the same with the silverback

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:45.720
 I don't know how much there. I love that we're having this discussion

1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:50.520
 We need Joe Rogan for this discussion. I think so. Yeah, I think so. Um, so

1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:56.120
 Your your question has gone and in about five different. So it started with strength

1:00:57.240 --> 1:00:59.080
 And let's go back there, which is

1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:04.120
 Do you think for for an athlete and you just let's let's stick to grappling

1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:08.440
 All right, do you think strike strength is helpful or detrimental?

1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:10.920
 I've always believed that

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:12.920
 two things will

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.560
 create whatever

1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:21.400
 Whatever effectiveness you have in grappling those are your skill set and your attributes

1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:24.920
 And the best athletes are those who excel in both

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:26.840
 um

1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:29.640
 Don't kid yourself if someone gets twice as strong

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.480
 By some kind of magic potion, they're going to be a more effective grappler if someone gets

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:44.440
 Twice the level of endurance that they had previously. They will be a more effective grappler. These physical attributes have a very important outcome

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.440
 on the

1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:49.240
 Sorry a very important effect upon the outcome of matches

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:54.120
 Um, it's always a good thing to be stronger. It's always a good thing to have better endurance

1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:58.600
 It's always a good thing to have better balance or whatever other attribute you throw out there

1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:00.120
 um

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:06.360
 Gordon's point was okay. Everyone agrees on that, but there's a problem in order to build these things

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:11.400
 You have to carve into other elements of your training regimen

1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:16.920
 And then it becomes well, which becomes more important increases in strength or increases in skill

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000
 There comes a point where

1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:24.840
 Investing in strength training starts to get diminishing returns

1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:32.520
 I can't tell the difference between someone who bench presses 300 pounds on the mat versus someone who bench presses 400 pounds

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:35.400
 But that's a big difference. That's a hundred pound difference

1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:41.800
 And for an athlete to go from bench pressing 300 pounds to 400 pounds that would require a great deal of

1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:44.520
 of training effort and focus

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:48.200
 But if I can't tell the difference when I grapple and then why bother?

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:50.600
 Okay, once you get to a certain strength level

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:56.280
 Or it doesn't really help that much to go from a 400 pound bench press to a 450 pound bench press

1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:01.160
 If that's the stage you you're really getting a diminishing in returns on your training investment

1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:02.440
 um

1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:04.440
 Now skills on the other hand

1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:12.200
 Experience far far less in terms of diminishing returns every new skill you develop

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000
 can translate

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.480
 Very very well into big increases in performance

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:22.440
 Look at the example of gary tonan that we talked about earlier investments and guillotine

1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:25.320
 made a significant improvement in his

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:29.720
 Effectiveness in matches and led directly to some of his most important victories

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:31.880
 um

1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:34.520
 But if he had invested the same amount of training time and

1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:41.880
 Developing a bench press that was 25 pounds more than previously that would have had no outcome no influence on the outcome of those matches

1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:47.000
 So the question always becomes. Yep. Everyone acknowledges that these physical

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:54.600
 Uh attributes are important and everyone understands that becoming stronger or fitter is a desirable thing

1:03:54.680 --> 1:04:01.160
 And every athlete should work on them. The interesting question becomes. Okay. At what point do you start to say?

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:04.600
 I'm not going to be helped by further increases

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.200
 in in strength training or endurance training

1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:09.720
 um

1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:15.160
 And my point with my athletes is in the overwhelming majority of cases

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:21.560
 If there's any kind of doubt invest more heavily in skill training than attribute training

1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:24.440
 Especially once you get to a certain level on the attributes

1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:30.280
 Well, the interesting thing that I think you should account for with strength training is um

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:33.640
 There's instagram

1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:37.240
 There's the world it's uh, it seems to be more fun

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:39.240
 to build muscle mass

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:46.600
 Um, it's an addiction that people have. There's also economic elements too. Like most people I hate to say this, but it's true

1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:49.720
 most people are more concerned with image

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:52.360
 than function and

1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:53.800
 uh

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:55.800
 It's hard to sell

1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:03.720
 A fighter or a jiu jitsu athlete who doesn't look like one looks like fader. Yeah, it's a tough sell now

1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:09.480
 You can do it in fighting and and jiu jitsu because ultimately it's about whose hand is raised at the end of the match

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:14.040
 And you can even use it as a selling point. You can be a guy that doesn't look like you should be winning

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:18.360
 But he is winning that is a selling point. But if you give most people a choice between

1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:24.040
 Looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger and winning matches versus looking like fader and winning matches

1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:27.560
 Most people will select. I wish I'd rather look like Arnold Schwarzenegger

1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:35.400
 And so most athletes feel almost like an economic compulsion to be in good shape and in order to advance their marketability

1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:41.240
 Yeah, Nike's not going to sponsor fader or tank Abbott. Yeah tank Abbott

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:42.840
 No

1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:44.600
 fader or maybe

1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:48.360
 But yeah, yeah, we need at the very top. There's there's something about uh, aesthetic

1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:53.080
 Like image of strength and power. It's also and also a

1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:58.360
 Personal thing if you look at yourself in the mirror, do you like what what you see? You know what I mean?

1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:02.600
 Yeah, you find yourself attractive, you know, what what can you do to make you look better?

1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:06.040
 You know, I think to me to me it was something one of the reasons I work out

1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:11.160
 It's also for for that. Well, I'm sure fader looks in the mirror. He says I look damn good today

1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:17.640
 Yeah, you couldn't be too. It's also a genetic factor. Some people, you know, it's harder for them. I mean, yeah

1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:23.560
 All right. So the question on training you guys John Gordon trained

1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:26.600
 often three times a day every day

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.720
 um, Georgia had a different

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:32.600
 like um

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:38.440
 A different approach to training. So like what is uh, for for no, I don't mean that in the kind of the opposite or something

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:40.760
 It's just not every single day. So

1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:43.880
 And obviously you are

1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:46.440
 Legitimately at the very top

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:51.880
 Uh, in terms of performance accomplishment in the field. So what have you learned about?

1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:59.240
 What it takes to train to become not just the lead but the best well, I I um

1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:04.280
 A lot of people when you say train they they see training hard

1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:07.000
 I believe you need to be very constant

1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:13.640
 Uh, and uh, very disciplined you need to train but you don't need to train hard every day

1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:16.680
 That's what John taught me. Um

1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:23.320
 For me, it's the nervous system. Sometimes I feel if I load it up too much. It comes to a point that you're

1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:28.280
 It's too much. There is no no more information that I can absorb

1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:31.080
 so

1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:37.400
 And I do believe that it's something that you can train to your the capacity your capacity of being able to learn of

1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:39.640
 absorbing certain thing

1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:45.800
 And uh, I did a lot of volume of training, but when I when I was getting ready for a fight

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:48.200
 Especially during sparring day

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:53.160
 I like to do it quick because my when I fight it's five round of five minute

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:55.800
 I don't like to to spend

1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:01.880
 Uh an hour or two hours in a gym because

1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:05.080
 I need to know how hard I can be

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:11.560
 Going for 25 minute, you know when I not for two hours for 25 minute and at my last fight

1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:14.680
 John and I we we we

1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:17.880
 We were thinking of how could we

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:21.160
 Make me more

1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:24.280
 Of a better finisher, you know more apportiveness

1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:30.520
 And then John, I remember we when we were training with gordon jake shill came gary tonan

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:35.240
 My round of grappling were different than if I would be training for

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:42.440
 Abu Dhabi, you know for for a bi or like some like in grappling the round or longer, but

1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:45.560
 In a mixed martial arts fight

1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:49.400
 It's very rare that you're gonna spend more than

1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:52.040
 four minute or

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:56.600
 Four minutes and a half on the ground. It's it's very unlikely. I mean it could and can happen, but so

1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:03.080
 I remember we did the round three minute we did all the round I was doing were three minute round

1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:05.400
 So it gives a different

1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:09.960
 Uh rhythm to the training. It forced me to be more opportunist

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:15.000
 To be more of a finisher because I had only three minutes to to do what I needed to do

1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:18.680
 So if I if I see something I need to to go for the kill right away

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:21.400
 I cannot be too over patient, you know what I mean

1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:27.400
 And it it serves me well in my last fight and I think it that's a good blueprint to follow

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:31.400
 um, when you're a mixed martial arts fighter, I if I would if

1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:34.840
 The result was great and I think

1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:40.920
 It maybe I should have done that before it was a great great idea that we had not to do

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:43.640
 Um, be very careful on doing too much volume

1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:48.520
 Yes, try to get out and then try to focus on finishing and getting getting out

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:53.720
 I mean to be to build up your foundation. I believe you need a lot of volume

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:58.120
 But when you get ready for competition, you need some to be something that

1:09:59.000 --> 1:09:59.640
 replicate

1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:03.640
 What you're gonna be facing. What are we talking about? What do you think?

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.440
 Like is there a rest days five days a week?

1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:13.480
 Twice a day once a day. Is there any one formula like that or no this this I don't I do not believe in overtraining

1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:15.560
 I believe in under rest

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.560
 I believe

1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:22.200
 You can be under rest and people

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:28.760
 Always link that immediately to the volume of their how much volume they they train

1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:34.680
 Which it could be something else. How are you feeling emotionally? Are you are you having?

1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:43.560
 Problems personal problem. Do you have a have a hard time sleeping because you have a like someone died or I don't know like

1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:47.640
 You you hold money. You're broke or what like, you know, I mean could be anything

1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:52.760
 There is something that can affect you psychologically or emotionally

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:59.480
 That made it in a way that you cannot sleep well because your your stress your cortisol level is high

1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:04.440
 Your you know what? I mean all these factors need to be take taken into consideration

1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:07.400
 It's not only about the volume of training people

1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:11.880
 Always think the volume of the training is the only thing

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.880
 That can affect

1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:21.400
 Recuperation, which is not you know, yeah, I said to minimize the amount of stress from all kinds of factors. It's a very stressful job to be a

1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:23.640
 professional

1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:30.200
 Combat athlete, whether you're a grappler a boxer a kickboxer a fighter and you need to be taking

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000
 As a into account

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:35.960
 Is it more or less stressful than marriage just kidding?

1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.320
 Next question

1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:41.320
 Um

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:46.840
 So I don't know how to ask this question given what George just said, but you're training three times a day

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:55.720
 And finishing and what what have you learned about what what brings out the best in you as as the elite level grappler

1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:59.400
 um, so over the recent years have actually changed it up a little bit

1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.880
 um when I was

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:04.760
 Coming up through from white to black belt

1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:11.080
 Uh, I felt that the volume was the most important. So it would be anywhere from like three

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:13.960
 to seven sessions a day

1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:15.320
 um

1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:21.640
 Going from school to school from New York to New Jersey. Um, and I think that the volume was very important to build the skills

1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:23.320
 um

1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:24.760
 where I just

1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:29.800
 Didn't know how to move my body at purple belt the way that I should um, so I think that building the skills

1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:34.520
 Is uh, it's super important. I think that early on volume is very important

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.880
 Uh, now that I already have the skills built. I think that acquiring more knowledge is the most important

1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.520
 Um, so I find that if I do

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:46.120
 So many sessions a day like if I do three sessions a day

1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:48.600
 Um, I feel sometimes by the third session

1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:53.720
 I'm just like so mentally like there's just there's so much information that's went through my head

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.480
 The first two sessions that I feel like I'm not even there mentally on the third session

1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:01.000
 Um, so I feel like doing less volume now

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:07.080
 But having more mental clarity per session is more important because I already have the foundational skills acquired

1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:10.440
 So a lot of your training is almost like

1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:16.840
 Just thinking like learning a lot of it. Yeah, so I'll do like I mean our schedule has been messed up

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.640
 Since the pandemic because henzo's got shut down and then we're using a french gym in Puerto Rico

1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:24.760
 And now we're using a french gym in our and in austin

1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:29.400
 Um, but once we have our own school we'll have a setup schedule where I can pretty much just be there all day long

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:33.640
 Um, but right now I do like a lifting session in the morning and then I'll come in and help teach

1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:40.120
 At henzo's so I'm there mentally. I'm seeing what's going on and I'm playing around with ideas in my head

1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:44.520
 Uh, and then I'm there physically and very sharp mentally for the competition class

1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:50.120
 During the 1 p.m. Session and then after that I'll go home. I'll rest and get ready for the next day

1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:52.120
 So

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:58.840
 What have you learned on seeing all these different athletes is there a a universal rule that applies or is it

1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:01.640
 athlete specific

1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:08.040
 First one thing that needs to be addressed is that george and gordon play very different sports with very different athletic demands

1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:12.920
 Um, gordon can be in matches that range from anywhere from six

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:15.960
 Minutes to literally hours long

1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:18.520
 um as a result

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.520
 Uh, the overall

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:24.440
 pacing and intensity of matches is massively different

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:28.040
 Most obviously there is no striking in gordon's sport

1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:36.280
 Striking by its very nature is a much more explosive physical action than grappling is grappling is primarily an isometric

1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:40.360
 Kind of sport based around isometric tension and endurance

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.920
 um, george's sport is

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:49.240
 It does feature a significant amount of isometric tension, but the majority of it is based around

1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:53.400
 So the physical demands of the two sports are radically different

1:14:54.040 --> 1:15:00.440
 In addition, the time of application is is radically different george raised a very interesting point

1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:03.960
 His match is seen long 25 minutes for a championship match

1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.600
 um, but always understand that

1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:09.880
 it makes martial arts fight

1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:11.800
 at championship level

1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:13.800
 If it goes the distance is really

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.760
 five five minute matches

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.840
 each round

1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:21.640
 Is a match in itself and that's exactly how you're scored

1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:25.400
 You're scored by who wins the most matches over five matches

1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:33.880
 As a result the application of the techniques, especially the grappling techniques has to be done at a certain pace as george pointed out

1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:35.720
 realistically

1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:39.880
 The maximum application time you're going to get in most situations is somewhere between

1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:41.880
 15

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:44.120
 Seconds and three minutes

1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:49.640
 Even for a specialized grappler like damien mayer there's still a significant part of each round which is

1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:53.880
 Spent in setup time to actually get the match to the ground

1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:55.240
 um

1:15:55.240 --> 1:16:00.920
 It's very likely that at some point your opponent will stand up out of grappling and you have to re initiate the entire process again

1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:07.560
 So that even for specialized grapplers you might be spending only three minutes out of a five minute round

1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:10.120
 Uh on the ground

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:14.840
 And as a result you got to get your work done in a very short time frame

1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:16.920
 uh, gordon ryan

1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:20.600
 Once it goes to the ground and it can go to the ground because he chooses to sit to the ground

1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:25.160
 Uh, we may spend the entire match in ground positions

1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:27.480
 um

1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:33.960
 As a result the matches have completely different pacing and completely different physical demands and the preparation that the two athletes go through

1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:36.280
 will reflect that

1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:42.200
 If george st. Pierre in training for mixed martial arts becomes fatigued to a point

1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:50.120
 Where he's no longer physically effective and able to defend himself the consequences for that in MMA training can be very deep and deep

1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:57.400
 Okay, if you make a mistake in mixed martial arts because you're fatigued and tired and you take a full power roundhouse kick to the head

1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:00.280
 That's some deep consequences

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:05.720
 A grappler doesn't have to face that you can be completely exhausted in grappling and just sit in the bottom of the mountain

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:11.480
 Just practice just survival skills. We just don't get submitted from bottom out and that can still be an effective training session

1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:15.640
 complete an art of physical breakdown and fatigue can be

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:24.600
 Can end an athlete's career and mixed martial arts the consequences of training through fatigue and MMA are

1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:27.480
 potentially very deep and very disturbing

1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:28.760
 um

1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:34.120
 The consequences of training through complete physical exhaustion and grappling aren't really that severe

1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:36.680
 Okay, you just tap whenever there's a problem just tap

1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:38.360
 um

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:42.280
 And so they're very very different sports in the way you you prepare for them

1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:43.960
 um

1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:45.960
 and a grappling

1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:47.960
 athlete like gordon ryan we can take

1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:54.680
 Many more liberties with physical exhaustion and the amount of hours a day you spend in training

1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:57.960
 Then you could with a mixed martial arts athlete like actually be a benefit

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:00.680
 exhaustion as a

1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:05.160
 As a framework of learning so like from a place of exhaustion

1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:11.160
 Is there any benefit to they you want the you said being at the bottom of mouth sort of understanding

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:19.320
 Jijitsu grappling somehow deeper because you're physically absolutely absolutely because then the only thing you have left in your favor

1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:23.160
 Is your technique and then you'll see how technical you are in addition

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:28.280
 You'll get to explore realms inside your mind that we don't spend a lot of time in

1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:32.520
 And and you'll learn a lot about yourself and your ability to endure which will

1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:34.680
 have

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:41.080
 Potentially great benefits in similar situations and matches. Yeah, there's uh, I mean for me for a recreational person

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:43.800
 Getting

1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:48.600
 Exhaustion allows you the great benefit to experience what it feels like to really get dominated

1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:52.360
 At an even greater frequency than you otherwise would

1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:57.160
 And there's something there. There's some animalistic thing that's very unpleasant

1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:00.760
 And then afterwards it takes you to a nice to a place of

1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:02.760
 like

1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:04.520
 humility and

1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:07.160
 I don't you get it forces you to rethink life

1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:09.720
 In positive ways

1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.720
 There's something about dominance

1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:14.440
 It can mean if you get dominated a few times you can

1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:17.880
 Rationalize it somehow you say, okay

1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:19.320
 Well, I screwed this up

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:25.960
 But when you're exhausted and you have to do like 30 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour of just being dominated over and over and over

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.960
 and over being submitted

1:19:28.040 --> 1:19:30.920
 It uh, I don't know. It's it's a very good process for

1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:36.920
 For other avenues of life. I find it's I can't explain why because I'm

1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:38.840
 I'm

1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:44.040
 Driving home crying afterwards listening to Bruce Springsteen, but afterwards

1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:47.000
 Yeah, this

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:53.240
 Afterwards somehow you can think clear you can see clear about what is the right path through life in all walks of life

1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:57.080
 Like relationships work, but also the grappling

1:19:57.720 --> 1:20:00.280
 Actually, the grappling is the hardest one to see what you have to do

1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:05.880
 It clarifies other avenues the humility. It's the it removes the bullshit

1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:08.760
 It's like we see

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:13.640
 The world through some kind of fog and it just removes it and now you can see things clearly

1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:15.320
 I don't know what that is

1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:19.240
 I think I think it's important like you mentioned to push yourself like sometimes

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:24.120
 To see how far you can go because sometimes you you can go further than

1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:27.080
 Then where you think and it can boost your confidence

1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:29.640
 You know, you can push yourself through a certain limit

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:34.760
 And maybe you thought your limit were was before that point and you pushed through it

1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:37.560
 But like John just mentioned

1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:40.280
 It's a risky thing to do in

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:44.440
 Striking because if you're exhausted you're gonna get brain damage

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:50.600
 And grappling it's you know, you tap if something wrong, but you can do it also in strength conditioning

1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:53.560
 I like to run track. I do it all the time and track and feel

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:56.200
 It it helps me to

1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:00.520
 To to know myself better. I think it's important. It's a it's a good point

1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:05.720
 It's like it's like the scrimmage wrestling rounds we do. It's like, you know, if you stop moving

1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:11.240
 That you're gonna get scored on and you know in your mind like there's no mechanical reason

1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:14.040
 And why I am why I should give up a score here

1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:19.480
 But you're so exhausted that you're like, oh man, this is terrible. If I if I stop moving, I'm a pussy

1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:22.680
 If I don't stop move if I don't stop moving

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:24.840
 I'm gonna be twice as exhausted when we actually do stand up

1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:27.800
 So it's it's an interesting game you have to play inside your mind

1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:30.440
 It's it's your pride very often that that

1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:33.240
 Keep you that keep you

1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:39.960
 Sharp, you know what I mean because you just want to lay down and beat it because you're completely exhausted, you know

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:46.120
 What do you think is the connection John between this ego pride thing?

1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:50.040
 martial arts and actual violence in our

1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:52.600
 With our ancestors. Do you think

1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:59.400
 Yeah, you ever plug into that you think there's echoes of something going on there or like you you mentioned you have flaws and demons

1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:04.040
 Is it deep in there somewhere? Do you think we're struggling with those demons?

1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:10.680
 Yeah, you'll need to patch up your question or what though it's going on several different directions. Wow, that was

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.000
 Not only might be dominating just I mean dominating interviewing

1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:17.080
 No, no, no, no, I'm not

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:20.600
 It's the other scene where they're like, okay now we interview you

1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:23.400
 But you you went down the evolution

1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:26.200
 I mean, do you think

1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:27.720
 Do you um

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:31.400
 I don't mean just the line between what is what is martial arts and what is violence?

1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:39.560
 I mean, there there seems to be a gray area that connects us to the the evolutionary ancestors. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I mean

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:41.960
 I think there's a deep

1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:44.360
 recognition and all of us that

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.840
 um, and this is

1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:51.880
 The evidence for this is is so easy to uh to see in in in daily life

1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:54.120
 um

1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:59.560
 If you're walking down the street and suddenly you hear a commotion and two people are fighting

1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:01.560
 You will see

1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:07.320
 Literally everyone on that street stop whatever they're doing and watch the fight

1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.600
 Humans are fascinated by violence

1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:21.800
 And you've got to ask yourself why and of course it's a recognition that for a significant part of our evolutionary history

1:23:22.680 --> 1:23:27.560
 Violence was one of the most important elements in human existence

1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:34.600
 Human existence as much as we curse it as much as we talk badly of it

1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:43.000
 The juxtaposition between humans social nature and their their need to for each other to get along and to express

1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:46.920
 love amongst the the the various members of a given community

1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:49.800
 there are

1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:52.920
 Disputes between humans that can't be resolved and ultimately

1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:56.680
 Throughout history violence has been the number one method of

1:23:57.960 --> 1:23:59.960
 conflict resolution

1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:04.840
 For better or for worse, and there's a recognition in all of us that

1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:07.960
 This is where we come from

1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:09.960
 and there's a reason why

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:12.360
 Combat sports have this

1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:13.720
 thing where

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:18.840
 People will watch them and they might even be repulsed by them, but they find it difficult to take their eyes from it

1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:22.840
 and um uh

1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:26.840
 I do believe that most combat athletes carry that sense

1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:29.160
 of their

1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:32.840
 Even if it's on a subconscious level this kind of belief that

1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:40.280
 This is who we are. Um, george you used the word pride and I believe that's a big part of it. I believe that

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000
 um

1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:44.840
 most

1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:48.840
 Humans have this sense of self worth and pride which they're willing to fight for

1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:52.920
 And uh, if it gets crossed by someone else, they're willing to stand

1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:57.160
 Some people will stand more early and some people could be pushed further back

1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:01.240
 But everyone's got that line beyond which they won't be pushed

1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:06.520
 And there's some kind of deep recognition in all of us that we have that somewhere within us

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:12.760
 No matter how hard we try to bury it or what have you and that's why I believe there will always be this eternal

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:14.760
 Interest in combat sports

1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:17.320
 um

1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:18.440
 Now

1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:24.600
 I don't believe that most people today have any kind of respect for unrestricted violence or

1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.320
 non consensual violence

1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:31.880
 um, I think most people most good people are repulsed by that and I'm I'm

1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:34.520
 I'm sure that as humanity

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.040
 Improves out into the future that will become more and more widespread

1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:40.200
 but

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.560
 That's not to say we we can't exercise these these

1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:47.960
 old evolutionary demons inside of us and um

1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:57.240
 And sometimes there are just disputes between different people different cultures different nations where ultimately it's going to come to

1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:01.880
 Into into a shoving match and that will degenerate further into violence

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:05.640
 there's always going to be a need for humans to be able to

1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:07.640
 to

1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:09.640
 express themselves

1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.680
 Through violent methods and to use physical force to get to their their goals and objectives

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:18.520
 Our

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.960
 Our need as humans is always to find a balance between

1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:26.280
 The two forces of conflict and cooperation

1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:29.960
 We need cooperation because humans isolated from each other

1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:32.600
 more or less helpless and useless

1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:35.400
 in order to advance

1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:37.960
 human communities need to build and grow

1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:40.520
 And so that sense of cooperation

1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:43.320
 Because in most of our daily lives

1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:45.960
 But there will also be

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:53.000
 Irresolvable conflicts where physical force has to be used to to form a resolution and so most human beings find themselves

1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:56.600
 Swinging like a pendulum between conflict and cooperation

1:26:57.320 --> 1:26:59.320
 and um

1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:01.480
 And that is something which

1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:05.960
 Really gives birth I think to combat sports because sorry

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:09.880
 I really have to ask you about this then. There's a guy even Harvard

1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:16.360
 Uh named Richard Rangham, and there's a lot of people that believe this. He wrote this book that um

1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:21.960
 Basically, there's a lot of people studying is what happened. How do we get from apes to humans?

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:27.240
 Like what was the magic thing right a lot of people attributed to fire and ability to cook meat

1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:30.040
 There's a lot of different theories

1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:32.360
 So he actually um

1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:34.360
 Um

1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:36.360
 His theory

1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:39.960
 How do I describe this is basically that that the beta males one

1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:46.120
 That the the the the apes that were able to cooperate

1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:51.800
 So you though the way you develop cooperation is that there's a big bad leader

1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:55.080
 That uh, the the alpha male

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.960
 that you can only

1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:05.560
 Um knock off their throne if you cooperate and so we built big tribes that just excelled the cooperation

1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:11.560
 By practicing the overthrowing the leader and so and any time an alpha male would rise up

1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:16.840
 They would get we would uh develop our skill further and further of cooperation

1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:19.640
 And so we're all just beta males

1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:25.000
 The descendants of beta males that says uh kind of theory that cooperation is fundamental

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:30.280
 And it's so distinct to the the rest of the neighboring animal kingdom

1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:37.960
 So I wonder what you think about this tension of violence of cooperation and how important is this cooperation to the core of

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:43.960
 Yeah, uh, if you you can look at it in the uh, in a given training room, um

1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:50.920
 Jiu Jitsu and mixed martial arts is solo sports a solo athlete steps into the cage or steps onto the mat

1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:57.400
 But all of your preparation is done in a cooperative training environment with many peers and

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:00.840
 Uh, as much as it's an individual sport

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:04.680
 All of your preparation is done in as part of a group

1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:07.320
 um

1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:14.040
 There's a sense in which uh, that's an interesting metaphor for humanity itself everything we do in life

1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:18.680
 We do alone, but we grow up in this given community and in what have you

1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:20.680
 Um

1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:27.160
 With regards to the the whole alpha male beta male thing, um

1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:32.760
 Humans are it's true. This fella's correct. We you know, most

1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:41.240
 primates do have very strongly defined alpha males who rule the roost and determine the entire direction of the um

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:44.040
 uh of of

1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:47.320
 The community they they build around themselves

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:49.320
 Um

1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:51.480
 Humans on the other hand

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:58.680
 Don't have an alpha male in that strict biological sense of someone who's responsible for the next generation

1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:00.680
 dominates all the

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:06.600
 Female population etc. Yeah, physically dominates, but we do on the other hand have our own

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.080
 Version of alpha males and so far as we have political and sociological leaders

1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:16.440
 Who have a disproportionate impact on the direction of a of a community?

1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:18.440
 Um

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:21.480
 So was the cooperation allowed us to

1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:29.720
 To have a greater scale of hierarchy with the alpha male on top or the alpha creature on top. Yeah. Yeah

1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:32.280
 Now that's a fascinating theory

1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:37.560
 In in nature were were very weak as a species

1:30:37.640 --> 1:30:43.000
 So we needed to cooperate in order to to evolve that I think

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:48.360
 Made us uh the the top of the food chain if you look at um

1:30:49.800 --> 1:30:51.800
 Humanity in in nature

1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:54.520
 Really the two things that seem to

1:30:56.520 --> 1:31:00.920
 More than anything else determine whether or not a given human community will be

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:05.720
 Successful in a predatory world on numbers and technology

1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:12.040
 Okay, the more your numbers increase in the the higher the technology of the weapons and support systems

1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:15.080
 You have around you the more successful you'll be in a predatory world

1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:16.920
 um

1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:23.560
 So it's not clear that just killing off the idea of an alpha male was the the the single biggest thing

1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:25.000
 um

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:27.000
 The rise of technology

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000
 Uh in the growth of community

1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:32.360
 After the imposition of language these are other things that would have been

1:31:32.920 --> 1:31:35.800
 Very very important factors and in humanities rise

1:31:36.280 --> 1:31:38.840
 George you made an interesting point if you look at humans

1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:42.680
 Just the raw material of humans. We're we're we're fucking pathetic

1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:48.360
 And in a predatory animal kingdom. We're just the absolute bottom of the food chain

1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:50.920
 um, we don't have a single

1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:52.840
 effective

1:31:52.840 --> 1:31:56.120
 Weapon other than better than average endurance. That's about it

1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:57.720
 um

1:31:57.720 --> 1:32:02.760
 But you put us in a community who can talk to each other with language and give us the time

1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:07.480
 To come up with technological advances such as metals

1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:09.480
 Um, and suddenly a human

1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:11.480
 will go from

1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:18.440
 No combat effectiveness in the animal kingdom to a a human armed with a simple metal tip spear can kill

1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:23.480
 Damn, they're any animal in the uh in the animal kingdom and working as a group

1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:26.440
 I'll beat your silver back. You know our

1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:32.120
 I'll fight him in a deep water pool because he cannot swim. So I don't have to touch him

1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:38.680
 He'll drown and I can't get him into the pool. You know why because someone told me because we live in a community

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:42.840
 Someone told me that information. So I know he passed it on to me. Yeah

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:44.760
 He taught you

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:49.800
 Well, you have to convince him to you have to somehow convince him to join you in the pool, which is very difficult

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:53.000
 It's a very problem very very difficult

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:55.480
 um

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:59.160
 From a technical perspective john you've looked at

1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:04.920
 That makes martial arts fighting in general and grappling. What's the difference between fighting and grappling?

1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:07.480
 That's something I'd love to

1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:13.960
 Ask all of you. Maybe john you can start like. Um, well, uh, when you talk about fighting you mean unrestricted

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:21.240
 Uh, mma top type fighting. Yeah, well, this is fun. You said unrestricted mma type fight mma type fighting

1:33:21.320 --> 1:33:27.320
 So there's there's the street fighting. Yep. Yeah, there's mma fighting and then there's grappling

1:33:27.320 --> 1:33:31.960
 It's really the sport of grappling. You're saying, okay. What's the difference between mma and grappling? Yes, okay

1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:38.200
 Um, see that would have been a much better question to ask. Um, well the uh, uh, the single

1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.360
 When you talk about grappling you're talking about juditsu rules or yeah

1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:45.960
 I mean, you could maybe also mention different rule sets that somehow fundamentally

1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:51.320
 Challenged that changed the sport. You know, um in the sport of mixed martial arts

1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:53.160
 uh

1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:55.160
 you've got two

1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:01.160
 Ways to inflict damage on the human body. You've you've got kinetic energy which is done through striking

1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:03.960
 kicking knees elbows fists

1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:07.160
 and you've got

1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:10.200
 Isometric tension used along the lines of

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:12.840
 lever and fulcrum

1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:15.800
 Which can be used for strangulation and and joint breaking

1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:17.720
 Um

1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:22.360
 In grappling you lose one of those you're no longer allowed to hurt your opponent with kinetic energy

1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:25.240
 You can do it accidentally through a throw, but you're not allowed to just

1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:29.880
 You know knock someone out with a throw in most grappling sports that it can happen

1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:33.240
 But it's relatively rare and it's it's not encouraged by the rule set

1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:35.880
 so um, I work with um

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:39.640
 Yeah, you got close

1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:42.200
 So

1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:49.960
 There's a sense in which in mixed martial arts you've got twice as many problems to deal with and um, uh, and they occur in

1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:51.400
 a

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:57.480
 Much shorter time frame the single biggest difference between grappling technique as a weapon

1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:01.160
 In human combat versus striking technique is time

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.000
 Grappling technique takes a huge amount of time to apply

1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:10.680
 Okay, the great advantage of grappling technique is certainty of outcome once you get there

1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:15.320
 It takes a huge amount of time to set up a takedown

1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:18.200
 Physically take them down

1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:21.720
 Work their way work your way towards a dominant position

1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:28.520
 culminating in your opponent's back and then apply a stranglehold. That's a long chain of events as opposed to

1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:37.000
 A strong punch or kick which can take a quarter of a second then application from start to finish and the match is over

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:39.240
 um

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:41.400
 and so there's a sense in which

1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:44.280
 uh grappling is

1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:46.600
 it's

1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.560
 It's fighting for the patient and the calculating

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:53.320
 Whereas striking is much more for

1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:59.000
 In this short time frame where everything gets done and in the blink of an eye

1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:05.400
 There's a sense also which grappling is a much more forgiving sport. You can make a terrible mistake

1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:09.560
 End up in a terrible position and still fight your way out and win

1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:15.800
 In mixed martial arts, it's much much less forgiving

1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:19.800
 If you get hit and stunned your chances of recovery

1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:24.440
 Uh minimal you're going to get swarmed on and unless it's right at the end of the round

1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:28.680
 You it's very very hard to recover from getting hit and swarmed on

1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.000
 um

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000
 So there's a sense in which

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.960
 The biggest difference between them is time of application of technique

1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:41.000
 Uh in mixed martial arts, it's incredibly unforgiving in terms of time

1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:44.280
 Even the smallest error can have the deepest consequences

1:36:44.840 --> 1:36:48.280
 In grappling you can make massive errors and still come back and win

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:49.800
 um

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.800
 grappling will typically be one

1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:57.800
 In a much higher percentage case by the more skilled and conditioned grappler

1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:00.280
 whereas there is

1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:03.080
 Much more of what they call a punches chance

1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:05.320
 In mixed martial arts where

1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:09.160
 There's a much higher likelihood of a lesser athlete

1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:15.960
 Defeating a greater athlete in MMA than there is in grappling simply because of time of application of the techniques

1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:21.080
 Even the smallest period of inattention in MMA and the match is over

1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:23.800
 Gordon Ryan could fall asleep for 30 seconds

1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:29.400
 Have his opponent mounted on and wake up and finish him in five minutes later. That's not going to happen in MMA

1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:33.160
 Okay, so the the stakes are much higher

1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:38.920
 You can do a lot of damage in very small amount of time and just the dynamic the temple dynamics of how things happen is very different

1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:41.400
 Everything you'll see will be a reflection of that

1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:44.120
 Then you go further into things like rule sets

1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:49.320
 In the sport of grappling if Gordon Ryan comes out and sits down in the middle of the mat

1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:53.560
 His opponent must follow him to the ground and engage

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:58.520
 In mixed martial arts, if you come to the center of the cage and sit down

1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:02.520
 The other guy can just walk away from you. They're completely

1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:06.040
 Oriented in different directions grappling is ground centered

1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:13.480
 MMA is typically standing centered at the beginning of every round you have to start standing again if I disengage from

1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:19.800
 A ground grappling situation stand up and walk away from my opponent. My opponent must follow me up to the feet

1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:25.720
 In grappling, it's the exact opposite if I sit to the ground my opponent must follow me to the ground

1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:31.640
 It's written into the rule set and so one is inherently ground oriented and one is inherently standing oriented

1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:35.960
 So it's more it's more difficult to dictate where the fight happens in mixed martial arts

1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:40.920
 Yes, you have to be able to impose where the fight is whereas in grappling you can simply choose it

1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:46.920
 So george, what is your sense of the the difference in terms of how you approached it?

1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:54.920
 Uh between the two sports. So you also are a student of wrestling and grappling. So in preparing for fights

1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:00.840
 What parts of grappling purely the sport that you have to leave behind?

1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:03.720
 Well, I uh

1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:08.760
 I'm very lucky. I had the opportunity to I train with I consider the best

1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:11.400
 mentor trainer I ever ever had

1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:13.800
 and I have

1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:19.640
 Some of the best grapplers that I can train with they were they were there to help me through my career

1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:22.360
 so

1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:24.360
 for my training is

1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:30.440
 Of course because I do not dedicate as much time in one specific area. It's hard to be

1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:36.600
 You know a world class athlete and that in in only one particular area always

1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:39.000
 for me

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:46.040
 Like the idea to be more well rounded to be very competent in every of those areas striking grappling

1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:50.760
 takedowns and and all all those areas then being just

1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:53.400
 very good at one

1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:58.760
 and not as good as as others, you know, because I like the idea that

1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:03.800
 It gives me more option when I fight someone I can

1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:10.760
 Mold myself to become the perfect nemesis to that person better if I'm more well rounded

1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:13.960
 If I do not have those well rounded skill

1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:17.480
 And I don't have that option, you know

1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:23.000
 You have less tools to work with less technology. What about you, Gordon? What um

1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:29.080
 You know, what do you think is very distinct about grappling in the way you approach it versus fighting?

1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:35.960
 I think most of it was covered, but I think that though the one one of the big things is the fact that when you're looking at MMA

1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:43.080
 You have a pretty general agreed upon and unified rule set where if you look at UFC versus Bellator

1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:45.720
 They're they have slight differences in the rules. Maybe

1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:48.440
 But it's pretty much the same thing

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:54.360
 Whereas in grappling you have EBI rules and you have ADCC rules. You have IBGF rules. You have no time limit rules

1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:56.040
 and

1:40:56.040 --> 1:40:59.640
 Each rule set will play to the skills of different athletes

1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:02.600
 If you have if you do ADCC rules

1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:07.480
 It generally is slightly biased towards wrestlers or if they can stall to the overtime

1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:13.000
 And then hit a takedown in the overtime and not really do any jiu jitsu, but they score a takedown

1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:16.120
 They're going to win whereas if you have like an EBI, for example

1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:22.680
 You have to finish the guy in regulation or you start in a jiu jitsu position with your back taken or in an arm bar

1:41:23.400 --> 1:41:25.400
 so I think that you have

1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:30.920
 certain rule sets that play in the favor of certain athletes and

1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:36.440
 Certain athletes can win in one rule set, but then they just have no chance of winning in the other

1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:38.840
 Like when I fought Yuri the first time at EBI

1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:44.680
 I beat him in EBI the chances of me beating him on that night under an ADCC rule set were probably pretty low

1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:48.040
 Um, when I fought Leandra Lowe under an ADCC rule set

1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:53.400
 He beat me that day, but the chances of him beating me in the same day in an EBI rule set were like next to zero

1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:56.040
 Um, uh, so I think it's interesting that

1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:02.600
 In in MMA you have one unified rule set which have small differences, but they're all generally the same

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:07.640
 um, and in jiu jitsu you have a wide variety of different rule sets that um have

1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:13.960
 Uh biases towards uh, certain athlete skill sets. You mentioned Leandra Lowe

1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:17.320
 I gotta ask you again about ADCC

1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:21.880
 You have lost very very few times in your career

1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:29.880
 Uh one I mean, this is the same is true for George and uh, the only person who has ever submitted you is Felipe Pena

1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:32.120
 At black belt. Yeah at black belt

1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:38.520
 He is a DCC world champion multiple time at bjjf gi and no gi world champion

1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:44.680
 You may face him a a dcc or elsewhere in the future. Um, will you beat him?

1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:49.480
 uh, yes, I mean I have to say yes, right um, but uh

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:57.000
 Uh, I fought him initially when I first got my black belt um that I fought him a year later so 2016 and 2017

1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:59.880
 um, and despite what people remember about the match

1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:03.080
 And whenever people talk about it's like, oh, yeah, the guy who strangled gordon

1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:06.680
 But no one remembers that the first match was like a 45 minute war

1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:12.600
 Um, and then the second match with the full 20 minutes of ADCC and if I didn't get my back taken in like the last

1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:17.880
 Minute and a half two minutes it would have went into an overtime. Um, that could change the outcome of the match

1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:19.880
 Um

1:43:20.200 --> 1:43:26.760
 I think that if you look at Felipe's performances, especially no gi specifically no gi since then

1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:30.840
 It looks like he's almost gotten worse. Whereas since that match

1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:33.480
 uh in 2017

1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:39.240
 The only match I lost after that was against vinny. Uh, my galesh by by points and uh,

1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:42.680
 I'm on like a 55 match win streak

1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:49.400
 Um over the course of four years winning all the major tournaments no gi and uh, Felipe since that match

1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:51.560
 I think is like five and two

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:53.240
 No gi

1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:59.320
 And he's lost his last two match matches one was convincingly where he was dominated by andre and one was by submission

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.080
 Um, so I don't think that he's progressed nearly as fast

1:44:03.320 --> 1:44:08.440
 If anything, he looks like he's worse than he was when he beat me in 2017 based on his previous performances

1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:12.200
 Um, that being said, I know he's going to come in training very hard for this one

1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:14.920
 And he's he's going to be prepared but I just don't think

1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:22.680
 That in terms of technical ability, he's anywhere near my level and um, he was much bigger than me

1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:28.440
 Both times we fought um, the first time he was much bigger than me the second time he was one way class above me

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000
 So now there's not going to be an advantage in

1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:37.800
 Technicality and it's also not going to be a physicality advantage. So I think he's just going to be beat everywhere

1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:48.520
 This is uh, this is a good example of the scientific response to a um, to a comment to a to a question. Yeah, so he's not, um

1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:54.360
 That's a match you're you're not deeply concerned with

1:44:54.360 --> 1:45:00.600
 And in terms of the set of opponents because you you have and you will be facing a lot of really difficult

1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:05.880
 Yeah, that's actually in my opinion one of the easier matches because of the fact that we're relatively the same size

1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:10.120
 um, if I show up at 230 pounds like a lot of the guys are

1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:16.840
 260 270 plus so that extra weight does make a difference. I think out of that entire bracket, um

1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:21.400
 Fleet base probably going to be the one of the easiest matches because of the fact that I can easily take him down

1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:27.000
 And if I take him down, I'm going to pass his guard. Whereas I feel like the other guys because they're so much bigger

1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:30.680
 And they're very cagey. Um, it may take me a while to actually

1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:33.240
 Take them to the ground. Um

1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:34.360
 And get on top of them

1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:38.760
 And I think it may be they may be longer drawn out matches because of the fact that they're so much bigger and

1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:42.360
 Stawley, it's hard to take them down, but fleet base relatively my size

1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:44.360
 And uh, his wrestling is atrocious

1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:47.240
 So and I've already taken him down in the last ADCC match

1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:51.000
 So I'm pretty sure I can just easily put him down pass him and then finish him

1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:57.160
 Well, I'm not sure what response I was expecting but uh, that was that was that was phrased beautifully

1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:00.040
 um

1:46:00.440 --> 1:46:06.360
 We talked about the Tiago Alves fight that George had and john barred up in class yesterday

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:13.080
 I believe but the point is we're talking about wrestling and I think that that's a fascinating fight that, um

1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:17.000
 There's an incredible display of strategy of skill of heart

1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:23.320
 Uh, George, could you maybe talk about that fight john? Maybe two what lessons you gained from that fight?

1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:26.600
 Go ahead. It was your fight. No mine

1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:33.560
 Well, oh, maybe it also tell what happened in terms of your injury. I think third round. Oh, yeah

1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:38.680
 um, so I was fighting Tiago Alves and uh in the third round I, um

1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:41.960
 I tear my a doctor muscle

1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:43.080
 um

1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:48.600
 It happened when I was on the bottom and he I think he pushed my knee down tried to pass my guard and I heard a pop

1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:51.320
 I don't know what I think you're going for an armbar

1:46:52.040 --> 1:46:54.440
 You were on his back you switched to armbar and he

1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:58.840
 Cleared the leg by pushing on your leg and you went in with a preexisting injury and at tour

1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:03.960
 Yes, and and it it got worse and and I heard a pop

1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:08.520
 I didn't know what it was, but I know it really hurt. So I came back standing up and

1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:10.600
 there's a

1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:16.840
 Famous video one that goes on the internet about when I go back in the corner and I tell my my coach

1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:21.080
 I'm like, I don't know what it is. I think I tore my my my a doctor muscle and

1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:24.920
 Greg Jackson is like, I don't care hit him with your growing

1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:32.440
 I was very worried because I was in pain, but I didn't I didn't know what what I had

1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:37.560
 So I didn't know the gravity of it and it it plays on your mind

1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:41.560
 So but I had to buy to bite down my mouthpiece and finish the fight

1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:47.240
 You know, I knew I was ahead on the on the scorecard and I need to finish finish strong

1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:51.080
 So what was your strategy there in terms of strikes in terms of wrestling?

1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:55.880
 So he's an exceptionally difficult opponent to take down. Yeah. Well at first

1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:00.840
 I I knew I would add a good jab a good, you know to stay always

1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:07.000
 From the outside, you know fight him from the outside and use my footwork because he was like a tank

1:48:07.080 --> 1:48:09.800
 He was much bigger and much stronger than me

1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:11.960
 and

1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:14.120
 I didn't want never wanted to stay in front of him

1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:19.160
 So he was all the way out or all the way in and when I was coming all the way in it was with my

1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:22.760
 proactive or reactive takedown where I

1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:26.200
 myself initiated the takedown by

1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:32.840
 By using a distraction like a jab to make his his end goes up and then I go with

1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:35.320
 a single double leg

1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:39.960
 Or to react like baiting him for him to come hit me and then

1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:43.480
 While he's coming to hit me I go change level and and

1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:50.920
 That's the way I like to take my opponent down, you know, some guys for example like like cabbie for example, he's very good at

1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:56.280
 At at bringing his opponent to defense and use chain wrestling to to take his opponent down

1:48:56.360 --> 1:48:59.880
 I find it for me for myself. I specialize more into

1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:03.560
 Explosive takedown in the center of the octagon because I found it

1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:06.360
 more economical for me

1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:11.240
 What what did you see you were you're commenting john about the wrestling

1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:19.320
 Those those quite interesting. I mean also, can you generally comment on the fact that George St. Pierre who don't I don't think you wrestled

1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:21.320
 I

1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:25.400
 I started wrestling I was 19 years old, but I resolved some very good russian guys

1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:28.040
 so they took me underneath their wing and but

1:49:29.080 --> 1:49:31.080
 My ability to cover distance

1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:38.440
 Come from karate does not come from wrestling wrestling is how I finish once I get the leg how I finish the takedown

1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:43.160
 So the the timing and the movement and the explosion required for this karate. Yeah

1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:48.680
 I think an important distinction to make here is um one which

1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:50.680
 George

1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:52.760
 made throughout his career and I

1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:55.560
 Believe george you were the greatest innovator in MMA history

1:49:56.760 --> 1:49:58.600
 With regards this

1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:00.600
 and this is

1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:03.560
 The creation of what george calls shootboxing

1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:10.840
 Which is the amalgamation of striking technique in george's case mostly karate because that was his martial arts background

1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:15.240
 Into grappling and in particular takedowns

1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:17.240
 Uh

1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:19.720
 When most people say

1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:23.560
 So and so has better wrestling in mixed martial arts

1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:27.640
 You have to be very careful what they mean by this

1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:30.760
 There are many highly credentialed wrestlers

1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:36.280
 In the early days of mixed martial arts who went in and truly struggled to hit a takedown

1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:42.680
 Now these are very very good wrestlers who in a wrestling match would easily put down their opponent

1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:44.680
 but

1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:50.680
 In a striking situation where the ranges are completely different and the setups are entirely different

1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:56.920
 The stances are different even the the overall conditions are different. You're no longer wearing shoes

1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:01.960
 People underestimate just what an impact it is for a wrestler to take the shoes off

1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:05.560
 You lose like 20 of your forward drives the minute you take off the shoes

1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:07.800
 um

1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:10.280
 All of these make massive differences

1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:15.000
 In whether or not you're going to be able to even make contact with an opponent for a takedown

1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:24.040
 As george pointed out the true value of wrestling in MMA is finishing the takedown once you've established contact

1:51:24.200 --> 1:51:28.600
 But that's only about 20 of the action of a of a mixed martial arts takedown

1:51:28.920 --> 1:51:32.840
 80 of it is an understanding range rhythm setup

1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:35.640
 opportunity etc etc

1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:37.400
 and

1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:42.840
 That's not part of wrestling at all. You're even the overall conditions are completely different in the sport of wrestling

1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:47.720
 You start at very close range in a very bent over stance and you're expected to wrestle for

1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:50.520
 an international size for three minutes at a time

1:51:51.480 --> 1:51:54.280
 um now suddenly you're completely upright

1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:56.440
 uh

1:51:56.440 --> 1:51:57.960
 and

1:51:57.960 --> 1:52:02.360
 You're not wearing shoes all the conditions the the the rhythm and speed of it is different

1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:07.320
 And the counters are completely different. It's just an entirely different animal

1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:10.360
 And so george was an early recognizer of this

1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:15.800
 And started to put the emphasis on direct training for shootboxing

1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:22.600
 In addition to wrestling so he practiced with very good wrestlers in the montreal wrestling club

1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:28.280
 Just the sport of wrestling and that's what made him very good at finishing takedowns

1:52:28.760 --> 1:52:30.760
 But it was in his shootboxing training

1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:38.520
 Which he himself largely developed remember george started at a time when mma was pretty damn young

1:52:39.160 --> 1:52:41.000
 and um

1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.520
 He we were when when you entered the sport of mixed martial arts george

1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:46.840
 It wasn't even allowed on tv

1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:51.000
 Like it was completely banned. It was in his country. It was physically banned

1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:56.680
 They had to fight on indian reservations and I mean this is way back in the wild west days of mma

1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:00.120
 And so as a as a young developing athlete, he had to

1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:03.080
 More or less do this by himself

1:53:03.560 --> 1:53:07.560
 If you ever want to hear some incredible stories talk about teenage george st. Pierre

1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:10.280
 Had a coach who used to make him

1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:12.520
 put on boxing gloves now

1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:19.080
 He was 16 17 years old and just put him on a hardwood floor against a professional boxer who was in his

1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:24.440
 Late 20s at the peak of his career and he said george. You're not allowed to punch

1:53:24.440 --> 1:53:26.760
 You just got to take him down while he tries to knock you out

1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:29.480
 and it was

1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:31.960
 Darwinism he was like

1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:34.360
 It's like you're gonna you're gonna

1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:36.760
 Adapt or you're gonna die

1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:40.360
 Literally and he could have been very bad, but it turns out to be great

1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:43.400
 He's mitted but there's a sensor in which

1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:50.760
 People think oh, you know what determines your takedown ability in mma as your wrestling skill that

1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:58.280
 That your wrestling skill will determine your finishing ability on takedowns, but there's so much more to it than that

1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:02.760
 Um, whenever people say, you know, what what are the broad

1:54:03.480 --> 1:54:07.240
 Elements that determine the outcome of a mixed martial arts fight

1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:11.480
 Okay on the broadest possible level and I always give the same three things

1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:15.480
 The athlete who can dominate the pace

1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:17.880
 of the match

1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:23.480
 The athlete who can dominate the direction of the match and the athlete who can dominate the setups

1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:28.040
 Will win the vast majority of fights. They're in those three things

1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:32.520
 The direction the pace and the setups you dominate all three of those

1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:36.280
 You're gonna win 90% of the matches you're in

1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:42.440
 Um, george could always dominate the direction of the fight because he could stop the other guy taking him down

1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:49.320
 And he could impose his own takedowns at any point in a match. So whether went to ground or whether it stayed standing

1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:51.640
 was always up to him

1:54:51.880 --> 1:54:55.400
 george had the most sophisticated array of setups into takedowns

1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:58.760
 That I've personally ever witnessed

1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:04.840
 Um, the whole distinction between reactive and proactive takedowns came very early in george's career

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:09.640
 And he excelled in both most people tend to favor one or the other

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:13.000
 Most athletes have a very hard time

1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:15.880
 imposing

1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:18.520
 Their setups on an opponent and as a result they have to use

1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:25.800
 The cage as a crutch for their for their setups where they just bully someone towards the cage and then put them down on the cage

1:55:26.200 --> 1:55:30.520
 George is one of the very few people who was equally good against the cage or in the open

1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.360
 It could do so in both proactive and reactive situations

1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:37.160
 um

1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:40.200
 And the scary thing is that as good as

1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:43.960
 all of you saw him look in the octagon

1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:47.160
 Anyone who knows george

1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:50.040
 As a coach will tell you he was twice as good as that

1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:54.680
 In the gym where he would often go against people several weight divisions above himself

1:55:55.160 --> 1:56:00.280
 I could sit here all day. I won't name names, but I always laugh when people say oh, this is the greatest

1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:04.120
 Uh pound for pound guy of all time and I've personally seen george

1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:06.920
 Take that guy down and crush him in the gym

1:56:06.920 --> 1:56:10.840
 And I can't say anything because it's rude to talk about that in public because it's just training

1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:16.680
 But I've seen george go with people all the way to light heavyweight some of the greatest names in the history of the sport put them down

1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:24.200
 Advanced position on the ground and dominate them in training. It's it's what he did during that time. I uh, george

1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:26.920
 I gotta say I deeply admire

1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:31.240
 Many of the things I saw you do not just in the octagon, but in training as well

1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:33.000
 It's um

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.720
 the the impact that you had on

1:56:36.680 --> 1:56:37.800
 uh

1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:38.680
 the

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:40.680
 that agreed to which

1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:44.200
 Take downs were we were using the sport was absolutely inspirational

1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:49.400
 That's why one of one of the reasons why I always say you're one of the the only athlete I ever met who taught me

1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:55.640
 More than than I taught you because you opened my eyes to a whole new world of of shootboxing

1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.080
 and how

1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:01.880
 I grew up in a time when uh, you I was laughing before when you talked about sugary Leonard

1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:06.120
 I was a kid watching that match and um, I grew up in a time where there was

1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:11.240
 Boxing and there was kickboxing and then I came to america and I learned grappling and

1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:15.240
 This young man here was the innovator when it came to the integration of the two

1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:19.880
 Well, then I have to ask is george sits here uncomfortably being complimented

1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.040
 um

1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:27.880
 If george st. Pierre and kabeeb namagamet off face each other in their prime who wins

1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:33.720
 Who that's a very very loaded question. How yeah, like what are the different trajectories you see?

1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:41.000
 Okay, how does each one win in your view if one wins or the other one wins what happens interestingly they're actually

1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:43.720
 Very similar in size despite the fact that

1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:46.760
 george fought at welterweight and kabeeb

1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:53.400
 fought at lightweight if you actually see them stand next to each other the of similar height kabeeb is actually a little more thick set

1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:56.840
 Yeah, he's actually heavier than you walking around

1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:03.320
 george walked around most of his career between 188 and 191 pounds

1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:06.680
 And so kabeeb actually would ironically have

1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:09.400
 a kind of size and strength advantage

1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:14.200
 Uh, despite being in the lighter weight division that's been the general trend as mma

1:58:14.200 --> 1:58:19.560
 has grown is that athletes will come further down and wait to make weight divisions

1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:27.240
 I believe that george has the best takedowns in history

1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:30.200
 In the open in the cage

1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:36.600
 Kabeeb was his great strength was using the fence to facilitate takedowns

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:46.200
 Um, george kabeeb's other great strength was not only his ability to take people down but to keep people down for extended periods of time

1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:48.840
 Both of them were

1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:53.400
 Powerful strikers on the ground and could do terrible damage to opponents

1:58:54.040 --> 1:58:57.560
 On the floor. So they're both very similar in that regard

1:58:58.840 --> 1:59:00.600
 kabeeb was mostly a

1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:04.200
 Puncher from the back george was mostly an elbow from the front

1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:09.160
 Um, but both of them could lay ways to opponents with strikes on the floor

1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:14.280
 Um, both of them were highly competent with submissions on the ground

1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:19.080
 They weren't submission specialists in the sense of someone like gordon rine, but uh, they were

1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:22.040
 certainly

1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:24.200
 No slouches with submission holds

1:59:24.680 --> 1:59:26.200
 um

1:59:26.200 --> 1:59:33.560
 Yeah, it's just a fascinating idea. So it's almost like who gets the first takedown. Yeah, I do believe that

1:59:34.280 --> 1:59:36.440
 They could probably stand up on each other

1:59:37.160 --> 1:59:40.920
 I don't think either one of them would be able to hold the other down for a whole round

1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:45.320
 Um, both of them are notoriously difficult people to hold down

1:59:45.720 --> 1:59:49.960
 So I don't think that whoever won the first takedown wins the match. I don't think it's like that

1:59:50.520 --> 1:59:51.400
 um

1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:57.000
 I do believe that george would hold a decisive advantage in striking and distance management

1:59:57.560 --> 2:00:01.080
 um, the few times that kabeeb did look shaky is

2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:03.320
 when he

2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:04.840
 kabeeb was either

2:00:04.840 --> 2:00:09.000
 advancing forward menacingly, but when he had to to fight moving backwards

2:00:09.880 --> 2:00:14.040
 There was a definite asymmetry between his ability to fight going forwards, which is very good

2:00:14.360 --> 2:00:18.040
 And his ability to fight going backwards, which was noticeably weaker

2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:19.480
 um

2:00:19.480 --> 2:00:24.440
 george would often fight both forwards and backwards. It was the giago elvis fight

2:00:25.400 --> 2:00:29.720
 Most of the standing time. Yeah, it was was going backwards. Um

2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:37.400
 That's probably there was the single biggest difference between the two athletes and skill level would be in the standing position

2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:39.960
 um on the ground

2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:41.720
 uh

2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:47.000
 Kabeeb slight edge and takedowns on the fence george slight edge and takedowns in the center

2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:54.200
 Um ability to inflict damage on the floor roughly equal ability to fight off the back roughly equal

2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:58.600
 ability to stand up from bottom roughly equal it's a very very hard match

2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.360
 um

2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:06.680
 In terms of the biggest difference in skill level is going to be in the standing position and so it would come down to

2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:07.800
 um

2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:11.000
 That doesn't necessarily mean that kabeeb would lose in the standing position

2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:15.000
 He might just push it to the fence and just use match tactics where he

2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:19.160
 Kept to fight on the fence for significant periods of time

2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:20.920
 um

2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:22.920
 And you can win rounds in that fashion

2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:25.880
 So it's a match that could go either way both of them are

2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:30.920
 Absolutely the best that you'll ever see. I've always believed the three greatest mixed martial artists

2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:35.480
 I've ever seen in my life where george st. Pierre kabeeb. No one would get off and john jones

2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:36.760
 um

2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:40.040
 The three of them have some interesting similarities and differences

2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:42.760
 all three

2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:45.560
 Uh beat every single person they ever faced

2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:46.920
 um

2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:52.680
 I I I know john jones officially has a loss by d cube, but no one believes that was a loss

2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:54.680
 um

2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:56.680
 george does have two losses, but he

2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:00.280
 Defeated both athletes decisively

2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:03.720
 In rematches kabeeb did it by having no losses

2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:11.560
 Interestingly, all three athletes have at least one match, which is controversial in terms of who won and who lost

2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.160
 um

2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:18.920
 john jones has had several matches which could have gone either way on the judges scorecard kabebes

2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:22.520
 Uh match against glacin t bell could have gone either way

2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.520
 Uh george's match with hendrix was could have gone either way

2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:30.680
 They they all had matches that they won which people would dispute the outcome

2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:35.640
 So that was a similarity between the three of them. Um, all three of them

2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.880
 Have had the ability

2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:45.160
 To dominate the direction of fights when they want it to go down it goes down when they don't want it to go down

2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:46.520
 It doesn't

2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:47.640
 um

2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:54.280
 That's why I put such a heavy emphasis on that idea that a mixed martial arts champion must be able to determine the direction of a fight

2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:57.640
 The single most important attribute that they all must have

2:02:58.360 --> 2:02:59.560
 um

2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:03.560
 As to which of the three is the best it's going to come down to criteria

2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.760
 You you can't pull them apart the

2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:13.160
 Which answer you give as to which of those three is the greatest of all time will come down to the criteria that you use

2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:15.800
 Okay, is it being undefeated?

2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:17.320
 um

2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:22.600
 Is it the amount of time was it the quality of the opponents that they had if you do it by quality of opponents?

2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:25.800
 I think you probably have to give it to george if you do it by

2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:28.200
 um

2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:31.160
 Measure dominance through not being defeated and it has to go to compete

2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:33.160
 um

2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:35.800
 Arguably you could say the same with john jones since his one

2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:38.920
 losses

2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:44.040
 By dq but then you could also say the last three or four fights that john's had

2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:47.400
 Had haven't been the same measure of dominance as as we saw previously

2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:49.320
 so ultimately

2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:51.320
 You've got those three guys in my opinion

2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:57.720
 And which one you choose will come down to who it says more about who you are as a viewer than it does about

2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:04.280
 The respective level of the athletes you could throw a blanket over them the three of them are just that good and um

2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:11.800
 Uh, and which one you select will probably say more about who you are as a viewer than it does about them as athletes

2:04:12.440 --> 2:04:16.760
 I believe the best fighter the goat is not even born

2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:19.880
 because the generation

2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:22.840
 That is present

2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:24.920
 Benefit of a huge advantage

2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:28.360
 They have knowledge technology that we didn't have before

2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:33.320
 And we had the the knowledge that the other generation did not have before

2:04:34.520 --> 2:04:35.880
 But

2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:40.200
 I believe the best the goat is not even born yet as good as they are today

2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:44.360
 I think you in sport where you can measure the performance

2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:46.520
 Track and field

2:04:46.520 --> 2:04:48.680
 Olympic lifting you can you know someone

2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:53.960
 Is better than the other one because you can measure the performance fighting. It's all subjective

2:04:53.960 --> 2:04:56.520
 We always debate of who would win

2:04:57.160 --> 2:04:58.360
 but

2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:00.360
 10 the tendency in sport

2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:05.480
 Is that the performance get better? I don't think it's because the athlete necessarily get better

2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:08.680
 It's because they have access to better technology knowledge

2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:11.640
 And they learn from their predecessor

2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:15.240
 As long as that knowledge is transferred forward

2:05:15.240 --> 2:05:22.440
 So something tells me that the greatest of all time lived a few thousand years ago and it's forgotten some of the greatest warriors

2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:28.360
 Like you imagine the kind of grapplers. We just the history didn't record them

2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:33.160
 There could have been small tribes where they developed many ufcs

2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:38.200
 And they've developed the kind of things we you have to think of like the graces

2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:41.640
 Just a small family was able to develop so much so quickly

2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:47.720
 I often as this this discussion with johnny. I think it's very important like to mention

2:05:47.720 --> 2:05:52.680
 But I ask you very several times like what would happen if we would take

2:05:53.480 --> 2:05:59.160
 A fighter of modern days facing the champion of pancreation. This is an interesting question

2:05:59.160 --> 2:06:04.760
 And you brought something incredible a good point and and people don't don't realize it, you know

2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:11.800
 Yeah, no, I think um one of the great tragedies of martial arts history is our loss of

2:06:11.800 --> 2:06:17.000
 Uh, the historical records of pancreation like most of what we know was

2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:22.440
 From what i'm told is actually lost in the fires of the library of alexandria

2:06:22.840 --> 2:06:27.560
 And we're left with only a pitiful amount of information on pancreation managers

2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:32.760
 But what we do know is that there was a very large

2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:38.360
 Uh participation in the sport and that it was why they considered the most popular

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:45.400
 A sport in the ancient olympics and that it was represented in the ancient olympics for many hundreds of years

2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:49.560
 Plus a long period of time before its introduction into the ancient olympics

2:06:50.440 --> 2:06:52.440
 And so the development time

2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:55.560
 That it may have had would have been very significant. It

2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:02.920
 Uh as far as we know most of the development would have been in the major greek city states for

2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:09.240
 Uh, literally hundreds of years of development. Um, given its prestige as an olympic sport

2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:14.600
 Then the best athletes would have been doing it some of the sharpest minds that we know of

2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:20.440
 In human history were involved in the sport. Um, plato the great philosopher

2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:22.840
 Uh

2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:28.040
 Was a pancreationist and his youth in fact his name plato is a nickname

2:07:28.040 --> 2:07:35.240
 Plato is like plate. It means broad or big guy like the big guy and um

2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:40.280
 Uh, he spoke often about pancreation and and his written works

2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:44.600
 Um, imagine people with the intelligence of plato

2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:47.720
 thinking about

2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:52.280
 grappling technique for hundreds of years in the most popular olympic sport of that time

2:07:52.280 --> 2:07:59.480
 Significant numbers of people with financial backing as city states put great prestige upon olympic success

2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:01.560
 They would have funneled athletes in

2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:05.880
 Bought in the best coaches and they had that for many hundreds of years

2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:12.520
 Like it's quite conceivable that the best pancreation athletes were of the absolute first quality

2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:15.080
 and um, uh

2:08:15.480 --> 2:08:20.120
 It's it's so sad to think we'll never know what was their skill level and uh

2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:24.120
 It's interesting to think about what kind of techniques they developed whether

2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:29.240
 There's stuff we haven't discovered yet in class. You're talking about the most effective

2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:32.440
 takedown strategy in wrestling and collegiate wrestling

2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:39.480
 So maybe let me ask first uh, because we offline talked about this too. What is the highest percentage submission in grappling?

2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:44.120
 Overall, you have to go with the red naked strangle strangles from the back

2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:50.760
 If you look at most tournaments and most rule sets, it has success across all rule sets

2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:53.160
 um, all weight divisions

2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:59.880
 All body types. It doesn't require any kind of specific physical advantage such as height

2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:02.760
 In order to be effective

2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:05.800
 It works equally well in both fighting and grappling

2:09:06.280 --> 2:09:07.560
 um

2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:11.880
 It will work regardless of how physically and mentally tough your opponent is

2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:17.160
 Okay, a heel hook is a very high percentage technique in in modern day competition

2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:23.800
 But if your opponent simply makes up his mind that he's not going to tap and is willing to take the physical damage

2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:26.680
 It won't result in the end of a match

2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:33.080
 Uh, a stranglehold by contrast will always end the match regardless of your opponent's mental toughness

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:34.600
 so

2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:39.400
 um, I believe it's fair to say that at the end of the day the single most high percentage

2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:41.720
 method of uh,

2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:47.160
 Submitting people and in grappling is is a red naked strangle. So when you look at an athlete, maybe Gordon you can speak to this like what?

2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:51.160
 What's the best uh, you mentioned gary with the guillotine

2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:55.720
 What's the best submission to really invest in is it the rear naked choke?

2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:01.080
 To really invest your development like understanding the entirety of the system that leads into that

2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:03.880
 Uh, I think that I mean you have to do them all obviously

2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:08.280
 But if I had like one submission that I would only one submission I could pick for the rest of my life

2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:10.280
 It would definitely be a rear naked

2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:15.640
 Can you explain maybe some of the actual technical details of why that's the case?

2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:19.880
 Well as john spoke about they're different in joint locks. Whereas

2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:26.600
 You don't have to tap you can just let your leg break and then keep going with the strangle. There's there's no uh

2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:30.120
 There's there's none of that. Um, and then it's just an inherent

2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:33.240
 advantage you have being behind someone

2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:36.920
 Um, whereas if you go for an arm bar you stop you start from top mountain

2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:38.920
 You're facing the guy and then you put him down and you're not

2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:41.560
 directly behind them with leg locks you're facing the guy

2:10:42.200 --> 2:10:46.440
 Whereas when you're on someone's back you have them in a pin where you can your chest the back

2:10:46.680 --> 2:10:50.040
 You have a body triangle and you're painting the guy in place. You can't explode out

2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:53.800
 He can't grease his way out most of the time. Uh, and there's an inherent advantage

2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:59.160
 You have being behind them due to the fact that we're poorly set up to deal with threats behind us

2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:04.680
 So would you say that's the most dominant position you get to like more than mount?

2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:11.240
 More than yeah sat control more than I think uh, if you look at most matches historically

2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:16.280
 Most guys who get stuck in positions for long amounts of time are guys that they're back taken

2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:18.360
 um, if you get

2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:22.600
 An explosive guy from bottom mountain he can bridge and he can off bound to you and lock half guard

2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:25.960
 Maybe and then work back to guard but if someone locks a body triangle on your back

2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:29.720
 That's where you see most guys getting pinned in place for long amounts of time

2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:34.760
 Was uh, was the body triangle like a well understood thing

2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:39.640
 Was that an invention at that point like as a system as a

2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:41.720
 As a control option

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:47.720
 Have some of your your listeners can correct me on this but I believe there was a technique band and judo called doji main

2:11:48.200 --> 2:11:54.760
 Which involved crossing feet or locking a triangle around the abdominals from the back and it was band and judo

2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:57.240
 I believe because

2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:02.680
 Of intestinal injuries which occurred in the early developmental days of judo

2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:04.600
 and

2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:06.120
 In the modern era

2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:11.160
 When I first began judo to body triangles were relatively rare. They were not a standard part of class

2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:12.760
 um

2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:19.880
 And sometime around the late 1990s early 2000s people started to realize this is a stronger method of control

2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:21.800
 um

2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:23.080
 it

2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:29.000
 It greatly increases the amount of control you have over your opponents hips and torso over regular hooks

2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:35.640
 Uh, it's not for all athletes. It's difficult for most people who are of shorter thicker statue

2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:39.720
 To employ on on on big people if your opponent is very

2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:43.000
 Broadly built through the stomach. It's almost impossible to apply

2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:49.480
 And so because it can't be applied by all people it tends not to be taught much at beginner level

2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:51.160
 and

2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:54.040
 so as a result it was always seen as a

2:12:54.920 --> 2:13:01.720
 Kind of a specialist move for taller athletes at a higher level of competition rather than a broad base move for everyone

2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:04.520
 Or every body type in every class to employ

2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:08.520
 So it just didn't get emphasized that much but in top level competition now

2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:15.960
 I think you would see that it's very apparent that the vast majority of athletes whenever they have the opportunity or a choice between

2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:17.560
 body triangle

2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:22.040
 And regular rear mounts the majority of modern athletes would choose a body triangle

2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:24.680
 So we also had this conversation about wrestling

2:13:24.920 --> 2:13:29.320
 And maybe georgia can comment on like what's the uh, the highest percentage

2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:34.120
 Not statistically speaking. Perhaps that's also interesting as john talked about but just for you

2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:40.120
 In terms of mastery of a takedown. What's what's the best way to take it down a human being?

2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:43.240
 in wrestling well, I

2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:45.240
 Personally for me it depends

2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:49.400
 For every fighter are different. They have a different set of skill

2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:53.160
 For me I when I look someone

2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:57.880
 Want to bring down a tree a big strong high tree?

2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:00.920
 He cut it from the base

2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:06.680
 So the legs that that's what we stand on. So it was to attack the leg

2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:10.120
 But is it single leg double leg is it we talked about like, uh,

2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:17.160
 Well, there's also the the john smith low single. We actually I don't even know if that's applicable for digits at all

2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:23.320
 You can use it, but it runs into problem with submission holds. Yeah, it's it's not impossible to use but

2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:28.920
 Without shoes and in a situation where there's a whole plethora of submission holds in the scoring

2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.600
 It's a little more difficult to use, you know

2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:38.680
 It is interesting something being a high percentage in terms of effectiveness tells a story

2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:43.800
 You're saying that every athlete is different, but if it's more effective for most people

2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:48.520
 I mean it's interesting. It's it's interesting what john talked about is that

2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:52.440
 the highest percentage thing is actually, uh

2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:55.480
 In collegiate wrestling that he was talking about is

2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:01.240
 On the defensive side. So blocking a takedown and spinning around to the to the back

2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:04.520
 So that's an interesting idea

2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:09.240
 then also there's all of these kind of going in for a single and switching to a double or

2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:15.000
 Wizard position and doing knee tap like there's all these kinds of combinations that seem to be

2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:21.160
 Effective when you look at the statistics and it seems like there's maybe this is a scientific way of thinking but it seems like there is

2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:29.000
 Some conclusion to be drawn there. Oh, yeah, I believe you need to the high percentage move. There's a reason why they work

2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:30.600
 I think it's

2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:33.480
 It's made for a bigger amount of people

2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:36.840
 Um, for example, I one of my main

2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:39.080
 strength

2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:44.200
 Athletic strength is I'm an explosive person. So I use technique that are explosive

2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:49.400
 If I got a single leg my my one of my thing I like to do is to go for the double power double

2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:51.880
 but for

2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:56.520
 Someone else we got for example in a single leg position. Maybe he likes

2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:03.080
 Like body throw better. He's more a greco guy like so or he's a judo guy. He's gonna go for something something else

2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:04.360
 so

2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:10.760
 But there is move that are I would say like you just mentioned are universal like statistically speaking they're

2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:14.840
 The highest percentage move that works for pretty much everybody

2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:19.800
 Everybody pretty much put can do an adac at Jimmy, you know, it's very easy

2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:24.520
 But it's not everybody that can lock a triangle with their legs

2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:33.000
 So so those move like a rear naked choke adac at Jimmy is the highest percentage move because it's maybe more accessible

2:16:33.640 --> 2:16:37.800
 It's accessible for a bigger range of yeah, based on the physical characteristics of the people

2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:40.920
 Do you draw any wisdom from these high percentages John?

2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:45.000
 For like in terms of what to focus on. Yeah, absolutely

2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:49.320
 Judith who has an ocean of moves and you can get lost on that ocean

2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:54.040
 You can drift for a long period of time and and that was very little a show for it

2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:57.640
 So my whole thing is focus. We only live one lifetime

2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:01.560
 And your training lifetime is even shorter than your actual lifetime

2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:04.200
 So in that time

2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:06.680
 I've lived die on the mat

2:17:07.720 --> 2:17:09.720
 That's true saying

2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:14.840
 I I put a very high value on

2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:18.520
 Choosing what I believe to be the most high percentage

2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:23.240
 Moves and putting an extraordinary amount of focus on them

2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:30.360
 Um, the only problem is that in one generation a move which can be considered low percentage might actually turn out to be

2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:36.200
 High percentage in another generation. For example, we talked earlier about leg locks when I was first out of duty

2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:39.400
 so they were considered the ultimate low percentage move and

2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:46.680
 Uh, a big part of my career has been convincing people that in fact that was that was incorrect that they can be a high percentage move

2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:48.920
 If we just change our approach to them

2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:50.440
 um

2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:52.120
 So we can't just

2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:57.400
 Follow tradition and say oh, this is low percentage. This is high percentage. It has to be part of

2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:01.480
 a fairly systematic study where you investigate

2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:08.600
 What are the reasons why it's high percentage or low percentage with regards take downs

2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:13.800
 If you look at what we can consider the most high percentage take downs

2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:19.960
 If you're in front of someone the single most high percentage way of taking them down is to get a hold of both of their legs and push them backwards

2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:24.040
 Okay, if you get a hold of one of their legs and put a force on them

2:18:24.280 --> 2:18:26.920
 They can use their other leg to defend themselves and hop around and

2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:30.040
 Funk their way out of take downs and cause all kinds of problems for you

2:18:30.520 --> 2:18:33.880
 I didn't care how athletic your opponent is if you get a hold of firm grip

2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:38.040
 Of both of his legs and start pushing them backwards. He's going to fall down to his butt

2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:41.320
 Now he might be able to recover from there, but he will fall down

2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:44.840
 Even easier than that is to be behind someone

2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:47.640
 Take downs from in front of someone difficult

2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:52.280
 You go right into their hips their head their hands that you go into all their defensive weapons

2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:57.480
 If you're already behind someone and you're doing what in America they refer to as a mat return

2:18:57.800 --> 2:19:01.160
 This is significantly easier than taking someone down from the front

2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:04.840
 If you have control of their head in a front headlock position

2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:11.080
 You've already closed distance on your opponent. You already have closed contact. You don't have to worry about shooting anymore

2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:16.600
 There's no sprawl out of that. You don't have to worry about guillotines, kimoras or the standard defenses

2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:20.120
 Those will intrinsically be easier take downs out of front headlock

2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:24.840
 And so if we're going to talk about high percentage technique, I always go back to the mechanics of it

2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:29.720
 Rather than just historical tradition because historical tradition can be wrong

2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:36.920
 It was wrong about leg locks. It could be wrong about other things too. So my primary thing is okay. Talk to me about mechanics

2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:41.320
 That's what ultimately is going to determine whether something is high percentage or not

2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:42.760
 Um

2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:47.560
 Gordon pointed out earlier that when you're behind someone you have innate physical advantages over the other guy

2:19:47.560 --> 2:19:52.920
 The human the human body is set up entirely to defend threats from the front

2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:58.680
 We are poorly adapted to defending threats from the rear. We don't have eyes in the back of our head

2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:00.680
 We can't apply pushing strength backwards

2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:06.760
 If you get behind someone take downs are 10 times easier from behind someone than they are when you're in front of someone

2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:11.240
 If you have to take someone down from the front get a hold of both of their legs

2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:16.280
 If you can get a hold of both of their legs and a part of pushing force you will almost always knock them down

2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:21.240
 If you can get a hold of their head

2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:23.400
 And work take downs from there again

2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:29.560
 It's much easier because most of their defensive apparatus has been taken away from them before the takedown even begins

2:20:30.040 --> 2:20:31.080
 and so

2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:35.320
 For me the most high percentage takedowns will always be from the front double legs

2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:40.200
 From any takedown from the back is going to be significantly easier than any takedown from the front

2:20:40.440 --> 2:20:44.120
 So all manner of mat return takedowns are going to be very high percentage

2:20:44.680 --> 2:20:45.800
 um

2:20:45.800 --> 2:20:51.160
 And takedowns done out of situations where the opponent is broken down in front of you and you have either front headlock

2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:55.400
 or front chest reposition are going to be significantly easier than takedowns from the open

2:20:56.360 --> 2:20:57.400
 of course

2:20:57.400 --> 2:20:59.400
 You have to consider the full

2:20:59.960 --> 2:21:01.640
 spectrum of mechanics and volatility

2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:06.680
 It's possible that an outside low single leading to a double leg is much higher percentage

2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:12.040
 It's like there's a lot of chain wrestling yet, you know that needs to be considered as the possibility

2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:14.760
 Maybe a straight on double and part of this cultural too

2:21:15.320 --> 2:21:19.400
 Are people afraid of this kind of thing that they came to be the case with leg locks?

2:21:19.400 --> 2:21:21.400
 Are people aware of this?

2:21:21.640 --> 2:21:24.840
 Are they worried about this? Are they training for this to defend this?

2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:28.440
 and and then it's upon a specific of course that

2:21:29.400 --> 2:21:33.480
 You know with jordan boros people are preparing for the double, which is why he had to develops

2:21:34.840 --> 2:21:39.960
 A whole other kinds of different stuff and then the head to all the different controls all the different ties

2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:42.360
 within the rule set

2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:47.480
 And that's where it's so fascinating to see the effective rule set on all of this judo over the past

2:21:47.480 --> 2:21:54.280
 I think 20 years went through this every olympics different changes to the rule set like fundamentally different

2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:59.080
 In terms of what's allowed to grip whether you're allowed to touch the legs at all. That was a big one in

2:22:00.200 --> 2:22:02.200
 2012 I think

2:22:02.200 --> 2:22:08.280
 And that changed the sport completely and so interesting. It's so interesting to watch how tiny change in the rule

2:22:08.760 --> 2:22:13.720
 Can change the sport at the highest when when you're talking about people competing at the highest level

2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:16.520
 And the cool thing there is

2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:20.840
 The rule change happens on a scale of every four years

2:22:21.640 --> 2:22:24.920
 So you get to see people that are at the top of their game

2:22:25.480 --> 2:22:27.480
 Have to like recompute

2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:31.560
 So it's not like you have a new generation of people coming up with the rules. They have to figure. Oh, shit

2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:36.760
 You're not allowed to like it's it's the equivalent of saying you you're not allowed to kick anymore in MMA

2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:40.520
 Because you were not allowed to grab legs anymore in judo

2:22:40.520 --> 2:22:43.480
 Interestingly, if you look at the

2:22:44.360 --> 2:22:45.880
 case of judo

2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:47.880
 If you look at the world rankings

2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:49.960
 of athletes

2:22:49.960 --> 2:22:57.320
 When they went through one of the most significant rule changes in judo history where they banned any form of grabbing the legs

2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:01.400
 The ranking of athletes didn't change much

2:23:02.680 --> 2:23:06.440
 Yeah, that tells you that there um, there's a reason why those guys are at the top

2:23:06.440 --> 2:23:12.520
 Yeah, and it doesn't have to do that. They're specific to a rule set. Yeah, think about that in terms of

2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:16.440
 Imagine for example in mixed martial arts if they just said hey

2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:18.840
 Starting next week

2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:22.360
 Instead of having three five minute rounds. It's going to be 15 minutes straight

2:23:23.240 --> 2:23:26.680
 That would massively change the preparation of the athletes

2:23:27.720 --> 2:23:34.280
 It's a different game at that point and judo literally was a different game before 2010 and after 2010 and yet

2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:40.280
 The international rankings didn't really change that much the countries that were dominant before

2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:45.800
 Remain dominant the athletes that remain before largely remain the same

2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:53.640
 You would think was such a massive change all the rankings would have been thrown upside down, but they weren't and uh,

2:23:53.720 --> 2:23:58.680
 Again, it goes back to this idea that there's a reason why the guys at the top are at the top

2:24:00.120 --> 2:24:03.000
 And now for something completely different we talked about aliens earlier

2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:07.400
 Yeah, so you uh, george brought up babasar. I I um

2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:11.720
 We'll likely probably talk to babasar on this podcast and then um

2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:20.040
 And then john had this a skeptical look on his face about about aliens. So let me ask uh, john and gordon

2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:26.600
 Uh, do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations out there in the universe outside of our own?

2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:33.160
 The universe is unimaginably large the idea that we are the only life forms

2:24:33.640 --> 2:24:35.640
 and a cosmos as large as this is

2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:39.880
 I think naive and foolish

2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:41.880
 um

2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:49.560
 There's a very high likelihood that if life could evolve on this planet that it could have done so on many many other planets around the

2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:55.960
 Uh around the cosmos. I think anyone who puts even a moment's thought into this would realize that there's

2:24:56.520 --> 2:24:58.920
 Almost certainly other forms of life out there

2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:03.720
 the real question with regards the alien community is um,

2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:09.640
 Have they got here and now they're searching our planet in um little sulfur sources and

2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:16.600
 Making observations and periodically stealing people for experimentation purposes doesn't have to be silver saucers

2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:23.400
 It could be different other color saucers. Um, and that question i'm i'm i'm not at all convinced. No, I didn't

2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:26.620
 recently um navy footage

2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:29.240
 has come out showing

2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:33.720
 Some very interesting phenomena if you talk to almost any experienced pilot

2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:39.080
 They will tell you they've seen things in the upper atmosphere that are very difficult to explain

2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:41.480
 I'll be the first one to agree with you on this

2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:47.000
 There are some things out there that are extremely difficult to explain like literally UFOs unidentified

2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:53.720
 Yeah, I mean, we just don't know what they are but to go from the idea that there's things out there that we don't understand to

2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:56.200
 there's

2:25:56.200 --> 2:25:57.160
 like

2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:01.240
 Little creatures running around and um, uh, and these somehow exist

2:26:01.720 --> 2:26:07.480
 Uh, I just reserve judgment. I just say I'm I'm agnostic about these things. I think it's possible

2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:14.920
 But um, all the evidence that I've been showing so far was insufficient to come to any kind of definite conclusions until

2:26:15.560 --> 2:26:22.680
 Aliens land in central park on Tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m. And get out with little alien ray guns and start shooting people

2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:24.360
 I don't believe in

2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:26.360
 Many of the stories that get told

2:26:26.440 --> 2:26:33.240
 Well, what about if it's not little aliens with ray guns, but something very different very very difficult to detect for us humans

2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:38.600
 That's very human then it's at that point. It's a it's a fascinating idea and it's certainly possible

2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:40.840
 But show me the evidence

2:26:41.800 --> 2:26:43.800
 All right, what about you gordon?

2:26:44.120 --> 2:26:51.240
 Yeah, do you do you look at the cosmos and ponder the stars often? I think it's fair points john raised

2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:53.960
 uh, something really interesting I saw the other day was uh

2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:58.760
 someone posted like if an alien organ or civilization

2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:04.360
 65 million light years away somehow managed to look at earth

2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:10.600
 They would theoretically see the dinosaurs because we're 65 million light years away. So like imagine us looking at

2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:15.880
 Galaxies that are 100 million light years away. That's 100 million years ago. You have no idea what it looks like now

2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:18.200
 Um, so that's what's super interesting to me about it

2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:24.760
 Yeah, the the expanse is huge and so much cool stuff could be going out there. Yeah

2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:29.160
 And uh, the scary thing of course is if they haven't visited us yet

2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:31.560
 the

2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:33.640
 There has to be a good reason for it

2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:40.360
 And the the the set of scary reasons of all the fact that they maybe once you get sufficiently advanced in your development

2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:43.960
 You destroy yourself naturally as humans seem to be approaching now

2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:47.640
 We we more and more have the tools to destroy ourselves completely

2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:50.600
 in terms of our weapon systems

2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:54.760
 Um, and we're developing them more and more and they're becoming better and better

2:27:55.400 --> 2:27:59.240
 And then we're starting to get angry and anger on twitter and instagram at each other

2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:02.280
 It's those are good points you're raising

2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:10.280
 It's the rest thought us that everything that lives one day will die. So we will we will perish one day. Yeah

2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:13.800
 there's also just the the sheer difficulty of

2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:16.680
 of

2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:22.360
 Of travel through space like space is an unimaginably inhospitable environment

2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:25.080
 And to the best of our knowledge

2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:32.520
 This even the theoretical speeds that we can attain in space even if we could

2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:36.920
 Travel at the speed of light. We're not even remotely close to that

2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:43.240
 Still the distances that need to be traveled to get to even relatively close solar systems

2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:50.680
 Are very very long if you look at astronauts who have spent significant amounts of time and space

2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:55.800
 Just orbiting the earth. It has severe health effects on them. We just not built for space

2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:58.840
 We're supposed to be in a gravitational environment

2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:03.480
 But we you're referring to your biological mead bag that's containing the essence

2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:07.720
 Of the mind that is John Donahue. Maybe we can transfer the mind

2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:14.520
 Alone so the the the bag the mead the mead bag is not designed for space, but maybe the again

2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:16.520
 This is all contents of the mind. It's

2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:22.760
 It's possible, but what do you think concrete evidence you folks who like difficult things

2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:27.480
 Uh, what do you think about uh, Elon Musk wanting to colonize Mars?

2:29:29.240 --> 2:29:33.640
 Is this something you find an interesting or a, um

2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:38.360
 Amos pursuit I think it's a must or a salvation

2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:45.080
 We need to leave at some point the planet because historically in the past. We know that we've been bombarded by asteroid

2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:47.000
 Volcano

2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:51.640
 There are crazy things happen here. It's very unstable. You know, we if you look at it to

2:29:52.280 --> 2:29:57.640
 True a lifetime of a human being. It's nothing but just look 12,000 years ago. What happened, you know

2:29:57.640 --> 2:30:02.280
 So so there is cataclysm that happened all the time. It's very unstable

2:30:02.280 --> 2:30:08.680
 So if we want to survive as a species, I think it's it's we need to get out to be able to get out and

2:30:09.080 --> 2:30:15.000
 Spread or seed. So these are the early steps on a really long journey. But is there something about like

2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:23.720
 You know, we don't get that exploration for most of modern society, you know, the kind of exploring that people did throughout the centuries of

2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:26.280
 You know coming to the

2:30:26.280 --> 2:30:31.400
 North America just throughout we were shrouded in physical uncertainties

2:30:31.400 --> 2:30:33.400
 Of what's out there

2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:40.440
 And now we get to do the same kind of exploration with Mars. Is there so, I mean, is there any aspect of you that wants to

2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.560
 Travel out the space that wants to travel to Mars?

2:30:44.200 --> 2:30:47.560
 There, you know, the goal is to allow civilians to travel

2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:53.160
 Perhaps in our lifetime meaning affordably you can do so now unaffordably

2:30:54.120 --> 2:30:59.400
 Traveling to space and traveling to Mars or two different things. I think I would like to travel into space

2:30:59.400 --> 2:31:03.400
 I don't know if I would like to travel all the way to Mars because of the risks involved

2:31:04.440 --> 2:31:06.440
 Just because

2:31:06.440 --> 2:31:07.400
 Boring

2:31:07.400 --> 2:31:12.680
 Is there some part of you that enjoys that if I was like towards the end of my life, I would like to travel to Mars

2:31:12.680 --> 2:31:17.480
 Just the experience. Yeah, but if I go to Mars, I'm not coming back. I think that's it

2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:20.120
 one way ticket

2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:23.560
 With the technology we have now maybe in the future, maybe our

2:31:23.560 --> 2:31:28.520
 The children of our children will will be able to to experience that to go to

2:31:28.520 --> 2:31:30.920
 Well, the weekend on Mars

2:31:31.800 --> 2:31:37.400
 Well, the the whole design of the starship that the SpaceX is working on is supposed to come back

2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:42.120
 It's supposed to be reusable. So it's not it's not a one way ticket. That's the whole point

2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:48.040
 It's always going back and forth back and forth. What's the time frame between two planets?

2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:52.200
 Like to travel from I think the current thing you'd be stuck on Mars for two years

2:31:52.760 --> 2:31:57.560
 But how long does it take to get from Earth to Mars? Oh, it's pretty. I'm not exactly sure but it's pretty quick

2:31:58.520 --> 2:32:02.760
 It's pretty quick. Like, uh, I don't know and the scale of months not scale of years

2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:07.640
 You might not be healthy when you come back, you know, all the astronauts they experience health issues

2:32:07.640 --> 2:32:13.960
 You know, they lose a lot of muscle mass bone density. So, yeah, I don't think the technology is good right now. I mean

2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:19.000
 Let's say that it is I would love to be doing it for a weekend. If it's safe

2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:24.840
 I would be the first one to to a professional fighter who sacrifices body for something

2:32:25.160 --> 2:32:29.160
 So there's some sacrifice we do in life, right? I would don't want to be the first

2:32:29.160 --> 2:32:32.920
 I wouldn't want to I leave the other one but one I know it's it's safe

2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:37.480
 Okay, count me in. So one of the things that people say and this is something I wonder about is

2:32:38.200 --> 2:32:40.520
 It's like having children or something once you see

2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:45.560
 Once you're out in space and you look out and you see Earth, you look back at Earth. That's an experience

2:32:45.560 --> 2:32:48.760
 It's not like anything else. Like you can't replicate it here

2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:52.600
 Is to look back at that like blue dot

2:32:53.560 --> 2:32:55.560
 And that nerve wracking

2:32:56.680 --> 2:32:59.560
 Like you see like Earth disappear into the distance

2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:04.600
 Yeah, yeah disappear into the distance and then you get to actually stand on Mars and see

2:33:05.160 --> 2:33:07.160
 And just to look you're standing on the ground

2:33:07.160 --> 2:33:11.000
 And you're looking out and you see the planet from which you came and

2:33:11.560 --> 2:33:14.840
 Where you might not be coming back, but there's a challenge to the whole thing

2:33:14.840 --> 2:33:16.840
 Whereas the risk is tremendous

2:33:17.640 --> 2:33:21.640
 And I don't know I find that risk really compelling for some reason

2:33:21.640 --> 2:33:23.640
 But that could be just the exploration

2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:26.920
 Look, I guess that's a genetic thing too. How much do you want to explore?

2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:34.040
 There's a sense though in which even in the best case scenario where they did get the technology to whisk you

2:33:34.040 --> 2:33:37.480
 to Mars in a in a fairly short period of time

2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:42.200
 It's kind of an inauthentic sense of exploration because

2:33:42.760 --> 2:33:44.760
 your participation in it

2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:45.800
 is

2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:47.800
 no more exciting than

2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:48.600
 your

2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:51.640
 participation in an airline flight to a foreign country

2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:55.880
 You're basically you you didn't have anything to do with the creation of the of the vessel

2:33:55.880 --> 2:33:58.280
 You're not in command of the vessel. You're not

2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:01.160
 In any way shape or form important to you

2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:04.520
 Not in any way shape or form important to the mission

2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:09.160
 You're just a person sitting in a passenger seat and you get off in a destination the same way

2:34:09.160 --> 2:34:12.040
 What if you flew to singapore or london or someplace like that?

2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:14.200
 Well, there's a hierarchy

2:34:14.200 --> 2:34:17.400
 Of there's a leadership and then there's a bunch of people and they all have roles

2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.240
 You don't get to go to mars without having a some skill set to contribute

2:34:21.400 --> 2:34:24.600
 You've made it sound like space tourism where you just pay a ticket

2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:29.960
 I don't I think it's a long time before you have space tourism to mars where you have nothing to contribute

2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:35.160
 Okay, like you will have to tell what you do you go through like a training program you go training program

2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:39.720
 And then there's uh, there's technical things you'll be contributing. So there they would bring people

2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:43.800
 You know in terms of agriculture. I don't know. Okay. So this is this is better

2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:48.120
 This sounds like they're actually they're more like explorers like if you you talked before about

2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:50.680
 explorers and human history where

2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:55.960
 Magellan sets off on his boat and every person on the boat had a specific function. They were they were all

2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:59.080
 All into the mission in a very authentic fashion

2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:02.200
 If they weren't on the boat the performance of the crew would somehow suffer

2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:05.880
 So this sounds much better and with just like with Magellan

2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:08.600
 I think most of the crew died

2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:10.920
 A significant number did yeah

2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:15.720
 And from uh, yeah from bacteria

2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:20.200
 I mean from things that are unexpected and so on and if we discover life on mars

2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:25.000
 I mean, who knows what that entails because that's like a man mission to mars

2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:29.400
 So explorers would likely be very driven by the research to do all the kind of

2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:35.880
 Exploration required to find life now from uh, mr. Musk's

2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:41.720
 Point of view as a developer presumably there has to be some kind of financial incentive here too

2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:47.720
 Is there some kind of financial benefit to mars missions is is

2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:50.920
 Presumably

2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:55.320
 There wouldn't be that many people on earth that could afford a ticket to pay for the kind of

2:35:55.960 --> 2:36:01.400
 Development that would require this is there some kind of mining on mars of minerals that would be useful

2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:03.240
 I think there's a lot of answers to this

2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:06.600
 But the only honest answer is the one where that looks back into human history

2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:09.480
 Well, we did a lot of things just because we we could

2:36:10.200 --> 2:36:16.200
 A lot of hard things just because we could and that led to a lot of innovation that ultimately made our life better

2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:22.600
 So this is more this is why you have nasa. This is why you have government organizations like what's the purpose of nasa

2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:25.640
 nasa would answer that by saying okay, well, we're helping

2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:32.200
 Launch satellites up there all that they'll have a bunch of answers, but the reality is the programs

2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:34.200
 were

2:36:34.200 --> 2:36:38.840
 funded in large part by our desire to explore the unknown and

2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:43.880
 There's some aspect to which we have to all invest into that because historically speaking

2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:50.600
 That has produced a lot of cool things along the way. They were totally unexpected like but nasa is funded by

2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:53.240
 public funding the taxpayer

2:36:53.480 --> 2:37:00.920
 How is mr. Musk going to fund this well currently most of the funding was the SpaceX is nasa giving

2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:03.640
 money uh to

2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:09.560
 So they're making a competition who can who can get our satellites we need to go to

2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:13.400
 um, you know, it was for the space station to

2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:19.720
 Resupply the space station or we need to launch satellites up who's going to carry those quote unquote payloads

2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.920
 They just need so nasa is paying whoever the heck wants to

2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:25.240
 get

2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:27.880
 kilograms of thing up into space

2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:32.280
 Why did this is nice is specialty? Why did they just give up on that?

2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:37.160
 Well, they why they realized where mr. Musk came along and then bezels and others

2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:39.960
 That said we can do it for one tenth the price

2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:46.280
 So why did the why should the taxpayers pay for the why don't you nasa do what you do well?

2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:51.400
 Which is like test out cutting edge stuff make sure they're safe and now

2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.040
 that we've developed

2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:55.800
 um, a car

2:37:55.800 --> 2:37:58.840
 Let us let us ups and fedex take care of

2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:01.800
 Doing this at scale doing it cheaper doing it better

2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:07.560
 I mean that's the argument and nasa took what they realized is it took way way too long to do stuff

2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:12.040
 When you're investing millions that's billions of dollars into a project

2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:15.320
 The the bureaucracy builds up

2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:20.280
 And the conservatism builds up to where you're I mean you really have to test everything out

2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:25.480
 So projects take years and then you have somebody like Elon Musk coming along and says well, let's do

2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:27.560
 launches every

2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:32.760
 Every week and as opposed to just throwing away the rocket will reuse the rocket

2:38:33.080 --> 2:38:38.120
 That was one of the sort of cutting edge inventions. It's a dumb obvious idea

2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:41.240
 Like like Elon says, why do you throw away the plane?

2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:44.280
 It's the equivalent as if you flew a plane every time you threw it away

2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:46.760
 Why are we every time throwing away the plane?

2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:51.400
 But nasa's tried that kind of thing with the space shuttle since the 1970s and yes

2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:55.400
 Well, they did that with the space shuttle but not not at the scale here that uh,

2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:57.400
 It was the space shuttle was seen as this

2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:05.800
 Like majestic amazing thing that requires a huge amount of investment with Elon Musk is like no with every basic rocket

2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:07.880
 Should be reusable

2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:11.240
 Nice cut cut cost cut cost. Do you do you think like

2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:15.080
 The more technology we have the more advanced we become the more

2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:22.200
 Specialized we need to be like is that for that reason that now they there's different branch like you just explain now now

2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:28.440
 That's so they're specializing in this but they left, you know other branch. Yeah, there's there's greater and greater specializations

2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:31.000
 We build up more stuff which is fascinating because

2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:34.440
 Is it making us more

2:39:35.160 --> 2:39:39.000
 Dumb in a way. Do you think like like like I don't know like

2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:43.800
 You know, but like I use a cell phone, but I don't know how to build it up from

2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:47.720
 Like I mean, it's that beta males building up this whole society

2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:50.520
 Because we're this collective intelligence

2:39:50.520 --> 2:39:53.640
 we rely on each other more and more and

2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:55.400
 it

2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:59.800
 I do also see sort of the rise of conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things because

2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:07.240
 Like I've been talking to a few folks about flat earth recently. It's fascinating. It's fascinating

2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:10.520
 there's a large community of people that believe the earth is flat and

2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:18.520
 That idea takes hold in this day and age of all the ideas. That's the one that takes hold for a large number of people and

2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:24.600
 I think that's a consequence is this this kind of specialization where it's just a huge amount of experts

2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:30.120
 But if you look out into our world and try to reason simply about our existence

2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:36.120
 We we are losing the skills to do that because more and more people are specialized as opposed to general thinkers

2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:44.280
 We're like extremely good at specific things. Are we capable now to do a robot that is self aware?

2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:46.920
 There that's that's one the legged one

2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:52.280
 I need uh, it's self aware like it's not self aware. It's been listening, but it's not self aware currently

2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:56.600
 But do you think a human being is self aware or that's a good question?

2:40:57.400 --> 2:41:01.480
 I mean I ask this question all the time when the robots move. There's a sense of

2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:05.560
 When they turn on

2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:07.560
 Something entered that robot

2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:09.960
 Wow, and when it turns off something left

2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:15.480
 If they move in a certain kind of way and if they're if they surprise you

2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:18.520
 There's certain elements that enable us

2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:21.560
 to see the magic in

2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:26.920
 In a living being and some of them. I mean we can care go we can maybe list them

2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:29.560
 But it's the ability to surprise you

2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:32.200
 it's the

2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:38.120
 Ability to make mistakes and learn from them visibly. There's a bunch of things that you just

2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:43.640
 I don't know. It just feels like it has the magic of what is a living being

2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:49.880
 And which is what humans have and I try to think about how do you replicate that into a machine?

2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:55.640
 So when you turn it on enough is you feel like it dies every time and you reborn, right?

2:41:55.640 --> 2:41:59.480
 So for most machines, we don't feel that way. We don't when we unplug things

2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:04.600
 We don't feel that way. I don't know why we don't feel that way. That's an interesting question

2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:07.080
 but I think when

2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:10.680
 When the robot has certain qualities

2:42:10.680 --> 2:42:12.680
 Like memory

2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:15.800
 Like ability to recognize you

2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:19.320
 Yeah, you start to feel like you're turning off an organism

2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:24.200
 So so whenever I have like the robots that recognize me and remember

2:42:24.760 --> 2:42:28.440
 This is important that all the things we've experienced together

2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:31.160
 Then it's like holy shit

2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:36.280
 That's a that's a living thing. But does he remember? It feels like a living thing. Does he remember

2:42:36.280 --> 2:42:43.240
 Your robot does he remember things that happened before you unplugged it? Is it like he's sleeping?

2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:48.440
 Like is he wake up or is he like no, so right now start to zero everything?

2:42:48.840 --> 2:42:54.040
 Uh, no, it doesn't start to zero remember remembers everything. That's the key every time you like you you unplug

2:42:54.440 --> 2:43:00.680
 Wow, it's storing the storing the memory. But the memories are basic. They're like, okay, we walked around the kitchen and then

2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:06.840
 Um, you looked at me. I mean the memory is it's like data. It's just it's not like we've experienced it's able to actually

2:43:07.880 --> 2:43:12.120
 Uh, experience anything deep like we humans can but just the fact of memory

2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:17.720
 It's like the toaster or the microwave. Don't don't give a shit about me

2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:24.120
 They don't know me. They don't know me by name. They wouldn't recognize my face as being different from Gordon's

2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:26.680
 They wouldn't know the difference and they wouldn't

2:43:26.680 --> 2:43:32.280
 Remember the microwave currently doesn't remember, you know, the times I've been sad or happy

2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:39.720
 Like what food I put into it. It doesn't remember this when I was being a fat ass or what I was being in good shape and

2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:44.280
 I'll just those memories are enough to make you feel when you turn a thing off

2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:49.640
 It's like shit. That's the living that's the that's the living thing disappearing

2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:53.000
 Of course, that's kind of an anthropomorphism we do to each other

2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:56.280
 But uh, that's something is, you know, that

2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:01.000
 That's something that makes me believe it's possible to create, um

2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:08.280
 Systems with which we can have a connection that are non human like similar to dogs and cats and so on

2:44:09.160 --> 2:44:15.720
 Just makes me and that's what's interesting to me because ultimately I feel like that'll help us understand, um, ourselves

2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:22.120
 And maybe practice grappling moves. Anyway, I think that's what's interesting to me

2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:24.120
 anyway, um

2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:29.160
 Well, let me ask the uh advice question

2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:34.040
 Uh, now that we're together I've asked I've spoken to john I spoke to george

2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:38.920
 What what advice would you give to young folks whether we're talking about?

2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:40.600
 sport

2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:47.960
 Like excelling becoming great at grappling becoming great at fighting become a great at whatever sport they take on or life in general

2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:54.200
 Whether they're maybe in high school or in college. What advice would you give them to uh excel?

2:44:55.160 --> 2:45:00.920
 At that thing they take on I don't know if I'm qualified to answer this because I'm only 26

2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:04.520
 So you said you said you said giving advice to young people

2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:06.280
 um

2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:08.280
 for me, I think the two biggest things are

2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:12.440
 Find something that you're both talented in and you enjoy

2:45:12.920 --> 2:45:13.960
 um

2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:18.840
 I think that if you enjoy something, but you're terrible at it. It's going to be hard for you to be successful

2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:21.560
 in life at that given in that given area

2:45:22.040 --> 2:45:26.520
 um, and it's going to be hard to do something for long amounts of time

2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:32.040
 Uh, if you're talented at it, but you don't enjoy doing it. Um, it's easy to come in

2:45:32.840 --> 2:45:33.800
 and

2:45:33.800 --> 2:45:34.840
 train

2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:37.560
 Hard for a month or for two months or for a year

2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:39.720
 You can be very talented at it

2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:46.280
 But if you come it it's but it's a different story to come in every day for five years in a row for 10 years in a row for 15 years in a row

2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:48.760
 um, so I think

2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:50.840
 I think finding something that you're both talented in

2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:55.000
 And something you enjoy are probably the two biggest things for me

2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:59.720
 How do you find the joy in it? So you've been training and saying them out, you know

2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:05.480
 A lot you've been doing it for a long time. Is there's is there ways to rediscover the joy in it?

2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:10.440
 Yeah, for me initially, it was just learning new stuff

2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:16.040
 You know, you come in as a white belt and every day you learn you see a different move and you're like, oh man, that's that's awesome

2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:22.280
 um, and then when I started to compete more seriously towards my professional career, it was

2:46:22.920 --> 2:46:28.440
 Uh, the joy of doing camps and seeing the result of those camps and beating high level athletes

2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:33.080
 Um, and then I got to a point where I've beaten all the high level athletes already. So

2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:37.720
 Who am I gonna compete against? Um, so now for me the joy is just

2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:39.880
 being

2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:47.000
 The best athlete I can possibly be until I reach my prime which I'm hoping is somewhere between 35 and 40

2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:49.960
 Um, so instead of competing against the other athletes

2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:53.400
 I'll be bored already because I already beat all the rest of the guys

2:46:53.960 --> 2:46:55.800
 um, but

2:46:55.800 --> 2:47:01.080
 I know that now I know that I can be better in a year from now or two years from now than I am today

2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:03.080
 And that for me is exciting

2:47:04.280 --> 2:47:07.640
 By the way, is there some aspect of teaching that's exciting to you?

2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:14.280
 Yeah, I because you become a better and better teacher over the years. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely uh, I enjoy teaching and

2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:17.320
 I used to teach, um

2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:22.440
 A lot before I met john and then I met john and I was like, yeah, I just have no idea how to teach

2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:25.720
 Um, so that's like a completely different element, uh of the sport

2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:29.960
 Um, you know doing things and being good at doing things or being good at winning

2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:33.240
 Uh, and actually being able to communicate those skills and knowledge to

2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:37.080
 To a vast amount of people is two completely different things

2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:40.360
 George advice for young people

2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:42.760
 like yourself

2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:43.960
 well

2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:46.680
 First I would I would tell them find

2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:49.960
 What you want to become what you want to do

2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:52.600
 and long term

2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:57.720
 Use certain things maybe sometime you don't love but where you want to propel yourself in the future

2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:03.160
 Not what your parent your your friend wants you to become what you you you want to become

2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:06.040
 So once once you find it

2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:08.360
 You cannot

2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:15.000
 Doing it by yourself everything that are that is big achievement in life. We cannot do it doing it by ourselves

2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.320
 So what I would say is second thing is

2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:22.520
 Try to build up your team and try to build up your team to be able to achieve your goal

2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:25.960
 Of people that are competent

2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:28.680
 And people that you trust

2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:30.680
 You need both competency and trust

2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:35.000
 I sell out of people some time in business. For example, they hire people they

2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:38.920
 That are that they trust but they turns out to be incompetent

2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:42.760
 So now you have to fire a friend or otherwise your business going down

2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:47.720
 It's the same problem if you do the opposite you hire someone that is competent, but you cannot trust is gonna

2:48:47.960 --> 2:48:49.960
 Is gonna screw you, you know

2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:55.480
 So it's very important to stay away from the negative build up your team people you trust and that are competent

2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:00.760
 And I would say the third one is to work to work hard to

2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:04.360
 Sacrifice yourself. Yeah, you have to go through hell sometime

2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:07.880
 But yeah, you have to see the light at the end of it, you know to

2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:12.040
 Keep your dream in mind is going to give you the motivation to go through the tough time

2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:16.040
 It's nothing easy to go work work work is nothing you can accomplish without hard work

2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:18.040
 Work

2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:20.280
 The fourth one I would say

2:49:20.440 --> 2:49:22.440
 To invest on yourself constantly

2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:27.160
 If you do not invest on yourself on whatever you are in which business and sport

2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:29.720
 The game will catch up to you

2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:31.800
 For example, if you're if you become

2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:39.160
 Champion at something and if you stop improving the other guys that are trying to be champion, they're gonna catch up to you

2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:42.360
 So you need to invest on yourself and most people

2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:45.720
 Most athletes they make the mistake when they start to having money

2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:48.600
 They buy luxury stuff

2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:51.400
 And that's one thing I didn't do when I start making money

2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:56.280
 I was investing of on traveling to new york train with john gordon and the guys to learn

2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:02.040
 What is new in the the game of jiu jitsu? I used to go in thailand train muay thai

2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:07.160
 In las angeles to perfect my boxing skill

2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:14.440
 So instead of taking that money to buy me jewelry cars and to do what a lot of guys do because it's a mistake

2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:19.560
 I I invest it on myself because I know there were people coming. They don't want my place

2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:21.560
 So I want I didn't want them to catch me

2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.240
 And the last one I would say it seems weird

2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:28.200
 I would say

2:50:28.200 --> 2:50:35.000
 To give back and it's not because I'm a nice guy and it's not that I don't say that to look good. I say that

2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.320
 But when you you make it

2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:43.480
 It creates opportunity where you can help certain group of people

2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:48.200
 But when I say give back not give back to everybody to anybody

2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:52.520
 Give back only to the the cause that you want I give back

2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:55.400
 Not because I'm a nice guy. I'm kind of it's kind of selfish

2:50:55.400 --> 2:50:57.800
 I only give back to the people that I want to give back

2:50:58.680 --> 2:51:02.280
 Because I give back to them and I know that if I'm more successful

2:51:02.280 --> 2:51:07.560
 I'm going to be able to give back to people I loved the cause that that that count for me

2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:11.640
 So it's it brings me more motivation because I don't compete

2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:16.040
 For myself anymore. I compete to help people I love in a way

2:51:16.760 --> 2:51:19.720
 So at when you you reach the top in your game

2:51:20.200 --> 2:51:23.480
 You need to find new motivation if you're satisfied is

2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:29.480
 Is the end of it your success will go down. So you need to to find new motivation

2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:34.520
 What can motivate you? You know, what do you want? Oh, I want to help this or I need to to be successful

2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:35.720
 I want to

2:51:35.720 --> 2:51:39.880
 You know, you need to find reason who you what do you want to do with your success?

2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:45.720
 So when I say give back, it's not because I'm not because I'm necessarily it's not to be to look like a nice guy

2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:48.840
 To keep your motivation to be able to

2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:51.480
 Keep climbing the ladder even more

2:51:52.840 --> 2:51:54.840
 That's beautiful, George

2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:56.200
 John

2:51:56.200 --> 2:51:57.080
 um

2:51:57.080 --> 2:52:02.680
 First off the two responses given so far covered. I think the most important things or already

2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:06.120
 Gordon talked about the the need for

2:52:06.680 --> 2:52:10.280
 An underlying passion and enjoyment if you don't have that

2:52:10.840 --> 2:52:14.040
 You're not going to have the longevity that is required in order to build

2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:18.600
 Skills which is ultimately everything's going to come down to your ability to build skills

2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:23.400
 You've got to have some kind of underlying passion and enjoyment which will keep you in the game long enough

2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:30.280
 To build world championship skills. It's going to take a minimum of five years and quite possibly considerably longer than that

2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:36.120
 Um, George talked about the idea of community. You're not going to make it by yourself

2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:43.000
 So you've got to be able to build people around you and and build a trusting environment around you to develop those skills

2:52:43.640 --> 2:52:45.000
 um

2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:48.840
 What I would add to the the excellent points that both already raised

2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:52.120
 Alludes to what I said at the start of this podcast

2:52:52.120 --> 2:52:54.120
 You've got to be able to identify

2:52:55.160 --> 2:52:57.160
 some kind of undervalued

2:52:57.880 --> 2:53:02.760
 Elements in whatever industry you're in and show the world what their true value is

2:53:03.880 --> 2:53:05.640
 in addition

2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:07.640
 You can't go through life

2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:10.520
 Doing the same things as everybody else

2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:13.080
 And expecting to get different results

2:53:13.480 --> 2:53:19.400
 This is straightforwardly irrational and worse. It's even arrogant. It's essentially the statement that

2:53:19.400 --> 2:53:23.080
 I'm going to do the same thing as everyone else, but I believe I'm different

2:53:23.800 --> 2:53:25.800
 And so they'll work for me

2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:27.880
 But they didn't work for everyone else

2:53:27.960 --> 2:53:29.960
 That's like saying no, I'm special

2:53:30.280 --> 2:53:33.240
 No, you're not special. We're all pretty much the same

2:53:33.960 --> 2:53:40.200
 And um in order to be special you're going to have to exhibit skills that other people simply don't have

2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:43.000
 um

2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:47.400
 Thirdly, I would say if you want to become something truly impressive in life

2:53:47.400 --> 2:53:51.000
 You've got to be able to focus on one or two things

2:53:51.720 --> 2:53:54.120
 That you do better than anyone else in your industry

2:53:55.640 --> 2:53:57.240
 You can't learn everything

2:53:57.240 --> 2:54:02.120
 But you can get one or two skills and the more innovative those skills are the better

2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:07.400
 And you can truly excel at them. For example at the peak of his career

2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:13.160
 No one in the world was better than George St. Pierre at integrating striking and takedowns

2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:18.200
 No one in the world was better at integrating grappling and striking on the ground

2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:26.120
 He had two things that he could confidently say he was the best in the world at. Was he the best at every MMA skill? Nope

2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:28.280
 but he was

2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:34.040
 Absolutely the best at those two skills and those two skills were skills which he used throughout his career to win

2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:36.520
 The vast majority of his matches

2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:39.960
 Gordon Ryan at the onset of his career could confidently say

2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:42.760
 There's no one in the world better than me at leg locks

2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:48.040
 He could also say there's no one better in the world than me at late stage defense

2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:56.360
 To submission holds across the board as he went through his career. He started adding more and more elements

2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:02.840
 It's gotten to an extraordinary degree now where you could absolutely say he's the best at guard passing the best at guard retention

2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:06.280
 The list just keeps going on and that goes back to what

2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:08.120
 um

2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:13.160
 Gordon said earlier about keeping things interesting over time because we're always introducing new skill sets

2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:15.480
 The day you start saying

2:55:15.480 --> 2:55:18.440
 I'm satisfied with my skill set is the day you get bored

2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:22.520
 and bored boredom to an athlete is a precursor to

2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:26.120
 death by boredom

2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:29.800
 As long as you're still growing in those directions, you'll stay in the game

2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:34.440
 For very long periods of time. So the main thing I would add to these

2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:39.080
 Uh, uh statements by gordon and george is this idea of

2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:43.720
 Finding something which is currently undervalued and showing the world what its true value is

2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:47.800
 Understanding

2:55:47.800 --> 2:55:54.360
 That you can't just use the same training methodologies as everyone else and somehow expect to be different from everyone else

2:55:54.680 --> 2:55:55.800
 You've got a

2:55:55.800 --> 2:56:01.080
 Almost every great rise in human civilization whether it be groups of people or individuals

2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:06.760
 Required some kind of innovation. You've got to look for that new angle. Okay, george st

2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:09.080
 Pierre found that was shootboxing early on in his career

2:56:09.720 --> 2:56:15.160
 Uh, gordon ryan found it with leg locks early on in his career and they branched out from that uh from that angle

2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:24.680
 Add to this the idea that you want to become the absolute best in the world in your industry

2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:27.320
 In one or two things that make a difference

2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:32.040
 Find out what they are and focus on those things and you'll go far

2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:38.760
 John gordon george, this is an incredible conversation. Thank you so much for your

2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:43.720
 Extremely valuable time george as somebody who's uh become famous in part

2:56:44.680 --> 2:56:46.680
 By commenting on people's performance

2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:53.400
 Um, how do you think we did? How would you evaluate our performance today?

2:56:53.400 --> 2:57:01.800
 Uh, I'm not impressed by you. Thank you. I love that. I I've learned all the time. I've talked to you guys. I'm

2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:05.240
 It's it's great. I love it. It was very

2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:11.800
 Stimulated I and really enjoyed it. Yeah, it's uh, it was it was something I really was looking forward to

2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:13.800
 I was hoping that would get together

2:57:14.040 --> 2:57:17.080
 It's so rare that at the same time in history

2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:21.560
 There will be some of the greats together and the fact that you guys would be willing to come together and talk like this

2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:26.760
 This is awesome and that gordon. He would even work cowboy hat. I mean, this is just historic

2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:31.960
 This is like church. You're all getting together with whoever, you know, this is great and all but the next one is just

2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:37.480
 Going to be us just quizzing john on which animals would win in fights. Yes for the whole three hours

2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:42.200
 It'll be just so we'll invite joe, and you'll just be we'll we'll make it as systematic

2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:48.040
 It'll be a debate between joe and john on which animal would win john and i we have a thing that we sent each other

2:57:48.040 --> 2:57:51.160
 Footage all the time of animal fight. We're

2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:55.480
 We are very intrigued about animal fight

2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:01.160
 I get to know like 3 30 a.m. On instagram. He's like check this out

2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:04.360
 Like a rhino taking a like a pig like

2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:10.120
 Like like literally it's not always fair. No, no, it's not ever but interesting stuff

2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:15.640
 If people would see what we send the stuff that we that would judge you harshly

2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:16.840
 Yeah

2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:19.400
 Yeah, all right. All right. Thanks so much guys. This was awesome

2:58:20.520 --> 2:58:26.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with george st. Pierre john donahar and gordon ryan

 And now let me leave you some words from Miyamoto musashi

2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:39.800
 There's nothing outside yourself that can ever enable you to get better

2:58:40.440 --> 2:58:43.240
 stronger richer quicker or smarter

2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:46.520
 Everything is within everything exists

2:58:47.320 --> 2:58:49.320
 Seek nothing outside of yourself

2:58:49.320 --> 2:59:13.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
