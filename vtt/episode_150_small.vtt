00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
 The following is a conversation with Michael Malis, his second time on the podcast.

00:05.040 --> 00:12.560
 He's an anarchist, political thinker, podcaster, and author. He wrote Dear Reader, which is a book

00:12.560 --> 00:19.120
 on North Korea, and The New Right, a book on the various ideological movements at the fringe

00:19.120 --> 00:26.720
 of American politics. He hosts the podcast called You're Welcome, spelled Y O U R, and in general,

00:26.720 --> 00:33.680
 there's a lot of live shows on YouTube that are at times profoundly absurd, and at other times

00:33.680 --> 00:40.960
 absurdly profound, and always full of humor and wisdom. He has the Joker to my Batman,

00:40.960 --> 00:48.320
 and the Caviar to my vodka. His masterful dance between dark humor and difficult, even

00:48.320 --> 00:55.280
 dangerous ideas challenges me to think deeply about this world. And when that fails, at least smile

00:55.280 --> 01:01.840
 and have a good laugh at the absurdity of it all. This episode has much of that. His outfit, for

01:01.840 --> 01:11.920
 example, the exact inverse of mine with a white suit and a black shirt is just one example of that,

01:12.720 --> 01:20.400
 of the humor, trolling, and brilliance that is Michael Malis. Quick mention of our sponsors,

01:20.400 --> 01:26.800
 NetSuite, Business Management Software, Athletic Greens, All In One Nutrition Drink,

01:27.840 --> 01:38.000
 Sun Basket, Meal Delivery Service, and Cash App. So the choice is success, health, food, or money.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.680
 Choose wisely, my friends. And if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a discount and to

01:43.680 --> 01:50.880
 support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that Michael is, in many ways, a man of radical

01:50.880 --> 01:57.840
 ideas, but also a man with kindness in his heart. Those two things are great ingredients for a

01:57.840 --> 02:03.360
 fascinating conversation. I hope to have several such people on this podcast this upcoming year

02:03.360 --> 02:09.840
 who also have radical ideas about politics, science, technology, and life. At times,

02:09.840 --> 02:14.240
 often, perhaps, I might fail at asking the challenging questions that should be asked,

02:14.800 --> 02:20.240
 but I will try my best to do so and hope to keep improving every time. Mostly,

02:20.240 --> 02:26.080
 I come to these conversations with an open mind and with love. Unfortunately, that kind of approach

02:26.080 --> 02:31.920
 can be taken advantage of in many ways. It can be used by reporters or just people online later

02:31.920 --> 02:39.840
 to highlight how or why I'm ignorant or worse. I'm generally not a good human being. In the context

02:39.840 --> 02:46.400
 of this, I have two options. I could either be cautious and afraid, or second, be kind, thoughtful,

02:46.400 --> 02:52.800
 and fearless. I choose the latter, hopefully while still being open, fragile, and empathetic.

02:53.440 --> 02:59.280
 Again, I strive to be like the main character of The Idiot by Dostoyevsky. That's my New

02:59.280 --> 03:05.760
 Year's resolution. Be kind and do difficult things, difficult conversations, difficult

03:05.760 --> 03:11.840
 research projects, and difficult entrepreneurial adventures. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe

 I'll connect with me on Twitter at Lex Freedman. And now, here's my conversation with Michael

03:23.600 --> 03:29.920
 Malis. Knock, knock. You're stealing my bed? I'll kill your family.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.640
 That's not how a knock, knock joke works. Knock, knock, Michael. You don't do knock,

03:36.640 --> 03:41.840
 knock jokes with Russians because then we have to knock at the door. Turn down the TV.

03:42.560 --> 03:48.160
 You got to sit quiet. I hope they go away. You don't do that back in the Netherlands.

03:48.160 --> 03:55.200
 You know this. It's triggering. Who's there? I can't even do it now. Knock, knock. Who's there?

03:56.240 --> 04:02.400
 Leon. Leon who? Leon me when you're not strong, Michael. Well, that will never happen.

04:03.600 --> 04:10.000
 I stole elegantly, eloquently that joke from you. The lie detector term, that was a lie.

04:10.000 --> 04:18.640
 Elegantly and eloquently. Yeah, you crossed it on a sheet of paper. That means it's real.

04:18.640 --> 04:25.600
 The reason I bring it up is because you had the guts, the brilliance to do a knock, knock joke,

04:25.600 --> 04:29.760
 not once, but three times with Alex Jones. I think it was like six. I had a runner.

04:30.320 --> 04:35.760
 Okay. Maybe I just, they started to sort of melt together in this beautiful art form that you've

04:35.760 --> 04:42.000
 created, which is like these kind, loving knock, knock jokes with Alex Jones. So you got a chance

04:42.000 --> 04:50.400
 to meet him and talk with him twice with a tempul in a long form conversation. What was it like

04:51.280 --> 04:58.240
 talking to Alex Jones, both on the deep philosophical intellectual level and staring the man

04:58.240 --> 05:06.320
 in his eyes and doing a knock, knock joke about Olive, knock, knock. Who's there? Olive. I love

05:06.320 --> 05:13.840
 you, Alex. I love you. Well, there's a lot to explain. Where do you start? I've been on his show

05:13.840 --> 05:19.280
 Info Wars a few times when I was researching my book, then you write. So I had had conversations

05:19.280 --> 05:23.920
 with him before. One of the things that I appreciate about Alex is he is a lot more

05:23.920 --> 05:31.440
 self aware than people think and has a good sense of humor. And I also like a good twist ending.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.080
 So if you set people up and all these jokes are these kind of vapid, all of you jokes,

05:38.080 --> 05:41.840
 and the last ones about building seven, they're not going to see that one coming,

05:41.840 --> 05:45.040
 nor will he see that one coming. I even had another one about Sandy Hook,

05:45.040 --> 05:50.000
 which I didn't do on the air because he was being like a good sport, but that was the dagger,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.680
 that was kind of behind my back if necessary. But it was a good mechanism toward, I like

05:55.680 --> 06:01.920
 it when things work on several levels. It was also a good mechanism to keep kind of the conversation

06:01.920 --> 06:07.040
 guarded and this every so often this is kind of hitting the control, delete and bring it down

06:08.880 --> 06:14.240
 to a certain point of calmness. What about the love thing? I mean, you're saying that that was

06:14.240 --> 06:22.480
 a build up to the dagger, but it was also somehow really refreshing to get that little jolt like

06:22.480 --> 06:27.920
 that pause. You don't get that in conversations often. Like I'm a huge fan of Rogan and he'll

06:27.920 --> 06:34.640
 have a three hour conversation, but at some point just pause and be like, I love you, man.

06:35.440 --> 06:43.120
 Like it's in the cheesiest way possible because that seems to be, it somehow hits the hardest then.

06:43.120 --> 06:47.680
 I don't know. I don't know you didn't intend it that way, but with Alex Jones to sit there

06:47.680 --> 06:55.840
 and to say, I love you, that was like, I just haven't never heard that before. And so it struck

06:55.840 --> 07:01.680
 me as like, not just funny for what you're doing, but just like, whoa, we just took, because

07:01.680 --> 07:06.000
 conversations are all about like this ranting, especially with Alex Jones, just like ranting

07:06.000 --> 07:10.320
 about this or that, this part of the world, like, can you believe this shit, that kind of thing,

07:10.320 --> 07:14.880
 but like to pause and be like, this is awesome. I don't know if you felt that way, but...

07:14.880 --> 07:18.320
 Oh, I definitely felt that way. So it was actually very fun. I'll give you the backstory of how that

07:18.320 --> 07:25.920
 happened. It was silly because Tim calls me up and there's this expression in marketing,

07:25.920 --> 07:29.840
 don't go past the sale, right? So if you're trying to sell someone a car and you're like,

07:29.840 --> 07:33.120
 it's got this feature, this feature, and that feature, and they're like, you know what? I'm

07:33.120 --> 07:38.480
 going to buy the car. If you keep talking, you can only make them lose the sale. You just get

07:38.480 --> 07:45.840
 them to sign it and get out of dodge. So Tim calls me up and he goes, okay, here's what we're thinking.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.680
 This is top secret. Alex is going to be on the show. We want you on as well. And I've never

07:51.680 --> 07:56.800
 said yes to anything as quickly in my life. And then he keeps talking and I'm like, Tim,

07:56.800 --> 07:59.920
 this, you don't have to sell it. I interrupted him. I go, you don't have to sell it.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.880
 Why are you, by the way?

08:00.880 --> 08:09.600
 I think because I am kind of an agent of chaos. And Alex is, in his own way, an agent of chaos.

08:10.160 --> 08:16.000
 And what provides an opportunity in this kind of new media space that you and I travel in,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.720
 it's the kind of things where none of us three, as we said on the show,

08:20.720 --> 08:28.640
 knew what it would be like. You know, within certain parameters, what Megan Kelly or Wolf

08:28.640 --> 08:33.600
 Blitzer or any of these corporate figures are going to be like in a conversation to some extent,

08:33.600 --> 08:37.680
 none of us had any idea. Now, I knew they didn't know I was bringing enough jokes.

08:38.880 --> 08:45.200
 So that was kind of what was so, I said at one point, I'm kind of envious of the audience

08:45.200 --> 08:50.240
 because there's so many exciting things that are happening and that the internet

08:50.240 --> 08:54.880
 and podcasting provides people an opportunity to do that. It was great.

08:54.880 --> 09:01.760
 Yeah. That was the greatest pairing with Alex Jones that I've ever seen by far.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.200
 Wow. Okay. Thank you.

09:03.200 --> 09:09.600
 So I immediately knew, no, this isn't a knock on Tim, but I don't even know if Tim was prepared.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.600
 Tim was not prepared for this.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.640
 How could he be prepared?

09:13.360 --> 09:18.880
 Well, so I mean, I don't know if Tim is used to that. I think Joe Rogan is more equipped,

09:18.880 --> 09:23.440
 prepared for the chaos, just the years he's been in it. I immediately thought,

09:23.440 --> 09:28.480
 this is the right pairing for Joe Rogan. Because Alex Jones has been on Joe Rogan

09:29.040 --> 09:33.280
 a few times, three times. My favorite so far was with Tim Dillon.

09:33.280 --> 09:43.040
 Right. But Tim was clearly, Tim Dillon was also kind of a genius in his own right,

09:43.040 --> 09:50.560
 but he was kind of a fan and he was stepping away. He was almost like in awe of Alex Jones,

09:50.560 --> 10:00.160
 where you were both, you were in awe of the experience that's being created and at the

10:00.160 --> 10:05.600
 same time, fearlessly just trolling the situation. I mean, to do a knock knock joke,

10:05.600 --> 10:09.840
 to stop me, that just shows that you're in control of the experience. No, you're like

10:09.840 --> 10:15.920
 riding the experience. That immediately was like, this needs to be on Rogan. So I hope that

10:15.920 --> 10:22.160
 that happens as well. You're on your own, of course, on Rogan, but just you, that's an experience.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.160
 That's the, whatever, this gotta be a good name for it. Like Jimi Hendrix experience,

10:26.160 --> 10:31.440
 there's no microphone else. Because that was a ban. It's taken. Well, I don't know how many years

10:31.440 --> 10:38.480
 you can restart the experience. Because I feel, sorry to interrupt you, I feel a very big

10:38.480 --> 10:47.280
 responsibility, especially in 2020, to provide fun and something cool and something unique

10:47.280 --> 10:53.280
 that hasn't been done before for the audience. I think this has been a very rough year on our

10:53.280 --> 10:59.520
 audiences psychologically and in other aspects of their lives. So I feel if I'm going to be there,

10:59.520 --> 11:04.720
 I'm going to put on a show. And it's also going to be great because it also alienates the people

11:04.720 --> 11:08.800
 you don't want, right? So there's a lot of people who sit there and be like, oh, he's telling not,

11:09.440 --> 11:13.600
 people who are too cool for school, where they're like, oh, he's telling knock knock jokes. This

11:13.600 --> 11:22.160
 is stupid. I'm like, good. If you have an issue with having eaten cotton candy or doing a puzzle

11:22.160 --> 11:28.080
 with a kid or without it, you know, by yourself, that's on you. And it's something very, something

11:28.080 --> 11:33.200
 I think is the enemy of cynicism and this idea that like, oh, this is too silly and amethyst.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.760
 Like we need that kind of childlike aspect in our lives. I think it's something we could use more

11:37.760 --> 11:43.280
 of. It's very much an aspect of our media culture that to kind of have a condemnatory about that

11:43.280 --> 11:48.640
 or to do it in a certain very corporate, fake way. So it is something I encourage a lot,

11:48.640 --> 11:55.360
 something I enjoy doing. And again, like with the first time I was on Tim, I had a propeller

11:55.360 --> 12:00.240
 beanie on, you know, with the motorized and a lot of people were like, I can't take anyone seriously

12:00.240 --> 12:06.160
 who dresses like this. I go, good. If you judge someone's ideas by how they appear instead of

12:06.160 --> 12:11.040
 the ideas themselves, you're not someone I want on my team. Are we going to address

12:12.880 --> 12:17.920
 the outfit you're wearing? We can address it, sure. You know, for those who are colorblind,

12:20.080 --> 12:27.120
 Michael's wearing the, or just listening to this, Michael's wearing the exact opposite,

12:27.120 --> 12:33.040
 the inverse from, from another dimension outfit, which is a white suit and black shirt.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.760
 It's so genius. Okay. So you just see the next two looks I've planned.

12:38.400 --> 12:42.480
 Oh no. Yeah, they're great. Well, obviously this relationship is going to end today.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.520
 It's over. I'll put them on Instagram.

12:47.120 --> 12:53.760
 Okay. Is there some deep philosophy to the humor? Is, let's go through our trolling discussion.

12:53.760 --> 13:02.000
 And is there some, is there like chapters to this genius, or is this just what makes you

13:02.000 --> 13:06.720
 smile in the morning? Well, I mean, I think you're honestly, in this case, you think we're genius

13:06.720 --> 13:13.040
 a little loosely. I don't think this is particularly genius. But I do think it is fun. It is exuberant.

13:13.040 --> 13:23.200
 It is joyous. I think the bigger my audience has gotten, and the more I actually communicate with,

13:23.200 --> 13:28.640
 you know, fans, I do feel it kind of kicks in these paternal maternal instincts. It's,

13:28.640 --> 13:32.480
 which is very, very odd. I did not expect to have them. What do you mean? Who's the dad?

13:32.480 --> 13:37.200
 I'm the dad and the mom. I remember, and it may have been similar for you. I'm curious to hear it.

13:37.200 --> 13:43.520
 For young, smart, like ambitious men, like 24 to 27, for me was a very rough period,

13:43.520 --> 13:46.960
 because that's the window where a lot of people get married and they kind of check out.

13:47.520 --> 13:52.480
 And if you're very much kind of finding your own road, you don't know what's happening,

13:52.480 --> 13:57.760
 no one's in a position to really guide you or help you. And it's tough. It's a very tough window.

13:58.320 --> 14:05.440
 And what I'm finding now is having these kids who are in that position, but now instead of them

14:05.440 --> 14:09.920
 stumbling along, for some of them, I'm the one who could be like, no, no, no, no, it's not you,

14:09.920 --> 14:17.680
 it's everybody else. And to be able to give them that semblance of feeling seen, to use a cliched

14:17.680 --> 14:24.240
 expression, to feel normal and that, no, no, you're the heroes here. They're the background noise.

14:25.360 --> 14:30.160
 It's just really very flattering and humbling to be in that position.

14:30.160 --> 14:36.720
 You have many minds, right? There's the thoughtful kind. Michael, there's like, I'm going to burn

14:36.720 --> 14:46.400
 down the powerful Michael. And then there's like, I'm going to have this just lighthearted trolling

14:46.400 --> 14:54.960
 of the world. Which of those are most important to the 24th and to the 27th demographic?

14:54.960 --> 15:02.080
 I think it is the combination. It's like if you're making a meal, chicken kia,

15:02.080 --> 15:08.400
 you need the chicken, you need the ham, you need the butter sauce. Because I think people,

15:09.440 --> 15:14.960
 when you're young, you need to see someone who's fought the fight for you and who's won.

15:14.960 --> 15:20.320
 So it's very easy to be defeatist. So this is what winning looks like?

15:21.200 --> 15:26.640
 No, this is not. This is most assuredly what winning does not look like. But in my normal

15:26.640 --> 15:32.880
 clothes, a little bit more. This is a good time to mention that clothes wise, you're wearing

15:32.880 --> 15:38.640
 sheath underwear and people should buy sheath underwear, use code malis20.

15:38.640 --> 15:43.760
 If you go to sheathunderwear.com, use promo code malis20. What I love about that, why I'm glad to

15:43.760 --> 15:48.160
 promote the product and wear it. It's the most comfortable underwear I've ever worn. And you

15:48.160 --> 15:53.360
 have a separate pouch for both parts of your genitals. That's what I thought there was a punch

15:53.360 --> 15:58.000
 line coming. No, it's a very nice aspect of the product. Yeah. But I think what here's something

15:58.000 --> 16:01.280
 else just as it goes back to what we're just talking about, there are so many, and this is

16:01.280 --> 16:07.120
 going to segue into this, there are so many small companies who have been devastated this year.

16:07.120 --> 16:12.880
 We have not seen a sustained attack on mom and pop shops, like we've seen in 2020,

16:12.880 --> 16:18.640
 who are innovators and making something happen. And when you're just like one dude who's

16:19.840 --> 16:24.880
 producing a product, they're a sponsor of mine. I'm happy. First of all, it's funny that I'm

16:24.880 --> 16:29.520
 pitching underwear, but I'm pitching, but it's also something I enjoy. And also you said small

16:29.520 --> 16:35.040
 business. Yeah. It's microscopic, like a thimble. So this isn't a sponsor of mine, but this is a

16:35.040 --> 16:40.000
 good segue. So this is Russians we celebrate New Year's. It's Novom Glodom. We have Died

16:40.000 --> 16:45.440
 Modoz. He comes down, puts a present under your pillow. So this is a company called JL Lawson.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.800
 He's a fan of yours. He's a metalworker. And he said, can I give you something to give to Lex?

16:50.800 --> 16:54.960
 I have one of his worry coins. I'll tell you what it is. He's not a sponsor. This is not,

16:54.960 --> 16:58.800
 I'm not getting paid for this. So what a worry coin is, I carry it around in my butt. If you

16:58.800 --> 17:02.800
 have raw denim, it's great because it brings you fades. So you carry it around with you all the time.

17:02.800 --> 17:09.760
 It says worrying is like paying a debt you don't owe, right? And I carry this around and

17:10.720 --> 17:13.840
 for the longest time, like a year. Next time you're worrying, and this is a good advice

17:13.840 --> 17:19.680
 if you don't have a worry coin, go think about 10 years ago and what you were worried about then.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.560
 And then think about, did any of those things pan out? And some of them did, but you were able

17:24.560 --> 17:30.400
 to handle it. And that's a good way to maintain perspective. So JL Lawson is the company. He

17:30.400 --> 17:34.560
 sent me this present. I said, let me give it to Lex on the air. So enjoy.

17:34.560 --> 17:40.960
 Sorry, I was so open on that. JL Lawson and Co. Two Lex from Anthony.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.400
 Yeah. And I said, make something mathematical for Lex. I don't even know what's in there.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.120
 You don't know what's in there? No. And it got through his TSA.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.120
 Could be a bomb. It could be. Just like this episode.

17:51.120 --> 17:58.560
 Make sure you unwrap it close to the mic because it drives you for crazy. That's really the best part.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.040
 Or is this what an unboxing video looks like?

18:07.040 --> 18:10.160
 This conversation is going to be a big hit on the internet.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.520
 With the unboxing community.

18:12.800 --> 18:17.680
 I need to have an excited look on my face to make sure that the reaction video is being

18:17.680 --> 18:24.640
 unboxing and a reaction video. Lex Freeman reacts. It's another box. It's just a series of boxes.

18:25.520 --> 18:32.240
 Lex, big fan since hearing you on Rogan months ago. Most of your guests are over my head,

18:32.240 --> 18:39.200
 but still enjoyable. Aw. Like this episode. Michael was kind enough to want to share my work

18:39.200 --> 18:47.280
 with you. Keep doing what you do. Anthony Lawson. Thanks, Anthony. There's a lot in there.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.280
 What is in there? Give me some. I'll open some. Okay. All right. Bye, bye, bye, bye.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.640
 Show it to the camera and then make sure you look excited or not or disappointed. No,

18:56.640 --> 19:00.320
 this is cool. This is a worry coin like I was showing you. Oh, nice. So you hold it in your

19:00.320 --> 19:04.080
 hand and when you can do this with your thumb, people have anxiety or whatever.

19:04.800 --> 19:09.360
 Aw, there's a lot of cool stuff in here. Fibonacci coin. Oh, so yeah, that's the math stuff.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.400
 That's really awesome. This is really cool. Wait, you got a big one lying there too.

19:14.400 --> 19:22.800
 That's what she said. I'm telling you, last time you offended me saying I don't have humor.

19:28.560 --> 19:34.880
 The spin tray micro brass and copper bronze. By the way, the packaging is epic.

19:34.880 --> 19:44.640
 I think that's his top. He makes tops. Cool. Yeah, you spin it in there.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.360
 And it's a two different bronze and copper.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.640
 I think he's the only one who makes these machined tops.

19:53.200 --> 19:58.080
 And then they sit in here, I guess. Yeah, but you could spin them in that section.

19:58.080 --> 20:03.520
 Got it. Cool. Where's the where's the worry thing? Here's the worry coin.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.480
 All right. Anyway, I wasn't listening. What were you worried about 10 years ago?

20:07.120 --> 20:11.040
 10 years ago, 2010. What would I have been worried about then?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.680
 The government? No, that's not a worry.

20:14.640 --> 20:21.440
 What was the North Korea book? That came out in 2014. I went there in 2012.

20:22.400 --> 20:27.520
 Came out in January 2014. It still pays my rent with the royalties.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.680
 The North Korea book. Yeah. This is why it's so much better.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.360
 I got to talk to you about self publishing because you brought that up.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.120
 I'm doing the next books also going to be self published.

20:39.120 --> 20:45.040
 Can we talk about self publishing? What's the whole idea of publishing,

20:45.040 --> 20:49.760
 like having a publisher and an agent? There's a bunch of people have been reaching out to me

20:49.760 --> 20:52.160
 trying to give me to write a book, which is ridiculous.

20:52.160 --> 20:57.440
 Why? There's people who are brilliant folks like you, like Jordan Peterson,

20:57.440 --> 21:00.080
 that I think have a lot of knowledge to share with the world.

21:00.080 --> 21:08.160
 Okay. I think what I feel I can contribute to the world in terms of impact is to build something.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.840
 Okay. Meaning like engineering stuff.

21:11.840 --> 21:16.160
 Okay. A book has to be engineered and I'm not using it loosely.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.600
 You have to engineer a book.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.680
 No, for sure. What I mean is literally a product with programming and artificial

21:21.680 --> 21:27.760
 intelligence. I want to build a company I want to, because I have a few ideas that I feel I'm

21:27.760 --> 21:34.160
 equipped and it has to do with your intuition about the way you can build a better world.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.400
 You individually, like what can you add to the world? That's a positive thing.

21:38.400 --> 21:45.360
 And for me, I feel like the maximal thing I can add to the world is at least to attempt

21:45.360 --> 21:49.280
 to build products that would add more love in the world.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.320
 And like, so I want to focus on that. The danger of the book for me,

21:52.320 --> 21:58.320
 or any kind of writing, and even this podcast is a little bit dangerous for me, is like,

21:58.880 --> 21:59.680
 it's fun. That's for sure.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.880
 It's fun. It takes you into this place where you start thinking about the world.

22:06.880 --> 22:13.280
 You start enjoying and playing with ideas. You start, just your book on a dear reader,

22:14.640 --> 22:20.480
 but also the new write. Clearly, you and I probably think similarly in the sense that

22:20.480 --> 22:24.960
 that you did a lot of work. Yes. This next book is killing me.

22:24.960 --> 22:32.560
 Yeah. As you mentioned often, it's clear, like on your YouTube channel, which I'm a fan of,

22:33.200 --> 22:37.440
 you often, it just comes out like you mentioned all of these books that you're reading,

22:37.440 --> 22:42.880
 it just comes through you that you're suffering through this and it changes you.

22:43.520 --> 22:48.800
 And it's clear that you're thinking deeply about the world because of this book.

22:48.800 --> 22:54.640
 And I feel like if you do that, that's like, when I first came to this country,

22:54.640 --> 23:01.920
 I read the book The Giver, I need to read it again. It's like, the red pill thing is it changes you

23:01.920 --> 23:07.520
 in where you can never be the same person again. And I feel about a book in that same way.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.880
 The moment you write a book, of course, it depends on the book.

23:10.880 --> 23:15.760
 I could also just write, in my field, a very technical book.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.800
 No, that's a terrible idea.

23:16.800 --> 23:22.240
 Yes. But that's okay. That doesn't really change you. That's just like sharing information.

23:22.240 --> 23:26.480
 But like something where you're like, how do I think about this world?

23:26.480 --> 23:28.480
 Can you just leave that behind you?

23:28.480 --> 23:32.720
 I get it. Dude, it's being pregnant. It never escapes your brain. I'm telling you.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.000
 Yeah. You're absolutely right.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.320
 Yeah. I don't know. It does seem to change you. But the reason I bring that up is because there's

23:38.320 --> 23:45.680
 this whole industry of people that seem to not really contribute much to the publication process.

23:45.680 --> 23:51.520
 But they make themselves seem necessary for like, if you want to be in the New York Times,

23:51.520 --> 23:58.400
 bestseller list kind of thing, but also just being like reputable, which I'm allergic to

23:58.400 --> 24:04.000
 that whole concept. But do you think it's possible to be on the New York Times bestseller list

24:04.000 --> 24:08.560
 and be a reputable author and still be self published?

24:09.360 --> 24:12.640
 Not what you would want to do. Like people like Marxist, and I think it's his name,

24:12.640 --> 24:16.400
 he wrote like the primal blueprint. So like, if I'm getting the names correct,

24:16.400 --> 24:20.880
 he's the first paleo guy, right? So he self published it. It's those gangbusters.

24:21.600 --> 24:26.720
 But that would be on their health chart, I believe. And it's a little bit of a different

24:26.720 --> 24:32.640
 situation. You would be reaching much more for the mainstream. You'd be giving up a lot

24:32.640 --> 24:37.680
 if you go through a publisher, especially financially. But yeah, you are not going to

24:37.680 --> 24:43.200
 have the cred because the publishing is a cartel. The New York Times is part of this cartel.

24:43.840 --> 24:51.600
 And if you don't publish within this cartel, they will do what they can, as any cartel has to,

24:51.600 --> 24:58.240
 by necessity of being cartel, to pretend you don't exist. So I was, I think, the first one

24:58.240 --> 25:04.640
 to have an hour on BookTV for Dear Reader because that was a Kickstarter book. But this is something

25:04.640 --> 25:09.760
 that people... Dear Reader was a Kickstarter book. Yeah. This is something people would

25:10.720 --> 25:16.720
 have to be aware of. So you would be giving up a lot, but you'd also be giving a lot to work

25:16.720 --> 25:20.400
 with a publisher because you're losing like a year and a half of your life because they're

25:20.400 --> 25:24.640
 glacial and they don't care. Well, that's my main problem. It's not the money. I mean, the money is

25:24.640 --> 25:30.880
 whatever percent they take, 10, 20, 30, 50%. They're taking a huge chunk. So if I sell a book

25:30.880 --> 25:36.000
 through St. Martin's, it's a dollar. If I sell a book through Amazon, which is Dear Reader,

25:36.000 --> 25:42.400
 that's six dollars. So that's what, 87%, it's something crazy. But for me, what bothers me

25:42.400 --> 25:48.160
 isn't the money that, for me personally, for me, what bothers me is incompetence. Like whenever

25:48.160 --> 25:52.480
 I go to the DMV or something like that. Can I interrupt you? Yeah. Let's talk incompetence.

25:52.480 --> 26:02.960
 Yeah. New Right comes out last year. Yes. I get on Rogan, get on Ruben. I call them and I said,

26:02.960 --> 26:10.320
 I got in these shows, is there money in the budget for travel? And they say, we don't have that

26:10.320 --> 26:15.600
 budget? Fine. By the way, you got on those shows with no help from them. Oh yeah, that's not even

26:15.600 --> 26:19.760
 a question. The reason they would want you to do a book is because they know you could get,

26:19.760 --> 26:24.240
 the only reason people get book deals nowadays, literally, is because they know that person

26:24.240 --> 26:28.640
 can market their own book. That's the only way. And I got on Ruben, I got on Rogan,

26:29.200 --> 26:33.040
 and they would have the money for the budget for travel, which is fair. They can do Skype.

26:34.480 --> 26:39.920
 They told me this in writing. And I'm like, okay. And they can financially cover Skype.

26:41.040 --> 26:45.760
 No, but it's like, hey, Joe, yeah, we don't have the budget, but you're going to do Skype. Hello?

26:45.760 --> 26:55.280
 Hello? So there is another friend of mine was on a show on CNBC with Naseem Taleb.

26:56.320 --> 27:02.320
 And they said Naseem wants a copy of the book. And they're like, oh yeah, it's like four o clock

27:02.320 --> 27:09.840
 on Friday, so we're closed. And he's like, he went there, picked it up and walked it the two blocks.

27:09.840 --> 27:17.280
 So there is, it's almost cartoonish. Oh yeah. And it's not incompetence. It's

27:19.200 --> 27:25.120
 past that. It's something almost, you can't really believe that. I've had two friends who have been

27:25.120 --> 27:31.840
 literally rendered suicidal because this was such a huge opportunity for them. And it was like watching

27:31.840 --> 27:35.440
 their kid get beaten in front of them. And I had to talk them off the ledge. So it's,

27:35.440 --> 27:40.560
 it's people do not appreciate how bad. Here's another example. The apathy of bureaucracy,

27:40.560 --> 27:45.680
 something like that. I did this book, Concierge Confidential. There's a typo in the first

27:45.680 --> 27:50.720
 chapter. It ends with I'm about to, TOO. They didn't fix it for the paperback.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.640
 Okay. It's just like, wow, okay. Yeah. Great book, by the way. It got NPR gave it one of the books

27:58.640 --> 28:04.800
 of the year. So that was good. So why participate in this? Because otherwise, New York Times is

28:04.800 --> 28:10.960
 going to pretend you don't exist. Getting booked on some shows might be more difficult, although I

28:10.960 --> 28:18.960
 think that's collapsing in real time. You're not going to get reviewed necessarily on places like PW

28:20.080 --> 28:25.680
 or some others. So the new book you're working on, do you have a title yet? The White Pill.

28:28.320 --> 28:32.160
 Are you self publishing that? Oh yeah, for sure. And what's the thinking behind that?

28:32.160 --> 28:36.080
 Just because you already have a huge following and a big platform and

28:36.640 --> 28:42.800
 it's six times the cash. If I finished the book in December, I could have it out in February.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.480
 If I finished the book in December with the publisher, it's going to be out in

28:47.440 --> 28:52.240
 December at the earliest 2021. Why am I giving up 10 months of my life?

28:52.240 --> 28:57.360
 Well, this is the big one. Do you have any leverage? Do authors have leverage to say

28:57.360 --> 29:06.240
 FU? Can you just say... What do you mean? Meaning I want to release this book in two months.

29:06.240 --> 29:10.800
 Oh, no, no. I mean, you'll have a contract and then your agent can fight it, but they don't have

29:10.800 --> 29:18.240
 the capacity to rush things through. Yeah, I guess if the... Because I've heard big authors,

29:18.240 --> 29:23.440
 I don't know, Sam Harris, all those folks talk about... They've accepted it actually.

29:23.440 --> 29:28.160
 They've accepted it. They're like, yeah, it takes a long time to... I'm not accepting it.

29:28.880 --> 29:35.040
 But you're kind of implying that a human being like me should. I'm saying these are your options.

29:35.920 --> 29:43.920
 All right. I just hate it. I hate the waiting because it's incompetence. It's not necessarily

29:43.920 --> 29:53.200
 the weight. If it was the kind of people that are up at 2 a.m. at night on a Friday and they

29:53.200 --> 29:57.760
 love what you're doing and they're helping create something special, that's the sense I get with

29:57.760 --> 30:03.280
 some of the Netflix folks, for example, that work with people. I don't know anything about this world,

30:03.280 --> 30:10.000
 but you get like Netflix folks who help with shows. You could tell that they're obsessed

30:10.000 --> 30:14.720
 with those shows. Yeah, you're not going to get that publishing. I handed the book in,

30:14.720 --> 30:19.040
 I think it was July. I didn't hear anything from my editor until December.

30:19.040 --> 30:28.960
 Well, can we actually talk about the suffering, the darkest parts of writing a book? Let's go to

30:28.960 --> 30:35.360
 the full Michael Malis Stephen King mode of what are the darkest moments of writing this book and

30:35.360 --> 30:41.440
 what is it? Maybe start the white pill. What's the idea? What's the hope and what are your darkest

30:41.440 --> 30:46.880
 moments around writing this book? So people are familiar with the red pill and the blue pill,

30:46.880 --> 30:53.040
 therefore the matrix, the red pill is the idea that what is presented as fact by the corporate

30:53.040 --> 30:56.880
 press entertainment industry is in fact a carefully constructed narrative designed to

30:56.880 --> 31:03.120
 keep some very unpleasant people in power and everyone else under control. One of my expressions

31:03.120 --> 31:07.360
 is you take one red pill, not the whole bottle because at a certain point you think everything's

31:07.360 --> 31:12.240
 a lie and then you're kind of no capacity for distinguishing truths. You're full of good

31:12.240 --> 31:19.520
 one liners. Well, thank you. I'm full of something, that's for sure. And what I saw in this space

31:20.400 --> 31:28.880
 is a lot of these red pilled people got very disheartened and cynical. And one of my big heroes

31:28.880 --> 31:34.960
 is Albert Camus and he said the worst thing is citizen. And that's something called the black

31:34.960 --> 31:45.200
 pill, which is the idea that we're waiting for the end. It's hopeless. And I don't see it that way

31:45.200 --> 31:53.200
 at all. And I'm like, all right, I have to address this. And not just with some kind of cheerleading,

31:53.200 --> 32:00.400
 everything's gonna be great, guys. Here is why I am positive. And not that I'm positive the good

32:00.400 --> 32:07.520
 guys are gonna win, but I'm positive the good guys can win. And that's all you need because if your

32:08.480 --> 32:14.880
 God forbid kid is kidnapped and there's a 10% chance that you can save them, you're not gonna be

32:14.880 --> 32:21.280
 like, well, I don't like those odds. This is your country. This is your values. This is your family.

32:22.160 --> 32:28.880
 I don't think it's much more than 10%. And even if you lose, you will take pride in that you did

32:28.880 --> 32:35.680
 everything in your power to win. So is there a good definition of good guys in the sense that

32:35.680 --> 32:41.520
 the ones who wear white? There's layers to this. You're like modern day Shakespeare.

32:43.120 --> 32:53.360
 Is there a danger in thinking Adolf Hitler was probably pretty confident that he led a group

32:53.360 --> 33:00.640
 of good guys? Listen, if Hitler did anything wrong, why isn't he in jail? My check friend thought of

33:00.640 --> 33:06.160
 that joke. Actually, he says in his accent, it goes, if Hitler's so bad, why isn't he in the jail?

33:08.640 --> 33:13.200
 That's a good point. He's probably still alive, right? And look, yeah, hopefully.

33:15.040 --> 33:19.120
 Oh boy, two of the three people listening to this are very upset right now.

33:19.120 --> 33:25.200
 What were you even talking about? How do you know what is good?

33:25.840 --> 33:33.040
 There's lots of standards of good. But for me, to be a good guy is, if you want to leave the

33:33.040 --> 33:37.440
 world a little bit better than you found it, that to me is the definition of a good guy.

33:38.160 --> 33:43.440
 And I think there are many people that there's not their motivation at all.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.120
 It's about your motivation.

33:45.120 --> 33:49.600
 Well, it's also about if your motivation is at all correlated to reality.

33:50.720 --> 33:57.520
 No one thinks we're the bad guys. That's correct. But are you taking steps to check your motivations

33:57.520 --> 34:02.320
 and also take a certain amount of humility? Because if you're going to start interfering

34:02.320 --> 34:07.040
 with people's lives, you really better be sure you know what you're talking about.

34:07.040 --> 34:16.720
 The control of others, if you do have centralized control or then you become a leader of a group,

34:16.720 --> 34:21.440
 you better do so humbly and cautiously.

34:21.440 --> 34:28.320
 And also have steam valves, right? So if in case things go wrong, let's have,

34:28.320 --> 34:31.360
 I'm sure this is a lot happening with AI, whatever work with computers.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.840
 Like, okay, if something goes wrong here, how do we have a workaround to make sure it

34:35.840 --> 34:37.280
 doesn't cause everything to collapse?

34:37.280 --> 34:41.600
 Yeah, the going wrong thing. I mean, the whole, the feedback mechanism.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.000
 Yeah.

34:42.000 --> 34:49.040
 Like, I wonder if people in Congress think that things are really wrong.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.720
 It's working for them.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.720
 Are you sure?

34:52.720 --> 34:54.400
 No, I'm not sure.

34:54.400 --> 35:01.600
 Because I'd like to believe that the people that at least when they got into politics

35:01.600 --> 35:07.920
 actually wanted, some of it is ego, but some of it is like wanting to be the kind of person

35:08.480 --> 35:09.840
 that builds a better world.

35:09.840 --> 35:14.880
 Sure. I'd also think it's a diverse, some of we're going to have different motivations than others.

35:15.440 --> 35:19.520
 But like, once you're in the system and trying to build a better world,

35:20.240 --> 35:22.320
 how do you know that it's not working?

35:23.120 --> 35:26.640
 Like, how do you take the basic feedback mechanisms and like,

35:26.640 --> 35:30.240
 and actually productively change?

35:30.240 --> 35:32.080
 I mean, that's what it means to be a good guy.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.080
 It's like, hmm, something is wrong here.

35:34.080 --> 35:37.920
 And this, that's why I like the Elon Musk, like, think from first principles.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.040
 Like, wait, wait, wait, okay.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.440
 Let's ask the big question.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.960
 Like, can this be, one, is this working at all?

35:44.960 --> 35:49.040
 Like, the way we're solving this particular problem of government, is this working at all?

35:49.920 --> 35:55.680
 And then like, stepping away and saying like, as opposed to modifying this bill or that bill,

35:55.680 --> 36:00.960
 or like this little strategy, like increase the tax by this much or decrease the tax by this much,

36:00.960 --> 36:04.800
 like, why do we have a democracy at all?

36:05.760 --> 36:10.800
 Or why do we have any kind of representative democracy?

36:10.800 --> 36:12.960
 Shouldn't it be a pure democracy?

36:12.960 --> 36:20.320
 Or why do we have states, like representation states and federal government and so on?

36:20.320 --> 36:22.880
 Why do we have this kind of separation of powers?

36:22.880 --> 36:23.760
 Is this different?

36:23.760 --> 36:26.080
 Why don't we have term limits or not?

36:26.080 --> 36:27.360
 Like, big things.

36:28.240 --> 36:31.120
 Like, how do you actually make that happen?

36:31.120 --> 36:33.360
 And is that what it means to be a good guy?

36:33.360 --> 36:39.680
 It's like taking big revolutionary steps as opposed to incremental steps.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.720
 Well, I don't know that you could be a politician to be a good guy, to be an analyst.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.160
 And let me give you a counter example.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.240
 Someone who you could tell is not being a good guy.

36:46.960 --> 36:50.560
 Joe Biden said he was, he regards the Iraq war as a mistake, okay?

36:50.560 --> 36:52.800
 You and I have made mistakes in our lives, I'm sure.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.360
 None of our mistakes have caused tens of thousands of people to die.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.920
 If, let's suppose I'm big for yourself.

36:59.360 --> 36:59.920
 That's fair.

36:59.920 --> 37:00.880
 Okay, I'll take that.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.160
 I don't build the killbots.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.280
 If I were a chef, let's take it out of politics.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.560
 And in my restaurant somehow, accidentally, someone ate something and they died.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.960
 A, I would feel horrible.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.520
 But more importantly, I would be like, we need to look through this system

37:19.520 --> 37:23.280
 and figure out how it got to the point where someone lost their life.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.120
 Because that can never happen again.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.280
 And we need to figure out step by step.

37:27.280 --> 37:32.640
 It's, there's, I'm not a gun person, but there's like this checklist of like,

37:32.640 --> 37:34.800
 if you're holding a gun, there's five things to do.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.960
 And even if you get too wrong, you're going to be sitting, it's like,

37:36.960 --> 37:41.280
 assume every gun is loaded, only pointed at something that you want to kill.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.880
 And there's like three other things.

37:42.880 --> 37:47.120
 And it's like to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

37:47.120 --> 37:53.120
 So if I made a, if I'm that chef, and I would have to not only feel guilt,

37:53.120 --> 37:59.280
 but take preventative action to make sure this has no possibility of happening again.

37:59.760 --> 38:03.680
 If you look at the staff he's putting in, it's the same war mongers

38:03.680 --> 38:08.720
 that would have advised him to get into the Iraq war on the first time.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.280
 That is to me, is not a good guy.

38:11.280 --> 38:15.440
 That to me is someone who does not feel remorse for their responsibility

38:15.440 --> 38:19.280
 in killing not only many Americans, but some of us think that,

38:19.280 --> 38:21.840
 you know, dead Iraqis isn't necessarily ideal either.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.520
 Okay, let's talk a bit about war.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.480
 Maybe you can also correct me on something.

38:28.480 --> 38:34.480
 The first time I found myself into Barack Obama was,

38:34.480 --> 38:40.640
 I don't know how many years ago this was, but when I maybe heard a speech of his

38:40.640 --> 38:43.920
 about him speaking out against the war.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.520
 Yeah.

38:45.520 --> 38:51.920
 And him, I think it's on record saying he was against the war before he was happening.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.360
 Now, he wasn't in Senate at the time, so it was very easy for him to say this.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.640
 But see, like people say that, people say that.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.960
 People say like it was easy and it was, some people say it's like strategically

39:03.600 --> 39:06.560
 the wise thing to do given some kind of calculus, whatever.

39:07.120 --> 39:13.440
 But I to this day give him, that's the reason I've always given him props in my mind.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.760
 Like this is a man of character.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.760
 Like he makes, I also personally really value great speeches.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.360
 I think speeches are really important for leaders because they inspire the world.

39:23.360 --> 39:27.360
 That's like one of the most best things you can contribute to the world is great.

39:28.640 --> 39:34.720
 Like through intellect, mold ideas in a way that's communicable to like a huge number of people.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.600
 Yeah, it's better to persuade than to force in every instance.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.000
 That's where I disagree with Chomsky said, like if you're,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.640
 Chomsky's whole idea was that like if you're really eloquent speaker,

39:45.360 --> 39:48.000
 that means your ideas aren't that good.

39:48.000 --> 39:48.960
 That's nonsense.

39:48.960 --> 39:54.800
 Yeah, so I think that's a way for him to describe like I speak in a very boring way.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.800
 Maybe that's a pitch for this podcast.

39:56.800 --> 40:00.640
 I speak boring so that the ideas are the things you value.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.320
 And it's also useful to go to sleep.

40:02.320 --> 40:08.640
 But that's why I really liked Obama throughout his life and still do.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.040
 But when I first like saw this is for some reason, you can disagree.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.280
 I thought he's a man of character is to when most politicians,

40:17.280 --> 40:20.720
 most people who are trying to calculate and rise in power,

40:20.720 --> 40:24.240
 I think were for the war or too afraid to be against the war.

40:24.240 --> 40:30.640
 Yeah, that's why I liked Bernie Sanders and that's why I liked like in the early days,

40:30.640 --> 40:36.240
 Obama for speaking out against the war and not like in this weird activist way,

40:36.240 --> 40:39.600
 not weird, but not not saying I'm an activist.

40:39.600 --> 40:46.160
 This is but like just saying the common sense thing and being brave enough to say the common sense thing

40:46.160 --> 40:52.080
 without like having a big sign and saying I'm going to be the anti war candidate or something like that.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.560
 But just saying this is not a good idea.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.960
 Yeah, and I think it's for those of us who are old enough to remember,

40:58.960 --> 41:03.600
 it's pretty despicable what happened with Tulsi in 2020.

41:03.600 --> 41:09.120
 She was the biggest anti war candidate and she was marginalized within her own party,

41:09.120 --> 41:10.240
 which I guess you can make sense.

41:10.240 --> 41:11.760
 She's just a congresswoman from Hawaii.

41:12.400 --> 41:19.120
 But the corporate press did everything in their power to diminish her and pretend she didn't existed.

41:19.120 --> 41:22.800
 And for those of us who remember where 12 years prior,

41:23.680 --> 41:27.040
 you know, when George W. Bush had the Republican National Convention New York

41:27.040 --> 41:31.680
 and it was like the biggest protest in history and the Iraq war led to democratic

41:31.680 --> 41:38.320
 landslides in 2006 and 2008 to have that completely not part of the Democratic Party

41:38.880 --> 41:41.920
 in 2020 is both shocking and reprehensible.

41:43.920 --> 41:44.560
 Hey, Michael.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.120
 You don't have to say, hey, Michael.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.320
 You just say knock knock.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.280
 No, it's not a knock knock joke.

41:51.280 --> 41:51.760
 Oh, okay.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.880
 What did the volcano say to his true love?

41:57.680 --> 41:57.920
 What?

41:57.920 --> 42:03.600
 What? I love you.

42:03.600 --> 42:07.600
 These jokes work better when you know how to speak English.

42:08.720 --> 42:09.760
 It was actually in Russian.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.520
 I did a Google translate.

42:11.520 --> 42:15.040
 Okay. Back to your book and the suffering.

42:15.040 --> 42:20.800
 You somehow turned it positive and as one who's wearing,

42:20.800 --> 42:23.280
 who's the representative of the black pill in this conversation,

42:23.840 --> 42:25.360
 what are some of the darker moments?

42:25.360 --> 42:30.400
 What are some of the hardest challenges of putting together this book, the white pill?

42:30.400 --> 42:31.680
 Content, content, content.

42:32.560 --> 42:41.040
 So if I'm having a page about Reagan taking on Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries,

42:41.040 --> 42:42.800
 I'm going to have to read like 20.

42:43.440 --> 42:48.320
 So it's the thing like if there'll be sometimes I'll remember some quotes somewhere

42:48.320 --> 42:53.120
 and then I have to spend an hour trying to find it because I want it to be as dense with

42:53.120 --> 42:55.360
 information as possible.

42:56.400 --> 43:01.600
 How do you structure the main philosophical ideas you want to convey?

43:01.600 --> 43:03.120
 Is that already planned out?

43:03.120 --> 43:06.480
 No, the book changed entirely from its conception.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.920
 So my buddy Ryan Holiday had a series of books,

43:09.920 --> 43:12.240
 so does where he takes the ideas of the Stoics

43:12.960 --> 43:15.920
 and he applies them to contemporary terms.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.560
 He has this whole cottage industry that he's doing very well with.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.760
 And I'd asked him years ago if I could do that with Camus,

43:21.760 --> 43:23.280
 he's like, sure, go for it.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.960
 And I was going to rework Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus.

43:27.600 --> 43:32.640
 And I read it recently, I reread it, and this wasn't the book I remembered at all.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.800
 And I'm like, okay, I'm going to write the book that I remembered.

43:35.600 --> 43:40.960
 But the more I was writing it, one of the things I always yell at conservatives about,

43:40.960 --> 43:47.120
 and there's a long list, is they don't talk about the great victory of conservatism,

43:47.120 --> 43:50.080
 which was the winning of the Cold War without firing a shot.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.480
 And I said, you can't expect The New York Times to tell this story

43:52.480 --> 43:53.760
 because the blood is on their hands.

43:54.400 --> 44:00.560
 And I'm like, well, Michael, instead of complaining about it, why don't you do it?

44:00.560 --> 44:01.440
 Why don't you talk?

44:01.440 --> 44:04.240
 That is a great example of the good guys winning over the bad guys.

44:04.800 --> 44:09.920
 And that's become, A, the victory is beautiful,

44:09.920 --> 44:12.400
 but also pointing out to people, when people are like,

44:12.400 --> 44:13.760
 oh, things are worse than they've ever been,

44:14.320 --> 44:17.120
 they don't appreciate how bad things were in the 30s,

44:17.120 --> 44:22.880
 what Stalin was doing overseas, and how people in the West were advocating to bring that here.

44:23.520 --> 44:28.880
 So that's kind of pointing out how bad things were, and how good they became,

44:28.880 --> 44:33.920
 and you don't have to be a Republican or conservative to be delighted

44:33.920 --> 44:37.680
 at the collapse of totalitarianism and the peaceful liberation of half the world.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.520
 So that's a picture of the good guys winning.

44:39.520 --> 44:39.840
 Oh, yeah.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.440
 Well, how does that connect to Sisyphus?

44:41.440 --> 44:50.480
 And maybe to speak deeper to life and whatever the hell this thing is,

44:51.280 --> 44:55.200
 which is what I remember the myth of Sisyphus being about.

44:55.200 --> 45:01.680
 So where does the thread of Camus lie in the work that you're doing?

45:02.240 --> 45:06.080
 So the myth of Sisyphus, which I had remembered incorrectly,

45:06.080 --> 45:12.400
 is actually just a five to seven page coda to the whole book at the very end.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.200
 Like, you only need to read that little essay called The Myth of Sisyphus.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.960
 The broader work is about Camus's concept of the absurd,

45:18.960 --> 45:22.000
 and the absurd man within literature, and it's just like,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.880
 I don't really care about this character in Dostoevsky and all this other stuff

45:24.880 --> 45:27.040
 that you're talking about, it's of no relevance.

45:27.040 --> 45:32.800
 But the myth of Sisyphus, the myth itself, not the book or the essay of his,

45:32.800 --> 45:38.480
 is this Greek character, and Sisyphus is forced in hell to roll a rock up a hill.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.760
 For eternity at the very last moment, the rock falls away.

45:42.480 --> 45:47.600
 And Camus take away from the stories that we must imagine Sisyphus happy.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.880
 And there's several interpretations of this, but one is,

45:50.880 --> 45:58.400
 once you accept that you are living an absurdist existence, once you own your reality,

45:58.400 --> 46:05.920
 it loses its bite. And you can start with that as your kind of baseline.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.560
 And bite is suffering.

46:08.560 --> 46:17.280
 And hopelessness. So I think when people look at how much ridiculousness is happening in America

46:17.280 --> 46:23.600
 and it's escalating, you can either think, oh, all is lost, or you can, and I think you and I

46:23.600 --> 46:27.760
 have lived our lives like this, you can live life more like a surfer, whereas you're never

46:27.760 --> 46:33.280
 going to control the ocean. But you can sure enjoy that ride and stop.

46:33.280 --> 46:37.680
 If you're trying to control the waves, yeah, you're done. But if you're like, all right,

46:37.680 --> 46:42.400
 I've got my board, I'm going to see where this takes me, surfing from what I understand is a

46:42.400 --> 46:46.880
 pretty fun activity. And also sometimes dangerous, but you don't have to ask Tulsi about that.

46:48.080 --> 46:57.120
 So we were offline talking about Stalin and the evils of the Soviet regime.

46:57.120 --> 47:04.480
 Yeah. One of the things I mentioned, I watched the movie Mr. Jones, but it's about the 1930s

47:05.280 --> 47:12.160
 called the more the, what would you say, the torture of the Ukrainian people by Stalin.

47:13.040 --> 47:19.120
 One interesting thing to me that I'd love to hear your opinion about is the role of journalism and

47:19.120 --> 47:29.760
 all of this. And also about 1930s Germany. So what's the role of journalists and intellectuals

47:30.800 --> 47:40.640
 in a time when trouble is brewing, but it requires a really sort of brave and deep thinking to

47:40.640 --> 47:45.600
 understand that trouble is brewing. Like if you were a journalist or if you were just like an

47:45.600 --> 47:53.440
 intellectual, a thinker, but also a voice of in the space of public discourse, what would you do

47:53.440 --> 48:01.600
 in 1930s about Stalin, about how the more, and what would you do about Nazi Germany in 1937,

48:01.600 --> 48:06.800
 1938. So that's really funny that you asked that because currently how the book is structured,

48:07.440 --> 48:12.320
 it's like, you know, books often follow three X structure, right? So act three is the eighties,

48:12.320 --> 48:18.000
 act one is the thirties and act two is going to be like, all right, let's suppose you were

48:18.000 --> 48:21.680
 in the thirties, are you just going to give up? Like, are you just going to be like, well,

48:21.680 --> 48:25.440
 we're screwed. And you'd be right to say things are going to be very bad for a long time.

48:25.440 --> 48:30.320
 Or are you going to be one of those few who are like, we're going to do something about this and,

48:30.320 --> 48:34.080
 you know, we're going to go down swinging. There are two books I can recommend, which are just

48:35.680 --> 48:41.360
 masterpieces that are written by women that just historians that are just super. There's a book

48:41.360 --> 48:45.920
 called Beyond Belief by Deborah Lipstadt. She talks about the rise of Nazi Germany as seen

48:45.920 --> 48:51.520
 through the press. And what was amazing, and she does a great job empathizing with the press and

48:51.520 --> 48:56.400
 understand their perspective, is we remember, and Chamberlain gets a bad rap, Neville Chamberlain

48:56.400 --> 49:01.360
 for kind of appeasing Hitler, because not that long ago, they had the Great War. They had World War

49:01.360 --> 49:08.080
 I. And they had the carnage that the earth had never seen before. And when you had people made

49:08.080 --> 49:12.400
 out of meat, meat industrial machines, and plastic surgery was invented as a consequence of this,

49:12.400 --> 49:18.480
 they're coming back mangled and disfigured. And for what? And this was a world where the Kaiser

49:18.480 --> 49:22.880
 was the most evil person ever lived. And we all had the Western propaganda about the Han,

49:23.440 --> 49:29.280
 and all the rapes, and all this barbarism, and blah, blah, blah. So not that long later,

49:29.920 --> 49:35.120
 when you're hearing all this propaganda, which was factual about Hitler, it's like, we heard this.

49:35.120 --> 49:44.160
 We heard this 20 years ago. This was all lies. Give us a break. And she has all the quotes

49:44.960 --> 49:49.040
 from the different agencies and how they addressed it. Plus, they had very limited information.

49:49.040 --> 49:53.760
 It's not like Nazi Germany was an open society where reporters can walk around and they were

49:53.760 --> 49:58.720
 under a lot of pressure as well, you know, in those areas. And Hitler himself was pretty good at

49:58.720 --> 50:05.440
 that. He let some stuff slip, but usually he made it seem like he wants peace. He wants world peace.

50:05.440 --> 50:09.840
 This was amazing. They were making the argument that because all these Jews were being beaten

50:09.840 --> 50:14.880
 up on the street, this proved, this was the hot take of the day, that Hitler was weak.

50:15.840 --> 50:20.000
 Because since Hitler's a statesman and he can't control these hooligans,

50:20.000 --> 50:24.160
 that shows his control on power is tenuous. And this is all going to go away.

50:24.160 --> 50:29.200
 By the way, Hitler thought that too. He was kind of afraid of the bronchers,

50:29.200 --> 50:33.440
 whatever. He was afraid of these hooligans a little bit. They were useful to him,

50:34.080 --> 50:39.600
 but at a certain point, yeah, they can get in the way. That's why he wanted to get control of

50:39.600 --> 50:44.000
 the military, the army, the regiment. If you want to take over the world, you can't do it with

50:44.000 --> 50:48.800
 hooligans. You have to do it with an actual army. And then you had Kristallnacht, which was a

50:48.800 --> 50:57.120
 nationwide pogrom. And then all the news agencies universally were like, oh, crap, we got this wrong.

50:57.120 --> 51:03.520
 And the condemnation was universal. So that book traces the West's reaction to what's going on there.

51:03.520 --> 51:09.840
 And including the reaction to the incipient Holocaust as people being, you know, what they

51:09.840 --> 51:15.840
 knew, when did they know. There was not ambiguity about it. People, I think there's this myth

51:15.840 --> 51:21.280
 that she dispels, that they didn't know the Holocaust was happening or they didn't care.

51:21.280 --> 51:26.480
 They were aware, but they were already at war with Nazi Germany. Like, literally, what else could

51:26.480 --> 51:33.520
 they do at that point to rescue all these Jews? So that's the superbook. And Ann Applebaum,

51:33.520 --> 51:40.320
 I think the book is called Red Famine, came out fairly recently. And she brings the receipts.

51:40.320 --> 51:46.640
 And she's a, you know, this is something I really hate with the binary thinkers, where people think,

51:46.640 --> 51:50.400
 oh, you know, if you're a Democrat, you're basically a communist, they call Joe Biden a Marxist.

51:50.400 --> 51:55.200
 It's just like, you know, she's a hard lefty. She's, you know, has TDS. But this book just

51:55.200 --> 52:01.280
 systemically lays out what Stalin did. By the way, I'm triggered by the binary thinkers. And for

52:01.280 --> 52:08.720
 those who don't know, TDS 0011 is Trump to Rangeman Syndrome. Yes. So they, you know,

52:08.720 --> 52:16.080
 forced the starvation in this entire population. And they, it's not only that, it's like they knew

52:16.800 --> 52:22.320
 if you weren't starving by looking at you, that you were hiding food. So they'd come back to your

52:22.320 --> 52:27.120
 house at night and break your fingers in the door or take, burn down your house. And now you're on

52:27.120 --> 52:31.520
 the street without food because you lied, because this is the people's food. You're a kulak. You're

52:31.520 --> 52:35.840
 a landowner. And very quickly, a kulak, which meant like peasant landowner became anyone who had

52:35.840 --> 52:44.000
 a piece of bread. And this was systemic and ongoing. And many people in the press did not

52:44.000 --> 52:50.160
 believe it. There was a British journalist, I believe, who got out of the train, Ukraine,

52:50.160 --> 52:55.920
 like one town earlier and walked, and he described all this. And he was mocked and derided. And this

52:55.920 --> 53:00.800
 is just anti Russian propaganda. Because at the time in the 30s, this was socialism and

53:00.800 --> 53:06.160
 come through fruition. This was a noble experiment. I'd seen the future and it works. I think that

53:06.160 --> 53:12.240
 Sidney Webb was the guy who said that. And the premise was, let's see what happens. We've never

53:12.240 --> 53:17.760
 tried something like that. And they were perfectly happy to have this experiment happen overseas

53:17.760 --> 53:22.160
 at the price of the Russian people because it's like, you know what, maybe this will be paradise

53:22.160 --> 53:27.760
 on earth. And there's a, I dressed this in my book as well. There's superb essay, I think,

53:27.760 --> 53:34.640
 by Eugene Genevies. And he talks about the question, the question being, what did you know,

53:34.640 --> 53:38.640
 and when did you know it? What did you know about the concentration camps? What did you know about

53:38.640 --> 53:42.640
 the starvation? What did you know about children being taught at school to turn in their parents

53:42.640 --> 53:48.160
 for, you know, having some extra bread? And his conclusion is we all knew, and we all knew from

53:48.160 --> 53:52.800
 the beginning, every bit of it, and we didn't care because we were more interested in promoting

53:52.800 --> 53:59.600
 this ideology. So when people are kind of thinking the worst thing on earth is like Robert E. Lee

53:59.600 --> 54:06.480
 statue being taken down to Washington D.C., we were being told on a, and especially a much more

54:06.480 --> 54:11.520
 limited news information world where now you have literally anyone can have a Twitter,

54:11.520 --> 54:16.960
 but how many outlets were there that this is, we're backwards, they're the future, they're

54:16.960 --> 54:22.000
 scientific, we have the vagaries of the market, which led to the Great Depression. And when you

54:22.000 --> 54:28.400
 see what was being put over on the American public at the time, anyone who thinks things are as bad

54:28.400 --> 54:31.680
 now as they've ever been is simply delusional or ignorant.

54:31.680 --> 54:37.840
 Yeah, I would say just as a small aside, that's why reading, as I'm almost done with

54:37.840 --> 54:47.360
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, is it refreshes, resets the palette of your understanding

54:47.360 --> 54:54.320
 of what is good and evil in the world that I think is really useful now? Like, you know,

54:54.320 --> 55:02.000
 what helps me be really positive and almost naive on Twitter and in the world is by just

55:02.000 --> 55:16.320
 studying history and comparing it to how amazing things are today. But in that time, what would

55:16.320 --> 55:28.960
 you do? What does a brave mind do? And not just acts of bravery, but how do you be effective in that?

55:29.840 --> 55:33.200
 That's something I often think about. It's sometimes easy to be an activist

55:34.960 --> 55:40.240
 in terms of just saying stuff. It's hard to be effective at your activism.

55:40.240 --> 55:45.360
 One of the big questions historians have constantly is how did this happen? A,

55:45.360 --> 55:49.680
 to make sure it doesn't happen again, but this is Germany. This is not some kind of weirdo

55:50.480 --> 55:56.560
 cult nation. They're very advanced, very in the land of poets and philosophers. How did it get

55:56.560 --> 56:01.200
 to that point that they're just shooting children and everyone's cheering for this?

56:01.920 --> 56:04.320
 Specifically on the anti Semitism and the Holocaust?

56:04.880 --> 56:08.800
 No, the whole Tartarianism, the cult of Hitler and just this whole kind of thing.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.960
 But this is starting to drop, but there's two sides. I don't know if you want to separate them.

56:12.960 --> 56:20.160
 One is the totalitarianism and the entirety of the Nazi regime. And then there's the Holocaust,

56:20.160 --> 56:32.320
 which is going, I would say, very specifically, as I think you're about to describe, is targeting

56:32.320 --> 56:36.640
 Jews very much. I don't know if you see those as two separate things.

56:36.640 --> 56:40.000
 I think they're very interconnected. But I think if you look at it,

56:40.000 --> 56:45.840
 everyone thinks that they'd be the ones putting up Anne Frank. But if you look at the numbers,

56:45.840 --> 56:51.280
 they'd be the ones calling the Stasi on her or the people who were at the time, and not the Stasi,

56:51.280 --> 56:53.840
 obviously, and patting themselves in the back for it.

56:53.840 --> 56:58.080
 So sorry to pause on that. That's a really important thing. If you're listening to this,

56:59.440 --> 57:07.600
 that and you were in Germany at the time, you would have likely been willing to commit

57:07.600 --> 57:13.120
 or at least keep a blind eye to the violence against Jews. You have to really sit with that

57:13.120 --> 57:19.200
 idea that you would have been somebody who just sees this and is not bothered by it,

57:19.200 --> 57:26.000
 and also very likely kind of understand this as a necessary evil or even a necessary good.

57:26.560 --> 57:32.640
 Yeah. And I think people think they would be the abolitionists are marching on Selma.

57:32.640 --> 57:39.680
 The numbers don't add up to that at all. And I think the question would be, my friend was on

57:39.680 --> 57:45.280
 Tinder, my friend Matt, he's a great dude. And the question was, what's the most controversial

57:45.280 --> 57:51.360
 opinion you have? This is New York, and the girl wrote, I hate Trump. And what people perceive

57:51.360 --> 57:57.680
 themselves as being courageous in saying and doing, and what is the actual social costs of

57:57.680 --> 58:03.280
 you saying or doing this are two very disconnected things. And we're also trained by corporate

58:03.280 --> 58:11.520
 media to have completely vapid, uninteresting, banal ideas and yet regard ourselves as revolutionaries.

58:12.640 --> 58:17.360
 There are people who still in New York will take pride because they have a gay friend.

58:18.080 --> 58:23.520
 And it's like, first of all, who cares? But second of all, you are not a hero.

58:23.520 --> 58:26.720
 And that person is not your prop, by the way, that's another big problem.

58:26.720 --> 58:31.680
 Which is why I'd like to give Richard Wolfe a shout out for being an intellectual who talks

58:31.680 --> 58:37.760
 about communism. I think it takes kind of a heroic intellectual right now to speak about

58:38.400 --> 58:44.960
 communism seriously. There's difficult waters to tread, is that the expression? There's difficult

58:44.960 --> 58:48.960
 paths to walk. I love watching a robot try to use idiom in a language he doesn't even know.

58:48.960 --> 58:57.280
 001. I'm quite deeply heard by the binary comment.

58:57.280 --> 58:59.920
 Are you? Your feeling has gone from one to zero.

59:02.240 --> 59:13.760
 Yeah, my buffers have overflown. I feel like communism is universally seen as a bad thing

59:13.760 --> 59:17.920
 currently in intellectual circles. Or actually, maybe some people disagree with that. People

59:17.920 --> 59:26.160
 say far left, people are trying to, there's some people who argue the BLM movement is some kind

59:26.160 --> 59:32.240
 of arm of a Marxist. I mean, I don't really follow the deep logic in that, whatever.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.200
 Well, they said they were formed by Marxism, the founder, go founder.

59:37.200 --> 59:43.920
 But stating that is different than... There's Marx, the totalitarian, there's also Marx,

59:43.920 --> 59:46.880
 the revolutionary. And I think they're talking more like, we're revolutionaries,

59:46.880 --> 59:50.720
 we're going to overthrow the status quo. Yeah, right. But we can have that

59:50.720 --> 59:56.720
 further discussion, but I just don't think they speak deeply about political systems and saying

59:56.720 --> 1:00:03.040
 communism is going to be the righteous system. There's not a deep intellectual discourse,

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:07.120
 what I mean. But if you were to try to be on stage with the Jordan Peterson,

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:14.800
 like to me, the brave thing now, it would be to argue for communism. It'd be interesting to see.

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:19.120
 Not many people do it. I certainly wouldn't be willing to do it. I don't have enough...

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:23.680
 I don't, first of all, don't believe it. But second of all, it's a very difficult argument to make

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:28.400
 because you get so much fire, which is why, like Richard Wolff, he's one of the people who is

1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:35.040
 quite rigorously showing that there's some good ideas within the system of communism,

1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:45.040
 specifically saying that attacking more the negative sides of capitalism. So saying that

1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:50.080
 capitalism potentially is more dangerous than communism. I mean, I disagree with that, but

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:54.560
 I think it's a... I love how something is like, we've got a body count of 60 million,

1:00:54.560 --> 1:01:00.080
 but everything is put to... And potentially, water can drown everyone on earth. So this

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:04.880
 is incoherent. Well, I think nuclear weapons are bad, but nuclear energy is good.

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:08.640
 Sure. Well, nuclear weapons also can be good. You can easily make the argument,

1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:12.240
 which I don't know that I subscribe to, that nuclear weapons prevented,

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:17.280
 boot something around war. And it causes me much more contained.

1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:22.160
 And they're also quite effective at changing the direction of an asteroid that's about to hit

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:28.720
 earth, as I've learned from a movie. And they're actually useful as Musk has claimed for

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:35.280
 application, prior to colonizing Mars, making it more habitable.

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:35.840
 Oh, okay.

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:36.960
 So it changed.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:37.840
 That looks something.

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:48.080
 But yes, but I guess what I'm saying is there's place for nuance, and there's some topics so

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:55.840
 hot like communism, where nuance is very difficult to have. And I feel like with Nazi Germany,

1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:59.440
 it was a similar thing at the time.

1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:02.640
 You want to talk about Jeanette Rankin, who was one of my favorite people?

1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:07.040
 So Jeanette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress. She was elected before

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:11.200
 women's suffrage was messed, the constitutional amendment from Montana.

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:20.160
 She was elected in 1916. She was one of a handful of people to vote against the U.S.

1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:24.960
 going into the Great War, which was the right call at the time. She was a pacifist Republican

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:32.880
 as well, coincidentally. She lost her seat, ran again in, was it 1940, got the seat again,

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:39.680
 and was the only person to vote against getting into World War II. It was not a unanimous choice.

1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:44.880
 Jeanette Rankin was the one person, and she said, you can no more win a war than you can win a

1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:52.080
 hurricane. So she's one of these interesting, and talk about bravery. You're the one vote

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:58.080
 after Pearl Harbor to say, we're not doing this. And I mean, the pressure she must have been under

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:02.480
 at the time is, and of course, many people are not interested in hearing her perspective. She's

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:06.080
 crazy. She's evil, blah, blah. It's also funny. Someone on my Twitter, when I talked about her,

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:12.000
 goes, maybe she had Hitler's sympathies. Like, yeah, Ms. Rankin was a big fan of Hitler.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.840
 That's why you figured it out, guys.

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:19.200
 Do you think there's an argument to be made that United States should not have gotten involved

1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:23.920
 in World War II? Oh, easy, an easy argument. The argument, there's a, I talk about this in the

1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:29.520
 New Right. So on internet circles, there's something called Godwin's Law, which means the

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:34.640
 longer an internet conversation goes on, the probability someone gets compared to Hitler

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:42.720
 becomes one. In certain New Right circles, the longer the conversation goes on, the more likelihood

1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:45.760
 that the argument will become we shouldn't have ended World War II also becomes one.

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:51.840
 And the argument is, at the very least, stay back, let Hitler and Stalin kill each other off,

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:57.040
 and then go in and knock off the weaker one, and you're going to be saving, destroying two

1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:01.440
 nightmare systems. And I think that's an easy argument to make. Now, it's hard to pull off

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:06.560
 after Pearl Harbor, but in terms of strategy, I don't think that's a tough sell.

1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:08.720
 What about after Pearl Harbor?

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:11.200
 I mean, that's what I was saying. After Pearl Harbor, how are you going to sell that to the

1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:15.360
 people? The argument is, blah, blah, the Holocaust, the Holocaust, there's no scenario where that

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:20.880
 doesn't happen, really, unless you're going in way earlier. But even so, Hitler had said,

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:24.560
 if the Jews launch another war, we're going to wipe them from the face of the earth.

1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:27.440
 So the Jews are being held hostage by Hitler as an argument for this.

1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:34.080
 Another thing he did, which was diabolical, is in order to make it that people could not

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:38.800
 accept Jews as refugees, if they were going to leave Germany, they had to be penniless.

1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:43.120
 So now it's not like they're coming over with money and they can take care of themselves.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.880
 No, no, they're going to be completely destitute. It makes it harder to accept them, yeah.

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:50.560
 Millions of destitute people who don't speak the language. It's a tough sell.

1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:55.520
 So speaking of Good Ones Law, what do you make of this condition,

1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:04.880
 Trump derangement syndrome, and the idea of comparing Trump to Hitler?

1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:09.600
 I think it's despicable. And I'll give you something parallel that I think more people

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:17.280
 should be regarded as despicable. Earlier in 2020, we were all told that unless we were in Syria

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:22.960
 immediately, the Kurds were going to be exterminated. They invoked the Holocaust. This is going to be

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:29.440
 another genocide. And if you're not for this, you're basically forcing another Holocaust.

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:33.760
 None of the people who used this argument, we didn't go to Syria, the Kurds were not exterminated,

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:39.680
 they just vanished from the news, had any consequences for using this kind of comparison.

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:47.120
 So I think it's really kind of fatuous. And I think it's amazing that people think Hitler's the only

1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:52.960
 tyrant who ever lived. Like everyone who's bad is specifically Hitler. You know how you know he's

1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:58.320
 not Hitler? Because you can tweet at him and no one comes to your house to kill your family.

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:03.920
 Like that's kind of a big difference. Also there between Trump and many of his critics

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:09.600
 is that his grandchildren will be raised as Jews. So that's also kind of a, and Deborah

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:14.080
 Lipschuk talks about this a lot. The New York Times at the time, there's another book called

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:18.640
 Buried by the Times, which talks about the New York Times in the World War II,

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:25.920
 because the idea that Jews weren't white was a Hitler idea. The New York Times at the time,

1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:34.320
 Salzberger, wanted to be against this idea. So they specifically downplayed the antisemitism

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:40.480
 as opposed to the Nazis are being oppressive. So the argument that you can separate Nazism

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:46.080
 from antisemitism is a historical debate people have. And my perspective is, I think it's,

1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:52.880
 I do not find it convincing that you can separate those two. I think antisemitism was

1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:58.160
 essential to Nazism. I think Nazism and Mussolini's fascism have very big differences.

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:04.240
 Do you think antisemitism is fundamental to who Hitler was?

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:12.640
 So this is the interesting thing is like, was it a tool that he saw as being effective?

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:13.440
 No, he believed it.

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:19.360
 So why do you see those as intricately connected? Could Hitler have accomplished

1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:22.800
 the same amount or more without the Holocaust?

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.800
 Yeah, because think about how many resources you had to divert at a time where you have

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:28.480
 Operation Barbarossa with Stalin.

1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:33.520
 So why are they connected? Why are they so connected? Is it because

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.960
 Hitler was insane? Or was he a bad strategist?

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:41.360
 He was obviously a bad strategist. He took, he had no need to open a second front.

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:46.160
 His general, my understanding, told him, this is crazy. It didn't work out for him at all.

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:53.040
 I mean, to draw Russia and her resources into that war, it makes absolutely no sense in retrospect.

1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:56.720
 There's a book about, I forgot what it's called. We talked about him at that point was just high

1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:59.440
 all the time on amphetamines and that could have affected his thinking.

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:04.880
 Yeah, there's a really good book on drugs. I figure what it's called, but yeah, it's a really good one.

1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:13.520
 But it was, I mean, scapegoating is a big part and parcel of the Nazi mythology.

1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:20.400
 And this kind of one universal figure to explain this kind of, you know, skeleton key.

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.240
 But it could have been the communists. I mean, that could have been the source of the hatred.

1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:27.840
 But the communists didn't get Germany into World War I, like he said the Jews did.

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:36.800
 It seems to me that the atrocity of the Holocaust is the reason we see Hitler as evil.

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.240
 No, the reason we see Hitler as evil is because of World War II propaganda still.

1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:41.920
 Because we don't see Stalin as evil.

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:44.720
 Right, that's my main point. We don't see Mao as evil to that extent.

1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:47.600
 I think that... Why? Like, why would you say that?

1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:53.840
 You know what? Because I think a lot of the problem for certain type of mentality

1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:58.640
 is Hitler didn't mass murder equally. So as long as you're killing just one group,

1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:01.520
 it's a problem. But if you're murdering everyone equally, all of a sudden it's like,

1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:05.360
 hey, what are you going to do? So the fact like you were saying the Hall of the More is not common

1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:11.600
 knowledge, the fact that Mao's 50 million dead are not common knowledge and Richard Nixon

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:16.560
 can be raising a glass to him in China. These are things that I think the West has not done

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:25.040
 a good job reconciling. Knock knock. Who's there? Frank. Frank who? Frank you for being my friend,

1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:29.280
 Michael. And the heart attacks will say, Frank you for being my friend.

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.560
 You got to do like this. All right. Yeah. Okay.

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:47.680
 I'll back to Hitler. Do you think Hitler could have been stopped? We kind of talked about it a

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:54.000
 little bit in terms of how to, what is the brave thing to do in the time of Nazi Germany? But

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.280
 do you think, I mean, I'm not even going to ask about Stalin in terms of could Stalin have been

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:04.800
 stopped? Because probably the answer is there's no. But on the Hitler side, could Hitler have been

1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:10.240
 stopped? I think a lot of these things, a lot of luck has to play with it. He was almost assassinated.

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:17.680
 If you mean by like the West, it's very hard. I mean, yeah. By the German people too. I mean,

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:25.280
 could like if we're politically speaking, there was a rise to power through the 30s through the

1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:32.000
 20s really. I mean, like can whoever, it's not about Hitler, it's about that kind of way of thinking

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:39.920
 that totalitarian control that always leads to trouble. And sometimes the mass scale,

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:44.160
 could that have been stopped in Germany or maybe in the Soviet Union?

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.040
 I think this is one of the best arguments against radicalization in the States, which is,

1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:55.600
 how do you engage when you have like 30% of the population who are members of a party,

1:10:55.600 --> 1:11:00.240
 which is dedicated to systemically overthrowing the existing democracy?

1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:09.040
 Stalin gave orders that the communists who had a pretty sizable population, the Reichstag,

1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:14.080
 that their target shouldn't be the Nazis, but the liberals and the social democrats,

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:19.200
 and they invented the term social fascist for them. So instead of, they're just like jihadis,

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:23.840
 instead of taking their sights on Nazism, they set their sights on the moderates,

1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.400
 because they wanted, they figured the choice between Hitler and us, we're going to win.

1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.280
 And this was a huge gamble, and they were all killed or had to flee, and ones who fled were

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:39.680
 killed also by Stalin to my understanding. So this is an easy way where he could have been

1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:45.280
 certainly heavily mitigated. What about France and England, that it was obvious that Hitler was

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:52.240
 lying, and they wanted peace so bad that they were willing to put up with it, even after Czechoslovakia?

1:11:53.600 --> 1:12:03.280
 Like, this is the anti pacifist argument, which is like, they should have threatened military

1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:08.800
 force more. But then the other anti anti pacifist argument is, if you're going to remember Barack

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:14.160
 Obama had that red line, if you cross this red line in Syria, we're going to go in and Assad,

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:19.200
 whatever, was like, yeah, cool. And he's like, Oh, okay, well, sorry. So if you're a threatening

1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:25.600
 force, there's a great song lyric, don't show your guns unless you intend to fight, right?

1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:31.760
 So if it's very clear with free countries through what's in the press, whether the

1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:37.360
 institutional will is there to follow through on these threats. So I think we have been very hard

1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:44.000
 for Chamberlain to rally the British people to take on Hitler just after the great, I mean,

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.920
 the suffering that Britain's took the Great War, they still, you know, obviously,

1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:50.400
 it means so much more to them than us does to us in the West.

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:55.760
 What about what do you make of Churchill then? Like, why was Churchill able to rally the British

1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:03.520
 people? Why was he like, do you give much credit to Churchill for being one of the

1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:08.000
 great forces in stopping Hitler in World War II?

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:13.200
 I don't think that's really in dispute. I think he was very much regarded as this kind of the

1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:21.440
 right man at the right time. And I think Chamberlain took a gamble. He, the expression peace in our

1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:26.720
 time was Neville Chamberlain, when he signed the piece with Hitler, and he goes, we now have

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:30.560
 peace in our time now go home and get a good night's sleep. That's what he said, because he's

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:37.680
 like, all right, you know, he's going to stop here. And it's not impossible that if you just gave,

1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:43.040
 like if you gave Saddam Hussein Kuwait, it's not impossible that he's not going to, you know,

1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:47.920
 invade Saudi Arabia next something like that. Let's see. Okay. But everything I've read,

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:57.760
 it's like, of course, there's, there's, it's not impossible. But when you're in the room with Hitler,

1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:05.600
 you should be able to see like man to man. Like, like to me, a great leader should be able to see

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:13.200
 past the facade and see like, like, yes, everything in life is a risk. But it seems like

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:19.280
 the right risk to take with Hitler. Like, it's surprising to me, I know there's charisma,

1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:25.360
 but it's surprising to me, people did not see through this facade. I really hate the idea of

1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:29.760
 hindsight and everything being 2020. And I think it's a very good idea generally,

1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:35.200
 seeking generally, not in this specific instance, to give our ancestors more credit than they,

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:39.840
 than, than we tend to give them. Because people often, here's a great example from another context,

1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:44.800
 which is lightning rods. People always talk about religious people being stupid and superstitious.

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:50.480
 And they weren't, they often were very well reasoned. And an example of this is lightning rods,

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:56.720
 which is every year, whatever town, the church was the tallest building. And that's the one that

1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:02.720
 always got hit by lightning and got caught on fire. Now, what it's a coincidence that it's

1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:08.720
 always the church, like that makes logical sense. Now, they didn't realize, well, it's because the

1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:12.960
 tallest and therefore that attracts electricity. And in fact, when they invented lighting rods,

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:18.000
 this is a controversy, because it's like, well, how is God going to show his displeasure if now

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:23.280
 it's striking this lightning rod not burning down the church? So a lot of times things are a lot

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:30.000
 more coherent than we give them credit for. And again, Chamberlain, he's the head of a

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.840
 parliamentary party. So he does not have the, the freedom in a sense that a Hitler would

1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:39.760
 to be like, all right, we're doing this again, boys. We don't know what it's like in a room

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:44.560
 with Hitler. Come on, that's, that's, we really have no idea. But I think you have to think about

1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:51.600
 that, right? Yeah, but you can, I can very easily see him in the room being very calm and charming.

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.000
 And then you think, okay, the guy with the speeches is the act. And he's putting on a

1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.640
 show for his people. And this is the real one. Okay. So let's, let's take somebody as an example.

1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:10.480
 Let's take our mutual friend, Vladimir Putin. Yes. Okay. I don't know why saying his name

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:16.640
 makes my voice crack. Because you're scared he could hear you like Beetlejuice. Volodya.

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:22.640
 So there's a lot of people that's either one who built you.

1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:26.640
 No, that was, that was a collaboration.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:32.960
 What's, it's a double blind engineering effort,

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:42.720
 where I was not told of who my maker was. There's a backstory, but there's a talking cricket.

1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:45.360
 Pinocchio.

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.080
 You'll be a real boy someday.

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:59.520
 I talk about him quite a bit because I find him fascinating. Now there's a really important

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:08.000
 line that people say, like, why does Lex admire Putin? I do not admire Putin. I find the man

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:14.720
 fascinating. I find Hitler fascinating. I find a lot of figures in history fascinating, both good

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:22.800
 and bad. And the figures, just as you said, that are with us today, like Vladimir Putin,

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:28.400
 like Donald Trump, like Barack Obama, is difficult to place him on the spectrum of good and evil.

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:33.680
 Because that's only really applies to, like, when you see the consequences of their action in a

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:41.440
 historical context. So there's some people who say that Vladimir Putin is evil. And

1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:46.800
 based on our discussion about Hitler, that's something I think about a lot, which is

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:54.320
 in the room with Putin. And there's also a lot of historical descriptions of what it's like to be

1:17:54.320 --> 1:18:01.280
 in the room with Hitler in the 1930s. There's a lot of charisma. In the same way, I find Putin to be

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:11.520
 very charismatic in his own way. The humor, the wit, the brilliance, there's a simplicity of the way

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:22.240
 he thinks that really, if taken at face value, looks like a very intelligent, honest man

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:33.040
 thinking practically about how to build a better Russia constantly, almost like an executive.

1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:41.280
 Like, he loves, he looks like a man who loves his job in a way that Trump, for example, doesn't.

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:45.760
 Right. Meaning like, he loves laws and rules and how to...

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:48.320
 He has no adversarial press. So that's going to help.

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:49.120
 Yes.

1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:51.840
 And he's popular with his people. That's also going to help enormously.

1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:58.560
 I'm talking about strictly the man, directly the words coming out of his mouth, like all the videos

1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:03.760
 and interviews I've watched. I'm based on that, not the press, not the reporting. You can just

1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:11.280
 see that here's a man who's able to display a charisma that's not... Like, I can see that's

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:19.120
 why I love Joe Rogan, is like, you could tell the guy is genuine and is a good person. And like,

1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:23.360
 you could tell immediately that like, once you meet Joe, that he's going to be offline,

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:27.920
 also a good person. You could tell there's like signals that we send that are like difficult to

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:36.800
 kind of describe. In the same way, you can tell Putin is like, he genuinely loves his job and wants

1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:43.680
 to build a better Russia. There's the argument that he is actually an evil man behind that charisma

1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:52.720
 or is able to, you know, assassinate people, you know, limit free press, all those kinds of things.

1:19:54.480 --> 1:20:05.120
 Like that's... What do we do with that? So what do human beings like journalists or what do other

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:12.400
 leaders when they're in the room with Putin do with those kinds of notions in deciding how to act

1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:17.120
 in this world and deciding what policy to enact, all those kinds of things. Just like with Hitler,

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:22.960
 when Chairman was in the room with Hitler, how does he decide how to act?

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:30.240
 Well, let's go back to like my wheelhouse, which is North Korea, right? So when your entire world

1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:36.320
 is based on being against Trump and everything Trump does is buffoonery or kind of productive,

1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:42.160
 the conclusion of your reporting is going to be pretty much given. I was very hopeful

1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:48.000
 that there would be some positive outlooks or outcomes rather of Trump's meeting with Kim Jong

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.320
 Un. It looked like there was a space for things to go a bit better. I talked about it a lot at the

1:20:54.320 --> 1:21:06.800
 time and Trump was under no illusions about who he was dealing with. People pretend that, oh,

1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:11.520
 he was kind of naive. He had one of the refugees at the State of the Union, you know, lifting up

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:17.520
 his crutch. The first thing he sat down and talked to Xi Jinping about in Mara Lago right after he

1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:23.200
 became inaugurated was North Korea. Barack Obama said that when he sat down, Trump and the White

1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:28.640
 House during the transfer of power, he said North Korea is the biggest issue. So I think a good

1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:34.800
 leader, whether or not you consider Trump a good leader, has to be aware of, all right,

1:21:34.800 --> 1:21:40.400
 I'm going to have to have relationships of some kind, even if it's adversarial,

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:47.760
 with some really evil, evil, horrible people, which Kim Jong Un clearly is.

1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:53.920
 Well, I don't think there's anybody that has a perspective that North North Korean Kim Jong

1:21:53.920 --> 1:22:06.160
 Un or Il are not evil, right? Correct. But in 1930s Germany, isn't it a little bit more nuanced?

1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:09.360
 Yeah, because Hitler hasn't done anything yet and he's just to blow hard and he's

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:16.080
 in anti semite, sure, but he's... What about like before the war breaks out? Like what about the

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:22.880
 basic actionable anti semitism when you're like just attacking, hurting...

1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:25.120
 We're talking about Kristallnacht or talking about the Night of Long Knives?

1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:30.240
 Kristallnacht, so Night of the Broken Glass. Yeah, yeah, Long Knives is when he assassinated

1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:34.400
 a bunch of his people. That was something different. Yeah, so like when you're actually

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:41.120
 attacking your own citizenry? Yeah, that was universally condemned, Kristallnacht,

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:49.600
 and that was very shocking. It's level of barbarism to the West. Because I think we

1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:58.880
 still want to believe, understandably, that things aren't as bad as they seem. We would rather...

1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:07.360
 This is why the North Korea book I did, Dear Reader, is used in a humorous framework because

1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:11.280
 if you have to look... It's like looking to the sun. If you stare at it straight on,

1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:17.600
 it's very hard to do. So you have to kind of look at it obliquely and then you're kind of realizing

1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:25.280
 the enormity of the depravity. And again, pogroms in Russia had been a thing for a very long time

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:31.120
 and there's a difference between, okay, we're going to sack these villages and persecute people

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:37.920
 and we're going to systematically exterminate them. There's still levels of evil and depravity.

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:44.960
 So you did write the book Dear Reader on Kim Jong Il, Dear Reader, the unauthorized

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:50.800
 autobiography of Kim Jong Il. Yeah. So that's the previous leader of North Korea. Correct.

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:57.680
 Current one is the Un... Jong Un. No creativity on the naming. Well, no, this is intentional

1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:05.120
 because it's a throwback to the dad. So there's been only three leaders in North Korea.

1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:09.840
 So we've talked about the history of Hitler and Stalin, men like these. I think it's important

1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:15.680
 to understand that the history of those kinds of humans, there's... The history of North Korea

1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:19.840
 is not well written about or understood, which is why your book is exceptionally powerful and

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:34.640
 important. So maybe in a big broad way, can you say who is Kim Jong Il as a man, as a leader,

1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:38.960
 as a historical figure that we should understand and why should we understand them?

1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:44.000
 So I wrote Dear Reader by going to North Korea and getting all their propaganda,

1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.440
 which is translated into several languages because the conceit is everyone on earth is

1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:51.040
 interested in them and wants to mirror their ideology.

1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:54.560
 And he died in 2011. 2011. And you wrote the book in 2012.

1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:01.920
 I went there in 2012. I wrote the book, came out in 2014. So Kim Jong Il is, though not an

1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:05.680
 intellect, North Korea's version of Forrest Gump, in that when they write their history,

1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:11.440
 whenever something appears, happens, he's there. And by telling his life story, it's in the first

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:16.560
 person, he's telling the history of North Korea. So I wanted to write the kind of book where,

1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:20.880
 in one book, and it's the kind of reading you could do in the beach or the bathroom,

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.680
 you're going to get the entire history and know everything you need to know about North Korea

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:30.720
 in one accessible outlet. And it's what people don't appreciate about North Korea,

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:36.880
 the several things, how bad it is. And this didn't happen overnight. This was very systemic,

1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:42.880
 that what this family did to that country, where piece by piece, they did everything in their power

1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:48.960
 to hermetically seal it from the rest of the world, ramp up the oppression, keep any information

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:58.000
 from coming in. And they're very creative and innovative in their style of manipulation and

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:05.040
 control. So there is a farcical element. Let me give you an example. So people in the West kind

1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:09.280
 of get it wrong. They talk about, oh, they talk about when Kim Jong Il played golf for the first

1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:15.280
 time, he gets 17 holes in one. There's this one story about Kim Jong Il shrinking time.

1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:21.920
 And this is a story how it sounds supernatural, but it's not. So Kim Jong Il is at a conference,

1:26:21.920 --> 1:26:27.600
 the dear leader, and someone is giving a talk. And while that person's giving a talk, Kim Jong

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.720
 Il is taking notes and working on his work. And he has an aide who keeps interrupting him with

1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:37.680
 questions. And the speaker keeps stopping. And Kim Jong Il says, while you're stopping,

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:42.240
 goes, I see you're doing these other things. And it goes, no, no, I can do all these things at once.

1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:48.480
 Everyone's shocked. And they said, this is why Kim Jong Il looks at time, not like a plane,

1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:54.640
 but like a cube. And he can shrink time. And my friend goes, do they mean multitasking? And yes,

1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:00.960
 Kim Jong Il is the only person in North Korea who's capable of multitasking. So in order to

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:10.080
 elevate him, they basically make everyone else in North Korea completely incompetent. And that has

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:15.760
 a purpose because should the leader go away, this country's going to collapse overnight.

1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:22.560
 So they laugh in the West about all these newspapers show him at the factory and he's at

1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:28.480
 the fish hatchery at the paper plant. They say the difference in North Korea is that the leader goes

1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:33.200
 among the people and does what he calls field guidance. So he will go in that farm and be

1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:37.520
 like, this is what you need to do. And he'll go here and he's so smart. He's good at everything.

1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:42.480
 And thanks to him for sharing his wisdom with us. And he's not removed from the people like in every

1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:48.480
 other country. Why does that seem to go wrong with humans? Do you think that this kind of

1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:54.640
 the structure where there's this one figure, this authoritarian, this totalitarian

1:27:54.640 --> 1:28:00.400
 structure where there's one figure that's a source of comfort and knowledge.

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:06.880
 Kim Jong Il is not good at farming. Kim Jong Il is not good at the machinery. It's all a complete lie.

1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:10.880
 Or the things he'll point out will be things that are completely obvious. So here's another

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:15.360
 example that they use. In North Korea, they have something called the Tower of the Juche Idea,

1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:19.600
 which is an obelisk, which looks like the Washington Monument, but it's completely different

1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:25.600
 because it's got this like plastic torch at the top. And they talk about in their propaganda how

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:33.920
 all the architects got together and they said, oh, we should make this the second tallest

1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:39.840
 stone obelisk in the world. And Kim Jong Il says, no, let's make it the tallest. They're like,

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:44.880
 we never thought of this before. And the way it's presented as it, and like he's the first person

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:49.040
 thing of this, like these architects are having a brainstorming session of the Tower of the Juche

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:53.520
 Idea. They're like, all right, we got to do something innovative to put North Korea on the map.

1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.880
 What can we do? How about second biggest? He's going to go for this. And then he's like, oh,

1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:05.680
 we never thought of this. It's so, because I present it at face value, people sometimes say

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:10.240
 the books a satire. It's not a satire. I downplayed all this stuff. It's a farce. Here's another

1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:14.960
 example. North Korea is very big, and I think Russia is to some extent too, on amusement parks,

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:19.200
 fun fairs, they call them in the British style, because this is the chance for the people to

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:25.440
 all together. And there was this amusement park. It's almost like South Park, the Cartman, where

1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:33.200
 there's all these rides. And Kim Jong Il is like, I'm not going to let any elderly or children take

1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:40.960
 these rides until I put myself in danger and ride them myself. And they go, but dear leader,

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:47.920
 it's drizzling. And he goes, no, I have to make sure these rides are going to be safe for everyone,

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:52.160
 even during the light rain. They go, well, can we go on these rides with you? No, no, no,

1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:56.800
 I have to be the courageous one. And he's riding all the rides and they're standing there crying at

1:29:56.800 --> 1:30:01.680
 his courage. But that's what's, and you ask all the things in one power, it's like, listen, I'm

1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:07.600
 quite confident that those fun fair engineers are in a position to ride modest mouse, whatever

1:30:07.600 --> 1:30:12.640
 it's called by themselves and be like, yeah, okay, this is good for the kids. Although to be fair,

1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:16.000
 some of those amusement parks are not are pretty rusty and dangerous.

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:23.760
 That kind of propaganda, I guess what I'm playing a devil's advocate is like, it's comforting and

1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:31.520
 it's useful. But it does seem that that naturally leads to an abuse of power.

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:38.480
 But how can it be used correctly? No one person has the intellect or the mind to understand

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:42.560
 the entirety of an economy, let alone every individual field of interest.

1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:47.440
 Well, for example, you can have an artificial intelligence system that understands the

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:52.560
 entirety of it. Your effect just completely changed. The mask slipped. I guess you could have an

1:30:52.560 --> 1:31:02.320
 artificial intelligence system. But like, the question is, can that mean like the human version

1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:06.720
 of that is like, you can hire a lot of experts, right? You can be an extremely good manager.

1:31:07.440 --> 1:31:13.360
 Since everything's dynamic, it's not gonna, they're not gonna have the data to kind of manage it well.

1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:19.120
 It seems that there's like what George Washington allegedly did. It seems like most humans are

1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:25.120
 not able to fire themselves. You're not able to like, yeah, you're right, ultimately be a check

1:31:25.120 --> 1:31:32.560
 on your own power. But that's not if I was like, if I was creating a human is like, that's not an

1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:41.840
 obvious bug of the system that we would not be able to fire ourselves to know when we have,

1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:46.640
 I mean, it seems like that's something you have to know always. Like that's something I often

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:51.760
 wonder is like, am I wrong about this? Well, this is what we talked about earlier. What are the safety

1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:58.000
 valves? Yeah. To make sure that, okay, if I am incorrect or my knowledge is finite, Plato's cave

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:03.840
 kind of thing, what mechanisms are in place that my mistake or limited information isn't going to

1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:08.320
 have the deleterious consequences. And North Korea does not really have that. And as a result,

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:15.840
 they had polio in the 90s. So there is a, you, you write about it straight, but there's a humor to

1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:25.840
 it because it's an absurdly evil place, I suppose. Yeah. A bunch of people, I asked, I asked, I said

1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:30.240
 that I'm talking to you and a bunch of fast questions. Oh, I gotta hear from the plebs.

1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:34.720
 You asked me before we started recording, I specifically said no, it was in my contract.

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:40.560
 Yeah. And you gave, I gave you all the pink skittles or whatever. But they,

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:45.760
 So pink skittles. You don't think. I'm trolling, Michael. Let me explain to you how that works.

1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:55.040
 If people should go to malice.locals.com and sign up and pay, I think the membership fee is

1:32:55.040 --> 1:33:01.520
 several thousand dollars. It's very, it's not. It's not for the layman. Yeah. But the service is

1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:08.000
 excellent. You get a coat with it. But yeah, I went there, posted a lot of really brilliant

1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:13.760
 people there. People should join that community. If you find Michael interesting, or if you just

1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:22.080
 want to go and say why he's wrong, it's a great place to have that. I show you. Yeah. A lot of

1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:28.400
 really kind people. So anyway, there's a bunch of people asked that we should talk about humor.

1:33:28.400 --> 1:33:32.880
 Okay. So pretend hypothetically speaking that I'm a robot,

1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:42.640
 asking you to explain humor to me. What? So dear reader, I mean, there's a humor,

1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:54.080
 you're so wonderfully danced between serious dark topics and then seriously dark humor.

1:33:54.800 --> 1:34:01.360
 Can you try to, if you were to write like a, I don't know, a Wikipedia article, maybe a book

1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:05.520
 about your philosophy of humor. What do you think is the role of humor in all of this?

1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:10.560
 A joke is like a baby. You can't dissect it and then put it back together and expect it to work.

1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:16.240
 Trust me on this one. Despite, no matter how you carve that thing up, it's not going to be

1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:20.800
 working the next day. And you need it to sew those little sneakers with those hands.

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:27.120
 I don't know that humor is something that is very explainable. People, there's something called

1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:32.240
 claptor where this is like the worst kind of humor where people applaud because they agree

1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:37.840
 with what you're saying. That's supposed to lapped her. That's the poetry reading.

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:42.160
 Yeah. And the drag queens do that too. I think because they have the nails.

1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:48.160
 You laugh, it's a visceral reaction. When someone on Twitter is insisting, you know,

1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:54.800
 that's not funny, you're not in a position to make that claim. And let's go back to North Korea.

1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:00.880
 I had a refugee I knew and he went to high school here and he was talking to his buddies

1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:05.760
 and they said, hey, remember when we were kids, we had Pokemon and he goes, oh yeah,

1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:09.760
 except instead of Pokemon, I watched my dad start to death, which is the truth. Now,

1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:16.960
 who are any of us to tell him not to make that joke? I don't know what it's like watching anyone,

1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:22.080
 including my dad, start to death and my dad's fatty, so he's not going hungry anytime soon.

1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:31.200
 So it's very bizarre to me when people feel comfortable precluding others

1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:36.320
 from making jokes, especially, and I think this is a very Jewish thing,

1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:40.880
 like this kind of gallows humor, especially when it's some laughing about a personal

1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:49.760
 loss or experience that they've had. Humor is a great way to mitigate pain and suffering,

1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:53.520
 but it's also, I think this, why it's a Jewish thing, it's a black thing,

1:35:53.520 --> 1:36:00.160
 when you are a marginalized community or poorer, it's free. Telling stories, telling jokes or

1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:06.320
 songs, you don't have to have money, but you can have joy and happiness. And I think that's why

1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:11.680
 you find it so much more in kind of lower status communities than you find in like wasps who are

1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.040
 notoriously humorless. Which is strange because people pay you a lot of money for the jokes you

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:24.080
 do, so it's not really free. Yeah, well, nope, they don't have to pay me. It's appreciated,

1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:29.760
 but not expected. I find my voice cracking every time I try to make a joke, like I fail miserably

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:37.280
 at this. Some people... You're still in beta, that's a lie. Alpha. Sure. Being an alpha is

1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:41.280
 like being a lady. If you have to help people, you are, you aren't. No, I meant alpha version.

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:48.800
 Oh, okay. I don't know if you're a robot govily cook. I'm not going there, okay.

1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:54.880
 Who are you talking to? In my own head. I'm talking to myself in my own head. Okay,

1:36:54.880 --> 1:37:04.080
 speaking of North Korea, some people say that, you know, I've read that comedy is about timing.

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:07.280
 Well, first of all, do you agree? Yes. And second of all...

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:14.000
 No, I'm serious. No, just that you're saying yes at that time. Yeah, it's funny. Okay.

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:18.160
 Isn't it comedy's tragedy plus timing? Isn't that the full reference?

1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.400
 What is it? The interrupting cow knock knock joke? I'm not going to do it, but...

1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:26.880
 That's not a timing thing. It's more of a repetition and then the twist ending.

1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:29.680
 No, the moo. Oh, the moo. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:37.040
 Interrupting cow. You think it's the banana one. Anyway, I'm not going there.

1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:40.080
 Yet, you're... Who are you talking to? In my own head.

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:40.800
 In my own head.

1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:46.080
 Are you small, wonder? Do you stand sleeping in a wardrobe?

1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:51.360
 Yeah, that's so British. But yet, you're very...

1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:54.240
 I don't want to say in a closet because that has connotations.

1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.720
 Let's both come out of the closet for a second and let's talk about...

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:04.240
 I love you, Lex. I wasn't saying I love you, Alex. I was saying I love you, Lex.

1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:07.520
 Oh, you were talking to me. Yes, through the screen.

1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:11.600
 So you think about me when you're with another man.

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:12.880
 I watch it when you're sleeping.

1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:16.240
 Okay, so you're on... Like a bangle song.

1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:18.480
 You're really active on Twitter. Yeah.

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.680
 And somebody else asked on your overly expensive membership site...

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:26.880
 Like grift site.

1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:34.560
 How do you find humor different in writing on Twitter versus spoken humor?

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:36.160
 Oh, that's a great question.

1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:41.120
 If humor is about timing, how do you capture the timing and the brilliance

1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:45.120
 of the whatever is underlying humor in the context of Twitter?

1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:54.160
 Like another way to say it is how do you be funny and yet thoughtful on Twitter?

1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:58.640
 So with Twitter, you have to be the first one to the punchline.

1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:01.600
 So when Ron Paul had his stroke, I was immediately being like,

1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:03.600
 he's still the most articulate libertarian.

1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.920
 He's doing a great job by an impression right now.

1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:07.600
 All the libertarians got ass mad.

1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:12.400
 People like too soon or like when someone dies, you're making the jokes about them.

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:15.840
 It's like, when do you want to make the jokes about someone just died a week later?

1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:16.800
 It doesn't make any sense.

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.640
 Now, you might... Too soon is perfect timing.

1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:21.120
 Or you could say it's not appropriate ever,

1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:24.240
 but too soon does not make sense in this context.

1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.400
 So that is something that I enjoy doing.

1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:32.480
 It's also fun ruffling people's feathers, something I enjoy doing.

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:40.000
 I think spoken versus writing is very different because when you are having

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:46.880
 good banter with someone, for me as the audience, knowing that it is on the spot,

1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:50.960
 really adds an element of humor because then it's like, wow, this is fun.

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:52.800
 It's like a ping pong match or something.

1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:56.800
 Whereas in writing, you're losing the tone.

1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:01.520
 You're losing the relationship of a dynamic conversation.

1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:06.320
 And a lot of times the joke is just going to be a different type of joke.

1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:10.960
 Well, it's funny, but Twitter, there's a sense, especially your Twitter,

1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:16.080
 that you just thought of that and you just wrote it.

1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:17.120
 Yes.

1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:24.560
 There's a feeling like it's literally you talking as opposed to what I imagine is

1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:27.680
 there's some editing or it doesn't look like it.

1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:29.360
 Whoever your editor is should be fired.

1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:33.760
 There's an interesting effect actually.

1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:41.600
 If I want to say something, I don't know, about something that's bothering me

1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:43.520
 about the presidential election or something like that.

1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:48.000
 Like, what is the actual central idea that I'm trying to convey to myself?

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:51.680
 Like, if, say, I was having a hypothetically conversation with myself.

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:52.480
 What?

1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:54.000
 No, not going there.

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.640
 Why am I putting my pants back on?

1:40:56.640 --> 1:40:58.000
 I'm more comfortable this way.

1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:03.280
 Promo code malis20, sheathunderwear.com.

1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:04.080
 Okay.

1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:11.920
 That's sheath, what is it, what's the website?

1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:12.960
 sheathunderwear.com.

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:16.720
 Sheathunderwear.com, promo code malis20.

1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:19.680
 And I forgot, why is that underwear really nice?

1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:23.200
 Because it has a dual pouch technology to keep your man parts separate.

1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:25.440
 They've also got woman stuff, but I don't know how that works.

1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:27.360
 If there's a thing worth going somewhere.

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:28.960
 And the material is really refreshing.

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:29.920
 I mean, it's really a good case.

1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:31.120
 And it makes your ass look good.

1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:34.320
 That's promo code malis20.

1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:39.120
 And it's made by a former vet because he was in Iraq.

1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:40.720
 So that's why I like promoting it.

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:41.280
 Yeah.

1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:49.200
 But what I'm writing the tweet, it forces me to think deeply about the core of the message.

1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:54.800
 But what I found this really interesting effect, I don't really do much editing on the tweet.

1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:56.800
 I'll just think and then I'll write it.

1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:05.920
 And then when I post it, submit, I immediately see the tweet very differently than it was in my mind.

1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:12.720
 Huh? I often delete, I don't know, some percentage of tweets about like two, five seconds after.

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:13.680
 Wow.

1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:14.160
 I don't know.

1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:19.200
 It's something, once you send it, it's why the Gmail send features,

1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:21.200
 undo send features really nice.

1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:23.520
 It's like, it just changes the way I see the thing.

1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:25.280
 It's very interesting.

1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:32.720
 It's, but I really love it that you can delete it because when I say stuff out in the wild,

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:40.560
 like the other humans, like spoken, spoken word is like, you can't delete what you just said.

1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:44.640
 And I often regret the things I say, like in, in on the spot.

1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:46.080
 Like I shouldn't have said that.

1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:46.400
 Really?

1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:47.200
 Yeah.

1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:48.000
 I don't have that.

1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:53.120
 Well, again, whoever your editor is, what is it?

1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:55.120
 Edith Piaf.

1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:57.680
 Genère, I cut your hand.

1:42:58.320 --> 1:42:59.920
 Wow, your French is as bad as your English.

1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:09.600
 Um, I don't have any tweets I regret because if I sent a tweet that I regretted, I would

1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:10.400
 make amends.

1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:17.760
 I would make it a point if I was a needlessly offensive to somebody or hurtful or accidentally,

1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:24.720
 I would make sure to fix it and, and go out of my way to make sure that person feels vindicated

1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:26.960
 and validated by accepting my apology.

1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:28.400
 That has never happened.

1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:30.000
 Had to happen, thankfully.

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:35.520
 I'm also someone who is not big on taking the bait.

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:39.840
 Uh, you know, some recently, some people have come after me pretty hard.

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:43.680
 And my perspective is that it's not really about me.

1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:46.640
 It's either I represent something to them.

1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:49.280
 I'm just some jackass with a Twitter.

1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:52.880
 So if you're getting this riled up over me, it's not really about me.

1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:54.080
 Maybe I'm delusional.

1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:55.280
 That's how I look at it.

1:43:55.280 --> 1:43:59.840
 So if they are trying to provoke me into this kind of heated exchange, I will never

1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:03.120
 do it, uh, because that's not, I'm not interested in it.

1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:06.560
 And it's, I don't think there's going to be any, it's like Janet Rankin.

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.080
 You, you can't win.

1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:10.080
 It's just going to be like trying to win a hurricane.

1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:12.080
 And there's, there's no hero here.

1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:13.200
 Well, let me ask you about this.

1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:16.560
 Cause somebody also asked that on your overly expensive membership site,

1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:20.400
 that like they were saying that they're an academic.

1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:25.040
 They wonder, cause I'm an, I'm not an academic, but I do still have an affiliation

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:28.400
 with MIT. I, the word academic is dirty.

1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:32.240
 It's like, which is a problem that needs to change.

1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:34.560
 It's just like the word nerd is dirty.

1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:37.360
 No, academic needs is going to be the next front to open.

1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:38.800
 And they're going to be very vilified.

1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:39.680
 We're coming for them.

1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:41.760
 And it's going to be very, very ugly.

1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:42.640
 And I cannot wait.

1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:48.720
 No, but there needs to be a place, a different term for people who love

1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:50.640
 research and knowledge.

1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:51.200
 Oh, that's true.

1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:51.680
 That's very fair.

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:52.320
 Like you have to.

1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:52.880
 No, you're right.

1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:53.520
 100%.

1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:53.920
 You're right.

1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:57.920
 So like there, you have to, you have to clarify what you mean by academic.

1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:02.480
 And right now the word academic means a very, in the intellectual public discourse,

1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:03.600
 it means the enemy.

1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:10.320
 And there's a lot of people that perhaps deserve that targeted vilification,

1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:12.240
 but like a lot that don't.

1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:13.600
 They're just curious people.

1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:14.960
 You're absolutely right.

1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:18.320
 Building, building robots that will one day destroy you.

1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:20.080
 Voice cracks every time I make a joke.

1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:21.040
 You're not consistent.

1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:21.680
 I can't do this.

1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:24.320
 Because you're not making a joke because you're telling truth.

1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:25.360
 I'm editing.

1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:27.440
 Can I delete that joke?

1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:29.040
 Okay.

1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:30.000
 That's not even a joke.

1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:33.680
 Robots, building robots that will one day kill us.

1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:35.760
 Oh, God willing.

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:37.360
 You God willing.

1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:38.480
 Humans are the joke.

1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:39.840
 That's why I'm cracking.

1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:40.960
 My voice is cracking.

1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:45.040
 What were even, what was I even fucking saying?

1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:45.600
 Academics.

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:46.160
 Academics.

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:48.080
 But why?

1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:49.360
 My locals, someone had a question.

1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:50.240
 They're in academic.

1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:50.720
 Right.

1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:51.440
 They're in academic.

1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:58.640
 They're saying, like, are you worried that, you know, in academia, associating yourself

1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:05.200
 with a sort of somebody who has, who can be misconstrued to have radical ideas,

1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:08.080
 like the two examples they gave is Michael Malice and Joe Rogan.

1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:11.600
 Is Joe have any radical?

1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:13.120
 I wouldn't consider him radical at all.

1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.040
 Well, we can talk about it.

1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:16.880
 But Joe is, I think, a bad example.

1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:18.800
 He's quite centrist to me.

1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:24.240
 Well, he could have, for example, like, what has Joe been attacked on?

1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:31.520
 It's, for example, on the topic of, like, transgender, like athletes and sports.

1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:34.400
 There's, what else?

1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:37.120
 I mean, he's been pro Bernie Sanders.

1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:43.120
 And that's how pro Trump or, like, giving Trump a pass.

1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:44.480
 Yeah, anti Trump.

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:45.360
 Not anti Trump.

1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:47.600
 Yeah, oh, what else?

1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:50.880
 Just, but none of these are radical.

1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:54.640
 Meat, meat stuff being pro meat versus anti vegan.

1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:57.200
 Yeah, you know, all those kinds of things.

1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:01.680
 But you could be misconstrued and, and saying, there's, I think, a highlight.

1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:04.960
 My mom actually wrote to me about this, which is hilarious.

1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:06.240
 Thank you.

1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:08.560
 I like how you got it down.

1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:09.840
 It's when it's important.

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:10.880
 Well, I see your mom wrote to you.

1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:12.640
 That's, that's a sign.

1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.320
 My voice cracks a sign when, when Michael Malus makes a funny joke.

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:17.600
 So when you jot something down.

1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:23.760
 He writes it.

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:25.600
 And then the next time he crosses it out.

1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:30.720
 It's like Joe Biden and the debates.

1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:31.040
 Okay.

1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:33.920
 It did also just crap my pants.

1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:38.560
 So, it's like a mud slide down here.

1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:41.360
 There is a, I mean, he's a comedian.

1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:44.480
 And you have a comedian side to you, right?

1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:47.040
 I mean, you're, you've talked about humorous side.

1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:47.280
 Yeah.

1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:48.000
 Humorist is.

1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:51.920
 So you can misconstru like Joe as being somehow a radical

1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:54.320
 thinker and then the same one could be done with you.

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:57.920
 And his question was how are you worried about

1:47:57.920 --> 1:47:59.600
 associating yourself with folks like that?

1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:01.040
 Am I or you?

1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:02.240
 I'm me, me.

1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:03.520
 Yeah, that's a good question.

1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:09.200
 And is that something, do you see yourself as somebody

1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:13.600
 who's dangerous that I shouldn't be talking to?

1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:20.560
 And in the same way, do you, do you ever think about guests on

1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:24.560
 your podcast or people you talk to publicly,

1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:28.640
 associate yourself with publicly and think that there

1:48:28.640 --> 1:48:31.840
 is somebody that crosses that line that you shouldn't talk to?

1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:34.880
 So I interviewed in the new ride.

1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:37.040
 I interviewed like up to full blown Nazis in the last

1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:38.320
 chapters about Chris Cantwell.

1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:40.640
 But that was in the context of that book, right?

1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:44.400
 So there's lots of people who people want me to have on my show.

1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:48.080
 And the way I look at it is like you have a table and tablecloth,

1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:48.320
 right?

1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:51.920
 And let's suppose the table is three feet wide.

1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:53.760
 The tablecloth is two feet wide.

1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:57.200
 So if I move the tablecloth to the right, I'm going to lose

1:48:57.200 --> 1:48:58.160
 people on the left.

1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:00.000
 I can only cover so much space.

1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.560
 And the further you go in the fringe in one direction,

1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:05.520
 the more mainstream you're going to lose in the other direction.

1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:10.160
 So I'm very much making a conscious choice not to talk to,

1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:12.480
 being people will say I'm cowardly.

1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:13.440
 And that's absolutely true.

1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:15.040
 I'm being fearful here.

1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:20.080
 I would prefer not to talk to some of those who would alienate

1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:22.560
 some of the more mainstream people.

1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:25.040
 And here's a perfect example of why.

1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:27.840
 On my birthday last year, I woke up seven o clock in the morning

1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:28.880
 to go pee.

1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:30.480
 And I checked Twitter, whatever.

1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:32.640
 And Jeb Bush had followed me.

1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:32.960
 Jeb.

1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:36.720
 And I did seven AM.

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:37.680
 You're not really awake.

1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:38.400
 You're like, wait, what?

1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:39.840
 And then I thought maybe it was a fake account,

1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:41.040
 but it's in the verified tab.

1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:42.800
 Oh, you don't have this because you're not verified on Twitter.

1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:43.280
 That's a shame.

1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:45.440
 So people who matter on Twitter.

1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:48.160
 Twitter does not respect robots.

1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:50.400
 They ban bots.

1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:51.440
 You're lucky I'm in there.

1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:52.800
 Zero, one.

1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:53.840
 Zero, zero.

1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:55.200
 It's zero, zero, zero.

1:49:55.760 --> 1:49:56.800
 Those are my pronouns.

1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:03.360
 So it was Jeb, Jeb Governor Bush.

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:06.880
 And I corresponded with him and I asked him on the show

1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:09.200
 and he decided not to for various reasons.

1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:09.840
 Very politely.

1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:11.360
 He's like, just politics is so bad right now.

1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:12.160
 I don't want to talk about it.

1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:13.920
 And I respect that for him.

1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:18.240
 If I am in a space, if I'm creating my show,

1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:23.760
 where he's going to get heat and get canceled.

1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:24.720
 Oh, you can't be on the show.

1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:26.080
 He has these other guests.

1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:28.000
 I don't want to lose that opportunity because,

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.280
 as we were talking about earlier,

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:31.040
 me and Alex shows in Tim Pool,

1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:34.160
 I think a lot of people would be very excited

1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:35.920
 to see me sit down with Jeb Bush.

1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:38.160
 And I told him in writing and I meant this.

1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:39.280
 I wouldn't be clowning him.

1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:41.600
 I wouldn't be disrespectful.

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:43.040
 It would be a lot of fun.

1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:45.440
 There's a goofball side to him that comes out sometimes

1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:47.200
 and I would do my best to bring that out

1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:49.040
 and talk about what it's like being a blue blood.

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:50.480
 To be born into his grandfather,

1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:53.040
 Prescott Bush was a senator from Connecticut.

1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:55.680
 Marrying a woman didn't speak English.

1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:57.360
 How does that work when your family's royalty

1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:58.000
 and things like that?

1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000
 So, I had a lot of fun questions for him

1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.320
 and you're going to have to choose one or the other.

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:04.160
 Well, you do a really good job of that.

1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:06.160
 Like Ben Shapiro does a good job of that too,

1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:11.520
 which is you can have a trolley side, a humor side,

1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:13.840
 where you tear down the power structures and so on.

1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:16.240
 But you can also have a serious side

1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:18.320
 and it's a safe space for people

1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:19.920
 from all walks of life to walk in.

1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:22.560
 And you're not adversarial.

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:23.040
 Never.

1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:25.760
 I take the word guest seriously.

1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:27.440
 If they're going to be on my show,

1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:30.720
 I'm not going to have them have negative consequences

1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:32.560
 as a result of being on my show.

1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:34.800
 That said, I mean, maybe in my case,

1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:40.320
 I'll be honest and say that I find Alex Jones

1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:42.960
 outside of the conspiracy stuff.

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:44.800
 For some reason, maybe you can explain,

1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:46.080
 maybe you can psychoanalyze me,

1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:49.120
 but I find him hilarious to listen to.

1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:49.920
 He's a performer.

1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:51.280
 He's very performative.

1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:54.160
 But there's a lot of people that don't see the humor of it

1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:56.640
 and they see the serious consequences

1:51:56.640 --> 1:51:59.280
 of spreading conspiracy theories of different kinds.

1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:04.320
 And they see the danger of it.

1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:12.320
 And I personally, I'm often tempted to talk to Alex

1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:13.520
 in a podcast format,

1:52:14.080 --> 1:52:18.080
 but I think I'm trying to convince myself that I never will.

1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:22.000
 Well, for me, I feel unsafe talking to Alex

1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:26.320
 because I can't truly be myself, which is like...

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:27.520
 Yeah, you'd have to be on.

1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:28.640
 Naive and honest.

1:52:28.640 --> 1:52:29.440
 Yeah.

1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:33.520
 And like, and actually, I generally,

1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:35.920
 when I talk to humans, I want to see the best in them.

1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:40.240
 And I think that's, like, I often think about

1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:44.480
 if I talk to Hitler in 1935, 1938.

1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:45.760
 You got to list the names to give him.

1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:49.760
 Well, yeah, I mean, that's how you get the interview.

1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:51.440
 Come on, let's be honest.

1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:54.000
 Who are we kidding?

1:52:56.320 --> 1:52:57.120
 I would...

1:52:57.120 --> 1:52:58.400
 You have to give away one of your...

1:52:58.400 --> 1:52:59.840
 I would probably give away one of my brothers.

1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:00.240
 So...

1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:01.360
 How many brothers do you have?

1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:02.080
 We'll just one.

1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:02.400
 Okay.

1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:03.520
 Too many.

1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:05.680
 I want to be an only child.

1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:07.680
 He's the older brother.

1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:08.800
 He used to pick on me.

1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:09.520
 Payback.

1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:10.240
 You know, it's only...

1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:11.200
 He had a good life.

1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:12.640
 You should think of it more Stalin.

1:53:12.640 --> 1:53:13.440
 I'm sorry to interrupt you

1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:14.960
 because Hitler, you're Jewish.

1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:17.600
 So you're already going to have a very adversarial.

1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:18.400
 It's not going to be a normal...

1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:21.120
 He's not going to perceive you as a human in a sense, right?

1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:21.680
 Right.

1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:22.080
 So it's...

1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:22.800
 Stalin, you're right.

1:53:22.800 --> 1:53:24.080
 Yeah, that would be much easier.

1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:26.240
 Or Kim Jong Un or something like that.

1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:27.360
 Okay, do you think...

1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:27.840
 Like, how...

1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:29.040
 Okay, this is a good question.

1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:29.920
 Is it?

1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:30.320
 And that's...

1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:32.880
 Why don't you jot something down?

1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:35.200
 If you...

1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:37.280
 Wolfs, gloves, Hitler.

1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:40.880
 All right, we'll cross it out in a second.

1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:42.800
 Prove.

1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:45.600
 I think this is a really good example

1:53:45.600 --> 1:53:48.160
 of a difficult figure that's controversial

1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:50.480
 that people bring up to me a lot

1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:51.920
 and you've interviewed twice,

1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:53.680
 which is Curtis Jarvan.

1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:54.720
 Yeah, Manchester Möhlberg.

1:53:54.720 --> 1:53:56.880
 Manchester Möhlberg, aka Manchester Möhlberg,

1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:01.040
 which is his pseudonym that he goes by in his blog.

1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:03.040
 Can you tell me about who he is?

1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:03.920
 Sure.

1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:04.720
 Why is he interesting?

1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:06.640
 What are his ideas are interesting?

1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:09.440
 Well, briefly, he invented the concept, the red pill.

1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:12.640
 So, Curtis, Manchester Möhlberg had a blog

1:54:12.640 --> 1:54:14.160
 called Unqualified Reservations.

1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:15.760
 You can still find it online.

1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:17.120
 It's very verbose.

1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:20.160
 He writes at length, very, very bright.

1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:24.560
 His perspective is very heretical.

1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:27.760
 So, a lot of things that we take for granted

1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:30.880
 in our liberal democracy, he regards as

1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:32.800
 not only incorrect, which is downright absurd,

1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:33.680
 and does not...

1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:37.440
 He does not take what many people view

1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:40.640
 as the basis of American political discourse

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:43.200
 as the basis for his thought.

1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:47.920
 So, when you're starting with someone

1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:52.720
 who is basically repudiating kind of the Western worldview,

1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:54.800
 or not the Western worldview, like the American milieu,

1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.600
 a lot of people are going to, of course,

1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:01.360
 regard him as dangerous or someone who is verboten.

1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:04.320
 He's a very bright person.

1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:07.360
 Why is he such a toxic figure?

1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:13.760
 Because if you are blue pilled, if you are the guardians

1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:16.240
 of what is acceptable discourse,

1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:20.400
 then you have to make sure your forts are secured,

1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:23.840
 and that any figure outside of this acceptable discourse

1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:28.240
 has to be marginalized and regarded as radioactive as possible.

1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:32.640
 You don't want to let in these kind of ideas

1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:34.400
 that would be destructive to your hegemony.

1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:36.400
 Well, so let's dig into it.

1:55:36.400 --> 1:55:39.760
 So, I've read a few things by him,

1:55:39.760 --> 1:55:43.840
 but then I hear that in a bunch of places,

1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.880
 him being called a racist, a white supremacist,

1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:48.960
 neo fascist, so on.

1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:51.280
 I go to his Wikipedia.

1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:54.400
 There's a view on race section.

1:55:56.320 --> 1:55:57.360
 Let me read it.

1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:00.240
 Yavin's opinions have been described as racist,

1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:03.440
 with his writings interpreted as supportive of slavery,

1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:06.080
 including the belief that whites have higher IQs

1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:07.840
 than blacks for genetic reasons.

1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:11.680
 Yavin himself maintains that he's not a racist

1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:14.080
 because while he doubts that, quote,

1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:15.600
 all races are equally smart,

1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.600
 the notion, quote,

1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:19.680
 that people who score higher on IQ tests

1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:22.880
 than some sense superior human beings is, quote, creepy.

1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:27.200
 He also disputes being an outspoken advocate for slavery,

1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:30.400
 though he has argued that some races are more suited

1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:32.640
 for slavery than others, quote,

1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:36.800
 it should be obvious that although I'm not a white nationalist,

1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:39.200
 I am not exactly allergic to the stuff.

1:56:39.680 --> 1:56:43.040
 Yavin wrote in a post that linked approvingly of,

1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:45.200
 I don't know, these people, Steve Saylor.

1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:46.240
 Steve Saylor, yeah, he's from.

1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:48.640
 Jared Taylor and other racialists.

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:49.840
 Yeah, so.

1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:52.320
 Okay, so like, one of my questions is.

1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:54.720
 Let me just say one sentence.

1:56:54.720 --> 1:56:56.640
 In the same way that you had,

1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:57.760
 you were mentioned that guy earlier,

1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:00.080
 who was defending some aspects of communism,

1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:02.960
 and that is in some contexts acceptable.

1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:04.160
 When you think about it, it's like,

1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:05.840
 this should be radioactive.

1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:09.280
 The fact that he is engaging with these ideas

1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:13.040
 in anything other than this has to be repudiated at all costs

1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:16.000
 is what renders him to a large extent a racist.

1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:17.120
 That's really interesting.

1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:22.160
 So there are some topics you can be nuanced and some not.

1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:26.240
 And communism is still a topic that you can be nuanced about.

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:28.080
 It's difficult, but you can be.

1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:31.920
 Race, and this, like talking about slavery

1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:35.520
 and IQ differences based on race is a topic

1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:39.200
 that I guess is radioactive to a degree

1:57:39.200 --> 1:57:41.200
 where you can't even say anything,

1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:47.200
 even if it's nuanced or not even making a point.

1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:50.160
 It's like touching it as you make another point.

1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:52.480
 And understandably, you can understand that.

1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:54.560
 I'm going to steel man their point

1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:55.760
 because you can understand the point.

1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:57.360
 It's like, you're just talking about Hitler.

1:57:57.360 --> 1:57:59.200
 Once this foot gets in the door,

1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:02.080
 that some people are inherently slaves,

1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:04.000
 or some people are inherently better than others,

1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.560
 it really quickly collapses.

1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:07.600
 So that would be their perspective.

1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:10.560
 But that's what, like, if I were to give criticism of his...

1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:11.920
 But let me just say one more thing.

1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:14.800
 Racist is also used to describe Alex Jones.

1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:16.720
 Alex doesn't talk about race.

1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:18.720
 Racist is a shorthand.

1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:21.920
 Racist is a shorthand for a certain percentage

1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:24.640
 of the population to let you know,

1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:28.160
 do not bother investing in this person any further.

1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:29.360
 They're off limits.

1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:31.360
 Definitely. Racism and sexism is a thing

1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:33.440
 that's now used to shut down conversation

1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:36.240
 that's quite absurd by a small percent of the population.

1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:37.840
 But Jared Taylor and Steve Saylor,

1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:39.840
 Jared Taylor interviewed him from my book,

1:58:39.840 --> 1:58:43.120
 he would be regarded in any sense as a racist.

1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:45.520
 What's the difference in racist and racialists?

1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:48.160
 So racialists, I mean, this is splitting hairs,

1:58:48.160 --> 1:58:50.320
 and now I'm going to be already active.

1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:52.320
 Jared Taylor runs something called Amron.

1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:54.800
 And this is, I mean, his perspective

1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:57.120
 is that there are inherent differences to the races,

1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:00.880
 and you cannot live side by side, well,

1:59:00.880 --> 1:59:02.880
 whites and blacks should not be living side by side.

1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:04.480
 And by the way, for people who don't know,

1:59:04.480 --> 1:59:08.560
 this is out of context that you have written a great book

1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:10.800
 that includes some of these concepts called The New Right,

1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:12.320
 which does not include these concepts,

1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:15.600
 but talks about, well, it's more about the growth

1:59:15.600 --> 1:59:21.040
 of the community around the alt rate

1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:22.640
 and all those kinds of the world.

1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:25.760
 Right. So, and his point about IQ,

1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:29.200
 it's like if you had a population, the Dutch, right?

1:59:29.200 --> 1:59:31.280
 I think they're the tallest people on earth.

1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:34.640
 And if you said, well, the Dutch are the best people on earth,

1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:35.760
 why? Because they're the tallest,

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:37.840
 it's like you're a crazy person.

1:59:37.840 --> 1:59:41.440
 So if someone is scoring low, an individual on an IQ test,

1:59:41.440 --> 1:59:44.160
 that means there's somehow a lower quality person.

1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:46.240
 Well, maybe in one very specific aspect,

1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:48.480
 but I mean, if they're a good human being,

1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:49.680
 I've got friends who are low IQ,

1:59:49.680 --> 1:59:51.840
 all my friends are low IQ, frankly, compared to me.

1:59:51.840 --> 1:59:52.880
 Sound like Trump there for a second.

1:59:52.880 --> 1:59:54.880
 That's how you choose friends.

1:59:54.880 --> 1:59:56.000
 Well, I don't have any other choices.

1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:57.360
 No one's going to be at my level.

1:59:57.360 --> 2:00:00.240
 Well, you're the smartest person since Abraham Lincoln

2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:01.920
 that I've ever seen.

2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:03.920
 Unlike him, I actually am honest.

2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:10.320
 So, he is someone who very much swims in heretical ideas.

2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:13.440
 Here's another thing, like if you bring up

2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:16.880
 that Aristotle said that some people are born to be slaves.

2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:18.000
 He wasn't speaking about race.

2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:19.920
 He just meant people's souls.

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:25.520
 H. L. Menken, who is a great heretic and early 20th century figure,

2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:28.160
 one of his quotes that I say all the time,

2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:30.320
 which people have seen a lot in this past year,

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:32.160
 that the average man does not want to be free.

2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:33.360
 He merely wants to be safe.

2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:35.680
 That, I think, I don't know.

2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:40.160
 I am not familiar with what Muldbug is saying about slavery

2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:41.920
 because his writing is ponderous,

2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:44.880
 but that certainly is something I think that is undeniable,

2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:46.160
 that I think more people are realizing

2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:48.000
 there's a large percent of the population

2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.320
 that is actively disinterested in freedom

2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:52.080
 and the moral responsibilities it entails.

2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:55.760
 Well, I mean, really just the word slavery,

2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:57.600
 if you want to make some kind of point

2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:02.000
 or even think about the topic outside the context

2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:03.680
 of this is a horrible thing that happened

2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:05.120
 in the United States history.

2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:06.880
 And other countries history is not unique to us.

2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:07.360
 Let's be clear.

2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:10.160
 This is very important in their slavery going on today.

2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:13.760
 And then a lot of people argue that sex trafficking

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:14.640
 and all those kinds of things.

2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:17.440
 I mean, there's atrocities going on today that,

2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:24.320
 talking about it in a way that's not immediately saying

2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:26.800
 this is the most horrible thing that happened ever.

2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:31.920
 It's something I think about a lot is like,

2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:33.680
 if I want to say something controversial,

2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:38.720
 I should do so with skill, with care,

2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:40.640
 and only about things I care about.

2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:42.000
 Well, here's where I would disagree.

2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:46.160
 When I often say things that are controversial,

2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:50.240
 or I will say uncontroversial things in a controversial way,

2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:53.200
 because it's a useful mechanism to alienate people

2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:54.240
 you don't want around you.

2:01:54.800 --> 2:01:57.760
 Because if there are people who are going to be shocked

2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:01.600
 by certain topics, like we should have ended World War II,

2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:03.840
 like even as a hypothesis, they just clutch their pearls,

2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:05.440
 they're like, oh, you want the Holocaust to happen,

2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:08.320
 I can't discuss most things with you.

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:10.480
 Because you're not interested in having a conversation,

2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:11.920
 you're interested in your emotional response.

2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:13.280
 Yeah, I think I see things differently.

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:15.280
 Maybe this is a bit of a devil's advocate,

2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:18.880
 but what in at least the modern discourse of Twitter

2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:22.640
 and social media and so on, I find that if you do that,

2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:26.480
 you're not actually removing the people

2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:29.280
 that are not thoughtful and kind and so on.

2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:31.680
 You're actually attracting loud people.

2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:33.840
 Like a small number of them, they come over

2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:35.200
 and start yelling at you.

2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:39.120
 Start yelling, they're basically ruin the party

2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:42.080
 by showing up and just screaming.

2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:43.760
 And so all the thoughtful people leave.

2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:46.080
 Well, that's why you have to be a very heavy blocker.

2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:48.000
 You have to block people on Twitter

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.840
 because you have to cultivate your audience

2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:51.760
 and have them, like a lot of times people come at me,

2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:54.720
 I don't care, then they'll start attacking members of my audience.

2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:56.160
 And then I'm like, dang, I got to block them

2:02:56.160 --> 2:02:58.400
 because they've won this one, because I can't have that.

2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:03.120
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:07.200
 Unnecessarily provoking people feels...

2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:12.400
 This is beta testing.

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:14.320
 You try to break the system and see what works.

2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:16.080
 You put up as much pressure as possible.

2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:19.040
 This is very much computer stuff

2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:20.800
 that you should be able to appreciate.

2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:22.400
 The point being, when you have a program,

2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:24.000
 you're trying to intentionally sit there

2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.560
 and do as many mistakes to see what go wrong, right?

2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:28.560
 Is that not common practice?

2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:29.120
 Yeah, exactly.

2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:34.480
 So you're saying that's a way to see communication with the world

2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:37.280
 as you say something uncontroversial

2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:40.560
 in a controversial way and that blocks people that...

2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:41.760
 Or does it trigger them?

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:43.200
 Do they roll their eyes?

2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:45.280
 What is going to be their emotional response?

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:46.800
 Or are they going to start yelling?

2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:50.000
 The problem is the reason I can't think like this,

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:56.000
 or I can't, because I'm not sure about the points I'm trying to make always.

2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.640
 I'm not always 100% sure that I'm right about things.

2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:04.080
 So in being thoughtful, I'm afraid that I'll turn off...

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:09.600
 With an ineliquently phrased or even incorrect statement,

2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:13.600
 I will do damage that can't be undone in terms of

2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:17.040
 having a good conversation about a topic.

2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:20.160
 So I want to be very careful about...

2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:22.400
 Like, I'm not saying afraid.

2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:24.560
 Fear is not what I'm talking about.

2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:30.080
 I think fear is not saying something out of fears

2:04:30.080 --> 2:04:32.480
 at the core of the many of the problems of the world today.

2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:36.240
 But I'm just saying, say stuff with care.

2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:39.120
 If I'm going to touch race as a topic,

2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:43.200
 it feels like you really should be deeply...

2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:45.120
 First, have a point to make.

2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:47.680
 Like, you really care about a point you want to make.

2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:51.200
 And second, think deeply about how to say that point

2:04:51.200 --> 2:04:53.920
 in a way that communicates it the best.

2:04:53.920 --> 2:04:57.120
 And touching, I would say...

2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:00.080
 Listen, I've...

2:05:00.080 --> 2:05:00.800
 I've...

2:05:00.800 --> 2:05:03.200
 On your show, which is great.

2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:07.200
 I mean, I'd like to say thank you for having Mention's mobile...

2:05:07.200 --> 2:05:08.000
 You are welcome.

2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:13.520
 That's the name of the show.

2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:15.200
 Thank you for having me a couple of times.

2:05:15.200 --> 2:05:18.560
 It's great to sort of get him to, in this loose way,

2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:20.560
 to talk about different kinds of stuff.

2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:21.920
 I don't think we talk about race at all.

2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:22.560
 No, no, no, no.

2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:25.120
 No, but I'm just bringing it back to what you were asking,

2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:27.200
 which is if you read the Wikipedia,

2:05:27.200 --> 2:05:29.120
 the perspective is going to be this guy talks

2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:30.800
 about slavery constantly,

2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:33.200
 where it's completely disproportionate to his work.

2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:34.880
 But even on your show, you can tell,

2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:36.480
 even outside of the race stuff,

2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:38.960
 that he's not ultra careful about...

2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:40.240
 He's not...

2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:41.440
 Nuanced.

2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:44.480
 Yeah, he's not afraid to say something just like...

2:05:44.480 --> 2:05:46.640
 I would say, let me just criticize him,

2:05:46.640 --> 2:05:48.480
 if he does not use me,

2:05:48.480 --> 2:05:51.120
 carelessly say something controversial.

2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:51.680
 Right.

2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:54.480
 I'm not saying he doesn't go...

2:05:54.480 --> 2:05:56.080
 That makes him...

2:05:56.080 --> 2:06:00.160
 It's a very different thing than somebody who on purpose

2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:02.640
 says something controversial stuff,

2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:04.960
 like Milo Annopoulos...

2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:07.440
 Sorry, I forgot Milo, whatever his name is.

2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:08.480
 Yeah, Annopoulos, yeah.

2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:09.120
 Yeah, yeah.

2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:13.120
 Which is really nice to see that he's a genuine person

2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:14.880
 who's thoughtful, he doesn't mean to,

2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:18.800
 but he just carelessly seems to say things

2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:23.440
 that I feel like damaged the rest of his body of work.

2:06:24.480 --> 2:06:25.520
 I can't really speak for him,

2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:27.120
 but I would guess his point is,

2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:31.120
 once you're swimming in this kind of worldview,

2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:33.840
 you're going to be anathema already,

2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:35.840
 so there's no pleasing these people,

2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:36.880
 so why bother trying?

2:06:36.880 --> 2:06:38.400
 Yeah, I think that's a deeply...

2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:40.960
 That's a black pill way of seeing the world.

2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:42.080
 It's not a black pill at all,

2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:44.640
 because it's a sinful way, these people.

2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:51.200
 So it's saying that it's a very kind of way of thinking,

2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:52.800
 like, I'll say whatever I want,

2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:54.160
 whoever comes along with me...

2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:55.760
 No, you just earlier said yourself

2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:58.880
 that racism has been weaponized as a way

2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:00.480
 to shut down conversation.

2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:02.320
 So I think his perspective would be,

2:07:02.880 --> 2:07:06.400
 I am so outside the mainstream in my worldview

2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:09.760
 that I know I'm going to be called racism, racist,

2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:12.400
 so there's no point in trying to be nuanced

2:07:12.400 --> 2:07:14.480
 because I'm already going to get the scarlet letter.

2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:15.840
 Yeah, I just disagree with that,

2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:21.120
 because, for example, I am one person that he turned off

2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:22.480
 by his carelessness,

2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:25.120
 and I think I should be a good target.

2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:25.760
 I should be somebody...

2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:26.800
 I think that's fair.

2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:27.840
 And I'm just...

2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:31.520
 It's very convenient to think

2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:33.200
 that there's ridiculous people out there,

2:07:33.200 --> 2:07:34.320
 which there are,

2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:36.800
 who call everybody racist and sexist currently,

2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:38.960
 and then you can't please them,

2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:41.040
 so I'm not even going to try.

2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:44.000
 No, but there's this gray area of people

2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.960
 that I don't listen to the outrage culture, whatever...

2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:49.200
 This Wikipedia article means nothing to me.

2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:50.320
 Like, I'm not going to...

2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:51.520
 Right, I got you.

2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:53.280
 I'm more...

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:55.120
 I'm just seeing this careless person,

2:07:55.120 --> 2:08:00.480
 and if he's going to be careless about race like this,

2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:03.760
 I feel like if I walk along with him long enough,

2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:06.080
 I'm going to catch the carelessness.

2:08:06.720 --> 2:08:09.520
 I'm going to lose, like...

2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:11.440
 I'll defend your perspective better than you can.

2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:13.440
 Yeah, this is good.

2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:14.480
 I'm taking notes.

2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:15.680
 I talked to Eric Weinstein

2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:17.360
 after you guys talked about me on your show.

2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:18.480
 But now it's Weinstein.

2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:19.680
 We had a good conversation.

2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:20.800
 He invited me on his show.

2:08:20.800 --> 2:08:22.320
 That would be an amazing conversation.

2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:25.520
 And we got on the phone, and his concern, fairly,

2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:26.720
 he goes,

2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:28.240
 I don't want you to come on my show

2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:29.520
 for the purposes of clowning me.

2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:32.640
 And I would never do that.

2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:33.840
 Yeah.

2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:36.320
 He might not be aware of who...

2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:37.520
 That's why he wanted to fill me out.

2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:38.960
 He's like, you know, when he hears troll,

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:40.240
 it can mean a lot of different things.

2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:41.920
 And we had a very conversation.

2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:43.440
 It very much was very clear

2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:44.880
 that's not where the conversation would go.

2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:47.920
 But I think when you are going to be on someone's show,

2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:50.880
 there is a responsibility

2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:52.720
 that they're not going to have to pay a cost

2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:54.720
 for having you as their guest.

2:08:54.720 --> 2:08:57.920
 So if you were put off by how he was

2:08:57.920 --> 2:08:59.680
 in that live stream or two I did,

2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:01.600
 like, I understand where you're coming from.

2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:03.200
 I think he's very, very bright.

2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:04.560
 But you have a very...

2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:05.920
 You have a different audience than I do

2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:07.680
 when you're going for something different than I am.

2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:08.480
 No, no, no.

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:10.800
 In my, in just the sense of...

2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:12.640
 You wouldn't feel safe with him.

2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:13.920
 Yeah, I wouldn't feel safe with him.

2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:15.440
 But he's borne a line for me.

2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:16.320
 I think...

2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:18.160
 I would like to actually talk to him one day.

2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:21.920
 Alex Jones has crossed the other line for me.

2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:23.200
 Well, you could do what you could do with me.

2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:25.440
 Tape the episode and then never release it.

2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:30.320
 No, it's one of those things will be...

2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.080
 When there's finally...

2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:36.800
 They'll make a history channel documentary about you and I

2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:38.080
 and how it all went wrong.

2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:40.960
 Like the cult that we started and everybody killed themselves.

2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:44.160
 And there's a...

2:09:45.600 --> 2:09:48.400
 We'll release it then because it'll be like unseen footage.

2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:50.320
 This is how it started.

2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.240
 It'll be black and white in a basement somewhere in New York.

2:09:56.240 --> 2:09:57.920
 Yeah, my mother's basement.

2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:01.280
 Let's explain so much.

2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:01.600
 Okay.

2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:07.520
 So I spoke to Yaron Brooke about objectivism.

2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:12.720
 And I and Rand, he kind of argued...

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:15.760
 He highlighted a difference between capitalism and anarchism

2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:24.560
 as around the topic of violence and that having government

2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:27.520
 be the sort of...

2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:33.200
 The negative way to say it is like having a monopoly on violence

2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:39.120
 but basically being the arbiter of or the people that making sure

2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:42.240
 that violence doesn't get out of hand that would...

2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:43.520
 Yeah, 2020 showed that.

2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:44.160
 Yeah.

2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:45.280
 The government's great at that.

2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:46.000
 Yeah.

2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.040
 Well, what's...

2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:47.920
 Okay.

2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:51.600
 This is the same with the straight face making that argument.

2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:52.320
 Good work, Yaron.

2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:53.760
 All right.

2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:01.440
 Well, can you with a straight face argue for the idea that in anarchism,

2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:03.840
 violence would not get out of hand?

2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:04.880
 Sure.

2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:08.400
 For one thing, if your worst argument against that...

2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:09.920
 One of my little quotes is,

2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:12.800
 what are presented as the strongest arguments against anarchism

2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:15.200
 are inevitably descriptions of the stress quo.

2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.400
 So the argument is under anarchism, you'd have warlords killing people

2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:24.960
 and then you'd have whoever's strongest gets to just take over a neighborhood.

2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:26.000
 Well, we have that now.

2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:31.760
 We saw that the police are perfectly comfortable disarming the population

2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:35.120
 and then when they try to protect themselves or punished,

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:36.960
 they were happy to stand down.

2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:40.960
 You can only have that happen if you have a monopoly.

2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:46.000
 Let's suppose you had a television station and CBS said,

2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.240
 you know what, we're not going to broadcast.

2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:52.400
 Cool, you don't broadcast, we're going to watch any of these other channels.

2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:56.800
 So the problem with having a monopoly is everyone has to be dependent on this issue.

2:11:56.800 --> 2:11:59.200
 What's amazing about minarchism, which objectiveists are,

2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:05.920
 is they will argue that government is really, really bad at everything it does and it touches.

2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:10.080
 Therefore, it has to be in charge of the most important stuff.

2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:15.680
 Well, that's not therefore, but there is a thing that's fundamentally different

2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:16.720
 than all the other things that...

2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:22.720
 But Yaron Brook also said that no government has, this is on your show,

2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:26.000
 has ever worked in the way he's proposing.

2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:31.280
 Now, Objectivism, Einran's philosophy, is based on objective reality.

2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:35.520
 And what she posited is, you look and study the facts of nature,

2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:38.000
 facts of reality, and deduce things accordingly.

2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:42.640
 And she very much regards herself as part of the Aristotelian tradition,

2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:49.040
 as opposed to the Platonist tradition, where the idea precedes reality and the idea is more real

2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:50.560
 than what we see around us.

2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:58.080
 So what he's saying is, all the data, according to him, contradicts his argument,

2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:02.960
 but still he's going to make this imaginary government that has never existed and there's

2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:05.120
 no evidence that it can exist.

2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:10.960
 Let's talk about objective law, to have access to the legal system,

2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:14.720
 which is something we want, even just in terms of selling disputes.

2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:18.800
 When you have a government monopoly, it's going to be more expensive,

2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:20.400
 more difficult for poor people.

2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:23.920
 The cost of hiring a lawyer is more expensive than hiring a surgeon.

2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:27.760
 You can't say with a straight face, this is the only way or the best way.

2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:29.680
 Okay, so...

2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:32.800
 And the other thing is the argument for Objectivism,

2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:35.600
 that they have this stoop against anarchism.

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:39.360
 They have this stupid claim as like, what if, you know,

2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:43.120
 you're a member of one security company, and I'm a member of another,

2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:45.360
 and we have a dispute, and one shows up the door.

2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:48.960
 What happens now, as if this is some insuperable argument?

2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:50.960
 Well, we have that on earth.

2:13:50.960 --> 2:13:54.000
 Every country is in a state of anarchism regarding every other country.

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:55.440
 We don't have a world government.

2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:00.400
 So what happens if a Canadian kills an American in Mexico?

2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:01.360
 I have no idea.

2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:02.800
 I bet you don't have an idea.

2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:08.240
 What I'm sure of is that system has been worked out ahead of time between the three countries,

2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:12.640
 and it's been worked out in such a way that you and I don't have to reinvent the wheel.

2:14:12.640 --> 2:14:14.400
 Same thing with cell phone companies.

2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:18.640
 If I'm on Sprint, you're on Metro PCS, and I call you, who pays?

2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:20.000
 Does Sprint pay you?

2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:21.440
 Do they split the difference?

2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:24.000
 First of all, there's no objective way that one has to work.

2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:28.800
 But the thing is, companies who have auto accidents,

2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:30.080
 they have arbitrage all the time.

2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:35.440
 Like, if I run into you, they work it out, and it never reaches our desk.

2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:41.840
 So the only thing that cops are good at is keeping people at any government monopoly,

2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:44.560
 is forcing people to be their customers by keeping them unsafe.

2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:45.680
 Okay.

2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:50.800
 There's a few things I'd like to say there that just explore some of these ideas.

2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:54.480
 So one, in terms of Canadian and Mexican and so on,

2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:58.640
 it does something that has been worked out, perhaps?

2:14:58.640 --> 2:14:59.280
 Not perhaps.

2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:00.160
 Don't say perhaps.

2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:02.720
 Do you know for sure that if some...

2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:03.760
 There's a point I'm trying to make.

2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:05.840
 So let's say for sure it's been worked out.

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.840
 There was a point in history where it wasn't worked out.

2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:14.800
 To work, to come to a place of stability,

2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:16.800
 there has to first be some instability.

2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.080
 So when you first, for every kind of situation,

2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:26.240
 they're dispute over space, who gets to own Mars, that kind of thing.

2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:31.200
 There's a first for it, and then these different competing institutions

2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:32.880
 will have to figure it out.

2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:36.240
 And so there's the concern with anarchism, I think,

2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:38.160
 or with any kind of interaction.

2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.640
 What you said brilliantly, that there's an anarchism relative to the...

2:15:42.640 --> 2:15:44.080
 There's no one world government.

2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:44.240
 Right.

2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:47.360
 Alex Jones enters the chat, but...

2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:51.920
 There's an insti...

2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:54.880
 Because the fear is that there's going to be an instability

2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:58.560
 that doesn't converge towards some stable place.

2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:02.720
 That is not the fear, that is the goal under Ayn Rand's philosophy.

2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:05.920
 Markets have something that they always talk about

2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:07.840
 as being creatively destructive,

2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:11.440
 which means you look at something that's been happening for a very long time.

2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:16.160
 Every generation, every innovator starts chipping away at it.

2:16:16.160 --> 2:16:18.960
 He finds better ways, marginal improvement, or marginal and...

2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:20.720
 Or it doesn't work, and he goes broke.

2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:23.440
 When government tries to implement improvement,

2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:25.280
 we all have to suffer the consequences.

2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:27.920
 When an innovator does, it's a huge asymmetry.

2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:29.840
 If it hurts, it only hurts him.

2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:34.240
 If it succeeds, he becomes rich, and we all profit as a consequence.

2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:39.600
 But the fear of anarchism, I think, is that it will be noncreative destruction.

2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:40.720
 It'll be just destruction.

2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:42.880
 Right?

2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:45.360
 It's not like the instability...

2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:46.400
 Let's give you...

2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:47.040
 There's no...

2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:49.840
 Stability is one of these words that sounds objective,

2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:51.520
 but has no real meaning.

2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:54.320
 What field has stability?

2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:54.800
 If you had...

2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:56.080
 Let's suppose you want stability...

2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:57.040
 Relationships.

2:16:57.040 --> 2:16:57.440
 Yeah.

2:16:57.440 --> 2:16:58.720
 Let's talk about medicine.

2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:02.480
 Stability means we're not going to invent new diseases or new treatments, right?

2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:06.000
 If you mean stability in terms of a baseline of security,

2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:07.680
 we have that already.

2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:11.200
 Very few relationships turn violent.

2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:13.600
 Under an anarchist system, look at it right now.

2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:20.080
 If you look at a bar full of drunken young males full of testosterone,

2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:25.440
 if you look at a hotel where everyone is not native to the area,

2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:32.240
 those are both far safer than the places that the government has taken upon itself to protect you.

2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:36.240
 The parks, the alleyways, the streets, the subways.

2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:40.960
 We have right now a comparison of which is better at keeping people safe.

2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:46.080
 And it's very obvious that when it's something is private and under someone's control,

2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:47.200
 and there would be layers of...

2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:50.240
 There'd be more police, but they wouldn't be a government monopoly.

2:17:50.240 --> 2:17:52.960
 The store would have someone, the street would have someone,

2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:56.240
 and you'd have your own personal security that would be attached to your phone.

2:17:56.240 --> 2:17:59.600
 Having security as a function of geography,

2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:02.400
 as opposed to a function of you as an individual,

2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:05.440
 is a landline technology in a post cell phone world.

2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:07.600
 So you think it's possible to have...

2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:11.600
 Psychologically speaking, as an individual among the masses,

2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:13.040
 to have a sense of security,

2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:18.000
 even though there's not a centralized thing at the bottom of the whole thing.

2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:23.680
 So there's not a set of laws that are enforced based on geography,

2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:24.720
 like we have nations now.

2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:30.000
 You can have a set of laws that are enforced in some kind of emergent agreed upon way.

2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.960
 So basically, I want to go to a hotel and trust that I'll be able to get a room,

2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:40.560
 and nobody's going to break down the door, and I don't know, they call my vodka.

2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:41.600
 Let's take a different way.

2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:45.200
 If you were worried about a hotel having bedbugs,

2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:47.280
 that's not something that government's involved in.

2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:48.080
 What mechanism...

2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:49.920
 And that's not an unrealistic concern.

2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:54.560
 Are there mechanisms right now that you can undertake to make sure that's not the case?

2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:55.120
 Yes.

2:18:55.120 --> 2:18:56.960
 So it would be the same thing with,

2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:01.280
 I want to make sure I go to a hotel that has security.

2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:02.880
 It would be exactly the same thing.

2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:04.960
 And here's another example, kosher food.

2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:08.240
 People who keep kosher juice, you keep kosher,

2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:10.160
 their food has to be prepared in a certain way.

2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:12.880
 It has to meet higher rabbinical standards, right?

2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:16.240
 If you look at food, it will have that certification.

2:19:16.240 --> 2:19:18.320
 The K, and there's even competition there.

2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:20.480
 There's the K, and there's the stricter U letter.

2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:22.400
 People don't notice it because they're looking for it.

2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:28.240
 You would have companies certifying different locales for their level of security,

2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:34.240
 and it would take an hour to have an app just like when you have toll roads, right?

2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:37.200
 That would tell you you're approaching an unsafe area,

2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:41.760
 you're not going to be covered by us, and you could have it color coded very easily.

2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:42.880
 We could do this today.

2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:46.000
 But the thing is, you're exactly correct,

2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.040
 but there's an assumption of you're already in a,

2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:51.280
 you can give me a different word than stability,

2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:56.960
 but you're already in a place where the forces of the market or whatever can operate.

2:19:57.760 --> 2:20:02.320
 The worry is like, initially, you might not have enough

2:20:03.840 --> 2:20:07.120
 stability to where you can choose one place over the other

2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:10.000
 based on the security that they provide.

2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:14.160
 We already have different types of security here because we have federal government,

2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:16.800
 we have state governments, and we have local governments.

2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:19.600
 And these often contradict each other.

2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:23.600
 So the idea of the implausibility of having different security

2:20:24.240 --> 2:20:27.360
 companies and having it be unstable or impossible,

2:20:27.360 --> 2:20:31.520
 we already have a very rough example of it happening in real life.

2:20:31.520 --> 2:20:32.800
 But all of it started.

2:20:32.800 --> 2:20:42.480
 The idea of, especially with Yaron, is it all started with government monopoly of violence

2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:46.400
 saying like, no kids, don't let violence get out of hand.

2:20:47.600 --> 2:20:51.520
 We had a civil war where half the country was slaughtered.

2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:56.320
 That's the display of the government not having a monopoly on the violence, right?

2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:02.000
 It had such a monopoly on the violence in the North that it could draft people

2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:03.600
 to fight others that they didn't even care about.

2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:04.480
 But there's a South.

2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:08.880
 So it's the government splitting.

2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:09.760
 Okay.

2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:12.720
 It's like, this is giant iceberg like splitting.

2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:19.440
 The argument is that you would have something like a civil war much more often under anarchism.

2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:24.000
 First of all, if you had a civil war much more often,

2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:27.440
 we don't have that with car companies, right?

2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:31.040
 There's no car company that says, I refuse to pay or whatever.

2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:32.880
 That's not violence.

2:21:32.880 --> 2:21:35.200
 Sorry to interrupt, but like, and I'm playing.

2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:36.240
 Hold on, let me finish.

2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:42.640
 It is violence because if I'm a company and I'm saying that my cars can run over yours

2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:47.920
 with no consequences, this is a rough analog, why has that not happened?

2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:53.760
 Now, in terms of having security system, if I am free, just like switching cell phone

2:21:53.760 --> 2:21:58.400
 to go from one provider to another, and this one company as part of its payment doesn't

2:21:58.400 --> 2:22:04.880
 want $50 a month, $100 a month, once my son, I'm not going to be a member of this security company

2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:09.520
 unless in that case we're dealing with something like a Pearl Harbor or foreign invasion,

2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:10.800
 where it's like all hands on deck.

2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:13.040
 Let's go by evidence.

2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:17.600
 How many places do we have evidence of that you can have at a large scale?

2:22:18.720 --> 2:22:19.920
 Well, it's actually in a large scale.

2:22:20.800 --> 2:22:24.080
 Because it feels like once you don't know the person.

2:22:24.080 --> 2:22:25.280
 What about eBay?

2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:27.440
 eBay is an example of anarchism in practice.

2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:31.440
 I am selling something to someone whose name I don't even know in a country that is nowhere

2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:34.320
 approximate to me, and eBay acts as the arbiter.

2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:38.560
 Sometimes I don't get the money after I get screwed over, but that's far less than the taxation

2:22:38.560 --> 2:22:40.000
 that I have to give to the federal government.

2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:43.280
 That's a great point, but it's in the space of finance.

2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:48.160
 If on eBay, you could also commit violence.

2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:49.840
 Theft is violence.

2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:52.000
 No.

2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:55.920
 Yeah, if you give me 10 grand for a car and I don't deliver anything,

2:22:55.920 --> 2:22:57.280
 you've stolen 10 grand for me.

2:22:57.280 --> 2:23:06.000
 Yes, but there's something uniquely problematic to being stabbed or shot.

2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:09.440
 The reason you're stabbed or shot is because the government,

2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:14.800
 despite its contract, is refusing to allow Second Amendment rights to be implemented

2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:19.920
 among the citizenry, and the people who are making that the case are the cops.

2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:24.080
 They are the ones who are the traders of the Constitution and should be regarded as such.

2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:29.440
 Whereas private companies are far more amenable to market pressures than the state is.

2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:36.880
 It's a strong argument, but let's actually just briefly mention the scale thing.

2:23:37.680 --> 2:23:39.440
 Why don't you think we should talk about scale?

2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:45.200
 Because if you had anarchism just in Vermont or just in Brooklyn, fine.

2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:48.400
 The people make the argument you need anarchism, or else China is going to invade.

2:23:48.400 --> 2:23:51.840
 But that's like saying, do these little countries don't exist?

2:23:51.840 --> 2:23:53.200
 Does San Salvador not exist?

2:23:53.200 --> 2:23:54.880
 Some of them are violent, some of them are not.

2:23:54.880 --> 2:23:59.200
 But the point is they're not all at a moment's notice about to be invaded.

2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:00.640
 Kuwait's an example of this.

2:24:00.640 --> 2:24:05.520
 Kuwait was invaded by Iraq and very quickly all the big countries who are interested

2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:11.040
 in having your stability, safe space, got involved and kicked him out of Kuwait.

2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:15.520
 If you had this company that was waging war on the population,

2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:19.680
 it seems quite likely that the other organization would get together and put a stop to this

2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:23.360
 because they're not in a position to provide this service of security to their customers.

2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:25.120
 Okay. All this is brilliant.

2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:32.080
 But didn't you just say that we are actually in a state of anarchism relative to other countries?

2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:32.240
 Yes.

2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:34.800
 So isn't this what emerges?

2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:41.040
 Aren't we actually living in a state of anarchism where we all have agreed?

2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:42.880
 I haven't agreed to anything.

2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:48.080
 So the basic criticism you have is you're born on a land, geographical land,

2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:56.640
 and you're forced to have signed a bunch of stuff just by being born in a particular place.

2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:07.920
 So really, if you could just much easier choose which space of ideas you associated with,

2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:10.640
 that would be actually a state of anarchism.

2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:10.880
 Yes.

2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:16.480
 And you could have a military that you sign up with.

2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:22.640
 Sure. And you're certainly not putting people in prison to get raped because they're selling drugs.

2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:22.880
 Yeah.

2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:29.200
 And you're certainly not allowing everyone else on the street who wants to be there.

2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:32.400
 Can we say something nice about Ayn Rand?

2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:34.560
 I can talk about nice things about her all day.

2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:36.320
 I owe her a copy of the Fountainhead, you know.

2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:43.200
 What to you is Ayn Rand's best idea, one that you find impactful and insightful,

2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:50.080
 useful for us in modern society that you think about, that your life has meaning

2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:56.640
 and productive work is your highest value and that you shouldn't apologize.

2:25:56.640 --> 2:25:58.000
 And this is something I despise.

2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:04.640
 You shouldn't apologize for saying, I want to be happy and I'm going to work toward that.

2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:12.400
 And there's a few others that you owe nobody else some random stranger a second of your time.

2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:16.640
 You see this a lot on Twitter and social media, people like demanding a debate

2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:19.600
 or demanding you act a certain way and engage with them.

2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:20.400
 You don't owe them anything.

2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:26.000
 So I think those are some of her best ideas.

2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:27.120
 And she teaches you how to think.

2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:29.680
 Ayn Rand does not have all the answers, but she has all the questions.

2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:32.160
 Do you think, what do you think about the whole selfishness thing?

2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:37.120
 I mean, are you triggered by the word selfishness?

2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:40.960
 So it's really unfortunate what she does because you were just talking earlier about

2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:42.400
 mold bug being carelessly.

2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:46.720
 This is indefensible in my opinion.

2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:53.600
 So she talks about the virtue of selfishness and she claims that when people talk about

2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:57.280
 selfishness, they mean concern primarily with the self.

2:26:57.280 --> 2:26:57.920
 They don't.

2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:01.280
 When people talk about selfishness, they mean in a sociopathic way,

2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:02.960
 concern exclusively with oneself.

2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:09.120
 They mean like, oh, if someone is dying on the street, I'm not going to even waste the

2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:11.280
 second saving them because I'm selfish.

2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:14.320
 So she sets up this complete caricature of the term.

2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:20.240
 What she, when she's attacking selflessness in her best sense is when there are people

2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:24.160
 who have no sense of self, they have no values of their own.

2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:26.800
 They have no goals of their own.

2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:30.640
 Everything that's in their mind is gotten second hand from the culture at large.

2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:36.320
 And there's nothing unique or special from their perspective worth fighting for.

2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:42.800
 So when she attacks, when she advocates for the self, she basically means self development,

2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:44.800
 self improvement, and achievement.

2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:52.240
 So I think that word choice is really false and needlessly off putting.

2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:56.080
 Yeah, controversial perhaps for the purpose of being controversial.

2:27:56.080 --> 2:27:56.640
 I don't know.

2:27:56.640 --> 2:27:58.480
 But it's just, it's not accurate.

2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:00.880
 That's not what people mean by selfishness.

2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:07.440
 Yeah, I would say it's one of the, one of the reasons probably her philosophy is not as

2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:12.640
 much adopted or thought about is like, it's funny, like the use of words means something.

2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:15.440
 Exactly, as you said, that's my criticism.

2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:18.640
 I mentioned small bug, which could be incorrect criticism, by the way.

2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:19.920
 So I'm not exactly sure.

2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:27.760
 Can we talk about some modern day chaos and politics?

2:28:27.760 --> 2:28:29.440
 Yes, please, I hate chaos.

2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:33.840
 Speaking of your hatred for chaos, let's talk about secession.

2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:36.240
 Oh yeah, I was the first one on this trip.

2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:40.400
 Yeah, you were, well, the Civil War beat you to it, but sure.

2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:41.520
 In contemporary times.

2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:44.480
 In contemporary times, you were, you're on this.

2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:48.800
 Can you talk about what is the idea of secession?

2:28:49.440 --> 2:28:52.560
 What are the odds that it might happen?

2:28:52.560 --> 2:28:58.400
 What does it mean for the United States in some way for different states to secede?

2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:01.520
 Sure, America has been one country with several cultures since the beginning.

2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:07.120
 There's absolutely no reason for someone, this goes back to the anarchist idea,

2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:12.080
 if you despise Donald Trump, which is your prerogative, if you think Joe Biden is a clown,

2:29:12.080 --> 2:29:17.520
 which is your prerogative, there's absolutely no reason for you to be governed by someone you

2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:21.200
 disapprove of. This is an incoherent nonsensical concept.

2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:25.360
 The only reason we even take it as a hypothesis is that we're trained to the contrary since

2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:32.720
 kindergarten. A secession, I don't know along what lines, but increasingly, it's becoming

2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:38.240
 harder and harder for people to have conversations. I think social media, and this is something people

2:29:38.240 --> 2:29:41.600
 despise social media for. I think this is something that social media has done well,

2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:48.560
 which I am advocating for, is it tends to run through ideas through an evolutionary process

2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:52.560
 and drive them to the logical conclusion. It's very hard to be a moderate online because

2:29:52.560 --> 2:29:56.400
 there's going to be people pushing through your ideas through several cycles, and then you're

2:29:56.400 --> 2:30:01.680
 going to end up at some kind of more pure, or if you want to dislike an extreme perspective.

2:30:01.680 --> 2:30:07.520
 Having these different pockets, it's not really governable because people fundamentally have

2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:13.200
 different worldviews. I don't know what secession would look like. I think the number is really

2:30:15.040 --> 2:30:20.320
 increasing at an exponential rate. The number of supporters.

2:30:20.320 --> 2:30:26.160
 I think the claim that this can only be accomplished through violence is false. It's a lie. Just like

2:30:26.160 --> 2:30:33.440
 any divorce doesn't have to involve beating your ex husband or ex wife. I'm very much looking forward

2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:40.640
 to this becoming a reality far quicker than I ever expected. Well, do you think there's a value of

2:30:40.640 --> 2:30:49.280
 competing worldviews being forced to be in the same space?

2:30:49.280 --> 2:30:59.040
 Yes, within a context. If group one thinks A, B, and C are the fundamental aspects of the worldview

2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:04.400
 and argue within that, and group two thinks D, E, and F and argue within that,

2:31:04.400 --> 2:31:08.160
 so you're going to have a lot of argument within those space. But if there's fundamental

2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:13.920
 differences in worldview, there's no reason to be, especially when each view is the other is

2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:20.400
 completely coherent and unreasonable. Do you think there's a line of fundamentally different

2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:28.160
 worldviews that along which a secession will happen in the United States? Is there something that

2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:37.760
 emerges to you as a set of ideas that are like, what do you call that? You can't come to an

2:31:37.760 --> 2:31:43.120
 agreement over. Yeah, I think that's already happening. Like with the masks, I think there's

2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:50.560
 just two fundamental perspective and each one thinks the other is insane and also deadly

2:31:50.560 --> 2:31:57.440
 and destructive. And I don't see how there's any discourse on this topic. So on the left,

2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:02.880
 I wouldn't say it's left versus right. I think it's people who are pro risk versus people who are

2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:16.240
 risk averse. Yeah, so risk averse and then there's a hope for the comfort of the centralized science

2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:23.200
 giving the truth and then everybody must follow the truth of the proper way to behave. And then

2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:31.120
 there's on the other side a distrust of any kind of centralized institutions of anybody who might

2:32:31.120 --> 2:32:39.200
 use control to try to gain greater and greater power and masks are simple of that. Even if

2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:49.440
 masks are or are not an effective way of stopping the virus, which is really unfortunate to me

2:32:49.440 --> 2:32:55.040
 from a perspective. I happen to be on a survey paper about masks. People don't seem to care about

2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:02.720
 the data or the so on. This has become just a nice point on which to then highlight the difference

2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:10.720
 between the two sides. Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, it sounds kind of on the face

2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:15.280
 kind of ridiculous that the secession would occur over masks. But I'm saying this is an example

2:33:15.280 --> 2:33:22.960
 of something where there's a clean break and risk averse versus someone who's risk seeking.

2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:26.800
 These are just two fundamentally different perspectives. Do you want to have an NHS or

2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:31.440
 do you have one of a market based healthcare system? You can make very valid arguments for

2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:36.400
 both. There's no reason for everyone to be under one. But you think that's not something that's

2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:44.480
 you think that's irreconcilable, if that's the word, that that's not in the space of ideas that

2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:48.400
 you can have in the same room together and they fight each other and ultimately make progress.

2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:59.280
 That secession is the more effective way to proceed forward. Do you see a possible world

2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:05.760
 where it knows the answer? Meaning, I know you say yes, because you kind of lean on the side

2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:15.760
 of freedom and anarchism. You want to make an argument in terms of divorce, which is in your

2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:22.560
 worldview or your intuition is you want to make secession as frictionless as possible.

2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:28.720
 Along all lines, not just states or whatever. You want to choose, you want to be free.

2:34:30.400 --> 2:34:39.120
 Let me make my authoritarian Russian argument in terms of relationships.

2:34:39.120 --> 2:34:49.680
 Like, when shit goes wrong in a relationship, there's only a place for one stall at this table.

2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:56.640
 Okay, I'll get to be let in. No, you get to be like Merkel as our previous discussion with Putin.

2:34:57.680 --> 2:35:04.960
 Don't let me unleash the hounds. You want to work through some of the troubles before you get

2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:09.600
 divorced. You want to do the work in relationships sometimes. It goes up and down. It's been 200

2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:19.280
 plus years. It's done. Listen, okay, so it's not a one night stand. Look at Trump. I don't see the

2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:26.160
 middle ground. He's either a complete calamity buffoon or he's been the first great president

2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:32.480
 we've had in many, many years. You think that there's something different now than it was 20

2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:38.800
 years ago? Yes, social media and access to information. And the division will only increase,

2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:44.240
 do you think? Oh, yes. So Trump is not an accident of history. So they thought Trump was the river,

2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:51.840
 but he was the dam. Trump was the dam. They thought he was the river. So in that analogy,

2:35:53.440 --> 2:35:58.880
 Trump being gone makes things worse. Yes, for that perspective, because now things are really

2:35:58.880 --> 2:36:08.160
 going to hit the fan. So what are the odds of succession? I don't know. And my desperate hope

2:36:08.160 --> 2:36:13.600
 is that it's peaceful. But I think the number of people who are becoming very comfortable with

2:36:13.600 --> 2:36:20.320
 violence is making me very unsettled. Well, I see words as violence in your Twitter.

2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:28.560
 It's like Hiroshima times a million. Sometimes I curl up in the corner crying

2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:37.920
 after I check your Twitter feed. But in all seriousness, you think it's possible to do

2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:44.160
 nonviolent secession? It's like a Czechoslovakia. Look at Brexit. Brexit was a secession.

2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:51.920
 Right. So you can have... Civil war did not need to be fought. That would have been a nonviolent

2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:55.360
 secession. And if you worry about slavery, you could have bought off all the slaves,

2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:58.960
 import them to the north. It still would have been cheaper and less loss of life and probably

2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:04.720
 better for race relations. Yeah. I don't know enough history to wonder about how the civil war

2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:11.840
 could have been avoided. Well, that's how. Well, conversation. So like... No, no. If they want

2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:16.320
 us to cede, say, look, here's what we're going to do. We're going to let you secede, but you have

2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:20.320
 to end slavery. They secede it because of slavery. Here's the other thing. There's like this...

2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:23.440
 Some circles of conservatism have this myth that, oh, it wasn't about slavers, it was about

2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:28.240
 states rights. Well, if you go back, every state, when they seceded, released the press release.

2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:32.240
 And they said explicitly, we're doing this because of slavery. So that is an abomination

2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:37.680
 that needs to be taken care of. But the way... Other countries have ended slavery peacefully.

2:37:37.680 --> 2:37:42.720
 One of the ways to do it is pay them by all... And we end up doing this after the war. I think the

2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:48.480
 South people got reparations, the slave owners. It was just insane. Bring them north. You want

2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:54.800
 to go to Canada, whatever. And you agree, and that's our peace treaty. Because the people who died

2:37:54.800 --> 2:38:00.400
 weren't the slave owners. It was white trash. And it was... That's who always... And I hate that

2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:03.760
 that's the term. I can't think of a better one, but that's who always ends up fighting these wars

2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:08.880
 often disproportionately. It's poor people and uneducated people. And I did not regard them

2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:15.040
 as cannon fodder. I think it's horrible. So what would it look like? There would be two founding

2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:20.640
 documents. Yeah, they had their constitution. Which I don't know the history of that. Yeah,

2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:26.640
 they had a constitution, but it was much more decentralized. If secession doesn't happen. Yeah.

2:38:28.720 --> 2:38:36.480
 You said that Donald Trump was the dam, not the river. Yeah. That sounds like Walt Whitman

2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:46.080
 or something. It's poetry. Okay. Are you flirting with me? We don't flirt. We just

2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:51.280
 go to the club and drag you to the cave. We hammer and sickle.

2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:56.480
 And you don't want to know about the sickle. It's not a good cop, bad cop. It's...

2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:06.640
 Bad cop for a cop. Yeah. What do you think 2024 looks like in terms of the candidates?

2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:13.040
 It's going to be Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate. I'm really looking forward to Ted

2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:17.840
 Cruz versus Mike Pence because they're both very good at debate. That would be interesting to see

2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:23.520
 how they differentiate themselves. But honestly, I don't... I mean, things are going to get really

2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:29.360
 ugly really soon. What about Donald Trump coming back? He's not going to do it. So things, in my

2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:34.320
 opinion, I think things are going to be really, really crazy in 2021 and talking about the dam

2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:39.200
 being gone. 2021. So this year coming up. Oh yeah. It's going to be complete. It's going to be

2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:46.160
 complete mayhem. What do you think prediction wise, and this is empirical, what do you think Donald

2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:56.160
 Trump's Twitter feed looks like in 2021? At the end of 2021, we'll look back and see what was the

2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:04.640
 Obama gate exclamation points or we won... He is going to be, for the first time in history,

2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:12.400
 holding the Republican Party accountable to the base. We've never had that happen before. I think

2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:18.480
 he's going to be holding their feet to the fire, radicalizing them. And given that they have the

2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:24.000
 Senate where it's going to be 50, 50, the Democrats have a three seat majority in the house. This

2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:28.480
 is not a governing coalition for either. It's going to be complete mayhem. What does that

2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:32.960
 actually look like? What are the key values you think that he's going to try to push?

2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:37.920
 I think it's just going to be very contrarian. He's going to be holding them accountable in

2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:42.560
 terms of budgeting, even though he never did that as president. I think in terms of some kind of

2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:52.400
 nominations. Here's the thing. This is the first time since Nixon, 50 years, and things weren't

2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:57.920
 as politicized then, where an incoming president doesn't have control of the Senate. The Senate has

2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:05.120
 the vote over cabinet positions. I do not see a possibility of them not trying to pick a fight

2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:10.400
 on one or two of these nominations. And especially as a revenge for Kavanaugh,

2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:13.680
 this is going to get very bloody very quickly. And I think Mitch McConnell,

2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:20.160
 there's a sadistic side to him. He revels in being the brakes on the car. And I think the base,

2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:23.280
 it's just going to be throwing just, they're going to want some bone. It's like, oh yeah,

2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:27.920
 we eliminated this one person. So that's going to get really ugly really quickly.

2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:35.360
 You see it being quite divisive. A division increasing, not stabilizing or decreasing.

2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:39.840
 And I'll be doing my part. I know you'll be doing my part, but I'm trying to do my part.

2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:51.200
 To me, the division is shouting over people like Elon Musk, people who are actually building stuff

2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:55.040
 and accomplishing things in this world in terms of like. Elon said he took the red pill.

2:41:55.040 --> 2:42:01.920
 No. See, you're talking about the play. I'm talking about forget Elon, SpaceX and Tesla,

2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:05.920
 and actually the good sides of like some of the things that Google is doing,

2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:11.840
 like actually building things like making the world's information searchable, all that kind

2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:18.320
 of stuff, like all this stuff, you know, making actually the world a better place. There's a

2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:22.560
 bunch of technologies that are increasing our quality of life, all this, all that kind of stuff.

2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:29.360
 I feel like they get like not much credit in our public discourse because of the division.

2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:35.200
 The division is just like, like people, it's clouding our ability to concentrate on what's

2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:38.720
 awesome about this world. Well, you know what would eliminate the division, right?

2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:45.680
 Secession. Yeah. See, I don't, I don't, like it's hard for me to disagree.

2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:53.200
 It's hard for me to disagree because, but at the same time, secession,

2:42:56.560 --> 2:42:59.440
 I'm a romantic at heart. Divorce breaks my heart.

2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:07.040
 Cool. But do you want to live in a country where Joe Rogan is regarded as an example of

2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:12.320
 someone who's spreading white supremacy? I don't. Well, but see, I feel like that's not

2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:18.480
 the country we live in. That's just the New York Times did it. The cathedral does it on a regular

2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:25.120
 basis. Well, the cathedral is okay. The cathedral, I guess you can maybe define the cathedral, but

2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:29.280
 it's like the centralized institutions that have like a story that they're trying to sell and so

2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:32.960
 on. Yeah, this is Moldau's concept. But yeah, they basically are set the limits of permissible

2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:37.680
 discourse and create a narrative for the population to follow. But to me, that's a minority of people.

2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:42.080
 Yeah. Minority is always controlling everything in any country. The majority of the masses have

2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:46.400
 no thought. Yeah, but minorities can be overthrown. Sure, the circulation of the elites, yeah.

2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:52.560
 The way the, no, no, no. What progress looks like is ridiculous people take power.

2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:58.320
 Yes. And then they get annoying and new ridiculous people that are a little bit better

2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:03.200
 overthrow the previous people. No, I think progress happens despite the people who are in power,

2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:11.280
 not because of them. Right. And so why is secession, so is it always about overthrowing the powerful?

2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:15.280
 Is that how progress happens? No, I think progress happens despite the powerful. The powerful are

2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:19.600
 going to do what's in their power to maintain their power and they're going to fight innovation

2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:23.680
 because it's a threat to their control. There's always going to be the New York Times of the

2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:27.280
 world, right? There's always going to be those. Sure, let them have their own country.

2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:31.920
 So it's two countries. One has Joe Rogan, the other one has the New York Times.

2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:36.320
 That's basically what's happening right now. It just geographically doesn't

2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:41.600
 map out very well, but culturally, yes. But that's just cultural stuff. Like,

2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.320
 there's a layer of public discourse. Okay. I don't mean like that's what we're operating under

2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:52.080
 now, but there's actually like progress being made, like roads being built, hospitals being run,

2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:57.840
 all those kinds of things like that, different innovations. That seems like secession is counter

2:44:57.840 --> 2:45:01.120
 productive to that. Right, because one country would have all the roads and the other would have

2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:06.480
 all the hospitals. That's a great point. No, that's not the point I'm trying to make. It's just like,

2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:10.640
 it just feels like the division that we're experiencing in the space of ideas

2:45:11.680 --> 2:45:17.440
 could be constructive and productive for building better roads and better hospitals as

2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:22.320
 opposed to like using that division to separate the countries. They're all going to have to

2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:28.000
 solve the same problems, it feels like. Sure, but they can solve them differently and compete

2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:32.480
 that way. Mass is a great example. We're seeing that right now. Different countries have different

2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:38.080
 mass mandates and things like this. And the competition within the same structure, within

2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:42.960
 the same founding documents and same institutions is not effective, you think, as effective as

2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:47.120
 separating? It is effective, but there is a certain point which I think we have long passed

2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:52.160
 where there is not a governing consensus ideologically or culturally.

2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:59.600
 Let me ask you a fun question, okay? Knock, knock. Who's there? Mars.

2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:12.880
 God of war. The other one. The planet. Yeah. So there is a kind of captivating notion that

2:46:12.880 --> 2:46:19.840
 we might, I'm excited by it, the human being stepping foot on Mars. That to me is,

2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:31.520
 it's like one of those things that feels like it's, why do we want to engage in space exploration?

2:46:32.640 --> 2:46:39.200
 But I'm a little bit with the Elon Musk on this, which is, it's obvious that eventually

2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:46.480
 if human species is to survive, it's going to have to innovate in ways that includes the space.

2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:53.520
 Okay. Like there's a lot of things we're not able to predict yet that if we push ourselves to the

2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:58.960
 limits of space, like new ideas will come, they'll be obvious a hundred years from now,

2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:04.960
 and then we're not even imagining now. And colonizing Mars, that idea that seems ridiculous,

2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:11.920
 exceptionally difficult, impossibly expensive is something that is actually going to be seen

2:47:11.920 --> 2:47:17.360
 as obvious in retrospect and that we should engage in. Okay. That's just contextualized things.

2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:25.920
 The fun idea and experiment from a philosophical and political sense is what kind of government,

2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:32.800
 how do you orchestrate a government when you go to Mars? Like we don't get too many chances like

2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:40.080
 this, but how do you build new systems, not in place of old ones, but in a place where no system

2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:44.320
 previously existed? I think organically. I hate that word, but that's the correct word.

2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:49.760
 You would have to figure out, I mean, that's how America was built. It was a Jamestown colony,

2:47:49.760 --> 2:47:54.080
 and they tried to communism here, and it completely failed, and they went to a more free market system

2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:58.480
 with the second wave of colonists, this is my understanding. For Mars, I mean, it depends on

2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:06.240
 the population, who the population was, the number of people. I don't know. These are all kind of

2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:12.000
 hypotheticals that I don't really have any good insight in whatsoever. I'm not a space person,

2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:16.640
 I hate astronomy, like I hate it. So a lot of people look up to the stars and they're filled

2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:21.280
 with awe and wonder about the mystery of the universe, and you look up to the stars and you

2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:27.680
 feel what? I'm not looking up. I'm looking at the Earth. If you look at what's, I'd much rather,

2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:34.880
 given a choice between Mars and the deep sea, I'd much rather spend a week at the deep sea and all

2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:39.120
 the life forms that are down there, because they're literal aliens. It's like things that are not

2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:43.920
 literal, but they're unimaginable to us, some of the things down there. Yeah, that's true. To me,

2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:48.240
 it's an interesting thought experiment to see, when you have 10 people, when you have 100 people,

2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:54.080
 how do you build an effective, you know, this is actually really useful for company, right? Like,

2:48:54.080 --> 2:49:00.240
 how do you build an effective company that does things? It's not obvious, despite everybody

2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:04.960
 being really certain about everything in this modern world. To me, it's not obvious, like,

2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:11.680
 how do you run successfully as a group of people? That's what I'm saying. Organic means you have

2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:17.040
 to look at who the people are and tailor the organization to them, as opposed to try to impose

2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:21.120
 something. But you get to also select people. Right, because it's not going to be open borders

2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:27.440
 on Mars. Oh, right. I was going to say, when you have one country, it's all open borders. Yeah,

2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:33.920
 you're right. From a modern space. Right. Some say they're aliens already there, so you're going

2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:39.120
 to have to negotiate that. Sure, we're aliens, though. We're aliens to somebody. We're legal

2:49:39.120 --> 2:49:45.200
 aliens. Do you think there's alien civilizations out there? Yes, of course. What do you think is

2:49:45.200 --> 2:49:51.840
 their system of government? Anarchism, because they're advanced. Do you honestly think there's

2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:55.680
 intelligent life forms out there? Of course, just the math. It's impossible if there isn't.

2:49:55.680 --> 2:50:03.360
 So what do you make of all the stories of UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff? Do you think

2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:09.120
 they've visited Earth? Yes. My grandfather was an air traffic controller in the Soviet Union,

2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:12.560
 and he said they would often see these things that were not

2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:17.840
 operating the way we knew vehicles operate. So that's good enough for me.

2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:23.440
 So I mean, do you think government is in possession of some, like, what do you think

2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:29.280
 government is doing with this kind of information? Do you think somebody has any understanding of

2:50:30.720 --> 2:50:40.400
 UFO sightings or any kind of information about extraterrestrial life forms that are not known

2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:45.520
 to the public? Yes, that's indisputably true. I think the fact that so many of these sightings are

2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:51.040
 from aerodynamic professionals like pilots and things of that nature, they are people who've

2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:56.400
 seen it all, who are reputable, if they are on record saying, I've seen things that don't make

2:50:56.400 --> 2:51:02.880
 sense, and both the Russians and the Americans thought it was the other one that says something.

2:51:02.880 --> 2:51:07.920
 Shouldn't that be a bigger problem? Shouldn't that be bigger news and a bigger problem if government

2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:11.840
 is in fact hiding it? I guess, but like, what are they going to do with that information?

2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:20.560
 It's a good question. Like, if a UFO, if an extraterrestrial spacecraft, which most likely

2:51:20.560 --> 2:51:25.600
 would be like a crappy space, like, it wouldn't be the actual aliens, it would be like some

2:51:26.480 --> 2:51:32.240
 drone probe ship. AI. Yeah, yeah. So if that, like, what would you do with that information

2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:36.960
 as somebody that's in charge of, you know, like, you see how badly

2:51:39.040 --> 2:51:45.840
 WHO fumbled the discussion of masks? Masks? Yeah, masks is one of them, but everything really,

2:51:45.840 --> 2:51:50.960
 in terms of communicating with the public, honestly, about what they know, what they don't know. And

2:51:50.960 --> 2:51:59.840
 that's a trivial one. Right. I don't, I don't, I don't know. There certainly feel incompetent

2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:06.080
 at being able to communicate effectively with the public about something much more difficult,

2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:13.680
 much more full of mystery, like a UFO. I think a piece of material that's out of this earth,

2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:21.440
 forget, like, organic material. I don't, I don't know. To me, from a scientist's perspective,

2:52:21.440 --> 2:52:26.320
 it would be beautiful, it would be inspiring to reveal this to the world. Here's a mystery,

2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:30.400
 and make it completely public, share it with China, share it with everybody.

2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:35.760
 I think there is a domino effect where the concern would be what else you're hiding from us.

2:52:35.760 --> 2:52:39.360
 And at that point, if you said, no, no, no, this is everything, people wouldn't believe you,

2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:46.080
 and they would, you can't blame them for not believing them. Yeah. And then it'll be like,

2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:48.960
 show us the aliens, they'd be like, we don't have them, we just have the craft, you're lying.

2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:59.760
 Speaking of aliens, offline, you mentioned elves. Yeah. And psychedelics. Yeah. What do you think

2:52:59.760 --> 2:53:09.920
 about psychedelics in terms of the kind of places that can take your mind or the kind of journey

2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:16.800
 you can take you on? Like, what do you think, what is, what do you think the psychedelics do

2:53:16.800 --> 2:53:21.840
 to the human mind? And what does that say about the capacity of the human mind and just in general,

2:53:21.840 --> 2:53:25.360
 like the mysteries of all that's out there? I don't know that we understand what they do.

2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:32.800
 The way I heard it explained to me is that much of the human mind isn't about receiving information

2:53:32.800 --> 2:53:38.480
 but blocking information, right? Because there's so much data coming in any moment that you basically

2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:42.480
 have to train yourself to see into here, only what you want to see into here. And that what

2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:46.640
 psychedelics do is they tear that away and suddenly you're much more aware of what's out there. And

2:53:46.640 --> 2:53:49.840
 also, you're going to be noticing patterns that you hadn't noticed before. I know you had that

2:53:49.840 --> 2:53:57.360
 researcher on the show and he kind of discussed this at some length. I mean, Rogan is probably the

2:53:57.360 --> 2:54:00.880
 person who popularized DMT more than anyone. Well, he's obviously the person who's popularized

2:54:00.880 --> 2:54:07.440
 DMT more than anything. I don't know anyone who had, even the researchers who have anything close

2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:13.840
 to a coherent explanation of why this drug, which exists everywhere, would have this very

2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:19.440
 specific, very extreme effect on so many people who are going to be experiencing something

2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:25.440
 such bizarre consequences as a result of it. I think it's very interesting that this is talking

2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:30.480
 with the government. You know, the CIA started experimenting with LSD. They killed one of their

2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:36.560
 own people, dropped the suicide. And there was a lot of research into, Terence McKenna talks about

2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:43.360
 this, into this field. And then very quickly, once they got into the mainstream, they shut it down,

2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:46.960
 even though it's not addictive, it doesn't cause you to go crazy or anything like that.

2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:51.600
 And there was a lot of propaganda against its use, which I think, thankfully, is now somewhat

2:54:51.600 --> 2:54:56.320
 receding. I think Colorado just legalized mushrooms and like that. And I think it would be very

2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:00.480
 interesting to see what happens as a result of this. Yeah. And the interesting thing is,

2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:05.920
 there doesn't seem to be for certain psychedelics like psilocybin, like mushrooms, there doesn't

2:55:05.920 --> 2:55:13.680
 seem to be a lethal dose, which is fascinating. Like Matthew Johnson, the Hopkins professor that

2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:20.800
 he mentioned. I'm definitely going to do one of his studies. It's a really cool way to do

2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:27.280
 what he calls a heroic dose, psilocybin. Oh, I want to do it. What do I have to do? Let's do it.

2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:33.840
 I'll let you know. So he's, he is a heroic dose. Holy crap. Yeah. But it's safe.

2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:41.840
 What's the, I mean, how many grams are we talking? I don't know. But it's just, it's big. He says that

2:55:41.840 --> 2:55:48.640
 this is going to have a kick. Yeah. So he says that, I mean, he also studies cocaine. He studies

2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:55.200
 all kinds of drugs. And he's like, the psilocybin is heroic. Drose of cocaine kills you. Well,

2:55:55.200 --> 2:56:00.560
 he, you can't, you can't, so you can't even come close. So he says like, the problem with studying

2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:07.920
 cocaine is you have like people who are addicted to cocaine or war or so on. You give them the

2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:13.840
 kind of doses that we can and part of the study is like, it's, it's nothing to them. Right. Yeah.

2:56:13.840 --> 2:56:19.680
 psilocybin is the only one where like even like daily users or like regular users,

2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:25.200
 like are blown away by the dose they give them. Oh, so

2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:34.800
 you can go to Russia in your mind. Yeah. You could go to outer space. Maybe, maybe you'll

2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:40.080
 become an astronaut or astronomer after all. Maybe I'll be Baba Yaga.

2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:51.280
 I'll let people look that one up. Holy crap. Wow. What is love? What do you think this thing is,

2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:58.800
 like our attachment to other human beings? And is it something that we should give to

2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:03.920
 just a few people? Yes, that's for sure. When I was working with D.L. Hugley in his book,

2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:10.640
 he didn't use the term, but he was describing like low key depression. And he talked about how he

2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:15.440
 was in the airport and he noticed a girl had a red dress and he went up and thanked her and

2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.680
 she was like, what are you thinking for? And he had realized he hadn't registered color in like weeks.

2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:28.160
 And I think love is like that when you see someone and you just like, oh, like, like your eyes

2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:33.520
 are open. Like this is something I've never seen before. I want more of this, that kind of thing.

2:57:33.520 --> 2:57:39.840
 It's really, it really disorients and reorients your thinking.

2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:46.480
 Don't you find that like the world is full of that, like nonstop? It's not just like a person

2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:51.520
 either. It's like. But yes, but when it's in a person, it's at a whole other level because it's

2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:56.480
 like, I could have, this is going to be great for years. It's like, you know, every day it's

2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:03.040
 something new. I mean, that is, and that is rare. You think it's rare? Find someone who you could

2:58:03.040 --> 2:58:07.840
 talk to them for years and not run out of things to talk. Oh, that's true for years. Yes. That's

2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:15.040
 rare. And know that they really, if you leave the room, they will do right by you. That's really rare.

2:58:16.720 --> 2:58:20.880
 Well, from a Russian perspective, you just don't give them another choice.

2:58:20.880 --> 2:58:36.480
 For, this is Davidish New Year, New Year's Eve. So you talked about secession and the

2:58:36.480 --> 2:58:43.840
 world burning down and you holding the match at the end, standing with a big smile on your face?

2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:53.120
 Yes. Why so serious? But let me ask you, if it doesn't include flame and secession and destruction

2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:57.120
 and laughing malice and makeup in a white suit at the end,

2:58:59.360 --> 2:59:03.200
 how do we bring more kindness and love to the world in 2021?

2:59:03.200 --> 2:59:12.080
 Oh, easy. Be comfortable saying, I want to be happy. And if there's someone who interjects and

2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:19.280
 gives you attitude, arms length them. Surround yourself with people who also want to be happy.

2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:22.640
 Here's a great example. My buddy Chris Williamson, who I've mentioned before,

2:59:22.640 --> 2:59:28.640
 he's a podcaster, does modern wisdom. He's an awesome dude and we became very close friends

2:59:28.640 --> 2:59:33.600
 this past year. And he was in Dubai recently and he sent me pics from Dubai by the pool,

2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:39.520
 just loving life. And it took me a week and then it clicked in my head. And I'm like,

2:59:39.520 --> 2:59:47.440
 you know what? For some other people, if they saw him underwear model at the pool,

2:59:47.440 --> 2:59:51.920
 they would think this is him bragging or humble bragging. And that never entered my head. I'm

2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:58.800
 like, oh man, I'm so glad my boy can be having a good time and is sharing his joy with me.

2:59:59.520 --> 3:00:03.360
 That's the kind of people you need to surround yourself with where it never enters their head

3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:11.680
 to be resentful or anything other than sharing in your bounty. What makes you happy?

3:00:12.720 --> 3:00:18.560
 I'm happy all the time. And one of the points I made in my life is like, I really hated,

3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:22.800
 I really did not like to give advice because I feel don't give advice until you know what

3:00:22.800 --> 3:00:28.960
 you're talking about. And to me, what makes me happy is being self actualized. I am in a position

3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:35.440
 with my career where I could be myself 24 seven, where I never have to engage in small talk,

3:00:36.080 --> 3:00:41.200
 where I never have to interact with someone I don't want to. And I'm very blessed to have that,

3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:49.840
 very few people have that. And to have that be not only to have that be like rewarded and having

3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:56.720
 people find that something of value to them makes me very, very happy. But also being an uncle,

3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:02.320
 you know, I have two little nephews, they make me very, very happy. Sure, my sister's raising in

3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:07.040
 Russian, so they talk like immigrants, but that's okay, we're going to change that. We have to

3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:13.840
 dismember her, that's fine. That makes me happy. And like to be able to be able to finish this

3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:18.400
 book and know it's going to give people a sense of hope, that's really validating.

3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:23.360
 Well, what are you most grateful for, for our conversation today?

3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:34.560
 You're stealing my bet. What am I most grateful for? I am very grateful that I can come in here,

3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:41.280
 not knowing what we're going to talk about. And no, it's not going to be something I have

3:01:41.280 --> 3:01:48.240
 to be on guard about, or I have to watch my words, and that neither you or your audience is going to

3:01:48.240 --> 3:01:55.600
 be responding derisively. I feel safe here. You're welcome.

3:01:55.600 --> 3:02:21.600
 Thanks for talking to me, Michael. This is awesome.

3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:51.600
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
