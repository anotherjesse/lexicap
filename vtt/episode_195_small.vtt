00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Clara Sousa Silva, a quantum astrochemist at Harvard,

00:04.880 --> 00:10.560
 specializing in spectroscopy of gases that serve as possible signs of life on other planets,

00:11.120 --> 00:18.160
 most especially the gas phosphine. She was a coauthor of the paper that in 2020

00:18.160 --> 00:24.480
 found that there is phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus and thus possible extraterrestrial life

00:24.480 --> 00:30.240
 that lives in its atmosphere. The detection of phosphine was challenged, reaffirmed, and is now

00:30.240 --> 00:37.840
 still under active research. Quick mention of our sponsors, Onit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.

00:37.840 --> 00:43.040
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I think

00:43.040 --> 00:48.080
 the search for life on other planets is one of the most important endeavors in science. If we

00:48.080 --> 00:54.000
 find extraterrestrial life and study it, we may find insights into the mechanisms that originated

00:54.000 --> 00:59.360
 life here on Earth, and more than life, the mechanisms that originated intelligence and

00:59.360 --> 01:05.760
 consciousness. If we understand these mechanisms, we can build them. But more than this, the discovery

01:05.760 --> 01:12.000
 of life on other planets means that our galaxy and our universe is teeming with life. This is

01:12.000 --> 01:18.320
 humbling and terrifying, but it is also exciting. We humans are natural explorers. For most of our

01:18.320 --> 01:24.000
 history, we explored the surface of the Earth and the contents of our minds. But now, with space

01:24.000 --> 01:29.920
 faring vessels, we have a chance to explore life beyond Earth, their physics, their biology, and

01:29.920 --> 01:36.960
 perhaps the contents of their minds. This is the Lux Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation

01:36.960 --> 01:44.560
 with Clara Sousa Silva. Since you're the world expert in, well, in many things, but one of them

01:44.560 --> 01:53.600
 is Phosphine, would it technically be correct to call you the Queen of Phosphine? I go for Dr.

01:53.600 --> 02:01.360
 Phosphine. Queen is an inherited title, I feel. Yeah. But you still rule by love and power, so,

02:01.920 --> 02:09.200
 but while having the doctor title. Yeah, kindness. Kindness, kindness. In September 2020,

02:09.200 --> 02:14.640
 you coauthored a paper announcing possible presence of Phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus,

02:15.280 --> 02:20.160
 and that it may be a signature of extraterrestrial life.

02:20.880 --> 02:27.600
 Big maybe. Big maybe. There was some pushback, of course, from the scientific community that

02:27.600 --> 02:35.120
 followed, friendly, loving pushback. Then in January, another paper from University of Wisconsin,

02:35.120 --> 02:42.320
 I believe, confirmed the finding. Where do we stand in this saga, in this mystery of what the

02:42.320 --> 02:49.440
 heck is going on on Venus in terms of Phosphine and in terms of aliens? Let's try to break it down.

02:50.480 --> 02:57.840
 The short answer is we don't know. I think you and the rest of the public are now witnessing

02:57.840 --> 03:05.120
 pretty exciting discovery, but as it evolves, as it unfolds, we did not wait until we had

03:06.960 --> 03:14.640
 years of data from 10 different instruments across several layers of the atmosphere. We waited until

03:14.640 --> 03:22.880
 we had two telescopes with independent data months apart. But still, the data is weak,

03:22.880 --> 03:28.640
 it's noisy, it's delicate, it's very much at the edge of instrument sensibility, sensitivity.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.360
 We still don't even know if it is Phosphine. We don't even really know if the signal is real.

03:35.360 --> 03:42.080
 People still disagree about that. I think at the most morphological end of how this happened,

03:42.080 --> 03:46.800
 I think it is a distinction, and myself and other coauthors were talking about this. It's a

03:46.800 --> 03:54.320
 distinction between hypotheses generation and hypotheses testing. Now, hypothesis testing

03:54.320 --> 04:02.800
 is something that I think is the backbone of the scientific method, but it has a problem, which is

04:02.800 --> 04:06.240
 if you're looking through very noisy data and you want to test the hypotheses,

04:06.240 --> 04:13.680
 you may, by mistake, create a superior signal. The safest, more conservative approach is hypothesis

04:13.680 --> 04:19.680
 generation. You see some data and you go, what's in there? With no bias. Now, this is much safer,

04:19.680 --> 04:24.960
 much more conservative, and when there's a lot of data, that's great. When there isn't, you can

04:24.960 --> 04:30.960
 clean the noise and take out the signal with it, the signal with a bathwater, whatever the equivalent

04:30.960 --> 04:37.200
 of the analogy would be. And so I think the healthy discourse that you described is exactly this.

04:37.200 --> 04:42.080
 There are ways of processing the data completely legitimate ways, checked by multiple people and

04:42.080 --> 04:46.720
 experts where the signal shows up, and then phosphine is in the atmosphere of Venus,

04:47.520 --> 04:54.640
 and somewhere it doesn't. And then we disagree what that signal means. If it's real, and it is

04:54.640 --> 05:00.720
 an ambiguously phosphine, it is very exciting because we don't know how to explain it without life,

05:00.720 --> 05:05.120
 but going from there to venusians is still a huge jump.

05:05.120 --> 05:13.520
 So that would be the title for the civilization if it is a living and thriving on Venus's venusians.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.760
 Until we know what they call themselves. That's the name, yes.

05:18.320 --> 05:25.680
 So this is the early analysis of early data. It was nevertheless,

05:26.400 --> 05:29.360
 you waited until the actual peer reviewed publication?

05:29.360 --> 05:34.080
 Of course. And analysis of the two different instruments months apart. So that's Alma and

05:34.080 --> 05:40.240
 JCMT, the two telescopes. I mean, it's still, I mean, it's really exciting. What did it feel like

05:40.240 --> 05:46.000
 sort of sitting on this data, like kind of anticipating the publication and wondering,

05:46.880 --> 05:54.480
 and still wondering, is it true? How does it make you feel that a planet in our solar system

05:54.480 --> 05:58.800
 might have phosphine in the atmosphere? It's nuts. It's absolutely nuts.

05:58.800 --> 06:07.520
 In the best possible way. I've been working on phosphine for over a decade.

06:08.720 --> 06:16.320
 Before it was cool. Before it was cool. Before anyone could spell it or heard of it. And at the

06:16.320 --> 06:22.560
 time, people either didn't know what phosphine was or only knew it for being just possibly the most

06:22.560 --> 06:31.840
 horrendous molecule that ever graced the earth. And so no one was a fan. And I'd been considering

06:31.840 --> 06:36.960
 looking for it because I did think it was an unusual and disgusting, but very promising sign

06:36.960 --> 06:42.240
 of life. I've been looking for it everywhere. I really didn't think to look in the solar system.

06:42.240 --> 06:50.800
 I thought it was all pretty rough around here for life. And so I wasn't even considering

06:50.800 --> 06:55.920
 the solar system at all and never my next door of Venus. It was only the lead author of the study,

06:55.920 --> 07:01.440
 Jane Greaves, who thought to look in the clouds of Venus and then reached out to me to say,

07:02.640 --> 07:08.800
 I don't know phosphine, but I know it's weird. How weird is it? And the answer is very weird.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.840
 And so the telescopes we're looking at, this is visual data.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.680
 That's what you mean by visual. You wouldn't see the phosphine.

07:15.680 --> 07:21.520
 Well, but I mean, it's a telescope. It's remote. It's remote. You're observing,

07:22.960 --> 07:28.720
 you're zooming in on this particular planet. I mean, what does the sensor actually look like?

07:28.720 --> 07:33.600
 How many pixels are there? What does the data kind of look like? It'd be nice to kind of

07:34.400 --> 07:41.120
 build up intuition of how little data we have based on which. I mean, if you look at like,

07:41.120 --> 07:47.520
 I've just been reading a lot about gravitational waves and it's kind of incredible how from just

07:47.520 --> 07:54.080
 very little, like probably the world's most precise instrument, we can derive some very

07:54.080 --> 07:59.360
 foundational ideas about our early universe. And in that same way, it's kind of incredible

07:59.360 --> 08:04.000
 how much data, how much information you can get from just a few pixels. So what are we talking

08:04.000 --> 08:12.800
 about here in terms of based on which this paper saw possible signs of phosphine in the atmosphere?

08:13.440 --> 08:18.000
 So phosphine like every other molecule has a unique spectroscopic fingerprint,

08:18.000 --> 08:24.560
 meaning it rotates and vibrates in special ways. I calculated how many of those ways it can

08:24.560 --> 08:31.120
 rotate and vibrate to the 16.8 billion ways. What this means is that if you look at the spectrum of

08:31.120 --> 08:39.040
 light and that light has gone through phosphine gas on the other end, there should be 16.8 billion

08:39.040 --> 08:46.400
 tiny marks left, indentations left in that spectrum. We found one of those on Venus,

08:46.400 --> 08:52.400
 one of those 16.8 billion. So now the game is, can we find any of the other ones?

08:53.520 --> 08:58.480
 But they're really hard to spot. They're all in terrible places in the electromagnetic spectrum

08:58.480 --> 09:05.120
 and the instruments we use to find this one can't really find any other one. There's another one of

09:05.120 --> 09:10.320
 the 16.8 billion we could find, but it would take many, many days of continuous observations.

09:10.320 --> 09:15.360
 And that's not really in the cards right now. I mean, how do you, there's all kinds of noise,

09:15.360 --> 09:25.040
 first of all. There's all kinds of other signal. So how do you separate all of that out to pull

09:25.040 --> 09:29.920
 out just this particular signature that's associated with phosphine?

09:30.880 --> 09:37.600
 So the data kind of looks somewhat like a wave and a lot of that is noise and it's a baseline.

09:37.600 --> 09:42.240
 And so if you can figure out the exact shape of the wave, you can cancel that shape out and you

09:42.240 --> 09:47.680
 should be left with a straight line and if there's something there, an absorption, so a signal.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.000
 So that's what we did. We tried to find out what was this baseline shape,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.480
 cleaned it out and got the signal. That's part of the problem. If you do this wrong,

09:56.480 --> 10:05.920
 you can create a signal. But that signal is at 8.904 wave numbers and we actually have more digits

10:05.920 --> 10:12.400
 than that, but I don't remember by heart. And ALMA in particular is a very, very good telescope,

10:12.400 --> 10:18.080
 array of telescopes and it can focus on exactly that frequency. And in that frequency, there are

10:18.080 --> 10:24.800
 only two known molecules that absorb at all. So that's how we do it. We look at that exact spot

10:24.800 --> 10:28.400
 where we know phosphine absorbs. The other molecule is SO2.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.120
 If there is extraterrestrial life, whether it's on Venus or on exoplanets where you looked before,

10:38.880 --> 10:44.400
 how does that make you feel? How should it make us feel? Should we be scared? Should we be excited?

10:44.400 --> 10:53.120
 Let's say it's not intelligent life. Let's say it's microbial life. Is there a threat to us?

10:53.120 --> 10:59.280
 Are we a threat to it? Or is it only, not only, but mostly a possibility to understand something

10:59.840 --> 11:03.280
 fundamental, something beautiful about life in the universe?

11:04.080 --> 11:08.480
 Hard to know. You would have to bring on a poet or a philosopher on the show.

11:08.480 --> 11:14.800
 So I feel those things. I just don't know if those are the right things to feel.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.440
 I certainly don't feel scared. I think it's rather silly to feel scared. Definitely don't

11:19.440 --> 11:27.840
 touch them sometimes in the movies. Don't go near it. Don't interfere. I think one of the things

11:27.840 --> 11:35.920
 with Venus is because of phosphine, now there is a chance that Venus is inhabited. In that case,

11:35.920 --> 11:45.040
 we shouldn't go there. We should be very careful with messing with them, bringing our own stuff

11:45.040 --> 11:51.840
 there that contaminates it. Venus has suffered enough. If there's life there, it's probably the

11:51.840 --> 12:00.560
 remains of a living planet, the very last survivors of what once was potentially a thriving world.

12:00.560 --> 12:07.360
 And so I don't want our first interaction with alien life to be massacre. So I definitely wouldn't

12:07.360 --> 12:14.720
 want to go near out of a, let's say, galactic responsibility, galactic ethics. And I often

12:14.720 --> 12:20.080
 think of alien astronomers watching us and how disappointed they would be if we messed this

12:20.080 --> 12:26.560
 up. So I really want to be very careful with anything that could be life. But certainly,

12:26.560 --> 12:32.400
 I wouldn't be scared. Humans are plenty capable of killing one another. We don't need extraterrestrial

12:32.400 --> 12:38.560
 help to destroy ourselves. Scared mostly of other humans. Exactly. But this life, if there

12:38.560 --> 12:44.240
 is life there, it does seem just like you said, it would be pretty rugged. It's like the cockroaches

12:45.680 --> 12:52.880
 or Chuck Norris, I don't know. It's something that survived through some very difficult conditions.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.880
 That doesn't mean it would handle us. It could be like war of the worlds.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.720
 You come just because you're resilient in your own planet doesn't mean you can survive another.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.760
 Even our extremophiles, which are very impressive, we should all be very proud of our extremophiles,

13:08.320 --> 13:14.800
 they wouldn't really make it in the Venusian clouds. So I wouldn't expect, because you're tough,

13:14.800 --> 13:19.200
 even Chuck Norris tough, that you would survive on a alien planet.

13:19.200 --> 13:26.160
 And then from the scientific perspective, you don't want to pollute the data gathering process,

13:26.160 --> 13:30.960
 but it should be showing up there. The observer can affect the observed.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.880
 How heartbreaking would it be if we found life on another planet and then we're like,

13:34.880 --> 13:38.080
 oh, we brought it with us. So this is my sandwich.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.000
 But that's always the problem, right? And it's certainly a problem with Mars,

13:42.000 --> 13:49.680
 because we visited that if there is life on Mars or like remains of life on Mars,

13:49.680 --> 13:53.440
 it's always going to be a question of like, well, maybe we planted it there.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.960
 Let's not do the same with Venus. It's harder because when we try to go to Venus,

13:56.960 --> 14:03.120
 and things melt very quickly. And so it's a little harder to pollute Venus.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.280
 It's very good at destroying foreigners.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.960
 Yeah. Well, in terms of Elon Musk and terraforming planets, Mars is stop number one,

14:12.960 --> 14:18.720
 and Venus maybe after that. So can we talk about Phosphine a little bit?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.200
 Love Phosphine.

14:21.200 --> 14:21.840
 Love Phosphine.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.720
 What's your Twitter handle that's like Dr. Phosphine?

14:24.720 --> 14:28.880
 It's Dr. Phosphine, yes. You'll be surprised here. It wasn't taken already. I could just,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.520
 I just grabbed it. Didn't have to buy it off anyone.

14:31.520 --> 14:38.160
 Yeah. So what is it? What's Phosphine? You already mentioned it's pretty toxic and

14:39.600 --> 14:44.480
 troublesome. And outside, troublesome, sorry.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.400
 No, I love it. I'm going to start calling it troublesome.

14:48.640 --> 14:56.800
 So maybe what are some things that make it interesting chemically, and why is it a good sign

14:56.800 --> 15:04.000
 of life when it's present in the atmosphere? Like you've described in your paper aptly titled

15:04.000 --> 15:09.840
 the Phosphine as a biosignature gas in exoplanet atmospheres. I suppose you wrote that paper

15:09.840 --> 15:10.880
 before Venus.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.400
 I did. Yes, I did. And no one cared. In that paper, I said something like,

15:16.400 --> 15:20.480
 if we find Phosphine on any terrestrial planet, it can only mean life. And I was like,

15:20.480 --> 15:23.600
 yeah, that sounds about right. Let's go. And then Venus shows up and I was like,

15:23.600 --> 15:31.440
 are you sure? I was sure before I was sure. Now that it's right here, I'm less sure

15:32.480 --> 15:38.960
 now that my claims are being tested. So Phosphine. Phosphine is a fascinating molecule. So it's

15:38.960 --> 15:44.400
 shaped like a pyramid with a phosphorus up top and then three hydrogens. It's actually quite a

15:44.400 --> 15:51.760
 simple molecule in many ways. It's the most popular elements in the universe, carbon, hydrogen,

15:51.760 --> 15:57.440
 nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur. When you add hydrogen to them, it makes quite simple,

15:57.440 --> 16:03.840
 quite famous molecules. You do it to oxygen, you get water. You do it to carbon, you get methane.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.080
 You do it to nitrogen, you get ammonia. These are all molecules people have heard of.

16:08.080 --> 16:13.040
 But you do it to phosphorus, you get Phosphine. People haven't heard of Phosphine because

16:13.760 --> 16:19.600
 it's not really popular on Earth. We really shouldn't find it anywhere on Earth because

16:19.600 --> 16:26.560
 it is extremely toxic to life. It interacts with oxygen metabolism and everything you know

16:26.560 --> 16:35.280
 and love uses oxygen metabolism. And it interacts fatally, so it kills in several very imaginative

16:35.280 --> 16:42.480
 and very macabre ways. So it was used as a chemical warfare agent in the First World War and most

16:42.480 --> 16:49.920
 recently by ISIS. So really bad. Most life avoids it. Even life that might not avoid it, so life that

16:49.920 --> 16:55.520
 doesn't use oxygen metabolism, anaerobic life, still has to put crazy amounts of effort into

16:55.520 --> 16:59.920
 making it. It's a really difficult molecule to make thermodynamically speaking. It's really

16:59.920 --> 17:05.840
 difficult to make that phosphorus want to be together with that hydrogen. So it's horrible.

17:06.640 --> 17:10.560
 Everyone avoids it. When they're not avoiding it, it's extremely difficult to make. You would

17:10.560 --> 17:15.680
 have to put energy in, sacrifice energy to make it. And if you did go through all that trouble

17:15.680 --> 17:22.480
 and made it, it gets reacted with the radicals in the atmosphere and gets destroyed. So we

17:22.480 --> 17:26.960
 shouldn't find it anywhere and yet we do. It's this kind of weird molecule that seems to

17:28.560 --> 17:34.080
 be made by life and we don't even know why. Life clearly finds a use for it. It's not the only

17:34.080 --> 17:38.880
 molecule that life is willing to sacrifice energy to make, but we don't know how or why life is

17:38.880 --> 17:46.480
 even making it. So absolutely mysterious, absolutely deadly, smells horrifically when it's

17:46.480 --> 17:51.920
 made. It produces other kind of diphosphines and it's been reported as smelling like garlicky

17:51.920 --> 17:57.200
 fishy death. Once someone referred to it as smelling like the, let me see if I remember,

17:57.200 --> 18:03.440
 the rancid diapers of the spawn of Satan. Oh, very nice. Yeah, very, very vivid.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.880
 And so you're a poet after all. I didn't call that someone else did. And so it's just this

18:08.880 --> 18:15.600
 horrific molecule, but it is produced by life. We don't know why. And when it is produced by life

18:15.600 --> 18:22.800
 is done with enormous sacrifice and the universe does not sacrifice. Life sacrifices. And so it's

18:22.800 --> 18:28.720
 this strange contradictory molecule that we should all be avoiding and yet seems to be an almost

18:28.720 --> 18:35.760
 unambiguous sign of life on rocky planets. Okay. Can we dig into that a little bit? So on rocky

18:35.760 --> 18:44.640
 planets, what, is there biological mechanisms that can produce it? And is there, you said that

18:44.640 --> 18:51.680
 why is unclear? Why life might produce it? But is there an understanding of what kind of mechanisms

18:51.680 --> 18:58.000
 might be able to produce it? This very difficult to produce molecule? We don't know yet. The enzymatic

18:58.000 --> 19:03.440
 pathways of phosphine production by life are not yet known. This is not actually as surprising

19:03.440 --> 19:09.120
 as it might sound. I think something like 80% of all the natural products that we know of,

19:09.120 --> 19:14.480
 so we know biology makes them. We don't know how. It is much easier to know life produces

19:14.480 --> 19:19.360
 something because you can put bacteria in a Petri dish and then watch and then that gas is produced

19:19.360 --> 19:24.560
 to go, oh, life made it. That actually happened with phosphine. But that's much easier to do,

19:24.560 --> 19:30.720
 of course, than figuring out what is the exact metabolic pathway within that life form that

19:30.720 --> 19:38.320
 created this molecule. So we don't know yet. Phosphine is really understudied. No one had

19:38.320 --> 19:43.440
 really heard of it until nowish. What you were presenting is the fact that life produces

19:44.080 --> 19:50.560
 phosphine, not the process by which it produces phosphine. Is there an urgency now? If you were

19:50.560 --> 19:58.880
 to try to understand the mechanisms, the enzymatic pathways that produce phosphine, how difficult

19:58.880 --> 20:04.960
 is that of a problem to crack? It's really difficult. If I'm not mistaken, even the scent of truffles,

20:05.600 --> 20:11.760
 obviously a billion dollar industry, huge deal. Until quite recently, it wasn't known exactly

20:11.760 --> 20:16.720
 how those scents, those molecules that create this incredible smell were produced. This is

20:16.720 --> 20:21.840
 a billion dollar industry. As you can imagine, there is no such pressure. There's no phosphine

20:21.840 --> 20:28.000
 lobby or anything that would push for this research. But I hope someone picks it up and

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
 does it. And it isn't crazy because we know that phosphine is really hard to make. We know it's

20:34.000 --> 20:39.680
 really hard for it to happen accidentally, even lightning and volcanoes that can produce small

20:39.680 --> 20:44.480
 amounts of phosphine. It's extremely difficult for even these extreme processes to make it.

20:44.480 --> 20:50.000
 So it's not really surprising that only life can do it because life is willing to make things

20:50.000 --> 20:58.720
 at a cost. So maybe on the topic of phosphine, again, you've gotten yourself into trouble that

20:58.720 --> 21:03.200
 I'm going to ask all these high level poetic questions. I apologize. No, I would love it.

21:03.200 --> 21:11.760
 Okay. When did you first fall in love with phosphine? It wasn't love at first sight. It was

21:11.760 --> 21:21.600
 somewhere between a long relationship and Stockholm syndrome. When I first started by PhD,

21:22.160 --> 21:27.200
 I knew I wanted to learn about molecular spectra and how to simulate it. I thought it was really

21:27.200 --> 21:33.360
 outrageous that we as a species couldn't detect molecules remotely. We didn't have this perfect

21:33.360 --> 21:38.160
 catalog ready of the molecular fingerprint of every molecule we may want to find in the universe.

21:38.160 --> 21:43.520
 And something as basic as phosphine, the fact that we didn't really know how it interacted with light

21:43.520 --> 21:50.320
 and so we couldn't detect it properly in the galaxy, just I was so indignant. And so initially,

21:50.320 --> 21:56.640
 I just started working on phosphine because people hadn't before and I thought we should

21:56.640 --> 22:02.320
 know what phosphine looks like. And that was it. And then I read every paper that's ever been

22:02.320 --> 22:08.640
 published about phosphine. It was quite easy because there aren't that many. And that's when I

22:08.640 --> 22:13.200
 started learning about where we had already found it in the universe and what it meant.

22:14.800 --> 22:21.040
 I started finding out quite how little we know about it and why. And it was only when I joined

22:21.040 --> 22:29.600
 MIT and I started talking to biochemists that it became clear that phosphine wasn't just weird

22:29.600 --> 22:36.000
 and special and understudied and disgusting. It was all these things for oxygen loving life.

22:36.560 --> 22:42.720
 And it was the anaerobic world that would welcome phosphine. And that's when the idea of

22:42.720 --> 22:49.360
 looking for it on other planets became crystallized because oxygen is very powerful and very important

22:49.360 --> 22:54.800
 on Earth. But that's not necessarily going to be the case on other exoplanets. Most planets are

22:54.800 --> 23:01.600
 oxygen pole. Overwhelmingly, most planets are oxygen pole. And so finding the sign of life

23:01.600 --> 23:09.600
 that would be welcomed by everything that would live without oxygen on Earth seemed so cool.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.160
 And but ultimately, the project at first was born out of the idea that you want to find that

23:16.160 --> 23:27.040
 molecular fingerprint of any of a molecule. And this is just one example. And that's connected

23:28.000 --> 23:34.400
 to then looking for that fingerprint elsewhere in a remote way. And obviously that then

23:34.960 --> 23:38.880
 at that time where exoplanets already, when you were doing your PhD, and by the way,

23:38.880 --> 23:44.560
 should say your PhD thesis was on phosphine. It was all on phosphine, 100% on phosphine.

23:44.560 --> 23:49.680
 With a little bit of ammonia, I have a chapter that I did where I talked about

23:49.680 --> 23:55.280
 phosphine and ammonia. But no, phosphine was very much my thesis.

23:55.280 --> 24:01.040
 But at that time, when you're writing it, there's already a sense that exoplanets are out there.

24:01.040 --> 24:08.160
 And we might be able to be looking for biosignatures on those exoplanets.

24:08.160 --> 24:13.760
 Pretty much. So I finished my PhD in 2015. We found the first exoplanets in the kind

24:13.760 --> 24:19.200
 of mid to late 90s. So exoplanets were known. It was known that some had atmospheres.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.440
 And from there, it's not a big jump to think, well, if some have atmospheres,

24:23.440 --> 24:27.600
 some of those might be habitable. And some of those may be inhabited.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
 So how do you detect, you started to talk about it, but can we linger on it? How do you detect

24:36.000 --> 24:44.960
 phosphine on a faraway thing, rocky thing, rocky planet? What is spectroscopy?

24:45.600 --> 24:50.720
 What is this molecular fingerprint? What does it look like? You've kind of mentioned a wave,

24:50.720 --> 24:55.600
 but what are we supposed to think about? What are the tools? What are the uncertainties?

24:55.600 --> 25:00.480
 All those kinds of things. So the path can go this way. You've got light,

25:00.480 --> 25:07.840
 kind of pure light. You can crack that light open with a prism or a spectroscope or water

25:08.480 --> 25:14.720
 and make a rainbow. That rainbow is all the colors and all the invisible colors,

25:14.720 --> 25:20.560
 the ultraviolet, the infrared. And if that light was truly pure, you could consider that rainbow

25:20.560 --> 25:27.120
 to just cover continuously all of these colors. But if that light goes through a gas, we may not

25:27.120 --> 25:33.280
 see that gas. We certainly cannot see the molecules within that gas. But those molecules will steal,

25:33.280 --> 25:41.120
 absorb some of that light, some, but not all. Each molecule absorbs only very specific colors of

25:41.120 --> 25:47.600
 that rainbow. And so if you know, for example, that shade of green can only be absorbed by methane,

25:48.160 --> 25:52.880
 then you can watch. As a planet passes in front of a star, the planet's too far away,

25:52.880 --> 25:57.360
 you can't see it. And it has an atmosphere. That atmosphere is far too small, you definitely

25:57.360 --> 26:02.880
 can't see it. But the sunlight will go through that atmosphere. And if that atmosphere is methane,

26:02.880 --> 26:07.120
 then on the other side, that shade of blue, I can't remember if I said blue or green,

26:07.120 --> 26:14.320
 for that color will be missing because methane took it. And so with phosphine, it's the same thing.

26:14.320 --> 26:21.200
 It has specific colors, 16.8 billion colors, that it absorbs it and nothing else does.

26:21.200 --> 26:27.360
 And so if you can find them and notice them missing from the light of a star that went

26:27.360 --> 26:32.880
 through a planet's atmosphere, then you'll know that atmosphere contains their molecule. How cool

26:32.880 --> 26:38.720
 is that? That's incredible. So you can have this fingerprint within the space of colors,

26:38.720 --> 26:43.280
 and there's a lot of molecules. And I mean, I wonder, that's a question of how much overlap

26:43.280 --> 26:49.840
 there is. How close can you get to the actual fingerprint? Can phosphine unlock the iPhone

26:49.840 --> 26:58.960
 with its lights on? It says 16.8 billion. So presumably this rainbow is discretized into

26:58.960 --> 27:05.840
 little segments somehow. How many total are there? How a lot is 16.8 billion?

27:06.400 --> 27:12.640
 It's a lot. We don't have the instruments to break these, break any light into this many

27:12.640 --> 27:18.000
 tiny segments. And so with the instruments we do have, there's huge amounts of overlap.

27:18.000 --> 27:26.640
 Methane is an example. A lot of the ways it's detectable is because the carbon and the hydrogens,

27:26.640 --> 27:32.560
 they vibrate with one another, they move, they interact. But every other hydrocarbon,

27:32.560 --> 27:39.760
 acetylene, isoprene, has carbon and hydrogens, also vibrating and rotating. And so it's actually

27:39.760 --> 27:46.080
 very hard to tell them apart at low resolutions. And our instruments can't really cope with

27:46.080 --> 27:52.640
 distinguishing between molecules particularly well. But in an ideal world, if we had infinite

27:52.640 --> 27:57.120
 resolution, then yes, every molecule's spectral features will be unique.

27:58.640 --> 28:02.000
 Yeah, almost too unique. It would be too trivial.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.960
 At the quantum level, they're unique. At our level, there's huge overlap.

28:06.960 --> 28:15.920
 Yeah. But then you can start to then try to disambiguate the fact that certain

28:15.920 --> 28:20.000
 colors are missing. What does that mean? And hopefully, they're missing in a certain kind

28:20.000 --> 28:24.400
 of pattern where you can say, was some kind of probability that it's this gas, not this gas.

28:24.400 --> 28:29.200
 So you're solving that gaseous puzzle. I got it. Okay.

28:29.200 --> 28:34.320
 We can go back to Venus actually and show that. So with this, I mentioned those two molecules

28:34.320 --> 28:39.040
 that could be responsible for that signal, the resolution that we have. It was phosphine and

28:39.040 --> 28:46.800
 SO2, sulfur dioxide. And that resolution could really be one of the other. But in that same

28:46.800 --> 28:51.600
 bandwidth, so in kind of the same observations, there was another region where phosphine does

28:51.600 --> 28:57.680
 not absorb. We know that. But SO2 does. So we just went unchecked and there was no signal.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.960
 So we thought, oh, then it must be phosphine. And then we submitted the paper.

29:02.960 --> 29:12.160
 The rest is history. I got it. Well, yeah, that's beautifully told.

29:12.960 --> 29:21.040
 Is there, so the telescopes we're talking about are sitting on Earth. What can it help solving

29:21.040 --> 29:27.360
 this fingerprint molecular fingerprint problem if we do a flyby? Does it help if you get closer

29:27.360 --> 29:33.760
 and closer? Or are telescopes pretty damn good for this kind of puzzle solving?

29:33.760 --> 29:38.800
 Telescopes are pretty good, but the Earth's atmosphere is a pain. I mean, I'm very thankful

29:38.800 --> 29:44.640
 for it. But it does interrupt a lot of measurements and a lot of regions where

29:44.640 --> 29:51.280
 phosphine would be active. They are not available. The Earth is not transparent in those wavelengths.

29:52.080 --> 29:57.040
 So being above the atmosphere would make a huge difference. Then proximity matters a lot less.

29:57.040 --> 30:02.080
 But just escaping the Earth's atmosphere would be wonderful. But then it's really hard to stay

30:02.080 --> 30:08.880
 very stable. And if there is phosphine on Venus, there's very little of it in the clouds. And so

30:09.760 --> 30:15.760
 the signal is very weak. And the telescopes we can use on Earth are much bigger and much more

30:15.760 --> 30:23.200
 stable. So it's a bit of a trade off. So is it, are you comfortable with this kind of remote

30:23.200 --> 30:31.840
 observation? Is it at all helpful to strive for going over to Venus and like grabbing a scoop

30:32.480 --> 30:39.040
 of the atmosphere? Or is remote observation really a powerful tool for this kind of job?

30:39.040 --> 30:43.760
 Like the scoop is not necessary? Well, a lot of people want to scoop. I get it.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.360
 I get it completely. That's my natural inclination, yeah.

30:47.360 --> 30:52.160
 I don't want to scoop specifically because if it is life, I want to know everything I can

30:52.160 --> 30:58.000
 and remotely before I interfere. So that's my, I've got ethical reasons against the scoop,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.760
 more than engineering reasons against the scoop. But I have some engineering

31:01.760 --> 31:05.840
 reasons against the scoop. Scoop is not a technical term, but I feel like now it's too late.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.720
 Thank you for going along with this. It's too late to take it back.

31:08.720 --> 31:09.840
 I appreciate it.

31:09.840 --> 31:14.080
 We don't understand the clouds well enough to plan the scoop very well.

31:14.080 --> 31:18.960
 Because it's not that saturated, like there's not that much of it present.

31:18.960 --> 31:27.120
 No, and the place is nasty. It's not going to be easy to build something that can do the task

31:27.120 --> 31:33.040
 reliably and can be trusted. The measurements can be trusted and then pass that message on.

31:33.040 --> 31:38.640
 So actually, I'm for an orbiter. I think we should have orbiters around every solar system body,

31:39.200 --> 31:45.280
 whose job is just to learn about these places. I'm disappointed we haven't already got an orbiter

31:45.280 --> 31:49.040
 around every single one of them. It's small. It can be a small satellite,

31:49.040 --> 31:53.120
 splitting data, figuring out, you know, how do the clouds move? What's in them?

31:53.120 --> 31:57.840
 How often is there lightning and volcanic activity? Where's the topography? Is it changing?

31:58.800 --> 32:04.160
 Is there a biosphere actively doing things? We should be monitoring this from afar.

32:04.800 --> 32:11.920
 And so I'm for over the atmosphere, hopefully around Venus. That would be my choice.

32:11.920 --> 32:19.920
 Okay. So now recently, Venus is all exciting about phosphine and everything. Is there other stuff

32:19.920 --> 32:27.120
 maybe before we were looking at Venus or now looking out into other solar systems? Is there

32:27.120 --> 32:34.000
 other promising exoplanets or other planets within the solar system that might have phosphine

32:34.000 --> 32:42.320
 or might have other strong biosignatures that we should be looking for like phosphine?

32:42.320 --> 32:49.120
 There's a few, but outside the solar system, all our promising candidates, we know so little

32:49.120 --> 32:55.040
 about them. For most of them, we barely know their density. Most of them, we don't even know if they

32:55.040 --> 33:00.240
 have an atmosphere. Never mind what that atmosphere might contain. So we're still very much at the

33:00.240 --> 33:05.680
 stage where we have detected promising planets, but they're promising in that they're about the

33:05.680 --> 33:11.600
 right size, about the right density, they could have an atmosphere, and they're about the right

33:11.600 --> 33:16.800
 distance from their host star. But that's really all we know. Near future telescopes will tell us

33:16.800 --> 33:23.360
 much more, but for now, we're just guessing. So you said near future. So there's hope that

33:23.360 --> 33:28.960
 there'll be telescopes that can see that far enough to determine if there's an atmosphere and

33:28.960 --> 33:34.240
 perhaps even the contents of that atmosphere? Absolutely. JWST, launching later this year,

33:34.240 --> 33:41.360
 will be able to get a very rough sense of the main atmospheric constituents of planets

33:42.160 --> 33:48.480
 that could potentially be habitable. And that's this year. What's the name? JWST, the James Webb

33:48.480 --> 33:54.000
 Space Telescope. Okay. And that's going to be out in space past the atmosphere? Yes. Is there

33:54.000 --> 33:57.280
 something interesting to be said about the engineering aspect of the telescope?

33:57.280 --> 34:03.760
 That's an incredible beast, but it's a beast of many burdens. So what it's going to do,

34:04.880 --> 34:11.440
 it's good. See, you are a poet. You're, yeah, I love it. This is very eloquent. You're speaking

34:11.440 --> 34:17.920
 to the audience, which I appreciate. So yeah, so it's a giant engineering project. And

34:18.560 --> 34:23.760
 is it orbiting something? Do you know? So it's going to be above the atmosphere. And it will be

34:23.760 --> 34:30.640
 doing lots of different astrophysics. And so some of its time will be dedicated to exoplanets.

34:31.600 --> 34:38.240
 But there's an entire astronomy field fighting for time before the cryogenic lifetime of the

34:39.600 --> 34:45.120
 instrument. And so when I was looking for the possibility of finding phosphine on distant

34:45.120 --> 34:52.560
 exoplanets, I used JWST as a way of checking with this instrument that we will launch later this

34:52.560 --> 34:59.600
 year. Could we detect phosphine on an oxygen poor planet? And there I put very much a hard stop where

35:00.240 --> 35:05.200
 some of my simulations said, yes, you can totally do it, but it will take a little under the cryogenic

35:05.200 --> 35:10.160
 lifetime of this machine. So then I had to go, well, that's not going to, no one's going to

35:10.160 --> 35:17.760
 dedicate all of JWST to look for my molecule that no one cared about. So we're very much at that edge.

35:17.760 --> 35:22.800
 But there'll be many other telescopes in the coming decades that will be able to tell us

35:22.800 --> 35:25.840
 quite a lot about the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets.

35:26.560 --> 35:31.840
 So you mentioned a simulation. This is super interesting to me. And this perhaps could be

35:31.840 --> 35:40.720
 a super dumb question, but I'm going to prove you wrong on that one. You simulate molecules to

35:40.720 --> 35:44.800
 understand how they look from a distance is what I understand. Like, what does that simulation

35:44.800 --> 35:52.800
 look like? So it's talking about which colors that the rainbow will be missing. Is that the

35:52.800 --> 35:58.480
 goal of the simulation? That's a goal, but it's really just a very, very nasty Schrodinger's

35:58.480 --> 36:03.600
 equation. So it's a quantum simulation. Also, it's simulating at the quantum level.

36:03.600 --> 36:08.240
 Yes. So I'm a quantum astrochemist. Hi, I'm Clara. I'm a quantum astrochemist.

36:08.240 --> 36:13.360
 That's how we should have started this conversation. Can you describe the three components of that

36:14.160 --> 36:17.760
 quantum astro and chemist and how they interplay together?

36:18.720 --> 36:24.400
 So I study the quantum behavior of molecules, hence the quantum and the chemist,

36:25.440 --> 36:33.360
 specifically so I can detect them in space and see astro. So what I do is I figure out the

36:33.360 --> 36:40.640
 probability of a molecule being in a particular state. There's no deterministic nature to the

36:40.640 --> 36:48.400
 work I do. So every transition is just a likelihood. But if you get a population of that molecule,

36:48.400 --> 36:54.320
 it will always happen. And so this is all of the quantum level. It's a Schrodinger equation on,

36:54.320 --> 36:59.840
 I think, 27 dimensions. I don't remember it by heart. And what this means is I'm solving these

36:59.840 --> 37:07.120
 giant quantum matrices. And that's why you need a lot of computer power, giant computers,

37:07.120 --> 37:15.760
 to diagonalize these enormous matrices, each of whom describes a single vibrational behavior of

37:15.760 --> 37:24.320
 a molecule. So I think phosphine has 17.5 million possible states it can exist in.

37:24.320 --> 37:31.280
 And transitions can occur between pairs of these states. And there's a certain likelihood that

37:31.280 --> 37:35.680
 they'll happen. This is the quantum world. Nothing is deterministic. There's just a likelihood

37:35.680 --> 37:40.640
 that it'll jump from one state to another. And these jumps, they're transitions,

37:41.280 --> 37:47.280
 and there's 16.8 billion of them. When energy is absorbed, that corresponds to this transition,

37:47.280 --> 37:51.120
 we see it in the spectrum. This is more quantum chemistry than you had asked for, I'm sorry.

37:51.120 --> 37:57.040
 No, no, I'm sorry. Brain's broken. So when the transitions happen between the different states,

37:58.640 --> 38:04.080
 somehow the energy maps the spectrum. Exactly. Energy corresponds to a frequency,

38:04.080 --> 38:07.280
 and a frequency corresponds to a wavelength, which corresponds to a color.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.760
 So there's some probability assigned to each color then?

38:11.760 --> 38:16.000
 Exactly. And that probability determines how intense that transition will be, how strong.

38:16.000 --> 38:22.960
 And so you run this kind of simulation for particular, so that's 17.5 square or something

38:22.960 --> 38:30.320
 like that. Exactly. 17.5 million energies, each one of whom involves diagonalizing a giant matrix

38:30.320 --> 38:35.680
 with a supercomputer. Which I wonder what the most efficient algorithm for diagonalization is.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.280
 But there's some kind of... There's many.

38:38.400 --> 38:44.080
 Depends on kind of the shape of the matrix. So they're not random matrices. So some are more

38:44.080 --> 38:49.200
 diagonal than others. And so some need more treatment than others. Most of the work ends up

38:49.200 --> 38:54.400
 going in describing this system, this quantum system, in different ways until you have a matrix

38:54.400 --> 38:59.280
 that is close to being diagonal. And then it's much easier to clean it up.

38:59.280 --> 39:06.240
 So how hard is this puzzle? So you're solving this puzzle for phosphine, right?

39:06.240 --> 39:12.880
 Is this... Are we supposed to solve this puzzle for every single molecule?

39:13.680 --> 39:20.480
 Oh boy. Yes, I calculated if I did the work I did for phosphine, again, for all the molecules for

39:20.480 --> 39:26.960
 which we don't have spectra, for which we don't have a fingerprint, it would take me 62,000 years.

39:26.960 --> 39:33.920
 A little over. 62,000 years. What time flies when you're having fun? Okay. But you write that

39:33.920 --> 39:40.720
 there are about 16,000 molecules we care about when looking for a new Earth or when we try to detect

39:40.720 --> 39:46.720
 alien biosignatures. If we want to detect any molecules from here, we need to know their spectra

39:47.520 --> 39:53.200
 and we currently don't. Solving this particular problem, that's my job.

39:53.200 --> 39:58.160
 What was that? I mean, that's absolutely correct. I could have not said it better myself. Did you

39:58.160 --> 40:03.280
 take that from my website? Yeah, I think I stole it. And your website is excellent. So it's worthy

40:03.280 --> 40:09.760
 place to steal stuff from. Thank you. How do you solve this problem for the 16,000 molecules we care

40:09.760 --> 40:18.640
 about, of which phosphine is one? Yes. And so taking a step a little bit out of phosphine,

40:20.240 --> 40:25.520
 is there... But we were having so much fun. We were having so much fun. No, we're not saying...

40:25.520 --> 40:29.600
 No, no, no, I... It's sticking around. I'm just saying we're joining more friends coming to the

40:29.600 --> 40:35.760
 party. How do you choose other friends to come to the party that are interesting to study as we

40:35.760 --> 40:42.720
 solve one puzzle at a time through the space of 16,000? So we've already started. Out of those 16,000,

40:42.720 --> 40:47.440
 we understand water quite well, methane quite well, ammonia quite well, carbon dioxide.

40:48.480 --> 40:53.440
 I could keep going. And then we understand molecules like acetylene, hydrogen cyanide,

40:53.440 --> 41:01.120
 more or less. And that takes us to about 4% of those 16,000. We understand about 4% of them,

41:01.120 --> 41:08.080
 more or less. Phosphine is one of them. But the other 96%, we just really have barely any idea

41:08.080 --> 41:16.640
 at all of where in the spectrum of light they would leave a mark. I can't spend the next 62,000

41:16.640 --> 41:25.360
 years doing this work. And I don't want to, even if somehow I was able, that wouldn't feel good.

41:26.240 --> 41:32.880
 So one of the things that I try to do now is move away from how I did phosphine. So I did

41:32.880 --> 41:37.840
 phosphine really the best that I could, the best that could be done with the computer power that

41:37.840 --> 41:44.480
 we have, trying to get each one of those 16.8 billion transitions mapped accurately calculated.

41:44.480 --> 41:51.760
 And then I thought, what if I do a worse job? What if I just do a much worse job?

41:52.880 --> 42:00.080
 Can I just make it much faster and then it's still worth it? How bad can I get

42:00.080 --> 42:06.480
 before it's worthless? And then could I do this for all the other molecules? So I created exactly

42:06.480 --> 42:12.320
 this terrible, terrible system. So what's the answer to that question,

42:12.320 --> 42:15.440
 that fundamental question I ask myself all the time in other domains?

42:15.440 --> 42:18.000
 How crappy can I be before I'm useless? Before somebody notices.

42:19.200 --> 42:25.200
 Turns out pretty crappy because no one has any idea what these molecules look like.

42:26.080 --> 42:31.360
 Anything is better than nothing. And so I thought, how long will it take me to create

42:31.360 --> 42:36.640
 better than nothing spectra for all of these molecules? And so I created rascal, rapid,

42:36.640 --> 42:45.440
 approximate spectral calculations for all. And what I do is I use organic chemistry and

42:45.440 --> 42:51.040
 quantum chemistry and kind of cheat them both. I just tried to figure out what is the fastest

42:51.040 --> 42:57.600
 way I could run this. And I simulate rough spectra for all of those 16,000. So I've

42:57.600 --> 43:02.480
 managed to get it to work. It's really shocking how well it works considering how bad it is.

43:02.480 --> 43:09.040
 Is there insights you could give to the tricks involved in making it fast? Like what are the

43:10.400 --> 43:17.200
 maybe some insightful shortcuts taken that still result in some useful information about the spectra?

43:17.920 --> 43:23.920
 The insights came from organic chemistry from decades ago. When organic chemists wanted to

43:23.920 --> 43:28.400
 know what a compound might be, they would look at a spectrum and see a feature and they would go,

43:28.400 --> 43:33.040
 hmm, I've seen that feature before. That's usually what happens when you have a carbon

43:33.040 --> 43:38.320
 triple bonded to another carbon. And they were mostly right. Almost every molecule that has a

43:38.320 --> 43:44.160
 carbon triple bonded to another one looks like that. Has other features different from that

43:44.160 --> 43:50.160
 distinguish them from one another, but they have that feature in common. We call these functional

43:50.160 --> 43:56.880
 groups. And so most of that work ended up being abandoned because now we have mass spectrometry,

43:56.880 --> 44:02.880
 we've got nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. So people don't really need to do that anymore.

44:02.880 --> 44:09.280
 But these ancient textbooks still exist. And I've collected them all as many as I could.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.840
 And there are hundreds of these descriptions where people have said, oh, whenever you have

44:16.800 --> 44:21.360
 iodine atom connected to this one, there's always a feature here. And it's usually quite sharp.

44:21.360 --> 44:25.280
 And it's quite strong. And some people go, oh, yeah, that's a really broad feature every time

44:25.280 --> 44:30.320
 that combination of atoms and bonds. So I've collected them all. And I've created this giant

44:30.320 --> 44:38.240
 dictionary of all these kind of puzzle pieces, these Lego parts of molecules. And I've written a

44:38.240 --> 44:42.880
 code that then puts them all together in some kind of like Frankenstein's monster of molecules.

44:43.520 --> 44:49.200
 So you ask me for any molecule and I go, well, it has these bonds and this atom dangling off this

44:49.200 --> 44:56.160
 atom and this cluster here. And I tell you what it should look like. And it kind of works.

44:57.120 --> 45:03.440
 So this creates a whole portfolio of just kind of signatures that we could look for.

45:03.440 --> 45:08.160
 Rough, very rough signatures. But still useful enough to analyze the atmospheres,

45:08.880 --> 45:13.360
 the telescope generated images of other planets.

45:13.360 --> 45:22.080
 Close. Right now, it is so complete. So it has all of these molecules that I can tell you,

45:22.080 --> 45:27.520
 say you look at an alien atmosphere and there's a feature there. It can tell you, oh,

45:27.520 --> 45:32.960
 that feature, that's familiar. It could be one of these 816 molecules. Best of luck.

45:32.960 --> 45:37.920
 Yes. So I think the next step, which is what I'm working on is telling you something

45:37.920 --> 45:42.960
 more useful than it could be one of those 816 molecules. That's still true. I wouldn't say

45:42.960 --> 45:48.640
 it's useful. So it can tell you, but only 12% of them also have a feature in this region. So

45:48.640 --> 45:54.080
 go look there. And if there's nothing there, it can't be those and so on. It can also tell you

45:54.080 --> 46:00.400
 things like you will need this much accuracy to distinguish between those 816. So that's

46:00.400 --> 46:07.920
 what I'm working on. But it's a lot of work. So this is really interesting, the role of computing

46:07.920 --> 46:16.960
 in this whole picture, emission code. So you as a quantum astrochemist, there is some role for

46:16.960 --> 46:20.800
 programming in your life, in your past life, in your current life, in your group. Oh yeah,

46:20.800 --> 46:25.200
 almost entirely. I'm a computational quantum astrochemist, but that doesn't roll off the tongue

46:25.200 --> 46:30.560
 very easily. So this is fundamentally computational. If you want to be successful in the 21st century

46:30.560 --> 46:34.800
 and doing quantum astrochemistry, you want to be computational? Absolutely. All quantum chemistry

46:34.800 --> 46:41.360
 is computational at this point. Okay. Does machine learning play a role at all? Is there some

46:41.360 --> 46:47.200
 extra shortcuts that could be discovered through like, you see all that success with protein

46:47.200 --> 46:53.520
 folding, right? A problem that thought to be extremely difficult to apply machine learning to

46:53.520 --> 47:05.280
 because it's mostly because there's not a lot of already solved puzzles to train on. I suppose

47:05.280 --> 47:10.000
 the same exact thing is true with this particular problem, but is there hope for machine learning

47:10.000 --> 47:16.240
 to help out? Absolutely. Currently, you've laid out exactly the problem. The training set is

47:17.040 --> 47:22.880
 awful. And because there's so, a lot of the data that I'm basing it on is literally many

47:22.880 --> 47:27.840
 decades old. The people who worked on it and the data that I get, often they're dead. And

47:28.720 --> 47:34.080
 the files that I've used, some of them were hand drawn by someone tired in the 70s.

47:34.800 --> 47:40.480
 So I could of course have a program training on these, but I would just be perpetuating

47:40.480 --> 47:47.360
 these mistakes without hope of actually verifying them. So my next step is to improve this training

47:47.360 --> 47:53.360
 set by hand and then try to see if I can apply machine learning on the full code and the full

47:53.360 --> 47:59.600
 16,000 molecules and improve them all. But really, I need to be able to test the outcomes with

47:59.600 --> 48:05.440
 experimental data, which means convincing someone in a lab to spend a lot of money putting very

48:05.440 --> 48:12.320
 dangerous gases in chambers and measuring them at outrageous temperatures. So it's a work in

48:12.320 --> 48:21.280
 progress. And so collecting huge amounts of data about the actual gases. So you're up for doing

48:21.280 --> 48:28.720
 that kind of thing too. So actually, like doing the full end to end thing, which is like having

48:28.720 --> 48:35.440
 a gas collecting data about it, and then doing the kind of analysis that creates the fingerprint,

48:35.440 --> 48:40.880
 and then also analyzing using that library, the data that comes from other planets. So you do the

48:40.880 --> 48:48.160
 full full from birth to death. Yes, I worked in an industrial chemistry laboratory when I was

48:48.160 --> 48:54.160
 much younger in Slovenia. And there I worked in the lab actually collecting spectra and

48:54.160 --> 49:00.640
 predicting spectra. What's it like to work with a bunch of gases that are like not so human friendly?

49:00.640 --> 49:07.920
 It's fine. It's horrific. It's so scary. And I love my job. I'm willing to clearly sacrifice a lot

49:07.920 --> 49:19.200
 for it, job stability, money, sanity. But I only worked there for a few months. It was really

49:19.200 --> 49:24.720
 terrifying. There's just so many ways to die. Usually you only have a handful of ways to die

49:24.720 --> 49:31.600
 every day. But if you work in a lab, there's so many more, orders of magnitude more. And I was

49:31.600 --> 49:39.760
 very bad at it. I'm not a good hands on scientist. I want a laptop connected to a remote supercomputer

49:40.400 --> 49:47.680
 or a laptop connected to a telescope. I don't need to be there to believe it. And I am not good

49:47.680 --> 49:52.640
 in the lab. Yeah, when there's a bunch of things that can poison you, a bunch of things that could

49:52.640 --> 49:57.520
 explode and they're gaseous and they're often maybe they might not even have a smell or they

49:57.520 --> 50:04.720
 might not be visible. So many of them give you cancer. It's just so cruel. And some people love

50:04.720 --> 50:11.760
 this work, but I've never enjoyed experimental work. It's so ungrateful. It's so lonely.

50:12.800 --> 50:19.200
 Well, most, I mean, so much work is lonely if you find the joy in it. But you enjoy the results of

50:19.200 --> 50:26.240
 it. Yes. I'm very thankful for all the experimentalists in my life. But I'll do the theory. They do

50:26.240 --> 50:31.440
 the experiment and then we talked one another and make sure it matches. Okay, beautiful.

50:31.440 --> 50:36.880
 What are spectroscopic networks? Those look super cool. Are they related to what we were talking

50:36.880 --> 50:42.880
 about? The picture looked pretty. Oh, yes, slightly. So remember when I mentioned the 17.5

50:42.880 --> 50:49.920
 million energy levels? Yes. There are rules for each molecule on which energy levels they can jump

50:49.920 --> 50:57.360
 from and to and how likely it is to make that jump. And so if you plot all the routes it can take,

50:57.360 --> 51:04.160
 you get this energy network for which is like a ball. So these are the constraints of the

51:04.160 --> 51:09.360
 transitions that could be taken. Exactly for each molecule. Interesting. And no, they're not,

51:09.360 --> 51:15.600
 so it's not a fully connected. It's like, it's sparse somehow. Yes, you get islands sometimes.

51:15.600 --> 51:21.440
 You get a molecule can only jump from one set of states to another and it's trapped now in this

51:21.440 --> 51:27.440
 network. It can never go to another network that could have been available to other siblings.

51:27.440 --> 51:31.280
 Is there some insight to be drawn from these networks? Like something cool that you can

51:31.280 --> 51:36.640
 understand about a particular molecule because of it? Yes, some molecules have what we call forbidden

51:36.640 --> 51:40.640
 transitions, which aren't really forbidden because it's quantum. There are no rules. No,

51:40.640 --> 51:46.480
 there are rules. It's just the rules are very often broken in the quantum world. And so forbidden

51:46.480 --> 51:51.120
 transitions doesn't actually mean they're forbidden. Low probability. Exactly. They just

51:51.120 --> 51:56.560
 become deeply unlikely. Yeah, cool. And then so you could do all the same, like coming from a

51:56.560 --> 52:02.080
 computer science world, you know, I love graph theory. So you can do all the same like graph

52:02.080 --> 52:07.120
 theoretic kind of analysis of like clusters or something like that or all those kinds of things

52:07.120 --> 52:12.800
 and draw insights from it. And they're unique for each molecule. So the networks that you mentioned,

52:13.840 --> 52:19.200
 that's actually not too difficult a layer of quantum physics. By then all the energies are

52:19.200 --> 52:24.400
 mapped. So we've had high school children work on those networks. And the trick is to not tell them

52:24.400 --> 52:28.080
 they're doing quantum physics until like three months in when it's too late for them to back out.

52:28.880 --> 52:32.160
 And then you're like, you're a quantum physicist now and it's really nice.

52:32.160 --> 52:37.120
 Yeah. Okay. But like the promise of this, even though it's $16,000, even just a subset of them,

52:37.120 --> 52:41.520
 that's really exciting. Because then you can do as the telescope day to get better and better,

52:41.520 --> 52:49.280
 especially for exoplanets, but also for Venus, you can then start like getting your full like,

52:49.280 --> 52:53.120
 you know, how you get like bloodwork done or like you get your genetic testing to see what your

52:53.120 --> 52:59.200
 ancestors are, you can get the same kind of like high resolution information about interesting

52:59.200 --> 53:03.520
 things going on on a particular planet based on the atmosphere, right? Exactly. How cool would

53:03.520 --> 53:08.800
 that be if we could, you know, scan an alien planet and go, oh, this is what the clouds are made of.

53:08.800 --> 53:13.600
 This is what's in the surface. These are the molecules that are mixing. Here are probably

53:13.600 --> 53:19.440
 oceans because you can see these types of molecules above it. And here are the Hadley cells. Here are

53:20.320 --> 53:24.240
 how the biosphere works. We could map this whole thing.

53:24.240 --> 53:28.320
 Wouldn't it be cool if the aliens like are aware of these techniques and like would spoof

53:28.320 --> 53:34.400
 like the wrong gases just to like pretend that's how they can be. It's like an invisibility cloak.

53:34.400 --> 53:40.080
 They can generate gases that would throw you off or like, or do the opposite. They pretend they

53:40.080 --> 53:46.240
 would artificially generate phosphine. So like, like the dumb, the dumb apes on earth again,

53:46.240 --> 53:52.000
 like go out like flying in different places because it's just fun. It's like some teenager alien

53:52.000 --> 53:58.720
 somewhere just pranking. Yeah. I was asked that exact question this Saturday by a seven year old

53:58.720 --> 54:05.920
 boy in Canada. Oh, seven? Yes. But it was the first time I'd been asked that question this

54:05.920 --> 54:16.560
 the second in a week. Were kindred spirits him and I? We can. They can prank us to some extent,

54:16.560 --> 54:22.240
 but the this work of interpreting an alien atmosphere means you're reading the atmosphere

54:22.240 --> 54:27.680
 as a message. And it's very hard to hide signs of life in an atmosphere because

54:28.960 --> 54:34.800
 you can try to prank us, but you're still going to fart and breathe and somehow metabolize the

54:34.800 --> 54:41.440
 environment around you and call that whatever you call that and release molecules. And so that's

54:41.440 --> 54:47.760
 really hard to hide. You know, you can go very quiet. You can throw out some weird molecule to

54:47.760 --> 54:53.600
 confuse us further, but we can still see all your other metabolites. It's hard to fake. Is there,

54:54.320 --> 55:02.000
 so you kind of mentioned like water, what other gases are there that we know about that are like

55:02.640 --> 55:08.640
 high likelihood as biosignatures in terms of life? I mean, what are your other favorites?

55:08.640 --> 55:18.400
 So we've got phosphine, but what else is a damn good signal to be that you think about that we

55:18.400 --> 55:23.040
 should be looking for if we look at another atmosphere? Is there gases that come to mind or

55:23.040 --> 55:30.000
 are there all sort of possible biosignatures that we should love equally? There's many,

55:30.000 --> 55:34.640
 so there's water. We know that's important for life as we know it. There's molecular oxygen

55:34.640 --> 55:38.800
 on earth. That's probably the most robust sign of life, particularly combined with small amounts

55:38.800 --> 55:44.480
 of methane. And it's true that the majority of the oxygen and atmosphere is a product of life.

55:44.480 --> 55:51.440
 And so if I was an alien astronomer and I saw Earth's atmosphere, I would get a Nobel, I think.

55:52.560 --> 55:57.120
 What would you notice? I mean, this is really... I would be very excited about this.

55:57.120 --> 56:03.200
 About the oxygen. About 20%, 21% of oxygen atmosphere. That's very unusual.

56:03.200 --> 56:07.120
 So would that be the most exciting thing to you from an alien perspective about Earth

56:07.120 --> 56:12.640
 in terms of analyzing the atmosphere? What are the biosignatures of life on earth,

56:12.640 --> 56:17.920
 would you say, in terms of the contents of the atmosphere? Is oxygen high amount of oxygen

56:17.920 --> 56:23.440
 pretty damn good sign? I mean, it's not as good as the TV signals we've been sending out. Those

56:23.440 --> 56:30.000
 are slightly more robust than oxygen. Oxygen on its own has false positives for life,

56:30.000 --> 56:36.560
 so there's still ways of making it. But it's a pretty robust sign of life in the context of

56:36.560 --> 56:42.240
 atmosphere with the radiation that the sun produces, our position in relation to the sun,

56:42.240 --> 56:47.680
 the other components of our atmosphere, the volcanic activity we have, all of that together

56:47.680 --> 56:55.040
 makes the 20% of oxygen extremely robust sign of life. But outside that context,

56:55.040 --> 57:01.600
 you could still produce oxygen without life. But phosphine, although better in the sense of

57:01.600 --> 57:07.040
 it is much harder to make, it has lower false positives, still has some. So I'm actually

57:07.040 --> 57:13.200
 against looking for specific molecules unless we're looking for like CFCs. If we find CFCs,

57:13.200 --> 57:18.640
 that's definitely aliens. I feel confident chlorofluorocarbons. And so if aliens had been

57:18.640 --> 57:25.040
 watching us, they would have been going, oh no, CFCs, I mean, they're not going to last long.

57:25.040 --> 57:32.000
 Let's see, everyone's writing their thesis on the end of the earth. And then we got together,

57:32.000 --> 57:37.120
 we stopped using them. I like to think they're really proud of us. They literally saw our ozone

57:37.120 --> 57:41.200
 hull shrinking. They've been watching it and they saw it happen. I think to be honest,

57:41.200 --> 57:44.800
 they're more paying attention to the whole nuclear thing. I don't think they care,

57:44.800 --> 57:48.960
 it's not going to bother them. Oh, I mean, worried about us. Oh, yes. No, worried about us.

57:48.960 --> 57:54.400
 They, I mean, this is why the aliens have been showing up recently. It's like, if you look at,

57:54.400 --> 57:59.120
 I mean, there is interest, I mean, it's probably there's a correlation with a lot of things. But

57:59.120 --> 58:05.520
 what the ufologists, quote unquote, often talk about is that there seems to be a much higher

58:05.520 --> 58:11.520
 level of UFO sightings since like in the nuclear age. So like if aliens were indeed worried about

58:11.520 --> 58:17.360
 us, like if you were aliens, you would start showing up when the living organisms have first

58:17.360 --> 58:26.480
 discovered a way to destroy the entire colony. Couldn't the increase in sightings not have to

58:26.480 --> 58:31.600
 do with the fact that people now have more cameras? It's an interesting thing about science. Like

58:31.600 --> 58:40.240
 with UFO sightings, it's like either 99.9% of them are false or 100% of them are false. The

58:40.240 --> 58:48.400
 interesting thing to me is that in that 0.01%, there's a lot of things in science that are like

58:48.400 --> 58:54.000
 these weird outliers, they're difficult to replicate. You have like, there's even physical phenomena,

58:54.000 --> 58:58.960
 ball lightning, there's difficult things to artificially create in large amounts or observe

58:59.840 --> 59:04.560
 in nature in large amounts in such a way that you can do to apply the scientific method.

59:04.560 --> 59:11.280
 There could be just things that like what happened like a few times like or once and you're like,

59:11.280 --> 59:16.160
 what the hell is that? And that that's very difficult for science to know what to do with.

59:16.160 --> 59:20.720
 I'm a huge proponent of just being open minded because when you're open minded about aliens,

59:20.720 --> 59:27.920
 for example, is it allows you to think outside of the box in other domains as well. And somehow

59:27.920 --> 59:33.600
 that will result like if you open mind about aliens and you don't, you know, don't laugh it off

59:33.600 --> 59:38.400
 immediately, what happens is somehow that's going to lead to a solution to a P equals on P or P

59:38.400 --> 59:45.280
 not equals on P. Like in ways that you can't predict the open mindedness has tertiary effects

59:45.280 --> 59:50.080
 that will result in progress, I believe, which is why I'm a huge fan of aliens because it's like

59:51.520 --> 59:58.160
 because too many scientists roll their eyes at the idea of aliens, alien life. And to me,

59:58.160 --> 1:00:04.400
 it's one of the most exciting possibilities and the biggest, most exciting questions

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:13.040
 before all of human civilization. So to roll your eyes is not the right answer. To roll your eyes

1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:17.840
 presumes that you know anything about this world as opposed to just knowing point zero, zero, zero

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:25.200
 one percent of this world. And so being humble in the face of that, being open to the possibility

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:31.360
 of aliens visiting Earth is a good idea. Not everything though, I'm not so open minded to the

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:38.160
 flat earth hypothesis is there's a growing number of people believing in. But even then

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:43.200
 or the inner earth, I've got shouted at in a public talk about it. So like the Earth is hollow?

1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:50.160
 Yeah, my understanding is that there's this conspiracy theory that as far as I can tell

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:55.440
 has no grounding in reality is that there's a slightly smaller earth inside this one, which is

1:00:55.440 --> 1:01:01.440
 just too cute as a concept. And you can access it, I think, from Antarctica. And that's where we

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:08.800
 keep, and I quote, the mammoths and the Nazis. Yeah, I mean, that one is ridiculous. But like,

1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:14.800
 I do like, hey, I thought you were keeping an open mind. I genuinely think that's more likely than

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:21.280
 aliens visiting the Earth. And I say this as someone who has dedicated her life to finding alien life.

1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:28.880
 And so that's how improbable, I think, the visitations are. Because interstellar distances

1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.480
 are so huge, that it's just not really worth it. See, I have a different view on this whole thing.

1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:42.080
 I think the aliens that look like little green men are like extremely low probability event.

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:54.480
 Like mammoths and Nazis under that level. But other kind of ideas, the sad thing to me, and I think,

1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:01.040
 in my view, if there's other alien civilizations out there, and they visited Earth,

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:08.240
 neither them, or perhaps just us, would be even able to detect them. We wouldn't be open

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:17.920
 minded enough to see it. Because our understanding of what is life, and I just

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:25.200
 talked to Sarah Walker, who's Sarah. Yeah, we talked for three hours about the question of what is life.

1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:30.960
 Sarah's a good person to talk to about what is life. But the whole point is, we don't really,

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:36.880
 we have a very narrow minded view of what is life. And when it shows up, and it might be already here,

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:48.480
 trees, and dolphins, and so on, or mountains, or I don't know, or the molecules in the atmosphere,

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:56.320
 or like I, people make fun of me. But I do think that ideas are kind of aliens themselves,

1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:00.320
 or consciousness could be the aliens, or it could be the method by which they communicate.

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:05.680
 We don't know shit about the way our human mind works. And the fact that this thing is a quantum

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:13.040
 process. Please don't. I understand this. It's not woo woo. But it very well could be. There

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:17.760
 could be something at the physics level, right? It could be at the chemical or the biological

1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:23.120
 level. Things that are happening that we're just too close minded, because our conception of life

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:31.360
 is at the level of us, like at the jungle level of mammals. And on the time scale, that's the

1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:40.160
 human time scale, we may not be able to perceive what alien life is actually like. The scale at

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.920
 which their intelligence realizes itself, we may not be able to perceive. And the other thing that's

1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:52.480
 really important about alien visitations, whether it happened or not, is especially after COVID in

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:58.800
 2020, I'm losing a little bit of faith of our government being able to handle that well, not

1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:06.960
 our government, but us as a society, as a collective, being able to deal with new things

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:16.000
 in an effective way that's inspiring, that's efficient, that like, whether it's if it's a

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.960
 dangerous thing to deal with it to alleviate the danger, whether it's the possibility of

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:26.400
 new discoveries and something inspiring to ride that wave and make it inspiring, all those kinds

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:31.600
 of things. I honestly think if aliens showed up, they would look around, everybody would ignore them,

1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:36.640
 and the government might like hide it, try to like see to keep it from the Chinese and the

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:42.000
 Russians, if it's the United States, call it a military secret in a very close minded way.

1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:48.160
 And then the bureaucracy would drown it away to where through paperwork, the poor aliens would

1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:53.520
 just like waste away in a cell somewhere, like there's a certain that would never happen. Part

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:58.160
 of the reason that I feel so confident that aliens have no visited, because they would have had to

1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:03.360
 visit just to have a look remotely, you know, from Neptune or something, which makes no sense,

1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:10.640
 because interstellar travel is so difficult, that it would be quite a ridiculous proposition,

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:14.960
 but that's the bit that I think is technically possible. If they did come here, and they were

1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:20.880
 visible by anyone, detectable by anyone, the thought that any government, no matter or any

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:26.800
 military could just contain them, these beings are capable of traveling interstellar distances

1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:30.960
 when we can barely go to the moon, like barely go to the moon.

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.320
 So these things would be way, way, way, way.

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:38.160
 Way, and the fact that we think our puny military of any, even if all the military in the world

1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:43.680
 got together, and the fact that they could somehow contain this, it's that.

1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:46.560
 The ants trying to contain it, human that visited them.

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:52.080
 Exactly. And scientists, you would have to bring scientists on board. You've met a lot of scientists.

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:57.760
 How good are they at keeping secrets? Because in my experience, they're absolutely appalling

1:05:57.760 --> 1:05:59.440
 at keeping secrets. Yeah, that's terrible.

1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:03.120
 Even the Phosphine on Venus thing, which was a pretty well kept secret.

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:05.200
 Oh, this is true. You had a bunch of people there were.

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:11.600
 I told my dad, you know, my dad knew, and hopefully didn't tell anyone, but if there had

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:18.160
 been an alien visiting, he probably would have told the mate. And so these secrets could not be

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:22.480
 kept by any scientist that I know, and certainly not collaborative scientists, which would be

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:30.160
 needed. You would need all sorts of scientific teams. So between the pathetic power of any

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:37.440
 world's military compared to any civilization capable of traveling and our absolute inability

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:44.400
 to keep secrets, absolutely not. I will bet everything that we have not been visited because

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:49.200
 we are too pathetic to hold that truth. Well, let me put it back if we're just

1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:56.640
 making like a $10 bet. The possibility here that the main alien, say there exists one alien

1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:05.280
 civil, other intelligent alien civilization in the galaxy. To me, if they visit Earth,

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:10.480
 what's going to visit Earth is like the crappy, like the really crappy.

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:12.480
 Short straw. Yeah, yeah.

1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:19.120
 Like this like really dumb thing that's, I don't know, like the early Game Boys or something.

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:24.800
 I think there's a cartoon about this. There's an alien that gets sent to Earth, Commander Spiff or

1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:29.600
 something, and it's kind of a punishment or something. But that's not possible. That's the

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:34.960
 thing because interstellar distances are so hard to cross. You have to do it on purpose.

1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:39.360
 You have to do it on purpose. It has to be a big, big deal. And we know this because, yes,

1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:45.520
 you're right. We don't know enough about galactic biology. We don't know what the universal rules

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:51.760
 of biology or biochemistry are because we only have the Earth. But we do know that the laws of

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:57.520
 physics are universal. We can predict behavior in the universe and then see it happen based on

1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:03.200
 these laws of physics. We know that the laws of chemistry are universal. We know the periodic table

1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:09.200
 is all they have to choose from. So yes, they may be some sort of unimaginable intelligence,

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:14.560
 but they still have to use the same periodic table that we have access to. They still have

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:20.640
 a finite number of molecules they can do things with. So they still have to use the resources

1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:25.120
 around them, the stars around them, the universe around them, and we know how much energy is in

1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:31.920
 these places. And so, yes, they may be very capable, capable beyond our wildest dreams,

1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:36.080
 but they're still in the same universe. And we know a lot of those rules. We're not completely

1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:43.280
 blind. But there's a colleague here at Harvard, Kamran Vafa. He's a theoretical physicist. I

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:49.760
 don't know if you know him. I've only joined Harvard about six months ago. Okay. It's time to

1:08:49.760 --> 1:09:00.080
 meet all the theoretical physicists. So he's a string theorist, but his idea is that aliens

1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:05.120
 that are sophisticated enough to travel interstellar like those kinds of distances will figure out

1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:10.800
 actually ways to hack the fabric of the universe enough to have fun in other ways. Like this

1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:16.800
 universe is too boring. Like you would figure out ways to create other universes like you go

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:22.640
 outside the physics as we know it. So the reason we don't see aliens visiting us all over the place

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:27.200
 is they're having fun elsewhere. This is like way too boring. We humans think this is fun,

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:33.760
 but it's actually mostly empty space that no fun is happening. Like there's no fun in visiting Earth

1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:38.720
 for super advanced civilizations. So he thinks like if alien civilizations are out there,

1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:46.000
 they found outside of our current standard models of physics ways of having fun that don't involve

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.520
 us. That's probably true. But even the notion of visiting, that's so literally pedestrian.

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.400
 Of course, we want to go there because going there is the only thing we know. We see a thing we

1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:02.320
 want. We want to go there and get it. But that is probably something they've no longer gotten

1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:10.320
 need for. I specifically don't particularly want to go to space. Sounds awful. None of the things

1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:16.800
 I like are going to be there. And my whole work is my whole career is finding life and

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:22.880
 understanding the universe. So I care a lot. But I care about knowing about it. And I feel no need

1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:28.400
 to go there to learn about it. And I think as we develop better tools, hopefully people will feel

1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:35.280
 less and less in need to go everywhere that we know about. And I would expect any alien civilization

1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:41.520
 worth assault have developed observation tools and tools that allow them to understand the

1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:48.160
 universe around them and beyond without having to go there. This going is so wasteful.

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:53.680
 Yeah. So more focus on the knowledge and learning versus the colonization, the conquering and all

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:59.920
 those kinds of things. That's beneath them. That's beneath them. I mean, that said, do you think

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:08.400
 there's any hopeful search for life through phosphine and other gases? Do you think there's

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:14.160
 other alien civilizations out there? First, do you think there's other life out there? First,

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:19.040
 do you think there's life in the solar system? Second, do you think there's life in the

1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:26.640
 galaxy? And third, do you think there's intelligent life in the solar system or galaxy outside of

1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:33.920
 Earth? So intelligent life, I have no idea. It seems deeply unlikely possible, but I'm not even

1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:38.160
 sure if it's plausible. So that's a special thing to you about Earth is somehow intelligent life

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:45.280
 came to be. Yes. And it's only very briefly, probably extremely briefly. Uh oh. You mean

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:50.400
 it's always going to be like we're going to destroy ourselves? Exactly. Oh boy. And life will

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.080
 continue on Earth happily, probably more happily. The trees and the dolphins will be here, I'm

1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:04.880
 telling you. And the cockroaches and the incredible fungi, they'll be fine. So life on Earth was

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:10.240
 fine before us and will be fine after us. So I'm not that worried about intelligent life,

1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:15.520
 but I think it is unlikely. Even on Earth is unlikely. Out of what is it, five billion species

1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:20.800
 across the history of the Earth? Yes. There's been one, an intelligent one. And for a blink of an eye,

1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:28.080
 possibly not much longer than that. So I wouldn't bet on that at all, though I would love it, of

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:37.760
 course. You know, I wanted to find aliens since I was a little girl. And so of course I initially

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:42.480
 wanted to find ones that I could be friends with. Yeah. And I've had to let go of that dream because

1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.640
 it's so deeply implausible. But see, the nice, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the nice thing about

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:52.240
 intelligent alien civilizations, they may have more biosignatures than nonintelligent ones.

1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:57.200
 So they might be easier to detect. That would be the hope. On Earth, that's not the case,

1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:01.360
 but it could be the case elsewhere. Oh, it's not the case on Earth. Most of the biosignatures we

1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:07.840
 have on Earth are created by quite simple life. If you don't count pollution, pollution is all.

1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:19.120
 So you don't see polluting gases as a possible, like... I look for polluting gases. I would love

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:24.480
 to find polluting gases. Well, you know, I'll be worried for them, of course, the same way I

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:28.720
 think about my alien colleagues all the time looking at us, and I'm sure they worry about our

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:35.840
 pollutions. But it would be a really good, robust, unambiguous sign of life if we found

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:40.720
 complex pollutants. So I look for those too. I just don't have any hope of finding them. I think

1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:49.120
 intelligent life in the galaxy at the same time that we're looking is deeply implausible. But life,

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:57.120
 I think, is inevitable. And if it is inevitable, it is common. So I think there'll be life

1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:04.000
 everywhere in the galaxy. Now, how common that life is, I think will depend a lot on whether

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:10.080
 there's life in the solar system beyond Earth. So I'll adjust my expectations very much based

1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:15.200
 on there being life in the solar system. If there's life in the Venusian clouds,

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:21.440
 if there's life in the, if there are biasingers coming out of the plumes of Enceladus, if there's

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:27.200
 life on Titan. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, plumes of Enceladus. That's the Saturn one.

1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:32.000
 It's the moon that has the geysers that come out. And so you can't see the under the subterranean

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.960
 oceans. But it's supposed, so it would be in the atmosphere. I was going to ask you about that one.

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.000
 Have you looked at that? Have you? Is that a hope for you to use the tools you're using with

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:55.680
 Rascal and other ways for detecting the 16,000 molecules that might be biosignatures to look at

1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:02.400
 Enceladus? Yes, that's absolutely the plan. What's the limiting factor currently? Is it the

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:08.640
 quality of the telescopes? What's the quality of the data? Yeah, the quality of the data,

1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:13.920
 the observational data, and also the quality of Rascal and other associated things. So we're missing

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:18.960
 a lot of fundamental data to interpret the data that we get, and we don't have good enough data.

1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:24.800
 But hopefully we will, in the coming decades, we'll get some information on Titan. We have

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:32.800
 Dragonfly going over. We'll get the plumes of Enceladus. We will look at the clouds of Enus,

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:39.840
 and there's other places. And so if we find any life or any sign of life ever, like on Mars,

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:45.840
 then I'll adjust my calculations, and I'll say life is not just inevitable and common,

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:51.040
 but extremely common. Because all of these places we've mentioned, the Subterranean Oceans on Enceladus,

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:57.760
 the methane oceans of Titan, the clouds of Enus, the acidic clouds of Enus, these are places that

1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:02.720
 are very different from the places where we find life on Earth, even the most extreme places.

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:09.200
 And so if life can originate in all of these completely different habitats, then life is

1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:14.560
 even more resourceful than we thought, which means it's everywhere.

1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:20.080
 That's really exciting if it's everywhere. If there's life on just one of the moons,

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:26.320
 if it's on Mars. Anywhere in the solar system, and I will bet everything I own that every solar

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:32.080
 system, every planetary system has a potential for habitability. Because even if they don't have a

1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:39.520
 habitable planet, they'll have moons around other giant planets, and there'll be so much life. So for

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:45.440
 me, that's the only thing to figure out now, whether life is inevitable and quite common

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:51.280
 throughout the galaxy or everywhere. But it's somewhere between those two.

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:56.000
 Intelligent life, I make no bets. And if I had to bet, I would be against.

1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:03.200
 Yeah, to me, like two discoveries in the 21st century would change everything.

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:11.840
 One is, and maybe I'm biased, but one is a discovery of life in the solar system.

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:18.560
 I feel like that would change our whole conception of how unique we are in the universe.

1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:23.440
 I think I'm much more eager than you are to jump from basic life to intelligent life.

1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:30.320
 I feel like if there's life everywhere, like the odds are, we cannot...

1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:37.200
 Oh, I see. You're saying there could have been many intelligent civilizations out there,

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:41.200
 but they just keep dying out. It's like little... Yeah, I was detecting them, ships in the night.

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:49.360
 Ships in the night. That's ultra sad. Just like... Is it sad? The earth is not better for having us.

1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:55.840
 Is it... It doesn't owe us anything. Would you be sad to find alien giraffes?

1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:00.240
 Would you be disappointed if you found alien giraffes? Because I would not.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:03.920
 No. Well, giraffes, first of all, they look goofy with their necks and everything, but...

1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:09.040
 No, we do not shit on giraffes. Giraffes are wondrous animals that are deeply understudied.

1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:13.280
 We still know so little about them because no one does PhDs and giraffes. I am,

1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:17.440
 there's a point I made at PhD in Phosphine when people aren't doing PhDs and giraffes.

1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:20.960
 We do not know enough about giraffes. I think it was like Ricky Gervais that

1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:24.400
 did a whole, like, long thing about... You don't trust Ricky Gervais to talk about

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:30.560
 giraffes. That is not his expertise. Yeah, but it's a stupid necks. It doesn't make any sense.

1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:35.840
 I mean, that's fine. Giraffes are very resourceful animals who do incredible things and can

1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:39.280
 kick a lion in the face. Why don't you climb the tree? Why don't you climb the tree? You don't

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:43.440
 need to grow through the lengthy evolutionary process. You don't need to be shitting on giraffes.

1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:47.600
 Giraffes are wondrous animals. I would very appreciate it. Take it back.

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:55.920
 I take it back. I apologize. I trust your expertise on this. The thing that makes humans really

1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:06.960
 fascinating and I think the earth, but I'm a human, is we create things that are,

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:12.000
 yes, there's all the ugliness in the world. There's all the biological and the chemical

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:20.480
 level. There's the pollution, but we create beauty. If you, even from a physics perspective,

1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:25.920
 look at symmetry as somehow capturing beauty, the breaking of symmetries, stuff grounded in all

1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:32.240
 the different definitions of symmetry, we're good at, like, creating things. So as fighters.

1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:40.880
 But not giraffes. Okay, but yes, this is... There are fighters that create little bubbles of air

1:19:40.880 --> 1:19:45.920
 so they can breathe underwater. They can literally scuba dive. There are spiders that can create

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:52.240
 parachutes so they can glide and talk about symmetry. Look what spiders can do. I just thought

1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:58.640
 of spiders, but if I was an alien species coming to earth, there'll be plenty to wonder and we

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:06.240
 would just be one. One of the things. Yeah, clunky, naked monkey. Yeah, the ants might be

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:13.360
 even more fascinating. The ants. Ants can figure out exactly through some emergent consciousness

1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:20.720
 what the maximum distance between their trash, their babies, and their food is just from without

1:20:20.720 --> 1:20:25.440
 any of them knowing how to do this. And collectively, they've learned how to do this. If I was an alien

1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:29.200
 species, I'll be looking at that. Well, so that was the other thing I was going to mention. The

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:35.840
 second thing is I tend to believe we can engineer consciousness, but at the basic level, understand

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:43.520
 the source of consciousness because if consciousness is unique to humans and if we can engineer it,

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:48.640
 that gives me hope that it can be present elsewhere in the universe. That's the other thing that makes...

1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:55.840
 It's an open question that makes humans perhaps special is not maybe the presence of consciousness,

1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:02.960
 but somehow a presence of elevated consciousness. It does, again, maybe human centric, but it feels

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:08.080
 like we're more conscious than giraffes, for example, in spiders. Yes, I won't deny that.

1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:14.400
 There is something special about humans. They're my favorite species. They are.

1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:26.240
 Some of my best friends are humans. I think Kylie of humans, it's great. I just don't have

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:31.920
 great hope for our longevity and specifically, I don't have great hope given that we're the only

1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:37.520
 species that are 5 billion that did this cool consciousness trick. I don't want to bet on

1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:44.640
 finding a kinship elsewhere. That's quite interesting to think about. I don't think I've

1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:53.680
 even considered that possibility that there would be life in the solar system. That indicates that

1:21:53.680 --> 1:21:58.320
 very possibly life is literally everywhere. Yeah, everywhere can happen. It does.

1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:02.880
 Yeah, and especially what we're discovering with the exoplanets now,

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:12.000
 they're how numerous they are, or Earthlike habitable, quote unquote planets. They're everywhere.

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.880
 The most common type of planet is rocky, it seems.

1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:22.080
 But I didn't consider the possibility that life is literally everywhere and yet intelligent life

1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:29.200
 is nowhere long enough to communicate with each other, to form little clusters

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:33.360
 of civilizations that expand beyond the solar system and so on.

1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:43.440
 Man, maybe becoming a multiplanetary species is a less likely pursuit than we imagined.

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:48.000
 But one of the things that makes humans beautiful is we hope.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:55.600
 But I hope for humanity. And one of the things I hope for is that we become less

1:22:55.600 --> 1:23:01.840
 obsessed with conquering and we become less obsessed with spreading ourselves.

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:09.760
 I hope that we transcend that, that we're happy with the universe without having to go and take it.

1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:18.720
 So you can hope for the species without hoping for a multiplanetary existence. That is only,

1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:27.360
 I think, the drive of our most primitive instincts to go and take, to go and plant a

1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:34.400
 flag somewhere. We love planting a flag somewhere. And maybe we could overcome that minor drive.

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:41.520
 And once we do, the AI systems we build will destroy us because we're too peaceful and they

1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:46.080
 will go and conquer and plant the flags. Best of luck to them. The cockroaches will be happy to

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:52.960
 keep to the business as they always have. I tend to believe that robots can have the same

1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:01.280
 elegance and consciousness and all the qualities of kindness and love and hope and fear that

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:07.680
 that humans have. In principle, they could, yes. I don't really trust the people who make them.

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:15.360
 This is about the giraffe comment, isn't it? I haven't forgiven you for shitting on

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:21.040
 giraffes. What have they done to you? Just as a small tangent, your master's thesis is also

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.920
 fascinating. Maybe we could talk about it for just a little bit. It's titled,

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:32.720
 Influence of a Star's Evolution on His Planetary System. So this interplay between a star and a

1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:38.320
 planet, is there something interesting you could say about what you've learned about this journey

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:44.880
 that a star takes and the planets around it? Well, when I was younger and I was told what

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:51.200
 would happen ultimately to the Earth as the sun expands towards a red giant and

1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:59.360
 then Mercury would just fall in and then Venus fall in and the sun doesn't care.

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:10.240
 I felt so small. I felt like the Earth and everything on it, the universe doesn't care.

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:15.280
 Even our sun doesn't care. I think I felt like our sun should feel some sort of responsibility

1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:21.200
 for its planets. It just felt like such a violent and neglectful parent.

1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:25.440
 It's like a parent eating its own children. It's horrible. It's just a horrible notion.

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:32.560
 But it made me think, what if there's some sort of generation? And so at the time when I was doing

1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:37.680
 my masters, there was a notion of the white dwarf cemetery, which is this idea that when

1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.120
 stars become white wolves, that death is so horrible that planets, potentially habitable

1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:48.320
 planets that could have been habitable before, they're now gone. There's no chance for life.

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:54.160
 But then I thought, what if life returns? Now it's a white dwarf. It's calmed down.

1:25:54.160 --> 1:25:59.520
 It's not going to go anywhere. White dwarfs are very stable across universal time scales.

1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:04.880
 And so could you have planets around the white dwarf that could themselves get life again?

1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:13.360
 You know, life doesn't care. And so my work was basically killing dozens of planets,

1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:18.400
 thousands of times. I just ran thousands and thousands of body simulations.

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:19.600
 But you simulated this?

1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:24.960
 Yeah. So I simulated the star growing and just eating all these planets up and just

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:30.480
 absolute chaos. The orbits of the planets would change as the star loses mass. So you would have

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:36.320
 like Jupiter planets just crashing into the other planets, throwing them into the sun early.

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:43.360
 It was terrifying to watch these simulations. It was absolute carnage.

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:51.040
 But if you run thousands of these simulations, some systems find new balance ways of staying alive.

1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:58.880
 Some systems post star death find stable orbits again for billions of years,

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:05.040
 more than enough for life to originate again. And so that was my idea during that time that

1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:15.200
 thesis was trying to explore this notion of life coming back. And this idea of the universe

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:20.640
 doesn't care if you're here or not. And it will go about its business. Andromeda will crash into us

1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:28.080
 and doesn't care. No one cares if you're alive in the universe. And so letting go of that

1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:32.800
 preciousness of life, I found very useful at that stage of my career. And instead,

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:38.480
 I just thought, what if life is inevitable? It doesn't matter that it came by four billion

1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:44.560
 years ago. It can start again four billion years later. And maybe that is nice. Maybe that's where

1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:53.200
 hope lies, the phoenix rising everywhere, planets being destroyed and created. And we're here now.

1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:57.440
 And others will be more or less here ish billions of years later.

1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:04.800
 So accepting the cycle of death and life. And not taking it personally. Not taking it personally.

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:09.040
 The sun doesn't owe us anything. It's not a bad parent. It's not a parent at all.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:18.560
 Yeah. I was looking at the work of Freeman Dyson and seeing how this universe eventually will

1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:23.360
 just be a bunch of supermassive black holes before they also evaporate. A bunch of tiny

1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:28.960
 black holes too. Absolutely quiet. Everyone, all the black holes a little too far away from one

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:37.600
 another to even interact until it's just silence forever. But until then, many, many cycles of

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:44.800
 death and destruction and rebirth. And rebirth. You kept bringing up sort of coding stuff up.

1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:54.160
 I wanted to ask two things. First of all, what programming language do you like? And also, what

1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:01.760
 because you're as a computational quantum astrochemist? No.

1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:08.320
 No, that's correct. That's right. You're kind of, you could say you're

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:13.440
 actually understanding some exceptionally complicated things with one of the things

1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:19.440
 you're using is the tools of computation, of programming. Is there a device you can give to

1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:26.320
 people? Because I know quite a few that have not practiced that tool and have fallen in love with

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:31.680
 a particular science, whatever it's biology and chemistry and physics and so on. And if they

1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:37.680
 were interested in learning to program and learning to use computation as a tool in their

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:43.040
 particular science, is there advice you can give on programming and also just maybe a comment on

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:50.800
 your own journey and the use of programming in your own life? Well, I'm a terrible programmer.

1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:54.560
 A lot of scientists, the programming is bad because we never learned formal programming.

1:29:55.120 --> 1:30:01.040
 We learned science, physics, chemistry. And then we were told, oh, you have to get these

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:05.760
 equations modeled and run through a simulation. And you're like, oh, okay, so I'm going to learn

1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:11.840
 how to code to do this. And you learn just as much as you need to run these simulations and no more.

1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:16.320
 So they're rarely optimized. They're really clunky. Six months later, you can't read your own

1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:23.600
 code. My variable names are extremely embarrassing. I still have error messages for different

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:29.760
 compilation errors. I say things like, at least your dad loves you, Clara. You know,

1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:34.640
 it doesn't help me at all. So it's like humor. Yeah. Just like you suck at coding. But there's

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:40.080
 other things in your life. So I'm a bad programmer. And so if that will give hope to anyone else who's

1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:45.760
 a bad programmer, I can still do pretty impressive science. Yes. But I learned, I think I started

1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:51.840
 learning Matlab and Java when I was in college. It did me no good at all. It has not been particularly

1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:58.240
 useful. I learned some Fortran that was very useful, even though it's really not a fun language,

1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:04.800
 because so much of legacy code is in Fortran. And so if you want to use other people's code who

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:11.840
 have now retired, Fortran will be nice. And then I used IDL to visualize. So that simulation and

1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:17.040
 body simulation, that was all Fortran and IDL. But thankfully, since I've left college, I've

1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:23.360
 just learned Python like a normal person. And that has been much nicer. So most of my code now is in

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:29.360
 Python. I should also make a few quick comments as well. So one is you say you're sort of bad at

1:31:29.360 --> 1:31:36.560
 programming. I've worked with a lot of excellent scientists that are quote unquote, bad at programming.

1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:44.240
 They're not, it gets the job done. In fact, there's a downside to sort of especially getting a

1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:49.280
 software engineering education. If I were to give advice, especially if you're doing a computer

1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:53.840
 science degree and you're doing software engineering, is not to get lost in the,

1:31:53.840 --> 1:32:00.880
 in the, like optimization of the correct, there's an obsession, you can see it in like stack overflow

1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:09.120
 of the correct way to do things. And I think you can too easily get lost in constantly trying to

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:14.320
 optimize and do things the correct way when you actually never get done. The same thing happens,

1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:20.880
 you have like communities of people obsessed with productivity. And they keep researching

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:26.160
 productivity hacks, and then they spent like 90% plus of their time figuring out how to do things

1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:31.920
 productively, and they never actually do anything. So there's a certain sense if you focus on the

1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:38.560
 task that needs to be done, that's what programming is for. So not over optimizing, not, not focus,

1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:44.240
 not thinking about variable names in the, in the following sense. Sometimes you think, okay,

1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:49.920
 I'm going to write code that's going to last for decades. In reality, your code, if it's well

1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:55.280
 written or poorly written, will be very likely obsolete very quickly. And the point is to get

1:32:55.280 --> 1:33:00.640
 the job done really well. So there's a trade off there that you'll, you have to, you have to make

1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:07.680
 sure to strike. I should also comment as a public service announcement, or a request, if there's

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:13.360
 any world class Fortran or Cobalt programmers out there, I'm looking for them, I want to talk to

1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:18.080
 you. Because that will not be me. I'm a terrible Fortran programmer.

1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:23.440
 But it's fascinating because so much of the world in the past, and still runs programming

1:33:23.440 --> 1:33:29.920
 languages. And there's like no experts on it. So they're all retiring. Yeah. I, I disagree slightly

1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:34.800
 in that I think because I can get the job done, I'm a programmer. But because no one else can look

1:33:34.800 --> 1:33:40.160
 at my code and know how I got my job done, I'm a bad programmer. That's how I'm defining it.

1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:44.080
 Including yourself, including myself six months later, I'm working with a new student right now.

1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:50.720
 And she sent me some messages on Slack being like, what is this? What is this file that you've got

1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:58.080
 with some functions around? And I was like, I, I, this was from 2018. It wasn't that long ago.

1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:02.880
 And I can no longer remember what that code does. I'm going to spend now two days reading through

1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:09.600
 my own code and trying to improve it. And I do think that's frustrating. And so I think my advice

1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:17.040
 to any young people who want to get into astronomy or astrobiology or quantum chemistry

1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:23.520
 is that I certainly find it much easier to teach the science concepts to a programmer

1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:30.000
 than the programming to a scientist. And so I would much, much faster hire someone who knows

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:37.040
 programming but barely knows where space is than teach programming to an astronomer.

1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:41.520
 Oh, that's fascinating. Yeah. Okay. This is true. I mean, yeah, there's some basics.

1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:47.200
 I'm, I'm focusing too much on the silver lining because I have the people that were like MATLAB

1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:51.440
 code. Yeah. Single variable, single letter variable names, those kinds of things.

1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:57.760
 And it's accessibility, right? It's, I want my, my code to be open source. But, and it is,

1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:02.640
 it's on GitHub, anyone can download it. But is it really open source if it's written so cryptically,

1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:08.560
 so poorly that no one can really use it to its full functionality? Have I really published my work?

1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:14.960
 And that weighs on, on me. I feel guilty for my own inadequacies as a programmer.

1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:20.960
 You can only do so much. I've already learned quantum chemistry and astrophysics. So, you know.

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:28.160
 Yeah. I mean, there's, there's, there's all kinds of ways to contribute to the world. One of them

1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:33.120
 is publication, but publishing code is, is a fascinating way to contribute to the world,

1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:41.200
 even if it's very small, very basic element, great code. I guess I was also kind of criticizing the

1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:48.240
 software engineering process versus like, which is a good thing to do is code that's readable,

1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.760
 almost like without documentation. It's readable. It's understandable. The variable names, the

1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:59.760
 structure, all those kinds of things. And that's the dream. That's the dream. This is a dumb question.

1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:03.360
 No, I'll tell you a dumb question. I want to hear it.

1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:09.760
 Okay. I mean, okay. This is the question about beauty. It's way too general. It's very impossible.

1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:13.600
 It's like asking, what's your favorite band? What's your favorite music band?

1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:16.800
 Oh, I thought you meant wavelength band. I was like, I definitely have favorite wavelength bands.

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:20.240
 Absolutely. Well, it's hard to narrow down. Okay.

1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:25.440
 Okay. What, what do you use the most beautiful idea in science?

1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:29.440
 It's not a dumb question. Do you want to try that question again, proudly?

1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:34.720
 Okay. I have a really good question to ask you.

1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:40.000
 Okay. Don't, don't oversell it. I've got an okay question to ask you, you know?

1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:48.640
 I've, yeah. What, what do you, is the most beautiful idea in, in science, something you

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:56.800
 just find inspiring or just maybe the reason you got into science or the reason you think science is

1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:05.520
 cool? My favorite thing about science is kind of the connection between the scales. So

1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:11.520
 when I was little and I wanted to know about space, I really felt that it would make me feel

1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:16.560
 powerful to be able to predict the heavens, something so much larger than myself

1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:23.280
 that felt really powerful. It was almost a selfish desire. And that's what I wanted.

1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:28.240
 There was some control to being able to know exactly what the sky would do.

1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:34.000
 And then as I got older and I got more into astronomy and I didn't just want to know how

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.960
 the stars moved. I wanted to know how the planets around them moved. And,

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:41.760
 and then as I got deeper into that field, I really didn't care that much about the planets.

1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:45.440
 I want to know about the atmospheres around the planets and then the molecules within those

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:52.720
 atmospheres and what that might mean. So I ended up shrinking my scale until it was literally the

1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:58.960
 quantum scale. And now all my work, the majority of my work is on this insane quantum scale.

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:09.120
 And yet I'm using these literal tiny, tiny tools to try and answer the greatest questions

1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:16.320
 that we've ever been able to ask. And this crossing of scales from the quantum to the

1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:20.560
 astronomical. That's so cool, isn't it?

1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:26.240
 Yeah. It spans the entirety, the tiny and the huge. That's the cool thing about, I guess,

1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:33.600
 being a quantum astrochemist is you're using the tools of the tiny to look at the heavenly bodies,

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:40.400
 the giant stuff. And the potential life out there, that this is the thing that connects us,

1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:44.720
 that you can't escape the rules of the quantum world and how universal they themselves are,

1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:53.680
 despite being probabilistic. And that makes me feel really pleased to be in science,

1:38:53.680 --> 1:39:02.720
 but in a really humbling way. It's no longer this thirst for power. I feel less special the

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:08.000
 more work I do, less exceptional the more work I do. I feel like humans in the earth and our

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:15.120
 place in the universe is less and less exceptional. And yet I feel so much less lonely. And so it's

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:18.720
 been a really good trade off that I've lost power, but I've gained company.

1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:23.680
 Wow, that's a beautiful answer. I don't think there's a better way to actually end it. You're

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:28.640
 right. I asked a mediocre question and you came through, you made the question good

1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:38.640
 by a brilliant answer. You're the Michael Jordan and I'll be the Dennis Rodman.

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:43.200
 I don't know enough about basketball. I mean, literally you've reached the peak of my basketball

1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:48.400
 knowledge because I know though those people are basketball pros, I believe, but only because

1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:54.960
 I watch Space Jam, I think. Are there books or movies in your life long ago or recently?

1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:00.960
 Do you have any time for books and movies? Had an impact on you? What ideas did you take away?

1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:07.920
 I absolutely have time for books and movies. I try as best I can to not work very hard.

1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:15.680
 I mostly fail, I should point out. But I think I'm a better scientist when I don't work evenings

1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:22.480
 and weekends. If I get four good hours in a day, I often don't. I often get eight crappy hours,

1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:31.040
 emails, meetings, bad code, data processing. But if I can get four high quality scientific hours,

1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:35.600
 I just stop working for the day because I know it's diminishing returns after that.

1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:39.200
 So I have a lot of time. I try to make as much time as I can.

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:51.120
 Can you dig into what it takes to be one productive, two to be happy as a researcher?

1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:57.920
 Because I think it's too easy in that world to basic, because you have so many hats,

1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:04.160
 you have to wear so many jobs, you have to be a mentor, a teacher, head of a research group,

1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:09.120
 do research yourself, you have to do service, all the kinds of stuff you're doing now with

1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:20.000
 education and interviews. Yeah. So as a public science, like being a public communicator,

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.600
 that's a job. Yeah. The whole thing. It's very poorly.

1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:29.920
 I'll pay you in Bitcoin. Okay. I'll take Bitcoin.

1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:41.840
 So is there some advice you can give to the process of being productive and happy as a researcher?

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:47.200
 I think sadly, it's very hard to feel happy as a scientist if you're not productive.

1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:53.200
 It's a bit of a trap, but I certainly find it very difficult to feel happy when I'm not being

1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:58.560
 productive. It's become slightly better if I know my students are being productive,

1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:04.880
 I can be happy. But I think a lot of senior scientists, once they get into that mindset,

1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:08.880
 they start thinking that their student science is theirs. And I think this happens a lot of

1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:14.240
 senior scientists. They have so many hats, as you mentioned, they have to do so much service

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:19.440
 and so much admin that they have very little time for their own science. And so they end up

1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:25.040
 feeling ownership over the junior people in their labs and their groups. And that's really

1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:34.000
 heartbreaking. I see it all the time. And that I think I've escaped that trap. I feel so happy,

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:39.520
 even when I'm not productive, when my students are productive. I think that sensation I was

1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:47.200
 describing earlier, they only need to be half as productive as me for me to feel like I've done

1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:56.080
 my job for humanity. So that has been the dynamic I've had to worry about. But to be productive

1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:00.960
 is not clear to me what you have to do. You have to not be miserable otherwise. I find it extremely

1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:07.600
 hard when I'm having conflicts with collaborators, for example, kind of very hard to enjoy the work

1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:13.360
 we do, even if the work is this fantastical phosphine or things that I know I love,

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:20.800
 still very difficult. So I think choosing your collaborators based on how well you get along

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:28.480
 with them is a really sound scientific choice. Having a miserable collaborator ruins your whole

1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:34.000
 life. It's horrible. It makes you not want to do the science. It probably makes you do clumsy

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.080
 science because you don't focus on it. You don't go over it several times. You just want it to be

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:47.600
 over. And so I think in general, just not being a douchebag can get so much good science done.

1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:52.000
 Just find the good people in your community and collaborate with them. Even if they're not as

1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.960
 good scientists as others, you'll get better science out. Yeah, don't be a douchebag yourself

1:43:56.960 --> 1:44:02.240
 and surround yourself by other cool people. Exactly. And then you'll get better science.

1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:07.200
 And if you would try to work with three geniuses who are just hell to be around.

1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:15.200
 Yeah. I mean, there's parallel things like that. I'm very fortunate now. I was very

1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:19.440
 fortunate at MIT to have friends and colleagues there. They were incredible to work with.

1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:25.280
 But I'm currently sort of, I'm doing a lot of fun stuff on the side,

1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:34.000
 like this little podcast thing. And I mentioned to you, I think robotics related stuff.

1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:42.000
 I was just at Boston Dynamics yesterday checking out their robots. And I'm currently,

1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:46.960
 I guess, hiring people to help me with a very fun little project around those robots.

1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:52.880
 Want to put an ad in? No. I have more applications I can possibly deal with. There's thousands.

1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:59.520
 So it's not an ad. It's the opposite. We need to put an ad out for someone to help

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:04.400
 you go through the applications. Well, that too is already there. That's over 10,000 people applied

1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:12.160
 for that. An infinite master of application management. But the point is, it's not exactly,

1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:21.520
 the point is like what I'm very distinctly aware of is life is short and productivity

1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:27.760
 is not the right goal to optimize for, at least for me. The right goal to optimize for

1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:33.760
 is how happy you are to wake up in the day and to work with the people that you do.

1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:36.480
 Because the productivity will take care of itself. Agreed.

1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:44.000
 And so it's so important to select the people well. And I think one of the challenges with

1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:50.320
 academia as opposed to the sort of thing I'm currently doing is saying goodbye is sometimes

1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:58.880
 a little bit tougher because your colleagues are there. I mean, goodbye hurts. And then if you

1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:03.360
 have to spend the rest for many years to come, still surrounded by them in the community,

1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.720
 it's tougher. It kind of adds, puts extra pressure to stay in that relationship,

1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:16.560
 in that collaboration. And in some sense, that makes it much more difficult, but it's still

1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:25.040
 worth it. It's still worth it to break ties. If you're not happy, if there's not that magic,

1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:33.360
 that dance. I talked to this guy named Daniel Kahneman. Oh, I know. Danny Kahneman. Danny, yeah.

1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:41.520
 Boy, did that guy make me realize what a great collaborator is. Well, he had Tversky, right?

1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:48.400
 Yeah. But they had, obviously, they had a really deep collaboration there. But I collaborated

1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:53.520
 with him on a conversation, just like talking about, I don't know what we're talking about.

1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:59.440
 I think cars, autonomous vehicles. But the brainstorming session, I'm like a nobody. And

1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:04.240
 the fact that he would, with that childlike curiosity, and that dance of thoughts and ideas,

1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:10.720
 and the push and pull, and the lack of ego, but then enough ego to have a little bit of a stubbornness

1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:16.320
 over an idea, and a little bit of humor, and all those things. It's like, holy shit, that person,

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:22.080
 also the ability to truly listen to another human. It's like, okay, that's what it takes to be a good

1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:27.600
 collaborator. It makes me realize that I haven't been, I've been very fortunate to have cool people

1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:32.720
 in my life, but there's like levels even to the cool. Yeah, I don't think you can compete with

1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:39.600
 Danny Kahneman on cool. He's just incredible. But it was like, okay, I guess what I'm trying to say

1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:44.720
 is that collaboration is an art form. But perhaps it's actually a skill, is allowing yourself

1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:49.680
 to develop that skill, because that's one of the fruitful skills.

1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:57.360
 And praise it in students. And I think it is something you can really improve on. I've become a

1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:03.120
 better collaborator as the years have gone on. I don't have some innate collaborative skills.

1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:06.560
 I think they're skills I've developed. And I think in science, there's this

1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:14.240
 really destructive notion of the lone wolf, the scientist who sees things where others don't.

1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:19.200
 Then that's really appealing. And people really like either fulfilling that or pretending to

1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:27.280
 be fulfilling that. And first of all, it's mostly a lie. Any modern scientist, particularly in astronomy,

1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:32.880
 which is so interdisciplinary, any modern scientist as doing it on their own is doing a crappy job,

1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:39.200
 most likely. Because you need an independent set of eyes to help you do things. You need

1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:44.960
 experts in the subfields that you're working on to check your work. But most importantly,

1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:53.360
 it's just a bad idea. It doesn't lead to good science, and it leaves you miserable.

1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:59.520
 I recently had some work that I was avoiding, and I thought, maybe I should pursue this scientific

1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:04.160
 project, because I don't care enough about the outcome, and it's going to be a lot of hard work.

1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:08.400
 And I was trying to balance these two things. It's really difficult, and the outcome is that

1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:13.520
 maybe 10 people will cite me in the next decade, because it's not. No one's asking for this question

1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:21.360
 to be answered. And then I found myself working with this collaborator, Jason Dipman. And I spent

1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:29.120
 a whole afternoon, hours with him working on this, and time flew by, and I just felt taller, and

1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:35.200
 like I could breathe better. I was happier. I was a better person when it was done. And

1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:42.160
 that's because he's a great collaborator. He's just a wonderful person that brings out joy out

1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:47.520
 of science that you're doing with him. And that's really the trick. You find the people

1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:54.160
 that make you feel that way about the science you're doing, and you stop worrying about being

1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:59.040
 the lone wolf. That's just a terrible dream that will leave you miserable, and your science will

1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:07.520
 be shit. And since I'm Russian, just murder anybody who doesn't fall into that beautiful

1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:14.480
 collaborative relationship. We were talking about books. Books, yes. Is there books, movies?

1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:18.560
 Why was I talking about my productivity? Oh, you said you maybe don't have time for books and

1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:24.960
 movies. And you said you must make time for books and movies. Make time to not work. Make time to

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:33.280
 not work, whatever that looks like to you. But there's plenty. When I was younger, I found a lot

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:39.760
 of my scientific fulfillment in books and movies. Now as I got older, I have plenty of that in my

1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:45.600
 work. And I try to read outside my field. I read about Danny Kahneman's work instead.

1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:55.520
 But when I was little, it was contact, the book, the Carl Sagan book. I really thought I was just

1:50:55.520 --> 1:51:03.840
 like Ellie. And I was going to become Ellie. I really resonated with me, their character and the

1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:12.480
 notions of life and space in the universe. Even the idea of then the movie came out and I got to put

1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:21.920
 Jodie Foster in that, which helped. But even the notion of if it is just us, what an awful waste

1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:29.360
 of space. I found extremely useful as a concept to think. Maybe we are special, but that would suck

1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:34.400
 is a really nice way of thinking of the search for life, that it's much better to not be special

1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:40.960
 and have company. I got that from Carl Sagan. So that's where I always recommend.

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:49.920
 Let me ask one other ridiculous question. We talked about the death and life cycle

1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:55.680
 that is ever present in the universe until it's not, until it's supermassive and little black

1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:02.560
 holes too at the end of the universe. What do you think is the why, the meaning of it all?

1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:10.240
 What do you think is the meaning of life here on earth and the meaning of that life that you look

1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:17.520
 for, whether it's on Venus or other exoplanets? I think there's none. I find enormous relief

1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:24.640
 in the absence of meaning. I think chasing for meaning is a human desire that the universe

1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:33.200
 doesn't give two shits about. But you still enjoy... I enjoy finding meaning in my life.

1:52:33.200 --> 1:52:42.480
 I enjoy finding where the morality lies. I enjoy the complication of that desire

1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:49.040
 here, and I feel that is deeply human, but I don't feel that it's universal.

1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:56.240
 It's somehow absolute. We conjure it up. We bring it to life through our own minds,

1:52:56.240 --> 1:53:04.160
 but it's not any kind of fundamental way real. No. And the same way the sun is not to be blamed

1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:12.560
 for destroying its own planets, the universe doesn't care because it has no meaning. It

1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:19.040
 owes us nothing. And looking for meaning in the universe is demanding answers. Who are we? We're

1:53:19.040 --> 1:53:25.200
 nothing. We don't get to demand anything, and that includes meaning. And I find it very reassuring

1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:35.920
 because once there is no meaning, I don't have to find it. Yeah. Once there's no meaning, it's a

1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:43.040
 kind of freedom in a way. You sound a bit like... I'm happy about it. This isn't a depressing outlook

1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:47.680
 as far as I'm concerned. It's happiness. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, there's, I don't know if you know

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:55.120
 who Sam Harris is, but he, despite the pushbacks from the entirety of the world, really argues

1:53:55.120 --> 1:54:02.800
 hard that there's that free will as an illusion, that the deterministic universe and it's all

1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:10.320
 already been predetermined, and he's okay with it. And he's happy with it, that he's distinctly

1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:16.400
 aware of it. The quantum world will disagree with him on the deterministic nature of nature.

1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:22.480
 Well, he's not saying it's deterministic, but he's saying that the randomness doesn't

1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:30.400
 help either. Like, randomness does not help in the experience of feeling like you're the

1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:37.040
 decider of your own actions. That he kind of is okay with being a leaf flowing on the river,

1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:42.880
 like, or being the river, right, as opposed to having or being like a fish or something,

1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:48.800
 they can decide its swimming direction. He's okay just embracing the flow of life. I mean,

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:55.760
 that same way, it kind of sounds like your conception of meaning. I mean, it just is,

1:54:55.760 --> 1:55:01.760
 it doesn't, the universe doesn't care. It just is what it is and we experience certain things

1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:09.840
 and some feel good and some don't. And that's life. But I don't feel like that about life.

1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:15.120
 I think life does have meaning and there's, and it's laudable to look for that meaning in life.

1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:22.240
 I just don't think you can apply that beyond life and certainly not beyond Earth, that this

1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:32.080
 notion of meaning is a human construct. And so it only applies within us and the other life forms

1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:42.720
 and planet types that suffer from our intrusions or rejoice from our interactions. But this meaning

1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:48.560
 is ours to do as we please. We've created it. We've created a need for it. And so that's our problem

1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:53.360
 to solve. I don't apply it beyond us. I think we as humans have a lot of responsibilities,

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:57.920
 but they're moral responsibilities. And a lot of those responsibilities are much more easily

1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:03.600
 fulfilled if you find meaning in them. So I think there's value to meaning, whether it's real or not.

1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:11.760
 I just think we gain nothing from trying to anthropomorphize the entire universe. And also,

1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:14.480
 that's the height of hubris. That's not for us to do.

1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:21.680
 Yeah, it also could be just like duality in quantum mechanics. It could be both

1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:28.560
 that there is meaning and then there isn't. And we're somehow depending on the observer,

1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:33.200
 depending on the perspective you take on the thing.

1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:39.360
 I mean, even on Earth, that's true. Whether things have meaning or not depends a lot on who's looking.

1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:48.480
 Whether it's us humans, the aliens, or the giraffes. Clara, this was an incredible conversation.

1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:54.800
 I mean, I learned so much, but I also am just inspired by the passion you have.

1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:02.480
 Not finding meaning in the universe. I'm very passionate about not finding meaning in the

1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:07.120
 universe. You're the most inspiring nihilist I've ever met. I'm just kidding.

1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:13.920
 I mean, you are truly an inspiring communicator of everything from

1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:21.760
 phosphine to life to quantum astral chemistry. I can't wait to see what other cool things you do

1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:27.520
 in your career, in your scientific life. Thank you so much for wasting your valuable time with

1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:32.160
 me today. I really appreciate it. It was my pleasure. I had already got my four hours of

1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:37.360
 productivity before I got here and so it's not a waste. It's all downhill from there. Thank you.

1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:42.320
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Clara Sousa Silva and thank you to

1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:48.800
 On It, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed. Check them out in the description to support

1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:53.360
 this podcast. And now let me leave you some words from Konstantin Zilkovsky.

1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:59.120
 The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.

1:57:59.120 --> 1:58:03.120
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
