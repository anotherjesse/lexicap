00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
 If one site is hacked, you can just unleash all health.

00:03.520 --> 00:08.960
 We have stumbled into this new era of mutually assured digital distraction.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.120
 How far are people willing to go?

00:11.120 --> 00:16.960
 And you can capture their location, you can capture their contacts that record their

00:16.960 --> 00:20.160
 telephone calls, record their camera without them knowing about it.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.920
 Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet on someone without them knowing.

00:25.920 --> 00:31.600
 You could sell that to a zero day broker for two million dollars.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.200
 The following is a conversation with Nicole Pearlroth,

00:37.200 --> 00:42.400
 cybersecurity journalist and author of This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,

00:42.400 --> 00:44.000
 The Cyber Weapons Arm Race.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.800
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.240
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.000
 And now, dear friends, here's Nicole Pearlroth.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.160
 You've interviewed hundreds of cybersecurity hackers, activists, dissidents, computer

01:00.160 --> 01:05.520
 scientists, government officials, forensic investigators, and mercenaries.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.800
 So let's talk about cybersecurity and cyber war.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.400
 Start with the basics.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.480
 What is a zero day vulnerability and then a zero day exploit or attack?

01:16.480 --> 01:27.440
 So, at the most basic level, let's say I'm a hacker and I find a bug in your iPhone iOS

01:27.440 --> 01:30.480
 software that no one else knows about, especially Apple.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.240
 That's called a zero day because the minute it's discovered,

01:34.240 --> 01:36.240
 engineers have had zero days to fix it.

01:37.600 --> 01:44.000
 If I can study that zero day, I could potentially write a program to exploit it.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.280
 And that program would be called a zero day exploit.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.360
 And for iOS, the dream is that you craft a zero day exploit that can remotely exploit

01:55.360 --> 01:58.720
 someone else's iPhone without them ever knowing about it.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.040
 And you can capture their location.

02:01.040 --> 02:07.120
 You can capture their contacts that record their telephone calls, record their camera

02:07.120 --> 02:08.320
 without them knowing about it.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.920
 Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet on someone with a

02:13.920 --> 02:14.880
 phone without them knowing.

02:14.880 --> 02:19.680
 And you can see why that capability, that zero day exploit, would have immense value

02:20.400 --> 02:26.880
 for a spy agency or a government that wants to monitor its critics or dissidents.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.920
 And so there's a very lucrative market now for zero day exploits.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.280
 So you said a few things there.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.720
 One is iOS.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.080
 Why iOS?

02:36.080 --> 02:37.520
 Which operating system?

02:37.520 --> 02:41.600
 Which one is the sexier thing to try to get to or the most impactful thing?

02:41.600 --> 02:47.520
 And the other thing you mentioned is remote versus like having to actually come in physical

02:47.520 --> 02:48.480
 contact with it.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.520
 Is that the distinction?

02:50.160 --> 02:56.960
 So iPhone exploits have just been a government's number one priority.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.720
 Recently, actually the price of an Android remote zero day exploit,

03:02.720 --> 03:07.280
 something that can get you into Android phones, is actually higher.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.840
 The value of that is now higher on this underground market for zero day exploits

03:12.400 --> 03:14.640
 than an iPhone iOS exploit.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.560
 So things are changing.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.840
 So there's probably more Android devices.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.960
 So that's why it's better.

03:21.520 --> 03:27.200
 But on the iPhone side, I'm an Android person because I'm a man of the people.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.960
 But it seems like all the elites use iPhone, all the people at nice dinner parties.

03:32.960 --> 03:38.000
 So is that the reason that the more powerful people use iPhones?

03:38.000 --> 03:38.640
 Is that why?

03:38.640 --> 03:39.680
 I don't think so.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.520
 I actually, so it was about two years ago that the price has flipped.

03:43.520 --> 03:52.560
 It used to be that if you could craft a remote zero click exploit for iOS,

03:53.200 --> 03:55.280
 then that was about as good as it gets.

03:55.280 --> 04:00.480
 You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.

04:00.480 --> 04:05.760
 The caveat is you can never tell anyone about it, because the minute you tell someone about it,

04:05.760 --> 04:12.400
 Apple learns about it, they patch it in that $2.5 million investment that that zero day broker

04:12.400 --> 04:13.840
 just made goes to dust.

04:14.800 --> 04:23.680
 So a couple years ago, and don't quote me on the prices, but an Android zero click remote

04:23.680 --> 04:30.720
 exploit for the first time topped the iOS. And actually, a lot of people's read on that

04:31.360 --> 04:41.840
 was that it might be a sign that Apple security was falling and that it might actually be easier

04:41.840 --> 04:48.160
 to find an iOS zero day exploit than find an Android zero day exploit.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.760
 The other thing is market share.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.840
 There are just more people around the world that use Android.

04:54.640 --> 05:00.400
 And a lot of governments that are paying top dollar for zero day exploits these days

05:01.280 --> 05:07.680
 are deep pocketed governments in the Gulf that want to use these exploits to monitor

05:07.680 --> 05:10.080
 their own citizens, monitor their critics.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.760
 And so it's not necessarily that they're trying to find elites.

05:14.480 --> 05:19.120
 It's that they want to find out who these people are that are criticizing them or perhaps

05:19.120 --> 05:20.400
 planning the next Arab Spring.

05:21.040 --> 05:26.400
 So in your experience, are most of these attacks targeted to cover a large population

05:26.400 --> 05:30.320
 or is there attacks that are targeted towards specific individuals?

05:31.120 --> 05:32.160
 So I think it's both.

05:32.720 --> 05:38.320
 Some of the zero day exploits that have fetched top dollar that I've heard of in my reporting in

05:38.320 --> 05:40.400
 the United States were highly targeted.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.440
 There was a potential terrorist attack.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.280
 They wanted to get into this person's phone.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.920
 It had to be done in the next 24 hours.

05:47.920 --> 05:52.800
 They approached hackers and say, we'll pay you X millions of dollars if you can do this.

05:53.600 --> 05:59.760
 But then you look at when we've discovered iOS zero day exploits in the wild,

06:00.640 --> 06:04.240
 some of them have been targeting large populations like Uighurs.

06:05.200 --> 06:10.080
 So a couple of years ago, there was a watering hole attack.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.000
 Okay, what's a watering hole attack?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.120
 There's a website.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.960
 It was actually had information aimed at Uighurs.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.160
 Uighurs and you could access it all over the world.

06:20.880 --> 06:28.560
 And if you visited this website, it would drop an iOS zero day exploit onto your phone.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.320
 And so anyone that visited this website that was about Uighurs anywhere,

06:34.320 --> 06:40.480
 I mean Uighurs, Uighurs living abroad, basically the Uighur diaspora would have

06:40.480 --> 06:43.840
 gotten infected with this zero day exploit.

06:43.840 --> 06:50.560
 So in that case, they were targeting huge swaths of this one population

06:50.560 --> 06:54.400
 or people interested in this one population basically in real time.

06:57.120 --> 07:02.000
 Who are these attackers from the individual level to the group level?

07:02.640 --> 07:05.040
 Psychologically speaking, what's their motivation?

07:05.040 --> 07:06.400
 Is it purely money?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.480
 Is it the challenge?

07:09.120 --> 07:10.480
 Are they malevolent?

07:10.480 --> 07:11.280
 Is it power?

07:11.280 --> 07:15.280
 Or these are big philosophical human questions, I guess.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.440
 So these are the questions I set out to answer for my book.

07:20.240 --> 07:25.200
 I wanted to know, are these people that are just after money?

07:26.720 --> 07:29.600
 If they're just after money, how do they sleep at night?

07:29.600 --> 07:34.000
 Not knowing whether that zero day exploit they just sold to a broker is being used

07:34.560 --> 07:36.880
 to basically make someone's life a living hell.

07:36.880 --> 07:42.640
 And what I found was there's kind of this long sordid history to this question.

07:43.600 --> 07:51.120
 It started out in the 80s and 90s when hackers were just finding holes and bugs in software

07:51.120 --> 07:56.800
 for curiosity's sake, really as a hobby, and some of them would go to the tech companies

07:56.800 --> 08:00.880
 like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems at the time or Oracle.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.480
 And they'd say, hey, I just found this zero day in your software and I can use it to break

08:06.480 --> 08:07.200
 into NASA.

08:08.080 --> 08:13.840
 And the general response at the time wasn't, thank you so much for pointing out this flaw

08:13.840 --> 08:16.560
 and our software will get it fixed as soon as possible.

08:17.200 --> 08:23.120
 It was, don't ever poke around our software ever again or we'll stick our general counsel on you.

08:24.080 --> 08:29.280
 And that was really sort of the common thread for years.

08:29.280 --> 08:37.200
 And so hackers who set out to do the right thing were basically told to shut up and stop

08:37.200 --> 08:38.240
 doing what you're doing.

08:39.280 --> 08:45.280
 And what happened next was they basically started trading this information online.

08:45.280 --> 08:51.040
 Now, when you go back and interview people from those early days, they all tell a very

08:51.040 --> 08:56.000
 similar story, which is they're curious, they're tinkers.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.880
 They remind me of like the kid down the block that was constantly poking around the hood

09:00.880 --> 09:01.920
 of his dad's car.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.720
 They just couldn't help themselves.

09:04.720 --> 09:10.400
 They wanted to figure out how a system is designed and how they could potentially exploit

09:10.400 --> 09:11.840
 it for some other purpose.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.440
 It doesn't have to be good or bad.

09:14.400 --> 09:22.320
 But they were basically kind of beat down for so long by these big tech companies that

09:22.320 --> 09:26.800
 they started just silently trading them with other hackers.

09:26.800 --> 09:33.760
 And that's how you got these really heated debates in the 90s about disclosure.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.600
 Should you just dump these things online because any script kitty can pick them up and use it

09:39.600 --> 09:40.960
 for all kinds of mischief.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.320
 But, you know, don't you want to just stick a middle finger to all these companies that are

09:46.320 --> 09:48.000
 basically threatening you all the time.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.400
 So there was this really interesting dynamic at play and what I learned in the course of

09:54.400 --> 10:01.280
 doing my book was that government agencies and their contractors sort of tapped into

10:01.280 --> 10:03.760
 that frustration and that resentment.

10:03.760 --> 10:10.240
 And they started quietly reaching out to hackers on these forums and they said, hey,

10:10.240 --> 10:12.800
 you know that zero day you just dropped online.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.520
 Could you could you come up with something custom for me?

10:15.520 --> 10:18.080
 And I'll pay you six figures for it.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.440
 So long as you shut up and never tell anyone that we that I paid you for this and that's

10:23.440 --> 10:24.480
 what happened.

10:24.480 --> 10:30.560
 So throughout the 90s, there was a bunch of boutique contractors that started reaching

10:30.560 --> 10:35.760
 out to hackers on these forums and saying, hey, I'll pay you six figures for that bug.

10:35.760 --> 10:41.840
 You were trying to get Microsoft to fix for free and sort of so began or so catalyzed

10:41.840 --> 10:48.640
 this market where governments and their intermediaries started reaching out to these hackers and

10:48.640 --> 10:50.560
 buying their bugs for free.

10:50.560 --> 10:55.360
 And in those early days, I think a lot of it was just for quiet counterintelligence,

10:55.360 --> 10:57.120
 traditional espionage.

10:57.760 --> 11:05.120
 But as we started baking the software, Windows software, Schneider Electric,

11:05.120 --> 11:14.800
 Siemens industrial software into our nuclear plants and our factories and our power grid

11:14.800 --> 11:22.000
 and our petrochemical facilities and our pipelines, those same zero days came to be just as valuable

11:22.000 --> 11:24.240
 for sabotage and war planning.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.880
 Does the fact that the market sprung up and you cannot make a lot of money change the

11:28.880 --> 11:33.760
 nature of the attackers that came to the table or grow the number of attackers?

11:33.760 --> 11:41.680
 I mean, what is, I guess you told the psychology of the hackers in the 90s, what is the culture

11:41.680 --> 11:43.520
 today and where is it heading?

11:43.520 --> 11:49.280
 So I think there are people who will tell you they would never sell a zero day to a

11:49.280 --> 11:51.120
 zero day broker or a government.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.920
 One, because they don't know how it's going to get used when they throw it over the fence.

11:55.920 --> 12:00.160
 You know, most of these get rolled into classified programs and you don't know how they get used.

12:00.160 --> 12:05.280
 If you sell it to a zero day broker, you don't even know which nation state might use it

12:06.720 --> 12:10.400
 or potentially which criminal group might use it if you sell it on the dark web.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.640
 The other thing that they say is that they want to be able to sleep at night.

12:17.840 --> 12:22.800
 And they lose a lot of sleep if they found out their zero day was being used to, you know,

12:22.800 --> 12:24.560
 make a dissident's life living hell.

12:24.560 --> 12:30.560
 But there are a lot of people, good people who also say, no, this is not my problem.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.520
 This is the technology company's problem.

12:34.080 --> 12:39.040
 If they weren't writing new bugs into their software every day, then there wouldn't be a market.

12:39.040 --> 12:43.840
 You know, then there wouldn't be a problem, but they continue to write bugs into their

12:43.840 --> 12:46.960
 software all the time and they continue to profit off that software.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.120
 So why shouldn't I profit off my labor too?

12:51.120 --> 12:56.480
 And one of the things that has happened, which is I think a positive development over the last

12:56.480 --> 13:03.040
 10 years, are bug bounty programs, you know, companies like Google and Facebook and then

13:03.040 --> 13:08.720
 Microsoft and finally Apple, which resisted it for a really long time, have said, okay,

13:09.680 --> 13:13.280
 we are going to shift our perspective about hackers.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.240
 We're no longer going to treat them as the enemy here.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.680
 We're going to start paying them for what it's essential to do.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.720
 Paying them for what it's essentially free quality assurance.

13:23.680 --> 13:28.720
 And we're going to pay them good money in some cases, you know, six figures in some cases.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.920
 We're never going to be able to bid against a zero day broker who sells to government agencies,

13:34.560 --> 13:40.240
 but we can reward them and hopefully get that to that bug earlier where we can neutralize it

13:40.800 --> 13:44.640
 so that they don't have to spend another year developing the zero day exploit.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.440
 And in that way, we can keep our software more secure.

13:47.440 --> 13:54.720
 But every week I get messages from some hacker that says, you know, I tried to see this zero day

13:54.720 --> 13:59.120
 exploit that was just found in the wild, you know, being used by this nation state.

13:59.600 --> 14:05.360
 I tried to tell Microsoft about this two years ago and they were going to pay me peanuts.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.360
 So it never got fixed.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.120
 You know, there are all sorts of those stories that can continue on.

14:11.120 --> 14:18.400
 And, you know, I think just generally hackers are not very good at diplomacy, you know,

14:18.400 --> 14:26.560
 they tend to be pretty snipey, technical, crowd and very philosophical in my experience.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.680
 But, you know, diplomacy is not their strong suit.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.080
 Well, there almost has to be a broker between companies and hackers.

14:34.640 --> 14:39.760
 We can translate effectively just like you have a zero day broker between governments and hackers.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.360
 Yeah.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.040
 Because you have to speak their language.

14:43.040 --> 14:43.600
 Yeah.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.680
 And there have been some of those companies who've risen up to meet that demand.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.240
 And Hacker One is one of them.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.600
 Bug Crowd is another.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.160
 CINAC has an interesting model.

14:54.160 --> 14:59.680
 So that's a company that you pay for a private bug bounty program, essentially.

14:59.680 --> 15:05.920
 So you pay this company, they tap hackers all over the world to come hack your software,

15:05.920 --> 15:10.080
 hack your system, and then they'll quietly tell you what they found.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.600
 And I think that's a really positive development.

15:13.600 --> 15:19.120
 And actually, the Department of Defense hired all three of those companies,

15:19.120 --> 15:21.920
 I just mentioned, to help secure their systems.

15:21.920 --> 15:26.800
 Now, I think they're still a little timid in terms of letting those hackers into the really

15:26.800 --> 15:31.680
 sensitive, high side classified stuff, but, you know, baby steps.

15:31.680 --> 15:37.840
 Just to understand what you were saying, you think it's impossible for companies to

15:37.840 --> 15:41.120
 financially compete with the zero day brokers with governments,

15:41.840 --> 15:47.600
 so like the defense can't outpay the hackers?

15:47.600 --> 15:48.320
 It's interesting.

15:48.320 --> 15:55.280
 You know, they shouldn't outpay them because what would happen if they started offering

15:55.280 --> 16:03.920
 $2.5 million at Apple for any zero day exploit that governments would pay that much for

16:04.640 --> 16:09.520
 is their own engineers would say, why the hell am I working for less than that

16:10.160 --> 16:12.320
 and doing my nine to five every day?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.560
 So you would create a perverse incentive.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.040
 And I didn't think about that until I started this research and I realized,

16:19.040 --> 16:20.400
 okay, yeah, that makes sense.

16:20.400 --> 16:26.720
 You don't want to incentivize offense so much that it's to your own detriment.

16:27.360 --> 16:31.760
 And so I think what they have though, what the companies have on government agencies

16:32.560 --> 16:35.920
 is if they pay you, you get to talk about it.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.000
 You know, you get the street cred.

16:38.000 --> 16:44.080
 You get to brag about the fact you just found that $2.5 million, you know,

16:44.080 --> 16:46.240
 iOS zero day that no one else did.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.920
 And if you sell it to a broker, you never get to talk about it.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.840
 And I think that really does eat at people.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.080
 Can I ask you a big philosophical question about human nature here?

16:57.120 --> 17:03.280
 So if you have in what you've seen, if a human being has a zero day,

17:03.280 --> 17:09.680
 they found a zero day vulnerability that can hack into, I don't know,

17:09.680 --> 17:13.680
 what's the worst thing you can hack into something that could launch nuclear weapons.

17:14.880 --> 17:19.360
 Which percentage of the people in the world that have the skill would not share that with

17:19.360 --> 17:22.400
 anyone with any bad party.

17:23.280 --> 17:31.680
 I guess how many people are completely devoid of ethical concerns in your sense?

17:31.680 --> 17:38.400
 So my belief is all the ultra competent people or very, very high percentage of

17:38.400 --> 17:40.640
 ultra competent people are also ethical people.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.800
 That's been my experience.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.880
 But then again, my experience is narrow.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.560
 What's your experience been like?

17:48.560 --> 17:52.240
 So this was another question I wanted to answer.

17:53.600 --> 17:58.720
 Who are these people who would sell a zero day exploit that would neutralize

17:59.440 --> 18:03.040
 a Schneider electric safety lock at a petrochemical plant?

18:03.040 --> 18:07.360
 Basically the last thing you would need to neutralize before you trigger some kind of explosion.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.800
 Who would sell that?

18:11.280 --> 18:13.440
 And I got my answer.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.720
 Well, the answer was different.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.880
 A lot of people said, I would never even look there because I don't even want to know.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.880
 I don't even want to have that capability.

18:23.520 --> 18:28.560
 I don't even want to have to make that decision about whether I'm going to profit off of that knowledge.

18:29.840 --> 18:37.680
 I went down to Argentina and this whole kind of moral calculus I had in my head was completely

18:37.680 --> 18:38.320
 flipped around.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.520
 So just a backup for a moment.

18:41.520 --> 18:46.080
 So Argentina actually is a real hackers paradise.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.640
 People grew up in Argentina and I went down there.

18:50.640 --> 18:56.160
 I guess I was there around 2015, 2016, but you still couldn't get an iPhone.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.800
 They didn't have Amazon Prime.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.840
 You couldn't get access to any of the apps we all take for granted.

19:02.480 --> 19:06.720
 To get those things in Argentina as a kid, you have to find a way to hack them.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.720
 And it's the whole culture is really like a hacker culture.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.000
 They say it's really like a MacGyver culture.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.920
 You have to figure out how to break into something with wire and tape.

19:18.640 --> 19:25.120
 And that means that there are a lot of really good hackers in Argentina who

19:25.120 --> 19:28.720
 specialize in developing zero day exploits.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.240
 And I went down to this Argentina conference called Echo Party.

19:34.240 --> 19:40.240
 And I asked the organizer, okay, can you introduce me to someone who's selling zero day exploits

19:40.240 --> 19:40.960
 to governments?

19:41.520 --> 19:46.960
 And he was like, just throw a stone, throw a stone anywhere and you're going to hit someone.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.800
 And all over this conference, you saw these guys who were clearly from these Gulf States,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.000
 who only spoke Arabic.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.960
 What are they doing at a young hacking conference in Buenos Aires?

19:58.960 --> 19:59.600
 Oh boy.

19:59.600 --> 20:06.080
 And so I went out to lunch with kind of this godfather of the hacking scene

20:06.800 --> 20:07.200
 there.

20:07.200 --> 20:12.240
 And I asked this really dumb question and I'm still embarrassed about how I phrased it.

20:12.960 --> 20:18.640
 But I said, so, you know, well, these guys only sell these zero day exploits to good Western

20:18.640 --> 20:19.200
 governments.

20:20.160 --> 20:24.880
 And he said, Nicole, last time I checked the United States wasn't a good Western government.

20:24.880 --> 20:30.880
 You know, the last country that bombed another country into oblivion wasn't China or Iran.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.240
 It was the United States.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.800
 So if we're going to go by your whole moral calculus, you know, just know that we have

20:36.800 --> 20:38.640
 a very different calculus down here.

20:39.120 --> 20:45.440
 And we'd actually rather sell to Iran or Russia or China, maybe, than the United States.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.600
 And that just blew me away.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.960
 Like, wow.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.040
 You know, he's like, we'll just sell to whoever brings us the biggest bag of cash.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.560
 Have you checked into our inflation situation recently?

20:57.280 --> 21:00.960
 So, you know, I had some of those like reality checks along the way.

21:01.440 --> 21:06.640
 You know, we tend to think of things as is this moral, you know, is this ethical, especially

21:06.640 --> 21:12.000
 as journalists, you know, we kind of sit on our high horse sometimes and write about a

21:12.000 --> 21:14.880
 lot of things that seem to push the moral bounds.

21:15.600 --> 21:20.640
 But in this market, which is essentially an underground market that, you know, the one

21:20.640 --> 21:22.960
 rule is like fight club, you know, no one's going to do that.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.240
 No one talks about fight club.

21:24.240 --> 21:28.400
 First rule of the zero day market, nobody talks about the zero day market on both sides

21:28.960 --> 21:34.960
 because the hacker doesn't want to lose their $2.5 million bounty and governments roll

21:34.960 --> 21:38.880
 these into classified programs and they don't want anyone to know what they have.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.480
 So no one talks about this thing.

21:41.040 --> 21:46.480
 And when you're operating in the dark like that, it's really easy to put aside your morals sometimes.

21:46.480 --> 21:54.400
 Can I, as a small tangent, ask you by way of advice, you must have done some incredible interviews.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.680
 And you've also spoken about how serious you take protecting your sources.

22:01.360 --> 22:07.600
 If you were to give me advice for interviewing when you're recording on mic with a video camera,

22:10.080 --> 22:12.320
 how is it possible to get into this world?

22:12.880 --> 22:15.840
 Like, is it basically impossible?

22:15.840 --> 22:18.000
 So you've spoken with a few people.

22:18.960 --> 22:23.040
 What is it like the godfather of cyber war, cyber security?

22:23.040 --> 22:24.320
 So people that are already out.

22:25.120 --> 22:28.160
 And they still have to be pretty brave to speak publicly.

22:29.600 --> 22:34.480
 But is it virtually impossible to really talk to anybody who's a current hacker?

22:34.480 --> 22:36.640
 You're always like 10, 20 years behind.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.640
 It's a good question.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.400
 And this is why I'm a print journalist.

22:40.400 --> 22:49.040
 But when I've seen people do it, it's always the guy who's behind the shadows,

22:49.040 --> 22:50.800
 whose voice has been altered.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.720
 When they've gotten someone on camera, that's usually how they do it.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.800
 Very, very few people talk in this space.

22:58.800 --> 23:04.240
 And there's actually a pretty well known case study in why you don't talk publicly in this space

23:04.240 --> 23:05.920
 and you don't get photographed.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.720
 And that's the gruck.

23:06.720 --> 23:14.400
 So, you know, the gruck is or was this zero day broker, South African guy lives in Thailand.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.600
 And right when I was starting on this subject at the New York Times,

23:20.160 --> 23:25.440
 he'd given an interview to Forbes and he talked about being a zero day broker.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.880
 And he even posed next to this giant defil bag filled with cash ostensibly.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.280
 And later he would say he was speaking off the record.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.200
 He didn't understand the rules of the game.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.560
 But what I heard from people who did business with him was that the minute that that story

23:42.560 --> 23:44.320
 came out, he became PNG'd.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.640
 No one did business with him.

23:47.440 --> 23:50.000
 His business plummeted by at least half.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.680
 No one wants to do business with anyone who's going to get on camera

23:53.680 --> 23:56.240
 and talk about how they're selling zero days to governments.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.600
 It puts you at danger.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.200
 And I did hear that he got some visits from some security folks.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.440
 And, you know, that's another thing for these people to consider.

24:05.440 --> 24:10.800
 You know, if they have those zero day exploits at their disposal,

24:11.600 --> 24:16.640
 they become a huge target for nation states all over the world.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.680
 You know, talk about having perfect opsec.

24:19.680 --> 24:23.520
 You know, you better have some perfect opsec if people know

24:23.520 --> 24:26.080
 that you have access to those zero day exploits.

24:26.880 --> 24:31.680
 Which sucks because, I mean, transparency here.

24:31.680 --> 24:37.920
 Would be really powerful for educating the world and also inspiring other engineers to do good.

24:37.920 --> 24:44.080
 It just feels like when you operate in the shadows, it doesn't help us move in the positive

24:44.080 --> 24:48.640
 direction in terms of like getting more people on the defense side versus on the attack side.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.120
 Right.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.400
 But of course, what can you do?

24:50.400 --> 24:56.160
 I mean, the best you can possibly do is have great journalists just like you did interview

24:56.160 --> 25:00.400
 and write books about it and integrate the information you get while high.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.000
 Yeah.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.920
 And I think, you know, what hacker one has told me was, okay, let's just put away the people that

25:07.920 --> 25:12.160
 are finding and developing zero day exploits all day long.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.520
 Let's put that aside.

25:13.520 --> 25:19.200
 What about the, you know, however many millions of programmers all over the world who've never

25:19.200 --> 25:21.360
 even heard of a zero day exploit?

25:21.360 --> 25:27.920
 Why not tap into them and say, hey, we'll start paying you if you can find a bug in

25:27.920 --> 25:34.400
 United Airlines software or in Schneider Electric or in Ford or Tesla.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.680
 And I think that is a really smart approach.

25:37.680 --> 25:44.480
 Let's go find this untapped army of programmers to neutralize these bugs before the people

25:44.480 --> 25:48.400
 who will continue to sell these to governments can find them and exploit them.

25:48.400 --> 25:48.880
 Okay.

25:48.880 --> 25:55.120
 I have to ask you about this from a personal side of it's funny enough after we agree to

25:55.120 --> 26:01.040
 talk, I've gotten for the first time in my life was a victim of a cyber attack.

26:01.040 --> 26:05.600
 So this is ransomware, it's called Deadbolt.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.040
 People can look it up.

26:07.040 --> 26:12.640
 I have a QNAP device for basically kind of cold dish storage.

26:12.640 --> 26:20.800
 So it's about 60 terabytes with 50 terabytes of data on it in RAID 5 and apparently about

26:20.800 --> 26:27.680
 4,000 to 5,000 QNAP devices were hacked and taken over with this ransomware.

26:27.680 --> 26:34.880
 And what ransomware does there is it goes file by file almost all the files on the QNAP

26:34.880 --> 26:37.600
 storage device and encrypts them.

26:37.600 --> 26:43.600
 And then there's this very eloquently and politely written page that pops up.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.440
 It describes what happened.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.440
 All your files have been encrypted.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.040
 This includes, but is not limited to photos, documents and spreadsheets.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.040
 Why me?

26:53.040 --> 26:58.000
 This is a lot of people commented about how friendly and eloquent this is.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.200
 And I have to commend them, it is and it's pretty user friendly.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.000
 Why me?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.520
 This is not a personal attack.

27:05.520 --> 27:12.560
 You have been targeted because of the inadequate security provided by your vendor, QNAP.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.760
 What now?

27:13.760 --> 27:20.640
 You can make a payment of exactly 0.03 Bitcoin, which is about $1,000, to the following address.

27:20.640 --> 27:25.760
 Once the payment has been made, we'll follow up with transaction to the same address, blah,

27:25.760 --> 27:29.760
 blah, blah, they give you instructions of what happens next and they'll give you a

27:29.760 --> 27:32.160
 decryption key that you can then use.

27:32.160 --> 27:37.840
 And then there's another message for QNAP that says all your affected customers have

27:37.840 --> 27:41.280
 been targeted using a zero day vulnerability in your product.

27:41.280 --> 27:45.600
 We offer you two options to mitigate this and future damage.

27:45.600 --> 27:52.240
 One, make a Bitcoin payment of five Bitcoin to the following address and that will reveal

27:52.240 --> 27:58.320
 to QNAP the, I'm summarizing things here, what the actual vulnerability is or you can

27:58.320 --> 28:04.480
 make a Bitcoin payment of 50 Bitcoin to get a master decryption key for all your customers.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.600
 50 Bitcoin is about $1.8 million.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.600
 Okay.

28:09.600 --> 28:17.040
 So, first of all, on a personal level, this one hurt for me.

28:17.040 --> 28:26.520
 I mean, I learned a lot because I wasn't, for the most part, backing up much of that

28:26.520 --> 28:31.160
 data because I thought I can afford to lose that data.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.160
 It's not horrible.

28:32.160 --> 28:37.480
 I mean, I think you've spoken about the crown jewels, making sure there's things you really

28:37.480 --> 28:38.480
 protect.

28:38.480 --> 28:45.920
 I mean, I have very conscious security wise on the crown jewels, but there's a bunch

28:45.920 --> 28:51.000
 of stuff like, you know, personal videos, they're not like, I don't know anything creepy, but

28:51.000 --> 28:56.200
 just like fun things I did that because they're very large or 4K or something like that, I

28:56.200 --> 29:00.040
 kept them on there, thinking RAID 5 will protect it.

29:00.040 --> 29:06.600
 Just I lost a bunch of stuff, including raw footage from interviews and all that kind

29:06.600 --> 29:08.400
 of stuff.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.640
 So it's painful.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.800
 And I'm sure there's a lot of painful stuff like that for the 4,000 to 5,000 people that

29:13.800 --> 29:14.800
 use QNAP.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.480
 And there's a lot of interesting ethical questions here.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.800
 Do you pay them?

29:20.800 --> 29:23.360
 Does QNAP pay them?

29:23.360 --> 29:25.680
 Do the individuals pay them?

29:25.680 --> 29:29.080
 Especially when you don't know if it's going to work or not.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.080
 Do you wait?

29:30.080 --> 29:36.160
 So, QNAP said that please don't pay them.

29:36.160 --> 29:42.120
 We're working very hard day and night to solve this.

29:42.120 --> 29:46.680
 It's so philosophically interesting to me because I also project onto them thinking,

29:46.680 --> 29:48.440
 what is their motivation?

29:48.440 --> 29:52.960
 Because the way they phrase that on purpose, perhaps, but I'm not sure if that actually

29:52.960 --> 29:59.600
 reflects their real motivation is maybe they're trying to help themselves sleep at night, basically

29:59.600 --> 30:01.360
 saying this is not about you.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.480
 This is about the company with the vulnerabilities.

30:04.480 --> 30:09.600
 Just like you mentioned, this is the justification they have, but they're hurting real people.

30:09.600 --> 30:14.800
 They hurt me, but I'm sure there's a few others that are really hurt.

30:14.800 --> 30:18.880
 And the zero day factor is a big one.

30:18.880 --> 30:23.920
 Their QNAP right now is trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with their system that

30:23.920 --> 30:26.000
 would let this in.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.320
 And even if they pay, if they still don't know where the zero day is, what's to say

30:31.320 --> 30:34.320
 that they won't just hit them again and hit you again.

30:34.320 --> 30:41.000
 So that really complicates things and that is a huge advancement for ransomware.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.280
 It's really only been, I think, in the last 18 months that we've ever really seen ransomware

30:46.280 --> 30:49.640
 exploit zero days to pull these off.

30:49.640 --> 30:56.680
 Usually 80% of them, I think the data shows 80% of them come down to a lack of two factor

30:56.680 --> 30:57.680
 authentication.

30:57.680 --> 31:03.000
 So when someone gets hit by a ransomware attack, they don't have two factor authentication

31:03.000 --> 31:07.680
 on, their employees were using stupid passwords.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.800
 You can mitigate that in the future.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.800
 This one, they don't know.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.800
 They probably don't know.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.800
 Yeah.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.240
 And it was, I guess it's zero click because I didn't have to do anything.

31:16.240 --> 31:21.760
 The only thing, well, here's the thing.

31:21.760 --> 31:29.600
 I did basics of putting it behind a firewall, I followed instructions, but I didn't really

31:29.600 --> 31:30.600
 pay attention.

31:30.600 --> 31:36.400
 So maybe there's a misconfiguration of some sort that's easy to make.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
 It's difficult.

31:37.400 --> 31:47.440
 We have a personal NAS, so I'm not willing to say that I did everything I possibly could,

31:47.440 --> 31:51.480
 but I did a lot of reasonable stuff and they still hit it with zero clicks.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
 I didn't have to do anything.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.480
 Yeah.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.160
 Well, it's like a zero day and it's a supply chain attack.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.680
 You're getting hit from your supplier.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.800
 You're getting hit because of your vendor.

32:01.800 --> 32:07.160
 And it's also a new thing for ransomware groups to go to the individuals to pressure them

32:07.160 --> 32:08.160
 to pay it.

32:08.160 --> 32:13.160
 There was this really interesting case, I think it was in Norway where there was a mental

32:13.160 --> 32:20.280
 health clinic that got hit and the cyber criminals were going to the patients themselves to

32:20.280 --> 32:28.240
 say, pay this or we're going to release your psychiatric records, I mean, talk about hell.

32:28.240 --> 32:33.800
 In terms of whether to pay, that is on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.960
 From the individual or from the company?

32:35.960 --> 32:36.960
 Both.

32:36.960 --> 32:44.840
 We've seen, for instance, there was an Apple supplier in Taiwan, they got hit and the ransom

32:44.840 --> 32:47.360
 demand was 50 million.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.440
 I'm surprised it's only 1.8 million.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.320
 I'm sure it's going to go up.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.320
 And it's hard.

32:53.320 --> 32:58.200
 There's obviously governments and maybe in this case, the company are going to tell you

32:58.200 --> 33:02.560
 we recommend you don't pay or please don't pay.

33:02.560 --> 33:08.600
 But the reality on the ground is that some businesses can't operate, some countries

33:08.600 --> 33:09.600
 can't function.

33:09.600 --> 33:19.400
 I mean, the under reported storyline of colonial pipeline was after the company got hit and

33:19.400 --> 33:23.600
 took the preemptive step of shutting down the pipeline because their billing systems

33:23.600 --> 33:27.680
 were frozen, they couldn't charge customers downstream.

33:27.680 --> 33:33.800
 My colleague David Sanger and I got our hands on a classified assessment that said that

33:33.800 --> 33:39.400
 as a country, we could have only afforded two to three more days of colonial pipeline

33:39.400 --> 33:40.400
 being down.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.080
 And it was really interesting.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.720
 I thought it was the gas and the jet fuel, but it wasn't.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.560
 We were sort of prepared for that.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.400
 It was the diesel.

33:49.400 --> 33:53.800
 Without the diesel, the refineries couldn't function and it would have totally screwed

33:53.800 --> 33:54.960
 up the economy.

33:54.960 --> 34:03.120
 And so there was almost this like national security, economic impetus for them to pay

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
 this ransom.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.560
 And the other one I always think about is Baltimore.

34:06.560 --> 34:11.480
 You know, when the city of Baltimore got hit, I think the initial ransom demand was

34:11.480 --> 34:13.880
 something around 76,000.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.120
 It may have even started smaller than that.

34:17.120 --> 34:22.920
 And Baltimore stood its ground and didn't pay, but ultimately the cost to remediate

34:22.920 --> 34:25.160
 was $18 million.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.840
 It's a lot for the city of Baltimore.

34:26.840 --> 34:32.800
 That's money that could have gone to public school education and roads and public health.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.360
 And instead, it just went to rebuilding the systems from scratch.

34:36.360 --> 34:43.640
 And so a lot of residents in Baltimore were like, why the hell didn't you pay the $76,000?

34:43.640 --> 34:46.280
 So it's not obvious.

34:46.280 --> 34:52.200
 It's easy to say, don't pay, because why you're funding their R&D for the next go round?

34:52.200 --> 34:57.040
 But it's too often, it's too complicated.

34:57.040 --> 35:03.400
 So on the individual level, just like the way I feel personally from this attack, have

35:03.400 --> 35:07.480
 you talked to people that were kind of victims in the same way I was, but maybe more dramatic

35:07.480 --> 35:13.360
 ways or so on, in the same way that violence hurts people?

35:13.360 --> 35:16.720
 How much is this hurt people in your sense and the way you researched it?

35:16.720 --> 35:26.160
 The worst ransomware attack I've covered on a personal level was an attack on a hospital

35:26.160 --> 35:28.440
 in Vermont.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.800
 And you think of this as like, okay, it's hitting their IT networks.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.840
 They should still be able to treat patients.

35:34.840 --> 35:40.640
 But it turns out that cancer patients couldn't get their chemo anymore, because the protocol

35:40.640 --> 35:46.680
 of who gets what is very complicated and without it, nurses and doctors couldn't access it.

35:46.680 --> 35:52.440
 So they were turning chemo patients away, cancer patients away.

35:52.440 --> 35:57.880
 One nurse told us, I don't know why people aren't screaming about this, that the only

35:57.880 --> 36:02.240
 thing I've seen that even compares to what we're seeing at this hospital right now was

36:02.240 --> 36:07.000
 when I worked in the burn unit after the Boston Marathon bombing.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.800
 They really put it in these super dramatic terms.

36:10.800 --> 36:17.440
 And last year, there was a report in the Wall Street Journal where they attributed an infant

36:17.440 --> 36:26.360
 death to a ransomware attack because a mom came in and whatever device they were using

36:26.360 --> 36:30.760
 to monitor the fetus wasn't working because of the ransomware attack.

36:30.760 --> 36:34.720
 And so they attributed this infant death to the ransomware attack.

36:34.720 --> 36:41.400
 Now on a bigger scale, but less personal, when there was the not Petya attack.

36:41.400 --> 36:50.520
 So this was an attack by Russia on Ukraine that came at them through a supplier attacks

36:50.520 --> 36:57.200
 a software company in that case that didn't just hit any government agency or business

36:57.200 --> 37:02.560
 in Ukraine that use this tax software, it actually hit any business all over the world

37:02.560 --> 37:07.440
 that had even a single employee working remotely in Ukraine.

37:07.440 --> 37:12.400
 So it hit Marysk, the shipping company, but hit Pfizer, hit FedEx, but the one I will

37:12.400 --> 37:14.840
 never forget is Merck.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.680
 It paralyzed Merck's factories.

37:17.680 --> 37:22.040
 I mean, it really created an existential crisis for the company.

37:22.040 --> 37:27.680
 Merck had to tap into the CDC's emergency supplies of the Gardasil vaccine that year

37:27.680 --> 37:32.080
 because their whole vaccine production line had been paralyzed in that attack.

37:32.080 --> 37:39.520
 Imagine if that was going to happen right now to Pfizer or Moderna or Johnson and Johnson,

37:39.520 --> 37:47.320
 you know, imagine, I mean, that would really create a global cyber terrorist attack essentially.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.280
 And that's almost unintentional.

37:49.280 --> 37:56.400
 I thought for a long time, I always labeled it as collateral damage, but actually just

37:56.400 --> 38:03.600
 today, there was a really impressive threat researcher at Cisco, which has the threat

38:03.600 --> 38:09.040
 intelligence division called TALOS, who said, stop calling it collateral damage.

38:09.040 --> 38:15.740
 They could see who was going to get hit before they deployed that malware.

38:15.740 --> 38:18.000
 It wasn't collateral damage.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.160
 It was intentional.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.280
 They meant to hit any business that did business with Ukraine.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.380
 It was to send a message to them, too.

38:26.380 --> 38:28.640
 So I don't know if that's accurate.

38:28.640 --> 38:33.240
 I always thought of it as sort of the sloppy collateral damage, but it definitely made

38:33.240 --> 38:34.880
 me think.

38:34.880 --> 38:42.880
 So how much of this between states is going to be a part of war, these kinds of attacks

38:42.880 --> 38:51.200
 on Ukraine, between Russia and US, Russia and China, China and US?

38:51.200 --> 38:53.320
 Let's look at China and US.

38:53.320 --> 39:01.640
 Do you think China and US are going to escalate something that would be called a war purely

39:01.640 --> 39:04.200
 in the space of cyber?

39:04.200 --> 39:15.640
 I believe any geopolitical conflict from now on is guaranteed to have some cyber element

39:15.640 --> 39:17.320
 to it.

39:17.320 --> 39:21.880
 The Department of Justice recently declassified a report that said China's been hacking into

39:21.880 --> 39:25.400
 our pipelines, and it's not for intellectual property theft.

39:25.400 --> 39:31.120
 It's to get a foothold so that if things escalate in Taiwan, for example, they are where they

39:31.120 --> 39:35.340
 need to be to shut our pipelines down, and we just got a little glimpse of what that

39:35.340 --> 39:41.040
 looked like with colonial pipeline and the panic buying and the jet fuel shortages and

39:41.040 --> 39:44.680
 that assessment I just mentioned about the diesel.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.240
 So they're there.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.400
 They've gotten there.

39:49.400 --> 39:58.000
 Anytime I read a report about new aggression from Chinese fighter jets in Taiwan, or what's

39:58.000 --> 40:04.560
 happening right now with Russia's buildup on the Ukraine border, or India, Pakistan,

40:04.560 --> 40:09.880
 I'm always looking at it through a cyber lens, and it really bothers me that other people

40:09.880 --> 40:17.360
 aren't because there is no way that these governments and these nation states are not

40:17.360 --> 40:24.240
 going to use their access to gain some advantage in those conflicts.

40:24.240 --> 40:32.080
 And I'm now in a position where I'm an advisor to the cybersecurity infrastructure security

40:32.080 --> 40:39.920
 agency at DHS, so I'm not saying anything classified here, but I just think that it's

40:39.920 --> 40:47.680
 really important to understand just generally what the collateral damage could be for American

40:47.680 --> 40:53.000
 businesses and critical infrastructure in any of these escalated conflicts around the

40:53.000 --> 41:01.680
 world, because just generally, our adversaries have learned that they might never be able

41:01.680 --> 41:06.640
 to match us in terms of our traditional military spending on traditional weapons and fighter

41:06.640 --> 41:08.320
 jets.

41:08.320 --> 41:13.040
 But we have a very soft underbelly when it comes to cyber.

41:13.040 --> 41:22.000
 80% or more of America's critical infrastructure, so pipelines, power grid, nuclear plants,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.960
 water systems, is owned and operated by the private sector.

41:26.960 --> 41:34.080
 And for the most part, there is nothing out there legislating that those companies share

41:34.080 --> 41:37.400
 the fact they've been breached, they don't even have to tell the government they've

41:37.400 --> 41:38.880
 been hit.

41:38.880 --> 41:45.080
 There's nothing mandating that they even meet a bare minimum standard of cybersecurity.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.800
 And that's it.

41:46.800 --> 41:51.440
 So even when there are these attacks, most of the time, we don't even know about it.

41:51.440 --> 41:58.040
 So that is, if you were going to design a system to be as blind and vulnerable as possible,

41:58.040 --> 42:00.800
 that is pretty good.

42:00.800 --> 42:04.920
 That's what it looks like is what we have here in the United States.

42:04.920 --> 42:10.800
 And everyone here is just operating like, let's just keep hooking up everything for

42:10.800 --> 42:15.080
 convenience, software eats the world.

42:15.080 --> 42:21.080
 Let's just keep going for cost, for convenience sake, just because we can.

42:21.080 --> 42:26.880
 And when you study these issues and you study these attacks and you study the advancement

42:26.880 --> 42:33.960
 and the uptick in frequency and the lower barrier to entry that we see every single

42:33.960 --> 42:40.000
 year, you realize just how dumb software eats world is.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.480
 And no one has ever stopped to pause and think, should we be hooking up these systems to the

42:45.480 --> 42:46.480
 internet?

42:46.480 --> 42:51.400
 They've just been saying, can we, let's do it.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.600
 And that's a real problem.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.640
 And this, and just in the last year, you know, we've seen a record number of zero day attacks.

42:56.640 --> 43:03.160
 I think there were 80 last year, which is probably more than double what it was in 2019.

43:03.160 --> 43:09.680
 A lot of those were nation states, you know, we live in a world with a lot of geopolitical

43:09.680 --> 43:12.080
 hot points right now.

43:12.080 --> 43:18.320
 And where those geopolitical hot points are, are places where countries have been investing

43:18.320 --> 43:21.880
 heavily in offensive cyber tools.

43:21.880 --> 43:30.040
 If you're a nation state, the goal would be to maximize the footprint of zero day, like

43:30.040 --> 43:36.560
 super secret zero day that nobody's aware of, that whenever war is initiated, the huge

43:36.560 --> 43:42.080
 negative effects of shutting down infrastructure or any kind of zero day is the chaos it creates.

43:42.080 --> 43:46.640
 So if you just, there's a certain threshold when you create the chaos, the markets plummeted,

43:46.640 --> 43:49.480
 just everything goes, goes to hell.

43:49.480 --> 43:56.640
 So it's not just zero days, you know, we make it so easy for threat actors.

43:56.640 --> 44:02.840
 I mean, we're not using two factor authentication, we're not patching.

44:02.840 --> 44:08.360
 There was the shell shock vulnerability that was discovered a couple years ago.

44:08.360 --> 44:14.040
 It's still being exploited because so many people haven't fixed it.

44:14.040 --> 44:17.160
 So you know, the zero days are really the sexy stuff.

44:17.160 --> 44:24.080
 And what really got drew me to the zero day market was the moral calculus we talked about.

44:24.080 --> 44:30.400
 Really from the US government's point of view, how do they justify leaving these systems

44:30.400 --> 44:36.520
 so vulnerable when we use them here and we're baking more of our critical infrastructure

44:36.520 --> 44:38.720
 with this vulnerable software?

44:38.720 --> 44:43.560
 It's not like we're using one set of technology and Russia is using another and China is using

44:43.560 --> 44:46.040
 this, we're all using the same technology.

44:46.040 --> 44:51.760
 So when you find a zero day in windows, you're not just leaving it open so you can spy on

44:51.760 --> 44:57.720
 Russia or implant yourself in the Russian grid, you're leaving Americans vulnerable too.

44:57.720 --> 45:03.400
 But you know, but zero days are like, that is the secret sauce, you know, that's the

45:03.400 --> 45:04.400
 superpower.

45:04.400 --> 45:09.640
 You know, and I always say like every country now with the exception of Antarctica, someone

45:09.640 --> 45:16.960
 added the Vatican to my list is trying to find offensive hacking tools and zero days to make

45:16.960 --> 45:17.960
 them work.

45:17.960 --> 45:23.680
 And those that don't have the skills now have this market that they can tap into where,

45:23.680 --> 45:28.200
 you know, $2.5 million, that's chump change for a lot of these nation states.

45:28.200 --> 45:32.080
 It's a hell of a lot less than trying to build the next fighter jet.

45:32.080 --> 45:34.440
 But yeah, the goal is chaos.

45:34.440 --> 45:39.120
 I mean, why did Russia turn off the lights twice in Ukraine?

45:39.120 --> 45:46.280
 You know, I think part of it is chaos, I think part of it is to sow the seeds of doubt in

45:46.280 --> 45:50.480
 their current government, your government can't even keep your lights on.

45:50.480 --> 45:55.040
 Why are you sticking with them, you know, come over here and we'll keep your lights

45:55.040 --> 45:58.720
 on at least, you know, there's like a little bit of that.

45:58.720 --> 46:04.760
 Nuclear weapons seems to have helped prevent nuclear war.

46:04.760 --> 46:11.480
 Is it possible that we have so many vulnerabilities and so many attack vectors on each other that

46:11.480 --> 46:17.200
 it will kind of achieve the same kind of equilibrium like mutually assured destruction?

46:17.200 --> 46:20.520
 Yeah, that's one hopeful solution to this.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.800
 Do you have any hope for this particular solution?

46:23.800 --> 46:27.920
 You know, nuclear analogies always tend to fall apart when it comes to cyber, mainly

46:27.920 --> 46:33.160
 because you don't need fissile material, you know, you just need a laptop and the skills

46:33.160 --> 46:34.660
 and you're in the game.

46:34.660 --> 46:38.240
 So it's a really low barrier to entry.

46:38.240 --> 46:44.440
 The other thing is attributions harder and we've seen countries muck around with attribution.

46:44.440 --> 46:49.560
 We've seen, you know, nation states piggyback on other countries by operations and just

46:49.560 --> 46:53.400
 sit there and siphon out whatever they're getting.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.320
 We learned some of that from the Snowden documents.

46:56.320 --> 47:01.480
 We've seen Russia hack into Iran's command and control attack servers.

47:01.480 --> 47:07.560
 We've seen them hit a Saudi petrochemical plant where they did neutralize the safety locks

47:07.560 --> 47:11.920
 at the plant and everyone assumed that it was Iran, given Iran had been targeting Saudi

47:11.920 --> 47:16.760
 oil companies forever, but nope, it turned out that it was a graduate research institute

47:16.760 --> 47:17.840
 outside Moscow.

47:17.840 --> 47:21.160
 So you see countries kind of playing around with attribution.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.160
 Why?

47:22.160 --> 47:26.800
 I think because they think, okay, if I do this, like how am I going to cover up that

47:26.800 --> 47:30.960
 it came from me because I don't want to risk the response?

47:30.960 --> 47:33.200
 So people are sort of dancing around this.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.360
 It's just in a very different way.

47:35.360 --> 47:41.560
 And, you know, at the times I'd covered the Chinese hacks of infrastructure companies

47:41.560 --> 47:42.560
 like pipelines.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.000
 I'd covered the Russian probes of nuclear plants.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.200
 I'd covered the Russian attacks on the Ukraine grid.

47:50.200 --> 47:57.120
 And then in 2018, my colleague David Sanger and I covered the fact that U.S. cyber command

47:57.120 --> 48:02.440
 had been hacking into the Russian grid and making a pretty loud show of it.

48:02.440 --> 48:06.560
 And when we went to the National Security Council, because that's what journalists do

48:06.560 --> 48:12.200
 before they publish a story, they give the other side a chance to respond, I assumed

48:12.200 --> 48:17.400
 we would be in for that really awkward, painful conversation where they would say, you will

48:17.400 --> 48:20.400
 have blood on your hands if you publish this story.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.040
 And instead they gave us the opposite answer.

48:23.040 --> 48:27.160
 They said, we have no problem with you publishing this story.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.160
 Why?

48:28.160 --> 48:32.320
 Well, they didn't say it out loud, but it was pretty obvious they wanted Russia to

48:32.320 --> 48:37.320
 know that we're hacking into their power grid too, and they better think twice before

48:37.320 --> 48:40.280
 they do to us what they had done to Ukraine.

48:40.280 --> 48:47.720
 So yeah, you know, we have stumbled into this new era of mutually assured digital destruction.

48:47.720 --> 48:57.000
 I think another sort of quasi norm we've stumbled into is proportional responses.

48:57.000 --> 49:03.440
 You know, there's this idea that if you get hit, you're allowed to respond proportionally

49:03.440 --> 49:05.440
 at a time and place of your choosing.

49:05.440 --> 49:08.600
 You know, that is how the language always goes.

49:08.600 --> 49:12.960
 That's what Obama said after North Korea hit Sony.

49:12.960 --> 49:17.080
 We will respond at a time and place of our choosing.

49:17.080 --> 49:21.240
 But no one really knows, like, what that response looks like.

49:21.240 --> 49:27.240
 And so what you see a lot of the time are just these, like, just short of war attacks.

49:27.240 --> 49:31.480
 You know, Russia turned off the power in Ukraine, but it wasn't like it stayed off for a week.

49:31.480 --> 49:34.880
 You know, it stayed off for a number of hours.

49:34.880 --> 49:41.000
 You know, not Petya hit those companies pretty hard, but no one died.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.120
 You know, and the question is, what's going to happen when someone dies?

49:45.120 --> 49:51.840
 And Canaanation State masquerade as a cyber criminal group, as a ransomware group.

49:51.840 --> 49:56.600
 And that's what really complicates coming to some sort of digital Geneva convention.

49:56.600 --> 50:01.240
 Like, there's been, there's been a push from Brad Smith at Microsoft.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.120
 We need a digital Geneva convention.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.440
 And on its face, it sounds like a no brainer.

50:06.440 --> 50:07.440
 Yeah.

50:07.440 --> 50:11.520
 Why wouldn't we all agree to stop hacking into each other's civilian hospital systems,

50:11.520 --> 50:20.640
 power grid, pipelines, but when you talk to people in the West, officials in the West,

50:20.640 --> 50:25.840
 they'll say, we would never, we'd love to agree to it, but we never do it when you're

50:25.840 --> 50:34.400
 dealing with Xi or Putin or Kim Jong Un, because a lot of times they outsource these

50:34.400 --> 50:37.160
 operations to cyber criminals.

50:37.160 --> 50:42.360
 In China, we see a lot of these attacks come from this loose satellite network of private

50:42.360 --> 50:46.800
 citizens that work at the behest of the Ministry of State Security.

50:46.800 --> 50:54.120
 So how do you come to some sort of state to state agreement when you're dealing with

50:54.120 --> 50:59.360
 transnational actors and cyber criminals, where it's really hard to pin down whether

50:59.360 --> 51:05.320
 that person was acting alone or whether they were acting at the behest of the MSS or the

51:05.320 --> 51:06.920
 FSB?

51:06.920 --> 51:11.920
 And a couple of years ago, I can't remember if it was before or after not pet you, but

51:11.920 --> 51:16.880
 Putin said, hackers are like artists who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start

51:16.880 --> 51:17.880
 painting.

51:17.880 --> 51:21.520
 In other words, I have no say over what they do or don't do.

51:21.520 --> 51:26.800
 So how do you come to some kind of norm when that's how he's talking about these issues

51:26.800 --> 51:34.320
 and he's just decimated Merck and Pfizer and however many thousand companies?

51:34.320 --> 51:40.240
 That is the fundamental difference between nuclear weapons and cyber attacks is the attribution

51:40.240 --> 51:42.240
 or one of the fundamental differences.

51:42.240 --> 51:48.000
 If you can fix one thing in the world in terms of cyber security that would make the world

51:48.000 --> 51:51.160
 a better place, what would you fix?

51:51.160 --> 51:57.960
 So you're not allowed to fix authoritarian regimes and you have to keep that.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.640
 You have to keep human nature as it is.

52:00.640 --> 52:06.400
 In terms of on the security side, technologically speaking, you mentioned there's no regulation

52:06.400 --> 52:10.400
 on companies in the United States.

52:10.400 --> 52:15.760
 What if you could just fix with the snap of a finger, what would you fix?

52:15.760 --> 52:21.200
 Two factor authentication, multifactor authentication.

52:21.200 --> 52:26.760
 It's ridiculous how many of these attacks come in because someone didn't turn on multifactor

52:26.760 --> 52:27.760
 authentication.

52:27.760 --> 52:35.320
 I mean, colonial pipeline, okay, they took down the biggest conduit for gas, jet fuel

52:35.320 --> 52:39.460
 and diesel to the east coast of the United States of America, how?

52:39.460 --> 52:43.600
 Because they forgot to deactivate an old employee account whose password had been traded on

52:43.600 --> 52:48.120
 the dark web and they'd never turned on two factor authentication.

52:48.120 --> 52:51.840
 This water treatment facility outside Florida was hacked last year.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.280
 How did it happen?

52:53.280 --> 52:58.400
 They were using Windows XP from like a decade ago that can't even get patches if you want

52:58.400 --> 53:01.920
 it to and they didn't have two factor authentication.

53:01.920 --> 53:07.080
 Time and time again, if they just switched on two factor authentication, some of these

53:07.080 --> 53:08.400
 attacks wouldn't have been possible.

53:08.400 --> 53:11.880
 Now, if I could snap my fingers, that's a thing I would do right now.

53:11.880 --> 53:17.640
 But of course, this is a cat and mouse game and then the attackers onto the next thing.

53:17.640 --> 53:25.160
 But I think right now, that is like bar none, that is the easiest, simplest way to deflect

53:25.160 --> 53:30.120
 the most attacks and the name of the game right now isn't perfect security.

53:30.120 --> 53:32.280
 Perfect security is impossible.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.360
 They will always find a way in.

53:34.360 --> 53:39.960
 The name of the game right now is make yourself a little bit harder to attack than your competitor

53:39.960 --> 53:45.040
 or than anyone else out there so that they just give up and move along.

53:45.040 --> 53:51.960
 Maybe if you are a target for an advanced nation state or the SVR, you're going to get

53:51.960 --> 53:57.800
 hacked no matter what, but you can make cyber criminal groups deadbolt, is it?

53:57.800 --> 54:03.480
 You can make their jobs a lot harder simply by doing the bare basics.

54:03.480 --> 54:08.120
 And the other thing is stop reusing your passwords, but if I only get one, then two factor authentication.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.720
 So what is two factor authentication?

54:10.720 --> 54:15.800
 Factor one is what logging in with a password, and factor two is like have another device

54:15.800 --> 54:19.640
 or another channel through which you can confirm, yeah, that's me.

54:19.640 --> 54:20.640
 Yes.

54:20.640 --> 54:24.640
 You know, usually this happens through some kind of text, you know, you get your one time

54:24.640 --> 54:31.640
 code from Bank of America or from Google, and the better way to do it is spend $20 buying

54:31.640 --> 54:34.360
 yourself a Fido key on Amazon.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.200
 That's a hardware device.

54:36.200 --> 54:41.440
 And if you don't have that hardware device with you, then you're not going to get in.

54:41.440 --> 54:45.600
 And the whole goal is, I mean, basically, you know, my first half of my decade at the

54:45.600 --> 54:48.600
 Times was spent covering like the copy.

54:48.600 --> 54:54.480
 It was like Home Depot got breached, News at 11, you know, Target, Neumann Marcus,

54:54.480 --> 54:58.560
 like who wasn't hacked over the course of those five years.

54:58.560 --> 55:02.200
 And a lot of those companies that got hacked, what did hackers take?

55:02.200 --> 55:03.760
 They took the credentials.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.560
 They took the passwords.

55:05.560 --> 55:11.600
 They can make a pretty penny selling them on the dark web and people reuse their passwords.

55:11.600 --> 55:17.920
 So you get one from, you know, God knows who, I don't know, LastPass, the worst case example

55:17.920 --> 55:23.480
 actually LastPass, but you get one and then you go test it on their email account and

55:23.480 --> 55:27.920
 you go test it on their brokerage account and you test it on their cold storage account.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
 Yeah.

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
 You know, that's how it works.

55:29.920 --> 55:35.160
 But if you have multi factor authentication, then they can't get in because they might

55:35.160 --> 55:38.040
 have your password, but they don't have your phone.

55:38.040 --> 55:43.120
 They don't have your phyto key, you know, and so you keep them out.

55:43.120 --> 55:49.200
 And you know, I get a lot of alerts that tell me someone is trying to get into your Instagram

55:49.200 --> 55:54.480
 account or your Twitter account or your email account and I don't worry because I use multi

55:54.480 --> 55:55.480
 factor authentication.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.480
 They can try all day.

55:57.480 --> 55:58.480
 Okay.

55:58.480 --> 56:04.280
 I worry a little bit, but, you know, it's the simplest thing to do and we don't even

56:04.280 --> 56:05.280
 do it.

56:05.280 --> 56:09.960
 Well, there's an interface aspect to it because it's pretty annoying if it's implemented poorly.

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
 Yeah.

56:10.960 --> 56:17.800
 So, so actually bad implementation of two factor authentication, not just bad, but just something

56:17.800 --> 56:23.000
 that adds friction is a security vulnerability, I guess, because it's really annoying.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.560
 Like, I think MIT for a while had two factor authentication, it was really annoying.

56:28.560 --> 56:36.160
 I just, like the, the time, the number of times it pings you, like, uh, it re, it asked

56:36.160 --> 56:42.720
 to reauthenticate across multiple subdomains, like, it just feels like a pain.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.280
 I don't know what the right balance there.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.280
 Yeah.

56:45.280 --> 56:51.240
 It feels like friction in our frictionless society, it feels like friction, it's annoying.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.040
 That security is biggest problem.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.040
 It's annoying.

56:54.040 --> 57:00.000
 You know, we need the Steve Jobs of security to come along and we need to make it painless.

57:00.000 --> 57:06.880
 And actually, you know, on that point, Apple has probably done more for security than anyone

57:06.880 --> 57:12.760
 else simply by introducing biometric authentication first with the fingerprint and then with face

57:12.760 --> 57:13.760
 ID.

57:13.760 --> 57:18.040
 And it's not perfect, but, you know, if you think just eight years ago, everyone was running

57:18.040 --> 57:23.480
 around with either no passcode and optional passcode or four digit passcode on their phone

57:23.480 --> 57:27.480
 that anyone, you know, think of what you can get when you get someone's iPhone, if you

57:27.480 --> 57:32.800
 steal someone's iPhone and, you know, props to them for introducing the fingerprint and

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
 face ID.

57:33.800 --> 57:37.040
 And again, it wasn't perfect, but it was a huge step forward.

57:37.040 --> 57:41.080
 Now it's time to make another huge step forward.

57:41.080 --> 57:42.760
 I want to see the password die.

57:42.760 --> 57:47.040
 I mean, it's gotten us as far as it was ever going to get us.

57:47.040 --> 57:52.480
 And I hope whatever we come up with next is not going to be annoying, is going to be seamless.

57:52.480 --> 57:56.920
 When I was at Google, that's what we worked on is, and there's a lot of ways to call it

57:56.920 --> 57:59.960
 active authentication, passive authentication.

57:59.960 --> 58:05.000
 So basically you use biometric data, not just like a fingerprint, but everything from your

58:05.000 --> 58:07.280
 body to identify who you are.

58:07.280 --> 58:14.240
 Like movement patterns, so it basically creates a lot of layers of protection where it's very

58:14.240 --> 58:21.480
 difficult to fake, including like face unlock, checking that it's your actual face, like

58:21.480 --> 58:23.120
 the liveness tests.

58:23.120 --> 58:31.160
 So like from video, so unlocking it with video, voice, the way you move the phone, the way

58:31.160 --> 58:33.440
 you take it out of the pocket, that kind of thing.

58:33.440 --> 58:37.600
 All of those factors, it's a really hard problem though.

58:37.600 --> 58:43.360
 And ultimately, it's very difficult to beat the password to have a security.

58:43.360 --> 58:48.280
 Well, there's a company that I actually will call out and that's abnormal security.

58:48.280 --> 58:51.880
 So they work on email attacks.

58:51.880 --> 58:59.440
 And it was started by a couple guys who were doing, I think, ad tech at Twitter.

58:59.440 --> 59:04.040
 So you know, ad technology now, like it's a joke how much they know about us, you know,

59:04.040 --> 59:08.480
 you always hear the conspiracy theories that, you know, you saw someone's shoes and next

59:08.480 --> 59:13.720
 thing you know, it's on your phone, it's amazing what they know about you.

59:13.720 --> 59:19.760
 And they're basically taking that and they're applying it to attacks.

59:19.760 --> 59:25.160
 So they're saying, okay, you know, if you're, this is what your email patterns are, it might

59:25.160 --> 59:28.880
 be different for you and me because we're emailing strangers all the time.

59:28.880 --> 59:34.000
 But for most people, their email patterns are pretty predictable.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.680
 And if something strays from that pattern, that's abnormal.

59:38.680 --> 59:43.600
 And they'll block it, they'll investigate it, you know, and that's great.

59:43.600 --> 59:50.840
 You know, let's start using that kind of targeted ad technology to protect people.

59:50.840 --> 59:55.360
 And yeah, I mean, it's not going to get us away from the password and using multi factor

59:55.360 --> 1:00:01.120
 authentication, but you know, the technology is out there and we just have to figure out

1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:06.520
 how to use it in a really seamless way because it doesn't matter if you have the perfect

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:08.320
 security solution if no one uses it.

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:14.280
 I mean, when I started at the times, when I was trying to be really good about protecting

1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:19.880
 sources, I was trying to use PGP encryption and it's like, it didn't work, you know, the

1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:25.880
 number of mistakes I would probably make just trying to email someone with PGP just wasn't

1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:27.480
 worth it.

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:32.840
 And then Signal came along and, and Signal made it a wicker, you know, they made it

1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:37.040
 a lot easier to send someone an encrypted text message.

1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:45.560
 So we, we have to start investing in creative minds in good security design, you know, I

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:50.160
 really think that's the hack that's going to get us out of where we are today.

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:52.600
 What about social engineering?

1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:56.480
 Do you worry about this sort of hacking people?

1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:03.560
 Yes, I mean, this is the worst nightmare of every chief information security officer out

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:04.560
 there.

1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:10.040
 You know, social engineering, we work from home now.

1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:16.920
 I saw this, this woman posted online about how her husband, it went viral today, but

1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:20.040
 it was her husband had this problem at work.

1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:26.640
 They hired a guy named John and now the guy that shows up for work every day doesn't act

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:29.640
 like John.

1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:31.120
 I mean, think about that.

1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:35.600
 Like think about the potential for social engineering in that context.

1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:40.360
 You know, you apply for a job and you put on a pretty face, you hire an actor or something

1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:44.440
 and then you just get inside the organization and get access to all that organization's

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:45.440
 data.

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:52.400
 You know, a couple of years ago, Saudi Arabia planted spies inside Twitter, you know, why?

1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:56.320
 Probably because they were trying to figure out who these people were, who were criticizing

1:01:56.320 --> 1:02:00.080
 the regime on Twitter, you know, they couldn't do it with a hack from the outside.

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:02.760
 You know, why not plant people on the inside?

1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:04.640
 And that's like the worst nightmare.

1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:11.280
 And it also, unfortunately, creates all kinds of xenophobia at a lot of these organizations.

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.760
 I mean, if you're going to have to take that into consideration, then organizations are

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:20.480
 going to start looking really skeptically and suspiciously at someone who applies for

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:23.320
 that job from China.

1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:29.120
 And we've seen that go really badly at places like the Department of Commerce where they

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:32.000
 basically accuse people of being spies that aren't spies.

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.680
 So it is the hardest problem to solve.

1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:40.440
 And it's never been harder to solve than right at this very moment when there's so much pressure

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:44.000
 for companies to let people work remotely.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:49.640
 That's actually why I'm single, I'm suspicious that China and Russia, every time I meet somebody,

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:54.640
 are trying to plant and get insider information, so I'm very, very suspicious.

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:57.960
 I keep putting the Turing test in front, no.

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:05.200
 No, I have a friend who worked inside NSA and was one of their top hackers.

1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:10.920
 And he's like, every time I go to Russia, I get hit on by these 10s.

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:16.880
 And I come home, my friends are like, I'm sorry, you're not a 10, like the common story.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:23.800
 I mean, it's difficult to trust humans in this day and age online, you know, because

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:31.320
 so we're working remotely, that's one thing, but just interacting with people on the internet.

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:35.880
 It sounds ridiculous, but, you know, because of this podcast in part, I've gotten to meet

1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:43.440
 some incredible people, but it, you know, it makes you nervous to trust folks.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:48.240
 And I don't know how to solve that problem.

1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:55.680
 So I'm talking with Mark Zuckerberg, who dreams about creating the metaverse.

1:03:55.680 --> 1:04:01.640
 What do you do about that world where more and more our lives is in the digital sphere?

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:12.240
 Like one way to phrase it is most of our meaningful experiences at some point will be online,

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:20.000
 like falling in love, getting a job, or experiencing a moment of happiness with a friend, with

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:25.800
 a new friend made online, all of those things, like more and more, the fun we do, the things

1:04:25.800 --> 1:04:29.200
 that make us love life will happen online.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:35.960
 And if those things have an avatar that's digital, that's like a way to hack into people's minds,

1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:41.440
 whether it's with AI or kind of troll farms or something like that, I don't know if there's

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.960
 a way to protect against that.

1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:52.000
 That might fundamentally rely on our faith in how good human nature is.

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.000
 So if most people are good, we're going to be okay.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:03.440
 But if people will tend towards manipulation and a level of behavior in search of power,

1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:05.640
 then we're screwed.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:10.160
 So I don't know if you can comment on how to keep the metaverse secure.

1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:19.920
 I mean, all I thought about when you were talking just now is my three year old son.

1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:24.080
 He asked me the other day, what's the internet, mom?

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:27.880
 And I just almost wanted to cry.

1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:30.280
 I don't want that for him.

1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:34.240
 I don't want all of his most meaningful experiences to be online.

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:42.440
 By the time that happens, how do you know that person's human, that avatar is human?

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.600
 I believe in free speech.

1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:47.600
 I don't believe in free speech for robots and bots.

1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:52.600
 And look what just happened over the last six years.

1:05:52.600 --> 1:06:00.520
 We had bots pretending to be Black Lives Matter activists just to sow some division or Texas

1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:09.920
 secessionists or organizing anti Hillary protests or just to sow more division, tie us up in

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:15.760
 our own politics so that we're so paralyzed, we can't get anything done.

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:20.480
 We can't make any progress and we definitely can't handle our adversaries and their long

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:23.120
 term thinking.

1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:31.280
 It really scares me and here's where I just come back to just because we can create the

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:39.920
 metaverse, just because it sounds like the next logical step in our digital revolution.

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:45.640
 Do I really want my child's most significant moments to be online?

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:48.080
 They weren't for me.

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:55.120
 So maybe I'm just stuck in that old school thinking or maybe I've seen too much.

1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:01.720
 And I'm really sick of being the guinea pig parent generation for these things.

1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:08.560
 I mean, it's hard enough with screen time, thinking about how to manage the metaverse

1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:11.640
 as a parent to a young boy.

1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:13.840
 I can't even let my head go there.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.640
 That's so terrifying for me.

1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:24.120
 But we've never stopped any new technology just because it introduces risks.

1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:30.360
 We've always said, okay, the promise of this technology means we should keep going, keep

1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:31.760
 pressing ahead.

1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:35.640
 We just need to figure out new ways to manage that risk.

1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:40.840
 And that's the blockchain right now.

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:46.800
 When I was covering all of these ransomware attacks, I thought, okay, this is going to

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:49.600
 be it for cryptocurrency.

1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:51.400
 Governments are going to put the kibosh down.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:54.800
 They're going to put the hammer down and say, enough is enough.

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:58.560
 We have to put this genie back in the bottle because it's enabled ransomware.

1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:05.600
 I mean, five years ago, they would hijack your PC and they'd say, go to the local pharmacy,

1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:10.480
 get an eGift card and tell us what the pin is, and then we'll get your $200.

1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:14.520
 Now it's pay us, you know, five Bitcoin.

1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:20.160
 And so there's no doubt cryptocurrencies enabled ransomware attacks, but after the colonial

1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:24.760
 pipeline ransom was seized, because if you remember, the FBI was actually able to go

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:31.560
 in and claw some of it back from dark side, which was the ransomware group that hit it.

1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:34.160
 And I spoke to these guys at TRM Labs.

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:37.000
 So they're one of these blockchain intelligence companies.

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.080
 And a lot of people that work there are used to work at the Treasury.

1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:49.000
 And what they said to me was, yeah, cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware, but to track down

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:54.840
 that ransom payment would have taken, you know, if we were dealing with fiat currency,

1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:59.760
 would have taken us years to get to that one bank account or belonging to that one front

1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:01.960
 company in the Seychelles.

1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:08.440
 And now, thanks to blockchain, we can track the movement of those funds in real time.

1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:13.400
 And you know what, you know, these payments are not as anonymous as people think.

1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:18.920
 Like we still can use our old hacking ways and zero days and, you know, old school intelligence

1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:23.640
 methods to find out who owns that private wallet and how to get to it.

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:29.600
 So it's a curse in some ways in that it's an enabler, but it's also a blessing.

1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:34.160
 And they said that same thing to me that I just said to you, they said, we've never

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:39.200
 shut down a promising new technology because it introduced risk.

1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:42.200
 We just figured out how to manage that risk.

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:47.760
 And I think that's where the conversation unfortunately has to go, is how do we, in

1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:53.680
 the metaverse, use technology to fix things.

1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:00.360
 So maybe we'll finally be able to not finally, but figure out a way to solve the identity

1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:05.840
 problem on the internet, meaning like a blue check mark for actual human and connect it

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:13.880
 to identity, like a fingerprint, so you can prove your you and yet do it in a way that

1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:17.720
 doesn't involve the company having all your data.

1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:25.200
 So allowing you to maintain control over your data or if you don't, then there's a complete

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.160
 transparency of how that data is being used, all those kinds of things.

1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:36.320
 And maybe as you educate more and more people, they would demand in a capitalist society that

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:40.840
 the companies that they give their data to will respect that data.

1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:41.840
 Yeah.

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:44.920
 I mean, there is this company and I hope they succeed.

1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:52.520
 Their name's PIIano and they want to create a vault for your personal information inside

1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.800
 every organization.

1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:59.960
 And ultimately, if I'm going to call Delta Airlines to book a flight, they don't need

1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:05.680
 to know my social security number, they don't need to know my birth date.

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:08.920
 They're just going to send me a one time token to my phone.

1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:13.600
 My phone's going to say, or my Fido key is going to say, yep, it's her.

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:17.640
 And then we're going to talk about my identity like a token, some random token.

1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:20.120
 They don't need to know exactly who I am.

1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:26.600
 They just need to know the system trust that I am, who I say I am, but they don't get access

1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:27.960
 to my PII data.

1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:33.200
 They don't get access to my social security number, my location, or the fact I'm a Times

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:34.200
 journalist.

1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:38.560
 I think that's the way the world's going to go.

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:45.160
 Enough is enough on sort of losing our personal information everywhere, letting data marketing

1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:48.920
 companies track our every move.

1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:52.520
 They don't need to know who I am, okay, I get it.

1:11:52.520 --> 1:12:00.200
 We're stuck in this world where the internet runs on ads, so ads are not going to go away,

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:03.600
 but they don't need to know I'm Nicole Perlera.

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:08.800
 They can know that I am token number X567.

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:13.080
 And they can let you know what they know and give you control about removing the things

1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:14.080
 they know.

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:15.920
 Yeah, right to be forgotten.

1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:20.440
 To me, you should be able to walk away with a single press of a button.

1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:25.320
 And I also believe that most people given the choice to walk away won't walk away.

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:30.720
 They'll just feel better about having the option to walk away when they understand the tradeoffs.

1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:35.000
 If you walk away, you're not going to get some of the personalized experiences that you would

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.840
 otherwise get, like a personalized feed and all those kinds of things.

1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.200
 But the freedom to walk away is, I think, really powerful.

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:48.720
 And obviously, what you're saying, there's all of these HTML forms.

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:53.600
 We have to enter your phone number and email and private information from Delta, every

1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:55.960
 single airline.

1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:03.800
 Longer times, I have so many opinions on this, just the friction and the sign up and all

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:04.800
 of those kinds of things.

1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:07.240
 I should be able to, this has to do with everything.

1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:10.160
 This has to do with payment too.

1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:11.880
 Payment should be trivial.

1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:18.560
 It should be one click and one click to unsubscribe and subscribe and one click to provide all

1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:23.120
 of your information that's necessary for the subscription service, for the transaction

1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:27.160
 service, whatever, that is getting a ticket as opposed to, I have all these fake phone

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:34.440
 numbers and emails that I use in Delta sign up because you never know if one site is hacked,

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:37.760
 then it's just going to propagate to everything else.

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:38.760
 Yeah.

1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:45.160
 And there's low hanging fruit and I hope Congress does something and frankly, I think

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:51.960
 it's negligent they haven't on the fact that elderly people are getting spammed to death

1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:56.040
 on their phones these days with fake car warranty scams.

1:13:56.040 --> 1:14:01.240
 I mean, my dad was in the hospital last year and I was in the hospital room and his phone

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:09.440
 kept buzzing and I look at it and it's just spam attack after spam attack, people nonstop

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:15.400
 calling about his freaking car warranty, why they're trying to get his social security

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:19.960
 number, they're trying to get his PII, they're trying to get their information.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:28.680
 We need to figure out how to put those people in jail for life and we need to figure out

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:37.080
 why in the hell we are being required or asked to hand over our social security number and

1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:43.320
 our home address and our password, all of that information to every retailer who asks.

1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:46.720
 I mean, that's insanity.

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:54.440
 And there's no question they're not protecting it because it keeps showing up in spam or identity

1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:56.800
 theft or credit card theft or worse.

1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:02.720
 Well, spam is getting better and maybe as a side note, make a public announcement, please

1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:10.560
 clip this out, which is if you get an email or a message from Lex Friedman saying how

1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:19.040
 much I, Lex, appreciate you and love you and so on and please connect with me on my WhatsApp

1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:25.400
 number and I will give you Bitcoin or something like that, please do not click.

1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:31.160
 And I'm aware that there's a lot of this going on, a very large amount, I can't do anything

1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:32.160
 about it.

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:38.120
 This is on every single platform, it's happening more and more and more, which I've been recently

1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:41.080
 informed that they're not emailing.

1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:47.280
 So it's cross platform, they're taking people's, they're somehow, this is fascinating to me

1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:54.840
 because they are taking people who comment on various social platforms and they somehow

1:15:54.840 --> 1:16:00.280
 reverse engineer, they figure out what their email is and they send an email to that person

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:05.320
 saying from Lex Friedman and it's like a heartfelt email with links.

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:11.000
 It's fascinating because it's cross platform now, it's not just a spam bot that's messaging

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:17.360
 and a comment that's in reply, they are saying, okay, this person cares about this other person

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:22.600
 on social media, so I'm going to find another channel, which in their mind probably increases

1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:28.960
 and it does the likelihood that they'll get the people to click and they do.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:33.840
 I don't know what to do about that, it makes me really, really sad, especially with podcasting,

1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:39.120
 there's an intimacy that people feel connected and they get really excited, okay, cool.

1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:51.120
 I want to talk to Lex and they click and I get angry at the people that do this.

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:57.800
 I mean, it's like the John that gets hired, the fake employee, I mean, I don't know what

1:16:57.800 --> 1:16:58.800
 to do about that.

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:05.360
 I suppose the solution is education, it's telling people to be skeptical on the stuff

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:12.960
 they click, that balance with the technology solution of creating a maybe like two factor

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:19.440
 authentication and maybe helping identify things that are likely to be spam, I don't

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.160
 know, but then the machine learning there is tricky because you don't want to add a lot

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:28.400
 of extra friction that just annoys people because they'll turn it off because you have

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:31.040
 the accept cookies thing, right?

1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:35.040
 That everybody has to click on us and now they completely ignore the accept cookies.

1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:42.360
 This is very difficult to find that frictionless security.

1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:50.080
 You mentioned Snowden, you talked about looking through the NSA documents he leaked and doing

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:52.200
 the hard work of that.

1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:54.640
 What do you make of Edward Snowden?

1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:56.800
 What have you learned from those documents?

1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:00.760
 What do you think of him?

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:05.440
 In the long arc of history, is Edward Snowden a hero or a villain?

1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.400
 I think he's neither.

1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:13.000
 I have really complicated feelings about Edward Snowden.

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:21.200
 On the one hand, I'm a journalist at heart and more transparency is good and I'm grateful

1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:29.560
 for the conversations that we had in the post Snowden era about the limits to surveillance

1:18:29.560 --> 1:18:33.960
 and how critical privacy is.

1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:39.000
 When you have no transparency and you don't really know in that case what our secret courts

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:47.120
 were doing, how can you truly believe that our country is taking our civil liberties

1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:49.760
 seriously?

1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:56.320
 On the one hand, I'm grateful that he cracked open these debates.

1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:05.800
 On the other hand, when I walked into the storage closet of classified NSA secrets,

1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:15.560
 I had just spent two years covering Chinese cyber espionage almost every day and the sort

1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:23.400
 of advancement of Russian attacks that were just getting worse and worse and more destructive.

1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:31.040
 There were no limits to Chinese cyber espionage and Chinese surveillance of its own citizens.

1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:37.120
 There seemed to be no limit to what Russia was willing to do in terms of cyber attacks

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:41.640
 and also in some cases assassinating journalists.

1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:48.520
 When I walked into that room, there was a part of me quite honestly that was relieved

1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:54.880
 to know that the NSA was as good as I hoped they were.

1:19:54.880 --> 1:20:03.360
 We weren't using that knowledge to, as far as I know, assassinate journalists.

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:11.040
 We weren't using our access to take out pharmaceutical companies.

1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:16.640
 For the most part, we were using it for traditional espionage.

1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:23.200
 That set of documents also set me on the journey of my book because to me, the American people's

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:28.880
 reaction to the Snowden documents was a little bit misplaced.

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:34.160
 They were upset about the phone call metadata collection program.

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:39.680
 Angela Merkel, I think, rightfully was upset that we were hacking her cell phone.

1:20:39.680 --> 1:20:45.720
 But in the spy eat spy world, hacking world leader's cell phones is pretty much what most

1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:47.720
 spy agencies do.

1:20:47.720 --> 1:20:54.640
 There wasn't a lot that I saw in those documents that was beyond what I thought a spy agency

1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:57.880
 does.

1:20:57.880 --> 1:21:04.520
 I think if there was another 911 tomorrow, God forbid, we would all say, how did the NSA

1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:05.880
 miss this?

1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:07.960
 Why weren't they spying on those terrorists?

1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:11.080
 Why weren't they spying on those world leaders?

1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:13.520
 There's some of that too.

1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:22.840
 But I think that there was great damage done to the US's reputation.

1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:31.000
 I think we really lost our halo in terms of a protector of civil liberties.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:37.080
 And I think a lot of what was reported was unfortunately reported in a vacuum.

1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:44.200
 That was my biggest gripe that we were always reporting, the NSA has this program and here's

1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:52.880
 what it does and the NSA is in Angela Merkel's cell phone and the NSA can do this and no one

1:21:52.880 --> 1:22:00.680
 was saying, and by the way, China has been hacking into our pipelines and they've been

1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:06.440
 making off with all of our intellectual property and Russia's been hacking into our energy

1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:11.680
 infrastructure and they've been using the same methods to spy on track and in many

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:16.600
 cases kill their own journalists and the Saudis have been doing this to their own critics

1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:17.600
 and dissidents.

1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:22.840
 And so you can't talk about any of these countries in isolation.

1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:26.160
 It is really like spy eat spy out there.

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:28.760
 And so I just have complicated feelings.

1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:34.600
 And the other thing is, and I'm sorry, this is a little bit of a tangent, but the amount

1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:42.000
 of documents that we had, like thousands of documents, most of which were just crap, but

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:49.240
 had people's names on them, you know, part of me wishes that those documents had been

1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:53.200
 released in a much more targeted, limited way.

1:22:53.200 --> 1:23:00.600
 Just a lot of it just felt like a PowerPoint that was taken out of context.

1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:07.680
 And you just sort of wish that there had been a little bit more thought into what was released

1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:14.000
 because I think a lot of the impact from someone was just the volume of the reporting.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:19.880
 But I think, you know, based on what I saw personally, there was a lot of stuff that

1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:24.160
 I just I don't know why that that particular thing got released.

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:26.800
 As a whistleblower, what's the better way to do it?

1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:32.640
 Because, I mean, there's fear, there's it takes a lot of effort to do a more targeted

1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:33.640
 release.

1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:38.200
 You know, if there's proper channels, you're afraid that those channels will be manipulated

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:41.360
 like who do you trust?

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:45.440
 What's a better way to do this, do you think as a journalist, this is almost like a journalistic

1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:50.840
 question, reveal some fundamental flaw in the system without destroying the system.

1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:58.480
 And I bring up, you know, again, Mark Zuckerberg and Metta, there was a whistleblower that

1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:02.480
 came out about Instagram internal studies.

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:09.480
 And I also torn about how to feel about that whistleblower, because from a company perspective,

1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:11.880
 that's an open culture.

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:16.720
 How can you operate successfully if you have an open culture where any one whistleblower

1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:23.080
 can come out out of context, take a study whether it represents a larger context or not.

1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:25.520
 And the press eats it up.

1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:31.200
 And then that creates a narrative that is just like with the NSA, you said it's out

1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:38.360
 of context, very targeted to wear while Facebook is evil, clearly, because of this one leak.

1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:42.560
 It's really hard to know what to do there, because we're now in a society that's deeply

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:44.640
 distressed institutions.

1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:50.680
 And so narratives by whistleblowers make that whistleblower and their forthcoming book very

1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:52.320
 popular.

1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:57.120
 And so there's a huge incentive to take stuff out of context and to tell stories that don't

1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:01.440
 represent the full context, the full truth.

1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:06.800
 It's hard to know what to do with that, because then that forces Facebook and Metta and governments

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:10.720
 to be much more conservative, much more secretive.

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:16.440
 It's like a race to the bottom, I don't know if you can comment on any of that, how to

1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:20.720
 be a whistleblower ethically and properly.

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:21.720
 I don't know.

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:23.840
 I mean, these are hard questions.

1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:31.560
 And even for myself, in some ways, I think of my book as sort of blowing the whistle

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:38.360
 on the underground zero day market, but it's not like I was in the market myself.

1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:44.440
 It's not like I had access to classified data when I was reporting out that book.

1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:50.320
 As I say in the book, listen, I'm just trying to scrape the surface here so we can have these

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.320
 conversations before it's too late.

1:25:53.320 --> 1:26:02.400
 And I'm sure there's plenty in there that someone who's US intelligence agency's preeminent

1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:07.280
 zero day broker probably has some voodoo doll of me out there.

1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:12.240
 And you're never going to get it 100%.

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:20.200
 But I really applaud whistleblowers like the whistleblower who blew the whistle on the Trump

1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:23.960
 call with Zelensky.

1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:29.640
 People needed to know about that, that we were basically in some ways blackmailing an

1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:34.880
 ally to try to influence an election.

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:37.360
 They went through the proper channels.

1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:39.560
 They weren't trying to profit off of it, right?

1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:44.200
 There was no book that came out afterwards from that whistleblower.

1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:47.960
 That whistleblower's not like, they went through the channels.

1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:49.800
 They're not living in Moscow.

1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:50.800
 Let's put it that way.

1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:52.000
 Can I ask you a question?

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:59.320
 You mentioned NSA, one of the things it showed, is they're pretty good at what they do?

1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:06.440
 Again, this is a touchy subject, I suppose, but there's a lot of conspiracy theories about

1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:08.200
 intelligence agencies.

1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:17.000
 From your understanding of intelligence agencies, CIA, NSA, and the equivalent of in other countries,

1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:22.200
 are they one question, this could be a dangerous question, are they competent?

1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:24.920
 Are they good at what they do?

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:31.480
 And two, are they malevolent in any way?

1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:39.760
 A recent conversation about tobacco companies, they see their customers as dupes.

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:43.920
 They can just play games with people.

1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:48.760
 Conspiracy theories tell that similar story about intelligence agencies, that they're

1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:57.200
 interested in manipulating the populace for whatever ends the powerful in dark rooms,

1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:03.680
 cigarette smoke, cigar smoke filled rooms.

1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:04.680
 What's your sense?

1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:13.440
 Do these conspiracy theories have any truth to them or are intelligence agencies for the

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:15.600
 most part good for society?

1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:18.720
 Okay, well, that's an easy one.

1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:19.720
 Is it?

1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:20.720
 No.

1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:23.960
 I think it depends which intelligence agency.

1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:26.000
 Think about the Mossad.

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:37.520
 They're killing every Iranian nuclear scientist they can over the years, but have they delayed

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:42.960
 the time horizon before Iran gets the bomb?

1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:49.120
 Have they probably staved off terror attacks on their own citizens?

1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:53.720
 None of these, intelligence is intelligence.

1:28:53.720 --> 1:29:00.600
 You can't just say they're malevolent or they're heroes.

1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:09.080
 Everyone I have met in this space is not the pound your chest patriot that you see on the

1:29:09.080 --> 1:29:11.520
 beach on the 4th of July.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:18.240
 A lot of them have complicated feelings about their former employers, well, at least at

1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:28.960
 the NSA reminded me to do what we were accused of doing after Snowden, to spy on Americans.

1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:37.760
 You have no idea the amount of red tape and paperwork and bureaucracy it would have taken

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:45.480
 to do whatever one thinks that we were supposedly doing, but then we find out in the course

1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:51.800
 of the Snowden reporting about a program called Love In where a couple of the NSA analysts

1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:56.760
 were using their access to spy on their ex girlfriends.

1:29:56.760 --> 1:30:00.760
 There's an exception to every case.

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:10.960
 Probably I will probably get accused of my Western bias here again, but I think you can

1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:21.280
 almost barely compare some of these Western intelligence agencies to China, for instance.

1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:27.640
 The surveillance that they're deploying on the Uyghurs to the level they're deploying

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:33.080
 it, and the surveillance they're starting to export abroad with some of the programs

1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:37.680
 like the watering hole attack I mentioned earlier, where it's not just hitting the Uyghurs

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:42.480
 inside China, it's hitting anyone interested in the Uyghur plight outside China.

1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:46.600
 It could be an American high school student writing a paper on the Uyghurs.

1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:49.480
 They want to spy on that person too.

1:30:49.480 --> 1:30:56.160
 There's no rules in China really limiting the extent of that surveillance.

1:30:56.160 --> 1:31:02.880
 We all better pay attention to what's happening with the Uyghurs because just as Ukraine has

1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:09.920
 been to Russia in terms of a test kitchen for cyber attacks, the Uyghurs are China's

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:13.120
 test kitchen for surveillance.

1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:17.960
 There's no doubt in my mind that they're testing them on the Uyghurs.

1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:22.440
 Uyghurs are their petri dish and eventually they will export that level of surveillance

1:31:22.440 --> 1:31:23.440
 overseas.

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:34.480
 I mean, in 2015, Obama and Xi Jinping reached a deal where basically the White House said

1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:39.160
 you better cut it out on intellectual property theft.

1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:43.920
 They made this agreement that they would not hack each other for commercial benefit.

1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:49.080
 For a period of about 18 months, we saw this huge drop off in Chinese cyber attacks on

1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:51.320
 American companies.

1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:54.360
 Some of them continued.

1:31:54.360 --> 1:32:02.120
 They continued on aviation companies, on hospitality companies like Marriott.

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:03.120
 Why?

1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:05.640
 Because that was still considered fair game to China.

1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:06.880
 It wasn't IP theft.

1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:07.880
 They were after it.

1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:14.280
 They wanted to know who was staying in this city at this time when Chinese citizens were

1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:19.040
 staying there so they could cross match for counterintelligence who might be a likely Chinese

1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:20.200
 spy.

1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:23.560
 I'm sure we're doing some of that too.

1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:24.800
 Counterintelligence is counterintelligence.

1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:28.200
 It's considered fair game.

1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:37.400
 Where I think it gets evil is when you use it for censorship to suppress any dissent,

1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:45.160
 to do what I've seen the UAE do to its citizens, where people who've gone on Twitter just to

1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:49.800
 advocate for better voting rights, more enfranchisement.

1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:53.720
 Only find their passports confiscated.

1:32:53.720 --> 1:33:01.240
 I talked to one critic, Ahmed Mansour, and he told me, you might find yourself a terrorist,

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:04.960
 labeled a terrorist one day, and you don't even know how to operate a gun.

1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:07.960
 He'd been beaten up every time he tried to go somewhere.

1:33:07.960 --> 1:33:09.640
 His passport had been confiscated.

1:33:09.640 --> 1:33:12.680
 By that point, it turned out they'd already hacked into his phone, so they were listening

1:33:12.680 --> 1:33:14.180
 to us talking.

1:33:14.180 --> 1:33:23.400
 He'd hacked into his baby monitor, so they're spying on his child, and they stole his car.

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:28.120
 Then they created a new law that you couldn't criticize the ruling family or the ruling

1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.840
 party on Twitter.

1:33:29.840 --> 1:33:34.920
 He's been in solitary confinement every day since on hunger strike.

1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:36.440
 That's evil.

1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:38.800
 That's evil.

1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:40.800
 We don't do that here.

1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:42.080
 We have rules here.

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.960
 We don't cross that line.

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:48.760
 In some cases, I won't go to Dubai.

1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:50.000
 I won't go to Abu Dhabi.

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:55.240
 If I ever want to go to the Maldives, too bad, most of the flights go through Dubai.

1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:59.160
 There's some lines we're not willing to cross, but then again, just like you said, there's

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:05.960
 individuals within NSA, within CIA, and they may have power.

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:07.920
 To me, there's levels of evil.

1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:13.440
 To me, personally, this is the stuff of conspiracy theories is the things you've mentioned as

1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:21.520
 evil are more direct attacks, but there's also psychological warfare, so blackmail.

1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:25.280
 What does spying allow you to do?

1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:30.720
 It allows you to collect information if you have something that's embarrassing, or if

1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:37.560
 you have like Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories active, what is it, manufacture of embarrassing

1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:42.240
 things, and then use blackmail to manipulate the population or all the powerful people

1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:43.240
 involved.

1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:48.960
 It troubles me deeply that MIT allowed somebody like Jeffrey Epstein in their midst, especially

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:56.280
 some of the scientists I admire that they would hang out with that person at all.

1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.640
 I'll talk about it sometimes, and then a lot of people tell me, well, obviously, Jeffrey

1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:09.560
 Epstein is the front for intelligence, and I struggle to see that level of competence

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:18.280
 and malevolence, but who the hell am I?

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:21.280
 I guess I was trying to get to that point.

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:25.720
 You said that there's bureaucracy and so on, which makes some of these things very difficult.

1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:31.920
 I wonder how much malevolence, how much competence there is in these institutions.

1:35:31.920 --> 1:35:39.040
 How far, it takes us back to the hacking question, how far are people willing to go if they have

1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:40.040
 the power?

1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:44.240
 This has to do with social engineering, this has to do with hacking, this has to do with

1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:48.560
 manipulating people, attacking people, doing evil onto people, psychological warfare and

1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:50.200
 stuff like that.

1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:58.360
 I don't know, I believe that most people are good, and I don't think that's possible in

1:35:58.360 --> 1:35:59.360
 a free society.

1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:04.640
 There's something that happens when you have a centralized government where power corrupts

1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:12.840
 over time and you start surveillance programs, it's like a slippery slope that over time

1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:21.440
 starts to both use fear and direct manipulation to control the populace, but in a free society

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:27.160
 I just, it's difficult for me to imagine that you can have like somebody like a Jeffrey

1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:29.280
 Epps in the front for intelligence.

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:36.880
 I don't know what I'm asking you, but I'm just, I have a hope that for the most part

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:43.480
 intelligence agencies are trying to do good and are actually doing good for the world

1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:51.720
 when you view it in the full context of the complexities of the world.

1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:55.520
 But then again, if they're not, would we know?

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:58.480
 That's why Edwin Snowden might be a good thing.

1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:02.400
 Let me ask you on a personal question, you have investigated some of the most powerful

1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:07.720
 organizations and people in the world of cyber warfare, cyber security.

1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:13.240
 Are you ever afraid for your own life, your own well being digital or physical?

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.600
 I mean, I've had my moments.

1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:22.640
 You know, I've had our security team at the times called me at one point and said someone's

1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:30.080
 on the dark web offering good money to anyone who can hack your phone or your laptop.

1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:35.200
 I describe in my book how when I was at that hacking conference in Argentina, I came back

1:37:35.200 --> 1:37:41.560
 and I brought a burner laptop with me, but I'd kept it in the safe anyway and it didn't

1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:46.720
 have anything on it, but someone had broken in and it was moved.

1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:53.840
 You know, I've had all sorts of sort of scary moments and then I've had moments where I

1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:58.720
 think I went just way too far into the paranoid side.

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:05.840
 I mean, I remember writing about the times hack by China and I'd just covered a number

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:10.840
 of Chinese cyber attacks where they'd gotten into the thermostat at someone's corporate

1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:17.640
 apartment and, you know, they've gotten into all sorts of stuff and I was living by myself.

1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:25.000
 I was single in San Francisco and my cable box on my television started making some weird

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:30.120
 noises in the middle of the night and I got up and I ripped it out of the wall and I think

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:37.320
 I said something like embarrassing like, fuck you China, you know, and then I went back

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:42.040
 to bed and I woke up and like, it's like beautiful morning light, I mean, I'll never

1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:43.040
 forget it.

1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:46.840
 Like this is like glimmering morning light shining on my cable box, which has now been

1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:52.560
 ripped out and is sitting on my floor and like the morning light and I was just like,

1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:57.040
 no, no, no, like I'm not going down that road.

1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:06.240
 Like you basically, I came to a fork in the road where I could either go full tinfoil hat,

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:11.840
 go live off the grid, never have a car with navigation, never use Google Maps, never own

1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:20.680
 an iPhone, never order diapers off Amazon, you know, create an alias or I could just

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:26.440
 do the best I can and live in this new digital world we're living in.

1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:28.040
 And what does that look like for me?

1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:30.600
 I mean, what are my crown jewels?

1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:34.160
 This is what I tell people, what are your crown jewels because just focus on that.

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:37.520
 You can't protect everything, but you can protect your crown jewels.

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:42.280
 For me, for the longest time, my crown jewels were my sources.

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.640
 I was nothing without my sources.

1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:50.640
 So I had some sources, I would meet the same dim sum place or maybe it was a different

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:59.120
 restaurant on the same date, you know, every quarter and we would never drive there.

1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:00.400
 We would never Uber there.

1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:02.040
 We wouldn't bring any devices.

1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:05.600
 I could bring a pencil and a notepad.

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:09.480
 And if someone wasn't in town, like there were a couple of times where I'd show up and

1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:14.280
 the source never came, but we never communicated digitally.

1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.200
 And those were the lengths I was willing to go to protect that source, but you can't do

1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:19.600
 it for everyone.

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.880
 So for everyone else, you know, it was signal using two factor authentication, you know,

1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:30.760
 keeping my devices up to date, not clicking on phishing emails, using a password manager,

1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:34.720
 all the things that, you know, we know we're supposed to do.

1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.920
 And that's what I tell everyone, like don't go crazy because then that's like the ultimate

1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:39.920
 hack.

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:43.680
 Then they've hacked your mind, whoever they is for you.

1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:45.400
 But just do the best you can.

1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:54.720
 Now, my whole risk model changed when I had a kid, you know, now it's, oh God, you know,

1:40:54.720 --> 1:41:11.240
 if anyone threatened my family, God help them, but it's, it changes you and, you know, unfortunately,

1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:16.960
 there are some things like I was really scared to go deep on, like Russian cybercrime, you

1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:22.680
 know, like Putin himself, you know, and, and it's interesting, like I have a mentor who's

1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:29.920
 an incredible person who was the Times Moscow bureau chief during the Cold War.

1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:34.000
 And after I wrote a series of stories about Chinese cyber espionage, he took me out to

1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.880
 lunch and he told me that when he was living in Moscow, he would drop his kids off at preschool

1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:42.840
 when they were my son's age now.

1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:48.280
 And the KGB would follow him and they would make a really like loud show of it.

1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:54.360
 You know, they'd tail him, they'd, you know, honk, they'd just be a wreck, make a wreck

1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:55.360
 us.

1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:58.960
 And he said, you know what, they never actually did anything, but they wanted me to know that

1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:03.320
 they were following me and I operated accordingly.

1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:08.320
 And he says, that's how you should operate in, in the digital world.

1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:12.160
 You know that there are probably people following you.

1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:14.760
 Sometimes they'll make a little bit of noise.

1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:19.240
 But one thing you need to know is that while you're at the New York Times, you have a little

1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:23.840
 bit of an invisible shield on you, you know, if something were to happen to you, that would

1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:24.840
 be a really big deal.

1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:27.080
 That would be an international incident.

1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:31.680
 So I kind of carried that invisible shield with me for years.

1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:39.400
 And then a Jamal Khashoggi happened and that destroyed my vision of my invisible shield.

1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:45.680
 You know, sure, you know, he was a Saudi, but he was a Washington Post columnist.

1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:50.440
 You know, for the most part, he was living in the United States, he was a journalist.

1:42:50.440 --> 1:42:58.720
 And for them to do what they did to him pretty much in the open and get away with it.

1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:03.280
 And for the United States to let them get away with it because we wanted to preserve

1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:11.120
 diplomatic relations with the Saudis, that really threw my worldview upside down.

1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:17.120
 And you know, I think that sent a message to a lot of countries that it was sort of

1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:19.840
 open season on journalists.

1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:27.840
 And to me, that was one of the most destructive things that happened under the previous administration.

1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:32.120
 And you know, I don't really know what to think of my invisible shield anymore.

1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:36.320
 Like you said, that really worries me on the journalism side that people would be afraid

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:41.320
 to dig deep on fascinating topics.

1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:50.320
 And you know, I have my own, that's part of the reason I would love to have kids, I would

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:52.960
 love to have a family.

1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:58.240
 Part of the reason I'm a little bit afraid, there's many ways to phrase this, but the

1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:05.560
 loss of freedom in the way of doing all the crazy shit that I naturally do, which I would

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:10.640
 say the ethic of journalism is kind of not is doing crazy shit without really thinking

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:11.640
 about it.

1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:18.640
 This is letting your curiosity really allow you to be free and explore.

1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:24.200
 I mean, whether it's stupidity or fearlessness, whatever it is, that's what great journalism

1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:25.480
 is.

1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:32.840
 And all the concerns about security risks have made me like become a better person.

1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:37.200
 The way I approach it is just make sure you don't have anything to hide.

1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:41.880
 I know this is not a thing, this is not a, this is not an approach to security.

1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:45.160
 I'm just, this is like a motivational speech or something.

1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:49.400
 It's just like, if you can lose, you can be hacked at any moment.

1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:54.480
 Just don't be a douchebag secretly, just be like a good person.

1:44:54.480 --> 1:45:02.240
 Because then I see this actually with social media in general, just present yourself in

1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:07.000
 the most authentic way possible, meaning be the same person online as you are privately,

1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:08.240
 have nothing to hide.

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:14.720
 That's one, not the only, but one of the ways to achieve security.

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:19.560
 I'm totally wrong on this, but don't be secretly weird.

1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:21.960
 If you're weird, be publicly weird.

1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:24.360
 So it's impossible to blackmail you.

1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:25.360
 That's my approach to it.

1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:26.360
 Yeah.

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:30.680
 Well, they call it the New York Times front page phenomenon, you know, don't put anything

1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:36.120
 in email or I guess social media these days that you wouldn't want to read on the front

1:45:36.120 --> 1:45:38.000
 page of the New York Times.

1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:44.640
 And that works, but you know, sometimes I even get carry, I mean, I have not as many

1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:48.720
 followers as you, but a lot of followers and sometimes even I get carried away.

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:50.880
 Just be emotional and stuff to say something.

1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:51.880
 Yeah.

1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:52.880
 Yeah.

1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:59.720
 I mean, just the cortisol response on Twitter, you know, Twitter is basically like designed

1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:01.520
 to elicit those responses.

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:07.120
 I mean, every day I turn on my computer, I look at my phone, I look at what's trending

1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:12.760
 on Twitter and it's like, what are the topics that are going to make people the most angry

1:46:12.760 --> 1:46:21.120
 today, you know, and, um, you know, it's easy to get carried away, but it's also just that

1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:26.840
 sucks too that you have to be constantly censoring yourself and maybe it's for the better.

1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:31.640
 Maybe you can't be a secret asshole and we can put that in the good bucket.

1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:41.240
 But at the same time, you know, there is a danger to that other voice, to creativity,

1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:43.200
 you know, to being weird.

1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.720
 There's a danger to that little whispered voice that's like, well, how would people

1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:48.720
 read that?

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:51.280
 You know, how could that be manipulated?

1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:53.840
 How could that be used against you?

1:46:53.840 --> 1:47:03.680
 And that stifles creativity and innovation and free thought and, you know, that is on

1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:09.120
 a very micro level and that's something I think about a lot.

1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:13.560
 And that's actually something that Tim Cook has talked about a lot.

1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:19.560
 And why he has, you know, said he goes full force on privacy is it's just that little

1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:25.200
 voice that is at some level censoring you.

1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:31.000
 And what, what is sort of the longterm impact of that little voice over time?

1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:36.840
 I think there's a ways, I think that self censorship is an attack factor that there's

1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:37.840
 solutions to.

1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:40.240
 In a way, I'm really inspired by Elon Musk.

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:47.160
 The solution to that is just be privately and publicly the same person and be ridiculous.

1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:49.880
 Embrace the full weirdness and show it more and more.

1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:54.200
 So it, you know, that's, that's memes that has like ridiculous humor.

1:47:54.200 --> 1:48:01.320
 And I think, and if there is something you really want to hide, deeply consider if that

1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:05.520
 you want to be that, like, why are you hiding it?

1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:07.120
 What exactly are you afraid of?

1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:13.400
 Because I think my hopeful vision for the internet is the internet loves authenticity.

1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:15.200
 They want to see you weird.

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:20.800
 So be that and like live that fully because I think that gray area where you're kind of

1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.320
 censoring yourself, that, that's where the destruction is.

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:28.880
 You have to go all the way, step over, be weird, be weird.

1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:33.080
 And then it feels, it can be painful because people can attack you and so on, but just

1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:34.080
 ride it.

1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:41.360
 It's just like a skill on a social psychological level that ends up being a, an approach to

1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:47.400
 security, which is like, remove the attack vector of having private information by being

1:48:47.400 --> 1:48:51.800
 your full weird self publicly.

1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:58.920
 What, what advice would you give to young folks today, you know, operating in, in this

1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:04.360
 complicated space about how to have a successful life, a life they can be proud of, a career

1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:10.120
 they can be proud of, maybe somebody in high school and college thinking about what they're

1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:11.120
 going to do.

1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:18.920
 Be a hacker, you know, if you have any interest, become a hacker and apply yourself to defense.

1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:24.680
 You know, every time, like we do have these, these amazing scholarship programs, for instance,

1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:30.080
 where, you know, they find you early, they'll pay your college as long as you commit to

1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:35.440
 some kind of federal commitment to sort of help federal agencies with cybersecurity.

1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.080
 And where does everyone want to go every year from the scholarship program?

1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:44.240
 They want to go work at the NSA or cyber command, you know, they want to go work on offense.

1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:46.360
 They want to go do the sexy stuff.

1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:50.000
 It's really hard to get people to work on defense.

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.760
 It's just, it's always been more fun to be a pirate than be in the Coast Guard, you know,

1:49:54.760 --> 1:50:01.440
 and so we have a huge deficit when it comes to filling those roles.

1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:07.560
 There's 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions around the world.

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:12.800
 I mean, talk about job security, like be a hacker and work on cybersecurity.

1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:15.640
 You will always have a job.

1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:23.120
 And we're actually had a huge deficit and disadvantage as a free market economy because

1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:30.120
 we can't match cybersecurity salaries at Palantir or Facebook or Google or Microsoft.

1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:35.320
 And so it's really hard for the United States to fill those roles.

1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:39.400
 And you know, other countries have had this work around where they basically have forced

1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:45.080
 conscription on some level, you know, China tells people, like, you do whatever you're

1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:50.840
 going to do during the day, work at Alibaba, you know, if you need to do some ransomware,

1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:56.320
 okay, but the minute we tap you on the shoulder and ask you to come do this sensitive operation

1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:01.760
 for us, the answer is yes, you know, same with Russia, you know, a couple years ago

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:06.600
 when Yahoo was hacked, and they laid it all out in an indictment, it came down to two

1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:11.080
 cyber criminals and two guys from the FSB, cyber criminals were allowed to have their

1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:16.200
 fun, but the minute they came across the username and password for someone's personal Yahoo

1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:20.840
 account that worked at the White House or the State Department or military, they were

1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:23.720
 expected to pass that over to the FSB.

1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:25.080
 So we don't do that here.

1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:30.040
 And it's even worse on defense, we really can't fill these positions.

1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:36.680
 So you know, if you are a hacker, if you're interested in code, if you're a tinker, you

1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:43.080
 know, learn how to hack, there are all sorts of amazing hacking competitions you can do

1:51:43.080 --> 1:51:49.000
 through the SANS org, for example, SANS.

1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:54.280
 And then use those skills for good, you know, neuter the bugs in that code that get used

1:51:54.280 --> 1:52:00.640
 by autocratic regimes to make people's life, you know, a living prison, you know, plug

1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:06.120
 those holes, you know, defend industrial systems, defend our water treatment facilities from

1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:10.640
 hacks where people are trying to come in and poison the water, you know, that I think is

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:19.680
 just an amazing, it's an amazing job on so many levels, it's intellectually stimulating,

1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:24.120
 you can tell yourself you're serving your country, you can tell yourself you're saving

1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:28.480
 lives and keeping people safe, and you'll always have amazing job security.

1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:32.520
 And if you need to go get that job that pays you, you know, $2 million a year, you can

1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:33.520
 do that too.

1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:37.960
 And you can have a public profile, more so of a public profile, you can be a public rock

1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:38.960
 star.

1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:42.920
 I mean, it's the same thing as sort of the military.

1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:50.920
 There's a lot of, there's a lot of well known sort of people commenting on the fact that

1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:56.000
 veterans are not treated as well as they should be, but it's still the fact that soldiers

1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:02.880
 are deeply respected for defending the country, the freedoms, the ideals that we stand for.

1:53:02.880 --> 1:53:08.000
 And in the same way, I mean, in some ways, the cyber security defense are the soldiers

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000
 of the future.

1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000
 Yeah.

1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.000
 And you know what's interesting?

1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:16.640
 I mean, in cybersecurity, the difference is oftentimes you see the more interesting

1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:21.560
 threats in the private sector, because that's where the attacks come, you know, when cyber

1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:26.400
 criminals and nation state adversaries come for the United States, they don't go directly

1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:28.600
 for cyber command or the NSA.

1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:31.000
 No, they go for banks.

1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:36.800
 They go for Google, they go for Microsoft, they go for critical infrastructure.

1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:41.720
 And so those companies, those private sector companies get to see some of the most advanced

1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:46.120
 sophisticated attacks out there.

1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:50.760
 And you know, if you're working at FireEye and you're calling out the SolarWinds attack,

1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:58.040
 for instance, I mean, you just saved God knows how many systems from, you know, that compromise

1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:03.800
 turning into something that more closely resembles sabotage.

1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:11.080
 So you know, go be a hacker or go be a journalist.

1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:17.680
 So you wrote the book, this is how they tell me the world ends, as we've been talking about,

1:54:17.680 --> 1:54:21.800
 of course, referring to cyber war, cyber security.

1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:25.400
 What gives you hope about the future of our world?

1:54:25.400 --> 1:54:31.720
 If it doesn't end, how will it not end?

1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:32.720
 That's a good question.

1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:34.920
 I mean, I have to have hope, right?

1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:37.640
 Because I have a kid and I have another on the way.

1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:41.040
 And if I didn't have hope, I wouldn't be having kids.

1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:46.920
 But it's a scary time to be having kids.

1:54:46.920 --> 1:54:55.160
 And it's like pandemic, climate change, disinformation, increasingly advanced, perhaps

1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:57.800
 deadly cyber attacks.

1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:05.400
 What gives me hope is that I share your worldview that I think people are fundamentally good.

1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:10.200
 And sometimes, and this is why the metaverse scares me to death, but when I'm reminded

1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:16.480
 of that is not online, like online, I get the opposite, you know, you start to lose hope

1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:20.440
 and humanity when you're on Twitter half your day.

1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:25.640
 It's like when I go to the grocery store or I go on a hike or like someone smiles at

1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:33.320
 me or, you know, or someone just says something nice, you know, people are fundamentally good.

1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:37.600
 We just don't hear from those people enough.

1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:43.520
 And my hope is, you know, I just think our current political climate, like we've hit

1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:45.020
 rock bottom.

1:55:45.020 --> 1:55:46.720
 This is as bad as it gets.

1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:47.720
 We can't do anything.

1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:48.720
 Don't jinx it.

1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:52.040
 Well, but I think it's a generational thing.

1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:57.080
 You know, I think baby boomers, like it's time to move along.

1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:01.240
 I think it's time for a new generation to come in.

1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:08.080
 And I actually have a lot of hope when I look at, you know, I'm sort of like this, I guess

1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:14.320
 they call me a geriatric millennial or a young gen X, but like we have this unique responsibility

1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:21.120
 because I grew up without the internet and without social media, but I'm native to it.

1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:25.600
 So I know the good and I know the bad.

1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:28.320
 And that's true on so many different things.

1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:32.200
 You know, I grew up without climate change anxiety.

1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:34.920
 And now I'm feeling it and I know it's not a given.

1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:41.280
 We don't have to just resign ourselves to climate change, you know, same with disinformation.

1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:47.600
 And I think a lot of the problems we face today have just exposed the sort of inertia

1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:50.000
 that there has been on so many of these issues.

1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:54.760
 And I really think it's a generational shift that has to happen.

1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:58.800
 And I think this next generation is going to come in and say, like, we're not doing

1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:02.520
 business like you guys did it anymore, you know, we're not just going to like rape and

1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:07.840
 pillage the earth and try and turn everyone against each other and play dirty tricks and

1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:14.480
 let lobbyists dictate, you know, what we do or don't do as a country anymore.

1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:16.600
 And that's really where I see the hope.

1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:22.240
 It feels like there's a lot of low hanging fruit for young minds to step up and create

1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:23.840
 solutions and lead.

1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:32.880
 So whenever like politicians or leaders that are older, like you said, are acting shitty,

1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:34.200
 I see that as a positive.

1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:39.120
 They're inspiring a large number of young people to replace them.

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:40.120
 Yeah.

1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:44.200
 And so it's, I think you're right, there's going to be, it's almost like you need people

1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:49.200
 to act shitty to remind them, oh, wow, we need good leaders, we need great creators

1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:54.800
 and builders and entrepreneurs and scientists and engineers and journalists, you know, all

1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:58.800
 the discussions about how the journalism is quote unquote broken and so on.

1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:03.880
 That's just an inspiration for new institutions to rise up that do journalism better.

1:58:03.880 --> 1:58:06.400
 We need journalists to step up and do journalism better.

1:58:06.400 --> 1:58:11.920
 So I, and I've been constantly, when I talk to young people, I'm constantly impressed

1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:16.520
 by the ones that dream to build solutions.

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:22.280
 And so that's, that's, that's ultimately why I put the hope, but the world is a messy

1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:23.280
 place.

1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:26.680
 Like we've been talking about the scary place.

1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:27.680
 Yeah.

1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:33.240
 And I think you hit something, hit on something earlier, which is authenticity.

1:58:33.240 --> 1:58:40.120
 Like no one is going to rise above that is plastic anymore.

1:58:40.120 --> 1:58:45.720
 You know, people are craving authenticity, you know, the benefit of the internet is it's

1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:51.240
 really hard to hide who you are on every single platform, you know, and some level it's going

1:58:51.240 --> 1:58:54.000
 to come out who you really are.

1:58:54.000 --> 1:59:00.480
 And so you hope that, you know, by the time my kids are grown, like no one's going to

1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:08.120
 care if they made one mistake online so long as they're authentic, you know, and I used

1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:09.680
 to worry about this.

1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:15.640
 My nephew was born the day I graduated from college and I just always, you know, he's

1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:22.280
 like born into Facebook and just think like, how is a kid like that ever going to be president

1:59:22.280 --> 1:59:24.360
 of the United States of America?

1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:30.680
 Because if Facebook had been around when I was in college, you know, like Jesus, you

1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:34.280
 know, what, how is, how are those kids are going to ever be president?

1:59:34.280 --> 1:59:40.160
 There's going to be some photo of them at some point making some mistake and that's

1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:41.840
 going to be all over for them.

1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:43.160
 And now I take that back.

1:59:43.160 --> 1:59:46.920
 Now it's like, no, everyone's going to make mistakes.

1:59:46.920 --> 1:59:51.840
 There's going to be a picture for everyone and we're all going to have to come and grow

1:59:51.840 --> 1:59:57.160
 up to the view that as humans, we're going to make huge mistakes and hopefully they're

1:59:57.160 --> 2:00:01.560
 not so big that they're going to ruin the rest of your life, but we're going to have

2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:05.480
 to come around to this view that we're all human and we're going to have to be a little

2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:10.720
 bit more forgiving and a little bit more tolerant when people mess up and we're going to have

2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:15.560
 to be a little bit more humble when we do and like keep moving forward.

2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:18.000
 Otherwise, you can't like cancel everyone, you know?

2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:21.960
 Nicole, this was an incredible, hopeful conversation.

2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:30.320
 Also one that reveals that in the shadows, there's a lot of challenges to be solved.

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:34.480
 So I really appreciate that you took on this really difficult subject with your book.

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:35.880
 That's journalism is best.

2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:40.600
 So I'm really grateful that you did the, that you took the risk that you took that on and

2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:42.640
 that you plugged the cable box back in.

2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:45.440
 That means you have hope.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Nicole herself.

2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:08.160
 Here we are, entrusting our entire digital lives, passwords, texts, love letters, banking

2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:14.200
 records, health records, credit card sources, and deepest thoughts to this mystery box whose

2:01:14.200 --> 2:01:17.840
 inner circuitry most of us would never vet.

2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:23.560
 Run by code written in a language most of us will never fully understand.

2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:48.320
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
