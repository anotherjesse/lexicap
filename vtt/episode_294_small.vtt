WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
 It wasn't just a one on one but could be Steve

00:02.080 --> 00:05.800
 against the team going, we need glass instead of plastic

00:05.800 --> 00:07.600
 on the front face of the iPhone.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.000
 And we're going to do this.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
 And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
 And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details

00:17.000 --> 00:19.480
 but he could see in our minds that we're like,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.000
 you know, we could probably, you know, we could probably

00:22.000 --> 00:24.080
 but man, it's really putting us in risk.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.040
 And we laid out the risks for him.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.240
 And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.160
 The following is a conversation with Tony Fidel,

00:32.160 --> 00:37.040
 engineer and designer, co creator of the iPod, the iPhone

00:37.040 --> 00:39.400
 and the Nest thermostat.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.200
 And he's the author of the new book, Build,

00:42.200 --> 00:46.200
 an unorthodox guide to making things worth making.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.040
 More than almost any human ever.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.920
 He knows what it takes to create technology ideas,

00:51.920 --> 00:56.280
 designs, products and companies that revolutionize life

00:56.280 --> 00:59.120
 for huge numbers of people in the world.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.480
 So it truly is an honor and pleasure to sit down

01:02.480 --> 01:05.280
 with Tony for a time and look back at one heck

01:05.280 --> 01:06.520
 of an amazing life.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.520
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.000

01:13.000 --> 01:17.040
 And now, dear friends, here's Tony Fidel.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.240
 When did you first fall in love with computers?

01:21.240 --> 01:23.560
 Or let's say computer engineering and design?

01:23.560 --> 01:28.560
 I first fell in love with computers and programming

01:29.560 --> 01:34.440
 was at a summer school class in fifth grade

01:34.440 --> 01:36.560
 in Gross Point Farms, Michigan.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.600
 It was a simple basic programming class,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.600
 but the basic programming class was not

01:42.600 --> 01:44.680
 like you might think it was.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.080
 It was bubble cards.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.880
 So literally it was, you know, the stack of cards

01:50.880 --> 01:53.080
 and you would use a number two pencil

01:53.080 --> 01:55.920
 and you would put in your program line by line

01:55.920 --> 01:57.920
 and you'd have to make sure it was perfectly stacked

01:57.920 --> 01:59.320
 and no errors and what have you.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.920
 And you would take that set of cards

02:00.920 --> 02:04.600
 and you'd put it on this reader and it would go off

02:04.600 --> 02:09.600
 to an IBM microcomputer somewhere in the back vendor cloud.

02:09.760 --> 02:14.760
 And then you would sit on a Texas Instruments paper terminal

02:17.400 --> 02:20.960
 and it would just literally, I was just, I could write things

02:20.960 --> 02:23.640
 and it would, I could program this machine to do stuff.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.840
 And it was, you know, it was nowhere near six.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.520
 There was no graphics, right?

02:27.520 --> 02:31.120
 Oregon Trail was all in text, right?

02:31.120 --> 02:34.040
 The cards were so cumbersome that if you got one thing wrong

02:34.040 --> 02:37.880
 or out of order or a disaster or you dropped one card,

02:37.880 --> 02:39.520
 it would all fall apart.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.080
 So just doing that, you know, print F or what was it?

02:44.080 --> 02:45.440
 I can only remember what it was.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.600
 It was, you know, what the basic commands were.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.680
 But also when you say basic, you mean basic programming language.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.520
 Okay.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.360
 Basic programming.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.520
 You're writing basic programming language on paper.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.560
 On paper.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.080
 And you're calling it programming though.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.200
 It's called programming.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.640
 Yeah, you're programming this computer in, you know,

03:03.640 --> 03:06.240
 in a remote location and it came back.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.720
 So it was truly cloud computing in a way.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.320
 It was really terminal based computer.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.080
 And the input and the program are separate.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.240
 So the input to the program or they could go together.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.320
 Like, or there's no input to the program.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.320
 It just runs and it gives you output.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.000
 Yeah, it goes in and it says, it says ready.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.720
 And then you can say run and then it would run.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.000
 But to program it, you didn't type it

03:30.000 --> 03:31.480
 because it was a printer terminal.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.800
 You would make the stack of cards

03:32.800 --> 03:35.760
 and that would get it into the computer's memory.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.600
 Okay.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.960
 So where was the magic?

03:37.960 --> 03:41.520
 The magic was that you could create, you had a language

03:41.520 --> 03:43.760
 and you could create what you wanted to create, right?

03:43.760 --> 03:46.080
 You could create a world or what have you

03:46.080 --> 03:47.640
 and have this interaction.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.520
 And you could compute things.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.760
 You could, you know, do numbers.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.000
 You could, I was playing Oregon Trail, right?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.080
 So you were less like...

03:55.080 --> 03:56.720
 So you can play video games.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.040
 Wow, video.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.880
 That's right.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.240
 You could play text games

04:01.240 --> 04:03.400
 and then imagine them in your brain, right?

04:04.560 --> 04:05.760
 Oregon Trail.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.120
 There's a, this meme I saw recently,

04:08.120 --> 04:11.800
 if you want to feel bad about yourself as a programmer,

04:11.800 --> 04:16.400
 realize that one person wrote railroad tycoon.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.760
 I think that's the name of the game.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.200
 It's this cool little builder game.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.160
 One person wrote it in assembly.

04:25.520 --> 04:29.320
 So from, like from scratch and for people who don't know,

04:29.320 --> 04:31.600
 it kind of looks like a SimCity type game.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.040
 It's a city builder, but obviously centered on railroads.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.920
 And there's a nice graphics of three dimension

04:36.920 --> 04:37.960
 and all that kind of stuff.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.960
 All the things, all the rich, colorful things

04:40.960 --> 04:43.800
 you would imagine for a three dimensional video game,

04:43.800 --> 04:45.320
 all written in assembly,

04:45.320 --> 04:48.800
 meaning the lowest level code next to binary,

04:48.800 --> 04:50.160
 which is fascinating.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.520
 And that's the, you had to notice the magic

04:53.520 --> 04:55.680
 at that low level at that time.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.160
 You didn't have all the graphics.

04:57.160 --> 05:02.080
 You didn't have all the like APIs and all the sample codes

05:02.080 --> 05:04.440
 and no stack overflow, no internet, none of that.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.400
 You just had, you had to know registers.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.280
 You know, had to know the op codes.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.240
 And you had to imagine the world in your brain

05:10.240 --> 05:12.200
 of the memory structures and everything of,

05:12.200 --> 05:13.320
 there's no visualization.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.440
 You visualized it all yourself, right?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.600
 And so that was magic.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.080
 But then the next part of the magic

05:18.080 --> 05:20.400
 of where I got hooked even further

05:20.400 --> 05:22.480
 was like I'm doing these little things.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.600
 And then electronic arts came out for the Apple II.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.320
 So I got an Apple II and electronic arts came out

05:28.320 --> 05:30.000
 and I was programming and doing basic

05:30.000 --> 05:31.840
 and making my own games.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.440
 But then there were two games that really blew my mind.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.200
 One was pinball construction set.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.000
 And the other one was music construction set.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.280
 And these were both places where I could create pinball games

05:43.280 --> 05:46.480
 and I could create musical scores because I love music

05:46.480 --> 05:48.520
 and I could then play them, right?

05:48.520 --> 05:51.080
 And so when you had that, you were like,

05:51.080 --> 05:53.480
 oh, there's something very different.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.120
 So I could create myself.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.720
 But then there was others that create tools

05:57.720 --> 06:00.280
 so you could create at a visual level.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.000
 And then you would read the backstories

06:02.000 --> 06:03.760
 because electronics arts back in the day,

06:03.760 --> 06:06.240
 it was one programmer who would program

06:06.240 --> 06:08.160
 those things, each of those things.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.520
 And you could read their backstories.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.560
 It was literally like a musician or someone else.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.880
 Like you could read Rick Rubin's like, here's the thing.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.160
 They tell you all of that stuff.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.160
 And there was one guy who wrote music construction set.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.360
 He wrote it all in assembly and he was 16 years old.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.240
 And I was probably 12 or 13 at the time.

06:28.240 --> 06:32.400
 And I went, oh my, if he was able to do this

06:32.400 --> 06:34.160
 and had published, right?

06:34.160 --> 06:37.040
 And this amazing tool was created.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.240
 I'm like, what could I do?

06:38.240 --> 06:41.040
 And so then it just kept building off of that.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.880
 But really it was those seminal things,

06:42.880 --> 06:46.760
 first the introduction and then the power through programming

06:46.760 --> 06:50.160
 and turning these things into what you wanted to turn it into.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.360
 And you didn't have to be 40, 50 years old

06:53.360 --> 06:54.880
 and have PhDs.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.080
 And then I was like, okay, this is really cool.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.400
 I wish we did that with programmers

07:00.400 --> 07:01.920
 where we treated them like artists.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.720
 We would know the backstory these days today.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.040
 Not just programmers, engineers.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.480
 Engineers, designers.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.800
 Yeah, like all the things about a product

07:10.800 --> 07:13.840
 that I think we love are the little details.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.520
 And there's probably a human being

07:15.520 --> 07:18.320
 behind each of those details

07:18.320 --> 07:21.920
 that had their little inkling of genius that they put in.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.440
 And I wish we knew those stories.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.120
 That's always sad to me when I,

07:25.120 --> 07:27.520
 because obviously I love engineering

07:27.520 --> 07:29.040
 and I interact with companies

07:29.040 --> 07:31.440
 and they, you know, autonomous vehicles.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.720
 Something I'm really interested about.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.280
 And I see that companies generally,

07:35.280 --> 07:36.560
 and we'll probably talk about this,

07:36.560 --> 07:38.960
 but they seem to want to hide their engineers.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.160
 Like engineers hold the secrets.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.560
 Like the great secret, we do not speak of the great secret.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.480
 But then the result of that is you don't get to hear

07:50.480 --> 07:55.680
 their stories, the passion that is there behind the engineers.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.560
 And also the genius, the little,

07:58.560 --> 08:00.960
 there's a difference between the stuff that's patented

08:00.960 --> 08:03.680
 like the kernel of the idea

08:03.680 --> 08:06.480
 and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.120
 And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects

08:09.120 --> 08:10.720
 a little bit more.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.280
 But sorry for the distraction.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.680
 So what, you mentioned Apple II.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.560
 What was the first computer you fell in love with?

08:18.560 --> 08:21.280
 Like the product, the thing before you

08:21.280 --> 08:23.440
 that was a personal computer?

08:23.440 --> 08:25.040
 It was the Apple II.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.800
 So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.280
 You know, it was, I think it was at the time

08:31.280 --> 08:33.840
 it was the person of the year.

08:33.840 --> 08:34.960
 Maybe it was that year.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.720
 I don't remember what, but...

08:36.720 --> 08:38.800
 Well, Apple II was the person of the year?

08:38.800 --> 08:40.480
 Yeah, for my magazine back.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.520
 And I don't remember when,

08:41.520 --> 08:42.800
 but it was around that same time.

08:42.800 --> 08:46.480
 I was so young, but I had, there was the Apple II

08:46.480 --> 08:48.880
 and I didn't know what it was, but I knew about tools

08:48.880 --> 08:50.640
 because my grandfather taught me all about tools

08:50.640 --> 08:53.040
 and creating things, right?

08:53.680 --> 08:57.920
 And I saw this thing and I had that IBM experience,

08:57.920 --> 08:59.040
 that terminal experience.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.600
 And I'm like, oh, I could have that at home, right?

09:01.600 --> 09:02.960
 And so I need to have that at home.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.800
 And the only thing that was really talked about

09:04.800 --> 09:06.800
 in our circles was the Apple II.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.080
 And I was just like, that's it.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.120
 So I jumped up and down.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.480
 It was very expensive.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.200
 I have to have this.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.320
 My parents are like, what?

09:14.320 --> 09:19.120
 You know, it was $2,500 back then in the 1981.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.880
 It was like crazy, right?

09:20.880 --> 09:22.880
 So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money

09:22.880 --> 09:23.760
 as I can this summer.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.040
 And my grandfather said,

09:25.040 --> 09:27.440
 because he helped me learn all about tools

09:27.440 --> 09:28.960
 and build things together,

09:28.960 --> 09:30.640
 I will match whatever you make

09:30.640 --> 09:32.080
 so you can get this computer.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.480
 So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy,

09:36.480 --> 09:40.880
 cadding actually for the families at the country clubs

09:40.880 --> 09:43.280
 in the town where we lived.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.360
 And did whatever I could.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.240
 And that end of that summer got my Apple II.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.080
 And you couldn't tear it away from me.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.560
 It was my friend, it was everything.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.480
 From a product perspective,

09:54.480 --> 09:57.760
 what do you remember that was brilliant,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.960
 the design choices, the ideas behind it?

10:00.960 --> 10:02.640
 Or is it just that it exists?

10:02.640 --> 10:05.040
 Or the very idea of a personal computer

10:05.040 --> 10:06.400
 is the brilliant design choice.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.880
 Yeah, it was that I could actually have

10:08.880 --> 10:10.800
 this kind of tool in my house

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
 and I could use it any time I wanted.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.160
 I could program it anyways.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.280
 There was no, you know,

10:15.280 --> 10:16.560
 there was no internet connection.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.640
 There was no, it was all just you.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.600
 You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.240
 Or you created yourself.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.680
 And then there was the whole other thing

10:25.680 --> 10:27.360
 which was started happening,

10:27.360 --> 10:28.320
 which we were doing,

10:28.320 --> 10:30.240
 and this was kind of like MP3 and stuff,

10:30.240 --> 10:32.080
 we were sharing software, right?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.920
 So you built this community of sharing software.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.600
 You would go and pirate,

10:35.600 --> 10:36.400
 that was what we called,

10:36.400 --> 10:37.680
 pirate all this software.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.560
 You never use it all,

10:38.560 --> 10:40.240
 but it was just that fun thing of like,

10:40.240 --> 10:41.680
 I'm gonna get all this other stuff

10:41.680 --> 10:44.000
 and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it

10:44.000 --> 10:45.520
 and see behind the scenes.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.480
 So you really had a sense this was your world

10:48.480 --> 10:50.160
 and you owned it, right?

10:50.160 --> 10:52.400
 And you could like literally go into every register.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.840
 We didn't have all those security layers

10:53.840 --> 10:55.040
 so like we do not like,

10:55.040 --> 10:56.480
 you could really touch bits

10:56.480 --> 10:57.440
 and you could poke bits

10:57.440 --> 10:59.120
 and you could make this light turn on.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.760
 And, you know, and the geek assignment just lit up.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.880
 Now you, there's, it's so abstract.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.320
 You know, people don't even understand.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.520
 Like usually, you know,

11:07.520 --> 11:09.040
 some programs don't even understand memory.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.640
 They just think it's unlimited, right?

11:10.640 --> 11:11.280
 Yeah.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.280
 And security, it's like,

11:13.280 --> 11:15.920
 now there's all this security that you should have,

11:15.920 --> 11:19.040
 but it's like the adults all showed up to the party

11:19.040 --> 11:21.280
 and now you can't have all the fun, right?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.640
 It's like, no, no.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.160
 You know, this was the thing where

11:24.160 --> 11:26.240
 if the power went out,

11:26.240 --> 11:27.440
 you lost your whole program.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.880
 You might've worked a whole day on it

11:28.880 --> 11:31.600
 and if you didn't press save at every other line

11:31.600 --> 11:33.200
 and you were saved, save, save,

11:33.200 --> 11:35.520
 and it would like grind, grind the disc drive

11:35.520 --> 11:36.240
 or the tape drive.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.520
 Like, every single step was contemplated

11:41.520 --> 11:44.080
 because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.360
 So a lot of the magic was in the software.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.800
 The fact that you could have software,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.920
 the fact that you could share software

11:51.920 --> 11:53.880
 the community around the software,

11:53.880 --> 11:55.520
 it wasn't necessarily the hardware.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.800
 Well, that was the first step,

11:56.800 --> 11:58.840
 the second step around the hardware

11:58.840 --> 12:01.240
 was I got things like the mockingboard,

12:01.240 --> 12:03.840
 which the mockingboard paired with the music construction

12:03.840 --> 12:06.360
 said you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes

12:06.360 --> 12:09.120
 and it was a synthesizer in the Apple too.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.000
 So you would plug in this card and you go,

12:11.000 --> 12:12.080
 oh my God, look at this.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.720
 And it would, you know, you could start generating

12:14.720 --> 12:17.640
 cool sounds, you know, like it was a Moog,

12:17.640 --> 12:20.320
 you know, like a Moog in a way, early Moog.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.760
 What year are we talking about?

12:21.760 --> 12:25.840
 This is 82, I think, 81, 82.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.560
 And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds

12:28.560 --> 12:30.320
 that are very cool in the 80s.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.720
 Yeah, the eight bit, you know, chip tunes, right?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.480
 Chip tunes, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.040
 And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick,

12:38.040 --> 12:40.400
 you had to pull a chip out and you had to like plug in

12:40.400 --> 12:42.320
 a dip socket to put in a joystick.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.000
 And then I was like, oh, and then I had to get more memory.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.920
 How do we do that?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.440
 And now I wanted to speed up product.

12:47.440 --> 12:51.960
 So then that turned into a company, actually, from that.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.680
 But it was in a hardware software, no one at that.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.000
 But it was all about, you know, modifying this thing

12:57.000 --> 12:57.840
 in every way.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.680
 First was software.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.200
 And then you started gaining confidence.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.920
 And then I got a little bit more money and stuff.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.320
 And then you could get into the hardware and, you know,

13:04.320 --> 13:05.160
 wire things.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.320
 And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?

13:09.320 --> 13:12.600
 So in the back, in the early Apple IIs,

13:12.600 --> 13:14.960
 you could open up and all the schematics were there.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.080
 You purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.600
 Yeah, it came with it.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.400
 That's an interesting choice.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.080
 That's an interesting choice from a company perspective.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.600
 Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.440
 Right.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.760
 I wonder what they, so that was intentional.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.080
 Like this is. Absolutely intentional.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.320
 This is for the cutting edge folks too.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
 Or especially for the cutting edge.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.160
 It was only the cutting edge.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.080
 It was geeks for geeks.

13:41.080 --> 13:41.920
 Yeah.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.120
 So we were like, oh, how did they make it?

13:43.120 --> 13:45.120
 And then we got to learn through that.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.320
 Apple I did the same thing, right?

13:46.320 --> 13:48.640
 It just, Apple II became more packaged up

13:48.640 --> 13:52.000
 and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.280
 Came with basic and then, you know, so, so it was really,

13:55.280 --> 13:58.640
 it was, it was what we might think of as a raspberry pie today

13:58.640 --> 14:01.840
 or something like that, but not with so much software.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.920
 It was literally, and all the chips were out there.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.080
 So you could inspect the buses and the, right?

14:06.080 --> 14:08.320
 Cause everything was just broken out.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.320
 So I guess that's the idea behind stable big projects

14:13.840 --> 14:15.880
 and open source like on GitHub.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.240
 That you have the schematics there

14:18.240 --> 14:20.520
 and it's, it's kind of a product.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.640
 But I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing.

14:23.640 --> 14:28.640
 Like we're going to release this to a small set of people,

14:29.120 --> 14:33.880
 self selected, perhaps, that are kind of the makers,

14:33.880 --> 14:36.520
 the cutting edge folks, the builders,

14:36.520 --> 14:38.640
 the at home engineers.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.560
 Like in some way, what Tesla is doing with the beta

14:43.560 --> 14:47.480
 for the full self driving is kind of like that.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.000
 It's like selecting a group of people,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.680
 but that has to do more with you,

14:51.680 --> 14:54.360
 how safe of a driver you are versus how much

14:54.360 --> 14:56.880
 of a tinkerer you are because you don't get to tinker.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.000
 I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
 for really cutting edge technologies,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.520
 especially you're interested in like hardware stuff.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.840
 Is that crazy?

15:06.840 --> 15:10.200
 Why don't more companies do that kind of thing you think?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.560
 I think back then it was about a community

15:13.560 --> 15:15.800
 and serving that community of builders.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.160
 Now this is about people who want to take,

15:18.160 --> 15:20.760
 get the experience and want it really simple and easy.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.400
 And they're like, and so there's the audience

15:24.400 --> 15:26.160
 or they believe the audience is small

15:26.160 --> 15:27.720
 who would value those other things

15:27.720 --> 15:29.080
 that we're just talking about.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.960
 But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi

15:30.960 --> 15:33.720
 and all of these other little boards, right,

15:33.720 --> 15:36.840
 there's a whole world more than I've seen.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.960
 Like it's amazing what you can do now

15:38.960 --> 15:42.920
 with these little kits and the software that's created.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.200
 And so there's a whole nother,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.520
 I think another batch of makers and builders

15:47.520 --> 15:49.080
 that are coming up through the ranks.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.640
 And if we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right,

15:51.640 --> 15:53.240
 they take these little boards, they hack them,

15:53.240 --> 15:56.640
 then they print out the parts on their 3D printer,

15:56.640 --> 15:59.480
 assemble them and they create robots and what have you.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.880
 So I think it's happening.

16:01.880 --> 16:06.880
 It's just not as, it's just not as, I guess, raw

16:07.240 --> 16:09.960
 as it used to be, but it's there.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.840
 And it's really expanding around the world.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.280
 And that's really nice to see

16:13.280 --> 16:16.400
 because it's a whole new generation who can,

16:16.400 --> 16:17.600
 who are empowered.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.240
 I think there's a semi dormant genius amongst millions.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.560
 So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.080
 It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised

16:26.080 --> 16:28.280
 if it's several million Raspberry Pi's

16:28.280 --> 16:30.000
 that have been sold.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.600
 I think more than that.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.360
 And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius,

16:36.360 --> 16:37.560
 brewing of engineers.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.000
 We don't get to hear it because they're not organized.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.280
 I mean, we get to hear it through Inklings here and there.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.720
 Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities

16:44.720 --> 16:45.680
 that are local and so on.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.160
 But if they were organized,

16:49.840 --> 16:51.760
 if a leader would emerge, no.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.000
 Okay, so when did you first start to dream

16:55.000 --> 16:58.560
 about building your own things,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.320
 designing your own products,

17:01.320 --> 17:05.120
 designing your own systems and software and hardware?

17:05.120 --> 17:09.080
 Well, in high school, there was a company

17:09.080 --> 17:12.320
 that a friend of mine founded

17:12.320 --> 17:13.560
 and I was the second employee,

17:13.560 --> 17:15.680
 it was called Quality Computers.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.240
 And it was a mail order, mail order,

17:19.240 --> 17:20.400
 cause there's no eCommerce then,

17:20.400 --> 17:21.760
 there was no internet again.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.560
 You either mailed in your little coupon

17:23.560 --> 17:25.320
 and you said, this is what I wanted to order

17:25.320 --> 17:28.800
 or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
 Turn around time and this stuff was like,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.440
 from the time you wanted, the time you bought,

17:32.440 --> 17:34.480
 it was maybe eight to 12 weeks.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.360
 And that was just the normal way of getting things.

17:37.360 --> 17:42.360
 So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple too.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.520
 And it was software and all kinds of accessories.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.040
 So hardware accessories, so hardware,

17:48.040 --> 17:50.600
 plug in cards, joysticks, all this stuff.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.840
 And what we noticed was

17:54.840 --> 17:57.560
 there were accelerators and memory cards.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.600
 And to be able to use those cards,

18:00.600 --> 18:03.720
 you had to actually go and change the software you used

18:03.720 --> 18:05.440
 to access this new memory.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.960
 So you literally have to go and you took the program

18:07.960 --> 18:09.320
 that you had, let's say it was Appleworks,

18:09.320 --> 18:11.280
 which was like an early Microsoft office

18:11.280 --> 18:12.560
 or something like that.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.840
 And you had to literally change the code

18:15.840 --> 18:18.040
 and you would install all these patches

18:18.040 --> 18:20.360
 to then take advantage of the hardware.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.520
 So what we started creating was software on top of it

18:23.520 --> 18:27.760
 to do the automatic installation of all of these patches.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.520
 So we made it much easier to take new hardware

18:30.520 --> 18:33.360
 and then end the existing software you have

18:33.360 --> 18:35.360
 and expand it into this new world.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.520
 So it was creating tools

18:36.520 --> 18:38.280
 and that really great customer support.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.960
 And we started getting a lot of orders

18:40.960 --> 18:43.560
 because we had the software make it easier to install

18:43.560 --> 18:45.480
 to give them the superpower.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.120
 And at the same time,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
 they would be able to change their software

18:51.000 --> 18:53.160
 and have a new world that wasn't existing

18:53.160 --> 18:56.440
 from the companies that were creating the initial products.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.000
 And so it was more of that.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.760
 And then that happened with hard drives.

19:00.760 --> 19:04.640
 So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II

19:04.640 --> 19:07.440
 to like read, cause you could get really fragmented.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.840
 So I wrote that piece of software

19:08.840 --> 19:10.120
 and we sold that through the company

19:10.120 --> 19:13.000
 along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
 So that all happened in 12th grade freshman year of college.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.200
 You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.040
 For the Apple II.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.760
 Yeah, between 12th and freshman year.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.440
 What programming language do you remember?

19:28.440 --> 19:29.280
 Is it assemblies?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.120
 Is it supposed to?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.080
 There were certain inner loops were assembly

19:32.080 --> 19:35.280
 and other loops actually there were really early Pascal.

19:35.280 --> 19:39.560
 No, C, C compilers.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.440
 What was the motivation behind these?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.800
 Is it to make people's lives easier?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.680
 Is it to create a thing, experience

19:45.680 --> 19:47.800
 that is simpler and simpler and simpler,

19:47.800 --> 19:50.480
 thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?

19:50.480 --> 19:52.960
 Like what, or did you just like the Tinker?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.440
 No, no, no, it was two things really.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.480
 Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware

19:56.480 --> 19:57.640
 and software, right?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.880
 So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.040
 And then the other thing was,

20:01.040 --> 20:03.720
 because I was also manning the customer support line.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.600
 People would call in and go, this doesn't work.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.160
 And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware

20:08.160 --> 20:09.120
 and software, right?

20:09.120 --> 20:10.840
 Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware

20:10.840 --> 20:12.400
 and the installation process better.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.960
 So my whole world was out of box experience

20:15.960 --> 20:18.480
 from when I was in high school.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.600
 Cause I had to man the customer support line,

20:20.600 --> 20:22.960
 pack the boxes and write some of the code

20:22.960 --> 20:24.680
 while we were doing, well, Joe,

20:24.680 --> 20:27.080
 Joe Gleason, who was the founder of quality computers,

20:27.080 --> 20:30.120
 he was off doing the mark, the ads,

20:30.120 --> 20:32.320
 placing the ads for the mail order,

20:32.320 --> 20:35.320
 making sure we were running the credit cards, right?

20:35.320 --> 20:36.840
 It was two of us.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.240
 And then it turned into a third,

20:38.240 --> 20:39.960
 and then we hired another person from high school

20:39.960 --> 20:41.720
 to like pack boxes so I could stay

20:41.720 --> 20:44.520
 on the customer support line or doing the software, right?

20:44.520 --> 20:47.640
 And it was all in his parents basement, right?

20:47.640 --> 20:50.240
 As you were scaling exponentially.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.640
 Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.360
 So we'll jump around a little bit,

20:54.360 --> 20:56.480
 but what were the, you said you love music.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.720
 What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod

20:59.720 --> 21:01.100
 if we jumped forward?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.800
 And how far back do those ideas stretch?

21:06.800 --> 21:09.600
 You know, if you look at the history of technology,

21:11.280 --> 21:14.600
 there's, I mean, not just the product,

21:14.600 --> 21:17.960
 but the idea is truly revolutionary.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.220
 Maybe it's time has come,

21:21.220 --> 21:25.760
 but just if you look at the arc of history,

21:25.760 --> 21:28.880
 instead of music, it's so fundamental

21:28.880 --> 21:30.800
 to who we are as a humanity.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.160
 To be able to put that in your pocket,

21:34.160 --> 21:36.560
 make it truly portable is fascinating.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.180
 In a way that's truly portable.

21:40.180 --> 21:44.040
 So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman

21:44.040 --> 21:45.160
 or something like that.

21:45.160 --> 21:49.760
 So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?

21:49.760 --> 21:53.040
 You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.760
 Just love music from, I think, second grade

21:55.760 --> 21:58.200
 when I got my first albums and stuff like that.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.680
 What kind of music were we talking about?

21:59.680 --> 22:04.000
 So this was Led Zeppelin.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.320
 This was the Stones, Hendricks, Aerosmith,

22:10.640 --> 22:14.120
 Cheap Trick, Sticks, Ted Nugent, you know,

22:14.120 --> 22:19.120
 just the real American and British rock and roll, right?

22:19.120 --> 22:20.600
 There's a bunch of people listening right now.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.920
 Who's that?

22:21.920 --> 22:22.760
 Who's that?

22:22.760 --> 22:24.120
 Led Zeppelin, what is that?

22:24.120 --> 22:24.960
 Is that for you?

22:24.960 --> 22:25.800
 Okay.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.640
 Okay.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.440
 It drove my parents crazy.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.280
 Yeah.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.680
 You just blasted it loud.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.920
 Loud, just.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.120
 And this was second, third grade, fourth grade.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.160
 I just fell in love.

22:36.160 --> 22:40.560
 And then we moved back to Detroit

22:40.560 --> 22:43.040
 and I love listening to the radio station

22:43.040 --> 22:45.000
 because there was all kinds of crazy music

22:45.000 --> 22:47.400
 because you'd have an amalgam of rock

22:47.400 --> 22:48.760
 and then funk and R&B.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.360
 And I loved to listen at night.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.720
 So I had a clock radio.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.200
 But if I had the clock radio on, everyone,

22:55.200 --> 22:58.800
 parents go, go to sleep, stop that, turn that stuff off.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.280
 So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.720
 Nice.

23:03.720 --> 23:04.560
 Right?

23:04.560 --> 23:06.320
 So I said, oh, okay.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.200
 And then I could listen to it all night

23:09.200 --> 23:10.400
 and no one could hear me, right?

23:10.400 --> 23:12.280
 And I could just sit there and, you know.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.840
 Just huddling around the radio.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.680
 Groove out.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.760
 Just listening to Zeppelin.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.560
 There we're to heaven.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.760
 What would you say is the greatest rock,

23:20.760 --> 23:23.040
 the classic rock song of all time?

23:23.040 --> 23:25.480
 Greatest classic rock song of all time.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.520
 Well, pops into mind.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.680
 Well, no, you know what?

23:27.680 --> 23:29.680
 I mean, this has to be objectively number one.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.520
 That's really hard, dude.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.360
 This is so hard.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.600
 Now you have to, this is a serious journalistic interview.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.880
 You're not going to back down

23:35.880 --> 23:36.960
 from these kinds of questions.

23:36.960 --> 23:37.880
 Oh my God.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.720
 No, I don't know.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.560
 What a challenge.

23:39.560 --> 23:40.840
 Yeah, it's hard to pick.

23:40.840 --> 23:45.640
 But to me, stairway to heaven is a safe fall.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.840
 It's like, it's so often considered

23:47.840 --> 23:49.680
 to be one of the greatest songs of all time

23:49.680 --> 23:51.720
 that you almost don't want to pick it.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.560
 Right, exactly.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.480
 But you've returned to it time and time again.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.120
 And it's like, yeah, this is something pretty special.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.760
 This is a rock opera of sorts.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.160
 Well, the rock opera that really blew me away

24:03.160 --> 24:04.760
 and still continues to blow me away

24:04.760 --> 24:07.280
 is all of Dark Side of the Moon.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.520
 Like that.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.040
 I love Zeppelin.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.160
 I can't say which one's better.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.960
 But Dark Side of the Moon for me was,

24:13.960 --> 24:16.840
 it was a, you know, audio experience, right?

24:16.840 --> 24:18.240
 The whole thing from soup to nuts,

24:18.240 --> 24:21.360
 plus all the synthesizers, all of those things.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.800
 Okay, so back to the iPod.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.560
 So that's, you from the early age, you loved music.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.600
 Loved it.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.440
 Absolutely loved it.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.160
 And, you know, always was just around it and always,

24:31.160 --> 24:33.600
 I just, it was always playing, you know,

24:34.480 --> 24:37.840
 I played it so loud that I actually heard the hearing

24:37.840 --> 24:39.680
 in my right ear.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
 And I still suffer from that today.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.000
 And then.

24:43.000 --> 24:43.840
 No regrets.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.920
 No regrets whatsoever.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.520
 Going to concerts and downtown Detroit

24:47.520 --> 24:48.360
 and all the crazy stuff.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.680
 So moving forward.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.000
 So in college, I was a DJ.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.680
 So I would DJ and hang out and play all the tunes I love

24:58.680 --> 25:01.080
 and whatever for the crowd.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.680
 And then I continued to do that in Silicon Valley

25:03.680 --> 25:06.800
 when I moved right after school.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.280
 And so I was belugging all of these CDs around with me.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.360
 A thousand CDs to write.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.760
 And at the same time, and so those were heavy.

25:16.760 --> 25:20.360
 And at the same time I was doing the Philips Nino and Velo.

25:20.360 --> 25:24.000
 Those were Windows CE based mobile computing products.

25:25.320 --> 25:28.040
 The Nino was the first device

25:28.040 --> 25:30.480
 to actually put Audible books on tape.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.480
 So we worked with Audible, we met in a conference

25:33.480 --> 25:35.160
 and they were like, we don't want to do hardware,

25:35.160 --> 25:36.200
 we just want to do content.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.960
 I was like, well, we have this device,

25:37.960 --> 25:39.600
 let's get it together.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.160
 And we got Audible on that.

25:41.160 --> 25:46.160
 And this was in 96 or seven, first Audible books.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.440
 And it, you know, I was like, oh my God, that's audio.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.840
 Well, what if we put music on it?

25:51.840 --> 25:52.680
 Right?

25:52.680 --> 25:56.200
 And so, and the memory was very small at the time, right?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.840
 There was almost no flash.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.680
 It was all DRAM.

25:58.680 --> 26:03.160
 When you did Audible, you stored it in DRAM, right?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.800
 Which was okay probably

26:04.800 --> 26:09.800
 because how much books do you need is the idea.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.960
 By the way, brilliant, I mean, just putting books.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.640
 I know it's probably not the sexiest of things,

26:15.640 --> 26:20.640
 but putting books on a mobile device is a brilliant step.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.400
 I don't know, sometimes can't measure

26:25.400 --> 26:29.160
 how much human progress occurred because of an invention.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.080
 Like there's the sexy, big products, but you never know.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.400
 Like Wikipedia is one of those things

26:34.400 --> 26:37.360
 that doesn't get enough, I think, credit

26:37.360 --> 26:39.720
 for the transformational effects it has.

26:39.720 --> 26:43.200
 It's not seen as the sexiest of products, but maybe it is.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.480
 When you look at human history, Wikipedia arguably

26:47.480 --> 26:51.920
 is one of the big things that basically unlocked

26:51.920 --> 26:52.760
 human knowledge.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.400
 Human knowledge and human editing and human, you know,

26:55.400 --> 26:59.480
 just the human nature of building something together.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.320
 Yeah.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.560
 So it's fascinating.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.960
 Sometimes you can't measure those things,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.920
 maybe until many, many decades later.

27:04.920 --> 27:05.920
 Anyway, sorry.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.200
 So that was the Nino, that was there.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.800
 And then there was Audible, the books.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.400
 Why not put music?

27:13.400 --> 27:16.600
 Music, and I'm carrying around the music for the DJ gigs

27:16.600 --> 27:19.400
 and you're like, wait a second, two and two together, right?

27:19.400 --> 27:20.640
 Like, let's get rid of this.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.120
 And so, and then MP3 show up.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.440
 The actual, like encode.

27:24.440 --> 27:29.200
 The format, MP3 showed up around 97, 98.

27:29.200 --> 27:33.120
 So MP3 is compressed so you can have,

27:34.080 --> 27:35.800
 like the storage is reduced significantly.

27:35.800 --> 27:39.400
 Right, so you could go from a, you know, a large full,

27:39.400 --> 27:43.440
 a lossless, you know, digital track

27:43.440 --> 27:47.720
 into something that can be stored in four to eight megabytes,

27:47.720 --> 27:49.120
 something like that for the audio.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.280
 Now, you know, that's a reduced quality,

27:51.280 --> 27:52.360
 but you could get it down there.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.160
 And you're like, oh, okay.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.520
 And now if we have enough flash or DRAM,

27:56.520 --> 28:00.440
 we can put 10, 15, what have you all in that same memory.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.800
 And it starts to replicate a CD.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.040
 And then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive,

28:05.040 --> 28:07.720
 you could start to put, you know, thousands of songs.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.160
 Yeah, that's, that's also another brilliant invention.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.320
 But like people don't realize, I think,

28:12.320 --> 28:14.960
 I think people would be surprised how big

28:14.960 --> 28:17.720
 in terms of storage raw audio is.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.560
 And the fact that you can compress it, like,

28:22.720 --> 28:24.000
 I don't know what the compression is,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.800
 but it's like 10 X is very significant compression.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.720
 And still it sounds almost lossless.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.840
 Much of the chagrin of Neil Young, who does not like that.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.400
 But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about

28:37.400 --> 28:40.680
 is still tiny files relative to the raw.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.680
 So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more,

28:43.680 --> 28:44.760
 a little bit more.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.840
 But it's still, that's an invention.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.400
 That's a thing that unlocks your ability

28:49.400 --> 28:52.360
 to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.880
 Because without that, there's no way

28:53.880 --> 28:56.280
 you can carry on a gigantic hard drive.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.400
 Right, exactly.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.280
 And so then that, so it was MP3 is the Nino

29:01.280 --> 29:05.800
 and my hatred of carrying around all this heavy stuff

29:05.800 --> 29:09.240
 that then spawned fuses.

29:09.240 --> 29:13.880
 And then ultimately became a lot of the ideas

29:13.880 --> 29:15.640
 and things of that nature.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.320
 And my passions were born into then the iPod.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.520
 It was too, Apple needed something

29:21.520 --> 29:23.080
 and I wanted to fix something.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.760
 And it all kind of came together at this right place,

29:26.760 --> 29:29.040
 right time, plus the right technology came at this.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.400
 It was just like the stars aligned.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.480
 So how did it come to life?

29:33.480 --> 29:37.080
 The details of the stars aligning,

29:37.080 --> 29:40.320
 but the actual design, the actual engineering

29:40.320 --> 29:42.880
 of getting a device to be small,

29:42.880 --> 29:47.880
 the storage of the interface, how it looks,

29:49.120 --> 29:51.400
 the storage, the details of the software,

29:51.400 --> 29:52.480
 all that kind of stuff.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.720
 What are some interesting memories

29:54.720 --> 29:57.040
 from that design process?

29:57.040 --> 30:02.040
 What are some wisdoms you can part from that process?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.760
 Well, you know, how long do you wanna go?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.920
 Cause I have, I can go deep.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.440
 So...

30:09.440 --> 30:11.880
 Let's go at least 20 hours, let's go.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.200
 Okay, 20 hours.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.880
 This is one of the lengthy documentaries

30:14.880 --> 30:15.720
 that's making that happen.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.840
 We're gonna turn into the episodic binge, big listening.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.160
 Yeah, scheme of thrones.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.120
 So let's just start with, you know,

30:23.120 --> 30:24.680
 after I was asked to be a consultant

30:24.680 --> 30:26.400
 to put this thing together.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.440
 So I had already had knowledge of, you know,

30:28.440 --> 30:31.080
 the space and the technology and all that stuff,

30:31.080 --> 30:34.720
 but I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers

30:34.720 --> 30:36.120
 because of what I was doing at Fuse,

30:36.120 --> 30:37.320
 trying to create that thing.

30:37.320 --> 30:42.160
 So as a contractor, I was like,

30:42.160 --> 30:43.680
 okay, what is the first thing you need to do?

30:43.680 --> 30:48.560
 So after I showed a, you know, different architectures

30:48.560 --> 30:50.800
 and what three different products could be

30:50.800 --> 30:53.800
 to Steve about options for storage options,

30:53.800 --> 30:56.280
 battery options, form factor options,

30:56.280 --> 30:57.760
 there was three options.

30:57.760 --> 31:02.040
 And as I was told, given very good advice,

31:02.040 --> 31:04.560
 give to the two options you really do not like,

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
 but their options and give the best option last,

31:06.560 --> 31:08.520
 because Steve will shoot all those down

31:08.520 --> 31:10.520
 and give the best option last.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.880
 And then you could talk about that.

31:11.880 --> 31:16.880
 And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive

31:18.800 --> 31:21.880
 and a small screen, like the screen,

31:21.880 --> 31:26.840
 you know it in the original iPod, classic iPod.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.640
 And then I had enough of the idea

31:29.640 --> 31:34.640
 of the three or four different CPUs and processor suppliers

31:35.480 --> 31:37.760
 and kind of systems that were out there

31:37.760 --> 31:41.400
 that I had gone and found and put together on power supplies,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.760
 you know, disk drive interfaces,

31:43.760 --> 31:45.440
 firewire interface, all that stuff.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.680
 So I put together all of those schematics

31:48.680 --> 31:50.680
 or, you know, block diagrams, they weren't schematics yet

31:50.680 --> 31:52.040
 because it was just me.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.720
 And coming up with a bill of materials,

31:54.720 --> 31:56.280
 coming up with what it could look like,

31:56.280 --> 31:58.280
 what would be the input output,

31:58.280 --> 32:02.440
 how we could make a better headphone jack.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.760
 That was also on there.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.160
 Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.360
 So got all calculators and all kinds of electronics

32:09.360 --> 32:14.360
 to get the different sizes of small LCDs.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.360
 So I got all kinds of different battery types.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.280
 I got different types of, you know,

32:19.280 --> 32:22.400
 and different battery sizes, double A's, triple A's,

32:22.400 --> 32:24.280
 working through all the different,

32:24.280 --> 32:26.200
 and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydrate.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.880
 So I took all the battery types.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.880
 I took all of the memory types, processing types, LCD types

32:33.600 --> 32:38.200
 and connectivity and all that stuff,

32:38.200 --> 32:40.160
 not wireless but wired,

32:40.160 --> 32:44.000
 and laid out these things as Lego blocks.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.280
 So literally had all of these things as just,

32:46.280 --> 32:48.880
 and so it made them so I could like, you know,

32:48.880 --> 32:50.240
 put them together and figure out

32:50.240 --> 32:52.880
 what the compact fact, form factor would be.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.320
 Oh, like how do we shove them together?

32:55.320 --> 32:57.360
 What's the smallest possible box you can get?

32:57.360 --> 32:59.720
 So the questions without storage,

32:59.720 --> 33:03.440
 so the hard drive, batteries, double A, triple A.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.680
 Right.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.760
 Screens, so screen size and then for that,

33:07.760 --> 33:09.960
 you're tearing apart calculators.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.600
 Calculators, digital cameras, whatever

33:11.600 --> 33:12.720
 and getting little things, right?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.760
 So you can make it physical, right?

33:14.760 --> 33:17.480
 If you can make the intangible, tangible, like,

33:17.480 --> 33:19.200
 and so I can say, look, we can make this

33:19.200 --> 33:21.560
 and I brought this whole bag of goods

33:21.560 --> 33:23.600
 and it's like, shh, shh, shh, right?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.200
 And like, here's this, here's this.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.960
 This is why double A's won't work

33:26.960 --> 33:28.520
 and because it makes it too fat and everything.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.320
 So just educate everybody through,

33:30.320 --> 33:32.360
 here's the parts that we can use.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.000
 You should not cheat a paper, it's physical.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.320
 You're playing in the physical space.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.680
 Oh, well I would go back and forth.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.400
 So truth be told, because there weren't

33:39.400 --> 33:43.160
 a good enough graphical tools on the Mac,

33:43.160 --> 33:46.320
 I was using a PC with Vizio and some 3D tools

33:46.320 --> 33:47.920
 and I was doing 3D design.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.760
 At the same time, I was taking all these physical parts

33:50.760 --> 33:52.160
 and going, okay, what feels right?

33:52.160 --> 33:55.360
 So because you have to go from, you know, the details

33:55.360 --> 33:57.040
 and then the rough and you go back and forth

33:57.040 --> 33:58.280
 and you iterate, right?

33:58.280 --> 34:00.200
 And so it was just a lot of fun.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.080
 And then I ultimately ended up with a Styrofoam model

34:03.080 --> 34:07.000
 and printouts that came from Vizio that I glued together

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
 and put my grandfather's fishing weights in

34:09.000 --> 34:11.640
 because I also modeled the weights, right?

34:11.640 --> 34:13.800
 So I said, oh, this is this many ounces,

34:13.800 --> 34:15.560
 this is this many ounces in grams.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.000
 And then I went and got all that

34:17.000 --> 34:21.200
 and made the weighted these Styrofoam models

34:21.200 --> 34:22.480
 to then match that.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.440
 So when you picked it up, it felt more or less

34:24.440 --> 34:25.440
 form factor, right?

34:25.440 --> 34:27.880
 And it also, you felt how much, you know,

34:27.880 --> 34:29.560
 was it gonna be dense enough?

34:29.560 --> 34:34.040
 Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand, right?

34:34.040 --> 34:35.920
 Why does it need to feel rigid?

34:35.920 --> 34:37.640
 Because it has to feel substantial.

34:37.640 --> 34:40.920
 It has to feel like I have like a bar of gold in my hand,

34:40.920 --> 34:41.760
 right?

34:41.760 --> 34:43.360
 You know, maybe you know this,

34:43.360 --> 34:45.440
 when you open and close a car door,

34:45.440 --> 34:47.080
 you know that thunk and you go, bam,

34:47.080 --> 34:49.280
 and you go, that feels solid, that feels real.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.240
 And then you get this tinny car that's like ding

34:52.240 --> 34:54.360
 and you're like, does this feel safe?

34:54.360 --> 34:55.880
 Does this feel like a value?

34:55.880 --> 34:58.280
 And so when you have a device like that

34:58.280 --> 35:00.880
 and you wanna make sure that there's not too much air in it

35:00.880 --> 35:04.680
 that you distributed the density of the masses

35:04.680 --> 35:05.600
 in the right way.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.440
 So it feels like it's the right thing.

35:07.440 --> 35:12.000
 So you have to model battery life costs,

35:12.000 --> 35:16.080
 you know, mass sizes of different things.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.360
 And then you have to also think about

35:17.360 --> 35:19.080
 what the UI is gonna look like, right?

35:19.080 --> 35:21.160
 So you have all of these constraints you're working,

35:21.160 --> 35:22.520
 variables you're working with,

35:22.520 --> 35:24.240
 and you have to kind of, you know,

35:24.240 --> 35:26.280
 you can't get the perfect of everything.

35:26.280 --> 35:29.200
 What's the best, you know, local maximum

35:29.200 --> 35:31.280
 of all of these components that come together

35:31.280 --> 35:32.400
 to provide an experience?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.280
 Local max, it's always trade offs.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.720
 What about buttons?

35:35.720 --> 35:37.880
 Buttons, oh, there was also the buttons too, right?

35:37.880 --> 35:39.520
 Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles

35:39.520 --> 35:41.880
 fought inside your mind or is it with other people?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.720
 Is it with Steve?

35:43.720 --> 35:44.560
 Is it lower?

35:44.560 --> 35:45.400
 Like what?

35:45.400 --> 35:46.240
 This was all independent.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.520
 This was me before being able to present to Steve

35:48.520 --> 35:51.000
 because I had to feel really confident

35:51.000 --> 35:53.920
 that if I was gonna put this in front of him,

35:53.920 --> 35:55.240
 that it could be made, right?

35:55.240 --> 35:56.960
 So I had to convince myself

35:56.960 --> 35:58.560
 and go work through all the details

35:58.560 --> 36:01.320
 through like the very, very rough mechanical design,

36:01.320 --> 36:03.800
 electrical design, software things,

36:03.800 --> 36:05.240
 because I didn't wanna present something

36:05.240 --> 36:07.000
 that was gonna be fictional, right?

36:07.000 --> 36:10.160
 My credibility would be like trashed, right?

36:10.160 --> 36:12.000
 So you mentioned convince yourself,

36:13.120 --> 36:15.640
 you're painting this beautiful picture

36:15.640 --> 36:20.640
 of a driven engineer, designer, futurist.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.880
 How much doubt were you plagued by through that?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.320
 Like this is even doable,

36:26.320 --> 36:29.880
 because it's not obvious that this is even doable.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.040
 Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing,

36:33.040 --> 36:38.040
 to make it sexy, to shovel the screen,

36:38.040 --> 36:41.320
 the batteries, the storage, to make the interface,

36:41.320 --> 36:43.880
 the hardware and the software interface work, all of that.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.040
 I mean, I don't know, I would be overwhelmed

36:46.040 --> 36:49.160
 by the doubt of that, because so many things have to work,

36:49.160 --> 36:50.440
 but the supply chain.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.440
 Like at that point, I wasn't getting into any

36:52.440 --> 36:54.040
 of those details or anything.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.640
 There's the basic stuff that you have to put together.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.640
 And then you have to, through my learnings at General Magic

37:00.640 --> 37:04.480
 and my learnings at Phillips and delivering multiple,

37:04.480 --> 37:06.680
 large scale programs and manufacturing,

37:06.680 --> 37:09.400
 you kind of get a rule of thumb and you know what to focus on

37:09.400 --> 37:12.240
 at the beginning and what not to worry about over time.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.560
 Like when I was early in my career,

37:13.560 --> 37:15.720
 I worried about everything on the engineering details

37:15.720 --> 37:18.560
 so much so that I would be a nervous wreck.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.520
 Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out

37:20.520 --> 37:22.520
 and figure out what to prioritize.

37:22.520 --> 37:26.120
 And so 10 years later, I was able to do a much better job

37:26.120 --> 37:28.240
 of filtering out the things of like,

37:28.240 --> 37:30.520
 we'll get to that in weeks to come.

37:30.520 --> 37:34.920
 But right now, we got to solve the very important things,

37:34.920 --> 37:38.000
 which is could this actually be something real

37:38.000 --> 37:41.520
 and that you could deliver enough battery life, right?

37:41.520 --> 37:45.640
 Enough of an interface of the right cost, right?

37:45.640 --> 37:47.880
 And the right price point.

37:47.880 --> 37:51.520
 So you were sitting on a track record of successes

37:51.520 --> 37:54.360
 and failures in your own mind where you had

37:54.360 --> 37:58.320
 sort of already a confidence, a calmness.

37:58.320 --> 38:02.360
 But still, was there a doubt that you can get this done?

38:02.360 --> 38:03.360
 Always.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.160
 Always, always.

38:05.160 --> 38:08.440
 How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence

38:08.440 --> 38:10.280
 to a level where you could present it to Steve

38:10.280 --> 38:12.280
 and actually believe that this is doable?

38:13.440 --> 38:15.280
 Like what, do you remember when you felt...

38:15.280 --> 38:16.120
 Yeah, that moment?

38:16.120 --> 38:16.960
 Yeah.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.480
 I think it was after I triple checked,

38:19.480 --> 38:22.480
 I couldn't bring anyone in, right?

38:22.480 --> 38:24.440
 I couldn't let anyone in on this.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.880
 So it was just me.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.040
 Are they gonna trample on it?

38:27.040 --> 38:27.880
 That kind of thing, why?

38:27.880 --> 38:29.520
 No, no, no, because I couldn't bring any,

38:29.520 --> 38:31.200
 when I mean bring anyone in on this.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.040
 One, it was a highly confidential program

38:33.040 --> 38:33.880
 inside of Apple.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.480
 There was like four people who knew about it, right?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.160
 And so I couldn't bring anyone from Apple

38:38.160 --> 38:40.040
 because I was a contractor.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.080
 I couldn't bring anyone else from the outside world.

38:42.080 --> 38:45.440
 I worked for Apple and I'm under this crazy NDA, right?

38:45.440 --> 38:46.520
 In this contract.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.680
 So it was just, so I'm doing this.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.320
 Oh, and at the same time, I'm also buying

38:52.320 --> 38:54.120
 every competitive product, MP3 player

38:54.120 --> 38:55.880
 and tearing them all apart, right?

38:55.880 --> 38:58.120
 Tore them all apart and looking at them

38:58.120 --> 39:00.040
 and trying to learn from those as well.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.280
 So it was all of this stuff in six weeks.

39:02.280 --> 39:05.320
 So I didn't sleep, right?

39:05.320 --> 39:06.360
 Yeah, yeah.

39:06.360 --> 39:09.320
 But I was like, because I was trying to make this,

39:09.320 --> 39:12.720
 I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?

39:12.720 --> 39:15.200
 And I was like, oh my God, right?

39:15.200 --> 39:17.120
 But there was another doubt that I had

39:17.120 --> 39:19.480
 and it wasn't just, could you make the product?

39:19.480 --> 39:24.480
 But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?

39:25.120 --> 39:27.160
 Because Apple was not the same company

39:28.720 --> 39:31.480
 that you know it today in 2001.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.800
 Really, it was cautious, conservative, careful.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.320
 It was barely break even.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.160
 It was worth four or $5 billion company.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.080
 Oh, so the guts required there

39:41.080 --> 39:43.040
 is not necessarily in the innovation.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.240
 It's like, this is gonna cost a lot of money

39:45.240 --> 39:47.120
 and we're gonna potentially lose all of it

39:47.120 --> 39:49.200
 because it'll be a flop.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.880
 Well, there's not just that, but there was only the Mac.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.600
 And the Mac wasn't doing very well.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.840
 There was less, it was about a 1% only

39:57.840 --> 40:01.040
 in the US market share for the Mac, right?

40:01.040 --> 40:02.680
 The company was in debt.

40:02.680 --> 40:07.600
 Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?

40:07.600 --> 40:09.800
 Michael Dell at the time was saying,

40:09.800 --> 40:11.480
 shut down the company and give the money

40:11.480 --> 40:12.960
 back to the shareholders.

40:13.880 --> 40:17.360
 So this is not the company that people go,

40:17.360 --> 40:18.880
 oh my God, the iPhone came out.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.600
 It's a very different level of confidence

40:20.600 --> 40:24.280
 and financial situation that the company was in

40:24.280 --> 40:25.560
 versus the iPod.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.600
 So given that, what was the conversation

40:27.600 --> 40:31.800
 when you finally presented to Steve, what was

40:31.800 --> 40:33.240
 that conversation like?

40:34.280 --> 40:37.880
 The conversation was, well, we went through it,

40:37.880 --> 40:40.800
 the presentation and all that stuff happened.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.440
 And he was just like, and he never,

40:43.440 --> 40:45.520
 he would flip through it real quick,

40:45.520 --> 40:47.200
 throw the presentation aside and said,

40:47.200 --> 40:49.720
 okay, let's talk about this, right?

40:49.720 --> 40:51.360
 And so we went through it all.

40:51.360 --> 40:55.640
 And one was a big conversation about Sony.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.760
 And Sony was the number one in all audio categories,

40:59.760 --> 41:03.280
 home, portable, in the world, okay?

41:04.280 --> 41:06.760
 I had been already gone through 10 years of failure

41:06.760 --> 41:07.600
 and I was like, wait a second,

41:07.600 --> 41:09.240
 how are we gonna compete with Sony?

41:10.560 --> 41:13.560
 And I was always worried that Sony was gonna come out

41:13.560 --> 41:15.400
 with whatever it was that they were gonna come out with,

41:15.400 --> 41:19.200
 they're an MP3 player and that was it, game over, right?

41:20.080 --> 41:24.160
 And so I was like, Steve, and this is why it took me

41:24.160 --> 41:27.960
 four weeks to finally sign on to join Apple

41:27.960 --> 41:32.080
 after he green lighted the iPod program in that meeting,

41:32.080 --> 41:35.200
 was because I had built other things in the past

41:35.200 --> 41:36.840
 at Philips, the Nino and Velo,

41:36.840 --> 41:38.840
 but they didn't know how to sell it or market it.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.440
 They didn't know how to retail it, right?

41:41.440 --> 41:42.880
 So I was like, we could build this.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.160
 And I was like, Steve, I'm pretty sure I can build this.

41:45.160 --> 41:49.080
 I've done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?

41:49.080 --> 41:51.480
 You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.240
 And he looked at me and he goes, you build this

41:54.240 --> 41:58.240
 with a team and our team and Apple and just isn't a me, right?

41:58.240 --> 42:01.720
 And I dedicate that we will make sure

42:01.720 --> 42:04.280
 that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars

42:04.280 --> 42:07.280
 will only go to this product and nothing else, right?

42:09.680 --> 42:13.120
 Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company.

42:13.120 --> 42:15.920
 So Steve saw something special here.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.280
 Exactly.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.680
 And he said, I'm going to commit all the marketing dollars

42:19.680 --> 42:21.680
 if you can deliver the experience

42:21.680 --> 42:23.920
 that we're all talking about, if we can do that.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.320
 And that was Jeff Robin as well,

42:25.320 --> 42:28.520
 because iPod would have never happened without iTunes.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.320
 People don't understand, that was a bundle.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.720
 You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa.

42:32.720 --> 42:35.920
 So Jeff and I were, if Jeff and you can present

42:35.920 --> 42:39.680
 and bring that experience to life,

42:39.680 --> 42:41.680
 I will put all the marketing dollars behind it.

42:41.680 --> 42:46.680
 When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of,

42:46.680 --> 42:51.680
 what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?

42:52.680 --> 42:55.680
 iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?

42:55.680 --> 42:57.680
 And so Jeff Robin had his company,

42:57.680 --> 42:59.680
 oh man, I can't remember the name, but it was bought.

42:59.680 --> 43:03.680
 He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.680
 Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps like Winamp

43:07.680 --> 43:10.680
 and other things that were on the PC, real player.

43:10.680 --> 43:12.680
 And Steve saw that going on

43:12.680 --> 43:15.680
 and saw that Jeff and his small team

43:15.680 --> 43:18.680
 had this, I can't remember, sound something.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.680
 Anyways, he bought that

43:20.680 --> 43:22.680
 and that became the basis of iTunes

43:22.680 --> 43:24.680
 and then Jeff ran all of iTunes.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.680
 And so what happened specifically there

43:26.680 --> 43:28.680
 was they were starting to hook up

43:28.680 --> 43:30.680
 to all these third party MP3 players.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.680
 Because there's a lot of Korean, the MP man,

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
 like Walkman, but MP man, all these,

43:35.680 --> 43:37.680
 and they were trying to hook them up

43:37.680 --> 43:40.680
 and they were like, these are horrible experiences.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.680
 And through that, and they said,

43:42.680 --> 43:45.680
 iTunes was something that was going to help grow the Mac base

43:45.680 --> 43:48.680
 because we were trying to get more people on the Mac.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.680
 So this program would be a great new thing

43:50.680 --> 43:52.680
 you could add to the Mac.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.680
 And there was also internet connectivity at the time

43:54.680 --> 43:55.680
 for the iMac.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.680
 And so they did that

43:57.680 --> 43:59.680
 and then they're trying to do these hookups.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.680
 They weren't going well.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.680
 And that's when they said, we need to build our own.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.680
 Or Steve said, we need to build our own

44:05.680 --> 44:07.680
 since these are such horrible experiences.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.680
 People don't want to just burn CDs from iTunes.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.680
 We need to get that music on the go.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.680
 But in an Apple fashion, that's when I was called

44:15.680 --> 44:19.680
 to come in to do that, the iPod thing.

44:19.680 --> 44:22.680
 After the six weeks, then he already envisioned,

44:22.680 --> 44:24.680
 I'm sure he had it envisioned

44:24.680 --> 44:26.680
 because they were trying to do this thing.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.680
 Okay, now that's it.

44:27.680 --> 44:31.680
 iTunes, what, you know, it wasn't called iPod yet.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.680
 You know, what would become the iPod.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.680
 That is going to be the thing that then propels Apple

44:36.680 --> 44:37.680
 into this new thing

44:37.680 --> 44:39.680
 that you're going to bring all these music lovers in

44:39.680 --> 44:43.680
 that are going to need their next generation

44:43.680 --> 44:46.680
 or Sony Walkman version 2.0.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.680
 So when you look at, again,

44:48.680 --> 44:51.680
 apologies to linger on iPod,

44:51.680 --> 44:57.680
 but it's one of the great inventions in tech history.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.680
 What wisdom do you draw from that whole process

45:00.680 --> 45:03.680
 about spotting an idea?

45:03.680 --> 45:06.680
 This is something you talk about in your book,

45:06.680 --> 45:11.680
 called How do you know that an idea is brilliant?

45:11.680 --> 45:12.680
 At which stage?

45:12.680 --> 45:17.680
 When did you know it was a good idea?

45:17.680 --> 45:21.680
 And maybe is there like some phase shifts?

45:21.680 --> 45:24.680
 First, you complete doubt that maybe,

45:24.680 --> 45:26.680
 and then maybe it becomes more than a,

45:26.680 --> 45:28.680
 and becomes like a little more confidence,

45:28.680 --> 45:29.680
 that kind of stuff.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.680
 And also wisdom about who to talk to.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.680
 Right.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.680
 So they don't trample the idea in the early stages,

45:37.680 --> 45:38.680
 that kind of stuff.

45:38.680 --> 45:40.680
 Any thoughts about this?

45:40.680 --> 45:41.680
 We could go on again.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.680
 How long do you want to go?

45:43.680 --> 45:44.680
 This is a Netflix series.

45:44.680 --> 45:45.680
 I apologize.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.680
 Multi season.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.680
 So a lot of lessons learned over those years of failure

45:50.680 --> 45:55.680
 and success, but the first thing it starts with,

45:55.680 --> 45:58.680
 there's a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.680
 And so kind of goes into in build,

46:00.680 --> 46:02.680
 and it goes through kind of chapter and verse

46:02.680 --> 46:06.680
 about all of those, how Nest became into being.

46:06.680 --> 46:09.680
 But let's talk about it specifically for iPod.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.680
 Right.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.680
 So for me, I always had pain,

46:12.680 --> 46:15.680
 the pain of carrying the CDs everywhere.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.680
 Right.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.680
 And I had the joy of music.

46:18.680 --> 46:19.680
 Right.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.680
 If you could say all of a sudden I could get the music I love

46:22.680 --> 46:25.680
 all the time in a portable package,

46:25.680 --> 46:27.680
 and I can have all the music I love all the time.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.680
 I was solving a pain, which was, for me,

46:30.680 --> 46:33.680
 it was thousands of CDs, other people might be 10 or 15 CDs.

46:33.680 --> 46:34.680
 Right.

46:34.680 --> 46:38.680
 And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted.

46:38.680 --> 46:42.680
 That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.680
 And then at the end was a superpower,

46:44.680 --> 46:46.680
 an emotional superpower that said,

46:46.680 --> 46:49.680
 oh my, this is something different.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.680
 So when you can actually focus on a pain,

46:52.680 --> 46:56.680
 and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin.

46:56.680 --> 46:58.680
 So the difference between a painkiller and a vitamin

46:58.680 --> 46:59.680
 is very clear.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.680
 One, you need, I got to get rid of this pain.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.680
 A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,

47:04.680 --> 47:06.680
 maybe somebody needs it, maybe not,

47:06.680 --> 47:07.680
 it's all marketing story.

47:07.680 --> 47:08.680
 Right.

47:08.680 --> 47:10.680
 So you start with the pain, give them a painkiller,

47:10.680 --> 47:13.680
 and hopefully if you can do it in the right way,

47:13.680 --> 47:16.680
 you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower.

47:16.680 --> 47:20.680
 That is always, and that's the way to know

47:20.680 --> 47:23.680
 that you're hitting on something that's really powerful.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.680
 The pain and the joy.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.680
 Exactly.

47:26.680 --> 47:30.680
 Are you always aware of the pain?

47:30.680 --> 47:33.680
 So it seems like a lot of great products,

47:33.680 --> 47:35.680
 it's like we do a lot of painful things,

47:35.680 --> 47:39.680
 and we just kind of assume that's the way,

47:39.680 --> 47:42.680
 it's supposed to be, like with much autonomous vehicles,

47:42.680 --> 47:44.680
 we're all assume we're supposed to be driving.

47:44.680 --> 47:45.680
 Right.

47:45.680 --> 47:49.680
 Like, and it doesn't, you don't think of it as a pain.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.680
 Right.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.680
 Well, you've habituated it away.

47:52.680 --> 47:53.680
 Yeah.

47:53.680 --> 47:54.680
 You've habituated it away.

47:54.680 --> 47:58.680
 Anyway, for me, you know, when I go to other places,

47:58.680 --> 48:00.680
 living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever,

48:00.680 --> 48:04.680
 and I'm not driving, I'm walking or I'm using a scooter

48:04.680 --> 48:06.680
 or what have you, different thing.

48:06.680 --> 48:09.680
 And you go, oh my God, when you left that environment,

48:09.680 --> 48:11.680
 because everyone else is driving all the time,

48:11.680 --> 48:13.680
 you're like, that's what you do.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.680
 And you find out there's other ways of living

48:15.680 --> 48:16.680
 and there's freedom.

48:16.680 --> 48:18.680
 When you get rid of that, you're like, oh my God,

48:18.680 --> 48:21.680
 I didn't know that this was so much better.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.680
 So there's something in the book that's called out,

48:24.680 --> 48:26.680
 and I deemed it the virus of doubt.

48:26.680 --> 48:30.680
 And what the virus of doubt is, is when there's pain

48:30.680 --> 48:35.680
 and it's been habituated away, you use the right marketing messages

48:35.680 --> 48:39.680
 to bring people back to that initial experience they had

48:39.680 --> 48:41.680
 or the initial experience that they had of that pain.

48:41.680 --> 48:45.680
 Do you remember when the first time you did blah

48:45.680 --> 48:47.680
 and it felt like this?

48:47.680 --> 48:48.680
 Right.

48:48.680 --> 48:53.680
 And then you reawaken that habituated pain.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.680
 And people, and it becomes visceral.

48:56.680 --> 49:00.680
 And then they're like, oh, yes, I hate that.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.680
 And then you go, now I have the painkiller

49:03.680 --> 49:04.680
 and the joy for you.

49:04.680 --> 49:05.680
 Yes.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.680
 That's when it all comes together and it goes.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.680
 Let me, on this, on the pain and the joy

49:12.680 --> 49:17.680
 that's brilliantly put, you mentioned selling

49:17.680 --> 49:19.680
 and marketing, right?

49:19.680 --> 49:22.680
 Marketing dollars.

49:22.680 --> 49:26.680
 I have a love hate relationship with marketing.

49:26.680 --> 49:30.680
 Like with a lot of things that require artistic genius.

49:30.680 --> 49:35.680
 To me, the best marketing, I suppose, is the product itself

49:35.680 --> 49:37.680
 and then word of mouth.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.680
 So like create a thing that people love.

49:39.680 --> 49:40.680
 Oh, absolutely.

49:40.680 --> 49:41.680
 That's fundamental.

49:41.680 --> 49:42.680
 Yeah.

49:42.680 --> 49:47.680
 So any other marketing requires genius to be any extra thing.

49:47.680 --> 49:52.680
 Because every, to me, I don't, yeah.

49:52.680 --> 49:56.680
 Maybe you can, by way of question, because you're,

49:56.680 --> 50:00.680
 I'm just speaking off the top of my head as a consumer.

50:00.680 --> 50:02.680
 What is great marketing?

50:02.680 --> 50:07.680
 What does it take to reveal the pain and the joy of a thing?

50:07.680 --> 50:08.680
 Okay.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.680
 It all starts at the beginning.

50:10.680 --> 50:13.680
 And let me give you, I'm going to give you a couple of different

50:13.680 --> 50:14.680
 ways of looking at it.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
 Okay.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.680
 And again, we're going to, might go a little long here.

50:17.680 --> 50:21.680
 So just stay tuned in.

50:21.680 --> 50:22.680
 Yeah.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.680
 So the first thing is, let's start at the beginning.

50:24.680 --> 50:28.680
 In the early part of my career, you know, like General Magic

50:28.680 --> 50:30.680
 and Phillips and what have you.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.680
 And especially when I was, you know, a teenager,

50:35.680 --> 50:38.680
 when I was like doing, making my own chips and stuff like that.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.680
 I really worried about just putting cool things together.

50:42.680 --> 50:43.680
 I'm like that.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.680
 When I put those two cool things together as an engineer,

50:45.680 --> 50:47.680
 you go, that's cool.

50:47.680 --> 50:50.680
 And then I would talk to the other friends who might be geeks too.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.680
 And they go, yeah, that's cool.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.680
 Because we knew the bits.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.680
 So we put them together and that's a new way of doing it.

50:57.680 --> 51:01.680
 And you're like, wow, that's all what.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.680
 It's not why.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.680
 Why are you doing this?

51:05.680 --> 51:07.680
 We know what we're doing, but we don't know why we're doing it.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.680
 Because we're not articulating it for ourselves because it's just

51:10.680 --> 51:13.680
 something we're like putting it together and like, yeah, that's cool

51:13.680 --> 51:16.680
 because, because we think we're solving some problem we have,

51:16.680 --> 51:18.680
 but we're not really articulating it.

51:18.680 --> 51:21.680
 So what normally happens, and this happens because we invest in

51:21.680 --> 51:24.680
 so many companies around the world, you have these brilliant

51:24.680 --> 51:28.680
 engineers, designers, scientists, researchers, they put together

51:28.680 --> 51:31.680
 these, these what's.

51:31.680 --> 51:34.680
 And then they develop it, develop it, develop it.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.680
 And then at the end, they call in marketing and say, now,

51:37.680 --> 51:39.680
 tell a story about this.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.680
 And let's get it out to the world.

51:41.680 --> 51:43.680
 Okay.

51:43.680 --> 51:46.680
 What happens then is marketing is like, well, why do, why do people

51:46.680 --> 51:47.680
 need this?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.680
 Tell us why people need it.

51:49.680 --> 51:53.680
 And so they create a story around this product.

51:53.680 --> 51:56.680
 But the product was born out of what's not wise.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.680
 And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story.

51:59.680 --> 52:02.680
 And it turns out to be a fictional story usually.

52:02.680 --> 52:05.680
 They say, oh, this is going to do these things.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.680
 The product comes in, is delivered.

52:07.680 --> 52:11.680
 And it falls flat on its face because the marketing doesn't match

52:11.680 --> 52:14.680
 the product because they weren't both created at the beginning

52:14.680 --> 52:16.680
 together.

52:16.680 --> 52:17.680
 Right.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.680
 There are what's when you create a product, but there's a lot

52:20.680 --> 52:24.680
 more wise and the wise help inform the what's and the wise also

52:24.680 --> 52:26.680
 inform the marketing.

52:26.680 --> 52:31.680
 So at the, at the, that's what you mean deeply at, we should

52:31.680 --> 52:32.680
 start at the beginning.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.680
 So the designer should be also the marketer.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.680
 The engineer should be the marketer.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
 Exactly.

52:38.680 --> 52:40.680
 Stop impressing the geek next to you.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.680
 What is the superpower you're bringing or the pain you're killing

52:43.680 --> 52:46.680
 for the, your, your, the end customer.

52:46.680 --> 52:47.680
 Right.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.680
 Now let's give, let's contrast that.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.680
 Think about a movie.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.680
 A movie starts with a treatment.

52:54.680 --> 52:57.680
 It has an audience that says the audience, here's the characters,

52:57.680 --> 52:59.680
 here's the storyline, the plot.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.680
 Here's the, here's the arc of the story.

53:01.680 --> 53:02.680
 Right.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.680
 It pulls that all out.

53:04.680 --> 53:08.680
 Then there's a script that's written and that script is then

53:08.680 --> 53:11.680
 produced and then you add all the flourishes and what have you

53:11.680 --> 53:13.680
 music and graphics and what have you.

53:13.680 --> 53:14.680
 Right.

53:14.680 --> 53:17.680
 And then it comes out and then there's the marketing of the movie

53:17.680 --> 53:19.680
 and that story was created at the beginning.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.680
 What you need to do if you're going to do a great product is

53:22.680 --> 53:24.680
 create that treatment for your product.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.680
 And I call that the press release.

53:26.680 --> 53:31.680
 Do the press release like the treatment, who's the audience?

53:31.680 --> 53:33.680
 What, what features do you have?

53:33.680 --> 53:36.680
 What pains are you solving for people to have the virus of doubt

53:36.680 --> 53:39.680
 there to remind them what pains they have and why you're solving

53:39.680 --> 53:41.680
 them, the price, all of those things.

53:41.680 --> 53:47.680
 And you use that as the bar, the measuring stick for what you do

53:47.680 --> 53:48.680
 during development.

53:48.680 --> 53:52.680
 Because what happens that along the route, you know this, oh,

53:52.680 --> 53:55.680
 we're not going to be able to get that feature done on time.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.680
 That went overboard.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.680
 We got to hit the, we have to hit the date.

53:58.680 --> 54:00.680
 Oh, we're not sure this product's right yet.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.680
 Add another feature.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.680
 Add another feature creep.

54:04.680 --> 54:05.680
 Right.

54:05.680 --> 54:07.680
 If you don't have that story, you know, you're going to tell it

54:07.680 --> 54:08.680
 at the beginning.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.680
 You don't have that bar.

54:10.680 --> 54:11.680
 Right.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.680
 And then at the end, you don't know when you're done.

54:13.680 --> 54:14.680
 If you don't have that story.

54:14.680 --> 54:16.680
 So you can actually look at that press release.

54:16.680 --> 54:21.680
 You might, you know, you, you change it over time, that draft.

54:21.680 --> 54:24.680
 But then when you're done, you know the what's and the why's.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.680
 You have all the things at the audience and everything.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.680
 And then you can give that to marketing and say, well,

54:29.680 --> 54:30.680
 marketing's been along the way.

54:30.680 --> 54:31.680
 Let's be clear.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.680
 But then everybody's in sync.

54:33.680 --> 54:37.680
 And that's when you can tell a cohesive non fictional story about

54:37.680 --> 54:40.680
 and the product delivers on that story or hopefully over delivers

54:40.680 --> 54:41.680
 on that story.

54:41.680 --> 54:46.680
 So in the drafting from the beginning to the end of the

54:46.680 --> 54:49.680
 press release, what does a successful team look like?

54:49.680 --> 54:51.680
 Who's part of the draft?

54:51.680 --> 54:53.680
 Is it engineers, designers?

54:53.680 --> 54:57.680
 What, what's the purpose of a marketing department in a company?

54:57.680 --> 55:01.680
 Small, let's say small company, but more than two people.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.680
 Okay.

55:02.680 --> 55:06.680
 So from where does the why come from?

55:06.680 --> 55:09.680
 Should it always come from the designer or should there be a

55:09.680 --> 55:13.680
 marketing person that, yeah, steps in and ask the question.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.680
 So I'll just keep asking random questions.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.680
 No, these are great questions.

55:17.680 --> 55:18.680
 Okay.

55:18.680 --> 55:21.680
 So cause you're just like, I'm like, I can't wait to tell you the answer.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.680
 Um, so it's in the book as well.

55:23.680 --> 55:28.680
 But you have to separate out the various functions of marketing.

55:28.680 --> 55:31.680
 When that's what I thought I was like, marketing's marketing, you

55:31.680 --> 55:34.680
 know, when I was, and, and it's really not, there's so many

55:34.680 --> 55:37.680
 disciplines just like in engineering, mechanical, electrical

55:37.680 --> 55:39.680
 software and even software.

55:39.680 --> 55:43.680
 It's, you know, our use cloud services, firmware applications.

55:43.680 --> 55:46.680
 Marketing has that much diversity as well.

55:46.680 --> 55:47.680
 Okay.

55:47.680 --> 55:48.680
 And you have to honor that.

55:48.680 --> 55:54.680
 And so there is marketing communications like PR, press, press.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.680
 There is, um, social marketing.

55:57.680 --> 56:00.680
 There is a marketing creative, right?

56:00.680 --> 56:02.680
 There's marketing activation.

56:02.680 --> 56:08.680
 Um, but there's another thing that also comes out and people, uh,

56:08.680 --> 56:12.680
 confuse it with marketing, which is called product marketing or

56:12.680 --> 56:16.680
 product management and product management or product marketing

56:16.680 --> 56:19.680
 is the voice of the customer.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.680
 They're the person who sits there and listens to what's going on

56:23.680 --> 56:26.680
 and the competition in the marketplace, understanding the

56:26.680 --> 56:29.680
 needs and those pains of the customer and they're representing

56:29.680 --> 56:34.680
 them in every single meeting so things don't get off track.

56:34.680 --> 56:35.680
 Right.

56:35.680 --> 56:39.680
 So that, um, and they're creating the messages, not the marketing.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.680
 What happens is there's messages that product marketing creates.

56:42.680 --> 56:43.680
 Like those are the deep messages.

56:43.680 --> 56:47.680
 Like we need to save 20% of energy, let's say.

56:47.680 --> 56:48.680
 Right.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.680
 And then marketing turns that into something that's with creative

56:51.680 --> 56:53.680
 and everything and brings that message across.

56:53.680 --> 56:57.680
 Maybe it doesn't say that, but it comes maybe visually or some other way.

56:57.680 --> 57:02.680
 So product management does that and, and, and, and holds that

57:02.680 --> 57:06.680
 press release along the route and making sure that we're tracking.

57:06.680 --> 57:09.680
 And then also marketing is tracking with that press release to

57:09.680 --> 57:11.680
 make sure they're not telling a fictional story.

57:11.680 --> 57:12.680
 Right.

57:12.680 --> 57:15.680
 Cause they can also add extra adjectives or something.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.680
 And then the product can't deliver that.

57:17.680 --> 57:18.680
 It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

57:18.680 --> 57:21.680
 Keeps everybody grounded to the press release, to the raw.

57:21.680 --> 57:22.680
 Right.

57:22.680 --> 57:23.680
 To the customer needs.

57:23.680 --> 57:24.680
 Yeah.

57:24.680 --> 57:25.680
 Right.

57:25.680 --> 57:26.680
 Cause they're always representing the customer.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.680
 So you have to have a product manager.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.680
 Typically that's the founder.

57:30.680 --> 57:31.680
 Right.

57:31.680 --> 57:32.680
 In the beginning.

57:32.680 --> 57:36.680
 And then over time you hire a product management team to then

57:36.680 --> 57:40.680
 really, you know, watch over this the whole way and they are

57:40.680 --> 57:42.680
 talking to customer support.

57:42.680 --> 57:43.680
 They're talking to engineering.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.680
 They're talking to design.

57:44.680 --> 57:47.680
 They're talking to sales and marketing.

57:47.680 --> 57:51.680
 And they are always in the mix and it's the hardest thing to hire

57:51.680 --> 57:52.680
 for.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.680
 Yeah.

57:53.680 --> 57:57.680
 So it's, they have this very important job of developing, maintaining the

57:57.680 --> 57:58.680
 why.

57:58.680 --> 57:59.680
 Exactly.

57:59.680 --> 58:01.680
 Why is it the hardest to hire for?

58:01.680 --> 58:03.680
 Because you have to understand.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.680
 First, nobody reports to you.

58:05.680 --> 58:06.680
 You're alone.

58:06.680 --> 58:10.680
 So you're alone and you have to build great ties with all of these

58:10.680 --> 58:12.680
 different, these different functions.

58:12.680 --> 58:13.680
 Yeah.

58:13.680 --> 58:16.680
 You have to understand what they do, have be empathetic with what

58:16.680 --> 58:17.680
 they do.

58:17.680 --> 58:21.680
 And you have to get, have to project the customer's empathy or

58:21.680 --> 58:25.680
 empathy for the customer to them and tell them why and why this

58:25.680 --> 58:27.680
 customer needs us, why this doesn't work.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.680
 And so that they learn more.

58:29.680 --> 58:32.680
 They're not just doing, but they learn about the customer's point of

58:32.680 --> 58:36.680
 view and sit in there and stand in their shoes to be able to then

58:36.680 --> 58:39.680
 make better decisions on the engineering details or the operational

58:39.680 --> 58:41.680
 details, customer support details.

58:41.680 --> 58:46.680
 So they understand that if they're not the customer that it's

58:46.680 --> 58:50.680
 intended for, they start to live through and through their eyes and

58:50.680 --> 58:52.680
 see through their eyes of that customer.

58:52.680 --> 58:54.680
 So they make better decisions.

58:54.680 --> 58:59.680
 And there's probably fascinating, beautiful tensions between that

58:59.680 --> 59:02.680
 and sort of the engineers.

59:02.680 --> 59:03.680
 Oh, that's cool.

59:03.680 --> 59:06.680
 Sort of the, you know, developing the what?

59:06.680 --> 59:07.680
 Exactly.

59:07.680 --> 59:10.680
 And which makes it an extra hard job, I'm sure.

59:10.680 --> 59:11.680
 Exactly.

59:11.680 --> 59:14.680
 Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question?

59:14.680 --> 59:15.680
 Sure.

59:15.680 --> 59:18.680
 One subfield of marketing you mentioned comms and PR.

59:18.680 --> 59:22.680
 How do I ask this?

59:22.680 --> 59:25.680
 I can hear your struggle in your, in your sigh.

59:25.680 --> 59:37.680
 Why or do the comms and PR folks sometimes kill the heart and soul

59:37.680 --> 59:41.680
 of the magic that makes a company?

59:41.680 --> 59:43.680
 Or is that wrong to say?

59:43.680 --> 59:45.680
 Give me an example.

59:45.680 --> 59:51.680
 I will say the spirit of the example, which is it feels like often

59:51.680 --> 59:57.680
 the jobs of communications is to provide caution.

59:57.680 --> 1:00:01.680
 It almost, it almost works together with legal to say a shield.

1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:02.680
 Yeah.

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:05.680
 We should probably should not say this.

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:06.680
 We're proud.

1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:07.680
 Let's be careful.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:08.680
 Let's be careful.

1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:18.680
 Now that makes sense, except in this modern world, authenticity is

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:20.680
 extremely valuable.

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:25.680
 And revealing the beauty that is in the engineering, the beauty of

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:32.680
 the, the ideas, the chaos of the ideas, I think requires throwing caution

1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:34.680
 to the wind to some degree.

1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:35.680
 I agree.

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:42.680
 And I just find that, boy, I mean, it's a really, so to push back on

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:46.680
 myself, I think it's an extremely difficult job because people hold you

1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:51.680
 responsible if you're doing communications when you take risks.

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:52.680
 Right.

1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:54.680
 And especially when they fail.

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:57.680
 So like the, it's, it's a difficult job.

1:00:57.680 --> 1:00:59.680
 So I understand why people become cautious.

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:04.680
 But to me, communications is about taking big risks and throwing caution

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:10.680
 to the wind at its best because your job is to communicate in the

1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:18.680
 longterm, communicate the genius, the, the joy, the, the, the genius of

1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:19.680
 the product.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:20.680
 Right.

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.680
 And that sometimes is a tension with caution.

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:23.680
 Sorry.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:27.680
 So I, I, because I've gotten the chance to meet a lot of very

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:31.680
 interesting people and interesting engineering teams and so on, I look

1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:35.680
 at what they're doing and I look at what's being communicated and it's

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:39.680
 just, there's a mismatch because the communication is a lot more

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:40.680
 boring.

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:46.680
 It's like, there's something very like just straight up boring about the

1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:49.680
 way they're communicating because of caution.

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:50.680
 Okay.

1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:53.680
 And you have just teed me up for another diatribe.

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:54.680
 Okay.

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:57.680
 I'm going to get on my, I'm going to get on my podium here.

1:01:57.680 --> 1:01:58.680
 Yes, please.

1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:03.680
 Uh, it all comes out of the leader.

1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:07.680
 If the leader doesn't know how to storytell or the leader doesn't know

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:15.680
 bold storytelling, then you get even more conservatism from the PR and

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:20.680
 communications folks because they're always, so if you have a, not a bold

1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:23.680
 leader, they, they're always going to be a filter, right?

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:26.680
 They're always going to try to smooth things out and take off the rough

1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:27.680
 edges and try.

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.680
 So they're going to be even more, if you have a conservative messaging

1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:34.680
 leader, you're going to have even a more conservative communications

1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:35.680
 department.

1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:37.680
 Because they want to keep their jobs.

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:38.680
 Okay.

1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:39.680
 It's really simple.

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:40.680
 Yes.

1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:41.680
 They got to keep their jobs.

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.680
 If they say one wrong thing, it could be the end of it.

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:47.680
 So if you have very conservative leader, they're going to be even more

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:48.680
 conservative.

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:52.680
 If you have a bold leader, they will be, oh, they'll always take a little

1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:55.680
 more conservative bet, but you're still going to have bold communications.

1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:56.680
 Yeah.

1:02:56.680 --> 1:02:57.680
 That's brilliant.

1:02:57.680 --> 1:02:58.680
 Okay.

1:02:58.680 --> 1:02:59.680
 So it starts with the leader.

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:08.680
 Now that said, when you, you, you think about the messages and the joy and

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:13.680
 revealing things, right?

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:17.680
 Many of these leaders don't tell great stories.

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:22.680
 So what we do at Future Shape, our investment firm, is we take those

1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:25.680
 scientists, all of, and the great minds and everything.

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:27.680
 And what do we surround them with?

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:32.680
 Marketing and communication people and storytellers to give them the

1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:38.680
 confidence to tell a much broader story about the impacts of what they're

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:43.680
 creating and how big the global change can be with those technologies.

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:47.680
 Because usually they don't, those leaders who created those technologies,

1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:49.680
 they don't really know how to communicate really well.

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:52.680
 And they don't feel very comfortable in how they speak.

1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:53.680
 Yeah.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.680
 It's interesting because stories, I'm a huge fan of stories.

1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:59.680
 Have you ever read the book Story?

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:00.680
 Yeah.

1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:01.680
 By Robert McKee.

1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:02.680
 You should read this.

1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:05.680
 And this is what I read when I was 26.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:07.680
 Story by Robert McKee.

1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:13.680
 And it's a book all about the ways to do script writing, the prototypical

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:19.680
 types of scripts, drama, comedy, and how it's been shown over, you know,

1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:21.680
 millennia, how these stories are done.

1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:23.680
 It's a fascinating thing.

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:27.680
 And it gives you an insight to, and it's written for, you know,

1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:30.680
 obviously Hollywood and movies and things like that.

1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:35.680
 But it's incredibly useful for what we do as designers and engineers

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:37.680
 and technology, piano leaders.

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:42.680
 There's some aspect in this modern day where, you know, this podcast and so on,

1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:46.680
 that what I love is the humans behind the story too.

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:50.680
 So some part of the story is the human beings.

1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:57.680
 So humor, drama, heartbreak, hope.

1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:58.680
 Emotions.

1:04:58.680 --> 1:04:59.680
 Emotions.

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.680
 That's not just about painting a beautiful story that's flawless.

1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:06.680
 It's vulnerability.

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:07.680
 Yep.

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:14.680
 It's, you know, being a dreamer, like over promising and then failing

1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:18.680
 so changing your mind, realizing sort of just the whole of it.

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:23.680
 And then also being like, depending, of course, what your personality is,

1:05:23.680 --> 1:05:28.680
 embracing the full richness and the complexity of the personality of the leader

1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:30.680
 or the different people involved.

1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:31.680
 I mean, that's all part of it.

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:37.680
 Like, you can't just present this beautiful, always pleasantville view of a product.

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:42.680
 There has to be this humanity that's part of it.

1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:45.680
 The full rollercoaster of the humanity.

1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:49.680
 Which I think has been very difficult for companies to embrace.

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.680
 I'm not sure why.

1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:55.680
 Maybe it's just an old school way of doing things that people think, you know,

1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:02.680
 that we present the facade and, you know, we generate the story and we tell the story

1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:04.680
 as opposed to sort of...

1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:10.680
 Well, we learn, especially in the technical world, we present the story as it's faster.

1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:11.680
 It's smaller.

1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:12.680
 It's longer battery life.

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:18.680
 It's bits and numbers and metrics.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:22.680
 That resonates, sure, with other geeks.

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:26.680
 What resonates with the planet?

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:28.680
 It's all emotions, right?

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:33.680
 And if you can bring a great emotional story, but with a great rational story at the same time,

1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:35.680
 why you should do this?

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:41.680
 And it's like, oh my God, you bring that superpower, that joy, then it all hangs.

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.680
 There's personal drama too.

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:45.680
 The human.

1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:47.680
 Here's the pain I had.

1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:49.680
 Remember that thing.

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:59.680
 I mean, just, you know, you're obviously this extremely well known human being that's behind

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:03.680
 a lot of these great inventions of the technology world.

1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:05.680
 But you're also just a human being.

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:11.680
 You're actually a distinct personality that comes through.

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:12.680
 Your eyes light up.

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:16.680
 Just the way you communicate is you.

1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:18.680
 Some people are more stoic.

1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:24.680
 Some people are like, Elon is all over the place, the chaos.

1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:27.680
 Steve Jobs, you know, there's a very...

1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:28.680
 I mean, it's hard to put into words.

1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:32.680
 I can be poetic and so on, but there's a very distinct comes on stage.

1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:34.680
 You know, that personality is right there.

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:35.680
 It's just a product.

1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:36.680
 That's something else too.

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:37.680
 Correct.

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:42.680
 And like, you have to reveal that a little bit and allow people to reveal that a little

1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:45.680
 bit and just let them be themselves.

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:50.680
 Well, look, why do I think your podcast is so amazing?

1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:52.680
 Because you are yourself.

1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:57.680
 You talk about yourself, you bring your emotions into it and you don't modulate it.

1:07:57.680 --> 1:07:59.680
 You're you, right?

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:01.680
 It comes through.

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:02.680
 It's true.

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:03.680
 It feels right.

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:07.680
 You are you, you dress the way you want to dress.

1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:11.680
 You say, this is me and this is all of me and you become vulnerable, right?

1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:16.680
 It's much easier to do a podcast like that than run a very large company where a lot

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:20.680
 of people would feel the pain if you make, if you say something stupid.

1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:26.680
 So it's much more easy to be afraid and be careful.

1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:36.680
 But nevertheless, the same applies, authenticity and risk taking is the only way, unfortunately,

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:39.680
 to be successful in the long term.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.680
 Let me just because we're jumping all over the place.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:44.680
 I just link on the iPod.

1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:45.680
 Sure.

1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:50.680
 One of the great designs, broadly speaking in the word design of all time.

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:53.680
 What does it take to design a great product?

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:56.680
 If you look, who can jump around?

1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:01.680
 We can look at Nest, we can look at iPod, we can look at iPhone and many of the great things

1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:10.680
 you design, but just looking at that one transformational thing, what can you say about what it takes

1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:19.680
 to do a great design or maybe what makes a great design?

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:28.680
 Well, we talked about a painkiller and we talked about that joy that comes from it.

1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:32.680
 But then there's the behind the scenes, there's the team.

1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:37.680
 There's everyone who brings it to life, brings that story to life.

1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:43.680
 If you have a great story and you know the why, then you can communicate it to those

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:45.680
 people who are working on it.

1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:48.680
 And then they bring their own thing into it.

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:50.680
 It becomes emotional for them too.

1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:54.680
 It's not just a job, it's a mission.

1:09:54.680 --> 1:10:02.680
 And so many of the details that are born out of these early prototypes, these things that

1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:08.680
 you still haven't given full form to, there may be 80% done or maybe even 60% done, but

1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:10.680
 you can see enough in there.

1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:14.680
 Then you take those great ideas and you give the why's to the team.

1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:16.680
 And so that they feel it.

1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:18.680
 They can understand it.

1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:24.680
 Then they bring their best and their ideas to the table and then you can select from those

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.680
 and you can then start to, you know, it could be just a pixel change.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.680
 It could be a slight change on how you do the audio for the feedback or maybe a curve

1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:39.680
 on the mechanics or something like that of how it feels because everybody brings themselves

1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:41.680
 trying to, you know, feel this thing.

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:44.680
 They're not just doing something that someone told them to do.

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.680
 You can instill that mission and that why into that team.

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:49.680
 It doesn't have to be big.

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:52.680
 You get, I feel a 10X.

1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:58.680
 Everyone comes together in a special way and the magic is created.

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:00.680
 You put the love into it.

1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:02.680
 The customer feels the love on the other side.

1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:14.680
 So the making the team, like taking them in onto the vision, onto the why.

1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:20.680
 Now they feel the, all the little details we think of the original iPod and all the many

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:27.680
 generations after all those little details are in them as the emotion of the engineers

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:29.680
 and the designers that.

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:30.680
 It's their baby.

1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.680
 Working nights, struggling.

1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:33.680
 This isn't right.

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:38.680
 Like you said, changing little pixels here and there, changing, changing the shape of

1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:47.680
 things, changing the feel of things, like the materials, the, I don't know, just everything

1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:49.680
 on the soft part of the packaging.

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:51.680
 The words on the packaging.

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:52.680
 Just everything.

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:53.680
 The words on the website.

1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:58.680
 And always jumping from the very specific detail problem to the big picture how the

1:11:58.680 --> 1:11:59.680
 thing feels.

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:00.680
 The overall.

1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:01.680
 Always jumping back and forth.

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:02.680
 What does it look like to the customer?

1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:07.680
 How are we going to implement it in the most efficient way?

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:12.680
 Because a lot of the stuff you don't know is some of that stuff is hacked in.

1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:14.680
 Maybe hacked in at the end.

1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:18.680
 It may not be the most beautiful architecture that a geek would look at and go, oh my God,

1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:19.680
 that's so beautiful.

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:24.680
 Because we can look at and visualize this incredible software stack or hardware stack.

1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:26.680
 Some of it could just be hacked in.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:30.680
 You make it better over time, but it was that brilliant thing and we got to get that in.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:34.680
 Because that's the way you do it now and we'll make it more efficient later.

1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:40.680
 Maybe this is a good moment to draw a distinction between design and engineering and does such

1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:43.680
 a distinction even exist?

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:46.680
 Are these distinct disciplines or no?

1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:47.680
 I don't think they're distinct.

1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:49.680
 I think they're different types of design.

1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:56.680
 I think there's always this idea of this, oh, on the mount, designer.

1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:01.680
 And it all comes down and it all flows down like some magic.

1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:03.680
 There are electrical design.

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:04.680
 There's AI designers.

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:07.680
 There is data scientist designers.

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:08.680
 Everybody has design.

1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:12.680
 And there's a chapter in the book all about that, actually.

1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:17.680
 It's not just you go to the mount and it comes down and you're enlightened.

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:21.680
 Each person brings their form of design and their craft.

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:25.680
 Because if they're really good, they're artists in their own right.

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:26.680
 They're not just engineers.

1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:27.680
 They're not just designers.

1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:28.680
 They're artists.

1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:29.680
 They're empathetic.

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:30.680
 They really want to bring their best.

1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:34.680
 A lot of the best engineers I have are not the technical or that I've worked with, are

1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:37.680
 not the technical, got to get it exactly right.

1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:38.680
 They're the artists.

1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:42.680
 They came from music or they came from other things and they see that, right?

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:48.680
 When you work with very rigid engineers, this is the way, the only way, la, la, la.

1:13:48.680 --> 1:13:51.680
 Those are not the engineers I want to work with.

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:54.680
 They're all like a bit artist's heart.

1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:55.680
 Right.

1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:58.680
 They understand the practicalness.

1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:03.680
 They don't have to have the rigidity of this is the way it's done.

1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:09.680
 Like, if you're building something new, all new and revolutionary, none of us are experts

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:11.680
 at it.

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:15.680
 And if you come with that expert mindset, just tell me, and I can give you a story.

1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:18.680
 I should probably give you that story about that.

1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:22.280
 If you come with the expert and I'm the expert, when you're doing something no one's ever

1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:27.680
 done before, I don't want you on the team because we all are learning about something

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.680
 that has never been in existence before.

1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:36.180
 And we have to bring that level of vulnerability and openness to new ideas and new ways of

1:14:36.180 --> 1:14:39.680
 doing things throughout the team.

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:45.680
 So you want people that are able to have like beginner's mind or whatever, like, don't

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:46.680
 commit as an expert.

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:47.680
 What's the story?

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:48.680
 Okay.

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:49.680
 No, I can tell.

1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:51.680
 All right.

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:57.680
 So, you know, you asked what were these risks, you know, like on the early iPod, and there's

1:14:57.680 --> 1:14:58.680
 a few big risks.

1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:03.880
 Like one, and this doesn't go in the story, but like putting rotating media in your pocket

1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:08.120
 and it could drop at any time, what happens there and like you can damage because the

1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:13.320
 heads and the hard drive media are so close, it smacks, it's dead, right?

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:16.680
 So that was one big one, like, holy shit, right?

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:20.160
 So that was something we, and we had to design special tests and everything and special software

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:21.160
 on that.

1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:26.200
 But then there was another one, which was at the early days, the way the first generations

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:33.000
 of iPods, I had to hack the IDE interface to the hard drives.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:39.240
 So I was like, okay, what we're going to use is we're going to use this chip for hard drive,

1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.880
 to make a hard drive, you had to have a chip that did firewire to a hard drive, okay?

1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:46.880
 And then that would become a portable hard drive.

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:52.480
 Well then we had the MP3 player and the user interface and everything.

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:57.040
 So there was times when it was just this hard drive and there was times when it was a MP3

1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:58.040
 player.

1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:04.040
 You had to hot switch between what the hard drive thinks it was talking to, right?

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:06.840
 So designed this thing, tore it apart, done all this stuff.

1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:11.000
 And I was like, you know, maybe I'm going to screw up IDE and there's something, there's

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.200
 some holes I'm going to see.

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:18.560
 So I go, who's the expert at Apple who understands IDE and everything?

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:24.720
 So this person comes over, the mass storage specialist comes over and I put on the whiteboard

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:27.360
 and say, here's how we're going to do this thing and here's the commands and this is

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:30.760
 how it hot switches and everything and he's like, that's never going to work.

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:31.760
 Yeah.

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:32.760
 And I was like, what?

1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:33.760
 It goes, never going to work.

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:36.240
 I said, well, let me go over here and show you this right here.

1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.720
 I have it prototyped and it's been working for days.

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:42.360
 I just want to see if you're going to have it find any holes in the thing, didn't even

1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:46.960
 did, and he just stormed out of the room and never, never even, right?

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:47.960
 That's hilarious.

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:52.480
 I've had a lot of experience like this with experts, like for example, this ridiculous

1:16:52.480 --> 1:17:01.080
 room, I had, I had a person and there's many people like this that I showed them, here's

1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:06.960
 the situation, you know, acoustics, acoustics, yeah, they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:09.960
 This is horrible.

1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.760
 This is not, this is not going to work.

1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:17.960
 The reflection, the curtains are not going to stop, there's a bunch of terminology they're

1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:25.320
 telling me, it's a similar kind of situation as the idea, which I was like, no, listen,

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:29.080
 I just need to see, is there major issues and they're like a low hanging fruit that

1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:35.600
 are fixable and major holes I should be aware of, not like let's, let's, $100,000 to upgrade,

1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:38.560
 to upgrade for what exact purpose?

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:39.560
 What not why?

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:40.560
 Yeah, exactly.

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:41.560
 Exactly.

1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:46.240
 The why, the focusing on the, on the story and the content on the, the why, the why,

1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:47.240
 the why.

1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:52.800
 That actually, I've experienced that unfortunately in the artistic realms too, which is like

1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:58.520
 photography and videography, cinematography, it's interesting, I talked to photographers

1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:08.080
 that are quote unquote experts and it's always about, so much of the focus is on the equipment,

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:16.520
 the equipment behind the sensors and the lighting and it's like, all right, all right.

1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:26.200
 But what about, what about the feeling of the story you create visually?

1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:32.280
 The difference between a movie that's really well told and it doesn't have all the effects

1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:36.840
 and everything versus maybe some of the superhero movies we see all the time, which is good

1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:40.880
 luck if there's a story, but man, there's a lot of action and CGI.

1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:48.360
 Well, that's, that's right and that, and there's also value to the, to those right CGI, superhero.

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:51.760
 Can tell a better story, but you have to have a good story to begin with.

1:18:51.760 --> 1:18:53.280
 Sure, exactly.

1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:57.440
 But it's, if you're focused on the story, I guess you need to start with a story.

1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:05.680
 You need to start with the story and if you bring in experts, they can often be detrimental

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:09.160
 I guess to the why they're, they're too good at doing the what.

1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:14.400
 Well, you can bring in experts for why there's lots of experts for why too many times we

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:16.040
 get experts for what?

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:17.040
 Yes.

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:19.320
 And then they only focus on the what.

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:24.240
 And so you, so they come with the specs and feeds and the numbers and all the other stuff.

1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:27.400
 But what you're really asking for is I need somebody about the why and understanding what

1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:32.740
 we're trying to get done here and fitting the what's into that why, right?

1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:38.960
 That's why I do think that I, one of the qualities that I really enjoy for people

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:43.600
 to work with is like humility for a particular problem when you approach it.

1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:47.800
 Basically I don't know how to solve this, but we're going to figure it out as opposed

1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:54.000
 to, oh, I've solved this thing many, many times before I know exactly what to do.

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.800
 Humility before the chaos, sort of having, having an open mind that this is going to

1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:05.320
 require a totally new way of doing things is a really nice quality to see.

1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:09.840
 You know, you're one of the fascinating humans in the history of Silicon Valley.

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:11.480
 Steve is another one of those.

1:20:11.480 --> 1:20:14.720
 So those two humans came together for a time to work together.

1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:19.040
 What was it like working with Steve Jobs?

1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:26.120
 What aspect of his behavior and personality, let's say, brought out the best in you?

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:32.840
 Pushing you, really pushing you, relentless on the details, challenging you for the right

1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:33.840
 reasons.

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:34.840
 It wasn't bullying.

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:36.480
 It wasn't demeaning.

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:41.640
 He would critique the work, not judge the person, at least not in front of them, or

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:44.440
 inside of, you know, in front of a group or anything like that.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:47.320
 I know it was really that attention to detail.

1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:51.840
 And he, when he would make a decision, you know, there are, when you make the first

1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:56.600
 version of anything, something revolutionary, there are a lot of opinion based decisions.

1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:01.520
 And there's only one or two people, three people who hold those opinion based decisions

1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:03.480
 and what they should be.

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:11.320
 And when you have those opinions and you're trying to work with the team to implement

1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:17.120
 those decisions, you have to really tell them why of those decisions.

1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.000
 Just don't go do it, but why it's there.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.880
 So you can feel part of that decision.

1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:30.440
 You can understand what were the tradeoffs of the different other answers to that opinion,

1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:31.440
 right?

1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:36.040
 And say, this is the reason why we picked the, what we picked, because it's this for

1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:41.240
 the customer or this for the overall story, what have you, so that you felt really good.

1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:45.240
 Because a lot of times most people want a data driven decision.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:48.320
 But with V1s, you don't get data, right?

1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:51.800
 Maybe in a B2B, you could a little bit because you can talk to customers, but you can't do

1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:53.320
 that with a consumer product.

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:59.600
 V1, version one, B2B, business to business versus what's the alternative?

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:00.600
 Business to consumer.

1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:01.600
 B2B.

1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:02.600
 Okay.

1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:03.600
 We're just defining some terms.

1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:04.600
 Yes, sure.

1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:05.600
 Absolutely.

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:06.600
 Yeah.

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:10.240
 So, and when you say data driven decisions versus what?

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:11.320
 Opinion based decisions.

1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:16.560
 So like gut, you have to use, you don't have any...

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:22.160
 You can't fall back on any data or any previous history to kind of inform you of what's going

1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:23.360
 on, right?

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:29.760
 And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed and cannot make new innovations

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:35.160
 and new products, it's because they're trying to turn, and this is what I saw at Phillips,

1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:39.720
 they're trying to turn opinion based decisions into data driven decisions so they don't lose

1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:41.760
 their jobs.

1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:47.040
 So if you look at management consulting, management consulting is all about taking those opinion

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:51.960
 based decisions, giving them to someone else to turn into data that comes back to them

1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:57.920
 and says they can blame the management consultants when something goes wrong, as opposed to it

1:22:57.920 --> 1:23:01.220
 wasn't me, right?

1:23:01.220 --> 1:23:06.160
 When you need to have to tell that story, you have to understand that especially V1,

1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:14.360
 you need to be able to articulate those opinion based decisions and you need to own them.

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:20.120
 And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right, you then own them and fix them

1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:22.200
 and move on, right?

1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:24.280
 Version one of the iPod wasn't perfect.

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.960
 Version one of the iPhone wasn't perfect.

1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:29.400
 We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong.

1:23:29.400 --> 1:23:33.720
 But as you go through that, because you got more data, because V2, you had data on those

1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:37.520
 original opinions and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right?

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.600
 And you still have new opinions because those are differentiators that we call differentiators,

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:48.320
 the things that move the product forward in its evolution.

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:52.640
 But at the revolution stage, opinions, opinions, opinions, no data.

1:23:52.640 --> 1:24:02.240
 And so you have this discussion, you and Steve in the whole team with opinions.

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.400
 And there you have to be harsh.

1:24:05.400 --> 1:24:11.200
 I wouldn't say harsh, but you have to be very determined, right?

1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:15.560
 There are two real opinion based decisions that happen on the iPhone.

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:18.160
 One was the keyboard.

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:21.520
 Should we have a hardboard keyboard or should we have a virtual keyboard?

1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:27.040
 The BlackBerry was the number one productivity messaging device of its time.

1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:31.880
 It was called a CrackBerry for a reason because people loved it because it was easy to type

1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:34.960
 and they could get their work done.

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:38.000
 But when you're saying we're going to move from that, everyone's talking about that in

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.920
 the market and you say we're going to move to a virtual keyboard and it's not going to

1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:47.080
 work as well as the hardware keyboard, that's an opinion based decision, right?

1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.400
 Because the data is telling you all the best sales are over here.

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:53.240
 God, that takes guts.

1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:56.360
 It takes guts, but you have to look at it from a different point of view.

1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:02.040
 And this is how I learned to come to understand this because I had been building virtual keyboards

1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:06.600
 before and I knew the goodness and the badness in them, right?

1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:10.480
 But he was like, look, those are productivity devices.

1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:15.040
 Ours is born out of an entertainment device and productivity, right?

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:17.080
 We need to show full screen videos.

1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:20.880
 And you're going to have apps, they're not apps, but are apps, the Apple apps because

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.480
 there were no app store yet, are going to take over the whole screen.

1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:25.560
 You want a full screen web browser.

1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:28.760
 You don't want one that's like half of the device is just a keyboard.

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:30.600
 Maybe you don't need that keyboard in every instance.

1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:34.640
 So we want that part of the screen to change based on the tool you may need at the time

1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:37.000
 and maybe it's just full view, right?

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:40.680
 So you have to go and understand it's a different type of device just because that's that and

1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:44.080
 it's successful for that reason, the CrackBerry for the keyboard.

1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:47.920
 That's not the only thing you're going to do with this device because people only did messaging

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:49.840
 and maybe a few phone calls, right?

1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:50.840
 This was going to be so much more.

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:53.480
 It was going to be an entertainment web browsing device.

1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:58.800
 So you wanted those tools to go away, but it wouldn't be as good as the hardware keyboard.

1:25:58.800 --> 1:25:59.800
 So that's an opinion.

1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:03.080
 Well, let me give you another opinion based decision that got turned around before it

1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:05.080
 shipped.

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:07.280
 Steve said, no SIM slot.

1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:08.520
 I don't want any slots.

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:10.600
 We're going to make it very pure.

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:13.200
 Johnny was like, of course, no slots.

1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:18.680
 Johnny and we all looked around and go, that doesn't work.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:19.680
 You can't do that.

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:20.680
 Well, why does Variety?

1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:23.560
 And then he would always, and this was the magic of Steve, like when you said, no, that

1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:24.560
 doesn't work.

1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:27.600
 You go, well, why does Verizon not have any SIM slots, right?

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:31.680
 They showed that you can do a mobile phone with those limbs on you're like, okay, here

1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:32.680
 we go.

1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:38.520
 And so a few days later, we come back with, you know, and so product marketing voice to

1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:44.760
 the customer, engineering, we all come back with all the data showing how many data networks

1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:50.680
 and mobile networks required SIM cards versus did not and what the trends were.

1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:56.920
 And so we showed the data and that killed the, or excuse me, brought back the SIM slot

1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:01.680
 on the original iPhone because we're like, because he was just like, we're going to tell

1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:04.480
 AT&T to not use a SIM, right?

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:06.960
 We're going to just tell them to do it differently, right?

1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:07.960
 But we were like, if we want this thing to work, we're going to do it differently.

1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:11.480
 If you want this thing to go anywhere around the world, you want to put that friction in.

1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:14.440
 People who are going to move from place to place, you know, they have different SIMs

1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:16.160
 because of the prices and all that stuff.

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:17.960
 We had to show all of that data.

1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:24.200
 And then that opinion based decision got turned into a data driven decision and the SIM slot

1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:25.600
 obviously showed up.

1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:30.280
 So those are two very, at the very same time, right?

1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:36.200
 Opinion can hold and so can data overrule opinion when data does exist for a V1.

1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:40.600
 But at the end of the day, you don't know what the right answer is.

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:47.800
 So doing no SIM card slot may have been the right decision.

1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:55.280
 We won't know because maybe if that was the decision, then like many times throughout

1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:00.560
 Apple's history, you basically changed the tide of how technology is done.

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:01.560
 Absolutely.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:03.760
 You know, you never know.

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:05.320
 Apple started WiFi.

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:06.320
 People don't understand.

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:07.320
 WiFi came out of there.

1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:09.000
 There was no WiFi in 2001.

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.480
 Apple started WiFi.

1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:13.640
 And then everyone else, you know, got on board.

1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:17.600
 If you look at now where we're going, we're going to phones without SIM slots because

1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:19.000
 we have eSIMs, right?

1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:23.160
 And now the SIM slot's becoming legacy, legacy as a legacy port.

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:28.520
 That legacy port will probably be gone by six, maybe 10 years.

1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:29.520
 It'll be gone.

1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:32.640
 I'm pretty sure of that because it's so much easier for carries.

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:36.040
 They don't have to have physical things to go out and write.

1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:41.120
 So right now it's just the early days, but it will happen and it will go its way.

1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:43.120
 It'll fall away, but it will take time.

1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:45.120
 You just couldn't do it back then.

1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:49.120
 So timing is essential here, but at the end of the day, it's opinions and that's where

1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:50.120
 the genius is.

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.640
 Sometimes the data tells you one thing, but the data at the end of the day does represent

1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:56.640
 the past.

1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:01.240
 And the future may be different than the past.

1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:07.000
 Because there's wisdom in the past and sometimes it's actually representative of something

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.400
 that should be over common.

1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:16.560
 Progress looks like leaving that stuff behind, like the headphone jack.

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:24.400
 I mean, when different folks were getting rid of the headphone jack, boy, I would love

1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:28.080
 to be a fly in the wall of those discussions.

1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:34.400
 We had that, oh, that was a discussion that happened almost every year.

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:39.000
 That was an every year that should we get rid of headphone jacks on the iPod, right?

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:41.680
 When are wireless headsets going to happen, right?

1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:47.160
 And it took years to build all the right protocols, the chips, all those things to make the experience

1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:50.920
 that is the iPods today, right?

1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:55.720
 To say have the conference because Bluetooth was good, but it wasn't Apple like.

1:29:55.720 --> 1:29:59.120
 So that is like, we got to make our own chips, we got to make our own software stacks.

1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:04.000
 Now we have the confidence to remove the headphone jack and actually make you pay $200 more for

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:07.400
 your iPhone that you were just paying because of the headphone jack.

1:30:07.400 --> 1:30:12.200
 Now we've grown our revenue, we've given a new experience to the user, right?

1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:15.760
 And tada, you know, and it's magic.

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:20.080
 And now the world's transformed to everyone, you know, moving to that, right?

1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:25.560
 But it took years to understand the problem, develop the technology and not just rush it

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:31.080
 to market to get a half experience, but to get it right and refine it, then ship it.

1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:35.160
 And only then after, it was probably four or five years in development, just like the

1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:38.120
 M1 processor, right?

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:43.560
 That was a work from 2008, right?

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:46.920
 Grinding away, grinding away, grinding away, then saying, okay, now we have the confidence

1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:54.760
 we're doing our own silicon for all the iPhones and iPods and such.

1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:58.320
 Now we're going to turn to the Mac and make sure we have the best processor, right?

1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:01.800
 Not just that we have the best integrated design team.

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:05.600
 And then saying we're going to, you know, and then besting everyone, making sure the

1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:10.560
 softwares and the hardware is designed at the same time, making sure the kernels, all

1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:16.720
 those things are going to use the best efficiency and then popping it out.

1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:18.640
 And then it feels seamless.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:19.640
 It's magic.

1:31:19.640 --> 1:31:24.000
 There were no, as far as I could tell, unless you were in real esoteric drivers or something

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:25.000
 like that.

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.000
 It just worked.

1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:27.160
 It was magic.

1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:28.880
 Like the transient, it was not even a speed bump.

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:32.320
 It was not even a crack in the road.

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:40.640
 So perhaps famously, Steve had a bit of a temper, Steve Jobs, would you say his particular

1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:49.920
 personality in this aspect was constructive or destructive in the process of shaping

1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:55.480
 these opinion based ideas?

1:31:55.480 --> 1:32:00.680
 So in build, I write a chapter called assholes.

1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:01.840
 Yes.

1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:09.400
 And you lay out beautifully the types of assholes and maybe you could speak to the constructive

1:32:09.400 --> 1:32:13.760
 and the destructive types of assholes.

1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:20.800
 So there's really two delineations that I have found of real fundamental ones.

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:24.760
 And that is, again, the why.

1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:27.960
 Why do I feel this person is an asshole?

1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:30.080
 They might not be.

1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:35.000
 I feel this is a person who's an asshole.

1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:40.800
 Are they motivated by their ego or are they motivated by their mission?

1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:46.080
 Everything they're trying to do that's and doing in service of something else, right?

1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:52.000
 Sometimes those lines can be blurry, but it's usually pretty clear.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:57.000
 When it's ego motivated, it's clear they're just trying to get up in the ranks, push people

1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:59.560
 down, shove people aside.

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:09.800
 I think we saw a president do that on a stage once, you know, I'm me and I'm the guy, right?

1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:14.560
 And I'm going to prove it by pushing everyone away and being nefarious or what have you,

1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:18.200
 either passively aggressive or aggressively aggressive.

1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:21.520
 But they're doing about themselves.

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:28.240
 There's another one, which is someone who's so attentive to detail and unrelenting that

1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:33.480
 they're trying to get the right things for the customer or in service of their mission

1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:37.880
 and they want to make sure we fulfill those things, right?

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:39.040
 And they really care.

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:44.240
 They don't micromanage all the details, but they micromanage the details where the customer,

1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:48.520
 it touches the customer in some way.

1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:53.440
 People who work with those types of people who are unrelenting and push you and might

1:33:53.440 --> 1:34:01.920
 make you upset, a lot of times it's a knee jerk reaction to go, they are an asshole.

1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:06.680
 Get off my back, you're an asshole, right?

1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:11.780
 And you're protecting your ego because what's happening is that person is usually pushing

1:34:11.780 --> 1:34:13.760
 you beyond your boundaries.

1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:20.320
 They see something that we can do or you can do that you're just either not wanting to

1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:25.040
 do for whatever reason, you're not confident in that, you're like, I don't want to take

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.480
 the extra time and say, no, we need to get that done and pushing you, okay?

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:37.920
 And so when we came to those areas, it wasn't just a one on one, it could be Steve against

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:43.240
 the team going, we need glass instead of plastic on the front face of the iPhone.

1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:45.640
 And we're going to do this.

1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:49.600
 And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.

1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:53.840
 And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details, but he could see in our minds

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:58.680
 that we're like, yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably, but man, it's really

1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.480
 putting us in risk and we laid out the risks for him.

1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.800
 And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.

1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:04.800
 We'll do that.

1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:06.520
 We're like, we might be three months late.

1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:08.560
 He's like, this is so important.

1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:14.920
 We need to stay on time, you know, but it would be all the time, push, push, push.

1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:19.080
 It reminds me of like kids growing up and me is growing up, you know, when your parents

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:24.320
 push you to make you grow beyond your boundaries, your personal boundaries and you're like,

1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.680
 God damn it, I'm sad, you know, but they do it for the right reasons.

1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:29.680
 Now let's see.

1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:31.080
 It's not bullying.

1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:32.080
 It's not about bullying.

1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:33.640
 It's not about demeaning.

1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:37.920
 It's about either pushing you to another part of the mission that needs to get done, or

1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:41.080
 it's about critiquing your work, but not judging you.

1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:42.080
 Yes.

1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:43.840
 Well, there's a lot to say there.

1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:50.040
 So one, it's fascinating, it's really, it's fascinating and you laid out a very nice picture,

1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:57.160
 it does feel like there's sometimes gray areas, which is why it makes all of this very complicated.

1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:03.120
 So one question I have for you in terms of glass on the iPhone.

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:09.680
 How important is it that like Steve in that case is right?

1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:12.680
 Because I could argue each side.

1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:19.160
 It seems like in one sense, just having a strong vision and opinion is already going

1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:22.960
 to make everybody grow, even if it turns out to be the wrong.

1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:30.120
 As long as you are sort of standing your ground, you know, Napoleon invading Russia

1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:34.920
 or something in the winter, like it's just not going to be a good idea.

1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:35.920
 Right.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:39.200
 It's not a good idea, but I'm going to hold to that.

1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:41.760
 And then once you decide, you go all in.

1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:45.880
 And then from that, even if the whole team knows it's the wrong decision, just sticking

1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:51.600
 by it, powering through, you will learn through the pain of it, like everybody will learn.

1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:53.080
 So that's one side.

1:36:53.080 --> 1:37:01.680
 The others, maybe the asshole, the vision driven asshole gets to be more and more of

1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:07.760
 an asshole if they have a track record of through that process, having built people

1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:10.520
 up, having made the correct decisions.

1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:13.080
 They can't, they're not allowed to be an asshole.

1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:15.280
 They're in rare air and no one can challenge them.

1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:16.280
 Right.

1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:17.280
 Right.

1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:18.920
 Steve was never that.

1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:20.720
 That's the great thing.

1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:22.760
 He was never unchallengeable.

1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:23.760
 You could challenge him.

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:31.240
 Now, the plastic to glass story is a perfect example of this.

1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:36.520
 So at the beginning of the project, well before we were going, we had always had these things

1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:44.240
 about plastic front iPods, these kinds of things, scratches and all that stuff.

1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:50.120
 So we said, oh, we're going to have a glass or a plastic display, a cover for the display

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:53.840
 because the display was glass underneath it.

1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:57.520
 We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic.

1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:01.600
 And then we all landed together on plastic.

1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:03.160
 Okay.

1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:05.800
 The original decision was plastic.

1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:12.040
 And the reasons were, okay, we don't want to make a mistake, glass can break, people

1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:14.360
 drop them all the time.

1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:19.880
 So we don't want to have a fragile device because you're going to be using even more

1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:21.920
 than a music player.

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:22.920
 Right.

1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:26.600
 And you're going to be holding your head and putting it in your pocket and misses and

1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:27.880
 all that stuff.

1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:30.480
 So we went down the road with plastic.

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:37.960
 When it was shown, when the product was shown at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that

1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:41.760
 was plastic.

1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:44.880
 We had just enough of them in the field at the time.

1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:51.640
 We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic.

1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:55.400
 Reviewers who didn't have the device yet, because it was behind glass.

1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.480
 If you remember 2007, the Jesus phone comes up and no one could even touch them.

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:03.040
 You could just look at it in this beautiful museum quality box.

1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:05.400
 Like it came from the future or whatever, the past.

1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:08.680
 And it was like, oh, and you just looked and that was all you got.

1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:13.480
 But then people said, well, what screen is, what covers on that, you know, reviewers who

1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:16.400
 knew better, you know, it's plastic.

1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:18.800
 And they were like, really?

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:21.120
 And so there was enough of a doubt there.

1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:25.160
 And then when we started to do it, and then Steve changed the frame of reference of the

1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:28.880
 question or of the result of what the customer would think.

1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:34.480
 And he was like, if we designed it with plastic and it's in their pocket all the time and

1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:39.880
 it gets scratched by coins, lightly scratched or by keys or something like that, that is

1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:41.760
 a design problem.

1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.760
 We need to fix the problem.

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:45.720
 That was our bad.

1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:53.840
 If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it and it cracks, it's the customer's

1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:59.120
 fault and they have much lower, they have less likelihood to complain.

1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:04.680
 They're slow complain, but they're part of that, of that failure.

1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:05.680
 Yes.

1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:06.920
 Oh, that's fascinating.

1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:10.000
 And then that's true to that, right?

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.560
 Because then they were part of why it failed, whereas the design, they didn't do anything

1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:18.760
 wrong, was just sitting in their pocket and it's scratching, and that's normal use.

1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:23.400
 Abnormal use has been dropped and we're like, oh, now we get it.

1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:29.640
 And so we all moved to that mindset when you framed the problem and the solution in that

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:35.200
 way versus the original framing where we all landed on plastic.

1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.920
 And then he was unrelenting on that, but we all had moved.

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:45.920
 And we have moved mindset and we understood the why and we marshaled together.

1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:52.520
 And then by the end of June, and it was crazy, the mechanical product design teams sourcing

1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:58.480
 all of us, the partner corning, pulled together to make that happen because it was the right

1:40:58.480 --> 1:41:00.280
 reason, right?

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:07.080
 So this, you look at these stories and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways,

1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:12.120
 but that's not usually how it all happened of like one leader was, that's not how Steve

1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:13.120
 was.

1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:18.160
 Now, I've seen leaders who were just pounding and just had no real empathy for the team and

1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:19.160
 understanding the why.

1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:21.080
 And it's just, it is the way I want it, right?

1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:23.760
 I am the supreme leader.

1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:29.560
 That wasn't like that when he just had a very strong opinion, very strong opinion, but it

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:31.060
 was challengeable.

1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:32.060
 It was challengeable.

1:41:32.060 --> 1:41:35.520
 And if you came with the right thing, you know, it was, you could, you could modulate

1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:37.320
 that, but you had to come with a team.

1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:38.320
 It couldn't just be you.

1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:43.560
 And you had to come a team and data and to overcome because it was a very strong opinion.

1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:45.680
 And there's personal quirks of character.

1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:48.720
 Like you said, bad days and good days, bad days and good days.

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:53.240
 So there's also the three options you said, you, you noticed that the third option is

1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:59.640
 always going to be the one that's picked those kinds of idiosyncrasies, idiosyncrasies.

1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:04.680
 And that, so that brings up another thing.

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:12.480
 You said challenge the idea, not the person, you know, I'm somebody who has a, you know,

1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:13.480
 I have a temper.

1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:18.240
 I've, I use colorful language and so on when, on teams I work in my private life, I'm

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:21.840
 so much calmer and so on, but I get, when I get really passionate with engineering

1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:29.600
 teams and I've been called an asshole and you get, I mean, I am distinctly aware that

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:36.040
 you cross lines often, um, there's like levels, right?

1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:37.040
 Sure.

1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:40.760
 You know, you could, it has to do with language and how language is heard.

1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:45.200
 So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me, you could swear, you could say stuff

1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:52.000
 that sounds personal, like, uh, uh, like, I don't know, Lex, sometimes I think you're

1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.640
 the dumbest human on the face of the earth or something.

1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:55.640
 I don't know.

1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:56.640
 Sure.

1:42:56.640 --> 1:42:57.640
 This sounds very personal, right?

1:42:57.640 --> 1:42:58.880
 But I'm not going to take that personally.

1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:00.520
 I understand what's being said.

1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:04.680
 And then I'm also noticed that there's other people that take stuff more personally.

1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:09.080
 This has to do with teams and figuring out like, okay, who's going to take certain words

1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:10.080
 personally and not.

1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:14.000
 And you have to know that's what takes, makes a great coach, a great leader, a mentor.

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:18.680
 You have to, you have to like, factor all that in, but it just, there's something about

1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:25.520
 just being an asshole and, um, being passionate and really driven that sometimes you do cross

1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:31.840
 lines and that's, I don't know what to do with that because it feels like it comes with

1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:32.840
 the territory.

1:43:32.840 --> 1:43:40.520
 Like you have, it seems like you can't just have a perfectly optimized, no, no, absolutely

1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:41.520
 not.

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:42.520
 We're humans.

1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:43.520
 Yeah.

1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:44.520
 Yeah.

1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:48.240
 Everyone's programmed the same way to react the same way to given stimulus, right?

1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:49.240
 Yeah.

1:43:49.240 --> 1:43:54.200
 So, you know, you said, I don't know if this was a real example, but you said, oh, you're

1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:56.560
 the dumbest human on earth or whatever.

1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:59.360
 I would never say that.

1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:00.360
 Absolutely never.

1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:05.640
 And if someone said that to me or I saw someone else say that to another person on the team,

1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:06.640
 absolutely not.

1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:08.760
 That is not allowed because that's judging someone.

1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:13.000
 You may be heated and you can get heated and you can say it in your intonation, but to

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:18.080
 then try to put a label on it and put a label on a person, that is not allowed.

1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:24.840
 So if you let that kind of culture happen and it becomes somewhat, you know, sometimes

1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:29.040
 it's ingest, you know, it has to be very much ingest and those two people have to have a

1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:34.200
 really good working relationship, but other than that, I'm sorry, it's going to be a lot

1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:39.840
 more, you could say, aseptic in that way that you're not going to add that stuff in,

1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:44.560
 but you can do it with all other types of ways without saying that because then people

1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:49.600
 who do react to that kind of language and don't have those shields because they might

1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:54.600
 not have that same confidence level that you do and you can just brush it off, that can

1:44:54.600 --> 1:45:00.080
 be very cancerous in a team because people then mean that and then they see, oh, that's

1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:01.280
 the right way to be.

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:06.600
 You got to snuff that out and you got to be that change or that model that you want to

1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:07.600
 show the team.

1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:08.600
 Yes.

1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:14.120
 And that too, even if it doesn't affect me, is going to affect a significant enough fraction

1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:18.120
 of brilliant people where that shouldn't be part of the culture.

1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:19.120
 Exactly.

1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:22.880
 And other people see that happen and then, oh, I guess that's acceptable, right?

1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:26.080
 Just like politics in the workplace, is that acceptable or not?

1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:30.080
 I call it out exactly when I see it in front of everyone, right?

1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:32.920
 Because it's just another ego driven thing.

1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:38.280
 You have to set the tone as a leader for what you want your organization to be and how it

1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:42.960
 gets reflected in the world and you have to uphold that and you can't, sure you can have

1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:47.280
 an excursion outside of that, but you have to go back and say, I'm sorry.

1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:48.280
 Yeah.

1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:49.280
 Yeah.

1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:53.520
 You have to go and apologize, heal and said, I was not the person I wanted to be that day.

1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:54.680
 I'm really sorry.

1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:55.680
 Yeah.

1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.520
 This is, and even in front of the team and have that humility and say, we're all human

1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:01.520
 here.

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:03.520
 And just because I'm the leader doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.

1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:06.240
 So have the self awareness, apologize.

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:07.240
 Exactly.

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:10.600
 And then that's also part of the culture.

1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:12.440
 Oh, yeah.

1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:17.000
 How are you different from Steve as a leader and designer?

1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:22.200
 So you've spoken about sort of what made you stronger, which is he was able to challenge,

1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:25.520
 he was able to push you to bring out the best.

1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:29.000
 Well, I come from the technical angle, right?

1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:35.240
 Deep technology, software, hardware, systems, thinking, implementation, all that stuff.

1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:36.400
 So I have a different bent.

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:40.960
 He wanted to be an engineer started, but really he was much better at all the other things,

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:46.760
 the storytelling, the interfacing and being the voice of the customer and being that product

1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:49.080
 marketer in a way that we talked about.

1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:51.720
 I grew into being the product marketing, the marketing.

1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:55.640
 He came really out the other way and never got really deep technically.

1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:57.760
 So that's two different mindsets.

1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:00.080
 One's not better or worse, it's just, that's how it is.

1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:05.160
 And it takes all kinds and all kinds can do great designs.

1:47:05.160 --> 1:47:09.880
 Did it manifest itself differently just the fact that you came from those different places?

1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:10.880
 Absolutely.

1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:16.160
 Like what, so like the discussion about glass on the iPhone was probably had a different

1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:17.160
 flavor to it.

1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:18.160
 Sure.

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:21.960
 When you started getting into the technical details, enough so, you're getting the third

1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:25.240
 order technical details and he can't argue with that anymore.

1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:31.080
 Then it was somebody who's like, okay, at some point he's like, I can't win this war.

1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:35.760
 And he learned that very early on because he didn't like the way the look of the Macintosh

1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.680
 board, the PCB, was laid out.

1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:42.280
 He wanted to be beautiful on the outside and on the inside.

1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:45.080
 He's like, why are all these wires running this way?

1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:50.240
 Why doesn't it have all this symmetry and we have to make it beautiful on the inside.

1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:53.720
 And even the traces on the boards have to look a certain way.

1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:56.720
 So the teams made the board, they knew that would work.

1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:01.160
 And then they made the board that the way Steve wanted it, and that didn't work.

1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:05.320
 And then Steve instantly figured out like at some point, don't micromanage every single

1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:06.320
 detail.

1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:07.880
 There's some things he doesn't know enough about.

1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:09.200
 So he would get out of that.

1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:13.440
 But that was one of those instances where he pushed really hard and that's his opinion.

1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:16.000
 So they said, okay, we're going to make it a data driven decision and we're going to

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.000
 make both.

1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.120
 I'm going to show you the results, right?

1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.560
 And then from there, he didn't get into those details.

1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:25.320
 So from that, you could have a great challenge, right?

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.760
 Because then you could get those data and say, we can't do that.

1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:28.760
 Let me show you why.

1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:29.880
 Or we can do that.

1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:31.280
 And then Steve would go, you can't do that.

1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:32.280
 And you're like, oh, we can do that.

1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:33.280
 Let me show you, right?

1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:36.840
 So there's certain times when you were like, bringing something to reality that he didn't

1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:39.440
 think could exist, right?

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:46.280
 So it was always that creative tension, that interaction that was so successful, right?

1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:51.120
 I think but there was one other fundamental thing that was different and that it graded

1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:57.000
 on the team and that I made sure and I learned from to not do.

1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:02.920
 And I over maybe overdo now in the opposite direction, which is when there's a great idea

1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:08.080
 that comes from the team, acknowledge that person and go, that is a great idea as the

1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:10.520
 leader, you know, the opinion driven.

1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:11.520
 That's a great idea.

1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:12.520
 Let's build on that.

1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:13.520
 Let's see if that can do that.

1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:15.640
 Or it's a great idea, but not for now, put it aside.

1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:19.600
 But call out when people have great ideas because it's infectious.

1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:23.560
 And that means, maybe not ideas that come bubble up to the customer level, but inside

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:29.360
 the organization, people like they get rewarded for their ideas and say, that's a great one.

1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:37.560
 Steve was always like, you give an idea and he would go, hmm, okay, I don't know.

1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:40.840
 The next day, 24 hours later, it would come back with slight modifications.

1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:44.080
 I've had this genius idea, right?

1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:48.400
 And as sooner or later, we'd look around the table and we'd like roll our eyes and go,

1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:49.400
 here we go again.

1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:53.080
 So it demotivates you from generating ideas a little bit.

1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:58.400
 Well, you know, we got used to it, but you know, later on in the team, you know, it was

1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:02.280
 just not, it just, it doesn't want to bring the best, right?

1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:07.680
 Because if you're always like, the reaction is never, that's a genius idea.

1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:13.160
 It was always like, it was either negative or neutral, right?

1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:16.960
 Then it doesn't, it doesn't have that same emotional effect that you want you to bring

1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:17.960
 your best.

1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:18.960
 Yeah.

1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:21.720
 You know, when people get excited by this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you kind of build

1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:26.800
 on top excitement and it could be, but coupled with sort of harshness when the idea is bad

1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:31.160
 and you call out the bad ideas too, so it's the good and the bad.

1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:34.200
 You could say, you don't have, you don't have to say bad ideas.

1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:37.200
 Like maybe not now, let's table that for later.

1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:40.680
 Let's discuss it or say that that's a decent idea.

1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:42.280
 But did you think about that idea this way?

1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:47.720
 Not just no or yes, but let's talk about why that might not be applicable in this case

1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:49.040
 so that they can learn.

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:52.720
 So the next time they bring the next idea, they can modulate and understand and start

1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:57.520
 seeing through the opinion based decision makers or the databases to bring it and bring better

1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:02.520
 formatted arguments or ideas so that you have better chance of success the next time.

1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:03.520
 Yeah.

1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:04.520
 Right?

1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:05.520
 You got to train through those moments.

1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:06.520
 You got to teach those are teaching moments.

1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:07.520
 Yeah.

1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:08.520
 Teachful moments.

1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:10.680
 I aspire to be that kind of person.

1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:14.720
 I'll, I'll usually just say that, that, that idea is shit.

1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:21.440
 As the, like, like, and then you, that, I remember that this brilliant person just gave

1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:23.200
 that really shitty idea.

1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:26.440
 So I remember to make sure the next time they give a good idea, I really compliment that

1:51:26.440 --> 1:51:27.440
 good idea.

1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:28.440
 Exactly.

1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:34.760
 But I personally, I mean, it's a motion, but I, I call out the really shitty ideas.

1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:36.240
 But you should call out the really great ones.

1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:37.240
 Yeah.

1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:40.240
 If you let the pendulum swing both ways, then everybody goes, he's balanced.

1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:43.680
 It's always one way, why bring any idea?

1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:45.280
 I'm all about the pendulum.

1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:46.280
 Right.

1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:49.480
 You got to have both the joy and the pain.

1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:52.400
 Don't just give me pain all the time.

1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:53.960
 The yang and the yang.

1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:55.880
 So you mentioned the glass and the iPhone.

1:51:55.880 --> 1:52:00.960
 So you wanted to, not just the iPod, not just Nest, you wanted to keep figures in the creation

1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:02.440
 of the iPhone.

1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:04.160
 What's the interesting aspects?

1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:08.040
 What's the good, the bad, and the ugly of the origin story of the iPhone?

1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:13.160
 Again, this is a Netflix series that spans multiple seasons.

1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:14.160
 So what?

1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:15.160
 Change by flight, please.

1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:16.160
 Yeah.

1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:19.520
 What was the, what's interesting memories you have from the finding?

1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:33.400
 So the pain and the joy that was foundational to the iPod, all the CDs you had to lug around.

1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:38.760
 What was the pain and the joy and the vision of the iPhone in your mind and the mind of

1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:42.280
 the team, Steve's mind and so on?

1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:44.400
 Well, you know, there's multiple pains.

1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:47.800
 You have to also look, there's not just customer pain, but there's business pain.

1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:48.800
 Okay.

1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:54.560
 And it's about the, so Apple now is getting out of that place where it was in 2001.

1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:56.720
 Now people are starting to pay attention.

1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:58.560
 Apple's starting to get in the culture again.

1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:00.440
 It's becoming relevant.

1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:02.200
 Cash is starting to flow.

1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:10.720
 iPod is 60% of that, of the revenue, total revenue of Apple doing on 85% market share.

1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:12.000
 You're starting to get a win at your back.

1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:13.200
 You got confidence.

1:53:13.200 --> 1:53:18.840
 Like Apple had been beaten down since probably the first time the Mac was, since the Mac,

1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:21.640
 it was a beaten company ever since the Mac.

1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:25.440
 So we're talking 15 years at that point, right?

1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:30.160
 This is the first time you're seeing like, and Steve would proudly came in front of us

1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:36.160
 and said, today I can tell you all of the employees, we are now out of debt.

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:38.400
 We paid off our debt.

1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:42.520
 It was a joyous moment for him, right?

1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:47.800
 And then ultimately for our team because no more debt, wonderful, right?

1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:54.200
 So now what you have is you have this successful thing changing the face of Apple and you hear

1:53:54.200 --> 1:54:01.160
 these heavy stomping footsteps of the mobile phone industry, boom.

1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:03.440
 And it's the feature phones at that time.

1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:04.640
 They're adding cameras.

1:54:04.640 --> 1:54:06.320
 They're adding color displays.

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:10.920
 They're seeing the success of the iPod and going, that's just music.

1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:13.080
 We have some storage.

1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:18.320
 We can load music on our phones and we can do what the iPod does plus more.

1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:19.320
 Boom.

1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:20.320
 Boom.

1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:21.320
 Boom.

1:54:21.320 --> 1:54:22.320
 Boom.

1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:23.320
 Right?

1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:27.160
 And you're like, and how many hundreds of millions of them are being sold at that point?

1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:31.720
 It wasn't billions yet, but it was still 100 million, 200 million a year.

1:54:31.720 --> 1:54:32.720
 iPod hadn't gotten there.

1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:36.800
 40, 40, 50 million, something like that.

1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:41.640
 So now you're like, okay, what are we going to do about this, you know, Goliath who wants

1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:44.640
 to take our lunch, right?

1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:46.960
 The school yard bully.

1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:51.600
 And so there was one, let's partner with them.

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:54.440
 So iTunes Music Store was there.

1:54:54.440 --> 1:55:00.680
 All of these phones are going to need music so they can come to the iTunes Music Store

1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:04.520
 and get that music for those phones because it wasn't just about the hardware player at

1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:05.520
 that point.

1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:09.120
 It was about the software that you need on the desktop and the content that you needed

1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.120
 to download.

1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:14.840
 So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool as Steve would always refer to it.

1:55:14.840 --> 1:55:19.000
 So now the mobile phone industry, okay, we're going to work with them.

1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:27.080
 They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically inside of a phone, can have 99 songs total

1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:31.280
 and they're going to come to our store and you're going to, I was like, okay, great.

1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:32.440
 It's all going to be well and good.

1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:35.120
 And that became the Motorola rocker project.

1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:38.520
 It was Apple and Motorola getting together.

1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:43.540
 There's going to be software on this smartphone or not smartphone, but feature phone to cook

1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:45.560
 to iTunes to get your music.

1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:49.240
 It wasn't even downloadable over a cloud or anything because that wasn't available yet.

1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:54.440
 There wasn't have duty data networks yet.

1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:56.640
 It was a disaster from the beginning.

1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:01.920
 Two different cultures, two different types of leadership styles, not necessarily the

1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:06.240
 most competent engineers on the other side.

1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.320
 And it turned out to be an absolute horrible disaster.

1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:12.760
 I watched the pains because luckily I didn't have to be a part of it.

1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:17.320
 I watched the pains on Jeff Robbins face each time we would meet and he would be like, these

1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:20.680
 guys are just, you know, like, really?

1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:21.920
 Do we have to do this, Steve?

1:56:21.920 --> 1:56:24.240
 And he's like, we're contractually obviated.

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:28.960
 And when it came out on stage and Steve showed it, it was maybe a one minute, you know, Steve

1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:32.960
 loves those extended, you know, like drawn up, it might have been a one minute, two minute

1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:33.960
 kind of thing.

1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:36.760
 And he literally threw that phone out of his hand as fast as he could.

1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:37.760
 Yeah.

1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:38.760
 Right.

1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:39.760
 Because it was horrible.

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.600
 So that, so there was the pain of we're not going to partner.

1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:47.440
 So if we can't partner with these guys, we have to become one of them to actually compete.

1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:54.880
 To save the thing that is bringing Apple from, you know, that 15 years of malaise, right?

1:56:54.880 --> 1:57:04.480
 So then from that, we were made a prototype of an iPod plus phone, a classic with, it

1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:08.000
 was an iPod, but it had a phone inside with all the music and all the other stuff.

1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.320
 And you use your headset, wired headset to do the audio, right?

1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:18.960
 And there was another project at the same time, because we were doing videos in the,

1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:25.000
 the iTunes music store, iTunes video store for music videos and movies.

1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.240
 And it would be a full screen iPod.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:32.040
 So instead of the classic, the way you know it, it would be full screen and it would have

1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:34.120
 a virtual click wheel.

1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:38.800
 You'd have a virtual like single touch touchscreen that you could scroll, right?

1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:42.160
 Think of maybe an iPhone like you know it, right?

1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:46.400
 And then there was a third project going on, not in, those two were going on in my team,

1:57:46.400 --> 1:57:58.400
 but the third project going on was the multi touchscreen technology to drive a Mac tablet.

1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:03.800
 And so that Mac tablet, that, that touchscreen technology, there was just way too much you

1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:08.440
 had to change on the software and everything to be able to use a tablet, right?

1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:09.440
 We see this all the time.

1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:12.640
 People like, there's not enough tablet apps today that are modified for tablet, they're

1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:14.880
 just phone apps that are grown up, right?

1:58:14.880 --> 1:58:17.440
 So then they would just be Mac touch stuff.

1:58:17.440 --> 1:58:20.440
 So you'd have to have a whole developer community.

1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:23.600
 That probably wasn't the best place to take that technology first.

1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:27.640
 So you take that technology, marry it with the full screen iPod, and the phone stuff

1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:32.560
 we were working because of the iPod phone with a rotary dial was just like a rotary phone.

1:58:32.560 --> 1:58:37.420
 We couldn't make that interface work well for data input.

1:58:37.420 --> 1:58:42.280
 You put those three together and now those were those, those three things that then created

1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:49.640
 the form or the technology and the form inside what would become the iPhone, married with

1:58:49.640 --> 1:58:55.400
 a bunch of low level software from the iPod and manufacturer software and drivers and

1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:03.840
 communication stuff, combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS.

1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:09.040
 And I mean that in the best way, it means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little.

1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:14.040
 It was totally, things were hacked out and changed and new code was inserted and it really

1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:20.560
 was a whole set of things from all different places to make that first iPhone OS.

1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:24.360
 And then there was another team working on the apps and then another team working on

1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:27.640
 the design of how it looked overall between all that stuff.

1:59:27.640 --> 1:59:33.000
 So all of those things came together to create what we know as the first generation iPhone.

1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:39.880
 And those are all probably fascinating engineering challenges and great teams like the creating

1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:42.600
 Frankenstein OS.

1:59:42.600 --> 1:59:46.200
 That's fascinating because you're simplifying, simplifying, but then you're just pulling

1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:50.480
 different stuff from and you're basically inventing, I mean, they're probably not thinking

1:59:50.480 --> 1:59:57.240
 of it that way, but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer really is Frankenstein.

1:59:57.240 --> 1:59:58.240
 Right.

1:59:58.240 --> 1:59:59.700
 And you didn't have to run Mac software.

1:59:59.700 --> 2:00:04.520
 If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time like Windows and stuff, they were

2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:08.960
 like, we need to make sure it runs Excel and it runs Word or something like that in some

2:00:08.960 --> 2:00:09.960
 reduced thing.

2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:12.780
 This was like, no, no, no, no, this was born out of entertainment.

2:00:12.780 --> 2:00:17.160
 So we didn't have to go and take all the same application.

2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:19.280
 All those other ones was about compatibility.

2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:22.120
 This was about a whole new way of being.

2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:31.600
 What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation of the iPhone, the sort of the first iPhone,

2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:34.960
 phone, internet communicator, and the iPod in your pocket?

2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:41.240
 Yeah, you're going to sort of present the announcing three new products kind of thing

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.960
 and then saying that it's all in one.

2:00:43.960 --> 2:00:44.960
 This is a good example.

2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:52.880
 This is one of the sort of historic presentations of a product.

2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:56.800
 Clearly there's like some showmanship that works, some reason it works.

2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:57.960
 It doesn't always work.

2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:03.720
 It often doesn't work, but in this case, it often did for Steve.

2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:06.720
 How did that feel?

2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:12.320
 What part of the actually, the design process was that presentation?

2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:17.180
 You know what I mean, like from the early, because he said, so consider the why, the

2:01:17.180 --> 2:01:19.760
 press release at the very beginning.

2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:21.360
 Steve was doing that the entire time.

2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:24.720
 He was working on that story from day one.

2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:29.160
 He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this, and then he would look at our faces

2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:33.000
 because you wouldn't, most people wouldn't, at least if you're working for him, wouldn't

2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:37.160
 tell him what you really thought of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces.

2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:44.440
 And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidence outside of the organization and

2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:45.960
 see what they thought, right?

2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:49.800
 And they could give him feedback on it and they could really challenge him, but he would

2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:51.720
 also look at their faces and go, hmm.

2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:56.940
 And so when you see that, then he would modulate it and change it slightly and change it.

2:01:56.940 --> 2:02:01.560
 So he was working during all of that time on the story and the storytelling, right?

2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:05.920
 And the why's, while we're working on that and helping us refine it, just like the switch

2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:08.800
 from plastic to glass, right?

2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:10.280
 All the time working on that.

2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:15.480
 So when he comes out on stage, he does something that every marketer is told not to do.

2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:19.280
 Say, these three things are now combined in one.

2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:24.520
 That is like the, that they say that that is the laziest form of storytelling possible

2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:26.880
 for marketing, right?

2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:27.880
 Yeah.

2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:28.880
 Right?

2:02:28.880 --> 2:02:31.360
 But it was the best one because it was all those pains.

2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:36.680
 It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications and I want my internet browsing

2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:40.840
 because I want it on the go so I can look up things because it was in information.

2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:45.840
 And when you were on the road, you had a laptop, you had an iPod and you had a phone that,

2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:49.160
 and you had to carry all of these things with you at once.

2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:53.040
 Now we're going to solve that pain for you and put it all together.

2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:56.240
 So he was just showing you the pain and beating that virus of doubt and going, it's now in

2:02:56.240 --> 2:02:58.440
 this one magical thing.

2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:02.520
 And he could come up and masterfully tell that story because he told it almost every

2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:07.000
 day to all of these people inside very quietly.

2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.360
 And then it was just, right?

2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:14.720
 It was like a, you know, a Tony award winning play that had been worked on for 10 years.

2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:16.720
 But also the human came through of timing.

2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:17.720
 Of course.

2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:18.720
 It was all that.

2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:23.680
 And of course he was dramatic at certain points and he would raise his voice and a rise smile

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:24.680
 or whatever.

2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:25.680
 Right.

2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:26.680
 It was all those touches.

2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:28.800
 It was an actor as well as a storyteller.

2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:29.800
 Yeah.

2:03:29.800 --> 2:03:32.760
 But it was the truth, right?

2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:34.080
 The truth came through.

2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:36.600
 It was a nonfiction story.

2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:41.760
 And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it for dramatic effect.

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:45.440
 It's amazing.

2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:52.080
 So there's a designer you mentioned, Johnny Yav.

2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.680
 You both are brilliant designers, great human beings.

2:03:55.680 --> 2:04:01.680
 There were some battles fought in the distant past between the two of you.

2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:05.920
 Looking back, what is the positive characteristics of Johnny that made you a better person and

2:04:05.920 --> 2:04:14.200
 designer having worked with him?

2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:20.160
 Watching the process that the design team that Johnny led.

2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:22.040
 I don't know where, because that was over years.

2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:23.520
 I didn't see all of those things.

2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:29.960
 But watching the design process, because it was really a team that was about materials.

2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:31.480
 It was about form.

2:04:31.480 --> 2:04:32.760
 It was about colors.

2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:37.040
 It was about these physical characteristics.

2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:38.920
 When we talked about this earlier, it was design.

2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:39.920
 What is design?

2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:41.200
 Design is everywhere.

2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:47.760
 So what they were really focused on was form, how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics,

2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:50.520
 the physical aesthetics.

2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:56.480
 And watching, going through that process, I learned so much in that process.

2:04:56.480 --> 2:05:07.560
 About how to do colors, how to do materials, how to think deeply about curves and shadows,

2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:12.160
 and how it would look not just in your hand, but how it would look in the photograph you

2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:14.920
 were going to take from marketing.

2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:19.920
 So how it would look, how it would feel, all of it.

2:05:19.920 --> 2:05:28.720
 It was all of those physical things around that and watching the process to get there.

2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:31.240
 That was enlightening for me.

2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:37.280
 It opened my mind to go, oh, okay, just like there's a process for all these other things.

2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:42.640
 It wasn't just magic and you say, ha, there it is.

2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:47.360
 It was really a process of refinement, of opening the funnel at the beginning and refining

2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:53.920
 down over time to get to that final and selecting and doing the selection.

2:05:53.920 --> 2:05:59.000
 And certain types you could, certain times there were opinion based design details, but

2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:05.520
 a lot of data, a lot of data driven designs of what can we deliver in volume?

2:06:05.520 --> 2:06:06.640
 What can we do different things?

2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:09.800
 So you always had these constraints that you had to work with under.

2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:15.480
 And sometimes they and the team, not just I would say, we need this and we're like,

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:20.000
 we can't deliver that, but maybe we were able to work together to find different design

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:25.480
 characteristics and different implementation characteristics that could get to that point

2:06:25.480 --> 2:06:27.640
 without what they were describing.

2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:33.200
 And instead of, yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, let's find some other way to solve the problem

2:06:33.200 --> 2:06:34.200
 together.

2:06:34.200 --> 2:06:35.200
 Yeah.

2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:42.280
 And I've seen this in several companies have more closely interacted with like Tesla is

2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:50.720
 an example, sometimes, you know, talking about curves sometimes is very painful on the engineering

2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:55.680
 side to deliver a very specific kind of absolute thing.

2:06:55.680 --> 2:07:01.360
 And one question that comes up in my mind is like, well, how far should we go to try

2:07:01.360 --> 2:07:09.440
 to deliver a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature or in like the whatever the

2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:15.920
 form factor is in a color or the material, when the cost is like 10x to deliver, not

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:22.720
 financially, but just like an effort, how many, how many problems to have to solve.

2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:23.720
 I don't know.

2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:29.400
 I don't know if you can say any wisdom to that because when you're thinking about curves,

2:07:29.400 --> 2:07:35.120
 you're designing in the space of ideas, you're like platonic forms kind of thing, not always

2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:40.920
 grounded to like how much this is, how much pain is going to be involved in delivering

2:07:40.920 --> 2:07:47.280
 this, but that's as you should perhaps, because then if you're always thinking about the pain

2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:52.240
 required to deliver this thing, you'll be too conservative, you wouldn't do the wild

2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:53.240
 ideas.

2:07:53.240 --> 2:07:55.440
 Oh, right, exactly.

2:07:55.440 --> 2:07:58.600
 But you have to understand again the why behind it.

2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:04.640
 And at Nest, when we had limited resources, you know, putting a screwdriver in the box,

2:08:04.640 --> 2:08:10.000
 a custom design screwdriver in the box was born out of those experiences I had at Apple

2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:15.360
 and seeing how you can create something that's emotional, it's part of marketing and it's

2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:20.360
 part of the product experience overall, even though it seems extraneous.

2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:26.120
 I went back and made the design team and the mechanical team changed some curves on the

2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:31.360
 Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector we did at Nest, after they had already tooled

2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:32.360
 it.

2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:35.560
 And they're saying this cost more, I said, it doesn't look right.

2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:39.400
 There is a, but they're like, oh, well, we had, I said, no, you're going to go back and

2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:40.440
 you're going to make that change.

2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:43.160
 I told you, you want, we needed to do it.

2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:45.480
 We had a better looking model that is going to get done.

2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:50.760
 I know it's going to be a terrible cost to you, but we already had this discussion and

2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:52.320
 that's the way it's going to have to be.

2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:56.840
 And I'm sorry, but it is what it is.

2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:00.200
 You know, because it's better for the customer and it looks better in the pictures and all

2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:01.200
 other stuff.

2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:02.320
 We did it and it was great.

2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:07.280
 And everyone agreed it was great at the end, but it was pain to get there.

2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:11.320
 Those are where, those little details are where the magic comes out, right?

2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:17.360
 And you know, if you don't do, if you don't take those pains and put in the love the customer

2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:21.040
 is going to feel, it's going to feel, they're either going to feel the pain or they're going

2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:23.920
 to feel the love if you put it in, right?

2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:28.320
 So it depends on, you know, how much time and effort you want to put into something

2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:30.280
 and what really matters to you.

2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:32.640
 And so how you communicate what you do.

2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:38.880
 We're human beings after all, is there something you've learned from sort of the, the tensions

2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:44.000
 that are natural or that happen in teams when they're passionate and they're trying to

2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:45.520
 solve these problems?

2:09:45.520 --> 2:09:49.880
 Is that the way of life and there's the human drama?

2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:54.400
 Is that just, is that always going, is that, it is what it is?

2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:58.800
 Is that make you better actually that the drama of the tension between personalities

2:09:58.800 --> 2:10:00.680
 and all that kind of stuff?

2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:06.560
 Look, a roller coaster ride without ups and downs is no fun.

2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:08.120
 It's the journey.

2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:12.800
 It's the journey that brings, it brings out the best in everyone.

2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:19.920
 We're forged, we're tempered by those experiences, not all the ups, but also the downs.

2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:22.280
 And that's when you get the humanity and the connection.

2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.400
 And we can tell these stories till we're blue in the face and smile every time because we

2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:32.320
 did something together that we, each of us couldn't do a part, but when it comes together,

2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:34.120
 that's where all the emotions happen.

2:10:34.120 --> 2:10:37.800
 And that's where, if it's born out of the right reasons and the right story and the

2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:42.240
 right way, that's where the magic happens, not just for the customer, but for how it

2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:45.520
 transforms each person who is working on it.

2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.240
 And they will never forget those experiences in their life, positively and negatively that

2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:54.640
 happened at the time, but they look back and it's only positive because they did something

2:10:54.640 --> 2:10:56.920
 that mattered.

2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:04.280
 Had another brilliant idea that you brought to life is Nest, Nest thermostats and the

2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:07.120
 big umbrella of Nest.

2:11:07.120 --> 2:11:16.560
 Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three, what was the most memorable, the most

2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:25.640
 painful, the most insight, lead and challenge you had to overcome to bring Nest to life?

2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:38.040
 Well, the first thing for me was making someone care about their thermostat.

2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:39.640
 No one considers it.

2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:41.720
 They never had any customer choice.

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:43.240
 They didn't install it.

2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:47.200
 They usually don't even use it because it's so complicated or what have you.

2:11:47.200 --> 2:11:48.800
 They just, they bitch at it.

2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:54.360
 They hide it in the corner and then they just pay the bill of whatever it is.

2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:58.240
 It's totally unloved, unconsidered.

2:11:58.240 --> 2:11:59.600
 So how do you wake up?

2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:03.760
 Like I said, the virus of doubt, how do you wake that up and get people going, remember

2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:07.200
 every day when you go in and it's like, you're just frustrated and then you get the bill

2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:08.200
 and you pay the bill.

2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:09.200
 So you have to do that.

2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:10.200
 So that was one thing.

2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:14.080
 I think the other big one was not delivering, it was, all of it was hard.

2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:15.080
 It was constrained.

2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:16.360
 We had only so much stuff.

2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:17.800
 We were bootstrapped.

2:12:17.800 --> 2:12:19.120
 We didn't have massive funding.

2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:22.480
 We didn't get hundreds of millions of dollars, but we did it for the right reasons.

2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:27.920
 But I think the other big part of it was not just building a disruptive product because

2:12:27.920 --> 2:12:29.720
 a lot of the people on the team had done that.

2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:35.400
 We knew what we were doing and that was, if we got the design right, we could deliver

2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:40.680
 it with enough time.

2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:43.000
 It was getting the disruptive go to market.

2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:47.300
 In other words, how to take that product from the end of the production line and get it

2:12:47.300 --> 2:12:55.080
 into the customer's hands because there was no retail or customer choice in thermostats.

2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:57.840
 No one even, it was never considered purchase.

2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:00.320
 They never thought they had choice.

2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:05.440
 Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack, told them, looked around, looked at

2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:10.200
 their house and said, this looks like somebody who's got as well to do.

2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:13.240
 This thermostat is not going to cost you $350.

2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:14.240
 Thank you very much.

2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:17.440
 And you're like, I'll take whatever you give me.

2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:21.800
 And then it goes into another house, it's worth $100, it was the same damn thing.

2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:23.400
 So there was no price transparency.

2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:24.400
 There was no choice.

2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.760
 You just got what you were given.

2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:30.880
 So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry.

2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:36.080
 That's why there was no innovation in it because it was doing just fine because every house

2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:38.000
 needed them.

2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:47.720
 All the installers were programmed by the product deliverers, by bonuses and bonuses

2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:50.680
 to say, you're going to only carry our product, and if you sell this many, you're going to

2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:53.680
 get a free trip to Hawaii.

2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:58.240
 And for these guys who install, I get a free trip to Hawaii, that's dream for them.

2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:03.400
 So this whole channel was fully controlled by the product guys, and it was almost monopolistic

2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:05.160
 in a way.

2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:07.160
 So how do you go around that?

2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:13.160
 So creating a disruptive go to market channel, one was direct to consumer, right?

2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:18.120
 And all the marketing that was necessary to get that message across.

2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:21.920
 Another one was getting the installation right.

2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:24.540
 No one was self installing thermostats.

2:14:24.540 --> 2:14:30.720
 So how do we get enough people who are early adopters to be able to self install them confidently?

2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:35.080
 So they didn't still have to call the guy to come and install it because then he would

2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:36.320
 say, this is a crap product.

2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:38.480
 No, I got the most better product, right?

2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:40.840
 So you had to get rid of that friction.

2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:44.760
 And then ultimately, how do you get the people who were not just early adopters, but people

2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:47.640
 who needed to see it and touch it before they bought it?

2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:53.400
 How do you get that into retail when the large brands of the time of thermostats and Home

2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:58.560
 Depot and Lowe's had contracts that they couldn't bring in any other brands?

2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:03.420
 They were owning the channel all the way to where there was any sort of slight customer

2:15:03.420 --> 2:15:09.400
 choice and it was really contractor choice more than it was and consumer choice.

2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:13.680
 So all of that had to be innovated along with the product.

2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:17.560
 And so to me, that was a huge challenge and something I had never done.

2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:18.560
 Most of us had never done.

2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:23.960
 And we had to create, that was as much as a project as actually delivering the product

2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:26.200
 itself.

2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:31.200
 So it turned out to be a giant hit.

2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:36.760
 And it was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion.

2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:43.280
 As a founder and leader, just out of curiosity, in these cases of acquisition, is it always

2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:44.760
 a good thing?

2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:50.160
 Is there any part of you and the team that considered saying no?

2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:54.780
 We considered saying no all the way along the process, right?

2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:58.080
 We had all been in big companies before.

2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:03.240
 We knew what it was like and the politics and all the other stuff and what I came to

2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:08.840
 learn, especially from Phillips, because Phillips was a very, it was 375,000 people.

2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:12.000
 It was a big, it was massive company, right?

2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:13.600
 And tons of politics.

2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:15.280
 And I was like, do we want to go back into that work?

2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:19.560
 Because I had so many negative experiences from that.

2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:23.680
 But then going to Apple, which was not big, but it was big enough that it could have all

2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:24.760
 these dynamics.

2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:29.480
 But then when you saw a leader rise up and get rid of those dynamics or not allow many

2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:36.440
 of them to flourish, then you're like, oh, with the right leadership, this can be a beautiful

2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:38.080
 marriage, right?

2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:42.760
 And so for four months, we were working together with them, with Google, to make sure that

2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:46.240
 we had the right leadership and we were going to be in the right environment that it felt

2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:47.920
 right.

2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:48.920
 So that happened.

2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:50.120
 It absolutely happened.

2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:51.120
 We worked on all the details.

2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:53.280
 We didn't even talk about price.

2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:56.840
 We were talking about how's the brand going to work, who's the team going to work with,

2:16:56.840 --> 2:17:00.600
 how are we going to get IP, how are we going to do exchanges, how are we going to get budgets

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:01.600
 and all that stuff done.

2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:04.480
 So we worked through all of that before we actually sealed any kind of deal because they

2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:05.880
 were already investor in the company.

2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:12.080
 So we already knew, they knew relatively where the end point was for the price.

2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:20.040
 So working through all those prerequisites, I knew that as a individual product company

2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:25.040
 that was trying to create a platform, no investors were going to invest in a platform

2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:30.240
 that could take three, four years and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to build

2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:34.960
 without all kinds of new products at the same time and products that we were having, which

2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:37.600
 were successes, but they weren't even break even yet, right?

2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:39.480
 We were still developing them.

2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.000
 So how are we going to get more people to fund all of these things and this platform

2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.240
 that I really want to create?

2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:50.240
 Because my worry, and I had seen this many times in Silicon Valley, is these small startups

2:17:50.240 --> 2:17:54.720
 have bravado and they said, I'm going to take on the big guys, right?

2:17:54.720 --> 2:18:00.160
 With a platform, but when those platform guys show up and Apple says they're going to get

2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:05.080
 in the home, at the time, nobody cared, they were, they were curiously, yeah, it's curious.

2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:06.080
 What's next?

2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:07.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:08.080
 But Apple wasn't in the market.

2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:10.480
 Google wasn't in the market yet.

2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:11.480
 Amazon wasn't there.

2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:15.760
 Microsoft, Samsung, they were not, they were all just, that's curious.

2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:16.760
 Right?

2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:17.760
 Yeah.

2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:22.280
 And I had watched, if you said, I'm going to go challenge them, and I'm going to build

2:18:22.280 --> 2:18:26.160
 a platform, and then they all of a sudden one by one go, oh, well, we're building a

2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:27.160
 platform now.

2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:28.160
 We're building a platform.

2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:32.160
 They fudded you to death, fear, uncertainty, doubt, and the developers run away and you

2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:33.160
 can't make that platform.

2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:37.960
 So I'm like, before the landscape gets changed on us, because we've tracked so much attention,

2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:43.800
 they announced something, we need to change the landscape on them.

2:18:43.800 --> 2:18:48.080
 Let's go to the best place where we can build out the platform, have the right leadership

2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:52.600
 behind us, to help us grow this thing into what the vision it should be.

2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:56.920
 And that's what we believe we were doing with the Google acquisition.

2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:00.280
 Is it possible to take on the platforms?

2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:04.560
 So you said there's a lot of startups with Bravado and all that kind of stuff.

2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:05.560
 Right.

2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:10.000
 It doesn't mean, James Joyce, when he was 20, said, I'm going to be the greatest writer

2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:15.880
 of the 20th century before he wrote anything of value.

2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:17.680
 One of them might be actually right.

2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:26.520
 Yeah, in this modern world, so first of all, people should definitely get your book built

2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:36.320
 as just this giant number of advice on this exact question of how to build cool things,

2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:41.800
 how to build a startup, how to all the different stages of that team and hiring.

2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:43.200
 It's mostly human nature.

2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:44.200
 It's not technical.

2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:46.480
 It's mostly human nature behind it.

2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:51.480
 And it turns out it's, you know, turtles all the way down, that's human at the bottom.

2:19:51.480 --> 2:20:00.120
 Yes, so is it possible to build startups that take on the big guys, whatever that is, of

2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:01.280
 the modern era?

2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:05.440
 So for now, it's these platforms of Apple, Google, Twitter.

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:08.800
 I don't even know, Meta, I guess, called now.

2:20:08.800 --> 2:20:09.800
 Sure.

2:20:09.800 --> 2:20:11.840
 Is it possible to take them on?

2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:12.840
 Absolutely.

2:20:12.840 --> 2:20:15.320
 But you don't take them on on their same turf.

2:20:15.320 --> 2:20:20.560
 You take them on on the turf they're going to want to have in the future, right?

2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:21.680
 Spotify is a platform.

2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:26.160
 It started as an application, is now a platform, right?

2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:28.760
 Think of WeChat.

2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:33.760
 Think of all the super apps out there that are now wallets and delivery services and

2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:39.440
 travel services and transportation services all within an app.

2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:43.400
 They've innovated in a different level, in a different space that the platform companies

2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:44.400
 weren't.

2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:45.400
 Right?

2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:49.520
 Or they, you know, Google was an app, it was an app company.

2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:51.280
 It was solving search.

2:20:51.280 --> 2:20:53.240
 And then it became a platform company.

2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:55.320
 Apple was solving personal computing.

2:20:55.320 --> 2:21:01.040
 And then it became, or iPhone was doing, you know, solving internet browsing, all that

2:21:01.040 --> 2:21:02.040
 stuff.

2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:04.480
 And then a platform company went to the app store was at it.

2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:07.720
 If you look it out, there's no such thing as building a platform company.

2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:15.040
 You build a great app first and then you can expand it and have the right to become a platform.

2:21:15.040 --> 2:21:19.360
 Your whole book is just a bunch of advice for young people.

2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:20.360
 But let me ask you.

2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:21.360
 And older people?

2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:25.440
 Well, everyone is young at heart and if you're not, you should be.

2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:30.160
 So in terms of picking a career, you have advice on this point.

2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:35.400
 What advice would you give to a person on how to pick a career?

2:21:35.400 --> 2:21:37.520
 What is it you want to learn?

2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:39.640
 And who is it you want to learn from?

2:21:39.640 --> 2:21:44.880
 Just like you pick a university, you're like, I want to go here for this expertise.

2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:50.000
 I've heard about these programs, especially graduate, graduate studies.

2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.800
 You go for a certain program with a certain set of people.

2:21:52.800 --> 2:21:58.520
 Why don't you do that when it comes to, you know, a job you just don't go or in a career.

2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:01.720
 You just don't go and say, I just want to go work at Google or I just want to work at

2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:02.720
 Apple.

2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:07.200
 You want to go to a certain team with a certain set of people and work with them on something

2:22:07.200 --> 2:22:10.160
 that you're really curious about and you want to learn about.

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:19.560
 I just want to comment that it's such a subtle but a brilliant framing of just ask the question,

2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:29.680
 what do I want to learn and then see what career path is going to maximize that.

2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:31.200
 That's so interesting.

2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:36.160
 It's the first question I ask anyone who interviews with me when I say I'm going to bring somebody

2:22:36.160 --> 2:22:37.160
 on the team.

2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:39.600
 First question is, what do you want to learn?

2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:43.720
 I don't want the expert like we talked about earlier says, I'm the expert in this.

2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:46.200
 You're going to hire me as the expert.

2:22:46.200 --> 2:22:47.760
 We're doing something new.

2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:50.360
 We're not an expert because we're not an expert either.

2:22:50.360 --> 2:22:56.600
 What is it you want to learn?

2:22:56.600 --> 2:23:02.320
 On the topic of learning, what is the best way to learn?

2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:10.960
 What starting, you go into this new place, into this new world, into maybe V1, you said

2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:12.280
 you're building V1.

2:23:12.280 --> 2:23:20.440
 I mean, the whole world is full of V1s or V0s waiting for the V1 to come along.

2:23:20.440 --> 2:23:22.440
 Zero to one.

2:23:22.440 --> 2:23:25.640
 What's the process of that look like?

2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:28.160
 What's the process of learning?

2:23:28.160 --> 2:23:30.000
 How do you learn?

2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:34.400
 Well, let me put a framing and then we'll talk about that last piece.

2:23:34.400 --> 2:23:39.880
 I have now looking back, especially writing this book, I have a version one of myself,

2:23:39.880 --> 2:23:43.200
 a version two, a version three, a version four.

2:23:43.200 --> 2:23:47.960
 I had a lot of opinions about myself and what I wanted to do.

2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:52.520
 Sometimes those opinions for certain people, those opinions are formed and they get the

2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:57.600
 data from their parents and they go do what their parents told them to do or their surroundings.

2:23:57.600 --> 2:23:59.600
 My opinions was like, I want to go and learn this.

2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:00.600
 I'm curious about that.

2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:06.880
 I made the zero to one move and then over time, by doing, I was refining those things

2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:10.560
 and learning what I was really curious about and what I was really good about because I

2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:15.080
 was getting data and then I was like, then I had another set of opinions to create version

2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:17.640
 two of me and then I would go and do it.

2:24:17.640 --> 2:24:22.800
 So I was learning by doing, starting with the opinion, you're not going to get any facts.

2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:27.400
 Most people are like, where do I make the most money from my position?

2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:30.720
 They're trying to start with data.

2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:32.800
 Start with the why.

2:24:32.800 --> 2:24:33.960
 What's your curiosity?

2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:37.320
 What do you want to learn and then follow that?

2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:43.520
 I took the lowest job on the totem pole at General Magic because I wanted to get in there

2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:44.840
 to work with the right team.

2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:51.560
 I didn't even know what they were doing, but I thought that it felt right.

2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:55.800
 I was barely living above the poverty line working there, working 80 hours a week because

2:24:55.800 --> 2:24:59.520
 it was so amazing to learn just like a college student.

2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:01.080
 That's what I was doing.

2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:06.400
 And then I learned more from that and then changed those opinions into data and then

2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:07.920
 I found other opinions.

2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:11.840
 So it's the same thing, but it was by doing.

2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:15.120
 The way you find out what you want to do in life is by figuring out what you don't want

2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:16.120
 to do.

2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:22.040
 And the only way you find that out is by doing a bunch of stuff and refining it.

2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:23.040
 That's hilarious.

2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:24.960
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:31.680
 So in terms of the career path of leaping into the startup world and launching a startup,

2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:37.920
 what does it take to successfully found a startup, to have a chance to succeed?

2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:46.880
 And maybe how do you decide to take that leap?

2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:53.840
 Is there sort of having found it, having been part of many V1s, many of some of the most

2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:59.120
 successful V1s ever, what's it take to take that leap?

2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:06.640
 Maybe leave your job, a cushy job at a company and do the startup.

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:08.840
 What does it take?

2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:11.040
 It takes belief in yourself.

2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:12.680
 That's the first thing.

2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:18.040
 Belief that you can do it, not but hopefully with mirrors or mentors around you or coaches

2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:21.480
 around you to make sure you know you're not crazy.

2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:26.840
 It's a crazy smart idea, but you're not crazy and you're just working on something as a

2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:31.440
 lone mad man or woman.

2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:36.800
 You have a great idea and like I said, great ideas chase you.

2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:41.680
 In this world, there are so many people who have more ideas than they have time to implement.

2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:42.880
 I used to be like that.

2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:47.440
 I would like, oh my God, I have this idea, this idea, and you try to do all of them.

2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.640
 But the best ideas are the ones that you can really focus on and you shut out all those

2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:55.040
 other things and you bring them other ideas into the thing you're trying to do.

2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:00.040
 So I try to run away from a great idea and then it stalks me.

2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:03.560
 It hunts you down because you're like, ah, that's going to have this problem.

2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:05.480
 I'm going to put it aside.

2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:10.480
 And then all of a sudden, a few days later, oh, I think I know how to solve that problem

2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:15.600
 or I talked to somebody and you're just always kind of niggling around the edges of it.

2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:20.360
 And then at some point, it's like, it just becomes like this black hole that just sucks

2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:23.480
 you and you're like, I can't think about anything else but this.

2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:26.760
 It's almost like a relationship in the world, right?

2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:33.200
 When you have it with a, you find your partner, you know, you're like, hmm, wait, hmm, something.

2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:36.920
 And then you're trying to, and then all of a sudden it just, it comes together, right?

2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:37.920
 It's kind of like that.

2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:41.240
 Ultimately, Chief Folk, see, I'm different, I just dive right in.

2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:42.240
 I used to do that too.

2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:43.480
 I used to dive right in.

2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:44.480
 Yeah.

2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:49.880
 And then I learned that you need time to run away from it and so it chases you because

2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:52.600
 it makes you think harder about that story.

2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:54.000
 This is not dating advice.

2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:57.920
 We're talking about data.

2:27:57.920 --> 2:28:05.480
 But ultimately, so you have a chief focus on it, but you also said to believe in yourself.

2:28:05.480 --> 2:28:11.560
 It's not necessarily even the idea, it's the human that believe in the human being.

2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:16.520
 You have to believe in yourself and the idea that you have because if you don't have that

2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:24.200
 belief, then you can't project that to other people to say, join the team.

2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:29.680
 Let me ask you on, because you mentioned mentors and you've talked about having had incredible

2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:30.960
 mentors in your life.

2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:34.760
 You're also a mentor to a very large number of people.

2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:36.600
 What does it take to find a mentor?

2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:40.440
 How do you, how do you find a great mentor?

2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:42.960
 Actually they also find you.

2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:44.960
 Is it like with the ideas?

2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:51.560
 No, no, no, what happens is you're in the right, you have a community around you.

2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:55.720
 Because you've been building a network, because you can't do it alone, so you have to create

2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:00.880
 this network around you of relationships that don't, not transactions, but relationships

2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:05.000
 over time that you really cherish and people you talk to.

2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:11.720
 When you share vulnerable or nascent ideas with, or crazy opinions with, and then you

2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:18.520
 argue them through, but you start to see resonate, and it's not about age.

2:29:18.520 --> 2:29:20.600
 It's just about this connection.

2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:25.400
 I have mentors, obviously when I was young, all my mentors were older, and as I get older,

2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:28.680
 I have mentors who are younger than me or the same age.

2:29:28.680 --> 2:29:31.320
 They're not all just older.

2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:35.160
 It's about that connection, it's about being on that same wavelength.

2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:39.240
 But they also, they can counterbalance you.

2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:41.400
 They compliment you in some way.

2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:43.840
 My best mentors had nothing to do with technology.

2:29:43.840 --> 2:29:47.880
 They didn't know anything about technology, right, the way we know it.

2:29:47.880 --> 2:29:51.480
 They were all about human nature, and they could reflect that and help me get more human

2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:56.880
 focused and more empathetic, because I was so detailed in the technology, I needed to

2:29:56.880 --> 2:29:58.920
 see from other perspectives.

2:29:58.920 --> 2:30:02.240
 But then they wanted to learn more about the technology, right, or they thought that this

2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:04.880
 idea was so great that it should exist.

2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:06.840
 Now let's work together on that.

2:30:06.840 --> 2:30:11.800
 So it's really, they have to find you and you have to find them, and that's by sharing.

2:30:11.800 --> 2:30:16.800
 You just don't go and look it up on the internet and say, who are the best mentors in the world?

2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:18.760
 It just doesn't work that way.

2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:23.240
 So form and network of people and see where, I mean, it's like finding relationships, finding

2:30:23.240 --> 2:30:27.960
 love and all that kind of friendships.

2:30:27.960 --> 2:30:33.480
 Venture capitalists, money, do VCs help or hurt a business in general?

2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:39.640
 So like in those early stages in the chase of developing a V1, just what's the constructive

2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:46.600
 and destructive power of money in the development of a brilliant idea and the deployment of

2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:48.680
 a brilliant idea?

2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:51.600
 I have seen brilliant venture capitalists.

2:30:51.600 --> 2:30:54.640
 I have seen horrible ones.

2:30:54.640 --> 2:30:59.680
 Ones that care about their LPs more than they care about the entrepreneurs.

2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:03.320
 Of course, everyone's in it, at the end of the day, especially venture capital, they

2:31:03.320 --> 2:31:09.400
 have to give a return to their limited partners, the people who invest in money that they have

2:31:09.400 --> 2:31:13.160
 to shepherd that money and make sure it's watched over properly.

2:31:13.160 --> 2:31:18.000
 But when there's not a balance, a pushback in a venture capitalist between what the LP

2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:23.600
 needs and what the entrepreneur needs, and that the entrepreneur might be trying really

2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:27.720
 hard, but if they don't see, the VC doesn't see, the exit's going to happen in two years

2:31:27.720 --> 2:31:35.280
 and they just leave them hanging, the value exchange is only money and not mentorship

2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:41.160
 or ideas or other things when there's not a relationship but really a transaction.

2:31:41.160 --> 2:31:45.120
 That's when money is toxic because you can get money everywhere.

2:31:45.120 --> 2:31:49.800
 Maybe it's a little harder today over the last month, but you can still find people

2:31:49.800 --> 2:31:57.040
 with money who want to enable your mission and can be mentors.

2:31:57.040 --> 2:32:01.760
 Not always, not all of them, but some of them can be mentors, but they're on your side.

2:32:01.760 --> 2:32:06.200
 Then it's incredibly powerful because it's not just one plus one equals two.

2:32:06.200 --> 2:32:10.040
 It's something bigger than that because then they can bring their networks of people and

2:32:10.040 --> 2:32:14.840
 their networks of companies and other people they worked with that might want to join your

2:32:14.840 --> 2:32:17.400
 mission.

2:32:17.400 --> 2:32:22.480
 That's the kind of venture capitalists and smart money that's out there, but you have

2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:24.180
 to build a relationship.

2:32:24.180 --> 2:32:29.680
 People go, oh, look at that valuation, oh, it's the brand name of the VC that's investing

2:32:29.680 --> 2:32:30.680
 me.

2:32:30.680 --> 2:32:34.840
 No, it boils down to who's that partner and how experienced are they?

2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:36.520
 Don't just give me the brand.

2:32:36.520 --> 2:32:39.880
 Give me the person because that's the person I'm going to be interacting with.

2:32:39.880 --> 2:32:42.080
 There's a million questions.

2:32:42.080 --> 2:32:44.080
 I want to ask you, bro.

2:32:44.080 --> 2:32:45.080
 Season four.

2:32:45.080 --> 2:32:46.920
 We're on season five already.

2:32:46.920 --> 2:32:51.880
 Let me ask you, it seems like out of all the brilliant things you write about, it seems

2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:55.480
 like not an important question, but it's a fascinating one to me as lawyers.

2:32:55.480 --> 2:32:57.760
 You write about this.

2:32:57.760 --> 2:33:03.800
 Does the company need lawyers and why?

2:33:03.800 --> 2:33:04.800
 What kind?

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:07.840
 You write about the value of this game, I guess.

2:33:07.840 --> 2:33:08.840
 It's a game.

2:33:08.840 --> 2:33:13.720
 It's a legal game.

2:33:13.720 --> 2:33:14.720
 Why do we need lawyers?

2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:15.720
 You sound exasperated by lawyers.

2:33:15.720 --> 2:33:17.960
 I don't have a good question, I guess.

2:33:17.960 --> 2:33:21.360
 The why of lawyers.

2:33:21.360 --> 2:33:23.360
 The why of lawyers, yes, exactly.

2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:25.360
 The why of lawyers.

2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:26.360
 Thank you.

2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:30.000
 You even do the question.

2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:33.640
 We just have to put why in front of everything you ask and then we'll be there.

2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:34.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:35.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:36.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:37.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:37.640 --> 2:33:38.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:38.640 --> 2:33:39.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:40.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:41.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:41.640 --> 2:33:42.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:43.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:44.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:45.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:46.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:46.640 --> 2:33:47.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:48.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:48.640 --> 2:33:49.640
 Ask lawyers.

2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:50.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:50.640 --> 2:33:51.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:52.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:53.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:53.640 --> 2:33:54.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:55.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:55.640 --> 2:33:56.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:56.640 --> 2:33:57.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:57.640 --> 2:33:58.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:58.640 --> 2:33:59.640
 Lawyers.

2:33:59.640 --> 2:34:00.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:01.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:02.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:03.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:03.640 --> 2:34:04.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:05.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:06.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:07.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:07.640 --> 2:34:08.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:09.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:10.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:11.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:12.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:13.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:14.640
 Lawyers.

2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:19.200
 Right? And so they can help interpret things a certain way or help push on things a certain way

2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:23.920
 to get changed happen or allow change to happen. Because if you have lawyers who are always,

2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:27.680
 just like you were talking about PR people, if you have lawyers who are always saying no

2:34:27.680 --> 2:34:31.520
 to everything, because their job is to really say no or maybe. They'll never say yes.

2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:36.160
 And you also say their job is to say no and bill you by the hour.

2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:37.600
 Exactly. Exactly.

2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:38.800
 The present.

2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:39.120
 Right?

2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:40.640
 Yeah.

2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:42.000
 If you don't want to know, don't ask them.

2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:42.160
 Yeah.

2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:43.840
 Because you're going to get a no, maybe a maybe.

2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:45.040
 And you'll get charged for it.

2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:46.640
 And you'll get charged for it anyways, right?

2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:54.400
 So to have a partner, to have them on your team, to help you see maybe some of the things you

2:34:54.400 --> 2:35:00.160
 don't see, some consequences, they help to rein that in or change your language. Like,

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:01.520
 are you going to get sued for this ad?

2:35:02.160 --> 2:35:05.200
 Just change this one word and it helps, right?

2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:10.720
 So you need to have a partner. Most of the times, especially engineers or designers,

2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:16.000
 they see lawyers as only stifling. Lawyers can actually, if you do it right and you have the

2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:20.400
 right type, they can actually open up a whole new world for you because of the interpretation

2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:22.000
 and how we go about doing things.

2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.320
 And they help you not get bogged down in the pain of little mistakes that didn't mean anything.

2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.480
 Exactly. You shot yourself in the foot and you didn't even know it.

2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:31.920
 You didn't even know you were carrying the gun.

2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:36.720
 Just to jump around, Charles Bukowski once wrote,

2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:42.960
 find what you love and let it kill you. So the question is about work life balance.

2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:45.760
 That's like finding an idea and let it chase you.

2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:48.320
 Yes, but a little more aggressive.

2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:58.320
 So what does work life balance look like that maximizes success and or happiness?

2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:05.440
 Is there such a thing as work life balance? Can you speak to this?

2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:09.120
 Your work is your life. And I mean that in the positive sense.

2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:16.320
 When you're on a mission that really matters and you know that you can really affect not just

2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:23.040
 yourself but other people's lives, and then that is very rewarding. That's not work.

2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:29.680
 That's like I said, a mission. You adopt that. But that said, you still need to have boundaries

2:36:29.680 --> 2:36:33.760
 yourself. At General Magic, wonderful documentary. If no one's seen it, you got to see that.

2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:38.560
 It's amazing. I was physically and mentally unhealthy, socially unhealthy as well,

2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:44.400
 because I put every waking minute into this thing, every ounce of me into it.

2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:50.800
 And when it was a spectacular disaster, we were making the iPhone 15 years too early,

2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:56.160
 the bottom fell out. I had nothing left. I had to get

2:36:56.160 --> 2:37:04.320
 it healthy, socially, emotionally, physically after that, that trauma. I let everything go.

2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:09.360
 I learned from that that you have to, even though you might put everything into your work,

2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:13.760
 you need to find balance outside of it. And now that doesn't mean you're always,

2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:18.960
 it's three days a week working and four days a week or whatever it was,

2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:23.200
 you're still working as hard as ever. But what you're doing is you're making sure

2:37:23.200 --> 2:37:28.000
 when you're thinking time is during work, that you're not ruminating at three in the morning.

2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:34.080
 You use the tools that you have to put those ideas into databases or on pages or somewhere else,

2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.760
 so you can go back and look at them. So you're not always having to remember,

2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:40.960
 because what happens is most people don't write this stuff down. So they just sit there and

2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:44.720
 got to remember this. I got to remember this. I got to remember this. If you just put it into

2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:49.040
 the tools and you can come back to it, you can come back fresh. A lot of the time is about

2:37:49.040 --> 2:37:53.840
 ruminating about what I need to get done and remembering everything instead of doing the work.

2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:59.600
 That's fascinating. So if you just put it down on paper, you can actually escape it.

2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:09.280
 Escape it for a time, to have peace for a time. You mentioned General Magic. Let me ask you

2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:21.200
 the Russian question. What's been the darkest moments of your life? Where are some of the darkest

2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:27.040
 places you've gone in your mind? If you're doing these kinds of things with startups,

2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.280
 you're going to have to face a crisis. If you're doing it right, you're going to face it.

2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:36.480
 So for you personally, where were some of the tougher moments in your life?

2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:45.120
 Growing up, I went to 12 schools in 15 years. I was always the new kid.

2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:51.280
 Put yourself in those shoes, right? You picked on. Well, you picked on.

2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:56.640
 Well, absolutely. But even more so, I was the geek with the computer. Remember the nerds in the

2:38:56.640 --> 2:39:02.640
 80s? You probably don't know this, but believe me, we were made fun of. What were these computers?

2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:07.280
 What were these things? You're off in a cold. They're all partying or going, whatever it was,

2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:13.120
 and I'm sitting there like, they're like, this guy is just this alien, right? Who's this new

2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:19.040
 guy who just showed up and then you would ask the smart questions and you couldn't be the smartest

2:39:20.080 --> 2:39:25.040
 because then you get picked on too. And you're the new kid. So you're in this environment that's

2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:30.720
 ever changing. You don't fit in and you are just asking questions because you think

2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:34.320
 they're the right ad questions to answer. But then they're like, you're making us look bad.

2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:36.480
 Don't ask these smart questions because you're going to make us do more work.

2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:42.320
 So right there, it's pretty tough and I'm moving cities, right? And I didn't have the

2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:47.520
 internet to stay connected to people. There was no internet. Phone calls were $2 a minute.

2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:49.120
 So it was lonely too.

2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:55.680
 It was lonely, right? I was a latchkey kid, right? I had my brother,

2:39:55.680 --> 2:40:01.200
 but he was a skateboarder and he had a different social way of working. He loved to

2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:03.440
 do that stuff and be outside. I loved the computer.

2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:06.320
 So even in the computer, you were alone in the family.

2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:08.880
 With the computer in the family, you were alone.

2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:15.120
 I was absolutely alone. That was just me. But then you could find the other geeks, right?

2:40:15.120 --> 2:40:19.440
 But there were just a few of us and we made this little thing. But then when you moved away,

2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:24.960
 you know, then I had to use a BBS, a bulletin board system and a dial up modem.

2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:30.400
 And then I started hacking the phone system to get free codes out, MCI and Sprint,

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:35.040
 back in the day, to get long distance, to get free codes to call my friends,

2:40:35.040 --> 2:40:39.200
 the geeks on the other side, right? Or to dial into a BBS cheaply.

2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:40.640
 That was in another part of the world.

2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:46.400
 So this was this subculture and that was not accepted in any way and not the heroes that

2:40:46.400 --> 2:40:51.200
 you see today that are on the, you know, on, you know, the richest people in the world and everything.

2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:56.560
 So that was the first set of trauma. And then the next one really was general magic,

2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:01.280
 you know, the end of that, like I described before, and pulling yourself out and going,

2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:07.040
 just because I got so insular in that world of geeking out and building stuff,

2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:12.880
 that I just tore all the social ties, right? Because it was just, it was a drug.

2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:16.880
 I was hooked on that. I was a junkie. I had to get, I had to get clean.

2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:23.680
 Yeah. And that made, that made you who you are.

2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:24.560
 Tempered, tempered.

2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:35.440
 So Steve Jobs is no longer with us. One day you also will no longer be with us.

2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:39.440
 That's the, the thing about this life it ends.

2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:44.800
 Yeah. So no matter how many incredible things you brought to this world,

2:41:44.800 --> 2:41:50.400
 no matter how many inventions you built, you too shall perish. Do you think about this?

2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:53.120
 Are you afraid of your death?

2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:07.440
 I am not afraid of my death. I am an atheist. And I think about the soul. Because I do,

2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:13.520
 even though I'm an atheist, I think about the soul. And the soul is the thing that you instill

2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:19.360
 in others when you go that lives on. It's not this thing that's magically in space.

2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:25.120
 It's the thing that you've imparted onto people that you worked with and those relationships

2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:33.120
 you've had. And that soul lives on in the stories that they tell, right? And through build, I'm hopeful

2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:37.920
 that those stories stay relevant because they're human nature. They're not about who knows what

2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:43.760
 the next iPhone thing is or the next iPod thing is. The stuff that I have been able,

2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:49.840
 the privilege to make and work with people, those are all ephemeral. The iPod's gone now, right?

2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:59.040
 This week it was announced iPod's dead after 21 years. It is that those human connections,

2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:03.760
 it's that growth that you've helped someone just like they helped me. Just like Bill Campbell

2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:08.400
 or Steve Jobs is gone, but they made me be better. That's the soul that I believe in.

2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:15.120
 That's fascinating that you say that, yeah, so many of these products, I mean, to push back a

2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:23.360
 little bit. So even though the iPod is an end of an era. Using it every day. I think that,

2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:32.160
 I mean, the number of people that impacted is just, so I suppose the soul is carried by the people.

2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:36.640
 Exactly. Sometimes the products you create is the sort of the transport mechanism.

2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:42.320
 It's the vessel. And they felt the love and they felt that love and it transformed them,

2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:46.640
 even if they don't have the vessel anymore. Yeah. And in that way, the soul lives on.

2:43:46.640 --> 2:43:51.360
 Just like the body is the vessel. That's beautifully put. Why do you think we're here?

2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:53.360
 What's the meaning of life, Tony?

2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:58.960
 Jesus. And death. We're going all around.

2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:00.000
 Meaning of life?

2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:03.200
 Why? Why? Because you said it's important to have a press release.

2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:11.840
 If humanity, if life on earth, if this thing, the consciousness, the

2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:19.920
 falling in love and building bridges and iPods and rockets and trying to extend out into the

2:44:19.920 --> 2:44:27.680
 cosmos, why? Why do you think we're doing it? Is there any meaning to it?

2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:37.840
 We are naturally curious. We are naturally curious individuals. And we are always looking for

2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:45.040
 meaning. We're always trying to ascribe meaning to something or understanding of something.

2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:51.760
 Right? And through that, it's just evolution and Darwinism. It's just that thing that's

2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:56.640
 baked into our being at the most fundamental level. Driven by curiosity.

2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:03.440
 And creating some pretty cool things along the way. Tony, and speaking of cool things,

2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:09.120
 you've created some of the coolest things ever. And on top of that, you're just an amazing human

2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:12.240
 being. It's a huge honor that you sit and talk to me today. This is fun.

2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:19.440
 This is great. I didn't know where I was going. And I'm looking for season 7, 8, 9.

2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:25.200
 I would love to hang out and have dinner and just wrap about all kinds of great things.

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:26.400
 I'd love to continue this.

2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:27.440
 I would too. Thank you so much.

2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:33.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tony Fidel. To support this podcast,

2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:38.880
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words

2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:44.720
 from Tony Fidel himself. The most wonderful part of building something together with a team

2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:50.000
 is that you're walking side by side with other people. You're all looking at your feet and

2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:55.360
 scanning the horizon at the same time. Some people will see things you can't. And you

2:45:55.360 --> 2:46:00.880
 will see things that are invisible to everyone else. So don't think doing the work just means

2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:07.200
 locking yourself into a room. A huge part of it is walking with your team. The work is reaching

2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:12.960
 your destination together or finding a new destination and bringing the team with you.

2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:36.960
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
