 The following is a conversation with Po Shen Lo, a professor of mathematics at Carnegie

00:05.020 --> 00:10.980
 Mellon University, national coach of the USA International Math Olympia team, and founder

00:10.980 --> 00:15.420
 of XP that does online education of basic math and science.

00:15.420 --> 00:20.220
 He's also the founder of Novid, an app that takes a really interesting approach to contact

00:20.220 --> 00:24.980
 tracing, making sure you stay completely anonymous, and it gives you statistical information about

00:24.980 --> 00:31.980
 COVID cases in your physical network of interactions. So you can maintain privacy, very important,

00:31.980 --> 00:36.980
 and make informed decisions. In my opinion, we desperately needed solutions like this

00:36.980 --> 00:44.860
 in early 2020. And unfortunately, I think we will again need it for the next pandemic.

00:44.860 --> 00:49.900
 To me, solutions that require large scale, distributed coordination of human beings need

00:49.900 --> 00:53.660
 ideas that emphasize freedom and knowledge.

00:53.660 --> 01:01.420
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Jordan Harbinger Show, Onit, BetterHelp, Aidsleep, and Element.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.820
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

01:03.820 --> 01:09.500
 As a side note, let me say that Po and I filmed a few short videos about simple, beautiful

01:09.500 --> 01:15.220
 math concepts that I will release soon. It was really fun. I really enjoyed Po sharing

01:15.220 --> 01:20.100
 his passion for math with me in those videos. I'm hoping to do a few more short videos in

01:20.100 --> 01:26.820
 the coming months that are educational in nature on AI, robotics, math, science, philosophy,

01:26.820 --> 01:33.340
 or if all else fails, just fun snippets into my life on music, books, martial arts, and

01:33.340 --> 01:39.380
 other random things, if that's of interest to anyone at all. This is the Lex Friedman

01:39.380 --> 01:44.180
 podcast, and here's my conversation with Po Shen Lo.

01:44.180 --> 01:48.220
 You mentioned you really enjoy flying and experiencing different people in different

01:48.220 --> 01:53.140
 places. There's something about flying for me. I don't know if you have the same experience

01:53.140 --> 01:58.540
 that every time I get on an airplane, it's incredible to me that human beings have actually

01:58.540 --> 02:04.660
 been able to achieve this. When I look at what's happening now with humans traveling

02:04.660 --> 02:10.140
 out into space, I see it as all the same thing. It's incredible that humans are able to get

02:10.140 --> 02:20.300
 into a box and fly in the air and safely and land. Everybody's taking it for granted.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.420
 When I observe them, it's quite fascinating because I see that cleanly mapping to the

02:25.420 --> 02:33.820
 world where we're now in rockets and traveling to the moon, traveling to Mars. At the same

02:33.820 --> 02:41.100
 kind of way, I can already see the future where we will all take it for granted. I don't know

02:41.100 --> 02:47.340
 if you personally, when you fly, have the same kind of magical experience of how the

02:47.340 --> 02:52.700
 heck that humans actually accomplish this. I do, especially when there's turbulence,

02:52.700 --> 02:58.900
 which is on the way here. There was turbulence, and the plane jiggled, even the flight attendant

02:58.900 --> 03:02.580
 had to hold on to the side. I was just thinking to myself, it's amazing that this happens

03:02.580 --> 03:06.860
 all the time and the wings don't fall off. Given how many planes are flying, but then

03:06.860 --> 03:12.140
 I often think about it, and I'm like, a long time ago, I think people didn't trust elevators

03:12.140 --> 03:17.140
 in a 40 story building in New York City. Now we just take it completely for granted that

03:17.140 --> 03:23.940
 you can step into this shaft, which is 40 floors up and down, and it will just not fail.

03:23.940 --> 03:29.420
 Again, I'm the same way with elevators, but also buildings. When I'll stand on the 40th

03:29.420 --> 03:37.700
 floor and wonder, how the heck are we not falling right now? How amazing it is with

03:37.700 --> 03:44.820
 the high winds, structurally, just the earthquakes and the natural vibrations in the ground.

03:44.820 --> 03:50.820
 How are all of these, you go to New York City, all of these buildings standing? To me, one

03:50.820 --> 03:55.780
 of the most beautiful things, actually mathematically too, is bridges. I used to build bridges in

03:55.780 --> 04:04.340
 high school from toothpicks, just out of the pure joy of physics making some structure

04:04.340 --> 04:11.220
 really strong. Understanding from a civil engineering perspective, what kind of structure

04:11.220 --> 04:15.660
 will be stronger than another kind of structure, like suspension bridges. Then you see that

04:15.660 --> 04:25.420
 at scale, humans being able to span a body of water with a giant bridge. I don't know.

04:25.420 --> 04:32.860
 It's so humbling. It makes you realize how dependent we are on each other. I talk about

04:32.860 --> 04:38.740
 love a lot, but there's a certain element in which we little ants have just a small

04:38.740 --> 04:45.380
 amount of knowledge about our particular thing. Then we're depending on a network of knowledge

04:45.380 --> 04:51.260
 that other experts hold. Then most of our lives, most of the quality of life we have,

04:51.260 --> 04:59.420
 has to do with the richness of that network, of knowledge, of that collaboration, and then

04:59.420 --> 05:05.900
 the ability to build on top of it levels of abstractions. You start from bits in a computer,

05:05.900 --> 05:10.180
 then you can have assembly, then you can have C++. You have an operating system, then you

05:10.180 --> 05:14.820
 can have C++ and Python, finally some machine learning on top, all of these are abstractions.

05:14.820 --> 05:18.100
 Eventually, we have AI that runs all of us humans.

05:18.100 --> 05:24.060
 But speaking of abstractions and programming, in high school, you wrote some impressive

05:24.060 --> 05:29.780
 games for Emma Stoss. I got a chest to, in browsers somehow, it's magic. I got a chest

05:29.780 --> 05:36.300
 to play them. Alien Attack 1, 2, 3, and 4. What's the hardest part about programming

05:36.300 --> 05:41.060
 those games? Maybe can you tell the story about building those games?

05:41.060 --> 05:46.340
 Sure. I actually tried to do those in high school because I was just curious if I could.

05:46.340 --> 05:49.300
 That's a good starting point for anything.

05:49.300 --> 05:53.500
 Yeah, it's like, could you? But the appealing thing was also, it was a soup to nuts kind

05:53.500 --> 05:58.940
 of thing. So something that has always attracted me is I like beautiful ideas. I like seeing

05:58.940 --> 06:04.260
 beautiful ideas. But I actually also like seeing execution of an idea all the way from

06:04.260 --> 06:08.420
 beginning to end in something that works. So for example, in high school, I was lucky

06:08.420 --> 06:14.780
 enough to grow up in the late 90s when even a high school student could hope to make something

06:14.780 --> 06:19.420
 sort of comparable to the shareware games that were out there. I think the word sort

06:19.420 --> 06:25.300
 of, like still quite far away, but at least I didn't need to hire a 3D CG artist. There

06:25.300 --> 06:30.420
 weren't enough pixels to draw anyway, even I can draw, right? Bad art, of course. But

06:30.420 --> 06:35.340
 the point is I wanted to know, is it possible for me to try to do those things where back

06:35.340 --> 06:40.940
 in those days, you didn't even have an easy way to draw letters on the screen in a particular

06:40.940 --> 06:45.220
 font. You couldn't just say import a font. It wasn't like Python. So for example, back

06:45.220 --> 06:52.100
 then if you play those games in the web browser, which is emulating the old school computer,

06:52.100 --> 06:56.300
 those, even the letters you see, those are made by individual calls to draw pixels on

06:56.300 --> 07:00.180
 the screen. So you built that from scratch, almost building a computer graphics library

07:00.180 --> 07:04.820
 from scratch? Yes. The primitive that I got to use was some code I copied off of a book

07:04.820 --> 07:10.020
 in assembly of how to put a pixel on a screen in a particular color. And the programming

07:10.020 --> 07:16.140
 language was Pascal. Ah, yeah. The first one was in Pascal. But then the other ones were

07:16.140 --> 07:20.740
 in C++ after that. How's the emulation and the browser work, by the way? Is that, is

07:20.740 --> 07:24.660
 that trivial? Because it's pretty cool. You get to play these games that have a very much

07:24.660 --> 07:30.060
 90s feeling to them. Ah, so it's literally making an MS DOS environment, which is literally

07:30.060 --> 07:35.740
 running the old.exe file. Wow. I didn't have to do it. I didn't have to do it. That could

07:35.740 --> 07:40.620
 be more amazing than the airplane. So it wasn't so much about the video games. It was more

07:40.620 --> 07:47.820
 about, can you build something really cool from scratch? Yes. And you did a bunch of

07:47.820 --> 07:55.660
 programming competitions. What was your interest, your love for programming? What did you learn

07:55.660 --> 08:01.140
 through that experience, especially now that as much of your work has taken a long journey

08:01.140 --> 08:08.500
 through mathematics? I think I always was amazed by how computers could do things fast.

08:08.500 --> 08:14.060
 If I wanted to make it an abstract analysis of why it is that I saw some power in the

08:14.060 --> 08:18.420
 computer. Because if the computer can do things so many times faster than humans, where the

08:18.420 --> 08:23.780
 hard part is telling the computer what to do and how to do it, if you can master that

08:23.780 --> 08:28.420
 asking the computer what to do, then you could conceivably achieve more things. And those

08:28.420 --> 08:34.060
 contests I was in, those were the opposite in some sense of making a complete product

08:34.060 --> 08:39.020
 like a game is a product. Those contests were effectively write a function to do something

08:39.020 --> 08:43.700
 extremely efficiently. And if you are able to do that, then you can unlock more of the

08:43.700 --> 08:49.540
 power of the computer. But also doing it quickly. There's a time element from the human perspective

08:49.540 --> 08:56.780
 to be able to program quickly. There's something nice. So there's almost like an athletics

08:56.780 --> 09:03.820
 component to where you're almost like an athlete seeking optimal performance as a human being

09:03.820 --> 09:09.140
 trying to write these programs. And at the same time, it's kind of art because the best

09:09.140 --> 09:14.100
 way to write a program quickly is to write a simple program. You have to have a damn

09:14.100 --> 09:19.020
 good solution. So it's not necessary you have to type fast. You have to think through a really

09:19.020 --> 09:27.340
 clean, beautiful solution. I mean, what do you think is the use of those programming

09:27.340 --> 09:30.540
 competitions? Do you think they're ultimately something you would recommend for students

09:30.540 --> 09:33.980
 for people interested in programming or people interested in building stuff?

09:33.980 --> 09:38.740
 Yes, I think so because especially with the work that I've been doing nowadays, even trying

09:38.740 --> 09:44.180
 to control COVID, something that was very helpful from day one was understanding that

09:44.180 --> 09:49.460
 kinds of computations we would want to do, we could conceivably do on like a four core

09:49.460 --> 09:54.860
 cloud machine on Amazon Web Services out to a population which might have hundreds of

09:54.860 --> 09:58.780
 thousands or millions of people. The reason why that was important to have that back of

09:58.780 --> 10:05.220
 the envelope calculation with efficient algorithms is because if we couldn't do that, then we

10:05.220 --> 10:08.780
 would bankrupt ourselves before we could get to a big enough scale. If you think about

10:08.780 --> 10:13.780
 how you grow anything from small to big, if in order to grow it from small to big, you

10:13.780 --> 10:18.420
 also already need 10,000 cloud servers, you'll never get to big.

10:18.420 --> 10:26.580
 Also, the nice thing about programming competitions is that you actually build a thing that works,

10:26.580 --> 10:31.860
 so you finish it. There's a completion thing and you realize, I think there's a magic

10:31.860 --> 10:38.220
 to it where you realize that it's not so hard to build something that works, to have a system

10:38.220 --> 10:43.700
 that successfully takes in inputs and produces outputs and solves a difficult problem. That

10:43.700 --> 10:50.100
 directly transfers to building a startup essentially that can help some aspect of this world as

10:50.100 --> 10:55.380
 long as it's mostly based on software engineering. Things get really tricky when you have to

10:55.380 --> 11:01.660
 manufacture stuff. That's why people like Elon Musk are so impressive that it's not

11:01.660 --> 11:07.700
 just software. Tesla autopilot is not just software. It's like you have factories that

11:07.700 --> 11:14.980
 build cars and there's a million components involved in the machinery required to assemble

11:14.980 --> 11:21.580
 those cars and so on. But in software, one person can change the world, which is incredible.

11:21.580 --> 11:27.660
 But on the mathematics side, if you look back or maybe today, what made you fall in love

11:27.660 --> 11:29.740
 with mathematics?

11:29.740 --> 11:36.140
 For me, I think I've always been very attracted to challenge, as I already indicated with

11:36.140 --> 11:44.500
 writing the program. I guess if I see something that's hard or supposed to be impossible,

11:44.500 --> 11:48.820
 sometimes I say, maybe I want to see if I can pull that off. And with the mathematics,

11:48.820 --> 11:55.180
 the math competitions presented problems that were hard that I didn't know how to start,

11:55.180 --> 11:59.740
 but for which I could conceivably try to learn how to solve them. I mean, there are other

11:59.740 --> 12:05.540
 things that are hard called get something to Mars, get people to Mars. I still don't

12:05.540 --> 12:09.780
 think that I'm able to solve that problem. On the other hand, the math problems struck

12:09.780 --> 12:14.900
 me as things which are hard and with significant amount of extra work, I could figure it out.

12:14.900 --> 12:19.380
 And maybe they would actually even be useful. That mathematical skill is the core of lots

12:19.380 --> 12:22.820
 of other things.

12:22.820 --> 12:26.940
 That's really interesting. Maybe you could speak to that because a lot of people say

12:26.940 --> 12:35.300
 that math is hard as a kind of negative statement. It always seemed to me a little bit like that's

12:35.300 --> 12:41.420
 kind of a positive statement, that all things that are worth having in this world are hard.

12:41.420 --> 12:46.820
 I mean, everything that people think about that they would love to do, whether it's

12:46.820 --> 12:54.180
 sports, whether it's art, music, and all the sciences, they're going to be hard if you

12:54.180 --> 12:59.140
 want to do something special. So is there something you could say to that idea that

12:59.140 --> 13:04.860
 math is hard? Should it be made easy or should it be hard?

13:04.860 --> 13:10.700
 So I think maybe I want to dig a little bit onto this hard part and say, I think the interesting

13:10.700 --> 13:17.020
 thing about the math is that you can see a question that you didn't know how to start

13:17.020 --> 13:23.940
 doing it before. And over a course of thinking about it, you can come up with a way to solve

13:23.940 --> 13:28.900
 it. And so you can move from a state of not being able to do something to a state of being

13:28.900 --> 13:34.100
 able to do something, where you help to take yourself through that instead of somebody

13:34.100 --> 13:39.980
 else spoon feeding you that technique. So actually here I'm already digging into maybe

13:39.980 --> 13:45.820
 part of my teaching philosophy also, which is that I actually don't want to ever just

13:45.820 --> 13:50.820
 tell somebody, here's how you do something. I actually prefer to say, here's an interesting

13:50.820 --> 13:57.940
 question. I know you don't quite know how to do it. Do you have any ideas? I'm actually

13:57.940 --> 14:02.020
 explaining another way that you could try to do teaching. And I'm contrasting this to

14:02.020 --> 14:07.860
 a method of watch me do this, now practice it 20 times. I'm trying to say a lot of people

14:07.860 --> 14:11.940
 consider math to be hard because maybe they can't remember all of the methods that were

14:11.940 --> 14:17.540
 taught. But for me, I look at the hardness and I don't think of it as a memory hardness.

14:17.540 --> 14:23.300
 I think of it as a, can you invent something hardness? And I think that if we can teach

14:23.300 --> 14:29.820
 more people how to do that art of invention in a pure cognitive way, not as hard as the

14:29.820 --> 14:33.180
 actual hardware stuff, right? But like in terms of the concepts and the thoughts and

14:33.180 --> 14:38.340
 the mathematics, teaching people how to invent, then suddenly actually they might not even

14:38.340 --> 14:46.340
 find math to be that tiresomeness hard anymore, but that rewardingness hard of I have the

14:46.340 --> 14:50.580
 capability of looking at something which I don't know what to do and coming up with

14:50.580 --> 14:55.140
 how to do it. I actually think we should be doing that, giving people that capability.

14:55.140 --> 15:00.900
 So hard in the same way that invention is hard that is ultimately rewarding. So maybe

15:00.900 --> 15:11.180
 you can dig in that a little bit longer, which is do you see basically the way to teach math

15:11.180 --> 15:18.420
 is to present the problem and to give a person a chance to try to invent a solution without

15:18.420 --> 15:23.620
 with minimal amount of information first is that is that basically how do you build that

15:23.620 --> 15:29.500
 muscle of invention in a student? Yes. So the way that I guess I have two different

15:29.500 --> 15:33.140
 sort of ways that I try to teach actually one of them is in fact this semester because

15:33.140 --> 15:37.140
 all my classes were remotely delivered. I even threw them all onto my YouTube channel

15:37.140 --> 15:42.420
 so you can see how I teach at Carnegie Mellon. But I'd often say, Hey, everyone, let's try

15:42.420 --> 15:49.020
 to do this. Any ideas? And that actually changes my role as a professor from a person who shows

15:49.020 --> 15:54.020
 up for class with a script of what I want to talk through. I actually I don't have a script.

15:54.020 --> 15:58.300
 The way I show up for classes, there's something that we want to learn how to do. And we're

15:58.300 --> 16:02.980
 going to do it by improv. I'm talking about the same method as improv comedy, which is

16:02.980 --> 16:10.500
 where you tell me some ideas and I'll try to yes and them. And then together, we're

16:10.500 --> 16:15.540
 going to come up with a proof of this concept where you were deeply involved in creating

16:15.540 --> 16:19.740
 the proof. Actually, every time I teach the class, we do every proof slightly differently

16:19.740 --> 16:24.940
 because it's based on how the students came up with it. And that's how I do it when I'm

16:24.940 --> 16:29.340
 in person. I also have another line of courses that we make that is delivered online. Those

16:29.340 --> 16:34.780
 things are where I can't do it live. But the teaching method became also similar. It was

16:34.780 --> 16:38.900
 just here's an interesting question. I know it's out of reach. Why don't you think about

16:38.900 --> 16:44.740
 it? And then automatic hints, we feed automatically hints through the internet to go and let the

16:44.740 --> 16:52.660
 person try to invent. So that's like a more rigorous prodding of invention. But you did

16:52.660 --> 16:59.260
 mention disease and COVID and you've been doing some very interesting stuff from a mathematical

16:59.260 --> 17:06.460
 but also software engineering angle of coming up with ideas. It's back to the I can I see

17:06.460 --> 17:13.020
 a problem. I think I can help. So you stepped into this world. Can you tell me about your

17:13.020 --> 17:20.580
 work there under the flag of Novid and both the software and the technical details of

17:20.580 --> 17:25.060
 how the thing works? Sure, sure. So first I want to make sure that I say this is actually

17:25.060 --> 17:29.220
 team effort. I happen to be the one speaking, but there's no way this would exist without

17:29.220 --> 17:33.540
 an incredible team of people who inspire me every day to work on this. But I'll speak

17:33.540 --> 17:41.380
 on behalf of them. So the idea was indeed that we stepped forward in March of last year

17:41.380 --> 17:45.140
 when the world started to become our part of the world started to become our part,

17:45.140 --> 17:49.700
 meaning the United States started to become paralyzed by COVID. This shutdown started

17:49.700 --> 17:57.260
 to happen. And at that time, it started as a figment of an idea, which was network theory,

17:57.260 --> 18:02.420
 which is the area of math that I work in, could potentially be combined with smartphones

18:02.420 --> 18:08.220
 and some kind of health information anonymized. Exactly how we didn't know yet. We tried

18:08.220 --> 18:14.500
 to crystallize it. And many months into this work, we ended up accidentally discovering

18:14.500 --> 18:20.780
 a new way to control diseases, which is now what is the main impetus of all of this work

18:20.780 --> 18:26.580
 is to take this idea and polish it and hopefully have it be useful not only now, but for future

18:26.580 --> 18:31.180
 pandemics. The idea is really simple to describe. Actually, my main thing in the world is I

18:31.180 --> 18:37.060
 come up with obvious observations. I'll explain it now. Einstein did the same thing. And he

18:37.060 --> 18:45.100
 wrote a few short papers. But so the idea is like this. If we describe how usually people

18:45.100 --> 18:51.180
 control disease for a lot of history, it was that you would find out who was sick, you'd

18:51.180 --> 18:56.100
 find out who they have been around, and you try to remove all of those people from society

18:56.100 --> 19:01.860
 against their will. Yes. Now that's the problem. The against their will part gives you the

19:01.860 --> 19:05.980
 wrong kind of a feedback loop, which makes it hard to control the disease, because then

19:05.980 --> 19:09.500
 the people you're trying to control keep getting other people sick. You can see already how

19:09.500 --> 19:13.220
 I'm thinking and talking about this feedback loops. This is actually related to something

19:13.220 --> 19:18.900
 you said earlier about even like how skyscrapers stay in the air. The whole point is control

19:18.900 --> 19:24.140
 theory. You actually want to, or even how an airplane stays, you need to have control

19:24.140 --> 19:29.020
 loops which are feedbacking in the right way. And what we observed was that the feedback

19:29.020 --> 19:33.660
 control loop for controlling disease by asking people to be removed from society against

19:33.660 --> 19:38.220
 their will was not working. It was running against human incentives, and you suddenly

19:38.220 --> 19:43.060
 are trying to control seven billion, eight billion people in ways that they don't individually

19:43.060 --> 19:48.660
 want to necessarily do. So here's the idea. And this is inspired by the fact that at the

19:48.660 --> 19:53.120
 core of our team were user experience designers. That's actually the, in fact, the first thing

19:53.120 --> 19:58.340
 I knew we needed when we started was to bring user experience at the core. Okay. But so

19:58.340 --> 20:05.620
 the idea was, suppose there was a pent, suppose hypothetically there was a pandemic. What

20:05.620 --> 20:11.940
 would you want? You would want a way to be able to live your life as much as possible

20:11.940 --> 20:17.860
 and avoid getting sick. Can we make an app to help you avoid getting sick? Notice how

20:17.860 --> 20:23.580
 I've just articulated the problem. It is not, can we make an app so that after you are around

20:23.580 --> 20:29.220
 somebody who's sick, you can be removed from society? It's can we make an app so that you

20:29.220 --> 20:34.700
 can avoid getting sick? That would run a positive feed. I don't know if I want to call it positive

20:34.700 --> 20:38.940
 or negative, but it would run a good feedback loop. Okay. So then how would you do this?

20:38.940 --> 20:44.300
 The only problem is that you don't know who's sick because especially with this disease,

20:44.300 --> 20:48.860
 if I see somebody who looks perfectly healthy, the disease spreads two days before you have

20:48.860 --> 20:54.860
 any symptoms. And so it's actually not possible. That's where the network theory comes in.

20:54.860 --> 21:00.860
 You caught it from someone. What if we changed the paradigm and we said, whenever there's

21:00.860 --> 21:08.100
 a sickness, tell everybody how many physical relationships separate them from the sickness.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.340
 That is the trivial idea we added. The trivial idea was the distance between you and a disease

21:13.340 --> 21:21.140
 is not measured in feet or seconds. It's measured in terms of how many close physical relationships

21:21.140 --> 21:26.980
 separate you like these six degrees of separation like LinkedIn. Simple idea. What if we told

21:26.980 --> 21:33.180
 everyone that it turns out that actually unlocks some interesting behavioral feedback loops,

21:33.180 --> 21:38.100
 which for example, let me let me now jump to a non COVID example to show why this maybe

21:38.100 --> 21:42.380
 could be useful. Actually, we think it could be quite useful. Imagine there was Ebola or

21:42.380 --> 21:49.340
 some hemorrhagic fever. Imagine it spread through contact through the air. In fact, pretend,

21:49.340 --> 21:56.980
 pretend. That's a disastrous disease. It has high fatality rate. And as you die, you're

21:56.980 --> 22:05.260
 bleeding out of every orifice. Okay, so not pleasant. So the question is, suppose that

22:05.260 --> 22:11.540
 such a disease broke, who would want to install an app that would tell them how many relationships

22:11.540 --> 22:19.780
 away from them this disease had struck like a lot of people. In fact, almost. I don't

22:19.780 --> 22:22.500
 want to say almost everyone. That's a very strong statement, but a very large number

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
 of people.

22:23.500 --> 22:29.500
 That's fascinating framing like the more deadly and transmissible the disease, the stronger

22:29.500 --> 22:36.540
 the incentive to install it in a positive sense, the in the good feedback loop sense.

22:36.540 --> 22:40.620
 That's a really good example. It's a really good way to frame it because with COVID, it

22:40.620 --> 22:47.220
 was not as deadly as potential pandemics could have been, viruses could have been. So it's

22:47.220 --> 22:51.140
 sometimes muddled with how we think about it. But yeah, this is really good framing.

22:51.140 --> 22:56.220
 If the virus was a lot more deadly, you want to create a system that has a set of incentives

22:56.220 --> 23:02.620
 that it quickly spreads to the population where everybody is using it and it's contributing

23:02.620 --> 23:04.300
 in a positive way to the system.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.580
 Exactly. And actually, that point you just made, I don't take credit for that observation.

23:07.580 --> 23:12.220
 There was another person I talked to who pointed out that it's very interesting that this feedback

23:12.220 --> 23:19.300
 loop is even more effective when the disease is worse. And that's actually not a bad characteristic

23:19.300 --> 23:23.940
 to have in your feedback loop if you're trying to help civilization keep running.

23:23.940 --> 23:30.300
 Yeah. It's a really, it's in this dynamic. Like people figure out, they dynamically figure

23:30.300 --> 23:36.020
 out how bad the disease is. The more it spreads and the deadlier it is as the people observe

23:36.020 --> 23:42.420
 it, as long as the spread of information, like semantic information, natural language

23:42.420 --> 23:47.460
 information is closely aligned with the reality of the disease, which is a whole nother conversation,

23:47.460 --> 23:52.860
 right? We, that's, we might, maybe we'll chat about that, how we sort of make sure there's

23:52.860 --> 23:57.220
 not misinformation, whether there's accurate information, but that aside, okay, so this

23:57.220 --> 23:58.860
 is a really nice property.

23:58.860 --> 24:02.660
 Right. And just going on on that, actually just talking more about what that could do

24:02.660 --> 24:08.860
 and why we're so excited about it. It's that not only would people want to install it,

24:08.860 --> 24:13.540
 what would they do? If you start to see that this disease is getting closer and closer,

24:13.540 --> 24:18.620
 we surveyed informally people, but they said, as we saw it getting closer, we would hide.

24:18.620 --> 24:24.140
 We would try to not have contacts. But now you notice what this has just achieved. The

24:24.140 --> 24:29.820
 whole goal on, on, on this whole exercise was you got the people who might be sick and

24:29.820 --> 24:33.740
 you got everyone else. Set A and set B. Set A is the people who might be sick. Set B is

24:33.740 --> 24:40.060
 everyone else. And for the entirety of the past contact tracing approaches, you tried

24:40.060 --> 24:45.420
 to get set A to do things that might not be to their liking or their will, because that's

24:45.420 --> 24:47.820
 removing them from society.

24:47.820 --> 24:52.420
 We found out that there's two ways to separate set A from set B. You can also let the people

24:52.420 --> 24:58.780
 at set B at the fringe of set A attempt to remove themselves from this interface. It's

24:58.780 --> 25:04.700
 just, it's the symmetry of A and B separation. Everyone was looking at A. We look at B and

25:04.700 --> 25:07.380
 suddenly B is in their incentive to do so.

25:07.380 --> 25:14.180
 Beautiful. So there's a virus that jumps from human to human. So there's a network sometimes

25:14.180 --> 25:22.060
 called graph of the spread of a virus that hops from person to person to person to person.

25:22.060 --> 25:28.860
 And each one of us individuals are sitting or plop, plopped into that network. We have

25:28.860 --> 25:33.180
 close friends and relations and so on. It's kind of fascinating to actually think about

25:33.180 --> 25:36.580
 this network and we can maybe talk about the shapes of this kind of network.

25:36.580 --> 25:41.980
 Because I was, I was trying to think exactly this, like how many people do I, so I'm kind

25:41.980 --> 25:47.180
 of an introvert, not kind of, I'm very much an introvert. But so can I be explicit about

25:47.180 --> 25:52.260
 the kind of people I meet in regular life? Say when it was completely opened up, there's

25:52.260 --> 26:01.100
 no pandemic. There is a kind of network of, and there's maybe in the graph theoretic sense,

26:01.100 --> 26:07.420
 there's some weights or something about how close that relationship is in terms of the

26:07.420 --> 26:11.860
 frequency of visits, the duration of visits and all of those kinds of things. So you're

26:11.860 --> 26:20.780
 saying we might want to be, to create on top of that network a spread of information to

26:20.780 --> 26:26.460
 let you know as the virus travels through this network, how close is it getting to you?

26:26.460 --> 26:31.500
 And the number of hops away it is on that network is really powerful information that

26:31.500 --> 26:40.220
 creates a positive feedback loop where you can act essentially anonymously and on your

26:40.220 --> 26:46.820
 own. Like nobody's telling you what to do, which is really important is decentralized

26:46.820 --> 26:53.700
 and, and not the, whatever the opposite of authoritarian is, but you get to sort of the

26:53.700 --> 26:58.540
 American way, you get to choose to do it yourself, you have the freedom to do it yourself and

26:58.540 --> 27:04.420
 you incentivize to do it, and you're most likely going to do it to, to, to protect yourself

27:04.420 --> 27:10.980
 against you getting the disease as the, the closer it gets to you based on the information

27:10.980 --> 27:18.980
 that you have. But can you maybe elaborate? First of all, brilliant. Whenever I saw the

27:18.980 --> 27:25.340
 thing you're working on, so forget for COVID, this is of course really relevant for COVID,

27:25.340 --> 27:29.580
 but it's also probably relevant for future disease as well. So this, that was the thing

27:29.580 --> 27:34.900
 I'm nervous about is like, if this whole, if our society shut down because of COVID,

27:34.900 --> 27:40.860
 like what the heck is going to happen when there's a much deadlier disease? Like this,

27:40.860 --> 27:48.700
 this was the whole time 2020, the whole time I'm just sitting like this, like, is the incompetence

27:48.700 --> 27:54.300
 of everybody except the people developing vaccines. The biologists are the only ones

27:54.300 --> 27:58.700
 that got their stuff together. But in terms of institutions and all that kind of stuff,

27:58.700 --> 28:03.900
 it's just been, it's just been terrible. But this is exactly the power of information

28:03.900 --> 28:09.500
 and the power of information that doesn't limit personal freedom. So your idea is brilliant.

28:09.500 --> 28:14.780
 Okay. Mathematically, can you maybe elaborate? What are we talking about? Like how do you

28:14.780 --> 28:19.380
 actually make that work? What's involved? Sure. First, I'm going to reply to something

28:19.380 --> 28:25.740
 you said about the freedom inside this, because actually that was the idea. The idea is this

28:25.740 --> 28:32.920
 is game theory, right? And effectively, what we did is analogous to free market economy

28:32.920 --> 28:38.220
 as opposed to central planning. If you just line up the set of incentives correctly so

28:38.220 --> 28:45.460
 that people have, in their purely selfish behavior, are contributing to the optimization

28:45.460 --> 28:50.340
 of the global function. That's it. And the point of what we do, I guess, in mathematics

28:50.340 --> 28:54.620
 is we try to explore the search space to go and find out as many possibilities as there

28:54.620 --> 29:00.280
 are. And in this case, it's an applied search space. That's why the inputs from design,

29:00.280 --> 29:05.060
 user experience design and actual people are important. But you asked about, I guess,

29:05.060 --> 29:09.740
 the mathematical or the technical things underpinning it. So I think the first thing I'll say is

29:09.740 --> 29:15.860
 we wanted to make this thing not require your personal information. And so in order to do

29:15.860 --> 29:20.740
 that, what gave me the confidence to, I guess, lead our team to run at the beginning is we

29:20.740 --> 29:26.460
 saw that this could be done without using GPS information. So technically, what's going

29:26.460 --> 29:31.540
 on is if two smartphones, it's a smartphone app, if two smartphones have this thing installed,

29:31.540 --> 29:38.620
 they just communicate with each other by Bluetooth to go and find out how far they can detect

29:38.620 --> 29:42.980
 nearby things by Bluetooth. And then they can find out that these two phones were approximately

29:42.980 --> 29:47.940
 such and such distance apart. And that kind of relative proximity information is enough

29:47.940 --> 29:53.060
 to construct this big network. Okay, so the physical network is constructed

29:53.060 --> 29:59.380
 based on proximity that's through Bluetooth, and you don't have to specify your exact location.

29:59.380 --> 30:04.300
 It's the proximity. I'm not using the Pythagorean theorem, basically. I mean, if I just knew

30:04.300 --> 30:08.140
 the GPS coordinates, we could use the Pythagorean theorem too. Sorry, that's just how I call

30:08.140 --> 30:15.060
 it. Distance formula, whatever you want to call it. Yeah, so we're not doing the old

30:15.060 --> 30:28.500
 Pythagorean based violation of privacy. Okay. So is that enough to give you enough information

30:28.500 --> 30:37.540
 about physical connection to another human being? Is there a time element there? So okay,

30:37.540 --> 30:42.940
 that sounds like a really strong low hanging fruit. If you have that, you could probably

30:42.940 --> 30:48.900
 go really, really far. My natural question is, is there extra information you can add

30:48.900 --> 30:55.220
 on top of that, like the duration of the physical proximity? So first of all, we actually do

30:55.220 --> 31:00.340
 estimate the duration, but the way we estimate the duration is like how a movie is filmed

31:00.340 --> 31:05.420
 in the sense that every so often, every few minutes, we check what's nearby. It's like

31:05.420 --> 31:10.620
 how a movie is filmed. You take lots of snapshots. Yes. So there's no way in a battery efficient

31:10.620 --> 31:17.180
 way to really keep track of that proximity. However, fortunately, we're using probability.

31:17.180 --> 31:22.620
 The fact is, the paradigm that we're using is it's not super important if you run into

31:22.620 --> 31:27.060
 that person only for 10 minutes at the grocery store. If that's a stranger that you run into

31:27.060 --> 31:31.060
 10 minutes in this grocery store, that's not going to be relevant for our paradigm because

31:31.060 --> 31:36.380
 our paradigm is not telling you who were you around before and might therefore have gotten

31:36.380 --> 31:42.860
 infected by already. Ours is about predicting the future. The standard paradigm was what

31:42.860 --> 31:47.260
 already happened, quick damage control. Ours is predict the future. If you run into that

31:47.260 --> 31:51.060
 person once in the grocery store today and never see them again, it's irrelevant for

31:51.060 --> 31:56.500
 predicting the future. And therefore, for ours, what really matters is the many hours

31:56.500 --> 32:00.780
 around the other person, at which point if you're scanning every five to eight minutes.

32:00.780 --> 32:03.780
 That's going to come out in the product, like statistically speaking, it's going to come

32:03.780 --> 32:08.700
 out as a strong relationship, and a person in the grocery store is going to wash out

32:08.700 --> 32:15.020
 as not an important physical relationship. I mean, this is brilliant. How difficult is

32:15.020 --> 32:19.620
 it to make work? So you said, one, there's a mathematical component that we just kind

32:19.620 --> 32:25.140
 of talked about, and then there's the user experience component. So how difficult does

32:25.140 --> 32:33.900
 it go just like you built the video game alien attack from zero to completion? What's involved?

32:33.900 --> 32:39.460
 How difficult is it? So I'm going to answer that question in terms of building the product,

32:39.460 --> 32:44.660
 but then I'm also going to acknowledge that just having an app doesn't make it useful

32:44.660 --> 32:49.700
 because that's actually maybe the easy part. If you know what I mean, there's like all

32:49.700 --> 32:53.860
 of this stuff about rollout adoption and awareness, but let's focus on the app part first. So

32:53.860 --> 33:00.140
 that's again why I said the team is incredible. So we have a bunch of people who, let's just

33:00.140 --> 33:05.060
 say that the technology that we use to make it is not the standard way you make an app.

33:05.060 --> 33:11.420
 If you think about a standard iOS app or Android app, those are a user interface that contacts

33:11.420 --> 33:15.060
 a web server and sends some information back and forth. We're doing some stuff that has

33:15.060 --> 33:19.580
 to hook into the operating system of saying, let's go use Bluetooth for something it wasn't

33:19.580 --> 33:25.060
 really meant for. Right? So there's that part. And by the way, what is the app called? Oh,

33:25.060 --> 33:31.500
 it's called it Novid. COVID with an N. Very nice. So you have to hook into Bluetooth.

33:31.500 --> 33:38.060
 You're saying you have to do that beyond the permissions that are like at the very surface

33:38.060 --> 33:42.820
 level provided on the phone? Well, I don't want to call them permissions. I just want

33:42.820 --> 33:47.740
 to say that's not what you usually do with Bluetooth. Usually with Bluetooth, you say,

33:47.740 --> 33:52.100
 do I have headphones nearby? Yes. Okay, I'm done. You don't go and say, do I have headphones

33:52.100 --> 33:56.180
 nearby? Or do I have another phone nearby, which is doing something? And then keep asking

33:56.180 --> 34:01.140
 that same question. Keep asking the question. Right? So it's actually not easy. And I mean,

34:01.140 --> 34:06.100
 there were some parts of it, which actually a lot of people had tried unsuccessfully.

34:06.100 --> 34:11.860
 Actually it's known that, for example, the UK was trying to do something similar. And

34:11.860 --> 34:18.940
 the problem they ran into was when you program things on iOS, iOS is very good at making it

34:18.940 --> 34:23.860
 hard to do things in the background. And so there was quite a lot of effort required to

34:23.860 --> 34:28.140
 go and make this thing work. So the whole point, this thing would run in the background

34:28.140 --> 34:34.980
 and iOS, I mean, most Android probably as well, right? But yeah, iOS certainly makes

34:34.980 --> 34:39.460
 it difficult for something to run in the background, especially when it's eating up your battery,

34:39.460 --> 34:43.580
 right? Well, we wanted to make sure we didn't eat up the battery. So that one we can, we

34:43.580 --> 34:48.420
 actually are very proud of the fact that ours uses very little battery. Actually, even if

34:48.420 --> 34:53.700
 compared to Apple's own system. So beautiful. So what else is required to make this thing

34:53.700 --> 34:58.700
 work? Right. So the key was that you had to do a significant amount of work on the actual

34:58.700 --> 35:02.900
 mobile app development, which fortunately, the team that we brought was this kind of

35:02.900 --> 35:08.020
 general thinkers, where we would dig in deep into the operating system documentation and

35:08.020 --> 35:12.580
 the API libraries. So we got that working. But there's another angle, which is you also

35:12.580 --> 35:17.340
 need the servers to be able to compute fast enough, which is tying back to this old school

35:17.340 --> 35:21.940
 computer programming competitions and math Olympians. In fact, our team that was working

35:21.940 --> 35:28.420
 on the algorithm and backend side included several people who had been in these competitions

35:28.420 --> 35:33.780
 from before, which I happen to know because I do coach the team for the math. And so we

35:33.780 --> 35:40.220
 were able to bring people in to build servers, a server infrastructure in C++, actually,

35:40.220 --> 35:45.420
 so that we could support significant numbers of people without needing tons of servers.

35:45.420 --> 35:50.900
 Is there some distributed algorithms working here? Or you basically have to keep in the

35:50.900 --> 35:55.820
 same place the entire graph as it builds? Because especially the more and more people

35:55.820 --> 36:01.820
 use it, the bigger, the bigger the graph gets. I mean, this is very difficult scaling problem,

36:01.820 --> 36:07.340
 right? So that's actually why this computer algorithm competition stuff was handy. It's

36:07.340 --> 36:14.340
 because there are only about seven to eight giga people in the world. Yeah, that's not

36:14.340 --> 36:20.540
 that many. So if you can make your algorithms linear time or almost linear time, a computer

36:20.540 --> 36:26.260
 operates in gigahertz, I only need to do one run, one recalculation every hour in terms

36:26.260 --> 36:33.460
 of telling people how far away these dangers are. Yes. So I suddenly have 3,600 seconds

36:33.460 --> 36:39.980
 and my CPU cores are running in gigahertz. And at most they're eight giga people. Well,

36:39.980 --> 36:46.940
 you're skipping over the fact that there's n squared potential connections between people.

36:46.940 --> 36:54.940
 So how do you get around the fact that the potential set of relationship anyone of us

36:54.940 --> 37:00.820
 could have is eight billion. So it's eight billion times squared. That's the potential

37:00.820 --> 37:05.380
 amount of data you have to be storing and computing over and constantly updating.

37:05.380 --> 37:10.860
 So the way we dealt with that is we actually expect that the typical network is very sparse.

37:10.860 --> 37:15.780
 The technical term sparse would mean that the average degree or the average number of

37:15.780 --> 37:21.180
 connections that a person has is going to be at most like 100 strong connections that

37:21.180 --> 37:26.140
 you care about. If you think of it almost in terms of the heavy hitters, actually in

37:26.140 --> 37:32.860
 most people's lives, if we just kept track of their top 100 interactions, that's probably

37:32.860 --> 37:40.860
 most of the signal. Yeah. Yeah. I'm saddened to think that I might not be even in a double

37:40.860 --> 37:48.660
 digits but. Oh, I was intentionally giving a crazy number to account for college students.

37:48.660 --> 37:52.100
 Those are who you call in the heavy hitters, the people who are like the social butterflies.

37:52.100 --> 38:00.980
 Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to know that information about myself, by the way. Do you expose the

38:00.980 --> 38:06.140
 graph like how many, like about yourself, how many connections you have?

38:06.140 --> 38:10.340
 We do expose to each person how many direct connections they have. That's great. But for

38:10.340 --> 38:14.980
 privacy purposes, we don't tell anybody who their connections, like how their connections

38:14.980 --> 38:19.380
 are interconnected. Yes. Gotcha. But at the same time, we do expose also to everyone an

38:19.380 --> 38:24.580
 interesting chart that says, here's how many people you have that you're connected to directly.

38:24.580 --> 38:29.100
 Here's how many at distance two, meaning via people. And then here's how many at distance

38:29.100 --> 38:34.300
 three. And the reason we do that is that actually ends up being a dynamic that also boosts adoption.

38:34.300 --> 38:38.620
 It drives another feedback loop. The reason is because we saw actually when we deployed

38:38.620 --> 38:44.340
 this in some universities that when people see on their app that they are indirectly

38:44.340 --> 38:48.660
 connected to hundreds or thousands of other people, they get excited and they tell other

38:48.660 --> 38:53.340
 people, hey, let's download this app. But you know, we also saw in those examples, especially

38:53.340 --> 38:58.900
 looking at the screenshots people gave, that is hit as soon as the typical person has two

38:58.900 --> 39:04.820
 or three other direct connections on the system, because that means that our app has reached

39:04.820 --> 39:10.820
 a virality R0 of two to three. The key is we were making a viral app to fight a virus

39:10.820 --> 39:14.940
 spreading on the same network that the virus spreads on.

39:14.940 --> 39:20.260
 So you're trying to outvirus the virus. That's right. That's exactly right.

39:20.260 --> 39:26.020
 Okay, great. What have you learned from this whole experience in terms of, let's say for

39:26.020 --> 39:33.340
 COVID, but for future pandemics as well? Is it possible to use the power information

39:33.340 --> 39:39.980
 here of networked information as a virus spreads and travels in order to basically keep the

39:39.980 --> 39:46.340
 society open? Is it possible for people to protect themselves with this information?

39:46.340 --> 39:51.260
 Or do you still have to have most like in this overarching policy of everybody should

39:51.260 --> 39:55.020
 stay at home, all that kind of thing? We are trying to answer that question right

39:55.020 --> 39:59.540
 now. So the answer is we don't know yet, but that's actually why we're very happy that

39:59.540 --> 40:04.580
 now the idea has started to become more widely known and we're already starting to collaborate

40:04.580 --> 40:10.460
 with epidemiologists. Again, I'm just a mathematician, right? And a mathematician should not be

40:10.460 --> 40:15.540
 the person who is telling everybody this will definitely work. But because of the potential

40:15.540 --> 40:22.940
 power of this approach, especially the potential power of this being an end game for COVID,

40:22.940 --> 40:28.500
 we have gotten the interest of real researchers. And we're now working together to try to actually

40:28.500 --> 40:32.540
 understand the answer to that question. Because you see, there's a theory. So what I can share

40:32.540 --> 40:38.060
 is the mathematics of here's why there's some hope that this would work. And that's because

40:38.060 --> 40:42.740
 I'm talking about end game now. End game means you have very few cases. But everywhere we're

40:42.740 --> 40:46.940
 always thinking once there's few cases, then does that mean we now open up? Once you open

40:46.940 --> 40:51.660
 up in the past, then the cases go up again, until you have to lock down again. And now

40:51.660 --> 40:55.820
 when we talk about the dynamic process that makes, it's guaranteeing you always have cases

40:55.820 --> 40:59.780
 until you have the great vaccines, which is, you know, we both got vaccinated. This is

40:59.780 --> 41:04.220
 good. But at the same time, why I'm thinking this is still important is because we know

41:04.220 --> 41:10.260
 that many vaccine makers have said they're preparing for the next dose next year. And

41:10.260 --> 41:14.820
 if we have a perpetual thing where you just always need a new vaccine every year, it could

41:14.820 --> 41:19.180
 actually be beneficial to make sure we have as many other techniques as possible for parts

41:19.180 --> 41:23.060
 of the world that can't afford, for example, that kind of distribution.

41:23.060 --> 41:27.940
 Yeah. So actually, no matter how deadly the virus is, no matter how many things, whether

41:27.940 --> 41:33.340
 you have a vaccine or not, it's still useful to be having this information to stay home

41:33.340 --> 41:38.180
 or not, depending on how risk, like, I'm a big fan, just like you said, of having the

41:38.180 --> 41:43.740
 freedom for you to decide how risk averse you want to be, right? And depending on your

41:43.740 --> 41:49.060
 own conditions, but also in the state of like what you, just how dangerously you like to

41:49.060 --> 41:50.220
 live.

41:50.220 --> 41:55.420
 So I think that actually makes a lot of sense. And I also think that since we're, when you

41:55.420 --> 42:01.220
 think of disease spreading, it spreads in aggregate in the sense that if there are some

42:01.220 --> 42:06.900
 people who maybe are more risk tolerant because of other things in their life, well, there

42:06.900 --> 42:11.380
 might also be other people who are less risk tolerance. And then those people decide to

42:11.380 --> 42:17.580
 isolate. But what matters is in the aggregate that there are not of the infection spreading

42:17.580 --> 42:21.940
 drops below one. And so the key is if you, if you can empower people with that power

42:21.940 --> 42:25.900
 to make that decision, you might actually still be able to drive that are not down below

42:25.900 --> 42:26.900
 one.

42:26.900 --> 42:36.260
 Yeah. And also this is me talking. I, is people get a little bit nervous, I think, with information

42:36.260 --> 42:42.460
 somehow mapping to privacy violation. But I, first of all, in the approach you're describing,

42:42.460 --> 42:50.460
 that's respecting anonymity. But I would love to have information from the very beginning,

42:50.460 --> 42:59.380
 from March and April of last year, almost like a map of like where it's risky and where

42:59.380 --> 43:05.820
 it's not to go and not map based on sort of the exact location of people, but where people

43:05.820 --> 43:13.260
 usually hang out kind of thing. Just it may be not necessarily about actual location,

43:13.260 --> 43:19.460
 but just maybe activities. Like just to have information about what is, what is good to

43:19.460 --> 43:26.020
 do and not, you know, in terms of like safety, is it okay to run outside and not, is it okay

43:26.020 --> 43:30.540
 to go to a restaurant and not, I just feel like we're operating the blind. And then what

43:30.540 --> 43:36.660
 you had is a very imperfect signal, which is like basically politicians, desperately

43:36.660 --> 43:40.940
 trying to make statements about what is safe and not, they don't know what the heck they're

43:40.940 --> 43:45.540
 doing. They have a bunch of smart scientists telling them stuff. And the scientists themselves

43:45.540 --> 43:53.260
 also very important, don't always know what they're doing. Epidemiology is not, is as

43:53.260 --> 43:56.940
 much an artist of science, you're desperately trying to predict the future, which nobody

43:56.940 --> 44:01.740
 can do. And then you're trying to speak with some level of authority. I mean, if I were

44:01.740 --> 44:05.540
 to criticize scientists, they spoke with too much authority, it's okay to say, I'm not

44:05.540 --> 44:12.500
 sure. But then they think like, if I say I'm not sure, then there's going to be a distrust.

44:12.500 --> 44:16.060
 What they realize is when you're wrong and you say, I'm sure it's going to lead to more

44:16.060 --> 44:22.420
 distrust. So there's this imperfect, like just chaotic, messy system of people trying

44:22.420 --> 44:27.780
 to figure out with very little information. And what you're proposing is just a huge amount

44:27.780 --> 44:33.820
 of information. And information is power. Is there challenges with adoption that you

44:33.820 --> 44:39.620
 see in the future here? So there's, maybe we could speak to there's approaches, I guess

44:39.620 --> 44:47.860
 from Google, there's different people have tried similar kind of ideas. Not in, you have

44:47.860 --> 44:57.260
 quite a novel idea, actually. But speaking, the umbrella idea of contact tracing. Is there,

44:57.260 --> 45:02.220
 is there something in comment about why their approaches haven't been fully adopted? Is there

45:02.220 --> 45:07.380
 challenges there? Is there, is there reasons why no vid might be a better idea moving forward

45:07.380 --> 45:11.060
 in general, just about adoption? Yeah. So first of all, I want to say I always have

45:11.060 --> 45:14.940
 respect for the methods that other people use. And so it's good to see the other people

45:14.940 --> 45:21.420
 have been trying. But what we have noticed is that the difference between our value proposition

45:21.420 --> 45:25.300
 to the user and the value proposition to the user delivered by everything that was made

45:25.300 --> 45:33.300
 before is that, unfortunately, the action of installing a standard contact tracing app

45:33.300 --> 45:38.820
 will then tell you after you've already been exposed to the disease, so that you can protect

45:38.820 --> 45:44.740
 other people from you. And what that does to your own direct probability of getting sick,

45:44.740 --> 45:48.460
 if you think about it, suppose you were making the decision, should I or should I not install

45:48.460 --> 45:55.220
 one of those apps? What does that do to your own probability of getting sick? It's close

45:55.220 --> 46:01.500
 to zero. This is the sad thing you're, you're speaking to, not sad, I suppose it's the way

46:01.500 --> 46:07.900
 of the world is the only incentive there is to just help other people, I suppose. But

46:07.900 --> 46:13.780
 a much stronger incentive is anything that allows you to help yourself. Yes. So what

46:13.780 --> 46:20.100
 I'm saying is that let's just say free market capitalism was not based on altruism. I think

46:20.100 --> 46:25.340
 it's based on if you make a system of incentives so that everybody trying to maximize their

46:25.340 --> 46:30.740
 own situation somehow contributes to the whole. That's a game's theoretic solution to a very

46:30.740 --> 46:34.980
 hard problem. And so this is actually basically mechanism design, that we've basically come

46:34.980 --> 46:41.100
 up with a different mechanism, different set of incentives, which incentivizes the adoption.

46:41.100 --> 46:44.380
 Because actually whenever we've been rolling it out, usually the first question we ask

46:44.380 --> 46:49.420
 people like say in the university is, do you know what Novid does? And most of them have

46:49.420 --> 46:52.580
 read about the other apps and they say, oh, Novid will tell you after you've been around

46:52.580 --> 46:56.620
 someone so you can quarantine. And we have to explain to them, actually, Novid never

46:56.620 --> 47:00.140
 wants to ask you to quarantine. Yeah, that's not the principle. Our principle isn't based

47:00.140 --> 47:05.060
 on that at all. We just want to let you know if something is coming close so that you can

47:05.060 --> 47:11.340
 protect yourself. If you want. If you want. If you want. And the quarantine is like, yes,

47:11.340 --> 47:15.540
 in that case, if you're quarantining, it's because you're shutting the door from the

47:15.540 --> 47:22.380
 inside, if that makes sense. Exactly. I mean, this is brilliant. So what do you think the

47:22.380 --> 47:27.300
 future looks like for future pandemics? What's your plan with Novid? What's your plan with

47:27.300 --> 47:31.940
 all these set of ideas? I am actually still an academic and a researcher. So the biggest

47:31.940 --> 47:36.340
 work I'm working on right now is to try to build as many collaborations with other public

47:36.340 --> 47:42.140
 health researchers at other universities to actually work on pilot deployments together

47:42.140 --> 47:46.460
 in various places. That's the goal. That's actually ongoing work right now. And so for

47:46.460 --> 47:49.940
 example, if anyone's watching this and you happen to be a public health researcher and

47:49.940 --> 47:53.860
 you want to be involved in something like this, I'm just going to say I'm still incentive

47:53.860 --> 47:58.840
 thinking. There's something in it for the researchers too. This could open up an entire

47:58.840 --> 48:04.300
 new way of controlling disease. That's my hope. I mean, it might actually be true. And

48:04.300 --> 48:08.700
 people who are involved in figuring out how to make this work, well, it could actually

48:08.700 --> 48:12.100
 be good for their careers too. I always have to think like if a researcher was getting

48:12.100 --> 48:16.700
 involved, what are they getting out of it? Also, you mean like from a research perspective,

48:16.700 --> 48:26.260
 you can like publications and sets of ideas about how to, from a sort of network theory

48:26.260 --> 48:31.260
 perspective, understand how we control the spread of a pandemic. Yes. And what I'm doing

48:31.260 --> 48:35.180
 right now is this is basically interdisciplinary research where maybe our side is bringing

48:35.180 --> 48:39.620
 the technology and the network theory and the missing parts are epidemiology and public

48:39.620 --> 48:44.060
 health expertise. And if the two things start to join, also because everywhere that you

48:44.060 --> 48:48.500
 deploy, let's just say that the world is different in the Philippines as it is in the

48:48.500 --> 48:53.540
 United States. And just the natures of the locality would mean that someone like me

48:53.540 --> 48:56.820
 should not be trying to figure out how to do that. But if we can work with the researchers

48:56.820 --> 49:00.780
 who are based there, now suddenly we might come up with a solution that will help scale

49:00.780 --> 49:04.820
 in parts of the world where they aren't all getting the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which

49:04.820 --> 49:10.260
 cost like $20 a pop in the US. So if they want to participate, who do they reach out

49:10.260 --> 49:15.300
 to? Oh, that would just be us. I mean, the Novot.org website has Novot.org. It has a

49:15.300 --> 49:20.020
 feedback reach out form. And actually, we are, I mean, again, this is the DNA of being

49:20.020 --> 49:25.580
 a researcher. I am actually very excited by the idea that this could contribute knowledge

49:25.580 --> 49:30.820
 that will outlast all of our generations, like all of our lifetimes. There you go. Reach

49:30.820 --> 49:37.660
 out to Novot.org. What about individual people? Should they install the app and try it out

49:37.660 --> 49:42.020
 or is this really geographically restricted? Oh, yeah, I didn't come on here to tell everyone

49:42.020 --> 49:45.620
 to install the app. I did not come to tell everyone to install the app because it works

49:45.620 --> 49:52.140
 best if your local health authority is working with us. Gotcha. There's a reason it's because

49:52.140 --> 49:59.100
 this is back to the game theory. If anyone could just say I'm positive, the high school

49:59.100 --> 50:04.260
 senior prank would be to say that we have a massive outbreak on finals week. Let's not

50:04.260 --> 50:09.060
 have final exams. So the way that our system works, it actually borrows some ideas. We

50:09.060 --> 50:13.340
 came up with them independently. But this idea is similar to what Google and Apple do,

50:13.340 --> 50:17.300
 which is that if the local health authority is working with this, they can, for everyone

50:17.300 --> 50:21.580
 who's positive, give them a passcode that expires in a short time. So for ours, if you're

50:21.580 --> 50:26.900
 on the app and saying I'm positive, you can either just say that, and that's called unverified.

50:26.900 --> 50:30.660
 Or you can enter in one of these codes that you got from the local health authority. So

50:30.660 --> 50:33.780
 basically, for anyone who's watching this, it's not that you should just go and download

50:33.780 --> 50:37.500
 it, unless you want to go and look at it. That's cool. But if you, on the other hand,

50:37.500 --> 50:40.580
 if you happen to know anyone at the local health authority, which is trying to figure

50:40.580 --> 50:46.020
 out how to handle COVID, well, then, I mean, we'd be very happy to also work with you.

50:46.020 --> 50:51.340
 Gotcha. So the verified there is really important because you're maintaining anonymity. And

50:51.340 --> 50:56.220
 because of that, you have to have some source of verification in order to make sure that

50:56.220 --> 51:02.020
 it's not possible to manipulate. Because it's ultimately about trust and information.

51:02.020 --> 51:07.100
 So it could be, verification is a really important there. So basically, individual

51:07.100 --> 51:16.220
 people should ask their local health authorities to sign up to contact you. I hope this spreads.

51:16.220 --> 51:21.940
 I hope this spreads for future pandemics because I'm really, it's the amount, the millions

51:21.940 --> 51:30.020
 of people who are hurt by this, I think, are a response to the virus, economically speaking.

51:30.020 --> 51:35.660
 The number of people who lost their dream, lost their jobs, but also lost their dream.

51:35.660 --> 51:40.900
 Entrepreneurs, you know, jobs often give meaning. There's people who financially and psychologically

51:40.900 --> 51:47.780
 are suffering because of our, I'll say it, incompetent response to the virus across the

51:47.780 --> 51:53.940
 world. But certainly United States, that should be the beacon of entrepreneurial hope for

51:53.940 --> 52:02.140
 the world. So I hope that we'll be able to respond to these kinds of events much better

52:02.140 --> 52:06.380
 in the future. And this is exactly the right kind of idea. And now is the time to do the

52:06.380 --> 52:15.620
 investment. Let's step back to the beauty of mathematics. Maybe ask the big silly question

52:15.620 --> 52:20.780
 first, which is, what do you find beautiful about mathematics?

52:20.780 --> 52:29.020
 I think that being able to look at a complicated problem, which looks unsolvable, and then to

52:29.020 --> 52:34.140
 be able to change the perspective to come from a different angle and suddenly see that there's

52:34.140 --> 52:39.260
 a nice solution. I don't mean that every problem in math is supposed to be this way, but I

52:39.260 --> 52:43.740
 think that these reframings and changing of perspectives that cause difficult things to

52:43.740 --> 52:49.340
 get simplified and crystallized and factored in certain ways is beautiful. Actually, that's

52:49.340 --> 52:53.500
 related to what we were just talking about with even this fighting pandemics. The crystal

52:53.500 --> 53:01.940
 idea was just quantify proximity by the number of relationships in the physical network instead

53:01.940 --> 53:09.300
 of just by the feet and meters. If you change that perspective, now all of these things follow.

53:09.300 --> 53:14.500
 And so mathematics, to me, is beautiful in the pure sense just for that.

53:14.500 --> 53:20.740
 Yeah, it's quite interesting to see a human civilization as a network, as a graph, and

53:20.740 --> 53:30.940
 our relationships as edges in that graph. Outside of just pandemic, do interesting inferences

53:30.940 --> 53:38.580
 based on that. This is true for Twitter, social networks, and so on, how we expand the kind

53:38.580 --> 53:44.780
 of things we talk about, think about sort of politically, if you have this little bubble,

53:44.780 --> 53:50.540
 of ideas that you play with, it's nice from a recommender system perspective. How do you

53:50.540 --> 53:56.580
 jump out of those bubbles? It's really fascinating. YouTube was working on that, Twitter's working

53:56.580 --> 54:03.700
 on that, but not always so successfully. But there's a lot of interesting work from a mathematical

54:03.700 --> 54:10.740
 and a psychological, sociological perspective there within those graphs. But if we look

54:10.740 --> 54:16.460
 at the cleanest formulation of that, of looking at a problem from different perspective, you're

54:16.460 --> 54:26.100
 also involved with the International Mathematics Olympiad, which takes small, clean problems

54:26.100 --> 54:31.460
 that are really hard. But once you look at them differently, can become easy. But that

54:31.460 --> 54:39.140
 little jump of innovation is the entire trick. So maybe at the high level, can you say what

54:39.140 --> 54:41.340
 is the International Mathematical Olympiad?

54:41.340 --> 54:47.860
 Sure. So this is the competition for people who aren't yet in college, math competition,

54:47.860 --> 54:52.900
 which is the most prestigious one in the entire world. It's still Olympics of mathematics,

54:52.900 --> 54:56.980
 but only for people who aren't yet in college. Now, the kinds of questions that they ask

54:56.980 --> 55:01.340
 you to do are not computational. Usually, you're not supposed to find that the answer

55:01.340 --> 55:08.940
 is 42. Instead, you're supposed to explain why something is true. And the problem is

55:08.940 --> 55:12.700
 that at the beginning, when you look at each of the questions, first of all, you have four

55:12.700 --> 55:16.780
 and a half hours to solve three questions. And this is one day. And then you have a second

55:16.780 --> 55:20.740
 day, which is four and a half hours, three questions. But when you look at the questions,

55:20.740 --> 55:25.420
 they're all asking you, explain why the following thing is true, which you've never seen before.

55:25.420 --> 55:29.100
 And by the way, even though there are six questions, if you solve any one of them, you're a genius

55:29.100 --> 55:32.700
 and you get an honorable mention. So this is hard to solve.

55:32.700 --> 55:36.100
 So what about, is it one person? Is it a team?

55:36.100 --> 55:42.420
 So each country can send six people and the score of the country is actually unofficial.

55:42.420 --> 55:46.740
 There's not an official country versus country system, although everyone just adds up the

55:46.740 --> 55:51.620
 point scores of the six people and they say, well, now which country stacked up where?

55:51.620 --> 55:57.060
 So maybe as a side comment, I should say that there's a bunch of countries, including the

55:57.060 --> 56:05.420
 former Soviet Union and Russia, where I grew up, where this is one of the most important

56:05.420 --> 56:10.940
 competitions that the country participates in. Like it was a source of pride for a lot

56:10.940 --> 56:17.500
 of the country. You look at the Olympic sports like wrestling, weightlifting, there's certain

56:17.500 --> 56:25.140
 sports and hockey that Russia and the Soviet Union truly took pride in.

56:25.140 --> 56:31.620
 And actually the mathematical Olympiad, it was one of them for many years. It's still

56:31.620 --> 56:36.020
 one of them. And that's kind of fascinating. We don't think about it this way in the United

56:36.020 --> 56:41.940
 States. Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's not nearly as popular in the United

56:41.940 --> 56:47.900
 States in terms of its integration into the culture, into just basic conversation, into

56:47.900 --> 56:53.900
 the pride. Like, you know, if you win an Olympic gold medal or if you win the Super Bowl, you

56:53.900 --> 57:00.340
 can walk around proud. I think that was the case with the mathematical Olympiad in Russia.

57:00.340 --> 57:04.260
 Not as much the case in the United States, I think. So I just want to give that a little

57:04.260 --> 57:09.500
 aside because beating anybody from Russia, from the Eastern Republic or from China is

57:09.500 --> 57:16.940
 very, very difficult. If I remember correctly, you know, there's people, this was a multi

57:16.940 --> 57:25.860
 year training process. They train hard. And this is everything that they're focused on.

57:25.860 --> 57:33.300
 My dad was a participant in this. And I mean, it's as serious as Olympic sports. You think

57:33.300 --> 57:37.540
 about like gymnastics, like young athletes participating in gymnastics. It's as serious

57:37.540 --> 57:41.420
 as that if not more serious. So I just want to give that a little bit of context because

57:41.420 --> 57:46.220
 we're talking about serious high level math, athletics almost here.

57:46.220 --> 57:51.380
 Yeah. And actually, I also think that it made sense from the Soviet Union's perspective

57:51.380 --> 57:57.260
 because if you look at what these people do eventually, even though, let's look at the

57:57.260 --> 58:02.540
 USSR's International Math Olympiad record, even though they, I say, even though they

58:02.540 --> 58:07.500
 won a lot of awards at the high school thing, many of them went on to do incredible things

58:07.500 --> 58:13.340
 in research mathematics or research other things. And that's showing the generalization,

58:13.340 --> 58:19.100
 generalizability of what they were working on. Because ultimately, we're just playing

58:19.100 --> 58:25.900
 with ideas of how to prove things. And if you get pretty good at inventing creative ways

58:25.900 --> 58:32.740
 to turn problems apart, split them apart, observe neat ways to turn messy things into

58:32.740 --> 58:37.260
 simple crystals, well, if you're going to try to solve any real problem in the real world,

58:37.260 --> 58:42.340
 that could be a really handy tool too. So I don't think it was a bad investment. I think

58:42.340 --> 58:47.700
 clearly it worked well for Soviet Union. Yeah. So this, this is interesting. People sometimes

58:47.700 --> 58:56.060
 ask me, you know, you go up and under communism, you know, was there anything good about communism?

58:56.060 --> 59:00.460
 And it's difficult for me to talk about it because it's not communism is one of those

59:00.460 --> 59:05.820
 things that's looked down on like without in absolutist terms currently. But you can

59:05.820 --> 59:11.340
 still, in my perspective, talk about the actual forget communism or whatever the actual term

59:11.340 --> 59:18.260
 is, but you know, certain ways that the society function that we can learn lessons from.

59:18.260 --> 59:25.580
 And one of the things in the Soviet Union that was highly prized is knowledge, not even

59:25.580 --> 59:35.060
 knowledge, wisdom, and the skill of invention of innovation at a young age. So we're not

59:35.060 --> 59:40.940
 talking about a selection process where you pick the best students in the school to do

59:40.940 --> 59:49.420
 the mathematics or to read literature. It's like everybody did it. Everybody. It was almost

59:49.420 --> 59:55.940
 treated as if anyone could be the next Einstein, anybody could be the next, I don't know, Hemingway

59:55.940 --> 1:00:04.140
 James Joyce. And so you're forcing an education on the populace and a rigorous deep education.

1:00:04.140 --> 1:00:11.460
 Like as opposed to kind of like, oh, we want to make sure we teach to the weakest student

1:00:11.460 --> 1:00:20.460
 in the class, which American systems can sometimes do because we don't want to leave anyone behind.

1:00:20.460 --> 1:00:25.780
 The Russian system was anyone can be the strongest student, and we're going to teach you the

1:00:25.780 --> 1:00:31.500
 strongest student, and we're going to just to pretend or force everybody, even the weakest

1:00:31.500 --> 1:00:36.180
 student to be strong. And what that results in, it's obviously this is what people talk

1:00:36.180 --> 1:00:41.020
 about as a huge amount of pressure. Like it's psychologically very difficult. This is why

1:00:41.020 --> 1:00:44.940
 people struggle when they go to MIT, this very competitive environment, it can be very

1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:50.100
 psychologically difficult, but at the same time, it's bringing out the best out of people.

1:00:50.100 --> 1:00:54.700
 And that mathematics was certainly one of those things. And exactly what you're saying,

1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:59.780
 which kind of clicked with me just now, as opposed to kind of a spelling bee in the United

1:00:59.780 --> 1:01:05.100
 States, which I guess you spell, I'm horrible at this, but it's a competition about spelling,

1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:10.980
 which I'm not sure, but you could argue doesn't generalize well to the future skills. Mathematics,

1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:20.420
 especially this kind of mathematics, is essentially formalized competition of invention, of creating

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:26.140
 new ideas. And that generalizes really, really well. So that's quite brilliantly put. I didn't

1:01:26.140 --> 1:01:31.180
 really think about that. So this is not just about the competition. This is about developing

1:01:31.180 --> 1:01:37.260
 minds that will come to do some incredible stuff in the future.

1:01:37.260 --> 1:01:41.340
 Yeah, actually, I want to respond to a couple of things there. The first one is one, which

1:01:41.340 --> 1:01:47.180
 is this notion of whether or not that is possible in a non authoritarian regime. I think it is.

1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:51.580
 And that's actually why I spent some of my efforts before the COVID thing, actually trying

1:01:51.580 --> 1:01:57.660
 to work towards there. The reason is because if you think about it, let's say in America,

1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:02.420
 lots of people are pretty serious about training very hard for football or baseball or basketball,

1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:07.180
 basketball is very, very accessible, but lots of people are doing that. Why? Well, actually,

1:02:07.180 --> 1:02:14.380
 I think that what was going on with authoritarian thing was at least the message that was universally

1:02:14.380 --> 1:02:21.900
 sent was being a good thinker and a creator of ideas is a good thing.

1:02:21.900 --> 1:02:22.900
 Yes, exactly.

1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:27.580
 There's no reason why that message can't be sent everywhere. And I think it actually

1:02:27.580 --> 1:02:32.180
 should be. So that's the first thing. The second thing is what you commented about this

1:02:32.180 --> 1:02:38.020
 thing about, you know, the generalizable skill and what could people do with Olympics afterwards?

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:44.740
 So that's actually my interest in the whole thing. I don't just coach students how to

1:02:44.740 --> 1:02:48.060
 do problems. In fact, I'm not even the best person for that. I'm not the best at solving

1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:51.980
 these problems. There are other people who are much better at making problems and teaching

1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:57.220
 people how to solve problems. In fact, when the Mathematical Association of America, which

1:02:57.220 --> 1:03:01.500
 is the group which is in charge of the US participation in these Olympics, when they

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:07.660
 were deciding whether or not to put me in back in 2013 as the head coach, I had a conversation

1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:14.180
 with their executive director where I commented that we might do worse because my position

1:03:14.180 --> 1:03:18.900
 was I don't, I mean, I actually didn't want to focus on winning. I said, if you're going

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:25.060
 to let me work with 60 very strong minds as picked through this system because the coach

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:29.380
 works with these, gets to run a camp for these students. I said, I'm actually not going to

1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:35.060
 define my success in terms of winning this contest. I said I wanted to maximize the number

1:03:35.060 --> 1:03:40.940
 of the students that I read about in the New York Times in 20 years. And the executive

1:03:40.940 --> 1:03:46.020
 director of the Mathematical Association of America was fully in support of this because

1:03:46.020 --> 1:03:50.380
 that's also how their philosophy is. So in America, the way we run this is we're actually

1:03:50.380 --> 1:03:56.660
 not just training to win, even though the students are very good and they can win anyway.

1:03:56.660 --> 1:04:01.620
 One reason, for example, I went and even did the COVID thing involving quite a few of them

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:06.020
 is so that hopefully some of them get ideas because in 20, 30 years, I won't have the

1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:11.100
 energy or the insight to solve problems. We'll have another catastrophe and hopefully some

1:04:11.100 --> 1:04:15.260
 of these people will step up and do it and ultimately have that long term impact. I wonder

1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:22.820
 if this is scalable to, because that's such a great metric for education, not how to get

1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:31.860
 an A on the test, but how to have, how to be on the cover of New York Times for inventing

1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:38.540
 something new. Do you think that's generalizable to education beyond just this particular

1:04:38.540 --> 1:04:44.340
 Olympia? Even you saying this feels like a rare statement, almost like a radical statement

1:04:44.340 --> 1:04:46.060
 as a goal for education.

1:04:46.060 --> 1:04:49.620
 So actually the way I teach my classes at Carnegie Mellon, which I will admit right

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:54.180
 away is not equivalent to the average in the world, but it's already not, it's already

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:59.300
 not just the top 60 in the country as picked by something. Let me just explain. I have

1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:03.100
 exams in my class, which are 90% of the grade. So the exams are the whole thing, or most

1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:04.100
 of the whole thing.

1:05:04.100 --> 1:05:08.100
 And the way that I let students prepare for the exams is I show them all the problems

1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:11.900
 I've ever given on the previous exams and the whole, the exam that they will take is

1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:15.540
 open notes. They can take all the notes they want on the previous problems. And the guarantee

1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:19.180
 is that the exam problems this time will have no overlap with anything you have seen be

1:05:19.180 --> 1:05:24.940
 given in the past, as well as no overlap with anything I taught in the class. So the entire

1:05:24.940 --> 1:05:26.420
 exam is invention.

1:05:26.420 --> 1:05:27.420
 Wow.

1:05:27.420 --> 1:05:33.100
 But that's how I go, right? My point is, I have explained to people, when I teach you,

1:05:33.100 --> 1:05:37.780
 I don't want you to have remembered a method I showed you. I want you to have learned enough

1:05:37.780 --> 1:05:43.020
 about this area that if you face a new question, which I came up with the night before by thinking

1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:47.100
 about like, what could I ask that I have never asked before? Oh, that's cute. I wonder what

1:05:47.100 --> 1:05:51.580
 the answer is. Aha, that's an exam problem. That's exactly what I do before the exam.

1:05:51.580 --> 1:05:55.500
 And then that's what I want them to learn. And the first exam, usually people have a

1:05:55.500 --> 1:05:59.460
 rough time because it's like, what, what kind of crazy class is this? The professor doesn't

1:05:59.460 --> 1:06:03.900
 teach you anything for the exam. But then by the second or third, and by the time they

1:06:03.900 --> 1:06:09.300
 finish the class, they have learned how to solve anything in the area.

1:06:09.300 --> 1:06:10.300
 How to invent.

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:12.300
 How to invent in that area. Yeah.

1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:15.260
 Can we walk back to the, the, the mathematical Olympia?

1:06:15.260 --> 1:06:16.260
 Yes.

1:06:16.260 --> 1:06:20.940
 How to invent in format like, and also what does it take to win?

1:06:20.940 --> 1:06:27.660
 So the way it works is that each of the six students do the problems and there are six

1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:31.820
 problems. All the problems are equally weighted. So each one's worth seven points. That means

1:06:31.820 --> 1:06:36.160
 that your maximum score is six problems times seven points, which is the nice number of

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:41.860
 42. And now the way that they're scored, by the way, is there's partial credit. So the

1:06:41.860 --> 1:06:47.780
 question is asking you, explain why this weird fact is true. Okay. If you explain why you

1:06:47.780 --> 1:06:52.420
 get seven points. If you make minor mistake, maybe you get six points. But if you don't

1:06:52.420 --> 1:07:00.700
 succeed in explaining why, but you explain some other true fact, which is along the way

1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:06.180
 of proving it, then you get partial credit. And, and actually now this is tricky because

1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:12.380
 how do you score such a thing? It's not like it was, the answer was 72 and you wrote 71

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:16.100
 and it's close, right? The answer is 72 and you wrote 36. Oh, but that's pretty close

1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:19.220
 because you were, you know, that maybe you were just off by, but by the way, they're

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:23.900
 not numerical anyway, but I'm just giving some numerical analog to the way the scoring

1:07:23.900 --> 1:07:28.620
 might work. They are all essays. And that's where I guess I have some role as well as

1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:34.500
 some other people who helped me in the US delegation for coaches. We actually debate

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:39.380
 with the country which is organizing it. The country which is organizing the Olympiad

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:46.780
 brings about 50 people to help judge the written solutions. And you, you know, you schedule

1:07:46.780 --> 1:07:51.620
 these half hour appointments where the delegation from one country sits down at a table like

1:07:51.620 --> 1:07:56.300
 this opposite side is two or three people from the host country. And they're just looking

1:07:56.300 --> 1:08:01.700
 over these exam papers saying, well, how many points is this worth based on some rubric

1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:07.020
 that has been designed? And this is a negotiation process where we're not, we're not trying

1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:10.980
 to bargain and get the best score we can. In fact, sometimes we go to this table and

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:15.460
 we will say, we think we want less than what you gave us. This is how this is how our,

1:08:15.460 --> 1:08:19.020
 these are our principles. If you give us too much, we say, no, you gave us too much. We

1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:22.980
 do that. However, the reason why this is an interesting process is because if you can

1:08:22.980 --> 1:08:27.420
 imagine every country which is participating has its own language. And so if you're trying

1:08:27.420 --> 1:08:32.140
 to grade the Mongolian scripts and they're written in Mongolian, if you don't read Mongolian,

1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:37.580
 which most people don't, then the, the coaches are explaining to you, this is what the student

1:08:37.580 --> 1:08:40.260
 has written. It's actually quite interesting process.

1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:46.700
 So it's almost like a, like a jury, you know, you have, you have a, in the American legal

1:08:46.700 --> 1:08:52.620
 system, you have a jury that where they're deliberating, but unlike a jury, there's the

1:08:52.620 --> 1:09:00.060
 members of the jury speaking different languages sometimes. That's fascinating. But, I mean,

1:09:00.060 --> 1:09:06.140
 it's hard to know what to do because it's probably really, really competitive. But your

1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:14.900
 sense is that ultimately people, like how do you prevent manipulation here, right?

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:21.020
 Well, we just hope that it's not happening. So, so we write in English. Therefore, everything

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:25.660
 that the U.S. does, everyone can look at. So it's very hard for, it's very hard for

1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:31.300
 you to manipulate. We don't manipulate. We only hope that other people aren't. But at

1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:35.300
 the same time, as you see, our philosophy was we want to use this as a way to develop

1:09:35.300 --> 1:09:40.060
 general talent. And although we do this for the six people who go to the International

1:09:40.060 --> 1:09:45.900
 Math Olympiad, we really want that everyone at any, touch at any stage of this process

1:09:45.900 --> 1:09:51.300
 get some skills that can help to contribute more later. So I don't know if you can say

1:09:51.300 --> 1:09:56.020
 something insightful to this question, but what do you think makes a really hard math

1:09:56.020 --> 1:10:03.180
 problem on this Olympiad, maybe in the courses you teach or in general? What makes for a

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:07.780
 hard problem? You've seen, I'm sure, a lot of really difficult problems. What makes

1:10:07.780 --> 1:10:08.780
 a hard problem?

1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:14.460
 So I could quantify it by the number of leaps of insight of changes of perspective that are

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:18.500
 along the way. And here's why. This is like a very theoretical computer science bit of

1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:24.940
 looking at it. It's that each reframing of the problem and using of some tool, I actually

1:10:24.940 --> 1:10:29.900
 call that a leap of insight. When you say, oh, wow, now I see I should kind of put these

1:10:29.900 --> 1:10:34.940
 plugs into those sockets like so. And suddenly I get to use that machine. Oh, but I'm not

1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:40.660
 done yet. Now I need to do it again. Each such step is a large possible, large fan out in

1:10:40.660 --> 1:10:46.300
 the search space. The number of these tells you the exponent. The base of the exponent

1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:51.340
 is like how big, how many different possibilities you could try. And that's, that's, that's

1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:57.060
 actually why like if you have a three insight problem, that is not three times as hard as

1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:00.660
 a one insight problem. Because after you've made the one insight, it's not clear that

1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:06.980
 that was the right track necessarily, unless you're still a branching of possible.

1:11:06.980 --> 1:11:14.100
 You're saying there's problems like on the math Olympia that requires more than one

1:11:14.100 --> 1:11:18.220
 insight. Yes. Those are the hard ones. And also I can tell you how, how you can tell.

1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:23.540
 So this is how I also taught myself math when I was in college. So if you are taking a,

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:27.340
 not taught myself, I was taking classes, of course, but I was trying to read the textbook.

1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:31.060
 And I found out I was very bad at reading math textbooks. A math textbook has a long

1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:35.540
 page of stuff that is all true, which after you read the page, you have no idea what you

1:11:35.540 --> 1:11:41.660
 just read. Yeah. This is just a good summary of a math textbook. Okay. Yeah. Because it's

1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:46.740
 not clear why anything was done that way. And yes, everything is true, but how the heck

1:11:46.740 --> 1:11:52.500
 did anyone think of that? So the way that I taught myself math eventually was the way

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:57.300
 I read a math textbook is I would look at the theorem statement. I would look at the length

1:11:57.300 --> 1:12:03.620
 of the proof and then I would close the book and attempt to reprove it myself. Yeah. Now,

1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:07.500
 the length of the proof is telling you the number of insights, because the length of

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:13.260
 the proof is linear in the number of insights. Each insight takes space. Yeah. And if I know

1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:17.700
 that it's a short proof, I know that there's only one insight. So when I'm doing my own

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:23.260
 way of solving the problem, like finding the proof, I quit if I have to do too many plugings.

1:12:23.260 --> 1:12:26.660
 It's equivalent to a math contest. In a math contest, I look, is it problem one, two or

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:31.420
 three? That tells me how many insights there are. This is exactly what I did. That's brilliant.

1:12:31.420 --> 1:12:36.820
 Linear in the number. I don't know. I think it's possible that that's true. Approximately.

1:12:36.820 --> 1:12:42.420
 Approximately. Yeah. I don't know if somebody out there is going to try to formally prove

1:12:42.420 --> 1:12:46.180
 this. Oh, no. I mean, you're right. There are cases where maybe it's not quite linear,

1:12:46.180 --> 1:12:50.220
 but in general. Well, some of it is notation too, and some of it is style and all those

1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:54.660
 kinds of things, but within a textbook. Within the same book. Within the same book. Yes.

1:12:54.660 --> 1:12:58.940
 Within the same book on the same subject. Yeah. This is what I was using. That's hilarious.

1:12:58.940 --> 1:13:02.220
 Because you know, if it's a two page proof, you just know this is going to be insane.

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:07.020
 Right? That's the scary thing about insights. You

1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:14.380
 look like Andrew Wiles working on the Fermat's last theorem is you don't know something seems

1:13:14.380 --> 1:13:21.260
 like a good idea, and you have that idea, and it feels like this is a leap, like a totally

1:13:21.260 --> 1:13:26.580
 new way to see it, but you have no idea if it's at all useful. Even if you think it's

1:13:26.580 --> 1:13:31.180
 correct. You have no idea if this is like going to go down a path that's completely counter

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:39.500
 productive or not productive at all. That's the crappy thing about invention is, like

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:46.700
 I have, I'm sure you do. I have a lot of really good ideas every single day, but like, and

1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:52.900
 then I'll go inside my head along them, along that little trajectory, but it could be just

1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:59.580
 a total waste. You know what that feels like? It just feels like patience is required not

1:13:59.580 --> 1:14:04.380
 to get excited at any one thing. I think this is interesting because you raised Andrew

1:14:04.380 --> 1:14:10.340
 Wiles. He spent seven years attacking the same thing. Right? I think that what attracts

1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:15.220
 professional researchers to this is because even though it's very painful that you keep

1:14:15.220 --> 1:14:20.780
 fighting with something, when you finally find the right insights and string them together,

1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:30.660
 it feels really good. There's also like short term, it feels good to, whether it's real

1:14:30.660 --> 1:14:35.820
 or not, to pretend like you've solved something in the sense like you have an insight and

1:14:35.820 --> 1:14:41.580
 there's a sense like this might be the insight that solves it. So at least for me, I just

1:14:41.580 --> 1:14:46.860
 enjoy that rush of positivity, even though I know statistically speaking is probably

1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:52.180
 going to be a dead end. I'm the same way. In fact, that's how I know whether I might

1:14:52.180 --> 1:14:55.940
 want to keep thinking about this general problem. It's like if I still see that I'm getting

1:14:55.940 --> 1:15:00.580
 some insights, I'm not at a dead end yet. But that's also where I learned something

1:15:00.580 --> 1:15:04.820
 from my PhD advisor. Actually, he was a real big inspiration on my life. His name is Benny

1:15:04.820 --> 1:15:11.100
 Sudakov. In fact, he grew up in the former Soviet Union. He was from Georgia, but he's

1:15:11.100 --> 1:15:18.340
 an incredible person. But one thing I learned was choose the problems to work on that might

1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:24.220
 matter if you succeed. Because that's why, for example, we dug into COVID. It was just,

1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:29.220
 well, suppose we succeed in finding some interesting insight here. Well, it actually matters. That

1:15:29.220 --> 1:15:30.220
 is worth five.

1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:38.620
 Yeah. And I think COVID, the way you're approaching COVID has two interesting possibilities. One,

1:15:38.620 --> 1:15:48.540
 you might help with COVID or another pandemic. But two, just this whole network theory space,

1:15:48.540 --> 1:15:53.420
 you might unlock some deep understanding about the interaction with human beings that might

1:15:53.420 --> 1:15:59.300
 have nothing to do with the pandemic. There's a space of possible impacts that may be direct

1:15:59.300 --> 1:16:07.020
 or indirect. And the same thing is with Andrew Wiles's proof. I don't understand, but apparently,

1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:15.020
 the pieces of it are really impactful for mathematics, even if the main theorem is not.

1:16:15.020 --> 1:16:23.020
 So along the way, the insights you have might be really powerful for unexpected reasons.

1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:26.100
 So I like what you said. This is something that I learned from another friend of mine

1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:29.540
 who's also, he's a very famous researcher. All these people are more famous than I am.

1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:34.180
 His name is Jacob Fox. He's Jacob Fox at Stanford. Also a very big inspiration for me. We were

1:16:34.180 --> 1:16:36.100
 both grad students together at the same time.

1:16:36.100 --> 1:16:38.220
 Well, most importantly, you're good at selecting good friends.

1:16:38.220 --> 1:16:42.220
 Oh, yeah. That's the key. You've got to find good people to learn things from. But his

1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:47.260
 thing was he often said, if you solve a math problem and have this math proof, math problem

1:16:47.260 --> 1:16:51.860
 for him is like a proof, right? So suppose you came up with this proof, he always asks,

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:56.340
 what have we learned from this that we could potentially use for something else? It's not

1:16:56.340 --> 1:17:00.780
 just did you solve the problem that was supposed to be famous? It was, and is there something

1:17:00.780 --> 1:17:05.660
 new in the course of solving this that you had to invent that we could now use as a tool

1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:06.660
 elsewhere?

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:13.780
 Yeah, there's this funny effect where just looking at different fields where people discover

1:17:13.780 --> 1:17:18.140
 parallels. They'll prove something. It'll be a totally new result. And then somebody

1:17:18.140 --> 1:17:23.500
 later realizes this was already done 30 years ago and another discipline in another way.

1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:30.380
 And it's really interesting. We did this offline in another illustration he showed to me. It's

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:37.820
 interesting to see the different perspectives on a problem. It kind of points like there's

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:44.780
 just like very few novel ideas that everything else that most of us are just looking at different

1:17:44.780 --> 1:17:51.700
 perspective on the same idea. And it makes you wonder this old silly question that I

1:17:51.700 --> 1:18:01.340
 have to ask you is, do you think mathematics is discovered or invented? Do you think we're

1:18:01.340 --> 1:18:09.660
 creating new idea, we're building a set of knowledge that's distinct from reality? Or

1:18:09.660 --> 1:18:15.100
 are we actually like, is math almost like a shovel where we're digging to like this

1:18:15.100 --> 1:18:20.100
 core set of truths that were always there all along?

1:18:20.100 --> 1:18:25.620
 I personally feel like it's discovered. But that's also because I guess the way that I

1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:29.860
 like to choose what questions to work on are questions that maybe we'll get to learn something

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:35.620
 about why is this hard? I mean, I'm often attracted to questions that look simple but

1:18:35.620 --> 1:18:39.780
 are hard, right? And what could you possibly learn from that? Sort of like probably the

1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:44.300
 attraction of Fermat's last theorem, as you mentioned, simple statement, why is it so

1:18:44.300 --> 1:18:49.580
 hard? So I'm more on the discovered side. And I also feel like if we ever ran into an

1:18:49.580 --> 1:18:57.340
 intelligent other species in the universe, probably if we compared notes, there might

1:18:57.340 --> 1:19:03.660
 be some similarities between both of us realizing that pi is important. Because you might say,

1:19:03.660 --> 1:19:08.220
 why humans? Do humans like circles more than others? I think stars also like circles. I

1:19:08.220 --> 1:19:12.540
 think planets like circles, they're not perfect circles. But nevertheless, the concept of

1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:17.420
 a circle is just point and constant distance doesn't get any simpler than that.

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:23.060
 It's possible that like an alien species will have, depending on different cognitive capabilities

1:19:23.060 --> 1:19:28.940
 and different perception systems, will be able to see things that are much different

1:19:28.940 --> 1:19:35.540
 than circles. And so if it's discovered, it will still be pointing at a lot of same

1:19:35.540 --> 1:19:42.940
 geometrical concepts, mathematical concepts. But it's interesting to think of how many

1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:48.380
 things we would have to still align, not just based on notation, but based on understanding

1:19:48.380 --> 1:19:56.900
 like just like some basic mathematical concepts, like how much work is there going to be in

1:19:56.900 --> 1:20:02.300
 trying to find a common language? I mean, this is, I think Stephen Wolfram and his son

1:20:02.300 --> 1:20:08.500
 helped with the movie Arrival, like developing an alien language, like how would aliens communicate

1:20:08.500 --> 1:20:14.420
 with humans? It's fascinating because like math seems to be the most promising thing.

1:20:14.420 --> 1:20:22.860
 But even like math, like how do you visualize mathematical ideas? It feels like there has

1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:27.420
 to be an interactive component, just like we have a conversation. There has to be, this

1:20:27.420 --> 1:20:32.340
 is something we don't, I think think about often, which is like, with somebody who doesn't

1:20:32.340 --> 1:20:37.580
 know anything about math, doesn't know anything about English or any other natural language,

1:20:37.580 --> 1:20:44.300
 how would we describe, we talked offline about visual proofs, how would we, through visual

1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:52.700
 proofs, have a conversation where we say something, here's the concept, the way we see it. Does

1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:58.100
 that make sense to you? And like, can you mess with that concept to make it sense for

1:20:58.100 --> 1:21:03.060
 you? And then go back and forth in this kind of way. So purely through mathematics, I'm

1:21:03.060 --> 1:21:06.460
 sure it's possible to have those kind of experiments with like tribes on earth that

1:21:06.460 --> 1:21:11.340
 don't, there's no common language. Through math, like draw a circle and see what they

1:21:11.340 --> 1:21:17.540
 do with it, right? Do some of these visual proofs, like the summation of the odds and

1:21:17.540 --> 1:21:23.100
 the adds up to the squares. Yes, I wonder how difficult that is before one or the other

1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:26.100
 species murders.

1:21:26.100 --> 1:21:32.140
 I hope that the curiosity for knowledge will overpower the greedy, this is back to our

1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:38.180
 game theory thing, that the curiosity of like discovering math together will overpower the

1:21:38.180 --> 1:21:44.580
 desire for resources and ultimately like, you know, willing to commit violence in order

1:21:44.580 --> 1:21:50.060
 to gain those resources. I think as we progress, become more and more intelligent as a species,

1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:54.520
 I'm hoping we would value more and more the knowledge because we'll come up with clever

1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:58.940
 ways to gain more resources so we won't be so resource starved. I don't know. That's

1:21:58.940 --> 1:22:04.740
 a hopeful message from when we finally meet aliens. Yeah. Yeah. The cool thing about

1:22:04.740 --> 1:22:13.340
 the math Olympiad, I don't know if you know work from Francois Chalet from Google, he

1:22:13.340 --> 1:22:21.420
 came up with this kind of IQ test slash, it kind of has similar aspects to it that also

1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:29.540
 the math Olympiad does for AI. So he came up with these tests where they're very simple

1:22:29.540 --> 1:22:37.160
 for humans, but very difficult for AI to illustrate exactly why we're just not good at seeing

1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:46.380
 a totally new problem. We, sorry, AI systems are not good at looking at a new problem that

1:22:46.380 --> 1:22:54.780
 requires you to detect that there's a symmetry of some kind or there's a pattern that hasn't

1:22:54.780 --> 1:23:00.340
 seen before. The pattern is like obvious to us humans, but it's not so obvious to find

1:23:00.340 --> 1:23:11.740
 that kind of, it's you're inventing a pattern that's there in order to then find a solution.

1:23:11.740 --> 1:23:18.060
 I don't know if you can comment on, but from an AI perspective and from a math problem

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:24.140
 perspective, what do you think is intelligence? What do you think is the thing that allows

1:23:24.140 --> 1:23:29.980
 us to solve that problem? And how hard is it to build a machine to do that, asking for

1:23:29.980 --> 1:23:35.260
 a friend? Yeah. So I guess you see, because if I just think of the raw search space, it's

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:39.300
 huge. That's why you can't do it. And if I think about what makes somebody good at doing

1:23:39.300 --> 1:23:44.500
 these things, they have this heuristic sense. It's almost like a good chess player of saying,

1:23:44.500 --> 1:23:47.900
 let's not keep analyzing down this way because there's some heuristic reason why that's a

1:23:47.900 --> 1:23:53.180
 bad way to go. Where did they get that heuristic from? Now that's a good question. I don't know.

1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:58.100
 Because if you asked them to explain to you, they could probably say something in words

1:23:58.100 --> 1:24:02.060
 that sounds like it makes sense. But I'm guessing that's only a part of what's really going

1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:06.420
 on in their brain of evaluating that position. You know what I mean? If you ask Gary Kasparov,

1:24:06.420 --> 1:24:11.300
 what is good or why is this position good? He will say something. But it's probably not

1:24:11.300 --> 1:24:17.060
 approximating everything that's going on inside. So there's basically a function being computed.

1:24:17.060 --> 1:24:20.900
 But it's hard to articulate what that function is. Now the question is, could a computer

1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:26.580
 get as good at computing these kinds of heuristic functions? Maybe. I'm not enough of an expert

1:24:26.580 --> 1:24:31.180
 to understand. But one bit of me has always been a little bit curious of whether or not

1:24:31.180 --> 1:24:36.260
 the human brain has a particular tendency due to its wiring to come up with certain kinds

1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:42.420
 of things, which is just natural due to the way that the topology of the neurons and whatever

1:24:42.420 --> 1:24:47.540
 is there, for which if you tried to just build from scratch a computer to do it, would it

1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:51.700
 naturally have different tendencies? I don't know. And this is just me being completely

1:24:51.700 --> 1:24:55.700
 ignorant and just saying a few ideas. Well, this is a good thing that mathematics

1:24:55.700 --> 1:25:01.420
 shows is we don't have to be. So math and physics or mathematical physics operates in

1:25:01.420 --> 1:25:09.340
 a world that's different than our descendant of a brain's operating. So it allows us to

1:25:09.340 --> 1:25:16.580
 have multiple, many, many dimensions. It allows us to work on weird surfaces with topology

1:25:16.580 --> 1:25:22.100
 as a discipline. It's just weird to me. It's really complicated. But it allows us to work

1:25:22.100 --> 1:25:27.300
 in that space or the differential geometry and all those kinds of things where it's totally

1:25:27.300 --> 1:25:34.660
 outside of our natural day to day four dimensional experience, three D dimensional with time

1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:48.260
 experience. So math gives me hope that we can discover the processes of intelligence outside

1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:56.140
 the limited nature of our own human experiences. But you said that you're not an expert. It's

1:25:56.140 --> 1:26:05.260
 kind of funny. I find that we know so little about intelligence that I think I honestly

1:26:05.260 --> 1:26:11.060
 think like almost children are more expert at creating artificial intelligence systems

1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:18.380
 than adults. I feel like we know so little, we really need to think outside the box. And

1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:25.380
 those little I found people should check out Francois Chollet's little exams. But I even

1:26:25.380 --> 1:26:31.700
 just solving math problems. I don't know if you've ever done this for yourself. But when

1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:38.460
 you solve a math problem, you kind of then trace back and try to figure out where did

1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:46.660
 that idea come from? Like what was I visualizing in my head? How did I start visualizing it

1:26:46.660 --> 1:26:53.020
 that way? Why did I start rotating that cube in my head in that way? Like what is that

1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:59.100
 if I were to try to build a program that does that? Where did that come from? This is interesting.

1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:04.660
 So I try to do this to teach middle school students how to learn how to create and think

1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:09.500
 and invent. And the way I do it is there are these math competition problems. And I'm working

1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:14.380
 in collaboration with the people who run those. And I will turn on my YouTube live. And for

1:27:14.380 --> 1:27:19.740
 the first time, look at those questions and live solve them. The reason I do this is to

1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:23.180
 let the middle school students and the high school students and the adults and whoever

1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:28.620
 wants to watch just see what exactly goes on through someone's head as they go and attempt

1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:34.540
 to invent what they need to do to solve the question. So I've actually thought about that.

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:39.380
 I think that first of all, as a teacher, I think about that because whenever I want to

1:27:39.380 --> 1:27:44.340
 explain to a student how to do something, I want to explain how it made sense, why it's

1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:49.660
 intuitive to do the following things and why the wrong things are wrong. Not just why this

1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:55.300
 one short, fast way, why this is the right way, if that makes sense. So my point is I'm

1:27:55.300 --> 1:27:59.540
 actually always thinking about that. How would you think about these things? And then I eventually

1:27:59.540 --> 1:28:05.100
 decided the easiest way to expose this would just be to go live on YouTube and just say,

1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:07.940
 I've never seen any of these questions before. Here we go.

1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:16.060
 Don't you get, that's anxiety inducing for me. Don't you get trapped in a kind of like

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:20.260
 little dead ends of confusion, even on middle school problems?

1:28:20.260 --> 1:28:23.660
 Yes, that's what the comments are for. The live comments come in as students, they try

1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:24.660
 this.

1:28:24.660 --> 1:28:25.660
 Oh, wow.

1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:26.660
 It's actually pretty good.

1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:31.100
 I'll never get stuck. I mean, I'm willing to go on camera and say, guess what? Potion

1:28:31.100 --> 1:28:35.900
 low can't do this. That's fine. But then what ends up happening is you will then see how

1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:39.820
 maybe somebody's saying something and I look at the chat and I say, aha, that actually

1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:45.340
 looks useful. Now that also shows how not all ideas, not all suggestions are the same

1:28:45.340 --> 1:28:48.820
 power. If that makes sense, because if I actually do get stuck, I'll go fishing through the

1:28:48.820 --> 1:28:49.820
 chat.

1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:57.580
 I don't know if you can speak to this, but is there a moment for the middle school students,

1:28:57.580 --> 1:29:05.740
 maybe high school as well, where there's like a turning point for them where they maybe

1:29:05.740 --> 1:29:12.780
 fall in love with mathematics or they get it? Is there something to be said about like

1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:19.220
 discovering that moment and trying to grab them to get them to understand that mathematics

1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:23.100
 is something, no matter what they want to do in life, could be part of their life?

1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:27.260
 Yes. I actually do think that the middle school is exactly the right time because that's

1:29:27.260 --> 1:29:32.860
 the place where your mathematical understanding gets just sophisticated enough that you can

1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:38.300
 start doing interesting things. Because if you're early on and counting, I'm honestly

1:29:38.300 --> 1:29:42.300
 not very good at teaching you new insights. My wife is pretty good at that, but if it's

1:29:42.300 --> 1:29:47.980
 somehow, once you get to this part where you know what a fraction is and when you know

1:29:47.980 --> 1:29:52.780
 how to add and how to multiply and what the area of a triangle is, at that point to me,

1:29:52.780 --> 1:29:57.460
 the whole world opens up and you can start observing there are really nifty coincidences,

1:29:57.460 --> 1:30:02.500
 the things that made the Greek mathematicians and the ancient mathematicians excited. Actually,

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:08.020
 back then, it was exciting to discover the pentagram here. It wasn't just homework.

1:30:08.020 --> 1:30:16.420
 So, which discipline do you think has the most exciting coincidences? Is it geometry?

1:30:16.420 --> 1:30:21.220
 Is it algebra? Is it calculus?

1:30:21.220 --> 1:30:25.340
 Well, you see, you're asking me and I'm the guy who gets the most excited when the

1:30:25.340 --> 1:30:28.700
 combinatorics shows up in the geometry.

1:30:28.700 --> 1:30:35.380
 Okay. So, it's the combinatorics in the geometry. So, first of all, the nice thing about geometry,

1:30:35.380 --> 1:30:41.100
 the same nice thing about computer vision is it's visual. So, geometry, you can draw

1:30:41.100 --> 1:30:49.460
 circles and triangles and stuff. So, it naturally presents itself to the visual proof, right?

1:30:49.460 --> 1:30:56.980
 But also, the nice thing about geometry, I think for me is the earliest class, the earliest

1:30:56.980 --> 1:31:05.060
 discipline where there's, that's most amenable to the exploration, the invention, the proofs.

1:31:05.060 --> 1:31:10.420
 The idea of proofs, I think, is most easily shown in geometry because it's so visual,

1:31:10.420 --> 1:31:16.580
 I guess. So, that to me is like, if I were to think about when I first fell in love with

1:31:16.580 --> 1:31:23.140
 math, it would be geometry. And sadly enough, that's not used. Geometry only has a little

1:31:23.140 --> 1:31:31.620
 appears briefly in the journey of a student and it kind of disappears. And not until much

1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:38.060
 later, which there may be differential geometry. I don't know where else it shows up. For me,

1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:44.100
 in computer science, you could start to think about computational geometry or even graph

1:31:44.100 --> 1:31:47.500
 theories, the kind of geometry. You could start to think about it visually, although

1:31:47.500 --> 1:31:54.100
 it's pretty tricky. But yeah, that was the most beautiful one. Everything else, I guess

1:31:54.100 --> 1:32:01.580
 calculus can be kind of visual too. That could be pretty beautiful. But is there something

1:32:01.580 --> 1:32:09.980
 you try to look for in the student to see, like, how can I inspire them at this moment?

1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:13.660
 Or is this like individual student to student? Is there something you could say there?

1:32:13.660 --> 1:32:18.180
 So, first of all, I really think that every student can pick up all of this skill. I really

1:32:18.180 --> 1:32:22.260
 do think so. I don't think it's something only for a few. And so, if I'm looking for

1:32:22.260 --> 1:32:28.540
 a student, actually, oftentimes, if I'm looking at a particular student, the question is,

1:32:28.540 --> 1:32:33.700
 how can we help you feel like you have the power to invent also? Because I think a lot

1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:37.100
 of people are used to thinking about math as something where the teacher will show you

1:32:37.100 --> 1:32:41.660
 what to do, and then you will do it. So, I think that the key is to show that they have

1:32:41.660 --> 1:32:45.860
 some, let them see that they have some power to invent. And at that point, it's often starting

1:32:45.860 --> 1:32:49.780
 by trying to give a question that they don't know how to do. You want to find these questions

1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:54.620
 that they don't know how to do that they can think about, and then they can solve. And

1:32:54.620 --> 1:32:59.140
 then suddenly, they say, my gosh, I've had a situation. I've had an experience where

1:32:59.140 --> 1:33:03.460
 I didn't know what to do. And after a while, I did.

1:33:03.460 --> 1:33:10.860
 Is there advice you can give on how to learn math for people, whether it's middle school,

1:33:10.860 --> 1:33:19.300
 whether it's somebody as an adult kind of gave up on math maybe early on?

1:33:19.300 --> 1:33:22.940
 I actually think that these math competition problems, middle school and high school are

1:33:22.940 --> 1:33:28.260
 really good. They're actually very hard. So, if you haven't had this kind of experience

1:33:28.260 --> 1:33:34.380
 before and you grab a middle school math competition problem from the state level, which is used

1:33:34.380 --> 1:33:39.260
 to decide who represents the state in the country, in the United States, for example,

1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:44.740
 those are pretty tricky. And even if you are a professional, maybe not doing mathematical

1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:49.460
 things and you're not a middle school student, you'll struggle. So, I find that these things

1:33:49.460 --> 1:33:53.180
 really do teach you things by trying to work on these questions.

1:33:53.180 --> 1:33:59.380
 Is there a Googleable term that you can use for the organization, for the state competitions?

1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:03.980
 Ah, yeah. So, there are a number of different ones that are quite popular. One of them is

1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:09.460
 called math counts, M A T H C O U N T S. And that's a big tournament which actually has

1:34:09.460 --> 1:34:17.300
 a state level. There's also a mathleague.org, mathleague.org also has this kind of tiered

1:34:17.300 --> 1:34:23.620
 tournament structure. There's also the American math competitions, A M C 8. A M C also has

1:34:23.620 --> 1:34:28.580
 A M C 10. That's for 10th grade and below and A M C 12. These are all run by the Mathematical

1:34:28.580 --> 1:34:33.020
 Association of America. And these are always defined old questions.

1:34:33.020 --> 1:34:36.100
 What about the daily challenges that you run? What are those about?

1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:41.300
 We do that too. But I mean, the difference was that one's not free. I should actually

1:34:41.300 --> 1:34:44.500
 probably be careful. The things that I've just mentioned are also not free. Not all

1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:47.020
 of those things I mentioned just now are free either.

1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:50.620
 People can figure out what is free and what's not. But this is really nice to know what's

1:34:50.620 --> 1:34:53.740
 out there. But can you speak a little bit to the daily challenges?

1:34:53.740 --> 1:34:59.500
 Sure, sure. So, that's actually what we did when I guess I was thinking about how would

1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:04.500
 I try to develop that skill in people if we had the power to architect the entire system

1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:09.020
 ourselves. So, that's called the daily challenge with push and low. It's not free because that's

1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:14.380
 actually how I pay for everything else I do. So, that was the idea. But the concept was,

1:35:14.380 --> 1:35:18.180
 aha, now let's invent from scratch. So, if we're going to go from scratch and we're

1:35:18.180 --> 1:35:24.740
 going to use technology, what if we made every single lesson or something where first I say,

1:35:24.740 --> 1:35:27.460
 hey, here's an interesting question. Record it, of course. It's not live. But it's like,

1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:30.140
 I say, hey, here's an interesting question. Why don't we think about this? But I know

1:35:30.140 --> 1:35:34.380
 you don't know how to do it. So, now you think. And a minute later, a hint pops on

1:35:34.380 --> 1:35:38.620
 the screen. But you still think. And a minute later, a big hint pops on the screen. And

1:35:38.620 --> 1:35:42.660
 you still think. And then finally, after the three minutes, hopefully you got some ideas,

1:35:42.660 --> 1:35:47.940
 you try to answer. And then suddenly, there's like this pretty extended explanation of, oh,

1:35:47.940 --> 1:35:52.460
 yeah, so here's like multiple different ways that you can do the question. And by accident,

1:35:52.460 --> 1:35:55.580
 you also just learned this other concept. That's what we did.

1:35:55.580 --> 1:35:59.580
 Is this targeted towards middle school students, high school students?

1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:03.220
 It's targeted towards middle school students with competitions. But there's a lot of high

1:36:03.220 --> 1:36:07.060
 school students who didn't do competitions in middle school, where they would also learn

1:36:07.060 --> 1:36:11.860
 how to think. If you can see the whole concept was, can we teach people how to think? How

1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:16.740
 would you do that? You need to give people the chance to, on their own, invent without

1:36:16.740 --> 1:36:20.540
 that kid in the front row answering every question in two seconds.

1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:24.180
 And people can find it, I think, with daily.

1:36:24.180 --> 1:36:29.420
 It's daily.potionlow.com. But if you go to find my website, you'll be able to find it.

1:36:29.420 --> 1:36:36.380
 Wonderful. Can we zoom out a little bit? And so day to day, week to week, month to month,

1:36:36.380 --> 1:36:45.340
 year to year, what does the lifelong educational process look like, do you think? For yourself,

1:36:45.340 --> 1:36:51.300
 but for me, what would you recommend in the world of mathematics or sort of as opposed

1:36:51.300 --> 1:37:02.060
 to studying for a test, but just like lifelong expanding of knowledge in that skill for invention?

1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:08.660
 I think I often articulate this as, can you always try to do more than you could do in

1:37:08.660 --> 1:37:10.660
 the past?

1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:11.660
 Yeah.

1:37:11.660 --> 1:37:16.660
 But that comes in many ways. And I will say it's great if one wants to build that with

1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:21.700
 mathematics, but it's also great to use that philosophy with all other things. In fact,

1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:26.380
 if I just think of myself, I just think, what do I know now that I didn't know a year ago

1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:30.740
 or a month ago or a week ago? And not just know, but what do I have the capability of

1:37:30.740 --> 1:37:31.740
 doing?

1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:32.740
 Yes.

1:37:32.740 --> 1:37:34.580
 And if you just have that attitude, it brings more.

1:37:34.580 --> 1:37:43.100
 See, the thing is, there's also a habit. It is a skill. I've been using Anki. It's

1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:51.100
 an app for helps you memorize things. And I've actually, this a few months ago, started

1:37:51.100 --> 1:38:00.100
 doing this daily of setting aside time to think about an idea that's outside of my work.

1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:06.380
 Like let's say it's all over the place, by the way, but let's say politics, like gun

1:38:06.380 --> 1:38:13.460
 control. Is it good to have a lot of guns or not in society? And just, I've set aside

1:38:13.460 --> 1:38:18.860
 time every day. I do at least 10 minutes, but I try to do 30 where I think about a problem.

1:38:18.860 --> 1:38:22.740
 And I kind of outlined for myself from scratch, from not looking anything up, just thinking

1:38:22.740 --> 1:38:29.180
 about it, using common sense. And I think the practice of that is really important.

1:38:29.180 --> 1:38:35.500
 It's the daily routine of it. It's the discipline of it. It's not just that I figured something

1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:43.100
 out from that, thinking about gun control. It's more that, that muscle is built too.

1:38:43.100 --> 1:38:49.780
 It's that thinking muscle. So I'm kind of interested in, you know, math has, because

1:38:49.780 --> 1:38:54.260
 especially because I've gotten specialized into machine learning and because I love programming

1:38:54.260 --> 1:39:02.460
 so much. I've lost touch with math a little bit to where I feel quite sad about it and

1:39:02.460 --> 1:39:08.260
 I want to fix that. Even just not math, like pure knowledge math, but math, like these

1:39:08.260 --> 1:39:14.860
 middle school problems, the challenges, right? Is that something you see a person be able

1:39:14.860 --> 1:39:19.660
 to do every single day, kind of just practice every single day for years?

1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:23.460
 So I can give an answer to that. That gives a practical way you could do it. Assuming

1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:27.060
 you have kids. So you can do it yourself.

1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:28.060
 Step one, get kids.

1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:32.780
 I'm just saying this because I'm just thinking out loud right now. What could I do? What

1:39:32.780 --> 1:39:36.420
 could I do to suggest? Because what I have noticed is that, for example, if you do have

1:39:36.420 --> 1:39:41.460
 kids who are in elementary school or middle school, if you yourself go and look at those

1:39:41.460 --> 1:39:45.900
 middle school math problems to think about interesting ways that you can teach your elementary

1:39:45.900 --> 1:39:49.900
 school or middle school kid, it works. That's what my wife did. She never did any of those

1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:54.100
 contests before, but now she knows quite a lot about them. I didn't teach her anything.

1:39:54.100 --> 1:39:59.740
 I don't do that. She just was messing around with them and taught herself all of that stuff.

1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:03.500
 And that had the automatic daily. I'm always thinking, how do you make it practical, right?

1:40:03.500 --> 1:40:04.500
 Yes.

1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:08.180
 And the way to make it practical is if the timer on the automatically daily is that you

1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:10.860
 were going to automatically daily do something with your own kids.

1:40:10.860 --> 1:40:11.860
 Yes.

1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:13.500
 Now it feeds back. Okay.

1:40:13.500 --> 1:40:16.500
 And that includes the whole lesson that if you want to learn something, you should teach

1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:17.500
 it.

1:40:17.500 --> 1:40:18.500
 Oh, I strongly believe that.

1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:19.500
 Yes.

1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:21.860
 I strongly believe that.

1:40:21.860 --> 1:40:27.220
 So I currently don't have kids. Maybe I should just get kids to help me with the math thing.

1:40:27.220 --> 1:40:32.740
 But outside of that, I do want to integrate math into daily practice. So I'll definitely

1:40:32.740 --> 1:40:39.380
 take out, I'll definitely check out the daily challenges and see, because what is it? Grant

1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:44.980
 Sanderson, we talked about offline, the three blue and one brown. He speaks to this as well,

1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:50.540
 that his videos aren't necessarily, they don't speak to the thing that I'm referring to,

1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:57.940
 which is the daily practice. They're more almost tools of inspiration. They kind of show you

1:40:57.940 --> 1:41:07.220
 the beauty of a particular problem in mathematics, but they're not a daily ritual. And I'm in

1:41:07.220 --> 1:41:16.820
 search of that daily ritual mathematics. It's not trivial to find. But I hope to find that

1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:24.060
 because I think math gives you a perspective on the world that enriches everything else.

1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:27.940
 So I'd like what you said about the daily also, because that's also one reason why I

1:41:27.940 --> 1:41:32.300
 put my Carnegie Mellon class online. It's not every day. It's every other day. Semester

1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:36.900
 is almost over. But the idea was, I guess my philosophy was if I'm already doing the

1:41:36.900 --> 1:41:41.340
 class, let's just put it there, right? But I do know that there are people who have been

1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:46.180
 following it, who are not in my class at all, who have just been following it because, yes,

1:41:46.180 --> 1:41:51.740
 it's combinatorics. And the value of that is you don't really need to know calculus to follow it,

1:41:51.740 --> 1:41:55.580
 if that makes sense. So it's actually something that people could follow. So again, that one's

1:41:55.580 --> 1:42:02.860
 free. So that one's just there on YouTube. Well, speaking of combinatorics, what is it? What do

1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:08.860
 you find interesting? What do you find beautiful about combinatorics? So combinatorics, to me,

1:42:08.860 --> 1:42:18.020
 is the study of things where they might be more finite and more discrete. What I mean is like

1:42:18.020 --> 1:42:21.700
 if I look at a network, actually, a lot of times the combinatorics will boil down to something,

1:42:21.700 --> 1:42:25.700
 and the combinatorics I think about might be something related to graphs or networks. And

1:42:25.700 --> 1:42:32.740
 they're very discrete because if you have a node, it's not that you have 0.7 of a node and 0.3

1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:36.900
 of a node over there. It's that you got one node and then you jump one step to go to the next node.

1:42:36.900 --> 1:42:42.740
 So that notion is different from, say, calculus, which is very continuous, where you go and say,

1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:47.620
 I have this speed which is changing over time. And now what's the distance I've traveled?

1:42:47.620 --> 1:42:51.180
 That's the notion of an integral, where you have to think of subdividing time into very,

1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:57.300
 very small pieces. So the kinds of things that you do when you reason about these finite,

1:42:57.300 --> 1:43:04.220
 discrete structures often might be iterative, algorithmic, inductive. These are ideas where

1:43:04.220 --> 1:43:10.060
 I go from one step to the next step and so on and make progress. I guess I actually personally

1:43:10.060 --> 1:43:15.460
 like all kinds of math. My area of research just ended up in here because I met a really

1:43:15.460 --> 1:43:21.020
 interesting PhD advisor. That's honestly the reason I went into that direction. I met a really

1:43:21.020 --> 1:43:25.740
 interesting guy. He seemed like he did good stuff, interesting stuff, and he looked like he cared

1:43:25.740 --> 1:43:31.140
 about students. And I said, let me just go and learn whatever you do, even though my prior practice

1:43:31.140 --> 1:43:36.060
 and preparation before my PhD was not combinatorics, but analysis, the continuous stuff.

1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:44.660
 So the annoying thing about combinatorics and discrete stuff is it's often really

1:43:44.660 --> 1:43:54.980
 difficult to solve from a sort of running time complexity perspective. Could you speak to the

1:43:54.980 --> 1:44:06.460
 idea of complexity analysis of problems? Do you find it useful? Do you find that lens of

1:44:06.460 --> 1:44:14.500
 studying the difficulty of how difficult the computer science problem is, a useful lens onto

1:44:14.500 --> 1:44:20.980
 the world? Oh, very much so. Because if you want to make something practical, which has large

1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:27.940
 numbers of people using it, the computational complexity to me is almost question one. Again,

1:44:27.940 --> 1:44:32.180
 that's at the origin of when we started doing this stuff with disease control. From the very

1:44:32.180 --> 1:44:36.580
 beginning, the deep questions that were running through my mind were, would we be able to support

1:44:36.580 --> 1:44:44.020
 a large population with only one server? And if the answer is no, we can't start because I don't

1:44:44.020 --> 1:44:56.340
 have enough money. Yeah, and there the question is very much linear time versus anything slower

1:44:56.340 --> 1:45:01.540
 than linear time. As a very specific thing, you have a bunch of really interesting papers. If I

1:45:01.540 --> 1:45:06.980
 could ask, maybe we could pull out some cool insights at the high level. Can you describe the

1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:12.100
 data structure of a voting tree and what are some interesting results on it? You have a paper

1:45:12.100 --> 1:45:20.340
 that I noticed on it. Yeah. So this is an example of, I guess, how in math, we might say here's an

1:45:20.340 --> 1:45:26.020
 interesting kind of a question that we just can't seem to understand enough about. Maybe there's

1:45:26.020 --> 1:45:31.620
 something else going on here. And the way to describe this is you could imagine trying to hold

1:45:31.620 --> 1:45:36.580
 elections where if you have only two candidates, that's kind of easy. You just run them against

1:45:36.580 --> 1:45:40.580
 each other and see who gets more votes. But as you know, once you have more candidates,

1:45:40.580 --> 1:45:44.980
 it's very difficult to decide who wins the election. And there's an entire voting theory

1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:54.500
 around this. So a theoretical question became, what if you made a system of runoffs, a system of

1:45:55.380 --> 1:46:00.820
 head to head contests, which you structure like a tree almost looking like a circuit. I'm using

1:46:00.820 --> 1:46:05.540
 that way of thinking because it's sort of like an electrical engineering or computer science.

1:46:05.540 --> 1:46:10.420
 You might imagine having a bunch of leads that carry signal, which are going through AND gates

1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:15.060
 and OR gates and whatnot. And you manage to compute beautiful things. This is just from a purely

1:46:15.060 --> 1:46:20.100
 abstract point of view. What if the inputs are candidates? And for every two candidates,

1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:24.340
 it is known which of the candidates is more popular than the other. Now can you build

1:46:24.340 --> 1:46:29.300
 some kind of a circuit board, which says, first, candidate number four will play against five

1:46:29.300 --> 1:46:35.140
 and see who wins and so on. Okay. So now what would be a nice outcome? Right? This is a general

1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:39.940
 question of, could I make a big circuit board to feed an election into like maybe one nice

1:46:39.940 --> 1:46:45.860
 outcome would be whoever wins at least is preferred over a lot of people. Yes. So for example,

1:46:45.860 --> 1:46:52.580
 if you ran in 1024 candidates, ideally we would like a guarantee that says that the winner beats

1:46:52.580 --> 1:46:59.700
 a lot of people. Actually, in any system where there are 1024 candidates, there's always a candidate

1:46:59.700 --> 1:47:05.220
 who beats at least 512 of the others. This is a mathematical fact that there's actually always

1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:12.340
 a person who beats at least half of the other people. I'm trying to make sense of that mathematical

1:47:12.340 --> 1:47:18.900
 fact. Is this supposed to be obvious? No, but I can explain it. No, I can't. The way it works is that

1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:25.220
 think of it this way. Every time, I think, imagine I have all these candidates and everyone is

1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:30.100
 competing, is everyone is like compared with everyone else at some point. Well, think of it

1:47:30.100 --> 1:47:35.780
 this way. Whenever there's a comparison, somebody gets a point. That's the one who is better than

1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:42.020
 the other one. My claim is there's somebody whose score is at least half of how many other people

1:47:42.020 --> 1:47:47.460
 there are. Yeah, I'm just trying to, like my intuition is very close to that being true,

1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:54.820
 but it's beautiful. I didn't at first, that's not an obvious fact. No, it's not. It feels like a

1:47:54.820 --> 1:48:01.460
 beautiful fact. Well, let me explain it this way. Imagine that for every match, you didn't give one

1:48:01.460 --> 1:48:06.740
 point, but you gave two points. You gave one point to each person. Now, that's not what we're really

1:48:06.740 --> 1:48:11.700
 doing. We really want to give one point to the winner of the match, but instead we'll just give

1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:17.060
 two. If you gave two points to everyone on every matchup, actually everyone has the same number

1:48:17.060 --> 1:48:22.900
 of points, and the number of points they get is how many other people there are. Does that sort

1:48:22.900 --> 1:48:26.100
 of make sense? I'm just like saying that's clear. No, everything you say makes perfect sense.

1:48:26.100 --> 1:48:31.620
 Okay, so the point is if for every comparison between two people, which I'm doing for every

1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:36.740
 two people, I gave one point to each person, your score, everyone's score is the same. It's

1:48:36.740 --> 1:48:42.740
 how many other people there are. Now we only make one change. For each matchup, you give one point

1:48:42.740 --> 1:48:49.460
 only to the winner. So we're awarding half the points. So now the deal is if in the original

1:48:49.460 --> 1:48:55.380
 situation, everyone's score was equal, which is how many other people there are. Now there's only

1:48:55.380 --> 1:49:02.980
 half the number of points to go around. So what ends up happening is that the average

1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:06.980
 number of points per person is going to be half of how many other people there are,

1:49:06.980 --> 1:49:10.100
 and somebody is going to be above average. Somebody is going to be above that. At least

1:49:10.100 --> 1:49:14.740
 average. Yeah, this is this notion of expected value that if I have a random variable which has

1:49:14.740 --> 1:49:19.380
 an expected value, there's going to be some possibility in the probability space where

1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:23.620
 you're at least as big as the expected value. Yeah, when you describe it like that, it's obvious,

1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:28.580
 but when you are first saying in this little circuit that there's going to be one candidate

1:49:28.580 --> 1:49:37.940
 better than half, that's not obvious. Yeah, it's not. It's funny. Math, this is nice. Okay, so

1:49:37.940 --> 1:49:43.140
 you have this, but ultimately you want, you're trying to with a voting tree. I don't know if

1:49:43.140 --> 1:49:53.460
 you're trying this, but to have a circuit that's like compared to small, that achieves the same kind

1:49:53.460 --> 1:50:00.340
 of, I mean, the smaller it is, if we look at practically speaking, the lower the cost of

1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:05.060
 running the election, of running through, of computing the circuit. That is true, but actually

1:50:05.060 --> 1:50:12.740
 at this point, the reason the question was interesting is because there was no good guarantee

1:50:12.740 --> 1:50:19.620
 that the winner of that circuit would have beaten a lot of people. Let me give an example.

1:50:19.620 --> 1:50:23.220
 The best known circuit when we started thinking about this was the circuit called

1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:29.540
 candidate 1 plays against candidate 2, candidate 3 plays against 4, and then the winners play against

1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:34.420
 each other. And then by the way, 5 plays against 6, 7 against 8, the winners play against each

1:50:34.420 --> 1:50:38.580
 other. You understand, it's like a giant binary tree. Yeah, it's a binary, like a balanced binary

1:50:38.580 --> 1:50:43.700
 tree. It's a balanced binary tree. One, two, three, four, up to 1024, everyone going up to find the

1:50:43.700 --> 1:50:49.620
 winner. Beautiful. Well, you know what? There's a system in the world where it could just be

1:50:49.620 --> 1:50:54.980
 that there's a candidate called number one that just beats like 10 other people,

1:50:56.340 --> 1:51:00.900
 just the 10 that they need to be on their way up, and they lose to everyone else.

1:51:00.900 --> 1:51:09.140
 But somehow they would get all the way up. Yes. My point is it is possible to outsmart that

1:51:09.700 --> 1:51:16.100
 circuit in one weird way of the world, which makes that circuit a bad one, because you want to say,

1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:22.340
 I will use this circuit for all elections. And you might have a system of inputs that go in there

1:51:22.340 --> 1:51:26.580
 where the winner only beat 10 other people, which is the people they had to beat on their way up.

1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:33.060
 So you want to have a circuit where there's as many, like the final result is as strong as possible?

1:51:33.060 --> 1:51:40.740
 Yes. And now what ideas do you have for that? So we actually only managed to improve it to square

1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:46.660
 root of n. So if n is the number of vertices, n over 2 would be the ideal. We got it to n,

1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:54.740
 we got it to square root of n. Versus log of n. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Which is halfway. It could be a

1:51:54.740 --> 1:52:00.820
 lot. Yeah. It could be a big improvement. So that's okay, cool. Is there something you can say

1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:06.500
 with words about what kind of circuit what that looks like? I can give an idea of one of the

1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:11.780
 tools inside. Yeah. But the actual execution ends up being more complicated. But one of the widgets

1:52:11.780 --> 1:52:19.220
 inside this is building a system where you have like a candidate who plays like one part of the

1:52:19.220 --> 1:52:25.380
 whole huge, huge tree is that same candidate. Let's call them seven. Seven plays against somebody.

1:52:25.380 --> 1:52:28.980
 Let's make up some numbers. Let's call the others like letters. So seven plays against A.

1:52:30.660 --> 1:52:35.220
 Seven's also going to play against B separately. And the winners of each of those who play each

1:52:35.220 --> 1:52:40.100
 other. By the way, seven's also going to play C. Seven's going to play D. And the winners are

1:52:40.100 --> 1:52:43.620
 going to play each other. And the winners are going to play each other. We call this seven

1:52:43.620 --> 1:52:49.540
 against all. Well, seven against like everyone from a bunch of... Got it. So there's some nice overlap

1:52:49.540 --> 1:52:53.700
 between the matchups that somehow has a nice feature to it. Yes. And I can tell you the

1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:57.780
 nice feature because if at the base of this giant tree, at the base of this giant circuit,

1:52:57.780 --> 1:53:01.300
 like this is a widget, we build the things out of widgets. So I'm just describing one widget.

1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:05.780
 But in the base of this widget, you have lots of things which are seven against someone, seven

1:53:05.780 --> 1:53:10.420
 against someone, seven against someone. In fact, every matchup at the bottom is seven against

1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:18.180
 someone. What that means is if seven actually beat everyone they were matched up against,

1:53:18.180 --> 1:53:23.300
 well, seven would rise to the top. So one possibility is if you see a seven emerge from

1:53:23.300 --> 1:53:28.020
 the top, you know that seven actually beat everyone they were against. On the other hand,

1:53:28.020 --> 1:53:34.260
 if anyone else is on top, let's call it F. If F is on top, how did F get there? Well, F beat seven

1:53:34.260 --> 1:53:40.020
 on the way at the beginning. So the point is the outcome of this circuit has a certain property.

1:53:40.020 --> 1:53:44.260
 If you see a seven, you know that the seven actually beat a bazillion people. If you see

1:53:44.260 --> 1:53:49.060
 anyone else, at least you know they beat seven. Yeah. Then you can prove that it has a nice

1:53:49.060 --> 1:53:55.220
 property. That's really interesting. Is there something you can say perhaps going completely

1:53:55.220 --> 1:54:04.820
 outside of what we're talking about is how we may have mathematical ideas of improving the

1:54:04.820 --> 1:54:17.300
 electoral process? No, I can't give you that one. Do you see there being a lot of opportunities

1:54:17.300 --> 1:54:24.980
 for improving how we vote? I don't know if you saw parallels, but you know,

1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:30.260
 it seems like this actually kind of maps to your sort of COVID work, which is there's a

1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:35.620
 network effect. It seems like we should be able to apply similar kind of effects of

1:54:36.420 --> 1:54:43.060
 how we decide other things in our lives. One of the big decisions we'll make is who represents

1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:48.020
 us in government. Do you ever think about mathematically about those kinds of systems?

1:54:48.020 --> 1:54:52.580
 I think a little bit about those because where I went to college, the way we voted for student

1:54:52.580 --> 1:54:58.740
 government was based on this, is it called ranked choice where you eliminate the bottom and there

1:54:58.740 --> 1:55:04.340
 runoff elections. That was the first time I ever saw that and I thought that made sense.

1:55:04.340 --> 1:55:08.820
 The only problem is it doesn't seem so easy to get something that makes sense adopted as a new

1:55:08.820 --> 1:55:15.140
 voting system. That's a whole nother. That's not a math solution. Well, it's math in the sense

1:55:15.140 --> 1:55:18.500
 that it's game theory. You have to come up with an incentive. It's mechanism design. You have to

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:26.420
 figure out how to trick us despite our basic human nature to adopt solutions that are better.

1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:32.420
 That's a whole nother conversation, I think. Can you just, because it sounded really cool,

1:55:33.140 --> 1:55:39.860
 talk a little bit about stochastic coalescence and you have a paper on showing that you could

1:55:39.860 --> 1:55:45.300
 describe what it is, but I guess it's super linear, super logarithmic time and you came

1:55:45.300 --> 1:55:49.220
 up with some kind of trick that make it faster. Can you just talk about it a little bit?

1:55:49.220 --> 1:55:53.620
 Yeah. This was something which came up when I was at Microsoft Research for a summer.

1:55:53.620 --> 1:55:59.300
 I'm putting that context because that shows that it has some practical motivation at some point.

1:56:00.900 --> 1:56:04.500
 Actually, I think it's still... It doesn't need to. It doesn't need to. It can be beautiful and

1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:08.980
 it's all right. Yeah, so the easiest way to describe this is, suppose you got a big crowd of

1:56:08.980 --> 1:56:13.780
 people and everybody knows how many hours of sleep they got last night and you want to know

1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:18.100
 how many total hours of sleep were gotten by this big crowd of people. At the beginning,

1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:22.340
 you might say, that sounds like a linear time algorithm of saying, hey, how many hours you

1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:27.140
 got? How many you got? How many you got? Add, add, add. But there's a way to do this if you

1:56:27.140 --> 1:56:31.380
 remember that there are people and they presumably know how to add. You could make a distributed

1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:36.580
 algorithm to make this happen. For example, while we're thinking of these trees, imagine you had

1:56:36.580 --> 1:56:42.660
 1,024 people. If you could just say, hey, person number one and person number two, you will add

1:56:42.660 --> 1:56:47.300
 your hours of sleep. Person number two will go away and person number one is going to remember

1:56:47.300 --> 1:56:53.940
 the sum. Person three and four add up and person three takes charge of remembering it. Person

1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:57.700
 four goes away. Now this person one knows the sum of these two. Person three knows the sum of

1:56:57.700 --> 1:57:02.660
 those two. They talk. You see what I mean? It's like you're going up this tree, same tree that

1:57:02.660 --> 1:57:07.060
 we talked about earlier. Built up a tree from the bottom up. Yeah, built up a tree from the bottom

1:57:07.060 --> 1:57:12.340
 up. And the beautiful thing is, since everyone's doing stuff in parallel, the amount of time it

1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:18.020
 takes to get the total sum is actually just the number of layers in the tree, which is 10.

1:57:18.820 --> 1:57:24.020
 So now that's logarithmic time to add up the number of hours that people slept today. Sounds

1:57:24.020 --> 1:57:28.740
 fantastic. There's only one problem. How do you decide who's person number one and person number two?

1:57:29.620 --> 1:57:33.940
 Yes. So if, for example, you just went out into downtown and said, hey, get these thousand people,

1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:37.620
 go. Well, if you're going to go and say, and by the way, you're one and you're two and you're three,

1:57:37.620 --> 1:57:42.260
 that's linear time. Yes. That's cheating. So now the question is how to do this in a distributed

1:57:42.260 --> 1:57:48.260
 way. And there were some people who proposed a very elegant algorithm, and they wanted to analyze it.

1:57:48.260 --> 1:57:53.060
 That's, so I came in onto the analyze side, but the elegant algorithm was like this. It was like,

1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:59.140
 well, we don't actually know what this big tree is. There isn't any big tree. So what's going to

1:57:59.140 --> 1:58:06.020
 happen is first, everyone is going to decide right now, oh, what one important thing, everyone is

1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:13.220
 going to, at the very beginning of the whole game, they will have delegated responsibility to themselves

1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:19.620
 as the one who knows the sum so far. So the point is there's going to be, people are all going to

1:58:19.620 --> 1:58:25.780
 have like a pointer, which says, you are the one who knows my, you've taken care of my ticket,

1:58:25.780 --> 1:58:30.740
 my number. Yeah. They select the representative for this particular piece of knowledge.

1:58:30.740 --> 1:58:34.740
 Right. And at the very beginning, you're your own representative. The thing has to start simple,

1:58:34.740 --> 1:58:39.300
 right? So the beginning of your own representative. You're pointing to yourself. Got it. Yep. And now

1:58:39.300 --> 1:58:44.980
 the way this works is that at every time step, someone blares a ding dong on the town clock or

1:58:44.980 --> 1:58:50.980
 whatever. And each person flips a coin themselves to decide, am I going to hunt for somebody to

1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:57.780
 give my number to and let them represent me? Or am I going to sit here and wait for someone

1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:04.500
 to come? Okay. Okay. Well, they flip their coin. Some of the people start asking other people,

1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:11.060
 saying, Hey, I'd like you to be my representative. Here is my number. But the problem is that there's

1:59:11.060 --> 1:59:14.900
 limited bandwidth of the people who are getting asked. It's like, you can't get, you can't go

1:59:14.900 --> 1:59:19.220
 out to prom with five people. That is not what we're doing. We're adding numbers. Okay. But you

1:59:19.220 --> 1:59:23.780
 can only add one number. So the person who has suddenly gotten asked by all these people,

1:59:23.780 --> 1:59:28.500
 well, they'll have to decide who they're going to take it from. And they randomly just choose one.

1:59:29.300 --> 1:59:33.620
 When they randomly choose one, all the others are rejected, and they don't get to delegate

1:59:33.620 --> 1:59:39.060
 anything in that round. But now if this person has absorbed this one who said, okay, here,

1:59:39.060 --> 1:59:43.700
 you take charge of my number, this person now updates their pointer, you're in charge.

1:59:44.660 --> 1:59:51.060
 And this person adds the two numbers. That was the first round. In the next round,

1:59:51.060 --> 1:59:55.300
 when they do the coin flipping, this person doesn't flip anymore because they're just delegating.

1:59:56.020 --> 2:00:01.860
 It's that anyone who has the pointers themselves, that's like a person who is in charge of some

2:00:01.860 --> 2:00:07.140
 number of informations, they flip the coin to decide, should I find other people who are agents?

2:00:08.100 --> 2:00:13.140
 Or should I wait for people to ask me? Yes. Brilliant. This is somebody else's idea. And

2:00:13.140 --> 2:00:17.620
 now the idea is, okay, if you just keep doing this process, what ends up happening? Oh, yeah.

2:00:17.620 --> 2:00:23.060
 Also, by the way, if you decide that you want to go reach out to other people, here's the catch.

2:00:23.060 --> 2:00:26.580
 When you're one of these agents saying, okay, I'm going to go look for someone,

2:00:26.580 --> 2:00:32.580
 you have no idea who in this crowd is an agent or somebody who delegated it to someone else.

2:00:32.580 --> 2:00:37.460
 You just pick a random person. When you pick the random person, if it lands on someone and

2:00:37.460 --> 2:00:44.580
 the person says, oh, I actually delegated it to someone, then you walk up the delegation chain.

2:00:44.580 --> 2:00:48.900
 Walk up delegation chain. And you can do like path compression in the algorithm to make it so

2:00:48.900 --> 2:00:54.100
 you don't consistently do lots of walking up. But the bottom line is that what ends up happening

2:00:54.100 --> 2:00:59.780
 is that you end up reaching out whenever you're one of the ones reaching out. You can think of it

2:00:59.780 --> 2:01:04.900
 as each agent is responsible for some number of people. It's almost like they're the leader of a

2:01:04.900 --> 2:01:12.420
 bunch. As the process is evolving, you have these lumps. Each lump has an agent. And when the agent

2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:18.260
 reaches out, they reach out to another lump, where the probability of them hitting that lump is

2:01:18.260 --> 2:01:26.420
 proportional to the size of the lump. That is the one funny thing about this process. This is not

2:01:26.420 --> 2:01:30.900
 that they can reach out to a uniformly random lump, where every lump has the same chance of

2:01:30.900 --> 2:01:36.580
 getting reached out to. The bigger the lump is, the less likely, the more likely it is

2:01:37.220 --> 2:01:41.540
 that you end up reaching that lump. Which is a problem. Let me explain why that's a problem.

2:01:41.540 --> 2:01:46.660
 Because you see, you're hoping that this has a small number of steps. But here's a bad situation

2:01:46.660 --> 2:01:52.740
 that could happen. Imagine if you had their end people that you're adding up. Imagine that you

2:01:52.740 --> 2:02:01.300
 have exactly square root of n lumps left, of which almost all of them are just one person

2:02:01.300 --> 2:02:06.820
 who's still their own boss, their own manager. Except one giant one. Now, what's going to happen

2:02:06.820 --> 2:02:10.900
 is going to be a huge bottleneck. Because every round, the giant one can only absorb one of the

2:02:10.900 --> 2:02:16.420
 others. And now you suddenly have time, which is about square root of n. The square root of n is

2:02:16.420 --> 2:02:23.140
 chosen because that is one where the lumps are such that you really are limited by this large

2:02:23.140 --> 2:02:28.740
 one slowly sucking up the rest of them. So the heart of the question became, well, but is that

2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:34.820
 just so unusual that it doesn't usually happen? Because remember, you start with everyone just

2:02:34.820 --> 2:02:39.540
 being independent. It's like a lot of lumps of size. How naturally do the big lumps emerge?

2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:44.020
 Yes. And so what that heart of the proof was, was showing that that was a joint work with

2:02:44.020 --> 2:02:50.180
 A. Lubecki, that one was showing that actually, in that thing, the lumps do kind of get out of

2:02:50.180 --> 2:02:55.940
 whack. And so it's not the purely logarithmic number of steps. But if you make one very slight

2:02:55.940 --> 2:03:02.740
 change, which is if you are one of the agents, and you have just been propositioned, possibly

2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:07.780
 relayed along by a couple of different people, if you just say, don't take a random one, but

2:03:07.780 --> 2:03:14.020
 accept the smallest lump. That actually does enough to even the whole thing up.

2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:18.900
 The distributes the lump size. I mean, yeah, it's fascinating how would the distributed algorithms

2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:24.660
 a little adjustment to make all the difference in the world? Yeah. Actually, by the way, this does

2:03:25.220 --> 2:03:30.740
 back to our voting conversation, this makes me think of like, these networking systems are so

2:03:30.740 --> 2:03:37.940
 fascinating to study, they immediately spring to mind ideas of how to have representation. Like, I

2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:47.060
 maybe as opposed to me voting for a president, I want to vote for, for like, for you to represent me,

2:03:48.260 --> 2:03:53.380
 maybe on a particular issue. And then you'll delegate that further. And then we naturally

2:03:53.380 --> 2:03:58.740
 construct those kinds of networks. Because that, that feels like I can have a good conversation

2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:02.100
 with you and figure out that you know what you're doing. And I could delegate it to you. And in

2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:09.220
 that way, construct a representative government or representative decision maker. That feels,

2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:14.820
 that feels really nice, as opposed to like us, like a tree of height one or something where it's

2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:21.780
 like everybody's just, it feels like there's a lot of room for layers of representation to form

2:04:21.780 --> 2:04:26.180
 organically from the bottom up. I wonder if there are systems like that. This is the cool thing about

2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:31.860
 the internet and the digital space where we're so well connected. Just like with the Novid app,

2:04:31.860 --> 2:04:37.940
 to distribute information about the spread of the disease, we can in the same way,

2:04:37.940 --> 2:04:46.500
 in a distributed sense, form anything like any kind of knowledge bases that are formed in a

2:04:46.500 --> 2:04:55.060
 decentralized way. And in a hierarchical way, as opposed to sort of old way where there's no

2:04:55.060 --> 2:05:02.100
 mechanism for large scale, fast, like distributed transactional information. This is really

2:05:02.100 --> 2:05:09.780
 interesting. This is where almost like network graph theory becomes practical. Most of that

2:05:09.780 --> 2:05:13.860
 exciting work was done in the 20th century, but most of the application will be in the 21st,

2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:18.820
 which is cool to think about. Let me ask the most ridiculous question. You think P equals NP?

2:05:18.820 --> 2:05:28.980
 Wow. I don't know. I mean, I would say, I know there are enough people who have very strong

2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:34.500
 interest in trying to show that it is. I'm talking about government agencies.

2:05:37.220 --> 2:05:41.060
 For security purposes. For security purposes. Yes. And most computer scientists would say,

2:05:41.060 --> 2:05:47.140
 believe that P equals NP. My question almost like, this is back to our aliens discussion. You want

2:05:47.140 --> 2:05:55.460
 to think outside the box, the low probability event, what is the world, what kind of discoveries would

2:05:55.460 --> 2:06:04.260
 lead us to prove that P does not equal to NP? There could be giant misunderstandings

2:06:05.380 --> 2:06:09.380
 or gaps in our knowledge about computer science, about theoretical computer science,

2:06:09.380 --> 2:06:14.020
 about computation, which allow us to think like flatten all problems.

2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:18.420
 Yeah. So I don't know the answer to this question. I think it's very interesting,

2:06:18.420 --> 2:06:23.060
 but actually I know, let's put it this way. By being at Carnegie Mellon and being around

2:06:23.060 --> 2:06:27.060
 the theoretical computer scientists, I know enough about what I don't know to say.

2:06:27.060 --> 2:06:30.740
 To be humble. I'm the wrong person to answer this question.

2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:36.820
 It's a great one. Well, Scott Aronson, who's now here at UT Austin, he used to be at MIT,

2:06:36.820 --> 2:06:47.300
 he puts the probability of P not equal to NP at 3%. I always love it when you ask,

2:06:47.940 --> 2:06:56.660
 it's very rare in science and academics because most folks are humble in the face of the mystery,

2:06:56.660 --> 2:07:01.860
 the uncertainty of everything around us. To have both the humor and the guts to say,

2:07:01.860 --> 2:07:08.580
 what are the chance that there's aliens in our galaxy, intelligent alien civilizations?

2:07:09.220 --> 2:07:12.580
 As opposed to saying, I don't know. It could be zero. It could be,

2:07:12.580 --> 2:07:19.380
 depending on the fact, you're saying it's 2.5%. There's something very pleasant about just having,

2:07:20.180 --> 2:07:26.580
 it's the number thing that's powered to the number. It's just like 42. It's like,

2:07:26.580 --> 2:07:30.500
 why 40? I don't know, but it's a powerful number. And then everything,

2:07:30.500 --> 2:07:34.340
 this is the power of the human psychology is once you have the number 42,

2:07:36.420 --> 2:07:43.780
 it's not that the number has meaning, but because it's placed in a book with humor around it,

2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:51.940
 it has the meme effect of actually creating reality. I mean, you could say that 42 has a

2:07:51.940 --> 2:07:58.580
 strong contribution of helping us colonize Mars because it created, it gave the whatever

2:07:58.580 --> 2:08:04.180
 existential crisis to many of us, including Elon Musk, when he was young, reading a book like that.

2:08:04.180 --> 2:08:09.140
 And then the now 42 is now part of his humor that he doesn't shut up about, it's constantly

2:08:09.140 --> 2:08:13.940
 joking about. And that humor is spreading through our minds. And somehow this like silly number

2:08:13.940 --> 2:08:20.580
 just had an effect. In that same way, after Scott told me the 3% chance, it's stuck in my head.

2:08:20.580 --> 2:08:26.500
 And I think it's been having a ripple effect on everybody else. The believing that P is not equal

2:08:26.500 --> 2:08:34.820
 to NP, Scott almost as a joke saying is 3%, is actually motivating a large number of researchers

2:08:34.820 --> 2:08:39.620
 to work on it. 3% is high. It's very high. Because for the potential impact that that would have.

2:08:41.140 --> 2:08:46.580
 But then 3% is not that high because it's only, you know, it's like, we're not very good. I feel

2:08:46.580 --> 2:08:53.220
 like humans are only able to really think about like 1%, 50%. And we kind of, I think a lot of

2:08:53.220 --> 2:09:03.140
 people around 3% up to 50%. Like in our minds, like 3%, this could happen. And it could happen.

2:09:03.140 --> 2:09:08.420
 And it's like, yeah, like half the time will probably happen. So we're not very good at that.

2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:14.500
 That's the other thing with the pandemic is we're not the exponential growth that we also talked

2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:22.500
 about offline is something that we can't quite into it. And that's something we probably should,

2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:27.780
 if we're to predict the future, to anticipate the future and to understand how to create technologies

2:09:27.780 --> 2:09:34.100
 that let us sort of control the future. Can I ask you for some recommendations,

2:09:34.900 --> 2:09:43.220
 maybe for books or movies in your life long ago, when you were Baby Poe or today,

2:09:45.300 --> 2:09:51.380
 that you found insightful or you learned a lot from it, you would recommend others?

2:09:51.380 --> 2:09:57.940
 Yeah. So I think, I don't necessarily have an exact name of these old things, but I was generally

2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:07.380
 inspired by stories true or fictional of campaigns. Like for example, like the Lord of the Rings,

2:10:07.380 --> 2:10:13.780
 that's a campaign, right? But the thing that always inspired me was it could be possible

2:10:13.780 --> 2:10:19.780
 for somebody who's crazy enough to go up against adversity, after adversity, after adversity,

2:10:19.780 --> 2:10:24.900
 and it succeeds. I mean, those are false. Those are fictitious. But I also spent a lot of time,

2:10:24.900 --> 2:10:29.140
 I guess, reading about, I don't know, I was interested somehow in like World War II history,

2:10:29.140 --> 2:10:33.300
 for whatever reason. That's a campaign which is much more brutal. But nevertheless,

2:10:34.100 --> 2:10:41.220
 the idea of difficulty, strategy, fighting, even when things, in that case, it was really

2:10:41.220 --> 2:10:46.420
 fighting, but just pushing on even when things are difficult. I guess these are the kinds of

2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:53.940
 general stories that made me, I guess, want to work on things that would be hard and where

2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:58.900
 it could be a campaign. It could be that you work on something for a year, multiple years,

2:11:00.740 --> 2:11:06.180
 because that was the point. Yeah, it starts with a single person. That's the interesting thing.

2:11:06.180 --> 2:11:11.380
 I've obviously been, I don't shadow about it recently about World War II, especially on the

2:11:11.380 --> 2:11:17.060
 Hitler side and the Stalin side. Some of that has really affected my own family, the roots of my

2:11:17.060 --> 2:11:25.780
 family very much. But it's interesting to think that it was just an idea and one person decided

2:11:25.780 --> 2:11:31.220
 to do stuff and it just builds and builds and builds. And you can truly have an impact on the

2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:47.700
 world, both horrendous and exceptionally positive and inspiring. It's agency of us individuals.

2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:51.540
 Sometimes we think we're just reacting to the world, but we have the full power to actually

2:11:51.540 --> 2:11:57.940
 change the world. Is there advice you can give to young folks? We give a bunch of advice on

2:11:57.940 --> 2:12:04.180
 middle school, high school mathematics. Is there more general advice you give about how to succeed

2:12:04.180 --> 2:12:10.420
 in life, how to learn for high school students, for college students, career or life in general?

2:12:10.420 --> 2:12:15.380
 So I think the first one would be to make sure that you're learning to invent and to make sure

2:12:15.380 --> 2:12:22.260
 you're not just learning how to mimic, because a lot of times you learn how to do X by watching

2:12:22.260 --> 2:12:27.300
 somebody do X and then repeating X many times with different inputs. I've just been very generic

2:12:27.300 --> 2:12:32.820
 in explaining this, but I guess this is just my own attitude towards the world. I didn't like

2:12:32.820 --> 2:12:36.980
 ever following anyone's directions exactly. Even if you told me this is the way to do

2:12:36.980 --> 2:12:41.700
 your homework is to write in pencil, I would say, but I think that is nice. Let's try.

2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:49.780
 So I've been that kind of a funny person. But I do encourage that if you can learn how to

2:12:49.780 --> 2:12:54.180
 invent as your core skill, then you can do a lot. But then the second piece that comes with that

2:12:54.180 --> 2:12:59.380
 is something I learned from my PhD advisor, PhD advisor, which was, well, make sure that what

2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:05.220
 you're working on is big enough. And so in that sense, I usually advise to people once they have

2:13:05.220 --> 2:13:12.100
 learned how to invent, ideally, don't just try to settle for something comfortable. Try to see if

2:13:12.100 --> 2:13:17.860
 you can aim for something which is hard, which might involve a campaign, which might be important,

2:13:17.860 --> 2:13:24.900
 which might make a difference. And it's more of, I guess, rather than worrying, what if you didn't

2:13:24.900 --> 2:13:31.860
 achieve that? There's also the regret of, what if I didn't try? That's how I operate. I don't

2:13:31.860 --> 2:13:35.780
 operate based on, did I succeed or fail? It was hard anyway. If I did this Novid thing and the

2:13:35.780 --> 2:13:40.260
 whole thing failed, would I feel terrible? No, it's a very hard problem. But would I have had the

2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:46.180
 regret of not jumping in? Yes. So it's that different mentality of don't worry about the

2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:52.660
 failing part as much of the make sure you give yourself the shot at those potentially unbounded

2:13:52.660 --> 2:13:58.660
 opportunities. You almost make it sound like there's a meaning to it all. Let me ask the

2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:03.620
 big ridiculous question. What do you think is the meaning of life? Or maybe the easier version of

2:14:03.620 --> 2:14:09.300
 that is what brings your life joy? So I'll just answer that one personally. For me, I'm a little

2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:17.460
 bit weird. I sort of see the pen and pencil discussion from earlier. Yeah. So I mean,

2:14:17.460 --> 2:14:26.420
 my thing is, I guess I personally just wanted to maximize a certain score, which was for how many

2:14:26.980 --> 2:14:34.820
 person years after I'm no longer here anymore, did what I do mattered. And it didn't matter if

2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:40.820
 it's necessarily attributed to me. It's just like, did it matter? And so that's what I wanted.

2:14:41.700 --> 2:14:47.220
 I guess that is very inspired by how scientists work. It's like, why do we keep talking about

2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:51.940
 Newton? It's because Newton discovered some interesting things. And so Newton's score is

2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:58.420
 pretty high. It's going to be infinity, right? Well, let's hope it's infinity, but pretty high.

2:14:58.420 --> 2:15:08.820
 Ah, yes. So the person years, you're going for triple digits. So Newton is like four digits

2:15:08.820 --> 2:15:14.580
 probably, like a thousand years. Or a person lifetimes. How do you like to think about what are we?

2:15:15.220 --> 2:15:20.500
 Sorry, I've met people times years. So then it's like, actually, his is huge. His is like going to

2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:27.540
 be billions or trillions, right? Trillions. But I guess, for me, I actually changed the metric

2:15:27.540 --> 2:15:31.860
 after a while. And the reason is because you may have seen, I found some simple way to solve

2:15:31.860 --> 2:15:38.820
 quadratic equations that is easier than every textbook. So my score might already be not bad,

2:15:38.820 --> 2:15:44.420
 which is why I decided then let's change it into the number of hours in the lifetimes as well.

2:15:44.420 --> 2:15:54.980
 So the way I was doing it before is that if a person was sort of remembering or using or appreciating

2:15:54.980 --> 2:16:03.140
 what I had done for like 10 years of their life, that would count as 10. So if there was one person

2:16:03.140 --> 2:16:07.300
 who for 10 years remembered or appreciated something I did, that counts as a score of 10,

2:16:07.300 --> 2:16:15.220
 and we add up over all people. And then that was with the hypothesis that the score would be very

2:16:15.220 --> 2:16:20.340
 finite in the sense that if I didn't come up with anything that might potentially help a lot of

2:16:20.340 --> 2:16:25.220
 generations in a forever way, then your score will be finite because at some point it's not,

2:16:25.780 --> 2:16:31.380
 people don't remember that you made like nice bottles or something, right? But then after

2:16:31.380 --> 2:16:36.020
 the quadratic equation thing, it was that there's some chance that that actually might make it into

2:16:36.020 --> 2:16:40.340
 textbooks. And if it makes it into textbooks, the chance that there will be an easier way

2:16:40.340 --> 2:16:46.500
 discovered is actually quite small. So in that case, then the score might get bigger. I was just

2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:50.340
 saying the score might actually already have been achieved in a non trivial way.

2:16:51.060 --> 2:16:55.860
 I see. Because it's fun to think about because it could be different. You can achieve a high score

2:16:56.820 --> 2:17:03.220
 by a small number of people using it for most of their lifetime and then generations and generations,

2:17:03.220 --> 2:17:09.940
 or you can have, if we do dissipate, if we do colonize, become multi planetary species,

2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:18.180
 you could have that little, a clever way to solve differential equations spread through

2:17:18.180 --> 2:17:24.660
 like trillions of people as they spread throughout the galaxy. And they would only use it each one

2:17:24.660 --> 2:17:29.940
 a few hours in their lifetime, but their kids we use it, the kids the kids we use it will spread

2:17:29.940 --> 2:17:35.140
 and you'll have that impact in that kind of way. Yes. So that's why I renormalized it. Because I

2:17:35.140 --> 2:17:38.660
 was like, well, that's kind of dumb because what's the importance of that? That'll save people 15

2:17:38.660 --> 2:17:42.980
 minutes. But so what I meant is I didn't want to count that as the main score.

2:17:46.180 --> 2:17:50.260
 Well, I'm going to have to try to come up with some kind of device that everyone would want to use,

2:17:50.260 --> 2:17:56.340
 maybe to make coffee, because coffee seems to be the prevalent performance enhancing chemical

2:17:56.340 --> 2:18:01.060
 that everyone uses. So I'll have to think about those kinds of metrics. Yeah. But you see,

2:18:01.060 --> 2:18:05.780
 that's just giving an idea of I guess what I found meaningful in general, like whether or not it's

2:18:05.780 --> 2:18:09.940
 like whether or not that quadratic thing is important or not. The general idea was I wanted

2:18:09.940 --> 2:18:14.180
 to do things that would outlast me. And that was what inspired me. And that's just how I choose

2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:19.860
 what problems to work on. And that's a kind of immortality is ideas that you've invented

2:18:20.740 --> 2:18:26.180
 living on long after you in the minds of others. And humans are ultimately not

2:18:27.060 --> 2:18:34.180
 are like meat vehicles that carry ideas for a brief for just a few years may not be the

2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:39.380
 important thing. It might be the ideas that we carry with us and invent new ones. Like we get a

2:18:39.380 --> 2:18:44.900
 bunch of baby ideas in our head. We borrow them from others. And then maybe we invent a new one.

2:18:44.900 --> 2:18:50.740
 And then you one might have a life of its own. And it's fun. It's fun to think about that idea

2:18:50.740 --> 2:18:56.820
 of living for many centuries to come, unless we destroy ourselves. But maybe AI will borrow it

2:18:56.820 --> 2:19:04.340
 and we'll remember Poe as like that one human that that helped us out before we of course killed

2:19:04.340 --> 2:19:10.180
 him and the rest of human civilization. On that note, Poe, this is a huge honor. You're one of

2:19:10.180 --> 2:19:16.740
 the great educators I've ever gotten a chance to interact with. So it's truly an honor that you

2:19:16.740 --> 2:19:21.940
 would talk with me today. It means especially a lot that you would travel out to Austin to talk

2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:28.100
 to me. It really means a lot. So thank you so much. Keep on inspiring. And I'm one of your

2:19:28.820 --> 2:19:32.900
 many, many students. Thank you so much for talking today. Oh, thank you. Thank you. It's

2:19:32.900 --> 2:19:36.660
 actually a real honor for me to talk to you and to get this chance to have this

2:19:36.660 --> 2:19:40.100
 really intellectual conversation through all of these topics. Thanks, Poe.

2:19:41.300 --> 2:19:45.300
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Poe Shen Loh. And thank you to

2:19:45.300 --> 2:19:52.580
 Jordan Harmer to show on it, better help, eight sleep and element. Check them out in the description

2:19:52.580 --> 2:19:59.220
 to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with the words from Isaac Newton. I can calculate

2:19:59.220 --> 2:20:05.060
 the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people. Thank you for listening and hope to see

2:20:05.060 --> 2:20:16.020
 you next time.
