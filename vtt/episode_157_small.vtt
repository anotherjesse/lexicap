00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
 The following is a conversation with Natalia Bailey,

00:02.840 --> 00:06.000
 a rocket scientist and spacecraft propulsion engineer

00:06.000 --> 00:09.540
 previously at MIT, and now the founder and CTO

00:09.540 --> 00:13.640
 of Axion Systems, specializing in efficient space

00:13.640 --> 00:16.840
 propulsion engines for satellites and spacecraft.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.360
 So these are not the engines that get us

00:19.360 --> 00:22.000
 from the ground on Earth out to space,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.600
 but rather the engines that move us around in space

00:25.600 --> 00:27.280
 once we get out there.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.080
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:29.080 --> 00:31.280
 MonkPak, Low Carb Snacks,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.320
 Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,

00:33.320 --> 00:35.840
 Blinkist, an app that summarizes books,

00:35.840 --> 00:38.560
 and Sun Basket, meal delivery service.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.600
 So the choice is snacks, caffeine,

00:41.600 --> 00:44.080
 knowledge, or a delicious meal.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.300
 Choose wisely my friends, and if you wish,

00:51.280 --> 00:52.680
 As a side note, let me say something

00:52.680 --> 00:54.560
 about Natalia's story.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.200
 She has talked about how when she was young,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.800
 she would often look up at the stars and dream

00:59.800 --> 01:02.040
 of alien intelligences that one day

01:02.040 --> 01:03.800
 we could communicate with.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.480
 This moment of childlike cosmic curiosity

01:06.480 --> 01:09.760
 is at the core of my own interest in space

01:09.760 --> 01:12.440
 and extraterrestrial life, and in general,

01:12.440 --> 01:15.560
 in artificial intelligence, science, and engineering.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.280
 Amid the meetings and the papers and the career rat race

01:19.280 --> 01:22.320
 and all the awards, let's not let ourselves

01:22.320 --> 01:24.640
 lose that childlike wonder.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.640
 Sadly, we're on Earth for only a very short time,

01:27.640 --> 01:30.000
 so let's have fun solving some of the biggest puzzles

01:30.000 --> 01:32.080
 in the universe while we're here.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.480

01:41.780 --> 01:45.440
 And now, here's my conversation with Natalia Bailey.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.600
 You said that you spent your whole life dreaming

01:48.600 --> 01:52.600
 about space and also pondering the big existential question

01:52.600 --> 01:56.720
 of whether there is or isn't intelligent life,

01:56.720 --> 01:58.600
 intelligent alien civilizations out there.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.040
 So what do you think?

02:00.040 --> 02:02.080
 Do you think there's life out there?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.520
 Intelligent life?

02:03.520 --> 02:07.320
 Intelligent life, that's trickier.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.320
 I think looking at the likelihood of a self replicating

02:14.360 --> 02:19.360
 organism given how much time the universe has existed

02:19.360 --> 02:23.400
 and how many stars with planets,

02:23.400 --> 02:26.360
 I think it's likely that there's other life,

02:27.280 --> 02:28.480
 intelligent life.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.400
 I'm hopeful, you know, I'm a little discouraged

02:31.400 --> 02:34.480
 that we haven't yet been in touch.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.040
 Allegedly, I mean, it's also.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.560
 In our dimensions and so on, yeah.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.200
 It's also possible that they have been in touch

02:42.200 --> 02:46.160
 and we just haven't, we're too dumb to realize

02:46.160 --> 02:47.520
 they're communicating with us.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.320
 In whichever, it's this Carl Sagan idea

02:51.320 --> 02:53.280
 that they may be communicating at a time scale

02:53.280 --> 02:54.600
 that's totally different.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.800
 Like their signals are in a totally different time scale

02:57.800 --> 03:01.920
 or in a totally different kind of medium of communication.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.920
 It could be our own, it could be the birth of human beings,

03:10.840 --> 03:13.400
 whatever the magic that makes us who we are,

03:13.400 --> 03:15.480
 the collective intelligence thing,

03:15.480 --> 03:17.720
 that could be aliens themselves,

03:17.720 --> 03:19.560
 that could be the medium of communication.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.040
 Like the nature of our consciousness and intelligence

03:22.040 --> 03:24.200
 itself is the medium of communication.

03:24.200 --> 03:28.960
 And like being able to ask the questions themselves,

03:28.960 --> 03:30.520
 I've never thought of it that way.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.480
 Like actually, yeah, asking the question

03:32.480 --> 03:34.760
 whether aliens exist might be the very medium

03:34.760 --> 03:35.960
 by which they communicate.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.680
 It's like they send questions.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.760
 So some this like collective emergent behavior

03:42.760 --> 03:44.520
 is the signal.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.640
 Is the signal, yeah.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.480
 So.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.720
 Interesting, yeah.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.640
 Cause maybe that's how we would communicate.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.480
 If you think about it, if we were way, way, way smarter,

03:53.480 --> 03:56.400
 like a thousand years from now, we somehow survive,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.280
 like how would we actually communicate?

03:59.280 --> 04:03.200
 In a way that's like, if we broadcast the signal,

04:05.080 --> 04:07.640
 and then it could somehow like percolate

04:07.640 --> 04:10.760
 throughout the universe, like that signal having an impact.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.840
 Multiverse.

04:11.840 --> 04:16.840
 Multiverse, of course, that would have a signal,

04:16.960 --> 04:19.800
 an effect on the most, the highest number

04:19.800 --> 04:21.280
 of possible civilizations.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.560
 What would that signal be?

04:22.560 --> 04:26.880
 It might not be like sending a few like stupid little

04:26.880 --> 04:28.160
 hello world messages.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.840
 It might be something more impactful.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.280
 Where it's almost like impactful in a way

04:36.280 --> 04:40.200
 where they don't have to have the capability to hear it.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.760
 It like forces the message to have an impact.

04:42.760 --> 04:43.720
 Right.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.560
 My train of thought has never gone there, but I like it.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.480
 And also somewhere in there, I think it's implied

04:51.480 --> 04:54.880
 that something travels faster than the speed of light,

04:54.880 --> 04:58.080
 which I'm also really hopeful for.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.480
 Oh, you're hopeful.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.720
 Are you excited by the possibility

05:01.720 --> 05:03.960
 that there's intelligent life out there?

05:03.960 --> 05:08.000
 Sort of you work on the engineering side of things.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.880
 It's this very kind of focus pursuit

05:10.880 --> 05:15.760
 of moving things through space efficiently.

05:15.760 --> 05:19.440
 But if you zoom out, one of the cool things

05:19.440 --> 05:23.720
 that this enables us to do is get even intelligent life,

05:23.720 --> 05:28.200
 just life on Mars or on Europa or something like that.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.640
 Does that excite you?

05:29.640 --> 05:30.800
 Does that scare you?

05:31.760 --> 05:32.920
 Oh, it's very exciting.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.840
 I mean, it's the whole reason I went into the field

05:36.840 --> 05:41.840
 I'm in is to contribute to building the body of knowledge

05:42.240 --> 05:46.200
 that we have as a species.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.520
 So very exciting.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.320
 Do you think there's life on Mars?

05:50.680 --> 05:54.360
 Like no longer, well, already living,

05:54.360 --> 05:57.320
 but currently living, but also no longer living,

05:57.320 --> 05:59.640
 like that we might be able to find life

05:59.640 --> 06:03.560
 as some people suspect, basic microbial life.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.360
 I'm not so sure about in our own solar system.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.360
 And I do think it might be hard to untangle

06:10.360 --> 06:15.680
 if we somehow contaminated other things as well.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.160
 So I'm not sure about this close to home.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.560
 That'd be really exciting.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.400
 Yes.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.000
 Like, do you think about the Drake equation much of like?

06:24.000 --> 06:28.520
 That was what got me into all of this, yeah.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.520
 Yeah, cause one of the questions is how hard is it

06:31.520 --> 06:34.280
 for life to start on a habitable planet?

06:34.280 --> 06:36.320
 Like if you have a lot of the basic conditions,

06:36.320 --> 06:39.880
 not exactly like Earth, but basic Earth like conditions,

06:39.880 --> 06:41.520
 how hard is it for life to start?

06:41.520 --> 06:45.000
 And if you find life on Mars or find life on Europa,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.600
 that means it's way easier.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.000
 That's a good thing to confirm

06:50.000 --> 06:52.600
 that if you have a habitable planet,

06:53.800 --> 06:55.600
 then there's going to be life.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.840
 And that like immediately, that would be super exciting

06:58.840 --> 07:02.480
 because that means there's like trillions of planets

07:02.480 --> 07:04.640
 with basic life out there.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.360
 Though of all the planets in our solar system,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.400
 Earth is clearly the most habitable.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.440
 So I would not be discouraged

07:12.440 --> 07:14.400
 if we didn't find it on another planet

07:15.400 --> 07:17.040
 in our solar system.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.080
 True, and again, that life could look very different.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.080
 It's habitable for Earth like life,

07:21.080 --> 07:23.560
 but it could be totally different.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.880
 I still think that trees are quite possibly

07:25.880 --> 07:27.440
 more intelligent than humans,

07:27.440 --> 07:31.320
 but their intelligence is carried out over time scale

07:31.320 --> 07:33.080
 that we're just not able to appreciate.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.160
 Like they might be running

07:34.160 --> 07:36.320
 the entirety of human civilization

07:36.320 --> 07:38.640
 and we're just like too dumb to realize

07:38.640 --> 07:40.360
 that they're the smart ones.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.840
 Maybe that's the alien message, it's in the trees.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.520
 It's in the trees.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.600
 Yeah, it's not in the monolith

07:49.600 --> 07:51.000
 in the Utah desert, it's in the trees.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.680
 Right, yeah.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.120
 So let's go to space exploration.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.240
 How do you think we get humans to Mars?

07:57.240 --> 08:01.360
 I think SpaceX and Elon Musk will be the ones

08:01.360 --> 08:05.880
 that get the first human setting foot on Mars

08:06.960 --> 08:10.120
 and probably not that long from now

08:10.120 --> 08:12.560
 from us having this conversation.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.960
 Maybe we'll inflate his timeline a little bit,

08:14.960 --> 08:19.200
 but I tend to believe the goals he sets.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.360
 So I think that will happen relatively soon.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.040
 As far as when and what it will take

08:25.040 --> 08:28.840
 to get humans living there in a more permanent way,

08:30.840 --> 08:32.800
 I have a glib answer, which is,

08:32.800 --> 08:35.920
 when we can invent a time machine

08:35.920 --> 08:38.600
 to go back to the early Cold War

08:38.600 --> 08:43.240
 and instead of uniting around sending people to the moon,

08:43.240 --> 08:45.760
 we pick Mars as the destination.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.920
 So really, I say that because there's nothing

08:49.920 --> 08:54.640
 truly scientifically or technologically impossible

08:54.640 --> 08:57.720
 about doing that soon,

08:57.720 --> 09:00.960
 it's more politically and financially

09:00.960 --> 09:04.480
 and those are the obstacles, I think, to that.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.440
 Well, I wonder of when you colonize with more than,

09:08.440 --> 09:10.760
 I say, five people on Mars,

09:10.760 --> 09:14.960
 you have to start thinking about the kind of rules

09:14.960 --> 09:16.680
 you have on Mars.

09:16.680 --> 09:21.680
 And speaking of the Cold War, who gets to own the land?

09:22.280 --> 09:23.760
 You start planting flags,

09:23.760 --> 09:25.800
 and you start to make decisions.

09:25.800 --> 09:30.120
 And SpaceX says this, it's probably a little bit trolly,

09:30.120 --> 09:34.360
 but they have this nice paragraph in their contracts

09:34.360 --> 09:39.360
 where it talks about that human governments on Earth

09:41.760 --> 09:46.760
 or Earth governments have no jurisdiction on Mars.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.280
 Like the rules, the Martians get to define their own rules.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.920
 It sounds very much like the founding fathers

09:53.920 --> 09:56.240
 for this country, that's the kind of language.

09:57.360 --> 10:02.120
 It's interesting that that's in there

10:02.120 --> 10:07.120
 and it makes you think perhaps that needs to be leveraged.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.040
 Like you have to be very clever about leveraging that

10:10.040 --> 10:14.800
 to create a little bit of a Cold War feeling.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.960
 It seems like we humans need a little bit of a competition.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.200
 Do you think that's necessary to succeed

10:21.200 --> 10:25.480
 in getting the necessary investment

10:25.480 --> 10:28.840
 or can the pure pursuit of science be enough?

10:28.840 --> 10:30.880
 No, I think we're seeing right now

10:30.880 --> 10:33.440
 the pure pursuit of science.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.440
 I mean, that results in pretty tiny budgets for exploration.

10:39.360 --> 10:43.880
 There has to be some disaster impending doom

10:43.880 --> 10:48.280
 to get us onto another planet in a permanent way.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.600
 I don't know.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.600
 Financially, I just don't know if the private sector

10:52.600 --> 10:57.520
 can support that, but I don't wish

10:57.520 --> 11:00.520
 that there is some catastrophe coming our way

11:00.520 --> 11:03.840
 that spurs us to do that.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.960
 Yes, I'm unsure what the business model is

11:05.960 --> 11:08.000
 for colonizing Mars.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.160
 Yeah, exactly.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.360
 Yeah, like there is for, we'll talk about satellites.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.800
 There's probably a lot of business models around satellites,

11:14.800 --> 11:18.160
 but there's not enough short term business.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.720
 I guess that's how business works.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.000
 You should have a path to making money

11:23.000 --> 11:25.120
 in the next 10 years.

11:25.120 --> 11:29.720
 Well, and maybe even more broadly

11:29.720 --> 11:33.400
 and looping back to something we said earlier,

11:33.400 --> 11:37.880
 I don't know that getting humans off this planet

11:37.880 --> 11:42.880
 and spreading bacteria is what we're supposed to be doing

11:44.760 --> 11:47.760
 in the first place, so maybe we can go

11:47.760 --> 11:52.760
 but should we, and I'm probably an unusual person

11:54.360 --> 11:56.280
 for thinking that in my industry

11:56.280 --> 11:59.400
 because humans want to explore,

11:59.400 --> 12:04.480
 but I almost wonder, are we putting unnecessary obstacles?

12:04.480 --> 12:07.480
 We're very finicky biological things

12:07.480 --> 12:10.160
 in the way of some more robotic

12:10.160 --> 12:14.400
 or more silicon based exploration.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.000
 And yeah, do we need to colonize and spread?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.320
 I'm not sure.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.880
 What do you think is the role of AI in space?

12:22.880 --> 12:25.600
 Do you, in your work, again, we'll talk about it,

12:25.600 --> 12:30.600
 but do you see more and more of the space vehicles,

12:32.280 --> 12:37.280
 spacecraft being run by artificial intelligence systems

12:37.280 --> 12:39.080
 more than just like the flight control

12:39.080 --> 12:40.960
 but like the management?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.840
 Yeah, I don't have a lot of color to the dreams

12:43.840 --> 12:46.160
 I have about way in the future in AI,

12:46.160 --> 12:51.160
 but I do think that removing,

12:51.600 --> 12:54.720
 you know, it's hard for humans to even make a trip to Mars,

12:54.720 --> 12:58.040
 much less go anywhere farther than that.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.680
 And I think we'll have, you know, more,

13:03.360 --> 13:05.920
 again, I'm probably unusual in having these thoughts,

13:05.920 --> 13:09.400
 but perhaps be able to generate more knowledge

13:09.400 --> 13:12.960
 and understand more if we stop trying to send humans

13:12.960 --> 13:15.440
 and instead, you know, I don't know if we're talking

13:15.440 --> 13:20.440
 about AI in a truly artificial intelligence way

13:20.680 --> 13:23.800
 or AI as we kind of use it today,

13:23.800 --> 13:28.800
 but maybe sending a Petri dish or two of like stem cells

13:29.000 --> 13:31.960
 and some robotic candlers instead

13:31.960 --> 13:34.000
 if we still need to send our DNA

13:34.000 --> 13:36.040
 because we're really stuck on that.

13:36.040 --> 13:40.000
 But if not, you know, maybe not even that Petri dish.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.400
 So I see, I think what I'm saying is, you know,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.800
 I see a much bigger role in the future

13:44.800 --> 13:47.080
 of AI for space exploration.

13:47.080 --> 13:50.280
 It's kind of sad to think that, I mean,

13:50.280 --> 13:53.680
 I'm sure we'll eventually send a spacecraft

13:53.680 --> 13:56.280
 with a efficient propulsion like some of the stuff

13:56.280 --> 13:59.480
 you work on out that travels just really far

13:59.480 --> 14:04.480
 with some robots on it and with some DNA in a Petri dish.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.760
 And then a human civilization destroys itself

14:08.640 --> 14:11.280
 and then there'll just be this floating spacecraft

14:11.280 --> 14:13.960
 that eventually gets somewhere or not.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.560
 That's a sad thought like this lonely spacecraft

14:16.560 --> 14:18.640
 just kind of traveling through space

14:18.640 --> 14:20.640
 and humans are all dead.

14:20.640 --> 14:25.640
 Well, it depends on what the goal is, right?

14:27.280 --> 14:29.680
 Another way to look at it is we've preserved,

14:29.680 --> 14:32.760
 it's like a little time capsule of knowledge, DNA,

14:32.760 --> 14:36.440
 you know, that we've, that will outlive us.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.280
 Oh, that's beautiful.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.120
 Yeah.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.400
 That's how I sleep at night.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.760
 So you also mentioned that you wanted to be an astronaut.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.600
 Yes.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.760
 So even though you said you're unusual in thinking like,

14:48.760 --> 14:50.840
 it's nice here on earth,

14:50.840 --> 14:53.880
 and then we might want to be sending robots up there,

14:53.880 --> 14:57.120
 you wanted to be a human that goes out there.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.680
 Would you like to one day travel to Mars?

15:01.520 --> 15:06.160
 You know, if it becomes sort of more open to civilian travel

15:06.160 --> 15:07.280
 and that kind of thing.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.920
 Like, are you like vacation wise?

15:09.920 --> 15:12.440
 Like if you're talking, if we're talking vacations,

15:12.440 --> 15:15.360
 would you like to vacation on earth or vacation on Mars?

15:15.360 --> 15:20.240
 I wish that I had a better answer, but no.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.560
 I wanted to be an astronaut because I,

15:24.680 --> 15:28.480
 first of all, I like working in labs and doing experiments.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.480
 And I wanted to go to like the coolest lab, the ISS,

15:34.240 --> 15:37.000
 and do some experiments there.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.680
 That's being decommissioned, which is sad,

15:39.680 --> 15:42.280
 but there will be others, I'm sure.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.680
 The ISS is being decommissioned?

15:44.680 --> 15:49.400
 Yes, I think by 2025, it's not going to be in use anymore.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.000
 But I think there are private companies

15:52.000 --> 15:55.360
 that are going to be putting up stations and things.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.280
 So it's primarily like a research lab, essentially.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.120
 Yes.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.240
 Research lab in space, that's a cool way to say it's like

16:00.240 --> 16:02.440
 the coolest possible research lab.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.720
 That's where I wanted to go.

16:03.720 --> 16:08.720
 And now though, my risk profile has changed a little bit.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
 I have three little ones and I won't be in the first thousand

16:16.360 --> 16:18.640
 people to go to Mars, let's put it that way.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.440
 Yeah, earth is kind of nice.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.960
 We have our troubles, but overall it's pretty nice.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.960
 Again, it's the Netflix.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.520
 Okay, let's talk rockets.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.400
 How does a rocket engine work?

16:30.400 --> 16:34.600
 Or any kind of engine that can get us the space

16:34.600 --> 16:36.800
 or float around in space?

16:36.800 --> 16:40.520
 The basic principle is conservation of momentum.

16:40.520 --> 16:45.440
 So you throw stuff out the back of the engine

16:45.440 --> 16:50.040
 and that pushes the rocket and the spacecraft

16:50.040 --> 16:51.000
 in the other direction.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
 So there are two main types of rocket propulsion.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.520
 The one people are more familiar with is chemical

16:59.520 --> 17:02.120
 because it's loud and there's fire.

17:03.120 --> 17:06.680
 And that's what's used for launch and is more televised.

17:06.680 --> 17:11.680
 So in those types of systems, you usually have a fuel

17:11.680 --> 17:14.680
 on an oxidizer and they react and combust

17:14.680 --> 17:17.520
 and release stored chemical energy.

17:17.520 --> 17:22.520
 And that energy heats the resultant gas

17:22.520 --> 17:25.080
 and that's funneled out the back through and not

17:25.080 --> 17:27.720
 the back through and nozzle directed out the back.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.160
 And then that momentum exchange pushes

17:31.160 --> 17:32.400
 this basic craft forward.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.080
 Is there an interesting difference in liquid

17:34.080 --> 17:36.760
 and solid fuel in those contexts?

17:36.760 --> 17:38.720
 They're both lumped in the same.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.160
 So chemical just means that the release of energy

17:43.160 --> 17:45.720
 from those bonds essentially.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.240
 So a solid fuel works the same way.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.800
 And the other main category is electric propulsion.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.840
 So instead of chemical energy, you're using electrical energy

17:56.840 --> 18:00.680
 usually from batteries or solar panels.

18:00.680 --> 18:05.680
 And in this case, the stuff you're pushing out the back

18:05.960 --> 18:07.800
 would be charged particles.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.560
 So instead of combustion and heat,

18:11.560 --> 18:13.840
 you end up with charged particles

18:13.840 --> 18:16.240
 and you force them out the back of the spacecraft

18:16.240 --> 18:20.160
 using either an electrostatic field or electromagnetic.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.600
 But it's the same momentum exchange

18:23.600 --> 18:25.440
 and same idea stuff out the back

18:25.440 --> 18:27.760
 and everything else goes forward.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.160
 Cool, so those are the big two categories.

18:30.160 --> 18:35.160
 What's the difference maybe in like the challenges of each,

18:39.280 --> 18:43.760
 the use cases of each and how they're used today,

18:43.760 --> 18:47.280
 the physics of each and where they're used,

18:47.280 --> 18:48.240
 all that kind of stuff.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.920
 Anything interesting about the two categories

18:49.920 --> 18:51.520
 that distinguishes them

18:51.520 --> 18:56.520
 besides the chemical one being the big sexy flames and.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.800
 Yeah, fire.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.640
 Fire, yeah.

18:59.640 --> 19:04.640
 Chemical is very well understood in its simplest form.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.000
 It's like a firework.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.080
 So it's been around since 400 BC or something like that.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.040
 So even the big engines are quite well understood.

19:15.040 --> 19:20.040
 I think one of the last gaps there is probably

19:23.640 --> 19:27.400
 what exactly are the products of combustion,

19:27.400 --> 19:31.400
 our modeling abilities kind of fall apart there

19:32.520 --> 19:35.520
 because it's hot and gases are moving

19:35.520 --> 19:40.520
 and you end up kind of having to venture

19:40.520 --> 19:45.520
 into lots of different interdisciplinary fields of science

19:46.800 --> 19:49.120
 to try to solve that and that's quite complex

19:49.120 --> 19:51.880
 but we have pretty good models

19:51.880 --> 19:54.080
 for some of the more like emergent behaviors

19:54.080 --> 19:55.160
 of that system anyways.

19:55.160 --> 20:00.160
 But that's I think one of the last unsolved pieces

20:00.600 --> 20:04.760
 and really the kind of what people care about there

20:04.760 --> 20:07.760
 is making it more fuel efficient.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.640
 So the chemical stuff, you can get a lot

20:11.640 --> 20:15.360
 of instantaneous thrust but it's not very fuel efficient.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.560
 It's much more fuel efficient

20:16.560 --> 20:19.960
 to go with the electric type of propulsion.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.280
 So that's where people spend a lot of their time

20:23.280 --> 20:24.880
 is trying to make that more efficient

20:24.880 --> 20:28.280
 in terms of thrust per unit of fuel.

20:28.280 --> 20:31.840
 And then there's always considerations

20:31.840 --> 20:33.680
 like heating and cooling.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.320
 It's very hot, which is good if it heats the gases

20:36.320 --> 20:40.640
 but bad if it melts the rocket and things like that.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
 So there's always a lot of work on heating and cooling

20:42.640 --> 20:45.300
 and the engine cycles and things like that.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.640
 And then on electric propulsion,

20:48.640 --> 20:53.640
 I find it like much more refreshingly poorly understood.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.200
 Well, that's more mysteries.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.760
 Yeah, I think so.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.160
 One of the classes I took in college

21:02.160 --> 21:06.000
 spent, we spent 90% of the class on chemical propulsion

21:06.000 --> 21:07.840
 and then the last 10% on electric

21:07.840 --> 21:09.400
 and then professor said like,

21:09.400 --> 21:12.200
 we only sort of understand how it works

21:12.200 --> 21:15.440
 but it works kind of and it's like that's interesting.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.800
 That's what I'm gonna work on.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.440
 Yeah, and even an ion engine, which is probably

21:21.440 --> 21:22.720
 one of the most straightforward

21:22.720 --> 21:27.440
 because it's just an electrostatic engine

21:27.440 --> 21:29.840
 but it has this really awesome combination

21:29.840 --> 21:34.080
 of like quantum mechanics and material science

21:34.080 --> 21:38.160
 and fluid dynamics and electrostatics

21:38.160 --> 21:41.480
 and it's just very intriguing to me.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.720
 First of all, can you actually zoom out even more

21:44.720 --> 21:47.920
 like, because you mentioned ion propulsion engine

21:47.920 --> 21:51.000
 is a subset of electric.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.520
 So like maybe, is there a categories of electric engines

21:53.520 --> 21:55.760
 and then we can zoom in on ion propulsion?

21:55.760 --> 21:57.720
 Yes, so sure.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.480
 There's the two most kind of conventional types

22:01.480 --> 22:04.840
 that have been around since the 60s are ion engines

22:04.840 --> 22:08.800
 and hall thrusters and ion engines are a little bit simpler

22:08.800 --> 22:11.440
 because they don't use a magnetic field

22:11.440 --> 22:15.640
 for generating thrust and then there are also

22:17.520 --> 22:19.920
 some other types of plasma engines

22:19.920 --> 22:21.920
 but that don't fit into those two categories.

22:21.920 --> 22:26.280
 So just kind of other plasma like a Vazimir engine

22:26.280 --> 22:30.960
 which we could get into and then those are probably

22:30.960 --> 22:33.720
 the main three categories that would be fun to talk about.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.400
 Oh, and then of course the category of engine

22:36.400 --> 22:39.360
 that I work on which has a lot of similarities

22:39.360 --> 22:41.760
 to an ion engine but could be considered

22:41.760 --> 22:44.480
 its own class called a colloid thruster.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.520
 Colloid, cool.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.880
 Okay, so what is an ion propulsion ion engine?

22:48.880 --> 22:53.880
 Okay, so in an ion engine you have an ionization chamber

22:54.240 --> 22:57.560
 and you inject the propellant into that chamber

22:57.560 --> 23:02.560
 and this is usually a neutral gas like xenon or argon.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.960
 So you inject that into the chamber

23:04.960 --> 23:09.240
 and you also inject a stream

23:09.240 --> 23:12.200
 of really hot high energy electrons

23:12.200 --> 23:16.560
 and everything's just moving around very randomly in there

23:16.560 --> 23:21.240
 and the whole goal is to have one of those electrons

23:21.240 --> 23:24.080
 collide with one of those neutral atoms

23:24.080 --> 23:25.920
 and turn it into an ion.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.360
 So kick off a secondary electron and now you have

23:29.360 --> 23:30.200
 Plasma.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.480
 Yes, okay.

23:31.480 --> 23:36.480
 And now you have a charged xenon or argon ion

23:39.680 --> 23:42.000
 and more electrons and so on.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.960
 And then some fraction of those ions will happen

23:46.960 --> 23:50.600
 to make it to this downstream electric field

23:50.600 --> 23:53.880
 that we set up between two grids with holes in them.

23:53.880 --> 23:58.200
 And in terms of area, the same amount of those ions

23:58.200 --> 24:01.680
 also runs into the walls and lose their charge

24:01.680 --> 24:04.480
 and that's where some of the inefficiencies come in.

24:04.480 --> 24:09.000
 But the very lucky few make it to those holes in that grid

24:09.000 --> 24:11.200
 and there are two grids actually

24:11.200 --> 24:14.440
 and you apply a voltage differential between them

24:14.440 --> 24:17.120
 and that sets up an electric field

24:17.120 --> 24:21.240
 and a charged particle in an electric field creates a force.

24:21.240 --> 24:24.920
 And so those ions are accelerated out the back of the engine

24:24.920 --> 24:29.680
 and the reaction force is what pushes the spacecraft forward.

24:31.200 --> 24:35.520
 If you're following along and tallying these charges,

24:35.520 --> 24:39.720
 now we've just sent a positive beam of ions

24:39.720 --> 24:42.000
 out the back of the spacecraft.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.680
 And for our purposes here, the spacecraft is neutral.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.960
 So eventually those ions will come back

24:48.960 --> 24:51.560
 and hit the spacecraft because it's a positive beam.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.320
 So you also have to have an external cathode producer

24:56.320 --> 24:58.800
 of electrons outside the engine

24:58.800 --> 25:02.320
 that pumps electrons into that beam and neutralizes that.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.000
 So now it's net neutral everywhere

25:04.000 --> 25:05.320
 and it won't come back to the spacecraft.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.840
 So that's an ion engine.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.800
 What temperature are we talking about here?

25:09.800 --> 25:13.040
 So in terms of like the chemical based engines,

25:13.040 --> 25:14.880
 those are super hot.

25:14.880 --> 25:20.160
 You mentioned plasma here, how hot does this thing get?

25:20.160 --> 25:22.120
 I mean, is that an interesting thing to talk about

25:22.120 --> 25:25.280
 in a sense that is that an interesting distinction

25:25.280 --> 25:28.320
 or is heat, I mean, it's all gonna be hot?

25:28.320 --> 25:31.440
 No, so it's important, especially for some

25:31.440 --> 25:32.840
 of these smaller satellites,

25:32.840 --> 25:35.320
 people are into launching these days.

25:35.320 --> 25:39.280
 So it's important because you have the plasma

25:39.280 --> 25:42.400
 but also those high energy electrons are hot

25:42.400 --> 25:46.000
 and if you have a lot of those that are going

25:46.000 --> 25:48.240
 into the walls, you do have to care about the temperature.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.560
 So having trouble remembering off the top of my head,

25:52.560 --> 25:55.000
 I think they're at like a hundred electron volts

25:55.000 --> 25:56.840
 in terms of the electron energy.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.880
 And then I'd have to remember

25:58.880 --> 26:00.760
 how to convert that into Kelvin.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.240
 Can you stick your hand in it?

26:02.240 --> 26:03.680
 Is that not temperature?

26:03.680 --> 26:05.680
 Not recommended, yeah.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.720
 So what's a colloid engine?

26:07.720 --> 26:12.720
 So the same rocket people that came up with these ideas

26:16.200 --> 26:19.560
 for electric propulsion probably in the middle

26:19.560 --> 26:23.360
 of last century also realized

26:23.360 --> 26:27.200
 that there's one more place to get charged particles

26:27.200 --> 26:30.400
 from if you're going to be using electric propulsion.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.280
 So you can take a gas and you can ionize it

26:33.280 --> 26:35.800
 but there are also some liquids,

26:35.800 --> 26:38.680
 particularly ionic liquids, which is what we use

26:38.680 --> 26:42.520
 that you also can use as a source of ions.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.680
 And if you have ions and you put them in a field,

26:44.680 --> 26:45.640
 you generate a force.

26:45.640 --> 26:50.640
 So they recognize that but part of being able

26:51.280 --> 26:55.120
 to leverage that technique is being able to kind of

26:55.120 --> 26:58.880
 manipulate those liquids on a scale of nanometers

26:58.880 --> 27:01.280
 or very few microns.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.360
 So the diameter of a human hair or something like that.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.680
 And in the fifties, there was no way to do that.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.560
 So they wrote about it in some books

27:10.560 --> 27:12.800
 and then it kind of died for a little bit.

27:12.800 --> 27:17.800
 And then with silicon, MEMS, computer processors

27:17.960 --> 27:21.480
 and when foundry started becoming more ubiquitous

27:21.480 --> 27:26.480
 and my advisor started at MIT kind of put those ideas

27:28.360 --> 27:30.040
 back together and was like,

27:30.040 --> 27:32.760
 hey, actually there's now a way to build this

27:32.760 --> 27:35.680
 and bring this other technique to life.

27:35.680 --> 27:40.680
 And so the way that you actually get the ions

27:40.920 --> 27:44.000
 out of those liquids is you put the liquid

27:44.000 --> 27:47.200
 in again a strong electric field

27:47.200 --> 27:50.240
 and the electric field stresses the liquid

27:50.240 --> 27:51.800
 and you keep increasing the field

27:51.800 --> 27:56.800
 and eventually the liquid will assume a conical shape.

27:57.060 --> 28:00.280
 It's when the electric field pressure

28:00.280 --> 28:02.760
 that's pulling on it exactly balances

28:02.760 --> 28:04.760
 the liquids own restoring force,

28:04.760 --> 28:06.840
 which is its surface tension.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.440
 So you have this balance and the liquid assumes a cone

28:10.440 --> 28:12.400
 when it's perfectly balanced like that.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.360
 And at the tip of a cone, the radius of curvature

28:16.360 --> 28:18.520
 goes to zero right at the tip.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.960
 And the radius, sorry, the electric field

28:22.960 --> 28:27.480
 right at the tip of a sharp object would go to infinity

28:27.480 --> 28:31.200
 because it goes as one over the radius

28:31.200 --> 28:33.200
 and one over the radius squared.

28:33.200 --> 28:37.440
 And instead of the electric field going to infinity

28:37.440 --> 28:40.960
 and maybe like generating a wormhole or something,

28:40.960 --> 28:44.260
 a jet of ions instead starts issuing

28:44.260 --> 28:46.200
 from the tip of that liquid.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.740
 So the field becomes strong enough there

28:47.740 --> 28:50.480
 that you can pull ions out of the liquid.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.600
 What is the liquid?

28:51.600 --> 28:54.560
 We're talking about, there's a bunch of different ones.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.480
 You can do it with different types of liquids.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.060
 It depends on how easily you can free ions

29:02.060 --> 29:06.520
 from their neighbors and if it has enough surface tension

29:06.520 --> 29:09.080
 so that you can build up a high enough electric field.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.380
 But what we use are called ionic liquids

29:12.380 --> 29:14.760
 and they're really just positive.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.040
 They're very similar to salts,

29:16.040 --> 29:17.120
 but they happen to be liquid

29:17.120 --> 29:19.440
 over a really wide range of temperatures.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.600
 This sounds like really cool.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.680
 Okay, so how big is the cone over time?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.680
 What's the size of this cone that generates the ions?

29:27.680 --> 29:30.560
 So if you have a cone that's emitting pure ions,

29:33.120 --> 29:35.160
 I can't remember if it's the radius or diameter,

29:35.160 --> 29:39.200
 but that emission is happening from,

29:39.200 --> 29:41.840
 of that cone is something like 20 nanometers.

29:41.840 --> 29:45.360
 Oh, I was imagining something slightly bigger,

29:45.360 --> 29:49.280
 but so this is tiny, tiny,

29:49.280 --> 29:52.120
 hence the only being able to do it recently.

29:52.120 --> 29:52.960
 Yeah, that's right.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.720
 So this is all controlled by a computer, I guess.

29:55.720 --> 29:59.360
 Like, or like, how do you control,

29:59.360 --> 30:01.600
 how do you create a cone that generates ions

30:01.600 --> 30:04.040
 at a scale of nanometers, exactly?

30:04.040 --> 30:08.520
 So the kind of main trick to making this work

30:08.520 --> 30:12.680
 is that physically we manufacture hundreds

30:12.680 --> 30:14.720
 or thousands of sharp structures

30:14.720 --> 30:17.200
 and then supply the liquid to the tips.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.240
 So that does a few things.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.040
 It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming

30:23.040 --> 30:25.280
 so we can put holes in the grid above them

30:25.280 --> 30:28.000
 to let them actually leave instead of hitting, right?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.440
 Cool.

30:29.440 --> 30:33.000
 But it also reduces the actual field we have,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.320
 the voltage we have to apply to create that field

30:35.320 --> 30:36.840
 because the field will be much stronger

30:36.840 --> 30:41.840
 if we can already give the liquid a tip to form on.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.280
 And those tips we form have radii of curvature

30:45.280 --> 30:50.280
 on the order of probably like single microns.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.480
 So we are working at a little bit larger scale,

30:53.480 --> 30:55.680
 but once we create that support

30:55.680 --> 30:57.960
 and the electric field can be focused at that tip,

30:57.960 --> 31:00.120
 then the tiny little cone can form.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.000
 So wait, so there's something in them,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.680
 there's an already like a hard material

31:04.680 --> 31:07.120
 that like gives you the base for the cone

31:07.120 --> 31:08.720
 and then you pouring like liquid over it,

31:08.720 --> 31:09.560
 whatever that happens.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.840
 From the bottom, yeah, it's porous.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.240
 So we actually supply it from the back of the chip

31:13.240 --> 31:14.080
 and then it wicks.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.360
 It forms on top on that structure.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.200
 Yeah.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.240
 And then you somehow make it like super sharp,

31:19.240 --> 31:22.520
 the liquid, so the ions can leave.

31:24.840 --> 31:28.520
 And then we've applied that field to get those ions

31:28.520 --> 31:31.600
 and that same field then accelerates them.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.440
 That's awesome.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.920
 And there's like a bunch of these?

31:33.920 --> 31:37.440
 Yeah, I should have brought something.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.720
 So we...

31:38.720 --> 31:41.240
 You could just pretend that you have some nanometer cones

31:41.240 --> 31:42.080
 on the table.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.040
 Actually, you know, kind of about this scale,

31:45.040 --> 31:47.640
 we build, we call them thruster chips

31:47.640 --> 31:50.000
 and it's just a convenient form factor

31:50.000 --> 31:51.840
 and it's a square centimeter.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.760
 And on each square centimeter today,

31:53.760 --> 31:56.720
 we have about 500 of the actual physical,

31:56.720 --> 31:59.440
 we call them emitters, those physical cones.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.520
 And we're working on increasing that by a factor of four

32:04.520 --> 32:05.720
 in the coming months.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.080
 In size or in the density?

32:08.080 --> 32:10.400
 In the density, the number of emitters

32:10.400 --> 32:12.360
 within the same square centimeter chip.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.440
 So that thing, cause I think I've seen pictures of you

32:14.440 --> 32:15.880
 with like a tiny thing in your hand,

32:15.880 --> 32:17.400
 that must be the...

32:17.400 --> 32:19.920
 Okay, so that's an engine.

32:19.920 --> 32:24.440
 So that is kind of the ionization chamber

32:24.440 --> 32:26.160
 and thrust producing part of it.

32:26.160 --> 32:31.160
 What's not shown in that picture is the propellant tank.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.480
 So we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid

32:34.480 --> 32:36.800
 to those emission sites.

32:36.800 --> 32:40.600
 And then we also provide a power electronic system

32:40.600 --> 32:41.880
 that talks to the spacecraft

32:41.880 --> 32:43.880
 and turns our device on and off.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.800
 So that's the colloid engine.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.680
 That's the core of the colloid engine.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.440
 It's the way I've been talking about it.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.240
 It's more of ion electrospray.

32:53.240 --> 32:58.240
 Colloid tends to mean like liquid droplets

32:59.120 --> 33:00.560
 coming off of the jet.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.440
 But if you make smaller and smaller cones,

33:03.440 --> 33:04.880
 you get pure ions.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.480
 So we're kind of like a subset of colloid, yes.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.400
 What aspects of this?

33:09.400 --> 33:11.360
 You said that it's been full of mystery

33:11.360 --> 33:13.240
 from the physics perspective.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.840
 What aspects of this are understood

33:15.840 --> 33:19.680
 and what are still full of mystery?

33:19.680 --> 33:24.680
 Yeah, recently we've been understanding

33:24.760 --> 33:29.760
 the kind of instabilities and stable regimes of,

33:30.680 --> 33:32.640
 you know, how much liquid do you supply

33:32.640 --> 33:34.560
 and what field do you apply?

33:34.560 --> 33:38.000
 And why is it flickering on and off

33:38.000 --> 33:39.760
 or why does it have these weird behaviors?

33:39.760 --> 33:41.960
 So that's in the past just couple of years

33:41.960 --> 33:45.900
 that's become much more understood.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.280
 I think the two areas that come to mind

33:49.280 --> 33:54.280
 as far as not as well understood are the boundary between,

33:56.280 --> 34:00.000
 you know, you have, we actually use

34:00.000 --> 34:03.080
 kind of big molecular ions.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.800
 And if you're looking at the molecular scale,

34:07.760 --> 34:10.520
 you have, you know, some ions that you've extracted

34:10.520 --> 34:12.880
 and they're in this electric field.

34:12.880 --> 34:16.240
 One ion, you know, it's a big molecule.

34:16.240 --> 34:19.280
 It's getting energy from the electric field

34:19.280 --> 34:21.800
 and some of that energy is going into the bonds

34:21.800 --> 34:24.320
 and making it vibrate and doing weird things to it.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.520
 Sometimes it breaks them apart.

34:26.520 --> 34:30.520
 And then zooming out to the whole beam,

34:30.520 --> 34:34.800
 the beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.920
 And there's a big gap between what are those,

34:37.920 --> 34:39.840
 how do you connect those

34:39.840 --> 34:42.280
 and how do we understand that better

34:42.280 --> 34:45.840
 so that we can understand the beam performance of the engine?

34:45.840 --> 34:48.760
 Is that a theory question or is it an engineering question?

34:48.760 --> 34:50.160
 Theory, definitely.

34:50.160 --> 34:54.400
 We're, Axion is a startup and we're more in the business

34:54.400 --> 34:59.400
 of building and testing and observing and characterizing.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.040
 And we're not really diving much into that theory right now.

35:03.040 --> 35:06.280
 Okay, zooming out a little bit on the physics,

35:06.280 --> 35:08.280
 I apologize for the way too big of a question,

35:08.280 --> 35:13.280
 but to you from either, you mentioned Axion is,

35:13.680 --> 35:16.720
 you know, more of sort of an engineering endeavor, right?

35:16.720 --> 35:19.720
 From a perspective of physics in general,

35:19.720 --> 35:22.480
 science in general, or the side of engineering,

35:22.480 --> 35:25.640
 what do you think is the most to you like beautiful

35:25.640 --> 35:29.760
 and captivating and inspiring idea in this space?

35:30.600 --> 35:33.440
 In this space, and then I'm gonna zoom out

35:33.440 --> 35:35.680
 a little bit more, but in this space,

35:35.680 --> 35:40.680
 I keep budding up against material science questions.

35:41.760 --> 35:45.040
 So I, over the past 10 years,

35:45.040 --> 35:49.680
 I feel like every problem or interesting thing

35:49.680 --> 35:52.440
 I want to work on, if you dig deep enough,

35:52.440 --> 35:55.520
 you end up in material science land,

35:55.520 --> 35:57.840
 which I find kind of exciting

35:57.840 --> 36:00.720
 and it makes me want to dig in more there.

36:00.720 --> 36:05.720
 And I was just, you know, even for our technology,

36:06.320 --> 36:09.120
 when we have to move the propellant from the tank

36:09.120 --> 36:10.760
 to the tip of the emitters,

36:10.760 --> 36:12.800
 we rely a lot on capillary action

36:12.800 --> 36:15.880
 and you're getting into wetting and surface energies.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.880
 At a scale of like, you know.

36:17.880 --> 36:22.160
 Yeah, I mean, it's, if you look further, it's quantum too,

36:22.160 --> 36:25.280
 but it all is, you know.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.880
 Like, capillary action at the quantum level.

36:27.880 --> 36:31.920
 Yeah, so I would, it all comes back to me,

36:31.920 --> 36:33.760
 to, you know, material science.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.800
 There's so much we don't understand at these sizes.

36:37.760 --> 36:42.760
 And I find that inspiring and exciting.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.000
 And then more broadly, you know,

36:46.000 --> 36:50.040
 I remember when I learned that the same equation

36:50.040 --> 36:53.800
 that describes flow over an airfoil

36:53.800 --> 36:57.480
 is used to price options, the Black Scholes equation.

36:57.480 --> 37:01.480
 And it's, you know, just a partial differential equation,

37:01.480 --> 37:06.480
 but that kind of connectedness of the universe,

37:06.520 --> 37:09.360
 you know, I don't want to use options pricing

37:09.360 --> 37:10.840
 and the universe and the same.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.640
 But you know what I mean, this connectedness,

37:12.640 --> 37:15.320
 I find really magical.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.880
 Yeah, the patterns that mathematics reveals

37:17.880 --> 37:20.360
 seems to echo in a bunch of different places.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.200
 Yes.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.320
 Yeah, there's just weirdness.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.080
 It's like, it really makes you think,

37:25.080 --> 37:27.280
 I think through definitely living in a simulation,

37:27.280 --> 37:29.200
 like whoever programmed it.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.400
 I like that, that's your conclusion.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.360
 It's using like shortcuts to program it.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.480
 Like they didn't, they're just copying pieces

37:36.480 --> 37:38.200
 and codes for the different parts.

37:38.200 --> 37:41.560
 Yeah, think of something new or just paste from over there.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.800
 They won't notice.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.760
 My conclusion from that was,

37:44.760 --> 37:47.160
 I'm going to go interview for finance jobs.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.520
 So I had like a little detour.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.760
 That's the backup option.

37:51.760 --> 37:56.040
 So in terms of using Colet engines,

37:56.040 --> 37:58.080
 what's an interesting difference

37:58.080 --> 38:01.760
 between a propulsion of a rocket from Earth,

38:01.760 --> 38:04.280
 when you're standing on the ground to orbit,

38:04.280 --> 38:06.920
 and then the kind of propulsion necessary

38:06.920 --> 38:08.480
 for once you get out to orbit

38:08.480 --> 38:12.840
 or to like deep space to move around?

38:14.040 --> 38:19.040
 Yes, the reason you can't use an engine like mine

38:19.040 --> 38:22.440
 to get off the ground is,

38:22.440 --> 38:24.800
 you know, the thrust it generates

38:24.800 --> 38:27.320
 is instantaneous thrust is very small.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.000
 But if you have the time

38:30.000 --> 38:32.600
 and can accumulate that acceleration,

38:32.600 --> 38:33.960
 you can still reach speeds

38:33.960 --> 38:37.280
 that are very interesting for exploration

38:37.280 --> 38:40.320
 and even for missions with humans on them.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.480
 An interesting direction,

38:44.480 --> 38:47.880
 I think we need to go as humans,

38:47.880 --> 38:51.320
 exploring space is the power supplies

38:51.320 --> 38:54.600
 for electric propulsion are limiting us

38:54.600 --> 38:58.480
 in that, you know, solar panels are really inefficient

38:58.480 --> 39:00.520
 and bulky and batteries.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.920
 I don't know when anybody's ever going to improve

39:03.920 --> 39:05.320
 battery technology.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.960
 I know a lot of people that work on that.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.960
 And nuclear power,

39:11.960 --> 39:15.160
 we could have a lot more powerful electric propulsion system.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.440
 So they would be extremely fuel efficient,

39:17.440 --> 39:19.680
 but more instantaneous thrust

39:19.680 --> 39:21.360
 to do more interesting missions

39:21.360 --> 39:24.560
 if we could start launching more nuclear systems.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.520
 So like something that's powered,

39:27.520 --> 39:30.960
 nuclear powered, that's the right way to say it.

39:32.240 --> 39:36.000
 But isn't a small enough container that could be launched?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.320
 Yeah, so, I mean, as a world,

39:39.320 --> 39:44.320
 we do launch spacecraft with nuclear power systems on board,

39:44.320 --> 39:47.200
 but size is one consideration.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.560
 It hasn't been a big focus.

39:48.560 --> 39:53.320
 So the reactors and the heaters and everything are bulky.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.680
 And so they're really only suitable

39:54.680 --> 39:59.160
 for some of the much bigger interplanetary stuff.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.920
 So that's one issue, but then it's a whole like

40:01.920 --> 40:05.720
 rat's nest of political stuff as well.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.240
 I heard, I think Elon described or somebody,

40:09.240 --> 40:12.400
 I think it was Elon that described the EV

40:12.400 --> 40:17.400
 to all electrical vertical takeoff and landing vehicles.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.080
 So basically saying rockets,

40:19.080 --> 40:22.600
 obviously Elon is interested in electric vehicles, right?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.600
 But he said that rockets can't.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.760
 In the near term, it doesn't make sense

40:28.760 --> 40:30.000
 for them to be electrical.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.400
 What do you see a world with the rockets

40:35.400 --> 40:39.520
 that we use to get into orbit are also electric based?

40:39.520 --> 40:43.680
 It's possible, you can produce the thrust levels you need,

40:43.680 --> 40:47.000
 but you need this, a much bigger power supply.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.240
 And I think that would be nuclear.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.080
 And the only way people have been able to launch them

40:52.080 --> 40:54.120
 at all is that they're in a, you know,

40:54.120 --> 40:58.200
 100 times redundancy safe mode while they're being launched

40:58.200 --> 41:00.680
 and they're not turned on until they're farther off.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.040
 So if you were to actually try to use it on launch,

41:04.040 --> 41:06.720
 I think a lot of people would still have an issue with that,

41:06.720 --> 41:08.200
 but someday.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.040
 It's an interesting concept, nuclear.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.440
 It seems like people, like everybody that works

41:13.440 --> 41:16.760
 on nuclear power has shown how safe it is

41:16.760 --> 41:18.360
 as a source of energy.

41:18.360 --> 41:23.360
 And yet we seem to be, I mean, based on the history,

41:23.760 --> 41:26.160
 based on the excellent HBO series,

41:26.160 --> 41:28.200
 I'm Russian with a Chernobyl.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.240
 It seems like we have our risk estimation

41:31.240 --> 41:35.560
 about this particular power source is drastically inaccurate,

41:35.560 --> 41:37.720
 but that's a fascinating idea

41:37.720 --> 41:41.520
 that we would use nuclear as a source for our vehicles

41:42.600 --> 41:44.200
 and not just in outer space.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.040
 That's cool.

41:45.040 --> 41:45.880
 I'm gonna have to look into that.

41:45.880 --> 41:46.960
 That's super interesting.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.320
 Well, just last year,

41:49.320 --> 41:52.240
 Trump eased up a little bit on the regulations

41:52.240 --> 41:56.120
 and NASA and hopefully others are starting

41:56.120 --> 41:57.840
 to pick up on the development.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.240
 So now is a good time to look into it

42:00.240 --> 42:02.280
 because there's actually some movement.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.600
 Is that a hope for you to explore different energy sources

42:05.600 --> 42:10.600
 that the entirety of the vehicle uses something like,

42:10.840 --> 42:13.040
 like the entirety of the propulsion systems

42:13.040 --> 42:16.960
 for all aspects of the vehicle's life travel

42:16.960 --> 42:18.960
 is the same or electric?

42:18.960 --> 42:20.440
 Is it possible for it to be the same?

42:20.440 --> 42:24.280
 Like the coolant engine being used for everything.

42:24.280 --> 42:27.400
 You could, and you would have to do it in the same way.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.520
 We do different stages of rockets now

42:29.520 --> 42:34.520
 where once you've used up an engine or a stage,

42:34.520 --> 42:36.720
 you let it go because there's really no point

42:36.720 --> 42:37.560
 in holding onto it.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.200
 So I wouldn't necessarily want to use

42:39.200 --> 42:41.680
 the same engine for the whole thing,

42:41.680 --> 42:45.040
 but the same technology I think would be interesting.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.200
 Okay, so it's possible.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.360
 All right, but in terms of the power source.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.080
 The power source, that's really interesting.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.520
 But for the current power sources

42:52.520 --> 42:54.040
 and its current use cases,

42:54.040 --> 42:55.640
 what's the use case for electric?

42:55.640 --> 42:58.920
 Like the coolant engine,

42:58.920 --> 43:01.600
 can you talk about where they're used today?

43:01.600 --> 43:06.600
 Sure, so chemical engines are still used quite a bit

43:06.600 --> 43:07.960
 once you're in orbit,

43:07.960 --> 43:11.040
 but that's also where you might choose instead

43:11.040 --> 43:12.480
 to use an electric system

43:12.480 --> 43:15.840
 and what people do with them.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.720
 And this includes the ion engines

43:17.720 --> 43:19.440
 and hall thrusters and our engine

43:20.400 --> 43:22.600
 is basically any maneuvering you need to do

43:22.600 --> 43:24.080
 once you're dropped off.

43:26.240 --> 43:30.120
 Even if your only goal was to just stay in your orbit

43:30.120 --> 43:32.560
 and not move for the life of your mission,

43:32.560 --> 43:34.640
 you need propulsion to accomplish that

43:34.640 --> 43:38.320
 because the Earth's gravity field changes

43:38.320 --> 43:39.520
 as you go around in orbit

43:39.520 --> 43:42.600
 and pulls you out of your little box.

43:42.600 --> 43:45.200
 There are other perturbations

43:45.200 --> 43:47.920
 that can throw you off a bit.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.760
 And then most people want to do things

43:50.760 --> 43:52.040
 a little bit more interesting,

43:52.040 --> 43:55.920
 like maneuver to avoid being hit by space debris

43:55.920 --> 43:59.000
 or perhaps lower their orbit

43:59.000 --> 44:01.200
 to take a higher resolution image of something

44:01.200 --> 44:03.040
 and then return.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.760
 At the end of your mission,

44:05.760 --> 44:09.520
 you're supposed to responsibly get rid of your satellite,

44:09.520 --> 44:11.800
 whether that's burning it up,

44:11.800 --> 44:13.600
 but if you're in geo,

44:13.600 --> 44:16.040
 you want to push it higher into graveyard orbit.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.360
 What's geo?

44:19.360 --> 44:21.960
 So low Earth orbit and then geo synchronous orbit

44:21.960 --> 44:23.240
 or geo stationary orbit.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.720
 And there's a graveyard.

44:24.720 --> 44:29.360
 Yeah, so those satellites are at like 40,000 kilometers.

44:29.360 --> 44:33.120
 So if they were to try to push their satellites

44:33.120 --> 44:35.440
 back down to burn up in the atmosphere,

44:35.440 --> 44:37.840
 they would need even more propulsion

44:37.840 --> 44:40.560
 than they've had for the whole lifetime of their mission.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.400
 So instead they push them higher

44:42.400 --> 44:44.240
 where it'll take a million years

44:44.240 --> 44:46.840
 for it to naturally deorbit.

44:46.840 --> 44:50.240
 So we're also cluttering that higher bit up as well,

44:50.240 --> 44:53.080
 but it's not as pressing as Leo,

44:53.080 --> 44:54.160
 which is low Earth orbit,

44:54.160 --> 44:56.360
 where more of these commercial missions are going now.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.320
 Well, so how hard is the collision avoidance problem there?

44:59.320 --> 45:00.840
 You said some debris and stuff.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.800
 So like how much propulsion is needed?

45:03.800 --> 45:05.840
 Like how much is the life of a satellite

45:05.840 --> 45:08.600
 is just like a crap trying to avoid like

45:08.600 --> 45:09.560
 what if it's in there?

45:09.560 --> 45:14.560
 I think one of the recent rules of thumb I heard was per year

45:16.120 --> 45:17.520
 some of these small satellites

45:17.520 --> 45:20.840
 are doing like three collision avoidance maneuvers.

45:21.880 --> 45:24.080
 So that's not, yeah,

45:24.080 --> 45:29.080
 but it's not zero and it takes a lot of planning

45:29.360 --> 45:33.840
 and people on the ground and none of that really,

45:33.840 --> 45:36.280
 I don't think right now is autonomous.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.640
 Oh, that's not good.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.920
 Yeah, and then we have a lot of folks

45:39.920 --> 45:42.960
 taking advantage of Moore's law and cheaper spacecraft.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.040
 So they're launching them up

45:44.040 --> 45:46.040
 without the ability to maneuver themselves.

45:46.040 --> 45:49.160
 And they're like, well, I don't know, just don't hit me.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.600
 And three times a year that could become affordable

45:51.600 --> 45:55.640
 if it's like, if it gets hit, maybe it won't be damaged

45:55.640 --> 45:57.640
 kind of thing, that kind of logic.

45:57.640 --> 46:00.920
 Affordable in that instead of launching one satellite,

46:00.920 --> 46:02.720
 they'll launch, you know, 20 small ones.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.080
 Yeah, so if one gets taken out, that's okay.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.560
 But the problem is that, you know,

46:06.560 --> 46:09.640
 one good size satellite getting hit,

46:09.640 --> 46:11.680
 that's like a ballistic event

46:11.680 --> 46:14.040
 that turns into 10,000 pieces of debris

46:14.040 --> 46:17.440
 that then are the things that go and hit the other satellites.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.280
 Yeah.

46:18.280 --> 46:22.360
 Do you see a world where like in your sense,

46:22.360 --> 46:25.760
 in your own work and just in the space industry in general,

46:25.760 --> 46:28.160
 do you see that people are moving towards bigger satellites

46:28.160 --> 46:29.760
 or smaller satellites?

46:29.760 --> 46:31.200
 Is there going to be a mix?

46:31.200 --> 46:32.600
 Like what's, and what do we talk,

46:32.600 --> 46:36.280
 what does it mean for a satellite to be big and small?

46:36.280 --> 46:37.120
 What size are we talking about?

46:37.120 --> 46:42.120
 So big, the space industry prior to, I don't know, 1990,

46:44.120 --> 46:46.800
 you know, I guess the bulk of the majority of satellites

46:46.800 --> 46:49.000
 were the size of a school bus

46:49.000 --> 46:53.200
 and costs a couple billion dollars.

46:53.200 --> 46:58.200
 And now, you know, our first launches were on satellites

46:59.960 --> 47:03.040
 the size of shoeboxes that were built by high school students.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.360
 So that's a very different, you know,

47:05.360 --> 47:07.480
 to give you the two ends of the spectrum.

47:08.760 --> 47:12.320
 Big satellites will, I think they're here to stay,

47:12.320 --> 47:15.640
 at least as far as I can see into the future

47:15.640 --> 47:17.880
 for things like broadcasting.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.160
 You want to be able to, you know,

47:21.160 --> 47:24.040
 broadcast to as many people as possible.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.840
 You also can't just go to small satellites

47:28.840 --> 47:32.080
 and say Moore's law for things like optics.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.720
 So if you have an aperture on your satellite, you know,

47:34.720 --> 47:37.800
 that just, that doesn't follow Moore's law, that's different.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.280
 So it's always going to be the size that it will be,

47:40.280 --> 47:42.080
 you know, unless there's some new physics

47:42.080 --> 47:44.320
 that comes out that I'm not aware of.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.640
 But if you need a resolution and you're at an altitude

47:46.640 --> 47:49.200
 that kind of sets your size of your telescope.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.800
 But because of Moore's law,

47:52.800 --> 47:56.840
 we are able to do a lot more with smaller packages

47:56.840 --> 48:00.320
 and with that, you know, comes more affordability

48:00.320 --> 48:03.800
 and opening up access to space to more and more people.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.280
 Well, what's the smallest satellite you've seen go up there?

48:06.280 --> 48:09.360
 Like, what are the smallest kind, you said shoeboxes.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.840
 Yeah, so I think, you know, the smallest,

48:11.840 --> 48:16.840
 the smallest common form factor can fit a softball inside.

48:17.680 --> 48:21.360
 So that's 10 centimeters on each side.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.440
 But then there are some companies working on, you know,

48:24.440 --> 48:26.360
 fractions of that even.

48:26.360 --> 48:30.480
 And they're doing things like IOT type application.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.520
 So it's very low, you know, bandwidth type things,

48:34.520 --> 48:37.320
 but they're finding some niches for those.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.560
 Do you mean like there's a business,

48:38.560 --> 48:40.480
 there's a thing to do with them?

48:40.480 --> 48:44.040
 Yes, either. What do you do with a small satellite like that?

48:44.040 --> 48:48.160
 You can, you know, track a ship going across the ocean

48:48.160 --> 48:50.960
 is like, if you need to, if you just pinging something,

48:50.960 --> 48:53.400
 you know, you can handle that amount of data

48:54.320 --> 48:56.200
 and those latencies and so on.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.440
 You have to have propulsion on that.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.800
 You have to have a little engine.

48:58.800 --> 49:02.720
 No, those are just, you know, letting fall out of the sky.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.320
 Okay. Yeah.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.440
 But what, so what kind of solid lights

49:06.440 --> 49:08.960
 would you equip a colloid engine on?

49:08.960 --> 49:13.120
 Anything that's bigger than probably about 20 kilograms,

49:13.120 --> 49:16.440
 anything that needs to stay up for more than a year

49:16.440 --> 49:19.720
 or anything somebody spent more than like a hundred K

49:19.720 --> 49:21.960
 to build are kind of the ways I would think about it.

49:21.960 --> 49:23.600
 That's a lot of use cases.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.120
 What's the small set?

49:26.120 --> 49:26.960
 Like what's category?

49:26.960 --> 49:28.560
 Small set is actually very big.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.200
 I think it's like 700 kilograms or,

49:32.200 --> 49:33.880
 keep hitting my microphone.

49:33.880 --> 49:38.880
 Maybe a thousand kilograms down to 200 kilograms

49:39.120 --> 49:42.400
 or people have their own kind of definitions

49:42.400 --> 49:43.360
 of how they break them up,

49:43.360 --> 49:46.040
 but small set is still quite large.

49:46.040 --> 49:49.920
 And then it's kind of also applied as a blanket term

49:49.920 --> 49:53.080
 for anything that's not a school bus size satellite.

49:53.080 --> 49:56.400
 We need to get our jargon straight industry.

49:56.400 --> 50:00.400
 So what, do you see a possible future where, you know,

50:00.400 --> 50:02.560
 there's a few thousand satellites up there now,

50:02.560 --> 50:04.520
 a couple of thousand of them functioning?

50:05.480 --> 50:08.800
 Do you see a future where there's like millions of satellites

50:08.800 --> 50:13.040
 up in orbit or forget millions, tens of thousands?

50:13.040 --> 50:16.240
 Which just seems like where the natural trajectory

50:16.240 --> 50:20.160
 of the way things are going now is going.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.520
 Tens of thousands, yes.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.400
 The two, you know, buckets of applications.

50:26.400 --> 50:30.520
 One is imaging and the other is communication.

50:30.520 --> 50:35.160
 So imaging, I think that will plateau

50:35.160 --> 50:39.120
 because one satellite or one constellation

50:39.120 --> 50:41.280
 can take an image or a video and sell it

50:41.280 --> 50:44.360
 to, you know, infinity customers.

50:44.360 --> 50:47.600
 But if you're providing communications

50:47.600 --> 50:51.680
 like broadband internet or satellite cell

50:51.680 --> 50:54.400
 or something like that, satellite phone, you know,

50:54.400 --> 50:58.720
 you're limited by your transponders and so on.

50:58.720 --> 51:02.080
 So to serve more people, you actually need more satellites

51:02.080 --> 51:06.480
 and perhaps at the rate, you know, our data consumption

51:06.480 --> 51:08.880
 and things are going these days.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.280
 Yeah, I can see tens of thousands of satellites.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.520
 Can I ask you a ridiculous question?

51:14.520 --> 51:15.400
 Yes.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.760
 So I've recently watched this documentary on Netflix

51:18.760 --> 51:23.280
 about flat earthers that, you know,

51:23.280 --> 51:25.960
 the people that believe in a flat earth.

51:25.960 --> 51:30.040
 As somebody who develops propulsion systems

51:30.040 --> 51:33.080
 for satellites and for spacecraft,

51:33.960 --> 51:37.600
 what's to use the most convincing evidence

51:37.600 --> 51:38.880
 that the earth is round?

51:40.760 --> 51:45.760
 Probably some of the photos taken from the moon.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.120
 Photos in the moon, okay.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.960
 So it's not from the satellite space.

51:52.960 --> 51:56.120
 Yeah, I think seeing that perspective,

51:57.560 --> 52:00.400
 maybe I'm just, I'm answering too personally

52:00.400 --> 52:02.960
 because I really love those photos.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.000
 Because they're beautiful, yeah.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.400
 I really like the ones that show the moon

52:06.400 --> 52:09.920
 and the lunar lander and they're taken

52:09.920 --> 52:10.840
 a little bit farther back.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.280
 So you see earth and first you're like, wow, that's tiny

52:14.280 --> 52:17.800
 and we're insignificant and that's kind of sad.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.760
 But then you see this really cool thing

52:19.760 --> 52:23.800
 that we landed on another, you know, planetary body

52:23.800 --> 52:24.920
 and you're like, oh, okay.

52:24.920 --> 52:25.760
 Can you actually see her?

52:25.760 --> 52:27.120
 I don't know if I remember this one.

52:27.120 --> 52:29.240
 Yeah, I'll send you that picture.

52:29.240 --> 52:32.360
 Because I love the pictures or videos of just earth

52:32.360 --> 52:34.080
 from more from orbit and so on.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.280
 That's really beautiful.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.120
 That's like a perspective shifter.

52:38.120 --> 52:39.640
 That's the pale blue dot, right?

52:39.640 --> 52:41.440
 It probably appears tiny.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.400
 Yeah, and just that, you know,

52:43.400 --> 52:46.840
 juxtaposition of the insignificance, but.

52:46.840 --> 52:47.680
 You're another.

52:47.680 --> 52:50.840
 That's really cool thing, I just love that.

52:50.840 --> 52:51.680
 That'd be cool.

52:51.680 --> 52:54.440
 I personally love the idea of humans stepping out of Mars.

52:54.440 --> 52:57.840
 I'm such a sucker for the romantic notion of that

52:57.840 --> 53:01.400
 and being able to take pictures from Mars.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.240
 Next slide.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.080
 So you would go.

53:03.080 --> 53:08.080
 I would be, what did you say you said you wouldn't be?

53:09.080 --> 53:10.520
 Not in the first thousand.

53:10.520 --> 53:14.360
 The thousand, which it's funny because to me

53:14.360 --> 53:17.160
 that's brave to be in the first million.

53:17.160 --> 53:21.120
 I think when the Declaration of Independence

53:21.120 --> 53:22.640
 was signed in the United States,

53:22.640 --> 53:25.600
 that was like two million people.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.280
 So I would like to show up

53:27.280 --> 53:29.160
 when they're signing those documents.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.000
 Okay.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
 So maybe the two million.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.840
 Oh, that's an interesting way to think of it.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.120
 Cause like then we're like participating

53:35.120 --> 53:38.000
 as citizenry and defining the direction.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.120
 So it's not the technical risk.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.400
 You just don't want to show up somewhere

53:43.400 --> 53:46.960
 that's like America before.

53:46.960 --> 53:51.560
 Yeah, because I, from a psychological perspective,

53:51.560 --> 53:54.120
 it's just going to be a stressful mess

53:54.120 --> 53:56.240
 as people have studied, right?

53:56.240 --> 54:01.240
 It's like it's people, most likely the process

54:02.040 --> 54:07.040
 of colonization like looks like basically a prison.

54:07.280 --> 54:10.560
 Like you're in a very tight enclosed space with people.

54:10.560 --> 54:13.000
 And it's just a really stressful environment.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.840
 You know, how do you select the kind of people

54:14.840 --> 54:16.480
 that will go and then there'll be drama.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.120
 There's always drama in this.

54:18.120 --> 54:21.360
 And I just want to show up when there's some rules.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.960
 But I mean, you know, it depends.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.360
 So I'm not worried about the health

54:24.360 --> 54:26.080
 and the technical difficulties.

54:26.080 --> 54:29.520
 I'm more worried about the psychological difficulties.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.320
 And also just not being able to tweet.

54:31.320 --> 54:33.640
 Like what are you going to, how are you,

54:33.640 --> 54:34.680
 there's no Netflix.

54:34.680 --> 54:37.360
 So yeah, maybe not in the first million,

54:37.360 --> 54:39.880
 but the first hundred thousand.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.680
 It's exciting to define the direction of a new,

54:42.680 --> 54:46.240
 like how often do we not just have a revolution

54:46.240 --> 54:48.240
 to redefine our government?

54:48.240 --> 54:51.280
 As you know, smaller countries are still doing to this day,

54:51.280 --> 54:54.240
 but literally start over from scratch.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.840
 There's just our financial system.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.680
 It could be like based on cryptocurrency,

54:59.680 --> 55:02.600
 you could think about like how democracy, you know,

55:02.600 --> 55:06.920
 we have now the technology that can enable pure democracy.

55:06.920 --> 55:09.840
 For example, if we choose to do that,

55:09.840 --> 55:11.560
 as opposed to representative democracy,

55:11.560 --> 55:12.840
 all those kinds of things.

55:12.840 --> 55:16.560
 So we talked about two different forms of propulsion,

55:16.560 --> 55:18.040
 which are super exciting.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.720
 So the chemical base, that's doing pretty well.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.000
 And then the electric base is,

55:24.480 --> 55:26.920
 are there types of propulsion

55:26.920 --> 55:29.240
 that might sound like science fiction right now,

55:29.240 --> 55:31.280
 but are actually within the reach of science

55:31.280 --> 55:34.280
 in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years

55:34.280 --> 55:36.000
 that you kind of think about,

55:36.000 --> 55:39.280
 or maybe even within the space of even just like,

55:39.280 --> 55:43.840
 like even ion engines,

55:43.840 --> 55:46.720
 is there like breakthroughs that might 10x the thing,

55:46.720 --> 55:48.920
 like really improve it?

55:48.920 --> 55:51.840
 So, you know, the real game changer

55:51.840 --> 55:55.360
 would be propellant less propulsion.

55:55.360 --> 55:58.880
 And so every couple of years you see a new,

55:58.880 --> 56:01.960
 now a startup or a researcher

56:01.960 --> 56:05.360
 comes up with some contraption for producing thrust

56:05.360 --> 56:07.440
 that didn't require, you know,

56:07.440 --> 56:09.600
 we've been talking about conservation of momentum,

56:09.600 --> 56:12.840
 mass times velocity out the back,

56:12.840 --> 56:15.880
 mass times velocity forward, yes, exactly.

56:15.880 --> 56:19.680
 And you have to, you know, carry that up with you

56:19.680 --> 56:22.920
 or find it on an asteroid or harvest it from somewhere

56:22.920 --> 56:24.040
 if you didn't bring it with you.

56:24.040 --> 56:27.080
 So not having to do that would be, you know,

56:27.080 --> 56:29.760
 one of the ultimate game changers.

56:29.760 --> 56:34.760
 And I, you know, unless there are new types of physics,

56:34.760 --> 56:37.600
 I don't know how we do it, but it comes up often.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.600
 So it's something I do think about.

56:39.600 --> 56:43.760
 And, you know, the one, I think it's called the Kazmir effect.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.280
 If you can, if you have two plates

56:46.280 --> 56:49.520
 and the space between them is on the order of these,

56:49.520 --> 56:53.200
 like the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum particles

56:53.200 --> 56:55.640
 that pop into and out of existence or something.

56:56.920 --> 57:01.000
 I may be confusing multiple types of propellant less forces,

57:01.000 --> 57:06.000
 propellant less forces, but that could be real

57:07.720 --> 57:11.480
 and could be something that we use eventually.

57:11.480 --> 57:13.120
 We'll be the power source.

57:13.120 --> 57:16.000
 Yeah, the most recent engine like this

57:16.000 --> 57:19.920
 that has was just debunked this year,

57:19.920 --> 57:23.240
 I think in March or something was called the M drive.

57:23.240 --> 57:26.920
 And supposedly you used a power source.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.880
 So, you know, batteries or solar panels

57:28.880 --> 57:33.360
 to generate microwaves into this resonant cavity.

57:33.360 --> 57:36.160
 And people claimed it produced thrust.

57:36.160 --> 57:39.360
 So they went straight from this really loose concept

57:39.360 --> 57:40.920
 to building a device and testing it.

57:40.920 --> 57:42.920
 And they said, we've measured thrust

57:42.920 --> 57:45.240
 and sure on their thrust balance, they saw thrust

57:45.240 --> 57:48.680
 and different researchers built it and tested it

57:48.680 --> 57:49.920
 and got the same measurements.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.760
 And so it was looking actually pretty good.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.120
 No one could explain how it worked,

57:54.120 --> 57:59.120
 but what they said was that this inside the cavity,

57:59.840 --> 58:02.000
 the microwaves themselves didn't change,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.600
 but the speed of light changed inside the cavity.

58:04.600 --> 58:09.480
 So relative to that, you know, their momentum was conserved.

58:10.560 --> 58:15.320
 And I don't, you know, whatever.

58:15.320 --> 58:18.480
 But finally, someone I think at NASA built the device,

58:18.480 --> 58:21.200
 tested it, got the same thrust, then unhooked it,

58:21.200 --> 58:22.880
 flipped it backwards and turned it on,

58:22.880 --> 58:25.360
 but got the same thrust in the same direction again.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.400
 And so they're like, this is just an interaction

58:27.400 --> 58:29.080
 with the test set up or, you know,

58:29.080 --> 58:31.280
 some of the chamber or something like that.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.120
 So forwarded again, but, you know,

58:35.120 --> 58:37.240
 it would be so wonderful for everybody

58:37.240 --> 58:38.640
 if we could figure out how to do it.

58:38.640 --> 58:40.200
 But I don't know.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.120
 That's an interesting twist on it

58:42.120 --> 58:45.560
 because that's more about efficient travel,

58:45.560 --> 58:46.800
 long distance travel, right?

58:46.800 --> 58:48.600
 That's not necessarily about speed.

58:49.640 --> 58:52.640
 That's more about enabling like less.

58:52.640 --> 58:56.080
 Hook that up to the nuclear power supply.

58:56.080 --> 58:56.920
 There you go.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.160
 Okay.

58:58.160 --> 59:01.960
 But still in terms of speed, in terms of trying to,

59:01.960 --> 59:06.560
 so there's recently, already I think been debunked

59:06.560 --> 59:10.280
 or close to being debunked, but the signal,

59:10.280 --> 59:14.280
 a weird signal from our nearby friends,

59:14.280 --> 59:17.160
 nearby exoplanets from Proxima Centauri,

59:18.960 --> 59:22.480
 a signal that's 4.2 light years away.

59:22.480 --> 59:27.480
 So, you know, the thought is it'd be kind of cool

59:28.120 --> 59:30.360
 if there's life out there, alien life,

59:31.480 --> 59:34.400
 but it'd be really cool if it could fly out there and check.

59:34.400 --> 59:37.040
 And so what kind of propulsion,

59:37.040 --> 59:39.400
 and do you think about what kind of propulsion

59:39.400 --> 59:42.160
 allows to travel close to the speed of light

59:42.160 --> 59:43.720
 or, you know, half the speed of light,

59:43.720 --> 59:45.560
 all those kinds of things that would allow us

59:45.560 --> 59:47.040
 to get to Proxima Centauri

59:47.040 --> 59:49.400
 and that reasonable in a lifetime?

59:49.400 --> 59:54.400
 You know, there's the project Breakthrough Starshot

59:54.720 --> 59:59.720
 that's looking at sending those tiny little chipsets there.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:01.840
 And like accelerating really fast.

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:03.080
 Yeah, using a laser.

1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:05.240
 So launching them, and then while they're still

1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:07.080
 relatively close to the earth, you know,

1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:10.200
 blasting them with some, I forget what,

1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:14.640
 even what power level you needed to accelerate them fast enough

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:15.480
 to get there in 20 years.

1:00:15.480 --> 1:00:18.560
 Super crazy sounding, but a lot of people say

1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:20.720
 that's a legitimate, like it's crazy sounding,

1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:22.320
 but it can actually pull it off.

1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:24.160
 Yeah, I love that project

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.080
 because there are a lot of different aspects.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:27.360
 You know, there's the laser,

1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:31.280
 there's how do you then get enough power

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.200
 when you're there to send a signal back.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.640
 No part of that project is possible right now,

1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:38.320
 but I think it's really exciting.

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:41.920
 But do you see like human,

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:43.880
 like a spacecraft with a human on it,

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:45.520
 so there's like a heavy one,

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:49.120
 like us inventing new propulsion systems entirely.

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:52.320
 Like do you ever see that on the radar

1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:54.000
 of propulsion systems like that,

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.280
 or are they completely out there in the impossible?

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.720
 Well, we're going to quickly leave the realm

1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:03.200
 of what I can describe with any credibility,

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.080
 but I think because of special relativity,

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:10.560
 if we try to accelerate some mass

1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:12.400
 so close to the speed of light,

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:15.280
 it becomes infinitely heavy

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.080
 and then we just don't,

1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:20.360
 we'd have to like harness a lot of suns to do that.

1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:25.080
 Or, you know, it's just that math doesn't quite work out,

1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:29.520
 but, you know, in my child's,

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:30.600
 my child like heart,

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:34.120
 I believe that, you know, we're missing something,

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:38.320
 whether it's, you know, dark matter or other dimensions.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.960
 And if you can just have some anti matter

1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:46.640
 and a black hole and then ride that around

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.520
 and somehow, you know, turn that into some.

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.240
 Mess with gravity somehow.

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:55.520
 Yeah, I feel like we're missing lots of things

1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:00.080
 in this puzzle and that, you know.

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.920
 I wonder how that puzzle, yeah, right.

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:03.680
 Well, I can speak with confidence

1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:06.240
 as a descendant of Apes

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.480
 that we don't know what the hell we're doing.

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:09.560
 Yeah.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:12.760
 So there's, we're like really confident,

1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.720
 like physicists are really confident

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:17.440
 that we've like got most of the picture down.

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:20.880
 But it feels like, oh boy,

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.400
 it feels like that we might not even be getting started

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:26.920
 on some of the essential things

1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:31.320
 that would allow us to engineer systems

1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:36.320
 that would allow us to travel to space much, much faster.

1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:41.240
 Yeah, and there's even things that are much more common place

1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:42.520
 that we can't explain,

1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:44.120
 but we've started to take for granted,

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:48.440
 like quantum tunneling, you know.

1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:50.760
 Just things like, oh, the electron was here

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:53.240
 with this energy and now it's here with this energy

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.680
 and it's just tunneling.

1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:58.120
 But so, you know, we're missing a lot of the picture.

1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:02.160
 So yeah, I don't know to, you know,

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:03.480
 use your same question from earlier.

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:05.560
 I don't know if you and I will see it,

1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:08.000
 but yeah, someday.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.640
 You're the cofounder of just like we've been talking

1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:14.000
 about axion systems, it's a,

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.960
 would you say space propulsion company?

1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:16.800
 Yes.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:17.640
 Broadly speaking.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.280
 So how do you, big question,

1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:25.720
 how do you build a rocket company

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:29.120
 from like a propulsion company

1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:34.120
 from one person from two people to 10 people plus?

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:37.560
 Plus, and actually, you know,

1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:40.320
 take it to a successful product.

1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:44.520
 Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite,

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:48.480
 I'm not supposed to use the word easy

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:51.840
 when you work in rocket science, but straightforward.

1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:53.920
 When you're working on something, you know, sexy,

1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:57.360
 like an ion engine, it's more straightforward

1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:00.800
 to raise money and get people to come work for you

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.280
 because the vision's really exciting.

1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:04.640
 And actually that's something I would say

1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:09.640
 is very important throughout is a really exciting vision

1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:13.280
 because when everything, you know, goes to crap,

1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:16.560
 you need that to get people getting themselves out of bed

1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:20.480
 in the morning and thinking of the higher purpose there.

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:24.160
 And, you know, another thing along the way

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.440
 that I think is key in building any company

1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:31.120
 is the right early employees

1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:33.800
 that also have their own networks

1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:37.560
 and can bring in a lot of people that,

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:43.520
 you know, really make the whole greater

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:46.640
 than just the sum of the early team.

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:47.600
 And how do you build that?

1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:49.360
 Like, how do you find people?

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:52.400
 It's like asking like, how do you make friends?

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:55.920
 But is there, is it luck?

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:57.840
 Is there a system?

1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.520
 Like how in terms of the people you've connected

1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:05.440
 with the people you've built a company with,

1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:11.680
 is there some thread, some commonality, some pattern

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:15.720
 that you find to be, to hold for what makes a great team?

1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:21.320
 I think, you know, personally a thread for me

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:26.320
 has been my network and being able to draw on that a lot

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:30.480
 but also giving back to it as much as possible

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:32.480
 in like an unsolicited sort of way,

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:35.760
 like making connections between people that,

1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.040
 you know, maybe didn't ask,

1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:39.880
 but that I think could be really fruitful.

1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:44.880
 And even, you know, weirder than that is just really

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:49.920
 getting, you know, having weird, uncomfortable conversations

1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:51.680
 with people like at a conference

1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:56.680
 and getting over the small talk quickly

1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:57.640
 and getting to know them quickly

1:05:57.640 --> 1:06:00.000
 and having a relationship that stands out

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.680
 and then being able to call on them later because of that.

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:07.680
 And I think that's been because I'm introverted

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:10.680
 and I, you know, want to poke my eyes out

1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:12.680
 instead of go and do small talk.

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:15.680
 And so I huddle in a corner with one person

1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:18.680
 and, you know, we talk about aliens or things like that.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:21.680
 And so, you know, that's all to say that,

1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:23.680
 you know, having a strong network

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.680
 I think is really important, but a genuine one.

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:30.680
 And let's see, other ways to build a rocket company,

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:32.680
 kind of making sure you're paying attention

1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:34.680
 to the sweeping trends of the industry.

1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:36.680
 So everybody just cares about cost

1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:40.680
 and being able to get out ahead of that

1:06:40.680 --> 1:06:42.680
 and even more than we ever thought we'd need to

1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:45.680
 as far as what we needed to price our systems at,

1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:49.680
 you know, people for since the start

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:51.680
 of the US space industry,

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:55.680
 they've been paying 20, 25 million in adjusted dollars

1:06:55.680 --> 1:07:00.680
 for an ion engine and seeing that now people are going

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:04.680
 to want to pay 10K for an ion engine

1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:09.680
 and just staying out ahead of that and those kinds of things.

1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:11.680
 So, you know, being out in the industry

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:13.680
 and talking to as many people as possible.

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:15.680
 That's crazy. So there's a drive.

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:17.680
 I mean, I suppose SpaceX really pushed that.

1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:19.680
 It's frustrating for me.

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:23.680
 So SpaceX really pushed this,

1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:26.680
 the application of, I guess, capitalism

1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:30.680
 of driving the price down of basically forcing people

1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:34.680
 to ask the question, can this be done cheaper?

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:40.680
 This can lead to big problems, I would say,

1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:42.680
 in the following sense.

1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:45.680
 I see this in the car industry, for example,

1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:53.680
 that people have, it's such a small margin for profit,

1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:56.680
 like they've driven the cost of everything down so much

1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:59.680
 that there's literally no room for innovation

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:00.680
 for taking risks.

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:07.680
 So like cars, which is funny because not until Tesla really,

1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:10.680
 which is one of the, in a long, long time,

1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:13.680
 one of the first successful new car companies

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.680
 that's constantly innovating,

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:18.680
 every other car company is really pouring

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:21.680
 in terms of their technological innovation.

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:24.680
 They innovate on design and style and so on,

1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:27.680
 that people fall in love with the look and so on,

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:29.680
 but it's not really innovation.

1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:31.680
 In terms of the technology,

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:33.680
 it's really boringly the same thing

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:35.680
 and they're really afraid of taking risks.

1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:38.680
 And that's a big problem for Rocket Space, too,

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:40.680
 because if you're cutting out costs,

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.680
 you can't afford to innovate to try out new things

1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:48.680
 and that's definitely true with Ion Engine, right?

1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:54.680
 So how do you compete in this space?

1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:57.680
 Do you, by the way, see SpaceX as a competitor?

1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:00.680
 And what do you say in general about the competition

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:01.680
 in this space?

1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:05.680
 Is it really difficult as a business to compete here?

1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:08.680
 No, I don't see SpaceX as a competitor

1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:12.680
 and I see them as one day not too long from now

1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:15.680
 a customer, hopefully.

1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:18.680
 I mean, to compete against that,

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:22.680
 I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way.

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:27.680
 So bringing silicon MEMS manufacturing to propulsion,

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:30.680
 you know, NASA doesn't make Ion Engines

1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:34.680
 using a batch mass producible technique.

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:37.680
 They have one guy that's been making their Ion Engines

1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:41.680
 for 20 years bespoke pieces of jewelry.

1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:47.680
 So bringing things to what you're trying to innovate

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:50.680
 to make them, in our case, more cost effective

1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:52.680
 was really key.

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:55.680
 I like the idea of somebody putting out Ion Engines

1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:57.680
 on Etsy.

1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.680
 Yeah, my advisor at MIT would, you know,

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:01.680
 the thruster chip I was holding up,

1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:04.680
 he would wear one as a lapel pin.

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:08.680
 But in general, just on the topic of SpaceX,

1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:11.680
 you know, 2020 has seen some difficult things

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:14.680
 for human civilization.

1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:17.680
 And it's been a lot of, first of all, it's an election year.

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.680
 There's been a lot of drama and division about that.

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.680
 There's been riots of a little different reasons,

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:25.680
 racial division.

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.680
 There's been obviously a virus that's testing

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:30.680
 the very fabric of our society.

1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:33.680
 But there's been really, for me,

1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:36.680
 these super positive things, which inspiring things,

1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:45.680
 which is SpaceX and NASA doing the first commercial human flight,

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:49.680
 launching humans to space and did it twice successfully.

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:51.680
 What is that?

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:53.680
 Did you get to watch that launch?

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:56.680
 Did you, what does it make you feel?

1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:04.680
 Do you think this is first days for a new era of space exploration?

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.680
 Yeah, I did watch it.

1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:09.680
 We played it outside on a big screen at our place.

1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:12.680
 And I was a little, you know, they kept saying,

1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:14.680
 Bob and Doug, Bob and Doug.

1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:18.680
 And, you know, astronauts usually are treated

1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:20.680
 with a little bit more fanfare.

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:24.680
 So it felt very casual, but maybe that was a good thing.

1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:29.680
 Like this is the era of commercial crewed missions.

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.680
 It was a little bit more, what is it?

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:34.680
 What's his name?

1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:35.680
 Chris Hadfield.

1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:36.680
 Like playing guitar.

1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:37.680
 Yeah.

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:40.680
 It's more, it's a different flavor to it.

1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:41.680
 Yeah, exactly.

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:45.680
 More like fun, playful, celebrity type.

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:46.680
 Yes, exactly.

1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:51.680
 Astronaut versus the aura of the magical,

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:56.680
 sort of heroic element of the single human representing us in space.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:57.680
 Yes.

1:11:57.680 --> 1:11:58.680
 Yeah.

1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:00.680
 I think that's all for the better though.

1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:03.680
 It's so cool that it's such a common place thing now that we send,

1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:07.680
 you know, I can't believe that sometimes I'll have to,

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.680
 you know, you don't even realize that astronauts are coming

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:13.680
 and going all the time, you know, splashing back down.

1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:18.680
 And it's just so common now, but that's quite magical, I think.

1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:20.680
 So yes, we did watch that.

1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:24.680
 I love, love, love that we finally have that capability,

1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:28.680
 again, to send people to the space station.

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:33.680
 And it's just really exciting to see the private sector stepping up

1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:36.680
 to fill in where the government has pulled back in the US.

1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.680
 And I think pulled back way too soon as far as exploration

1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:43.680
 and science goes, probably pulled back at the right time

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:47.680
 for commercial things and getting that started.

1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:51.680
 But I'm really happy that it's even possible

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.680
 to do that with private money and companies.

1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:00.680
 Do you like the kind of the model of competition of NASA funding?

1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:03.680
 I guess that's how it works is like they're providing quite a bit

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:07.680
 of money from the government and then private companies compete

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:15.680
 to be the delivery vehicles for whichever the government missions

1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:16.680
 like NASA missions.

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:21.680
 Yes, I think for this type of mission is a little bit kind

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:25.680
 of straddles commercial and science.

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:31.680
 So I think it's good, but I do in general feel like we've pulled back

1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:36.680
 too much on, you know, NASA's role in the science and exploration part.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:42.680
 And I think our pace is too slow there, you know, for my liking, I suppose.

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:43.680
 What do you mean?

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:49.680
 Okay, so do you have, I mean, on the cost thing, do you feel like NASA

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:55.680
 was a little too bureaucratic in a sense, like too slow, too heavy,

1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:00.680
 cost wise in their effort, like when they were running things purely

1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:02.680
 without any commercial involvement?

1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:07.680
 So I suppose it's more that I just want the government to fund.

1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:08.680
 I see.

1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:14.680
 And maybe NASA's not the best organization to do it rapidly,

1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:19.680
 but I think that, you know, again, depending on the goals,

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:24.680
 we're just kind of at the very starting point of space exploration

1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.680
 and science and understanding.

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:31.680
 So we should be spending more money there and not less.

1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:34.680
 And other countries are starting to spend more and more,

1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:37.680
 and I think we'll fall behind because of that.

1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:40.680
 So you have quite a bit of experience, first of all,

1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:44.680
 starting a company yourself, but also I saw, maybe you can correct me,

1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:49.680
 but you have quite a bit of knowledge of just the, in general,

1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:53.680
 the startup experience of building companies that you've interacted with people.

1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:59.680
 Is there advice that you can give to somebody, to a founder,

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:04.680
 cofounder who wants to launch and grow a new company

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:09.680
 and do something big and impactful in this world?

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:10.680
 Yes.

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:14.680
 I would say, you know, like I mentioned earlier,

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:19.680
 but make sure the vision is something that, you know,

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:22.680
 will get you out of bed in the morning and will get,

1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:27.680
 and that you can rally other people around you to achieve.

1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:32.680
 Because I see a lot of folks that sort of cared about something

1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:35.680
 or saw a window of opportunity to do something

1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:39.680
 and, you know, startups are hard and more often than not.

1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:43.680
 Just being opportunistic isn't going to be enough

1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:48.680
 to make it through all the really crappy things that are going to happen.

1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:52.680
 So the vision just helps you psychologically to carry through the hardships,

1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:53.680
 you and the team.

1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:55.680
 Yeah, you and the team, yeah, exactly.

1:15:55.680 --> 1:15:59.680
 To kind of younger people interested in getting into entrepreneurship,

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:03.680
 I would say, you know, stay as close to like first principles

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:07.680
 and fundamentals as you can for as long as you can.

1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:11.680
 Because really understanding the problems, you know,

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:14.680
 if it's something scientific or hardware related,

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:19.680
 or even if it's not, but having a deep understanding of the problem

1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:22.680
 and the customers and what people care about

1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:25.680
 and how to move something forward is more important

1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:30.680
 than taking all of the entrepreneurship classes in undergrad.

1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:32.680
 So being able to think deeply, yeah.

1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:34.680
 Yeah, exactly.

1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:35.680
 Yeah.

1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:38.680
 Have you been surprised about how much like pivoting is involved?

1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:43.680
 Like basically rethinking what you thought initially would be the right direction to go?

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:49.680
 Or is there if you think deeply enough that you can stick in the same direction for long enough?

1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:55.680
 So our, you know, our guiding star hasn't changed at all.

1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:57.680
 So that's been pretty consistent.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:03.680
 But we, within that, we flip flop on so many things all the time.

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:09.680
 And, you know, to give you one example, it's do you stop and build a first product

1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:15.680
 that's well suited to maybe a smaller, less exciting segment of the market?

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:21.680
 Or do you stay head down and focus on, you know, the big swing

1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:24.680
 and trying to hit it out of the park right away?

1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:26.680
 And we've flip flopped between that.

1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:32.680
 And there's not a blanket answer and there are a lot of factors, but that's a hard one.

1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:39.680
 And I think one other piece for the aspiring founder,

1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:47.680
 spending a lot of time and effort on the culture and people piece is so important

1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:54.680
 and is always an afterthought and something that I haven't really seen

1:17:54.680 --> 1:18:00.680
 like the founders or executives that companies purposefully carve out time

1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:06.680
 and acknowledge that, yes, this is going to take a lot of my time and resources.

1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:10.680
 But you see them after the fact trying to repair the, you know, bro culture

1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:13.680
 or whatever else is broken at the company.

1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:15.680
 And I think that it's starting to change.

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:18.680
 But just to be aware of it from the beginning is important.

1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:19.680
 Right.

1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:23.680
 I guess it should be part of the vision of what kind of place you want to create

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:27.680
 or what kind of, like, human beings.

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:28.680
 Yeah, exactly.

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:34.680
 Like, you can't wait five, ten years and then just slap an HR person on to trying to fix it.

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:37.680
 Like, it has to be thoughtful from the beginning.

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:38.680
 Yeah.

1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.680
 Don't get me started on HR people.

1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:46.680
 Don't leave HR to HR people, but I'll just leave it at that.

1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:47.680
 You didn't say that.

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:48.680
 I said it.

1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:49.680
 Okay.

1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:50.680
 Yeah.

1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:53.680
 HR's actual HR is really important.

1:18:53.680 --> 1:18:55.680
 This is so important.

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:56.680
 Yes, but so important.

1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:57.680
 Culture is so important.

1:18:57.680 --> 1:18:58.680
 Yeah.

1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:05.680
 And then I also was surprised, like, I thought you could say, here will be our culture and

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:10.680
 our values and that it was kind of distinct from who I and my co founder were as people.

1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:12.680
 And I was like, no, that's not how that works.

1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:13.680
 Yeah.

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:17.680
 We just kind of like ooze out our behaviors and then the company grows around that.

1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:23.680
 So you have to do a lot of, like, introspection and self work to not end up with a shitty

1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:24.680
 culture.

1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:29.680
 It's kind of a, it's a, it's a relationship, but it's supposed to relationship with two

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:30.680
 people.

1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:31.680
 It's a relationship with many people.

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:32.680
 Yeah.

1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:35.680
 And you, yeah, you communicate so much indirectly by who you are.

1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:36.680
 You have to be.

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:37.680
 Yes.

1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:38.680
 You have to live it.

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:39.680
 Yeah.

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:45.680
 As somebody, I think about this a lot cause generally I'm full of love and all those

1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:46.680
 kinds of things.

1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:50.240
 But like, I also get like really passionate.

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:56.240
 And when I see somebody in the context of work, especially when I see somebody who I

1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:03.320
 know can do a much better job and they don't do a great job, I can lose my shit in a way

1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:07.000
 that's like Steve Jobsian.

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:10.800
 And you have to think about exactly the right way to lose your shit.

1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:15.440
 If you're going to, or if at all, you have to really think through that cause it sends

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:16.440
 a big signal.

1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:21.720
 You know, sometimes that's okay, like if you do it deliberately, like if you're going

1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:25.560
 to do it deliberately, if you're going to say like, I'm going to be the kind of person

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:29.440
 that allows this and pays the cost of it, but you can't just think it's not going to

1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:30.440
 have a cost.

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:31.440
 Yes.

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:37.800
 This was like the first thing I worked on with my leadership coach was to how not to

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:42.240
 just snap people when they were being an idiot.

1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:46.720
 And first I got really good at apologizing.

1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:51.880
 That was the first step because it was going to take longer to fix the behavior.

1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:56.280
 And then she, I've got, I'm actually a lot better at it now and it started with things.

1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:02.240
 She's like, every time you walk through a doorway, think, you know, calm and take breaths

1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:03.240
 before responding.

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:07.600
 And there were all sorts of these little things we did and it was mostly just changing the

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:08.600
 habit.

1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:09.600
 Yeah.

1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:10.600
 Yeah.

1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:13.000
 Oh boy, it's a long road.

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000
 Okay.

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000
 Yeah.

1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.320
 So people love it when we talk about books.

1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:23.600
 Is there books, maybe three or so, technical fiction philosophical that had an impact on

1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:26.560
 your life and you might recommend?

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:31.600
 And for each, is there an idea or so that you take away from it?

1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:32.600
 Yes.

1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:40.080
 So I've been a voracious reader all my life and I'm always reading like three or four

1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:44.840
 or five books at a time.

1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:51.280
 And now I use Audible a lot too and, you know, podcasts and things like that.

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:57.280
 So I think the first one that stands out to me is 10, it's a novel, Tender is the Night

1:21:57.280 --> 1:21:59.120
 by Fitzgerald.

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:04.080
 And I, I read it when I was much younger, but I went back and read it recently and it's

1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:10.760
 not that good, so I'm not sure why it has like such an important place in my literary

1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:16.920
 history, but I love Fitzgerald as an author because he's very, he has very like flowery

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:25.880
 prose that I can just picture what he's saying, but he does it in such a creative way.

1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:30.800
 I remember that one in particular because it, you know, I read a ton as a kid too, but

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:38.840
 it kind of set me is like the beginning of my adult reading life and getting into classics

1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:45.440
 and I kind of, I do feel like they seem intimidating maybe.

1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:50.960
 And then I realized that they're all just like love stories.

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:58.120
 So yeah, isn't everything, you know, yeah, it's really, even, you know, I don't know,

1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:03.680
 I was surprised that even like a lot of the Russian authors, you know, they're all just

1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:04.680
 love stories.

1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:08.560
 Which humans are pretty simple, there's not much to work with.

1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:09.680
 So I think maybe that was it.

1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:17.320
 It made like that whole world less intimidating to me and cemented my love for reading.

1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:23.160
 People should have just approached the classics like, there's probably a love story in here.

1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:27.720
 Somehow it boils down to a chick flick, so just relax and enjoy the ride.

1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:33.880
 And then changing gears quite a bit.

1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:37.480
 The beginning of Infinity, do you know it by David Deutsch?

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.920
 So he's a physicist at Cambridge or Oxford.

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:47.480
 And so I was introduced like more formally to a lot of the ideas, like a lot of the things

1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:55.280
 we've talked about, he has a lot more like formalism and physics rigor around.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:59.920
 And so I got introduced to, you know, more like jargon of how to think about some of

1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:11.120
 these ideas, you know, like memes and, you know, DNA as, as ultimate meme, the concept

1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:19.600
 of infinity and objective beauty, but he has a really strong grounding in physics.

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:23.440
 And then there's a rigorous way of talking about these like big topics.

1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:28.200
 So that was very mind opening to me to read that.

1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:32.920
 But it also, I think it's probably part of why I ended up marrying my husband is related

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:33.920
 to that book.

1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:38.240
 And then I've had some other really great connections with people because I had read

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:44.080
 it and so had they turn that, that book, even that book into a love story.

1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:45.080
 I did.

1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:46.080
 I know.

1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:47.080
 It's good.

1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:48.080
 It's good.

1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:50.760
 Your robot has a heart.

1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:58.880
 And okay, the third series is, it's just, it's Harry Potter, of course, which somehow

1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:01.160
 connects to, I haven't read Harry Potter.

1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:02.480
 I'm really sorry.

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:05.800
 I forgive me, forgive me.

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:10.040
 But I've read Tolkien, but just Harry Potter, just haven't, haven't gotten to it.

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:13.840
 But your company name is somehow, I think, connected to Harry Potter, right?

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:14.840
 Yes.

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:15.840
 I think they heard this.

1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:22.720
 I always feel like I have to justify my fandom.

1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:25.120
 The first three books came out when I was 10.

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:33.040
 So I went along this journey with Harry, age wise, and I read them all like nine or

1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.480
 10 times all seven books.

1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:41.720
 And I think anything that just keeps you reading is, is what's important.

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:44.640
 And you know, there, I have lulls where I don't feel like reading anything.

1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:51.480
 So I'll reread a Harry Potter or a, you know, trashy detective novel or something.

1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:52.480
 And I don't really care.

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:57.980
 And that's why I mentioned Harry Potter, because it, you know, whatever just keeps

1:25:57.980 --> 1:25:59.960
 me reading, I think is important.

1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:02.840
 And it was a big part of my life growing up.

1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:11.480
 And then yes, Axion, the official story of the naming of the company is that Axion is

1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:18.320
 like a concatenation of accelerate and Ion, but it actually came from Accio, the summoning

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:19.320
 charm.

1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:22.600
 And then we just added an N and it was perfect.

1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:23.760
 What's the summoning charm?

1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:32.440
 It's just one of the spells and yeah, probably most notably, Harry uses it to summon his

1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.800
 broomstick out of his dorm room when he's battling a dragon somewhere else.

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:40.200
 So he says the spell and the broomstick comes to him.

1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:42.320
 So summoning in that way.

1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:43.320
 Okay.

1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:44.320
 There we go.

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:45.820
 This is brilliant.

1:26:45.820 --> 1:26:50.680
 So the big thing is that it's something that you've carried with.

1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:51.680
 It's like your car.

1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:57.040
 It's your safe place you return to something like the Harry Potter that, you know, I reread

1:26:57.040 --> 1:26:58.800
 them still.

1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:02.920
 Whatever keeps me reading, I think is, is the most important thing.

1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:03.920
 Okay.

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:04.920
 I got it.

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.760
 So yeah, I'm actually the same way in terms of the habit of it.

1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:08.760
 It's important.

1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:12.760
 Yeah, it's important to just keep, keep reading.

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:18.200
 But I have found myself struggling a little bit to, because I listen to a lot of audiobooks

1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:19.200
 now.

1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:27.440
 I've struggled to then switch back to reading seriously, because just read so many papers

1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:29.080
 or read so many other things.

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:33.560
 It feels like if I'm going to sit down and have the time to actually focus on the reading,

1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:38.440
 I should be reading like blog posts or papers or more condensed kind of things.

1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:39.440
 Yeah.

1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:42.640
 But there, there's a huge value to just reading long form still.

1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:43.640
 Yeah.

1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:49.960
 And, you know, my husband was never that into fiction, but then someone pulled him or he

1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:55.240
 heard, you know, you learn a lot of empathy through reading fiction.

1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:56.440
 So you could think of it that way.

1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:57.440
 Oh yeah.

1:27:57.440 --> 1:27:58.440
 That's kind of what, yeah.

1:27:58.440 --> 1:27:59.440
 Yeah.

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:06.360
 And it's also fiction is a nice, unlike not less so with nonfiction is a chance to travel.

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:07.720
 I see this kind of traveling.

1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:08.720
 Yeah.

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:12.520
 As you go to this other world and it's, it's nice because it's like much more efficient.

1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:16.920
 You don't have to get on a plane, you don't have to, and you get to meet all kinds of

1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:17.920
 new people.

1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:21.280
 It's like people say they love traveling and I say I love traveling too.

1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:23.120
 I just, yeah, read fiction.

1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:31.040
 I told my three year old that, that was why we read so much because we, you know, see

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:35.720
 the places in our mind and I'm like, it's basically like we're watching a movie.

1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:36.720
 You know, that's how it feels.

1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:39.720
 And she's like, I prefer watching frozen with popcorn.

1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:43.400
 Was that your response that you're three?

1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:44.400
 Yeah.

1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:45.400
 That's a good point.

1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:46.400
 Yeah.

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:47.400
 But yeah, there's some power to the imagination.

1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:48.400
 Right.

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:53.160
 That's not just like watching a movie because some, something about of our imagination

1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:58.080
 because it's, it's the words in the world that's painted somehow mixing in with our

1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:03.920
 own understanding of our own hopes and dreams, our fears, it like mixes up in there in the

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:07.600
 way we can build up that world from just the page.

1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:08.600
 Yeah.

1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:13.080
 You're, you're really creating the world just with the like prompts from the book.

1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:14.080
 Right.

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:15.080
 Yeah.

1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:16.080
 Yeah.

1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:17.080
 That's different than watching a movie.

1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:18.080
 Yeah.

1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:20.080
 Which is why it hurts sometimes to watch the movie version and then you're like, that's

1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:23.840
 not at all how I imagined it.

1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:31.800
 Well, we kind of brought this up in terms of the, depending on what the goals are.

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:36.680
 Let me ask the big, your friends with Manolis, he's obsessed with this question.

1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:40.560
 So let me ask the big ridiculous question about the meaning of life.

1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:44.160
 Do you have, do you ever think about this one?

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:52.920
 Do you ever ponder the, the reason we're here, the sense of apes on this spinning ball in

1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:53.920
 the middle of nowhere?

1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:54.920
 Yeah.

1:29:54.920 --> 1:30:00.680
 I don't, I don't think one ends up in the field of space propulsion without thinking

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:03.920
 up these existential questions.

1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:04.920
 Yeah.

1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:05.920
 All the time.

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:06.920
 Or builds a business.

1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:07.920
 Yeah.

1:30:07.920 --> 1:30:08.920
 I know.

1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:09.920
 Right.

1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:10.920
 Yeah.

1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:13.920
 We've touched on a lot of the different pieces of this, I think.

1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:18.840
 So I, I have a bunch of thoughts.

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:27.760
 I do think that, you know, the goal isn't, the meaning isn't anymore just to be like a

1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:34.440
 petri dish of bacteria that reproduces and, you know, where survival and reproduction

1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:37.240
 are the main objectives.

1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:43.040
 And maybe it's because now we're able to answer these, ask those questions.

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:46.360
 That's maybe the turning point.

1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:53.280
 And instead, I think it's really the, the pursuit and generation of knowledge.

1:30:53.280 --> 1:31:00.680
 And so if, if we're taken out by an asteroid or something, I think that it will have been

1:31:00.680 --> 1:31:08.480
 a, you know, meaningful endeavor if somehow our knowledge about the universe is preserved

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:16.400
 somehow and the next civilization isn't starting over again.

1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:21.840
 So that, that's, that's, I always, yeah, I resonate with that.

1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:27.840
 I always loved the mission of Google from the early days of making the world's sort

1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:30.640
 of information and knowledge searchable.

1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:31.640
 I always loved that idea.

1:31:31.640 --> 1:31:37.000
 I was loved, I was donated as people should to Wikipedia.

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.440
 I just love Wikipedia.

1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:45.440
 I feel like it's the, it, that's one of the greatest accomplishments of just a humanity

1:31:45.440 --> 1:31:50.400
 of us together, especially Wikipedia and this opens like in this open community way, putting

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:54.400
 together different knowledge is like on everything we've talked about today, I'm sure there's

1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:59.160
 a Wikipedia page about ion engines and I'm sure it's pretty good.

1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:00.160
 Yeah.

1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:02.520
 Like it's, I don't know, that's, that's incredible.

1:32:02.520 --> 1:32:06.120
 And obviously that can be preserved pretty efficiently, at least Wikipedia.

1:32:06.120 --> 1:32:11.840
 I don't use, you'll be like, the human civilization is all like burning up in flames as there's

1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:16.640
 this one USB drive slowly traveling out, Wikipedia on it.

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:17.640
 Yeah.

1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:24.920
 That's on from the beginning of our chat that one lonely spacecraft, it just needs Wikipedia

1:32:24.920 --> 1:32:28.720
 and then it will have been a civilization well spent.

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:36.040
 So pushing that knowledge along through like one little discovery at a time is one of,

1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:39.400
 is a core aspect of the meaning of it, of it all.

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:40.400
 Yes.

1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:46.840
 And I also, I haven't yet figured out what the connection, you know, an explanation I'm

1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:55.280
 happy with yet for how it's connected, but evolving beyond just the survival piece too,

1:32:55.280 --> 1:33:03.320
 I think like we touched on the emotional aspect, something in there about cooperation and,

1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:04.320
 you know, love.

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:11.280
 And so I, in my day to day that just boils down to, you know, the pursuit of knowledge

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:16.800
 or improving the human condition and being kind.

1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:17.800
 Love and knowledge.

1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:18.800
 Yeah.

1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:19.800
 Exactly.

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:24.280
 So I'm pretty at peace with that as the meaning right now makes sense to me.

1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:27.280
 While you work on a spacecraft proposal.

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:28.280
 Yes.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:29.280
 Exactly.

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:31.760
 Like literal rocket science.

1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:34.160
 Natalia, this is amazing conversation.

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:37.040
 You work on such an exciting engineering field.

1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:43.200
 And I think this is like what 20th, 21st century will be remembered for is space exploration.

1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:47.480
 So this is exciting space that you're working on.

1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.160
 And thank you so much for spending your time with me today.

1:33:51.160 --> 1:33:52.160
 Thanks for having me.

1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:53.800
 This was fun.

1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:56.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Natalia Bailey.

1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:02.560
 And thank you to our sponsors, MonkPak Low Carb Snacks, Four Sigmatic Marshmallow Coffee,

1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:08.360
 Blinkist, an app that summarizes books, and Sunbasket, meal delivery service.

1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:13.320
 So the choice is snacks, caffeine, knowledge, or a delicious meal.
