00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
 The following is a conversation with Dan Gable from two years ago.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.840
 I did not previously publish this conversation as part of this podcast,

00:08.240 --> 00:12.920
 but as a separate thing. And as a result, it did not receive many listens.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.720
 Let me be honest and say that while I usually don't care about how many

00:17.720 --> 00:20.960
 listens or views something gets, in this one case,

00:21.200 --> 00:23.160
 I feel like I failed one of my heroes.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.120
 I feel I didn't properly introduce a truly special human being to an audience

00:28.120 --> 00:30.560
 that might find him as inspiring as I did.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.760
 Dan Gable is one of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.080
 Bigger than records and medals, to many like myself,

00:39.360 --> 00:44.720
 he's a symbol of guts, spirit, mental toughness and relentless hard work.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.440
 As a wrestler, he was undefeated in high school, undefeated in college

00:49.440 --> 00:53.080
 until his very last match. And having lost that match,

00:53.080 --> 00:58.200
 he found another level and became a world champion and an Olympic champion.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.840
 And most importantly, he did so perfectly dominating his opponents.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.920
 He did not surrender a single point at the 1972 Olympic Games.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.880
 As a coach, he led the Iowa Hawkeyes to 15 national titles

01:12.080 --> 01:14.480
 and 25 consecutive Big Ten championships.

01:14.760 --> 01:19.120
 He coached 152 All Americans, 45 national champions,

01:19.120 --> 01:24.080
 106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians, including eight medalists.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.800
 He's the author of several books, including A Wrestling Life One and Two

01:29.160 --> 01:31.280
 and Coaching Wrestling Successfully.

 As a side note, let me say that I spent a few days in Iowa

01:57.120 --> 02:01.720
 and got to attend a wrestling duel meet in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.960
 Part of me wanted to stay in Iowa forever to drill takedowns,

02:06.160 --> 02:08.760
 to start a family, to live life simply.

02:09.240 --> 02:13.400
 Wrestling is one of the pure sports, both beautiful and brutal.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.720
 We're both mental toughness and technical mastery

02:16.720 --> 02:19.840
 of the highest form, are rewarded with victory

02:20.040 --> 02:22.680
 and everything else is punished with defeat.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.960
 And every such loss weighs heavy on the minds of anyone who has ever stepped

02:26.960 --> 02:29.520
 on the wrestling mat, including myself.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.320
 The same is true for one of the greatest wrestlers in history of the sport,

02:34.520 --> 02:38.560
 the man who graciously welcomed me into his home for this conversation,

02:38.760 --> 02:40.720
 the legend, Dan Gable.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.960
 And now here's my conversation with Dan Gable.

02:55.960 --> 02:56.960
 You're persistent.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.160
 I love that because you've been trying to get me on this podcast for a long time.

03:00.360 --> 03:05.760
 And until I saw you on another podcast and you said you were Russian,

03:06.360 --> 03:07.360
 did I call you back?

03:07.560 --> 03:08.360
 Then it was over.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.960
 Because Russia, to me, is leading the world in wrestling almost every year.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.560
 What's the difference between American wrestling and Russian wrestling?

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
 You showed me this painting.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.760
 Well, it's MIT. It's science.

03:19.960 --> 03:20.760
 It's science.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.160
 And they really study the sport.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.560
 They're really good technically.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.760
 They're really, really good in strategy.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.560
 They don't really push like the real toughness.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.960
 They don't push like conditioning.

03:34.160 --> 03:34.760
 Right.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.560
 And so Americans, we need what they have.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.960
 Russians need what we have.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.560
 And when you get two together and for

03:43.560 --> 03:48.160
 and for me, why I could beat the Russians is because

03:48.360 --> 03:52.360
 I went their way a little bit, but I kept my toughness.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.360
 But you're known.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.760
 You're you're known for your toughness.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.760
 Yeah, but I wasn't known for my art.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.760
 I wasn't known for my science.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.760
 So when did you become a bit of an artist?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.360
 It took a loss.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
 The Larry Owens loss.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.360
 Most people thought I was already an artist just because I won 181 straight

04:09.360 --> 04:14.360
 in the dominance in seven years and not just winning, but, you know, kind of

04:14.560 --> 04:15.560
 punishing people.

04:15.760 --> 04:15.960
 Yes.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.960
 And from from that point of view, yeah, I might have been pretty good, but I had a

04:20.160 --> 04:24.360
 long ways to go yet and I didn't really realize that or I should have.

04:24.560 --> 04:29.160
 I should say I didn't really know how to get it out of me until I had a loss.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.560
 And then I realized I got to buckle down, learn some of that science, become more

04:33.760 --> 04:34.360
 of an artist.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.560
 How do you become an artist?

04:35.560 --> 04:42.560
 So that the Russian way has this drilling technique, thousands of reps.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.360
 How do you how do you think you work on the science, the art part?

04:46.560 --> 04:49.760
 You got to study the best in the world.

04:49.960 --> 04:56.960
 I think Dave Schultz was our guy in America that probably showed us that being

04:57.160 --> 04:59.160
 artistic, you needed that.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
 And he studied it.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.360
 He went over there as a high schooler and Russell in some major tournaments over

05:04.360 --> 05:07.960
 there and he saw their ways.

05:08.160 --> 05:13.960
 He used that Russian science and then he was already an American and he saw what

05:14.160 --> 05:18.760
 how I trained athletes, he saw what I did in the Olympics, saw what other people,

05:18.960 --> 05:21.760
 how we held up and he applied that as well.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.960
 But I'd have to say he was more of the artistic type.

05:25.160 --> 05:30.160
 He was more of a Russian than an American when it came to wrestling.

05:30.160 --> 05:36.160
 You've coached 45 national champions, 106 big 10 champions and eight Olympic

05:36.360 --> 05:39.160
 medalists, which is incredible.

05:39.360 --> 05:47.160
 What is a common thread between them and what are maybe some of the fundamental differences?

05:47.360 --> 05:53.360
 I think the common thread is that

05:53.560 --> 05:58.760
 they all had one of those two avenues that we talked already.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.760
 And because we intertwined them.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.960
 So in a Russian wrestling room, they got the same people.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.160
 Most of the time in an American wrestling room, we had the same people.

06:08.360 --> 06:14.760
 But when I was out recruiting, at first I recruited just attitude.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.560
 But I needed more than that.

06:16.760 --> 06:24.960
 I needed some genetics in that wrestling room to actually that hard work people,

06:24.960 --> 06:32.560
 you know, they could look and see, wow, that execution, that's unbelievable.

06:32.760 --> 06:37.160
 But yet I can beat that guy after the first minute.

06:37.360 --> 06:43.560
 So you think the art, the technique is genetics, you're born with it.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.560
 You think it's not something.

06:44.760 --> 06:50.160
 I think your pop and your, you know, your ability to move timing and timing

06:50.360 --> 06:53.160
 and your quickness and your strength.

06:53.160 --> 07:01.360
 You know, the Russians, they usually picked out the people that can go into that sport.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.760
 That was the old fashioned sports school.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.360
 But it's mostly like when you see, when you walk into a Russian wrestling room,

07:08.560 --> 07:11.760
 you see him hitting skills, techniques.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.960
 You know, you don't see him banging against each other that much.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.760
 But then when practice is over, you might not see a bunch of sprints.

07:18.760 --> 07:24.760
 You might see him walk over to the ropes and they drop down from the ceiling

07:24.960 --> 07:27.960
 and they'll jump up and climb a rope, boom, boom, boom.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.360
 And then they come down and then they don't jump right back on.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.560
 They have three or four other guys go and then they jump back on.

07:34.760 --> 07:40.560
 Whereas I probably made my guys climb them, get right back down, climb them right back again.

07:40.760 --> 07:46.360
 But I also realized that I had to have a mix of that.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.360
 What was the role?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.360
 What was your role?

07:48.360 --> 07:53.160
 I mean, those guys looked up at Dan Gable and what was the role in helping these

07:53.360 --> 07:55.560
 athletes become their best, these national champions?

07:55.760 --> 07:58.560
 First of all, prove that you were.

07:58.760 --> 08:03.360
 Knew what you were doing in terms of technique or in terms of everything, everything.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.560
 They just you had to be the first guy there and the last guy to leave.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.760
 And you had to be the most dedicated guy, even though they were the ones just trying

08:09.960 --> 08:14.200
 to win the championships, you had to prove that you were going to work just as

08:14.400 --> 08:15.560
 hard as they were as a coach.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.760
 And what does that look like?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.960
 So you can see it when you know it when you see it?

08:20.160 --> 08:24.760
 Well, you're there ahead of them and you're there after they leave.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.560
 You know, it's that simple.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.560
 I'm picking up after them and you're analyzing them.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.160
 You all work them.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.160
 You all work them and you all think them.

08:34.360 --> 08:39.560
 And so, you know, use that type of strategy and over time when you prove it works

08:39.760 --> 08:45.560
 because some of my kids that were the best kids in the world.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.360
 Really shouldn't have been a wrestler.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.360
 I mean, they weren't very coordinated.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.560
 Yeah, but they worked so hard to develop themselves.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.360
 What was your role in that process?

08:58.560 --> 09:01.360
 I mean, that means pushing kids to their limit.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.560
 If you're not you can't push kids to their limit.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.360
 And even when you push them to their limit, that's not their limit because their limits

09:08.560 --> 09:09.360
 above and beyond that.

09:09.560 --> 09:14.760
 I mean, yeah, coaches sometimes accidentally don't they lose kids.

09:14.760 --> 09:18.760
 Yeah, because of the heat, because of hard work and all that.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.360
 And you got to you got to know where to when to back off.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.160
 You got to read your athletes.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.760
 And by that, I mean, you got to know them pretty well.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
 Every once in a while, you make a little bit of a mistake.

09:30.160 --> 09:35.360
 But if you don't react right on that mistake before it gets too far, then it's going to be a casualty.

09:35.560 --> 09:40.560
 And I don't mean somebody dying necessarily, but maybe something that could turn them off

09:40.560 --> 09:46.160
 or maybe something that can run them away or maybe something that, wow, that was close.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.560
 It maybe shouldn't have pushed them that far.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.160
 So you really have to be very educated.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.160
 And it's not just what you know.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.960
 It's what you know about them.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.560
 And I'm not talking about the team.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.960
 I'm talking about each guy.

09:59.160 --> 09:59.960
 Individuals. Yeah.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.160
 Each person on the team.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.560
 And you you know it.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.560
 How you see it in their eyes because you're the first one there and you're the last one to leave.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.560
 And and you set in the environment with them.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.560
 You're there for in the morning for practice.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.960
 Sometimes they're there in the afternoon for two or three hours after practice.

10:16.160 --> 10:21.360
 You might have a a hot room or you might have a sauna or a steam or a whirlpool.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.360
 And you get in there with them and you listen.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.360
 You know, you're not just feeding out information.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.960
 You do that, but you're taking in a lot of that too.

10:31.160 --> 10:36.360
 And I'm telling you, when you get in an atmosphere that they're relaxed and they feel comfortable.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.160
 It's like a massage.

10:38.360 --> 10:42.760
 And that's after practice in one of those areas that people are around you.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.160
 You learn a lot.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.160
 I mean, you got a lot to learn as a coach.

10:46.360 --> 10:51.960
 And when you get in that atmosphere, when all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable,

10:52.160 --> 10:53.960
 words start flowing.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.960
 And when those words flow,

10:57.160 --> 11:01.960
 you take them in as a coach and there's something probably going to be said

11:01.960 --> 11:06.760
 that you can do and act upon that's going to help certain situations.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.760
 I've saved a couple of kids lives for sure that were on the brink.

11:10.960 --> 11:17.560
 You know, sometimes performance is at such a high level in a high level atmosphere

11:17.760 --> 11:21.160
 that life and death is actually involved.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.960
 And I don't mean pushing a kid to where he just dies.

11:24.160 --> 11:29.960
 But I mean, he might feel himself as a failure and he might go home and take his own life.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.760
 Yeah, I mean, but that's part of it.

11:31.960 --> 11:36.760
 You're putting so much heart, so much blood and heart and sweat and everything.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.160
 Your whole meaning of life becomes winning.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.560
 So and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context.

11:43.760 --> 11:49.360
 So if in your, I think the first wrestling life you wrote about Chad Zapato,

11:49.560 --> 11:55.360
 who lost, I mean, incredible wrestler, but lost in three finals in the nationals

11:55.360 --> 11:59.960
 and has this tattoo of a hawk clawing out the human heart.

12:00.160 --> 12:06.560
 Yeah. So what lessons is there any lessons from the incredible wrestling he's done,

12:06.560 --> 12:10.960
 but also the incredible suffering that he went through on himself?

12:11.160 --> 12:14.560
 Yeah, again, you like that word suffering, which is OK.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.760
 OK, no, no, no, no, no, no, keep it.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
 Yeah, because it fits right in where I want.

12:18.960 --> 12:25.360
 Yeah, I have to turn that suffering around to where he makes him feels good about himself

12:25.560 --> 12:28.560
 or better, doesn't have to feel perfect.

12:28.760 --> 12:29.960
 Yeah, because he did lose.

12:30.160 --> 12:35.760
 Yeah, you know, and so, but you have to actually get him to realize that.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.760
 Yeah, he's still unique compared to the walk of the earth.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.360
 He was unbelievably unique right at the top, just a little bit short of.

12:43.360 --> 12:49.760
 But because it was, you know, he felt the suffering, you now have to go about

12:49.960 --> 12:52.560
 and change that and put it into goodwill some way.

12:52.760 --> 12:57.160
 And because he's you really have a lot of goodwill, you can do a lot of goodwill.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.360
 And so and it's not easy.

13:00.560 --> 13:09.360
 It took him probably years, years of tattooing, years of covering the tattoos.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.360
 And, you know, he told me move to California, I go, why are you moving to California?

13:13.560 --> 13:17.160
 Because he was here for a couple of years after his wrestling was done,

13:17.360 --> 13:21.160
 because he had a good job around here and he's I thought he was doing a good job.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.560
 But he just he said, I had to escape.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.760
 You know, same as the company tattoo.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.160
 I had a wrestling terminology.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.160
 I have to get I hate to say this.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.760
 I hate to say this.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.560
 I go, where are you going?

13:33.760 --> 13:36.760
 He said, I'm going to go to California.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.560
 And I go, is there any reason why you go into California?

13:41.760 --> 13:48.360
 He says, that's where everybody goes to hide.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.960
 But I said, I think you're wrong there.

13:51.160 --> 13:56.760
 But, you know, I think what will determine your life will be what you do for now on.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.960
 You know, and if you can find and he's actually turned it around.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.160
 I mean, he's actually turned around.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.560
 You have to discover that yourself.

14:02.560 --> 14:07.560
 Exactly. And he went someplace that he thought he could fit into.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
 And I think he did.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.160
 And I think he's got a good job and he's helping people and

14:13.360 --> 14:18.160
 he covered that tattoo with feathers, another tattoo.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.360
 Well, in the end, it's a beautiful story.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.360
 Yeah, it is. It really is.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.560
 Suffering and overcoming.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.760
 Yeah. And he's not done yet.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.560
 He's not done yet.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.360
 No, he's not done.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.560
 He's he's got a lot more to do.

14:29.560 --> 14:34.360
 So you mentioned Roger Bannister, again, I think in your first book.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.760
 Somebody you looked up to, that's the man who broke the four minute mile, right?

14:39.960 --> 14:43.160
 When everybody said it was impossible, everyone thought it was impossible.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.360
 Oh, they thought you would die.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.760
 He would die. It's not human.

14:45.960 --> 14:46.960
 It's not humanly possible.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.760
 Yeah. So what?

14:48.960 --> 14:50.560
 Well, you've done your homework.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.760
 For what? The book? Or what?

14:51.960 --> 14:53.360
 Oh, I don't know. For me, you've done your homework.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.560
 Yeah, I know. But yeah, sitting here by Putin to do research.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.760
 Yeah. So what lesson do you take from that story for yourself?

15:02.960 --> 15:05.360
 The impossible, trying to accomplish the impossible?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.160
 Well, the impossible is possible.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.560
 It's just that simple. Time changes things.

15:11.760 --> 15:18.160
 I mean, I mean, if you looked at what where the mile time is right now,

15:18.360 --> 15:22.360
 compared to that four minute mile, which when it was broke by a couple

15:22.360 --> 15:29.360
 of tenths or three or four tenths, it's now broke by another 20 seconds.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.760
 Right. Yeah.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.560
 By 700 people, yeah.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.760
 Yeah. I mean, by tons of people.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.160
 And it's pretty much the common knowledge that you got to run a four minute

15:38.360 --> 15:40.760
 mile if you're going to go somewhere now or below.

15:40.960 --> 15:45.360
 If you're going to win events at major level, you got to be able to do that.

15:45.560 --> 15:51.360
 And so you can take that and you can look at what

15:51.360 --> 15:57.560
 in time history has as its record performance.

15:57.760 --> 16:02.360
 And you can realize that that record performance is going to change.

16:02.560 --> 16:02.960
 Yeah.

16:03.160 --> 16:07.960
 And they don't take into all the factors of knowledge.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.160
 They don't take into all the factors of better shoes.

16:12.360 --> 16:16.560
 They don't take in all the factors of better understanding of nutrition.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.360
 I mean, it's like me as an athlete.

16:21.560 --> 16:26.960
 I went to practice every day in high school for at least my sophomore and my

16:27.160 --> 16:29.960
 junior and part of my senior year.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.360
 And all of a sudden a new rule came up.

16:33.560 --> 16:39.560
 I said, the rule said before that said,

16:39.760 --> 16:45.360
 at least most of the coaches, we don't want you drinking water at practice.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.360
 Yeah.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.760
 And OK, why?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.160
 Because you got to toughen you up.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.960
 That's a weakness water.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.960
 And so we would go through practice.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.360
 I mean, and you're sweating and then you're sweating so much that you're almost out of sweat.

16:59.560 --> 16:59.960
 Yeah.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.760
 And so you're mostly at the end of practice.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.360
 You're not even wrestling.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.160
 Excuse me.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.960
 You're you're sitting against the wall because you're tired.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.760
 So then all of a sudden they say, OK, go ahead and drink water during practice.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.160
 Drink greater aid during practice.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.960
 And all of a sudden at the end of practice, we're still out there competing.

17:18.160 --> 17:23.560
 And so I look at my career for two and a half years where I end my junior high too.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.360
 So I got another three years

17:26.560 --> 17:32.160
 where I didn't really wasn't able to push as good as I could because I just was probably under.

17:32.360 --> 17:32.960
 Under hydrogen.

17:33.160 --> 17:33.560
 Yeah.

17:33.760 --> 17:33.960
 Yeah.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.360
 So what so but at the individual level in terms of the impossible,

17:38.560 --> 17:43.160
 when did you first believe the thing that maybe probably people would laugh at you?

17:43.160 --> 17:46.360
 About that you would be an Olympic champion.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.760
 Well, I always visualized me being the best.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.360
 You believed it in the very forever, forever.

17:53.560 --> 17:58.960
 Yeah, I was because I was I don't know if you call it a dreamer or somebody that

17:59.160 --> 18:04.960
 I was just involved with competitive sports at the YMCA from from age five.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.760
 Did you tell people that dream that you're going to be Olympic champion one day?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.160
 You can be the best in the world.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.960
 I think they knew.

18:11.960 --> 18:16.560
 And the only reason why they knew because there was something a little different about this guy.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.360
 He was he's not going to stop.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.960
 Well, he was out in the yard and he was swinging baseball bats.

18:22.160 --> 18:22.560
 Yeah.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.160
 You know, at six, at seven and eight and nine and ten.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.960
 And he was swinging baseball bats.

18:29.160 --> 18:34.560
 So much right handed and so much left hand with nobody even there throwing the ball.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.360
 That all of a sudden when they walk by,

18:36.560 --> 18:40.760
 they all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt on both sides.

18:40.760 --> 18:48.560
 So it's like they saw me out in the yard playing by myself sports or, you know,

18:48.760 --> 18:51.360
 or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.160
 But if they weren't there, you know, if you walked in my front room,

18:55.360 --> 19:01.760
 I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback and I was running not and running through the through the furniture.

19:01.960 --> 19:02.760
 You know, that type of stuff.

19:02.960 --> 19:08.560
 So, you know, who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.360
 And the coaches at the YMCA level, the junior high level,

19:12.560 --> 19:15.160
 they saw this guy come first and end up last.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.160
 But I wasn't that great.

19:18.360 --> 19:23.760
 I wasn't the fastest guy at that time and I wasn't the strongest guy.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.560
 You know, actually, before I went to the Olympics, when they tested me,

19:26.760 --> 19:30.560
 they tested everybody and I probably came back with one of the highest scores.

19:30.760 --> 19:37.960
 But it was it was not like the highest person on this and this and that.

19:37.960 --> 19:42.760
 I was all high across the board, straight across the board, high on every one of them.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.560
 But there was always people that were higher than genetics, but then they would go down.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.160
 Then they would test on something else and go back up.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.760
 Mine stayed high all across the board.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.760
 And so I, you know, I really didn't have too many flaws,

19:55.960 --> 20:00.160
 but I didn't have any things that also said that you were going to be

20:00.360 --> 20:02.160
 unscored upon at the Olympic Games.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.560
 Right. So take me through that day, if you could.

20:05.560 --> 20:10.760
 1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram freestyle wrestling gold,

20:10.960 --> 20:15.160
 you scored 57 points, if I'm correct.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.360
 I had zero points scored on you, 57, zero.

20:19.560 --> 20:23.560
 So maybe take me through almost the details.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.560
 What was your routine?

20:24.760 --> 20:25.560
 What was your process?

20:25.760 --> 20:28.360
 What was going through your mind, your thoughts of that day?

20:28.560 --> 20:34.960
 Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day because we wait in every day.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.360
 At that time.

20:36.560 --> 20:40.360
 And that, and that, yeah, we wait in two hours before the start of the competition.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.560
 And so that doesn't mean that you wait in two hours for your rustle

20:43.760 --> 20:46.360
 because you didn't know whether you're going to wrestle right away or later on.

20:46.560 --> 20:51.560
 In fact, in that day, I don't think I wrestled until later on in the evening.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.360
 So I had all day to recover, but I didn't really need it anyway

20:55.560 --> 20:58.560
 because, you know, I wasn't really pulling a whole lot away.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.160
 But just, it was just interesting.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
 But what was in your mind?

21:02.560 --> 21:03.360
 What were you thinking?

21:03.360 --> 21:04.960
 Were you nervous?

21:05.160 --> 21:06.560
 I was confident.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.560
 I was confident.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.160
 You knew you're going to win the gold.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.960
 Yeah, I knew I was going to win.

21:11.160 --> 21:15.760
 But in reality, I didn't know it from a cocky point of view.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.560
 I only knew it because for the last

21:21.760 --> 21:26.760
 three and a half years, I had been going to practice.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.960
 And I'd win in every practice.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.560
 And I hardly ever lose a takedown.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.360
 And if I lost this, if somebody scored on me,

21:35.560 --> 21:41.360
 it was like when I went to bed, I couldn't sleep until I figured it out.

21:41.560 --> 21:46.160
 Or if I didn't figure it out, I would fall asleep.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.960
 And I would be, I would wake up with the answer of what I needed, why I got scored upon.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.960
 So maybe now that you've won the gold, can you tell me in the practice room

21:55.160 --> 21:59.960
 if somebody took you down, how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?

21:59.960 --> 22:02.160
 Well, timing, very difficult.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.560
 But yes, somebody could.

22:04.760 --> 22:08.960
 Because they were going for one move.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.760
 All I wanted was one move.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.960
 Whereas, you know, if you can arrest somebody and arrest them,

22:12.960 --> 22:16.160
 the whole practice or half of practice for at least 10, 15 minutes.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.960
 And they were maybe going to score.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.560
 If they could work it in their mind.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.160
 But they knew that was going to be their victory.

22:27.160 --> 22:31.560
 So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.760
 And that when you're going for the Olympic gold,

22:34.960 --> 22:37.760
 you didn't want to allow any takedowns.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.760
 So there's no such thing as working on some kind of weird position,

22:40.960 --> 22:42.360
 a weak point or something.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.360
 It's important to not let down on the takedown.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
 It's kind of like what we were saying before.

22:47.760 --> 22:52.360
 If something happened and somebody scored on me in a certain way,

22:52.560 --> 22:56.560
 I would go over that situation, over that situation, over it again.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.960
 And I would come up with an answer and then I would actually test it.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.160
 Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day

23:03.360 --> 23:06.960
 because I didn't want the guy to, you know, do not have some.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.960
 I didn't want him to think that I was thinking about it all night.

23:09.960 --> 23:10.760
 I didn't tell him.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.760
 But maybe three days later, when he wrestled again,

23:13.960 --> 23:19.760
 I actually had it figured out because he wasn't able to.

23:19.960 --> 23:24.160
 Or even if I was in on a takedown, an offensive move

23:24.160 --> 23:29.560
 and I got stopped and didn't score, you know, I had to go back and filter that.

23:29.760 --> 23:33.560
 But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve.

23:33.760 --> 23:33.960
 Right.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.560
 I could usually solve it.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.960
 Let's go back to the Olympic game.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.960
 So I get up in the Olympic in the morning

23:39.160 --> 23:45.160
 and I'm not sure when the Wayans were, but I think I was probably a pound over.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.960
 You know, and that's about a half a kilo and one point one pounds is a kilo

23:48.960 --> 23:50.160
 because we wouldn't kilograms.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.360
 So what do you do with that pound?

23:51.360 --> 23:55.360
 You are off or no, I just I just went over to the had a sauna there

23:55.560 --> 24:02.960
 and I got in the sauna and the funny thing was the morning of the of the of the finals.

24:03.160 --> 24:08.760
 There was there was another athlete in the sauna.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.560
 And it was American or no, it was a European.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.560
 I didn't I don't remember where she was from.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.560
 Not a Russian.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.560
 Well, you know what?

24:16.560 --> 24:21.560
 I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.360
 Interesting.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.160
 And she didn't have her top on.

24:24.360 --> 24:24.960
 Oh, wow.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.360
 And that was pretty common.

24:28.560 --> 24:34.960
 And so, you know, it's kind of interesting you think back about it because

24:35.160 --> 24:40.560
 there's some funny things that that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games,

24:40.760 --> 24:44.160
 in world games, anytime when you have country against country.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.560
 And so there's some crazy stuff that goes on.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.560
 Yeah, did any of it affect you?

24:48.760 --> 24:49.560
 Did you was there any?

24:49.760 --> 24:54.560
 Well, I almost stayed too long in the sun.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.360
 You lost a little bit over a pound, a little more than a pound.

24:57.560 --> 24:57.960
 Yeah.

24:58.160 --> 25:03.760
 But but it didn't really bother me because I wasn't like I wasn't like cutting a lot of weight.

25:03.960 --> 25:08.560
 So so your match against the Russian, the Azulayev.

25:08.760 --> 25:13.360
 Yeah, Azulayev went on to be a two time world champion and silver medalist as well.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.160
 I mean, this is an incredible wrestler.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.560
 So what was going through your mind before stepping on the mat with that guy?

25:20.760 --> 25:24.160
 You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers, haven't had a point scored on you.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.960
 And you're stepping on the mat against the Russian who you said was really they picked

25:29.160 --> 25:30.960
 the Soviets picked to beat you.

25:31.160 --> 25:31.560
 Right.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.560
 And I know why they picked him because he had a great attitude.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.360
 So he wasn't just the typical artist.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.560
 He was a good artist.

25:39.560 --> 25:44.760
 He hooked elbows like Sadjulayev and he's from that area of the world

25:44.960 --> 25:47.160
 where they have some of those types of moves.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.760
 But he was and he was a goer.

25:49.960 --> 25:54.560
 But by cutting him down a weight, he lost some of that go.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.960
 And I don't know if you got it.

25:57.160 --> 26:00.360
 That's a process you got to go about scientifically.

26:00.560 --> 26:00.960
 Yeah.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.560
 You know, and so, you know, if you don't do it as an American,

26:04.760 --> 26:06.160
 it can really hurt your performance.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.960
 If you don't do it as a Russian, it can hurt your performance.

26:08.960 --> 26:14.760
 And they already didn't really do that a lot where usually wrestled the weight

26:14.960 --> 26:16.760
 where it was more like your weight.

26:16.960 --> 26:22.760
 And so by cutting him down, you know, maybe slowed his belief down a little bit.

26:22.960 --> 26:23.760
 You saw it in him.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.160
 The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.960
 Yeah, but then he came back and he won, you know, rest of the matches and he was

26:30.160 --> 26:34.160
 in the round robin and he was able to go to the finals.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.360
 But he had lost another match actually against in the round robin against the

26:38.360 --> 26:38.960
 Japanese.

26:39.160 --> 26:46.360
 So I think I had already gained enough of artistic being able to finish a match

26:46.560 --> 26:48.560
 once I lost my match in college.

26:48.760 --> 26:52.360
 For the last two years, I took on some of that artistic work.

26:52.560 --> 26:59.360
 And I think that he was already hoping to win, but he was hoping to win by a long

26:59.560 --> 27:05.760
 ways because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points to be able to win the gold.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.560
 And, you know, that wasn't going to happen.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.360
 I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.560
 Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?

27:13.760 --> 27:17.360
 Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?

27:17.560 --> 27:23.560
 I can't remember too many that I took that would actually put me in a danger position.

27:23.760 --> 27:29.360
 I've taken risk, but the risks were so scientifically technically correct that I

27:29.560 --> 27:32.560
 wouldn't land in that danger zone.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.960
 It's like, if I'm going to lock up and throw you, I'm not going to throw you to

27:36.160 --> 27:37.960
 my own back and roll you through.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.960
 I'm going to turn in the air.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.360
 So you were scientific about it.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.560
 Yeah, exactly.

27:42.760 --> 27:46.960
 I, you know, it just I learned the hard way early on.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.760
 There was moves from collegiate wrestling that you did that exposed your shoulders,

27:51.960 --> 27:57.360
 which it cost me in some early freestyle matches against great wrestlers.

27:57.360 --> 28:03.960
 But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves to where I hit a

28:04.160 --> 28:07.760
 Grammy roll where you expose your shoulders and you lose two points every time.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.160
 But you learn that that's not the system.

28:10.360 --> 28:17.160
 But if you hadn't wrestled much, you would get exposed under maybe a desperate

28:17.360 --> 28:18.560
 situation, you would hit it.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.360
 So you won the gold.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.160
 How did it feel?

28:22.360 --> 28:26.400
 I think it would have, I think the question would be, how would it feel if you

28:26.400 --> 28:32.120
 lost the gold for me because I already went through that once.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.640
 Not at that highest level, but the national collegiate championship level

28:35.840 --> 28:38.720
 my senior year, the Larry Owens loss, Larry Owens, yeah.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.240
 And that didn't set well.

28:40.440 --> 28:45.200
 Were you afraid of that happening again at the Olympic level?

28:45.400 --> 28:45.880
 Was that?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.160
 No, I really wasn't.

28:47.360 --> 28:55.040
 But it was why I changed my philosophy of training and added to

28:55.040 --> 28:57.480
 the scientific artist type.

28:57.680 --> 29:01.480
 And if I had won that match, even though I wouldn't have felt good about it,

29:01.680 --> 29:06.640
 even if I squeaked it out, I wasn't feeling good about that match.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.320
 It would have affected me a little bit.

29:09.520 --> 29:12.080
 But if I'd have won it, I would have got over it.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.280
 I mean, I'm not over it now.

29:14.480 --> 29:18.880
 I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff right before my match.

29:19.080 --> 29:19.280
 Yes.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.880
 By that, I mean, this kind of stuff, talking interviews, yeah, journalists.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.920
 Yeah. And I really wasn't a good talker.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.040
 I mean, me and you are talking pretty good right now, except for I got a little cold.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.400
 But but I don't think I could say two words hardly then.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.200
 And they took takes.

29:35.400 --> 29:40.000
 Wide world of sports says, hey, just we want you to be the introduction for our

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
 next week's show.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.920
 So just say, hey, I'm Dan Gable.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.880
 Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated 182 and all.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.240
 That's what they want me to say.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.680
 Everybody assumed you'd be undefeated.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.280
 And I said it.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.280
 I had to take it 22 times.

29:52.280 --> 29:56.720
 And in the last two or three times, they wrote it out and I read it.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.040
 And it still wasn't like I just said it.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.640
 I was reading it like, hi, I'm Dan Gable.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.840
 Come come on.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.200
 You know, that type of stuff.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.840
 So it and he finally just closed the book and said, yeah, that's good enough.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.440
 But I turned and it was my time to wrestle.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.120
 Yeah.

30:13.320 --> 30:20.080
 And so, you know, you just you learn that for me, it was great coaching experience

30:20.080 --> 30:24.080
 because that's what I turned into be, you know, I coached for longer than I

30:24.280 --> 30:27.880
 wrestled and I put out a lot of champions.

30:28.080 --> 30:33.160
 But you learn through mistakes that even in your own career that you had made,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.960
 you know, it's it's it's an ever learning process.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.280
 It's an ever learning process.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.760
 Have you ever been afraid on the map?

30:40.960 --> 30:44.240
 Does fear have any role, do you think?

30:44.440 --> 30:48.560
 For a wrestler or it must be I'm sure fear is out there.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.960
 And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.560
 I'm sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.800
 He had these doubts.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.440
 He probably had these doubts.

30:58.640 --> 31:02.480
 And that gives gives me the the edge.

31:02.680 --> 31:08.960
 And I don't know if I really ever had fear.

31:09.160 --> 31:14.040
 But obviously there was points in times where I didn't perform as well.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.680
 Not many, but a few.

31:17.680 --> 31:22.880
 And if I look back at it, look back at it, I don't think it was that.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.800
 American, you know, raw, raw, raw stuff.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.600
 I think it was probably the fear of.

31:30.800 --> 31:35.840
 Not being an artist as much, you know, maybe this guy might be better than me

31:36.040 --> 31:40.040
 scientifically and, you know, you're a scientist.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.280
 I think that got to me more than anything else.

31:43.480 --> 31:47.320
 I said early on that I want to eliminate ever happened

31:47.320 --> 31:49.560
 to worry about getting tired in a match.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.400
 So I kind of eliminated that.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.160
 So I got rid of that point.

31:53.360 --> 31:59.040
 And I do think that in wrestling, that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers

31:59.240 --> 32:04.600
 have, actually how they feel during the match and and do they get are they going

32:04.800 --> 32:08.120
 to get tired and and is it going to affect my performance?

32:08.320 --> 32:12.680
 And as a coach, that really was one of the things I tried to eliminate on all my

32:12.680 --> 32:17.560
 athletes, so there wasn't that fear factor, but that fear factor would be

32:17.760 --> 32:23.000
 put upon my opponent, which would give me an edge.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.440
 But that's not what I needed as much.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.480
 I needed to just focus, make sure that I was doing the right things.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.080
 And I needed my team to be focused.

32:30.280 --> 32:34.880
 So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete or even as a coach sometimes

32:35.080 --> 32:38.240
 that I didn't repeat them, didn't repeat them.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.120
 And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it,

32:41.120 --> 32:45.440
 then it's like you didn't learn anything.

32:45.640 --> 32:49.960
 You go throughout your wrestling career as you've beautifully put was to work

32:50.160 --> 32:52.160
 so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?

32:52.360 --> 32:53.920
 That you would be carried off the mat.

32:54.120 --> 32:58.120
 So you never did successfully in that's one of the ways you failed in your

32:58.120 --> 33:01.200
 career is you've never worked so hard that you've passed out.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.600
 Have you ever come close?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.640
 Do you remember a time that you've come close?

33:04.840 --> 33:07.040
 You've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?

33:07.040 --> 33:12.360
 You know, the question is really a good question about that pushing to you collapse.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.920
 Yeah, because I don't as a coach today, I don't think I get if I said that to my

33:17.120 --> 33:24.080
 athletes, I don't know, I could get in trouble because, you know, it's understood,

33:24.280 --> 33:26.480
 isn't it, by the athletes?

33:26.680 --> 33:28.800
 Yeah, they understand it.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.920
 But the outside might not understand it because it's almost like,

33:32.920 --> 33:36.840
 what do you mean they're you push them to the point where they go collapse?

33:37.040 --> 33:39.800
 I mean, they may die or something might happen to them.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.880
 And, you know, that's dangerous.

33:41.880 --> 33:42.640
 That's dangerous.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.120
 We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere.

33:45.320 --> 33:49.160
 But it's something that's highly unlikely that's going to happen.

33:49.160 --> 33:52.880
 But I'm going to tell you, there's many times in a practice where I had pushed

33:53.080 --> 33:57.960
 myself to all of a sudden the whistle blew or it was time to stop.

33:57.960 --> 34:04.080
 And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at and I needed water,

34:04.280 --> 34:09.520
 I need I needed fresh air because you're usually in a fairly small room with a

34:09.720 --> 34:14.640
 lot of guys that the heat rises and and you know, it's hard to breathe.

34:14.840 --> 34:19.400
 And that I can remember and I stayed a lot of times, not by the door at the far end

34:19.400 --> 34:23.400
 of the room, I can remember walking from the far end of the room to that door.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.760
 And I can remember, am I going to make it the next step?

34:26.760 --> 34:28.640
 Am I going to make it the next step?

34:28.840 --> 34:32.800
 I need air, I need water, I need oxygen, I need to get out of here.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.320
 It didn't happen often, but I can recount four or five times in my career

34:37.520 --> 34:41.920
 that I pushed myself to that level where I thought I was going to maybe go out.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.440
 But every step I was dizzy.

34:44.640 --> 34:50.040
 But once I got to that door, I was able to open it and go out and grab the water

34:50.240 --> 34:51.920
 and get cold water in my face.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.840
 And so, no, I never really was able to do that.

34:54.840 --> 35:00.280
 And I think the story is in a book where my my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.320
 I made you proud.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.160
 Oh, my gosh, you know, and she didn't win.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.840
 Yeah, but she pushed a collapse.

35:06.040 --> 35:06.280
 Yeah.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.400
 Now, did she suffer because of that?

35:10.600 --> 35:13.800
 Well, she didn't get to go to the next event because she didn't.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.160
 She had to qualify, but I think it probably helped her to realize

35:19.160 --> 35:22.120
 and because she was winning the race and she was beating people she normally never

35:22.120 --> 35:25.680
 pushed, but she was at a new level that she had never been before.

35:25.680 --> 35:28.360
 And she only needed about five feet to finish.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.600
 And it was just one of those things that I bet there was a lot of learning that she

35:32.800 --> 35:37.280
 did there, and it probably made her realize that she could be better.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.040
 But she had to hold up, though.

35:40.240 --> 35:46.600
 So you mentioned in Wrestling Life that the Brans brothers looked up to Roy

35:46.600 --> 35:52.440
 Salger, who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling, but not getting too rough.

35:52.640 --> 35:57.480
 So how do you find the line between extreme physical wrestling, but at the same

35:57.680 --> 36:00.640
 time, not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?

36:00.840 --> 36:05.040
 So that line between aggression, tough wrestling and anger.

36:05.240 --> 36:09.440
 Well, I think anger would cause

36:09.640 --> 36:11.480
 less successful wrestling.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.880
 I think anger would cause you to make

36:13.880 --> 36:17.920
 mistakes and actually get out of position.

36:18.120 --> 36:22.360
 Because I think anger is kind of a loss of control.

36:22.560 --> 36:31.440
 And there can be a furious type of attack.

36:32.200 --> 36:36.720
 But I think if it crosses the line to anger,

36:37.120 --> 36:39.400
 then you're going to be vulnerable.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.120
 And so.

36:42.120 --> 36:49.440
 Royce and the Brans wrestled to the edge through the edge.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.160
 But when the whistle blew, they stopped.

36:52.360 --> 36:56.400
 And there's people that when the whistle blows, they keep going.

36:56.600 --> 37:02.520
 It's like in a football game, a fight breaks out and it's after the whistles blow.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.200
 Well, when the whistle blew, they they backed off.

37:07.200 --> 37:13.480
 So that whistle was something that in a match.

37:13.680 --> 37:17.760
 That that kind of gave them the boundaries.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.040
 But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.960
 So in Wrestling Tough, the book that you just got from Mike Chapman, the new edition,

37:25.160 --> 37:31.760
 talks about Bill Cole, undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler and how he talked about

37:31.960 --> 37:36.600
 how my strength, speed and ability to think were increased tremendously by just

37:36.600 --> 37:40.960
 sitting apart from the action prior to the match and getting into a state of

37:41.160 --> 37:46.640
 controlled anger, so can anger controlled.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.480
 So anger could be fuel as long as it's controlled.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.760
 Right, exactly.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.480
 You had that line.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.880
 One side of the line, you can have an anger for performance.

37:57.080 --> 38:02.120
 And the other side of the line, you if you go beyond that, it's not going to be for

38:02.320 --> 38:06.280
 performance, it's going to be for not performance because you're going to lose points.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.440
 It's a fine line.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.400
 There's definitely a fine line.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.400
 You're talking about Roy Selger.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.000
 You're talking about Tom Brands.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.560
 You're talking about Terry Brands.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.640
 I mean, you got World Championship titles there.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.200
 You got Olympic Championship title there.

38:18.400 --> 38:23.400
 You got a World Silver Medalist in in in Roy Selger.

38:23.600 --> 38:28.640
 And, you know, that's what when I talk to him about the World Silver

38:28.840 --> 38:34.480
 Medalist, he's haunted by that because he was actually 20 seconds away from

38:34.480 --> 38:36.840
 winning when he got beat in the end there.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.320
 But that's part of the game.

38:38.520 --> 38:44.920
 And it's I don't know whether he's OK with it or not, because he says after

38:45.120 --> 38:49.200
 talking about things, he goes, I'm OK with it now.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.200
 But then he keeps talking about it.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.720
 So I don't really think he's OK with it.

38:54.920 --> 39:00.840
 And it's it's hard for him to actually make amends to himself

39:01.040 --> 39:02.320
 when you really don't do it.

39:02.320 --> 39:07.120
 I mean, it's no matter what the situation, even with the Owings loss.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.040
 Yeah, it still eats it.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.840
 I mean, yeah, I'm a world champion.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.000
 He's not and he wanted to be.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.480
 I'm an Olympic champion.

39:14.680 --> 39:17.960
 He's not. He wanted to be one of the greatest coaches of all time.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.240
 Yeah. Yeah.

39:19.440 --> 39:25.400
 And so, you know, so he, you know, it's like, why do I keep going back to it?

39:25.600 --> 39:30.000
 Because because you're not you don't get over those things.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.520
 So Royce really keeps going back to it, even though he says he's fine.

39:33.720 --> 39:39.120
 And and but then he realizes he's really not fine, because that's just the nature

39:39.320 --> 39:43.520
 of the game, and that's why he was able to win national titles and and make

39:43.720 --> 39:46.520
 world teams and and stuff like that.

39:46.720 --> 39:51.120
 You know, even if what's interesting about him, he's analyzed all the people

39:51.320 --> 39:55.360
 that he's wrestled and a lot of them have one world and Olympic championships.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.560
 And he's beaten every one of them at one time or another.

39:58.560 --> 40:03.040
 And he didn't get to that world championship gold or Olympic gold.

40:03.240 --> 40:08.040
 And that he says it because they did it.

40:08.240 --> 40:14.040
 So he's showing people that that I beat in those guys.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.800
 But apparently he didn't beat him at the right time.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.360
 And so it's still haunting.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.280
 You don't get away from that stuff.

40:22.480 --> 40:27.120
 I mean, it's just like anything in life that's really high.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.920
 I mean, it doesn't have to be athletics.

40:30.120 --> 40:35.440
 I mean, do you think I'm ever going to get over the murder of my sister?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.880
 And you might not even know that.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.080
 Let me pause for a second, please.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.200
 You've talked about it, you've written about it.

40:41.400 --> 40:45.400
 So I hope it's OK for me to say that your sister, your older sister,

40:45.600 --> 40:52.680
 on May 31st, 1964, was raped and murdered by a local boy.

40:52.680 --> 40:58.960
 So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day, did they ripple through your

40:59.160 --> 41:03.800
 life still, through your wrestling, through your coaching, through your the way

41:04.000 --> 41:06.120
 you when you wake up in the morning?

41:06.320 --> 41:08.600
 What is that like?

41:09.920 --> 41:15.120
 It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.400
 And.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.640
 And it can be the mood I'm in.

41:20.840 --> 41:21.320
 Right.

41:21.320 --> 41:26.360
 You know, it can be maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew or or maybe if I've had a

41:26.560 --> 41:36.360
 Gable beer or or or or or maybe if you turn the country music up a little bit loud.

41:36.560 --> 41:43.000
 You know, emotions come out and everybody has them in their life.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.000
 It's just so happens.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.520
 You know, what brings it out?

41:46.520 --> 41:51.960
 And hopefully it's nothing that you do to the extreme point of to where it brings

41:52.160 --> 41:53.760
 it out. For me, it's not extreme.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.640
 I don't have to have any of that, really.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.480
 I can get emotional.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.440
 How did that change you as a man?

42:02.040 --> 42:07.080
 What it did was realize that I was already.

42:07.280 --> 42:13.520
 Pretty well developed because I was only a sophomore, 15 years old in high school.

42:13.520 --> 42:20.280
 And I had parents that weren't making it and my parents are a lot older than me.

42:20.480 --> 42:24.960
 And now that we're down just to me and my parents and I'm going to be around the

42:25.160 --> 42:31.640
 house for another two years and they had just lost a daughter that was the only

42:31.840 --> 42:34.640
 other simply.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.840
 They weren't handling it.

42:38.040 --> 42:42.680
 They were the ones that were suffering much more than me.

42:42.680 --> 42:49.920
 Even though I always look back upon one area that I wasn't good at was communication

42:50.120 --> 42:55.040
 at that time, except inside the resident room, because I had been tipped off.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
 And tipped off.

42:56.440 --> 42:57.160
 What do you mean?

42:57.360 --> 43:01.760
 Well, the neighbor boy said that something to me about my sister just three weeks

43:01.960 --> 43:07.800
 before that, that really wasn't normal or practical.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.160
 And I said nothing to nobody.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.680
 You don't.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.840
 Is there a part of you that blames yourself?

43:16.040 --> 43:19.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.560
 Absolutely.

43:21.760 --> 43:27.000
 But I'm 15 years old and you make mistakes.

43:27.200 --> 43:32.040
 And you don't really act on everything that happens in your life.

43:32.240 --> 43:36.320
 But I can tell you how it affected me and I acted a lot on

43:36.520 --> 43:39.240
 anything that maybe wasn't even of that consequence.

43:39.240 --> 43:42.800
 I mean, because I had four daughters and I'm telling you, when they left every time

43:43.000 --> 43:47.480
 to go somewhere in a car or go out with someplace, I always said something to them.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.560
 And they would always say, dad, you said that last night.

43:50.760 --> 43:55.840
 I don't care what like I love you or I'd say, I'd say, like, don't be driving

43:56.040 --> 44:02.040
 and drinking or or don't be in a car with somebody that's, you know, of the of the

44:02.240 --> 44:06.120
 same nature or, you know, stay out of trouble, you know, don't go be somewhere

44:06.120 --> 44:09.480
 where you, you know, you have, I said, you know how to get out of a car if you

44:09.680 --> 44:13.720
 if your car goes into the river, you know, I just, you know, I'm always

44:13.920 --> 44:19.080
 thinking ahead a little bit just in case of something did happen.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.360
 And it goes back to that goes back to that

44:21.560 --> 44:25.360
 walk to school with that with that young man that when he was talking to me and I

44:25.560 --> 44:28.160
 just I took it and I kept it inside me.

44:28.360 --> 44:32.880
 And once I found out she had been murdered,

44:32.880 --> 44:36.720
 it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes.

44:36.920 --> 44:40.760
 And I told my dad, I think I know who killed her.

44:40.960 --> 44:45.720
 And he looked at me and he just like, he slapped me, actually.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.200
 He pushed me against the car.

44:47.200 --> 44:47.800
 He didn't slap me.

44:47.800 --> 44:48.360
 He pushed me against the car.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.240
 My mom slaps me and she was the one that slapped me around a little bit.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.960
 But my dad, he he pushed me against the car.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.040
 What do you mean you might know something about this?

44:57.240 --> 44:59.680
 I said, dad, I don't for sure.

44:59.680 --> 45:06.160
 But and I would probably all crying, but and I don't I doubt if I was crying yet.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.480
 I've probably cried a lot of tears since.

45:08.680 --> 45:14.720
 But but, you know, I just said, hey, I was walking to school with this neighbor.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.560
 And I never had walked to school with him before.

45:17.760 --> 45:20.480
 And he was kind of a troubled kid.

45:20.680 --> 45:25.760
 And he said something about Diane and it wasn't good.

45:25.960 --> 45:29.320
 But I I didn't he goes, why didn't you say something?

45:29.320 --> 45:32.800
 I said, dad, I just boy talk, you know.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.200
 So, you know, and so he hugged me, he hugged me, he hugged me.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.480
 And, you know, it was one of these things that

45:40.680 --> 45:43.880
 it's definitely made me

45:44.080 --> 45:47.880
 a lot of who I am because there's been a lot of choices.

45:48.080 --> 45:50.720
 And I don't I took the word choice out of my life.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.160
 And I just like to say, OK, do the right thing.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.240
 Do the thing that you should do.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.200
 And so I don't really it's like, are you going to do this or this?

45:58.200 --> 46:00.520
 Well, what do you mean? Which one's better?

46:00.720 --> 46:03.120
 You know, well, then I'm so I don't have that choice.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.000
 Yeah, just give me the right way to go.

46:05.200 --> 46:08.160
 And so I thought that I'd been perfect by any means,

46:08.360 --> 46:13.720
 but it's made a big difference in my life on how I handle my life.

46:13.920 --> 46:17.960
 It's probably given me the opportunity to be married for 44 years.

46:18.160 --> 46:22.360
 It's just given me opportunities to be better in my life.

46:22.560 --> 46:26.560
 And and I, you know, I want to thank my sister for that.

46:26.560 --> 46:29.160
 You know, it's

46:29.360 --> 46:34.880
 and I think my family was ready to make a split because of that incident.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.160
 They're blaming each other.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.600
 And I think that

46:39.800 --> 46:40.840
 I was able to help.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.040
 But more than that, they really liked each other,

46:43.240 --> 46:47.360
 but they didn't really know it at the time until I got out of the house.

46:47.560 --> 46:51.840
 Two years later, it probably was going on for a couple of years until I moved on

46:52.040 --> 46:55.040
 and went to college, then they found out they really liked each other

46:55.040 --> 46:58.440
 when they were alone and it worked out pretty good.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.720
 But I think them being able to follow me,

47:01.920 --> 47:07.840
 not just through college and the Olympics and worlds, but my coaching.

47:08.040 --> 47:11.920
 So it's the same, the same success and factor, you know,

47:12.120 --> 47:16.560
 the excitement and all those things gave them a real purpose.

47:16.760 --> 47:22.800
 And it gave my four daughters, it gave my wife, you know, a real purpose

47:22.800 --> 47:26.960
 to be able to be close to all these champions and championships.

47:27.160 --> 47:31.720
 And and now it's because now it's like there's a family of twenty two

47:31.920 --> 47:34.560
 and they're all interested in what what we're interested in.

47:34.760 --> 47:36.240
 And it's going good, knock on wood.

47:36.440 --> 47:40.080
 But, you know, it's something that when all of a sudden you got too much time in

47:40.080 --> 47:44.920
 your hands and you're not doing and accomplishing much, that things probably.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.840
 You know, get off, get off track.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.080
 What do you think is the role of family in wrestling?

47:49.280 --> 47:50.680
 Can a man do it alone?

47:50.680 --> 47:55.240
 And if not, where's family most important?

47:55.440 --> 47:58.040
 You know, you could do it alone.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.320
 But why would you want to?

48:00.520 --> 48:05.200
 Yeah, I think the chances of doing it alone are much less than the chances of doing

48:05.400 --> 48:07.600
 it together. Yeah.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.240
 I know they say, don't bring your profession home.

48:10.440 --> 48:15.480
 Sometimes they say that I never I never got away from my profession.

48:15.480 --> 48:21.200
 Yeah. And, you know, sometimes I it's like my house right here.

48:21.400 --> 48:26.200
 So when I'm moving home, I'm not going to have an office because I'm not going to

48:26.400 --> 48:31.480
 coach anymore or I'm not going to be an assistant athletic director for a while.

48:31.680 --> 48:36.240
 That you got to do something that.

48:37.800 --> 48:41.320
 Gives you a little bit of a break, not you necessarily, maybe the person you're

48:41.520 --> 48:44.280
 living with. And so I don't know if you looked outside there.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.800
 I got a cabin right on my backyard.

48:45.800 --> 48:46.920
 You probably can't see it right there.

48:47.120 --> 48:48.560
 But what's in the cabin?

48:48.760 --> 48:51.480
 That's my house away from my house.

48:51.680 --> 48:56.800
 It's only 30 feet from my house and it's my office and it's my workout room.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.280
 It's my I got a sauna there.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.760
 It's a bed upstairs if I need it.

49:00.960 --> 49:05.240
 If I ever get too close and she says, hey, why don't you go sleep in the other house?

49:05.440 --> 49:07.000
 But, you know, it kicks me out of the bed.

49:07.200 --> 49:07.960
 But get the heck out.

49:08.160 --> 49:08.960
 It's never happened.

49:09.160 --> 49:11.440
 But I do spend a lot of time out there.

49:11.440 --> 49:16.000
 And it's, you know, you got to have a little distance sometimes.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.560
 And you got to know your, I don't know your role.

49:18.760 --> 49:22.000
 And so all of a sudden when you're a guy that's been gone your whole life from

49:22.200 --> 49:25.360
 eight oclock in the morning till close to seven, three or eight oclock at night.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.000
 So 11, 12 hours a day.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.920
 Then all of a sudden you're not gone as much, even though you still work.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.040
 She's trying to slow me down now.

49:32.040 --> 49:35.680
 I'm doing not so much like here, what we're doing right now, but when I get in

49:35.880 --> 49:40.200
 the car and drive somewhere or fly somewhere, you know, like just last night,

49:40.200 --> 49:43.760
 I just went to bed and I hadn't told her that this guy called me and he wants me

49:43.960 --> 49:49.680
 to speak for a bit, want to build another wrestling wants to start another

49:49.880 --> 49:53.640
 wrestlers and business networking out in.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.120
 Delaware, because we don't have any colleges in wrestling in Delaware.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.000
 And so I said, well, you know, I'm gladly that because that's my life, you know.

50:01.200 --> 50:06.320
 So, but then all of a sudden I, I didn't say to my wife until all of a sudden this

50:06.320 --> 50:11.000
 morning and I told her that I might go on the Friday the 21st of December.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.200
 Oh, no.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.720
 Well, well, I said, that's not Christmas.

50:14.920 --> 50:20.040
 She goes, we're celebrating Christmas that weekend early because a lot of the family

50:20.240 --> 50:23.240
 can't be here except for that weekend.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.840
 And I said, oh, well, that's not going to work.

50:26.040 --> 50:28.560
 But I kind of didn't say anything to her at first.

50:28.760 --> 50:32.400
 And then she, well, I'll tell you, she started getting a little emotional.

50:32.400 --> 50:36.600
 And if I want to stay married for another year, 45 years,

50:36.800 --> 50:45.960
 then I better tell those people that I got family obligations because

50:46.160 --> 50:47.720
 you got to depends what's most important.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.760
 I love wrestling.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.920
 I love wrestling.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.600
 And I want to start another help or start another

50:52.600 --> 50:53.720
 wrestlers and business network.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.640
 But there's more than one day in Gable out there.

50:55.840 --> 50:56.480
 Well, maybe not.

50:56.680 --> 51:01.840
 But, but, but there's a lot of people that are

51:01.840 --> 51:05.040
 maybe even closer and they got big names.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.760
 I mean, we're we're doing pretty well right now.

51:06.960 --> 51:12.000
 I mean, we got first two years ago and we got second this year.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.280
 And then we got the women's freestyles doing good in wrestling.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.360
 We got to work a little bit on our Greco yet.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.960
 But, but they are working on it.

51:20.160 --> 51:25.200
 But our men's freestyle team right now are are excellent.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.840
 And, you know, and

51:27.840 --> 51:32.360
 the key for them is to get them all on the same page

51:32.560 --> 51:35.720
 instead of just have new highlights.

51:35.920 --> 51:39.080
 And by that, I'm saying who you look and see who won this year.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.840
 Well, the three guys that have never won before won this year.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.000
 We had three world champions.

51:43.200 --> 51:46.760
 Our two past world champions.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.880
 Didn't win this year.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.720
 I mean, they they did OK.

51:49.920 --> 51:51.120
 You know, they got medals.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.520
 The borrows win.

51:52.720 --> 51:53.880
 No, he did not.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.240
 He got third.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.040
 Oh, that's right.

51:56.040 --> 51:56.680
 He got bronze.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.800
 Yeah. And so July got, I mean,

51:59.000 --> 52:00.040
 Snyder got second.

52:00.240 --> 52:05.600
 So those two are our main guys, you know, so the three new guys that came through

52:05.800 --> 52:08.480
 were guys that hadn't won world gold.

52:08.680 --> 52:11.120
 In fact, two of them have never made a world team before.

52:11.320 --> 52:13.960
 And so we have three world champions this year,

52:14.160 --> 52:18.200
 but we needed all five of them to come through to win the championships.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.880
 And so the key really is

52:21.080 --> 52:26.080
 getting them all to do the same at the same time year in and year out and not

52:26.080 --> 52:31.720
 just based on, OK, borrows got beat this year, so he'll win next year.

52:31.920 --> 52:34.640
 It's got to be every year if you're capable of doing that.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.520
 And that's what the coaching staff has to do.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.760
 It's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence,

52:38.960 --> 52:43.240
 actually, on the coaching staffs right now at the USA level, because the women's

52:43.440 --> 52:48.800
 freestyle guy is Terry Steiner and he wrestled for me as a national champion.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.080
 He's got a twin brother that's at Fresno State.

52:52.080 --> 52:57.880
 And then Billy Zaddick is the freestyle coach and he wrestled for the Hawkeyes

52:58.080 --> 53:02.000
 back in the early days and he was the national champion.

53:02.200 --> 53:07.960
 So we got a lot of former Gable influence on there, but but it's got deep roots in

53:08.160 --> 53:14.200
 that in 2013, the International Olympic Committee, IOC voted wrestling out of the Olympics.

53:14.400 --> 53:19.760
 So a lot of folks know about this, the absurdity of it and so on.

53:19.760 --> 53:23.400
 But in a big picture, you can step back now, it's five years later.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.440
 What did you learn from that experience?

53:26.640 --> 53:28.920
 Well, first of all,

53:29.120 --> 53:30.840
 did it surprise me?

53:31.040 --> 53:32.560
 Yeah.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.320
 But did it really surprise me?

53:35.520 --> 53:37.520
 No.

53:38.600 --> 53:42.480
 You've got to run, you've got to have people running

53:42.680 --> 53:47.760
 the organization that are top notch.

53:47.760 --> 53:51.000
 If you take anything for granted

53:51.200 --> 53:57.280
 and you're not the person of authority, somebody can kick you out.

53:57.480 --> 54:02.360
 And even though we had a lot of authority because we're wrestling, we're one of the

54:02.560 --> 54:10.800
 first sports in the Olympics ever and that we think that, you know, we're in 180

54:10.800 --> 54:19.720
 some countries and some of the number one countries in the world that are politically

54:19.920 --> 54:23.400
 strong, have the sport, you know, we thought we were OK.

54:23.400 --> 54:27.760
 But then you got to look and see who's running the IOC.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.040
 The IOC, the International Olympic Committee.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.400
 Yeah.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.840
 And then you got to see that

54:35.040 --> 54:37.360
 in wrestling, we don't have anybody in there.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.120
 I mean, that shocked me.

54:39.120 --> 54:43.400
 We've never had anybody on the IOC from wrestling.

54:43.600 --> 54:44.680
 You know why?

54:44.880 --> 54:47.840
 Because we didn't have to.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.040
 But yes, that's wrong.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.560
 You have to.

54:51.760 --> 54:58.200
 And if you don't have somebody looking out for you right within the structure,

54:58.400 --> 55:00.920
 then it's pretty easy people turn their head.

55:01.120 --> 55:05.560
 But all it took was

55:05.760 --> 55:08.400
 the statement you guys are kicked out of the Olympics.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.440
 You guys are done.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.640
 Everybody came together.

55:10.840 --> 55:15.400
 And then well, yeah, I think it's the first time in ever in history that probably

55:15.600 --> 55:22.200
 all this competitive people that were working for their own agenda.

55:22.400 --> 55:26.240
 Turn that agenda to the sport.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.640
 And so that made a big difference.

55:28.840 --> 55:29.760
 And we got a lot done.

55:29.960 --> 55:37.240
 In fact, in America, there was several people that were

55:37.240 --> 55:42.280
 really out there that we didn't know about until this point in time.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.720
 And when they came aboard,

55:44.920 --> 55:47.480
 now they're still aboard.

55:47.680 --> 55:51.760
 That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect because just because we got voted

55:51.960 --> 55:54.400
 back in before we even got kicked out, really.

55:54.600 --> 55:58.080
 That doesn't mean we're by any means safe.

55:58.280 --> 56:01.880
 We have to do some of the things that I'm talking about or the some of the things

56:02.080 --> 56:03.480
 that we didn't do before.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.720
 We can't fall right back into the same mess.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.760
 Yes. And so our leadership got changed

56:08.960 --> 56:13.040
 and it's better, but it's got to stay better.

56:13.240 --> 56:20.840
 But there are things that we could still be doing to make sure that we don't have

56:21.040 --> 56:22.720
 situations like this happen.

56:22.720 --> 56:26.120
 I tell you, when I first learned about it, I was like,

56:26.320 --> 56:28.880
 I broke down and wept again.

56:29.080 --> 56:33.920
 It's like every once in a while, I'll break down and cry about

56:33.920 --> 56:37.400
 my sister or I'll break down.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.160
 I don't know if I cry about losing the oinks, but

56:40.360 --> 56:43.960
 I probably get more determined, but that's kind of

56:44.160 --> 56:47.800
 you have to go back and think about those moments when you heard.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.760
 When I heard that moment and I

56:50.960 --> 56:54.000
 I said, it just overcame me.

56:54.200 --> 56:57.680
 It was like four oclock, four thirty in the morning when I heard about it.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.680
 And my wife had been up looking at the internet and she woke me up and I thought

57:01.680 --> 57:04.920
 she was joking, but I jumped out of bed really quick.

57:04.920 --> 57:09.120
 When she said that, I knew she was serious and I started making phone calls

57:09.320 --> 57:11.960
 right then to find out if it was true.

57:11.960 --> 57:15.000
 And when I found out it was true, it was just like devastating.

57:15.200 --> 57:19.840
 You know, and it was one of these things that it's a nightmare.

57:20.040 --> 57:23.760
 And but you don't let it happen again.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.760
 It's that simple.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.600
 Yeah. And you keep getting stronger.

57:27.800 --> 57:28.760
 Yeah.

57:28.760 --> 57:33.280
 And if people haven't read, they should read The Loss of Dan Gable by Ray Thompson,

57:33.480 --> 57:37.920
 the ESPN article that kind of in this very beautiful poetic way.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.720
 Ties together

57:40.920 --> 57:46.520
 all the losses of Dan Gable, the losing your sister, losing to Larry Owens,

57:46.720 --> 57:53.640
 losing wrestling from the Olympics, all of these tragedies of various forms.

57:53.840 --> 57:56.800
 So so that's the IOC.

57:56.800 --> 57:59.840
 There's politics and you're sort of being very pragmatic.

58:00.040 --> 58:04.720
 But stepping back, wrestling is one of the oldest forms of combat period.

58:04.920 --> 58:08.200
 Dating back, there's cave drawings 15,000 years ago.

58:08.400 --> 58:14.640
 And if you look at the ancient Olympics, the Greek Olympics, 2700 years ago,

58:14.840 --> 58:18.840
 did you ever, when you wrestled or coached, do you now

58:19.040 --> 58:22.240
 see wrestling in this way of freestyle and folk style wrestling?

58:22.440 --> 58:26.480
 The purity of sort of two human beings locked in combat.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.160
 The the roots of that is just human beings,

58:30.360 --> 58:34.120
 this fair struggle between two men or two women.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.400
 I don't think I ever

58:36.600 --> 58:38.920
 looked at it.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.040
 As anything but just a combat.

58:43.240 --> 58:45.120
 And.

58:46.520 --> 58:49.920
 I think there's times that have made me

58:50.120 --> 58:53.120
 figure out how to make that combat better.

58:53.120 --> 58:59.720
 There's little markers or little points in time in your life

58:59.920 --> 59:02.480
 that make you.

59:02.680 --> 59:07.400
 Wonder or it should say determined.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.680
 To be able to get more out of yourself

59:10.880 --> 59:13.760
 and to be able to take it to a new level.

59:13.960 --> 59:19.000
 And I don't think people can actually feel that way unless you've actually had

59:19.200 --> 59:21.520
 a lot of accomplishments in anything.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.080
 I think there's anything out there.

59:23.280 --> 59:26.880
 I mean, no matter what sport or breaking the four minute mile.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.200
 I mean, when you broke that, when they broke that,

59:29.400 --> 59:31.280
 Roger Bannister broke that four minute mile.

59:31.480 --> 59:36.880
 I can't imagine him breaking it from his best time being four thirty.

59:37.080 --> 59:39.160
 You know, it's one of these things that

59:39.360 --> 59:45.160
 along the line there that he did had some close calls

59:45.360 --> 59:50.160
 or he had some coaching that was giving him the opportunity to become a little

59:50.160 --> 59:56.840
 better, but I think because he was doing well and being very successful.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.320
 That the opportunity came.

59:58.520 --> 1:00:00.720
 And so for me, it's like the same thing.

1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:04.720
 I had so much success

1:00:04.920 --> 1:00:13.840
 and so many practices that went well and so much goodness out of this sport.

1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:22.560
 That it gave me the opportunity to really look more finite and look more how I

1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:23.720
 can even make it better.

1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:30.520
 And so it's like if you look at my library upstairs, I got a library upstairs.

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:33.960
 And there's a lot of books up there

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:35.200
 from the family.

1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:38.960
 And but if you look at the Gable books up there,

1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:44.000
 I got a lot of Russian technique books.

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:51.840
 I can't read the book, but I can see the diagrams and I can see the figures.

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.920
 They don't really show it in pictures.

1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:56.600
 They do it in drawings.

1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:02.640
 And and so it was like when I was trying to beat the best that is

1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:07.720
 labeled the best because they win the World Championships every year since they

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:11.560
 been just about involved and I don't think they got started involved till

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:15.160
 like the fifties, but but you know, it's

1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:19.360
 something you know, you study the best who's out there.

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:25.480
 But then you don't focus so much on the best that you can't beat the best.

1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:27.320
 You learn from them.

1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:31.080
 But there's something that they don't have.

1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:32.720
 That you can have.

1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:36.600
 Toughness to technique, to the art, to the science.

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:37.680
 Yeah, all that stuff.

1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:40.880
 And that's why I even talking to you when you're sitting over there and you love

1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:45.880
 MIT and you're bragging about it over Harvard, you know, you know, it's

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:48.440
 because it's true in your eyes.

1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:51.080
 And and that's and that's great and it might be.

1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:56.880
 But but it's the same type of thing that, you know, there's something that you're

1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:00.880
 probably stealing from Harvard, but you won't give them credit.

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.920
 Well, Dan, in the interest of time,

1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:06.960
 I've read that you're pretty serious.

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:09.720
 You're pretty seriously into fishing.

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:13.320
 So what's the biggest fish you ever caught?

1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:16.800
 What are we talking about here?

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:17.800
 Are we talking about?

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.840
 No, I don't think I've ever caught a big ocean fish.

1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:23.960
 I'm not. I'm a River Lake fisherman.

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:25.880
 I have trout.

1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:29.280
 No, probably probably Northern.

1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:34.080
 OK, I probably caught a Northern net weight, 20 some pounds.

1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:37.320
 You know, the fish I like to catch is walleyes.

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.440
 And the reason why I like to catch them is because they're really good eating fish.

1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:45.040
 And the best eating fish are not the real big ones.

1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:47.040
 You know, it's kind of kind of interesting.

1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:52.240
 I got people hunting deer right on my land and they're looking for the big bucks,

1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:54.800
 but they're not the best eaters if you want, if you want to eat them.

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:56.000
 But they're the best trophy.

1:02:56.200 --> 1:02:59.440
 So, you know, I do have a couple of trophy walleyes on the wall.

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.120
 But but most of the time I throw the big ones back and put them back in there.

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.120
 So I don't know if you know, there's a book by Hemingway called Old Man in the Sea.

1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.960
 And heard of it and Ernest Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:17.360
 Yeah. And he there's an old man that basically

1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:20.600
 catches an 18 footer, but it can't pull it in, doesn't have the strength.

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:24.080
 So they together spend while the sharks eat away at it.

1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:27.880
 I mean, this is a very powerful story, I think one of the Nobel Prize.

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:30.680
 But he says it's better to be lucky.

1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:32.960
 The old man says it's better to be lucky.

1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:38.480
 But I would rather be exact that that that way when luck comes, you're ready.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:43.200
 So let me ask what do you think about luck?

1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:48.360
 Do you believe in free will that we have actions that control the direction

1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:54.840
 destination of our life or does luck and some other outside forces really

1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:57.560
 land you where you end up?

1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:00.160
 For me, I'm not about luck.

1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:04.640
 But I do think there is luck is involved.

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.560
 But I think it's mostly created

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:10.680
 just how lucky you are through preparations.

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:16.160
 And things have things have happened in my life forever.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:19.760
 And a lot of good things and a lot of people could say, hey,

1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:22.480
 you've been pretty lucky to win all these awards.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:26.880
 I don't know if you analyze my life.

1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:29.560
 I don't think it was involved with luck.

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:31.760
 I think it was more involved with preparation.

1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:38.680
 And again, science, had you been smarter, had you understood that you could do

1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:42.000
 some things and be just as lucky, that'd be great.

1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:46.000
 But I'm only as smart as today.

1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:52.120
 So when I was training in my life and me even training people in my life.

1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:57.000
 As of that moment, that's how lucky I am to be able to

1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:59.840
 have whatever is available to me.

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.840
 And that's what you call that a lot of science.

1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:07.880
 So for me, I think that like right now, if I look back, I do a lot of things

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:12.720
 different just because things are proven differently.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:17.040
 Like I'd give people water during practice and I did.

1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:21.160
 And I would let them change their wrestling shoes into running shoes to run

1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:23.200
 sprints on the concrete.

1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:29.240
 Or I would actually maybe maybe I've had a guy climb 12 ropes after practice one

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:32.480
 after another, and then maybe the next day I'd do it again.

1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:35.080
 You know, I might not make him do it the next day.

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:37.880
 I might let him recover a little bit more.

1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:43.520
 And you got to learn, keep adding to your philosophy.

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:48.160
 And your philosophy may have been great at that time, but it's at that time.

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:53.520
 And what is really important is where you at with this time today.

1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:56.000
 And so there's better ways to do things.

1:05:56.200 --> 1:06:02.920
 Now, if you ever take attitude out of it and just depend on total science.

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.400
 Then, you know, you're not going to be as as, you know, I think as I listened

1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:11.240
 to a couple of people that are really pretty famous people.

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:14.400
 When I was John Irving, he was a writer.

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:18.640
 Yeah, and he told me, he says, you think I really

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:22.720
 learned how to be a great writer in.

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:25.560
 Writing school.

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:29.440
 I said, yeah, I learned a lot there.

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:33.760
 But really what gave me the ability

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:40.960
 to stay focused, to work extra hours, to be more disciplined was wrestling practices.

1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:42.520
 That's right. He was a wrestler.

1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.480
 Yeah, he goes, I go back to that.

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:46.320
 That's what gave me that chance.

1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:50.280
 You know, and and there's a guy in Iowa that

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:56.000
 guy named Norman Borlaug, he he learned he

1:06:56.200 --> 1:07:02.120
 he invented a process to feed the underprivileged countries of the world.

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:04.000
 And

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:06.680
 he was a wrestler and he said the same thing.

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:08.800
 And he worked extremely hard.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.240
 And he said, I give a lot of credit to the sport of wrestling.

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:15.360
 And even though I was I'm known for this

1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:20.120
 and I got a statue in Washington, DC, because I saved a billion lives.

1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:23.600
 Plus, I'm going to give wrestling a lot of credit.

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:27.320
 So, you know, I think some of these

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:33.320
 MMA stars and some of these guys that maybe weren't wrestlers that had to

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:38.000
 wrestle, had to fight wrestling guys and stuff, missed a little bit there.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:40.360
 But I think the ones that did have wrestling

1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:43.240
 probably have a really good chance and can adapt to the other ones.

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:49.080
 But I think every martial art or every activity is good and you probably can't

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:52.600
 skip any, but I don't think they're ever going to overlook and say that

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:57.520
 wrestling's pretty not are not valuable because

1:07:57.720 --> 1:07:58.480
 it is.

1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:00.480
 However, that doesn't mean you're going to make it.

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.120
 You still got to take the values and apply it.

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:07.120
 Whatever area you're going to be in and and some people forget that.

1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:10.800
 Some people can't get over

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.760
 the highness of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match.

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:16.320
 And you know what?

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:21.840
 What's even greater than me getting my arm raised is that I if I'm a coach or if

1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:24.760
 I didn't belong with you, that you get your arm raised.

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:25.200
 Yeah.

1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:29.640
 And even if you don't get your arm raised, it's what you walk away with and how

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:35.480
 and how you learn to handle that as well, because there's going to be some losses.

1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:39.360
 But you don't want many because you don't want to get used to losing.

1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:42.240
 I can tell you that it's the hunger for the win.

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.040
 It's the brotherhood, the sisterhood of the wrestling room.

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:49.640
 And it's hard work and science that's going to be luck at the end of the day.

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:50.320
 Absolutely.

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:55.120
 That luck, you know, I'm, you know, I like luck, but I think it's

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:58.720
 created by the opportunity that you make your luck.

1:08:58.920 --> 1:08:59.600
 You make your luck.

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.920
 Yeah. Dan, it was a huge honor.
