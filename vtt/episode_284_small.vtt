00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
 you can't have permanent war without fiat.

00:04.200 --> 00:07.600
 And I also think there's a case to be made

00:07.600 --> 00:10.300
 that you can't really have fiat without war.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.520
 The following is a conversation with Safety and Amuse,

00:15.520 --> 00:17.880
 one of the central and most impactful economists,

00:17.880 --> 00:21.600
 philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.480
 He's an Austrian economist, an anarchist,

00:24.480 --> 00:27.000
 and the author of the Bitcoin Standard

00:27.000 --> 00:29.640
 and the new book, The Fiat Standard.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.760
 Safety does not mince words in his criticism

00:32.760 --> 00:35.160
 of economists and humans in general

00:35.160 --> 00:36.800
 with whom he disagrees.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.040
 For example, Paul Krugman,

00:39.040 --> 00:41.560
 who is a Neil McKenziean economist

00:41.560 --> 00:43.640
 and a previous guest at this podcast.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.760
 Safety and opinions are strong and often controversial.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.760
 I do push back in this conversation,

00:50.760 --> 00:54.360
 playing devil's advocate or trying to steal man on each side.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.960
 But as always, I do so in the service of exploring

00:57.960 --> 01:00.480
 the rich space of ideas that safety has

01:00.480 --> 01:03.680
 about human nature and human civilization.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.720
 I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,

01:06.720 --> 01:09.160
 to come to your own conclusions.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.600
 That is the burden of being a free thinking human.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.800
 It is on each of us individually

01:14.800 --> 01:17.840
 to dive into this chaos of ideas.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.120
 And from that chaos,

01:19.120 --> 01:23.240
 discover long lasting universal wisdom to live by.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.120
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.480

01:29.480 --> 01:32.880
 And now, dear friends, here's safety and moose.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.720
 Let's start with a big question.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.600
 What is money?

01:37.600 --> 01:39.040
 And what is the role of money

01:39.040 --> 01:40.680
 in the history of human civilization?

01:40.680 --> 01:42.400
 Money is a medium of exchange.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.640
 The thing that defines money is that it is a good

01:44.640 --> 01:46.800
 that you don't buy for its own sake

01:46.800 --> 01:48.440
 because you want to consume it itself

01:48.440 --> 01:50.840
 or because you want to employ it

01:50.840 --> 01:51.880
 in the production of other goods,

01:51.880 --> 01:53.440
 which is what capital goods are.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.840
 So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.520
 Money is distinct from those two

01:57.520 --> 01:59.760
 because it is a good that is acquired purely

01:59.760 --> 02:01.920
 to be exchanged later on for other goods.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.800
 So it's not something that you acquire for its own sake.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.800
 You acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.720
 And that's a market good.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.400
 That's a market good like all other goods.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.080
 You acquire food because you eat it.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.120
 You acquire a car to move you around.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.880
 You acquire money so that you can exchange it

02:17.880 --> 02:19.480
 for other goods.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.800
 And that's something that many people have

02:21.800 --> 02:24.240
 a hard time grasping of the concept of money

02:24.240 --> 02:25.080
 as a market good.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.920
 But it is a market good just like all others.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.480
 And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.800
 It allows us to develop the division of labor

02:35.800 --> 02:37.320
 which would not be possible

02:37.320 --> 02:39.960
 at any kind of sophisticated level without money.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.400
 So if we live in a small society of 10 people,

02:44.400 --> 02:46.600
 then think about all the things that we can make,

02:46.600 --> 02:49.080
 all the things that we can produce.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.840
 If we're only 10 people isolated from the world,

02:51.840 --> 02:53.560
 there's only very few things that we can make.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.280
 And therefore we can exchange those things

02:56.280 --> 02:57.880
 directly with one another.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.720
 But as if we get in contact with other societies

03:02.720 --> 03:04.160
 that have more people,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.960
 then the opportunities for specialization increase.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.800
 There's 10 people,

03:07.800 --> 03:10.880
 the only thing that you can make is the very basics

03:10.880 --> 03:12.120
 you need for your survival.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.680
 But if you're part of an economy of 10 million people,

03:15.680 --> 03:17.480
 there's much more room for specialization.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.840
 You can make a car, you can make a house

03:19.840 --> 03:22.000
 that's very sophisticated.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.440
 And that relies on the division of labor.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.000
 That relies on you specializing in doing

03:27.000 --> 03:30.760
 one tiny little thing which is not what you consume.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.280
 You know, and you trade that thing

03:33.280 --> 03:34.680
 for all the things that you consume.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.600
 So as the economy becomes more sophisticated

03:37.600 --> 03:38.920
 and involves more people,

03:38.920 --> 03:41.240
 and currently we're all part of an economy

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
 of almost eight billion people,

03:43.680 --> 03:46.600
 each one of us produces one tiny little thing

03:46.600 --> 03:48.960
 and they exchange that thing

03:48.960 --> 03:50.720
 for all the things that they want.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.360
 And so because we specialize,

03:52.360 --> 03:54.320
 we become more productive in doing the thing

03:54.320 --> 03:55.440
 that we're good at.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.120
 So, you know, there's people out there

03:57.120 --> 03:59.960
 who are engineers who are designing windshields in cars.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.600
 It's a very specialized thing.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.160
 They sell windshield design to Mercedes Benz.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.200
 And then from that, you know,

04:07.200 --> 04:09.560
 that windshield design is added on

04:09.560 --> 04:11.440
 to millions of cars around the world.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.200
 And from that, they're able to get enough money

04:14.200 --> 04:15.960
 to meet all of their needs.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.400
 So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money

04:19.400 --> 04:21.760
 because without money, it's very difficult

04:21.760 --> 04:24.760
 to be able to exchange a large number of goods.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.240
 It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy

04:27.240 --> 04:29.120
 with a large degree of specialization

04:29.120 --> 04:33.520
 because it's very difficult to find people

04:33.520 --> 04:35.960
 who want the thing that you have

04:35.960 --> 04:37.720
 and have the thing that you want.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.600
 We call this the coincidence of wants.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.680
 And that's really the problem that money solves.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.680
 So you make apples and I make oranges.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.400
 I'd like to have some of your apples,

04:48.400 --> 04:50.080
 but you don't want my oranges.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.240
 And that's, we have a problem of coincidence of wants.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.080
 So what do I do?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.120
 You want bananas.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.280
 I need to find somebody who has bananas,

04:56.280 --> 04:58.240
 give them my oranges, take their bananas,

04:58.240 --> 05:00.880
 give you their bananas, and then I take the apples.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.440
 In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.400
 So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve

05:06.400 --> 05:07.840
 and will emerge in an economy

05:07.840 --> 05:09.680
 as an economy becomes more sophisticated.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.920
 As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods,

05:12.920 --> 05:15.760
 it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation

05:15.760 --> 05:18.480
 where we have the problem of coincidence of wants

05:18.480 --> 05:21.720
 and the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.560
 And it can be anything.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.400
 It can be a banana.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.960
 It can be food stuff.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.240
 It can be any kind of good.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.720
 As long as I acquire the good with the purpose

05:30.720 --> 05:32.600
 of passing it on to you,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.280
 not with the purpose of me consuming it or using it,

05:35.280 --> 05:36.920
 then that's a medium of exchange.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.000
 So when we look at the entirety of human society

05:40.000 --> 05:42.600
 of millions of billions of people,

05:42.600 --> 05:45.000
 you think of them just a bunch of individuals

05:45.000 --> 05:46.520
 running around.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.560
 I love the term coincidence of wants.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.720
 So each one of them, it's like a stochastic system.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.360
 They have desires.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.560
 It's like a random collection of desires.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.040
 Some somehow rooted in our evolutionary history,

05:59.040 --> 06:02.320
 but mostly random in terms of preference of banana

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
 or apple, that kind of thing.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.640
 And then they also have the capacity for competence

06:08.640 --> 06:11.920
 and excellence in particular kind of labor.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.360
 So like a specialization.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.600
 They're able to be like incredible

06:16.600 --> 06:18.160
 at a particular set of tasks.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.800
 So there's a bunch of ants running around

06:20.800 --> 06:23.240
 with consciousness and intelligence.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.600
 And they have desires and have capabilities.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.600
 And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have

06:32.880 --> 06:34.560
 and the capabilities they have.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.360
 And you want it to create a system

06:36.360 --> 06:39.360
 that kind of exchanges those things.

06:39.360 --> 06:44.200
 So when you imagine like what is a good?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.200
 What is markets?

06:45.200 --> 06:49.640
 When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system,

06:49.640 --> 06:50.920
 what do you imagine?

06:50.920 --> 06:51.960
 What is a market?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.120
 A market is just the name for the naturally emergent

06:55.120 --> 06:58.320
 phenomena of people voluntarily exchanging things.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.080
 It's at any scale.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.320
 At any scale, yeah.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.200
 Individuals could be a market of two people

07:03.200 --> 07:04.640
 on an island on their own.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.920
 It could be eight billion people across the planet.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.520
 Naturally emerging.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.520
 Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard

07:12.520 --> 07:15.480
 for many people who don't have a good understanding

07:15.480 --> 07:18.920
 of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets

07:18.920 --> 07:23.520
 are not something that you need a central planner

07:23.520 --> 07:26.880
 or a government officer to make happen.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.160
 Capitalism is just what happens when people are left

07:29.160 --> 07:30.120
 to their own devices.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.720
 It's just our cognitive capacity allows us

07:32.720 --> 07:36.280
 to develop tools that we can use for production.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.960
 And that's what we do.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.920
 That's what humans have been doing since they started

07:40.920 --> 07:42.200
 making spears to hunt.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.280
 That's the first capital good, probably.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.280
 So we're constantly accumulating capital.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.760
 We're constantly trading with one another.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.440
 We find an opportunity.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.600
 You've got a lot of oranges.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.560
 I've got a lot of apples.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.880
 Then I'll take some of yours.

07:53.880 --> 07:54.720
 You'll take some of mine.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.080
 We're both better off.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.960
 This is just a naturally emergent thing.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.720
 And money is what makes it enormously powerful.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.320
 Money is what allows it to scale, really.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.280
 Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies

08:09.280 --> 08:11.360
 into just something that is global.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.960
 Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier,

08:14.960 --> 08:17.120
 all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing,

08:17.120 --> 08:18.360
 the thing that you do best.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.880
 And then you exchange that for money

08:19.880 --> 08:22.840
 and you don't have to worry about whether the other people

08:22.840 --> 08:26.640
 involved in this want what you have and have what you want.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.040
 You just sell it for money to whoever wants it

08:30.040 --> 08:32.880
 and you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.280
 And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden

08:37.280 --> 08:39.520
 of how a market economy functions.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.960
 So the first thing that I would say about money

08:40.960 --> 08:43.200
 is that it allows for the division of labor

08:43.200 --> 08:45.440
 and it allows for the market system to grow.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.040
 And the second thing is that money

08:47.040 --> 08:50.600
 is a mechanism for storing value into the future.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.760
 So again, as humans, we develop the capacity

08:53.760 --> 08:55.880
 to think for the future.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.480
 We make a spear so that we can hunt and then we

08:59.480 --> 09:01.680
 see that it works and then we take it out of the animal

09:01.680 --> 09:05.640
 that we hunted it with and we keep it for the next day's hunt.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.160
 And then we start making a better spear

09:07.160 --> 09:09.720
 and we make a better fishing rod and then we make a fishing net

09:09.720 --> 09:11.400
 and then we make a fishing boat.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.240
 And that's our ability to think of the future.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.000
 And as we start building durable goods,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.880
 we start thinking more and more of the future.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.000
 We start becoming more and more future oriented.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.600
 And that's really the process of civilization,

09:26.600 --> 09:29.520
 the process of denying our needs now

09:29.520 --> 09:31.160
 in order to think for the future.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.800
 So instead of spending all of our day on the beach

09:33.800 --> 09:38.120
 enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure

09:38.120 --> 09:42.520
 on the beach and spend some time making a spear

09:42.520 --> 09:45.800
 or making a fishing rod so that our productivity in hunting

09:45.800 --> 09:48.200
 or fishing tomorrow is going to be higher.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.880
 And so that ability to think for the future

09:51.880 --> 09:54.720
 is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.840
 And we do that with durable goods.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.760
 But then money ends up being the best mechanism

10:00.760 --> 10:04.480
 for providing for the future because the future is uncertain.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.960
 So you can save your apples and oranges.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.600
 You can save the spears.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.120
 You can save the animal that you hunted.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.200
 But these things, first they rot.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.600
 They're not very good at holding on to their value over time.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.720
 But even if they were, even if you have objects

10:20.720 --> 10:23.200
 that are durable, the problem with them

10:23.200 --> 10:26.200
 is that you don't know if you need them tomorrow

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
 or next month or next year.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.320
 You're not sure if you're going to be needing them

10:30.320 --> 10:31.920
 and you might end up not needing them

10:31.920 --> 10:33.960
 and you might end up not finding anybody who needs them

10:33.960 --> 10:35.200
 or finding somebody who needs them

10:35.200 --> 10:36.440
 but doesn't value them much

10:36.440 --> 10:38.360
 and won't give you much in exchange.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.000
 Money allows you the optionality

10:40.000 --> 10:43.760
 of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.960
 So it's something that you can sell tomorrow

10:45.960 --> 10:47.720
 with the least uncertainty.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.360
 It has the most liquidity, the most ability

10:49.360 --> 10:52.520
 to be sold without a loss in its value.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.040
 So money is our most advanced technology

10:55.040 --> 10:58.440
 and our best technology for moving value into the future.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.320
 And so I think history really,

11:01.320 --> 11:03.640
 and I argue this in all my books,

11:03.640 --> 11:06.400
 is that really history, we see,

11:06.400 --> 11:10.600
 we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder

11:10.600 --> 11:13.920
 and so our money gets better at holding on

11:13.920 --> 11:16.040
 to its value for the future.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.520
 And by harder, I mean harder to produce.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.720
 We find things that are hard to produce

11:20.720 --> 11:23.040
 that are better at holding on to their value.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.400
 So they hold on to their value better for the future

11:25.400 --> 11:28.280
 and that allows us to plot and plan for the future.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.160
 That makes the future less uncertain

11:31.160 --> 11:33.960
 and that makes us more future oriented.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.600
 In other words, it lowers our time preference

11:36.600 --> 11:38.800
 and the harder the money is,

11:38.800 --> 11:41.480
 the better it is at allowing us to think of the future.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.640
 So people should know that you've written

11:44.640 --> 11:48.760
 the book Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.200
 And then a new book called Fiat Standard.

11:52.120 --> 11:55.400
 The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible

11:55.400 --> 11:57.800
 in the cryptocurrency space and the Bitcoin space

11:57.800 --> 12:01.760
 of just a very rigorous systematic explanation

12:01.760 --> 12:06.400
 of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be,

12:06.400 --> 12:07.480
 why is it good.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.800
 So you're describing in that book and in the new book,

12:10.800 --> 12:14.480
 different implementations to the technology of money.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.560
 In the new book, you talk about Fiat Money,

12:17.560 --> 12:19.520
 which is another way to do money.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.640
 So obviously there's a lot of different ways to do money

12:22.640 --> 12:25.120
 and maybe you haven't discovered the best way to do money.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.720
 Yet our conversation today is how to do money

12:27.720 --> 12:28.560
 better.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.280
 Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually, right?

12:33.280 --> 12:35.000
 Very good reasons why we won't.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.240
 Well, we can disagree.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.360
 We can agree to disagree on this.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.320
 I'm open minded to the bananas.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.120
 One of the biggest source of joy to me

12:44.120 --> 12:48.040
 when I first came to this country is eating bananas.

12:48.040 --> 12:53.040
 And so maybe money, happiness, perishable happiness

12:53.040 --> 12:58.040
 will eventually become the best medium of exchange.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.040
 I don't know, open minded.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.200
 Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.480
 So there's different ways to do money.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.560
 What is hard money?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.360
 What is soft money?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.360
 In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument

13:10.360 --> 13:14.800
 that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.440
 Historically, I think we see many examples of that.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.080
 So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money

13:20.080 --> 13:22.320
 because nobody can make cigarettes in prison.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.240
 In societies, we have the example of Yap Island.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.080
 For instance, it's an island that doesn't have any limestone,

13:28.080 --> 13:31.360
 but there's a nearby island that has a lot of limestone.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.600
 And it's very expensive, obviously,

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
 with primitive technology to move limestone

13:35.600 --> 13:38.160
 from Palau to Yap.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.600
 So on Yap, limestones wear money.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.040
 Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find

13:44.040 --> 13:48.200
 end up serving as money in places where they're rare.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.720
 Glass beads wear money in West Africa

13:50.720 --> 13:52.720
 where there was no glass making technology

13:52.720 --> 13:54.680
 because they were imported from abroad

13:54.680 --> 13:57.280
 and they were very hard to make.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.400
 And I think there's a conscious effort

13:59.400 --> 14:03.000
 of some people might recognize the hardness and the scarcity

14:03.000 --> 14:04.480
 and choose this as money.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.920
 But I think what's more important

14:05.920 --> 14:10.480
 is just a natural evolutionary process whereby people choose

14:10.480 --> 14:14.560
 all kinds of random things as money, bananas, maybe even.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.320
 But then the people who end up making these bad choices

14:17.320 --> 14:18.960
 don't end up with any wealth left.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.360
 Whereas the people who store their wealth

14:21.360 --> 14:24.040
 in the things that are hard to make

14:24.040 --> 14:26.880
 end up acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth

14:26.880 --> 14:29.120
 and maybe even increasing it over time.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.000
 And of course, this culminated in the 19th century,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.120
 in the end of the 19th century,

14:33.120 --> 14:37.000
 by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.640
 What is a gold standard?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.800
 The gold standard is basically when money is gold

14:41.800 --> 14:44.720
 or at least government currencies backed by gold.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.600
 But the reason gold became money and not copper,

14:47.600 --> 14:49.120
 not nickel, not bananas,

14:49.120 --> 14:52.160
 is that gold is the hardest metal in the world

14:52.160 --> 14:55.920
 and it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.000
 And the reason for that is based in chemistry.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.080
 So gold is indestructible.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.680
 You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense.

15:03.680 --> 15:08.680
 It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.400
 The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt

15:12.400 --> 15:16.040
 is today probably in somebody's necklace

15:16.040 --> 15:17.160
 or in somebody's gold coin.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.000
 It's still there.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.040
 So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.280
 They dig it out of the ground, they refine it,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.880
 and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin

15:25.880 --> 15:27.440
 and then it just stays there.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.840
 It gets melted down into new other forms.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.520
 The jewelry gets turned into coins

15:31.520 --> 15:33.200
 or coins get turned into bars.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.560
 But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.080
 On the other hand, every year,

15:41.080 --> 15:43.880
 we get better at our technology of looking for gold.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.400
 There's more people all over the world.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.840
 The population increases, the technology improves.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.920
 So we keep finding more and more gold

15:49.920 --> 15:52.040
 and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.200
 However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile

15:55.200 --> 15:57.920
 that is not being devalued, sorry,

15:57.920 --> 15:59.240
 that is not being consumed,

15:59.240 --> 16:00.600
 because there's no way of consuming gold.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.040
 You can't eat it, you can't burn it,

16:03.040 --> 16:04.760
 you can't, it doesn't rust.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.280
 Because of that, we're constantly adding

16:07.280 --> 16:08.880
 to a constantly growing stockpile.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.960
 So if you look at the numbers,

16:10.960 --> 16:13.200
 you see over the last 100 years,

16:13.200 --> 16:16.320
 we've got pretty reliable data on gold production worldwide,

16:16.320 --> 16:18.680
 we see that pretty much gold stockpiles

16:18.680 --> 16:22.440
 increase at around 1.5 to 2% per year, every year.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.160
 So yes, we're making more every year,

16:25.160 --> 16:26.800
 but we're making more,

16:26.800 --> 16:29.160
 so we're adding to the stockpile, the stockpile grows more.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.360
 So every year, we're adding only around 1.5 to 2%.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.520
 Compare that to the second hardest metal,

16:37.520 --> 16:39.120
 historically, was silver.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.320
 And that increased historically at around

16:41.320 --> 16:43.720
 maybe 5% per year or so.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.840
 Now it probably increases something like closer to 30%

16:46.840 --> 16:49.160
 because it's now getting used extensively

16:49.160 --> 16:50.840
 in industrial uses.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.760
 So when you use it in industry,

16:53.760 --> 16:56.440
 when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera

16:56.440 --> 16:59.520
 or in a machine, effectively,

16:59.520 --> 17:01.040
 you are consuming the stockpile

17:01.040 --> 17:02.600
 because it's not used as money,

17:02.600 --> 17:04.920
 it's taken out of the monetary stockpile.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.320
 So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular,

17:08.320 --> 17:12.000
 and let's discuss this in detail in the Bitcoin standard,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.480
 what happened in 1870 was Germany won the Franco Prussian War

17:16.480 --> 17:19.000
 and Germany was on a silver standard,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.200
 but the value of silver was declining.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.680
 So Germany did something very smart,

17:22.680 --> 17:25.680
 which is they took their indemnity from France

17:25.680 --> 17:28.320
 in silver and gold

17:28.320 --> 17:30.520
 and used that big chunk of gold

17:30.520 --> 17:33.120
 to switch to going on a gold standard.

17:33.120 --> 17:37.520
 And since then, silver's been collapsing in value next to gold.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.160
 So back then the price of an ounce of gold

17:40.160 --> 17:42.160
 was around 15 ounces of silver.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.480
 Today it's closer to 100.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.600
 It's just been declining for the last 150 years.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.560
 And so because of that, because of the fact

17:48.560 --> 17:50.760
 that it's lost its monetary role

17:50.760 --> 17:52.920
 as people shifted toward gold,

17:52.920 --> 17:54.600
 the value of silver went down

17:54.600 --> 17:56.160
 and so it became economical to use it

17:56.160 --> 17:58.320
 in more and more industrial applications.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.360
 So the stockpile declines

18:00.360 --> 18:05.240
 and then as a result that weakens its monetary properties

18:05.240 --> 18:06.800
 more and more and more.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.560
 So that's why at the end of the 19th century,

18:09.560 --> 18:10.880
 I mean, at the beginning of the 19th century,

18:10.880 --> 18:12.160
 gold and silver were money.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.440
 By the end, it was basically only gold.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.840
 And the countries that were still on a silver standard,

18:16.840 --> 18:18.440
 China and India in particular,

18:18.440 --> 18:19.720
 suffered enormously from it

18:19.720 --> 18:23.600
 because their money was devaluing very quickly next to gold.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.880
 And so Europeans who would come to China or India

18:26.880 --> 18:30.320
 were able to buy things at practically a big discount.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.560
 So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple,

18:33.560 --> 18:34.600
 very basic questions.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.720
 There's few people in this world that are good

18:37.720 --> 18:41.200
 as good as you are at answering very basic,

18:41.200 --> 18:42.960
 almost ridiculously basic questions.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.000
 Because I think exploring questions like what is money,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.120
 is a really great way to think from first principles

18:49.120 --> 18:50.760
 to really think deeply about this world.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.680
 So I really appreciate you doing that.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.600
 When you say standard, what does it mean?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
 When you say silver standard, gold standard,

18:57.600 --> 18:59.920
 again with a basic question.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.840
 The term really I think was based out of gold,

19:03.840 --> 19:06.280
 the first time this came out was the gold standard.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.280
 Because so I said gold was money

19:09.280 --> 19:11.000
 at the end of the 19th century,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.560
 but it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins

19:13.560 --> 19:15.080
 and trading with gold coins

19:15.080 --> 19:19.360
 because that's got a problem of divisibility.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.440
 So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.160
 So how do you buy that thing?

19:25.160 --> 19:28.120
 And the answer was that you created monetary instruments

19:28.120 --> 19:30.200
 that were backed by gold.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.640
 And so currencies, national currencies

19:32.640 --> 19:34.400
 under the gold standard,

19:34.400 --> 19:36.800
 were specific units of gold.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.000
 And that's how a gold standard function.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
 Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper

19:42.000 --> 19:43.920
 that were redeemable in gold.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.080
 So you could go to the central bank,

19:45.080 --> 19:46.960
 you could give them the piece of paper,

19:46.960 --> 19:49.160
 the $100 bill or the $10 bill,

19:49.160 --> 19:51.000
 and they'll give you gold in exchange.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.760
 And they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.240
 Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.480
 So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.

19:59.480 --> 20:00.920
 Exactly, that was the plan.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.200
 Well, that was what it's supposed to do,

20:03.200 --> 20:07.280
 but arguably we never had a pure gold standard

20:07.280 --> 20:09.240
 because the nature of gold means

20:09.240 --> 20:12.040
 that the people who are in charge of the gold,

20:12.040 --> 20:13.520
 they have an enormous amount of power

20:13.520 --> 20:15.160
 because the gold is concentrated with them.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.840
 And as long as not everybody shows up at the same time,

20:17.840 --> 20:18.880
 asking for their gold,

20:18.880 --> 20:20.880
 then you can make more receipts than you have gold.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.720
 And this is good.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.200
 So there's always shady stuff going on,

20:24.200 --> 20:26.160
 but at least that's the state of goal

20:26.160 --> 20:28.360
 is the receipts should exactly represent

20:28.360 --> 20:29.880
 the amount of gold there.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.720
 And also when you say standard,

20:31.720 --> 20:36.720
 it means that governments sort of publicly stated

20:38.160 --> 20:41.240
 that this is the approved, the main way

20:41.240 --> 20:44.040
 of making transactions that are monetary.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.120
 So this is the money.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.640
 This is the official money that you should be using

20:47.640 --> 20:48.760
 if you live in this country.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.000
 Yes, although I would say it's more like the other way around.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.400
 It's not that the government's established gold as money.

20:55.400 --> 21:00.000
 It's more like gold gave the governments

21:00.000 --> 21:01.880
 the credibility for their currencies.

21:01.880 --> 21:06.280
 So governments were not the ones that made gold money.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.480
 Gold has been money before the states were invented.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.200
 States, if you have a government

21:12.200 --> 21:14.160
 and you'd like to have some legitimacy

21:14.160 --> 21:15.280
 and you'd like to be able to deal

21:15.280 --> 21:18.000
 with other governments on an equal footing,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.760
 you had to go by the gold standard.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.440
 You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold

21:22.440 --> 21:24.120
 so that you could trade with the rest of the world

21:24.120 --> 21:28.160
 so that people could in your country use that currency.

21:28.160 --> 21:32.160
 So it's not that governments were choosing gold.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.480
 It's more like they were having to adapt

21:35.480 --> 21:37.760
 their own currencies to gold

21:37.760 --> 21:39.400
 in order to give their currencies credibility.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.000
 So there's a dance there though,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.600
 because if they had to,

21:43.600 --> 21:46.520
 then why did they switch away from it after?

21:46.520 --> 21:49.680
 So there is a dance where the governments,

21:49.680 --> 21:52.160
 the people pressure.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.080
 So first of all, the basic characteristics

21:56.080 --> 21:59.800
 of the hard money pressures the governments

21:59.800 --> 22:02.760
 and the people in terms of what should be used.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.240
 Then the people based on their community,

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
 the network effects, the way they,

22:07.240 --> 22:09.280
 the narratives they tell each other,

22:09.280 --> 22:10.440
 all that kind of stuff,

22:10.440 --> 22:12.480
 they pressure the governments

22:12.480 --> 22:14.120
 to take on a particular money.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.040
 Then the governments, they like power,

22:18.040 --> 22:19.800
 they like control, all those kinds of things.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.200
 They pressure the people

22:21.200 --> 22:22.400
 to tell different kinds of narratives.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.960
 So there's a dance going on in this evolution

22:24.960 --> 22:27.440
 of what technology to use for a monetary system.

22:27.440 --> 22:32.440
 So the reason I don't know if governments had to,

22:32.440 --> 22:34.320
 because they clearly didn't have to

22:34.320 --> 22:36.720
 because they eventually moved away from it.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.120
 So, but there was pressure probably.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.360
 Yeah, but I mean, even after they moved away from it,

22:41.360 --> 22:42.600
 central banks until today,

22:42.600 --> 22:45.040
 they still hold a lot of gold reserves.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.520
 In fact, if you look at 1914,

22:47.520 --> 22:51.040
 when the world really went off the gold standard,

22:51.040 --> 22:53.760
 the amount of gold reserves held by central banks

22:53.760 --> 22:55.760
 was a tiny fraction of what it was.

22:55.760 --> 22:59.880
 As time went on, central banks accumulated more and more gold.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.200
 What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens

23:02.200 --> 23:04.280
 from using the gold, but they continued to use it.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.600
 So gold continued to be money up until 1971

23:07.600 --> 23:10.840
 because effectively the world was on a dollar standard

23:10.840 --> 23:13.000
 and the dollars were backed by gold.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.640
 But then after 1971, even then,

23:15.640 --> 23:17.320
 central banks continued to accumulate gold

23:17.320 --> 23:20.040
 because why would you as a central bank

23:20.040 --> 23:22.520
 want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively

23:22.520 --> 23:25.240
 or credit liabilities of another central bank

23:25.240 --> 23:27.960
 that can produce them infinitely?

23:27.960 --> 23:31.800
 And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious

23:31.800 --> 23:35.120
 to governments today, you know, as we see US sanctions

23:35.120 --> 23:37.960
 taking say Russian reserves or Afghanistan reserves.

23:39.040 --> 23:39.880
 And this is why, you know,

23:39.880 --> 23:42.040
 we see China and Russia have accumulated a lot of gold

23:42.040 --> 23:44.080
 over the last 10, 20 years.

23:44.080 --> 23:48.440
 So just to return to the question of definitions.

23:48.440 --> 23:51.000
 So what is hard money versus soft money?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.120
 Yes, so hard, I mean, it's a relative thing,

23:54.120 --> 23:56.520
 but the hardness refers to the difficulty

23:56.520 --> 23:59.480
 of producing more units of the money supply.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.640
 So an easy money would be a money

24:01.640 --> 24:04.440
 that is relatively easy to make.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.800
 So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%,

24:08.800 --> 24:09.640
 or something like that.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.640
 So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities,

24:12.640 --> 24:15.520
 other than gold and silver, they're easy money

24:15.520 --> 24:18.880
 and they're not suitable as a monetary medium

24:18.880 --> 24:20.160
 because they're being consumed.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.320
 So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard,

24:22.320 --> 24:25.080
 I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio,

24:25.080 --> 24:27.840
 which is the ratio of the annual production,

24:27.840 --> 24:31.480
 the flow to the stockpile, the existing stockpiles.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.120
 If you look at all the other metals,

24:33.120 --> 24:36.160
 they're easy money because they're being consumed.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.320
 So think about how much stockpiles of copper

24:38.320 --> 24:40.120
 there are in the world today.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.960
 So copper companies obviously have some stockpiles of copper.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.040
 Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper,

24:47.040 --> 24:49.840
 but the vast majority of copper is essentially

24:49.840 --> 24:54.440
 on a conveyor belt of production from the mine

24:54.440 --> 24:58.440
 straight to the consumer good that it's being used for.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.760
 So the existing stockpiles are roughly

25:01.760 --> 25:04.880
 in the range of one year's production.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.760
 If you take all of the companies,

25:06.760 --> 25:08.800
 I don't have exact statistics,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.440
 and it's very difficult to get these,

25:10.440 --> 25:12.760
 but it's roughly in the same range.

25:12.760 --> 25:17.240
 Like if copper production were to stop completely today,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.480
 we'll have about a year's production

25:19.480 --> 25:22.000
 stored in various places.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.720
 So that makes copper terrible money

25:24.720 --> 25:27.440
 because if you started using copper as money,

25:27.440 --> 25:28.880
 and this is why a lot of people say,

25:28.880 --> 25:30.680
 well, money is a collective illusion.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.280
 Money is a social construct.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.960
 If we all agree that something is money,

25:35.960 --> 25:36.800
 then something is money.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.880
 I think this is completely clueless,

25:37.880 --> 25:39.760
 and it's usually Marxists who believe this,

25:39.760 --> 25:42.240
 so obviously no understanding of economics.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.320
 It's completely clueless

25:43.320 --> 25:46.120
 because even if everybody in society decided

25:46.120 --> 25:47.840
 we wanted to make copper as money,

25:47.840 --> 25:50.920
 even if we all decided to collectively take part

25:50.920 --> 25:53.280
 in this hallucination or illusion,

25:53.280 --> 25:54.920
 it would not make copper money.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.680
 It would just make everybody who decides

25:56.680 --> 25:58.760
 to take part in this hallucination poor.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.600
 That's it.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.000
 It would make copper miners rich.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.200
 It would make all of the people

26:02.200 --> 26:04.120
 who chose copper as money poor,

26:04.120 --> 26:05.600
 and copper would not be money.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.680
 It can't work because what happens is

26:07.680 --> 26:10.240
 because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,

26:10.240 --> 26:13.640
 if you buy, even if you get the 1,000 richest people

26:13.640 --> 26:16.240
 in the world, all of the world's billionaires,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.640
 they get together and they all dump

26:18.640 --> 26:19.680
 all of the money that they have,

26:19.680 --> 26:22.520
 all the stocks, all the bonds, all the gold,

26:22.520 --> 26:24.440
 all of the Bitcoin, everything that they own.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.480
 They dump it and they buy copper with it.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.320
 What's gonna happen?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.800
 Price of copper is gonna go up a lot,

26:30.800 --> 26:33.040
 but what's gonna stop copper miners

26:33.040 --> 26:35.960
 from flooding the market with even more copper

26:35.960 --> 26:37.760
 than what the billionaires bought?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.600
 Nothing.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.880
 They're gonna dump all of that extra copper production.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.040
 It's the price of copper is gonna go up,

26:43.040 --> 26:45.680
 so there will be a lot more copper mining

26:45.680 --> 26:47.120
 than all the other metals.

26:47.120 --> 26:51.120
 A lot of nickel companies and gold miners

26:51.120 --> 26:53.520
 are gonna switch to focusing on copper,

26:53.520 --> 26:55.640
 and then we're gonna dump an enormous amount

26:55.640 --> 26:57.040
 of copper on the market.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.000
 The value of copper is gonna crash,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.600
 and the people who chose copper as money

27:01.600 --> 27:03.800
 are just gonna end up with large warehouses

27:03.800 --> 27:06.480
 of very cheap, rusting metal.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.920
 So that's a brilliant description

27:07.920 --> 27:09.920
 and that kind of pushes towards gold

27:09.920 --> 27:13.280
 where the stock to flow ratio,

27:13.280 --> 27:15.600
 I guess you would say is 1.5 to 2%,

27:15.600 --> 27:16.840
 like you mentioned earlier.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.720
 That would be like the inverse of the stock to flow.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.000
 That's the supply growth rate.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.600
 So the stock to flow is the inverse, it's around 60.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.720
 60, got it.

27:23.720 --> 27:27.880
 But let me push back on somebody who likes human psychology.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.280
 Let me push back on the collective hallucination

27:31.280 --> 27:32.160
 and the illusion.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.880
 So that's for copper, but what about paper money?

27:35.880 --> 27:40.880
 That's not, you can't smoke it, you can't eat it.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.840
 It's supposed to represent,

27:44.840 --> 27:47.240
 it's supposed to just be the medium of exchange.

27:47.240 --> 27:52.240
 In that sense, what role does collective hallucination play

27:54.600 --> 27:56.080
 in the effectiveness of money?

27:56.080 --> 27:59.080
 Exactly zero, because all of the paper money,

27:59.080 --> 28:00.920
 first of all, there's never been an instance.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.800
 And again, this flies in the face

28:04.800 --> 28:08.200
 of a lot of people like to think about money.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.440
 There's never been an instance

28:09.440 --> 28:11.960
 where a government came out and said,

28:11.960 --> 28:13.720
 all right, we're printing out these pieces of paper,

28:13.720 --> 28:14.560
 use them as money.

28:14.560 --> 28:19.040
 This one is worth 10 apples or use it for buying things.

28:19.040 --> 28:19.880
 And here's the piece of paper.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.360
 This has never happened.

28:21.360 --> 28:26.360
 They've always taken fiat money, paper money,

28:26.640 --> 28:30.680
 all of these things were always borne out of fraud.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.760
 Initially it was a receipt for gold.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.040
 And then they told you, well, you don't need the gold anyway

28:36.040 --> 28:36.920
 and you have to use this.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.440
 And then if you don't use it, we throw you in jail.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.120
 And then, so first of all, it doesn't,

28:42.120 --> 28:44.360
 you can't enforce this thing.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.680
 So it's never really just happened.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.360
 And it's never been hallucinated into existence.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.120
 People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense

28:50.120 --> 28:54.360
 in writing textbooks and books in academia,

28:54.360 --> 28:57.600
 but in the real world, people don't hallucinate money.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.160
 People are very careful about what they put their money in.

29:00.160 --> 29:03.080
 For people listening, we're gonna have fun in this conversation.

29:03.080 --> 29:06.560
 Cause you're like, you already said Marxist,

29:06.560 --> 29:09.800
 fraud, hallucination, just because we use these words

29:09.800 --> 29:12.920
 doesn't mean they're true, but they're fun to talk about.

29:12.920 --> 29:17.240
 So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk,

29:17.240 --> 29:20.080
 which I think is fun.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.400
 But allow me in my dumb self to push back,

29:22.400 --> 29:25.200
 to play devil's advocate, and I'll actually ask you sometimes

29:25.200 --> 29:27.160
 to play devil's advocate if possible,

29:27.160 --> 29:28.880
 cause you're smarter than me on all this stuff.

29:28.880 --> 29:33.520
 So we want the smartest devil's advocate possible.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.960
 And I'm certainly not that.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
 But anyway, so, but nevertheless,

29:36.960 --> 29:41.480
 we are currently on a fiat standard.

29:41.480 --> 29:46.480
 So money does have value, paper money,

29:50.440 --> 29:52.240
 and the reason it has value is because

29:52.240 --> 29:53.760
 we believe it has value.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.760
 To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,

29:57.760 --> 30:01.240
 the belief that something is worth value

30:01.240 --> 30:06.080
 is actually value is the thing that helps money work.

30:06.080 --> 30:10.520
 Cause you're saying it's fraud and the belief

30:11.520 --> 30:13.800
 is almost valueless.

30:13.800 --> 30:17.400
 But how much value, can we quantify the value of the belief,

30:17.400 --> 30:18.440
 the collective belief?

30:18.440 --> 30:21.680
 I should say like, all economics is subjective.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.160
 I consider myself an Austrian school economist

30:24.160 --> 30:26.760
 and the starting point of all Austrian economics

30:26.760 --> 30:28.920
 is that all value is subjective.

30:28.920 --> 30:33.360
 So obviously, value only exists

30:33.360 --> 30:35.960
 because humans choose to make the valuation.

30:35.960 --> 30:40.040
 However, the economic reality of the way that money works

30:40.040 --> 30:42.680
 means that it's just a technology like all others.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.280
 And so for me, when people say, well,

30:45.280 --> 30:47.240
 if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,

30:47.240 --> 30:48.280
 then it'll be money.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.920
 If we can hallucinate bananas to be money,

30:49.920 --> 30:50.880
 then it'll be money.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.720
 For me, it's like saying, well,

30:51.720 --> 30:54.000
 if we hallucinate that bananas can be spaceships,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
 they'll be spaceships.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.360
 I mean, you can call them spaceships

30:56.360 --> 30:59.720
 if you want, but a banana's not gonna get you to the moon.

30:59.720 --> 31:03.160
 With it, nevertheless, that's true.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.080
 So you're drawing a big distinction

31:05.080 --> 31:09.360
 between physical reality and the space of belief.

31:09.360 --> 31:14.360
 But it seems like so much power of human civilization,

31:14.600 --> 31:18.040
 so much destruction, so much creativity,

31:18.040 --> 31:21.240
 creation happens in our minds.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
 So absolutely.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.600
 Everything does happen in the minds.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.000
 You're not gonna get to the moon,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.640
 but you might still have a significant impact

31:27.640 --> 31:31.600
 on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.440
 True, but economic reality exists in a way

31:35.440 --> 31:37.960
 in which your beliefs are rewarded

31:37.960 --> 31:39.920
 when they match up with economic reality.

31:39.920 --> 31:40.760
 With this reality.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.920
 And they're punished when they don't.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.760
 So if you ride a banana, jump off a cliff,

31:44.760 --> 31:47.000
 thinking you're gonna get to the moon,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.680
 that solves the problem of people thinking

31:48.680 --> 31:50.680
 the bananas are spaceships by killing people

31:50.680 --> 31:53.120
 who think that bananas are spaceships.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.040
 And I think to go back to your question

31:55.040 --> 31:56.440
 in terms of paper monies.

31:56.440 --> 32:01.440
 So yes, even though ignoring the original sin

32:01.440 --> 32:03.000
 of the creation of fiat money

32:03.000 --> 32:05.480
 and ignoring everything that happened before 1971,

32:05.480 --> 32:07.040
 all right, well, here we are.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.200
 People are using, well, it's not really paper money.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.840
 And we should say like fiat money is predominantly credit.

32:12.840 --> 32:15.040
 So like, it's also digital currency.

32:15.040 --> 32:18.800
 So more than 90% of dollars are digital.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.400
 Less than 10% of dollars are physical.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.760
 So it is a digital currency.

32:22.760 --> 32:23.920
 And all over the world,

32:23.920 --> 32:26.480
 all these governments are using digital currencies effectively

32:26.480 --> 32:29.520
 with some physical manifestations in paper.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.400
 But yet even within these currencies,

32:32.400 --> 32:33.800
 it's still the same analysis.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.320
 And I discussed this in chapter four of the Bitcoin standard.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.760
 You look at government monies,

32:37.760 --> 32:40.200
 you see that the currencies that have held onto their value,

32:40.200 --> 32:42.240
 the ones that have the biggest value,

32:42.240 --> 32:44.680
 the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,

32:44.680 --> 32:46.920
 the ones that are used as currency reserves

32:46.920 --> 32:48.120
 all over the world,

32:48.120 --> 32:50.880
 are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rates.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.440
 The ones that grow, whose central banks

32:53.440 --> 32:55.400
 are the least inflationary.

32:55.400 --> 32:56.440
 And on the other hand,

32:56.440 --> 32:58.920
 the ones that who supplies more inflationary

32:58.920 --> 33:00.920
 similar to copper end up failing.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.480
 You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, as in Bobway.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.560
 These are currencies whose supply increases very quickly.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.080
 And therefore their value collapses.

33:09.080 --> 33:12.560
 Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro,

33:12.560 --> 33:14.960
 the British bound, the Japanese yen,

33:14.960 --> 33:17.200
 they increase at a much lower rate in general

33:17.200 --> 33:20.240
 than these terrible currencies.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.960
 And that's why all over the world,

33:21.960 --> 33:24.200
 you see people are looking to get more dollars

33:24.200 --> 33:28.200
 and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.

33:28.200 --> 33:32.400
 So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money

33:32.400 --> 33:36.440
 and the ease of money is pretty well supported,

33:36.440 --> 33:37.600
 empirically.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.800
 So like you said, you're at least in part

33:40.800 --> 33:43.760
 or in whole consider yourself an Austrian economist.

33:44.760 --> 33:49.040
 So you're perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.560
 What is Austrian economics?

33:50.560 --> 33:52.280
 What is Kenzian economics?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.720
 How do you compare the two?

33:54.720 --> 33:56.400
 What should people know some interest?

33:56.400 --> 33:59.640
 What are the interesting defining characteristics

33:59.640 --> 34:01.800
 to you about these schools of thought?

34:01.800 --> 34:03.400
 So Austrian economics, the way that I say it,

34:03.400 --> 34:04.960
 Austrian economics is economics.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.720
 It's, we call it Austrian economics

34:07.720 --> 34:11.480
 because economics has been hijacked by a bunch of frauds.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.920
 People who are wrong.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.600
 Well, it's much worse than wrong

34:14.600 --> 34:16.680
 by people who are just essentially propagandists

34:16.680 --> 34:18.600
 for inflation.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.400
 So it's like your opinion, man.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.880
 Yeah, well, that's also like your opinion, man.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.760
 Yeah, that's true.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.680
 Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast.

34:28.680 --> 34:32.840
 So he's, the O speaks enough,

34:32.840 --> 34:37.520
 but he's one of the people that is perhaps most harshly

34:37.520 --> 34:42.520
 criticized by folks in Austrian economics perspective

34:42.720 --> 34:45.840
 and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension.

34:45.840 --> 34:49.040
 Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor

34:49.040 --> 34:51.320
 who plays an economist on TV and the internet.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.480
 So anyway, now tell me what you really think.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.680
 No, but so the basics of what is Austrian economics?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.680
 What is the, what perspective does it take in the world?

35:00.680 --> 35:03.960
 Yeah, so I mean, Austrian economics really is

35:03.960 --> 35:07.000
 the continuation of tradition that it goes back

35:07.000 --> 35:09.760
 to the ancient Greeks of studying economics.

35:09.760 --> 35:13.360
 Historically, it's really just economics

35:13.360 --> 35:14.720
 and that has evolved over time

35:14.720 --> 35:19.720
 and the establishment of the Austrian school per se

35:20.400 --> 35:24.720
 came in 1871, 150 years ago, when Karl Manger,

35:24.720 --> 35:26.120
 the father of the school wrote a book

35:26.120 --> 35:28.160
 called Principles of Economics

35:28.160 --> 35:30.920
 and essentially invented marginal analysis,

35:30.920 --> 35:32.840
 which is a big deal in economics.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.360
 Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics,

35:35.360 --> 35:37.880
 individuals carry out decisions at the margin.

35:37.880 --> 35:42.720
 That it's, when you make choice, you're not making it,

35:42.720 --> 35:44.080
 for instance, if you're making a choice

35:44.080 --> 35:46.840
 between what should I spend my money on?

35:46.840 --> 35:49.800
 You're not making a choice whether it is,

35:49.800 --> 35:51.880
 this thing is object A or B,

35:51.880 --> 35:53.920
 which one is more valuable for me in general,

35:53.920 --> 35:56.800
 which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.480
 You're choosing about the next unit right now

35:59.480 --> 36:01.000
 at this point at this stage.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.120
 And if you analyze economic decision making at the margin,

36:04.120 --> 36:05.240
 it makes a lot more sense

36:05.240 --> 36:06.920
 and you can understand why people decide

36:06.920 --> 36:08.720
 and make the decisions that they do.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.640
 Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis,

36:12.640 --> 36:14.400
 things don't make sense.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.280
 The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve

36:17.280 --> 36:19.880
 is what is called the water diamond paradox.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.280
 So you will die without water.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.920
 We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.360
 Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous,

36:29.360 --> 36:31.040
 nobody needs them.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.720
 Nobody is gonna live or die because they have a diamond

36:33.720 --> 36:35.520
 and yet they're extremely expensive.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.080
 So why is it that as human beings,

36:37.080 --> 36:41.760
 we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,

36:41.760 --> 36:43.200
 whereas we pay thousands of dollars

36:43.200 --> 36:45.040
 for a few grams of diamonds.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.200
 Why is this the case?

36:46.200 --> 36:49.320
 Do we value water less than diamond?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.320
 The answer is no.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.000
 But at the margin where we are right now,

36:54.000 --> 36:55.960
 you live in a place where water is very abundant

36:55.960 --> 36:57.960
 because cities are only built in places

36:57.960 --> 36:59.680
 where water is abundant.

36:59.680 --> 37:03.560
 And you're only making a choice

37:03.560 --> 37:05.360
 about the next unit of water.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.320
 And so water is extremely abundant

37:07.320 --> 37:10.480
 and you're choosing about whether to spend

37:10.480 --> 37:14.640
 the next unit of money on water.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.480
 The valuation that you give to water

37:16.480 --> 37:18.920
 given that you have a lot of water at home

37:18.920 --> 37:21.440
 and that you live in a place that has abundant water

37:21.440 --> 37:24.680
 is pretty low to the marginal unit.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.000
 But it's very high for water overall.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.400
 So if I asked you how much would you spend

37:29.400 --> 37:32.000
 for water in general?

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
 How much would you pay for water for all of your life?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.040
 It would be a lot higher than diamonds.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.240
 If I told you you can only have water or diamonds

37:39.240 --> 37:42.360
 for the rest of your life, you choose water obviously.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.960
 But nobody's ever had to make that choice.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.280
 You only make your choices at the margin.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.320
 So at the margin where we are, modern civilization,

37:50.320 --> 37:51.560
 we have an abundance of water.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.160
 That's why we have civilization.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.000
 And diamonds are very rare and scarce.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
 And people are only buying, you buy your first diamond

38:00.080 --> 38:03.280
 when you're gonna get married, you give it to your wife.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.680
 And that's gonna be the first few grams of diamond

38:06.680 --> 38:07.520
 that she's ever gonna own.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.120
 Giving my wife water.

38:10.120 --> 38:10.960
 Smart move.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.240
 You should definitely give her bitcoin instead of diamonds.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.680
 I tell my wife, I occasionally remind her

38:15.680 --> 38:18.160
 how many bitcoin we could have had

38:18.160 --> 38:20.480
 if I bought her bitcoin with the price of the diamond ring.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.920
 What's the downside of, by the way,

38:21.920 --> 38:25.920
 diamonds from the analysis of gold and so on?

38:25.920 --> 38:26.920
 It's a great question.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.120
 Arguably diamonds are a scam.

38:30.120 --> 38:35.120
 Because they became popular as a thing in marriage

38:37.520 --> 38:39.080
 after gold was banned,

38:39.080 --> 38:41.760
 after gold ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s

38:41.760 --> 38:43.480
 and in many places around the world.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.880
 So before that, you'd give gold.

38:44.880 --> 38:49.160
 And the reason you'd give gold in a dowry in a wedding

38:49.160 --> 38:52.480
 is because it wasn't just that it's pretty and shiny,

38:52.480 --> 38:53.680
 it's because it's money.

38:53.680 --> 38:58.080
 And so if you die, your wife can take the gold

38:58.080 --> 39:00.480
 and she can live off of it.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.880
 It's a demonstration that you're giving her

39:01.880 --> 39:03.240
 something valuable.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.840
 And that's because nobody can make a lot more gold

39:05.840 --> 39:07.160
 that has the high stock to flow ratio.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.720
 But then they banned gold ownership

39:09.720 --> 39:11.120
 or they allowed people to only own

39:11.120 --> 39:12.840
 very tiny quantities of gold.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.440
 And that's when the diamond industry stepped in

39:15.440 --> 39:20.000
 and marketed diamonds as the thing that you need to give.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.560
 But the problem with it is, of course,

39:21.560 --> 39:23.800
 that diamonds aren't like gold.

39:23.800 --> 39:27.160
 They're not very hard to make more of.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.720
 And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds

39:29.720 --> 39:30.600
 is really artificial.

39:30.600 --> 39:34.440
 There's effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.

39:34.440 --> 39:39.080
 They restrict the supply and it's a pretty dirty business.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.800
 And the way that they do it is all of us

39:41.800 --> 39:44.760
 talk about blood diamonds is a way for them

39:44.760 --> 39:46.320
 to ensure their monopoly.

39:46.320 --> 39:51.200
 So if you're part of the monopoly of diamond producers,

39:51.200 --> 39:53.360
 then it doesn't matter how many people get killed

39:53.360 --> 39:54.440
 producing your diamonds.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.880
 If you're out of the monopoly,

39:55.880 --> 39:58.640
 then human rights organizations descend on you

39:58.640 --> 40:02.200
 and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.200
 And they're also restricting

40:03.200 --> 40:04.480
 the production of artificial diamonds.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.320
 This is the other thing.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.440
 You can make artificial diamond,

40:06.440 --> 40:08.440
 you can't make artificial gold.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.080
 So they restrict the production of artificial diamond

40:11.080 --> 40:14.240
 and they try and insist that you shouldn't

40:14.240 --> 40:15.440
 take artificial diamonds,

40:15.440 --> 40:18.840
 but they're indistinguishable from real diamonds.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.360
 So it's an artificial scarcity

40:20.360 --> 40:22.160
 and I think there's gonna come a point at some point

40:22.160 --> 40:23.400
 that this monopoly is gonna break

40:23.400 --> 40:26.400
 and a lot of people are gonna be left with

40:26.400 --> 40:30.560
 essentially highly devalued jewelry.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.800
 I'm gonna take this segment of the podcast.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.600
 When I'm getting married, when the sun did,

40:34.600 --> 40:38.720
 and then instead you're getting water or Bitcoin.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.720
 Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.

40:40.720 --> 40:44.200
 So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin

40:44.200 --> 40:45.440
 is the thing that allows you

40:45.440 --> 40:47.960
 to most accurately capture human nature,

40:47.960 --> 40:50.880
 the actual day to day decisions that we humans make.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.680
 Yeah, that's really revolutionized economics, so 1870.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.240
 And that was Manger's work.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.640
 And then he had a student,

41:01.640 --> 41:05.080
 Eugen Bomberg, who developed capital theory.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.120
 And then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises,

41:07.120 --> 41:10.800
 who is arguably the most important economist ever.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.680
 And he developed a theory of money

41:12.680 --> 41:15.080
 and he wrote a book in 1912

41:15.080 --> 41:17.480
 called The Theory of Money and Credit.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.240
 And then in the 40s, he wrote Human Action,

41:20.240 --> 41:23.320
 which is a big treatise on economics.

41:23.320 --> 41:27.360
 And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.

41:27.360 --> 41:32.360
 And before World War I, this was just known as economics.

41:32.360 --> 41:35.600
 And then after what happened in World War I,

41:35.600 --> 41:37.760
 and I discussed this in detail in the fiat standard,

41:37.760 --> 41:42.240
 is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold

41:42.240 --> 41:45.240
 and tried to pass off their own credit

41:45.240 --> 41:49.800
 as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.400
 And incidentally here,

41:51.400 --> 41:54.080
 this is part of the history that is not discussed often here.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.360
 This is presented as an innovation.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.880
 Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school

42:00.880 --> 42:03.280
 that would justify what they did.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.400
 And later on, it's presented as,

42:05.400 --> 42:08.200
 oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.760
 And now look, we've built this thing

42:10.760 --> 42:11.880
 that is better than gold,

42:11.880 --> 42:13.520
 where now the government can just print money

42:13.520 --> 42:14.360
 whenever it wants.

42:14.360 --> 42:18.000
 And now gold money is not an issue anymore,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.080
 which is extremely idiotic

42:20.080 --> 42:23.400
 because the whole point of money is that it's not easy to make.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.920
 If it's easy to make, it's not money anymore.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.560
 It's just destroying the entire function of money.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.400
 And we've seen that happen extensively in the 20th century

42:30.400 --> 42:32.880
 after countries went off the gold standard.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.120
 So essentially, Keynesian economics

42:35.120 --> 42:36.680
 is just inflation apologia.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.960
 It's just propaganda to justify inflationism.

42:39.960 --> 42:43.200
 And it's profoundly nonsensical.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.240
 It's built on the idea that if you just make more money,

42:47.240 --> 42:49.480
 you can stimulate economic production.

42:49.480 --> 42:51.440
 And of course, this is very self serving

42:51.440 --> 42:53.200
 to the central banks and to the banks

42:53.200 --> 42:56.240
 and to the governments who promote this nonsense.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.680
 And this is also very pervasive.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.360
 If you've had them as fortunate of studying

43:00.360 --> 43:02.720
 at a university over the last century,

43:02.720 --> 43:04.840
 you were taught Keynesian garbage economics.

43:04.840 --> 43:09.040
 You were taught that if there's a problem in the economy,

43:09.040 --> 43:11.600
 the way to fix it is that the government prints money,

43:11.600 --> 43:13.440
 the government lowers the interest rate,

43:13.440 --> 43:17.320
 and then that leads to more economic production,

43:17.320 --> 43:18.880
 which is completely nonsensical.

43:18.880 --> 43:23.480
 So you're, again, for the listener,

43:23.480 --> 43:26.280
 you're using strong words and I will push back

43:26.280 --> 43:30.440
 just to please devil's advocate

43:30.440 --> 43:33.440
 to hopefully one day arrive at the truth.

43:33.440 --> 43:37.040
 So just because it's in the interest

43:37.040 --> 43:39.000
 of the central banks and the government,

43:39.000 --> 43:43.880
 the interests and the models of Keynesian economics

43:43.880 --> 43:47.480
 and the government are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.880
 So let's give them a chance.

43:49.880 --> 43:54.280
 So the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom

43:54.280 --> 43:58.440
 is that inflation is good in moderation

43:58.440 --> 44:01.120
 as it encourages spending, but too much is bad

44:01.120 --> 44:05.240
 because it completely devalues, destroys people's savings.

44:05.240 --> 44:09.120
 So a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.

44:09.120 --> 44:13.160
 And I mean, I suppose this is one of the things

44:13.160 --> 44:17.120
 that's supported by Keynesian economics.

44:17.120 --> 44:17.960
 Why is that wrong?

44:17.960 --> 44:19.640
 This is basically the whole point of Keynesian economics,

44:19.640 --> 44:23.440
 is to try and find an endless array of explanations

44:23.440 --> 44:25.800
 to explain why inflation is a good thing.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.320
 Well, the chicken and egg.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.520
 So that's the cynical take.

44:30.520 --> 44:32.000
 This is a propaganda machine

44:32.000 --> 44:34.040
 to sell the government's narrative.

44:34.040 --> 44:36.880
 The less cynical take is there's a bunch of economists

44:38.880 --> 44:39.720
 who figured out this thing

44:39.720 --> 44:42.360
 and it happens to be good for banks and governments.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.880
 And just because it's good for them doesn't mean.

44:43.880 --> 44:46.000
 And it justifies the existence of government

44:46.000 --> 44:50.640
 and your basic, I don't think it's your basic assumption,

44:50.640 --> 44:53.640
 but a foundational principle of your thought

44:53.640 --> 44:56.680
 is that a lot of government is not a good thing.

44:56.680 --> 45:00.440
 Your first gut instinct, government bad.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.920
 Like I mentioned, I live next door in Michael Malus

45:02.920 --> 45:07.120
 who probably beats you on the intensity

45:07.120 --> 45:10.040
 and how quickly he says government bad.

45:10.040 --> 45:15.040
 So there's a potential argument for government good.

45:16.320 --> 45:19.000
 Some government is good, maybe a lot of government is good.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.240
 Maybe we need a lot of centralized management

45:22.240 --> 45:23.880
 for resource allocation and so on

45:23.880 --> 45:26.920
 because we humans specialize, we're too busy and so on.

45:26.920 --> 45:30.000
 So there's an argument for that that exists.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.840
 You probably disagree with any possible argument on that side,

45:32.840 --> 45:36.800
 but anyway, so why is that idea of Kenzen economics wrong?

45:36.800 --> 45:39.560
 I'm gonna focus for this on the money idea,

45:39.560 --> 45:42.360
 the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.240
 The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that

45:46.240 --> 45:48.280
 without inflation, people wouldn't spend

45:48.280 --> 45:50.920
 and then the economy would come to a grinding halt.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.200
 And that's nonsensical because people spend

45:53.200 --> 45:56.040
 not because they wanna keep this magical monster

45:56.040 --> 45:58.040
 called the economy going,

45:58.040 --> 45:59.880
 people spend because they need to consume

45:59.880 --> 46:02.560
 because that's how we live, that's how we survive.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.360
 You need to eat, you need shelter,

46:04.360 --> 46:06.560
 you need clothes to keep you warm.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.800
 And as technology advances,

46:08.800 --> 46:11.080
 the capabilities of the things that we can do

46:11.080 --> 46:16.080
 with our time increases and so we wanna buy more things.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.400
 So people buy things because people want to consume.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.760
 There's a limitless desire to consume.

46:21.760 --> 46:26.760
 That there's no shortage of reasons for people to consume

46:26.760 --> 46:31.760
 whether it's food or Ferraris or private jets,

46:33.440 --> 46:35.360
 people just always wanna buy more.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.000
 Can I interrupt just really quick?

46:37.000 --> 46:40.080
 What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future

46:40.080 --> 46:45.080
 where they might want to buy things,

46:45.960 --> 46:48.160
 but they're really afraid because it seems like

46:48.160 --> 46:50.320
 there's a lot like a pandemic going on or whatever it is.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.720
 Yeah, that's good.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.520
 So fear of uncertainty is good.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.800
 Can you have too much fear of uncertainty?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.720
 Here's the thing, what I was saying is

46:57.720 --> 46:59.320
 I was making the point that

46:59.320 --> 47:02.440
 we don't need to be motivated to consume.

47:02.440 --> 47:05.240
 We have the insatiable desire to consume.

47:05.240 --> 47:08.600
 Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.480
 Everybody would like to have a bigger house.

47:10.480 --> 47:12.400
 Well, not everybody, some people have a big enough house,

47:12.400 --> 47:14.280
 but everybody would like a house.

47:14.280 --> 47:18.800
 Everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things,

47:18.800 --> 47:21.000
 electronics, machines.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
 So we don't need a desire to consume.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.560
 But of course, the limit on how much we consume

47:26.560 --> 47:29.360
 is opportunity cost.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.880
 Why don't you buy a Ferrari?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.360
 Well, because that's really expensive

47:32.360 --> 47:35.200
 and it would mean that, well, maybe you do have a Ferrari,

47:35.200 --> 47:36.920
 but I mean, most people don't buy a Ferrari

47:36.920 --> 47:39.920
 because it's too expensive, they can't afford it.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.600
 They'd have to work too hard to get it.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.720
 And if they do get it, it might mean

47:44.720 --> 47:46.560
 that they can't afford their house anymore.

47:46.560 --> 47:49.720
 So we have to economize, that's a good thing.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.000
 And we have to also think of the future.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.160
 And so humans consume, that we don't need more motivation

47:56.160 --> 47:59.560
 to consume, we have to deal with the economic reality

47:59.560 --> 48:03.040
 of the things that limit us from consuming more.

48:03.040 --> 48:06.760
 So what Keynesians present is that

48:06.760 --> 48:08.720
 when there is a problem in the economy,

48:08.720 --> 48:10.600
 like there was after World War I,

48:11.760 --> 48:16.760
 the problem is always caused by the inflation.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.920
 And what the Keynesian Hucksters do

48:18.920 --> 48:23.280
 is that they look at the consequences of inflation

48:23.280 --> 48:25.600
 and blame it on people not spending enough.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.360
 When people are doing the rational thing,

48:27.360 --> 48:30.520
 the money is, so there was inflation,

48:30.520 --> 48:34.360
 caused an unsustainable boom, it caused a recession,

48:34.360 --> 48:36.080
 and now a lot of people lost their jobs

48:36.080 --> 48:37.520
 and they don't have enough money to go out

48:37.520 --> 48:39.960
 and spend frivolously.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.720
 So they save for the future, the future is uncertain.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.400
 That's a good thing, that's how you fix things.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.920
 You begin the recovery by, well, you lost some wealth

48:49.920 --> 48:52.800
 so you spend less, like if your business goes bust,

48:52.800 --> 48:56.040
 if you lose your job, it's natural and smart

48:56.040 --> 48:58.560
 that you stop spending money on the frivolous thing

48:58.560 --> 49:01.520
 that you used to spend, and you save it for the future,

49:01.520 --> 49:04.240
 and you invest in something else, you get a new job,

49:04.240 --> 49:06.360
 and then once you've recovered, you start spending more.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.920
 This is very sane and very good,

49:08.920 --> 49:11.320
 and it's the way to recovery.

49:11.320 --> 49:14.680
 But essentially the Keynesians have used this

49:14.680 --> 49:17.480
 as a justification for more inflation,

49:17.480 --> 49:19.360
 because inflation is an addiction.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.320
 Once the government gets down the path

49:21.320 --> 49:23.800
 of spending money to solve its problems,

49:23.800 --> 49:26.880
 then every problem looks like it can be solved

49:26.880 --> 49:27.840
 by more inflation.

49:27.840 --> 49:31.440
 And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in,

49:31.440 --> 49:34.880
 and of course the Keynesian economics is based

49:34.880 --> 49:39.000
 on the work of Keynes, which came in the 1930s.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.040
 And this is the key point, like it's portrayed

49:42.040 --> 49:46.640
 in the textbook as if it's just this scientific breakthrough

49:46.640 --> 49:50.000
 that somebody in the 1930s, this genius came about

49:50.000 --> 49:53.320
 and realized that, oh, we don't actually need gold.

49:53.320 --> 49:54.320
 We don't need hard money.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.680
 We can actually just print all the money.

49:56.680 --> 50:00.680
 And in reality, of course, it was just the very thin,

50:00.680 --> 50:03.200
 flimsy, idiotic justification for what governments

50:03.200 --> 50:05.160
 were already doing for 20 years.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.640
 They'd already gone off the gold standard,

50:07.640 --> 50:11.080
 and they'd gone through 20 years in which they were lying

50:11.080 --> 50:12.760
 to their population, telling their population,

50:12.760 --> 50:14.080
 we're still on a gold standard,

50:14.080 --> 50:18.520
 but that our problems caused by various random things.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.120
 But don't worry, we're gonna be going back

50:20.120 --> 50:20.960
 on the gold standard.

50:20.960 --> 50:24.040
 20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,

50:24.040 --> 50:27.120
 they come up with this justification for why,

50:27.120 --> 50:29.920
 oh, actually, the gold standard was bad,

50:29.920 --> 50:32.480
 and this is a really pernicious thing about it,

50:32.480 --> 50:34.840
 is the problems that were caused by us going

50:34.840 --> 50:39.080
 off the gold standard were caused by the gold standard.

50:39.080 --> 50:41.400
 And we're going to fix them by going off

50:41.400 --> 50:42.880
 the gold standard even more.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.960
 Just because government is lying and it's shady

50:45.960 --> 50:47.280
 and it does these kinds of things

50:47.280 --> 50:49.680
 doesn't mean Kenzian economics is wrong.

50:49.680 --> 50:53.120
 So just, because I wanted to separate a few things you said,

50:53.120 --> 50:55.320
 it could very well be very wrong,

50:55.320 --> 50:57.040
 and they could indeed be hucksters.

50:57.040 --> 51:00.840
 All of these, such colorful language,

51:00.840 --> 51:03.280
 I love you deeply for this, this is fun.

51:03.280 --> 51:05.320
 Yeah, but I mean, it's not like somebody like Krugman

51:05.320 --> 51:07.960
 doesn't use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.

51:07.960 --> 51:10.720
 It's just that when actors like him use it,

51:10.720 --> 51:13.280
 it's presented as if it is legitimate

51:13.280 --> 51:15.640
 because he's part of the major shows.

51:17.040 --> 51:21.160
 So the case they make, and the criticism

51:21.160 --> 51:24.080
 Kenzians make of Austrian economics,

51:24.080 --> 51:25.720
 and the case they make for Kenzian economics

51:25.720 --> 51:28.160
 is it's based on empirical evidence.

51:28.160 --> 51:32.960
 So Austrian economists are pie in the sky,

51:32.960 --> 51:37.360
 theorists about how human nature works,

51:37.360 --> 51:39.480
 and it's just all theory.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.520
 And just like you said, Kenzian economics

51:41.520 --> 51:44.760
 kind of sell it as a science, data driven science.

51:44.760 --> 51:49.760
 And so where's the data, bro, on the Austrian?

51:50.600 --> 51:52.880
 So one way of saying it is

51:55.040 --> 51:58.000
 how do you know if we get rid of inflation?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.040
 How do you know if we get rid of central banks?

52:00.040 --> 52:02.600
 If we push towards that direction,

52:02.600 --> 52:06.760
 we will have a better world, a better functioning economy,

52:06.760 --> 52:10.880
 better functioning markets, better functioning society.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.400
 This is another inaccurate way

52:13.400 --> 52:15.120
 in which they present the economics.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.600
 They present as if it's just theory

52:16.600 --> 52:19.760
 and the data doesn't matter, but that's not the case.

52:19.760 --> 52:23.120
 What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory,

52:23.120 --> 52:26.440
 data is mute, data is dumb, data can't say anything.

52:26.440 --> 52:31.160
 So theory first, and then you have to have models

52:32.640 --> 52:35.280
 to provide context for interpretation of the data.

52:35.280 --> 52:38.200
 Exactly, and it's a sign of just how little self awareness

52:38.200 --> 52:41.360
 they have that they think that they're just being led

52:41.360 --> 52:44.520
 by the data when they're being led

52:44.520 --> 52:46.440
 by Kenz's moronic theories.

52:47.320 --> 52:50.920
 And they use the data to justify those theories

52:50.920 --> 52:52.400
 and to stick by them.

52:52.400 --> 52:55.000
 And in fact, they are the ones whose theories

52:55.000 --> 52:58.920
 cannot be refuted because it's just government

52:58.920 --> 53:00.360
 mandated religion.

53:00.360 --> 53:05.360
 So according to Kenz's nonsense, so the way

53:06.720 --> 53:08.920
 that the whole thing is, the way that they justify

53:08.920 --> 53:11.480
 the inflationism is this, and I'm just using this

53:11.480 --> 53:13.480
 to give an example of what you're talking about

53:13.480 --> 53:16.000
 in terms of theory, the way they justify the inflationism

53:16.000 --> 53:17.800
 to tie it back to the original point,

53:17.800 --> 53:20.080
 they justify the, all right, we need the money to spend.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.120
 And then the level of spending in the economy

53:22.120 --> 53:23.720
 is what determines the state of the economy.

53:23.720 --> 53:26.080
 And I've taught macroeconomics at university level

53:26.080 --> 53:27.520
 for a while, so I know this.

53:27.520 --> 53:31.280
 I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians,

53:31.280 --> 53:34.160
 no Austrians, if not all of them, I guarantee you.

53:34.160 --> 53:38.200
 And so the way they see it is the level of spending

53:38.200 --> 53:40.400
 in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.720
 There's a level of output and there's a level of spending.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.480
 So there's like the factories on the one side

53:44.480 --> 53:46.760
 that are churning out goods, and those goods have

53:46.760 --> 53:50.200
 a certain quantity and value, market value,

53:50.200 --> 53:51.680
 is completely nonsensical, of course,

53:51.680 --> 53:54.880
 because how can the value of the goods produced

53:54.880 --> 53:56.720
 be different from the value of the spending?

53:56.720 --> 53:59.080
 But let's put that aside for a second.

54:00.120 --> 54:02.480
 So the amount of spending that happens in the economy

54:02.480 --> 54:04.160
 determines the state of the economy.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.840
 If the value of the production, which they call Y,

54:07.840 --> 54:10.320
 is higher than the aggregate expenditure,

54:10.320 --> 54:12.440
 so this is the production, and the aggregate expenditure

54:12.440 --> 54:15.080
 is lower, then we don't have enough spending

54:15.080 --> 54:18.280
 to buy all the goods, and then that causes a recession.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.760
 The factories start laying off workers,

54:20.760 --> 54:23.320
 and then the laid off workers start spending less,

54:23.320 --> 54:25.520
 and then that leads to aggregate expenditure

54:25.520 --> 54:28.320
 dropping even further, and so it's a vicious cycle

54:28.320 --> 54:30.560
 where the economy gets into recession,

54:30.560 --> 54:34.000
 and the only way out is for Keynes's banks to buddies

54:34.000 --> 54:36.080
 and government buddies to print a lot of money

54:36.080 --> 54:39.440
 to give to themselves, and then that will...

54:39.440 --> 54:43.080
 That's one interpreter, so to print more money,

54:43.080 --> 54:46.320
 to increase the expenditure, to match the supply...

54:46.320 --> 54:47.360
 To match the level of output.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.240
 Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.800
 All right.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.600
 Even though you're saying Huckster, so...

54:52.600 --> 54:53.440
 Yes.

54:53.440 --> 54:56.520
 You know, the way... I love you very much,

54:56.520 --> 54:59.680
 but just for people who are listening,

54:59.680 --> 55:02.960
 I think it's... I love the way you talk,

55:02.960 --> 55:05.960
 and it's great, and keep doing it, but just for context,

55:07.520 --> 55:10.880
 like I don't know anything that involves human nature

55:10.880 --> 55:12.480
 deserves this level of certainty.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.360
 I, at least my position is that we don't know

55:15.360 --> 55:18.240
 what the hell we're doing on basically anything, and...

55:18.240 --> 55:19.320
 Perhaps, but I mean...

55:19.320 --> 55:23.760
 Like, there's a lot... Like, certainty can get us in trouble,

55:23.760 --> 55:24.600
 is my worry.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.240
 I don't know much about economics.

55:27.240 --> 55:30.800
 I don't even know financial systems, monetary systems,

55:32.240 --> 55:35.440
 but I just seen us get in trouble with human psychology.

55:35.440 --> 55:36.280
 Certainty.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.440
 Certainty of ideologies in general.

55:38.440 --> 55:40.400
 You mentioned Marxism and so on.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.200
 I came from the Soviet Union.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.480
 There's a lot of people that are very certain

55:44.480 --> 55:46.640
 throughout the history of the 20th century

55:46.640 --> 55:51.640
 that communism is the utopia that humanity should strive for.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.400
 So I'm nervous around certainty.

55:54.400 --> 55:57.240
 I could be wrong, but you ask me for my opinion.

55:57.240 --> 55:58.080
 Yes, yes.

55:58.080 --> 56:00.280
 Sorry, so it's that little bit of a caveat.

56:00.280 --> 56:03.240
 So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand,

56:03.240 --> 56:04.560
 you have the level of...

56:04.560 --> 56:07.160
 If the other situation is when the level of spending

56:07.160 --> 56:10.040
 is higher than the amount of aggregate output.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.840
 In that situation, you have too much spending,

56:11.840 --> 56:14.640
 so therefore what ends up happening is inflation.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.200
 So according to the Keynesian worldview,

56:16.200 --> 56:18.280
 this is really important because this is a way

56:18.280 --> 56:20.960
 that I'm gonna get to your point about empirical data

56:20.960 --> 56:25.960
 and to show you why they're not correct.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.360
 Yeah, they're not correct about what they say

56:28.360 --> 56:29.640
 about empirical data.

56:29.640 --> 56:32.640
 So then what this means is that there's a level of output

56:32.640 --> 56:34.240
 and there's a level of aggregate expenditure.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.120
 The aggregate expenditure can either be higher

56:36.120 --> 56:38.680
 or lower than the output or equal to it.

56:38.680 --> 56:41.720
 If it's higher, we get inflation.

56:41.720 --> 56:46.640
 If it's lower, we get recessions, okay?

56:46.640 --> 56:50.040
 So is there any universe in this model?

56:50.040 --> 56:52.200
 Is there any post potential universe

56:52.200 --> 56:56.320
 in which you can have both inflation and a recession?

56:56.320 --> 56:59.400
 According to the Keynesian model, you can't, right?

56:59.400 --> 57:02.680
 Because aggregate expenditure cannot be both higher

57:02.680 --> 57:04.980
 and lower than output.

57:04.980 --> 57:08.480
 So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person,

57:08.480 --> 57:11.480
 if you were looking at evidence and trying to be,

57:11.480 --> 57:13.880
 trying to analyze data, you'd look at this

57:13.880 --> 57:17.720
 and say one example, you just need one example

57:17.720 --> 57:20.240
 of high inflation and high unemployment

57:20.240 --> 57:23.720
 to refute this entire model, right?

57:23.720 --> 57:26.000
 And of course, the world is full of examples

57:26.000 --> 57:28.160
 of high inflation and high unemployment.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.360
 And that's what happened in the 19th,

57:29.360 --> 57:31.440
 and of course, they ignored it when it happens

57:31.440 --> 57:34.480
 in poor countries because poor countries don't really matter.

57:34.480 --> 57:37.200
 But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US

57:37.200 --> 57:38.280
 and in the Western economies

57:38.280 --> 57:40.380
 and the most advanced industrial economies.

57:40.380 --> 57:42.440
 So historically, before then,

57:42.440 --> 57:45.720
 you had all these Keynesian central bankers

57:47.160 --> 57:48.960
 talking about this model and saying, you know,

57:48.960 --> 57:51.040
 well, aggregate expenditure is too low now

57:51.040 --> 57:52.440
 and that's why we have unemployment.

57:52.440 --> 57:53.600
 So we need to print more money.

57:53.600 --> 57:56.480
 And then they print more money, inflation goes up,

57:56.480 --> 57:58.380
 but also unemployment goes up

57:59.340 --> 58:01.840
 because this model is broken.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.240
 That's not how the world works.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.520
 That's not, the level of aggregate spending

58:05.520 --> 58:07.960
 in the economy is not a lever

58:07.960 --> 58:10.800
 with which you can control inflation and unemployment.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.880
 So what would a scientist do?

58:12.880 --> 58:15.400
 What would a nonhuxter do in this case?

58:17.320 --> 58:18.680
 Admit the theories wrong

58:18.680 --> 58:21.240
 and find another way to reformulate it.

58:21.240 --> 58:23.040
 Have the Keynesians done that?

58:23.040 --> 58:25.560
 No, still the same garbage in the textbook

58:25.560 --> 58:27.120
 that is being taught until today.

58:27.120 --> 58:29.680
 So is it possible to have a non Keynesian model

58:29.680 --> 58:32.760
 where one that still supports moderate amount

58:32.760 --> 58:34.560
 of inflation is good for the economy?

58:34.560 --> 58:37.080
 I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened,

58:37.080 --> 58:42.080
 yeah, this is what basically most fiat economists

58:43.280 --> 58:44.120
 as I like to call them,

58:44.120 --> 58:46.580
 essentially anybody at a university financed by governments

58:46.580 --> 58:47.920
 which is financed by central banks,

58:47.920 --> 58:48.760
 which is financed by fiat.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.100
 We'll talk about that.

58:50.100 --> 58:53.880
 The effect of fiat money on our life

58:53.880 --> 58:57.080
 as you write about in your book, fiat standard,

58:57.080 --> 58:58.480
 one of them is education.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.280
 I'm sure we'll disagree there too.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.040
 Not smart enough to disagree, but I'll disagree anyway.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.240
 So yeah, so a whole bunch of other models came up,

59:06.240 --> 59:10.680
 but basically it's such an example of motivated reasoning.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.320
 Like anybody who's got a familiarity

59:12.320 --> 59:14.440
 with the scientific method or who's got an engineering

59:14.440 --> 59:16.280
 background who comes into economics

59:16.280 --> 59:18.640
 immediately has a lot of red flags.

59:18.640 --> 59:22.360
 And I remember when I used to teach macroeconomics,

59:22.360 --> 59:24.520
 I used to teach introductory macroeconomics

59:24.520 --> 59:26.600
 and it's a course that would be taken by econ majors

59:26.600 --> 59:27.680
 as well as engineers.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.640
 A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.

59:29.640 --> 59:31.080
 And every time I'd explain the,

59:31.080 --> 59:33.280
 and I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff.

59:33.280 --> 59:34.200
 And every time I'd explain it,

59:34.200 --> 59:36.000
 there's always that smart engineering kid

59:36.000 --> 59:38.040
 who just looks at me and says,

59:38.040 --> 59:39.600
 sir, this doesn't make any sense

59:39.600 --> 59:41.240
 because this and this and that.

59:41.240 --> 59:43.040
 And I'm always like, you get it.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.720
 Exactly, you're correct.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.400
 Because if you have any kind of shred

59:46.400 --> 59:48.440
 of scientific thinking, you see

59:48.440 --> 59:50.200
 that this is all motivated reasoning.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.800
 Like the answer is government needs to print money.

59:52.800 --> 59:55.680
 And here's a whole bunch of models

59:55.680 --> 59:58.240
 brought up by people for why government printing money

59:58.240 --> 59:59.080
 is good.

59:59.080 --> 1:00:01.960
 And the reason they're coming up to this conclusion

1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:03.560
 is that you only get funded if you come up

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:04.400
 with this conclusion.

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:05.240
 If you come up with a conclusion

1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:08.280
 that we need to shut down the central bank,

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:10.120
 you don't get funded by the central bank.

1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:11.640
 You don't get published in the journals.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:14.560
 You don't get a job at the prestigious universities.

1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:17.000
 You don't get quoted by fiat publications

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:18.840
 like the New York Times and CNN.

1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:21.360
 They don't invite you on as an expert.

1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:22.560
 Well, that's a fundamental flaw

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:24.960
 with a lot of institutions we have today.

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:27.000
 And throughout human history.

1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.520
 Let me zoom out for just a second to the big question.

1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:32.440
 What is economics in general?

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:33.280
 What's the goal?

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:34.960
 You said there's a bunch of models.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:37.640
 Is any economist basically trying to throw a bunch

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:40.040
 of models about human behavior on the table

1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:43.920
 and try to generalize it to the global scale?

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:47.080
 So both dance between micro and macro somehow

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:49.120
 in order to determine public policy

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:53.080
 and explain the past, predict the future,

1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:56.920
 prescribe policies that can control the future,

1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:57.880
 those kinds of things.

1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:00.160
 That's the big, basic, ridiculous question.

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:02.080
 What is economics?

1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:04.760
 Economics is the study, the way the Austrians define it

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:07.200
 is the study of how humans make choices

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:09.120
 under the condition of scarcity.

1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:11.040
 And we begin with the starting point of economics

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:14.160
 as the fact that scarcity exists.

1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:16.520
 And why does scarcity exist?

1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:18.360
 Well, because it's easier to want things

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:19.440
 than it is to make them.

1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:23.280
 It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.280
 And so because we have wants and we have limited means

1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:32.240
 to meet those wants, we need to economize.

1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:37.200
 It's a permanent marker of the human condition.

1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:39.960
 We are always economizing at all times.

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:43.040
 And so how people make those decisions

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:47.520
 under the conditions of scarcity is what economists study.

1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:49.920
 So to go back to your point on empiricism

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:53.040
 in Austrian school, so it isn't that the Austrians

1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:55.680
 don't believe in data.

1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:00.520
 On the contrary, it's that theory has to inform data.

1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:02.480
 And in fact, if you think about it,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:06.680
 as the example of the stagflation of the 1970s shows,

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:11.880
 if you have stagflation, that just completely refutes

1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:13.440
 the Keynesian model.

1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.880
 The Austrian way of thinking, which is think

1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:18.960
 from first principles, understand how the world

1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:21.400
 actually works, think about how humans act,

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.160
 and understand that economics is really all

1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:24.000
 about human action.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.640
 So it's not about aggregates of goods.

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:28.000
 This is really the key distinction

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.520
 in terms of methodology for the Keynesians.

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:32.840
 It's physics envy.

1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:34.360
 They look at the market economy,

1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:36.720
 that it could individuals in the market economy,

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.320
 and they think that they can understand

1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:40.800
 the market economy by looking at aggregates.

1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:43.480
 This is really the key point of what I think

1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:48.080
 makes the certain branch of economics pseudoscientific

1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:49.800
 is the introduction of aggregates.

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:52.480
 When you introduce those aggregates,

1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:54.440
 how much production takes place,

1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:56.560
 how many people are unemployed,

1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:59.560
 the percentage of the inflation rate,

1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:01.520
 and then you think that you can establish

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:04.840
 scientific relationship between those aggregates.

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:07.160
 It's purely physics envy.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:09.960
 In physics, for instance, or in chemistry,

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:13.880
 you put, let's say, a container with contains a gas,

1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:18.360
 and you have the ideal gas law, pv equals to nrt.

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:20.920
 Calculate the pressure, calculate the volume,

1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:23.800
 and then the temperature.

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.600
 You can, if you have the pressure and volume,

1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:26.640
 you can calculate the temperature

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.040
 because you have the nrt constants.

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:32.720
 So there's a clear relationship

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:34.600
 that has been demonstrated in a laboratory,

1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:36.600
 and that we can do it right now.

1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:38.240
 We can measure it, and we can see it,

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:40.040
 and it's continuous to hold.

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:42.760
 And all it takes is one scientist

1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:44.800
 to show that this relationship does not hold,

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:48.040
 to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold,

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:50.840
 and it stops being a law of chemistry,

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:52.800
 and it's broken.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.400
 Whereas in economics, what they've done

1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:00.200
 is they've copied the superficial shape of this

1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:02.880
 without any of the scientific rigor

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:04.840
 that was used to build it.

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:05.880
 There's no experiments.

1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:08.120
 You can't experiment on economies.

1:04:08.120 --> 1:04:11.760
 We don't have the ability to establish laws,

1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:13.360
 and all the laws that we establish

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:15.400
 are just models that get people published

1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:18.120
 and get them on the media to say,

1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:20.560
 my model says we need to print more money,

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:23.440
 but it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:25.600
 If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes

1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:28.200
 because the world is full of examples that contradict them.

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:30.200
 Was it possible to do scientific scrutiny

1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:33.760
 when it's human nature, when there's a nearly infant number

1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:36.720
 of variables, and you can't control them?

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.160
 So what's the best thing you could possibly do?

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:43.080
 You do thought experiments.

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:46.480
 But the problem with thought experiments,

1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:49.800
 Freud thinks everybody wants to have sex with their mother.

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:50.640
 Is he right?

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:51.760
 That's the problem with Freud.

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:53.760
 I don't know, maybe he's right.

1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:55.920
 Well, obviously, I'm joking on that front,

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:59.000
 but Freud is probably under the canes.

1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:03.640
 Well, no, I think there's power to the thought experiment.

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.400
 Just like Einstein, a lot of general relativity,

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.280
 special relativity, that's a thought experiment.

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:10.840
 It originates in a thought experiment.

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:12.080
 Now, is it true?

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:14.640
 A nice thing about physics,

1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:17.440
 you can't eventually have experiment to validation.

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:20.880
 The downside of economics is you really can't have

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.640
 experimental, definitive experimental scientific rigor

1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:27.080
 of validation of a theory.

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:29.160
 So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment

1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:30.800
 using your intuition.

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.680
 It's the power of reasoning together about human nature.

1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:36.520
 And that's why economics cannot make the claims

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:37.360
 that physics can make.

1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.720
 So with physics, you can predict that if you get this gas

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:42.320
 at this pressure, at this volume,

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:44.000
 the temperature will be that much.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.320
 And you can make that prediction

1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:47.840
 and test it a million times

1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:50.360
 and you'll always get the precisely correct answer.

1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:53.000
 With economics, we can't make quantitative predictions.

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.880
 But still, on Twitter, and even today,

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:57.680
 you're very certain about the statements you're making.

1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:58.520
 Do you?

1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:00.480
 Yeah, but I don't make quantitatively certain statements.

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:01.320
 That's the thing.

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.360
 In economics, we don't make quantitative predictions.

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:06.120
 We cannot do that because we don't have experiments.

1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:09.640
 But we can understand how the world actually works

1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:10.480
 with humility.

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:11.640
 This is really the key difference,

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:13.960
 that the Keynesians think they just want to copy

1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:15.080
 the methods of physics,

1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:18.480
 and then that's just gonna give them the certainty

1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:19.440
 of the results of physics.

1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:20.280
 Which is like me saying,

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:23.680
 I'm just gonna put a red blanket on my back

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.160
 and jump from the fourth floor because I'm Superman.

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:28.520
 Well, it's not the red blanket that's gonna make me Superman.

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:30.160
 It does a lot more to it.

1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:33.480
 So humility manifests itself in economics

1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:35.600
 as the belief in a free market.

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:37.400
 Meaning like, I can't centralize,

1:06:37.400 --> 1:06:41.200
 I can't do centralized control on this thing.

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:46.000
 We're going to minimize the friction of the free exchange

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.440
 of goods.

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:52.280
 So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:55.640
 Yes, and you could arrive at it through two paths.

1:06:55.640 --> 1:06:59.920
 The more practical path,

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:02.120
 which most scientific minded people arrive at,

1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.520
 and I came from an engineering background.

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:05.040
 So I initially had this idea

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:09.200
 that what is lacking in economics is mathematicization.

1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:11.280
 We need to have better math models.

1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:13.120
 We need to get all of those tools from engineering,

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:14.200
 apply them to economics,

1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:17.120
 and then we'll be able to plan the world economy

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.280
 and make it work better.

1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:21.000
 And then you start actually trying to solve problems,

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.320
 trying to actually calculate them.

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:24.720
 And you realize nobody can have that ability

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:28.440
 because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact,

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:29.800
 we can't have experiments.

1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:31.080
 And the reason we can't have experiments

1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:33.920
 is that you can experiment on particles of a gas.

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:37.440
 You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies.

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.160
 And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:46.040
 And so you kick matter in a certain way,

1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:48.720
 you can calculate exactly how much is going to fly.

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:50.360
 Human beings are much more complex.

1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:51.680
 They have a will inside them.

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:52.920
 And this is really,

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:55.400
 this is the humility to understand

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:56.560
 that you are a human being

1:07:56.560 --> 1:07:59.400
 and other people are also human being just like you.

1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.600
 And that the, you know, every person wakes up every morning

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:06.400
 and they have a million things in their mind,

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:07.680
 a million things they care about,

1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:09.480
 a million things they want to do.

1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:13.240
 And you will never be able to make the decisions

1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:14.320
 for somebody else,

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:16.680
 let alone for millions of other people.

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:18.320
 So this is one path by which you arrive

1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:20.040
 at the conclusion that free markets are better

1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:21.760
 because you realize that all of the people

1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:24.680
 that think that they can centrally plan markets

1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:26.920
 can't actually do that.

1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:30.560
 And that there's really nothing scientific about them,

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.200
 except essentially the rituals they ape

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:35.320
 of the scientific process.

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:38.120
 And the other path I think that makes you arrive

1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:40.200
 at the Austrian perspective

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:42.440
 or at the libertarian perspective I should say

1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:47.000
 is simply the notion of individuals

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.720
 as having their own inalienable right

1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:51.800
 to decide what they want to do with themselves.

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:55.720
 If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself

1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:59.280
 the idea that you get to be planner

1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:02.520
 is ultimately you think you're better than other people.

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:05.840
 You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine.

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:08.080
 And I don't think that's a defensible position.

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:11.640
 I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever.

1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:13.480
 I will never want to force anybody

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:15.840
 to do anything they don't want.

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:16.960
 The Keynesian perspective,

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:21.280
 the central planning perspective is unlike physics,

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.240
 which is let's force a bunch of particles

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:26.120
 to sit in the lab so that we can study them.

1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.520
 In economics, you're forcing people to do things.

1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:31.120
 Let's stop these people from doing this job

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:32.400
 because it's bad for the economy

1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:34.040
 and let's get them to do that job.

1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:35.720
 Let's force them to pay this price.

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:37.520
 Let's tax them this much.

1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:39.480
 Let's prevent them from using gold as money

1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:42.280
 and force them to use our credit as money.

1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:44.560
 So it has to rely on coercion.

1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:46.640
 There's no central planning without coercion.

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:49.200
 And coercion is a crime in my opinion.

1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:51.360
 There's no way that it is justifiable morally

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:52.200
 or absolutely.

1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:55.320
 So from a politics, from an ethical perspective,

1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:58.720
 your view is the, I mean, perhaps broadly speaking,

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:03.720
 the libertarian view is coercion is the unethical.

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:05.320
 Freedom is essential.

1:10:07.400 --> 1:10:09.960
 What is, what are the pros and cons

1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:12.360
 of government intervention in the economy?

1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:14.880
 So can you steal, can you provide pros?

1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:18.240
 You just kind of provided arguments against,

1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:20.880
 is there any arguments to be made

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:22.600
 for government intervention,

1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:25.240
 for the role of government in society?

1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:28.600
 Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective,

1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:31.440
 what is the positive role of government

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:33.440
 that you can imagine you can speak to?

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:34.880
 I can repeat many other cases,

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:37.000
 but I don't find any of them compelling

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.040
 for the reason that I mentioned,

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:41.280
 which is that ultimately they all rely on

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.480
 putting a gun to somebody's head

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:43.760
 and using the threat of force.

1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:46.040
 So that's for me, it can never be justifiable.

1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:47.880
 Whatever the ends are,

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.880
 if the means are violence and the threat of violence,

1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:55.040
 then the ends aren't justified.

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.360
 Everything that's good,

1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:58.320
 governments will use as an excuse

1:10:58.320 --> 1:10:59.880
 to justify coercion.

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:01.480
 So, what do you like?

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:03.040
 You like motherhood and apple pie?

1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:04.280
 Well, government needs to ensure

1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:06.000
 that motherhood works well

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.480
 and we need government central planning of birth.

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:11.360
 We need regulations on birth, for instance.

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:14.440
 We need regulations on how people give birth.

1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:16.120
 We need to ban people from giving birth

1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:18.080
 in traditional ways that have been tried

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:18.920
 for thousands of years.

1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:20.960
 We need to force people to do things

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:22.800
 in the modern scientific way.

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:24.720
 Well, so what about things like

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:28.160
 that all of us use, so infrastructure, for example,

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:33.160
 or education, or well, the economy too, right?

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:38.440
 Can you make a case for the role

1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:42.120
 of some large scale centralized systems,

1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:43.600
 whether it's government or not,

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:45.360
 that do this kind of management?

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:46.720
 I guess perhaps you could say

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:48.840
 there's the economies of scale argument

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:52.280
 that some things must exist at a very large scale

1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:56.840
 and therefore you would want political accountability

1:11:56.840 --> 1:11:58.120
 of the people who manage them.

1:11:58.120 --> 1:11:59.080
 This is kind of the argument

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:01.440
 that's given for infrastructure monopolies,

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:03.680
 for instance, roads or electricity.

1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:08.200
 Let's say we live in a country, we need one power plant.

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:11.160
 The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be.

1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:15.000
 And there's a natural monopoly in the power plant business.

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.160
 So we're gonna have to have one power plant

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.360
 and since it's only one power plant,

1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:22.080
 then we can't just let anybody own it

1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:24.360
 because then they're gonna make it too expensive.

1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:26.240
 So we need to have the government own it.

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:28.200
 So it can make it too expensive.

1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:29.920
 And you don't find that case compelling?

1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:30.760
 Not at all.

1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:31.600
 I used to believe in it.

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:33.600
 I was pretty much a Keynesian

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.320
 when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia.

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:40.160
 And no, I don't find that compelling at all

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:42.120
 because I think all these examples

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.000
 that they mentioned of natural monopolies

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.360
 or economies of scale that can only fit

1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:50.200
 at a scale of government, it's always,

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.520
 it's always, government bans people

1:12:52.520 --> 1:12:54.400
 from opening power plants.

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:56.120
 And then there's only one power plant

1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:58.160
 and they need to be in charge of it.

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:02.800
 But in reality, no, in reality,

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.560
 power plants can exist at all kinds of manners

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.400
 of scales of operation.

1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:08.840
 And yes, of course, there are benefits to centralization

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.280
 in power plants in particular

1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:13.160
 because there's efficiency in generation.

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:17.080
 One big power plant is more efficient

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:20.000
 than 10 equivalent smaller power plants.

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.280
 But there's also inefficiencies in centralization

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:25.520
 because the more centralized and the bigger the plant is,

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:29.920
 the further away a lot of the population is going to be.

1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:31.080
 So you're gonna be losing a lot

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:33.560
 of the electricity and transmission.

1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:36.040
 And you believe the free market is best in managing

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:39.240
 that dance, that balance of how centralization.

1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:41.560
 Exactly, and if we do end up in a situation

1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:44.360
 where there's one power plant for an area,

1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:48.960
 then if the market ends up centralizing all of it

1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:52.760
 into one power plant, I don't see that as a problem.

1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:54.880
 There are places, there's a small town

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:56.120
 with only one barbershop.

1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:57.520
 Is that a catastrophe?

1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.960
 No, because they don't need two barbershops.

1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:03.560
 Now, if that barbershop started to take advantage of people,

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.440
 started to charge higher price,

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:07.040
 well, then that's just an opportunity

1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:10.080
 for others to step in and put them in their place.

1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:11.480
 And that's the same thing with power plants,

1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:13.640
 it's the same thing with everything.

1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:17.320
 Ultimately, I think the key thing is this,

1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:20.160
 from the central planning perspective,

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:22.760
 they'll present you the problem as it is

1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:24.640
 and they'll tell you, well, this is bad.

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:28.120
 So the fix, and what we can do is better.

1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:31.920
 So let's stop what's bad and do what is better.

1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:34.000
 Two problems here, usually the reason

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.640
 that the thing is bad in the first place

1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:37.120
 is because it is a government monopoly,

1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:39.160
 it's because of government intervention.

1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:42.000
 But the second thing is that this notion

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.200
 that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong

1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.720
 and make it better, it ignores the fundamental

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:51.880
 underlying reality, which is that what you're doing is

1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:55.520
 you're offering only one way for this problem to be solved

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:58.360
 and making all other solutions practically illegal.

1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:00.160
 You're taking taxpayer money,

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.000
 you're putting guns to people's heads,

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.120
 to take their money, to use it to build, say,

1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.080
 this one solution for a power plant,

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:08.480
 but you're preventing the free market process

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:11.320
 from providing us with other alternatives.

1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:13.720
 Well, so you phrased it from that perspective,

1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:18.480
 but in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism

1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:22.360
 for the solution that you propose and enforce

1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:25.840
 by, as you're saying, placing a gun to people's head,

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.160
 you're accountable for that choice,

1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:32.640
 for the quality of that solution by being voted out

1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:34.720
 if the solution is actually bad.

1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:37.360
 So it's just a different selection mechanism.

1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:39.840
 And I think I personally believe

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:43.560
 it is a selection mechanism that has worked in the past.

1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.560
 It just often does not work nearly as well as a free market.

1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:52.040
 And the question is, are there domains

1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:54.760
 in which the free market gets itself into trouble?

1:15:54.760 --> 1:15:58.040
 So this theoretical view is that

1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:00.040
 that's the point of a free market,

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:04.080
 is it doesn't, if there's trouble, that's a signal

1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:05.800
 and it will respond to that signal

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:07.880
 and it will respond appropriately

1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:10.360
 to make you try to maximize happiness.

1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:12.480
 The question is, is there a local optima

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:15.640
 that free markets get stuck in and need governments

1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:19.120
 to represent the broader scale of the people

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:20.520
 to get outside of that?

1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:23.200
 I think the fundamental problem here

1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:26.120
 is the idea that there is a feedback mechanism

1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:28.920
 when there is coercion in one party,

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:30.920
 when one party can employ coercion

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:31.760
 and the other one cannot.

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:34.840
 So in other words, I'm gonna put a gun to your head,

1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:36.280
 I'm gonna take your money,

1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:37.880
 and I'm gonna use it to buy more guns for me

1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:39.960
 to put against your head.

1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:43.000
 But somehow, you're gonna put a paper in a box

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.920
 and that's going to deactivate my guns.

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.040
 Well, love requires a push and pull,

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:50.360
 a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship,

1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:51.200
 I think.

1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:52.400
 Yeah, I mean...

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:53.320
 A little gun to the head,

1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:54.160
 not sometimes.

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:55.560
 Good luck to anybody who's gonna be dating you

1:16:55.560 --> 1:16:57.200
 if you think you're putting a gun to people's head,

1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:58.840
 it's comparable to a relationship.

1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:01.200
 All jokes.

1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:04.600
 But yes, I mean, the people don't often think of it

1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:08.320
 as gun to the head, as government and the military

1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:10.440
 as gun to the head.

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:13.680
 But that is sort of a libertarian perspective

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:15.720
 because ultimately when you, you know,

1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:18.680
 turtles all the way down and at the bottom, there's guns.

1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:20.760
 Yeah, so at the bottom, if you don't wanna pay,

1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:21.600
 if you don't wanna, you know,

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:23.200
 all right, I don't wanna be part of your power plant,

1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:25.400
 I wanna get my own generator, I don't wanna do it,

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:26.600
 and I don't wanna pay for it.

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.560
 You go to jail, you can't not pay for it.

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:29.600
 That's really the asymmetry,

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:30.560
 which the market doesn't have,

1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:32.800
 which is why, in my opinion,

1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:35.280
 it's not as if, you know, I'm being stubborn

1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:37.880
 and stuck on the idea that I want a market

1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:39.400
 and that the government can't work.

1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:40.480
 It's presented as if, you know,

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:42.720
 we're choosing between two different machines,

1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:45.800
 you know, should we use an Apple or a PC?

1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:48.560
 And I'm just constantly choosing one of them

1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:50.520
 and saying that the other government can't work.

1:17:50.520 --> 1:17:52.360
 It's not equivalent, it's not two machines.

1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:56.520
 We're comparing between a machine and a gun to the head.

1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:58.640
 And we're comparing between a situation in which

1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:01.840
 anybody anywhere is free to provide the service

1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:05.000
 or the good and anybody anywhere is free to buy it from them

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:06.800
 or reject to buy it from them.

1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:08.720
 So anyone can build a power plant.

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:11.040
 Anyone can succeed, anybody can fail at it.

1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:13.440
 Anybody can build it in a way that I can choose

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:15.840
 to take part in or not take part in.

1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:17.120
 I can build my own.

1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:19.280
 So we have a situation in which 10 million people,

1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:22.800
 let's say, they each can freely choose

1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:25.440
 to provide the good or to buy the good.

1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:28.680
 That cannot be considered an alternative

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:31.440
 on an equal footing to a situation where one person

1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:34.720
 or one entity gets to decide for everybody

1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:37.080
 and those who disagree go to jail.

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:41.760
 So the problem is that the alternative to governments

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:44.480
 is other large successful entities

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:47.040
 that have humans in them and human nature is such

1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:50.040
 that there's corruption manipulation and so on.

1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:55.040
 I think free market depends on the honest communication

1:18:56.880 --> 1:18:59.840
 of information as widely as possible

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:02.480
 so people can make great rational decisions.

1:19:02.480 --> 1:19:06.160
 But sort of my fear is that like the proposal is

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.000
 that in general there's manipulation

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.080
 whether it's government, whether it's companies,

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:11.280
 they're going to manipulate,

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:12.960
 they're going to try to do propaganda,

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:16.920
 they're going to try to manipulate you, deceive you,

1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:19.840
 shut down competition by playing games,

1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:21.520
 human games of different kinds.

1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:24.280
 And sometimes even meaning well,

1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:26.040
 it's not like everybody thinks they're doing good

1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:27.520
 and they're actually doing evil.

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:32.680
 So how do we prevent the worst of human nature coming out

1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:34.920
 in a free market as well?

1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:38.080
 By not giving the worst of human nature a monopoly

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:40.440
 on violence in the institution of governments.

1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:42.800
 That little inkling of coercion,

1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:47.000
 that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic,

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.840
 like ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.840
 Yes, and it ends up just being the place where,

1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:55.080
 you know, corporations, individuals, free markets,

1:19:55.080 --> 1:19:57.760
 they can't coerce without the resort to government.

1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.400
 So, you know, you think about all the examples

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:02.680
 of corrupt corporations doing bad things,

1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:06.360
 it's always because they have certain privileges

1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:09.760
 from governments because, you know, as it exists,

1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:11.400
 you know, Coca Cola, McDonald's,

1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:13.040
 all of these giant corporations,

1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:15.800
 they can't do anything to me without government.

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:17.080
 They can't take any of my money

1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:19.240
 and they can't force me to buy their stuff.

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:21.400
 And so doesn't matter to me, you know,

1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:24.000
 so if Coca Cola is corrupted,

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:25.800
 that's a problem for Coca Cola customers,

1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:27.960
 that's a problem for Coca Cola shareholders,

1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:30.920
 that's a problem for anybody who deals with Coca Cola,

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:32.480
 but as somebody who doesn't drink their stuff

1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:34.360
 and isn't a shareholder,

1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:36.560
 I have absolutely no interest in what happens.

1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:39.000
 They could all go bust tomorrow and I don't care.

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.200
 I don't buy their product and I'm not a shareholder.

1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:46.400
 So in this situation where you choose to voluntarily

1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:50.120
 associate with people and you only give your money

1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:52.440
 to people you want to voluntarily give the money to,

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:54.280
 so you either buy their product

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:57.400
 or invest in their production, in that situation,

1:20:57.400 --> 1:20:59.760
 the only way that a company can get my money

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:03.120
 is if they build the product that I value

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:07.280
 or if they convince me that they are going to use it

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:08.640
 in a way that's profitable.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.800
 And I may be wrong, you know,

1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:12.720
 I may invest in a company that fails

1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:17.320
 or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent,

1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:20.240
 but that's my fault, you know?

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:24.760
 And it's my fault that I gave them my money

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:26.880
 and then it turned out to be scoundrels,

1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:28.960
 but it's a totally different problem

1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:32.240
 when we make it mandatory, you know?

1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:36.120
 It's violence, it's a crime to put a gun to my head

1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:38.520
 and force me to subsidize companies

1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:41.280
 and force me to come at certain conclusions.

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:43.160
 Do you find an interesting distinction,

1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:46.760
 Mr. Michael Malis, between anarchism and libertarianism?

1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:51.760
 So this particular use of violence, this like last resort,

1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:56.240
 this policing force that libertarianism is okay with

1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:58.720
 and anarchism is not okay with.

1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:02.440
 So basically nation states that keep you safe

1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:05.320
 from the worst of war.

1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:06.560
 Yeah, I think to be more accurate,

1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:09.040
 the distinction between anarchism and monarchism,

1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:11.640
 I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:13.360
 that can encompass both.

1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:14.440
 It means a lot of things, okay.

1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:19.440
 Yeah, but on the Karl Marx to Michael Malis spectrum,

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:20.720
 where do you?

1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:22.160
 No, no, I'm full anarchist.

1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:23.000
 You're full anarchist.

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:23.840
 Yeah, full anarchist.

1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:26.320
 I mean, I don't find any justification

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:27.720
 for the use of force.

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:32.720
 And I think recently, perhaps, maybe I'm getting old,

1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:35.120
 maybe I'm getting senile, maybe I'm getting wise.

1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:36.080
 Who knows?

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.640
 But I'm beginning to become more sympathetic to monarchy.

1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:43.200
 So I'm an anarchist, monarchy.

1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:44.440
 Which, what is that?

1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:45.280
 Kings.

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:46.120
 Oh, monarchy.

1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:46.960
 Yeah.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:49.040
 And I think.

1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:51.880
 Wait, are you joking or not?

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:53.160
 No, I'm not joking.

1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:57.040
 And I think, I mean, I think, you know,

1:22:57.040 --> 1:22:59.320
 morally and intellectually, I'm an anarchist,

1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:02.400
 but it's what the reality is we find ourselves

1:23:02.400 --> 1:23:05.560
 in a world in which a lot of people are not.

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:09.760
 And the question is, what is the thing that is going

1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:12.760
 to provide you with more freedom?

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:16.720
 And I think I'm recently coming around to the idea

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:19.440
 that monarchy might be the best way

1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:22.080
 to provide people with the largest amount of freedom

1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:25.960
 because to have a free society, you need a majority,

1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:28.080
 perhaps, or a plurality of people

1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:31.880
 to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas,

1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.120
 to have a low time preference,

1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:35.720
 to have a preference for the future.

1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:37.480
 So you need a majority of the population

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.320
 to not decide to go and do something insane

1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:44.400
 in order to continue to have a free society.

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:48.040
 You know, when a respiratory illness comes along,

1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:51.120
 unfortunately, you know, the last couple of years

1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:53.600
 showed that we, the vast majority of people

1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:57.320
 are gonna freak out and lose their mind

1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:00.480
 and support whatever their stupid TV tells them to support.

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:03.600
 And, you know, there's always a current thing

1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:05.840
 and the media is always telling you

1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:08.320
 that we need this current thing as an excuse

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:10.280
 for more and more government power

1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:11.680
 and more and more government coercion.

1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:13.120
 What's the role of kings and queens

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:15.200
 in that case of a monarchy?

1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:17.800
 What's the role of a leader?

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:21.720
 I think there might be a case that...

1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:23.600
 So as I was saying, you need the majority

1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:26.280
 of the population to get together and decide,

1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:28.760
 nope, whatever is the case, you know,

1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:30.520
 the answer is voluntary.

1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:34.120
 No matter how bad the disease is,

1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:36.320
 it doesn't justify forcing people to stay home.

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:37.520
 You wanna stay home, stay home.

1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:39.640
 You wanna wear a mask, take a vaccine,

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:42.480
 do whatever you want, but you can't force others to do that.

1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:43.920
 So you need a majority of the people

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:46.440
 to strongly believe in this principle

1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:50.400
 in order to get it in a democracy.

1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:54.440
 Whereas in a monarchy, you just need the king to get it.

1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:57.400
 And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it

1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:00.000
 is that kings have a low time preference

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.520
 where they think about things for many generations.

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:05.440
 Whereas in a democratic system,

1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:08.240
 your president is likely only going to be there

1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:10.640
 for four years or eight years or 10 years

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:12.600
 or five years or whatever it is.

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:14.560
 So the only way that, you know,

1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:15.880
 all humans are self interested.

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:17.920
 So the only way that your president in a democracy

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:21.640
 can provide for themselves is to maximize the amount

1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:24.120
 of exploitation that they can do of the population

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:26.400
 during their brief stint.

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:28.680
 And then when he's out, you get a new one

1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:30.520
 and then that one wants to start all over again.

1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:33.040
 So every four years, you get a new robber.

1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:37.280
 With monarchy, you sign up for a multi generation

1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:41.360
 subscription to the same family.

1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:44.560
 And when they have the security of knowing that, you know,

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:48.560
 his great grandson is going to be taking money

1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:52.720
 from your great grandson, suddenly his interest

1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:56.400
 in yours align because they both want your great grandson

1:25:56.400 --> 1:25:58.480
 to be prosperous and have enough money

1:25:58.480 --> 1:25:59.880
 for his great grandson to take.

1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:02.320
 So it's a monarchy with a tiny government.

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.320
 So anything required to really provide for free market.

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.040
 So for maximize individual freedom

1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:12.480
 and the freedom of the economy.

1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:15.480
 Yeah, and if I were a king, which is highly unlikely

1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:17.120
 to ever happen, but I think, you know,

1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:21.160
 if you look historically, the dynasties that have succeeded

1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:24.600
 at lasting for a long time, the key thing that they managed

1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:26.960
 to do is to basically be libertarian.

1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:29.840
 The key to being a good king is to just leave people alone,

1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:31.200
 let them do whatever they want.

1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:34.240
 Don't rob them too much or rob them as little as possible

1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:36.120
 or maybe even don't rob them.

1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:40.560
 And, you know, as a king, use your power only

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:43.160
 to punish people who aggress against others.

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:44.880
 Don't use your power to enrich yourself

1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:46.280
 and enrich your friends.

1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:49.720
 And that's really like, if you look at smart kings,

1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:50.560
 this is what they do.

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:51.720
 This is what they teach their children.

1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:54.160
 And the cycle of kingdoms is that, you know,

1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:57.520
 the first king understands this, builds the empire

1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:00.800
 and the first couple of generations, they get this

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:04.680
 and the society is free, the economy is free.

1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.360
 And because of that, you know, there's peace

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:11.560
 and prosperity, but then over time, the next generation

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:14.760
 of kids become a lot more high time preference.

1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:17.280
 They haven't worked hard.

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:20.000
 They don't understand the meaning of hard work.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.720
 So they become more likely to engage

1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:24.920
 in destructive behavior.

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:30.000
 So raise taxes, pass laws that require people

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.840
 to do things even when they're not hurting anybody.

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:35.720
 And that ends up basically eventually

1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:36.840
 destroying the kingdom.

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:40.200
 Of course, power corrupts.

1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:42.760
 So you have to kind of create human institutions

1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:45.920
 that prevent you as a king or any kind of leader

1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:48.320
 from expand.

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:52.160
 So going back on the original promises

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.280
 and the purposes of your position and then distracting,

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:58.760
 using tools of technology and communication

1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:01.280
 to distract the populace while you expend the power.

1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:02.120
 Exactly.

1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:03.360
 All right.

1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:05.760
 You wrote the fiat standard.

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:08.560
 I think we danced around it quite a bit,

1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.160
 but I don't know if we actually defined it.

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.840
 So what is fiat money?

1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:14.640
 What is the history of how it came to be?

1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:16.080
 The fascinating history of the birth

1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:18.440
 of the fiat monetary system is something

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:21.680
 that really only got uncovered in 2017.

1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:25.080
 This is extremely, extremely interesting.

1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:29.640
 In 1914, Britain joined World War I.

1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:31.720
 And if you remember your history books,

1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:35.320
 it's famous that this was called the August Bank holiday.

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:36.760
 It was just going to be a few weeks

1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:38.280
 where the British troops were gonna go

1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:41.720
 and kick European ass and come back triumphant.

1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:44.040
 And most European countries believed that.

1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:46.360
 But then the war kept on dragging on.

1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:48.960
 And of course, to finance the war, the government,

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:50.760
 this is what they used to do under the gold standard,

1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:52.960
 governments would issue bonds.

1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:54.320
 So you'd issue the bonds.

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:55.640
 People would buy the bonds.

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:57.920
 The money would be used to finance the military.

1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:00.680
 And then the government would pay off the bond

1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:03.000
 over the next five or 10 or 20 years.

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.200
 So for World War I, the British government,

1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:10.200
 the British treasury issued bonds for financing the war.

1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:13.400
 And this only came to light in 2017.

1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:15.840
 Only a third of the bonds were actually subscribed.

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:18.520
 So people, British people, and this is perhaps

1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:20.280
 the greatest thing that they've ever done,

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:22.200
 they decided fighting a war in Europe

1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:25.280
 is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:27.280
 It's a stupid thing, why should I go and fight?

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:28.760
 Because the Austrians and the Germans

1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:33.760
 and the Serbians are at each other's throats.

1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:36.160
 I'd rather invest in something else.

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:38.920
 So they only bought a third of the bond issue.

1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:42.120
 And then the astonishing thing that happened,

1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:44.160
 which really set the tone for the next century

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:49.080
 of war, murder, Keynesianism and theft and inflation,

1:29:49.080 --> 1:29:53.120
 was that the Bank of England went and got two

1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:56.640
 of the high ranking officials in the Bank of England

1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:59.440
 to buy the other remaining outstanding two third

1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:01.520
 of the bonds under their own name

1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:03.160
 with a line of credit from the Bank of England.

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:04.680
 So it wasn't their own money,

1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:06.640
 but they took money essentially from the Bank of England,

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:10.400
 bought two thirds of the bonds that financed the war.

1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:14.840
 And that was how England was able to keep going into the war.

1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:17.080
 So that's essentially what they did

1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:19.960
 is what we today know as quantitative easing.

1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.880
 And back then, they just got,

1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:24.520
 they printed money from the Bank of England

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:29.000
 or credit, printed credit, gave it to those two employees.

1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.360
 They bought the bonds, the government could fight the war.

1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:34.520
 Sounds like it's a nice idea.

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:38.160
 And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself,

1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:41.360
 he himself said this was,

1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:42.880
 he wrote a letter to the Bank of England

1:30:42.880 --> 1:30:44.720
 that was uncovered recently and he said,

1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:48.000
 I congratulate you on this masterly manipulation.

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.360
 I quote it in the book,

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:51.640
 masterly manipulation is what he called it,

1:30:51.640 --> 1:30:54.680
 that they basically managed to buy the bonds

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:56.400
 using the money of the government.

1:30:56.400 --> 1:31:00.000
 And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.760
 because he never could ask the question of, okay, and then what?

1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:04.360
 All right, so we just printed money

1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:07.320
 to buy two thirds of these government bonds.

1:31:07.320 --> 1:31:09.000
 What's gonna happen next?

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:10.360
 What could go wrong?

1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:12.840
 Not a question Keynes is gonna ask themselves

1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:16.760
 because their jobs depend on not thinking

1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:18.280
 about what's going to go wrong.

1:31:18.280 --> 1:31:20.680
 So just a quick question about war

1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:24.240
 and somebody's been nonstop reading and thinking

1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:26.680
 about the wars of the 20th century

1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:31.680
 and thinking that most of those wars

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:34.520
 were unjust, unethical and destructive.

1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:40.160
 How else do you find, how would you finance a war?

1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:41.960
 So ideally you don't.

1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:43.560
 No, but I mean, of course there are sometimes,

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:45.160
 you know, you wanna fight for self defense.

1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:48.560
 Yeah, you finance it, taxation or bonds.

1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:51.160
 So the people really need to want to war

1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:55.280
 not just with their voices, their thoughts, their tweets,

1:31:55.280 --> 1:31:56.800
 with their actual financial investment.

1:31:56.800 --> 1:31:59.280
 Put up the bullets and the cost of the bullets

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:00.440
 and the bodies.

1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:03.640
 So their life and their financial well being.

1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:07.440
 That's how it was under the gold standard mostly

1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:09.240
 because under the gold standard,

1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:10.640
 the government couldn't print gold.

1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:12.760
 And so they had a budget and they had a certain amount

1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:15.000
 of gold and that wasn't just, you know,

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:16.720
 that they couldn't infinitely increase it.

1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:20.160
 So they couldn't tax their population at will

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:22.840
 and it's very difficult to take money from people,

1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:25.640
 you know, go knock on doors and search everybody's homes,

1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:28.560
 see where they're hiding their gold is very complicated.

1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:30.200
 On the other hand, when you gave them paper money,

1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:33.200
 which is what the case was in 1914,

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:36.200
 you could take their wealth just by printing the money.

1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:37.840
 And that's what changed everything

1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:38.760
 when it comes to war.

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:40.560
 That's why the 20th century was the century

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:43.200
 of total war because under the gold standard,

1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:46.400
 governments fought until they ran out of their own gold.

1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:49.800
 Under the fiat standard with paper money, with credit money,

1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:53.480
 governments fought until they ran out of liquid wealth

1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:55.840
 in the hands of all of their citizens.

1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:00.840
 So let's find flaws in this thinking if there's any.

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:06.440
 Okay, there's a lot of pacifist type of thinking

1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:09.400
 in World War II as Hitler was expanding,

1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:12.320
 expanding Hitler friend himself as a victim

1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:14.640
 of the past of history.

1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:16.560
 He never attacked anybody.

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:18.960
 Yeah, everyone's always threatening to attack him.

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:21.600
 That's kind of the narrative and he keeps expanding.

1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:23.680
 He keeps sweet talking with his charisma,

1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:28.120
 all the countries around him into sort of embracing

1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:30.440
 pacifism, stay out of the war until the war's

1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:31.840
 on your doorstep.

1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:36.840
 So France, just very suboptimal military strategy

1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:39.960
 from the perspective of many European nations

1:33:39.960 --> 1:33:41.880
 in response to Hitler.

1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:45.640
 They were basically hoodwinked by his words.

1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.240
 So then there's Churchill, Winston Churchill,

1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:55.240
 who stepped up and says, perhaps irrationally,

1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:57.880
 from some kind of economics perspective,

1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:59.920
 saying we're not going to back down.

1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:01.560
 We're going to fight Germany.

1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:05.240
 And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons

1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:09.160
 that Hitler failed in his expansion.

1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:13.600
 That decision to fight back,

1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:18.800
 how, what's the right way to do that?

1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:23.320
 If you're Winston Churchill, what's the right way to do that?

1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:28.320
 If you're, to fight back evil when violence is required.

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:33.320
 Now, you could argue that no war is just,

1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:36.880
 but there are such a thing as a just war index.

1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:40.080
 And a lot of people argue, if there is a just war

1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:43.040
 in the 20th century, it's World War II.

1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:47.680
 So how would you fund if you were Britain, the war?

1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:52.680
 Would you require Winston Churchill to convince the populace?

1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:55.480
 Like don't fight until they're fully convinced

1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:57.320
 that this is the right thing to do.

1:34:57.320 --> 1:34:59.520
 You can't just make a decision for them.

1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:02.800
 You have to convince them fully so that they give their life

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.000
 and that give their money to support the war.

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:07.120
 Is that the right way to do it?

1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:07.960
 I think so.

1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:11.440
 And I think when you have a true threat

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:15.440
 and a true evil and a true force that people really do think

1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:17.720
 is genuine, you don't need to convince them.

1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:21.240
 I mean, when it's real, people will want to fight

1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:22.960
 and people will want to pay to fight.

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:26.120
 And I mean, I think though,

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:28.160
 on this particular example, I think, you know,

1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:29.520
 that the best way to fight Hitler

1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:31.800
 is to have not fought World War I,

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:34.760
 not take out the Kaiser of Germany.

1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:37.960
 If Britain hadn't, and Britain in the US

1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:39.960
 had not gotten involved in World War I,

1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:43.960
 which really is the senseless war about nothing.

1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:45.360
 Like what was in it?

1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.360
 And what was the goal from anybody fighting that war?

1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:51.120
 If you look at it, after World War I,

1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:54.920
 there were very minor adjustments in the borders

1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:56.920
 of the countries that were participating.

1:35:56.920 --> 1:35:59.920
 So Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land,

1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:03.600
 but really it wasn't all that massive.

1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:04.920
 And it wasn't like, you know,

1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:08.520
 it wasn't like Britain wanted to take over Germany

1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:09.920
 and move their people into Germany

1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:11.320
 and kick the Germans out.

1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:16.320
 So there was no real value from that war.

1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:19.320
 And that's why the British people didn't want to take part in it.

1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:22.360
 And that's why if they hadn't done this

1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:26.360
 enormously criminal manipulation of printing money

1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:30.360
 to buy the ponds, Britain wouldn't have gotten into the war.

1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:32.360
 Germany would still be a kingdom,

1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.360
 and Hitler wouldn't rise.

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:37.360
 And yeah, there'd be small changes in the borders

1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:40.360
 of various European countries.

1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:44.360
 I struggled to see how it could have been worse.

1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.360
 I mean, I struggled to see who benefited

1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:50.360
 from four years of carnage in Europe.

1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:53.360
 And then this came at the height of civilization.

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:55.360
 You know, before that, the people of Europe

1:36:55.360 --> 1:36:59.360
 had the golden era,

1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:01.360
 the gold standard they were trading with one another.

1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:04.360
 They traveled and technology was advancing.

1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:08.360
 And they did not expect this war to last this long.

1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:11.360
 And, you know, my favorite story from World War I

1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:14.360
 is the Christmas truce football game,

1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:16.360
 which I mentioned in my book,

1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:19.360
 British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict,

1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:21.360
 they stopped on Christmas Day,

1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.360
 and they played a football game against each other.

1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:25.360
 I mean, this is not a real war,

1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:28.360
 where it's a war for survival.

1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:30.360
 Britain didn't want to end Germany.

1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:32.360
 Germany didn't want to end Britain.

1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:35.360
 It was just kings who were emboldened

1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:38.360
 by the fact that they had a printing press

1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:40.360
 playing with the lives of the people.

1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:44.360
 And take that away, take away the printing press,

1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:46.360
 take away their ability to print money.

1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:50.360
 I think we'd have had a much, much, much better 20th century.

1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:53.360
 Yeah, the counterfactual history in Neil Ferguson

1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:56.360
 is a historian who gets quite a bit of a trouble.

1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:00.360
 Basically, well, he's a Brit,

1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:03.360
 suggesting that if Britain stayed out of World War I,

1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:06.360
 there would be no Hitler, there would be no World War II.

1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:08.360
 Yep, I agree entirely.

1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.360
 But fiat money.

1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:13.360
 Yeah, so how fiat money was born, yeah, let's get back to that.

1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:15.360
 So they financed the war with that money.

1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:17.360
 So what could go wrong?

1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:19.360
 That's where we left off.

1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:21.360
 Well, what could go wrong when you've just printed

1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:26.360
 an enormous amount of credit and used it to buy bonds?

1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:28.360
 What goes wrong is that the value of the currency

1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:30.360
 is going to go down, or in other words,

1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:32.360
 prices of things are going to go up.

1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:34.360
 So during the war, prices keep going up,

1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:37.360
 and this is, of course,

1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:39.360
 this is going to sound very familiar to victims

1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:41.360
 of the 20th century.

1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:43.360
 A government tells you it's because of the war,

1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:45.360
 it's not our fault, it's because of the Germans,

1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:47.360
 it's because of the foreigners, it's because of Putin,

1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:49.360
 it's because of this, it's because of that.

1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:51.360
 This has always been the case.

1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:55.360
 War is a very good cover for inflation,

1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:57.360
 which is caused by monetary phenomena.

1:38:57.360 --> 1:38:59.360
 So then the war ends,

1:38:59.360 --> 1:39:02.360
 and inflation, prices have more than doubled

1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:04.360
 over the past four years,

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:07.360
 over the four years of World War I,

1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:09.360
 prices have more than doubled.

1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:12.360
 And then the British economy is in bad trouble,

1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:15.360
 obviously, you know, lost a lot of the labor force

1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:18.360
 for four years that was out there fighting.

1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:20.360
 Now those workers come back.

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:25.360
 Prices are up, and so people are demanding

1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:27.360
 that the government control prices,

1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:29.360
 and the government is trying to fix the problem

1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:31.360
 of inflation by doing price controls,

1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:34.360
 which is what they always do, which is catastrophic,

1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.360
 because it makes things worse.

1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.360
 When you implement price controls,

1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:40.360
 when you say, alright, well,

1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:44.360
 bread can't be sold for more than X price,

1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:47.360
 well, that's just preventing bread producers

1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:49.360
 from producing a lot of bread,

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:51.360
 and that's just making the problem worse.

1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:54.360
 If you let the price rise, the extra price,

1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:56.360
 first of all, it makes people economize,

1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:58.360
 so people will only buy what they need,

1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:00.360
 and it provides the money for the bread producers

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:02.360
 to acquire the capital and the resources

1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:04.360
 they need to produce more bread,

1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:06.360
 which then brings the price of bread down,

1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:08.360
 but price controls destroy that.

1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:10.360
 Then they also implement wage controls,

1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:14.360
 so you want to also make sure that people have high wages.

1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:16.360
 So you raise people's wages artificially,

1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.360
 you lower prices artificially,

1:40:18.360 --> 1:40:20.360
 and you cause an economic problem.

1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.360
 And this is basically, I use this historical example

1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.360
 because it's the birth of Fiat,

1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:28.360
 because the Bank of England was the most important

1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:30.360
 monetary system in the world at that time,

1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:32.360
 and because it's the prototype

1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.360
 that basically the entire planet

1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.360
 copied over the last 100 years.

1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:38.360
 We've had this same thing happen.

1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:40.360
 The government prints money because of a stupid reason,

1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.360
 because somebody in power decided

1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:44.360
 this was worth destroying everybody's livelihood

1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:46.360
 and savings for,

1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:48.360
 and then the consequences come in,

1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.360
 and then they start covering up with price controls,

1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:52.360
 wage controls, and then that makes things worse.

1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:54.360
 And then they,

1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:56.360
 and of course, throughout all of that,

1:40:56.360 --> 1:40:58.360
 they're promising that we're going to go,

1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:00.360
 oh, and also the other thing that they did,

1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:02.360
 which I mentioned in the chapter is,

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.360
 they stopped people from using physical gold,

1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.360
 and they confiscated the,

1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.360
 well, they didn't confiscate it,

1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:10.360
 but they took the physical gold and they gave people paper.

1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.360
 So I call it the Fiat white paper.

1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:14.360
 You know, in Bitcoin, we have the white paper.

1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.360
 The Fiat white paper was that

1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:18.360
 the Bank of England announced

1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360
 to all of its banks and post offices,

1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:22.360
 and from now on, you should not make payment in gold,

1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.360
 and you should take payment in gold,

1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:26.360
 and you should encourage all your customers

1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:28.360
 to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead.

1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:30.360
 Is there an actual document?

1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:32.360
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice.

1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:34.360
 This is all new stuff.

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.360
 Obviously, nobody really likes to talk about this stuff

1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:38.360
 because, you know, they're Fiat economists,

1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:40.360
 so they don't want to talk about the original sin.

1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:42.360
 Well, you should like republish it

1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:44.360
 as the Fiat white paper or something like that.

1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.360
 There's a fascinating book

1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.360
 by a guy called John Osborne.

1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360
 So in the 1920s,

1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.360
 I think his name was Montagu.

1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:54.360
 He was the chief of the Bank of England.

1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.360
 He commissioned one of his secretaries,

1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.360
 John Osborne,

1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.360
 to study what the bank did

1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:02.360
 during World War I,

1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:04.360
 and it was a study that was kept under wraps,

1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:06.360
 confidential,

1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:08.360
 in the Bank of England,

1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:10.360
 only released in 2017,

1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.360
 almost a century later.

1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:14.360
 What was special about 2017,

1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:16.360
 by the way, was a year.

1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:18.360
 It was a year on which

1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:20.360
 some of this information was released.

1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:22.360
 Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements

1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:24.360
 of the Bank of England and found this and published it,

1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:26.360
 and now you can download it as a PDF

1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:28.360
 and find all of the amazing details.

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.360
 So they confiscated the gold,

1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:32.360
 and they forced people to use the paper,

1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.360
 and they promised people that as soon as the war

1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:36.360
 is going to be over, this is temporary,

1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.360
 we're going to be back to using gold.

1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.360
 And of course, you know,

1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:42.360
 if you told people in Britain,

1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:44.360
 this is the real scam about Fiat,

1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.360
 if you told people in Britain in 1914,

1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.360
 hey, we're going to go off the gold standard

1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:50.360
 because it's better.

1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:52.360
 I mean, there might have been lynchings

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.360
 of government officials

1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:56.360
 because the British pound

1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:58.360
 at that point had been

1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.360
 the global currency

1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:02.360
 of the whole world,

1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:04.360
 and the fact that they'd managed

1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:06.360
 the Bank of England had kept the British pound

1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:08.360
 at a fixed rate next to gold

1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:10.360
 for, since Newton,

1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:12.360
 you know, the exchange rate,

1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:14.360
 the value of the British pound

1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:16.360
 was set by Isaac Newton himself.

1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:18.360
 He was the warden of the Mint,

1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:20.360
 and he made the pound

1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:22.360
 a specific amount of gold,

1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:24.360
 and since then, up until World War I,

1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:26.360
 it was

1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:28.360
 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold,

1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.360
 I think I might be wrong,

1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:32.360
 but I have it in the book.

1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:34.360
 So he'd set that price, and it was a matter of national pride

1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:36.360
 for people in England, you know.

1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:38.360
 The sterling is as good as gold

1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.360
 because for two centuries it had been stuck to gold.

1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:42.360
 There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars,

1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.360
 but for two centuries mostly it was stuck to that.

1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:46.360
 And so they went off that,

1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.360
 and then they couldn't go back

1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.360
 because they wanted to go back,

1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:52.360
 they didn't have enough gold,

1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:54.360
 they didn't have access to finance the war,

1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.360
 and they had printed a whole bunch of money

1:43:56.360 --> 1:43:58.360
 that was out there.

1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:00.360
 So this begins the problem

1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:02.360
 for England, and that begins the end

1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:04.360
 of England as the world's superpower.

1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:06.360
 And the way they tried to fight that

1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:08.360
 was to get more and more countries around the world

1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:10.360
 to establish central banks,

1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.360
 and have unhauled British pounds.

1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:14.360
 So if they'd hold, you know,

1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:16.360
 basically dumping their bags,

1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:18.360
 like just any other shit coin,

1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:20.360
 if you get people to buy your shit coin,

1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:22.360
 that raises the value of your shit coin.

1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:24.360
 Can you define shit coin?

1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:26.360
 Shit coin is, in my definition

1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:28.360
 of a shit coin is that it's any form of money

1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:30.360
 where somebody can produce it.

1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:32.360
 So soft money?

1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:34.360
 Not necessarily, I guess.

1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:36.360
 I think the difference,

1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:38.360
 so there's easy money,

1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:40.360
 but the shit coin

1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.360
 is something that someone can produce

1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:44.360
 at a rate that is different,

1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:46.360
 at a cost that is different from the market cost.

1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:48.360
 So gold, nobody can make gold

1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:50.360
 except that they dig for it,

1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:52.360
 and the cost of mining gold

1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:54.360
 is generally in the range of the price of gold.

1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:56.360
 Seems true for bitcoin.

1:44:56.360 --> 1:44:58.360
 So gold is not a shit coin?

1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:00.360
 Gold is not a shit coin.

1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:02.360
 The copper is.

1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:04.360
 I'm not so sure.

1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:06.360
 I wouldn't call copper a shit coin

1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:08.360
 as much as it is easy money,

1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:10.360
 but I think government currencies

1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:12.360
 and other alt coins, I think are shit coins,

1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:14.360
 because somebody could click a button

1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:16.360
 and make 10 times the supply.

1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:18.360
 I think that this began

1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:20.360
 with the

1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:22.360
 will for war in World War I.

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.360
 So the march towards fiat

1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:30.360
 began

1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:32.360
 with a global desire

1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:34.360
 for war

1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.360
 in the 20th century.

1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:38.360
 Did war start this, or was war a result?

1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:40.360
 It's difficult to say really.

1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:42.360
 I think it goes both ways.

1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:44.360
 I think

1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:46.360
 you can't have permanent war

1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.360
 without fiat,

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:50.360
 and I also think

1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:52.360
 there's a case to be made that you can't really have

1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:54.360
 fiat without war.

1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:56.360
 So it's some kind of weird

1:45:56.360 --> 1:45:58.360
 dynamical system with a chicken and egg

1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:00.360
 situation, and they build it on top of each other,

1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.360
 and there's a few individuals that

1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:04.360
 figured out there's a way to manipulate this

1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:06.360
 to play this kind of game, and it escalates,

1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:08.360
 and nothing gives you the

1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:10.360
 ability to manipulate money

1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:12.360
 quite like war.

1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:14.360
 When you have a war,

1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:16.360
 you can declare an emergency,

1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:18.360
 you can call all the people who oppose you

1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.360
 traitors,

1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:22.360
 you can

1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:24.360
 get people to support you not because

1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:26.360
 what you're doing is good, but because

1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:28.360
 you play on their sense of tribalism.

1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:30.360
 In your book, you do cost benefit analysis.

1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:32.360
 So you do acknowledge

1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:34.360
 or think about the pros

1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:36.360
 of fiat currency.

1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:38.360
 Can you

1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:40.360
 do just that?

1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:42.360
 What do you do with it and look at the cost

1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.360
 just broadly at the highest level?

1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:46.360
 So the way that I write the fiat standard

1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:48.360
 is that I try and

1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:50.360
 analyze it as an engineering system in the same

1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:52.360
 way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard.

1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:54.360
 So with the Bitcoin standard, I looked at Bitcoin

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:56.360
 from first principles and tried to explain

1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:58.360
 how it works for a reader that doesn't

1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:00.360
 really have much of a background in

1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:02.360
 computer science, networks,

1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:04.360
 or economics.

1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.360
 And I thought I'll do the same with the fiat.

1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:08.360
 Let's just ignore the official stories

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:10.360
 and see if anything actually works.

1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:12.360
 And

1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:14.360
 I think it does have value

1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:16.360
 in the fact that it,

1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:18.360
 you know, the reason that it was,

1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:20.360
 that they were able to pull it off

1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.360
 is because it was not possible

1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:24.360
 for people who don't

1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.360
 want to be part of it

1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:28.360
 to use gold independently of governments.

1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:30.360
 This is really the key thing.

1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:32.360
 Gold is just very expensive to move around

1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:34.360
 and

1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:36.360
 the fact that it is expensive to move around

1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:38.360
 is that

1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:40.360
 there's

1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:42.360
 inevitably going to emerge institutions

1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:44.360
 where it is centralized in physical

1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:46.360
 location. And then

1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:48.360
 these institutions trade liabilities

1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:50.360
 for the gold. So really

1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:52.360
 the gold standard

1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:54.360
 intrinsically

1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:56.360
 must involve

1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:58.360
 credit as becoming part of the monetary

1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:00.360
 system. It has to be the credit

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:02.360
 and because it gets centralized can easily

1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.360
 be captured by the government.

1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:06.360
 To be fair

1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:08.360
 the benefit of the fiat system is that it

1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:10.360
 saves us on the cost of moving gold around

1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.360
 which is pretty significant.

1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:14.360
 Generally, you know, moving a bar of gold

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:16.360
 across the Atlantic is going to cost

1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:18.360
 somewhere between 0.1 to 1%

1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:20.360
 of the cost of the gold bar.

1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:22.360
 So you move it 100 times

1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:24.360
 back and forth between the Atlantic,

1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:26.360
 you need to pay the whole gold bar.

1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.360
 The cost of the whole gold bar to move it 100 times

1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:30.360
 across. Well, with fiat money

1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:32.360
 with essentially government credit

1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:34.360
 it's just sending a message

1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:36.360
 from one's central bank to another

1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:38.360
 and you can move it halfway around

1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:40.360
 the world. Is there also something to be said

1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:42.360
 about the cost in time?

1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:44.360
 So you're saving the sort of, you're reducing the friction

1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:46.360
 with the communication as well

1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:48.360
 of the transactions as well.

1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:50.360
 Exactly, it's faster.

1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:52.360
 How big is that benefit?

1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:54.360
 Because wouldn't you argue that that

1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:56.360
 potential is the thing that enables modern

1:48:56.360 --> 1:48:58.360
 economy both the speed

1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:00.360
 and the low cost. So increasing the scale

1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:02.360
 and the frequency

1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.360
 of the speed of the transactions.

1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:06.360
 Yeah, arguably it does help

1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:08.360
 in that regard. However

1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:10.360
 it isn't as if you couldn't have

1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:12.360
 fast transactions built on top of

1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:14.360
 gold. So you could have gold being used

1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:16.360
 for final settlement and you could

1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:18.360
 have bank

1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:20.360
 settling with one another essentially

1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:22.360
 using credit settlement. Can you define settlement

1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:24.360
 just for people

1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:26.360
 who are outside of this world? Because we'll mention

1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:28.360
 that word quite a bit probably. Good question.

1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:30.360
 So the way that it works is, let's say

1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.360
 right now I'm going to pay you

1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:34.360
 $10 over

1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.360
 PayPal or credit card.

1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360
 So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card

1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:40.360
 within a few seconds that I've

1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360
 sent you the money and then that's yours.

1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:44.360
 But

1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:46.360
 it didn't also happen

1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:48.360
 in those 10 seconds that my bank

1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:50.360
 which could be in another country

1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.360
 sent the money to your bank

1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.360
 into your account.

1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:56.360
 There's a lot of infrastructure

1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:58.360
 making that. So what actually happened

1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:00.360
 is that I have an account with my bank

1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:02.360
 and you have an account with your bank

1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:04.360
 and when the message is communicated from

1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:06.360
 my app to yours,

1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:08.360
 my bank crosses out the money and

1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:10.360
 your bank credits you with the money

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:12.360
 and then at the end of the day,

1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:14.360
 week or month

1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:16.360
 banks in the same city will settle with

1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:18.360
 one another, banks in the same country

1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:20.360
 will settle with one another and banks

1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:22.360
 from different countries

1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:24.360
 will settle with one another. So they won't

1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.360
 move the $10 from my account to yours

1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:28.360
 at the end of the day or week

1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:30.360
 or month. They'll

1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:32.360
 tally all of the money that was sent from

1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:34.360
 one bank to the other and then just

1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:36.360
 settle the difference. So it turns out

1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:38.360
 at the end of the month my bank had sent

1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:40.360
 $15 million to your bank

1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:42.360
 and your bank had sent $14 million to

1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.360
 my bank. So they

1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:46.360
 give them $1 million and that settles it.

1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:48.360
 That finalizes the transaction.

1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:50.360
 So final settlement

1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:52.360
 3D is like the, you can think about it

1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.360
 as the infrastructure of the system

1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.360
 and then you can think of these

1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.360
 things as being the higher

1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:00.360
 layer levels and you had a wonderful

1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:02.360
 discussion about that with Michael

1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:04.360
 Saylor. So the final settlement is

1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:06.360
 the moment when

1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:08.360
 you paper and ideas

1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:10.360
 connect to physical reality

1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:12.360
 or to some

1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:14.360
 representation of physical reality. Yeah and

1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:16.360
 under gold, everything was

1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:18.360
 tethered to physical reality because there was

1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:20.360
 a market commodity at the bottom of all of this

1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.360
 and nobody could print that market commodity

1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:24.360
 and so at the end of the month, if your

1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:26.360
 bank made too many payments, if

1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:28.360
 you made too many payments, there was

1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:30.360
 a reckoning. There were, you know, if you were

1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:32.360
 reckless, if you were insolvent

1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:34.360
 you went out of business.

1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:36.360
 So there was no

1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:38.360
 there was no way to fool that. But then

1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:40.360
 we moved to the fiat century and

1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:42.360
 everything is credit. At the end of

1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:44.360
 the day, the final layer

1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:46.360
 is government credit and so

1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:48.360
 as long as your friends with the government

1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:50.360
 basically you never go bankrupt.

1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:52.360
 So all kinds of

1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:54.360
 hucksters managed to find their way into

1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:56.360
 you know getting into

1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:58.360
 position where they don't get bankrupt.

1:51:58.360 --> 1:52:00.360
 So in part two of the fiat standard

1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:02.360
 called fiat life

1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:04.360
 you describe the effects of fiat money

1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:06.360
 and a bunch of things like life

1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:08.360
 food, science, education

1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:12.360
 what is the most pernicious effect

1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:14.360
 of fiat money on our world

1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:16.360
 on our life. So taking a

1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:18.360
 step outside of the monetary system

1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.360
 actually like how that affects our life

1:52:20.360 --> 1:52:22.360
 from this book. There's

1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:24.360
 a whole bunch of things and I won't

1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:26.360
 be able to go over them and I highly recommend reading

1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:28.360
 the book. But if I were to pick one

1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:30.360
 I would say it's the impact that it has on our time

1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:32.360
 preference on our

1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:34.360
 valuation of the future. So

1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:36.360
 remember when we started the discussion I said

1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:38.360
 the key function

1:52:38.360 --> 1:52:40.360
 of money is that it serves as a store

1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:42.360
 of value and the harder the money is

1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:44.360
 the better it is at

1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:46.360
 providing us with a way for

1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:48.360
 providing for our future.

1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:50.360
 And so the harder the money is the less

1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:52.360
 we discount the future. We always discount the future

1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:54.360
 compared to the present. So if I told you

1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:56.360
 I'm going to give you something today

1:52:56.360 --> 1:52:58.360
 versus giving it to you 10 years from now

1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:00.360
 the same thing you would prefer to take

1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:02.360
 it now because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next

1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.360
 10 years. So we always prefer

1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.360
 the present to the future

1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:08.360
 there's always a discount on the future

1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:10.360
 and that discount is called time preference

1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:12.360
 the degree to which we prefer

1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:14.360
 the present to the future is called our time preference.

1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:16.360
 So the higher

1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:18.360
 our time preference

1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:20.360
 the less we care about the future

1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:22.360
 and the process of civilization is the process

1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:24.360
 of lowering our time preference

1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:26.360
 where we start caring more for the future

1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:28.360
 we start prioritizing

1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:30.360
 the present less and less so we start

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:32.360
 being able to not consume

1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:34.360
 everything that we have and store it

1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:36.360
 and so money is essential for that

1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:38.360
 and under the gold standard

1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:40.360
 everyone in the world had the ability

1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:42.360
 to provide for their future

1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.360
 by simply using the same money that they use

1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:46.360
 you would work a day and you would get paid

1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:48.360
 in a gold coin and you could take that

1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:50.360
 gold coin and keep it safe

1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:52.360
 for 10 years and know

1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.360
 that at the end of those 10 years that

1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:56.360
 gold coin would buy you slightly

1:53:56.360 --> 1:53:58.360
 more than what it bought you the day that you

1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:00.360
 earned it. So anybody could

1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:02.360
 provide for their future and anybody

1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:04.360
 could have very high degree of certainty

1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:06.360
 that whatever

1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:08.360
 their saving is going to be there

1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:10.360
 and they want it in the future

1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:12.360
 because the money supply was only increasing

1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:14.360
 at 1.5% whereas

1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:16.360
 the production of goods

1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:18.360
 and services was increasing for most

1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:20.360
 cases

1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:22.360
 for most periods at a higher rate than that

1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:24.360
 so you could buy more apples and oranges

1:54:24.360 --> 1:54:26.360
 and houses and cars at the

1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:28.360
 end of the 10 years than you could

1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:30.360
 at the beginning of the 10 years so everybody had

1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:32.360
 a way of providing for the future and

1:54:32.360 --> 1:54:34.360
 with that people lower their time preference

1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:36.360
 and that is reflected across

1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:38.360
 all aspects of life

1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:40.360
 I think it's not just an economic thing

1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:42.360
 you see it in the savings rate you know the ability

1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:44.360
 to deny yourself gratification today

1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:46.360
 I could take the money that I have

1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:48.360
 and throw a giant party

1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:50.360
 buy a sports car buy a yacht

1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:52.360
 and yet you decide

1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:54.360
 I'm not going to do that I'm going to keep it so that tomorrow

1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:56.360
 I can throw a bigger party

1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:58.360
 or buy a better yacht or

1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:00.360
 have a better life or give my children

1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:02.360
 a better life. So

1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:04.360
 all of human civilization really is the process

1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:06.360
 of us lowering our time preference

1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:08.360
 and finding harder

1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:10.360
 monies that allow us to provide better for the future

1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:12.360
 is how we

1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:14.360
 really technologically we do that

1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.360
 I think of the

1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:18.360
 hardness of money as being the control knob

1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:20.360
 for our time preference

1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:22.360
 and you can see this reflected

1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.360
 in the 20th century where we go from

1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:26.360
 the money supply increases at around

1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:28.360
 one and a half percent under gold

1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:30.360
 to this current situation where

1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:32.360
 over the last 60 years I ran the numbers

1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:34.360
 on money supply and fiat

1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:36.360
 the global fiat supply has increased

1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.360
 at around 14% per year so

1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:40.360
 we've done a 10x in the increase

1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.360
 in the supply of money

1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:44.360
 annually and 14%

1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.360
 is a weighted average so

1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:48.360
 if you take a basic numerical average

1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:50.360
 for all fiat currencies you get something

1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:52.360
 like 30% the average

1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:54.360
 fiat currency increases by 30%

1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:56.360
 but if you value it by

1:55:56.360 --> 1:55:58.360
 the volume of each currency so that

1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:00.360
 you know you're not giving equal weight

1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.360
 to the Venezuelan bolivar

1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:04.360
 increasing at 500%

1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:06.360
 a year and the dollar increasing at 8%

1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:08.360
 a year

1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:10.360
 if you do it by value of the currencies

1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:12.360
 so that you get the total supply of fiat

1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:14.360
 it's something like 14%

1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:16.360
 unweighted is 30% you said

1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:18.360
 I'd like to see the worst ones

1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:20.360
 the people that

1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:22.360
 track that average up

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:24.360
 but 14% is still

1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:26.360
 an incredibly high high number

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.360
 and so you're saying that

1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:30.360
 over the century

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.360
 over the past 60 years 1960 to 2020

1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:34.360
 we get World Bank data on that

1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.360
 pretty reliable data on World Bank

1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:38.360
 and European Union OECD data

1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:40.360
 I ran the numbers on that

1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:42.360
 weighted average something like 14%

1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:44.360
 and what effect that has

1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:46.360
 on time preference?

1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:48.360
 the effect is now it's much much much harder

1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:50.360
 for everybody to provide for their future

1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.360
 everywhere in the world it's much harder

1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.360
 so how do I

1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:56.360
 get the equivalent of the old gold coin

1:56:56.360 --> 1:56:58.360
 that I could just put under my mattress

1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:00.360
 and expect it to be there 10 years from now

1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:02.360
 while gold itself isn't cutting it

1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:04.360
 gold can't keep up with inflation

1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:06.360
 and the reason for that is that gold is not being used

1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:08.360
 as a money anymore in that

1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:10.360
 you can't

1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:12.360
 send it

1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.360
 internationally you can't use it to

1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:16.360
 settle trade internationally

1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:18.360
 which therefore means demand for it

1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:20.360
 monetarily is limited and so

1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:22.360
 it's becoming more and more

1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:24.360
 an industrial metal

1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:26.360
 as a result of the fact that

1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:28.360
 its value doesn't keep up with inflation

1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:30.360
 it becomes economical to use it in industry

1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:32.360
 so we're seeing gold become like silver

1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:34.360
 in that it gets used in industry

1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.360
 so the stockpile declines

1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.360
 so the stock to flow ratio declines as well

1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:40.360
 and it becomes more and more of an industrial metal

1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:42.360
 and it can't

1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.360
 protect your wealth over time very well

1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:46.360
 so what do you do? well you could

1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:48.360
 invest and this is kind of

1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:50.360
 the obvious answer that Keynesian will give you is

1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:52.360
 well you just put your money in an investment

1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:54.360
 but investment is different from saving

1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:56.360
 saving the whole point of saving

1:57:56.360 --> 1:57:58.360
 is that the thing is liquid and that the thing

1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:00.360
 carries little uncertainty you know

1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:02.360
 you just held the gold coin

1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:04.360
 and it just sat there it did nothing

1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:06.360
 it didn't take risk you knew

1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:08.360
 that it was going to be there in 10 years investment means

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:10.360
 you give the gold coin to somebody

1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:12.360
 to go and do something with it

1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:14.360
 and it could work it could not work

1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:16.360
 if it works you get a positive return

1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:18.360
 you get more gold back if it

1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:20.360
 fails you might not get any of your gold back

1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:22.360
 so taking on risk

1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:24.360
 is something very different from saving

1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.360
 saving is just a way of buying the future

1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:28.360
 investing is taking on

1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:30.360
 a risk and you could

1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.360
 lose everything with it so

1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:34.360
 what ends up happening and this is

1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.360
 the Keynesian objection I think is

1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:38.360
 very

1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:40.360
 wrong and bad because

1:58:40.360 --> 1:58:42.360
 investment

1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:44.360
 is a job in itself to

1:58:44.360 --> 1:58:46.360
 figure out what to do with your money in order to

1:58:46.360 --> 1:58:48.360
 beat inflation

1:58:48.360 --> 1:58:50.360
 is something that you know

1:58:50.360 --> 1:58:52.360
 there are professionals out there on Wall Street

1:58:52.360 --> 1:58:54.360
 that have PhDs in finance that have enormous

1:58:54.360 --> 1:58:56.360
 computers and

1:58:56.360 --> 1:58:58.360
 they have enormous staffs of

1:58:58.360 --> 1:59:00.360
 PhDs and master's degrees and math nerds

1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:02.360
 that are crunching numbers and figuring out

1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:04.360
 how to allocate your portfolio

1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:06.360
 so that you can beat inflation and guess what

1:59:06.360 --> 1:59:08.360
 the majority of them don't beat inflation

1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:10.360
 the majority of them can't beat inflation

1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:12.360
 not as measured by CPI

1:59:12.360 --> 1:59:14.360
 which is completely fraudulent but

1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:16.360
 if you remember 14%

1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:18.360
 or even you know the 7%

1:59:18.360 --> 1:59:20.360
 like if you look at just the increase in the

1:59:20.360 --> 1:59:22.360
 money supply which I think is a much better metric

1:59:22.360 --> 1:59:24.360
 and this is what's reflected on the

1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:26.360
 desirable goods like if you look at the price

1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:28.360
 of real estate in Miami Beach

1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:30.360
 as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example

1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:32.360
 it goes up at around 6% 7% per year

1:59:32.360 --> 1:59:34.360
 on average over the last century

1:59:34.360 --> 1:59:36.360
 so that's you know if you want

1:59:36.360 --> 1:59:38.360
 to live in a nice area that's what

1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:40.360
 happening to real estate if you want to go to the good universities

1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:42.360
 that's what's going up it's going up at a rate

1:59:42.360 --> 1:59:44.360
 that's similar to the increase in the money supply

1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:46.360
 and you can beat CPI

1:59:46.360 --> 1:59:48.360
 but you know CPI

1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:50.360
 is designed so you can beat it

1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:52.360
 but you can't really beat the appreciation

1:59:52.360 --> 1:59:54.360
 in the things that you actually want to buy

1:59:54.360 --> 1:59:56.360
 in the price of good food the price of good real estate

1:59:56.360 --> 1:59:58.360
 so

1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:00.360
 and you know most investment professionals

2:00:00.360 --> 2:00:02.360
 fail at doing that so what hope

2:00:02.360 --> 2:00:04.360
 does a doctor

2:00:04.360 --> 2:00:06.360
 or an engineer or a scientist

2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:08.360
 or an athlete have in doing those things

2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:10.360
 investment is hard and saving

2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:12.360
 should be easy exactly

2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:14.360
 saving is essential

2:00:14.360 --> 2:00:16.360
 for us as a civilization

2:00:16.360 --> 2:00:18.360
 and what Fiat did is it took that away

2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:20.360
 from us and then it forced everybody

2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:22.360
 to become an investor

2:00:22.360 --> 2:00:24.360
 or more accurately a gambler because

2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:26.360
 you're not just even because the money

2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:28.360
 itself is broken because the money itself

2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:30.360
 is constantly changing in value

2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:32.360
 investing is becoming more of a crapshoot

2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:34.360
 I mean value investing is

2:00:34.360 --> 2:00:36.360
 completely underperforming

2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:38.360
 compared to market analysis

2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:40.360
 you know you listen to the Fed

2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:42.360
 and you

2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:46.360
 what matters to the price of individual

2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:48.360
 companies is monetary policy much more

2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:50.360
 than it is their own performance so

2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:52.360
 basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed

2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:54.360
 and following all of the world's central banks

2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:56.360
 and you need to learn macroeconomics and you need to learn

2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:58.360
 what all the central banks are doing

2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:00.360
 and you need to understand how commodity markets

2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:02.360
 work and you need to understand how equity markets

2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:04.360
 work and bond markets and real estate markets

2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:06.360
 you need to do all of those things

2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:08.360
 just in order to be able to save

2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:10.360
 and earn the

2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:12.360
 and keep the money that you've already earned

2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:14.360
 that's the criminal thing about it

2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:16.360
 like I've already earned that money

2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:18.360
 being a doctor being a dentist

2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:20.360
 being an athlete being an engineer I built a house

2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:22.360
 for somebody and I got that money

2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:24.360
 and all I want to do is just make sure that I can

2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:26.360
 have it 10 years from now

2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:28.360
 the only way to do so is to become a crappy

2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:30.360
 engineer because you have to spend half your

2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:32.360
 time not doing engineering

2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:34.360
 instead spend half of that time

2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:36.360
 learning about Japanese central bank

2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:38.360
 monetary policy and commodity markets

2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:40.360
 and what's going to happen to copper

2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:42.360
 and what's going to happen to oil and

2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:44.360
 what's happening in the wars

2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.360
 and what's happening with foreign policy

2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:48.360
 and Russia and the US

2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:50.360
 and all of those things

2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:52.360
 under the

2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:54.360
 gold standard you didn't care about any of that stuff

2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:56.360
 your gold coin worked regardless of all of those

2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:58.360
 things so what this means is

2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:00.360
 the future so first of all you know we have

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:02.360
 all of the problems I mentioned but also

2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:04.360
 it means that the future

2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:06.360
 becomes much more uncertain so

2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:08.360
 you're far less likely to provide for yourself

2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:10.360
 10 years from now far less likely to

2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:12.360
 find an easy way to give yourself

2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.360
 value 10 years from now

2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:16.360
 and so you become more short termist

2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:18.360
 and that is reflected economically

2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:20.360
 in a lower savings rate and we see savings

2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:22.360
 rates decline but it is also

2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:24.360
 reflected in all manners of decision making

2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.360
 and I think if you really want to see

2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:28.360
 what it is take a look at

2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:30.360
 a society that goes through hyperinflation

2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:32.360
 and look at what happens there

2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:34.360
 how do people

2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:36.360
 change under hyperinflation

2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:38.360
 and compare that to

2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:40.360
 essentially what we see in the 20th

2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:42.360
 century all over under

2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:44.360
 not hyperinflation but under low inflation

2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:46.360
 10, 15%

2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:48.360
 that you see across the board most of the time

2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:50.360
 is just slow motion

2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:52.360
 hyperinflation so what happens in hyperinflation

2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:54.360
 everybody gets their paychecks

2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:56.360
 they run straight to the supermarket

2:02:56.360 --> 2:02:58.360
 they spend all of their money

2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:00.360
 nobody thinks about savings

2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:02.360
 nobody thinks about the future

2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:04.360
 survival until the end of this month

2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:06.360
 is highly uncertain

2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:08.360
 how likely are you to be planning for what

2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:10.360
 you are going to be doing 5 years from now

2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:12.360
 very unlikely

2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:14.360
 but also it is

2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:16.360
 reflected not just economically

2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:18.360
 it is also reflected in all aspects of morality

2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:20.360
 all the way in which we deal with each other

2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:22.360
 as human beings when

2:03:22.360 --> 2:03:24.360
 your survival is precarious

2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:26.360
 how much are you invested in the notion

2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:28.360
 of being a good citizen

2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:30.360
 about your reputation

2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:32.360
 on caring about not getting caught in a crime

2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:34.360
 all of these things become harder

2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:36.360
 to value

2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:38.360
 so people start committing crime

2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:40.360
 people start caring less and less about the future

2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:42.360
 and we see it reflected in everything

2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:44.360
 and I argue you see it reflected in architecture

2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:46.360
 we used to build houses in the 19th century

2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:48.360
 that last until today

2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:50.360
 and then in the 20th century we build

2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:52.360
 essentially disposable cardboard boxes

2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:54.360
 that get scrapped in 20 years

2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:56.360
 so what can you say about

2:03:56.360 --> 2:03:58.360
 the potential positive effects

2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:00.360
 of lower time preferences

2:04:00.360 --> 2:04:02.360
 so it is a balance

2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:04.360
 basically

2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:06.360
 you are talking about an average kind of time preference

2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:08.360
 but there are some things in life

2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:10.360
 where low time preference

2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:12.360
 can be a negative thing

2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:14.360
 so if I want to take on risk

2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:16.360
 not for investment

2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:18.360
 but say I want to start a business

2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:20.360
 I want to take

2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.360
 something crazy take a leap into the unknown

2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:24.360
 be an entrepreneur

2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:26.360
 what can you say about that kind of leap

2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:28.360
 taking on debt

2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:30.360
 what is the value of that

2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:32.360
 within the current system

2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:34.360
 what is the right approach to that

2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:36.360
 within the current system what is the right approach overall

2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:38.360
 from an economics perspective

2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.360
 so it is not saving for the future

2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:42.360
 it is

2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.360
 doing something while

2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:46.360
 taking the money from your mattress

2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:48.360
 taking on debt

2:04:48.360 --> 2:04:50.360
 and having a dream in your heart

2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:52.360
 that you somehow just want to do

2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:54.360
 a decision but it is something

2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:56.360
 as being human

2:04:56.360 --> 2:04:58.360
 it is taking a leap into the unknown

2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:00.360
 because something in your heart says to do it

2:05:00.360 --> 2:05:02.360
 I think you are more likely to be taking the leap in the unknown

2:05:02.360 --> 2:05:04.360
 when you have a little bit of gold

2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:06.360
 in the mattress than when you don't

2:05:06.360 --> 2:05:08.360
 I think this is the thing

2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:10.360
 if you look at the late 19th century

2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:12.360
 and I discussed this in the Bitcoin standard

2:05:12.360 --> 2:05:14.360
 that was arguably the most innovative

2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:16.360
 period in human history

2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:18.360
 there is qualitative evidence

2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:20.360
 look at the world around you today

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:22.360
 pretty much everything that we use

2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:24.360
 was invented in that period

2:05:24.360 --> 2:05:26.360
 the car, the airplane

2:05:26.360 --> 2:05:28.360
 the telegraph

2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:30.360
 the telephone

2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:32.360
 the camera

2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:34.360
 pretty much modern life as

2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:36.360
 late 19th century

2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:38.360
 the period between 1870 and 1914

2:05:38.360 --> 2:05:40.360
 because the whole world was practically

2:05:40.360 --> 2:05:42.360
 on a gold standard

2:05:42.360 --> 2:05:44.360
 the whole world was using the same money

2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:46.360
 and the whole world could save in the same currency

2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:48.360
 that meant

2:05:48.360 --> 2:05:50.360
 two bicycle shop owning brothers

2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:52.360
 in North Carolina

2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:54.360
 could go and try and fly

2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:56.360
 even as all the scientific experts in 1903

2:05:56.360 --> 2:05:58.360
 were

2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:00.360
 confirming that

2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:02.360
 the possibility of flight has been

2:06:02.360 --> 2:06:04.360
 debunked as unscientific

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.360
 Lord Kelvin said

2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:08.360
 not in a million years we are going to be flying

2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:10.360
 Thomas Edison said it is never going to happen

2:06:10.360 --> 2:06:12.360
 no I think it was Edison who said a million years

2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:14.360
 but Kelvin also said it is never going to happen

2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:16.360
 The New York Times said it is never going to happen

2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:18.360
 the same month in which

2:06:18.360 --> 2:06:20.360
 the Wright brothers did it

2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:22.360
 and they continued to deny that it was going to happen

2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:24.360
 even two years after they did it

2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:26.360
 but

2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:28.360
 why could they do that?

2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:30.360
 because they had savings in gold

2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:32.360
 they had the security with something that you know

2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:34.360
 is going to be there

2:06:34.360 --> 2:06:36.360
 and then you can take a risk with the stuff

2:06:36.360 --> 2:06:38.360
 that is extra you know

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:40.360
 I have say three years expenditures

2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:42.360
 in gold under my mattress

2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:44.360
 and I know that I could take a risk

2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:46.360
 with everything else because whatever

2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:48.360
 bad things happen with all of my dreams

2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:50.360
 like even you know flying

2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:52.360
 think about how insane that is

2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:54.360
 I still can go back to the three years of

2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:56.360
 gold that I have saved

2:06:56.360 --> 2:06:58.360
 still okay to take on debt

2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:00.360
 given the stuff the gold under the mattress

2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:02.360
 well this is the thing under the gold standard

2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:04.360
 the way that people finance things was predominantly

2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:06.360
 with capital with equity

2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:08.360
 because you had gold savings

2:07:08.360 --> 2:07:10.360
 I had gold savings everybody had gold savings

2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:12.360
 when you wanted to start the business

2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:14.360
 you could use your own savings or somebody else's savings

2:07:14.360 --> 2:07:16.360
 so you didn't need to

2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:18.360
 get into debt

2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:20.360
 well you could get equity from others

2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:22.360
 and you could also get debt from others

2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:24.360
 but it's directly mapped

2:07:24.360 --> 2:07:26.360
 to physical reality

2:07:26.360 --> 2:07:28.360
 it's directly mapped to economic reality

2:07:28.360 --> 2:07:30.360
 and that there's a hard money out there

2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:32.360
 that you know what you're spending money

2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:34.360
 you want to build your airplane factory

2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:36.360
 you need to get actual resources

2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:38.360
 so you get actual gold either yours or somebody else's

2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:40.360
 you borrow it or you give them equity

2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:42.360
 but there's real resources

2:07:42.360 --> 2:07:44.360
 now what happened with the fiat system

2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:46.360
 and this is the first part of the book

2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:48.360
 where I look at it from an engineering kind of perspective

2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:50.360
 is essentially

2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:52.360
 and I think this is like the breakthrough inside of the book

2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:54.360
 what fiat does

2:07:54.360 --> 2:07:56.360
 is that it replaces gold mining

2:07:56.360 --> 2:07:58.360
 with credit creation

2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:00.360
 the way that we make fiat money

2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:02.360
 the way that fiat is

2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:04.360
 mined into existence

2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:06.360
 is through credit creation

2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:08.360
 most people think of fiat money as being something that happens when government prints money

2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:10.360
 and we still use the term government's printing money

2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:12.360
 but the vast majority of fiat

2:08:12.360 --> 2:08:14.360
 is not physical

2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:16.360
 and in fact fiat is not created when it is printed

2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:18.360
 physically

2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:20.360
 it's created when it is lent

2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:22.360
 so when you go to a bank

2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:24.360
 to get a $1 million loan to buy a house

2:08:24.360 --> 2:08:26.360
 that bank is not going to give you a million dollars

2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:28.360
 from their own money or from their depositors money

2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:30.360
 they're going to make a fresh new million dollars

2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:32.360
 when you walk out of that bank

2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:34.360
 the money supply has increased

2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:36.360
 by $1 million to finance your home

2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:38.360
 so

2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:40.360
 what fiat does

2:08:40.360 --> 2:08:42.360
 is it was basically

2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:44.360
 born out of government credit

2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:46.360
 and the credit of banks that are backed

2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:48.360
 by the central bank and the government

2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:50.360
 so if you're part of

2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:52.360
 the institutions that are allowed

2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:54.360
 fiat privilege where you can just issue

2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:56.360
 loans backed by the central bank

2:08:56.360 --> 2:08:58.360
 backed by the currency

2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.360
 you are effectively creating new currency

2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:02.360
 new money every time you issue the loan

2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:04.360
 that's fiat mining is credit creation

2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:06.360
 i love it

2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:08.360
 can you say something

2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:10.360
 you can't really have credit without a demand for credit

2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:12.360
 you can't really have an increase in supply

2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:14.360
 without a demand for it

2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:16.360
 is there any value you place

2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:18.360
 in the humans wanting it

2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:20.360
 basically

2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:22.360
 people wanting to do something with that credit

2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:24.360
 wanting to take big leaps

2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:26.360
 big risks big entrepreneurial decisions

2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:28.360
 so

2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:30.360
 is it all bad is all credit bad

2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.360
 no i think

2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:34.360
 what's bad is

2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.360
 anything in my opinion

2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:38.360
 anything that is consensual

2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:40.360
 i want to borrow money from you and we agree the terms

2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:42.360
 i can't object to that

2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.360
 as long as you and i both agree

2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:46.360
 i can't object to that

2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:48.360
 but in the case of the fiat

2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:50.360
 system it's not just you and the bank

2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.360
 who come to an agreement

2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:54.360
 everybody who uses the currency

2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:56.360
 is forced to be part of that agreement

2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:58.360
 because if you default

2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.360
 effectively what's protecting the bank

2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:02.360
 is the fact that the government can just print

2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:04.360
 a bunch of money and make the bank hold

2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:06.360
 so effectively

2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:08.360
 that's interesting so that

2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:10.360
 little agreement between

2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:12.360
 the bank and you is

2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:14.360
 actually an agreement between the bank you

2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:16.360
 and the entire populace that's using the currency

2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:18.360
 exactly they're forced to provide

2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:20.360
 the safety net for you and me to go and make

2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:22.360
 that loan and that safety net

2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.360
 is the devaluation of the currency

2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:26.360
 that's how it

2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:28.360
 the whole thing actually works

2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:30.360
 so this is why you know

2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:32.360
 i wrote the bitcoin standard explaining bitcoin

2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:34.360
 and basically the takeaway message of the bitcoin standard

2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:36.360
 is you need to stack as much bitcoin as you can

2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:38.360
 because this is the best money that has ever been invented

2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.360
 and we'll talk about that

2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.360
 why bitcoin is the hardest money

2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:44.360
 but with fiat

2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:46.360
 the conclusion of the fiat standard

2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:48.360
 again this is not financial advice

2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:50.360
 i'm a lowly academic

2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:52.360
 you shouldn't listen to me on issues of money

2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:54.360
 but i think theoretically and intellectually

2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:56.360
 the conclusion of the fiat system

2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:58.360
 is to be short fiat as much as you can

2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:00.360
 that's the smart winning move

2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:02.360
 so human wisdom

2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:04.360
 over thousands of years is to save

2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:06.360
 try and not borrow as much as you can

2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:08.360
 try and accumulate as much savings as you can

2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:10.360
 that's reversed under fiat

2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:12.360
 if you're saving money

2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:14.360
 you're just subsidizing everybody else taking on loans

2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:16.360
 if you're taking on loans

2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:18.360
 you're benefiting from all the people that are

2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:20.360
 borrowing so the winning move

2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:22.360
 under the fiat system and this is what rich people do

2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:24.360
 is you borrow

2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:26.360
 under the fiat monetary system

2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:28.360
 they don't hold assets

2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.360
 if you're worth a billion dollars today

2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:32.360
 you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account

2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:34.360
 you've got maybe

2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.360
 a hundred thousand, a million

2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:38.360
 five million

2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:40.360
 or something like that

2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:42.360
 a tiny fraction of your money is held in cash

2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:44.360
 the majority is going to be held

2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:46.360
 in all kinds of other hard assets

2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:48.360
 and you're going to be borrowing

2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:50.360
 the richest people in the world are the biggest borrowers

2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:52.360
 in the world

2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:54.360
 and that's how they are the richest

2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:56.360
 and the most powerful because

2:11:56.360 --> 2:11:58.360
 every time you're borrowing

2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:00.360
 you're giving the bank an excuse

2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:02.360
 to print new money

2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:04.360
 so you're devaluing everybody else's money

2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:06.360
 and you're getting a bit of the cut

2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:08.360
 if you're going to buy a house

2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:10.360
 with your savings

2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:12.360
 you're accumulating the savings and they're losing value

2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:14.360
 and

2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:16.360
 if I were to go to buy

2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:18.360
 the same house with credit

2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:20.360
 I'm getting the bank to print

2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:22.360
 money for me so obviously

2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:24.360
 they can cut me in on that deal

2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:26.360
 and that's why it's much cheaper for everybody to buy with credit

2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.360
 that's why everybody buys everything

2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:30.360
 on credit

2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:32.360
 so when we look at the global monetary system

2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:34.360
 the thing you want to do as a government

2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:36.360
 is be the sexiest currency

2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:38.360
 out there

2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:40.360
 so the

2:12:40.360 --> 2:12:42.360
 the main currency like the dollar currently

2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:44.360
 is the one that has the most power

2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:46.360
 in that kind of context

2:12:46.360 --> 2:12:48.360
 so you have if you were

2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:50.360
 to try to summarize what is the global monetary system

2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:52.360
 as it is today

2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:54.360
 is a bunch of fiat currencies

2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:56.360
 battling

2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:58.360
 for position

2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:00.360
 for use

2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:02.360
 outside their nation

2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:04.360
 and so doing

2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:06.360
 trying to gain power in the geopolitical sense

2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.360
 is that if we just zoom out

2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:10.360
 what is the global monetary system

2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:12.360
 like what is it currently

2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:14.360
 so outside the United States

2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.360
 the whole thing

2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:18.360
 you could say that but I think it's more realistic

2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:20.360
 looking at how it has actually evolved over the past few decades

2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:22.360
 it's really a dollar system

2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:24.360
 it's not a system of currencies

2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:26.360
 vying with one another

2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:28.360
 it's a dollar system and all other currencies are just

2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:30.360
 basically I like to call them dollar

2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:32.360
 plus country risk

2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:34.360
 so

2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:36.360
 it always returns home to the dollar

2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.360
 yeah there is no competition

2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:40.360
 there is no second best as Michael Saylor would say

2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:42.360
 and money is like that

2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:44.360
 you know gold was a winner take all

2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:46.360
 by the end of the 19th century

2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:48.360
 the global monetary market is effectively

2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:50.360
 a winner take all for the dollar

2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:52.360
 and

2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:54.360
 if we get it to bitcoin you'll know

2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:56.360
 I also think digital currencies

2:13:56.360 --> 2:13:58.360
 are also going to be a winner take all situation

2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:00.360
 so

2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:02.360
 money wants to be won in fact there is no such thing

2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:04.360
 as multiple currencies multiple currencies

2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:06.360
 is just a step back to barter

2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:08.360
 money is

2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:10.360
 one if you go back to a system of several currencies

2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:12.360
 you're just reinventing barter

2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:14.360
 so

2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:16.360
 in the case of the dollar system

2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:18.360
 the global dollar system is built around

2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:20.360
 the dollar

2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:22.360
 because all central banks have dollar

2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:24.360
 reserves and because all central banks

2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:26.360
 use the dollar's clearing mechanisms

2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.360
 so that's why you're basically

2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:30.360
 playing in the dollar system

2:14:30.360 --> 2:14:32.360
 this seems to have changed over the last couple

2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:34.360
 of months with the

2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:36.360
 sanctions on Russia and the confiscation of

2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:38.360
 Russian reserves it remains

2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.360
 to be seen what that's going

2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:42.360
 to do and how that's going to change

2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:44.360
 but

2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:46.360
 it is looking like

2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:48.360
 this dollar system is clearly

2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:50.360
 unsustainable it's not sustainable for the US

2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:52.360
 it's not sustainable for anybody

2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:54.360
 speaking of which so you

2:14:54.360 --> 2:14:56.360
 do an amazing

2:14:56.360 --> 2:14:58.360
 podcast called the bitcoin standard podcast

2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:00.360
 so episode 108

2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:02.360
 of that podcast is about

2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:04.360
 the very thing you just mentioned

2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.360
 and allow me please to read the description of that

2:15:06.360 --> 2:15:08.360
 and then ask you a couple questions about your thoughts

2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:10.360
 in general

2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:12.360
 the description reads

2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:14.360
 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine

2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:16.360
 the US confiscated the Russian central banks

2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:18.360
 significant monetary reserves

2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:20.360
 and banned some Russian banks from the swift network

2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:22.360
 serious questions are being asked

2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:24.360
 about the survival of the post war

2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:26.360
 dollar based world

2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:28.360
 monetary order

2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:30.360
 will Russia, China and other countries

2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:32.360
 actually build an alternative international settlement

2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:34.360
 system after years of threatening

2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:36.360
 to do so

2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.360
 will global central banks stop accumulating

2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:40.360
 US treasury bonds

2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:42.360
 and replace them with gold and commodities

2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:44.360
 will we witness the birth

2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:46.360
 of a new commodity of gold based monetary order

2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:48.360
 in this seminar

2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:50.360
 we use the insights from the bitcoin standard

2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:52.360
 and the fiat standard

2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:54.360
 on temporal and spatial salability

2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:56.360
 to explain why reports

2:15:56.360 --> 2:15:58.360
 of the death of the dollar and the emergence

2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:00.360
 of a new gold standard may be exaggerated

2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:02.360
 so I would love to get your analysis

2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:04.360
 on this situation

2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:06.360
 what are the fundamentals of it

2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:08.360
 what is swift, what are the possible future

2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:10.360
 evolutions of the global monetary system

2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:12.360
 yeah so swift is the network that the US

2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:14.360
 Federal Reserve uses

2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:16.360
 for moving money around

2:16:16.360 --> 2:16:18.360
 the world

2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:20.360
 so basically the US government can sanction you

2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:22.360
 off of swift as they've done with

2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:24.360
 Russian banks, as they've done with Iran

2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:26.360
 and as they've done with Afghanistan

2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:28.360
 so

2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:30.360
 effectively, I mean this is really the

2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:32.360
 catastrophe of the current monetary system

2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:34.360
 in order to be able to trade

2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:36.360
 as a member, as a citizen

2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:38.360
 of your country, you need your monopoly

2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:40.360
 local central bank

2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:42.360
 to be on good terms with the US government

2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:44.360
 so that they would let them operate it

2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:46.360
 and this is really like

2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:48.360
 on top of the

2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:50.360
 aspect of the hardness of money, this is the other

2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:52.360
 really powerful thing about bitcoin

2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:54.360
 which is that it's just purely a technological thing

2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:56.360
 it doesn't matter

2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:58.360
 if you're Russian, if you're Iranian, if you're American

2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:00.360
 if you're Chinese, it's a technology

2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:02.360
 so it's like a spoon or a knife

2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:04.360
 or a car, you know

2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:06.360
 you operate it properly and it works

2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:08.360
 so with bitcoin it's the same thing, it doesn't care about

2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:10.360
 your passport, if you have the private key

2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:12.360
 you click send and the money

2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:14.360
 goes, well it doesn't really

2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:16.360
 go, but effectively it does

2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:18.360
 go anywhere at once and

2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:20.360
 the money can move without having

2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:22.360
 to abide by political situations

2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:24.360
 and the point here is not to bash

2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:26.360
 US foreign policy much

2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:28.360
 as that might be deserved, I'm just going to discuss

2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:30.360
 it from a kind of technical

2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:32.360
 perspective, it has to be a political system

2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:34.360
 with fiat because ultimately it relies

2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:36.360
 on credit and then the government

2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:38.360
 is the one that has the guns and the government is going

2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.360
 to decide who gets to pay their loans

2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:42.360
 anyway and the government's

2:17:42.360 --> 2:17:44.360
 going to have to

2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:46.360
 make its own rules about

2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:48.360
 who gets to play and who doesn't and so

2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:50.360
 it has to be political as this kind

2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:52.360
 of fiat system

2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:54.360
 and

2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:56.360
 when I wrote the bitcoin standard

2:17:56.360 --> 2:17:58.360
 initially I used to be much more of a gold

2:17:58.360 --> 2:18:00.360
 bug and in my mind

2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:02.360
 gold bugs have spent the last 50 years

2:18:02.360 --> 2:18:04.360
 saying the global monetary system

2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:06.360
 is going to collapse next week and we're going to go back to

2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:08.360
 a gold standard and writing

2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:10.360
 the fiat standard

2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:12.360
 gave me a very good appreciation for why this

2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:14.360
 hasn't happened and why it's not

2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:16.360
 very likely to happen and I think

2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:18.360
 the reason is, as I said earlier

2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:20.360
 gold is very expensive to move around

2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:22.360
 and perhaps more importantly

2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:24.360
 is very expensive to verify, that's

2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:26.360
 really the problem with it, it's very expensive

2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:28.360
 to verify that the gold that you're receiving

2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:30.360
 is original gold so the only

2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:32.360
 way to do this properly

2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:34.360
 is to melt the gold bars down

2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:36.360
 and recast them which is pretty

2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:38.360
 expensive so

2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:40.360
 we have this situation now where Russia

2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:42.360
 which is one of the biggest economies in the world

2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.360
 has been kicked off

2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:46.360
 to varying degrees off of the global

2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:48.360
 monetary system and the US has confiscated

2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:50.360
 their reserves and I don't

2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:52.360
 have political opinions about the war

2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:54.360
 it's not something I'm very familiar with

2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:56.360
 it's outside of my area of expertise

2:18:56.360 --> 2:18:58.360
 I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it

2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:00.360
 it is on the one hand

2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:02.360
 whether you think the war

2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:04.360
 is justified or the sanctions are justified

2:19:04.360 --> 2:19:06.360
 is not something I can opine on

2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:08.360
 but

2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:10.360
 the implication of this is that

2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:12.360
 effectively the US might be shooting itself

2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:14.360
 in the foot because it's telling everybody

2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:16.360
 in the world, your money

2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:18.360
 in our system is not really your money

2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:20.360
 it's just a token to play

2:19:20.360 --> 2:19:22.360
 in our arcade

2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:24.360
 at any point in time if you misbehave we kick you

2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:26.360
 out of the arcade and we take your tokens

2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:28.360
 and so

2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:30.360
 I mean this is something that

2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:32.360
 China, Russia, Iran and many countries

2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:34.360
 have made a lot of noise about over the past decades

2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:36.360
 it got

2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:38.360
 real this year

2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:40.360
 but it's been decades

2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:42.360
 of China, Iran and

2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:44.360
 Russia to some extent saying

2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:46.360
 that you know we want to build an alternative to the

2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:48.360
 US dollar based system

2:19:48.360 --> 2:19:50.360
 and yet they haven't

2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:52.360
 and I think there's very good reasons they haven't

2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:54.360
 and the reason is what do you do it based on

2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:56.360
 how do you build it so you can do

2:19:56.360 --> 2:19:58.360
 a credit based system based on

2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:00.360
 but then who's going to be the big boss

2:20:00.360 --> 2:20:02.360
 is it going to be China, is it going to be Russia

2:20:02.360 --> 2:20:04.360
 is it going to be Iran, is it going to be India

2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:06.360
 none of these countries wants to be

2:20:06.360 --> 2:20:08.360
 they don't want to jump out of

2:20:08.360 --> 2:20:10.360
 the US based system

2:20:10.360 --> 2:20:12.360
 to get into somebody else's based system

2:20:12.360 --> 2:20:14.360
 so China doesn't want to use a Russian system

2:20:14.360 --> 2:20:16.360
 Russia doesn't want to use a Chinese system

2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:18.360
 and so therefore you can't use their own

2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:20.360
 central banks currencies

2:20:20.360 --> 2:20:22.360
 don't you think they have enough leverage

2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:24.360
 India, China

2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:26.360
 Russia combined

2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:28.360
 with several other nations have enough leverage

2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:30.360
 and incentive to create

2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:32.360
 their own system

2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:34.360
 so any one player yes but if they collaborate

2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:36.360
 yeah but then okay

2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:38.360
 so what are you based on like

2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:40.360
 who's going to be the boss

2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:42.360
 who's going to be the one who can in this case China

2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:44.360
 right

2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:46.360
 China is becoming increasingly an economic

2:20:46.360 --> 2:20:48.360
 power in the world yeah that's

2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:50.360
 hard to deny yes it's true

2:20:50.360 --> 2:20:52.360
 and it's the most likely scenario perhaps

2:20:52.360 --> 2:20:54.360
 if we were to witness something like

2:20:54.360 --> 2:20:56.360
 this is going to be a Chinese

2:20:56.360 --> 2:20:58.360
 based system so is it possible to have

2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:00.360
 like a split

2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:02.360
 in

2:21:02.360 --> 2:21:04.360
 what is the driving currency of the world

2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:06.360
 it's possible but I don't think it's

2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:08.360
 sustainable again money wants to be one

2:21:08.360 --> 2:21:10.360
 and that's the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar

2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:12.360
 so we could see this emerge based

2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:14.360
 around the Yuan and

2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:16.360
 you know likely I mean

2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:18.360
 Russia is obviously going to hurt economically

2:21:18.360 --> 2:21:20.360
 from what happened from the confiscation of

2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:22.360
 the reserves and from the sanctions so

2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:24.360
 it's not going to be in a position

2:21:24.360 --> 2:21:26.360
 and of course because it's outside of the US

2:21:26.360 --> 2:21:28.360
 based system it's not in

2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:30.360
 the strongest negotiating position with the Chinese

2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:32.360
 so the Chinese might be able to

2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:34.360
 get them to join their Yuan based system

2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:36.360
 but I don't think that's sustainable in the

2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:38.360
 long run because

2:21:38.360 --> 2:21:40.360
 these governments can issue

2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:42.360
 their laws and make their

2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:44.360
 designs and then make their monetary

2:21:44.360 --> 2:21:46.360
 systems but ultimately

2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:48.360
 there's

2:21:48.360 --> 2:21:50.360
 there are billions of Chinese people and

2:21:50.360 --> 2:21:52.360
 billions of dollar based people and they're going

2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:54.360
 to want to trade with one another and the power

2:21:54.360 --> 2:21:56.360
 to want to trade with one another is too strong

2:21:56.360 --> 2:21:58.360
 we can't just split the world economy into

2:21:58.360 --> 2:22:00.360
 two monetary systems that don't trade with one

2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:02.360
 another so then they're going to want to trade with one another

2:22:02.360 --> 2:22:04.360
 or the dark

2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:06.360
 possibility

2:22:06.360 --> 2:22:08.360
 is it

2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:10.360
 the inability to trade

2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:12.360
 as opposed to

2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:14.360
 being a forcing function for trade

2:22:14.360 --> 2:22:16.360
 it will become a forcing function

2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:18.360
 for conflict in cyberspace

2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:20.360
 and potentially hot war

2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:22.360
 yes this is the scary part of it

2:22:22.360 --> 2:22:24.360
 and this is basically how World War II happened

2:22:24.360 --> 2:22:26.360
 you know because

2:22:26.360 --> 2:22:28.360
 there's an old historian who used to say

2:22:28.360 --> 2:22:30.360
 when I think his name is Auto Mallory

2:22:30.360 --> 2:22:32.360
 and I quote him in the Bitcoin Standard

2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:34.360
 if goods don't cross borders then bombs will

2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:36.360
 if people trade with one another

2:22:36.360 --> 2:22:38.360
 they have an incentive for each other's well being

2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:40.360
 and then

2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:42.360
 they have less of an incentive to fight

2:22:42.360 --> 2:22:44.360
 and it was the death of global trade

2:22:44.360 --> 2:22:46.360
 in the 1930s because of the

2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:48.360
 failure of the fiat system

2:22:48.360 --> 2:22:50.360
 that brought about the rise

2:22:50.360 --> 2:22:52.360
 of the populism and the

2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:54.360
 rise of all those leaders that hated each other and helped

2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:56.360
 finance the war and bring it about

2:22:56.360 --> 2:22:58.360
 so that is the scary possibility

2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:00.360
 and of course you can't discount that

2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:02.360
 with all of the escalation that you see

2:23:02.360 --> 2:23:04.360
 that is a possibility that it could turn into

2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:06.360
 a real war but then

2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:08.360
 even so

2:23:08.360 --> 2:23:10.360
 I think ultimately you can't fight wars forever

2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:12.360
 that there's going to

2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:14.360
 it's going to end at some point and we're going to be back

2:23:14.360 --> 2:23:16.360
 at square one or well not

2:23:16.360 --> 2:23:18.360
 square one we're going to be back at the same dilemma

2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:20.360
 of who's going to have the global

2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:22.360
 monetary system and

2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:24.360
 so one alternative is that what the Chinese

2:23:24.360 --> 2:23:26.360
 and the Russians could do is they could

2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:28.360
 base it on a commodity

2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:30.360
 so a lot of people are now saying well they're going to base it on

2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:32.360
 copper and

2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:34.360
 corn and agricultural commodities

2:23:34.360 --> 2:23:36.360
 and that's

2:23:36.360 --> 2:23:38.360
 the analysis of saleability that

2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:40.360
 we discuss in the Bitcoin standard and the fiat standard

2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:42.360
 I don't think that's workable

2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:44.360
 if you end up basing the monetary system on copper

2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:46.360
 as we said earlier

2:23:46.360 --> 2:23:48.360
 doesn't matter how many governments say that we're going to

2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:50.360
 make a new monetary system based on

2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:52.360
 copper, grains

2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:54.360
 and nickel and

2:23:54.360 --> 2:23:56.360
 iron and so on

2:23:56.360 --> 2:23:58.360
 doesn't matter you're just going to stockpile

2:23:58.360 --> 2:24:00.360
 you're going to have to stockpile those things in order to

2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:02.360
 make a market in them

2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:04.360
 and then if you stockpile those things you're just

2:24:04.360 --> 2:24:06.360
 raising their value inviting the producers

2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:08.360
 to make more flood the market

2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:10.360
 I hope they don't try this because it's going to be

2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:12.360
 a devastating

2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:14.360
 impact on

2:24:14.360 --> 2:24:16.360
 the world economy you're going to have

2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:18.360
 central banks bidding up the price of essential commodities

2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:20.360
 that people need for real uses

2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:22.360
 in order to back their currencies with them

2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:24.360
 and then just incentivizing the

2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:26.360
 producers to make more and more and more of it

2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:28.360
 and then bringing the price back down so it's going to be

2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:30.360
 a very expensive mistake where we

2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:32.360
 raise the price of copper destroy a lot of

2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:34.360
 industries dependent on copper and it's not just copper

2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:36.360
 but also food and then increase the supply

2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:38.360
 beyond what we need and

2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:40.360
 the end result is copper miners make out well

2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:42.360
 governments go broke

2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:44.360
 and we end up

2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:46.360
 with a lot of rusting copper

2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:48.360
 in government

2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:50.360
 warehouses that's why I don't think it works

2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:52.360
 for the

2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:54.360
 to use commodities that are not

2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:56.360
 monetary commodities

2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:58.360
 then the question is maybe gold

2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:00.360
 can we go back on another gold standard

2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:02.360
 and I mean

2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:04.360
 Russia seems to have done that

2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:06.360
 I'm not so sure it's very difficult to get

2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:08.360
 reliable information I'm trying to look into this

2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:10.360
 more

2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:12.360
 but they seem to have said that they're

2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:14.360
 they're fixing the price of gold

2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:16.360
 in rubles so they will buy and sell

2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:18.360
 gold at a fixed rubble

2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:20.360
 rate which effectively means you're on a gold standard

2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:22.360
 now I'm not sure how

2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:24.360
 much how serious this

2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:26.360
 is how they've managed to stick to it

2:25:26.360 --> 2:25:28.360
 but it seems to have stabilized

2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:30.360
 the rubble and in fact brought it back to its pre

2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:32.360
 war level which I found absolutely

2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:34.360
 astonishing you know considering all the sanctions

2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:36.360
 going on but

2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:38.360
 in the short run

2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:40.360
 it's obviously much better than having your currency

2:25:40.360 --> 2:25:42.360
 pegged to nothing but in the long run

2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:44.360
 I also don't think gold

2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:46.360
 is going to cut it in the 21st century

2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:48.360
 do you think there's any chance

2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:50.360
 they go full gangster move

2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:52.360
 and

2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:54.360
 go into the digital space on the blockchain

2:25:54.360 --> 2:25:56.360
 and go with bitcoin

2:25:56.360 --> 2:25:58.360
 I think you know the point

2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:00.360
 of this discussion is that you know we run through

2:26:00.360 --> 2:26:02.360
 all these other options you know a Chinese

2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:04.360
 based system why it probably won't work

2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:06.360
 a commodity based system why it won't work

2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:08.360
 and a gold based system why

2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:10.360
 won't work I think they might have to

2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:12.360
 learn this the wrong way I mean

2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:14.360
 the hard way but eventually

2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:16.360
 I don't see them doing it now but eventually

2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:18.360
 I think

2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:20.360
 the winning move is going to be to go on a bitcoin based

2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:22.360
 monetary system well I don't know

2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:24.360
 if everything is always has to be the hard way

2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:26.360
 I'd love it

2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:28.360
 not to be but I mean it's

2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:30.360
 it doesn't look like there is

2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:32.360
 any kind of desire in China

2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:34.360
 or in Russia to switch to a bitcoin based

2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:36.360
 to take a leap to bitcoin

2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:38.360
 so unfortunately I think

2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:40.360
 we're going to go through a few

2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:42.360
 years maybe many years

2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:44.360
 of learning the lesson the hard way

2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:46.360
 of trying to accumulate these commodities

2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:48.360
 and seeing the limitations that make them

2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:50.360
 unsuitable as money today

2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:52.360
 one of the things I'm really concerned about

2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:54.360
 is the tension the amount

2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:56.360
 the increasing

2:26:56.360 --> 2:26:58.360
 amount of hate in the world yes

2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:00.360
 and the increasing amount

2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:02.360
 of power centers

2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:04.360
 in the world

2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:06.360
 between which

2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:08.360
 hate

2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:10.360
 is

2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:12.360
 making a regular appearance

2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:14.360
 and because the weapons of war becoming

2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:18.360
 more and more powerful as they have been in the past

2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:20.360
 many decades I'm really

2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:22.360
 concerned about nuclear war

2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:24.360
 so let us see if bitcoin can fix this

2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:26.360
 yes bitcoin fixes

2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:28.360
 all of this

2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:30.360
 first rule of bitcoin is

2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:32.360
 if it's a problem bitcoin fixes it

2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:34.360
 alright well I have some

2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:36.360
 personal questions for bitcoin then because I have some

2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:38.360
 my life is pretty fucked up

2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:40.360
 so I'll have to try to see

2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:42.360
 a quick pause for bathroom breaking

2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:44.360
 let's return to the basics

2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:46.360
 what is bitcoin

2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:48.360
 we started with what is money

2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:50.360
 what is bitcoin we talked about hard money

2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:52.360
 inflation

2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:54.360
 fiat

2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:56.360
 the history of money

2:27:56.360 --> 2:27:58.360
 the history of war in the 20th century

2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:00.360
 and that takes us into the 21st century

2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:02.360
 what is bitcoin

2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:04.360
 bitcoin is a software

2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:06.360
 and it's a distributed software

2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:08.360
 to operate peer to peer network between

2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:10.360
 members who are all equal

2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:12.360
 they're all peers

2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:14.360
 and what this software does is that it allows

2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:16.360
 you to operate a payment network

2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:18.360
 between those peers

2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:20.360
 and that payment network has its own currency

2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:22.360
 and

2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:24.360
 that seems like

2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:26.360
 just a simple software game

2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:28.360
 but the reason this is such a big deal is

2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:30.360
 I believe bitcoin is the most advanced

2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:32.360
 form of money ever invented

2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:34.360
 and the reason for that comes from two

2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:36.360
 properties that this network has

2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:38.360
 the first one

2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:40.360
 is that the currency is the hardest money

2:28:40.360 --> 2:28:42.360
 ever invented

2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:44.360
 is the money whose supply is the most

2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:46.360
 resistant to inflation

2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:48.360
 it's the first monetary asset that we've

2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:50.360
 ever invented that is guaranteed

2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:52.360
 to be fixed in its supply

2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:54.360
 that cannot be increased beyond a certain

2:28:54.360 --> 2:28:56.360
 number so there's only ever going to be 21

2:28:56.360 --> 2:28:58.360
 million bitcoins and that's

2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:00.360
 a qualitative leap forward

2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:02.360
 in our technologies of money

2:29:02.360 --> 2:29:04.360
 all of our monies leak

2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:06.360
 essentially because people can always

2:29:06.360 --> 2:29:08.360
 make more and more and more of them

2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:10.360
 the best money is the one that leaks the least

2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:12.360
 which is gold because it only

2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:14.360
 leaks one and a half percent in other words

2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:16.360
 your share of the gold

2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:18.360
 stock is

2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:20.360
 diluted by one and a half percent every year

2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:22.360
 ideally you'd like it to be

2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:24.360
 zero bitcoin is currently at around

2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:26.360
 1.8%

2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:28.360
 headed towards zero so it's the first money

2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:30.360
 that we've ever had that goes to zero

2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:32.360
 in terms of terminal supply so

2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:34.360
 there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin

2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:36.360
 I think that's a huge deal because you know

2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:38.360
 as I said earlier

2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:40.360
 money is always whatever is the hardest to make

2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:42.360
 and now bitcoin is the hardest thing to

2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:44.360
 make and then the second property

2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:46.360
 which is extremely important as well

2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:48.360
 is the fact that it operates

2:29:48.360 --> 2:29:50.360
 without the need to

2:29:50.360 --> 2:29:52.360
 trust in anybody it doesn't have a

2:29:52.360 --> 2:29:54.360
 party that is in charge of it it doesn't

2:29:54.360 --> 2:29:56.360
 have a central authority that can

2:29:56.360 --> 2:29:58.360
 you know it's as I said it's peer to

2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:00.360
 peer so there's it only has users

2:30:00.360 --> 2:30:02.360
 it doesn't have any admins

2:30:02.360 --> 2:30:04.360
 there's no authority in charge of

2:30:04.360 --> 2:30:06.360
 bitcoin that can take your bitcoin that can stop

2:30:06.360 --> 2:30:08.360
 you from using bitcoin that

2:30:08.360 --> 2:30:10.360
 can change the rules of bitcoin they can't make more

2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:12.360
 of it so it's fixed

2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:14.360
 it's available for anybody in the world

2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:16.360
 it's the hardest money ever invented

2:30:16.360 --> 2:30:18.360
 and it is absolutely

2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:20.360
 I think

2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:22.360
 an enormously

2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:24.360
 enormously significant invention because

2:30:24.360 --> 2:30:26.360
 if you read the fiat standard

2:30:26.360 --> 2:30:28.360
 and the bitcoin standard as well

2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:30.360
 you'll see my perspective for why I think

2:30:30.360 --> 2:30:32.360
 a very large number of problems

2:30:32.360 --> 2:30:34.360
 on the world are in the world

2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:36.360
 are caused by easy money are caused

2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:38.360
 by inflation

2:30:38.360 --> 2:30:40.360
 and caused by

2:30:40.360 --> 2:30:42.360
 government having access to essentially an infinite

2:30:42.360 --> 2:30:44.360
 a recourse to

2:30:44.360 --> 2:30:46.360
 people's wealth and I think

2:30:46.360 --> 2:30:48.360
 bitcoin fixes this because it

2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:50.360
 allows us to have

2:30:50.360 --> 2:30:52.360
 money that has the

2:30:52.360 --> 2:30:54.360
 salability of gold across time

2:30:54.360 --> 2:30:56.360
 meaning it holds its value across time

2:30:56.360 --> 2:30:58.360
 like gold but much better than gold

2:30:58.360 --> 2:31:00.360
 but also it has

2:31:00.360 --> 2:31:02.360
 it is similar to fiat and that fiat

2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:04.360
 can travel quickly but bitcoin can

2:31:04.360 --> 2:31:06.360
 travel even faster than fiat so

2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:08.360
 it combines

2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:10.360
 gold's salability

2:31:10.360 --> 2:31:12.360
 across time with fiat's salability

2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:14.360
 across space in one

2:31:14.360 --> 2:31:16.360
 immutable package that nobody can change

2:31:16.360 --> 2:31:18.360
 and nobody can control

2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:20.360
 Can you define the word salability?

2:31:20.360 --> 2:31:22.360
 Salability is the essential property

2:31:22.360 --> 2:31:24.360
 of money it's the ability

2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:26.360
 of a good to be sold

2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:28.360
 easily on the market

2:31:28.360 --> 2:31:30.360
 specifically to be sold without much loss

2:31:30.360 --> 2:31:32.360
 in its value so houses are

2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:34.360
 great for living in but they're not very

2:31:34.360 --> 2:31:36.360
 salable you know if you want to sell a house

2:31:36.360 --> 2:31:38.360
 you can just click a button and sell a house

2:31:38.360 --> 2:31:40.360
 and have a giant market of people

2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:42.360
 buying houses from you you need to

2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:44.360
 find

2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:46.360
 you need to find somebody who wants the exact house that you

2:31:46.360 --> 2:31:48.360
 have with the exact specifications that you have

2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:50.360
 and because you know houses are not identical

2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:52.360
 there's no liquid giant market for people

2:31:52.360 --> 2:31:54.360
 to just buy and sell identical

2:31:54.360 --> 2:31:56.360
 houses from

2:31:56.360 --> 2:31:58.360
 so gold for instance has

2:31:58.360 --> 2:32:00.360
 good salability as

2:32:00.360 --> 2:32:02.360
 money because it's a liquid

2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:04.360
 good it's uniform and people

2:32:04.360 --> 2:32:06.360
 are always buying it fiat

2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:08.360
 dollars have great salability because

2:32:08.360 --> 2:32:10.360
 everybody's always buying an exchanging

2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:12.360
 dollar for other goods so if you have

2:32:12.360 --> 2:32:14.360
 a hundred dollar bill you can easily

2:32:14.360 --> 2:32:16.360
 get rid of it and you'll get a hundred

2:32:16.360 --> 2:32:18.360
 dollars worth of stuff for it if you have

2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:20.360
 a hundred dollars worth of

2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:22.360
 stuff it's harder to get rid of it if you have

2:32:22.360 --> 2:32:24.360
 a hundred dollars worth of phone

2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:26.360
 it's not as easy to spend it as a hundred

2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:28.360
 dollar bill that's salability

2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:30.360
 what do you mean that

2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:32.360
 bitcoin I understand that

2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:34.360
 bitcoin has the salability of gold across time

2:32:34.360 --> 2:32:36.360
 better even yeah

2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:38.360
 better yes like on the order whatever

2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:40.360
 and then

2:32:40.360 --> 2:32:42.360
 has the salability of fiat across

2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:44.360
 space what does that mean so if you remember

2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:46.360
 when you asked me what is the advantage of fiat

2:32:46.360 --> 2:32:48.360
 what is the advantage it offers us

2:32:48.360 --> 2:32:50.360
 it's cheaper to move fiat across

2:32:50.360 --> 2:32:52.360
 space than it is to move gold

2:32:52.360 --> 2:32:54.360
 with a current fiat monetary

2:32:54.360 --> 2:32:56.360
 system for all of its flaws

2:32:56.360 --> 2:32:58.360
 you can send money

2:32:58.360 --> 2:33:00.360
 I could send money from my bank account

2:33:00.360 --> 2:33:02.360
 in the US to a bank account

2:33:02.360 --> 2:33:04.360
 in China

2:33:04.360 --> 2:33:06.360
 in a couple of days or in Britain

2:33:06.360 --> 2:33:08.360
 in France in a day or two

2:33:08.360 --> 2:33:10.360
 which is much faster than you could

2:33:10.360 --> 2:33:12.360
 do with gold and much cheaper than you could do with gold

2:33:12.360 --> 2:33:14.360
 but

2:33:14.360 --> 2:33:16.360
 in reality with fiat

2:33:16.360 --> 2:33:18.360
 the reason bitcoin improves on that is that

2:33:18.360 --> 2:33:20.360
 with bitcoin you're actually selling

2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:22.360
 you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours

2:33:22.360 --> 2:33:24.360
 so you send the bitcoin transaction

2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:26.360
 you get 6 confirmations in an hour

2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:28.360
 you get about 12 confirmations in 2 hours

2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:30.360
 on average

2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:32.360
 with 12 confirmations you know you're pretty

2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.360
 definitely

2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:36.360
 clearly safe on this

2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:38.360
 so within a couple of hours

2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:40.360
 you could send a billion dollars across the ocean

2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:42.360
 and

2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:44.360
 have final settlement on them

2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:46.360
 it's not just that you've sent a credit obligation

2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:48.360
 that's going to need weeks and months to settle

2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:50.360
 which is the case with fiat

2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.360
 so it is

2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:54.360
 faster than fiat effectively

2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:56.360
 so it's harder than gold and faster than fiat

2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:58.360
 that's a good way of putting it

2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:02.360
 one other aspect of bitcoin

2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:04.360
 I have to ask

2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:06.360
 to me on the human level it's fascinating

2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:08.360
 is it was founded

2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:10.360
 by Satoshi Nakamoto

2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:12.360
 an anonymous founder there's no leader

2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:14.360
 so that's another aspect of the decentralization

2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:16.360
 it's leaderless

2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:18.360
 so unfortunately it's not a monarchy

2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:20.360
 fortunately

2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:22.360
 or fortunately yes

2:34:22.360 --> 2:34:24.360
 who is Satoshi Nakamoto do you think

2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:26.360
 and first of all is it you

2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:28.360
 it definitely is not me

2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:30.360
 I don't know who it is

2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:32.360
 if it was would you tell me

2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:34.360
 it's a trick question

2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:36.360
 I know it's a trick question but I mean

2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:38.360
 everybody who knows me knows I can't read the code

2:34:38.360 --> 2:34:40.360
 so you would say that

2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.360
 even if you could

2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:44.360
 do you think it's one person

2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:46.360
 do you think it's multiple people

2:34:46.360 --> 2:34:48.360
 is it interesting to you do you think it's fundamental

2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:50.360
 to the coin itself

2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:52.360
 to not the coin the

2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:54.360
 the entirety of the concept

2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:56.360
 that its founder is anonymous

2:34:56.360 --> 2:34:58.360
 and how much guts do you think it takes

2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:00.360
 if it's one person to just walk away

2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:02.360
 from so much money

2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:04.360
 I've considered all these questions many times

2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:06.360
 it's very hard to formulate

2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:08.360
 a definitive answer to all of them

2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:10.360
 I don't know who it is

2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:12.360
 I don't know

2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:14.360
 why he or them

2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:16.360
 or she are not

2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:18.360
 spending the coins that they most

2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:20.360
 likely have

2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:22.360
 I think what really matters

2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:24.360
 in Bitcoin about Satoshi is the fact that he's not there

2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:26.360
 and this is what's truly

2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:28.360
 astonishing about it the fact

2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:30.360
 the most important fact in Bitcoin is the fact that

2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:32.360
 the creators disappeared and the thing

2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:34.360
 has continued to operate now for almost 12 years

2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:36.360
 without him being there or 11 years

2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:38.360
 I think it's been since he's left

2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:40.360
 and this is really the most

2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:42.360
 important thing and

2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:44.360
 maybe he died or she died

2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:46.360
 or they got into

2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:48.360
 an accident on a road trip

2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:50.360
 or whatever and that's why they haven't accessed

2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:52.360
 their coins maybe they are incapacitated

2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:54.360
 for some reason

2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:56.360
 but whatever reason it is

2:35:56.360 --> 2:35:58.360
 I really think

2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:00.360
 it's fate or serendipity

2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:02.360
 that is

2:36:02.360 --> 2:36:04.360
 giving us this very vital

2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:06.360
 very very very vital

2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:08.360
 building ingredient in Bitcoin which

2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:10.360
 no other digital currency would ever

2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:12.360
 recreate which is that

2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:14.360
 because it was the first

2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:16.360
 it was the one that was able to

2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:18.360
 establish the first mover advantage

2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:20.360
 and get all the people who are interested in the technology

2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:22.360
 to get into it

2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:24.360
 and so that's an enormous advantage but

2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:26.360
 you know the

2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:28.360
 cherry on top or what made the whole

2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:30.360
 thing really function

2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:32.360
 well is the fact that the guy who

2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:34.360
 made it disappeared and that it

2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:36.360
 continued to operate which is just

2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:38.360
 a clear illustration that this is a network

2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:40.360
 with no admins and I'm

2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:42.360
 tempted to think that they're incapacitated

2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:44.360
 in some way probably dead or gone

2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:46.360
 because I

2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:48.360
 can't believe the

2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:50.360
 I don't believe an human being would

2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:52.360
 have this level of self control

2:36:52.360 --> 2:36:54.360
 to not get into

2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:56.360
 not want to meddle with their invention

2:36:56.360 --> 2:36:58.360
 so much

2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:00.360
 even if they

2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:02.360
 they might have had the self control to like mine

2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:04.360
 the first million coins to get the network going

2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:06.360
 and then throw away the coins or

2:37:06.360 --> 2:37:08.360
 send them to an address that they don't have the key

2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:10.360
 to

2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:12.360
 because they really just wanted the network to take off

2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:14.360
 they may have no access to the coins

2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:16.360
 and that's why they can't move them I could see that

2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:18.360
 happening but I find it hard to believe

2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:20.360
 that they would resist the temptation

2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:22.360
 to mess with the network

2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:24.360
 you know it's funny I find that the founders

2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:26.360
 of ideas are often

2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:28.360
 principled and have the integrity

2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:30.360
 that the

2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:32.360
 eventual users of those ideas

2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:34.360
 don't

2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:36.360
 fully have

2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:38.360
 we have the kind of cynical view

2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:40.360
 power corrupts absolute power corrupts

2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:42.360
 absolutely and we tend to in our

2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:44.360
 mind generalize that all humans are corruptible

2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:46.360
 and perhaps

2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:48.360
 that's true to some degree but I think

2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:50.360
 some people are more corruptible than others

2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:52.360
 and I find that there is

2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:54.360
 I mean I like to think

2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:56.360
 that

2:37:56.360 --> 2:37:58.360
 Satoshi Nakamoto is out there

2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:00.360
 and you know just like George Washington

2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:02.360
 chose to walk away

2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:04.360
 and it's a principle and the principle

2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:06.360
 is more powerful than

2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:08.360
 the financial award or any of those kinds

2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:10.360
 of things

2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:12.360
 it's a principle that stands for freedom

2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:14.360
 and there's a lot of people throughout history

2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:16.360
 even recent history that are willing to die

2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:18.360
 for these principles

2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:20.360
 or live a life

2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:22.360
 full of suffering

2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:24.360
 and sacrifice because

2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:26.360
 they're still living a life

2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:28.360
 of principle and choosing that day after

2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:30.360
 day after day so

2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:32.360
 I mean there's power to that money

2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:34.360
 what's the worth of money in the end

2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:36.360
 in terms of just personal

2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:38.360
 financial gain versus

2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:40.360
 knowing

2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:42.360
 how much positive impact there is

2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:44.360
 so the person that

2:38:44.360 --> 2:38:46.360
 chooses to walk away like that

2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:48.360
 I think is the same kind of person that chooses to live

2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:52.360
 live by that principle

2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:54.360
 you have people like that

2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:56.360
 I mean

2:38:56.360 --> 2:38:58.360
 Gregori Grisha Perlman

2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:00.360
 in Mathematics who turned down the Fields Medal

2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:02.360
 because he was

2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:04.360
 yeah that's a medal not $50 billion

2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:06.360
 of Bitcoin

2:39:06.360 --> 2:39:08.360
 I know I know I'm joking

2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:10.360
 well that's actually an interesting

2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:12.360
 just a brief comment

2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:14.360
 when people talk about Bitcoin

2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:16.360
 in the cryptocurrency space

2:39:16.360 --> 2:39:18.360
 it's often mixed up

2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:20.360
 financial interest

2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:22.360
 and ideas

2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:24.360
 I think there's often correlated

2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:26.360
 but that good feeling

2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:28.360
 you get when you win

2:39:28.360 --> 2:39:30.360
 or the number go up

2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:32.360
 or you just somebody

2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:34.360
 you know I found $20 on the street

2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:36.360
 the other day

2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:38.360
 and just that feeling of just like

2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:40.360
 ooh like more money

2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:42.360
 that positive feeling

2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:44.360
 that's correlated

2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:46.360
 but it is distinct from the power of the idea

2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:48.360
 to change the world

2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:50.360
 to change the world for the better

2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:52.360
 it's like Alex Gladstein in the case of Bitcoin

2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:54.360
 that decreased the amount of suffering

2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:56.360
 in the world because of authoritarian regimes

2:39:56.360 --> 2:39:58.360
 and just because

2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:00.360
 your number goes up

2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:02.360
 like that gambling feeling of like yes

2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:04.360
 yes this is good

2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:06.360
 and I mean short term

2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:08.360
 number go up

2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:10.360
 there's a long term number go up

2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:12.360
 that's more like investment and so on

2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:14.360
 and there's a short term number go up

2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:16.360
 that's just a good feeling

2:40:16.360 --> 2:40:18.360
 that you can't you have to in your mind

2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:20.360
 from the power of the idea to transform the world

2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:22.360
 and if you focus on the power of the idea

2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:24.360
 maybe

2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:26.360
 a billion or billions of dollars

2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:28.360
 don't matter as much

2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:30.360
 at least that's what I would like to believe

2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:32.360
 perhaps but what matters ultimately

2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:34.360
 is that the thing works without him

2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:36.360
 the things worked for 11 years without him

2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:38.360
 and I think this is the really important thing

2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:40.360
 if they had stuck around

2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:42.360
 for whatever reason

2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:44.360
 and they had continued to meddle with it

2:40:44.360 --> 2:40:46.360
 it's not clear to me how decentralized

2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:48.360
 it could have been

2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:50.360
 this is the problem with the other currencies

2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:52.360
 it's like how do you

2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:54.360
 lose control of the Frankenstein that you've created

2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.360
 the only way that this Frankenstein

2:40:56.360 --> 2:40:58.360
 continues to survive is if the person in charge of it

2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:00.360
 continues to feed it

2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:02.360
 and so it continues to be yours

2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:04.360
 and that's the problem with all the other digital currencies

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:06.360
 if you've heard about any of the other 16,000

2:41:06.360 --> 2:41:08.360
 digital currencies out there

2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:10.360
 you've only heard about it because there's a small group

2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:12.360
 of people behind it that are working on it

2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:14.360
 that are promoting it

2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:16.360
 and that's why I think

2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:18.360
 Michael Saylor's discussion with you was

2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:20.360
 a magnificent illustration of

2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:22.360
 the difference between Bitcoin and

2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:24.360
 altcoins in that they are securities

2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:26.360
 and I think he makes a very compelling

2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:28.360
 brilliant case for

2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:30.360
 why this makes them

2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:32.360
 categorically different from Bitcoin

2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:34.360
 Bitcoin you're buying property

2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:36.360
 I think he mentioned he's a huge fan of

2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:38.360
 Dogecoin but I might be misremembering

2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:40.360
 you are misremembering

2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:42.360
 maybe I'm quoting him out of context

2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:44.360
 okay

2:41:44.360 --> 2:41:46.360
 let me just ask you about some

2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:48.360
 possible criticisms of Bitcoin

2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:50.360
 so on centralization

2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:52.360
 so there's a criticism

2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:54.360
 on the mining and on the

2:41:54.360 --> 2:41:56.360
 node side

2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:58.360
 or the node is not really the criticism but

2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:00.360
 Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized

2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:02.360
 because a small number of miners

2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:04.360
 control a majority

2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:06.360
 of the hashing power

2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:08.360
 I looked it up this 10,000, 15,000

2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:10.360
 whatever the number is of computers

2:42:10.360 --> 2:42:12.360
 that are full nodes

2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:14.360
 that are actively connected

2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:16.360
 to the network

2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:18.360
 so you could argue that's decentralized

2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:20.360
 because it's global, it's all across the world

2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:22.360
 but the miners

2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:24.360
 they're still

2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:26.360
 it's more centralized

2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:28.360
 so if you're thinking of making a case for Bitcoin being

2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:30.360
 decentralized

2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:32.360
 do you worry about the miners

2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:34.360
 being somewhat centralized

2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:36.360
 is the nodes the important thing to think

2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:38.360
 about

2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:40.360
 is what number of nodes counts

2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:42.360
 is centralized and not

2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:44.360
 the nodes are what matters

2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:46.360
 because the nodes are what determines

2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:48.360
 Bitcoin's consensus parameters

2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:50.360
 I think the best way

2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:52.360
 to think about it is that miners

2:42:52.360 --> 2:42:54.360
 simply sell a commodity

2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.360
 to the nodes and that commodity

2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:58.360
 is Bitcoin blocks so what a miner does

2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:00.360
 is they solve the proof of work

2:43:00.360 --> 2:43:02.360
 problem so they keep operating

2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:04.360
 their computers until they can get a solution

2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.360
 to the problem and then they attach

2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:08.360
 their transactions and present it to the nodes

2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:10.360
 for the nodes to ratify

2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:12.360
 and approve it

2:43:12.360 --> 2:43:14.360
 so therefore

2:43:14.360 --> 2:43:16.360
 I strongly recommend people learn

2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:18.360
 about the 2017 block size war

2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:20.360
 to understand

2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:22.360
 why miners don't control Bitcoin

2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:24.360
 I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard

2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:26.360
 but there's a recent book

2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:28.360
 that discusses this in detail called

2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:30.360
 the block size war by Jonathan Bier

2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:32.360
 it's a great description of

2:43:32.360 --> 2:43:34.360
 in 2017 essentially the miners

2:43:34.360 --> 2:43:36.360
 thought that they could control Bitcoin

2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:38.360
 there was

2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:40.360
 one mining company

2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:42.360
 that produced the majority of the machines

2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:44.360
 that were on the network

2:43:44.360 --> 2:43:46.360
 and their allies had

2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:48.360
 a control of the machines

2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:50.360
 that were out there

2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:52.360
 and they controlled the majority of the hash rate

2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:54.360
 and they thought that they could change Bitcoin's supply

2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:56.360
 not supply sorry

2:43:56.360 --> 2:43:58.360
 they could change Bitcoin's block size

2:43:58.360 --> 2:44:00.360
 which is a tiny little detail

2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:02.360
 technical parameters

2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:04.360
 all that big of a deal for the economics of it

2:44:04.360 --> 2:44:06.360
 but they thought that they could

2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:08.360
 pass this change

2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:10.360
 they could force this change on the network

2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:12.360
 and the members of the network

2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:14.360
 rejected it and they weren't able to

2:44:14.360 --> 2:44:16.360
 do it so

2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:18.360
 the nodes are what is sovereign

2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:20.360
 the nodes are what determine the rules of the game

2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:22.360
 the miners

2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:24.360
 are a service provider

2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:26.360
 the miners invest capital upfront

2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:28.360
 they buy the machines

2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:30.360
 they buy the electricity

2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:32.360
 they buy the locations

2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:34.360
 they pay the rent

2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:36.360
 and they invest all that money

2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:38.360
 based on the idea that if they behave

2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:40.360
 according to what the nodes want

2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:42.360
 the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin

2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:44.360
 so the miners are in no position to dictate

2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:46.360
 terms for anyone

2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:48.360
 they've put up their capital upfront

2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:50.360
 and they will only recoup it

2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:52.360
 if they do what the nodes want

2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:54.360
 so therefore what really matters

2:44:54.360 --> 2:44:56.360
 is the decentralization of the nodes

2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:58.360
 so you want to have as many nodes as possible

2:44:58.360 --> 2:45:00.360
 and you want to have a system where

2:45:00.360 --> 2:45:02.360
 there's a large number of nodes

2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:04.360
 and this is of course the biggest problem

2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:06.360
 with

2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:08.360
 with other digital currencies

2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:10.360
 because basically Bitcoin has cornered

2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:12.360
 the market on a digital currency

2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:14.360
 the only way that you can really get

2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:16.360
 traction

2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:18.360
 is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords

2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:20.360
 but we're doing this and we're doing that

2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:22.360
 and so other digital

2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:24.360
 currencies are optimized for

2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:26.360
 bells and whistles

2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:28.360
 and buzzwords

2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:30.360
 and that means adding a computational load

2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:32.360
 which makes the nodes bigger

2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:34.360
 harder to operate and therefore you have

2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:36.360
 a very small number of nodes in fact

2:45:36.360 --> 2:45:38.360
 very few digital currencies

2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:40.360
 are keen to publicize

2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:42.360
 how many nodes there are

2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:44.360
 and they don't have full nodes in the true sense

2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:46.360
 and it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have

2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:48.360
 because

2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:50.360
 de facto

2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:52.360
 you can spin up a million nodes

2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:54.360
 tomorrow on AWS

2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:56.360
 doesn't really matter

2:45:56.360 --> 2:45:58.360
 what matters is

2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:00.360
 de facto do the nodes dictate

2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:02.360
 the rules of consensus

2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:04.360
 and the fact that with most digital currencies

2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:06.360
 you can have hard forks very frequently

2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:08.360
 and they can change the supply all the time

2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:10.360
 means that there's a small group of people who agree

2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:12.360
 amongst themselves how to move forward

2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:14.360
 yeah so you threw in a few criticism

2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:16.360
 of all coins there but so one is the small group

2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:18.360
 that one we could talk about

2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:20.360
 it's a tricky one

2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:22.360
 we talked about that with Satoshi Nakamoto

2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:24.360
 but the other one is

2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:26.360
 a small number of nodes

2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:28.360
 to push back on that as computational power

2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:30.360
 increases you can argue that

2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:32.360
 that enables more and more

2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:34.360
 cheap computers to serve as

2:46:34.360 --> 2:46:36.360
 nodes so at least it paints

2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:38.360
 a future where

2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:40.360
 nodes are always increasing

2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:42.360
 because computational power is always increasing

2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:44.360
 and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper

2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:46.360
 so at least there's a hope for the future

2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:48.360
 for greater and greater decentralization

2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:50.360
 on the node front

2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:52.360
 yeah but I mean ultimately

2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:54.360
 again it doesn't really matter how many nodes

2:46:54.360 --> 2:46:56.360
 you have if you

2:46:56.360 --> 2:46:58.360
 have a you know

2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:00.360
 if the way that the currency is run is that you're gonna have

2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:02.360
 a hard fork every few months which is the case

2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:04.360
 with most other currencies bitcoins the only one

2:47:04.360 --> 2:47:06.360
 that's not have hard fork

2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:08.360
 basically the

2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:10.360
 the unique thing about bitcoin

2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:12.360
 in a technical sense is that you could get

2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:14.360
 the original software that Satoshi himself ran

2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:16.360
 in 2009

2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:18.360
 to start the network

2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:20.360
 and you could run it

2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:22.360
 today and it would sync

2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:24.360
 with the blockchain there's one bug you need to fix

2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:26.360
 one

2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:28.360
 mistake that would have only appeared

2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:30.360
 I think in around 2013 or 2014 or something like that

2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:32.360
 so that he wasn't aware of back then

2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:34.360
 so you just need to fix this one time

2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:36.360
 with a little bug and then the consensus parameters

2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.360
 are still the same so you're able to sync

2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:40.360
 to it this is not true for

2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:42.360
 most other digital currencies I'd say probably

2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:44.360
 all of them because they've all had many

2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:46.360
 hard forks which they think of as upgrades

2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:48.360
 and you know they market this

2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:50.360
 thing as you know well bitcoin can't

2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:52.360
 upgrade but we upgrade all the time

2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:54.360
 well yeah you know what else upgrades all the

2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:56.360
 time Facebook, Apple, Amazon

2:47:56.360 --> 2:47:58.360
 anything that centralizes is very

2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:00.360
 easy to upgrade and that's precisely why

2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:02.360
 as Michael Saylor says these things are

2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:04.360
 somebody's liability they are security

2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:06.360
 you're carrying on somebody's

2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:08.360
 technical and economic liability

2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:10.360
 they can hard fork

2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:12.360
 they can 10x the supply tomorrow

2:48:12.360 --> 2:48:14.360
 yeah

2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:16.360
 they can fall victim to the same

2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:20.360
 corrupting forces that governments

2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:22.360
 fall victim to sure and for

2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:24.360
 people who don't know yeah hard fork

2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:26.360
 is a

2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:28.360
 the reverse

2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:30.360
 incompatible change

2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:32.360
 to the underlying

2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:34.360
 function of a cryptocurrency

2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:36.360
 of course there is hard forks

2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:38.360
 of

2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:40.360
 bitcoin as well

2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:42.360
 I'm sure all of which you love

2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:44.360
 dearly anyway but that doesn't matter

2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:46.360
 the original bitcoin

2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:48.360
 for the most part is not undergone

2:48:48.360 --> 2:48:50.360
 any changes

2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:52.360
 I mean it has undergone changes but

2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:54.360
 none in the

2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:56.360
 important parameters of the network

2:48:56.360 --> 2:48:58.360
 so another criticism

2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:00.360
 is about energy

2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:02.360
 so the proof of

2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:04.360
 work consensus mechanism uses a lot of

2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:06.360
 energy

2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:08.360
 what's the response to that criticism of bitcoin

2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:10.360
 yes because it's worth it

2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:12.360
 okay

2:49:12.360 --> 2:49:14.360
 the airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak

2:49:14.360 --> 2:49:16.360
 you know when you're going to cross the Atlantic

2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:18.360
 next time what are you going to take a kayak

2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:20.360
 that is environmentally friendly according to this

2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:22.360
 insane definition or are you going to take

2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:24.360
 an airplane that consumes a lot of energy

2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:26.360
 so the cost benefit analysis here

2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:28.360
 essentially

2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:30.360
 you have to consider both the cost and the benefit

2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:32.360
 exactly and I think

2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:34.360
 it's an astonishing

2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:36.360
 testament to just how far backward

2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:38.360
 people's scientific

2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:40.360
 and technological

2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:42.360
 thinking has devolved to the point where we

2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:44.360
 think of energy consumption as a bad thing

2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:46.360
 I think it's just and in the fiat standard

2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:48.360
 I discussed the whole hysteria around

2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:50.360
 energy and I think it's

2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:52.360
 a product of fiat inflation

2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:54.360
 because it's a way of trying

2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:56.360
 to covering up the fact that energy

2:49:56.360 --> 2:49:58.360
 fuels that are reliable

2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:00.360
 and necessary for the current world

2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:02.360
 are becoming more and more expensive

2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:04.360
 because of inflation and so governments

2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:06.360
 are always looking for excuses for why you

2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:08.360
 should not be using those things and so

2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:10.360
 they promote all kinds of stupid pseudosciences

2:50:10.360 --> 2:50:12.360
 to tell you about

2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:14.360
 why these things are bad but really

2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:16.360
 you know all technology

2:50:16.360 --> 2:50:18.360
 is well not all but

2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:20.360
 the vast majority of technological innovations

2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:22.360
 involve

2:50:22.360 --> 2:50:24.360
 economizing on human time and judgment

2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:26.360
 and replacing it with machines with reliable

2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:28.360
 machines that spend a lot of energy

2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:30.360
 so that's what a telephone

2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:32.360
 does instead of having to send somebody

2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:34.360
 across the world to tell somebody something else

2:50:34.360 --> 2:50:36.360
 or send a letter

2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:38.360
 a telephone allows you to do it

2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:40.360
 the car is like that you could walk

2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:42.360
 but a car consumes a lot more energy

2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:44.360
 but it allows you to travel much faster

2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:46.360
 and safer and more reliably

2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:48.360
 an airplane is like that

2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:50.360
 modern telecommunication

2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:52.360
 human prosperity

2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:54.360
 is an increase in the consumption of energy

2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:56.360
 and I think it is

2:50:56.360 --> 2:50:58.360
 it is an absolutely criminal

2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:00.360
 thing and I genuinely mean the word

2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:02.360
 criminal to

2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:04.360
 portray energy consumption as a bad thing

2:51:04.360 --> 2:51:06.360
 because it is truly depriving

2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:08.360
 people of the chance to live a life that makes life better

2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:10.360
 you know and this is

2:51:10.360 --> 2:51:12.360
 it's truly criminal to tell poor countries

2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:14.360
 that they should not consume

2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:16.360
 the same energy sources that are being used in rich countries

2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:18.360
 that on which

2:51:18.360 --> 2:51:20.360
 our modern infrastructure and modern life

2:51:20.360 --> 2:51:22.360
 relies

2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:24.360
 that's what life is you know if you reduce the consumption

2:51:24.360 --> 2:51:26.360
 of energy in the US

2:51:26.360 --> 2:51:28.360
 to the levels that you have in poor countries today

2:51:28.360 --> 2:51:30.360
 the US would become desperately poor

2:51:30.360 --> 2:51:32.360
 a lot of people would die cities would collapse

2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:34.360
 the quality of life would decrease significantly

2:51:34.360 --> 2:51:36.360
 a high quality of life often requires

2:51:36.360 --> 2:51:38.360
 given the current technology

2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:40.360
 a high expenditure of energy

2:51:40.360 --> 2:51:42.360
 and I should be clear you know it's not a quality of life

2:51:42.360 --> 2:51:44.360
 in the sense that many people think of this as oh yeah

2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:46.360
 well you know

2:51:46.360 --> 2:51:48.360
 taking needless

2:51:48.360 --> 2:51:50.360
 flights for vacations

2:51:50.360 --> 2:51:52.360
 no no these are the

2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:54.360
 cherries on top of the cake but the substance

2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:56.360
 of the cake and the real benefits

2:51:56.360 --> 2:51:58.360
 of energy is the fact that

2:51:58.360 --> 2:52:00.360
 children

2:52:00.360 --> 2:52:02.360
 premature babies survive

2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:04.360
 in countries that have reliable 24 hour

2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:06.360
 cheap electricity

2:52:06.360 --> 2:52:08.360
 if your child is born premature that you put in an incubator

2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:10.360
 put him in an incubator or her

2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:12.360
 they're highly likely to survive

2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:14.360
 if you don't have 24 hour electricity

2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:16.360
 that child is not going to make it

2:52:16.360 --> 2:52:18.360
 and

2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:20.360
 you see it you know the level of energy consumption

2:52:20.360 --> 2:52:22.360
 per capita is highly correlated

2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:24.360
 not just to income but also to health

2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:26.360
 outcomes to infant mortality

2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:28.360
 to all of the things that you care about

2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:30.360
 and

2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:32.360
 bitcoin is just another technology

2:52:32.360 --> 2:52:34.360
 it does consume a lot more energy than central banks

2:52:34.360 --> 2:52:36.360
 a lot of bitcoiners like to

2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:38.360
 take a cop out of this by saying

2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:40.360
 well you know central banks consume money

2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:42.360
 and ATMs consume a lot of energy

2:52:42.360 --> 2:52:44.360
 and I think if you calculate

2:52:44.360 --> 2:52:46.360
 how much central banks and banks consume

2:52:46.360 --> 2:52:48.360
 I think it's a rounding error next to

2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:50.360
 what bitcoin consumes

2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:52.360
 I think bitcoin is just maybe not a rounding error

2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:54.360
 but it's still bitcoin I think is going to consume

2:52:54.360 --> 2:52:56.360
 a lot more and that's a good thing

2:52:56.360 --> 2:52:58.360
 you know what's humbling is to look

2:52:58.360 --> 2:53:00.360
 because even just looking into this

2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:02.360
 forces me to look at the energy expenditures

2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:04.360
 for many of the things we take for granted

2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:06.360
 obviously computers and other digital

2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:08.360
 our digital lives

2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:10.360
 just

2:53:10.360 --> 2:53:12.360
 bitcoin becomes a rounding error

2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:14.360
 relative to how much energy

2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:16.360
 spent on all the computers in our world

2:53:16.360 --> 2:53:18.360
 but also like

2:53:18.360 --> 2:53:20.360
 things like home appliances, microwaves

2:53:20.360 --> 2:53:22.360
 and hair dryers and stuff

2:53:22.360 --> 2:53:24.360
 yeah

2:53:24.360 --> 2:53:25.360
 yeah I mean this is

2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:27.360
 it does being hilarious it's like

2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:29.360
 oh these things that are just part of our

2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:31.360
 modern life

2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:33.360
 they're either the same order

2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:35.360
 at least the same order of magnitude as bitcoin

2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:37.360
 and they seem like trivial

2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:39.360
 parts of life

2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:41.360
 yeah and this is the thing all of the people that complain

2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:43.360
 about bitcoin's energy consumption

2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:45.360
 I presume they use washing machines

2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:47.360
 now why should their desire

2:53:47.360 --> 2:53:49.360
 for clean and dry

2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:51.360
 clothes

2:53:51.360 --> 2:53:53.360
 to consume energy and I mean

2:53:53.360 --> 2:53:55.360
 I used to live in Lebanon

2:53:55.360 --> 2:53:57.360
 Lebanon had hyperinflation

2:53:57.360 --> 2:53:59.360
 I escaped from hyperinflation

2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:01.360
 I prevented

2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:03.360
 my life could have been ruined by hyperinflation

2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:05.360
 and the reason that it wasn't ruined is because I have bitcoin

2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:07.360
 so

2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:09.360
 I don't know am I allowed to swear

2:54:09.360 --> 2:54:11.360
 on your podcast? yes please

2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:13.360
 so fuck your washing machine

2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:15.360
 given a choice

2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:17.360
 between my washing machine and my bitcoin

2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:19.360
 I'll choose bitcoin

2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:21.360
 the technology that has already saved my life

2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:23.360
 and I think it's going to save the lives of many

2:54:23.360 --> 2:54:25.360
 many many more people

2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:27.360
 but of course I don't have to choose

2:54:27.360 --> 2:54:29.360
 between my bitcoin

2:54:29.360 --> 2:54:31.360
 and my washing machine

2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:33.360
 because

2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:35.360
 we're just constantly consuming more energy

2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:37.360
 and we're going to continue to consume more energy in this world

2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:39.360
 and that's just what progress is

2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:41.360
 and a small remark

2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:43.360
 so in principle

2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:45.360
 I don't think this is a problem but the other thing about bitcoin

2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:47.360
 where it is different from washing machines

2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:49.360
 bitcoin is truly unique in this

2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:51.360
 it's the only thing

2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:53.360
 whose energy consumption

2:54:53.360 --> 2:54:55.360
 can be produced absolutely anywhere

2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:57.360
 your washing machine needs to be in your house

2:54:57.360 --> 2:54:59.360
 where you live and you live in a city surrounded

2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:01.360
 by 10 million people

2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:03.360
 and they all have their washing machines

2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:05.360
 and they're all connected to the grid

2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:07.360
 and they generally tend to do their laundry around the same time

2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:09.360
 and so

2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:11.360
 you have to put the load of the washing machine

2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:13.360
 on the grid

2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:15.360
 at the same time

2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:17.360
 and one power plant

2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:19.360
 and all of the infrastructure needs to work at the same time

2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:21.360
 and the electricity is pretty expensive because

2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:23.360
 it's being done in a place with high demand

2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:25.360
 bitcoin

2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:27.360
 does not need to buy electricity

2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:29.360
 from places where it has high demand

2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:31.360
 because it can buy electricity from anywhere

2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:33.360
 this is what's truly mind blowing about it

2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:35.360
 you can buy

2:55:35.360 --> 2:55:37.360
 the electricity you need for mining

2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:39.360
 can be done anywhere

2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:41.360
 so you can have a

2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.360
 waterfall in the north of Canada

2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:45.360
 300 miles away from any population center

2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:47.360
 there's water

2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:49.360
 falling, there's energy

2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:51.360
 you can put a hydroelectric dam there

2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:53.360
 and then you can use that energy to operate the miners

2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:55.360
 and then the miners just need a satellite

2:55:55.360 --> 2:55:57.360
 internet connection

2:55:57.360 --> 2:55:59.360
 and effectively you're selling that energy

2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:01.360
 that is isolated to the grid

2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:03.360
 and because of the way the bitcoin functions

2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:05.360
 because of the difficulty adjustment

2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:07.360
 the only profitable miners

2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:09.360
 are the ones who can get cheap electricity

2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:11.360
 basically if you're mining at grid

2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:13.360
 cost, if you're mining at around

2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:15.360
 the average electricity price in the world is around

2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:17.360
 14 cents

2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:19.360
 if you're mining at 14 cents in bitcoin

2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:21.360
 you're most likely not going to make it

2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.360
 if you're running your miners at 14 cents

2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:25.360
 because everybody could mine at 14 cents

2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:27.360
 and so what happens

2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:29.360
 if everybody's mining at 14 cents

2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:31.360
 14 cents stops

2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:33.360
 being profitable and then only the people

2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:35.360
 mining at a lower price are profitable

2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:37.360
 so that's why bitcoin mining

2:56:37.360 --> 2:56:39.360
 is not competing with your washing machine

2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:41.360
 and this is the absurd thing

2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:43.360
 about this kind of energy scarcity

2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:45.360
 viewpoint

2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:47.360
 where oh no it's a catastrophe

2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:49.360
 bitcoin is taking all the electricity

2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:51.360
 as if the electricity is just one fixed pie

2:56:51.360 --> 2:56:53.360
 that we all have to share and fight over

2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:55.360
 and this is how I keep making fun

2:56:55.360 --> 2:56:57.360
 of these stupid headlines they put out where

2:56:57.360 --> 2:56:59.360
 bitcoin is consuming more electricity than portugal

2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:01.360
 alright well maybe we should shut down portugal then

2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:03.360
 what the hell is portugal giving us

2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:05.360
 like obviously it's not

2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:07.360
 it's not

2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:09.360
 it doesn't mean that I've gotten so much criticism

2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:11.360
 for saying Cristiano Ronaldo

2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:13.360
 is not in the top five

2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:15.360
 I apologize

2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:17.360
 I love portugal

2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:19.360
 that's another discussion we should get into

2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:21.360
 because you posted a few soccer things

2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:23.360
 I realized how passionate people are about this

2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:25.360
 listen it was a joke

2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:27.360
 he doesn't have to be potential in the top five

2:57:27.360 --> 2:57:29.360
 yeah I love portugal

2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:31.360
 and even though I'm a Liverpool fan

2:57:31.360 --> 2:57:33.360
 I still respect Cristiano Ronaldo a lot

2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:35.360
 in fact I hold a very unpopular

2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:37.360
 opinion where I think Cristiano Ronaldo

2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:39.360
 is the greatest football player ever

2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:41.360
 number one over Pele Maradona

2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:43.360
 Messi better than Messi

2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:45.360
 yes he's been doing it for 20 years at the top

2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:47.360
 nobody's ever done that he's won everything everywhere

2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:49.360
 everywhere he goes at the top at the Champions League

2:57:49.360 --> 2:57:51.360
 really strong

2:57:51.360 --> 2:57:53.360
 argument to be made for him

2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:55.360
 Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona

2:57:55.360 --> 2:57:57.360
 that's the thing

2:57:57.360 --> 2:57:59.360
 so you appreciate performance long term

2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:01.360
 versus the genius

2:58:01.360 --> 2:58:03.360
 of the actual play on the field

2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:05.360
 I mean the genius

2:58:05.360 --> 2:58:07.360
 is Ronaldo the top scorer of all time

2:58:07.360 --> 2:58:09.360
 so the genius is in the scoring

2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:11.360
 not the actual dance

2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:13.360
 of the play the creativity

2:58:13.360 --> 2:58:15.360
 well I mean I don't know

2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:17.360
 Messi's been absolutely mediocre

2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:19.360
 since he's left Barcelona

2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:21.360
 these are strong words

2:58:21.360 --> 2:58:23.360
 he scored what two goals in PSG season this year

2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:25.360
 they're out of the Champions League

2:58:25.360 --> 2:58:27.360
 what about Muhammad Saleh

2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:29.360
 you posted

2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:31.360
 is he climbing up

2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:33.360
 I think he should win the Ballon dors this year

2:58:33.360 --> 2:58:35.360
 he probably should have won it last year as well

2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:37.360
 he's been absolutely outstanding

2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:39.360
 I mean just people are so crazy

2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:41.360
 about Messi they keep giving him accolades

2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:43.360
 he hasn't deserved I think Messi the last couple

2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:45.360
 of Ballon dors that he got

2:58:45.360 --> 2:58:47.360
 I mean he's a great player and everything

2:58:47.360 --> 2:58:49.360
 but he did not deserve it last year

2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:53.360
 we can agree to disagree

2:58:53.360 --> 2:58:55.360
 you're a Barça fan or a Messi fan

2:58:55.360 --> 2:58:57.360
 I would say

2:58:57.360 --> 2:58:59.360
 no I wouldn't say I'm a Barça fan

2:58:59.360 --> 2:59:01.360
 but Barça fan because of Messi

2:59:01.360 --> 2:59:03.360
 and I just I think it's like

2:59:03.360 --> 2:59:05.360
 there's certain things

2:59:05.360 --> 2:59:07.360
 so when I was

2:59:07.360 --> 2:59:09.360
 growing up in the Soviet Union

2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:11.360
 Russia I remember Maradona

2:59:11.360 --> 2:59:13.360
 he was the first person

2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:15.360
 I saw that

2:59:15.360 --> 2:59:17.360
 I was like oh wow this could be

2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:21.360
 this is greatness in sport not just football

2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:23.360
 in sport right and for some

2:59:23.360 --> 2:59:25.360
 reason I mean something about like

2:59:25.360 --> 2:59:27.360
 the way they were commentating

2:59:27.360 --> 2:59:29.360
 the genius of his play

2:59:29.360 --> 2:59:31.360
 the mix of ego

2:59:31.360 --> 2:59:33.360
 and again the performance but being able

2:59:33.360 --> 2:59:35.360
 to carry a team on his shoulders

2:59:35.360 --> 2:59:37.360
 that I just fell in love with

2:59:37.360 --> 2:59:39.360
 whatever he represented and then by that

2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:41.360
 Argentina and then

2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:43.360
 Messi I saw when he was like

2:59:43.360 --> 2:59:45.360
 16 17 when he was just like

2:59:45.360 --> 2:59:47.360
 in the early days and when you first

2:59:47.360 --> 2:59:49.360
 see a person and you see the genius

2:59:49.360 --> 2:59:51.360
 and you notice that and then it turns out

2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:53.360
 to be actually a great player

2:59:53.360 --> 2:59:55.360
 for some reason you're invested

2:59:55.360 --> 2:59:57.360
 you're emotionally invested

2:59:57.360 --> 2:59:59.360
 you're I don't know

2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:01.360
 so you kind of just fall in love and then

3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:03.360
 you get you pick sides

3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:05.360
 that's the thing about football part of the fun

3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:07.360
 things about football soccer

3:00:07.360 --> 3:00:09.360
 is like you pick a guy

3:00:09.360 --> 3:00:11.360
 you pick a team

3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:13.360
 and fuck everyone else and you just have fun

3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:15.360
 talking shit I mean there's part of it

3:00:15.360 --> 3:00:17.360
 it's great because

3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:19.360
 I think obviously it's a very stupid

3:00:19.360 --> 3:00:21.360
 thing to do but I think if you don't do it

3:00:21.360 --> 3:00:23.360
 in football you're gonna do it in real life

3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:25.360
 that's why it's very good

3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:27.360
 you know instead of hating people

3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:29.360
 for their religion and for their

3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:31.360
 skin color hate them because

3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:33.360
 they support Manchester United

3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:35.360
 so you're a Liverpool fan

3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:37.360
 yes yes hardcore long term

3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:39.360
 but yeah so

3:00:39.360 --> 3:00:41.360
 to go back to the original point on Portugal

3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:43.360
 energy

3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:45.360
 Bitcoin is not competing with

3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:47.360
 Portugal because Bitcoin is buying energy

3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:49.360
 from places where we can't buy it

3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:51.360
 because all the places where

3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:53.360
 we can buy energy for our washing machines

3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:55.360
 we're bidding up the price

3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:57.360
 enough to make it non viable

3:00:57.360 --> 3:00:59.360
 for Bitcoin that's why you know

3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:01.360
 you see those headlines about Bitcoin consuming

3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:03.360
 more energy than Portugal well if you look at Portugal

3:01:03.360 --> 3:01:05.360
 I mean they've got giant power plants

3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:07.360
 in Portugal they've got millions of people

3:01:07.360 --> 3:01:09.360
 and they've got enormous amounts of infrastructure

3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:11.360
 where are all these

3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:13.360
 infrastructure for Bitcoin mining

3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:15.360
 you don't see it in the cities it's

3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:17.360
 all isolated it's all out

3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:19.360
 away from the cities or it's

3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:21.360
 connected to grids that have serious overcapacity

3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:23.360
 so Bitcoin is not

3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:25.360
 out there buying the expensive energy

3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:27.360
 taking energy away from

3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:29.360
 people who can't afford it

3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:31.360
 it's out there buying its own energy because it doesn't

3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:33.360
 need to buy the expensive energy that people

3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:35.360
 really need so one other criticism

3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:37.360
 from an investment perspective

3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:39.360
 from a gambling perspective that people see

3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:41.360
 is the volatility of Bitcoin

3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:43.360
 of course has been somewhat decreasing

3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:45.360
 over time but

3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:47.360
 what's your answer to the

3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:49.360
 criticism that Bitcoin is too volatile

3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:51.360
 I want to stay away

3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:53.360
 it doesn't seem like a safe place for me to

3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:55.360
 invest

3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:57.360
 either short term or long term

3:01:57.360 --> 3:01:59.360
 there's no denying there's a volatility and there's a high

3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:01.360
 oscillation in the value in the short term so

3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:03.360
 I think the

3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:05.360
 safe way to approach that

3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:07.360
 is in terms of position sizing

3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:09.360
 if the volatility

3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:11.360
 bothers you then

3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:13.360
 you're over invested perhaps so maybe you should

3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:15.360
 maybe you should

3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:17.360
 reduce the size of your position

3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:19.360
 so that the volatility doesn't bother you

3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:21.360
 and

3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:23.360
 this is the short answer

3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:25.360
 like stack as much as

3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:27.360
 your conviction will allow you to

3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:29.360
 tolerate the volatility

3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:31.360
 but the

3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:33.360
 and of course the reason you should try and

3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:35.360
 consider tolerating the volatility

3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:37.360
 more is

3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:39.360
 the options are you hold

3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:41.360
 fiat assets which only go

3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:43.360
 down stable you know relatively

3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:45.360
 stable not a lot of volatility day to day

3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:47.360
 the value of your

3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:49.360
 dollar doesn't change 40%

3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:51.360
 overnight 20% overnight

3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:53.360
 or something like that but it does go down

3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:55.360
 reliably it's going to go down 40%

3:02:55.360 --> 3:02:57.360
 you can count on it might take a year

3:02:57.360 --> 3:02:59.360
 two years five years ten years

3:02:59.360 --> 3:03:01.360
 compared to the things that you want to buy

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.360
 it's going to go down by 40%

3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.360
 and it's not going to

3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:07.360
 come back and it's going to go down another 40%

3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:09.360
 and then another 40% and then another 40%

3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:11.360
 so the option really is

3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:13.360
 relatively short term stability

3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:15.360
 with long term decline

3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:17.360
 or short term volatility

3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:19.360
 with long term rise

3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:21.360
 and so that's another

3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:23.360
 way in which bitcoin teaches people to have a low time

3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:25.360
 preference and think about the long term so

3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:27.360
 stack accumulate and think of it

3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:29.360
 in the long term

3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:31.360
 it's a function of the fact that bitcoin is new

3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:33.360
 bitcoin is currently less than 1% of the global

3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:35.360
 money market so there's about 100 trillion

3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:37.360
 dollars of money out there in the world

3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:39.360
 100 trillion

3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:41.360
 dollars roughly of fiat and about 10 trillion

3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:43.360
 dollars of gold and bitcoin

3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:45.360
 is less than 1 trillion dollars so

3:03:45.360 --> 3:03:47.360
 you know one rich guy decides to

3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:49.360
 get into bitcoin that's going to show up on

3:03:49.360 --> 3:03:51.360
 the bitcoin chart you look at it you know

3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:53.360
 Elon Musk decides to buy bitcoin you see

3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:55.360
 the buy you know you see the news it

3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:57.360
 happens and you see the pump

3:03:57.360 --> 3:03:59.360
 Elon Musk decides that he doesn't like

3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:01.360
 bitcoin you see the drop but

3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:03.360
 you know a few years ago it used to be that

3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:05.360
 one random millionaire

3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:07.360
 would cause that pump

3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:09.360
 and now you have to be the richest guy in the world

3:04:09.360 --> 3:04:11.360
 to do that in a few years

3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:13.360
 you're going to have to be the richest country in the world

3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:15.360
 to be able to do that to the bitcoin price

3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:17.360
 maybe many years maybe not a few years

3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:19.360
 but as bitcoin grows you know think about it

3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:21.360
 as a liquid pool of

3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:23.360
 money currently it's a small

3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:25.360
 pool next to a much larger ocean

3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:27.360
 which is the entire money market and so

3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:29.360
 one person jumps from

3:04:29.360 --> 3:04:31.360
 that to this small pool they can make a big

3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:33.360
 splash as the pool grows

3:04:33.360 --> 3:04:35.360
 essentially the salability increases

3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:37.360
 and the likelihood

3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:39.360
 of one individual purchase affecting the

3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:41.360
 price so violently increases

3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:43.360
 decreases and so

3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:45.360
 over time you know as the size

3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:47.360
 of the market increases I think

3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:49.360
 we're going to see the volatility decline more and more

3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:51.360
 ultimately what

3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:53.360
 you know if you look at gold historically gold has been

3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:55.360
 very very stable it did not

3:04:55.360 --> 3:04:57.360
 achieve its stability because the central bank

3:04:57.360 --> 3:04:59.360
 was in charge of gold supply or because there was

3:04:59.360 --> 3:05:01.360
 a gold committee that decided

3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:03.360
 how much gold gets produced

3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:05.360
 it achieved that stability

3:05:05.360 --> 3:05:07.360
 because it became the most

3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:09.360
 saleable good and so therefore became the

3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:11.360
 good that contains the most cash balances

3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:13.360
 in the world and the end of

3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:15.360
 the 19th century everybody held cash balances

3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:17.360
 in gold and

3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:19.360
 new production was a tiny little

3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:21.360
 addition to

3:05:21.360 --> 3:05:23.360
 global production to the supply

3:05:23.360 --> 3:05:25.360
 so that's what made gold the most

3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:27.360
 relatively I shouldn't say

3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:29.360
 stable because nothing is stable in economics

3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:31.360
 but relatively it holds on to its value

3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:33.360
 and it's much less volatile

3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:35.360
 than digital currency than

3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:37.360
 national currencies that's because

3:05:37.360 --> 3:05:39.360
 it has the

3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:41.360
 highest stock to flow ratio

3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:43.360
 and that's because its supply

3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:45.360
 is a tiny

3:05:45.360 --> 3:05:47.360
 fraction of the liquid market

3:05:47.360 --> 3:05:49.360
 as the liquid market grows as the size

3:05:49.360 --> 3:05:51.360
 of cash balances grows and trades in bitcoin

3:05:51.360 --> 3:05:53.360
 cancel each other out

3:05:53.360 --> 3:05:55.360
 you get

3:05:55.360 --> 3:05:57.360
 only slight changes in value so I think

3:05:57.360 --> 3:05:59.360
 as bitcoin matures

3:05:59.360 --> 3:06:01.360
 that's going to decline

3:06:01.360 --> 3:06:03.360
 so effectively I think the end

3:06:03.360 --> 3:06:05.360
 game is bitcoin is

3:06:05.360 --> 3:06:07.360
 huge

3:06:07.360 --> 3:06:09.360
 bitcoin is worth something like

3:06:09.360 --> 3:06:11.360
 I think the total addressable market for bitcoin

3:06:11.360 --> 3:06:13.360
 is not just national

3:06:13.360 --> 3:06:15.360
 currencies and gold's addressable market

3:06:15.360 --> 3:06:17.360
 but also government bonds that's the really big one

3:06:17.360 --> 3:06:19.360
 so how do banks

3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:21.360
 compare to gold so you're saying it'll surpass

3:06:21.360 --> 3:06:23.360
 gold with the 10 trillion

3:06:23.360 --> 3:06:25.360
 what's bonds

3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:27.360
 where's bonds stand

3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:29.360
 and there's also national currencies which are about

3:06:29.360 --> 3:06:31.360
 100 trillion and there's government bonds

3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:33.360
 which are around 120 billion

3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:35.360
 dollars

3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:37.360
 sorry trillion dollars trillion

3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:39.360
 trillion sorry if we're saying

3:06:39.360 --> 3:06:41.360
 billion we meant trillion

3:06:41.360 --> 3:06:43.360
 so you think

3:06:43.360 --> 3:06:45.360
 bonds can move to bitcoin

3:06:45.360 --> 3:06:47.360
 I've always held

3:06:47.360 --> 3:06:49.360
 this is the prize this is the main

3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:51.360
 dish and gold is the appetizer

3:06:51.360 --> 3:06:53.360
 bonds are the main dish because bonds

3:06:53.360 --> 3:06:55.360
 are full of gold

3:06:55.360 --> 3:06:57.360
 yeah I mean

3:06:57.360 --> 3:06:59.360
 bonds have replaced gold in people's

3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:01.360
 portfolio people remember when we were saying gold

3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:03.360
 was you'd held it

3:07:03.360 --> 3:07:05.360
 as a saving as the secure part of your portfolio

3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:07.360
 and then you take risk with the equity

3:07:07.360 --> 3:07:09.360
 currently people do that by holding

3:07:09.360 --> 3:07:11.360
 a part of their portfolio in bonds

3:07:11.360 --> 3:07:13.360
 that's the part that they treat as their

3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:15.360
 saving account and then the rest

3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:17.360
 they use for

3:07:17.360 --> 3:07:19.360
 not speculation for investment in which they take

3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:21.360
 risk yes speculation

3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:23.360
 and that's stocks and equity

3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:25.360
 and other high risk

3:07:25.360 --> 3:07:27.360
 assets

3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:29.360
 I think bitcoin is not going to replace equity

3:07:29.360 --> 3:07:31.360
 there will always be equity there will always be

3:07:31.360 --> 3:07:33.360
 companies and people who want to have equity

3:07:33.360 --> 3:07:35.360
 but it will probably replace a big chunk

3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:37.360
 of current equity markets because right now

3:07:37.360 --> 3:07:39.360
 if you want to save

3:07:39.360 --> 3:07:41.360
 it used to be that you hold bonds now if you want to save

3:07:41.360 --> 3:07:43.360
 you go into stock indexes

3:07:43.360 --> 3:07:45.360
 so I think bitcoin likely eats

3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:47.360
 a big chunk of equity markets

3:07:47.360 --> 3:07:49.360
 because currently

3:07:49.360 --> 3:07:51.360
 people are using it as saving

3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:53.360
 they could eat all the bonds

3:07:53.360 --> 3:07:55.360
 that's my most

3:07:55.360 --> 3:07:57.360
 ambitious statement

3:07:57.360 --> 3:07:59.360
 the question is the scale of

3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:01.360
 time that happens across but the most

3:08:01.360 --> 3:08:03.360
 important statement you're making is about trend

3:08:03.360 --> 3:08:05.360
 yeah and also I mean let's also remember

3:08:05.360 --> 3:08:07.360
 currently bonds

3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:09.360
 nominally don't beat inflation and in real

3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:11.360
 terms they

3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:13.360
 don't come close to beating inflation

3:08:13.360 --> 3:08:15.360
 so

3:08:15.360 --> 3:08:17.360
 currently with bonds you're taking on credit

3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:19.360
 default risk to buy a bond

3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:21.360
 and also

3:08:21.360 --> 3:08:23.360
 getting less money back in real terms

3:08:23.360 --> 3:08:25.360
 well bitcoin doesn't offer you returns

3:08:25.360 --> 3:08:27.360
 but in real terms it appreciates

3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:29.360
 much more and it has I believe

3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:31.360
 a lot less risk associated with it than

3:08:31.360 --> 3:08:33.360
 any company or government

3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:35.360
 so let's make things spicy

3:08:35.360 --> 3:08:37.360
 and ask if bitcoin

3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:39.360
 fails in the long term future

3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:41.360
 as all you just said

3:08:41.360 --> 3:08:43.360
 economics, volatility

3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:45.360
 things happen in this world but the human civilization

3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:47.360
 might end in this century

3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:49.360
 I hope it doesn't but it might

3:08:49.360 --> 3:08:51.360
 there could be catastrophic events

3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:53.360
 if bitcoin fails

3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:55.360
 it goes to zero loses its number one

3:08:55.360 --> 3:08:57.360
 spot

3:08:57.360 --> 3:08:59.360
 what would be the reason if you're

3:08:59.360 --> 3:09:01.360
 an alien visiting earth

3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:03.360
 100 years from now and just

3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:05.360
 were to analyze the situation

3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:07.360
 bitcoin is a pretty new thing

3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:09.360
 so the possible trajectories of how the world

3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:11.360
 evolves together with this new monetary

3:09:11.360 --> 3:09:13.360
 technology is

3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:15.360
 nearly infinite so if it fails

3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:17.360
 one of those trajectories surely

3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:19.360
 involves bitcoin failing

3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:21.360
 what would be the reason

3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:23.360
 I think the most likely reason that it could fail

3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:25.360
 I don't think this is likely in general

3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:27.360
 but I think it is the most likely of

3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:29.360
 all the unlikely things that could destroy

3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:31.360
 bitcoin is

3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:33.360
 governments go back on a gold standard

3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:37.360
 so they make in your view

3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:39.360
 a better decision than the current system

3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:41.360
 just not the best decision

3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:43.360
 I thought you would go much

3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:45.360
 darker

3:09:45.360 --> 3:09:47.360
 so that's okay interesting

3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:49.360
 so maybe because of Russia because of China

3:09:49.360 --> 3:09:51.360
 and so on because the current war

3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:53.360
 they might reconsider

3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:55.360
 the

3:09:55.360 --> 3:09:57.360
 power that America holds

3:09:57.360 --> 3:09:59.360
 because of the monetary

3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:01.360
 because of being the primary currency and they'll

3:10:01.360 --> 3:10:03.360
 start thinking about going

3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:05.360
 on a gold standard

3:10:05.360 --> 3:10:07.360
 yeah but it would also require the US

3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:09.360
 and the Europeans and everybody to want to join

3:10:09.360 --> 3:10:11.360
 in this system and sing kumbaya

3:10:11.360 --> 3:10:13.360
 and play nice with each other

3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:15.360
 around the gold standard

3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:17.360
 I think you know given that gold already

3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:19.360
 is about 10 times larger than bitcoin

3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:21.360
 so it has a first mover advantage

3:10:23.360 --> 3:10:25.360
 if governments were to go and peg their

3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:27.360
 currencies to gold again the price of gold

3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:29.360
 would shoot up

3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:31.360
 5, 10x

3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:33.360
 and it would rise in value a lot more

3:10:33.360 --> 3:10:35.360
 of course that doesn't necessarily kill bitcoin

3:10:35.360 --> 3:10:37.360
 no again I'm not saying it's likely to

3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:39.360
 happen I'm saying it's

3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:41.360
 I imagine less likely

3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:43.360
 less unlikely than

3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:45.360
 all the other unlikely scenarios because

3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:47.360
 even with a nuclear war

3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:49.360
 like 90%

3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:51.360
 of the planet is destroyed the 10%

3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:53.360
 continue to run bitcoin

3:10:55.360 --> 3:10:57.360
 there's a quote

3:10:57.360 --> 3:10:59.360
 okay there's a movement

3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:01.360
 a community of people referred to as

3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:03.360
 bitcoin maximalists

3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:05.360
 I've seen you referred at least in the past

3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:07.360
 as the leader

3:11:07.360 --> 3:11:09.360
 of the bitcoin maximalist

3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:11.360
 probably because of your

3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:13.360
 book you know bitcoin standard

3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:15.360
 consider the bible in general you're one of the

3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:17.360
 leaders in this space

3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:19.360
 do you regret

3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:21.360
 any of the toxicity and

3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:23.360
 derision that often

3:11:23.360 --> 3:11:25.360
 or perhaps sometimes originates

3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:27.360
 from this community

3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:29.360
 definitely not I'm not

3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:31.360
 in the position to regret other people's actions

3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:33.360
 so let's just be clear

3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:35.360
 I think the rhetoric of community

3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:37.360
 is

3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:39.360
 I reject this rhetoric because I think it's

3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:41.360
 it's a way for

3:11:41.360 --> 3:11:43.360
 kind of political manipulation

3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:45.360
 and subversion

3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:47.360
 to try and

3:11:47.360 --> 3:11:49.360
 portray people as part of a community

3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:51.360
 and hold people responsible for other people's

3:11:51.360 --> 3:11:53.360
 actions which I think is ridiculous

3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:55.360
 so if you know some guy on the internet

3:11:55.360 --> 3:11:57.360
 said something mean to somebody

3:11:57.360 --> 3:11:59.360
 and then this is very common

3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:01.360
 and it's I always try and

3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:03.360
 not get involved in these things

3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:05.360
 so some guy who identifies as a bitcoiner

3:12:05.360 --> 3:12:07.360
 says something to somebody that's very wrong

3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:09.360
 of course it happens

3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:11.360
 tens of millions of people

3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:13.360
 use bitcoin around the world

3:12:13.360 --> 3:12:15.360
 and a lot of these I'd say

3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:17.360
 parasites you know people who don't have

3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:19.360
 anything productive to do with their life

3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:21.360
 you know outrage merchants

3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:23.360
 they'll come out and say something

3:12:23.360 --> 3:12:25.360
 along the lines of you know the bitcoin

3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:27.360
 maximalists are

3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:29.360
 toxic they're holding bitcoin back and

3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:31.360
 they need and of course it's manipulative

3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:33.360
 but the point behind it is they want to get

3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:35.360
 to you to they want to get people

3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:37.360
 who are you know not that nobody

3:12:37.360 --> 3:12:39.360
 with 300 followers who said something

3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:41.360
 silly they want to get the notable

3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:43.360
 people to

3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:45.360
 basically change their message so the idea

3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:47.360
 is you know I'm supposed to

3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:49.360
 apologize because somebody with 300 followers

3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:51.360
 I've never met in my life who calls

3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:53.360
 themselves a bitcoiner said a mean word

3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:55.360
 and then I need I need to apologize

3:12:55.360 --> 3:12:57.360
 and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric

3:12:57.360 --> 3:12:59.360
 about other digital currencies

3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:01.360
 I need to do that so

3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:03.360
 I'm only responsible for my own actions

3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:05.360
 and I don't

3:13:05.360 --> 3:13:07.360
 recall regretting anything

3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:09.360
 okay but let me push back or push further

3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:11.360
 into that direction fine let's see

3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:13.360
 community aside labels suck

3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:15.360
 for sure but you have

3:13:15.360 --> 3:13:17.360
 a spicy way

3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:19.360
 about you on Twitter

3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:21.360
 even in this conversation

3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:23.360
 you know you had some

3:13:23.360 --> 3:13:25.360
 some good strong words

3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:27.360
 I've always believed

3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:29.360
 life is too short to mean words

3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:31.360
 one day I'm gonna be dead and

3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:33.360
 on my deathbed I'm not gonna

3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:35.360
 look back and say

3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:37.360
 I wish I was a little bit more

3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:39.360
 circumspect in expressing my opinions

3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:41.360
 I'm far more likely to think you know what

3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:43.360
 I wish I said what I really think

3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:45.360
 yes life is too

3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:47.360
 short to hold back your opinion

3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:49.360
 the question is what is

3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:51.360
 really your opinion because you're

3:13:51.360 --> 3:13:53.360
 you're many

3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:55.360
 people in one

3:13:55.360 --> 3:13:57.360
 so there's a person that loves

3:13:57.360 --> 3:13:59.360
 there's kindness for the human beings

3:13:59.360 --> 3:14:01.360
 there's a person that gets annoyed

3:14:01.360 --> 3:14:03.360
 there's a person that

3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:05.360
 enjoys this agreement

3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:07.360
 there's a person that enjoys collaboration

3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:09.360
 and you can emphasize all of those different things

3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:11.360
 each of those different things

3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:13.360
 weigh it differently in your online interaction

3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:15.360
 there's some aspects of

3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:17.360
 online interaction that encourages

3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:19.360
 in different communities

3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:21.360
 online interaction is one community

3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:23.360
 that encourages kind of derision

3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:25.360
 mockery and so on so you get

3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:27.360
 you can choose if you want to engage that part of yourself

3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:29.360
 or some other part of yourself

3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:31.360
 economics is another community

3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:33.360
 that enjoys

3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:35.360
 being like

3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:37.360
 very straightforward about their disagreements

3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:39.360
 pretty harsh it's fun to

3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:41.360
 watch because it feels like you arrive

3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:43.360
 at the truth much faster

3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:45.360
 because you tear each other apart

3:14:45.360 --> 3:14:47.360
 but

3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:49.360
 you know that's a choice that's a deliberate

3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:51.360
 choice and I don't want

3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:53.360
 to label an entire community

3:14:53.360 --> 3:14:55.360
 of people by its extremes

3:14:55.360 --> 3:14:57.360
 I don't think you should do that but there's cultural

3:14:57.360 --> 3:14:59.360
 characteristics you start to notice

3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:01.360
 when you go to France it's a certain way

3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:03.360
 when you go to Britain London is different

3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:05.360
 than rural Britain

3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:07.360
 and New York is different than

3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:09.360
 Iowa you start to notice things

3:15:09.360 --> 3:15:11.360
 I mean you don't want to generalize there's all kinds

3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:13.360
 of people everywhere but

3:15:13.360 --> 3:15:15.360
 there's a certain way of communication

3:15:15.360 --> 3:15:17.360
 on crypto twitter in general

3:15:17.360 --> 3:15:19.360
 but also bitcoin maximus

3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:21.360
 that I even early on received a bunch

3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:23.360
 of heat so what the hell

3:15:23.360 --> 3:15:25.360
 so listen

3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:27.360
 there's definitely a difference

3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:29.360
 when I go to the computer science community

3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:31.360
 machine learning community

3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:33.360
 it's way friendlier than the crypto

3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:35.360
 currency community

3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:37.360
 I have much more freedom to actually

3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:39.360
 be what I

3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:41.360
 enjoy being which is

3:15:41.360 --> 3:15:43.360
 asking simple dumb questions even when

3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:45.360
 I've already spent years sometimes

3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:47.360
 decades with an idea I like asking dumb

3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:49.360
 questions anyway

3:15:49.360 --> 3:15:51.360
 crypto folks punish you for this

3:15:51.360 --> 3:15:53.360
 for curiosity

3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:55.360
 for

3:15:55.360 --> 3:15:57.360
 like exploration I understand the mechanism

3:15:57.360 --> 3:15:59.360
 because so many other people come

3:15:59.360 --> 3:16:01.360
 into that community and they might

3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:03.360
 masquerade

3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:05.360
 as curious but really they're trying to

3:16:05.360 --> 3:16:07.360
 inject they're trying to sell some kind

3:16:07.360 --> 3:16:09.360
 of all coin there's some scheme

3:16:09.360 --> 3:16:11.360
 there's some scheme to make money and so

3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:13.360
 I understand maybe that's just the dynamics

3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:15.360
 of the community by nature it's not like

3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:17.360
 you respond

3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:19.360
 appropriately to the amount

3:16:19.360 --> 3:16:21.360
 of charlatans

3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:23.360
 in the community so if the

3:16:23.360 --> 3:16:25.360
 fraction of charlatans is low

3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:27.360
 maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind

3:16:27.360 --> 3:16:29.360
 and so on and when the fraction

3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:31.360
 of charlatans is high you have to be

3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:33.360
 harsher perhaps

3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:35.360
 perhaps but I think

3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:37.360
 also you know the stakes are extremely high

3:16:37.360 --> 3:16:39.360
 in this situation and I think you know if you don't

3:16:39.360 --> 3:16:41.360
 like bitcoiners if you think bitcoiners

3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:43.360
 are toxic wait till you meet fiaters

3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:45.360
 the fiat the community

3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:47.360
 has financed

3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:49.360
 world wars and genocides

3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:51.360
 and the tyrants

3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:53.360
 and the mass death and destruction

3:16:53.360 --> 3:16:55.360
 the fiat community

3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:57.360
 if you want to use that term I don't believe

3:16:57.360 --> 3:16:59.360
 you should but I mean you know fiat

3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:01.360
 has destroyed the savings of pretty much

3:17:01.360 --> 3:17:03.360
 anybody who's lived through the last

3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:05.360
 20th century pretty much anybody who's lived through

3:17:05.360 --> 3:17:07.360
 the 20th century no matter where you lived

3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:09.360
 Switzerland, US, Ethiopia, Russia

3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:11.360
 you've gone through

3:17:11.360 --> 3:17:13.360
 fiat problems you've had hyperinflation

3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:15.360
 you've had bank confiscation

3:17:15.360 --> 3:17:17.360
 there isn't a family in the world today

3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:19.360
 that hasn't had its wealth destroyed

3:17:19.360 --> 3:17:21.360
 over the last century you know

3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:23.360
 they all have a story about

3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:25.360
 inflation and the hyperinflation

3:17:25.360 --> 3:17:27.360
 and bitcoin offers us a way out of this

3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:29.360
 and

3:17:29.360 --> 3:17:31.360
 shitcoins, altcoins

3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:33.360
 are essentially fiat worlds

3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:35.360
 last

3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:37.360
 gasp attempt to try and

3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:39.360
 salvage fiat

3:17:39.360 --> 3:17:41.360
 to try and salvage the idea that some people

3:17:41.360 --> 3:17:43.360
 will continue to be able to print money

3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:45.360
 and other people will have to use that money

3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:47.360
 you know

3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:49.360
 this is twitter it's a free market

3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:51.360
 it's the internet you don't have to follow

3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:53.360
 anybody that's the thing like so

3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:55.360
 what I found really

3:17:55.360 --> 3:17:57.360
 objectionable about the people

3:17:57.360 --> 3:17:59.360
 who are so butt hurt always

3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:01.360
 about bitcoin maximus is

3:18:01.360 --> 3:18:03.360
 you don't have to click follow on people

3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:05.360
 you don't like there are 300 million twitter

3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:07.360
 accounts and

3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:09.360
 if you choose to follow the accounts

3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:11.360
 that say things that annoy you

3:18:11.360 --> 3:18:13.360
 and then complain about the fact that

3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:15.360
 they say things that annoy you

3:18:15.360 --> 3:18:17.360
 I'm sorry but you're an idiot that you don't know how to

3:18:17.360 --> 3:18:19.360
 use twitter just follow

3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:21.360
 the accounts that you like it's

3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:23.360
 you know you don't have to

3:18:23.360 --> 3:18:25.360
 be part of this you don't have to listen to those people

3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:27.360
 you can choose there are a lot of bitcoiners

3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:29.360
 that don't act like this you can just unfollow

3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:31.360
 the ones that you like and vlog

3:18:31.360 --> 3:18:33.360
 since in the past year man time flies

3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:35.360
 I've met a lot of them

3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:37.360
 and enjoy them a lot and you build that community

3:18:37.360 --> 3:18:39.360
 of people that you enjoy there are lots

3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:41.360
 that communicate in the way you enjoy

3:18:41.360 --> 3:18:43.360
 and it's become a meme at this point

3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:45.360
 that I block would love I think

3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:47.360
 because I did not

3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:49.360
 I block very prolifically and I strongly

3:18:49.360 --> 3:18:51.360
 recommend people continue to block

3:18:51.360 --> 3:18:53.360
 I think twitter is you know you're not going to

3:18:53.360 --> 3:18:55.360
 get to interact with 300 million accounts anyway

3:18:55.360 --> 3:18:57.360
 so you want to be constantly curating

3:18:57.360 --> 3:18:59.360
 the experience by getting rid of people

3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:01.360
 you don't like and

3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:03.360
 following people that you like and that's just

3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:05.360
 you know after 10 years of using twitter

3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:07.360
 you know you get you accumulate

3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:09.360
 the block list which is very big which I'm very

3:19:09.360 --> 3:19:11.360
 happy for and I'm going to pass on to my children

3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:15.360
 on your deathbed

3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:17.360
 the grandchildren will gather around

3:19:17.360 --> 3:19:19.360
 and your grandfather can finally

3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:21.360
 share the

3:19:21.360 --> 3:19:23.360
 full list so

3:19:23.360 --> 3:19:25.360
 again it's just a twitter account

3:19:25.360 --> 3:19:27.360
 if it bothers you so much ask yourself

3:19:27.360 --> 3:19:29.360
 why it bothers you that some people are so

3:19:29.360 --> 3:19:31.360
 I'm not referring to you obviously

3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:33.360
 but I mean the people that are constantly

3:19:33.360 --> 3:19:35.360
 aggravated about this I don't get

3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:37.360
 bothered by anything on twitter I just block

3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:39.360
 immediately and I get to

3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:41.360
 curate the experience that I enjoy and I

3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:43.360
 recommend people do that

3:19:43.360 --> 3:19:45.360
 it's really a lot less pathetic

3:19:45.360 --> 3:19:47.360
 than complaining about strangers saying

3:19:47.360 --> 3:19:49.360
 things you don't like which a lot of

3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:51.360
 and of course the reason for it is

3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:53.360
 you know I mean when I say

3:19:53.360 --> 3:19:55.360
 it's stupid it's not really stupid there's

3:19:55.360 --> 3:19:57.360
 an ulterior motive there and the ulterior motive

3:19:57.360 --> 3:19:59.360
 is hey I have this shit coin that I made

3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:01.360
 with five other friends of mine

3:20:01.360 --> 3:20:03.360
 and I'd like you to I'd like to

3:20:03.360 --> 3:20:05.360
 write your coattails bit coiners and I'd

3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:07.360
 like you to please help me promote this shit coin

3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:09.360
 like this is I get this practically

3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:11.360
 every week whether through email

3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:13.360
 or through twitter where hey you know

3:20:13.360 --> 3:20:15.360
 this is our shit coin

3:20:15.360 --> 3:20:17.360
 you know it's just like bitcoin but

3:20:17.360 --> 3:20:19.360
 it's better because it does this and this and that

3:20:19.360 --> 3:20:21.360
 and you know basically

3:20:21.360 --> 3:20:23.360
 how can we get you to promote this shit

3:20:23.360 --> 3:20:25.360
 coin for us and

3:20:25.360 --> 3:20:27.360
 being straightforward and forthright is

3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:29.360
 a great productivity

3:20:29.360 --> 3:20:31.360
 hack because

3:20:31.360 --> 3:20:33.360
 you just tell those people no I'm not interested

3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:35.360
 it's a stupid shit coin and I wish you quick and

3:20:35.360 --> 3:20:37.360
 swift failure before you take a lot of

3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:39.360
 people's money

3:20:39.360 --> 3:20:41.360
 and that's what I genuinely think

3:20:41.360 --> 3:20:43.360
 well but I'll just be upfront

3:20:43.360 --> 3:20:45.360
 with the fact at least for my taste

3:20:45.360 --> 3:20:47.360
 just labeling everything

3:20:47.360 --> 3:20:49.360
 as a shit coin

3:20:49.360 --> 3:20:51.360
 worries me so this is

3:20:51.360 --> 3:20:53.360
 my own preference it's not a judgment on you

3:20:53.360 --> 3:20:55.360
 it's just my own preference that

3:20:55.360 --> 3:20:57.360
 I'm afraid I'll miss good ideas

3:20:57.360 --> 3:20:59.360
 I think when you're me personally

3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:01.360
 when I'm too certain about things

3:21:01.360 --> 3:21:03.360
 when I am too tribal about

3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:05.360
 things I'll miss actually

3:21:05.360 --> 3:21:07.360
 really strong ideas outlier ideas

3:21:07.360 --> 3:21:09.360
 totally new ideas

3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:11.360
 so that that worries me one of the

3:21:11.360 --> 3:21:13.360
 downsides

3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:15.360
 of the way bitcoin

3:21:15.360 --> 3:21:17.360
 is how much is at stake

3:21:17.360 --> 3:21:19.360
 financially is that it's

3:21:19.360 --> 3:21:21.360
 less open to good actually by

3:21:21.360 --> 3:21:23.360
 design that it's not changing

3:21:23.360 --> 3:21:25.360
 like with the hard forks and so on

3:21:25.360 --> 3:21:27.360
 that there's not a kind of

3:21:27.360 --> 3:21:29.360
 curiosity but exploration of ideas

3:21:29.360 --> 3:21:31.360
 of course

3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:33.360
 in some way that

3:21:33.360 --> 3:21:35.360
 curiosity can start getting injected

3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:37.360
 when you start talking about other layers

3:21:37.360 --> 3:21:39.360
 built on top of bitcoin

3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:41.360
 you start talking about applications or different

3:21:41.360 --> 3:21:43.360
 things like lightning network

3:21:43.360 --> 3:21:45.360
 that's where the curiosity can emerge

3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:47.360
 but still that's why with

3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:49.360
 cryptocurrency in general I just tried to keep an open mind

3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:51.360
 and just the shit coin

3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:53.360
 as a term is just like a statement

3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:55.360
 that I'm going to close my mind to it

3:21:55.360 --> 3:21:57.360
 that's the way I hear it

3:21:57.360 --> 3:21:59.360
 but coming out of your mouth

3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:01.360
 because you say a lot of other IG stuff

3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:03.360
 it's just more you having fun

3:22:03.360 --> 3:22:05.360
 that's the way I hear but if I said something like that

3:22:05.360 --> 3:22:07.360
 that's a I feel like

3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:09.360
 I would feel like I'm closing my mind

3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:11.360
 I mean let me give you the counter argument to that

3:22:11.360 --> 3:22:13.360
 how much time do you spend emailing back

3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:15.360
 all of these Nigerian Prince email scams

3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:17.360
 that you know email you tell you

3:22:17.360 --> 3:22:19.360
 send me $5,000 and I'll send you $15 million

3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:21.360
 none

3:22:21.360 --> 3:22:23.360
 why are you being closed minded to all of these great ideas

3:22:23.360 --> 3:22:25.360
 no but I'm also

3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:27.360
 you know maybe one of them will actually

3:22:27.360 --> 3:22:29.360
 send you $15 million

3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:31.360
 but I don't know if I know the difference between the Nigerian Prince

3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:33.360
 and many other people

3:22:33.360 --> 3:22:35.360
 I do talk to who are colleagues and so on

3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:37.360
 that are also emailing me

3:22:37.360 --> 3:22:39.360
 and they're also offering me things

3:22:39.360 --> 3:22:41.360
 but they don't sound as ridiculously spammy

3:22:41.360 --> 3:22:43.360
 yeah but I mean the moment

3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:45.360
 that somebody tells you hey I'm going to give you $15 million

3:22:45.360 --> 3:22:47.360
 for nothing just if you send me $5,000

3:22:47.360 --> 3:22:49.360
 you know you're getting something for nothing

3:22:49.360 --> 3:22:51.360
 and essentially with all the

3:22:51.360 --> 3:22:53.360
 digital currencies it's the same pitch

3:22:53.360 --> 3:22:55.360
 hey hey you know come

3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:57.360
 use this thing that will allow you to do

3:22:57.360 --> 3:22:59.360
 things that all of the things that they

3:22:59.360 --> 3:23:01.360
 pretend that they can do they can be done with

3:23:01.360 --> 3:23:03.360
 computers without having digital currencies

3:23:03.360 --> 3:23:05.360
 you know we already have AWS that does

3:23:05.360 --> 3:23:07.360
 cloud computing that does everything that

3:23:07.360 --> 3:23:09.360
 shitcoins pretend to do

3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:11.360
 the only difference is AWS doesn't have its own

3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:13.360
 monetary system tacked on top of it

3:23:13.360 --> 3:23:15.360
 to allow Jeff Bezos to basically

3:23:15.360 --> 3:23:17.360
 print his own money

3:23:17.360 --> 3:23:19.360
 but don't you think there's some gray area

3:23:19.360 --> 3:23:21.360
 so let me let me go for the historical record

3:23:21.360 --> 3:23:23.360
 and let's see if you've changed

3:23:23.360 --> 3:23:25.360
 as a

3:23:25.360 --> 3:23:27.360
 philosopher, economist, human being

3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:29.360
 you tweeted three years ago

3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:31.360
 oh well

3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:33.360
 anyone who believes proof of stake can work

3:23:33.360 --> 3:23:35.360
 is either one completely clueless

3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:37.360
 at how and why bitcoin works at all

3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:39.360
 or two

3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:41.360
 a con artist using it as a buzzword

3:23:41.360 --> 3:23:43.360
 to promote a worthless scam like Ethereum

3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:45.360
 do you still believe

3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:47.360
 that

3:23:47.360 --> 3:23:49.360
 Ethereum is a scam

3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:51.360
 and in general proof of stake

3:23:51.360 --> 3:23:53.360
 you either clueless

3:23:53.360 --> 3:23:55.360
 if you think it's interesting

3:23:55.360 --> 3:23:57.360
 yeah no I still stand by that

3:23:57.360 --> 3:23:59.360
 I think the

3:23:59.360 --> 3:24:01.360
 would you classify Ethereum as a shitcoin

3:24:01.360 --> 3:24:03.360
 for sure it's the mother

3:24:03.360 --> 3:24:05.360
 asshole from which the shitcoins spring

3:24:05.360 --> 3:24:07.360
 the royal the king

3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:09.360
 yeah I think the key thing is

3:24:09.360 --> 3:24:11.360
 the way to think about there's another tweet

3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:13.360
 from a couple years ago which is

3:24:13.360 --> 3:24:15.360
 essentially proof of work was like the invention

3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:17.360
 of flight like we've gotten this machine

3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:19.360
 and we managed to get it to fly off the ground

3:24:19.360 --> 3:24:21.360
 and proof of stake is

3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:23.360
 hey we found a great way

3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:25.360
 to make airplanes cheaper

3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:27.360
 and faster by not making them

3:24:27.360 --> 3:24:29.360
 fly

3:24:29.360 --> 3:24:31.360
 by keeping them on the ground

3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:33.360
 like the invention

3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:35.360
 of proof of work the reason the entire

3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:37.360
 digital currency space exists

3:24:37.360 --> 3:24:39.360
 is because bitcoin operates

3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:41.360
 based on proof of work if bitcoin

3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:43.360
 was based on proof of stake it would have

3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:45.360
 died or been shot down from day one

3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:47.360
 but that's a hypothesis

3:24:47.360 --> 3:24:49.360
 and a lot of people believe that

3:24:49.360 --> 3:24:51.360
 and I think they have a lot of strong support

3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:53.360
 but basically proof of work

3:24:53.360 --> 3:24:55.360
 is grounded in physics

3:24:55.360 --> 3:24:57.360
 in the real world the proof of

3:24:57.360 --> 3:24:59.360
 stake is more about

3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:01.360
 it's politics it's the federal reserve it's exactly

3:25:01.360 --> 3:25:03.360
 what we have it's exactly what we have

3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:05.360
 it's just a group of people who get

3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:07.360
 to decide the rules and it's essentially

3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:09.360
 a system that is

3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:11.360
 you know it's a security it's a company

3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:13.360
 so it's not an innovation

3:25:13.360 --> 3:25:15.360
 in any sense it's a step backward to what

3:25:15.360 --> 3:25:17.360
 we already had which is you get a bunch of people

3:25:17.360 --> 3:25:19.360
 in charge of the money now the only

3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:21.360
 reason it survives in this

3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:23.360
 and the reason I call

3:25:23.360 --> 3:25:25.360
 these things scam and I have no problem

3:25:25.360 --> 3:25:27.360
 with calling them as scams because they

3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:29.360
 fraudulently present themselves

3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:31.360
 as being decentralized they present

3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:33.360
 themselves as just being a different way

3:25:33.360 --> 3:25:35.360
 of doing decentralization than bitcoin

3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:37.360
 when it's not it's just they're

3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:39.360
 writing bitcoins coattails

3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:41.360
 and they're writing the fact that most people don't quite

3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:43.360
 understand what bitcoin is and how it works

3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:45.360
 to portray themselves as a cheaper

3:25:45.360 --> 3:25:47.360
 better more more efficient way of doing

3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:49.360
 what bitcoin does it's not

3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:51.360
 it's a less legally

3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:53.360
 accountable way of doing what central banks do

3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:55.360
 right so

3:25:55.360 --> 3:25:57.360
 and the basic criticism is that there's a

3:25:57.360 --> 3:25:59.360
 group of people sometimes a very small group

3:25:59.360 --> 3:26:01.360
 of people that can control the parameters

3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:03.360
 of the operation of the system

3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:05.360
 so over time you can't

3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:07.360
 trust it's not

3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:09.360
 gold under the mattress it doesn't have

3:26:09.360 --> 3:26:11.360
 that kind of heart it's not property

3:26:11.360 --> 3:26:13.360
 and I really very strongly recommend

3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:15.360
 your discussion with sailor for people who want to

3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:17.360
 elaborate more on this there's a bunch of people

3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:19.360
 in charge which means that

3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:21.360
 legally they should be doing this

3:26:21.360 --> 3:26:23.360
 under securities law but

3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:25.360
 even as an anarchist if I don't want to care

3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:27.360
 about that the technical

3:26:27.360 --> 3:26:29.360
 implication of it is this is never going

3:26:29.360 --> 3:26:31.360
 to be adopted as a neutral way

3:26:31.360 --> 3:26:33.360
 of transferring value on the internet because

3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:35.360
 we need you need something

3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:37.360
 that enemies can trade with one another

3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:39.360
 you can't have something that has a small

3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:41.360
 group of people in charge because A

3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:43.360
 the small group of people themselves can be

3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:45.360
 corrupted and B

3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:47.360
 they can be coerced you know you

3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:49.360
 can put a bunch of people in a room put a gun

3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:51.360
 to their head and

3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:53.360
 you can change everything in any of these digital

3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:55.360
 currencies and that's why that's why I think

3:26:55.360 --> 3:26:57.360
 you know you'll find a lot more sympathy

3:26:57.360 --> 3:26:59.360
 among fiaters

3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:01.360
 to shitcoins

3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:03.360
 the Keynesian economist

3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:05.360
 to ethereum fanboy pipeline

3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:07.360
 is a very strong one because

3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:09.360
 it's the same thing

3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:11.360
 it's like you like the idea of

3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:13.360
 people being in charge of money and you think

3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:15.360
 you're going to be the one who's going to be in charge of money

3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:17.360
 so you see a lot of this

3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:19.360
 phenomena and you see the same people that

3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:21.360
 want gold and don't like central

3:27:21.360 --> 3:27:23.360
 banking they get into bitcoin

3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:25.360
 yeah so just to actually

3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:27.360
 push back a couple of things

3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:29.360
 so one is fiat her

3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:31.360
 it sounds like I'm trying to be

3:27:31.360 --> 3:27:33.360
 a sophisticated Brit talking about theater

3:27:33.360 --> 3:27:35.360
 but

3:27:35.360 --> 3:27:37.360
 for many reasons it's not making

3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:39.360
 me feel good about that so

3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:41.360
 you know day by day

3:27:41.360 --> 3:27:43.360
 things change you used to be one of those

3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:45.360
 so people

3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:47.360
 evolve people learn people that are supportive bitcoin

3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:49.360
 might eventually become

3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:51.360
 supporters of ethereum

3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:53.360
 or go back to supporting fiat

3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:55.360
 we don't know people evolve

3:27:55.360 --> 3:27:57.360
 for different reasons you grow up you mature

3:27:57.360 --> 3:27:59.360
 or you

3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:01.360
 become enlightened so I think

3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:03.360
 every single person sort of

3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:05.360
 as this technology is evolving

3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:07.360
 as this world is evolving

3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:09.360
 as wars break out and geopolitics

3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:11.360
 change as the monetary system

3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:13.360
 is constantly

3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:15.360
 put under stress people will evolve

3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:17.360
 so we're trying to all figure it out together

3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:19.360
 that's why like open mindedness here I think

3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:21.360
 for people like me at least

3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:23.360
 this seems essential

3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:25.360
 so I expect you to be answering

3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:27.360
 all of the spam emails you get

3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:29.360
 I will prince by prince by prince

3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:31.360
 but no I don't have a clear

3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:33.360
 understanding what is the good investment

3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:35.360
 in my time what is the good investment in my money

3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:37.360
 that doesn't seem clear

3:28:37.360 --> 3:28:39.360
 because things

3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:41.360
 things are good at promoting themselves

3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:43.360
 I'm not talking about

3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:45.360
 the different kinds of things like

3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:47.360
 ethereum altcoins and so on

3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:49.360
 I just mean life

3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:51.360
 like dating

3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:53.360
 friendships

3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:55.360
 like everybody is

3:28:55.360 --> 3:28:57.360
 advertising themselves as a great investment

3:28:57.360 --> 3:28:59.360
 right

3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:01.360
 but you don't know and you have to keep an open mind

3:29:01.360 --> 3:29:03.360
 and also I don't

3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:05.360
 be

3:29:05.360 --> 3:29:07.360
 self introspective about what

3:29:07.360 --> 3:29:09.360
 how

3:29:09.360 --> 3:29:11.360
 biases I operate under

3:29:11.360 --> 3:29:13.360
 and ways I delude myself

3:29:13.360 --> 3:29:15.360
 like hallucinations that I'm living under

3:29:15.360 --> 3:29:17.360
 breaking out of all these hallucinations

3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:19.360
 it's very hard to introspect

3:29:19.360 --> 3:29:21.360
 thinking like what are the assumptions

3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:23.360
 under which I lived my entire life

3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:25.360
 that might be actually false assumptions

3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:27.360
 that's a really difficult

3:29:27.360 --> 3:29:29.360
 thought process to take

3:29:29.360 --> 3:29:31.360
 it's a dangerous one

3:29:31.360 --> 3:29:33.360
 the Nietzsche if you gaze

3:29:33.360 --> 3:29:35.360
 long into the abyss the abyss

3:29:35.360 --> 3:29:37.360
 gaze into you

3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:39.360
 it's like Alex Jones talks about this

3:29:39.360 --> 3:29:41.360
 I mean he's living

3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:43.360
 he's got demons in his head

3:29:43.360 --> 3:29:45.360
 so he has like all these conspiracy theories

3:29:45.360 --> 3:29:47.360
 that it holds in his head

3:29:47.360 --> 3:29:49.360
 really destroy him

3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:51.360
 so it's a psychological burden to carry

3:29:51.360 --> 3:29:53.360
 so if you question authority

3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:55.360
 if you question government if you question culture

3:29:55.360 --> 3:29:57.360
 the way things have been done

3:29:57.360 --> 3:29:59.360
 it's really difficult

3:29:59.360 --> 3:30:01.360
 and the biases you operate

3:30:01.360 --> 3:30:03.360
 under it's really difficult to question them

3:30:03.360 --> 3:30:05.360
 so I think like being

3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:07.360
 constantly open minded

3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:09.360
 and self critical

3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:11.360
 not constantly but a little bit every day

3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:13.360
 is important I think

3:30:13.360 --> 3:30:15.360
 yeah but I mean you know you're talking to somebody

3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:17.360
 who grew up in Ramallah

3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:19.360
 in Palestine in the West Bank

3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:21.360
 I've changed my mind

3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:23.360
 on all kinds of different things

3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:25.360
 the fact that I was even open to the idea

3:30:25.360 --> 3:30:27.360
 of Bitcoin is

3:30:27.360 --> 3:30:29.360
 has required an enormous amount

3:30:29.360 --> 3:30:31.360
 it's a heck of a journey

3:30:31.360 --> 3:30:33.360
 so I'd much rather appreciate

3:30:33.360 --> 3:30:35.360
 direct arguments

3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:37.360
 rather than these kind of general fluffy

3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:39.360
 you know you should be

3:30:39.360 --> 3:30:41.360
 oh of course yes you should be open minded

3:30:41.360 --> 3:30:43.360
 but you know also you come up with conclusions

3:30:43.360 --> 3:30:45.360
 from email sometimes when you know that it is spam

3:30:45.360 --> 3:30:47.360
 because you have to move on with your life

3:30:47.360 --> 3:30:49.360
 there's an opportunity cost to considering

3:30:49.360 --> 3:30:51.360
 every spam email so

3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:53.360
 well to me okay so I'll just say

3:30:53.360 --> 3:30:55.360
 from my relatively

3:30:55.360 --> 3:30:57.360
 sort of shallow perspective

3:30:57.360 --> 3:30:59.360
 almost like a technical person

3:30:59.360 --> 3:31:01.360
 mostly my understanding of economics is weak

3:31:01.360 --> 3:31:03.360
 proof of stake

3:31:03.360 --> 3:31:05.360
 is not obviously

3:31:07.360 --> 3:31:09.360
 weak consensus mechanism

3:31:09.360 --> 3:31:11.360
 relative to proof of work

3:31:11.360 --> 3:31:13.360
 so that's not obvious to me

3:31:13.360 --> 3:31:15.360
 that there goes wrong and it becomes

3:31:15.360 --> 3:31:17.360
 corrupted in the way that governments

3:31:17.360 --> 3:31:19.360
 get corrupted because it still

3:31:19.360 --> 3:31:21.360
 seems decentralized

3:31:21.360 --> 3:31:23.360
 now your criticism of governance

3:31:23.360 --> 3:31:25.360
 is an interesting one but if you put

3:31:25.360 --> 3:31:27.360
 that aside it still is a

3:31:27.360 --> 3:31:29.360
 decentralized mechanism

3:31:29.360 --> 3:31:31.360
 and it's more transparent than the

3:31:31.360 --> 3:31:33.360
 mechanism that governments operate on

3:31:33.360 --> 3:31:35.360
 it isn't, this is exactly what the Federal Reserve is

3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:37.360
 the Federal Reserve is a proof of stake system

3:31:37.360 --> 3:31:39.360
 the Federal Reserve is owned by its

3:31:39.360 --> 3:31:41.360
 constituent banks and so the rules

3:31:41.360 --> 3:31:43.360
 of the Federal Reserve and the regulations are

3:31:43.360 --> 3:31:45.360
 determined by the ownership which is the banks

3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:47.360
 so it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is

3:31:47.360 --> 3:31:49.360
 but it's too backdoor

3:31:49.360 --> 3:31:51.360
 the agreements between the banks

3:31:51.360 --> 3:31:53.360
 and the Federal Reserve

3:31:53.360 --> 3:31:55.360
 it feels like a lot of those agreements are made

3:31:55.360 --> 3:31:57.360
 between individuals that

3:31:57.360 --> 3:31:59.360
 sort of behind the scenes it's not

3:31:59.360 --> 3:32:01.360
 hard to, it's opaque, yes

3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:03.360
 but the only way that a proof of stake system

3:32:03.360 --> 3:32:05.360
 will take off is if you have a military

3:32:05.360 --> 3:32:07.360
 to force people to use it

3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:09.360
 that's the thing, ultimately there's no way

3:32:09.360 --> 3:32:11.360
 that it's going to take off on a free

3:32:11.360 --> 3:32:13.360
 market and that's why

3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:15.360
 for all of the bluster about wanting to move

3:32:15.360 --> 3:32:17.360
 to a proof of stake system, Ethereum have been

3:32:17.360 --> 3:32:19.360
 saying this since 2014

3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:21.360
 it's not been 8 years

3:32:21.360 --> 3:32:23.360
 they've been talking about it

3:32:23.360 --> 3:32:25.360
 we still haven't seen the proof of stake

3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:27.360
 system operational in the wild, it's vaporware

3:32:27.360 --> 3:32:29.360
 for all practical intents

3:32:29.360 --> 3:32:31.360
 it's potential, I mean you can do it

3:32:31.360 --> 3:32:33.360
 in a centralized way

3:32:33.360 --> 3:32:35.360
 but like

3:32:35.360 --> 3:32:37.360
 can it survive, can it last

3:32:37.360 --> 3:32:39.360
 for a long time? I don't think so

3:32:39.360 --> 3:32:41.360
 and I think

3:32:41.360 --> 3:32:43.360
 it can last perhaps initially

3:32:43.360 --> 3:32:45.360
 with marketing, with centralized marketing

3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:47.360
 you can promote it but

3:32:47.360 --> 3:32:49.360
 ultimately

3:32:49.360 --> 3:32:51.360
 user demand, the people that are not

3:32:51.360 --> 3:32:53.360
 interested in speculating because

3:32:53.360 --> 3:32:55.360
 they want to get rich on this, the people that are going to use it

3:32:55.360 --> 3:32:57.360
 they're going to want to use it because they can

3:32:57.360 --> 3:32:59.360
 trust that it is

3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:01.360
 not going to be messed with

3:33:01.360 --> 3:33:03.360
 but there's also applications

3:33:03.360 --> 3:33:05.360
 but there's applications on top

3:33:05.360 --> 3:33:07.360
 like the other reason I'm

3:33:07.360 --> 3:33:09.360
 interested in things like Ethereum

3:33:09.360 --> 3:33:11.360
 is you might think it's ridiculous

3:33:11.360 --> 3:33:13.360
 I thought it was ridiculous but NFTs

3:33:13.360 --> 3:33:15.360
 so what's the

3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:17.360
 you can have NFTs probably on top of Bitcoin

3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:19.360
 but you don't because there's no marketing

3:33:19.360 --> 3:33:21.360
 on in Bitcoin because

3:33:21.360 --> 3:33:23.360
 all of these ideas get promoted on proprietary

3:33:23.360 --> 3:33:25.360
 shitcoins because

3:33:25.360 --> 3:33:27.360
 but there's the network effects of ideas

3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:29.360
 of applications so they just

3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:31.360
 take off for some reason and human civilization

3:33:31.360 --> 3:33:33.360
 is such that you get excited

3:33:33.360 --> 3:33:35.360
 about stuff and large amounts of people believe a thing

3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:37.360
 and they start to get excited and it actually

3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:39.360
 has impact, like the fact that NFTs

3:33:39.360 --> 3:33:41.360
 can have an impact on the art world

3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:43.360
 or the world in general

3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:45.360
 is wild to me

3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:47.360
 but it worked, so the question is

3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:49.360
 David Rothkall has an impact

3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:51.360
 on the art world

3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:53.360
 I'm saying these ideas have

3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:55.360
 you know, we're collective intelligent

3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:57.360
 beings and we can believe a thing

3:33:57.360 --> 3:33:59.360
 and that has power

3:33:59.360 --> 3:34:01.360
 that has led to major wars

3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:03.360
 and all those kinds of things

3:34:03.360 --> 3:34:05.360
 so it's interesting to me

3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:07.360
 that NFTs took hold

3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:09.360
 and the question is, is there distributed

3:34:09.360 --> 3:34:11.360
 dApps, is there distributed apps built on top

3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:13.360
 of different blockchains that might

3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:15.360
 somehow transform the world

3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:17.360
 you have to kind of keep an open mind to that

3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:19.360
 because right now it's like

3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:21.360
 I'm the same place with that as I am

3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:23.360
 with virtual reality

3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:25.360
 it's like alright

3:34:25.360 --> 3:34:27.360
 this seems like a really intellectually

3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:29.360
 promising set of ideas here

3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:31.360
 but there's something either technically

3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:33.360
 or socially not quite taking hold

3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:35.360
 why?

3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:37.360
 and I don't know what the right answer is

3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:39.360
 so with virtual reality what's the right answer

3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:41.360
 is it just technically

3:34:41.360 --> 3:34:43.360
 the latency is too high

3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:45.360
 or

3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:47.360
 the games are not good enough

3:34:47.360 --> 3:34:49.360
 or is it a fundamentally flawed idea

3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:51.360
 that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it

3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:53.360
 that the physical world is just

3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:55.360
 orders of magnitude better

3:34:55.360 --> 3:34:57.360
 a two dimensional display

3:34:57.360 --> 3:34:59.360
 is just as good as a three dimensional world

3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:01.360
 I don't know, why is virtual reality not taken off

3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:03.360
 it's been since the 80s

3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:05.360
 I don't have strong opinions on it

3:35:05.360 --> 3:35:07.360
 on the prospects of the technology

3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:09.360
 personally I don't want to ever

3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:11.360
 imagine myself having

3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:13.360
 something on my eyes, I'd rather just go out into the real world

3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:17.360
 but I don't have strong opinions on virtual reality

3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:19.360
 I do have on dApps and NFTs

3:35:19.360 --> 3:35:21.360
 yeah what's your criticism

3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:23.360
 of dApps and NFTs, is this a distraction

3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:25.360
 it's a way to sell

3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:27.360
 a flawed technology

3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:29.360
 the problem with dApps is

3:35:29.360 --> 3:35:31.360
 the economics of it makes no sense

3:35:31.360 --> 3:35:33.360
 in the sense that

3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:35.360
 currently

3:35:35.360 --> 3:35:37.360
 if you wanted to run an application

3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:39.360
 whatever the application is

3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:41.360
 you want to run it on AWS

3:35:41.360 --> 3:35:43.360
 you pay a specific amount of money

3:35:43.360 --> 3:35:45.360
 you want to run it on your own laptop

3:35:45.360 --> 3:35:47.360
 you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte

3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:49.360
 of data

3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:51.360
 if you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger

3:35:51.360 --> 3:35:53.360
 distributing the data over

3:35:53.360 --> 3:35:55.360
 thousands of computers worldwide

3:35:55.360 --> 3:35:57.360
 it's infinitely more expensive

3:35:57.360 --> 3:35:59.360
 and that's why we haven't seen any of these dApps

3:35:59.360 --> 3:36:01.360
 take off

3:36:01.360 --> 3:36:03.360
 and that's why I've said this many years ago

3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:05.360
 the only working application

3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:07.360
 of blockchain technology is Bitcoin

3:36:07.360 --> 3:36:09.360
 because with Bitcoin

3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:11.360
 with a few hundred bytes of data

3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:13.360
 with a few bytes of data you could

3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:15.360
 move a billion dollars worth

3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:17.360
 of

3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:19.360
 economic value from here to China

3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:21.360
 and move it safely and reliably

3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:23.360
 so that power

3:36:23.360 --> 3:36:25.360
 I can't

3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:27.360
 see it being justified

3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:29.360
 for anything that is not as mission critical

3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:31.360
 as moving large amounts of

3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:33.360
 value which require very

3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:35.360
 little amount of information

3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:37.360
 so when you look at all of the buzzwords that Ethereum

3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:39.360
 and other altcoin

3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:41.360
 marketing people like to use

3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:43.360
 and you know

3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:45.360
 if you want to wonder really why we come to

3:36:45.360 --> 3:36:47.360
 this kind of aggression is because

3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:49.360
 I've heard all of this

3:36:49.360 --> 3:36:51.360
 I've had all of these hucksters come to me for years

3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:53.360
 I've had

3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:55.360
 people in 2016

3:36:55.360 --> 3:36:57.360
 talk to me about how

3:36:57.360 --> 3:36:59.360
 Ethereum blockchain technology

3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:01.360
 is going to revolutionize real estate

3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:03.360
 deeds in India

3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:05.360
 I remember this guy

3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:07.360
 I'm not going to mention his name

3:37:07.360 --> 3:37:09.360
 but this guy was

3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:11.360
 2016 and he sold a lot of shitcoins

3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:13.360
 and he made a lot of money off of shitcoins

3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:15.360
 based on all these silly ideas

3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:17.360
 we can have blackjack

3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:19.360
 on a distributed ledger

3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:21.360
 we can have Indian real estate on a distributed ledger

3:37:21.360 --> 3:37:23.360
 and it's just

3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:25.360
 it's concerned trolling marketing

3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:27.360
 oh there's a problem with real estate

3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:29.360
 in India, real estate deeds

3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:31.360
 blockchain fixes this

3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:33.360
 buy my shitcoin and then people buy the shitcoin

3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:35.360
 Indian real estate isn't fixed

3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:37.360
 and the guy gets rich

3:37:37.360 --> 3:37:39.360
 and they move on

3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:41.360
 but I mean I'm still waiting

3:37:41.360 --> 3:37:43.360
 for a DAP to actually emerge

3:37:43.360 --> 3:37:45.360
 you know it's

3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:47.360
 the promise that we keep hearing

3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:49.360
 is something completely world changing

3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:51.360
 world transforming

3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:53.360
 and the reality is not one app

3:37:53.360 --> 3:37:55.360
 like there's one of my good friends Jimmy Song

3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:57.360
 eventually they refused to go ahead

3:37:57.360 --> 3:37:59.360
 with the bet, he wanted to bet with one of the Ethereum people

3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:01.360
 about

3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:03.360
 about these DAPs

3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:05.360
 the Ethereum people are constantly saying those DAPs are going to grow

3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:07.360
 and they're going to have so many applications

3:38:07.360 --> 3:38:09.360
 and they're going to have so many ideas

3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:11.360
 and the reality is all the

3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:13.360
 work are centralized apps

3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:15.360
 so there is no

3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:17.360
 Uber on the blockchain

3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:19.360
 there is no

3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:21.360
 Twitter on the blockchain

3:38:21.360 --> 3:38:23.360
 there is no social media on the blockchain because

3:38:23.360 --> 3:38:25.360
 these are businesses and businesses require

3:38:25.360 --> 3:38:27.360
 centralized authority to make decisions

3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:29.360
 you can't have it be decentralized

3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:31.360
 listen you're frustrated

3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:33.360
 and I could see it over a few years

3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:35.360
 of just having dealt with

3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:37.360
 a humongous influx

3:38:37.360 --> 3:38:39.360
 of charlatans

3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:41.360
 and it's no

3:38:41.360 --> 3:38:43.360
 it's water off my back

3:38:43.360 --> 3:38:45.360
 no but a man they use this

3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:47.360
 in a community they use the word shit coin

3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:49.360
 is a little bit

3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:51.360
 you call it amusement and I think

3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:53.360
 amusement is the way

3:38:53.360 --> 3:38:55.360
 to deal with the frustration

3:38:55.360 --> 3:38:57.360
 it's a channeling of frustration

3:38:57.360 --> 3:38:59.360
 like sometimes

3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:01.360
 when you have to deal with bullshit

3:39:01.360 --> 3:39:03.360
 the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity

3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:05.360
 of it all and that's what you mean

3:39:05.360 --> 3:39:07.360
 by amusement

3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:09.360
 the fact is

3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:11.360
 there is things

3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:13.360
 like artificial intelligence

3:39:15.360 --> 3:39:17.360
 how many decades

3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:19.360
 seven decades has been

3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:21.360
 often on promising

3:39:21.360 --> 3:39:23.360
 to change everything

3:39:23.360 --> 3:39:25.360
 and

3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:27.360
 it has failed time and time again

3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:29.360
 to deliver to the promise

3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:31.360
 but that doesn't mean

3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:33.360
 there's something fundamental and really powerful

3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:35.360
 about both the small and the big things

3:39:35.360 --> 3:39:37.360
 going on within the actual

3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:39.360
 research and development

3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:41.360
 within those communities there's a lot of exciting

3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:43.360
 developments and the scale at which

3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:45.360
 those developments might actually have

3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:47.360
 a transformative impact the time scale

3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:49.360
 is unclear it seems like

3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:51.360
 we certainly over promise

3:39:51.360 --> 3:39:53.360
 we dream too big and too aggressively

3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:55.360
 in the AI community

3:39:55.360 --> 3:39:57.360
 yeah and I'm happy to give people

3:39:57.360 --> 3:39:59.360
 the benefit of the doubt when they're over promising

3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:01.360
 but not when they're making their own money

3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:03.360
 when you start making your own currency

3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:05.360
 then you don't get the benefit of the doubt

3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:07.360
 because if your idea needs you

3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:09.360
 to have a new currency that you print

3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:11.360
 when Bitcoin is out there then

3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:13.360
 I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you're doing this

3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:15.360
 for the money printing.

3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:17.360
 There's a good time to mention that I am actually launching my

3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:19.360
 new coin called LexCoin

3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:21.360
 you mean shitcoin

3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:23.360
 oh god

3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:25.360
 I'm gonna have to block you with love

3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:27.360
 okay

3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:29.360
 one thing I want to ask you about is

3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:31.360
 Fed's

3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:33.360
 this paper they released in January

3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:35.360
 20th

3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:37.360
 on the potential central bank digital

3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:39.360
 currency CBDC

3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:41.360
 what are your thoughts about that is it just another

3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:43.360
 like is there pros and cons to this

3:40:43.360 --> 3:40:45.360
 is it all interesting to you

3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:47.360
 that they're even considering this kind of thing

3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:49.360
 I used to think that it's

3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:51.360
 it's just basically

3:40:51.360 --> 3:40:53.360
 waffle it's meaningless

3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:55.360
 because as it exists

3:40:55.360 --> 3:40:57.360
 the dollar is a central bank digital currency

3:40:57.360 --> 3:40:59.360
 the vast majority of dollars are digital

3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:01.360
 and

3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:03.360
 but I think the way that over the last couple of years

3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:05.360
 I've changed my mind on this I think this is

3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:07.360
 there's some serious substance behind these ideas

3:41:07.360 --> 3:41:09.360
 and

3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:11.360
 what they mean effectively is

3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:13.360
 the disintermediation of the banking system

3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:15.360
 and giving everybody

3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:17.360
 an account at the Federal Reserve

3:41:17.360 --> 3:41:19.360
 this is kind of the really

3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:21.360
 dangerous idea

3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:23.360
 and I think this is enormously significant

3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:25.360
 effectively as somebody who's lived in

3:41:25.360 --> 3:41:27.360
 the Soviet Union what this is is the return of the

3:41:27.360 --> 3:41:29.360
 Goss Bank on a global scale

3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:31.360
 with modern technology so under the Soviet Union

3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:33.360
 there was something called the Goss Bank

3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:35.360
 or People's Bank and that was the only bank

3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:37.360
 in the country and you had an account

3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:39.360
 with the National Bank

3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:41.360
 and you know if you

3:41:41.360 --> 3:41:43.360
 said something wrong your

3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:45.360
 money got terminated from the Goss Bank

3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.360
 now imagine that combined

3:41:47.360 --> 3:41:49.360
 with the power of digital technology

3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:51.360
 and you can see that this

3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:53.360
 could be an enormously powerful

3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:55.360
 technology

3:41:55.360 --> 3:41:57.360
 really because if banks

3:41:57.360 --> 3:41:59.360
 are out of the picture then we

3:41:59.360 --> 3:42:01.360
 changed the fundamental

3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:03.360
 reality of fiat

3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:05.360
 as being the creation of money through lending

3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:07.360
 and then it becomes the creation of money

3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:09.360
 truly by fiat by government fiat

3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:11.360
 so we moved to a system in which

3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:13.360
 money is just basically

3:42:13.360 --> 3:42:15.360
 it's like we have

3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:17.360
 money that is pieces of paper and every time we've had

3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:19.360
 money we've had fiat money

3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:21.360
 that was just pieces of paper it collapsed very

3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:23.360
 quickly with the current

3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:25.360
 system money is credit and the

3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:27.360
 creation of credit is restricted to some

3:42:27.360 --> 3:42:29.360
 point and the creation of credit

3:42:29.360 --> 3:42:31.360
 is self correcting I discussed this in the fiat standard

3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:33.360
 if the central bank

3:42:33.360 --> 3:42:35.360
 allows banks to create too much credit that creates

3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:37.360
 a bubble and then there's a collapse in the money supply

3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:39.360
 which prevents hyperinflation

3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:41.360
 from happening because

3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:43.360
 the money creation is

3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:45.360
 self destructive it's self correcting

3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:47.360
 so you end up with an average

3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:49.360
 of like 7% per year

3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:51.360
 increase because you have

3:42:51.360 --> 3:42:53.360
 10% for 5 years and then you get

3:42:53.360 --> 3:42:55.360
 negative 20% for

3:42:55.360 --> 3:42:57.360
 1 year and it's

3:42:57.360 --> 3:42:59.360
 correct but now if you get rid of the credit

3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:01.360
 creation mechanism and it's just assigning money

3:43:01.360 --> 3:43:03.360
 directly we're likely going to get

3:43:03.360 --> 3:43:05.360
 much faster inflation and I think

3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:07.360
 that's obviously

3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:09.360
 the huge problem and perhaps the

3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:11.360
 even bigger problem is the

3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:13.360
 enormous amount of power that it gives

3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:15.360
 to governments it's

3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:17.360
 it allows them to create an awful

3:43:17.360 --> 3:43:19.360
 dystopia where

3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:21.360
 you've got your money

3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:23.360
 on your phone and

3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:25.360
 anything you do

3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:27.360
 is completely supervised and

3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:29.360
 controlled through your spending so

3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:31.360
 they want to introduce a new lockdown

3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:33.360
 then they'll just make your money not

3:43:33.360 --> 3:43:35.360
 work your money is broken today

3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:37.360
 you can't spend money or you

3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:39.360
 can only spend money in your local supermarket

3:43:39.360 --> 3:43:41.360
 for the next 3 months because

3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:43.360
 you can't leave your neighborhood your money stops working

3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:45.360
 outside of your neighborhood

3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:47.360
 this Chinese social credit

3:43:47.360 --> 3:43:49.360
 core system is an example of this

3:43:49.360 --> 3:43:51.360
 and I think

3:43:51.360 --> 3:43:53.360
 I don't know I don't have a crystal ball

3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:55.360
 so I don't know what the likelihood is

3:43:55.360 --> 3:43:57.360
 of implementing something like this in the US

3:43:57.360 --> 3:43:59.360
 I've discussed it with

3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:01.360
 Michael Saylor he thinks it's

3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:03.360
 highly unlikely he thinks you know

3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:05.360
 the people who've been pushing this

3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:07.360
 are very far from the position of power

3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:09.360
 and the traditional

3:44:09.360 --> 3:44:11.360
 monetary and financial system is going to

3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:13.360
 survive intact

3:44:13.360 --> 3:44:15.360
 I certainly hope so

3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:17.360
 I think this would be a terrible thing if it comes to pass

3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:19.360
 but I don't think many people think that it

3:44:19.360 --> 3:44:21.360
 is something that would undermine Bitcoin

3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:23.360
 like a lot of common objection to Bitcoin

3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:25.360
 is well

3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:27.360
 governments are just going to launch their own digital currencies

3:44:27.360 --> 3:44:29.360
 and then Bitcoin is going to die

3:44:29.360 --> 3:44:31.360
 and I think this is completely missing the point

3:44:31.360 --> 3:44:33.360
 people think Bitcoin is important because it's digital

3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:35.360
 it's not

3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:37.360
 national currencies can be digital

3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:39.360
 Bitcoin is important because it's not inflationary

3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:41.360
 and because nobody controls it

3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:43.360
 central bank digital currencies are likely to be

3:44:43.360 --> 3:44:45.360
 very inflationary

3:44:45.360 --> 3:44:47.360
 and they're likely to have very strong control at the top

3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:49.360
 so if anything they are an

3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:51.360
 advertisement for Bitcoin rather than a

3:44:51.360 --> 3:44:53.360
 replacement for it

3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:55.360
 if it's Bitcoin if it's gold it's a way for multiple nations

3:44:55.360 --> 3:44:57.360
 to partake

3:44:57.360 --> 3:44:59.360
 so if you were to imagine a future

3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:01.360
 where we move

3:45:01.360 --> 3:45:03.360
 from the fiat standard

3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:05.360
 back to the gold standard

3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:07.360
 and then to the Bitcoin standard

3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:09.360
 or skipping that going directly to the Bitcoin standard

3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:11.360
 what would it take

3:45:11.360 --> 3:45:13.360
 as a gradual as immediate

3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:15.360
 what are possible

3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:17.360
 trajectories that take us

3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:19.360
 well basically where the final sort of empirical

3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:21.360
 observation is that you overtake

3:45:21.360 --> 3:45:23.360
 Bitcoin overtakes

3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:25.360
 first gold and then bonds

3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:27.360
 in terms of

3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:29.360
 its monetary

3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:31.360
 power in the world

3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:33.360
 but like just specifically from

3:45:33.360 --> 3:45:35.360
 a government perspective how do we move the United States

3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:37.360
 China, Russia, India

3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:39.360
 European Union

3:45:39.360 --> 3:45:41.360
 to a Bitcoin standard

3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:43.360
 I'm not entirely concerned

3:45:43.360 --> 3:45:45.360
 about whether governments move or not

3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:47.360
 in fact I'd be very happy

3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:49.360
 for them not to move

3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:51.360
 as long as possible

3:45:51.360 --> 3:45:53.360
 so that individuals can accumulate

3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:55.360
 more and more Bitcoin while it's still cheap

3:45:55.360 --> 3:45:57.360
 so the people will move

3:45:57.360 --> 3:45:59.360
 and the governments

3:45:59.360 --> 3:46:01.360
 will catch up

3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:03.360
 yeah and I think this is kind of what I

3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:05.360
 allude to I mean the point of the fiat standard

3:46:05.360 --> 3:46:07.360
 the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin

3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:09.360
 going book and it talks about fiat

3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:11.360
 most of the time but it's

3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:13.360
 does so to analyze Bitcoin

3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:15.360
 and the rise of Bitcoin in the final chapter I discuss

3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:17.360
 how I think this relationship

3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:19.360
 plays out

3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:23.360
 the way that I tend to think of it

3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:25.360
 is that most likely what's going to happen is

3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:27.360
 we're gonna have kind of

3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:29.360
 financial apartheid where there's going to be

3:46:29.360 --> 3:46:31.360
 two monetary systems

3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:33.360
 one is government controlled

3:46:33.360 --> 3:46:35.360
 and it comes with increasing

3:46:35.360 --> 3:46:37.360
 amounts of surveillance and inflation

3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:39.360
 and then if you want

3:46:39.360 --> 3:46:41.360
 you can just opt out of that

3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:43.360
 and get into Bitcoin

3:46:43.360 --> 3:46:45.360
 and it's likely going to be difficult

3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:47.360
 for governments to stop people from getting into Bitcoin

3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:49.360
 for all of the technical reasons

3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:51.360
 that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin

3:46:51.360 --> 3:46:53.360
 so then we have this alternative

3:46:53.360 --> 3:46:55.360
 that is Bitcoin which is not inflationary

3:46:55.360 --> 3:46:57.360
 and does not have

3:46:57.360 --> 3:46:59.360
 a central authority that can censor it

3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:01.360
 I think

3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:03.360
 gradually

3:47:03.360 --> 3:47:05.360
 is my hope and I also think

3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:07.360
 my most likely scenario

3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:09.360
 but maybe I am biased because

3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:11.360
 everybody thinks what they want

3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:13.360
 is what's going to happen

3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:15.360
 I think we're just going to witness the same

3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:17.360
 relationship because

3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:19.360
 governments make their currency so that they can

3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:21.360
 devalue them

3:47:21.360 --> 3:47:23.360
 and Bitcoin thrives on that

3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:25.360
 and more and more people are going to learn

3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:27.360
 more and more people are going to find out

3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:29.360
 and whether it's through

3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:31.360
 curiosity or self interest

3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:33.360
 or personal currency

3:47:33.360 --> 3:47:35.360
 all roads lead to Bitcoin

3:47:35.360 --> 3:47:37.360
 so more and more people are going to buy Bitcoin

3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:39.360
 the price of Bitcoin is going to go up

3:47:39.360 --> 3:47:41.360
 and as it goes up Bitcoin becomes

3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:43.360
 a more significant part of the world economy

3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:45.360
 and this is something that skeptics

3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:47.360
 don't get like a lot of the academic skeptics

3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:49.360
 to Bitcoin

3:47:49.360 --> 3:47:51.360
 they offer up all of these theories

3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:53.360
 about why they think Bitcoin

3:47:53.360 --> 3:47:55.360
 can't work and then they present it

3:47:55.360 --> 3:47:57.360
 and they think they've

3:47:57.360 --> 3:47:59.360
 delivered the knockout blow

3:47:59.360 --> 3:48:01.360
 or the word is going to need their permission

3:48:01.360 --> 3:48:03.360
 well the reality is people are going to join Bitcoin out of greed

3:48:03.360 --> 3:48:05.360
 out of self interest

3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:07.360
 number go up technology

3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:09.360
 is really what's going to get everybody in

3:48:09.360 --> 3:48:11.360
 and that's really the Trojan horse

3:48:11.360 --> 3:48:13.360
 for fixing the world

3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:15.360
 come for the greed

3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:17.360
 and stay for the revolution

3:48:17.360 --> 3:48:19.360
 it's going to keep going up because

3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:21.360
 people don't like to be poor

3:48:21.360 --> 3:48:23.360
 except for most economists and academics

3:48:23.360 --> 3:48:25.360
 people don't like to be poor

3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:27.360
 people don't enjoy getting their wealth destroyed

3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:29.360
 and they care more about their

3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:31.360
 self interest than they care about

3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:33.360
 economic theories about whether this works

3:48:33.360 --> 3:48:35.360
 as money or not they see their cousin

3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:37.360
 escaped hyperinflation

3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:39.360
 managed to get a bigger house because they bought Bitcoin

3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:41.360
 five years ago they realized maybe I should stop

3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:43.360
 mocking my cousin

3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:45.360
 and start buying more Bitcoin and this is

3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:47.360
 I think an indomitable force

3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:49.360
 that's going to continue

3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:51.360
 and one thing

3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:53.360
 most Bitcoiners

3:48:53.360 --> 3:48:55.360
 tend to lean toward an apocalyptic

3:48:55.360 --> 3:48:57.360
 transition

3:48:57.360 --> 3:48:59.360
 fiat is going to collapse we're going to get hyperinflation

3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:01.360
 everything is going to be terrible and then we're going to move to Bitcoin

3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:03.360
 and

3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:05.360
 I present the case for why I think

3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:07.360
 maybe that might not be the case

3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:09.360
 maybe we won't get this kind of apocalyptic

3:49:09.360 --> 3:49:11.360
 scenario

3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:13.360
 and this was like the conclusion of

3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:15.360
 the fiat standard which is

3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:17.360
 once you realize that mining fiat is creating

3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:19.360
 debt

3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:21.360
 and Bitcoin is allowing

3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:23.360
 so in order to have fiat money we need to have people

3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:25.360
 borrow we need to have people make loans

3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:27.360
 and

3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:29.360
 the problem that fiat money runs into today

3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:31.360
 is that if you want to save money

3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:33.360
 if you want to hold savings

3:49:33.360 --> 3:49:35.360
 you have a problem

3:49:35.360 --> 3:49:37.360
 where do you put your savings

3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:39.360
 so you put your savings in debt in the creation

3:49:39.360 --> 3:49:41.360
 of more bonds

3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:43.360
 wherever you take your savings you create a bubble

3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:45.360
 in those things and this is why we see a bubble

3:49:45.360 --> 3:49:47.360
 in the stock market a bubble in the bond market

3:49:47.360 --> 3:49:49.360
 a bubble in housing it's because

3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:51.360
 people are looking for savings

3:49:51.360 --> 3:49:53.360
 for a place where they can save all of those things

3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:55.360
 are crappy saving instruments because

3:49:55.360 --> 3:49:57.360
 they're like

3:49:57.360 --> 3:49:59.360
 they're like copper in that there's nothing

3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:01.360
 to stop the people behind them to make more of them

3:50:01.360 --> 3:50:03.360
 house

3:50:03.360 --> 3:50:05.360
 builders can build more houses

3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:07.360
 governments can issue more bonds

3:50:07.360 --> 3:50:09.360
 crappy fraudulent companies

3:50:09.360 --> 3:50:11.360
 can list on the stock market and make more stocks

3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:13.360
 well Bitcoin finally

3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:15.360
 offers us an outlet we don't need to keep

3:50:15.360 --> 3:50:17.360
 creating more debt we can

3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:19.360
 invest in this asset that is

3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:21.360
 hard and that is internationally

3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:23.360
 liquid and

3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:25.360
 that nobody can make more of so

3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:27.360
 there is no bubble in it there is no mechanism

3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:29.360
 for somebody to

3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:31.360
 increase the supply and bring the price crashing down

3:50:31.360 --> 3:50:33.360
 like with copper in real estate and bonds

3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:35.360
 so

3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:37.360
 Bitcoin is the way out and this is why I think

3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:39.360
 there's a good case to be made for why the fiat

3:50:39.360 --> 3:50:41.360
 authorities

3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:43.360
 might embrace Bitcoin because they'll see

3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:45.360
 it is their way out of this

3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:47.360
 enormous debt bubble that everybody

3:50:47.360 --> 3:50:49.360
 is stuck in particularly

3:50:49.360 --> 3:50:51.360
 the richest and most powerful people in the world

3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:53.360
 and the richest and most powerful

3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:55.360
 governments in the world are the world's biggest borrowers

3:50:55.360 --> 3:50:57.360
 they're the ones in a lot of debt

3:50:57.360 --> 3:50:59.360
 so a continuous

3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:01.360
 slow devaluation of the value

3:51:01.360 --> 3:51:03.360
 of that debt as people

3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:05.360
 upgrade and move on to a hard asset that

3:51:05.360 --> 3:51:07.360
 continues to appreciate

3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:09.360
 is the way that we

3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:11.360
 is the peaceful way that we wind down

3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:13.360
 the fiat Ponzi I think you could see

3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:15.360
 it being like a political part

3:51:15.360 --> 3:51:17.360
 of a political platform for future

3:51:17.360 --> 3:51:19.360
 people that run for president those

3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:21.360
 kinds of things to address

3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:23.360
 obviously

3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:25.360
 it's not just for the powerful and the rich

3:51:25.360 --> 3:51:27.360
 the people are bothered by the debt

3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:29.360
 the people are bothered

3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:31.360
 by everything that you describe with fiat

3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:33.360
 and if you want to

3:51:33.360 --> 3:51:35.360
 sell yourself in a democracy

3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:37.360
 as a good leader you might want

3:51:37.360 --> 3:51:39.360
 to make that part of the platform

3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:41.360
 you mentioned you know Michael Malis

3:51:41.360 --> 3:51:43.360
 he just texted me asking

3:51:43.360 --> 3:51:45.360
 me to ask you

3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:47.360
 what do you like best

3:51:47.360 --> 3:51:49.360
 about Michael Malis if you can

3:51:49.360 --> 3:51:51.360
 spend 5 to 10

3:51:51.360 --> 3:51:53.360
 to 20 to an hour talking about

3:51:53.360 --> 3:51:55.360
 the genius of Michael Malis

3:51:55.360 --> 3:51:57.360
 what do you like

3:51:57.360 --> 3:51:59.360
 where does one even start

3:51:59.360 --> 3:52:01.360
 obviously the haircut first

3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:03.360
 yeah he just gets sexier with age

3:52:03.360 --> 3:52:05.360
 that's for sure

3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:07.360
 his ideas

3:52:07.360 --> 3:52:09.360
 his trolling

3:52:09.360 --> 3:52:11.360
 and humor

3:52:11.360 --> 3:52:13.360
 and then she has to interact with him

3:52:13.360 --> 3:52:15.360
 yes yes I've met Michael maybe

3:52:15.360 --> 3:52:17.360
 10, 12 years ago in New York

3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:19.360
 I used to live in New York when he used to live in New York

3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:21.360
 met him a couple of times

3:52:21.360 --> 3:52:23.360
 there was a bunch of

3:52:23.360 --> 3:52:25.360
 anarchists in New York used to throw a happy hour

3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:27.360
 once a month

3:52:27.360 --> 3:52:29.360
 it was called the high time preference

3:52:29.360 --> 3:52:31.360
 Hoppe hour

3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:33.360
 in honor of Hans Hermann Hoppe

3:52:33.360 --> 3:52:35.360
 so I met him there a couple of times

3:52:35.360 --> 3:52:37.360
 and we followed each other

3:52:37.360 --> 3:52:39.360
 on Twitter for a while

3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:41.360
 is there interesting that you're aware of

3:52:41.360 --> 3:52:43.360
 philosophical differences in your world views

3:52:43.360 --> 3:52:45.360
 um no I think

3:52:45.360 --> 3:52:47.360
 we pretty much see eye to eye

3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:49.360
 um

3:52:49.360 --> 3:52:51.360
 I think the difference is mainly that he's

3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:53.360
 he spends a lot of time focusing on American politics

3:52:53.360 --> 3:52:55.360
 and American pop culture

3:52:55.360 --> 3:52:57.360
 which I don't pay much attention to I guess

3:52:57.360 --> 3:52:59.360
 so you look more

3:52:59.360 --> 3:53:01.360
 at the monetary system, the economics of it all

3:53:01.360 --> 3:53:03.360
 and just the history and just looking at it

3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:05.360
 zooming out

3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:07.360
 at the big picture of it all

3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:09.360
 although recently he's working on a book called

3:53:09.360 --> 3:53:11.360
 the white pill

3:53:11.360 --> 3:53:13.360
 and he's been

3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:15.360
 every time I see him

3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:17.360
 I mean he's in some dark aspect

3:53:17.360 --> 3:53:19.360
 of the 20th century

3:53:19.360 --> 3:53:21.360
 he's just like I just finished writing about Hallenomore

3:53:21.360 --> 3:53:23.360
 as you might imagine

3:53:23.360 --> 3:53:25.360
 he's not taking much

3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:27.360
 I believe of a monetary perspective on things

3:53:27.360 --> 3:53:29.360
 his book

3:53:29.360 --> 3:53:31.360
 his writing at least for time

3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:33.360
 his kind of philosophical

3:53:33.360 --> 3:53:35.360
 ideology perspective

3:53:35.360 --> 3:53:37.360
 on the outside of the monetary system

3:53:37.360 --> 3:53:39.360
 but you argue that those are actually

3:53:39.360 --> 3:53:41.360
 inextricably linked

3:53:41.360 --> 3:53:43.360
 but yeah and I don't think he would disagree

3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:45.360
 but he would uh

3:53:45.360 --> 3:53:47.360
 but a book has to be

3:53:47.360 --> 3:53:49.360
 you know it can only be so long I suppose

3:53:49.360 --> 3:53:51.360
 it can only focus on

3:53:51.360 --> 3:53:53.360
 so many things

3:53:53.360 --> 3:53:55.360
 if you can put on your wise sage hat

3:53:55.360 --> 3:53:57.360
 and give some advice

3:53:57.360 --> 3:53:59.360
 to young people

3:53:59.360 --> 3:54:01.360
 I mean you know the past four hours have been

3:54:01.360 --> 3:54:03.360
 a kind of advice but if you can

3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:05.360
 focus and if somebody in high school

3:54:05.360 --> 3:54:07.360
 or college is thinking about

3:54:07.360 --> 3:54:09.360
 what to do with their career

3:54:09.360 --> 3:54:11.360
 can have a successful career

3:54:11.360 --> 3:54:13.360
 or to have a life they can be proud of

3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:15.360
 what would you tell them?

3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:17.360
 I'd say probably the most important advice that I would give

3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:19.360
 is to find a way to give

3:54:19.360 --> 3:54:21.360
 value to other people

3:54:21.360 --> 3:54:23.360
 this is really the key thing

3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:25.360
 you need to wake up every morning

3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:27.360
 and figure out how to serve others

3:54:27.360 --> 3:54:29.360
 this is the key to

3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:31.360
 everything you want in life

3:54:31.360 --> 3:54:33.360
 is on the other side of you

3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:35.360
 serving others so figure out

3:54:35.360 --> 3:54:37.360
 how you can serve others in a good way

3:54:37.360 --> 3:54:39.360
 how you can do it in a way that they value

3:54:39.360 --> 3:54:41.360
 and you've got an incredible

3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:43.360
 mechanism for figuring that out

3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:45.360
 which is the market

3:54:45.360 --> 3:54:47.360
 go out there and do things for other people

3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:49.360
 and you know the market will tell you

3:54:49.360 --> 3:54:51.360
 the market will tell you exactly

3:54:51.360 --> 3:54:53.360
 if you're young you have the enormous

3:54:53.360 --> 3:54:55.360
 advantage of being able to make

3:54:55.360 --> 3:54:57.360
 mistakes essentially and learn from them

3:54:57.360 --> 3:54:59.360
 so

3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:01.360
 go out there do things of value for others

3:55:01.360 --> 3:55:03.360
 figuring out how

3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:05.360
 you can do something

3:55:05.360 --> 3:55:07.360
 what is it that you can do

3:55:07.360 --> 3:55:09.360
 that contributes the most value to other people's lives

3:55:09.360 --> 3:55:11.360
 and increasingly

3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:13.360
 I think with modern technology

3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:15.360
 this is increasingly becoming online

3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:17.360
 and it's

3:55:17.360 --> 3:55:19.360
 I think you should consider how you can

3:55:19.360 --> 3:55:21.360
 create value online

3:55:21.360 --> 3:55:23.360
 because that scales

3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:25.360
 beyond anything that you can do

3:55:25.360 --> 3:55:27.360
 in the physical world

3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:29.360
 well maybe not beyond obviously

3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:31.360
 there are profitable businesses

3:55:31.360 --> 3:55:33.360
 in the physical world

3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:35.360
 but I think online is enormous

3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:37.360
 potential and coding

3:55:37.360 --> 3:55:39.360
 I think is enormously powerful

3:55:39.360 --> 3:55:41.360
 I'm not a coder myself but I strongly recommend

3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:43.360
 people get into learning how to code

3:55:43.360 --> 3:55:45.360
 and I think

3:55:45.360 --> 3:55:47.360
 it's probably the thing that carries the most

3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:49.360
 power

3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:51.360
 so initially we were working with our hands

3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:53.360
 we started working with machines

3:55:53.360 --> 3:55:55.360
 machines are much more productive

3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:57.360
 and even higher level of productivity

3:55:57.360 --> 3:55:59.360
 where you basically

3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:01.360
 program the machines to produce things

3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:03.360
 so

3:56:03.360 --> 3:56:05.360
 few clicks of a keyboard

3:56:05.360 --> 3:56:07.360
 and you can move millions of machines

3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:09.360
 around the world in certain ways

3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:11.360
 so it carries an enormous amount of value

3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:13.360
 I think

3:56:13.360 --> 3:56:15.360
 I always tell all young people to learn to code

3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:17.360
 it's the best thing

3:56:17.360 --> 3:56:19.360
 I used to tell it to my students when I was at university

3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:21.360
 tell them to drop out and go learn to code

3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:23.360
 it's probably a better use of their time and money

3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:25.360
 we could probably do both

3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:27.360
 university has an interesting function

3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:29.360
 I mean probably

3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:31.360
 you and I have different perspective on this

3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:33.360
 probably has to do with a little bit of a different journey

3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:35.360
 in terms of

3:56:35.360 --> 3:56:37.360
 fields because I'm so

3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:39.360
 I've stayed engineering focused for a long time

3:56:39.360 --> 3:56:41.360
 and there's less some of the troubles you might

3:56:41.360 --> 3:56:43.360
 highlight in the education system

3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:45.360
 there's less troubles of that kind

3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:47.360
 in engineering

3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:49.360
 because math hasn't changed for a long time

3:56:49.360 --> 3:56:51.360
 so

3:56:51.360 --> 3:56:53.360
 a lot of it is just doing hard things

3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:55.360
 being forced to do hard things

3:56:55.360 --> 3:56:57.360
 and becoming a bit of a generalist

3:56:57.360 --> 3:56:59.360
 while on the side you're also

3:56:59.360 --> 3:57:01.360
 becoming a specialist

3:57:01.360 --> 3:57:03.360
 based on your own passion

3:57:03.360 --> 3:57:05.360
 driven by your own passion so

3:57:05.360 --> 3:57:07.360
 school at least high school I don't know about the

3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:09.360
 university but high school

3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:11.360
 has a really nice

3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:13.360
 one of the only times in your life

3:57:13.360 --> 3:57:15.360
 at least in my life

3:57:15.360 --> 3:57:17.360
 I was forced

3:57:17.360 --> 3:57:19.360
 but now I see

3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:21.360
 given the opportunity to spend

3:57:21.360 --> 3:57:23.360
 my entire day learning

3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:25.360
 broadly and that's something

3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:27.360
 I don't know the way time works

3:57:27.360 --> 3:57:29.360
 it just runs away from you and you never really get a chance to do

3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:31.360
 learn quite that broadly

3:57:31.360 --> 3:57:33.360
 again

3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:35.360
 that's the curse of specialization

3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:37.360
 is you kind of never get a chance

3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:39.360
 to study biology, chemistry

3:57:39.360 --> 3:57:41.360
 if you're a physicist

3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:43.360
 time runs away from you

3:57:43.360 --> 3:57:45.360
 so enjoy the broad

3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:47.360
 the broad education

3:57:47.360 --> 3:57:49.360
 but like you said

3:57:49.360 --> 3:57:51.360
 find the things that

3:57:51.360 --> 3:57:53.360
 valued by the market

3:57:53.360 --> 3:57:55.360
 and on the other side of it

3:57:55.360 --> 3:57:57.360
 you said all the good stuff so

3:57:57.360 --> 3:57:59.360
 that's also a way to get happiness

3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:01.360
 and I also add the horse

3:58:01.360 --> 3:58:03.360
 that I like to whip all the time is

3:58:03.360 --> 3:58:05.360
 the low time preference aspect of things

3:58:05.360 --> 3:58:07.360
 saving with bitcoin

3:58:07.360 --> 3:58:09.360
 so I think my advice to young people is

3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:11.360
 when you're young you think

3:58:11.360 --> 3:58:13.360
 of the world in a very short term

3:58:13.360 --> 3:58:15.360
 generally you're focused

3:58:15.360 --> 3:58:17.360
 on the present and you think that everything that's happening

3:58:17.360 --> 3:58:19.360
 in the present is the most important thing

3:58:19.360 --> 3:58:21.360
 that's ever going to happen in the history of humanity

3:58:21.360 --> 3:58:23.360
 lower your time preference

3:58:23.360 --> 3:58:25.360
 think about the future, think further down the line

3:58:25.360 --> 3:58:27.360
 think about the consequences of things

3:58:27.360 --> 3:58:29.360
 you do and then what

3:58:29.360 --> 3:58:31.360
 so you do this now, it feels good today

3:58:31.360 --> 3:58:33.360
 but then what happens tomorrow

3:58:33.360 --> 3:58:35.360
 you go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself

3:58:35.360 --> 3:58:37.360
 think about the hangover

3:58:37.360 --> 3:58:39.360
 but in long term

3:58:39.360 --> 3:58:41.360
 think about the implication of living this kind of life

3:58:41.360 --> 3:58:43.360
 think about

3:58:43.360 --> 3:58:45.360
 every decision that you make

3:58:45.360 --> 3:58:47.360
 the long term implication of it

3:58:47.360 --> 3:58:49.360
 and part of that is bitcoin

3:58:49.360 --> 3:58:51.360
 part of that is save in bitcoin

3:58:51.360 --> 3:58:53.360
 I urge everybody to put savings

3:58:53.360 --> 3:58:55.360
 in bitcoin for the long term

3:58:55.360 --> 3:58:57.360
 don't buy bitcoin for the short term

3:58:57.360 --> 3:58:59.360
 don't buy bitcoin today so that you can sell it

3:58:59.360 --> 3:59:01.360
 don't put your savings in bitcoin today

3:59:01.360 --> 3:59:03.360
 so that you can sell it all next month

3:59:03.360 --> 3:59:05.360
 and buy a house

3:59:05.360 --> 3:59:07.360
 put money in bitcoin that you expect to

3:59:07.360 --> 3:59:09.360
 keep in bitcoin for another

3:59:09.360 --> 3:59:11.360
 5, 10 years

3:59:11.360 --> 3:59:13.360
 at least 4 years is what I recommend

3:59:13.360 --> 3:59:15.360
 for people so keep a low time

3:59:15.360 --> 3:59:17.360
 preference, focus on the future and save in bitcoin

3:59:17.360 --> 3:59:19.360
 and

3:59:19.360 --> 3:59:21.360
 learn about how to buy bitcoin

3:59:21.360 --> 3:59:23.360
 how to learn about all this technology

3:59:23.360 --> 3:59:25.360
 part of this is this conversation but there's so much awesome material out there

3:59:25.360 --> 3:59:27.360
 and thank you by the way

3:59:27.360 --> 3:59:29.360
 for this gift of a hardware wallet

3:59:29.360 --> 3:59:31.360
 nice

3:59:31.360 --> 3:59:33.360
 so you should definitely invest in it yourself

3:59:33.360 --> 3:59:35.360
 and

3:59:35.360 --> 3:59:37.360
 what would you call this, these are

3:59:37.360 --> 3:59:39.360
 open dimes

3:59:39.360 --> 3:59:41.360
 so this is like USB

3:59:41.360 --> 3:59:43.360
 like a hardware device that stores bitcoin

3:59:43.360 --> 3:59:45.360
 so you don't have to worry about

3:59:45.360 --> 3:59:47.360
 knowing the

3:59:47.360 --> 3:59:49.360
 password, it contains the password within it

3:59:49.360 --> 3:59:51.360
 and it's tamper proof so you can save the bitcoin on it

3:59:51.360 --> 3:59:53.360
 so when the apocalypse comes

3:59:53.360 --> 3:59:55.360
 you need

3:59:55.360 --> 3:59:57.360
 the value to be stored

3:59:57.360 --> 3:59:59.360
 an actual thing that you can have in your physical possession

3:59:59.360 --> 4:00:01.360
 that's exactly what this is

4:00:01.360 --> 4:00:03.360
 you've had a heck of a life

4:00:03.360 --> 4:00:05.360
 you've been

4:00:05.360 --> 4:00:07.360
 in a bunch of places in this world

4:00:07.360 --> 4:00:09.360
 a lot of places

4:00:09.360 --> 4:00:11.360
 life is not easy in some of those places

4:00:11.360 --> 4:00:13.360
 what has been

4:00:13.360 --> 4:00:15.360
 if you can take a step to

4:00:15.360 --> 4:00:17.360
 to maybe

4:00:17.360 --> 4:00:19.360
 a bit of a dark step for a short time

4:00:19.360 --> 4:00:21.360
 what has been a

4:00:21.360 --> 4:00:23.360
 maybe darkest time

4:00:23.360 --> 4:00:25.360
 period place you've ever got in your mind

4:00:25.360 --> 4:00:27.360
 a dark period of your life

4:00:27.360 --> 4:00:29.360
 a struggle

4:00:29.360 --> 4:00:31.360
 they had to overcome, they had to survive

4:00:31.360 --> 4:00:33.360
 well, I'm Palestinian

4:00:33.360 --> 4:00:35.360
 so that is the

4:00:35.360 --> 4:00:37.360
 tragedy of my life, I'm Palestinian

4:00:37.360 --> 4:00:39.360
 Jordanian

4:00:39.360 --> 4:00:41.360
 my family's

4:00:41.360 --> 4:00:43.360
 suffered a lot because of this

4:00:43.360 --> 4:00:45.360
 historically, I grew up

4:00:45.360 --> 4:00:47.360
 in Ramallah in the West Bank

4:00:47.360 --> 4:00:49.360
 wasn't

4:00:49.360 --> 4:00:51.360
 ideal to see that

4:00:51.360 --> 4:00:53.360
 people like to think of it as this

4:00:53.360 --> 4:00:55.360
 intractable conflict between two bitter enemies

4:00:55.360 --> 4:00:57.360
 but

4:00:57.360 --> 4:00:59.360
 the reality of the matter is that it's not

4:00:59.360 --> 4:01:01.360
 a foreign ideology came in

4:01:01.360 --> 4:01:03.360
 with the idea that this country needs to be

4:01:03.360 --> 4:01:05.360
 occupied by people from

4:01:05.360 --> 4:01:07.360
 only one religion

4:01:07.360 --> 4:01:09.360
 and the existing population

4:01:09.360 --> 4:01:11.360
 Jews had always lived in Palestine

4:01:11.360 --> 4:01:13.360
 historically

4:01:13.360 --> 4:01:15.360
 and at the turn of the 20th century

4:01:15.360 --> 4:01:17.360
 they were only 10% of the population

4:01:17.360 --> 4:01:19.360
 but then with the birth of fiat money

4:01:19.360 --> 4:01:21.360
 incidentally, the link

4:01:21.360 --> 4:01:23.360
 with all of this is that

4:01:23.360 --> 4:01:25.360
 when the Bank of England went off gold

4:01:25.360 --> 4:01:27.360
 a big reason why they were able

4:01:27.360 --> 4:01:29.360
 to pull that off was that the Rothschild

4:01:29.360 --> 4:01:31.360
 banking family supported them

4:01:31.360 --> 4:01:33.360
 in exchange the Rothschilds got Palestine

4:01:33.360 --> 4:01:35.360
 and

4:01:35.360 --> 4:01:37.360
 the Balfour Declaration

4:01:37.360 --> 4:01:39.360
 was written by the government

4:01:39.360 --> 4:01:41.360
 of Britain to the Rothschild family

4:01:41.360 --> 4:01:43.360
 telling them that

4:01:43.360 --> 4:01:45.360
 they

4:01:45.360 --> 4:01:47.360
 liked to make

4:01:47.360 --> 4:01:49.360
 Palestine a homeland for Jews

4:01:49.360 --> 4:01:51.360
 so obviously that's not very

4:01:51.360 --> 4:01:53.360
 convenient for people who are not Jewish

4:01:53.360 --> 4:01:55.360
 for whom that is a homeland

4:01:55.360 --> 4:01:57.360
 and the past 80 years has been

4:01:57.360 --> 4:01:59.360
 a very painful struggle

4:01:59.360 --> 4:02:01.360
 if you happen to not be Jewish

4:02:01.360 --> 4:02:03.360
 and obviously

4:02:03.360 --> 4:02:05.360
 Palestinians have done all kinds of things

4:02:05.360 --> 4:02:07.360
 trying to fight back and they've done

4:02:07.360 --> 4:02:09.360
 all kinds of wrong things

4:02:09.360 --> 4:02:11.360
 but I don't think you can escape the fundamental

4:02:11.360 --> 4:02:13.360
 reality underlying this which is that

4:02:13.360 --> 4:02:15.360
 if you're not Jewish

4:02:15.360 --> 4:02:17.360
 you are being moved out of the land

4:02:17.360 --> 4:02:19.360
 and so it's happened in 1947

4:02:19.360 --> 4:02:21.360
 1948

4:02:21.360 --> 4:02:23.360
 it happened in 1976

4:02:23.360 --> 4:02:25.360
 1967

4:02:25.360 --> 4:02:27.360
 more land was taken over by Israel

4:02:27.360 --> 4:02:29.360
 and the settlements

4:02:29.360 --> 4:02:31.360
 if you ignore the day to day headlines

4:02:31.360 --> 4:02:33.360
 and you ignore the media propaganda

4:02:33.360 --> 4:02:35.360
 and you ignore all of this

4:02:35.360 --> 4:02:37.360
 there's a very clear thing that is happening

4:02:37.360 --> 4:02:39.360
 which is more land

4:02:39.360 --> 4:02:41.360
 owned by an exclusive

4:02:41.360 --> 4:02:43.360
 ideology that believes this land

4:02:43.360 --> 4:02:45.360
 needs to be owned by people from one religion

4:02:45.360 --> 4:02:47.360
 and everybody else is being

4:02:47.360 --> 4:02:49.360
 kicked out and so

4:02:51.360 --> 4:02:53.360
 that is the tragedy of my life

4:02:53.360 --> 4:02:55.360
 and my wife is also a Palestinian refugee

4:02:55.360 --> 4:02:57.360
 in Lebanon and her family

4:02:57.360 --> 4:02:59.360
 was evicted from

4:02:59.360 --> 4:03:01.360
 Yaffa which is today

4:03:01.360 --> 4:03:03.360
 on the outskirts of Tel Aviv

4:03:03.360 --> 4:03:05.360
 they still have their homes

4:03:05.360 --> 4:03:07.360
 in Yaffa their homes are being

4:03:07.360 --> 4:03:09.360
 kicked out of their homes and their lands

4:03:09.360 --> 4:03:11.360
 and their property they became refugees in Lebanon

4:03:11.360 --> 4:03:13.360
 so my children

4:03:13.360 --> 4:03:15.360
 it's an ongoing tragedy

4:03:15.360 --> 4:03:17.360
 it's not something that is

4:03:17.360 --> 4:03:19.360
 a lot of the people that

4:03:19.360 --> 4:03:21.360
 think of it as

4:03:21.360 --> 4:03:23.360
 they think Palestinians are just out there to get

4:03:23.360 --> 4:03:25.360
 Israelis because they hate them

4:03:25.360 --> 4:03:27.360
 but it's an inescapable tragedy

4:03:27.360 --> 4:03:29.360
 I don't have a home anywhere

4:03:29.360 --> 4:03:31.360
 is there an escape from this tragedy

4:03:31.360 --> 4:03:33.360
 in the future that you see

4:03:33.360 --> 4:03:35.360
 if you zoom out across the

4:03:35.360 --> 4:03:37.360
 scale of decades

4:03:37.360 --> 4:03:39.360
 will we see

4:03:41.360 --> 4:03:43.360
 I hesitate to say peace

4:03:43.360 --> 4:03:45.360
 but

4:03:47.360 --> 4:03:49.360
 a significant decrease

4:03:49.360 --> 4:03:51.360
 in human suffering in this part of the region

4:03:51.360 --> 4:03:53.360
 I certainly hope so

4:03:53.360 --> 4:03:55.360
 and I think

4:03:55.360 --> 4:03:57.360
 my interest in Bitcoin comes from

4:03:57.360 --> 4:03:59.360
 came from a place of desperation

4:03:59.360 --> 4:04:01.360
 with the situation there

4:04:01.360 --> 4:04:03.360
 traditional politics is

4:04:03.360 --> 4:04:05.360
 a dead end

4:04:05.360 --> 4:04:07.360
 I don't see what I

4:04:07.360 --> 4:04:09.360
 can be doing to make things better there

4:04:09.360 --> 4:04:11.360
 using traditional politics

4:04:11.360 --> 4:04:13.360
 and I think a good friend of mine

4:04:13.360 --> 4:04:15.360
 Pierre Rochard you may know him on Twitter

4:04:15.360 --> 4:04:17.360
 one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin

4:04:17.360 --> 4:04:19.360
 in my opinion he told me

4:04:19.360 --> 4:04:21.360
 his theory is that Bitcoin is going to bring

4:04:21.360 --> 4:04:23.360
 peace to the Middle East because land

4:04:23.360 --> 4:04:25.360
 is a shit coin

4:04:25.360 --> 4:04:27.360
 and land is a shit coin

4:04:27.360 --> 4:04:29.360
 I love it and I think he's got a very good

4:04:29.360 --> 4:04:31.360
 point there that this fixation

4:04:31.360 --> 4:04:33.360
 with land and the bitterness

4:04:33.360 --> 4:04:35.360
 with which people have to

4:04:35.360 --> 4:04:37.360
 with land is likely

4:04:37.360 --> 4:04:39.360
 to decline when people are going to have

4:04:39.360 --> 4:04:41.360
 a form of property that they can

4:04:41.360 --> 4:04:43.360
 keep and so

4:04:43.360 --> 4:04:45.360
 hopefully that will help in one way

4:04:45.360 --> 4:04:47.360
 and of course the more obvious way

4:04:47.360 --> 4:04:49.360
 that this is a conflict of

4:04:49.360 --> 4:04:51.360
 governments and it's a conflict that is

4:04:51.360 --> 4:04:53.360
 financed by fiat and from day one

4:04:53.360 --> 4:04:55.360
 you know the entirely

4:04:55.360 --> 4:04:57.360
 insane notion that you could

4:04:57.360 --> 4:04:59.360
 build a national

4:04:59.360 --> 4:05:01.360
 an ethnic homeland

4:05:01.360 --> 4:05:03.360
 and of course you know this is the early

4:05:03.360 --> 4:05:05.360
 20th century so

4:05:05.360 --> 4:05:07.360
 the idea behind Zionism

4:05:07.360 --> 4:05:09.360
 is coming from the same place where

4:05:09.360 --> 4:05:11.360
 all these other ethnic nationalisms

4:05:11.360 --> 4:05:13.360
 of Europe were emerging and we saw how

4:05:13.360 --> 4:05:15.360
 well how

4:05:15.360 --> 4:05:17.360
 horribly these worked out but the idea that

4:05:17.360 --> 4:05:19.360
 you could you know

4:05:19.360 --> 4:05:21.360
 it's one thing to say we want to build a homeland

4:05:21.360 --> 4:05:23.360
 for Germans in Germany

4:05:23.360 --> 4:05:25.360
 it's one thing to say we want to build a homeland

4:05:25.360 --> 4:05:27.360
 for Germans somewhere else

4:05:27.360 --> 4:05:29.360
 and that was

4:05:29.360 --> 4:05:31.360
 that was

4:05:31.360 --> 4:05:33.360
 Palestine that was Zionism and that was

4:05:33.360 --> 4:05:35.360
 only possible thanks to fiat thanks to the

4:05:35.360 --> 4:05:37.360
 ability of the British government and

4:05:37.360 --> 4:05:39.360
 all these other governments to continue to

4:05:39.360 --> 4:05:41.360
 finance this colonialist effort over time

4:05:41.360 --> 4:05:43.360
 and

4:05:43.360 --> 4:05:45.360
 you know it continues to finance war

4:05:45.360 --> 4:05:47.360
 and it continues you know we see

4:05:47.360 --> 4:05:49.360
 war all over the world continue to

4:05:49.360 --> 4:05:51.360
 escalate because

4:05:51.360 --> 4:05:53.360
 the people who make the decision to

4:05:53.360 --> 4:05:55.360
 escalate the war are not the ones who are paying

4:05:55.360 --> 4:05:57.360
 for it and they're not the ones who are fighting

4:05:57.360 --> 4:05:59.360
 they're the ones who sit in offices and in

4:05:59.360 --> 4:06:01.360
 the case of you know most of Middle

4:06:01.360 --> 4:06:03.360
 Eastern conflict it's

4:06:03.360 --> 4:06:05.360
 it's people who live abroad you know it's

4:06:05.360 --> 4:06:07.360
 people who are abroad are not part of it who just

4:06:07.360 --> 4:06:09.360
 are emotionally charged to it because

4:06:09.360 --> 4:06:11.360
 they watch it on TV so

4:06:11.360 --> 4:06:13.360
 you know you have billions of Muslims

4:06:13.360 --> 4:06:15.360
 around the world and

4:06:15.360 --> 4:06:17.360
 Jews around the world who feel

4:06:17.360 --> 4:06:19.360
 extremely emotionally attached to it

4:06:19.360 --> 4:06:21.360
 they're not the ones fighting they're not the ones paying

4:06:21.360 --> 4:06:23.360
 their own money they're just getting

4:06:23.360 --> 4:06:25.360
 governments to send money and to send

4:06:25.360 --> 4:06:27.360
 weapons and to take part

4:06:27.360 --> 4:06:29.360
 and it's

4:06:29.360 --> 4:06:31.360
 it's fun

4:06:31.360 --> 4:06:33.360
 as a spectator sport for most of these

4:06:33.360 --> 4:06:35.360
 people because they don't get to live in it

4:06:35.360 --> 4:06:37.360
 but I got to live in it I saw it I grew

4:06:37.360 --> 4:06:39.360
 up there I saw

4:06:39.360 --> 4:06:41.360
 the settlement expansion and you know

4:06:41.360 --> 4:06:43.360
 recently a few weeks ago I went back to

4:06:43.360 --> 4:06:45.360
 Ramallah and it's just

4:06:45.360 --> 4:06:47.360
 it's amazing every time you go

4:06:47.360 --> 4:06:49.360
 the the settlements are just growing in

4:06:49.360 --> 4:06:51.360
 an astonishing way like it's

4:06:51.360 --> 4:06:53.360
 it's not just

4:06:53.360 --> 4:06:55.360
 housing units that are going up it's

4:06:55.360 --> 4:06:57.360
 an entire attempt to build

4:06:57.360 --> 4:06:59.360
 to basically

4:06:59.360 --> 4:07:01.360
 suffocate Palestinian areas

4:07:01.360 --> 4:07:03.360
 and force Palestinians to leave or

4:07:03.360 --> 4:07:05.360
 keep them living in horrific

4:07:05.360 --> 4:07:07.360
 conditions

4:07:07.360 --> 4:07:09.360
 and if I may

4:07:09.360 --> 4:07:11.360
 just because I have family in Ukraine

4:07:11.360 --> 4:07:13.360
 I have family in Russia

4:07:13.360 --> 4:07:15.360
 since this war

4:07:15.360 --> 4:07:17.360
 echoes of similar things are happening

4:07:17.360 --> 4:07:19.360
 in that part of the world too

4:07:19.360 --> 4:07:20.360
 and I

4:07:20.360 --> 4:07:22.360
 shudder to think about the decades

4:07:22.360 --> 4:07:23.360
 to come

4:07:23.360 --> 4:07:25.360
 of the hate that is brewing

4:07:25.360 --> 4:07:27.360
 the suffering that is brewing

4:07:27.360 --> 4:07:29.360
 based on decisions and

4:07:29.360 --> 4:07:31.360
 pressures and

4:07:31.360 --> 4:07:33.360
 from not always

4:07:33.360 --> 4:07:35.360
 people directly

4:07:35.360 --> 4:07:37.360
 impacted by this so again

4:07:37.360 --> 4:07:39.360
 it feels like that

4:07:39.360 --> 4:07:41.360
 military conflict is not

4:07:41.360 --> 4:07:43.360
 just a creation of

4:07:43.360 --> 4:07:45.360
 like people on the ground

4:07:45.360 --> 4:07:47.360
 it's a creation of leaders power centers

4:07:47.360 --> 4:07:49.360
 and

4:07:49.360 --> 4:07:51.360
 and perhaps

4:07:51.360 --> 4:07:53.360
 again I'm not smart enough but even the

4:07:53.360 --> 4:07:55.360
 monetary system probably has a role to play

4:07:55.360 --> 4:07:57.360
 I absolutely think it does

4:07:57.360 --> 4:07:59.360
 monetary system is what allows

4:07:59.360 --> 4:08:01.360
 is what allows people to just continue

4:08:01.360 --> 4:08:03.360
 to treat war as a spectator sport

4:08:03.360 --> 4:08:05.360
 that's really what it comes down to

4:08:05.360 --> 4:08:07.360
 and starts with World War I

4:08:07.360 --> 4:08:09.360
 and it's continued and this is why

4:08:09.360 --> 4:08:11.360
 really I think

4:08:11.360 --> 4:08:13.360
 I've said this before

4:08:13.360 --> 4:08:15.360
 I've tweeted this before and it was a pretty popular tweet

4:08:15.360 --> 4:08:17.360
 but it also got a lot of people

4:08:17.360 --> 4:08:19.360
 to dismiss

4:08:19.360 --> 4:08:21.360
 the idea with mockery of course

4:08:21.360 --> 4:08:23.360
 but I really think Bitcoin is the only

4:08:23.360 --> 4:08:25.360
 technology that's going to end World War I

4:08:25.360 --> 4:08:27.360
 once World War I

4:08:27.360 --> 4:08:29.360
 started we got into this endless

4:08:29.360 --> 4:08:31.360
 conflict it's been going on going since then

4:08:31.360 --> 4:08:33.360
 if you look at all the world's conflicts today

4:08:33.360 --> 4:08:35.360
 pretty much they all trace back to World War I

4:08:35.360 --> 4:08:37.360
 and it's because

4:08:37.360 --> 4:08:39.360
 when that Pandora's

4:08:39.360 --> 4:08:41.360
 box of government control of money was

4:08:41.360 --> 4:08:43.360
 opened there was no longer

4:08:43.360 --> 4:08:45.360
 a real restraint on war except

4:08:45.360 --> 4:08:47.360
 complete defeat and complete destruction

4:08:47.360 --> 4:08:49.360
 and complete death the war had to be total

4:08:49.360 --> 4:08:51.360
 before that you know

4:08:51.360 --> 4:08:53.360
 under the gold standard

4:08:53.360 --> 4:08:55.360
 Kings would

4:08:55.360 --> 4:08:57.360
 send professional armies to fight

4:08:57.360 --> 4:08:59.360
 each other in battlefields

4:08:59.360 --> 4:09:01.360
 and as soon as it became clear

4:09:01.360 --> 4:09:03.360
 that one side was establishing

4:09:03.360 --> 4:09:05.360
 an advantage the fighting would stop

4:09:05.360 --> 4:09:07.360
 and the king

4:09:07.360 --> 4:09:09.360
 would settle

4:09:09.360 --> 4:09:11.360
 you know would agree to new terms

4:09:11.360 --> 4:09:13.360
 because it was extremely expensive

4:09:13.360 --> 4:09:15.360
 to build a professional army

4:09:15.360 --> 4:09:17.360
 and you ran out of money so it was always

4:09:17.360 --> 4:09:19.360
 the smartest thing to do is to just stop

4:09:19.360 --> 4:09:21.360
 fighting whenever you could

4:09:21.360 --> 4:09:23.360
 and wars would take place you know

4:09:23.360 --> 4:09:25.360
 countries would fight each other in the battlefield

4:09:25.360 --> 4:09:27.360
 but in the cities life went on as normal

4:09:27.360 --> 4:09:29.360
 and people within the same cities

4:09:29.360 --> 4:09:31.360
 within the cities of the two countries

4:09:31.360 --> 4:09:33.360
 would be trading with one another

4:09:33.360 --> 4:09:35.360
 life would go on but the war would be there

4:09:35.360 --> 4:09:37.360
 and it was just

4:09:37.360 --> 4:09:39.360
 an independent

4:09:39.360 --> 4:09:41.360
 part of politics that

4:09:41.360 --> 4:09:43.360
 alright we have a problem over this piece of land

4:09:43.360 --> 4:09:45.360
 let's do it and you know let's take it outside

4:09:45.360 --> 4:09:47.360
 we don't fight in the civilian

4:09:47.360 --> 4:09:49.360
 areas we go to the battlefield

4:09:49.360 --> 4:09:51.360
 we fight with professional armies and in fact

4:09:51.360 --> 4:09:53.360
 sometimes the conflicts would be

4:09:53.360 --> 4:09:55.360
 you know the armies would line up

4:09:55.360 --> 4:09:57.360
 and they would just have a small

4:09:57.360 --> 4:09:59.360
 contingent of the two armies

4:09:59.360 --> 4:10:01.360
 fight with one another and as soon as one of them

4:10:01.360 --> 4:10:03.360
 establishes an advantage then

4:10:03.360 --> 4:10:05.360
 alright well you won

4:10:05.360 --> 4:10:07.360
 let's move on with it

4:10:07.360 --> 4:10:09.360
 governments were far far far more

4:10:09.360 --> 4:10:11.360
 careful about

4:10:11.360 --> 4:10:13.360
 their monetary policy

4:10:13.360 --> 4:10:15.360
 and their sorry their war

4:10:15.360 --> 4:10:17.360
 policy when they couldn't print their money

4:10:17.360 --> 4:10:19.360
 and that has changed with fiat

4:10:19.360 --> 4:10:21.360
 and that has allowed this

4:10:21.360 --> 4:10:23.360
 new emergence of this class of what I like to call

4:10:23.360 --> 4:10:25.360
 chicken hawks

4:10:25.360 --> 4:10:27.360
 of people who sit in office like the entire

4:10:27.360 --> 4:10:29.360
 foreign policy establishment

4:10:29.360 --> 4:10:31.360
 in washington dc

4:10:31.360 --> 4:10:33.360
 people who have never fought a war

4:10:33.360 --> 4:10:35.360
 whose children will never fight a war

4:10:35.360 --> 4:10:37.360
 who will never pay to fight a war

4:10:37.360 --> 4:10:39.360
 who will never suffer a broken

4:10:39.360 --> 4:10:41.360
 window in their house because of war

4:10:41.360 --> 4:10:43.360
 sitting there and based on

4:10:43.360 --> 4:10:45.360
 these fucking moronic

4:10:45.360 --> 4:10:47.360
 garbage that they teach at

4:10:47.360 --> 4:10:49.360
 moronic fiat universities about politics

4:10:49.360 --> 4:10:51.360
 and geopolitics making decisions

4:10:51.360 --> 4:10:53.360
 about you know we need to invade that country

4:10:53.360 --> 4:10:55.360
 and we need to send war there and

4:10:55.360 --> 4:10:57.360
 they can do that because they have this endless money printer

4:10:57.360 --> 4:10:59.360
 where and that's why

4:10:59.360 --> 4:11:01.360
 you know back under gold

4:11:01.360 --> 4:11:03.360
 if you wear a warrior you know

4:11:03.360 --> 4:11:05.360
 you went and actually joined the war

4:11:05.360 --> 4:11:07.360
 and that you know

4:11:07.360 --> 4:11:09.360
 the people who pontificated about war

4:11:09.360 --> 4:11:11.360
 where the people who had experience with war

4:11:11.360 --> 4:11:13.360
 the people who were sending their own children to war

4:11:13.360 --> 4:11:15.360
 the people who were fighting with their own money

4:11:15.360 --> 4:11:17.360
 now you have all these

4:11:17.360 --> 4:11:19.360
 fat parasitics come sitting in washington

4:11:19.360 --> 4:11:21.360
 and dc deciding and washington

4:11:21.360 --> 4:11:23.360
 is just an example but all over the world this exists

4:11:23.360 --> 4:11:25.360
 people who have never fought

4:11:25.360 --> 4:11:27.360
 will never carry the consequences

4:11:27.360 --> 4:11:29.360
 we're going to devalue the world's money

4:11:29.360 --> 4:11:31.360
 in order to go and

4:11:31.360 --> 4:11:33.360
 have other people's children

4:11:33.360 --> 4:11:35.360
 fight each other because of

4:11:35.360 --> 4:11:37.360
 stupid garbage they learned about

4:11:37.360 --> 4:11:39.360
 politics in university

4:11:39.360 --> 4:11:41.360
 you said

4:11:41.360 --> 4:11:43.360
 you value low time preference

4:11:43.360 --> 4:11:45.360
 but I have news for you

4:11:45.360 --> 4:11:47.360
 that one day you will die

4:11:47.360 --> 4:11:49.360
 as far as we know

4:11:49.360 --> 4:11:51.360
 you're a mortal being

4:11:51.360 --> 4:11:53.360
 do you think about your death

4:11:53.360 --> 4:11:55.360
 do you think about your mortality

4:11:55.360 --> 4:11:57.360
 are you afraid of it

4:11:57.360 --> 4:11:59.360
 I

4:11:59.360 --> 4:12:01.360
 spent a lot of time

4:12:01.360 --> 4:12:03.360
 introspecting and thinking about these things

4:12:03.360 --> 4:12:05.360
 and I value life a lot

4:12:05.360 --> 4:12:07.360
 I value my time on earth a lot

4:12:07.360 --> 4:12:09.360
 and you'll see this

4:12:09.360 --> 4:12:11.360
 in my dealings with people

4:12:11.360 --> 4:12:13.360
 you know go back to twitter

4:12:13.360 --> 4:12:15.360
 why am I so brash and straight forward

4:12:15.360 --> 4:12:17.360
 it really is because life is short

4:12:17.360 --> 4:12:19.360
 because I don't want to waste

4:12:19.360 --> 4:12:21.360
 I think you know on my

4:12:21.360 --> 4:12:23.360
 I've

4:12:23.360 --> 4:12:25.360
 said this before

4:12:25.360 --> 4:12:27.360
 on my tombstone let it be written

4:12:27.360 --> 4:12:29.360
 he never let anyone waste his time

4:12:29.360 --> 4:12:31.360
 twice in his life

4:12:31.360 --> 4:12:33.360
 his life is short

4:12:33.360 --> 4:12:35.360
 yeah you can waste my time once

4:12:35.360 --> 4:12:37.360
 you can get me to do something and then I realize

4:12:37.360 --> 4:12:39.360
 that was a waste of time you will never get me to waste my time

4:12:39.360 --> 4:12:41.360
 twice and so you show up

4:12:41.360 --> 4:12:43.360
 in my twitter with something stupid

4:12:43.360 --> 4:12:45.360
 showing up in my twitter

4:12:45.360 --> 4:12:47.360
 you give people a chance but you're a fast learner

4:12:47.360 --> 4:12:49.360
 yeah so I try and

4:12:49.360 --> 4:12:51.360
 use my time very wisely and I

4:12:51.360 --> 4:12:53.360
 I'm unapologetic about it

4:12:53.360 --> 4:12:55.360
 my time is the most precious thing and like

4:12:55.360 --> 4:12:57.360
 the way to get on my shit side

4:12:57.360 --> 4:12:59.360
 on my shit list forever is to try

4:12:59.360 --> 4:13:01.360
 and take away my time

4:13:01.360 --> 4:13:03.360
 and to abuse my time if you do that

4:13:03.360 --> 4:13:05.360
 I'm

4:13:05.360 --> 4:13:07.360
 it's the one

4:13:07.360 --> 4:13:09.360
 unforgivable sin for me

4:13:09.360 --> 4:13:11.360
 and I think that's really I think

4:13:11.360 --> 4:13:13.360
 my way of coming to terms with mortality

4:13:13.360 --> 4:13:15.360
 we're all gonna die and so let's make the most out of it

4:13:15.360 --> 4:13:17.360
 while we're still here and of course the other way

4:13:17.360 --> 4:13:19.360
 you come to terms with mortality is you have children

4:13:21.360 --> 4:13:23.360
 given what you just said

4:13:23.360 --> 4:13:25.360
 um

4:13:25.360 --> 4:13:27.360
 doubly so it's a huge honor that you

4:13:27.360 --> 4:13:29.360
 will spend your valuable time with me

4:13:29.360 --> 4:13:31.360
 this is the first time you did it so you probably

4:13:31.360 --> 4:13:33.360
 regret all of it so

4:13:33.360 --> 4:13:35.360
 we'll probably never see each other again

4:13:35.360 --> 4:13:37.360
 but I'm glad you at least took the chance

4:13:37.360 --> 4:13:39.360
 to do it it's a huge honor

4:13:39.360 --> 4:13:41.360
 I've been a huge fan of yours

4:13:41.360 --> 4:13:43.360
 I think you have impact

4:13:43.360 --> 4:13:45.360
 on the world that you probably are not even

4:13:45.360 --> 4:13:47.360
 aware of it's tremendous

4:13:47.360 --> 4:13:49.360
 and a lot of people love you

4:13:49.360 --> 4:13:51.360
 and your work is important even

4:13:51.360 --> 4:13:53.360
 you know I disagree with some things

4:13:53.360 --> 4:13:55.360
 you say there's people that disagree with you

4:13:55.360 --> 4:13:57.360
 but everybody respects you

4:13:57.360 --> 4:13:59.360
 and thank you so much for spending your really valuable time

4:13:59.360 --> 4:14:01.360
 with me today brother thank you sir

4:14:01.360 --> 4:14:03.360

4:14:03.360 --> 4:14:05.360

 and now let me leave you with some words

4:14:13.360 --> 4:14:15.360
 from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek

4:14:17.360 --> 4:14:19.360
 economic control is not merely

4:14:19.360 --> 4:14:21.360
 control of a sector of human life

4:14:21.360 --> 4:14:23.360
 which can be separated from the rest

4:14:23.360 --> 4:14:25.360
 it is the control of the

4:14:25.360 --> 4:14:27.360
 means for all our ends

4:14:27.360 --> 4:14:29.360
 thank you for listening

4:14:29.360 --> 4:14:39.360
 and hope to see you next time
