00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Zev Weinstein, a young man with a brilliant, bold, and hopeful

00:05.680 --> 00:10.780
 mind that I had the great fortune of talking to on a recent afternoon.

00:10.780 --> 00:16.160
 He happens to be Eric Weinstein's son, but I invited Zev not because of that, but because

00:16.160 --> 00:21.400
 I got a chance to listen to him speak on a few occasions and was captivated by how deeply

00:21.400 --> 00:24.480
 he thought about this world at such a young age.

00:24.480 --> 00:29.360
 And I thought that it might be fun to explore this world of ours together with him for a

00:29.360 --> 00:32.000
 time through this conversation.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.880

00:53.040 --> 00:59.080
 As a side note, let me say that Zev acknowledges the fear associated with participating public

00:59.080 --> 01:04.840
 discourse and is brave enough to join in at a young age to push forward, to change his

01:04.840 --> 01:10.800
 mind publicly, to learn, to articulate difficult, nuanced ideas, and grow from the conversations

01:10.800 --> 01:12.040
 that follow.

01:12.040 --> 01:16.640
 In this, I hope he leads the next generation of minds that is joining and steering the

01:16.640 --> 01:23.560
 collective intelligence of this big ant colony we think of as our human civilization.

01:33.880 --> 01:39.160
 And now, here's my conversation with Zev Weinstein.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.120
 You've said that philosophy becomes more dangerous in difficult times.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.120
 What do you mean by that?

01:45.120 --> 01:48.640
 Interestingly, I think I mean two things by that.

01:48.640 --> 01:54.560
 And I think, firstly, I should clarify, when I say philosophy, I sort of mean in a very

01:54.560 --> 02:02.560
 traditional sense, just thinking, ideation, and that could be reconsidering our notions

02:02.560 --> 02:08.600
 of self in a very traditional sense, which we consider philosophy or that could be technological

02:08.600 --> 02:10.680
 innovation.

02:10.680 --> 02:16.400
 I think it's important to recognize all of these as philosophies that we can not question

02:16.400 --> 02:18.800
 whether it's important to promote thought.

02:18.800 --> 02:24.040
 I think the other thing I should clarify is when I say difficult times, I mean times

02:24.040 --> 02:32.000
 when nothing is growing and so the risk for real conflict is much greater because people

02:32.000 --> 02:37.200
 are incentivized to fight over the things which already exist.

02:37.200 --> 02:45.760
 I think when times are not difficult, the people with the greatest power are usually

02:45.760 --> 02:51.040
 the people who are very creative, generating a lot, and that really requires ideation or

02:51.040 --> 02:53.400
 philosophy of some sort.

02:53.400 --> 03:00.920
 I think when times become stagnant, the important successful people become the people who are

03:00.920 --> 03:07.880
 very good at protecting their own pieces of the pie and taking others.

03:07.880 --> 03:14.160
 I think that those people have to be very opposed to any sort of thinking that could

03:14.160 --> 03:22.160
 restructure society or conventions about who should succeed.

03:22.160 --> 03:32.320
 So firstly, I mean by that that it becomes much more dangerous for a person to think

03:32.320 --> 03:39.000
 deeply and question during a time when the important people are those concerned with

03:39.000 --> 03:41.640
 making sure no one rocks the boat.

03:41.640 --> 03:47.400
 One example of this would be Socrates and his execution because everyone was happy enough

03:47.400 --> 03:52.760
 to sit through his questions before there was war and poverty and distress and afterwards

03:52.760 --> 03:54.560
 it just became too dangerous.

03:54.560 --> 04:01.880
 The other thing I mean by that is that the consequences of thinking deeply carry much

04:01.880 --> 04:07.120
 greater potential for real catastrophe when everyone is desperate.

04:07.120 --> 04:15.880
 So for example, the Communist Manifesto was probably much more dangerous during early

04:15.880 --> 04:22.160
 1900s Russia than it was during the 1848 revolutions because I think people were in much worse

04:22.160 --> 04:29.200
 shape and desperate people are very willing to dive into anything new that might bring

04:29.200 --> 04:36.680
 the future without fully calculating whatever the consequences or risks might be.

04:36.680 --> 04:42.320
 So it is both more dangerous for a person to have creative ideas and those ideas are

04:42.320 --> 04:47.080
 more dangerous when times are tough.

04:47.080 --> 04:54.000
 And by dangerous you mean it challenges the people with power who want to maintain that

04:54.000 --> 05:00.960
 power in times of stagnation when there's not much growth, innovation, creativity, all

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
 that kind of stuff.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
 Right.

05:02.960 --> 05:10.760
 And I know that if nothing new is created, people have promises that they've made about

05:10.760 --> 05:14.680
 what will be paid to whom, what debt structure is.

05:14.680 --> 05:23.920
 The only possibility if stagnation lasts for long enough is really some kind of great conflict,

05:23.920 --> 05:28.760
 great war because people have to take from others to make good on their own promises.

05:28.760 --> 05:36.680
 So we know that by denying any sort of grand ideation, we are accepting that there will

05:36.680 --> 05:39.960
 be some kind of great catastrophe.

05:39.960 --> 05:47.400
 And so we have to understand that philosophy is the most important when we've seen too

05:47.400 --> 05:49.680
 much stagnation for too long.

05:49.680 --> 05:56.240
 It is also very dangerous and it's dangerous for the people who are doing it and it's dangerous

05:56.240 --> 06:00.640
 for the people who believe it but it's kind of our only way out ever.

06:00.640 --> 06:05.720
 And again, by philosophy you mean the bigger, it's not academic philosophy or this kind

06:05.720 --> 06:12.200
 of games played in the space of just moral philosophy and all those metaphysics, all

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
 that kind of stuff.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.520
 You mean just thinking deeply about this world, thinking from first principles.

06:17.520 --> 06:23.400
 I think your Twitter line involves something about trying to piece everything together

06:23.400 --> 06:24.880
 from first principles.

06:24.880 --> 06:31.040
 So that's fundamentally what being philosophical about this world is and that's where the people

06:31.040 --> 06:36.920
 who are thinking deeply about this world are the ones who are feeding, who are the catalyst

06:36.920 --> 06:39.240
 of this growth in society and so on.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.240
 Yeah.

06:40.240 --> 06:48.800
 I mean, I also think that the real implication of moral philosophy can be something that most

06:48.800 --> 06:52.680
 would consider like a real political implication.

06:52.680 --> 06:58.160
 So I think all philosophy really ties together because there has to be some sort of grand

06:58.160 --> 07:01.560
 structure to all thought and how it relates.

07:01.560 --> 07:10.480
 Do you think this growth and innovation and improvement can last forever?

07:10.480 --> 07:15.880
 We've seen some incredible, you know, the thing that humans have been able to accomplish

07:15.880 --> 07:23.200
 over the past several hundred years is just, I mean, awe inspiring and every moment in

07:23.200 --> 07:29.480
 that history, it almost seemed like no more could be done, like we've solved all the problems

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
 that are to be solved.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.720
 I mean, there's just, historically, there's all these kind of ridiculous like Bill Gates

07:34.720 --> 07:42.200
 style quotes or like, it's obvious that we've, this new cool thing is not going to take off

07:42.200 --> 07:43.720
 and yet it does.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.320
 And so there's a feeling of the same kind of pattern that we see in Moore's law.

07:48.320 --> 07:54.080
 There's constant growth in different technologies in the modern day era and any kind of automation

07:54.080 --> 07:55.360
 over the past hundred years.

07:55.360 --> 08:00.800
 Do you think it's possible that we'll keep growing this way if we give power to the philosophers

08:00.800 --> 08:02.320
 of our society?

08:02.320 --> 08:09.280
 I think the only way that we can keep growing this way is if we give power to real thinkers

08:09.280 --> 08:13.800
 and there's no guarantee that that will work, but we sort of don't have any other choice.

08:13.800 --> 08:22.040
 And I think you're entirely right that this period of both understanding the universe

08:22.040 --> 08:30.840
 at a rate which has never been seen before and invention and creativity, that these past

08:30.840 --> 08:37.560
 hundred years have been sort of uncharacteristic for the level of growth that we've seen in

08:37.560 --> 08:41.440
 all of history, we've never seen anything like this.

08:41.440 --> 08:51.720
 And I think a lot of our promises rest on this sort of thing continuing.

08:51.720 --> 08:57.600
 I think that's very dangerous, but the one thing that can get us out of this is philosophy

08:57.600 --> 09:04.760
 and being ready to radically restructure all of our notions about what should be, what

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
 is.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
 I think that's very important.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.880
 So you think deeply about this world.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.160
 You are clearly this embodiment of a think of a philosopher.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.120
 Your dad is also one such guy, Eric Weinstein.

09:17.120 --> 09:21.560
 Do you have big disagreements with him on this topic in particular?

09:21.560 --> 09:27.960
 I think now people should know he also happens to be in the room, but the mics can't pick

09:27.960 --> 09:32.320
 him up so he can heckle it doesn't even matter.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.760
 But do you have disagreements with him on this point?

09:34.760 --> 09:41.640
 Let me try to summarize his argument that we were actually based a lot of our American

09:41.640 --> 09:45.960
 society on the belief that things will keep growing.

09:45.960 --> 09:53.000
 And yet it seems that however you break it apart, maybe from an economics perspective,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.240
 that they're not growing currently.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.680
 And so that's where a lot of our troubles are at.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.840
 Do you have the same sense that there's a stagnation period that we're living through

10:01.840 --> 10:03.400
 over the past couple of decades?

10:03.400 --> 10:11.240
 I think modern stagnation is completely undeniable, particularly scientifically.

10:11.240 --> 10:17.920
 And I think there have been a few fields where tremendous progress has been made very recently.

10:17.920 --> 10:28.360
 I think my dad might feel that there is sort of an inevitability to the ending of this

10:28.360 --> 10:38.440
 period, and I'm not so certain that the fall of this great time is completely inevitable

10:38.440 --> 10:45.120
 because I don't know what thoughts were capable of producing, what we're able to reconsider.

10:45.120 --> 10:52.800
 I think we really have to be open to the possibility that all of our standard frameworks

10:52.800 --> 10:57.640
 where he will talk about embedded growth obligations.

10:57.640 --> 11:02.000
 If we continue within the same framework, then we're very susceptible to the dangers

11:02.000 --> 11:05.120
 of whatever these embedded growth obligations are.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.080
 I think if we break the frameworks, we have no reason to believe that the problems we're

11:09.080 --> 11:13.240
 experiencing with our current frameworks will follow us.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.280
 And I think that's the importance of radical thought.

11:16.280 --> 11:20.000
 We don't know what the solution is, but if there is a solution, it will be born from

11:20.000 --> 11:22.720
 some very fundamental thinking.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.280
 And so I have great hope.

11:24.280 --> 11:31.080
 So you have optimism about the power of a single radical idea or a single radical thinker

11:31.080 --> 11:41.080
 to break our frameworks and break us out of this spiral down due to whatever the economic

11:41.080 --> 11:45.000
 forces that are creating this current stagnation.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
 Yeah.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.760
 I'm very, very hopeful.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.000
 The optimism of youth.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.120
 Well, I share your optimism.

11:52.120 --> 11:56.120
 So let me come back to something you've also talked about.

11:56.120 --> 12:02.680
 You have very little stuff out there currently, but the things you have out there, your thoughts,

12:02.680 --> 12:05.440
 you could just tell how deeply you think about this world.

12:05.440 --> 12:12.640
 And one of the things you mentioned is as you learn about this world, as you read, as

12:12.640 --> 12:21.560
 you sort of go through different experiences that you're open to changing your mind.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.920
 How often do you find yourself changing your mind?

12:23.920 --> 12:28.200
 Do you think that from 10 years into the future, we'll look back at this conversation

12:28.200 --> 12:33.280
 we're having now and disagree completely with everything you just said?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.560
 It's entirely possible.

12:34.560 --> 12:39.360
 And that's one of the things that scares me so much about appearing publicly.

12:39.360 --> 12:45.240
 I think that the internet can be very intolerant of inconsistency.

12:45.240 --> 12:54.120
 And I am entirely prepared to be very inconsistent because I know that whatever beliefs I have

12:54.120 --> 13:02.480
 when subjected to scrutiny may change because that's really the only way to form your truest,

13:02.480 --> 13:06.960
 most fundamental conceptions about the world around you.

13:06.960 --> 13:11.960
 And it would take an infinite amount of time to subject every single one of your beliefs

13:11.960 --> 13:19.160
 to scrutiny, and so that's a process that must follow me throughout my entire life.

13:19.160 --> 13:28.080
 And I know that means that my opinions and perspectives are always to be changing.

13:28.080 --> 13:34.720
 I'm prepared to accept that about myself, whether other people are prepared to accept

13:34.720 --> 13:45.920
 that my public opinions may change very greatly over time is something I don't know.

13:45.920 --> 13:53.360
 I don't know how tolerant the world will be, but I'm very prepared to change anything I

13:53.360 --> 13:58.120
 believe in if I think deeply enough about it or a good enough argument is made so that

13:58.120 --> 13:59.360
 I might reconsider.

13:59.360 --> 14:05.040
 Well, that certainly is currently an intolerance, and that's one of the problems of our age.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.280
 There's an intolerance towards change, and I'll also ask you about labels you talked

14:09.280 --> 14:10.280
 about.

14:10.280 --> 14:15.200
 We like to bend each other into different categories, blue or red or whatever the different

14:15.200 --> 14:17.280
 categorization is.

14:17.280 --> 14:24.720
 But it seems like the task before you as a young person defining our future is to make

14:24.720 --> 14:31.000
 a tolerance of change the norm during this podcast, for example, and then changing your

14:31.000 --> 14:37.320
 mind one or two years later and doing so publicly without a big dramatic thing or maybe changing

14:37.320 --> 14:43.480
 it on a daily basis and just being open about it and being transparent about your thought

14:43.480 --> 14:44.480
 process.

14:44.480 --> 14:52.640
 Maybe that is the beacon of hope for the philosophical way, the path of the philosopher.

14:52.640 --> 14:59.040
 So that's your task in the sense is to change your mind openly and bravely.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.040
 You're right.

15:00.040 --> 15:04.640
 And maybe I will just have to endure some sort of criticism for doing that, but I think

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
 that's very important.

15:05.640 --> 15:11.520
 And I think this ties back to this previous phase of our conversation where we were discussing

15:11.520 --> 15:23.040
 if thinkers would win over systems that are devoted to preventing radical thought or if

15:23.040 --> 15:25.840
 who will win the systems or the thinkers.

15:25.840 --> 15:34.520
 I think it's crucial that my generation take up a hand in this fight.

15:34.520 --> 15:40.320
 And I think it's important that I'm a part of that because I know that I have some opportunity

15:40.320 --> 15:51.680
 to, I think it is my obligation as a member of a generation whose only real hope is to

15:51.680 --> 15:57.080
 think outside of a system because whatever systems exist are collapsing.

15:57.080 --> 16:03.280
 I think it is really my obligation to try to play some role, whatever role I can in

16:03.280 --> 16:06.560
 being an instrument in that change.

16:06.560 --> 16:13.560
 Are you, as a young mind, do you have a sense of fear about just like how afraid were you

16:13.560 --> 16:15.240
 to do this podcast conversation?

16:15.240 --> 16:18.640
 Do you have a sense of fear of thinking publicly?

16:18.640 --> 16:23.440
 Yeah, I don't even think that that fear is irrational.

16:23.440 --> 16:31.760
 It's very difficult to exist publicly in any form now because it's very easy for anyone

16:31.760 --> 16:41.000
 to take cheap shots at something which is difficult and as I said, the people who are

16:41.000 --> 16:49.480
 trying to have the difficult ideas and conversations are perhaps putting others in actual danger

16:49.480 --> 16:55.480
 because everyone is so desperate that they might be willing to try anything.

16:55.480 --> 17:03.400
 So there's a certain amount of responsibility which one has to take going before the public

17:03.400 --> 17:11.160
 and there is a certain amount of ridicule which will be completely unwarranted that

17:11.160 --> 17:16.160
 anyone must endure for it.

17:16.160 --> 17:21.920
 And I think that means that one has to be afraid because they could both ruin the world

17:21.920 --> 17:31.440
 and be ruined by the world in an unwarranted and undeserved fashion.

17:31.440 --> 17:39.040
 I would like to believe in myself enough to try to accept this as a task because I think

17:39.040 --> 17:43.640
 people need to try or there's no getting out of this and we will end in some kind of crazy,

17:43.640 --> 17:44.640
 brilliant war.

17:44.640 --> 17:48.680
 I'll have to put, you've said also that in these times we can't have labels because

17:48.680 --> 17:51.760
 it holds us back.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.880
 We've already talked about it a little bit but this idea of labels is really interesting.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.720
 Why do you think labels hold us back?

17:59.720 --> 18:08.520
 Well, I think many underestimate the extent to which language and communication really

18:08.520 --> 18:14.880
 impacts and shapes the ideas and thoughts which are being communicated.

18:14.880 --> 18:23.920
 And I think if we're willing to accept imperfect labels to categorize particular people or

18:23.920 --> 18:31.480
 thoughts in some sense we are corrupting an abstraction in order to represent it and communicate

18:31.480 --> 18:32.480
 about it.

18:32.480 --> 18:38.920
 And I think as we've discussed those abstractions are particularly important when everything

18:38.920 --> 18:44.000
 is on fire.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.680
 We should not be sacrificing grand thought for the ability to express it.

18:52.680 --> 18:59.160
 I think everyone should work much harder, including myself, to really be thinking abstractly

18:59.160 --> 19:06.040
 in abstract terms instead of using concrete terms to discuss abstraction while ruining

19:06.040 --> 19:07.040
 it slightly.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
 Yeah.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.680
 It's kind of a skill actually.

19:10.680 --> 19:20.200
 So one really difficult example in the recent time that maybe you can comment on if you

19:20.200 --> 19:23.600
 have been thinking about is just politics.

19:23.600 --> 19:29.680
 And there's a lot of labels in politics that it takes a lot of skill to be able to communicate

19:29.680 --> 19:34.120
 difficult ideas without labels being attached to you.

19:34.120 --> 19:40.200
 That's something that I've been sort of thinking about a lot in trying to express, for example,

19:40.200 --> 19:46.640
 how much I love various aspects of the foundational ideas of this country, like freedom, and just

19:46.640 --> 19:50.600
 saying I love America as a simple statement.

19:50.600 --> 19:56.040
 I love the ideas that we're finding to America will often in the current time where people

19:56.040 --> 20:01.400
 will try to desperately try to attach a label to me, for example, for saying I love America

20:01.400 --> 20:08.560
 that I'm a Republican, a Donald Trump supporter, and it takes elegance and grace and skill

20:08.560 --> 20:14.400
 to like to like avoid those labels so that people can actually listen to the contents

20:14.400 --> 20:23.280
 of your words versus the summarization that results from just the labels that they can

20:23.280 --> 20:24.280
 pin on you.

20:24.280 --> 20:29.520
 Are you cognizant of the skill required there of being able to communicate without being

20:29.520 --> 20:33.960
 branded a Republican or Democrat in this particular set of conversations?

20:33.960 --> 20:37.960
 I'm sure there's other dangerous labels that could be attached.

20:37.960 --> 20:42.360
 I don't think there's any way of avoiding that right now.

20:42.360 --> 20:47.440
 It might not be anyone's best effort to really try.

20:47.440 --> 20:56.960
 I think the thing I can say, which will most speak to that, which I truly believe, is that

20:56.960 --> 21:05.200
 participating in modern conventional politics is not being inherently political in a generative

21:05.200 --> 21:08.000
 sense.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.960
 It's this repeated trope where politics now is not about creating new political ideologies.

21:14.960 --> 21:19.280
 It's about defending ideologies which already exist so that everyone can keep what they

21:19.280 --> 21:26.760
 have, and that's where all of the name calling and the labeling really comes in.

21:26.760 --> 21:36.400
 It's an attempt to constrict whatever may be generated to standard conversations and

21:36.400 --> 21:43.400
 discussions so that arguments can be straw manned and defeated and people can keep what

21:43.400 --> 21:48.800
 they have because everyone's very, very scared.

21:48.800 --> 21:55.720
 I want to be very political, but not in a standard political sense where I'm defending

21:55.720 --> 22:01.160
 a particular party or place on a spectrum.

22:01.160 --> 22:06.480
 I would like to play some role in inventing new spectrums, and I think that's most important

22:06.480 --> 22:15.120
 politically because above most else, politics is about real power, and conventional politicians

22:15.120 --> 22:23.280
 have real power, and that power will find terrible outlets if new spectrums for that

22:23.280 --> 22:25.720
 power to live are not invented.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.320
 So you're not afraid of politics?

22:28.320 --> 22:34.480
 Political discourse at the deepest, richest level of what political discourse is supposed

22:34.480 --> 22:35.480
 to mean?

22:35.480 --> 22:39.080
 Actually, I'm very afraid of it, but once again, we have no...

22:39.080 --> 22:41.080
 That's not paralyzing for you.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.840
 You feel like it's a responsibility you're ready to take it on.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.360
 This is a good sign.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.000
 This is your special human.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.840
 Let's talk maybe fun, maybe profound.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.520
 We talked about philosophers, philosophy.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.040
 Who's your favorite philosopher?

22:58.040 --> 23:06.360
 Somebody in your current time been either influential or you just enjoy his or her ideas

23:06.360 --> 23:09.200
 or writing or anything like that?

23:09.200 --> 23:17.080
 Weirdly, I'll give an answer which doesn't have much to do with whom I might imagine

23:17.080 --> 23:18.560
 myself to be.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.640
 I like Thomas Aquinas at the moment.

23:21.640 --> 23:27.400
 I think he's very inspirational to me given what we're going through, and that's not because

23:27.400 --> 23:40.560
 his particular ideas of religion or God or unmoved movers are particularly inspirational

23:40.560 --> 23:41.560
 to me.

23:41.560 --> 23:51.080
 I don't even think they were necessarily right, but he was introducing aspects of the scientific

23:51.080 --> 23:57.240
 method during one of the darkest periods in human history when we had lost all hope and

23:57.240 --> 24:02.320
 reason and ability to think logically.

24:02.320 --> 24:08.160
 I think he was really something of a light in the dark, and I think we need to look to

24:08.160 --> 24:10.520
 people like that at the moment.

24:10.520 --> 24:18.200
 The other reason why I think I need to learn from him is that even though he was doing

24:18.200 --> 24:25.680
 something which really needed to be done and introducing scientific thought and reason

24:25.680 --> 24:35.800
 to a time that lacked it, he was not saying anything that would have been offensive to

24:35.800 --> 24:39.240
 whatever powers were in play during his time.

24:39.240 --> 24:46.880
 He was writing about the importance of faith in God and how we could prove it, and so it's

24:46.880 --> 24:55.920
 important to remember, I suppose, that having ideas that shape the world and which bring

24:55.920 --> 25:01.040
 the world closer to what we can prove it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to work

25:01.040 --> 25:08.540
 does not always take some sort of grand contradiction of whatever is in play, and the most courageous

25:08.540 --> 25:13.480
 thing to do may not always be the most helpful thing to do.

25:13.480 --> 25:22.600
 I think it's very easy for anyone with ideas about how everything is broken to become very

25:22.600 --> 25:27.760
 cynical and say, oh, the system, man, they're all wrong.

25:27.760 --> 25:37.400
 I think it takes another kind of discipline to be a person with real ideas and to make

25:37.400 --> 25:41.880
 the world better without stepping on anyone's toes or contradicting anyone.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.040
 I have real respect for that.

25:43.040 --> 25:47.480
 So being able to be when it's within your principles to operate within the current system

25:47.480 --> 25:48.480
 of thought?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.480
 Yeah.

25:49.480 --> 25:58.160
 And not offend anyone, not say anything outlandish, but introduce the method by which progress

25:58.160 --> 26:00.320
 must be achieved.

26:00.320 --> 26:08.280
 I think that takes a kind of maturity, which is found very rarely now, and I really look

26:08.280 --> 26:14.800
 to him for inspiration, despite whatever disagreements I may have with the minute details of his

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
 philosophy.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
 Yeah.

26:16.800 --> 26:23.360
 It takes a lot of skill, a lot of character, and yeah, deep thinking to be able to operate

26:23.360 --> 26:30.120
 within the system when needed and having the fortitude and just the boldness to step

26:30.120 --> 26:37.240
 outside and to burn the system down when needed, but rarely opportune moments that would actually

26:37.240 --> 26:38.240
 have impact.

26:38.240 --> 26:43.200
 I mean, it's ultimately about impact within the society that you live in, not just making

26:43.200 --> 26:46.520
 a statement that has no impact.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.760
 Yeah.

26:47.760 --> 26:55.000
 And we were talking about how dangerous it is to do real philosophy at dangerous, broken

26:55.000 --> 26:56.080
 times.

26:56.080 --> 27:05.200
 He was going through the most broken time in history, and he questioned the methods which

27:05.200 --> 27:10.200
 made a broken system able to survive.

27:10.200 --> 27:15.920
 And he was so skilled and so graceful that he became a saint in that tradition.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.080
 And there's something for me to really learn from there.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.480
 Do you draw any inspiration, have any interest in the sort of more modern philosophers, maybe

27:23.480 --> 27:27.640
 the existentialists, and Nietzsche is one of the early ones?

27:27.640 --> 27:33.560
 Do you have thoughts on the guy in general or any of the other existentialists?

27:33.560 --> 27:39.400
 Well, with regard to Nietzsche, I think, I think Nietzsche might have said that he's

27:39.400 --> 27:40.400
 the worst.

27:40.400 --> 27:44.400
 You know, he was certainly filled with passionate intensity.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.800
 Was that a compliment?

27:47.800 --> 27:51.440
 He was the worst or a criticism?

27:51.440 --> 27:56.200
 Well, Nietzsche had this big line, the best lack all conviction, the worst are filled

27:56.200 --> 27:59.840
 with passionate intensity.

27:59.840 --> 28:13.680
 So I think Nietzsche was destroyed by the horrors of everything that went on around

28:13.680 --> 28:14.680
 him.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.680
 I think he never really recovered from it.

28:17.680 --> 28:26.480
 I think that's because if you think about Nietzsche's philosophy, he was very opposed

28:26.480 --> 28:32.160
 to any sort of acceptance of what one had, one should always envy those who have more

28:32.160 --> 28:41.040
 and use that envy to fuel their growth and, you know, accept whatever the human condition

28:41.040 --> 28:49.840
 and desires are and use those desires to want more and more and make use of your greed.

28:49.840 --> 29:04.120
 I think it's very difficult to be truly happy if the thing which you pride yourself most

29:04.120 --> 29:11.280
 on is never being satisfied and I think Nietzsche was never satisfied and that was the danger

29:11.280 --> 29:12.840
 of his philosophy.

29:12.840 --> 29:18.640
 I think also with his amoralism, you know, there is no good or evil.

29:18.640 --> 29:23.280
 I sort of disagree with that on a pretty fundamental basis.

29:23.280 --> 29:32.400
 I think that our notion of morality is by no means subjective, it's really the proxy

29:32.400 --> 29:35.520
 for the fitness of a society.

29:35.520 --> 29:45.640
 I think whatever we consider ethical, like don't steal, don't murder, don't do this.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.000
 Societies have a very difficult time running.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.400
 It's very hard to run a civilization when everyone is stealing from everyone else and

29:52.400 --> 30:01.200
 people are murdering each other and committing these things which we would consider atrocities.

30:01.200 --> 30:10.480
 So I think we also, we know this because I think very similar notions of morality have

30:10.480 --> 30:13.360
 evolved convergently from different traditions.

30:13.360 --> 30:25.840
 I think good is a proxy for a civilization's fitness and the good news is that that means

30:25.840 --> 30:37.560
 that evil in being anathema to that good must therefore be the opposite of stable in whatever

30:37.560 --> 30:44.120
 way that it's evil and that means that good will always be more stable than evil and the

30:44.120 --> 30:47.560
 only way evil can really win is like if everyone dies.

30:47.560 --> 30:54.360
 So wait, can you say that again, good is a proxy for society's what?

30:54.360 --> 30:59.720
 Good is a proxy for the stability and fitness of a civilization and evil.

30:59.720 --> 31:00.720
 That's a good definition.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.720
 Thank you.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.720
 So you're throwing some bombs today.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.720
 Okay.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.720
 This is exciting.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
 Sorry.

31:08.720 --> 31:12.880
 Sorry to interrupt your flow there, but it's just a good damn good one.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.560
 Thank you.

31:15.560 --> 31:20.320
 So in that sense, that's a kind of optimistic view that if by definition good is a proxy

31:20.320 --> 31:24.960
 for stability, then it's going to be stable unless the entire world just blows itself

31:24.960 --> 31:26.040
 up.

31:26.040 --> 31:29.720
 So good wins in the end by definition.

31:29.720 --> 31:39.240
 Or no, well, good wins unless it all goes to complete destruction.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.480
 That's a beautifully put.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.480
 Thank you.

31:41.480 --> 31:52.240
 On the topic of sort of good and evil being human illusions, you've said that more broadly

31:52.240 --> 31:57.120
 than that about truth that it is easier in some ways to be unified under truth because

31:57.120 --> 32:03.080
 it is universal and it is to be unified under belief, which at times can be completely subjective.

32:03.080 --> 32:07.680
 So what is the nature of truth to you?

32:07.680 --> 32:12.560
 Can we understand the world objectively or is most of what we can understand about the

32:12.560 --> 32:20.120
 world is just subjective opinions that we kind of all agree on in these little collectives

32:20.120 --> 32:26.520
 and over time it kind of evolves completely detached from objective reality?

32:26.520 --> 32:35.120
 I think this is the greatest argument for objectivity is that something that is objectively

32:35.120 --> 32:40.320
 true cannot be true to me and untrue to you.

32:40.320 --> 32:48.760
 You can feel that it's untrue, but that would be unproductive and create unnecessary tension

32:48.760 --> 32:50.440
 and conflict.

32:50.440 --> 32:59.680
 I think this is one reason for the importance of science as a tool for stability.

32:59.680 --> 33:08.880
 If science is the search for truth and truth can never really be, I shouldn't say that,

33:08.880 --> 33:15.680
 truth should never be an engine of conflict because no two people should disagree on something

33:15.680 --> 33:23.840
 which is objectively true, then in some sense search for truth is searching for a common

33:23.840 --> 33:31.840
 ground where we can all exist and live without contradicting or attacking each other.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.840
 Do you have a hope that there is a lot of common ground to be discovered?

33:35.840 --> 33:36.840
 Sure.

33:36.840 --> 33:44.280
 I mean, if we continue scientifically, we are discovering truth and in that discovering

33:44.280 --> 33:51.400
 common ground on which we can all agree, that's one reason why I think caring about science.

33:51.400 --> 33:58.040
 If you have a culture which cares very deeply about science, that's a culture which is not

33:58.040 --> 34:04.080
 necessarily bound to injure unwarranted internal conflict.

34:04.080 --> 34:08.040
 I think that's one reason that I'm so passionate about science is it's search for universal

34:08.040 --> 34:09.040
 ground.

34:09.040 --> 34:14.520
 Let me just throw out an example of a modern day philosophical thinker.

34:14.520 --> 34:19.840
 We'll keep your dad Eric Weinstein out of the picture for a sec, but he does happen

34:19.840 --> 34:24.360
 to be an example of one, but Jordan Peterson is an example of another, somebody who thinks

34:24.360 --> 34:26.880
 deeply about this world.

34:26.880 --> 34:32.440
 His ideas are, by a certain percent of the population, speaking of truth, are labeled

34:32.440 --> 34:35.120
 as dangerous.

34:35.120 --> 34:41.600
 Why do you think his ideas or just ideas of these kinds of deep thinkers in general are

34:41.600 --> 34:44.040
 labeled as dangerous in our modern world?

34:44.040 --> 34:49.720
 Is it similar to what you've been discussing that in difficult times, philosophers become

34:49.720 --> 34:50.720
 dangerous?

34:50.720 --> 34:54.920
 Or is there something specific about these particular thinkers in our time?

34:54.920 --> 35:01.520
 Well, I think Jordan Peterson is very antiestablishment in a lot of his beliefs.

35:01.520 --> 35:11.840
 He's an unconventional thinker, and I think we need, regardless of whatever Jordan's particular

35:11.840 --> 35:21.600
 views and beliefs are, and if they bring about more danger than truth, or if they don't,

35:21.600 --> 35:30.920
 it's very important to have fundamental thinkers who exist outside of a conventional framework.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.840
 Do I think that he's dangerous?

35:33.840 --> 35:44.240
 I think by existing outside of a system which is known, he is dangerous, and I think we

35:44.240 --> 35:51.520
 have to, in some sense, we have to welcome danger in that capacity because it will be

35:51.520 --> 35:54.000
 our only way out of this.

35:54.000 --> 36:06.160
 So regardless of whether his beliefs are right or wrong, I'm pretty adamant about the fact

36:06.160 --> 36:12.200
 that we need to support thought which may rescue us.

36:12.200 --> 36:18.960
 And that thought can appear radical or dangerous at times, but ultimately, if you allow for

36:18.960 --> 36:26.800
 it, this is kind of the difficult discussion of free speech and so on, is ultimately difficult

36:26.800 --> 36:30.480
 ideas will pave the way for progress.

36:30.480 --> 36:37.920
 Yeah, and I'd like to slow you down there because I think one of the issues we were

36:37.920 --> 36:48.400
 discussing previously was the fact that language often destroys our ability to think.

36:48.400 --> 36:54.360
 When we're talking about whether his ideas are radical, I don't know if we mean radical

36:54.360 --> 37:01.760
 in the traditional sense of having to do with the root of a problem or in the more modern

37:01.760 --> 37:05.800
 sense of being very extreme.

37:05.800 --> 37:16.040
 And I think that's completely by design, I think, fundamental thought which semantically

37:16.040 --> 37:22.200
 would once be considered radical thought became very dangerous, and now it's become synonymous

37:22.200 --> 37:28.080
 with extreme or dangerous thought, which means that anyone who considers themselves a radical

37:28.080 --> 37:36.520
 thinker is semantically also a dangerous or extreme thinker.

37:36.520 --> 37:43.040
 These are not helpful labels in a sense that the moment you say radical or extremist thinker,

37:43.040 --> 37:52.000
 then you're just, well, how do I put it, you're not helping the public discourse, the change

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
 of ideas.

37:53.000 --> 38:01.040
 But through no fault of our own, the concept of radical is having to do with a root is

38:01.040 --> 38:07.960
 an obvious concept for which there must be language, and a lot of the attack on thought

38:07.960 --> 38:14.680
 has to do with attacking language which communicates conceptually.

38:14.680 --> 38:21.280
 So this is an example of how our world is becoming increasingly Orwellian, it's just

38:21.280 --> 38:25.320
 language is being used to destroy our ability to think.

38:25.320 --> 38:29.600
 I think I can't remember exactly what the numbers are, but I read some statistic about

38:29.600 --> 38:36.120
 how greatly the average English vocabulary has decreased since 1960.

38:36.120 --> 38:43.000
 It was some incredible number, it really baffled me, it's like, how are people less able to

38:43.000 --> 38:50.600
 think in a time when the world is supposed to be growing at an ever before seen rate?

38:50.600 --> 38:58.000
 We can't keep on, we can't sustain this growth if we destroy everyone's ability to think

38:58.000 --> 39:05.000
 because the growth requires thinking and we're ruining the tools for it.

39:05.000 --> 39:13.560
 I watched your podcast with Noam Chomsky and I think one interesting thing which he discussed

39:13.560 --> 39:21.160
 was how language is more used to develop thoughts within our own head than it is used to communicate

39:21.160 --> 39:23.760
 those thoughts with others.

39:23.760 --> 39:31.240
 If the language doesn't change, even if its usage changes, then when language is destroyed

39:31.240 --> 39:41.760
 in communication, it also stymies our ability to think reasonably and I'm very, very worried.

39:41.760 --> 39:48.320
 But the language in communication requires a medium and there's a lot of different mediums,

39:48.320 --> 39:55.160
 so there's social media, there's Twitter, there's writing books, there's blog posts,

39:55.160 --> 40:04.880
 there's podcasts, there's YouTube videos, all of things you have dipped a toe in in

40:04.880 --> 40:08.560
 your exploration of different mediums of communication.

40:08.560 --> 40:13.560
 Which do you see yourself, this might be just a poetic way of asking are you going to do

40:13.560 --> 40:21.080
 a podcast, but a broader picture, what do you think as an intellectual in this world

40:21.080 --> 40:26.720
 for you personally will be the path for communicating your ideas to the world?

40:26.720 --> 40:31.840
 What are the mediums you are currently drawn to out of the ones I mentioned, maybe something

40:31.840 --> 40:32.840
 I didn't?

40:32.840 --> 40:42.880
 To answer your question concretely before abstractly, I'm scared but I need to do a podcast.

40:42.880 --> 40:49.600
 It's important, it is my obligation as a member of my generation, I really hope that more

40:49.600 --> 40:56.080
 people my age start to do this because we will be the people in charge of new ideas

40:56.080 --> 40:59.360
 which either sink or swim.

40:59.360 --> 41:04.640
 How upset will your dad be when your podcast quickly becomes more popular than his?

41:04.640 --> 41:06.760
 I think he would be negatively upset.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.920
 I'll say he'd be proud, he's a good dad.

41:09.920 --> 41:17.040
 I really think so, sorry to interrupt, but then zooming out, do you think podcasts are

41:17.040 --> 41:24.040
 you excited by the possibility of other mediums outside of podcasting to communicate ideas?

41:24.040 --> 41:30.760
 I would be if people still read books or did things like that.

41:30.760 --> 41:39.480
 I'm somewhat guilty of this, a lot of the books I read are very technical and then

41:39.480 --> 41:50.040
 my to absorb really deep modern conversations, I listen to podcasts and I don't really read

41:50.040 --> 41:55.560
 many books on the matters that we're discussing, for example.

41:55.560 --> 42:00.520
 It's fascinating because you're making me think of something that I align with you very

42:00.520 --> 42:03.720
 much of how I consume deep thinkers currently.

42:03.720 --> 42:09.280
 What happens is somebody who thinks deeply about the world will write a book, Jordan

42:09.280 --> 42:14.240
 Peterson example, and instead of reading their book, I'll just listen to podcast conversations

42:14.240 --> 42:22.200
 of them talking about the book, which I find, this is really sad, but I find that to be

42:22.200 --> 42:28.120
 a more compelling way to think about their ideas because they're often challenged in

42:28.120 --> 42:33.520
 certain ways in those conversations and they're forced to, after having boiled them down and

42:33.520 --> 42:37.920
 really thought to them enough to write a book, so it's almost like they needed to go through

42:37.920 --> 42:42.360
 the process of writing a book just so they can think through, convert the language in

42:42.360 --> 42:47.920
 their minds into something more concrete and then the actual exchange of ideas, the actual

42:47.920 --> 42:53.120
 communication of ideas with the public happens not with the book, but after the book with

42:53.120 --> 42:57.840
 that person going on a book tour and communicating the ideas.

42:57.840 --> 43:04.640
 Well, there are two meanings I make of why not too many people spend much of their time

43:04.640 --> 43:06.880
 reading anymore.

43:06.880 --> 43:11.880
 One interpretation is that we've lost our attention spans to our phones, people can't

43:11.880 --> 43:17.840
 concentrate on a page if it takes them a minute to read, we're too busy watching TikToks or

43:17.840 --> 43:20.080
 whatever people do.

43:20.080 --> 43:29.480
 The other interpretation would be that language and verbal communication has, as well as some

43:29.480 --> 43:35.640
 amount of communication which is done through facial expression, tone of voice, etc.

43:35.640 --> 43:42.920
 These are means of communication that have evolved along with humanity over thousands

43:42.920 --> 43:47.400
 and thousands of years.

43:47.400 --> 43:52.040
 We know that we are built to communicate in this way.

43:52.040 --> 43:57.960
 We have had writing for much less time.

43:57.960 --> 44:08.560
 It is a system that we invented, not a system which evolved and is innately part of humanity

44:08.560 --> 44:12.960
 or the human mind.

44:12.960 --> 44:18.680
 We are designed to consume conversation by our own evolution.

44:18.680 --> 44:27.000
 We are designed to consume writing by some process of symbols that's evolved over a

44:27.000 --> 44:31.840
 couple of thousand years.

44:31.840 --> 44:38.680
 It makes sense to me why many are much more compelled to listen to podcasts, for example,

44:38.680 --> 44:41.400
 than they are to read books.

44:41.400 --> 44:54.080
 It could be that this is simply a technological progression which has displaced reading conventionally

44:54.080 --> 45:03.240
 instead of some sort of maladaptation of our minds which has corrupted our attention spans.

45:03.240 --> 45:09.560
 Likely there's some combination which determines why people spend much less time reading, but

45:09.560 --> 45:12.440
 I don't think it's necessarily because we're all broken.

45:12.440 --> 45:18.160
 It may simply have to do with the fact that we are designed to listen through our ears

45:18.160 --> 45:25.520
 and speak through our mouths and we are not innately designed to communicate over a page.

45:25.520 --> 45:32.280
 Yeah, there's an exciting coupling to me between a few second TikTok videos that are

45:32.280 --> 45:39.160
 fun and addicting and then a three, four hour podcast which are both really popular in our

45:39.160 --> 45:40.880
 current time.

45:40.880 --> 45:46.800
 People are both hungry for the visual stimulation of internet humor and memes.

45:46.800 --> 45:54.360
 I'm a huge fan of and also slow moving deep conversations.

45:54.360 --> 45:58.680
 That might, there's a lot of, I mean it's part of your generation to define what that

45:58.680 --> 46:00.160
 looks like moving forward.

46:00.160 --> 46:06.120
 A lot of people, like Joe Rogan is one of the people that kind of started accidentally

46:06.120 --> 46:13.120
 stumbled into the discovery that this is like a thing and now people are kind of scrambling

46:13.120 --> 46:15.560
 to figure out why is this a thing?

46:15.560 --> 46:20.600
 Why is there so much hunger for long form conversations and how do we optimize that

46:20.600 --> 46:24.960
 medium for further, further expression of deep ideas and all that kind of stuff.

46:24.960 --> 46:32.200
 YouTube is a really interesting medium for that as well, like video sharing of videos.

46:32.200 --> 46:37.320
 Most of YouTube is used with the spirit of the TikTok spirit, if I can put it in that

46:37.320 --> 46:42.640
 way, which is like, how do I have quick moving things that even if you're expressing difficult

46:42.640 --> 46:47.320
 ideas they should be quick and exciting and visual and switching, but there's a lot of

46:47.320 --> 46:52.920
 exploration there to see what can we do something deeper and nobody knows.

46:52.920 --> 47:01.560
 You're part of the, you have a YouTube channel releasing one video every few years, so your

47:01.560 --> 47:07.320
 momentum is currently quite slow, but perhaps it'll accelerate, but you're one of the people

47:07.320 --> 47:09.320
 that gets to define that medium.

47:09.320 --> 47:14.400
 Do you enjoy that, the visual, the YouTube medium of communication as well?

47:14.400 --> 47:26.760
 I know that when the topic of conversation or the means by which a conversation is communicated

47:26.760 --> 47:35.720
 or an idea is communicated, if that is sufficiently interesting to me, I will read a book on it,

47:35.720 --> 47:40.680
 I would listen to a podcast on it, I would watch a video on it.

47:40.680 --> 47:46.320
 I think if I'm very curious about something, I will consume it however possible.

47:46.320 --> 47:53.600
 I think when I have to consume things which really don't interest me very much, I am indeed

47:53.600 --> 47:58.640
 much more ready to consume them through some sort of video or discussion than I am through,

47:58.640 --> 48:01.920
 like a long tedious book.

48:01.920 --> 48:06.960
 So for the breadth of acquiring knowledge, video is good.

48:06.960 --> 48:11.080
 For the depth, the medium doesn't matter.

48:11.080 --> 48:16.600
 I think it'd be fun to ask you about some big philosophical questions to see if you

48:16.600 --> 48:19.480
 have an opinion on them.

48:19.480 --> 48:24.240
 Do you think there's a free will or is free will just an illusion?

48:24.240 --> 48:32.760
 Well, I think classical mechanics would tell us that if we were to know every piece of

48:32.760 --> 48:39.120
 information about a system and understand the rules which govern that system, we would

48:39.120 --> 48:44.400
 be completely able to predict the future with complete accuracy.

48:44.400 --> 48:52.840
 So if something could know everything about our lives, it could freeze time and understand

48:52.840 --> 48:58.560
 the position of every neuron in my mind about to fire.

48:58.560 --> 49:04.560
 No decision could be unpredictable.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.920
 In some sense, there is that sort of fate.

49:07.920 --> 49:14.280
 I think that doesn't make the decisions we make illegitimate even if some grand supercomputer

49:14.280 --> 49:21.520
 could understand what decisions we would make beforehand with complete certainty.

49:21.520 --> 49:27.560
 I think we're making legitimate systems within a system that has no freedom.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.880
 We're making legitimate systems within a system that has no freedom.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.720
 Can you explain what you mean by that?

49:33.720 --> 49:34.720
 Yeah.

49:34.720 --> 49:45.200
 So if we were to have just a simple pendulum and I told you how long the rope was, we froze

49:45.200 --> 49:54.560
 it at a particular point and I told you how high above the ground the weight was and the

49:54.560 --> 50:03.280
 motion of a pendulum is something which is easy for everyone to imagine.

50:03.280 --> 50:09.000
 If we had all of that information, you could ask me, what will the pendulum do six and

50:09.000 --> 50:10.480
 a half minutes from now?

50:10.480 --> 50:13.560
 We would have a precise answer.

50:13.560 --> 50:21.240
 That's an example of a very simple system with a very simple Lagrangian.

50:21.240 --> 50:23.400
 We could completely predict the future.

50:23.400 --> 50:28.320
 The pendulum has no ability to do anything that would surprise us.

50:28.320 --> 50:38.360
 Weirdly, that's true of whatever this four dimensional, crazy world we live in looks

50:38.360 --> 50:44.600
 like if we were to understand where every piece of this system was at any given time

50:44.600 --> 50:50.640
 and we understand the laws of motion, how everything worked, if we could compute all

50:50.640 --> 50:59.400
 of that information somehow, which we will never be able to do, every decision you will

50:59.400 --> 51:03.080
 ever make could be predicted by that computer.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.560
 That doesn't mean that your decisions are illegitimate.

51:05.560 --> 51:11.640
 You are really making those decisions but with a completely predictable outcome.

51:11.640 --> 51:19.440
 I'm just a little bit high at the moment on the poetry of a system within a system that

51:19.440 --> 51:21.760
 has no freedom.

51:21.760 --> 51:27.320
 The human experience is the system we've created within the system that has no freedom, but

51:27.320 --> 51:41.320
 that system that we've created has a feeling of freedom that to us ants feels as much more

51:41.320 --> 51:50.120
 real than the physics as we understand it of the underlying like base system.

51:50.120 --> 51:55.080
 It's almost like not important what the physics of the base system is that for what we've

51:55.080 --> 52:03.320
 created, the nature of the human experience is there is a free will or there is something

52:03.320 --> 52:14.040
 that feels close enough to a free will that it may not be worth spending too much time

52:14.040 --> 52:16.960
 on the fact that it's something of an illusion.

52:16.960 --> 52:21.040
 We will never build a computer that knows everything about every piece of the universe

52:21.040 --> 52:28.840
 at a given time and so for all intensive purposes, our decisions are up to us.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.440
 We just happen to know that their outcomes could be predicted with enough information.

52:33.440 --> 52:39.600
 Speaking of supercomputers, they can predict every single thing about what's going to

52:39.600 --> 52:41.720
 ever happen.

52:41.720 --> 52:49.000
 What do you think about the philosophical thought experiment of us living in a simulation?

52:49.000 --> 52:54.800
 Do you often find yourself pondering of us living in a simulation of this question?

52:54.800 --> 52:57.960
 Do you think it's at all a useful thought experiment?

52:57.960 --> 53:04.080
 I think it's very easy to become fascinated with all of these possibilities and they're

53:04.080 --> 53:10.240
 completely legitimate possibilities.

53:10.240 --> 53:18.600
 Is there some validity to like solipsism while it can never be falsified or disproven?

53:18.600 --> 53:24.960
 So I mean, sure you could be a figment of my imagination.

53:24.960 --> 53:29.800
 It doesn't mean that I will act according to this possibility, I'm not going to call

53:29.800 --> 53:36.720
 you mean names and just to test the system to see how robust it is to distortions.

53:36.720 --> 53:37.720
 Yeah.

53:37.720 --> 53:42.720
 So, I mean, all of these existential thought experiments are completely possible.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.600
 We could be brains and jars.

53:45.600 --> 53:51.640
 It doesn't mean that our experience will feel any less valid.

53:51.640 --> 54:00.000
 And so it doesn't make a difference to me if you are some number of ones and zeros or

54:00.000 --> 54:06.880
 you're a figment of my imagination, which lives in a stored away brain.

54:06.880 --> 54:12.720
 It will never really change my experience knowing that that's a possibility.

54:12.720 --> 54:22.080
 And so I try to avoid making decisions based on such contemplations.

54:22.080 --> 54:32.960
 If we take this previous issue of free will, I could decide that because I have no choice

54:32.960 --> 54:41.120
 in my life, if I lie around in bed all day and eat chips, I was destined to do that thing.

54:41.120 --> 54:44.160
 If I make that decision, then I was destined to do that thing.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.960
 It would be a really poor decision for me to make.

54:46.960 --> 54:51.280
 I have school and a dozen commitments.

54:51.280 --> 54:56.360
 There's somebody listening to this right now, probably hundreds of people sitting down

54:56.360 --> 55:00.600
 eating chips and feeling terrible about themselves, so how dare you, sir.

55:00.600 --> 55:08.760
 If they're listening to this, they're clearly curious about possibilities of thought.

55:08.760 --> 55:12.640
 It's not the bed in the chips that makes the man.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.280
 It's not the bed of the chips that makes the man.

55:15.280 --> 55:20.640
 Yet another quotable from Zev Weistat.

55:20.640 --> 55:24.480
 But you don't think of it as a useful thought experiment from an engineering perspective

55:24.480 --> 55:32.120
 of virtual reality of thinking how we can create further and further immersive worlds.

55:32.120 --> 55:36.920
 Would it be possible to create worlds that are so immersive that we would rather live

55:36.920 --> 55:40.080
 in that world versus the real world?

55:40.080 --> 55:45.040
 That's another possible trajectory of the world that you're growing up in is we're

55:45.040 --> 55:50.600
 more and more immersing ourselves into the digital world.

55:50.600 --> 55:55.320
 For now, it's screens and looking at the screens and socializing the screens, but it's possible

55:55.320 --> 56:01.680
 to potentially create a world that's also visually for all of our human senses as immersive

56:01.680 --> 56:05.880
 as the physical world.

56:05.880 --> 56:10.520
 To me, it's an engineering question of how difficult is it to create a world that's

56:10.520 --> 56:16.040
 as immersive and more fun than the world we currently live in.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.440
 It's a terrifying concept, and I hate to say it.

56:18.440 --> 56:24.280
 We might live half your lives in a virtual reality headset 30 years from now than we are

56:24.280 --> 56:25.800
 currently living.

56:25.800 --> 56:30.000
 This future, the digital future worries you.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.720
 It worries me.

56:32.720 --> 56:42.720
 On the other hand, it may be a better alternative to fighting for whatever people are clinging

56:42.720 --> 56:50.160
 on to in our non virtual world or at least the world that we don't yet know is virtual.

56:50.160 --> 56:52.040
 Embrace the future.

56:52.040 --> 56:58.040
 We've been talking a lot about thinkers.

56:58.040 --> 57:04.080
 In the broad definition of philosophy, you included innovators of all form.

57:04.080 --> 57:08.360
 Do you find it useful to draw a distinction between thinkers and doers?

57:08.360 --> 57:17.440
 I think that the most important gift we've ever been given is our ability to observe

57:17.440 --> 57:25.400
 the universe and think deductively about whatever principles transcend humanity.

57:25.400 --> 57:32.560
 As we discussed, that's the closest thing we will ever have to a universal experience

57:32.560 --> 57:37.440
 is understanding things which must be true everywhere.

57:37.440 --> 57:46.400
 In order for that, so I think if we're deciding that life is meaningful and the human experience

57:46.400 --> 57:53.480
 is meaningful, you could make a very convincing argument that its greatest meaning will be

57:53.480 --> 57:58.640
 understanding whatever transcends it.

57:58.640 --> 58:10.280
 I think that's only sustainable if people are happy and well fed and things of market

58:10.280 --> 58:15.680
 value are invented.

58:15.680 --> 58:24.360
 I think we really need both to live meaningful and successful and possible lives.

58:24.360 --> 58:34.240
 In terms of who my greatest heroes are, I can't decide between figures like Einstein

58:34.240 --> 58:43.840
 and Newton and Feynman and on the other hand figures like Kerry Mullis, for example.

58:43.840 --> 58:52.400
 I think people like Einstein make our lives meaningful and people like Kerry Mullis who

58:52.400 --> 58:59.160
 is probably responsible for saving hundreds of millions of lives make our lives possible

58:59.160 --> 59:04.640
 and good.

59:04.640 --> 59:14.800
 In terms of where I would like to find myself with these two different notions of achievement,

59:14.800 --> 59:18.760
 I don't know what I would more like to achieve.

59:18.760 --> 59:23.800
 I have an inclination that it will be something scientific because I would like to bring meaning

59:23.800 --> 59:29.560
 to humanity instead of sustenance.

59:29.560 --> 59:32.280
 I think both are very important.

59:32.280 --> 59:36.120
 We can't sustain our lives if we don't keep growing technologically.

59:36.120 --> 59:41.760
 I think people like you are making that possible with computing because that's one of the few

59:41.760 --> 59:50.000
 things that's really moving forward in a clear sense.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.640
 I think about this a great deal.

59:53.640 --> 59:56.640
 I think both are very important.

59:56.640 --> 1:00:02.760
 One example that's modern day inspiring figure on the latter part and the engineering part

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:06.040
 on the sustenance is Elon Musk.

1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:09.720
 Does that somebody you draw inspiration from?

1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:18.760
 What are your thoughts in general about the kind of unique spec of human that's creating

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:25.680
 so much inspiring innovation in this world so boldly?

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:32.480
 I know that we will not survive without people like that.

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:39.680
 Elon is a ridiculous and sensational example of one of these figures.

1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:48.280
 I don't know if he's the best example or the worst example, but he is of his own kind.

1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:57.440
 He is radically individualistic and those are the people who will allow us to continue

1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:58.440
 as humans.

1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:01.320
 I'm very happy that we have people like that in this world.

1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:10.920
 You said this thing about if we are to say that life has meaning or life is meaningful,

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:19.080
 then you could argue that it is a worthy pursuit to transcend life.

1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:29.440
 Do you see that another just I'm going to have to go back and sleep on that one.

1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:43.200
 Do you draw some, speaking of Elon, some inspiration of us transcending Earth, of us moving outside

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:49.120
 of this particular planet that we've called home for a long time and colonizing other

1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:56.320
 planets and perhaps one day expanding outside the solar system and expanding, colonizing

1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:58.160
 our galaxy and beyond?

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:01.680
 Honestly, I know very little about space exploration.

1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:09.360
 I think it makes complete sense to me why we are starting to think very seriously about

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:10.360
 it.

1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:18.920
 It's an amazing and baffling and innovative solution to a lot of problems we see as a

1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:21.080
 world population.

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:26.880
 I can't really offer very much of interest on the topic.

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:37.400
 I think when I'm talking about transcending humanity and transcending Earth, I'm talking

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:41.240
 usually about deriving truth.

1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:46.880
 That's one of the things that makes theoretical math and physics so interesting.

1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:57.520
 I really, really love biology, for example, but biology is a combination of whatever principles

1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:03.360
 ensure evolution and whatever weird coincidences happened billions of years ago.

1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:08.640
 It's more interesting to understand the fundamental mechanisms of evolution, for example, than

1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:12.960
 it is the messy results of its processes.

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:14.680
 I can't say which is more interesting.

1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:18.000
 I can say which I think is more deep.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:27.880
 I think theory and abstraction, which can be achieved completely deductively, is deeper

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:38.000
 because it has nothing to do with circumstance and everything to do with logic and thought.

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:46.080
 If we were ever to interact with aliens, for example, we would not have our biology in

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.720
 common.

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:56.840
 If these were some really intelligent life form, we would have math and physics in common

1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:05.720
 because the laws of physics will be the same everywhere in the universe.

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:14.880
 Our particular anatomy and biology pertains only to life on this planet, and the principles

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:16.880
 may apply more ubiquitously.

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:22.200
 Do you ever think about aliens, like what they might look like?

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:30.440
 When I deal with thought experiments like these, I try to keep a very abstract mindset.

1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:41.240
 I notice that whenever I try to instantiate these abstractions, I corrupt whatever thoughts

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:43.240
 there are for which they're useful.

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:45.840
 It's kind of like the labels discussion.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:50.360
 The moment you try to make it concrete, it's probably going to look like some cute version

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:52.960
 of a human.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:57.120
 It's the little green fellas with the eyes and so on, or whatever.

1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:02.080
 Whatever the movies have instilled, like your cultural upbringing, you're going to project

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:04.480
 onto that the assumptions you have.

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:05.680
 That's interesting.

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:10.640
 You prefer to step away and think and abstract notions of what it means to be intelligent,

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:15.120
 what it means to be a living life form and all that kind of stuff.

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:23.600
 I almost try to pretend I'm blind and I'm deaf and I'm only in mind with no inductive

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:29.400
 reasoning capacity when I'm trying to think about thought experiments like these because

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:43.160
 I know that if I incorporate whatever my eyes instruct my brain, I will impede my ability

1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:50.960
 to think as deeply as possible because once again, the thing which shallows our thought

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:56.320
 can be the incorporation of circumstance and coincidence and for particular kinds of thought

1:05:56.320 --> 1:05:57.320
 that's very important.

1:05:57.320 --> 1:06:03.880
 I'm not discounting the use of inductive reasoning in many humanities and in many sciences,

1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:10.840
 but for the deepest of thoughts, once again, I feel it's important to try to transcend

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:15.320
 whatever methods of observation characterize human experience.

1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:18.120
 See, but within that, that's all really beautifully put.

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:26.360
 I wonder if there is a common mathematics and a common physics between us and alien

1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:34.200
 beings, we still have to make concrete the methods of communication.

1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:39.560
 That's a fascinating question of while remaining in these abstract fundamental ideas, how do

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:42.240
 we communicate with them?

1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:49.000
 I suppose that that question could be applied to different cultures on earth, finding a

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.000
 common language.

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.200
 Do you think about that kind of problem of basically communicating abstract fundamental

1:06:56.200 --> 1:06:57.360
 ideas?

1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:03.640
 My least favorite aspect of math or physics or any of these really deep sciences is the

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:05.840
 symbolic component.

1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:14.680
 I'm dyslexic, I don't like looking at symbols, they're too often a source of ambiguity,

1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:24.320
 and I think you're entirely right that if one thing holds us back with communication

1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:32.640
 with something that behaves or looks nothing like us, I think if one thing holds us back,

1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:39.040
 it will be symbols and the communication of deep thought, because as I said, I think

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:47.960
 communication frequently compromises thought by intention or by just theoretical inadequacy.

1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:52.040
 On this topic, actually, it'd be fun to see what your thoughts are.

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:57.080
 Do you think math is invented or discovered?

1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:04.720
 You said that math, we might share ideas of mathematics and physics with alien life forms,

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:10.840
 so it's uniform in some sense of uniform throughout the universe.

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:18.360
 Do you think this thing that we call mathematics is something that's kind of fundamental to

1:08:18.360 --> 1:08:24.840
 the world we live in, or is it just some kind of pretty axioms and theorems we've come up

1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:28.680
 with to try to describe the patterns we see in the world?

1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:34.840
 I think it's completely discovered and completely fundamental to all experience.

1:08:34.840 --> 1:08:40.880
 I think the only component of mathematics that has been invented is the expression of

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:50.240
 it, and I think in some sense there's almost an arrogance required to believe that whatever

1:08:50.240 --> 1:09:01.720
 aspect we invent having to do with math and physics and theory, there is an arrogance

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:08.800
 required to truly believe that that belongs on any sort of stage with the actual beauty

1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:16.680
 of the matters being discovered.

1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:27.120
 We need our minds and in some sense our pens to be able to play with these things and communicate

1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:36.020
 about them, and those hands and those pens are the things which smudge the most beautiful

1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:43.000
 thing that humanity can ever experience.

1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.600
 Maybe if we interact with some intelligent life form, they will have their own unique

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:57.640
 smudges, but the canvas, which is beautiful, must be identical because that is universal

1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:02.160
 and ubiquitous truth, and that's what makes it deep and meaningful is that it's so much

1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:09.840
 more important than whatever we're programmed to enjoy as an aspect of human experience.

1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:17.580
 Yeah, that's really beautifully put, that the human language is these messy smudges

1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:23.880
 of trying to express something underlying that is beautiful.

1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:30.920
 Speaking of that, on the physics side, do you think the pursuit of a theory of everything

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:37.240
 in physics, as we may call it in our current times, of understanding the basic fabric of

1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.760
 reality from a physics perspective, is an important pursuit?

1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:44.720
 I think it's essential.

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:54.960
 As I've said, I think ideation is our only escape from the constraints of human condition,

1:10:54.960 --> 1:11:02.360
 and I think that it's important that all great thoughts and ideas are bound together, and

1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:10.440
 I think the math is beautiful, and it ensures that the things which bind great ideas which

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:17.040
 have already been had and great discoveries together, it ensures that those strings will

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:19.880
 be beautiful.

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:26.080
 I think it's very important to unify all theories that have brought us to where we are.

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:28.720
 Do you think humans can do it?

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:33.040
 Do you think humans can solve this puzzle, is it possible that we, with our limited cognitive

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:41.240
 capacity, will never be able to truly understand this deeply, like deeply understand this underlying

1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:42.400
 canvas?

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:53.280
 I think if not, it will be people like you who invent some sort of, I don't know, we'll

1:11:53.280 --> 1:12:04.400
 call it computation for now, that we'll be able to not only discover that which transcends

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:11.840
 humanity, but to transcend human methods of discovering that which is above it.

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:17.160
 So superintelligence systems, AGI and so on, that are better physicists than us.

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:21.560
 I wonder if you might be able to comment, so your dad does happen to be somebody who

1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:28.320
 boldly seeks this kind of deep understanding of physics, the underlying nature of reality

1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:33.600
 from a physics perspective, from a mathematical physics perspective.

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.040
 Do you have hope your dad figures it out?

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:42.760
 I have great hope, it's not supposed to be my journey, it's supposed to be his journey,

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:47.120
 it's supposed to be his to express to the world.

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:54.160
 Obviously, I'm so proud that I'm connected to someone who is determined to do such a

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:55.160
 thing.

1:12:55.160 --> 1:13:03.240
 And on the other hand, maybe in some sense, I feel bad for him for having to, if he's

1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:10.440
 going to be the thing which discovers some sort of grand unified theory and expresses

1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:19.280
 it, I feel sorry that he will have to smudge whatever canvas this thing is, because he's

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:20.280
 human.

1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:26.720
 Really, I think, I know, I've seen a little bit of what I think great math and great physics

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:33.320
 looks like, and it's unbelievably beautiful, and then you have to present it to a world

1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:42.200
 with market constraints and all of this messy sloppiness, I feel bad in some sense for my

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:48.520
 dad because he has to go back and forth between this beautiful world of math and whatever

1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:54.960
 the messiness is of his human life.

1:13:54.960 --> 1:14:00.160
 And then the scientific community broadly with egos and tensions and just the dynamics

1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:03.640
 of what makes us human.

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:07.560
 He's also very lucky that he gets to play with these sorts of things.

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:09.960
 It's a mixed bag.

1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:17.840
 I both feel a little sorry for him for having to deal with the beauty as well as the smudging

1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:21.680
 and the sloppiness of human expression.

1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:34.640
 And I think it's difficult not to envy such a beautiful insight or life or vision.

1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:41.600
 Well, that's your own path as well as this kind of struggle of, as you mentioned, exploring

1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:48.680
 the beauty of different ideas while having to communicate those ideas with the best smudges

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:55.800
 you can in a world that wants to put labels, that wants to misinterpret, that wants to

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:57.920
 destroy the beauty of those ideas.

1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:05.400
 And you seem to at this time with your youthful enthusiasm embracing that struggle despite

1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:08.120
 the fear in the face of fear.

1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:14.440
 And your dad also carries that same youthful enthusiasm as well.

1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:19.960
 But that said, your dad, Eric Weinstein, he's a powerful voice, I would say, a powerful

1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:22.160
 intellect in public discourse.

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:31.320
 Is this a burden for you or an inspiration or both as a young mind yourself?

1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:41.160
 I think, as I said, there's this weird contrast of, I know that he has ideas which I think

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:49.880
 are very beautiful, and I know he has to deal with the sort of, there's something you have

1:15:49.880 --> 1:16:00.560
 to sacrifice in beauty when you bring it to a world which is not always beautiful.

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:07.400
 And there's an aspect of that which sort of scares me about this kind of thing.

1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:16.800
 I also think that, especially since I'm trying to think about how I should appear publicly,

1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:24.680
 my dad has been very inspirational in that I think he brings a sort of fastidious care

1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:27.440
 to very difficult conversations that…

1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:29.160
 What does fastidious mean?

1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:40.120
 Like, it's just very careful and thoughtful, he brings that sort of attitude to, I think,

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:43.080
 really difficult conversations.

1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:45.840
 And I know that I don't have that skill yet.

1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:47.880
 I don't think I'm terrible, but…

1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:52.640
 The care, the nuance, and yet not being afraid to push forward.

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:55.520
 Yeah, I would really like to learn from my dad there.

1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:03.000
 I think also, my dad has been very important to my life just because I've always been

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:13.080
 a sort of very idiosyncratic thinker, and I think I don't always know how to interact

1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:21.960
 with the world for those sorts of reasons, and I think my dad has always been similar.

1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:28.560
 And if not for my dad, I don't know if I would just believe that I was stupid or something

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:30.880
 because I wouldn't know how to…

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:36.160
 I don't know if I would know how to interpret my differences from convention.

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:45.240
 So he gave you the power to be different and use that as a superpower?

1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:49.000
 Yeah, I guess you could put it that way.

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:56.640
 I don't know who I would believe I am if I didn't have my dad telling me that it

1:17:56.640 --> 1:18:03.040
 wasn't my own stupidity, which alienated me from certain aspects of standard life.

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:06.040
 So I'm very, very thankful for that.

1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:11.840
 Is there a fond memory you have about an interaction with your dad, either funny, profound, that

1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:15.440
 kind of sticks with you now?

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:18.440
 A lot.

1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:24.040
 Part of the reason I ask that, of course, is just fascinating to see somebody as brilliant

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:30.800
 as you, see the people that you interact with, how they form the mind that you have, but

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:38.200
 also to give an insight of another public figure like your dad to see from your perspective

1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:42.600
 of what kind of little magical moments happen in private life.

1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:51.120
 I would say I remember, I think I just posted about this on Instagram or something.

1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:54.080
 Otherwise it didn't happen if you didn't post that, yeah.

1:18:54.080 --> 1:19:00.160
 One person who's always sort of mattered to whatever weird life and experience I've

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:03.520
 had has been this comedian, Tom Lehrer.

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:04.960
 Do you know him?

1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:05.960
 Yes.

1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:08.360
 I love him very much.

1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:09.360
 Likewise.

1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:12.960
 Anyway, I remember, I think I was five or something.

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:19.040
 My dad came home with the CD, this Tom Lehrer CD, and he told me to listen to it.

1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:28.520
 And it was all of this bizarre, satirical writing about prostitution and cutting up

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:35.800
 babies and all kinds of ridiculously vile content for a five year old.

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:46.280
 I think beyond just my love of Tom Lehrer, I think it was a way for my dad to express

1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:53.240
 that from a very young age, he was really ready to treat me like an adult and he was

1:19:53.240 --> 1:20:07.400
 ready to trust me and share his life and his enjoyments with me in a way that was unconventional

1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:19.760
 because he was willing to discard tradition for the chance at a really unique and meaningful

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:21.760
 parental relationship.

1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:26.480
 Something that his particular brand of weirdness is something you can understand at a young

1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:28.600
 age and embrace and learn from it.

1:20:28.600 --> 1:20:33.120
 Tom Lehrer, we should clarify, is not all about what is it, murder and prostitution.

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:36.160
 He's one of the witty, most brilliant musical artists.

1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:40.280
 If you haven't listened to his work, you should.

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:48.200
 He's just a rare intellect who's able to sort of in catchy rhyme express some really difficult

1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:56.240
 ideas through satire, I suppose, that still, even though it's decades ago, still resonates

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:57.960
 today, some of the ideas that he expressed.

1:20:57.960 --> 1:21:05.920
 I will say also that I think I am probably a more cultured person having listened to

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:08.880
 Tom Lehrer than I would have been without.

1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:15.880
 I think a lot of his comedy draws upon a canon that I was really driven to research by saying,

1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:18.720
 what does this mean, I don't understand that reference.

1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:26.240
 There are a lot of references there to really inspirational things, which he sort of assumes

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:28.320
 going into a lot of his songs.

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:32.920
 For many of us, like me, you have to piece those things together, looking at Wikipedia

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:35.480
 pages and whatnot.

1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:44.200
 To tie this back to the original question, I think there's sort of a break it, you bought

1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:47.280
 it notion of parenting.

1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:55.640
 I think really, if you're not going to accept a standard, you have to invent your own.

1:21:55.640 --> 1:22:03.400
 I think in some ways that was my dad's way of telling me that if I was too unstandard

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:09.080
 as a child, he wouldn't invent his own way of parenting me because that was worth it

1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:10.080
 to him.

1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:11.080
 I think that was very meaningful to me.

1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:16.820
 I know you're young, this is a weird time to ask this question.

1:22:16.820 --> 1:22:21.920
 Are you cognizant on the role of love in your relationship with your dad?

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:28.280
 Are you at a place mentally as a man yourself to admit that you love the guy?

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:36.120
 I love my dad with the connection that I think I've had to very few things in the world.

1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:43.640
 I think my dad is one of the people that's allowed me to see myself and I don't know

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.400
 who I would imagine myself to be if not for my dad.

1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:52.400
 That isn't to say that I agree with him on everything, but I think he's given me courage

1:22:52.400 --> 1:23:02.000
 to accept myself and to believe that I can teach myself where I'm unable to learn from

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:03.800
 convention.

1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:08.000
 I love my dad very dearly, yes.

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.840
 Is there ways in which you wish you could be a better son?

1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:18.640
 Firstly, I'd like to say I'm sure before I figure out exactly what those are.

1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:29.040
 I think whenever I come to conclusions on what that means, I'm eager to take them.

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:30.240
 What do you mean by that?

1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:32.240
 What do you mean by conclusions?

1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:39.080
 If I have an idea for how to be a better son, I think I'm inclined to try to be that person.

1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:41.040
 I think that's true of almost anything.

1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:53.360
 I think if I have ideas for improvement, it would be wasteful not to act on them.

1:23:53.360 --> 1:24:04.120
 I suppose one thing I could say is that I think idealism and what could almost be considered

1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:20.840
 naivete is not necessarily a lacking of maturity, but instead an obligation to those older than

1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:39.080
 us who have lived and seen too much to fully believe in what is naivete and right without

1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:46.640
 the assistance of the young to reinspire traditional idealism.

1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:55.440
 And so perhaps instead of trying to be more mature all the time, I should spend some time

1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:03.640
 trying to be an idealistic form of hope in the lives of people who maybe have seen too

1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.880
 much to retain all of that original hope.

1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:15.520
 So that's something that's difficult, but especially appearing in public as someone

1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:22.560
 as young as I am, I think anything I do which is juvenile by choice will be held against

1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:24.560
 me.

1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:27.000
 But maybe that's a sacrifice that I have to make.

1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.360
 I have to retain some sort of youthful hope and optimism.

1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:31.360
 Yeah.

1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:37.200
 I mean, I'm going to get teary eyed now, but I have allergies.

1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:40.800
 But also this pretty powerful way of saying, I certainly share your ideas, it's something

1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:48.200
 I struggle with of just by instinct, you should read The Idiot by Dostoevsky by instinct.

1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:55.280
 I love being naive and seeing the world from a hopeful perspective, from an optimistic

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:56.280
 perspective.

1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:03.920
 And it's sad that that is something you pay a price for in this world, like in the academic

1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:09.280
 world, especially as you're coming up through schooling, but just actually it's a hit on

1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:11.840
 your reputation throughout your life.

1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:18.240
 And it's a sad truth, but you have to like for many things, if it's a principle, you

1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.040
 hold, you have to be willing to pay the costs.

1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:31.040
 And ultimately, I believe that in part a hopeful view will help you realize the best version

1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:37.920
 of yourself because optimism is a kind of optimism is productive.

1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:46.440
 Like believing that the world is and can be amazing is allows you to create a more amazing

1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:47.440
 world somehow.

1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:52.480
 I mean, I'm not sure if I'm not sure if it's a human nature of a fundamental law of physics,

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:58.520
 I don't know, but believing the impossible in the sense being optimistic about the thing.

1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:02.560
 It's similar like going back to what you've said is like believing that a radical that

1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:09.920
 a powerful single idea that a single individual can revolutionize some framework that we're

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:13.320
 operating in that will change the world for the better.

1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:17.840
 Believing that allows you to have the chance to create that.

1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:24.720
 And so I'm with you on the optimism, but you may have to pay a cost of optimism and

1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:26.720
 naive hopefulness.

1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:31.080
 I mean, in some sense, optimism limits freedom.

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:38.720
 I think if we don't really have much choice in choosing what is perfect, if it exists

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:47.040
 as an ideal, then there isn't much room for creativity and that's a danger of optimism

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:50.640
 as someone who would like to be creative.

1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:56.320
 I think it was Warren Zevon said, accepting dreams, you're never really free.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:04.400
 And that's something I think about a lot who's an interesting guy also, I really like him.

1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:09.800
 On that topic, you do have a bit of an appreciation and connection with music.

1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:14.480
 I saw you play some guitar a few months ago.

1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:21.040
 What can you put in like a philosophical sense, your connection to music?

1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:26.040
 What insights about life, about just the way you see the world do you get from music?

1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:33.040
 I think the role music has played in my life was originally motivated by sort of wanting

1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:35.320
 to prove things to myself.

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:37.480
 I really have no ear for music.

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:45.160
 I have a terrible sense of pitch and I think a lot of music relies on very standard teaching.

1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:54.000
 If you think about lessons, for example, music lessons, there's sort of a routine to them,

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:59.320
 which is so archaic and traditional that there's no room for deviation.

1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:06.440
 I think all of that suggested to me that I would never have a relationship with music.

1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:12.840
 I loved listening to music, it was difficult to me, it sort of saddened me.

1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:19.040
 I wanted to know if there was any way I could build a connection to music given who I am,

1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:25.640
 my own idiosyncrasies, what challenges I have.

1:29:25.640 --> 1:29:32.840
 I decided to try to learn music theory before I touched an instrument.

1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:38.280
 I think that gave me a very unique opportunity instead of spending my time fruitlessly at

1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:41.080
 the beginning on the syntax of a particular instrument.

1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:45.920
 This is your posture on the piano, this is how you hold your fingers.

1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:51.040
 I tried instead to learn what made music work.

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:56.960
 The wonderful thing about that was I'm pretty sure that any instrument with discrete notes

1:29:56.960 --> 1:30:04.600
 is mine for the taking within a day or so of having the ability to play with it.

1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:14.720
 I think approaching music abstractly gave me the ability to instantiate it everywhere.

1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:18.840
 I think it also taught me something about self teaching.

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:24.720
 Recently I've tried getting into classical music because at least traditionally this

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:35.520
 is the thing which is thought to require the most rigor and traditional teaching.

1:30:35.520 --> 1:30:41.560
 I think it's essentially taught me even if I'll never be a great classical performer

1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:52.240
 that there is nothing one can't really teach themselves in this era, so I've been enjoying

1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:53.960
 whatever connection I have with music.

1:30:53.960 --> 1:31:00.440
 The other thing I'll say about it is that it's a very rewarding learning process.

1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:10.200
 We know, for example, that music accesses are neurochemicals very directly.

1:31:10.200 --> 1:31:19.200
 If you teach yourself a little bit of theory and are able to instantiate it on an instrument

1:31:19.200 --> 1:31:26.200
 without wasting your time or spending your time tediously on learning the particulars

1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:32.600
 of that instrument, you can instantly sit down and access your own dopamine loops.

1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:38.160
 You don't really need to motivate yourself with music because you're giving your brain

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:50.840
 drugs who needs motivation to give themselves drugs and learn something.

1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:53.280
 I think more people should be playing music.

1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:57.640
 I think a lot of people don't realize how easy it can be to approach if you take a sort

1:31:57.640 --> 1:32:01.560
 of unstandard approach.

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:06.320
 The unstandard approach in your sense was understanding the theory first and then just

1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:14.360
 from the foundation of the theory, be able to then just take on any instrument and start

1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:19.480
 creating something that sounds reasonably good or learning something that sounds reasonably

1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:26.880
 good and then plugging into the, as you call them, the dopamine loops of your brain, allowing

1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:29.360
 yourself to enjoy the process.

1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:34.800
 What about the pain in the ass rigorous process of practice?

1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:38.800
 There's something about my dopamine loops, for example, that enjoys doing the same thing

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:42.480
 over and over and over again and watching myself improve.

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:50.440
 I think that's because music is more effective at accessing us when it's played correctly.

1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:56.440
 I'm positive that you play music much more correctly than I do.

1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:01.720
 If you are going to sit down and play something that you've learned, that piece will be much

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:08.360
 more satisfying to your ears and to your brain than if I were to play that piece just sitting

1:33:08.360 --> 1:33:20.120
 down with an instrument, but it's sort of a trade off with freedom and rigor because

1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:25.720
 even if I should be spending more of my time practicing rigorously, I know I don't have

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.760
 to to make me happy.

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:36.080
 Well, Jaco Willink, I think, has the saying that discipline is freedom, so maybe the repetition

1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:43.080
 of the disciplined repetition is actually one of the mechanisms of achieving freedom.

1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:48.760
 It's another way to get to freedom, that it doesn't have to be a constraint, but in the

1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:56.520
 sense unlocks greater sets of opportunity than results in a deeper experience of freedom.

1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:07.920
 I mean, particularly if you're thinking about discipline and method for improvisation, there

1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:13.920
 are a million pieces that you could improvise with the same discipline and how to approach

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.200
 that improvisation.

1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:28.680
 I think it's true that discipline promotes freedom if you insert a layer of indirection

1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:35.960
 because I think if you're trying to learn one piece that was written 400 years ago and

1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:45.360
 you're playing it over and over again, there is nothing personal or creative about that

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:49.840
 process even if it's beautiful and satisfying.

1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:59.920
 There has to be some sort of discipline applied to the creativity of self, so I think that

1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:06.600
 is the layer of indirection which reconciles both approaches to freedom and discipline

1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:10.200
 and enjoyment of music.

1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:15.600
 Discipline applied to the creativity of self.

1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:18.320
 Damn, Zav, thank you.

1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:26.800
 Now as an aging man yourself, if you were to give an advice to young folks today of

1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:34.240
 how to approach life and maybe advice yourself, is there some way you could condense a set

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:40.240
 of principles, a set of advices you would give to yourself and to other young folks

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:43.680
 of how to live life?

1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:44.680
 Sure.

1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:55.560
 I would say that with the collapse of systems that have existed for thousands of years,

1:35:55.560 --> 1:36:00.320
 whatever is happening with universities might be an example of some system that may or may

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:02.520
 not be decaying.

1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:14.600
 I think with the destruction of important systems, there is a unique opportunity to invest in

1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:21.400
 oneself and I think that is always the right approach provided that the investment one

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:29.000
 makes in his self is obligated towards humanity as a whole.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:38.400
 And I think that is the great struggle of my generation, will we create our own paths

1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:46.920
 that are capable of saving whatever is collapsing or will we be squashed by the debris?

1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:55.720
 And I hope to articulate what patterns I see this struggle taking over the years that

1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:02.480
 my generation becomes particularly active in the world as an important force.

1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:08.880
 I think already we are important as a demographic to particular markets, but I should hope that

1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:12.960
 our voices will matter as well starting very soon.

1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:18.600
 So I would try to think about that, that would be my advice.

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:25.560
 Do you, it is a silly question to ask perhaps, but in a bit of a Russian one, it is silly

1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:31.800
 because you are young, but I don't think it is actually silly because you are young.

1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:40.200
 Do you ponder your mortality and are you just afraid of death in general?

1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:53.640
 So tying us back to our previous conversations about abstraction versus experience, which

1:37:53.640 --> 1:38:02.440
 is determining our notions of our life and our world, death is interesting in that it

1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:08.680
 is obviously hyper important to a person's life and it is something that for the most

1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:15.800
 part no human will really experience and be able to reflect upon.

1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:22.840
 So our notions of death are sort of proof that if we want to make the most of our lives,

1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:36.080
 we have to think abstractly and relying not at all at times on experiential thought and

1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:42.400
 understandings because we can't really experience death and reflect upon it hence and use it

1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:45.880
 to motivate us, it has to remain some sort of abstraction.

1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:57.080
 And I think if we have trouble comprehending true abstraction, we tend to view ourselves

1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:00.400
 as nearly immortal and I think that is very dangerous.

1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:09.840
 So one concrete implication for my belief in abstraction would be that we all need to

1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:21.280
 be aware of our own deaths and we need to understand concretely the boundaries of our

1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:26.960
 lifetimes and no amount of experience can really motivate that.

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:31.840
 It has to be driven by thought and abstraction in theory.

1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:37.120
 That's one of the deepest elements of what it means to be human is our ability to form

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:41.280
 abstractions about our mortality versus animals.

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:47.880
 I think there's just something really fundamental about our interaction with the abstractions

1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:59.800
 of death and there's a lot of philosophers that say that that's actually core to everything

1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:09.000
 we create in this world which is us struggling with this impossible to understand idea of

1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:10.000
 mortality.

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:18.480
 I mean, I'm drawn to this idea because both the mystery of it but also just from the human

1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:24.240
 experience perspective, it seems that you get a lot of meaning from stuff ending.

1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:31.400
 It's kind of sad to flip side of that to think that stuff won't be as meaningful if it doesn't

1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:32.920
 end, if it's not finite.

1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:40.480
 It seems like resources gain value from being finite and that's true for time, that's true

1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:46.840
 for the deliciousness of ice cream, that's true for love, for everything, for music and

1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:49.840
 so on.

1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:58.240
 It seems deeply human to try to, as you said, concretize the abstractions of mortality even

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:02.640
 though it can never truly experience it because that's the whole point of it.

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:06.120
 Once it ends, you can't experience it.

1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:11.040
 Again, another ridiculous question.

1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:13.280
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:15.120
 What's the meaning of life?

1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:22.960
 From your deep thinking about this world, is there a good way to answer any of the why

1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:26.960
 questions about this existence here on Earth?

1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:32.680
 As I said, we're here in part by principle and in part by accident and a lot of the things

1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:46.840
 which bring us joy are programmed to bring us joy to ensure our evolutionary success.

1:41:46.840 --> 1:41:57.280
 I would not necessarily consider all of the things which bring us joy to be meaningful.

1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:05.200
 I think they play a very obvious role in a clear pattern and we don't have much choice

1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:06.200
 in that.

1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:13.040
 I think that outrules the idea of joy being the meaning of life.

1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:22.400
 I think it's a nice thing we get to have even if it's not inherently meaningful.

1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:41.720
 I think the most wonderful thing that we have ever been given has been our ability to,

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:48.320
 as I said, observe what transcends us as humans.

1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:56.520
 I think to live a meaningful life is to see that and hopefully contribute to that.

1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:03.120
 To try to understand what makes us human and to transcend that and in some small way contribute

1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:11.920
 to it in the finite time we have here.

1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:16.160
 Those are some powerful words that you're a truly special human being.

1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:17.600
 It's really an honor to talk to you.

1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:25.720
 I'm just a newborn fan of yours and I can't wait to see how you push the world.

1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:34.280
 Please embrace the fear you feel and be bold and I think you will do some special things

1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:35.280
 in this world.

1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:38.800
 I'm confident if the world doesn't destroy you and I hope it doesn't.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:45.800
 Be strong, be brave, you're an inspiration, keep doing your thing and thanks for talking

1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:46.800
 to me.

1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:47.800
