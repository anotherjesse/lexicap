00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
 The following is a conversation with Tom Brands, Olympic champion and world champion in freestyle

00:05.600 --> 00:12.080
 wrestling, three time NCAA wrestling champion at University of Iowa and one of the greatest

00:12.080 --> 00:18.160
 coaches in the history of wrestling, leading the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for 15 years,

00:18.160 --> 00:25.920
 including in 2021, winning the national championships and getting a Coach of the Year award, his third.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.640
 He is known for his intensity, focus and mental toughness, embodying both as a wrestler and coach,

00:32.640 --> 00:38.880
 the culture and spirit of Iowa wrestling. We recorded this conversation almost exactly three

00:38.880 --> 00:46.640
 years ago after I attended the University of Iowa versus Iowa State wrestling meet in the historic

00:46.640 --> 00:53.600
 Carver Hawkeye Arena. Tom graciously invited me to his home or his family, a couple of friends and me

00:53.600 --> 01:00.640
 spent several hours chatting about wrestling and life. We recorded this brief podcast conversation

01:00.640 --> 01:07.680
 that evening and I wasn't sure where, how or whether we'll publish it but returning to it now

01:07.680 --> 01:13.440
 three years later, I realized just how meaningful that evening was for me and even though I was

01:13.440 --> 01:18.720
 nervous, didn't even put on my jacket, it's the moment I would love to share with others.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.400
 The mix of intensity and heartfelt kindness from Tom and his family made me want to stay in Iowa

01:24.400 --> 01:30.960
 forever. I think I will return there soon enough because of the amazing people there and because

01:30.960 --> 01:37.360
 Iowa is still in many ways the heart of the indomitable spirit of American wrestling,

01:37.360 --> 01:44.240
 a sport I love and to which I'm deeply grateful for humbling me early in life and helping me

01:44.240 --> 01:52.800
 and many others build character through hard work. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

01:52.800 --> 01:59.040
 please check out our sponsors in the description and now here's my conversation with Tom Brands.

02:00.160 --> 02:06.960
 What's the best motivator for you or for your athletes? Hatred of losing or love of winning?

02:08.080 --> 02:12.400
 For me personally, it was definitely the hatred of losing. I was not a guy that was about pageantry.

02:12.400 --> 02:22.400
 I was not a guy that was about the parade. When I wrestled in Atlanta, I rented a three cylinder

02:22.400 --> 02:25.920
 geo with my wife, drove home and mowed the lawn because it hadn't been mowed for a month.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.320
 And I remember one of our neighbors driving by and they were like, they did a double take.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.920
 Like, well, that's the, I thought he was in Atlanta. Well, I wasn't in Atlanta yesterday,

02:33.920 --> 02:39.040
 just sat on the stand and got a gold medal put around my neck. That's how I was. That doesn't

02:39.040 --> 02:43.360
 mean that it was the right approach or the wrong approach. It's just what worked for me.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.120
 But when you were a kid, you and Terry, you dreamed about winning that Olympic gold.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.920
 Yeah. That's what winning then. There is the lure of winning, but what drives you is that

02:55.840 --> 03:02.400
 as you move forward, there's just no reason that you have to settle for anything but being the best.

03:02.400 --> 03:09.440
 And if it just, it would get to you to the point where that's not going to happen to me again.

03:10.640 --> 03:15.360
 So what, the thing that keeps you up at night is the, the losses and that's not,

03:15.360 --> 03:18.800
 that's not going to happen to me again. That's the thought that keeps you up at night.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.240
 That's the thought that drives you when you're training. That's why you do,

03:23.360 --> 03:28.560
 you know, nine ropes when Gable says do three ropes and buddy pushups and you're out of here

03:28.560 --> 03:33.840
 and you do nine or you do them until you can't do any more. And it's a very rare

03:33.840 --> 03:36.400
 ingredient. The older I get, the more rare I find it is.

03:37.680 --> 03:44.240
 The ingredient of loss, feeding, feeding that the drive of hard training.

03:44.240 --> 03:49.280
 Maybe that because everybody's so worried about the negative of whatever and you're

03:49.280 --> 03:53.840
 putting too much pressure on yourself. So maybe that, but what I meant was it's when a coach says,

03:53.840 --> 04:00.240
 okay, finished with four ropes and you know, buddy pushups and four way neck, you know,

04:00.240 --> 04:05.360
 I would do 12 or 10. That's rare. It's no longer about what the coach says.

04:05.360 --> 04:12.080
 It's your own demons that you're trying to exercise out. What's the few losses you've had

04:12.080 --> 04:17.920
 in your life? Are all of them just melt together? Or is there something that stands out in your

04:17.920 --> 04:28.640
 mind? I'm a guy that remembers my career that well. I know that I am judged on a very small

04:28.640 --> 04:34.000
 portion of my life and that's minutes of wrestling matches. You know, a lot of winning,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.720
 but there's some losing in there too. And you know, people think they know you because of that.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.320
 And they think they know you because they see you in a press conference. But

04:42.320 --> 04:49.440
 um, you know, to go back to the original question, you know, I don't know how to answer that. So

04:49.440 --> 04:57.040
 there's no losses that just that eat at you still. There's opponents that I have learned a great deal

04:57.040 --> 05:06.160
 from. I mean, my loss to John Smith, uh, in 1991, um, US Open was something that I learned a lot

05:07.040 --> 05:11.520
 about. Um, I learned a lot about positioning. I learned a lot about the importance of parterre,

05:11.520 --> 05:17.920
 um, you know, in a certain kind of crazy way, I learned that I could go with the best guy in

05:17.920 --> 05:22.720
 the world, even though it was 14 to four. And this is when tech falls were 15 or 12 points,

05:22.720 --> 05:27.040
 I didn't get tech fall. And I wasn't, that wasn't a badge of honor for me, but I knew I could go

05:27.040 --> 05:32.160
 with him because it was one point takedowns. I scored four takedowns on him. And I learned that

05:32.160 --> 05:38.400
 I had to move my feet. Um, and I learned what it meant to move your feet constantly. And there's

05:38.400 --> 05:45.840
 no break. John Smith is a very, very intense competitor that people know that now, six time

05:45.840 --> 05:53.440
 world Olympic champion. And I felt that firsthand, but I did not go in there, um, taking a backseat,

05:53.440 --> 05:59.120
 even though the score, um, was very lopsided. But you knew you could stand with the best of the

05:59.120 --> 06:06.000
 world. I knew that I, this is what this is about. And you know what, you move your feet and you

06:06.000 --> 06:10.800
 don't give up a lace that's so damn tight that it, you're, you can't, you know, feel your calf

06:10.800 --> 06:14.640
 muscle, you know, and I had to get ready for the consolation side of the bracket. Cause I believe

06:14.640 --> 06:20.720
 that was in the semis, you know, you know, you just learned from that. And it was, it was better

06:20.720 --> 06:27.760
 than learning from, you know, a win over a second ranked senior level guy when you're a junior in

06:27.760 --> 06:36.560
 college, you know, you rest on the best on a stage. So if you look back, you probably spent tens of

06:36.560 --> 06:43.120
 thousands of hours on the mat, spilled sweat, blood, even tears, maybe, maybe a few times.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.920
 So technically or philosophically, how would you do any of those hours differently? Just

06:47.920 --> 06:55.520
 looking back at the tens of thousands of hours, I would be more probably in my older age. I

06:55.520 --> 07:01.280
 probably would have been more relaxed in my training and probably would have went another cycle,

07:01.280 --> 07:08.400
 if I could do it over again. In 96, I really thought that when Gable retired, that I would be the

07:08.400 --> 07:12.720
 next guy in line and I was wrong and that was immature of me. In terms of the coach.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.840
 In terms of the coach, yes. And I knew that Gable was close. I mean, I didn't know when, but it just

07:17.840 --> 07:23.200
 so happens, you know, 97 was his record breaking year and then he retired. But I didn't know how

07:23.200 --> 07:29.280
 close he was, but I knew that he had, you know, he went down with a bad hip injury. And so, you

07:29.280 --> 07:35.440
 know, you're just, you're not going to. So what is, what is the relaxed Tom Brands looks like?

07:35.440 --> 07:40.400
 You're saying you would have been a little more relaxed? More like where, you know what, I was

07:40.400 --> 07:45.120
 pretty dang good and I was getting better every day, but maybe doing a little bit different,

07:45.120 --> 07:52.560
 a little bit smarter and Terry actually did that going through 2000. He had to do it and

07:52.560 --> 08:00.480
 he would have been in the, you know, the funny farm, let alone the, you know, the physical farm,

08:00.480 --> 08:06.160
 whatever you want to say, mentally and physically beat up. But he had to learn to

08:07.920 --> 08:15.760
 less as more type of approach. And how it came around was, is, you know, you work hard at feeling

08:15.760 --> 08:23.680
 good. You work hard in your recovery. So even when you're not wrestling hard in that wrestling room

08:23.680 --> 08:31.280
 and looking for the toughest partner to go, you're still working hard in your recovery and

08:31.280 --> 08:38.560
 massage could be that stretching could be that thing, things like that that are more fluffy.

08:38.560 --> 08:46.480
 And that's something you weren't as good at recovery? There's not a place for it with young

08:46.480 --> 08:54.160
 people because in my opinion, there's so much development to have happened. I mean, when you

08:54.160 --> 09:01.760
 need to learn wrestling, you need to be wrestling. And as you get older, your body won't do it

09:01.760 --> 09:08.880
 anymore. And so to learn wrestling, it's more of a probably a relaxed approach. So if you had to

09:08.880 --> 09:16.720
 choose between two athletes, who would dominate competition, one who drills 100,000 reps of a

09:16.720 --> 09:22.560
 specific takedown, specific technique, or one that spends that time live wrestling, both,

09:23.120 --> 09:27.840
 it's the same. And I like to live wrestling, I was always wanting to live wrestling, bring the

09:27.840 --> 09:33.600
 warm up into the live wrestle, let's go. But where I got really, really good was a repetition.

09:34.160 --> 09:40.480
 And I was disciplined enough to know that the things that you hate to do in this sport are the

09:40.480 --> 09:45.760
 things that make you the very best. And that is a rare ingredient, as I've gotten older.

09:45.760 --> 09:50.800
 And you spend a lot of time communicating that to younger athletes. So the thing,

09:51.520 --> 09:55.280
 if you feel yourself hating something, that's probably the thing you should be doing.

09:55.280 --> 09:59.120
 Yes. As a matter of fact, I had a strength coach when I was really young. He was just a

09:59.840 --> 10:05.680
 freaking guy that would, he wore white, like he was almost like a nurse, nurses clothes.

10:05.680 --> 10:11.840
 He wore all white from head to toe. And he was in Cheyenne, Wyoming. And his first name was Walt.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.280
 And he taught Terry and I to hate the bar away from you on that last rep when you're dead.

10:17.840 --> 10:22.400
 And whether it's a curl, you hate it up. And then you do the negative and you hate it down.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.240
 And you hate that bench up and you hate it. You look at the bar and you hate it away from you.

10:27.280 --> 10:34.000
 So, you know, I learned and I was young. I was young. And I remember being bored,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.280
 my mom's sister lived out there. And we were dropped off to stay out there with her cousins.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.280
 And I was bored a little bit. And they always treated us really good. But this was like the

10:42.480 --> 10:49.840
 single most bright spot in a weightlifting, like enlightenment, even though I lifted weights.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.840
 But I never knew the psychology behind lifting weights. It's just to look good.

10:53.840 --> 10:58.160
 And so you could flex and look in the mirror or is it for performance? And this guy was about

10:58.160 --> 11:02.960
 performance. And you said repetition. Do you mean technique?

11:02.960 --> 11:06.880
 I'm talking repetition, technique, technique, technique, drill, drill, drill, hit, hit, hit,

11:06.880 --> 11:08.800
 hit, hit, drive, finish, hit, hit, hit, hit, drive, finish.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.360
 So you believe in that? You believe in that wholeheartedly?

11:11.360 --> 11:15.440
 So, I mean... And I believe that you have to do it on your own.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.360
 I don't believe in the coach taking you to the promised land.

11:19.360 --> 11:25.840
 So in the guys today, or in yourself, how often do you see people that

11:26.560 --> 11:30.320
 grow the belief of doing 10,000, 20,000 reps?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.920
 I think it's rare. I think it's very rare. And I think it's especially rare.

11:33.920 --> 11:39.440
 I mean, you can talk about that as a coach, but it's especially rare to bring a guide to that

11:39.440 --> 11:43.920
 understanding, but you never stop trying. You're always trying to reach out to them.

11:43.920 --> 11:48.160
 You're always trying to reach them. I mean, we didn't have a good performance

11:48.160 --> 11:52.000
 out there tonight, but you know what? You don't stop communicating.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.280
 And there's a lot of programs out there that put their head down

11:57.920 --> 12:00.560
 when things aren't going their way. And then as things start going their way,

12:00.560 --> 12:05.840
 then they rise with the tide. There was no difference in the demeanor of our corner.

12:05.840 --> 12:10.000
 And we talk about that. That's a philosophy. And so you're reaching your guys that way.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.360
 So go back to your point or your question. Do you believe in the 10,000 reps? And yes,

12:17.360 --> 12:23.120
 I do. But how do you inspire people to do that? So by example, but communication.

12:23.120 --> 12:30.400
 But I mean, in my experience, what I've seen communicating the value of repetition and drilling

12:30.400 --> 12:34.080
 is a hard thing to communicate. It's hard. And it's very rare to have somebody that

12:34.080 --> 12:39.200
 goes in there and will do it on their own. Do you have young guys that step up and do that?

12:39.200 --> 12:44.320
 We do. And it's rare. And the guys that do it on their own and have done it on their own are the

12:44.320 --> 12:51.600
 guys that are in that lineup and doing well. The other thing is, is that when you talk about

12:52.240 --> 12:59.200
 getting to that next level, a lot of times it's, you know, what held you back was I did everything

12:59.200 --> 13:05.440
 the coach asked of me and nothing more. But I mean, you could be a great guy for,

13:05.440 --> 13:11.760
 for an, for a coach as an athlete, and you did everything that coach asked, but you did nothing

13:11.760 --> 13:18.160
 more. So you're really looking for the guys that go way beyond what the coach says. We don't want

13:18.160 --> 13:23.360
 guys that are looking at their watch running out of the room when practice is over. We want guys

13:23.360 --> 13:28.000
 that know what they have to get done and they might leave early, but they're not looking at their

13:28.000 --> 13:33.440
 watch. They might be done early. They might be, we might be on a whole different path. And this

13:33.440 --> 13:39.360
 guy just excuses himself. I'm all about that. We are not, we are not autocrats.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.160
 There's an internal engine in there. Is that something you're born with?

13:42.720 --> 13:47.840
 Or is that something you can develop? I think you are born with it. You develop it also. And I

13:47.840 --> 13:53.200
 think that there has to be comfort and then go back to the communication that young people are

13:54.240 --> 13:57.840
 comfortable enough to communicate that I need to take the day off.

13:57.840 --> 14:04.080
 So what do you mean by communication? Just let, exactly. So letting, letting athletes

14:05.680 --> 14:10.560
 be part of their own development. Communication to me is, is letting them know

14:11.760 --> 14:15.760
 what they're, what they need to do to get themselves in contention to be the starting

14:15.760 --> 14:23.760
 quarterback. And then to give them boosts and compliments when they earn them.

14:23.760 --> 14:35.760
 And I don't have time to waste with, with lies and cheating. And when I say cheating,

14:35.760 --> 14:40.000
 I'm talking about when they cheat themselves. And so there, those become very direct conversations.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.160
 And the conversation starts like this. I don't have time to waste and neither do you.

14:44.960 --> 14:49.920
 And so why are we wasting our time? And here's what I mean by that. We're having a conversation

14:49.920 --> 14:56.640
 about, you know, your accountability. If you look in the mirror and you're accountable, then we are,

14:56.640 --> 15:01.520
 we aren't taking the time to go through this. We're already on our way to solving the problem.

15:01.520 --> 15:07.760
 Problem can't be solved without that understanding. And that has to do with symptoms that you see in

15:07.760 --> 15:10.560
 the wrestling room. There's something where the fire is not quite there. That has to do with

15:10.560 --> 15:15.680
 mental, emotional, spiritual, physical, everything, everything that you know about.

15:15.680 --> 15:20.640
 You know, I had a boss and our athletic director is a great athletic director and he gives us

15:20.640 --> 15:24.720
 everything we need to be successful. But I had a boss, his name was Fred Mims. I didn't think

15:24.720 --> 15:28.880
 anybody could be better than him. And then all of a sudden this Gene Taylor guy came in. And I

15:28.880 --> 15:33.760
 didn't, and then he was pretty doggone good too. And he actually, you know, was just like Fred and

15:33.760 --> 15:38.000
 maybe even a little bit more current. And then he ended up taking a job at Kansas State where he's

15:38.000 --> 15:44.080
 the athletic director now. And, and then this, this lady Barbara Burke comes in. And I didn't

15:44.080 --> 15:48.880
 think anybody could be better than Gene Taylor or Fred Mims. And this Barbara Burke, she's better

15:48.880 --> 15:54.080
 than both of them. And the reason why is because she's a problem solver. She doesn't waste time.

15:54.080 --> 15:58.800
 She's correct. And she's a problem solver. And that's what we need. You need problem solvers.

16:01.120 --> 16:09.280
 So on the flip side of problems and technique and repetition, here's a thing called toughness,

16:09.280 --> 16:14.720
 mental toughness, something that maybe you or maybe even Iowa in general is a little bit

16:14.720 --> 16:21.840
 known for. So how do you train mental toughness as a coach? You train mental toughness by putting

16:21.840 --> 16:28.640
 them in situations that they're willing to go through, but don't think they can make it. And

16:28.640 --> 16:32.640
 then they go through it. And then all of a sudden those barriers are down. Is that have to do

16:32.640 --> 16:41.280
 with physical, usually exhaustion, the wraps on the ropes? It has to do with that. And it has to

16:41.280 --> 16:47.920
 do with understanding why we're doing it. And sometimes understanding why we're doing it might

16:47.920 --> 16:54.480
 not come for months, but there's blind faith. And we have a heavy weight in the room right now,

16:54.480 --> 17:00.480
 this, this young guy that he's like that. He doesn't necessarily understand it. He has a lot

17:00.480 --> 17:05.760
 of questions, but he doesn't. And he's been here four months now, four and a half months now,

17:05.760 --> 17:10.320
 and he's getting better every day. So mental toughness too is a matter of repetition.

17:11.200 --> 17:15.280
 That mental toughness is a matter of repetition and having an open mind and being extremely

17:15.280 --> 17:22.960
 accountable. And not only accountable that when you maybe, when something doesn't go your way,

17:22.960 --> 17:27.920
 that you look in the mirror and own it, but accountable to the point of view that, you know

17:27.920 --> 17:32.800
 what, I got to get tough in this situation right here, right now. And this is what's going to make

17:32.800 --> 17:38.000
 or break me. And I talked about my own career being defined by, you know, a couple of minutes on the

17:38.000 --> 17:43.760
 mat. But that's when you're going to be defined. That's how you're going to be defined. That's

17:43.760 --> 17:48.080
 okay. So people are going to talk about you. So you might as well have them talking about how

17:48.080 --> 17:56.880
 doggone tough you are. What about we live in a world now, I've often in my own work, I hear about

17:56.880 --> 18:03.920
 these concepts of work life balance or overtraining. So you've been one of the hardest workers ever on

18:03.920 --> 18:08.720
 the mat. You've coached some of the hardest workers ever. Do you think it's possible to

18:08.720 --> 18:15.840
 overtrain train too much? How big of a concern is it peaking and burnout or frames of mind or

18:15.840 --> 18:22.320
 burnout is a, is a, like you let things probably get to the point where you could have arrested them

18:22.320 --> 18:28.080
 with a good frame of mind, but peaking is a frame of mind. And, you know, you have to know,

18:28.080 --> 18:33.120
 be able to read, and that's a lot of it. And the individual athlete also has to know

18:33.920 --> 18:38.480
 that it's a frame of mind. And so when you have a coach that's reading that the right way,

18:39.200 --> 18:45.040
 and you have an athlete that is knowing that when zero hour comes that you're going to be ready to

18:45.040 --> 18:50.480
 go. And knowing that there's light at the end of the tunnel, if you feel like you're burning that

18:50.480 --> 18:54.880
 candle at both ends, light's coming at the end of the tunnel. I mean, you're good to go.

18:55.520 --> 19:01.840
 So you think about Gable and that whole dream of being carried off the mat because you worked so

19:01.840 --> 19:07.040
 hard. And again, do you think it's possible to overtrain? So you said it's a, it's mental.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.240
 I do think it's possible to overtrain if you have a lot of distractions.

19:11.040 --> 19:16.000
 And if you're looking at your watch running out of the room, then yeah, you're going to,

19:16.000 --> 19:21.440
 that frame of mind isn't going to lend itself to excellence. And the thing is, is we have to

19:21.440 --> 19:26.080
 accomplish what we need to get accomplished and get better every day. You can't kind of accomplish

19:26.080 --> 19:32.000
 what you need to accomplish. You have to accomplish it. And when you're in that mindset, then the

19:32.000 --> 19:37.200
 clock is irrelevant. There's no place for a clock in the wrestling room. And maybe a clock that

19:37.200 --> 19:43.680
 times a match, but it may be a clock if, you know, we're student athletes here, but that's why we

19:43.680 --> 19:49.440
 encourage our, you know, when you schedule your classes that you don't have a class that comes

19:49.440 --> 19:56.960
 right up to, you know, practice time or starts as a night class and it starts at 530, you know,

19:56.960 --> 20:02.080
 go to get the 630 class or the seven o clock. So you leave it all behind your heart, your passion

20:02.080 --> 20:06.640
 is complete. And then there's no, when you walk in that wrestling room, there's no distractions.

20:06.640 --> 20:12.800
 And it's never eternal. The only thing that's eternal is death. You know, there's nothing,

20:12.800 --> 20:18.400
 sometimes guys come in there and they wig out. Oh, it's an hour and 25 minutes.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.400
 Or an hour and 45 minutes. You have to be willing to go as long as it takes. There's no clock.

20:26.400 --> 20:31.120
 There's no clock. Again, wrestlers are some of the hardest, some of the toughest people

20:31.760 --> 20:38.400
 in all of sports, but weight cutting often breaks people. So what's your thought on weight cutting,

20:38.400 --> 20:44.240
 both nutrition wise, mental wise, how do you approach and think of it as a coach in your own

20:44.240 --> 20:51.280
 career too? It's a lot of discipline and it's a lot of discipline during a very uncomfortable

20:51.280 --> 20:54.960
 time period that really doesn't last that long, but it feels like it lasts long and it's painful.

20:55.760 --> 21:01.360
 And but once you shrink your body down, and if you're hydrated, you'll get through it. If you're

21:01.360 --> 21:07.840
 a little hungry, but you're eating, but you're hydrated, once you break that sweat, your energy

21:07.840 --> 21:14.480
 depletion goes away. That's a fact. I've practiced that. You come in and you're yawning and you're,

21:14.480 --> 21:17.920
 you know, you're starting to shrink your body down. And it's that time of year where, hey,

21:17.920 --> 21:24.240
 I got to get my body shrunk down. And you're dehydrated, you are dead in the water. But if you're

21:24.240 --> 21:31.920
 hungry and hydrated, when you break that sweat. Have people gotten better with that over the years

21:31.920 --> 21:37.360
 over the past few decades? I think that coaches science is better. I think that coaches communicate

21:37.360 --> 21:43.760
 it. I think they always have. I think the bottom line is, is having the energy to implement that

21:43.760 --> 21:49.840
 and taking a guy by the hand when he doesn't understand and he's new in your program and he's

21:49.840 --> 21:54.320
 essential and or he's unwilling to and not disciplined enough because when you take him

21:54.320 --> 22:00.560
 by the hand enough, they will learn that discipline. This is an important aspect of wrestling, buddy.

22:00.560 --> 22:05.760
 You know what I'm saying? So, you know, it's not just go and show up for the match.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.440
 I mean, it's not about just making weight either. You got to be able to make weight. That's part of

22:09.440 --> 22:14.640
 the warmup. That's part of the process. Getting ready to wrestle. The whole thing. It's a lifestyle.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.440
 Yeah. When did you first start believing you're going to win Olympic gold?

22:20.720 --> 22:26.080
 I don't know. I mean, I found out I got really addicted to wrestling really, really fast,

22:26.640 --> 22:33.200
 started late, but looking back at my life, wrestled my whole life with my twin brother.

22:33.200 --> 22:41.680
 And when Terry and I would fight, it was wrestling and it was to maim. And so, if you're trying to

22:41.680 --> 22:48.320
 maim me, I better be tough because if I roll over and expect you to scratch my belly when you're

22:48.320 --> 22:53.600
 trying to maim me, I won't lose my head. And Tom and Terry Brands, there was no alpha male.

22:54.640 --> 23:00.080
 And when it was on, it was on for real. What do you mean there's no alpha male? There's both.

23:00.080 --> 23:06.640
 There's both. There's a lot of twins. There's a dominant twin. Oh, a lot of them. Very few times

23:06.640 --> 23:12.240
 is there a situation where you're going to, I'm going to win every time and everything. And then

23:12.240 --> 23:17.040
 he's thinking the same exact way. And Terry used to describe it like when we used to get interviewed

23:17.040 --> 23:23.200
 a lot about our careers, like it'd be like you grabbing a steering wheel and me grabbing a steering

23:23.200 --> 23:28.640
 wheel and fighting. And that's what it was like when you would wrestle him or fight him. And so,

23:28.640 --> 23:33.360
 I had that benefit. So when did I know, well, I got addicted to wrestling really, really fast

23:33.360 --> 23:39.920
 in fifth grade and started to research it. And I don't know why. And talked about the Olympics and

23:41.280 --> 23:47.680
 put it in my head and remember said something about being an Olympic champion in fifth grade.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.480
 And somebody made fun of me and I got into fighting the playground. And I remember

23:52.480 --> 23:59.360
 getting pulled in, getting in trouble for that. And the people that got me in trouble for that

23:59.360 --> 24:05.360
 were smart enough to not rake me over the coals, but they researched or they actually found out

24:05.360 --> 24:12.000
 what the fight was about. And I was distraught. I was really emotional, like crying or whatever

24:12.000 --> 24:17.440
 you want to say. You don't want to admit that to me. But it wasn't because I got beat up or got

24:17.440 --> 24:24.080
 my nose bloody or got punched in the face or broke my arm or there was any pain. It was because

24:24.080 --> 24:30.800
 they stomped on my dream and they doubted me. And so I fought for that. And that was a lesson.

24:30.800 --> 24:37.280
 There's going to be a lot of doubters. And one thing we talk about as a staff is our staff

24:37.280 --> 24:44.880
 has to be locked up in that hallway, in our offices. And when you deviate outside of that,

24:44.880 --> 24:51.680
 that is heresy. So everybody has to be on board confident that you're going to be number one in

24:51.680 --> 24:56.000
 the country. We go forward and we go put our public foot forward. There is a decision. We

24:56.000 --> 25:01.440
 are unified and there is no backbiting. And we have great people right now. And we hadn't had that

25:01.440 --> 25:07.040
 before. We've had detractors in our Hawkeye wrestling club. We've had guys that would go out and get

25:07.040 --> 25:13.040
 rolled up in ankle laces and not care in our club. And we got Brandon Swanson who got rolled up by

25:13.040 --> 25:18.320
 James Green last night. But I'll tell you what, I don't have a problem with that. You know why?

25:18.320 --> 25:23.200
 Because I know it means a lot to him. He didn't roll over. He didn't quit because he was on the

25:23.200 --> 25:29.120
 consolation side of a bracket. And so when you have that and then you have, you know, if there's

25:29.120 --> 25:33.760
 a disagreement, it's behind closed doors and then you're moving forward. And when you have people

25:33.760 --> 25:38.560
 that when they're meeting your fans and your supporters, you know, they're talking the right

25:38.560 --> 25:44.080
 way with the right message. And anything that's catty won't kiss to that. You got to be careful

25:44.080 --> 25:50.160
 there. You got to be careful there. So that in terms of affirmations, in terms of really believing

25:50.160 --> 25:56.640
 as a team, as an individual believing that you're the best in the world. Did you, I'm sure you had

25:56.640 --> 26:01.680
 detractors. You had people that continued after fifth grade. And that's probably where my hatred

26:01.680 --> 26:09.120
 of losing trumps my love for winning because I wanted to shove it up their rear end bad. Yeah.

26:10.640 --> 26:16.240
 And the thing is, is we maintain a high level and there's very few programs, Oklahoma State,

26:16.960 --> 26:22.640
 Ohio State now, Penn State. I mean, there's four programs that try to win a national title every

26:22.640 --> 26:28.400
 year. And that's it. And these, these, these other teams, they get up and they got a good team and

26:28.400 --> 26:33.280
 they get up and they get going. And then when, when things don't go well, okay, we're going to do it

26:33.280 --> 26:37.360
 next year. Or this is a down year. We're going to, we're going to get right. We're three years out.

26:37.920 --> 26:42.000
 So no matter what you're fighting for first, we do. And we haven't won. And you say, well,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.400
 we won in eight years. Well, you're right. We haven't. But look at our results are better,

26:46.400 --> 26:51.120
 better than anybody out there. And it's, and besides Penn State, and it's because of our

26:51.680 --> 26:56.560
 mentality and because we have great people. Ryan Morningstar, Bobby Telfer, Terry Brands,

26:56.560 --> 27:01.680
 our medical team, even our strength coach, Quinn Holland, we're all on the same page.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.000
 And when I send something, I hit it immediately. I don't have time to waste.

27:06.560 --> 27:10.880
 There will not be dissension in that hallway. Everybody's in together. Yeah.

27:11.680 --> 27:18.000
 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Can you take me through the day when you're going for the 62KG

27:19.040 --> 27:26.480
 gold? What did you eat, drink? What did you think? It really doesn't matter. I have a routine

27:26.480 --> 27:32.320
 that, you know, I had a routine as a competitor that I could run through right now. It was a lot

27:32.320 --> 27:38.880
 of self talk, very, very positive self talk. Visualization. Yes. Visualization, self talk.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.640
 And that's how I was able to relax and getting ready for matches my whole life.

27:45.440 --> 27:50.800
 Learned that very early age at a camp, at a developmental camp, at a young age, Terry and I

27:50.800 --> 27:59.680
 did. And I can tell you what I ate. And I can tell you what I did to relax. And it doesn't matter.

28:00.560 --> 28:07.120
 What you have to do is you have to find that piece. And I just know that when I was getting ready for

28:07.920 --> 28:15.120
 the finals match, I had gone back to my room. I had my relaxed material, you know, and I was able

28:15.120 --> 28:22.720
 to relax because I prepared for it. Hopefully I'm right on this. But just looking at the insane

28:22.720 --> 28:26.480
 bracket you had to go through, you had to beat, just to get to the finals, to be three world

28:26.480 --> 28:32.000
 champions, eventually world champion Dave. And you know what? I don't talk about that and nobody

28:32.000 --> 28:36.640
 else does either. But everybody talks about it in their own career. So now you're making my head

28:36.640 --> 28:42.960
 big. But yeah, I had a road. I had a road. You're right. That is the hardest bracket I've seen. So

28:42.960 --> 28:47.680
 I've talked to a lot of Olympic champions. That is the hardest bracket I've seen of any champion.

28:47.680 --> 28:52.720
 So maybe I'm confused on this, but it seemed like a really tough day for you. Did you have,

28:53.280 --> 28:56.720
 did you know the bracket ahead of time? Did you know who you faced?

28:56.720 --> 29:03.920
 You see the draw and it's a two day tournament. So psychology comes into it as much as physical

29:03.920 --> 29:10.640
 shape, you know, because there's those you got to sleep, you know, the night before after the

29:10.640 --> 29:14.640
 weigh in, then you got to sleep again that next night after you're set. My final match is going

29:14.640 --> 29:18.800
 to be in the morning, you know, and then you have to go back and rest because your final

29:18.800 --> 29:24.320
 matches and then tell whatever time it was. And so all this relaxation and all that stuff that

29:24.320 --> 29:27.840
 you just talked about, that visualization and self talk, that's what helps is your routine.

29:29.120 --> 29:33.360
 And was there any doubts, any fear, any, anything there?

29:33.360 --> 29:39.120
 The fear is the type of fear. And I just talked about this to one of my athletes today,

29:39.120 --> 29:46.240
 Jack Dempsey talked about fear and the fear of losing is what motivated him to try to take his

29:46.240 --> 29:53.920
 opponent's head off. He was a boxer and that's okay. So fear of competition, fear of screwing

29:53.920 --> 29:59.920
 up, fear of, oh, I don't feel good. No, no, but that little fear that, you know what, there's

29:59.920 --> 30:04.720
 somebody out there that thinks that, you know what, they're going to, they're going to revel in my,

30:04.720 --> 30:09.920
 they're going to, they're going to, they're going to eat it up in my misery. They're going to love,

30:09.920 --> 30:14.480
 they're going to be thriving because I fail. And I'm not going to let that happen.

30:15.920 --> 30:22.240
 You're identical twin brother, Terry, you've been at him, like you said, your whole life. And you're

30:22.240 --> 30:27.680
 both some of the greatest wrestlers of all time. You won the gold medal, he won the bronze medal.

30:28.320 --> 30:33.440
 You've mentioned, you know, all that really matters is the six minutes or, you know, just a

30:33.440 --> 30:37.680
 few minutes, sometimes a few seconds to find your whole career. So how do you think about

30:37.680 --> 30:42.480
 that thin line, the tragic line at the Olympic level between winning and losing?

30:42.480 --> 30:47.760
 I think you come to peace that in the end, when it's over, that you did the best you could.

30:48.560 --> 30:54.800
 And that's certainly the case with Terry. He has a career credentials are better than mine

30:54.800 --> 31:00.400
 internationally. You know, he won two world championships. I won one and he won an Olympic

31:00.400 --> 31:06.880
 bronze medal. And you know, I won an Olympic gold medal, but I only won one. And the thing is, is

31:07.520 --> 31:13.680
 that's not what's important anyway. What's important is, is that when it's all over,

31:14.720 --> 31:21.200
 you know, how do you look back on it? And you're kind of like, well, you just said that you made

31:21.200 --> 31:25.600
 sure that you weren't going to leave anything undone. But you know what, there were tournaments

31:25.600 --> 31:29.760
 where I did leave things undone. And so how do you come back from that? Well, Terry never came

31:29.760 --> 31:34.880
 back from 2000 because he retired. Well, you know what, you duplicate and exceed

31:35.520 --> 31:39.760
 when you're communicating to these young athletes. And because of that experience,

31:39.760 --> 31:45.680
 that makes Terry a better coach. Because of, you know, 1995, that makes me a better coach.

31:46.560 --> 31:52.800
 You know, realizing that there are certain things that unraveled in that year that I could

31:52.800 --> 31:58.640
 have control looking back on it. And when you have that perspective, you can communicate.

31:58.640 --> 32:04.640
 So what control is there? Can you control everything? How big of a role is luck?

32:04.640 --> 32:11.120
 Control how you react to an injury. Control that. So you can't, you don't have any control over it.

32:11.120 --> 32:19.360
 It's over, you know, you have whatever and whatever happened, but relax and you learn to deal with

32:19.360 --> 32:24.720
 injuries matter because of that. You have that experience that you let this thing maybe get

32:24.720 --> 32:32.240
 the best of you. And that's just an example. And, you know, Terry put a lot of demons to rest

32:32.880 --> 32:38.960
 with that bronze medal. So becoming an Olympic medalist, a few demons could relax.

32:38.960 --> 32:43.440
 Well, a little, he will never admit that. And he probably is truthful. And I should,

32:43.440 --> 32:49.760
 I'm speaking for him, but he's truthful when he says that. But if I look at it and bronze sucks,

32:49.760 --> 32:58.240
 but if I look at it, he did put some demons to rest and I'm proud of him for it. There's

32:58.240 --> 33:06.720
 something there that is a consolation in the fact that he won the consolation medal. The consolation

33:06.720 --> 33:10.720
 medal sucks, but there is a consolation that he won the consolation medal. That's a tough

33:10.720 --> 33:17.280
 medal to win, by the way. Yeah. But do you see the, the Shakespearean tragedy of it all that

33:17.280 --> 33:22.800
 the line between winning and losing? So you often say that, you know, winning is everything, but

33:23.360 --> 33:27.920
 it feels like, especially at the Olympic level, or you talk about NCAA finals or

33:28.480 --> 33:36.000
 that tournament, you know, a split second mis move can result in a loss where you

33:36.000 --> 33:41.680
 dominated all the way up to there. That's where your psychology comes in. And that's where the

33:41.680 --> 33:47.920
 repetition and all of the self talk and visualization and the physical shape and everything comes

33:47.920 --> 33:55.600
 together. And so that doesn't happen. And tonight you, we got beat twice, actually three times and

33:55.600 --> 34:01.760
 we outwrestled those. We lost three matches and we outwrestled the guy for six minutes and 30

34:01.760 --> 34:09.360
 seconds or one match went to overtime. And if our guys can move forward with the right perspective,

34:09.360 --> 34:15.840
 I'm confident that they'll be better. I'll tell you what, I'd take our guy over their guy any day,

34:16.880 --> 34:21.600
 any day, because our guys get up for every match. And now we got a lot to work on.

34:22.960 --> 34:27.600
 Right. A lot to work on. But you know what, I could say all that and I'll take our guy and

34:27.600 --> 34:32.000
 blah, blah, blah. But what are they going to do tonight in their meal? How are they going to do

34:32.000 --> 34:36.800
 tonight and their rest? What are they going to do tomorrow in their recovery on their own

34:36.800 --> 34:46.960
 necessarily? What are they going to do Monday? Great wrestlers can use their imagination with a

34:46.960 --> 34:54.080
 win that they're not satisfied with and go forward as if it was a loss, but it's still

34:54.080 --> 35:00.800
 easier to go forward with that win. But they can, they don't just, oh, I want, I'm fine, goes on.

35:00.800 --> 35:05.920
 But then when they lose the exact same way that they could have lost before, then they go off the

35:05.920 --> 35:10.560
 deep end. And then that's when they're going to make the change in their life. And we talked about

35:10.560 --> 35:20.160
 that to our team tonight. And the mature, rare ingredient is guys that can get better even

35:20.160 --> 35:25.680
 with success like it was a loss without beating themselves out. That's complicated.

35:25.680 --> 35:31.360
 It is. It's a balance. You often talk about Iowa's focus on creating individual champions

35:31.360 --> 35:38.480
 like Spencer Lee. Can you explain the philosophy of focusing on individuals versus the team?

35:39.680 --> 35:46.800
 I think that we need to put them both together and the individual impacts the team. And

35:49.200 --> 35:54.320
 you know, we haven't done that since 2010. And we need to do a better job of putting 10 weight

35:54.320 --> 36:00.320
 classes out there that contribute to the team. And if it's not 10, then it's nine. And if it's

36:00.320 --> 36:06.560
 not nine, it can't be four. And that takes a lot of pride and it takes a lot of

36:08.960 --> 36:16.560
 where the coach is on top of it. And you're not just working on the easy things.

36:18.480 --> 36:25.040
 The glaring things, you're working on everything. What do you mean by everything? So the...

36:25.040 --> 36:34.240
 I like there's just some, you know, there's ideas that when you're a coach that aren't

36:34.240 --> 36:40.320
 there beneath the surface and you got to find them. And that's where communication comes in.

36:40.320 --> 36:45.760
 Yeah. But you're talking about, yeah, we got to move forward. What does that mean? Well,

36:45.760 --> 36:51.520
 I know what that means. But how many guys really know what that means in their program?

36:51.520 --> 36:58.400
 You know, there's so many levels of that. You've said before that winning is everything.

37:01.360 --> 37:07.280
 And that means people lose. Most people lose. You know, there's really in whatever the context

37:07.280 --> 37:12.640
 is only one winner. In many parts of our world today, outside of wrestling, that concept,

37:12.640 --> 37:19.120
 the brutal honesty of that is uncomfortable for people. So how do you think about this very

37:19.120 --> 37:27.520
 philosophical, difficult concept of, you know, there only being one winner that winning is

37:27.520 --> 37:34.160
 everything? This kind of really painful idea. I don't think that that's a bad thing to have

37:34.160 --> 37:39.680
 that mentality. I mean, I think at Kudakov, I remember a story I read about him, he comes to

37:39.680 --> 37:49.600
 mind, you know, Sargush, I remember when he lost in London. And I remember the look on his face.

37:49.600 --> 37:54.080
 And those are some of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport freestyle wrestling. And

37:55.840 --> 38:02.480
 you know, what it's what works for you. And you can talk about being at peace with your results

38:02.480 --> 38:09.520
 and that the approach is in the journey is what it's about. But and that's great. And that relaxes

38:09.520 --> 38:16.800
 some champions. And that makes some champions really, really tick. But not everybody. So it's

38:16.800 --> 38:23.920
 okay. It's okay. And if that wigs you out, that that really makes you uptight, then then go the

38:23.920 --> 38:29.520
 other route, you have to find what works for you. And that takes a lot of work. If you're lazy, forget

38:29.520 --> 38:39.360
 it. Forget it. So you and Terry, but in general, how do you find the line between extremely physical,

38:39.360 --> 38:44.560
 extreme physical wrestling and rough wrestling or angry wrestling? So to which degree has anger,

38:45.120 --> 38:49.760
 whether it's in your wrestling room these days or in your own career, entered wrestling? Do you see

38:49.760 --> 38:56.080
 it as a tool that can be used in the wrestling match? I think there's a balance and not even a

38:56.080 --> 39:01.200
 balance. There's a line that you go up to and you can't cross it. Sportsmanship is everything. You

39:01.200 --> 39:08.160
 can get dinged for points, you can get thrown out of tournaments. There's rules with flagrant

39:08.160 --> 39:13.920
 misconduct where you're kicked out of the match. Other team gets the points and then you have to

39:13.920 --> 39:22.000
 sit the next meet. So it's very serious. The NCAA sends a message, a very serious message about

39:22.000 --> 39:26.720
 sportsmanship. And so we talk about that. The other thing with wrestling is there's rules in

39:26.720 --> 39:34.240
 wrestling. These guys that are tough guys outside of the rules, that's what you want in your opponent.

39:34.240 --> 39:42.560
 That means they're frustrated. You've got to be a tough guy inside the rules of the sport.

39:43.680 --> 39:48.960
 That's more honorable than cold cocking somebody and knocking them out. So yeah, anger doesn't mean

39:48.960 --> 39:54.880
 breaking the rules. But I mean, a lot of people know you just watching you as a coach. There's

39:54.880 --> 39:59.360
 quite a bit of passion there. Well, come and do what you're doing tonight. I mean, break bread with me

39:59.360 --> 40:04.160
 in my kitchen and see how big of a jackass I am. Now you're a pretty nice guy. Well, I'm not asking

40:04.160 --> 40:10.560
 for that necessarily, but thanks. I'm saying, you know what, you as a coach, I mean, okay,

40:10.560 --> 40:16.720
 come spend a month in our program and you'll see really what kind of people we are. And there's a

40:16.720 --> 40:23.360
 stigma out there because they are very threatened by our program. There's nobody else that threatens

40:23.360 --> 40:30.240
 the sport of wrestling like we do. And that's the truth. There's a legend to Iowa wrestling. There's

40:31.120 --> 40:35.680
 it's one of the most intimidating. There's a legend to John Smith. It's the same thing.

40:36.320 --> 40:42.000
 But they get up for John Smith. They get up for Oklahoma State. They get up for Penn State.

40:43.440 --> 40:48.160
 My question is, okay, I'll answer it this way. I'll give you an example in my coaching career.

40:48.160 --> 40:54.240
 I coached at Virginia Tech for 22 months. We recruited the number one recruiting class.

40:54.960 --> 41:01.920
 We got the administration to change 100% 180 how they looked at wrestling. Here's the thing. And

41:01.920 --> 41:08.560
 because of how serious we were and because we weren't idiots, we were able to do that with our

41:08.560 --> 41:15.520
 administration. But my point is this, we tried to win. We tried to win even at Virginia Tech. It

41:15.520 --> 41:20.960
 wasn't a stepping stone for me. It ended up me in one quickly. And looking back on it, I was a fool

41:20.960 --> 41:27.520
 to think that I'd be there for 20 years. But you believed you would be. I did. I did. I did.

41:28.080 --> 41:35.040
 So do you remember a time that you really pushed yourself to your limits? So Gable talks about

41:35.040 --> 41:41.120
 having to be carried off the mat. Have you really found that level? I said something about that too

41:41.120 --> 41:46.560
 in a book. And I think I was misquoted one time. And actually it was Gable's quote. I was trying to

41:46.560 --> 41:53.360
 make the point that Gable's quote was like this. And they were making it like it was my own words.

41:53.360 --> 42:00.160
 I think it was a first wrestling tough book. But it's a good book. But the story's Gable's.

42:00.880 --> 42:08.400
 And I don't know if there's anybody that has done that besides him. And I think that's a very rare

42:08.400 --> 42:18.800
 quality. But I've definitely been in that nirvana level of either you could go all day long.

42:19.520 --> 42:25.840
 And you have to shoot me to stop me. Yeah. But there's a balance because you're not going hard

42:25.840 --> 42:35.280
 with and holding your breath. It's a relaxed. And like you got a guy cornered and who's most

42:35.280 --> 42:40.560
 dangerous. Well, the guy that's cornered. And so that's where you relax. I'm not bum rushing him.

42:41.360 --> 42:46.400
 I'm relaxed. I'm still moving fake and very fluid. Guy falls down in his face. I run around behind

42:46.400 --> 42:54.480
 him. That's offense. You don't have to just grunt to the leg and call that offense. Offense is a

42:55.520 --> 43:02.160
 in and out smooth. Now you sound like a Russian wrestler. Yeah. Well, that's they're the best.

43:02.160 --> 43:06.800
 In a certain light, looking at the history of wrestling, wrestling is much bigger than

43:06.800 --> 43:13.040
 folk style freestyle Greco. It's it's one of the oldest forms of combat period. There's been

43:13.040 --> 43:20.560
 cave drawings 15,000 years ago. Do you ever see the year you're one of the great coaches of all

43:20.560 --> 43:25.360
 time, you're now focused on a particular rule style right now. But do you ever see wrestling as

43:25.360 --> 43:33.040
 bigger than all of this, you know, as one of the pure combats? I do. And we're raising $20

43:33.040 --> 43:38.800
 million for a facility to make it the best facility on the planet. We have a vision to build the best

43:38.800 --> 43:46.480
 facility on planet Earth and put the best wrestlers in it. And that is bigger than wrestling. It's

43:46.480 --> 43:53.360
 for the University of Iowa. And our donors are doing it for the University of Iowa. But it is

43:53.360 --> 44:01.520
 about the value of wrestling. To me, also, there is so much value to wrestling blind. Blind people

44:01.520 --> 44:06.480
 don't play football. They wrestle. Blind people don't play basketball. I mean, maybe they do.

44:07.200 --> 44:14.480
 But it'd be very difficult. They can wrestle. Wrestling is a field sport. Yeah, there's no

44:14.480 --> 44:20.240
 ball. There's nothing. It's just two guys or two girls. And that's it. That's right. And I mean,

44:20.240 --> 44:26.000
 I'm not going to say you can't because somebody will get ahold of this. And I'll get an email or

44:26.000 --> 44:31.040
 a letter that says, you said blind people can't play baseball and blah, blah. I'm just saying

44:31.040 --> 44:36.080
 that blind people can wrestle very effectively. I've wrestled with my eyes shut. I mean,

44:36.080 --> 44:42.960
 was honest about it too. And it was I was effective. So why was I able to be effective? Because

44:42.960 --> 44:50.720
 wrestling is a sport that you can overcome a lot. Your demons that you're overcoming,

44:51.440 --> 44:59.040
 they're not limited with whether I'm blind or not. The demons that are overcoming are inside you.

44:59.040 --> 45:04.480
 You have to overcome those demons from within. So what's the future of Iowa wrestling look like

45:04.480 --> 45:09.360
 with this facility and this momentum you have now and this great group of guys you have now?

45:09.360 --> 45:18.080
 We have a good young group of guys and there is a lot of buzz in the program and probably

45:18.080 --> 45:28.240
 hasn't been this much buzz for quite some time. And our job is to be relaxed and be focused and

45:28.240 --> 45:33.680
 not get caught up in the buzz. But we have to put it together. And we have a catalyst,

45:33.680 --> 45:39.200
 Spencer Lee, but he's going to have to get better. And we have some other catalysts as well

45:39.200 --> 45:47.280
 that are going to help us in the future. But they got to get better. And so all this stuff about

45:47.280 --> 45:54.560
 independence and accountability and being able to get better every day under duress

45:55.840 --> 46:01.280
 and not knowing that you're getting better, but you are. You know what I mean by that?

46:01.840 --> 46:06.720
 Like the great thing about Gable was wrestling for him was is you were getting better and you

46:06.720 --> 46:13.680
 didn't know you were getting better. Well, just like you said, grow from success. So you never

46:13.680 --> 46:19.840
 allow yourself to think that you're getting good. All of a sudden you do something in the practice

46:19.840 --> 46:23.120
 room that you've been working on and all of a sudden you hit it and it's like it was automatic.

46:23.680 --> 46:32.400
 And then that, you know, that multiply success. So if I may say so, you're a bit of a man of

46:32.400 --> 46:41.040
 the Bible. What's where do you go? What do you go to the Bible for your faith? Strength, love,

46:41.040 --> 46:44.480
 patience? Same things I talked about things that you can't control, you turn them over.

46:45.280 --> 46:50.160
 So the biggest thing for me is I got to turn over the things that I can't control, turn them over

46:50.960 --> 46:55.360
 to that power. And I'm going to be a lot better off. And that's the reason why I'm not in the

46:55.360 --> 47:04.240
 funny form. It's very competitive to me. Yeah, it's very serious that we know that these young

47:04.880 --> 47:09.360
 wrestlers come to school here to be the best that they could be and to accomplish goals

47:10.080 --> 47:16.000
 that like me, when I was young, they've set out to accomplish and they chose I would do that.

47:16.000 --> 47:27.840
 So we have to deliver. And because of that peace with God, you know, it's peer. It's a peer motivation

47:27.840 --> 47:38.080
 and it's a peer platform. It's not it's not doing this for my ego. We're not corrupt people. We're

47:38.080 --> 47:47.520
 not liars and cheaters. And so often that gets in the way of a decent person. Yeah, first and foremost,

47:47.520 --> 47:52.320
 you're a good person and God helps you be that. Yeah, and we're serious about wrestling.

47:55.920 --> 48:02.240
 So a couple more questions. What's the role of family in wrestling? You mentioned your wife

48:02.240 --> 48:10.160
 who I read turned you down when you asked her for a phone number, said it's in the phone book.

48:10.160 --> 48:16.800
 That's pretty smooth. Her story of that is that she didn't want me to have to remember the number.

48:17.920 --> 48:23.040
 And I say at this point, and I say there's no way and I remember it very clearly,

48:23.040 --> 48:26.240
 like it's in the phone book and I was like, okay, she's following me off. That's okay.

48:26.240 --> 48:33.520
 But luckily, anyway, here's the thing with family. I mean, we have great people in our program. We

48:33.520 --> 48:41.040
 have great parents. We have a culture of parents that that's part of the buzz. And this class that

48:41.040 --> 48:47.120
 you see wrestling right now that's been here a year now, Lee, Miran, Costello, Warner, and then

48:47.120 --> 48:53.120
 Lugo was a transfer. And I'm forgetting somebody. I don't want to forget anybody, but these parents

48:53.120 --> 48:59.760
 are phenomenal. And that's a different parental culture. So the camera's dad is the same. And

49:01.280 --> 49:06.800
 so there's a lot of good there. And that's a big, that's a big, a big move because

49:06.800 --> 49:12.240
 how we talk to parents, we don't talk to parents to get along with them. We talk to parents to

49:12.240 --> 49:18.320
 help them understand, you know, where we're at with their sons. And when you can have a direct

49:18.320 --> 49:25.120
 conversation with a parent who is helping his son or her son, the mom, helping her son to be

49:25.120 --> 49:30.800
 accountable and to own it, then you can get a lot accomplished. And that's what we've been able to do.

49:30.800 --> 49:36.080
 And so you're solving problems like I talked about earlier. That's part of the family. The other part

49:36.080 --> 49:42.240
 of the family is the coaches are like family. The other part of the family is the coaches,

49:42.240 --> 49:48.640
 the coaches, significant others and wives are part of the family. And we fed, you know, we fed

49:48.640 --> 49:56.320
 40 guys and an entire coaching staff and wives and their children here at Thanksgiving. And that

49:56.320 --> 50:06.160
 equals 70 people. And it's, it's fun. It's fun. So family means administration. Gary Bartow,

50:06.160 --> 50:12.400
 my, my athletic director gives us everything that we need to be successful. And he has an open mind

50:12.400 --> 50:16.800
 for, for the sport of wrestling and wrestling is important in Iowa. So that's a no brainer. But

50:17.680 --> 50:23.280
 not if you're not a wrestling guy, but he sees we do it the right way. And so the commitment

50:23.280 --> 50:28.240
 is there from him. If we were doofuses, you know, he, the commitment wouldn't be there.

50:29.200 --> 50:33.280
 So family is, everybody's all in. I mean, it's from the rest of us to the family.

50:33.280 --> 50:38.160
 It goes back to what I said earlier about our people, our people are great. Ryan Morty Star is

50:38.160 --> 50:44.240
 great. Bobby Telford is great. Bobby Telford took over for a guy named Ben Burhaugh, who is great.

50:45.440 --> 50:52.320
 Our medical team is great. Dr. Westerman, Dr. Wolf, Jesse Donaworth, our athletic trainer is great.

50:54.640 --> 51:00.640
 Terry Brands is great. Mariah Stickley and Elise Owens are managers are great. My daughter's a

51:00.640 --> 51:06.800
 manager as well. It's great. They're, they're hardworking young women. Our, our Hawkeye Wrestling

51:06.800 --> 51:14.560
 Club is, is where it needs to be in terms of how they help in their role. And now we have four

51:14.560 --> 51:22.400
 women in there. And that's great. And, you know, at least one of their dads is super involved with

51:22.400 --> 51:30.960
 us. But, um, and so it's, one thing that I've learned is that you have to have that. And if you don't

51:30.960 --> 51:36.800
 have that, then you have to address it quickly. And those outliers, you know, let's solve that

51:36.800 --> 51:41.040
 problem. Let's get it out in the open here. And if they're, you know, if it doesn't work out,

51:41.040 --> 51:46.400
 it's not going to work out. That's a heck of a Thanksgiving dinner. Yeah. Next year. Well,

51:46.400 --> 51:51.120
 I don't know if it'd be legal, but I'd have to check with our compliance and, you know,

51:51.120 --> 51:56.800
 they'd have to vet you. You could come, you can come and see what it's all about. This room is full.

51:58.880 --> 52:04.640
 Oh man. Well, yeah, I'll be back next year then. All right. Awesome. Last question. In 2014, I watched

52:04.640 --> 52:14.480
 this video four years ago, uh, of you competing in, I believe your first swim meet against your

52:14.480 --> 52:22.480
 brother Terry, uh, and you came out victorious. Not really. Okay. So let's, I won the rate. Did you

52:22.480 --> 52:29.520
 cheat? Here's what happened. I researched this thing because I'm, that's how I am. You practiced.

52:29.520 --> 52:35.920
 No, I didn't, but I researched it in swimming. If you flinch on that starter block, it's a full

52:35.920 --> 52:41.040
 start. You can't twitch a finger and because they would be doing that to get their buddy to move

52:41.040 --> 52:47.280
 or the guy next to them, you know, so you have to be rock solid. Well, when we went, Terry was

52:47.280 --> 52:53.120
 leaning forward as the gun was going off. So he's moving. And so I was like, no, no, no,

52:53.120 --> 52:56.960
 false start. No, no, no, no. And he couldn't hear me. He was already in the water. And so he took

52:56.960 --> 53:01.600
 off like a bat out of, you know, where for the end of the pool and couldn't hear me and got to

53:01.600 --> 53:06.800
 the end of the pool. And it was a down and back. Well, that's a hard thing to do with a guy with

53:06.800 --> 53:12.160
 no body fat. And so he burned a lot of energy and he come up on that end of the pool and he was

53:12.160 --> 53:16.560
 like, where's, where's he at? Cause he didn't see me. And so we stopped him and then he came back

53:16.560 --> 53:23.360
 and then we went another one and I beat him. But it's the only time that, you know, I would say

53:23.360 --> 53:28.720
 that he was tuckered out and that's the reason why. And I'll also say this, we did a time

53:28.720 --> 53:37.760
 where we timed my race, the one I won. And then we timed his first down to the wall.

53:38.480 --> 53:43.520
 And then we timed his, the actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the way back

53:43.520 --> 53:49.440
 and he'd beat me. Now, how's that for being honest? That's pretty honest. That's pretty honest.

53:49.440 --> 53:54.720
 Accountable. Wow. Person. And I'm going to tell you something else, getting in those shorts,

53:54.720 --> 54:01.360
 those swim trunks as impressive. They are tight. Yeah. So is there outside of wrestling,

54:01.360 --> 54:07.280
 is there a thing that Terry got the better of you? I mean, I guess this could count as one

54:08.160 --> 54:11.280
 that you're still really bitter about that you need to avenge?

54:12.240 --> 54:17.760
 I mean, that's past. I mean, we, he's got an UNO title. We have UNO world championships. He's

54:17.760 --> 54:23.440
 got an UNO title I have, I have yet to have one. Morningstar has two titles. That's unprecedented.

54:23.440 --> 54:28.320
 So there's only four trophies out there and Terry's got one of those and I don't have one yet.

54:28.320 --> 54:34.000
 Yeah. Well, it's still time. Tom, thank you so much for letting a Russian with a tie into your home.

54:34.960 --> 54:38.960
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tom Brands. To support this podcast,

54:43.520 --> 54:51.600
 Marcus Aurelius. The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing. Thank you for listening

54:51.600 --> 55:01.600
 and hope to see you next time.
