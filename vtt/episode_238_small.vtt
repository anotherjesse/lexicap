00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
 The following is a conversation with Francis Collins, director of the NIH,

00:04.560 --> 00:10.160
 the National Institutes of Health, appointed and reappointed to the role by three presidents,

00:10.160 --> 00:17.920
 Obama, Trump, and Biden. He oversees 27 separate institutes and centers, including NIAID,

00:17.920 --> 00:24.800
 which makes him Anthony Fauci's boss. At the NIH, Francis helped launch and led a huge number of

00:24.800 --> 00:31.280
 projects that pushed the frontiers of science, health, and medicine, including one of my favorites,

00:31.280 --> 00:36.560
 the Brain Initiative, that seeks to map the human brain and understand how the function

00:36.560 --> 00:43.040
 arises from the neural circuitry. Before the NIH, Francis led the Human Genome Project,

00:43.040 --> 00:48.960
 one of the largest and most ambitious efforts in the history of science. Given all that,

00:48.960 --> 00:55.280
 Francis is a humble, thoughtful, kind man, and because of this, to me, he is one of the best

00:55.280 --> 01:01.760
 representatives of science in the world. He is a man of God and yet also a friend of the late

01:01.760 --> 01:08.720
 Christopher Hitchens, who called him, quote, one of the greatest living Americans. This is

01:08.720 --> 01:13.440
 a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:13.440 --> 01:20.480
 And now here's my conversation with Francis Collins. Science at its best is a source of hope.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.080
 So for me, it's been difficult to watch as it has during the pandemic become a

01:26.080 --> 01:30.000
 time's a source of division. What I would love to do in this conversation with you

01:30.880 --> 01:36.640
 is touch some difficult topics and do so with empathy and humility so that we may begin to

01:36.640 --> 01:41.200
 regain a sense of trust and science and that it may once again become a source of hope.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.920
 I hope that's okay with you. I love the goal.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.760
 Let's start with some hard questions. You called for, quote, thorough,

01:49.760 --> 01:54.880
 expert driven and objective inquiry into the origins of COVID 19. So let me ask,

01:55.440 --> 01:58.880
 is there a reasonable chance that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?

02:00.080 --> 02:06.160
 I can't exclude that. I think it's fairly unlikely. I wish we had more ability to be

02:06.160 --> 02:11.920
 able to ask questions of the Chinese government and learn more about what kind of records might

02:11.920 --> 02:18.720
 have been in the lab that we've never been able to see. But most likely this was a natural origin

02:18.720 --> 02:23.440
 of a virus probably starting in a bat, perhaps traveling through some other intermediate yet

02:23.440 --> 02:28.800
 to be identified host and finding its way into humans. Is answering this question within the

02:28.800 --> 02:34.400
 realm of science, do you think will we ever know? I think we might know if we find that intermediate

02:34.400 --> 02:40.320
 host. And there has not yet been a thorough enough investigation to say that that's not

02:40.320 --> 02:47.040
 going to happen. And remember, it takes a while to do this. With SARS, it was 14 years before we

02:47.040 --> 02:51.760
 figured out it was the civet cat that was the intermediate host. With MERS, it was a little

02:51.760 --> 02:57.440
 quicker to discover it was the camel. With SARS COVID 2, there's been some looking, but especially

02:57.440 --> 03:02.800
 now with everything really tense between the US and China, if there's looking going on, we're not

03:02.800 --> 03:08.080
 getting told about it. Do you think it's a scientific question or a political question?

03:08.080 --> 03:14.400
 It's a scientific question, but it has political implications. So the world is full of scientists

03:14.400 --> 03:19.840
 that are working together, but in the political space, in the political science space, there's

03:19.840 --> 03:26.800
 tensions. What is it like to do great science in a time of a pandemic when there's political

03:26.800 --> 03:34.960
 tensions? It's very unfortunate. Pasteur said science knows no one country. He was right about

03:34.960 --> 03:42.240
 that. My whole career in genetics, especially, has depended upon international collaboration

03:42.240 --> 03:47.600
 between scientists as a way to make discoveries, get things done. Scientists by their nature

03:48.560 --> 03:54.000
 like to be involved in international collaborations. The Human Genome Project, for

03:54.000 --> 03:59.680
 heaven's sake, 2400 scientists in six countries working together, not worrying who is going to

03:59.680 --> 04:04.080
 get the credit, giving all the data away. I was the person who was supposed to keep all that

04:04.080 --> 04:09.520
 coordinated. It was a wonderful experience. And that included China. That was sort of their first

04:09.520 --> 04:15.600
 real entry into a big international, big science kind of project, and they did their part.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.280
 It's very different now. Continue on the line of difficult questions.

04:21.280 --> 04:30.720
 Especially difficult ethical questions. In 2014, US put a hold on gain of function research in

04:30.720 --> 04:36.320
 response to a number of laboratory by security incidents, including anthrax, smallpox, and influenza.

04:36.880 --> 04:44.000
 In December 2017, NIH lifted this ban because, quote, gain of function research is important

04:44.000 --> 04:49.360
 in helping us identify, understand, and develop strategies and effective countermeasures against

04:49.360 --> 04:55.920
 rapidly evolving pathogens that pose a threat to public health. All difficult questions have

04:55.920 --> 05:02.160
 arguments on both sides. Can you argue the pros and cons of gain of function research with viruses?

05:03.280 --> 05:10.960
 I can. And first, let me say this term, gain of function, is causing such confusion

05:10.960 --> 05:16.560
 that I need to take a minute and just sort of talk about what the common scientific use of

05:16.560 --> 05:22.560
 that term is and where it is very different when we're talking about the current oversight

05:22.560 --> 05:29.360
 of potentially dangerous human pathogens. As you know, in science, we're doing gain of function

05:29.360 --> 05:36.880
 experiments all the time. We support a lot of cancer immunotherapy at NIH right here in our

05:36.880 --> 05:42.160
 clinical center. There are trials going on where people's immune cells are taken out of their body,

05:42.160 --> 05:47.680
 treated with a genetic therapy that revs up their ability to discover the cancer that that

05:47.680 --> 05:53.760
 patient currently has, maybe even at stage four, and then give them back as those little ninja

05:53.760 --> 06:00.160
 warriors go after the cancer. And it sometimes works dramatically. That's a gain of function.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.920
 You gave that patient a gain in their immune function that may have saved their life.

06:04.480 --> 06:10.720
 So got to be careful not to say, oh, gain of function is bad. Most of what we do in science

06:10.720 --> 06:16.080
 that's good involves quite a bit of the hat. And we are all living with gains of function every

06:16.080 --> 06:20.720
 day. I have a gain of function because I'm wearing these eyeglasses. Otherwise, I would not be seeing

06:20.720 --> 06:27.680
 you as clearly I'm happy for that gain of function. So that's where a lot of confusion has happened.

06:27.680 --> 06:34.720
 The kind of gain of function which is now subject to very rigorous and very carefully defined oversight

06:34.720 --> 06:40.720
 is when you are working with an established human pathogen that is known to be potentially causing

06:40.720 --> 06:48.480
 a pandemic and you are enhancing or potentially enhancing its transmissibility or its virulence.

06:49.280 --> 07:00.320
 We call that EPP enhanced potential pandemic pathogen. That requires this very stringent oversight

07:00.320 --> 07:07.280
 worked out over three years by the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.880
 That needs to be looked at by a panel that goes well beyond NIH to decide are the benefits worth

07:14.880 --> 07:23.120
 the risks in that situation. Most of the time, it's not worth the risk. Only three times in the

07:23.120 --> 07:28.640
 last three or four years have experiments been given permission to go forward. They were all

07:28.640 --> 07:36.080
 in influenza. So I will argue that if you're worried about the next pandemic, the more you

07:36.080 --> 07:41.200
 know about the coming enemy, the better chance you have to recognize when trouble is starting.

07:41.840 --> 07:48.720
 And so if you can do it safely, studying influenza or coronaviruses like SARS, MERS,

07:48.720 --> 07:54.720
 and SARS CoV2 would be a good thing to be able to know about. But you have to be able to do it

07:54.720 --> 08:01.280
 safely because we all know lab accidents can happen. I mean, look at SARS where there have been

08:01.280 --> 08:06.880
 lab accidents and people who have gotten sick as a result. We don't want to take that chance unless

08:06.880 --> 08:12.400
 there's a compelling scientific reason. That's why we have this very stringent oversight.

08:13.280 --> 08:20.960
 The experiments being done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a subaward to our grant to EcoHealth

08:20.960 --> 08:27.360
 in New York did not meet that standard of requiring that kind of stringent oversight.

08:27.360 --> 08:31.440
 I want to be really clear about that because there's been so much thrown around about it.

08:32.160 --> 08:37.600
 Was it gain of function? Well, in the standard use of that term that you would use in science in

08:37.600 --> 08:43.840
 general, you might say it was. But in the use of that term that applies to this very specific

08:43.840 --> 08:52.080
 example of a potential pandemic pathogen, absolutely not. So nothing went on there

08:52.080 --> 08:58.480
 that should not have happened based upon the oversight. There was an instance where the

08:58.480 --> 09:03.520
 grantee institution failed to notify us about the result of an experiment that they were supposed

09:03.520 --> 09:10.800
 to tell us where they mixed and matched some viral genomes and got a somewhat larger viral

09:10.800 --> 09:17.760
 load as a result. But it was not EPPP. It was not getting into that zone that would have required

09:17.760 --> 09:22.560
 this higher level of scrutiny. It was all bat viruses. These were not human pathogens.

09:23.680 --> 09:29.120
 So they didn't cross a threshold within that gray area that makes for an EPPP?

09:29.120 --> 09:34.960
 They did not. Anybody who's willing to take the time to look at what EPPP means and what

09:34.960 --> 09:39.040
 those experiments were would have to agree with what I just said.

09:39.040 --> 09:44.000
 What is the biggest reason it didn't cross that threshold? Is it because it wasn't jumping to

09:44.000 --> 09:49.920
 humans? Is it because it did not have a sufficient increase in virulence or transmissibility?

09:49.920 --> 09:59.920
 What's your sense? EPPP only applies to agents that are known human pathogens of pandemic potential.

10:00.720 --> 10:06.640
 These were all bat viruses derived in the wild, not shown to be infectious to humans.

10:06.640 --> 10:11.840
 Just looking at what happened if you took four different bat viruses and you tried moving the

10:11.840 --> 10:17.120
 spike protein gene from one into one of the others to see whether it would bind better

10:17.120 --> 10:22.320
 to the ACE2 receptor, that doesn't get across that threshold. And let me also say,

10:22.320 --> 10:27.280
 for those who are trying to connect the dots here, which is the most troubling part of this,

10:27.280 --> 10:33.920
 and say, well, this is how SARS CoV2 got started, that is absolutely demonstrably false.

10:33.920 --> 10:40.720
 These bat viruses that were being studied had only about 80% similarity in their genomes to

10:40.720 --> 10:46.880
 SARS CoV2. They were like decades away in evolutionary terms, and it is really irresponsible

10:46.880 --> 10:53.120
 for people to claim otherwise. Speaking of people who claim otherwise,

10:53.920 --> 11:01.280
 Rand Paul, what do you make of the battle of wars between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci

11:01.280 --> 11:07.600
 over this particular point? I don't want to talk about specific members of Congress, but I will

11:07.600 --> 11:14.000
 say it's really unfortunate that Tony Fauci, who is the epitome of a dedicated public servant,

11:14.720 --> 11:22.080
 has now somehow been targeted for political reasons as somebody that certain figures are

11:22.080 --> 11:27.360
 trying to discredit, perhaps to try to distract from their own failings. This never should have

11:27.360 --> 11:34.000
 happened. Here is a person who's dedicated his whole life to trying to prevent illnesses from

11:34.000 --> 11:42.400
 infectious diseases, including HIV in the 1980s and 90s, and now probably the most knowledgeable

11:42.400 --> 11:48.880
 infectious disease physician in the world, and also a really good communicator, is out there

11:48.880 --> 11:54.480
 telling the truth about where we are with SARS CoV2 to certain political figures who don't want

11:54.480 --> 12:00.320
 to hear it and who are therefore determined to discredit him, and that is disgraceful.

12:00.320 --> 12:09.120
 So with politicians, they often play games with black and white. They try to use the gray areas

12:09.120 --> 12:14.960
 of science and then paint their own picture, but I have a question about the gray areas of science.

12:14.960 --> 12:20.560
 So like you mentioned, gain of function is a term that has very specific scientific meaning,

12:20.560 --> 12:27.200
 but it also has a more general term, and it's very possible to argue that the, not to argue,

12:27.200 --> 12:31.040
 not the way politicians argue, but just as human beings and scientists,

12:31.040 --> 12:36.880
 that there was a gain of function achieved at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

12:37.920 --> 12:44.400
 but it didn't cross a threshold. I mean, it could have, too. So here's the thing,

12:44.400 --> 12:51.520
 when you do these kinds of experiments, unexpected results may be achieved, and that's the gray area

12:51.520 --> 12:58.400
 of science. You're taking risks with such experiments, and I am very uncomfortable

12:58.400 --> 13:02.640
 that we can't discuss the uncertainty in the gray area of this.

13:03.440 --> 13:08.800
 Oh, I'm comfortable discussing the gray area. What I'm uncomfortable with is people deciding to

13:08.800 --> 13:14.880
 define for themselves what that threshold is based on sort of some political argument. The

13:14.880 --> 13:22.400
 threshold was very explicitly laid out. Everybody agreed to that in the basis of this three years

13:22.400 --> 13:28.160
 of deliberation. So that's what it is. If that threshold needs to be reconsidered, let's reconsider

13:28.160 --> 13:33.760
 it, but let's not try to take an experiment that's already been done and decide that the threshold

13:33.760 --> 13:38.720
 isn't what it was, because that really is doing a disservice to the whole process.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.280
 I wish there was a discussion, even in response to

13:42.160 --> 13:47.040
 Rand Paul. I know we're not talking about specific senators, but just that particular case. I'm

13:47.040 --> 13:52.560
 saying stuff here. I wish there was an opportunity to talk about, given the current threshold,

13:52.560 --> 13:57.440
 this is not gain of function, but maybe we need to reconsider the threshold and have an actual,

13:57.440 --> 14:01.760
 that's an opportunity for discussion about the ethics of gain of function. You said

14:01.760 --> 14:06.320
 that there was three studies that passed that threshold with influenza. That's a fascinating

14:06.320 --> 14:13.040
 human question, scientific question about ethics, because like you said, there's pros and cons.

14:13.760 --> 14:20.720
 You're taking risks here to prevent horribly destructive viruses in the future,

14:21.520 --> 14:28.400
 but you also are risking creating such viruses in the future. With nuclear weapons and nuclear

14:28.400 --> 14:36.560
 energy, nuclear energy promises a lot of positive effects, and yet you're taking risks here.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.680
 Mutually shared destruction of nations possessing nuclear weapons.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.160
 Oh my.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.880
 I hope we're not going there.

14:44.880 --> 14:49.840
 Well, we're not, but a lot of people argue that that's the reason we've, nuclear weapons is the

14:49.840 --> 14:56.480
 reason we've prevented world wars, and yet they also have the risk of starting world wars,

14:56.480 --> 15:02.160
 and this is what we have to be honest about with the benefits and risks of science, that you have

15:02.160 --> 15:06.000
 to make that calculation of what are the pros and what are the cons.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.440
 I'm totally with you, but I want to reassure you, Lex, that this is not an issue that's been ignored.

15:12.480 --> 15:18.240
 That this issue about the kind of gain of function that might result in a serious human pathogen

15:18.240 --> 15:24.160
 has been front and center in many deliberations for a decade or more, involved a lot of my time

15:24.160 --> 15:30.800
 along the way, by the way, and has been discussed publicly on multiple occasions, including two

15:30.800 --> 15:35.680
 major meetings of the National Academy of Sciences getting input from everybody,

15:35.680 --> 15:38.400
 and ultimately arriving at our current framework.

15:38.400 --> 15:45.920
 Now, we actually back in January of 2020, just before COVID 19 changed everything,

15:45.920 --> 15:54.240
 had planned and even charged that same national science advisory by board on biosecurity to

15:54.240 --> 15:59.040
 reconvene and look at the current framework and say, do we have it right? Let's look at the

15:59.040 --> 16:04.160
 experience over those three years and say, is the threshold too easy, too hard?

16:05.040 --> 16:09.440
 Do we need to reconsider it? Let's look at the experience. COVID came along, the members of

16:09.440 --> 16:13.200
 the board said, please, we're all infectious disease experts. We don't have time for this

16:13.200 --> 16:18.240
 right now, but I think the time is right to do this. I'm totally supportive of that, and that

16:18.240 --> 16:23.040
 should be just as public a discussion as you can imagine about what are the benefits and the risks.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.840
 And if somebody decided, ultimately, this came together and said, we just shouldn't be doing

16:27.840 --> 16:31.920
 these experiments under any circumstances. If that was the conclusion, well, that would be the

16:31.920 --> 16:38.640
 conclusion, but it hasn't been so far. If we can briefly look out into the next 100 years on this,

16:38.640 --> 16:49.440
 I apologize for the existential questions. But it seems obvious to me that as gain of function

16:49.440 --> 16:57.120
 type of research and development becomes easier and cheaper, it will become greater and greater

16:57.120 --> 17:04.560
 risk. So if it doesn't no longer need to be contained within the laboratories of high security,

17:04.560 --> 17:10.160
 it feels like this is one of the greatest threats facing human civilization. Do you worry that at

17:10.160 --> 17:16.320
 some point in the future, a leaked manmade virus may destroy most of human civilization?

17:17.200 --> 17:23.600
 I do worry about the risks. And at the moment where we have the greatest control, the greatest

17:23.600 --> 17:29.840
 oversight is when this is federally funded research. But as you're alluding, there's no reason to

17:29.840 --> 17:36.560
 imagine that's the only place that this kind of activity would go on. If there was an evil source

17:36.560 --> 17:43.280
 that wished to create a virus that was highly pathogenic in their garage, the technology does

17:43.280 --> 17:50.400
 get easier. And there is no international oversight about this either that you could say has the same

17:50.400 --> 17:58.640
 stringency as what we have in the United States. So yes, that is a concern. It would take a serious

17:58.640 --> 18:06.080
 a seriously deranged group or person to undertake this on purpose, given the likelihood that they

18:06.080 --> 18:13.920
 too would go down. We don't imagine there are going to be bio weapons that only kill your enemies

18:13.920 --> 18:21.760
 and don't kill you. Sorry, we're too much alike for that to work. So I don't see it as an imminent

18:21.760 --> 18:28.240
 risk. There's lots of scary novels and movies written about it. But I do think it's something

18:28.240 --> 18:33.680
 we have to consider what are all the things that ought to be watched. You may not know that if

18:33.680 --> 18:41.840
 somebody is ordering a particular oligonucleotide from one of the main suppliers, and it happens to

18:41.840 --> 18:49.680
 match smallpox, they're going to get caught. So there is effort underway to try to track any

18:49.680 --> 18:53.760
 nefarious actions that might be going on in the United States or internationally. Is there an

18:53.760 --> 18:59.280
 international collaboration of try to track this stuff? There is some. I wish it were stronger.

19:00.320 --> 19:05.840
 This is a general issue, Lex, in terms of do we have a mechanism, particularly when it comes to

19:05.840 --> 19:11.360
 ethical issues, to be able to decide what's allowable and what's not and enforce it. I mean,

19:11.360 --> 19:16.800
 look where we are with germline genome editing for humans, for instance, there is no enforcement

19:16.800 --> 19:21.120
 mechanism. There's just bully pulpits and governments that get to decide for themselves.

19:21.120 --> 19:26.800
 So you talked about evil. What about incompetence? Does that worry you? I was born in the Soviet Union.

19:27.920 --> 19:35.200
 My dad, a physicist, worked at Chernobyl. That comes to mind. That wasn't evil. I don't know

19:35.200 --> 19:40.080
 what word you want to put it. Maybe incompetence is too harsh. Maybe it's the inherent incompetence

19:40.080 --> 19:45.040
 of bureaucracy. I don't know. But for whatever reason, there was an accident. Does that worry you?

19:45.040 --> 19:50.800
 Of course it does. We know that SARS, for instance, did manage to leak out of a lab

19:50.800 --> 19:57.200
 in China two or three times, and at least in some instances people died, fortunately quickly contained.

19:58.560 --> 20:04.400
 All one can do in that circumstance, because you need to study the virus and understand it

20:04.400 --> 20:09.920
 in order to keep it from causing a broader pandemic. But you need to insist upon the kind

20:09.920 --> 20:16.080
 of biosecurity, the BSL 2, 3, and 4 framework under which those experiments have to be done.

20:16.080 --> 20:22.480
 And certainly at NIH, we're extremely rigorous about that. But you can't count on every human

20:22.480 --> 20:27.920
 being to always do exactly what they're supposed to. So there's a risk there, which is another

20:27.920 --> 20:33.680
 reason why if we're contemplating supporting research on pathogens that might be the next

20:33.680 --> 20:38.400
 pandemic, you have to factor that in, not just whether people are going to do something

20:39.120 --> 20:42.720
 that we couldn't have predicted, where all of a sudden they created a virus that's much worse

20:42.720 --> 20:48.160
 without knowing they were going to do that, but also just having an accident. That's in the mix

20:48.160 --> 20:51.600
 when those estimates are done about whether the risk is worth it or not.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.160
 Continuing on line of difficult questions.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.800
 We're going to get to fun stuff after a while.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.320
 We will soon, I promise.

21:04.400 --> 21:11.280
 You are the director of the NIH. You are Dr. Anthony Fauci's technically his boss.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.480
 Yep.

21:12.480 --> 21:17.760
 You have stood behind him. You have supported him, just like you did already in this conversation.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.720
 It is painful for me to see division and distrust,

21:21.920 --> 21:27.600
 but many people in politics and elsewhere have called for Anthony Fauci to be fired.

21:29.120 --> 21:33.120
 When there are such calls of distrust in public about a leader like Anthony Fauci,

21:33.120 --> 21:37.040
 who should garner trust, do you think he should be fired?

21:37.040 --> 21:47.840
 Absolutely not. To do so would be basically to give the opportunity for those who want

21:47.840 --> 21:55.040
 to make up stories about anybody to destroy them. There is nothing in the ways in which Tony Fauci

21:55.040 --> 22:04.560
 has been targeted that is based upon truth. How could we then accept those cries for his firing

22:04.560 --> 22:10.320
 as having legitimacy? It's a circular argument. They've decided they don't like Tony,

22:10.320 --> 22:15.760
 so they make up stuff and they twist comments that he's made about things like gain of function,

22:15.760 --> 22:21.360
 where he's referring to the very specific gain of function that's covered by this policy,

22:21.360 --> 22:25.360
 and they're trying to say he lied to the Congress. That's simply not true.

22:26.160 --> 22:31.840
 They don't like the fact that Tony changes the medical recommendations about what to do with

22:31.840 --> 22:37.200
 COVID 19 over the space of more than a year. They call that flip flopping and you can't

22:37.200 --> 22:41.280
 trust the guy because he says one thing last year and one thing this year. Well, the science has

22:41.280 --> 22:46.960
 changed. Delta variant has changed everything. You don't want him to be saying the same thing

22:46.960 --> 22:51.040
 he did a year ago. That would be wrong now. It was the best we could do then. People don't

22:51.040 --> 22:57.520
 understand that or else they don't want to understand that. When you basically whip up a

22:57.520 --> 23:03.680
 largely political argument against a scientist and hammer at it over and over again to the point

23:03.680 --> 23:08.720
 where he now has to have 24 seven security to protect him against people who really want to

23:08.720 --> 23:14.560
 do violence to him. For that to be a reason to say that then he should be fired is to hand

23:14.560 --> 23:17.920
 the evil forces the victory. I will not do that.

23:17.920 --> 23:25.120
 Yet there's something difficult that I'm going to try to express to you.

23:26.160 --> 23:33.440
 So it may be your guitar playing. It may be something else, but there's a humility to you.

23:33.440 --> 23:42.000
 It may be because you're a man of God. There's a humility to you that Garner's trust.

23:42.000 --> 23:50.720
 And when you're in a leadership position representing science, especially in catastrophic

23:50.720 --> 23:58.640
 events like the pandemic, it feels like as a leader, you have to go far above and beyond

23:59.200 --> 24:05.440
 your usual duties. And I think there's no question that Anthony Fauci has delivered

24:05.440 --> 24:11.440
 on his duties, but it feels like he needs to go above as a science communicator. And if there's

24:11.440 --> 24:20.640
 a large number of people that are distrusting him, it's also his responsibility to Garner their trust,

24:20.640 --> 24:28.000
 to gain their trust as a person who's the face of science. Are you torn on this?

24:28.000 --> 24:35.200
 The responsibility of Anthony Fauci of yourself to represent science, not just the communication

24:35.200 --> 24:42.320
 of advising what should be done, but giving people hope, giving people trust in science

24:42.960 --> 24:48.800
 and alleviating division. Do you think that's also a responsibility of a leader? Or is that unfair to

24:48.800 --> 24:55.360
 ask? I think the best way you give people trust is to tell them the truth. And so they recognize

24:55.360 --> 25:00.640
 that when you're sharing information, it's the best you've got at that point. And Tony Fauci does

25:00.640 --> 25:07.920
 that at every moment. I don't think him expressing more humility would change the fact that they're

25:07.920 --> 25:14.320
 looking for a target of somebody to blame, to basically distract people from the failings of

25:14.320 --> 25:21.680
 their own political party. Maybe I'm less targeted, not because of a difference in the way in which

25:21.680 --> 25:27.760
 I convey the information. I'm less visible. If Tony were out of the scene and I was placed in

25:27.760 --> 25:32.720
 that role, I'd probably be seeing a ratcheting up of that same targeting.

25:34.400 --> 25:42.800
 I would like to believe that if Tony Fauci said that when I originally made recommendations not

25:42.800 --> 25:51.200
 to wear masks, that was given on our best available data. And now we know that is a mistake. So admit

25:51.200 --> 25:59.120
 with humility that there's an error. That's not actually correct. But that's a statement of

25:59.120 --> 26:05.920
 humility. And I would like to believe despite the attacks, he would win a lot of people over with

26:05.920 --> 26:13.200
 that. So a lot of people, as you're saying, would use that, see that here we go, here's that Dr.

26:13.200 --> 26:18.000
 Anthony Fauci making mistakes. How can we trust him on anything? I believe if he was

26:18.000 --> 26:27.920
 that public display of humility to say that I made an error, that would win a lot of people over.

26:27.920 --> 26:36.160
 That's kind of my sense. To face the fire of the attacks from politics, politicians will

26:36.160 --> 26:42.240
 attack no matter what. But the question is the people, to win over the people. The biggest

26:42.240 --> 26:51.120
 concern I've had is that there is this distrust of science that's been brewing. And maybe you

26:51.120 --> 26:56.640
 can correct me, but I'm a little bit unwilling to fully blame the politicians because politicians

26:56.640 --> 27:04.000
 play their games no matter what. It just feels like this was an opportunity to inspire people with

27:04.000 --> 27:08.720
 the power of science. The development of the vaccines, no matter what you think of those

27:08.720 --> 27:15.280
 vaccines, is one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of science. And the fact that

27:15.280 --> 27:21.040
 that's not inspiring, listen, I host a podcast. Whenever I say positive stuff about the vaccine,

27:21.040 --> 27:28.080
 I get to hear a lot of different opinions. I bet you do. The fact that I do is a big problem to

27:28.080 --> 27:36.320
 me because it's an incredible, an incredible accomplishment of science. And so I'm sorry,

27:36.320 --> 27:42.800
 but I have to put responsibility on the leaders, even if it's not their mistakes. That's what the

27:42.800 --> 27:47.840
 leadership is. That's what leadership is. You take responsibility for the situation. I wonder

27:47.840 --> 27:55.360
 if there's something that could have been done better to give people hope that science will

27:55.360 --> 28:04.240
 save us as opposed to science will divide us. I think you have more confidence in the ability

28:04.240 --> 28:11.200
 to get beyond our current divisions than I do after seeing just how deep and dark they have become.

28:11.920 --> 28:16.720
 Tony Fauci has said multiple times the recommendation about not wearing masks

28:17.520 --> 28:24.720
 was for two reasons, a shortage of masks which were needed in hospitals, and a lack of realization

28:24.720 --> 28:31.840
 early in the course of the epidemic that this was a virus that could heavily infect asymptomatic

28:31.840 --> 28:39.360
 people. Has that changed? He changed. Now, did he make an error? No, he was making a judgment

28:39.360 --> 28:44.480
 based on the data available at the time, but he certainly made that clear over and over again.

28:45.120 --> 28:50.080
 It has not stopped those who would like to demonize him from saying, well, he just flip flopped.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.480
 You can't trust a guy. He says one thing today and one thing tomorrow.

28:54.480 --> 29:03.120
 Well, masks is a tricky one. Early on, I'm a coauthor on a paper, one of many,

29:03.120 --> 29:10.160
 but this was a survey paper overlooking the evidence. It's a summary of the evidence we have

29:10.160 --> 29:17.360
 for the effectiveness of masks. It seems that it's difficult to do rigorous scientific study

29:17.360 --> 29:22.400
 on masks. It is difficult. There's a lot of philosophical and ethical questions I want to ask

29:22.400 --> 29:31.920
 you within this. It's back to your words and Anthony Fauci's words. When you're dealing with so much

29:31.920 --> 29:38.880
 uncertainty and so much potential uncertainty about how catastrophic this virus is in the early days

29:40.480 --> 29:48.160
 and knowing that each word you say may create panic, how do you communicate science with the world?

29:48.160 --> 29:56.400
 It's a philosophical. It's an ethical. It's a practical question. There was a discussion

29:56.400 --> 30:08.000
 about masks a century ago and that too led to panic. I'm trying to put myself in your mind

30:08.000 --> 30:12.160
 and the mind of Anthony Fauci in those early days knowing that there's limited supply of masks.

30:12.160 --> 30:19.120
 Nick, what do you say? Do you fully convey the uncertainty of the situation of the

30:20.160 --> 30:24.480
 challenges of the supply chain or do you say that masks don't work?

30:26.560 --> 30:30.960
 That's a complicated calculation. How do you make that calculation?

30:32.400 --> 30:41.040
 It is a complicated calculation. As a scientist, your temptation would be to give a full brain

30:41.040 --> 30:45.840
 dump of all the details of the information about what's known and what isn't known and

30:45.840 --> 30:51.440
 what experiments need to be done. Most of the time, that's not going to play well in a sound

30:51.440 --> 30:56.880
 bite on the evening news. You have to distill it down to a recommendation that is the best you can

30:56.880 --> 31:05.120
 do at that time with the information you've got. You're a man of God. We'll return to that to talk

31:05.120 --> 31:12.240
 about some also unanswerable philosophical questions. But first, let's linger on the vaccine

31:13.040 --> 31:18.160
 because in the religious, in the Christian community, there was some hesitancy with the vaccine.

31:18.880 --> 31:26.000
 Still is? Still is. There's a lot of data showing high efficacy and safety of vaccines,

31:26.000 --> 31:32.560
 of COVID vaccines, but still they are far from perfect as all vaccines are. Can you empathize

31:32.560 --> 31:38.000
 with people who are hesitant to take the COVID vaccine or to have their children take the COVID

31:38.000 --> 31:44.640
 vaccine? I can totally empathize, especially when people are barraged by conflicting information

31:44.640 --> 31:50.560
 coming at them from all kinds of directions. I've spent a lot of my time in the last year

31:50.560 --> 31:56.720
 trying to figure out how to do a better job of listening because I think we have all

31:56.720 --> 32:05.760
 got the risk of assuming we know the basis for somebody's hesitancy and that often doesn't

32:05.760 --> 32:14.720
 turn out to be what you thought. The variety of reasons is quite broad. I think a big concern

32:14.720 --> 32:20.480
 is just this sense of uncertainty about whether this was done too fast and that corners were cut.

32:20.480 --> 32:28.080
 And there are good answers to that. Along with that, a sense that maybe this vaccine

32:28.080 --> 32:33.840
 will have long term effects that we won't know about for years to come. And one can say that

32:33.840 --> 32:38.000
 hasn't been seen with other vaccines. And there's no particular reason to think this one's going

32:38.000 --> 32:42.560
 to be different than the dozens of others that we have experience with. But you can't absolutely

32:42.560 --> 32:50.880
 say, no, there's no chance of that. So it does come down to listening and then trying in a

32:51.920 --> 32:58.080
 fashion that doesn't convey a message that you're smarter than the person you're talking to,

32:58.080 --> 33:03.520
 because that isn't going to help, to really address what the substance is of the concerns.

33:04.880 --> 33:11.280
 But my heart goes out to so many people who are fearful about this because of all the information

33:11.280 --> 33:17.520
 that has been dumped on them, some of it by politicians, a lot of it by the internet,

33:18.400 --> 33:27.440
 some of it by parts of the media that seem to take pleasure in stirring up this kind of fear

33:27.440 --> 33:35.040
 for their own reasons. And that is shameful. I'm really sympathetic with the people who are confused

33:35.040 --> 33:40.640
 and fearful. I am not sympathetic with people who are distributing information that's demonstrably

33:40.640 --> 33:50.080
 false and continue to do so. They're taking lives. I didn't realize how strong that sector of

33:50.080 --> 33:57.760
 disinformation would be. And it's been, in many ways, more effective than the means of spreading

33:57.760 --> 34:04.080
 the truth. This is going to take us into another place. But Lex, if there's something I'm really

34:04.080 --> 34:09.280
 worried about in this country, and it's not just this country, but it's the one I live in,

34:09.280 --> 34:16.240
 is that we have another epidemic besides COVID 19. And it's an epidemic of the loss

34:17.120 --> 34:25.040
 of the anchor of truth. The truth as a means of making decisions, truth as a means of figuring

34:25.040 --> 34:31.040
 out how to wrestle with a question like, should I get this vaccine for myself or my children,

34:31.040 --> 34:38.880
 seems to have lost its primacy. And instead, it's an opinion of somebody who

34:40.320 --> 34:46.320
 expressed it very strongly, or some Facebook post that I read two hours ago.

34:48.240 --> 34:56.720
 And for those to become substitutes for objective truth, not just, of course, for vaccines, but

34:56.720 --> 35:05.280
 for many other issues like, was the 2020 election actually fair? This worries me deeply. It's bad

35:05.280 --> 35:12.400
 enough to have polarization and divisions, but to have no way of resolving those by actually saying,

35:12.400 --> 35:18.560
 okay, what's true here, makes me very worried about the path we're on. And I'm usually an optimist.

35:18.560 --> 35:27.280
 Well, to give you an optimistic angle on this, I actually think that this sense that there's

35:27.280 --> 35:35.600
 no one place for truth is just a thing that will inspire leaders and science communicators to speak

35:35.600 --> 35:40.960
 not from a place of authority, but from a place of humility. I think it's just challenging people

35:40.960 --> 35:47.840
 to communicate in a new way, to be listeners first. I think the problem isn't that there's a

35:47.840 --> 36:01.840
 lot of misinformation. I think that the internet and the world are distrustful of people who

36:03.120 --> 36:10.000
 speak as if they possess the truth with an authoritarian tone, which was, I think, defining

36:10.000 --> 36:14.960
 for what science was in the 20th century. I just think it has to sound different in the 21st.

36:14.960 --> 36:24.720
 In the battle of ideas, I think humility and love wins. And that's how science wins,

36:24.720 --> 36:30.400
 not through having quote unquote truth. Because now everybody can just say, I have the truth.

36:31.760 --> 36:36.400
 I think you have to speak, like I said, from humility, not authority. And so it just challenges

36:36.400 --> 36:45.920
 our leaders to go back and learn to be, pardon my French, less assholes and more kind and,

36:45.920 --> 36:51.360
 like you said, to listen, to listen to the experiences of people that are good people,

36:51.360 --> 36:56.640
 not the ones who are trying to manipulate the system or play a game and so on, but real people

36:56.640 --> 37:03.040
 who are just afraid of uncertainty, of hurting those they loved and so on. So I think it's just

37:03.040 --> 37:07.120
 an opportunity for leaders to go back and take a class on effective communication.

37:09.120 --> 37:14.640
 I'm with you on shifting more from where we are to humility and love. That's got to be

37:14.640 --> 37:21.920
 the right answer. That's very biblical, by the way. We'll get there. I have to bring up Joe

37:21.920 --> 37:27.680
 Rogan. I don't know if you know who he is. I do. He's a podcast or comedian, fighting commentator,

37:27.680 --> 37:35.360
 and my now friend. And Ivermectin believer too. Yes, that is the question I have to ask you about.

37:36.880 --> 37:42.240
 He has gotten some flak in the mainstream media for not getting vaccinated. And when he got COVID

37:42.240 --> 37:48.480
 recently, taking Ivermectin as part of a cocktail of treatments, the NIH actually has a nice page

37:48.480 --> 37:55.920
 on Ivermectin saying, quote, there's insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against the

37:55.920 --> 38:02.480
 use of Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID 19. Results from adequately powered, well designed,

38:02.480 --> 38:07.600
 and well conducted clinical trials are needed to provide more specific evidence based guidance

38:07.600 --> 38:14.320
 on the role of Ivermectin in the treatment of COVID 19. So let me ask, why do you think there has

38:14.320 --> 38:20.560
 been so much attack on Joe Rogan and anyone else that's talking about Ivermectin when there's

38:20.560 --> 38:28.000
 insufficient evidence for or against? Well, let's unpack that. First of all, I think the concerns

38:28.000 --> 38:35.120
 about Joe are not limited to his taking Ivermectin much more seriously, his being fairly publicly

38:35.120 --> 38:43.120
 negative about vaccines at a time where people are dying. 700,000 people have died from COVID 19.

38:43.120 --> 38:49.760
 Estimates by Kaiser or at least 100,000 of those were unnecessary deaths of unvaccinated people.

38:49.760 --> 38:57.520
 And for Joe to promote that further, even as this pandemic rages through our population,

38:58.160 --> 39:04.480
 is simply irresponsible. So yeah, the Ivermectin is just one other twist. Obviously, Ivermectin

39:04.480 --> 39:10.640
 has been controversial for months and months. The reason that it got particular attention is

39:10.640 --> 39:16.240
 because of the way in which it seemed to have captured the imagination of a lot of people

39:16.240 --> 39:21.520
 and to the point where they were taking doses that were intended for livestock. And some of them

39:21.520 --> 39:26.400
 got pretty sick as a result from overdosing on this stuff. That was not good judgment.

39:28.480 --> 39:35.280
 The drug itself remains uncertain. There's a recent review that looks at all of the studies

39:35.280 --> 39:41.520
 of Ivermectin and basically concludes that it probably doesn't work. We are running a study

39:41.520 --> 39:47.840
 right now. I looked at that data this morning in a trial called Active Six, which is one of the

39:47.840 --> 39:53.760
 ones that my public private partnership is running. We're up to about 400 patients who've been randomized

39:53.760 --> 40:00.880
 to Ivermectin or placebo and should know perhaps as soon as a month from now in a very carefully

40:00.880 --> 40:06.960
 controlled trial. Did it help or did it not? So there will be an answer. Coming back to Joe,

40:06.960 --> 40:12.000
 again, I don't think the fact that he took Ivermectin and hoping it might work

40:12.800 --> 40:19.120
 is that big a knock against him. It's more the conveying of we don't trust what science says,

40:19.120 --> 40:22.720
 which is vaccines are going to save your life. We're going to trust what's on the internet

40:22.720 --> 40:26.720
 that says Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine really do work, even though the scientific

40:26.720 --> 40:33.280
 community says probably not. So let me push back on that a little bit. So he doesn't say

40:33.280 --> 40:44.000
 let's not listen to science. He doesn't say don't get vaccinated. He says it's okay to ask questions.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.560
 I'm okay with that. How risky is the vaccine for certain populations? What are the benefits

40:50.560 --> 40:58.240
 and risks? There's other friends of Joe and friends of mine like Sam Harris who says if you look at

40:58.240 --> 41:06.640
 the data, it's obvious that the benefits outweigh the risks. And what Joe says is yes, but let's

41:06.640 --> 41:12.960
 still openly talk about risks. And he often brings up anecdotal evidence of people who've had

41:14.320 --> 41:19.840
 highly negative effects from vaccines. Science is not done with anecdotal evidence.

41:21.200 --> 41:25.840
 And so you could infer a lot of stuff from the way he expresses it. But he also communicates a

41:25.840 --> 41:33.760
 lot of interesting questions. And that's something maybe you can comment on. There's certain groups

41:33.760 --> 41:42.560
 that are healthy. They're younger. They exercise a lot. They get nutrition and all those kinds

41:42.560 --> 41:50.240
 of things. He shows skepticism on whether it's so obvious that they should get vaccinated. And the

41:50.240 --> 42:01.280
 same as he kind of presents the same kind of skepticism for kids, for young kids. So with empathy

42:03.040 --> 42:11.200
 and listening my Russian inelicant description of what Joe believes, what is your kind of response

42:11.200 --> 42:17.360
 to that? Why should certain categories of healthy and young people still get vaccinated, do you

42:17.360 --> 42:22.480
 think? Well, first, just to say it's great for Joe to be a skeptic, to ask questions. We should all

42:22.480 --> 42:27.040
 be doing that. But then the next step is to go and see what the data says and see if there are

42:27.040 --> 42:33.360
 actually answers to those questions. So coming to Healthy People, I've done a bunch of podcasts

42:33.360 --> 42:41.360
 besides this one. The one I think I remember most was a podcast with a worldwide wrestling

42:41.360 --> 42:48.800
 superstar. Very nice. He's about six foot six and just absolutely solid muscle. And he got COVID

42:50.160 --> 42:58.240
 and he almost died. And recovering from that, he said, I've got to let my supporters know,

42:58.240 --> 43:02.240
 because you can imagine worldwide wrestling fans are probably not big

43:02.240 --> 43:12.160
 embracers of the need for vaccines. And he just turned himself into a spokesperson for the fact

43:12.160 --> 43:18.480
 that this virus doesn't care how healthy you are, how much you exercise, what a great specimen you

43:18.480 --> 43:26.640
 are. It wiped him out. And we see that. You know, the average person in the ICU right now with COVID

43:26.640 --> 43:32.720
 19 is under age 50. I think there's a lot of people still thinking, oh, it's just those old people in

43:32.720 --> 43:37.520
 the nursing homes. That's not going to be about me. They're wrong. And there are plenty of instances

43:37.520 --> 43:42.480
 of people who were totally healthy with no underlying diseases, taking good care of themselves,

43:42.480 --> 43:51.440
 not obese, exercising, who have died from this disease. 700 children have died from this disease.

43:51.440 --> 43:57.200
 Yes, some of them had underlying factors like obesity, but a lot of them did not. So it's fair

43:57.200 --> 44:05.600
 to say younger people are less susceptible to serious illness. Kids even less so than young

44:05.600 --> 44:13.280
 adults, but it ain't zero. And if the vaccine is really safe and really effective, then you

44:13.280 --> 44:19.120
 probably want everybody to take advantage of that. Even though some are dropping their risks more

44:19.120 --> 44:25.760
 than others, everybody's dropping their risks some. Are you worried about variants? So looking out

44:25.760 --> 44:32.720
 into the future, what's your vision for all the possible trajectories that this virus takes in

44:32.720 --> 44:40.400
 human society? I'm totally worried about the variants. Delta was such an impressive arrival

44:40.400 --> 44:47.520
 on the scene in all the wrong ways. I mean, it took over the world in the space of just a couple

44:47.520 --> 44:53.600
 months because of its extremely contagious ability. Viruses would be beautiful if they weren't

44:53.600 --> 44:58.960
 terrifying. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this whole story of viral evolution, scientifically, is just

44:58.960 --> 45:04.400
 amazingly elegant. Anybody who really wanted to understand how evolution works in real time,

45:04.960 --> 45:10.480
 study SARS CoV2, because it's not just Delta, it's Alpha, and it's Beta, and it's Gamma, and it's

45:10.480 --> 45:18.240
 Gamma, and it's the fact that these sweep through the world's population by fairly minor differences

45:18.240 --> 45:25.760
 in fitness. So the real question many people are wrestling is, is Delta it? Is it such a fit virus

45:25.760 --> 45:32.640
 that nothing else will be able to displace it? I don't know. I mean, there's now Delta AY4,

45:32.640 --> 45:42.160
 which is a variant of Delta that at least in the UK seems to be taking over the Delta population,

45:42.160 --> 45:48.160
 as though it's maybe even a little more contagious. That might be the first hint that we're seeing

45:48.160 --> 45:53.600
 something new here. It's not a completely different virus. It's still Delta, but it's Delta Plus.

45:53.600 --> 46:02.720
 You know, the big worry, blacks, is what's out there that is so different that the vaccine

46:02.720 --> 46:10.640
 protection doesn't work. And we don't know how different it needs to be for the vaccine to

46:10.640 --> 46:17.520
 stop working. That's the terrifying thing about each of these variants. It's always a pleasant

46:17.520 --> 46:22.640
 surprise that the vaccine seems to still have efficacy. And hooray for our immune system,

46:22.640 --> 46:28.640
 may I say, because the vaccine immunized you against that original Wuhan virus.

46:31.040 --> 46:37.360
 Now we can see that especially after two doses and even more so after a booster,

46:37.360 --> 46:44.160
 your immune system is so clever that it's also making a diversity of antibodies to cover some

46:44.160 --> 46:49.120
 other things that might happen to that virus to make it a little different. And you're still

46:49.120 --> 46:57.200
 getting really good coverage. Even for beta, which was South Africa B1351, which is the most

46:57.200 --> 47:03.200
 different, it looks pretty good. But that doesn't mean it will always be as good as that if something

47:03.200 --> 47:08.400
 gets really far away from the original virus. Now the good news is we would know what to do

47:08.400 --> 47:16.400
 in that situation. The mRNA vaccines allow you to redesign the vaccine like that and to quickly

47:16.400 --> 47:21.360
 get it through a few thousand participants in a clinical trial to be sure it's raising antibodies

47:21.360 --> 47:26.880
 and then bang, you could go. But I don't want to have to do that. There will be people's lives

47:26.880 --> 47:31.760
 at risk in the meantime. And what's the best way to keep that from happening? Well try to cut down

47:31.760 --> 47:36.480
 the number of infections because you don't get variants unless the virus is replicating in a

47:36.480 --> 47:44.400
 person. So how do we solve this thing? How do we get out of this pandemic? What's like if you had

47:44.400 --> 47:51.520
 like a wand or something? Or you could really implement policies. What's the full cocktail

47:51.520 --> 47:57.920
 of solutions here? It's a full cocktail. It's not just one thing. In our own country here in the US,

47:57.920 --> 48:02.800
 it would be getting those 64 million reluctant people to actually go ahead and get vaccinated.

48:02.800 --> 48:07.040
 There's 64 million people who didn't get vaccinated? Adults, yes. Not even counting the kids.

48:07.040 --> 48:14.480
 64 million. Isn't that astounding? Get the kids vaccinated. Hopefully their parents will see

48:14.480 --> 48:20.160
 that as a good thing too. Get those of us who are due for boosters boosted because that's going

48:20.160 --> 48:25.440
 to reduce our likelihood of having breakthrough infections and keep spreading it. Convince people

48:25.440 --> 48:30.640
 that until we're really done with this and we're not now, that social distancing and mask wearing

48:30.640 --> 48:37.840
 indoors are still critical to cut down the number of new infections. But of course, that's our country.

48:38.800 --> 48:45.360
 This is a worldwide pandemic. I worry greatly about the fact that low and middle income countries

48:45.360 --> 48:50.640
 have for the most part not even gotten started with access to vaccines and we have to figure out a

48:50.640 --> 48:57.280
 way to speed that up because otherwise that's where the next variant will probably arrive

48:57.280 --> 49:02.240
 and who knows how bad it will be and it will cross the world quickly as we've seen happen

49:02.240 --> 49:10.640
 repeatedly in the last 22 months. I think I'm really surprised, annoyed, frustrated that testing,

49:12.240 --> 49:17.760
 rapid at home testing from the very beginning wasn't a big, big part of the solution. It seems,

49:17.760 --> 49:23.440
 first of all, nobody's against it. That's one huge plus for testing that it's everybody supports.

49:23.440 --> 49:29.600
 Second of all, that's what America is good at, is mass manufacture of stuff,

49:30.640 --> 49:35.280
 stepping up, engineer stepping up and really deploying it. Plus, without the collection

49:35.280 --> 49:41.040
 of data, it's giving people freedom. It's giving them information and then freedom to decide what

49:41.040 --> 49:46.080
 to do with that information. It's such a powerful solution. I don't understand. Well, now, I think

49:46.080 --> 49:52.400
 the Biden administration has emphasized the scaling of testing manufacturers. But I just

49:52.400 --> 49:57.280
 feel like it's an obvious solution. Get a test that costs less than a dollar to manufacture,

49:57.280 --> 50:01.520
 costs less than a dollar to buy, and just everybody gets tested every single day.

50:02.400 --> 50:06.880
 Don't share that data with anyone. You just make the decisions. I believe in the intelligence

50:06.880 --> 50:11.040
 of people to make the right decision to stay at home when the test is positive.

50:11.040 --> 50:16.000
 I am so completely with you on that. NIH has been smack in the middle of trying to make that

50:16.000 --> 50:26.160
 dream come true. We're running a trial right now in Georgia, Indiana, Hawaii, and where's the other one?

50:27.200 --> 50:34.000
 Oh, Kentucky. Basically, blanketing a community with free testing. That was beautiful. And look

50:34.000 --> 50:39.200
 to see what happens as far as stemming the spread of the epidemic and measuring it by

50:39.200 --> 50:43.520
 wastewater because you can really tell whether you've cut back the amount of infection in the

50:43.520 --> 50:51.040
 community. Yeah, I'm so with you. We got off to such a bad start with testing. And of course,

50:51.040 --> 50:55.920
 all the testing was being done for the first several months in big box laboratories where

50:55.920 --> 51:00.560
 you had to send the sample off and put it through the mail somehow and get the result back sometimes

51:00.560 --> 51:05.600
 five days later after you've already infected a dozen people. It was just a completely wrong model,

51:05.600 --> 51:10.640
 but it's what we had. And everybody was like, oh, we got to stick with PCR because if you start

51:10.640 --> 51:15.920
 using those home tests that are based on antigens lateral flow, probably there's going to be false

51:15.920 --> 51:22.400
 positives and false negatives. Okay, sure. No test is perfect. But having a test that's not

51:22.400 --> 51:29.680
 acceptable or accessible is the worst setting. So we NIH with some requests from Congress got

51:29.680 --> 51:36.720
 a billion dollars to create this program called rapid acceleration of diagnostics, RADX. And

51:36.720 --> 51:41.520
 we turned into a venture capital organization and we invited every small business or academic lab

51:41.520 --> 51:46.560
 that had a cool idea about how to do home testing to bring it forward. And we threw them into what

51:46.560 --> 51:51.760
 we called our shark tank of business experts, engineers, technology people, people understood

51:52.400 --> 51:59.760
 how to deal with supply chains and manufacturing. And right now today, there are about two million

51:59.760 --> 52:05.680
 tests being done based on what came out of that program, including most of the home tests that

52:05.680 --> 52:10.160
 you can now buy on the pharmacy shelves. And we did that. And I wish we had done it faster,

52:10.160 --> 52:15.760
 but it was an amazingly speedy effort. And you're right, companies are really good. Once they've

52:15.760 --> 52:20.640
 gotten FDA emergency use authorization, and we helped a lot of them get that, they can scale

52:20.640 --> 52:28.880
 up their manufacturing. I think in December, we should have about 410 million tests for that

52:28.880 --> 52:35.040
 month ready to go. And if we can get one or two more platforms approved. And by the way, we are

52:35.040 --> 52:40.880
 now helping FDA by being their validation lab. If we can get a couple more of these approved,

52:40.880 --> 52:46.640
 we could be in the half a billion tests a month, which is really getting where we need to be.

52:46.640 --> 52:51.520
 Wow. Yeah, that's a dream. That's a dream for me. It seems like an obvious solution,

52:51.520 --> 52:57.440
 engineering solution. Everybody's behind it. It leads to hope versus division. I love it. Okay.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.400
 A happy story.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.360
 A happy story.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.560
 I was waiting for one.

53:02.560 --> 53:07.840
 Yeah. All right. Well, one last dive into the not happy, but you won't even have to comment

53:07.840 --> 53:16.320
 on it. Well, comment on the broader philosophical question. So NIH, again, I said Joe Rogan is

53:16.320 --> 53:21.680
 the first one who pointed me to this. NIH was recently accused of funding research of a paper

53:21.680 --> 53:26.720
 that had images of sedated puppies with their heads inserted into small enclosures containing

53:26.720 --> 53:35.680
 disease carrying sand flies. So I could just say that this story is not true, or at least the...

53:37.040 --> 53:43.120
 I think it is true that the paper that showed those images cited NIH as a funding source,

53:43.120 --> 53:44.880
 but that citation is not correct.

53:44.880 --> 53:45.840
 That was not correct.

53:45.840 --> 53:54.800
 Yeah. But that brings up a bigger philosophical question that could have been correct. How

53:54.800 --> 54:00.320
 difficult is it as a director of NIH or just NIH as an organization that's funding so many

54:00.320 --> 54:07.120
 amazing deep research studies to ensure the ethical fortitude of those studies

54:07.120 --> 54:13.120
 when the ethics of science is... There's such a great area between what is and what isn't ethical.

54:14.560 --> 54:18.960
 Well, tough issues. Certainly animal research is a tough issue.

54:18.960 --> 54:25.120
 I was going to bring up... It's a good example of that tough issue is in 2015,

54:25.680 --> 54:30.800
 you announced that NIH would no longer support any biomedical research involving chimpanzees.

54:31.760 --> 54:39.040
 So that's like one example of looking in the mirror, thinking deeply about what is and isn't

54:39.040 --> 54:44.240
 ethical, and there was a conclusion that biomedical research on chimps is not ethical.

54:44.240 --> 54:49.440
 Well, that was the conclusion. That was based on a lot of deep thinking and a lot of input from

54:50.000 --> 54:54.800
 people who have considered this issue and a panel of the National Academy of Sciences

54:54.800 --> 55:01.280
 that was asked to review the issue. I mean, the question that I wanted them to look at was,

55:01.280 --> 55:07.360
 are we actually learning anything that's really essential from chimpanzee invasive research

55:07.360 --> 55:15.040
 at this point? Or is it time to say that these closest relatives of ours should not be subjected

55:15.040 --> 55:20.400
 to that any further and ought to be retired to a sanctuary? And that was the conclusion that

55:20.400 --> 55:27.120
 there was really no kind of medical experimentation that needed to be done on chimps in order to

55:27.120 --> 55:32.640
 proceed. So why are we still doing this? Many of these were chimpanzees that were purchased

55:32.640 --> 55:38.720
 because we thought they would be good hosts for HIV AIDS, and they sort of weren't,

55:39.600 --> 55:44.480
 and they were kept around in these primate laboratories with people coming up with other

55:44.480 --> 55:49.280
 things to do, but they weren't compelling scientifically. So I think that was the right

55:49.280 --> 55:54.400
 decision. I took a lot of flack from some of the scientific communities, said, well, you're caving

55:54.400 --> 55:59.920
 in to the animal rights people. And now that you've said no more research on chimps, what's next?

55:59.920 --> 56:07.840
 Certainly when it comes to companion animals, everybody's heart starts to be hurting when

56:07.840 --> 56:13.920
 you see anything done that seems harmful to a dog or a cat. I have a cat. I don't have a dog.

56:13.920 --> 56:21.040
 And I understand that completely. That's why we have these oversight groups that decide before you

56:21.040 --> 56:28.000
 do any of that kind of research. Is it justified? And what kind of provision is going to be made

56:28.000 --> 56:35.040
 to avoid pain and suffering? And those are, those have input from the public as well as the scientific

56:35.040 --> 56:42.720
 community. Is that completely saying that every step that's happening there is ethical by some

56:45.200 --> 56:50.240
 standard that would be hard for anybody to agree to? No, but at least it's a consensus of what people

56:50.240 --> 56:59.520
 think is acceptable. Dogs are the only host for some diseases like Leishmaniasis, which was that

56:59.520 --> 57:04.400
 paper that we were not responsible for, but I know why they were doing the experiment, or like

57:04.400 --> 57:11.600
 lymphatic filariasis, which is an experiment that we are supporting in Georgia that involves dogs

57:11.600 --> 57:16.240
 getting infected with a parasite, because that's the only model we have to know whether a treatment

57:16.240 --> 57:24.160
 is going to work or not. So I will defend that. I am not in the place of those who think all animal

57:24.160 --> 57:29.440
 research is evil, because I think if there's something that's going to be done to save a child

57:29.440 --> 57:34.880
 from a terrible disease or an adult, and it involves animal research that's been carefully reviewed,

57:34.880 --> 57:39.920
 then I think ethically why it doesn't make me comfortable, it still seems like it's the right

57:39.920 --> 57:47.280
 choice. I think to say all animal research should be taken off the table is also very

57:47.280 --> 57:52.720
 unethical, because that means you have basically doomed a lot of people for whom that research

57:52.720 --> 57:59.520
 might have saved their lives to having no more hope. And to me personally, there's far greater

57:59.520 --> 58:04.400
 concerns ethically in terms of factory farming, for example, the treatment of animals in other

58:04.400 --> 58:10.480
 contexts. Oh, there's so much that goes on outside of medical research that is much more

58:10.480 --> 58:16.800
 troubling. That said, I think all cats have to go. That's just my off the record opinion.

58:16.800 --> 58:21.600
 That's why I'm not involved with any ethical decisions. I'm just joking internet. I love cats.

58:21.600 --> 58:26.000
 You're a dog person. I'm a dog person. I'm sorry. Have you seen the New Yorker cartoon where

58:26.000 --> 58:30.960
 there are two dogs in the bar having a martini and one is saying that they're dressed up in their

58:30.960 --> 58:37.440
 business suits and one says to the other, you know, it's not enough for the dogs to win. The cats

58:37.440 --> 58:46.160
 have to lose. It's beautiful. So a few weeks ago, you've announced that you're resigning from the

58:46.160 --> 58:52.160
 NIH at the end of the year. I'm stepping down. I'm still going to be at NIH at a different

58:52.160 --> 58:58.640
 capacity. At a different capacity rate. And it's over a decade of an incredible career overseeing

58:58.640 --> 59:06.320
 the NIH as its director. What are the things you're most proud of of the NIH in your time here as

59:06.320 --> 59:17.360
 its director? Maybe memorable moments. There's a lot in 12 years. Science has just progressed in

59:17.360 --> 59:25.520
 amazing ways over those 12 years. Think about where we are right now. Something like gene editing,

59:25.520 --> 59:31.120
 being able to make changes in DNA, even for therapeutic purposes, which is now curing sickle

59:31.120 --> 59:40.720
 cell disease. Unthinkable when I became director in 2009. The ability to study single cells and

59:40.720 --> 59:46.560
 ask them what they're doing and get an answer. Single cell biology just has emerged in this

59:46.560 --> 59:54.160
 incredibly powerful way. Having the courage to be able to say we could actually understand the

59:54.160 --> 1:00:00.560
 human brain seems like so far out there. And we're in the process of doing that with the brain

1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:08.000
 initiative. Taking all that we've learned about the genome and applying it to cancer, to make

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:14.080
 individual cancer treatment really precision. And developing cancer immunotherapy, which seemed

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:21.280
 like sort of a backwater into some of the hottest science around. All those things sort of erupting.

1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:26.640
 And much more to come, I'm sure. We're on an exponential curve of medical research advances,

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:33.600
 and that's glorious to watch. And of course, COVID 19 as a beneficiary of decades of basic

1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:39.680
 science, understanding what mRNA is, understanding basics about coronaviruses and spike proteins,

1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:45.200
 and how to combine structural biology and immunology and genomics into this package that

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:50.960
 allows you to make a vaccine in 11 months. Just, I would never have imagined that possible in

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:56.880
 2009. So to have been able to kind of be the midwife, helping all of those things get birthed,

1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:04.560
 that's been just an amazing 12 years. And as NIH director, you have this convening power

1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:09.840
 and this ability to look across the whole landscape of biomedical research and identify

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:15.840
 areas that are just like ready for something big to happen. But it isn't going to happen

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:20.400
 spontaneously without some encouragement, without pulling people together from different

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:24.400
 disciplines who don't know each other and maybe don't know how to quite understand each other's

1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:30.560
 scientific language and create an environment for that to happen. That has been just an amazing

1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:35.440
 experience. I mean, I mentioned the Brain Initiative as one of those. The Brain Initiative

1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:42.160
 right now, I think there was about 600 investigators working on this last week. The whole issue

1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:47.600
 of Nature Magazine was about the output of the Brain Initiative, basically now giving us a cell

1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:52.960
 census of what those cells in the brain are doing, which has just never been imaginable.

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:59.840
 And interestingly, more than half of the investigators in the Brain Initiative are

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:06.560
 engineers. They're not biologists in a traditional sense. I love that, maybe partly because my PhD

1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:12.560
 is in quantum mechanics. So I think it's really a good idea to bring disciplines together and

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:19.680
 see what happens. That's an exciting thing. And I will not ever forget having the chance to

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:26.400
 announce that program in the East Room in that White House with President Obama, who totally

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:32.720
 got it and totally loved science. And working with him in some of those rare moments of sort of

1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:37.840
 one on one conversation in the old office, just him and me about science, that's a gift.

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:44.640
 What's it like talking to Barack Obama about science? He seems to be a sponge. I've heard him,

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:50.800
 I'm an artificial intelligence person, and I've heard him talk about AI. And it was like, it made

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:55.120
 me think of somebody whispering in his ear or something because he was saying stuff that totally

1:02:55.120 --> 1:03:00.560
 passed the BS test. Like he really understands stuff. He does. That means he listened to a bunch

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:06.080
 of experts on AI. He was explaining the difference between narrow artificial intelligence and strong

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:11.440
 AI. Like he was saying all this both technical and philosophical stuff. And it just made me,

1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:16.640
 I don't know, it made me hopeful about the depth of understanding that a human being

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:21.280
 in political office can attain. That gave me hope as well and having those experiences.

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:27.200
 Oftentimes in a group, I mean, another example was trying to figure out how do we take what we've

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.480
 learned about the genome and really apply it at scale to figure out how to prevent illness,

1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:38.080
 not just treat it, but prevent it. Out of which came this program called All of Us, this million

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:44.480
 strong American cohort of participants who make their electronic health records and their genome

1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.280
 sequences and everything else available for researchers to look at. That came out of a

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:57.280
 lot of a couple of conversations with Obama and others in his office. And he asked the best

1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:03.040
 questions. That was what struck me so much. I mean, a room full of scientists and we'd be

1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:08.400
 talking about the possible approaches and he would come up with this incredibly insightful

1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:11.840
 penetrating question. Not that he knew what the answer was going to be, but he knew what the

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:19.120
 right question was. I think the core to that is curiosity. Yeah. I don't think he's even like

1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:26.080
 he's trying to be a good leader. He's legit curious. Yes. Legit. Almost like a kid in a

1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:31.120
 candy store gets to talk to the world experts. He somehow sneaked into this office and gets

1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:36.960
 to talk to the world experts. That's the kind of energy that I think leads to

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:43.440
 beautiful leadership in the space of science. Another thing I've been able to do as director

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:47.920
 is to try to break down some of the boundaries that seem to be traditional between the public

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:52.640
 and the private sectors. When it comes to areas of science that really could and should be open

1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:59.760
 access anyway, why don't we work together? And that was obvious early on. And after identifying

1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:06.640
 a few possible collaborators who are chief scientists of pharmaceutical companies,

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:11.760
 it looked like we might be able to do something in that space. Out of that was born something

1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:18.880
 called the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, AMP. And it took a couple of years of convening

1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:24.000
 people who usually didn't talk to each other. And there was a lot of suspicion. Academic scientists

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:29.040
 saying, oh, those scientists at Pharma, they're not that smart. They're just trying to make money.

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:34.960
 And the academic scientists getting the rap from the pharmaceutical scientists, all they want to do

1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:39.520
 is publish papers. They don't really care about helping anybody. And we found out both of those

1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:46.240
 stereotypes were wrong. And over the course of that couple of years, built a momentum behind

1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:52.000
 three starting projects, one on Alzheimer's, one on diabetes, one on rheumatoid arthritis and lupus,

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:57.120
 very different, each one of them trying to identify what is an area that we both really

1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.680
 need to see advance, and we could do better together. And it's going to have to be open access,

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:06.480
 otherwise NIH is not going to play. And guess what industry, if you really want to do this,

1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:10.640
 you got to have skin in the game. What cover half the cost, you got to cover the other half.

1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:16.080
 I love it. And forcing open access, so resulting in open science.

1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:21.680
 Millions of dollars gone into this. And it has been a wild success. After many people were skeptical.

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:28.320
 A couple years later, we had another project on Parkinson's. More recently, we added one on

1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:36.720
 schizophrenia. Just this week, we added one on gene therapy, on bespoke gene therapy for

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:41.520
 ultra rare diseases, which otherwise aren't going to have enough commercial appeal. But if we did

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:46.800
 this together, especially with FDA at the table, and they have been, we could make something happen,

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:51.520
 turn this into a sort of standardized approach where everything didn't have to be a one off.

1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:57.600
 I'm really excited about that. So what began as three projects is six, and it's about to be

1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:02.320
 seven next year with a heart failure project. And all of us have gotten to know each other.

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:08.160
 And if it weren't for that background, when COVID came along, it would have been a lot harder

1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:14.320
 to build the partnership called active, which has been my passion for the last 20 months,

1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:19.360
 accelerating COVID 19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines. We just had our leadership team

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:25.600
 meeting this morning. It was amazing what's been accomplished. That's a pretty much 100 people

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:30.400
 who dropped everything just to work on this about half from industry and half from government and

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:37.840
 academia. And that's how we got vaccine master protocols designed. So we all agreed about what

1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:42.880
 the endpoints had to be. And you wondered, why are there 30,000 participants in each of these

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:48.720
 trials? That's because of active group mapping out what the power needed to be for this to be

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:57.760
 convincing. Same with therapeutics. We have run at least 20 therapeutic agents through trials

1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:03.280
 that active supported in record time. That's how we got monoclonal antibodies that we know work.

1:08:05.360 --> 1:08:12.320
 That's been, that would not have been possible if I didn't already have a sense of how to work

1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:17.040
 with the private sector that came out of a hemp. Amp took two years to get started.

1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:23.200
 Active took two weeks. We just kept 100 people over. Yeah, kept the lawyers out of the room.

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:34.080
 Now you're going to get yourself in trouble. I do hope one day the story of this incredible

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:37.520
 vaccine development of vaccine protocols and trials and all this kind of details,

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:43.440
 the messy, beautiful details of science and engineering and that led to the manufacturing

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.560
 and the deployment and the scientific test. It's such a nice dance between engineering and the

1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:53.760
 space of manufacture of the vaccines. You start before the studies are complete. You start making

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:59.440
 the vaccines just in case that if the studies proved to be positive, then you can start deploying

1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:05.920
 them just like so many parties, like you said, private and public playing together. That's just

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:14.080
 a beautiful dance that is one of the, for me, the sources of hope in this very tricky time where

1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:22.240
 there's a lot of things to be cynical about in terms of the game's politicians play and the

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:26.880
 hardship experience of the economy and all those kinds of things. That to me, this dance

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:32.320
 was a vaccine development was done just beautifully and it gives me hope.

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:39.440
 It does me as well and it was in many ways the finest hour that science has had in a long time

1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:45.440
 being called upon when every day counted and making sure that time was not wasted

1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:49.600
 and things were done rigorously but quickly.

1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:56.800
 So you're incredibly good as the leader of the NIH. It seems like you're having a heck of a lot of

1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:06.800
 fun. Why step down from this role after so much fun? Well, no other NIH director has served more

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:11.920
 than one president after being appointed by one. You're sort of done and the idea being carried

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:19.280
 over for a second presidency with Trump and now a third one with Biden is unheard of. I just think

1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:26.240
 Lex at scientific organizations benefit from new vision and 12 years is a really long time

1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:32.080
 to have the same leader and if I wasn't going to stick it out for the entire Biden four year term,

1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:39.120
 it's good not to wait too late during that to signal an intent to step down because the president's

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:44.560
 got to find the right person, got to nominate them, got to get the Senate to confirm them which is a

1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:50.960
 unpredictable process right now and you don't want to try to do that in the second half of

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:55.280
 somebody's term as president. This has got to happen now. So I kind of decided back at the

1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:03.680
 end of May that this should be my final year and I'm okay with that. I do have some mixed emotions

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:12.560
 because I love the NIH. I love the job. It's exhausting. I'm traditionally for the last 20

1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:17.760
 months anyway working 100 hours a week. It's just that's what it takes to juggle all of this

1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:24.560
 and that keeps me from having a lot of time for anything else and I wouldn't mind because I don't

1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:30.320
 think I'm done yet. I wouldn't mind having some time to really think about what the next chapter

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:35.840
 should be and I have none of that time right now. Do I have another calling? Is there something else

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:43.520
 I could contribute that's different than this? I'd like to find that out. I think the right

1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:51.440
 answer is you're just stepping down to focus on your music career. That might not be a good plan

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:56.960
 for anything very sustainable. But I think that is a sign of a great leader as George Washington

1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:04.960
 did stepping down at the right time. Ted Williams. Yes. He quit. I think he hit a home run on his

1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:11.520
 last at bat and his average was 400 at the time. No one to walk away. I mean it's hard but it's

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:18.160
 beautiful to see in a leader. You also oversaw the Human Genome Project. You mentioned the

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:28.000
 Brain Initiative which is a dream to map the human brain and there's the dream to map the

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.960
 human code which was the Human Genome Project and you have said that it is humbling for me and

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:39.200
 awe inspiring to realize that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:47.120
 previously known only to God. How does that if you can just kind of wax poetic for a second?

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:53.840
 And how does it make you feel that we were able to map this instruction book, look into our own

1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:04.640
 code and be able to reverse engineer it? It's breathtaking. It's so fundamental and yet for

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:11.520
 all of human history we're ignorant of the details of what that instruction book looked like and then

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:18.320
 crossed the bridge into the territory of the known and we had that in front of us still written in

1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:23.760
 the language that we had to learn how to read and we're in the process of doing that and will be for

1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:31.680
 decades to come but we owned it. We had it and it has such profound consequences. It's both a book

1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:40.480
 about our history. It's a book of sort of the parts list of a human being, the genes that are in

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:47.600
 there and how they're regulated and it's also a medical textbook that can teach us things that

1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:53.600
 will provide answers to illnesses we don't understand and alleviate suffering and premature death. So

1:13:54.320 --> 1:14:00.080
 it's a pretty amazing thing to contemplate and it has utterly transformed the way we do science

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:06.320
 and it is in the process of transforming the way we do medicine although much of that still lies

1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:14.560
 ahead. While we were working on the genome project it was sort of hard to get this sense of

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:22.000
 awowness because it was just hard work and you were getting another megabase, okay this is good

1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:29.920
 but when did you actually step back and say we did it? It's the profoundness of that. I mean there

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:36.160
 were two points I guess. One was the announcement on that June 26, 2000 where the whole world heard,

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:41.520
 well we don't quite have it but we got a pretty good draft and suddenly people are like realizing

1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:48.640
 oh this is this is a big deal. For me it was more when we got the full analysis of it published

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:54.480
 it in February 2001 and that issue of nature paper that Eric Lander and Bob Waterston and I were

1:14:54.480 --> 1:15:01.040
 the main authors and we toiled over and tried to get as much insight as we could in there about

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:07.680
 what the meaning of all this was but you also had this sense that we are such beginning readers here

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:13.840
 we are still in kindergarten trying to make sense out of this three billion letter book

1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:17.200
 and we're going to be at this for generations to come.

1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:26.400
 You are a man of faith Christian and you are a man of science. What is the role of religion

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:33.760
 and of science and society and in the individual human mind and heart like yours?

1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:41.360
 Well I was not a person of faith when I was growing up. I became a believer in my 20s

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:48.400
 influenced as a medical student by a recognition that I hadn't really thought through the issues

1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:55.920
 of what's the meaning of life? Why are we all here? What happens when you die? Is there a God?

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:02.560
 Science is not so helpful in answering those questions so I had to look around in other places

1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:07.920
 and ultimately came to my own conclusion that atheism which is where I had been

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:14.000
 in was the least supportable of the choices because it was the assertion of a universal negative

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:22.000
 which scientists aren't supposed to do and agnosticism came as an attractive option but

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.800
 felt a little bit like a cop out so I had to keep going trying to figure out why do believers

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:33.440
 actually believe this stuff and came to realize it was all pretty compelling that there's no proof

1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:38.000
 I can't prove to you or anybody else that God exists but I can say it's pretty darn plausible

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:46.160
 and ultimately what kind of God is it? Caused me to search through various religions and see

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:53.040
 well what do people think about that and to my surprise encountered the person of Jesus Christ

1:16:53.040 --> 1:17:00.400
 as unique in every possible way and answering a lot of the questions I couldn't otherwise answer

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:07.520
 and somewhat kicking and screaming I became a Christian even though at the time

1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:13.440
 as a medical student already interested in genetics people predicted my head would then

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:21.440
 explode because these were incompatible worldviews they really have not been for me I am so

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:29.680
 fortunate I think that in a given day wrestling with an issue it can have both the rigorous

1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:34.560
 scientific component and it can have the spiritual component COVID 19 is a great example

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:40.480
 these vaccines are both an amazing scientific achievement and an answer to prayer

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:47.440
 when I'm wrestling with vaccine hesitancy and trying to figure out what answers to come up with I get

1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:55.200
 so frustrated sometimes and I'm comforted by reassurances that God is aware of that this is

1:17:55.200 --> 1:18:03.680
 I don't have to do this alone so I know there are people like your friend Sam Harris who feel

1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:10.800
 differently Sam wrote a rather famous op ed in the New York Times when I was nominated as the NIH

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:20.320
 director saying this is a terrible mistake you can't have somebody who believes in God running

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:27.360
 the NIH and he's just going to completely ruin the place well I have a testimonial Christopher

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:33.520
 Hitchens a devout atheist if I could say so oh yeah was a friend of yours and referred to you as

1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:39.040
 quote one of the greatest living Americans and stated that you are one of the most devout believers

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:44.240
 he has ever met he further stated that you were sequencing the genome of the cancer that would

1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:49.840
 ultimately claim his life and that your friendship despite their differing opinions on religion

1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:56.880
 was an example of the greatest armed truth in modern times what did you learn from Christopher

1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:01.840
 Hitchens about life or perhaps what is the fond memory you have of this man with whom you've

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:11.680
 disagreed but who's also your friend yeah I loved Hitch I'm sorry he's gone iron sharpens iron

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:18.240
 there's nothing better for trying to figure out where you are with your own situation and your

1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:23.520
 own opinions your own worldviews than encountering somebody who's completely in another space

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:30.320
 and who's got the gift as Hitch did of challenging everything and doing so over a glass of scotch

1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:38.640
 or two or three yeah we got off to a rough start where in a interaction we had at a rather high

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:46.080
 brow dinner he was really deeply insulting of a question I was asking but you know I was like

1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:50.480
 okay uh that's fine let's let's figure out how we could have a more civil conversation

1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:57.520
 and then I really learned to greatly admire his intellect and to find the jousting with him

1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:04.400
 and it wasn't all about faith although it often was uh it was really inspiring and innovating

1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:11.520
 energizing and then when he got cancer I became sort of his ally trying to help him find pathways

1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:18.800
 through the various options and maybe helped him to stay around on this planet for an extra six

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:28.800
 months or so and I have the warmest feelings of being in his apartment downtown over a glass of wine

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:35.600
 talking about whatever sometimes it was science he was fascinated by science sometimes it was

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:43.280
 Thomas Jefferson uh sometimes it was faith and I knew it would always be really interesting

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:50.720
 so he's not gone yeah do you think about your own mortality are you afraid of death

1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:56.080
 I'm not afraid I'm not looking forward to it I don't want to rush it because I feel like I got

1:20:56.080 --> 1:21:03.920
 some things I can still do here but as a person of faith I don't think I'm afraid I'm 71 I know

1:21:03.920 --> 1:21:10.400
 I don't have an infinite amount of time left and I want to use the time I've got in some sort of way

1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:19.200
 that matters I'm not ready to become a full time golfer but I don't quite know what that is

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:27.680
 I do feel that I've had a chance to do amazingly powerful things as far as experiences

1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:35.200
 and maybe God has something else in mind I wrote this book 16 years ago the language of God

1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:41.680
 about science and faith trying to explain how from my perspective these are compatible these

1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:48.080
 are in harmony they're complementary if you are careful about which kind of question you're asking

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:53.840
 and to my surprise a lot of people seem to be interested in that they were tired of hearing

1:21:53.840 --> 1:22:02.000
 the extreme voices like Dawkins at one end and people like Ken Ham and answers and Genesis

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.040
 on the other end saying if you trust science you're going to hell and they thought there must

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:10.880
 be a way that these things could get along and that's what I tried to put forward and then I

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:16.640
 started a foundation by Ologos which then I had to step away from to become NIH director

1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:23.040
 which has just flourished maybe because I stepped away I don't know but it now has millions of people

1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:28.160
 who come to that website and they run amazing meetings and I think a lot of people have really

1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:32.960
 come to a sense that this is okay I can love science and I can love God and that's not a bad

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:39.120
 thing so maybe there's something more I can do in that space maybe that book is ready for a second

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:47.040
 edition I think so but when you look back life is finite what do you hope your legacy is

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:54.960
 hmm I don't know this whole legacy thing it's a little bit hard to embrace it feels a little

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:58.960
 self promoting doesn't it I've sort of feel like in many ways I went to my own funeral

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:04.800
 on October 5th when I announced that I was stepping down and I got the most amazing responses

1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:10.720
 from people some of whom I knew really well some of whom I didn't know at all who were just telling

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:17.280
 me stories about something that I had contributed to that made a difference to them and that was

1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:22.960
 incredibly heartwarming and that's enough you know I don't want to build an edifice I don't have a

1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:30.480
 plan for a monument or a statue God help us I do feel like I've been incredibly fortunate I've had

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:37.760
 the chance to play a role in things that were pretty profound from the genome project to NIH to

1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:44.880
 COVID vaccines and I ought to be plenty satisfied that I've had enough experiences here to feel

1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:52.320
 pretty good about the way in which my life panned out we did a bunch of difficult questions

1:23:52.320 --> 1:24:00.000
 in this conversation let me ask the most difficult one that perhaps is the reason you turn to God

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:08.960
 what is the meaning of life have you figured it out yet expect me to put that into three sentences

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:12.240
 we only have a couple of minutes at least hurry up

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:19.920
 well that's not a question I think science helps me with so you're gonna push me into the face

1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:25.600
 zone which is where I'd want to go with that I think well what is the meaning why are we here

1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:32.480
 what do we put here to do I do believe we're here for just a blink of an eye and that our existence

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:38.880
 somehow goes on beyond that in a way that I don't entirely understand despite efforts to do so

1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:45.600
 I think we are called upon in this blink of an eye to try to make the world a better place

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:57.280
 to try to love people to try to do a better job of our more altruistic instincts and less of our

1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:06.960
 selfish instincts to try to be what God calls us to be people who are holy not people who are

1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:15.280
 are driven by self indulgence and sometimes I'm better at that than others but I think that

1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:21.760
 for me as a Christian is a pretty clear I mean it's to live out the sermon on the mount

1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:29.840
 once I read that I couldn't unread it all those beatitudes all the blessings

1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:36.160
 that's what we're supposed to do and the meaning of life is to strive for that standard

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.200
 recognizing you're going to fail over and over again and that God forgives you

1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:46.560
 hopefully to put a little bit of love out there into the world that's what it's about

1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:56.240
 Francis I'm truly humbled and inspired by both your brilliance and your humility

1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:00.640
 and that you would spend your extremely valuable time with me today it was really an honor thank

1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:06.960
 you so much for talking today I was glad to and you asked a really good question so your reputation

1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:13.280
 as the best podcaster has worn itself out here this afternoon thank you so much thanks for listening

1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.840
 to this conversation with Francis Collins to support this podcast please check out our sponsors

1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:23.680
 in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Newton reflecting on his

1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:30.960
 life and work I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself

1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:37.280
 and now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great

1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:54.320
 ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
