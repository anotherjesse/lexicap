 The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll, part two, the second time we've spoken on the

00:05.120 --> 00:11.600
 podcast. You can get the link to the first time in the description. This time we focus on quantum

00:11.600 --> 00:17.120
 mechanics and the many worlds interpretation that he details elegantly in his new book titled

00:17.120 --> 00:24.480
 Something Deeply Hidden. I own and enjoy both the ebook and audiobook versions of it. Listening

00:24.480 --> 00:31.040
 to Sean read about entanglement, complementarity, and the emergence of space time reminds me of Bob Ross

00:31.600 --> 00:36.800
 teaching the world how to paint on his old television show. If you don't know who Bob Ross is,

00:37.840 --> 00:43.600
 you're truly missing out. Look him up. He'll make you fall in love with painting. Sean Carroll

00:44.320 --> 00:50.240
 is the Bob Ross of theoretical physics. He's the author of several popular books,

00:50.240 --> 00:56.320
 a host of a great podcast called Mindscape and is a theoretical physicist at Caltech

00:56.320 --> 01:02.320
 and the Santa Fe Institute, specializing in quantum mechanics, error of time, cosmology,

01:02.320 --> 01:07.840
 and gravitation. This is the artificial intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it,

01:13.200 --> 01:20.720
 with me on Twitter at Lex Freedman, spelled F R I D M A N. And now here's my conversation

01:20.720 --> 01:27.680
 with Sean Carroll. Isaac Newton developed what we now call classical mechanics that you describe

01:27.680 --> 01:34.000
 very nicely in your new book as you do with a lot of basic concepts in physics. So with classical

01:34.000 --> 01:41.520
 mechanics, I can throw a rock and can predict the trajectory of that rock's flight. But if we could

01:41.520 --> 01:49.280
 put ourselves back into Newton's time, his theories work to predict things. But as I understand, he

01:49.280 --> 01:56.160
 himself thought that they were the interpretations of those predictions were absurd. Perhaps he

01:56.160 --> 02:02.160
 just said it for religious reasons and so on. But in particular, sort of a world of interaction

02:02.160 --> 02:07.760
 without contact. So action at a distance. It didn't make sense to him on a sort of a human

02:07.760 --> 02:14.880
 interpretation level. Does it make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance?

02:16.240 --> 02:21.760
 It does. So that was one of Newton's worries. You're actually right in a slightly different way

02:21.760 --> 02:28.320
 about the religious worries. He was smart enough. This is off the topic, but still fascinating.

02:28.320 --> 02:34.320
 Newton almost invented chaos theory as soon as he invented classical mechanics. He realized that in

02:34.320 --> 02:39.360
 the solar system, so he was able to explain how planets move around the sun. But typically, you

02:39.360 --> 02:44.560
 would describe the orbit of the Earth ignoring the effects of Jupiter and Saturn and so forth,

02:44.560 --> 02:49.680
 just doing the Earth and the Sun. He kind of knew, even though he couldn't do the math, that if you

02:49.680 --> 02:54.000
 included the effects of Jupiter and Saturn and the other planets, the solar system would be unstable,

02:54.000 --> 02:58.400
 like the orbits of the planets would get out of whack. So he thought that God would intervene

02:58.400 --> 03:02.160
 occasionally to sort of move the planets back into orbit, which is how you only way you could

03:02.160 --> 03:07.040
 explain how they were there, presumably forever. But the worries about classical mechanics were

03:07.040 --> 03:10.640
 a little bit different. The worry about gravity in particular. It wasn't a worry about classical

03:10.640 --> 03:15.520
 mechanics. We're about gravity. How in the world does the Earth know that there's something called

03:15.520 --> 03:21.120
 the Sun 93 million miles away that is exerting a gravitational force on it? And he literally said,

03:21.120 --> 03:25.600
 you know, I leave that for future generations to think about because I don't know what the answer

03:25.600 --> 03:31.600
 is. And in fact, people under emphasize this, but future generations figured it out. Pierre

03:31.600 --> 03:39.440
 Simone Laplace in circa 1800 showed that you could rewrite Newtonian gravity as a field theory. So

03:39.440 --> 03:43.680
 instead of just talking about the force due to gravity, you can talk about the gravitational

03:43.680 --> 03:48.640
 field or the gravitational potential field. And then there's no action at a distance. It's exactly

03:48.640 --> 03:52.880
 the same theory empirically. It makes exactly the same predictions. But what's happening is,

03:52.880 --> 03:57.920
 instead of the Sun just reaching out across the void, there is a gravitational field in between

03:57.920 --> 04:04.160
 the Sun and the Earth that obeys an equation Laplace's equation, cleverly enough. And that tells

04:04.160 --> 04:09.680
 us exactly what the field does. So even in Newtonian gravity, you don't need action at a distance.

04:09.680 --> 04:13.760
 Now, what many people say is that Einstein solved this problem because he invented general

04:13.760 --> 04:18.320
 relativity. And in general relativity, there's certainly a field in between the Earth and the

04:18.320 --> 04:24.000
 Sun. But also there's the speed of light as a limit in Laplace's theory, which was exactly Newton's

04:24.000 --> 04:28.960
 theory just in a different mathematical language. There could still be instantaneous action across

04:28.960 --> 04:34.560
 the universe. Whereas in general relativity, if you shake something here, its gravitational impulse

04:34.560 --> 04:38.160
 radiates out at the speed of light. And we call that a gravitational wave, and we can detect those.

04:39.120 --> 04:45.440
 So but I really, it rubs me the wrong way to think that we should presume the answer should

04:45.440 --> 04:51.360
 look one way or the other. Like if it turned out that there was action at a distance in physics,

04:51.360 --> 04:55.600
 and that was the best way to describe things, then I would do it that way. It's actually a very

04:55.600 --> 05:01.120
 deep question because when we don't know what the right laws of physics are, when we're guessing at

05:01.120 --> 05:06.320
 them, when we're hypothesizing at what they might be, we are often guided by our intuitions about

05:06.320 --> 05:11.120
 what they should be. I mean, Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions. And he did

05:11.120 --> 05:17.600
 not like the idea of action at a distance. We don't know whether he was right or not. It depends

05:17.600 --> 05:22.240
 on your interpretation of quantum mechanics. And it depends on even how you talk about quantum

05:22.240 --> 05:27.840
 mechanics within any one interpretation. So if you see every force as a field, or any other

05:27.840 --> 05:35.920
 interpretation of action at a distance, I mean, it's just stepping back to sort of cave man thinking.

05:37.120 --> 05:43.760
 Like, do you really, can you really sort of understand what it means for a force to be

05:43.760 --> 05:48.480
 a field that's everywhere? So if you look at gravity, what do you think about? I think so.

05:49.120 --> 05:58.320
 Is this something that you've been conditioned by society to think that, to map the fact that

05:58.320 --> 06:05.920
 science is extremely well predictive of something, to believing that you actually understand it,

06:05.920 --> 06:11.760
 like you can intuitively, the degree that human beings can understand anything,

06:11.760 --> 06:17.360
 that you actually understand it, are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive

06:17.360 --> 06:24.080
 power of science? That depends on what you mean by this idea of truly understanding something.

06:25.200 --> 06:32.480
 I mean, can I truly understand Fermat's last theorem? It's easy to state it, but do I really

06:32.480 --> 06:39.120
 appreciate what it means for incredibly large numbers? I think yes, I think I do understand it,

06:39.120 --> 06:43.840
 but like if you want to just push people on well, but your intuition doesn't go to the places where

06:43.840 --> 06:49.120
 Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's last theorem, then I can say fine, but I still think

06:49.120 --> 06:54.320
 I understand the theorem. And likewise, I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding

06:54.320 --> 06:59.600
 of fields pervading space time, whether it's the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field

06:59.600 --> 07:07.200
 or whatever, the Higgs field. Of course, one's intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier

07:07.200 --> 07:12.720
 in the quantum field theory and all sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.280
 So our intuitions aren't perfect, but I think it's also okay to say that our intuitions get

07:17.280 --> 07:23.040
 trained. I have different intuitions now than I had when I was a baby. That's okay. An intuition

07:23.040 --> 07:27.200
 is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are. We can train it a little bit.

07:27.200 --> 07:33.520
 So that's where I'm going to bring in Noam Chomsky for a second, who thinks that our cognitive

07:33.520 --> 07:41.920
 abilities are evolved through time. And so they're biologically constrained. And so there's a clear

07:41.920 --> 07:47.680
 limit as he puts it to our cognitive abilities. And it's a very harsh limit. But you actually

07:47.680 --> 07:53.760
 kind of said something interesting in nature versus nurture thing here is we can train our

07:53.760 --> 07:58.480
 intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to understand some of these

07:58.480 --> 08:04.640
 tricky concepts. So do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rooted,

08:05.200 --> 08:08.400
 hardcoded into our biology that we can't overcome?

08:09.680 --> 08:16.880
 There could be limits to things like our ability to visualize. But when someone like Ed Whitten

08:16.880 --> 08:22.800
 proves a theorem about 100 dimensional mathematical spaces, he's not visualizing it. He's doing

08:22.800 --> 08:29.200
 the math. That doesn't stop him from understanding the result. I think, and I would love to understand

08:29.200 --> 08:35.280
 this better, but my rough feeling, which is not very educated, is that there's some threshold

08:35.280 --> 08:42.560
 that one crosses in abstraction when one becomes kind of like a Turing machine. One has the ability

08:42.560 --> 08:49.520
 to contain in one's brain logical, formal, symbolic structures and manipulate them. And that's a

08:49.520 --> 08:56.320
 leap that we can make as human beings that dogs and cats haven't made. And once you get there,

08:57.200 --> 09:02.320
 I'm not sure there are any limits to our ability to understand the scientific world at all. Maybe

09:02.320 --> 09:08.160
 there are. There's certainly limits on our ability to calculate things, right? People are not very

09:08.160 --> 09:13.280
 good at taking cube roots of million digit numbers in their head. But that's not an element of

09:13.280 --> 09:18.080
 understanding. It's certainly not a limited principle. So of course, as a human, you would say

09:18.080 --> 09:26.640
 there doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding. But sort of, have you thought that the universe is

09:26.640 --> 09:33.760
 actually a lot simpler than it appears to us? And we just will never be able to, like it's outside of

09:33.760 --> 09:43.120
 our, okay, so us, our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind

09:43.120 --> 09:51.440
 of experimental simulation devices we can put together. Is there limits to that? Is it possible

09:51.440 --> 09:57.840
 there's limits to that? Well, of course it's possible there are limits to that. Is there any

09:57.840 --> 10:03.680
 good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is a harder question. Look, imagine

10:03.680 --> 10:08.720
 asking this question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers, right? Like, are we approaching

10:08.720 --> 10:14.640
 the limits of our ability to understand the natural world? And by definition, there are questions

10:14.640 --> 10:18.960
 about the natural world that are most interesting to us that are the ones we don't quite yet

10:18.960 --> 10:23.280
 understand, right? So there's always, we're always faced with these puzzles we don't yet know. And I

10:23.280 --> 10:26.720
 don't know what they would have said 500 years ago, but they didn't even know about classical

10:26.720 --> 10:32.400
 mechanics, much less quantum mechanics. So we know that they were nowhere close to how well they could

10:32.400 --> 10:37.440
 do, right? They could do it normally better than they were doing at the time. I see no reason why

10:37.440 --> 10:41.920
 the same thing isn't true for us today. So of all the worries that keep me awake at night,

10:41.920 --> 10:46.720
 the human mind's inability to rationally comprehend the world is low on the list.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.920
 Well put. So one interesting philosophical point and quantum mechanics bring up is the,

10:53.920 --> 11:00.160
 that you talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we observe it.

11:00.160 --> 11:08.560
 So staying at the human level for a second, how big is the gap between what our perception system

11:08.560 --> 11:15.840
 allows us to see and the world as it is outside our mind's eye, sort of, sort of not at the

11:15.840 --> 11:22.080
 quantum mechanical level, but as just our, these particular tools we have, which is the

11:22.080 --> 11:28.240
 few senses and cognitive abilities to process those senses. Well, that last phrase, having

11:28.240 --> 11:33.840
 the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot, right? I mean, there is our sort of

11:33.840 --> 11:39.120
 intuitive understanding of the world. You don't need to teach people about gravity for them to

11:39.120 --> 11:43.440
 know that apples fall from trees, right? That's something that we figure out pretty quickly.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.680
 Object permanence, things like that. The three dimensionality of space, even if we don't have

11:47.680 --> 11:53.600
 the mathematical language to say that, we kind of know that it's true. On the other hand, no one

11:53.600 --> 11:58.960
 opens their eyes and sees atoms, right, or molecules or cells, for that matter, forget about quantum

11:58.960 --> 12:05.520
 mechanics. So, but we got there, we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells

12:05.520 --> 12:12.960
 using the combination of our senses and our cognitive capacities. So adding the ability

12:12.960 --> 12:17.360
 of our cognitive capacities to our senses is adding an enormous amount. And I don't think

12:17.360 --> 12:22.240
 it is a hard and fast boundary. You know, if you believe in cells, if you believe that we

12:22.240 --> 12:27.440
 understand those, there's no reason you believe we can't believe in quantum mechanics just as well.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.240
 What to use the most beautiful idea in physics?

12:36.160 --> 12:42.320
 Conservation of momentum. Can you elaborate? Yeah. If you were Aristotle, when Aristotle

12:42.320 --> 12:45.760
 wrote his book on physics, he made the following very obvious point. We're on video here, right?

12:45.760 --> 12:50.480
 So people can see this. So if I push the bottle, let me cover this bottle so we do not have a

12:50.480 --> 12:54.720
 mess. But okay. So I push the bottle, it moves. And if I stop pushing, it stops moving.

12:55.760 --> 13:00.720
 And this is this kind of thing has repeated a large number of times all over the place.

13:00.720 --> 13:06.560
 If you don't keep pushing things, they stop moving. This is a indisputably true fact about

13:06.560 --> 13:13.440
 our everyday environment. Okay. And for Aristotle, this blew up into a whole picture of the world

13:13.440 --> 13:18.640
 in which things had natures and teleologies and they had places they wanted to be. And when

13:18.640 --> 13:22.480
 you were pushing them, you were moving them away from where they wanted to be and they would return

13:22.480 --> 13:29.200
 and stuff like that. And it took 1,000 years or 1,500 years for people to say, actually,

13:30.960 --> 13:35.600
 if it weren't for things like dissipation and air resistance and friction and so forth,

13:35.600 --> 13:42.240
 the natural thing is for things to move forever in a straight line at constant velocity, right?

13:42.240 --> 13:48.560
 Conservation of momentum. And that is the reason why I think that's the most beautiful idea

13:48.560 --> 13:56.480
 in physics is because it shifts us from a view of natures and teleology to a view of patterns

13:56.480 --> 14:04.720
 in the world. So when you were Aristotle, you needed to talk a vocabulary of why is this happening,

14:04.720 --> 14:09.200
 what's the purpose of it, what's the cause, etc., because its nature does or does not want to do

14:09.200 --> 14:14.160
 that. Whereas once you believe in conservation momentum, things just happen. They just follow

14:14.160 --> 14:19.920
 the pattern. You have Laplace's demon ultimately, right? You give me the state of the world today.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.360
 I can predict what it's going to do in the future. I can predict where it was in the past. It's

14:23.360 --> 14:29.680
 impersonal and it's also instantaneous. It's not directed toward any future goals. It's just doing

14:29.680 --> 14:34.160
 what it does, given the current state of the universe. I think even more than either classical

14:34.160 --> 14:39.920
 mechanics or quantum mechanics, that is the profound deep insight that gets modern science off

14:39.920 --> 14:45.680
 the ground. You don't need natures and purposes and goals. You just need some patterns.

14:45.680 --> 14:51.360
 So it's the first moment in our understanding of the way the universe works where you branch from

14:52.080 --> 14:59.280
 the intuitive physical space to the space of ideas. And also the other point you said, which is

14:59.920 --> 15:06.480
 conveniently most of the interesting ideas are acting in the moment. You don't need to know

15:06.480 --> 15:12.240
 the history of time or the future. And of course, this took a long time to get there, right? The

15:12.240 --> 15:17.360
 conservation momentum itself took hundreds of years. It's weird because someone would say

15:17.360 --> 15:21.680
 something interesting and then the next interesting thing would be said like 150 or 200 years later,

15:21.680 --> 15:24.160
 right? They weren't even talking to each other. They were reading each other's books.

15:24.800 --> 15:29.680
 And probably the first person to directly say that in outer space, in the vacuum,

15:30.400 --> 15:34.160
 projectile would move at a constant velocity was Avicenna,

15:34.160 --> 15:40.720
 Avicenna in the Persian golden age, circa 1000. And he didn't like the idea. He used that just

15:40.720 --> 15:45.920
 like Schrodinger used Schrodinger's cat to say, surely you don't believe that, right? Avicenna

15:45.920 --> 15:48.800
 was saying, surely you don't believe there really is a vacuum because if there was a

15:48.800 --> 15:53.840
 really vacuum, things could keep moving forever, right? But still, he got right the idea that

15:53.840 --> 16:00.000
 there was this conservation of something impetus or mile, he would call it. And that's 500 years,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.200
 600 years before classical mechanics and Isaac Newton. So Galileo played a big role in this,

16:05.200 --> 16:10.240
 but he didn't exactly get it right. And so it just takes a long time for this to sink in because

16:10.240 --> 16:16.720
 it is so against our everyday experience. Do you think it was a big leap, a brave or a difficult

16:16.720 --> 16:25.040
 leap of sort of math and science to be able to say that momentum was conserved?

16:25.040 --> 16:33.440
 I do. I think it's an example of human reason in action. Even Aristotle knew that his theory had

16:33.440 --> 16:39.040
 issues because you could fire an arrow and it would go a long way before it stopped. So if his

16:39.040 --> 16:44.000
 theory was things just automatically stop, what's going on? And he had this elaborate story. I don't

16:44.000 --> 16:49.440
 know if you've heard the story, but the arrow would push the air in front of it away and the

16:49.440 --> 16:54.640
 molecules of air would run around the back of the arrow and push it again. And anyone reading this

16:54.640 --> 16:58.960
 is going like, really, that's what you thought. But it was that kind of thought experiment that

16:58.960 --> 17:02.080
 ultimately got people to say, like, actually, no, if it weren't for the air molecules at all,

17:02.080 --> 17:07.920
 the arrow would just go on by itself. And it's always this give and take between thought and

17:07.920 --> 17:11.440
 experience back and forth, right? Theory and experiment, we would say today.

17:13.280 --> 17:20.400
 Another big question that I think comes up certainly with quantum mechanics is what's

17:20.400 --> 17:28.560
 the difference between math and physics to you. To me, very, very roughly, math is about

17:28.560 --> 17:32.400
 the logical structure of all possible worlds and physics is about our actual world.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.920
 And it just feels like our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about

17:39.920 --> 17:45.280
 interpretations of quantum mechanics or no. I'm certainly using the word world in the

17:45.280 --> 17:51.360
 broadest sense, all of reality. So I think that reality is specific. I don't think that

17:51.360 --> 17:55.440
 there's every possible thing going on in reality. I think that there are rules,

17:55.440 --> 18:00.560
 whether it's the Schrodinger equation or whatever. So I think that there's a sensible

18:00.560 --> 18:05.040
 notion of the set of all possible worlds, and we live in one of them. The world that we're

18:05.040 --> 18:08.400
 talking about might be a multiverse, might be many worlds of quantum mechanics, might be much

18:08.400 --> 18:13.200
 bigger than the world of our everyday experience, but it's still one physically contiguous world

18:13.200 --> 18:23.920
 in some sense. But so if you look at the overlap of math and physics, it feels like when physics

18:23.920 --> 18:30.560
 tries to reach for understanding of our world, it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond

18:30.560 --> 18:38.800
 the limit of our current understanding. What do you make of that process of sort of using math to

18:38.800 --> 18:44.160
 start maybe with intuition, or you might start with the math and then build up an intuition,

18:44.160 --> 18:49.200
 or but this kind of reaching into the darkness, into the mystery of the world with math?

18:49.920 --> 18:55.120
 Well, I think I would put it a little bit differently. I think we have theories, theories

18:55.120 --> 19:01.040
 of the physical world, which we then extrapolate and ask, what do we conclude if we take these

19:01.040 --> 19:06.560
 seriously well beyond where we've actually tested them? It is separately true that math is really,

19:06.560 --> 19:11.040
 really useful when we construct physical theories. And you know, famously Eugene Wigner asked about

19:11.040 --> 19:16.640
 the unreasonable success of mathematics and physics. I think that's a little bit wrong because

19:17.280 --> 19:22.640
 anything that could happen, any other theory of physics that wasn't the real world, but some other

19:22.640 --> 19:28.800
 world, you could always describe it mathematically. It's just that it might be a mess. The surprising

19:28.800 --> 19:34.480
 thing is not that math works, but that the math is so simple and easy that you can write it down

19:34.480 --> 19:41.280
 on a t shirt, right? I mean, that's what is amazing. That's an enormous compression of information that

19:41.280 --> 19:46.560
 seems to be valid in the real world. So that's an interesting fact about our world, which maybe we

19:46.560 --> 19:53.280
 couldn't hope to explain or just take as a brute fact, I don't know. But once you have that, there's

19:53.280 --> 19:58.880
 this indelible relationship between math and physics. But philosophically, I do want to separate

19:58.880 --> 20:03.920
 them. What we extrapolate, we don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrong math

20:03.920 --> 20:08.240
 that doesn't apply to our world, right? We extrapolate the physical theory that we best

20:08.240 --> 20:14.960
 think explains our world. Again, an unanswerable question. Why do you think our world is so easily

20:14.960 --> 20:22.560
 compressible into beautiful equations? Yeah. I mean, like I just hinted at, I don't know if there's

20:22.560 --> 20:27.600
 an answer to that question. There could be. What would an answer look like? Well, an answer could

20:27.600 --> 20:32.480
 look like if you showed that there was something about our world that maximized something,

20:32.480 --> 20:40.160
 you know, the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics. Or, you know,

20:40.160 --> 20:43.760
 whether maybe we're just generic, maybe in a set of all possible worlds, this is what the world

20:43.760 --> 20:49.440
 would look like, right? Like, I don't really know. I tend to think not. I tend to think that there is

20:49.440 --> 20:55.760
 something specific and rock bottom about the facts of our world that don't have further explanation,

20:55.760 --> 21:00.240
 like the fact that the world exists at all. And furthermore, the specific laws of physics that

21:00.240 --> 21:04.320
 we have, I think that in some sense, we're just going to, at some level, we're going to say,

21:04.320 --> 21:08.160
 and that's how it is. And, you know, we can't explain anything more. I don't know how,

21:08.160 --> 21:11.920
 if we're anywhere close to that right now, but that seems plausible to me.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.880
 And speaking of rock bottom, one of the things sort of your book kind of reminded me or revealed to

21:16.880 --> 21:24.160
 me is that what's fundamental and what's emergent, it just feels like I don't even know anymore

21:24.160 --> 21:30.720
 what's fundamental in physics. If there's anything, it feels like everything, especially with quantum

21:30.720 --> 21:37.680
 mechanics, is revealing to us is that most interesting things that I would, as a limited

21:37.680 --> 21:47.120
 human would think are fundamental can actually be explained as emergent from the more deeper

21:48.080 --> 21:53.440
 laws. I mean, we don't know, of course. You had to get that on the table. We don't know what is

21:53.440 --> 21:58.800
 fundamental. We do have reason to say that certain things are more fundamental than others, right?

22:00.000 --> 22:03.520
 Atoms and molecules are more fundamental than cells and organs.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.720
 Quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules. We don't know if that ever bottoms

22:08.720 --> 22:14.640
 out. I do think that there's sensible ways to think about this. If you describe something

22:14.640 --> 22:19.280
 like this table as a table, it has a height and a width, and it's made of a certain material,

22:19.280 --> 22:24.080
 and it has a certain solidity and weight and so forth. That's a very useful description as far

22:24.080 --> 22:28.480
 as it goes. There's a whole another description of this table in terms of a whole collection of

22:28.480 --> 22:34.800
 atoms strung together in certain ways. The language of the atoms is more comprehensive

22:34.800 --> 22:39.120
 than the language of the table. You could break apart the table, smash it to pieces,

22:39.120 --> 22:43.600
 still talk about it as atoms, but you could no longer talk about it as a table, right?

22:43.600 --> 22:48.800
 So I think of this comprehensiveness, the domain of validity of a theory gets broader and broader

22:48.800 --> 22:56.400
 as the theory gets more and more fundamental. So what do you think Newton would say,

22:57.280 --> 23:01.680
 maybe write in a book review, if you read your latest book on quantum mechanics,

23:01.680 --> 23:07.200
 something deeply hidden? It would take a long time for him to think that any of this was making

23:07.200 --> 23:12.160
 any sense. You catch him up pretty quick in the beginning. Yeah. You give him a shout out in the

23:12.160 --> 23:16.640
 beginning. That's right. I mean, he was the man. I'm happy to say that Newton was the greatest

23:16.640 --> 23:21.360
 scientists who ever lived. I mean, he invented calculus in his spare time, which would have

23:21.360 --> 23:24.640
 made him the greatest mathematician just all by himself, right? All by that one thing.

23:25.360 --> 23:32.240
 But of course, you know, it's funny because Newton was in some sense still a pre modern

23:32.240 --> 23:38.320
 thinker. Rocky Cole, who was a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said that Galileo,

23:39.120 --> 23:44.000
 even though he came before Newton, was a more modern thinker than Newton was. Like if you got

23:44.000 --> 23:47.440
 Galileo and brought him to the present day, you'd take him six months to catch up and then he'd

23:47.440 --> 23:51.840
 be in your office telling you why your most recent paper was wrong. Whereas Newton just

23:51.840 --> 23:57.920
 thought in this kind of more mystical way, you know, he wrote a lot more about the Bible and

23:57.920 --> 24:03.520
 alchemy than he ever did about physics. And but he was also more brilliant than anybody else and

24:03.520 --> 24:09.280
 way more mathematically astute than Galileo. So I really don't know, you know, he might have,

24:09.280 --> 24:13.200
 he might just say like, give me the textbooks, leave me alone for a few months and then

24:13.200 --> 24:19.520
 be caught up. But he or he might have had mental blocks against against seeing the world in this

24:19.520 --> 24:23.920
 way. I really don't know. Or perhaps find an interesting mystical interpretation of quantum

24:23.920 --> 24:28.960
 mechanics. Very possible. Yeah. Is there any other scientists or philosophers through history

24:28.960 --> 24:37.360
 that you would like to know their opinion of your book? That's a good question. I mean, Einstein

24:37.360 --> 24:41.680
 is the obvious one, right? You all, I mean, he was not that long ago, but I speculate at the end

24:41.680 --> 24:47.440
 of my book about what his opinion would be. I am curious as to, you know, what about older

24:47.440 --> 24:51.920
 philosophers like Hume or Kant, right? Like, what would they have thought or Aristotle, you know?

24:52.800 --> 24:57.440
 What would they have thought about modern physics? Because they do in philosophy, your

24:57.440 --> 25:03.360
 predilections end up playing a much bigger role in your ultimate conclusions because you're not

25:03.360 --> 25:09.520
 as tied down by what the data is. In physics, you know, physics is lucky because we can't stray

25:09.520 --> 25:13.600
 too far off the reservation as long as we're trying to explain the world that we actually see in our

25:13.600 --> 25:19.600
 telescopes and microscopes. But it's just not fair to play that game because the people we're

25:19.600 --> 25:24.880
 thinking about didn't know a whole bunch of things that we know, right? Like, we lived through a lot

25:24.880 --> 25:30.240
 that they didn't live through. So by the time we got them caught up, they'd be different people.

25:32.480 --> 25:38.560
 So let me ask a bunch of basic questions. I think it'll be interesting, useful for people who are

25:38.560 --> 25:44.880
 not familiar, but even for people who are extremely well familiar. Let's start with what is quantum

25:44.880 --> 25:51.520
 mechanics? Quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics that came into being in the early

25:51.520 --> 25:57.760
 part of the 20th century that replaced classical mechanics. And it replaced classical mechanics

25:57.760 --> 26:02.160
 in a weird way that we're still coming to terms with. So in classical mechanics, you have an

26:02.160 --> 26:06.800
 object, it has a location, it has a velocity. And if you know the location and velocity of

26:06.800 --> 26:10.960
 everything in the world, you can say what everything's going to do. Quantum mechanics

26:11.680 --> 26:17.040
 has an aspect of it that is kind of on the same lines. There's something called the quantum state

26:17.040 --> 26:22.400
 or the wave function. And there's an equation governing what the quantum state does. So it's

26:22.400 --> 26:27.120
 very much like classical mechanics. The wave function is different. It's sort of a wave. It's a

26:27.120 --> 26:31.840
 vector in a huge dimensional vector space rather than a position and a velocity. But okay, that's

26:31.840 --> 26:37.440
 a detail. And the equation is the Schrodinger equation, not Newton's laws, but okay, again, a detail.

26:37.440 --> 26:42.720
 Where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that there's a whole other set of rules

26:42.720 --> 26:47.680
 in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics, in addition to saying that there's a quantum state

26:47.680 --> 26:52.080
 and it evolves in time. And all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at

26:52.080 --> 26:57.440
 the system, when you observe it, when you measure it. In classical mechanics, there were no rules

26:57.440 --> 27:01.840
 about observing. You just look at it and you see what's going on. That was it, right? In quantum

27:01.840 --> 27:08.160
 mechanics, the way we teach it, there's something profoundly fundamental about the act of measurement

27:08.160 --> 27:13.280
 or observation and the system dramatically changes its state. Even though it has a wave

27:13.280 --> 27:17.600
 function, like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle, it's sort of spread out

27:17.600 --> 27:22.720
 in a cloud. When you look at it, you don't see that cloud. When you look at it, it looks like

27:22.720 --> 27:29.040
 a particle with a location. It dramatically changes its state right away. The effects of that change

27:29.040 --> 27:36.480
 can be instantly seen and what the electron does next. Again, we need to be careful because we

27:36.480 --> 27:40.640
 don't agree on what quantum mechanics says. That's why I need to say in the textbook view,

27:40.640 --> 27:46.880
 et cetera. But in the textbook view, quantum mechanics, unlike any other theory of physics,

27:46.880 --> 27:53.760
 places gives a fundamental role to the act of measurement. So maybe even more basic,

27:54.400 --> 28:00.240
 what is an atom and what is an electron? Sure. This all came together in a few years around

28:00.240 --> 28:06.720
 the turn of the last century, right? Around the year 1900. Adams predated then, of course,

28:06.720 --> 28:12.000
 the word atom goes back to the ancient Greeks, but it was the chemists in the 1800s that really

28:12.000 --> 28:18.640
 first got experimental evidence for atoms. They realized that there were two different types

28:18.640 --> 28:25.120
 of tin oxide. In these two different types of tin oxide, there was exactly twice as much oxygen

28:25.120 --> 28:33.680
 in one type as the other. Why is that? Why is it never 1.5 times as much? Dalton said, well,

28:33.680 --> 28:40.160
 it's because there are tin atoms and oxygen atoms and one form of tin oxide is one atom of tin and

28:40.160 --> 28:45.440
 one atom of oxygen, and the other is one atom of tin and two atoms of oxygen. And on the basis of

28:46.720 --> 28:50.960
 speculation, a theory, a hypothesis, but then on the basis of that, you make other predictions.

28:50.960 --> 28:56.080
 The chemists became quickly convinced that atoms were real. The physicists took a lot longer

28:56.080 --> 29:00.640
 to catch on, but eventually they did. I mean, Boltzmann, who believed in atoms,

29:02.240 --> 29:07.040
 he had a really tough time his whole life because he worked in Germany where atoms were not popular.

29:07.040 --> 29:14.320
 They were popular in England, but not in Germany. In general, the idea of atoms is the smallest

29:14.320 --> 29:21.040
 building block of the universe for them. That was the Greek idea, but the chemists in the 1800s

29:21.040 --> 29:26.640
 jumped the gun a little bit. These days, an atom is the smallest building block of a chemical

29:26.640 --> 29:33.120
 element, hydrogen, tin, oxygen, carbon, whatever, but we know that atoms can be broken up further

29:33.120 --> 29:39.280
 than that. And that's what physicists discovered in the early 1900s, Rutherford, especially,

29:39.280 --> 29:44.960
 and his colleagues. So the atom that we think about now, the cartoon is that picture you've

29:44.960 --> 29:50.240
 always seen of a little nucleus and then electrons orbiting it like a little solar system. And we

29:50.240 --> 29:56.160
 now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. So the weight of the atom, the mass,

29:56.160 --> 30:02.320
 is almost all in its nucleus. Protons and neutrons are something like 1800 times as heavy as electrons

30:02.320 --> 30:08.960
 are. Electrons are much lighter, but because they're lighter, they give all the life to the atoms. So

30:08.960 --> 30:13.840
 when atoms get together, combine chemically, when electricity flows through a system, it's all the

30:13.840 --> 30:19.600
 electrons that are doing all the work. And where quantum mechanics steps in, as you mentioned,

30:19.600 --> 30:24.800
 with the position of velocity, with classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics is modeling

30:24.800 --> 30:29.760
 the behavior of the electron. I mean, you can model the behavior of anything, but the electron,

30:29.760 --> 30:34.080
 because that's where the fun is. The electron was the biggest challenge right from the start.

30:34.080 --> 30:41.120
 Yeah. So what's the wave function? You said it's an interesting detail. Yeah. But in any

30:41.120 --> 30:46.400
 interpretation, what is the wave function in quantum mechanics? Well, we had this idea from

30:46.400 --> 30:52.080
 Rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems. But people very quickly realized that

30:52.080 --> 30:57.440
 can't possibly be right. Because if an electron is orbiting in a circle, it will give off light.

30:57.440 --> 31:01.280
 All the light that we have in this room comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling,

31:01.280 --> 31:05.680
 and that's what electromagnetic waves are. And you can calculate how long would it take for the

31:05.680 --> 31:10.400
 electron just to spiral into the nucleus? And the answer is 10 to the minus 11 seconds, okay?

31:10.400 --> 31:17.520
 100 billionth of a second. So that's not right. Meanwhile, people had realized that light, which

31:17.520 --> 31:23.520
 we understood from the 1800s was a wave, had properties that were similar to that of particles,

31:23.520 --> 31:29.840
 right? This is Einstein and Planck and stuff like that. So if something that we agree was a wave

31:30.400 --> 31:35.680
 had particle like properties, then maybe something we think is a particle, the electron,

31:35.680 --> 31:41.520
 has wave like properties, right? And so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion,

31:41.520 --> 31:46.880
 don't think about the electron as a little point particle orbiting like a solar system.

31:46.880 --> 31:51.840
 Think of it as a wave that is spread out. They cleverly gave this the name the wave function,

31:51.840 --> 31:56.000
 which is the dopiest name in the world for one of the most profound things in the universe.

31:57.040 --> 32:03.040
 There's literally a number at every point in space, which is the value of the electron's

32:03.040 --> 32:07.200
 wave function at that point. And there's only one wave function.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.800
 Yeah, they eventually figured that out. That took longer. But when you have two electrons,

32:12.800 --> 32:16.880
 you do not have a wave function for electron one and a wave function for electron two.

32:16.880 --> 32:22.320
 You have one combined wave function for both of them. And indeed, as you say, there's only one

32:22.320 --> 32:29.920
 wave function for the entire universe at once. And that's where this beautiful dance,

32:29.920 --> 32:35.440
 can you say what is entanglement? It seems one of the most fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics.

32:35.440 --> 32:39.760
 Well, let's temporarily buy into the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics. And what

32:39.760 --> 32:45.120
 that says is that this wave function, so it's very small outside the atom, very big in the atom,

32:45.120 --> 32:50.160
 basically the wave function, you take it and you square it, you square the number, that gives you

32:50.160 --> 32:56.240
 the probability of observing the system at that location. So if you say that for two electrons,

32:56.240 --> 33:00.000
 there's only one wave function, and that wave function gives you the probability of observing

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
 both electrons at once doing something. Okay, so maybe the electron can be here or here or here

33:06.000 --> 33:11.120
 and the other electron can also be there. But we have a wave function set up where we don't know

33:11.120 --> 33:15.840
 where either electron is going to be seen. But we know they'll both be seen in the same place.

33:16.720 --> 33:22.080
 Okay, so we don't know exactly what we're going to see for either electron, but there's entanglement

33:22.080 --> 33:27.040
 between the two of them. There's a sort of conditional statement. If we see one in one location,

33:27.040 --> 33:31.520
 then we know the other one's going to be doing a certain thing. So that's a feature of quantum

33:31.520 --> 33:35.360
 mechanics that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics and classical mechanics.

33:35.360 --> 33:39.040
 There's no way I can say, Well, I don't know where either one of these particles is. But if I know,

33:39.040 --> 33:42.080
 if I find out where this one is, then I know where the other one is. That just never happens.

33:42.080 --> 33:46.960
 They're truly separate. And in general, it feels like if you think of a wave function like as a dance

33:46.960 --> 33:53.680
 floor, it seems like entanglement is strongest between things that are dancing together closest.

33:53.680 --> 33:59.520
 So there's a closeness that's important. Well, that's another step. We have to be careful here

33:59.520 --> 34:04.080
 because in principle, if you're talking about the entanglement of two electrons, for example,

34:04.080 --> 34:09.440
 they can be totally entangled or totally unentangled no matter where they are in

34:09.440 --> 34:14.080
 the universe. There's no relationship between the amount of entanglement and the distance

34:14.080 --> 34:20.400
 between two electrons. But we now know that the reality of our best way of understanding

34:20.400 --> 34:24.880
 the world is through quantum fields, not through particles. So even the electron,

34:24.880 --> 34:30.320
 not just gravity and electromagnetism, but even the electron and the quarks and so forth are really

34:30.320 --> 34:37.440
 vibrations in quantum fields. So even empty space is full of vibrating quantum fields.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.800
 And those quantum fields in empty space are entangled with each other in exactly the way

34:42.800 --> 34:46.640
 you just said. If they're nearby, if you have like two vibrating quantum fields that are nearby,

34:46.640 --> 34:50.320
 then they will be highly entangled. If they're far away, they will not be entangled.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.760
 So what do quantum fields in a vacuum look like? Empty space?

34:53.760 --> 34:56.400
 Just like empty space. It's as empty as it can be.

34:56.400 --> 35:02.160
 But they're still a field. It's just... What is nothing...

35:02.160 --> 35:05.840
 Just like right here, this location in space, there's a gravitational field,

35:05.840 --> 35:10.560
 which I can detect by dropping something. I don't see it, but there it is.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.880
 So we got a little bit of an idea of entanglement. Now,

35:19.200 --> 35:23.760
 what is Hilbert space and Euclidean space?

35:23.760 --> 35:28.240
 Yeah, I think that people are very welcome to go through their lives not knowing what

35:28.240 --> 35:32.480
 Hilbert space is. But when I dig into a little bit more into quantum mechanics,

35:32.480 --> 35:37.920
 it becomes necessary. The English language was invented long before quantum mechanics,

35:37.920 --> 35:43.680
 or various forms of higher mathematics were invented. So we use the word space to mean

35:43.680 --> 35:48.000
 different things. Of course, most of us think of space as this three dimensional world in

35:48.000 --> 35:53.360
 which we live. I mean, some of us just think of it as outer space. But space around us,

35:53.360 --> 35:58.720
 it gives us the three dimensional location of things and objects. But mathematicians use any

36:00.720 --> 36:08.560
 generic abstract collection of elements as a space, a space of possibilities, momentum space,

36:08.560 --> 36:14.400
 etc. So Hilbert space is the space of all possible quantum wave functions, either for the universe

36:14.400 --> 36:19.920
 or for some specific system. And it could be an infinite dimensional space, or it could be just

36:19.920 --> 36:23.280
 really, really large dimensional, but finite. We don't know, because we don't know the final

36:23.280 --> 36:28.560
 theory of everything. But this abstract Hilbert space is really, really, really big and has no

36:28.560 --> 36:31.120
 immediate connection to the three dimensional space in which we live.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.560
 What do dimensions in Hilbert space mean?

36:35.280 --> 36:40.640
 It's just a way of mathematically representing how much information is contained in the state

36:40.640 --> 36:45.440
 of the system. How many numbers do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing?

36:45.440 --> 36:51.040
 So in classical mechanics, I give you the location of something by giving you three numbers,

36:51.040 --> 36:58.720
 right? Up, down, X, Y, Z coordinates. But then I might want to give you its entire state, physical

36:58.720 --> 37:04.240
 state, which means both its position and also its velocity. The velocity also has three components.

37:04.240 --> 37:09.760
 So its state lives in something called phase space, which is six dimensional, three dimensions

37:09.760 --> 37:14.720
 of position, three dimensions of velocity. And then if it also has an orientation in space,

37:14.720 --> 37:19.440
 that's another three dimensions and so forth. So as you describe more and more information

37:19.440 --> 37:24.400
 about the system, you have an abstract mathematical space that has more and more

37:24.400 --> 37:28.560
 numbers that you need to give. And each one of those numbers corresponds to a dimension in that

37:28.560 --> 37:36.320
 space. So in terms of the amount of information, what is entropy, this mystical word that's

37:36.320 --> 37:41.920
 overused in math and physics, but has a very specific meaning in this context?

37:41.920 --> 37:46.160
 Sadly, it has more than one very specific meaning. This is this is the reason why it is hard.

37:46.160 --> 37:50.640
 Entropy means different things, even to different physicists. But one way of thinking about it is

37:51.360 --> 37:56.800
 a measure of how much we don't know about the state of the system, right? So if I have a bottle

37:56.800 --> 38:01.280
 of water molecules, and I know that, okay, there's a certain number of water molecules,

38:01.280 --> 38:05.200
 I could weigh it right and figure out, I know the volume of it, and I know the temperature and

38:05.200 --> 38:10.480
 pressure and things like that. I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every

38:10.480 --> 38:14.800
 water molecule, right? So there's a certain amount of information I know, a certain amount that I

38:14.800 --> 38:19.440
 don't know that is that is part of the complete state of the system. And that's what the entropy

38:19.440 --> 38:24.720
 characterizes, how much unknown information there is, the difference between what I do know about

38:24.720 --> 38:31.440
 the system and its full exact microscopic state. So when we try to describe a quantum mechanical

38:31.440 --> 38:38.960
 system, is it infinite or finite, but very large? Yeah, we don't know. That depends on the system.

38:38.960 --> 38:44.320
 You know, it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially

38:44.320 --> 38:49.920
 infinite entropy, an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. So let's go back a little bit.

38:49.920 --> 38:54.960
 We said that the Hilbert space was the space in which quantum wave functions lived for different

38:54.960 --> 39:00.960
 systems that will be different sizes, they could be infinite or finite. So that's the number of

39:00.960 --> 39:05.040
 numbers, the number of pieces of information you could potentially give me about the system. So

39:05.040 --> 39:10.880
 the bigger Hilbert space is, the bigger the entropy of that system could be, depending

39:10.880 --> 39:14.880
 on what I know about it. If I don't know anything about it, then, you know, it has a huge entropy,

39:14.880 --> 39:21.440
 right? But only up to the size of its Hilbert space. So we don't know in the real physical world

39:21.440 --> 39:26.880
 whether or not, you know, this region of space that contains that water bottle has potentially

39:26.880 --> 39:31.360
 an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy. We have different arguments on different sides.

39:31.360 --> 39:36.560
 So if it's infinite, how do you think about infinity? Is this something you can,

39:38.160 --> 39:42.960
 your cognitive abilities are able to process? Or is it just a mathematical tool?

39:43.760 --> 39:48.080
 It's somewhere in between, right? I mean, we can say things about it. We can use mathematical

39:48.080 --> 39:53.440
 tools to manipulate infinity very, very accurately. We can define what we mean, you know, for any

39:53.440 --> 39:58.320
 number n, there's a number bigger than it. So there's no biggest number, right? So there's

39:58.320 --> 40:02.800
 something called the total number of all numbers, and it's infinite. But it is hard to wrap your

40:02.800 --> 40:09.120
 brain around that. And I think that gives people pause because we talk about infinity as if it's

40:09.120 --> 40:13.040
 a number, but it has plenty of properties that real numbers don't have, you know, if you multiply

40:13.040 --> 40:17.520
 infinity by two, you get infinity again, right? That's a little bit different than what we're used to.

40:19.680 --> 40:26.160
 Okay, but are you comfortable with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually is,

40:26.160 --> 40:30.320
 that infinity could be part of that world? Are you comfortable that a world, in some

40:30.320 --> 40:35.520
 dimension, in some aspect? I'm comfortable with lots of things. I mean, you know, I don't want

40:35.520 --> 40:41.360
 my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world. You know, I'm pretty open

40:41.360 --> 40:46.480
 mind about what the world could be at the fundamental level. Yeah, but infinity is a,

40:46.480 --> 40:51.120
 is a tricky one. It's not almost a question of comfort. It's a question of,

40:51.120 --> 40:59.440
 of, is it an overreach of our intuition? Sort of, it could be a convenient, almost like when

40:59.440 --> 41:05.520
 you add a constant to an equation, just because it'll help. It just feels like it's useful to

41:05.520 --> 41:11.920
 at least be able to imagine a concept, not directly, but in some kind of way that this feels

41:11.920 --> 41:17.280
 like it's a description of the real world. Think of it this way. There's only three numbers

41:17.280 --> 41:28.560
 that are simple. There's zero, there's one, and there's infinity. A number like 318 is just bizarre,

41:28.560 --> 41:34.320
 like that, that you need a lot of bits to give me what that number is. But zero and one infinity,

41:34.320 --> 41:37.440
 like once you have 300 things, you might as well have infinity things, right? Otherwise,

41:37.440 --> 41:42.240
 you have to say when to stop, making the things, right? So there's a sense in which infinity is

41:42.240 --> 41:46.400
 a very natural number of things to exist. That was never comfortable with infinity,

41:46.400 --> 41:52.000
 because it's just such a, it was too good to be true, because in math, it just helps

41:53.680 --> 42:00.480
 make things work out. When things get very, it's, when things get very large, close to infinity,

42:00.480 --> 42:06.160
 things seem to work out nicely. It's kind of like, because my deepest passion is probably

42:06.160 --> 42:18.400
 psychology. And I'm uncomfortable how in the average, the beauty of how much we vary is lost.

42:18.400 --> 42:24.080
 In that same kind of sense, infinity seems like a convenient way to erase the details.

42:24.080 --> 42:30.000
 But the thing about infinity is it seems to pop up whether we like it or not, right? Like you're

42:30.000 --> 42:33.120
 trying to be a computer scientist, you ask yourself, well, how long will it take this

42:33.120 --> 42:37.200
 program to run? And you realize, well, for some of them, the answer is infinitely long.

42:37.200 --> 42:42.320
 It's not because you tried to get there, you wrote a five line computer program, it doesn't halt.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.920
 So coming back to the textbook definition of quantum mechanics, this idea that we,

42:47.920 --> 42:55.120
 I don't think we talked about, can you, this, one of the most interesting philosophical points,

42:55.120 --> 43:01.520
 we talked at the human level, but at the, at the physics level, that at least the textbook

43:01.520 --> 43:09.680
 definition of quantum mechanics separates what is observed and what is real. One, how does that

43:09.680 --> 43:18.640
 make you feel? And, and two, what does it then mean to observe something? And why is it different

43:18.640 --> 43:26.800
 than what is real? Yeah, you know, I, my personal feelings, such as it is, is that things like

43:26.800 --> 43:31.680
 measurement and observers and stuff like that are not going to play a fundamental role in the

43:31.680 --> 43:36.960
 ultimate laws of physics. But my feeling that way is because so far, that's where all the evidence

43:36.960 --> 43:42.880
 has been pointing. I could be wrong. And there's certainly a sense in which it would be infinitely

43:42.880 --> 43:50.720
 cool if somehow observation or mental cogitation did play a fundamental role in the, in the nature

43:50.720 --> 43:55.200
 of reality. But I don't think so. And I don't see any evidence for it. So I'm not spending a lot of

43:55.200 --> 44:00.240
 time worrying about that possibility. So what do you do about the fact that in the textbook

44:00.240 --> 44:06.080
 interpretation of quantum mechanics, this idea of measurement or, or looking at things seems to

44:06.080 --> 44:11.040
 play an important role? Well, you, you come up with better interpretations of quantum mechanics.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.400
 And there are several alternatives. My favorite is the many worlds interpretation,

44:15.040 --> 44:21.760
 which says two things. Number one, you, the observer, are just a quantum system like anything

44:21.760 --> 44:25.760
 else. There's nothing special about you. Don't get so proud of yourself. You know, you're just a

44:25.760 --> 44:31.040
 bunch of atoms. You have a wave function. You obey the Schrodinger equation like everything else.

44:31.040 --> 44:35.920
 And number two, when you think you're measuring something or observing something, what's really

44:35.920 --> 44:42.000
 happening is you're becoming entangled with that thing. So when you think there's a wave function

44:42.000 --> 44:46.400
 for the electron, it's all spread out, but you look at it and you only see it in one location.

44:46.400 --> 44:50.160
 What's really happening is that there's still the wave function for the electron in all those

44:50.160 --> 44:55.680
 locations, but now it's entangled with the wave function of you in the following way.

44:55.680 --> 45:00.080
 There's part of the wave function that says the electron was here and you think you saw it there.

45:00.080 --> 45:03.520
 The electron was there and you think you saw it there. The electron was over there and you

45:03.520 --> 45:08.160
 think you saw it there, et cetera. So, and all of those different parts of the wave function,

45:08.160 --> 45:13.200
 once they come into being, no longer talk to each other. They no longer interact or influence

45:13.200 --> 45:18.720
 each other. It says if they are separate worlds. So this was the invention of Hugh Everett,

45:18.720 --> 45:23.840
 the third who was a graduate student at Princeton in the 1950s. And he said, basically, look,

45:24.640 --> 45:29.280
 you don't need all these extra rules about looking at things. Just listen to what the

45:29.280 --> 45:33.680
 Schrodinger equation is telling you. It's telling you that you have a wave function that you become

45:33.680 --> 45:39.200
 entangled and that the different versions of you no longer talk to each other. So just accept it.

45:39.200 --> 45:44.160
 It's just he did therapy more than anything else. He said, it's okay. You don't need all these extra

45:44.160 --> 45:48.560
 rules. All you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation. The cost is there's a whole bunch of

45:48.560 --> 45:56.080
 extra worlds out there. So the world's being created, whether there's an observer or not.

45:57.120 --> 46:01.680
 The world's created any time a quantum system that's in a superposition becomes entangled with the

46:01.680 --> 46:09.600
 outside world. What's the outside world? It depends. Let's back up. Whatever it really says,

46:09.600 --> 46:15.120
 what his theory is, is there's a wave function of the universe and it obeys the Schrodinger

46:15.120 --> 46:22.720
 equation all the time. That's it. That's the full theory right there. The question, all of the work

46:22.720 --> 46:30.160
 is how in the world do you map that theory onto reality, onto what we observe? So part of it is

46:30.160 --> 46:34.480
 carving up the wave function into these separate worlds saying, look, it describes a whole bunch

46:34.480 --> 46:38.640
 of things that don't interact with each other. Let's call them separate worlds. Another part

46:38.640 --> 46:43.360
 is distinguishing between systems and their environments. The environment is basically

46:43.360 --> 46:46.880
 all the degrees of freedom, all the things going on in the world that you don't keep

46:46.880 --> 46:52.640
 track of. So again, in the bottle of water, I might keep track of the total amount of water

46:52.640 --> 46:57.360
 and the volume. I don't keep track of the individual positions and velocities. I don't

46:57.360 --> 47:02.080
 keep track of all the photons or the air molecules in this room. So that's the outside world. The

47:02.080 --> 47:06.720
 outside world is all the parts of the universe that you're not keeping track of when you're asking

47:06.720 --> 47:13.760
 about the behavior of subsystem of it. So how many worlds are there?

47:14.720 --> 47:19.520
 Yeah, we don't know that one either. There could be an infinite number. There could be only a finite

47:19.520 --> 47:24.320
 number, but it's a big number one way or the other. It's just a very, very big number. In one of the

47:24.320 --> 47:34.720
 talks, somebody asked, well, if it's finite. So actually, I'm not sure exactly the logic you

47:34.720 --> 47:46.720
 used to derive this, but is there going to be overlap, a duplicate world that you return to?

47:47.280 --> 47:52.240
 So you've mentioned, and I'd love if you can elaborate on the idea that it's possible that

47:52.240 --> 47:57.040
 there's some kind of equilibrium that these splitting worlds arrive at. And then maybe

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
 over time, maybe somehow connected to entropy, you get a large number of worlds that are very

48:04.000 --> 48:10.080
 similar to each other. Yeah. So this question of whether or not Hilbert space is finite or

48:10.080 --> 48:16.720
 infinite dimensional is actually secretly connected to gravity and cosmology. This is the

48:16.720 --> 48:20.480
 part that we're still struggling to understand right now. But we discovered back in 1998 that

48:20.480 --> 48:25.920
 our universe is accelerating. And what that means if it continues, which we think it probably will,

48:25.920 --> 48:31.280
 but we're not sure. But if it does, that means there's a horizon around us. There's because

48:31.280 --> 48:35.600
 the universe not only expanding, but expanding faster and faster, things can get so far away

48:35.600 --> 48:40.800
 from us that from our perspective, it looks like they're moving away faster than the speed of light.

48:40.800 --> 48:44.800
 We will never see them again. So there's literally a horizon around us. And that horizon

48:45.360 --> 48:51.600
 approaches some fixed distance away from us. And you can then argue that within that horizon,

48:51.600 --> 48:55.600
 there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen, the finite dimensional Hilbert

48:55.600 --> 49:01.920
 space. In fact, we even have a guess for what the dimensionality is. It's 10 to the power of 10 to

49:01.920 --> 49:08.160
 the power of 122. That's a very large number. Yeah. Just to compare it, the age of the universe

49:08.160 --> 49:14.000
 is something like 10 to the 14 seconds, 10 to the 17 or 18 seconds, maybe the number of particles

49:14.000 --> 49:19.680
 in the universe is 10 to the 88. But the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the 10

49:19.680 --> 49:26.720
 to the 122. So that's just crazy. If that story is right, that in our observable horizon, there's

49:26.720 --> 49:32.000
 only a finite dimensional Hilbert space, then this idea of branching of the wave function of

49:32.000 --> 49:37.680
 the universe into multiple distinct separate branches has to reach a limit at some time. Once

49:37.680 --> 49:43.520
 you branch that many times, you run out of room in Hilbert space. And roughly speaking, that corresponds

49:43.520 --> 49:49.120
 to the universe just expanding and emptying out and cooling off and entering a phase where it's

49:49.120 --> 49:57.360
 just empty space, literally forever. What's the difference between splitting and copying,

49:57.360 --> 50:10.000
 do you think? A lot of this is an interpretation that helps us model the world. So perhaps shouldn't

50:10.000 --> 50:20.400
 be thought of as philosophically or metaphysically. But even at the physics level, do you see a

50:20.400 --> 50:28.080
 difference between generating new copies of the world or splitting? I think it's better to think

50:28.080 --> 50:33.200
 of in quantum mechanics, in many worlds, the universe splits rather than new copies because

50:33.200 --> 50:38.240
 people otherwise worry about things like energy conservation. And no one who understands quantum

50:38.240 --> 50:42.800
 mechanics worries about energy conservation because the equation is perfectly clear. But if all you

50:42.800 --> 50:46.320
 know is that someone told you the universe duplicates, then you have a reasonable worry about where

50:46.320 --> 50:52.640
 all the energy for that came from. So a preexisting universe splitting into two skinnier universes

50:52.640 --> 50:56.560
 is a better way of thinking about it. And mathematically, it's just like if you draw an

50:56.560 --> 51:03.520
 x and y axis, and you draw a vector of length one at 45 degree angle, you know that you can write

51:03.520 --> 51:10.000
 that vector of length one as the sum of two vectors pointing along x and y of length one over the

51:10.000 --> 51:15.920
 square root of two. So I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows. But there's a conservation of

51:15.920 --> 51:21.200
 arrowness. There's now two arrows, but the length is the same. I'm just describing it in a different

51:21.200 --> 51:25.280
 way. And that's exactly what happens when the universe branches. The wave function of the

51:25.280 --> 51:32.480
 universe is a big old vector. So to somebody who brings up a question of saying, doesn't this violate

51:32.480 --> 51:38.080
 the conservation of energy? Can you give further elaboration?

51:38.080 --> 51:44.720
 Right. So let's just be super duper perfectly clear. There's zero question about whether or not many

51:44.720 --> 51:49.920
 worlds violates conservation of energy. It does not. And I say this definitively because there

51:49.920 --> 51:54.720
 are other questions that I think there's answers to, but they're legitimate questions about where

51:54.720 --> 51:58.800
 does probability come from and things like that. This conservation of energy question,

51:58.800 --> 52:03.920
 we know the answer to it. And the answer to it is that energy is conserved. All of the effort goes

52:03.920 --> 52:11.200
 into how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into plain English. So this

52:11.200 --> 52:16.160
 idea that there's a universe that the universe comes equipped with a thickness and it sort of

52:16.160 --> 52:22.400
 divides up into thinner pieces, but the total amount of universe is conserved over time is a

52:22.400 --> 52:27.200
 reasonably good way of putting English words to the underlying mathematics.

52:27.200 --> 52:34.000
 So one of my favorite things about many worlds is, I mean, I love that there's something controversial

52:34.000 --> 52:41.600
 in science. And for some reason, it makes people actually not like upset, but just get excited.

52:41.600 --> 52:49.040
 Why do you think it is a controversial idea? So there's a lot of, it's actually one of the cleanest

52:50.160 --> 52:56.000
 ways to think about quantum mechanics. So why do you think there's a discomfort a little bit

52:56.000 --> 53:01.200
 among certain people? Well, I draw the distinction in my book between two different kinds of

53:01.200 --> 53:07.120
 simplicity in a physical theory. There's simplicity in the theory itself, right? How we describe what's

53:07.120 --> 53:11.600
 going on according to the theory by its own rights. But then, you know, theory is just some sort of

53:11.600 --> 53:17.920
 abstract mathematical formalism. You have to map it onto the world somehow, right? And sometimes,

53:17.920 --> 53:24.000
 like for Newtonian physics, it's pretty obvious, like, okay, here is a bottle and it has a center

53:24.000 --> 53:28.800
 of mass and things like that. Sometimes it's a little bit harder with general relativity,

53:28.800 --> 53:34.800
 curvature of space time is a little bit harder to grasp. Quantum mechanics is very hard to map

53:35.600 --> 53:40.240
 what you're the language you're talking in a wave functions and things like that onto reality.

53:40.240 --> 53:45.280
 And many worlds is the version of quantum mechanics where it is hardest to map on the

53:45.280 --> 53:52.000
 underlying formalism to reality. So that's where the lack of simplicity comes in, not in the theory,

53:52.000 --> 53:57.680
 but in how we use the theory to map onto reality. And in fact, all of the work in sort of elaborating

53:58.640 --> 54:04.960
 many worlds quantum mechanics is in this effort to map it on to the world that we see. So it's

54:04.960 --> 54:11.360
 perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that, right? To say, like, well, no, that's just too far away

54:11.360 --> 54:17.280
 from my experience. I am therefore intrinsically skeptical of it. Of course, you should give up

54:17.280 --> 54:20.880
 on that skepticism if there are no alternatives and this theory always keeps working, then

54:20.880 --> 54:26.560
 eventually you should overcome your skepticism. But right now there are alternatives that people

54:26.560 --> 54:31.520
 work to make alternatives that are by their nature closer to what we observe directly.

54:31.520 --> 54:36.560
 Can you describe the alternatives? I don't think we touched on it. So the Copenhagen interpretation

54:37.360 --> 54:43.200
 and the many worlds, maybe there's a difference between the Everettian

54:44.000 --> 54:50.080
 many worlds and many worlds as it is now, like has the idea sort of developed and so on. And just

54:50.080 --> 54:55.680
 in general, what is the space of promising contenders? We have democratic debates now,

54:55.680 --> 55:00.160
 there's a bunch of candidates, 12 candidates, 12 candidates on stage. What are the quantum

55:00.160 --> 55:06.320
 mechanical candidates on stage for the debate? So if you had a debate between quantum mechanical

55:06.320 --> 55:10.880
 contenders, there'd be no problem getting 12 people up there on stage, but there would still be

55:10.880 --> 55:17.840
 only three front runners. And right now the front runners would be Everett. Hidden variable

55:17.840 --> 55:22.240
 theories are another one. So the hidden variable theories say that the wave function is real,

55:22.880 --> 55:26.960
 but there's something in addition to the wave function. The wave function is not everything,

55:26.960 --> 55:32.960
 it's part of reality, but it's not everything. What else is there? We're not sure. But in the

55:32.960 --> 55:38.000
 simplest version of the theory, there are literally particles. So many worlds says that

55:38.880 --> 55:44.480
 quantum systems are sometimes are wave like in some ways and particle like in another because

55:44.480 --> 55:49.280
 they really, really are waves. But under certain observational circumstances, they look like

55:49.280 --> 55:54.720
 particles. Whereas hidden variable says that they look like waves and particles because there are

55:54.720 --> 56:01.040
 both waves and particles involved in the dynamics. And that's easy to do if your particles are just

56:01.040 --> 56:06.400
 non relativistic, Newtonian particles moving around, they get pushed around by the wave function

56:06.400 --> 56:12.160
 roughly. It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into

56:12.160 --> 56:19.440
 account. The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories. So in the conventional textbook

56:19.440 --> 56:24.080
 interpretation, we say when you look at a quantum system, its wave function collapses and you see

56:24.080 --> 56:33.360
 it in one location. A spontaneous collapse theory says that every particle has a chance per second

56:33.360 --> 56:38.480
 of having its wave function spontaneously collapse. The chance is very small for a typical particle

56:38.480 --> 56:42.800
 will take hundreds of millions of years before it happens even once. But in a table or some

56:42.800 --> 56:47.440
 macroscopic object, there are way more than 100 million particles. And they're all entangled

56:47.440 --> 56:51.280
 with each other. So when one of them collapses, it brings everything else along with it.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.920
 There's a slight variation of this. That's a spontaneous collapse theory. There are also

56:55.920 --> 57:00.560
 induced collapse theories like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational difference

57:00.560 --> 57:06.640
 between two parts of the wave function becomes too large, the wave function collapses automatically.

57:06.640 --> 57:11.600
 So those are basically, in my mind, the three big alternatives. Many worlds, which is just

57:11.600 --> 57:15.760
 there's a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation. Hidden variables,

57:15.760 --> 57:19.040
 there's a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation. But there are also new

57:19.040 --> 57:24.880
 variables or collapse theories, which the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger equation

57:24.880 --> 57:29.200
 and sometimes it collapses. So you can see that the alternatives are more complicated in their

57:29.200 --> 57:35.760
 formalism than many worlds is, but they are closer to our experience. So just this moment of

57:35.760 --> 57:44.240
 collapse, do you think of it as a wave function fundamentally sort of a probabilistic description

57:44.240 --> 57:51.200
 of the world? And it's collapse sort of reducing that part of the world into something deterministic,

57:51.200 --> 57:56.400
 where again, you can now describe the position and the velocity in this simple classical model?

57:56.400 --> 57:58.720
 Well, there is... Is that how you think about collapse?

57:58.720 --> 58:02.720
 There is a fourth category, is a fourth contender, there's a mayor Pete of

58:02.720 --> 58:07.920
 quantum mechanical interpretations, which are called epistemic interpretations.

58:07.920 --> 58:13.200
 And what they say is, all the wave function is a way of making predictions for experimental

58:13.200 --> 58:19.440
 outcomes. It's not mapping onto an element of reality in any real sense. And in fact,

58:19.440 --> 58:22.960
 two different people might have two different wave functions for the same physical system,

58:22.960 --> 58:26.880
 because they know different things about it, right? The wave function is really just a prediction

58:26.880 --> 58:32.160
 mechanism. And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is if you say, okay,

58:32.160 --> 58:38.400
 but it's predicting about what? Like, what is the thing that is being predicted? And I say,

58:38.400 --> 58:42.960
 no, no, no. That's not what we're here for. We're just here to tell you what the observational

58:42.960 --> 58:47.200
 outcomes are going to be. But the other interpretations kind of think that the wave

58:47.200 --> 58:54.400
 function is real. Yes. That's right. So that's an on tick interpretation of the wave function,

58:54.400 --> 58:58.800
 ontology being the study of what is real, what exists, as opposed to an epistemic

58:58.800 --> 59:02.240
 interpretation of the wave function, epistemology being the study of what we know.

59:02.240 --> 59:05.520
 I would actually just love to see that debate on stage.

59:06.320 --> 59:09.600
 There was a version of it on stage at the World Science Festival a few years ago,

59:10.160 --> 59:12.000
 that you can look up online. And on YouTube?

59:12.000 --> 59:13.280
 Yep. It's on YouTube.

59:13.280 --> 59:15.840
 Okay, awesome. I'll link it and watch it.

 For one.

59:44.480 --> 59:44.800
 For one.

59:44.800 --> 59:50.960
 right? It's like the most bare bones austere pure version of quantum mechanics. And I am someone

59:50.960 --> 59:56.200
 who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto reality. I'm less

59:56.200 --> 1:00:01.080
 willing to complicate the formalism itself. But the other big reason is that there's something

1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:07.080
 called modern physics with quantum fields and quantum gravity and holography and space time

1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:13.520
 doing things like that. And when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory, they bring

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:20.520
 along classical baggage, all of the other versions of quantum mechanics, prejudice or privilege,

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:27.800
 some version of classical reality like locations in space. Okay. And I think that that's a barrier

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:32.480
 to doing better and understanding the theory of everything and understanding quantum gravity in

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:37.680
 the versions of space time. Whenever if you change your theory from, you know, here's a harmonic

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:42.560
 oscillator. Oh, there's a spin. Here's an electromagnetic field in hidden variable theories

1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:45.760
 or dynamical collapse theories. You have to start from scratch. You have to say like, well,

1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:49.360
 what are the hidden variables for this theory? Or how does it collapse or whatever? Whereas

1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:53.240
 many worlds is plug and play. You tell me the theory and I can give you its many worlds version.

1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:58.960
 So when we have a situation like we have with gravity and space time, where the classical

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:04.360
 description seems to break down in a dramatic way, then I think you should start from the most

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.800
 quantum theory that you have, which is really many worlds. So start with the quantum theory and

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:19.760
 try to build up a model of space time, the emergence of space time. Okay, so I thought space

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:25.560
 time was fundamental. Yeah, I know. So this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:32.920
 and everybody has of, you know, the theory of everything. So how do we build up from many

1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:39.840
 worlds, from quantum mechanics, a model of space time, a model of gravity? Well, yeah, I mean,

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:45.040
 let me first mention very quickly why we think it's necessary. You know, we've had gravity in

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:50.440
 the form that Einstein bequeathed to us for over 100 years now, like 1915 or 1916, he put general

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:56.080
 relativity in the final form. So gravity is the curvature of space time. And there's a field that

1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:00.920
 pervades all the universe that tells us how curved space time is. And that's a fundamentally

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:06.920
 classical. That's totally classical, right? Exactly. But we also have a formalism, an

1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:12.040
 algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing it. This is how we get quantum

1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:16.440
 electrodynamics, for example. And it could be tricky. I mean, you could you think you're

1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:20.600
 quantizing some things that that means taking a classical theory and promoting it to a quantum

1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:25.560
 mechanical theory. But you can run into problems. So they ran into problems and they did that with

1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:29.840
 electromagnetism, namely that certain quantities were infinity, and you don't like infinity,

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:35.200
 right? So Feynman and Tom Monaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize for teaching us how to deal

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.880
 with the infinities. And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn't

1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:43.360
 have been worried about those infinities after all. But still, that was the it's always the

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.400
 thought that that's how you will make a good quantum theory, you'll start with classical

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:51.200
 theory and quantize it. So if we have a classical theory, general relativity, we can quantize it

1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:56.720
 or we can try to. But we run into even bigger problems with gravity than we ran into with

1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:01.120
 electromagnetism. And so far, those problems are insurmountable. We've not been able to get a

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:06.080
 successful theory of gravity, quantum gravity by starting with classical general relativity

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:10.800
 and quantizing it. And there's evidence that there's a good reason why this is true, that

1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:18.000
 whatever the quantum theory of gravity is, it's not a field theory. It's something that has

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.760
 weird non local features built into it somehow that we don't understand. We get this idea from

1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:28.400
 black holes and Hawking radiation and information conservation and a whole bunch of other ideas

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:33.600
 I talked about in the book. So if that's true, if the fundamental theory isn't even local in

1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:37.840
 the sense that an ordinary quantum field theory would be, then we just don't know where to start

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:43.840
 in terms of getting a classical precursor and quantizing it. So the only sensible thing,

1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.920
 at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be to say, okay, let's just start intrinsically

1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.880
 quantum and work backwards, see if we can find a classical limit. So the idea of locality,

1:03:52.880 --> 1:04:02.240
 the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our existence, sort of,

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:07.200
 you know, I guess in that sense, modeling everything as a field makes sense to me,

1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:14.000
 stuff that's close by, interacts, stuff that's far away doesn't. So what's locality and why is

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.800
 it not fundamental? And how's that even possible? Yeah, I mean, locality is the answer to the

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:22.640
 question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in the beginning of our conversation, right? I

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:28.880
 mean, how can the earth know what the gravitational field of the sun is? And the answer, as spelled

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:33.920
 out by Laplace, Einstein and others, is that there's a field in between. And the way a field works is

1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:39.840
 that what's happening to the field at this point in space only depends directly on what's happening

1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:44.320
 at points right next to it. But what's happening at those points depends on what's happening right

1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:49.680
 next to those, right? And so you can build up an influence across space through only local

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:53.680
 interactions. That's what locality means. What happens here is only affected by what's happening

1:04:53.680 --> 1:05:00.000
 right next to it. That's locality. The idea of locality is built into every field theory,

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:05.520
 including general relativity as a classical theory. It seems to break down when we talk about black

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:10.480
 holes. And, you know, Hawking taught us in the 1970s that black holes radiate, they give off,

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:14.960
 they eventually evaporate away, they're not completely black once we take quantum mechanics

1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:22.880
 into account. And we think, we don't know for sure, but most of us think that if you make a black hole

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.480
 out of certain stuff, then like Laplace's demon taught us, you should be able to predict what

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:33.440
 that black hole will turn into if it's just obeying the Schrodinger equation. And if that's true,

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:38.640
 there are good arguments that can't happen while preserving locality at the same time.

1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:43.920
 It's just that the information seems to be spread out nonlocally in interesting ways.

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:49.520
 And people should, you talk about Holography with the Leonard Susskind on your Mindscape podcast.

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:52.800
 Oh, yes, I have a podcast. I didn't even mention that. I'm terrible.

1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:56.640
 No, I'm going to, I'm going to ask you questions about that too. And I've been

1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:01.600
 not shutting up about, it's my favorite science podcast. So, or not, it's a, it's not even a

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:07.920
 science podcast. It's like, it's a scientist doing a podcast. That's what it is. Absolutely. Yes.

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:12.800
 Yeah. Anyway, yeah. So, Holography is this idea when you have a black hole and black hole is a

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:17.920
 region of space inside of which gravity is so strong that you can't escape. And there's this

1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:22.480
 weird feature of black holes that, again, is a totally thought experiment feature because we

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:28.080
 haven't gone and probed any yet. But there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens

1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:33.600
 inside a black hole, as seen by an observer who's falling in, which is actually pretty normal. Like

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:38.160
 everything looks pretty normal until you hit the singularity and you die. But from the point of the

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:44.240
 view of the outside observer, it seems like all the information that fell in is actually smeared

1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:50.160
 over the horizon in a nonlocal way. And that's puzzling. And that's so Holography because

1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:53.600
 that's a two dimensional surface that is encapsulating the whole three dimensional thing

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:57.840
 inside, right? Still trying to deal with that. Still trying to figure out how to get there.

1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:01.920
 But it's an indication that we need to think a little bit more subtly when we quantize gravity.

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:07.440
 So, because you can describe everything that's going on in the three dimensional space by

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:15.120
 looking at the two dimensional projection of it, it means that locality is not necessary.

1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:20.160
 Well, it means that somehow it's only a good approximation. It's not really what's going on.

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:23.760
 How are we supposed to feel about that? It's supposed to feel liberated.

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:29.680
 You know, space is just a good approximation. And this was always going to be true once you

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:36.400
 started quantizing gravity. So, we're just beginning now to face up to the dramatic

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:40.800
 implications of quantizing gravity. Is there other weird stuff that happens

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:46.160
 to quantum mechanics in black hole? I don't think that anything weirds happen

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:49.520
 with quantum mechanics. Weird things happen with space time. I mean, that's what it is.

1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:53.680
 Like quantum mechanics is still just quantum mechanics. But our ordinary notions of space

1:07:53.680 --> 1:08:01.360
 time don't really quite work. And there's a principle that goes hand in hand with

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:09.200
 holography called complementarity, which says that there's no one unique way to describe

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:13.040
 what's going on inside a black hole. Different observers will have different descriptions,

1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:18.880
 both of which are accurate, but sound completely incompatible with each other. So,

1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:22.480
 it depends on how you look at it. You know, the word complementarity in this context is

1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:27.200
 borrowed from Niels Bohr, who points out you can measure the position or you can measure the

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:31.680
 momentum. You can't measure both at the same time in quantum mechanics.

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:38.240
 So, a couple of questions on many worlds. How does many worlds help us understand our particular

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:43.520
 branch of reality? So, okay, that's fine and good that is everything is splitting,

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:49.280
 but we're just traveling down a single branch of it. So, how does it help us understand our

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:54.080
 little unique branch? Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. But that's the point is that

1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:57.360
 we didn't invent many worlds because we thought it was cool to have a whole bunch of worlds,

1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:02.240
 right? We invented it because we were trying to account for what we observe here in our world.

1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:09.440
 And what we observe here in our world are wave functions collapsing, okay? We do have a situation

1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.040
 where the electron seems to be spread out, but then when we look at it, we don't see it spread

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.960
 out. We see it located somewhere. So, what's going on? That's the measurement problem of

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:22.000
 quantum mechanics. That's what we have to face up to. So, many worlds is just a proposed solution

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.240
 to that problem. And the answer is nothing special is happening. It's still just the

1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:31.200
 Schrodinger equation, but you have a wave function too. And that's a different answer than would

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:37.600
 be given in hidden variables or dynamical collapse theories or whatever. So, the entire point of

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:42.720
 many worlds is to explain what we observe. But it tries to explain what we already have

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:48.080
 observed, right? It's not trying to be different from what we've observed because that would be

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:53.280
 something other than quantum mechanics. But the idea that there's worlds that we didn't observe

1:09:53.280 --> 1:10:02.320
 that keep branching off is kind of stimulating to the imagination. So, is it possible to hop

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:10.080
 from, you mentioned the branches are independent. Is it possible to hop from one to the other?

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:16.000
 No. So, it's a physical limit. The theory says it's impossible.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.440
 There's already a copy of you in the other world, don't worry. Yes. Then leave them alone.

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:29.360
 No, but there's a fear of missing out, FOMO. Yes. That I feel like immediately start to wonder if

1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:35.120
 that other copy is having more or less fun. Yeah. Well, the downside to many worlds is that you're

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:41.280
 missing out on an enormous amount. And that's always what it's going to be like. And I mean,

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:47.200
 there's a certain stage of acceptance in that. Yes. In terms of rewinding, do you think we can

1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:53.760
 rewind the system back? Sort of the nice thing about many worlds, I guess, is it really emphasizes

1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:02.720
 the, maybe you can correct me, but the deterministic nature of a branch. And it feels like it could

1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:12.640
 be rewind back. Do you see this as something that could be perfectly rewinded back? Yeah.

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:17.360
 If you're at a fancy French restaurant and there's a nice linen white tablecloth and you have your

1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:22.960
 glass of Bordeaux and you knock it over and the wine spills across the tablecloth. If the world

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:29.920
 were classical, it would be possible that if you just lifted the wine glass up, you'd be lucky enough

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:34.960
 that every molecule of wine would hop back into the glass, right? But guess what? It's not going

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:40.800
 to happen in the real world. And the quantum wave function is exactly the same way. It is possible

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:45.360
 in principle to rewind everything if you start from perfect knowledge of the entire wave function

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:53.120
 of the universe. In practice, it's never going to happen. So time travel, not possible. Nope.

1:11:53.120 --> 1:12:01.680
 At least quantum mechanics has no help. What about memory? Does the universe have a memory

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:11.680
 of itself where we could not time travel, but peek back in time and do a little like replay?

1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:18.640
 Well, it's exactly the same in quantum mechanics as classical mechanics. So whatever you want to

1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:24.480
 say about that, the fundamental laws of physics in either many worlds, quantum mechanics or Newtonian

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:31.040
 physics, conserve information. So if you have all the information about the quantum state of the

1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:36.400
 world right now, your Laplace's demon like and your knowledge and calculational capacity,

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:41.920
 you can wind the clock backward. But none of us is, right? And so in practice, you can never do

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:46.160
 that. You can do experiments over and over again starting from the same initial conditions for

1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:51.760
 small systems. But once things get to be large, Avogadro's number of particles, right, bigger

1:12:51.760 --> 1:13:00.320
 than a cell, no chance. We talked a little bit about era of time last time, but in many worlds

1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:10.080
 that there is a kind of implied era of time, right? So you've talked about the era of time that has

1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:18.080
 to do with the second law of thermodynamics. That's the era of time that's emergent or fundamental.

1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:24.640
 We don't know, I guess. No, it's emergent. Is everyone agree on that? Well, nobody agrees with

1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:32.320
 everything. They should. So that era of time, is that different than the era of time that's implied

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:38.960
 by many worlds? It's not different actually, no. In both cases, you have fundamental laws of physics

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.440
 that are completely reversible. If you give me the state of the universe at one moment in time,

1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:48.400
 I can run the clock forward or backward equally well. There's no arrow of time built into the

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:55.040
 laws of physics at the most fundamental level. But what we do have are special initial conditions

1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:00.320
 14 billion years ago near the Big Bang. In thermodynamics, those special initial conditions

1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:05.360
 take the form of things where low entropy and entropy has been increasing ever since,

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:09.520
 making the universe more disorganized and chaotic, and that's the era of time.

1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:15.040
 In quantum mechanics, the special initial conditions take the form of there was only

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:19.120
 one branch of the wave function, and the universe has been branching more and more ever since.

1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:28.960
 Okay, so if time is emergent, so it seems like our human cognitive capacity likes to take things

1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:41.920
 that are emergent and feel like they're fundamental. So if time is emergent, and locality is space

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:46.560
 emergent? Yes. Okay. But I didn't say time was emergent. I said the arrow of time was emergent.

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:53.120
 Those are different. What's the difference between the arrow of time and time? Are you using

1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:57.920
 arrow of time to simply mean that they're synonymous with the second law of thermodynamics?

1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:03.120
 No, but the arrow of time is the difference between the past and future. So there's space,

1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:07.200
 but there's no arrow of space. You don't feel that space has to have an arrow, right? You could

1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:11.600
 live in thermodynamic equilibrium. There'd be no arrow of time, but there'd still be time. There'd

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.200
 still be a difference between now and the future or whatever. Okay, so if nothing changes, there's

1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:23.200
 still time? Well, things could even change. Like if the whole universe consisted of the

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:28.240
 earth going around the sun, okay? It would just go in circles or ellipses, right?

1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:33.360
 Things would change, but it's not increasing entropy. There's no arrow. If you took a movie

1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:36.240
 of that and I played you the movie backward, you would never know.

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:45.040
 So the arrow of time can theoretically point in the other direction for briefly?

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:49.280
 To the extent that it points in different directions, it's not a very good arrow. I mean,

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:54.800
 the arrow of time in the macroscopic world is so powerful that there's just no chance of going back.

1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:59.120
 When you get down to tiny systems with only three or four moving parts, then entropy can fluctuate

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:04.400
 up and down. What does it mean for space to be an emergent phenomena? It means that the fundamental

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:08.800
 description of the world does not include the word space. It'll be something like a vector in

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:13.440
 Hilbert space, right? And you have to say, well, why is there a good approximate description

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:19.200
 in which involves three dimensional space and stuff inside it? Okay, so time and space are

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:27.120
 emergent. We kind of mentioned in the beginning, can you elaborate what do you feel hope is

1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:32.400
 fundamental in our universe? A wave function living in Hilbert space?

1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:36.800
 A wave function in Hilbert space, that we can't intellectualize or visualize really.

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:39.840
 We can't visualize it. We can intellectualize it very easily.

1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:45.040
 Like, well, how do you think about? It's a vector in a 10 to the 10 to the 122 dimensional vector

1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:49.840
 space. It's a complex vector, unit norm, it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.

1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:54.480
 Got it. When you put it that way. What's so hard, really?

1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:05.440
 Yeah, quantum computers, there's some excitement, actually a lot of excitement with people

1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:12.000
 that it will allow us to simulate quantum mechanical systems. What kind of questions do

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:16.080
 about quantum mechanics, about the things we've been talking about? Do you think,

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:19.520
 do you hope we can answer through quantum simulation?

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:26.800
 Well, I think that there's a whole fascinating frontier of things you can do with quantum

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:33.440
 computers, both sort of practical things with cryptography or money, privacy eavesdropping,

1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:43.040
 sorting things, simulating quantum systems. It's a broader question, maybe even outside

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:48.080
 of quantum computers. Some of the theories that we've been talking about, what's your hope?

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:54.960
 What's most promising to test these theories? What are experiments we can conduct,

1:17:54.960 --> 1:18:02.160
 whether in simulation or in the physical world, that would validate or disprove or expand these

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:08.160
 theories? Well, I think there's two parts of that question. One is many worlds and the other one is

1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:13.360
 sort of emergent space time. For many worlds, there are experiments ongoing to test whether

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.360
 or not wave functions spontaneously collapse. And if they do, then that rules out many worlds

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:26.240
 and that would be falsified. If there are hidden variables, there's a theorem that seems to indicate

1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:30.800
 that the predictions will always be the same as many worlds. I'm a little skeptical of this

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:35.680
 theorem. I haven't internalized it. I haven't made it in part of my intuitive view of the world yet.

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:39.520
 So there might be loopholes to that theorem. I'm not sure about that. Part of me thinks that

1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:43.280
 there should be different experimental predictions if there are hidden variables, but I'm not sure.

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:49.840
 But otherwise, it's just quantum mechanics all the way down. And so there's this cottage industry

1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:55.440
 in science journalism of writing breathless articles that say quantum mechanics shown to be

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:59.280
 more astonishing than ever before thought. And really, it's the same quantum mechanics we've

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:05.200
 been doing since 1926. Whereas with the emergent space time stuff, we know a lot less about what

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:11.840
 the theory is. It's in a very primitive state. We don't even really have a safely written down

1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:16.480
 respectable honest theory yet. So there could very well be experimental predictions we just

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:19.360
 don't know about yet. That is one of the things that we're trying to figure out.

1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:24.320
 But for emergent space time, you need really big stuff, right?

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:29.920
 Well, or really fast stuff or really energetic stuff, we don't know. That's the thing. So

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:34.720
 there could be violations of the speed of light if you have emergent space time.

1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.120
 Not going faster than the speed of light, but the speed of light could be different

1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:44.960
 for light of different wavelengths. That would be a dramatic violation of physics as we know it,

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:49.680
 but it could be possible. Or not. I mean, it's not an absolute prediction. That's the problem.

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.840
 The theories are just not well developed enough yet to say.

1:19:51.840 --> 1:20:00.800
 Is there anything that quantum mechanics can teach us about human nature or the human mind?

1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.360
 Do you think about sort of consciousness and these kinds of topics? Is there?

1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:12.160
 It's certainly excessively used as you point out. The word quantum is used for everything

1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:22.960
 besides quantum mechanics. But in more seriousness, is there something that goes to the human level

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:28.480
 and can help us understand our mind? Not really. It's the short answer.

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:34.400
 Mines are pretty classical. I don't think. We don't know this for sure, but I don't think

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:37.760
 that phenomena like entanglement are crucial to how the human mind works.

1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:43.680
 What about consciousness? You mentioned, I think early on in the conversation, you said it would be

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:53.360
 unlikely, but incredible if sort of the observer is somehow a fundamental part.

1:20:54.480 --> 1:21:00.960
 So if observer, not to romanticize the notion, but seems interlinked to the idea of consciousness.

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:08.720
 So if consciousness as the panpsychist believes is fundamental to the universe, is that possible?

1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:15.280
 Is that weight? I mean, everything's possible. Just like Joe Rogan likes to say it's entirely

1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:25.360
 possible. But okay, but is it on a spectrum of crazy out there? Statistically speaking,

1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:29.920
 how often do you ponder the possibility that consciousness is fundamental or the observer

1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:35.840
 is fundamental? I personally don't at all. There are people who do. I'm a thorough physicalist

1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:40.800
 when it comes to consciousness. I do not think that there are any separate mental states or

1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:44.960
 mental properties. I think they're all emergent, just like space time is. And space time is hard

1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:50.000
 enough to understand. So the fact that we don't yet understand consciousness is not at all surprising

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:56.000
 to me. You, as we mentioned, have an amazing podcast called Minescape. It's, as I said,

1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:04.480
 one of my favorite podcasts, sort of both for your explanation of physics, which a lot of people love.

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:11.200
 And when you venture out into things that are beyond your expertise, but it's just a really

1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:19.840
 smart person exploring even questions like, you know, morality, for example, was very interesting.

1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:23.840
 I think you did a solo episode and so on. I mean, there's a lot of really interesting

1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:32.640
 conversations that you have. What are some from memory, amazing conversations that pop to mind

1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:38.000
 that you've had? What did you learn from them? Something that maybe changed your mind or just

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:43.360
 inspired you or just did this whole experience of having conversations? What stands out to you?

1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:48.800
 It's an unfair question. It's totally unfair, but that's okay. That's all right. You know,

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:55.280
 it's often the ones, I feel like the ones I do on physics and closely related science or even

1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:02.800
 philosophy ones are like, I know this stuff and I'm helping people learn about it. But I learn

1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:07.040
 more from the ones that have nothing to do with physics or philosophy, right? So talking to Winton

1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:13.040
 Marsalis about jazz or talking to a master sommelier about wine, talking to Will Wilkinson

1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:19.200
 about partisan polarization and the urban world divide, talking to psychologists like Carol

1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:27.920
 Tavres about cognitive dissonance and how those things work. Scott Derrickson, who is the director

1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:32.000
 of the movie Dr. Strange, I had a wonderful conversation with him where we went through

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:38.400
 the mechanics of making a blockbuster superhero movie, right? And he's also not a naturalist.

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:43.440
 He's an evangelical Christian. So we talked about the nature of reality there. I want to have a

1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:53.680
 couple more discussions with highly educated theists who know the theology really well,

1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:57.840
 but I haven't quite arranged those yet. I would love to hear that. I mean, that's

1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:04.960
 how comfortable are you venturing into questions of religion? Oh, I'm totally comfortable doing it.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:11.680
 I did talk with Alan Lightman, who is also an atheist, but he is trying to rescue the sort

1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:20.320
 of spiritual side of things for atheism. And I did talk to very vocal atheists like Alex Rosenberg.

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.400
 So I need to talk to some, I've talked to some religious believers, but I need to talk to more.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:29.120
 How have you changed through having all these conversations?

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:35.360
 You know, part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn't read, and I

1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:39.360
 couldn't find time to read them. And I figured if I interviewed their authors for me to read them,

1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:43.520
 right? And that's that is totally worked, by the way. Now I'm annoyed that people write such long

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:50.480
 books. I think I'm still very much learning how to be a good interviewer. I think that's a skill

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:56.160
 that, you know, I think I have good questions. But, you know, there's the the give and take

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.880
 that is still, I think I could be better at like, I want to offer something to the conversation,

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:05.120
 but not too much, right? I've had conversations where I barely talked at all, and I have

1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:08.800
 conversations where I talked half the time, and I think there's a happy medium in between there.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:13.680
 So I think I remember listening to, without mentioning names, some of your conversations

1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:20.000
 where I wish you would have disagreed more. Yeah. As a listener, it's more fun sometimes.

1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:24.400
 Well, this is that's a very good question, because, you know, my everyone has an attitude

1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:32.080
 toward that. Like, some people are really there to basically give their point of view, and their

1:25:32.080 --> 1:25:38.800
 guest is supposed to, you know, respond accordingly. I want to sort of get my view on the record,

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:42.560
 but I don't want to dwell on it when I'm talking to someone like David Chalmers,

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:45.840
 who I disagree with a lot. You know, I want to say, like, here's why I disagree with you.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.600
 But, you know, I want, we're here to listen to you. Like, I have an episode every week,

1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:57.440
 and you're only on once a week, right? So I have an upcoming podcast episode with Philip Goff,

1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:03.120
 who is a much more dedicated panpsychist. And so there we really get into it. I think that

1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:07.920
 I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have with another podcast

1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:12.880
 guest. But that's what he wanted. So it worked very well. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of debate structure

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:18.640
 is a beautiful one. It's done right. Like, when you're, when you can detect that the intent

1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:25.440
 is that you have fundamental respect for the person that, and that's, for some reason,

1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:30.640
 it's super fun to listen to when two really smart people are just arguing and sometimes

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:36.000
 lose their shit a little bit if I may say so. Well, there's a fine line because I have zero

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.600
 interest in bringing, I mean, like, I mean, maybe you implied this, I have zero interest in

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:45.760
 bringing on people for whom I don't have any intellectual respect. Like, I constantly get

1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:49.680
 requests to like, you know, bring on a flat earth or whatever and really slap them down,

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:54.880
 or a creation is like, I'm at zero interest. I'm happy to bring on, you know, a religious

1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:59.200
 person, a believer, but I want someone who's smart and can act in good faith and can talk,

1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:05.840
 not a charlatan or a lunatic, right? So I will only, I will happily bring on people with whom I

1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:10.080
 disagree, but only people from whom I think the audience can learn something interesting.

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:17.040
 So let me ask, the idea of charlatan is an interesting idea. You might be more educated

1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:26.320
 on this topic than me, but there's folks, for example, who argue various aspects of evolution

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:34.720
 sort of try to approach and say that evolution, sort of our current theory of evolution,

1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:40.640
 has many holes in it, as many flaws. And they argue that I think like Cambridge,

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:49.840
 Cambrian explosion, which is like a huge added variability of species, doesn't make sense under

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:56.000
 our current description of evolution, theory of evolution, sort of, if you were to have the

1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:02.240
 conversation with people like that, how do you know that there, the difference between outside

1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:13.440
 the box thinkers and people who are fundamentally unscientific and even bordering on charlatans?

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:18.240
 That's a great question. And the further you get away from my expertise, the harder it is for me

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:24.240
 to really judge exactly those things. Yeah, I don't have a satisfying answer for that one,

1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:30.080
 because I think the example you use of someone who believes in the basic structure of natural

1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:35.680
 selection, but thinks that this particular thing cannot be understood in the terms of our current

1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:42.800
 understanding of Darwinism, that's a perfect edge case where it's hard to tell. And I would

1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:47.360
 try to talk to people who I do respect and who do know things, and I would have to... Given that

1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:52.560
 I'm a physicist, I know that physicists will sometimes be too dismissive of alternative

1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:56.640
 points of view. I have to take into account that biologists can also be too dismissive of

1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:02.160
 alternative points of view. So yeah, that's a tricky one. Have you gotten heat yet? Yeah,

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:09.040
 heat all the time. There's always something... I mean, it's hilarious because I try very hard

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:14.640
 not to have the same topic several times in a row. I did have two climate change episodes,

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:17.600
 but they were from very different perspectives, but I like to mix it up. That's the whole point,

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:21.680
 that's why I'm having fun. And every time I do an episode, someone says, oh, the person you

1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:25.760
 should really get on to talk about exactly that is this other person. I'm like, well, I did that

1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:32.000
 now. I don't want to do that anymore. Well, I hope you keep doing it. You're inspiring millions of

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:36.800
 people, your books, your podcasts. Sean, it's an honor to talk to you. Thank you so much.

1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:57.440
 Thanks very much, Lex.
