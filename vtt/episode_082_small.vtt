00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 The following is a conversation with Simon Sinek,

00:02.920 --> 00:04.520
 author of several books,

00:04.520 --> 00:07.840
 including Start With Why, Leaders Eat Last,

00:07.840 --> 00:10.360
 and his latest, The Infinite Game.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.760
 He's one of the best communicators

00:12.760 --> 00:14.720
 of what it takes to be a good leader,

00:14.720 --> 00:16.900
 to inspire, to build businesses

00:16.900 --> 00:19.420
 that solve big, difficult challenges.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.720
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.940
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:25.940 --> 00:28.280
 review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,

00:28.280 --> 00:31.600

00:31.600 --> 00:35.760
 at Lex Freedman, spelled FRID MAN.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.360
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,

00:38.360 --> 00:39.760
 and never any ads in the middle

00:39.760 --> 00:42.200
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.640
 I hope that works for you,

00:43.640 --> 00:45.920
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.040
 Quick summary of the ads, two sponsors,

00:50.040 --> 00:52.540
 Cash App and Masterclass.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.280
 Please consider supporting the podcast

00:54.280 --> 00:57.880
 by downloading Cash App and using code Lex Podcast,

00:57.880 --> 01:02.880
 and signing up to masterclass at masterclass.com slash Lex.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.680
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:06.680 --> 01:09.520
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.280
 When you get it, use code Lex Podcast.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.360
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

01:15.360 --> 01:17.840
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

01:17.840 --> 01:19.480
 with as little as $1.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.040
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

01:23.040 --> 01:25.100
 let me mention that cryptocurrency

01:25.100 --> 01:28.640
 in the context of the history of money is fascinating.

01:28.640 --> 01:32.560
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.560
 Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.560
 The US dollar created over 200 years ago,

01:40.560 --> 01:43.940
 and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,

01:43.940 --> 01:46.340
 released just over 10 years ago.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.240
 So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much

01:50.240 --> 01:52.140
 in its early days of development,

01:52.140 --> 01:55.320
 but it's still aiming to and just might

01:55.320 --> 01:58.440
 redefine the nature of money.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.840
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,

02:00.840 --> 02:04.440
 or Google Play, and use the code Lex Podcast,

02:04.440 --> 02:08.480
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 the first,

02:08.480 --> 02:11.080
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics

02:11.080 --> 02:14.840
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.200

02:24.080 --> 02:26.160
 When I first heard about Masterclass,

02:26.160 --> 02:28.800
 I honestly thought it was too good to be true.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.620
 For $180 a year, you get an all access pass

02:32.620 --> 02:36.680
 to watch courses from experts at the top of their field.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.560
 To list some of my favorites,

02:38.560 --> 02:41.200
 Chris Hadfield on Space Exploration,

02:41.200 --> 02:44.520
 Neil deGrasse Tyson on Scientific Thinking and Communication,

02:44.520 --> 02:47.600
 Will Wright, the creator of Sims City,

02:47.600 --> 02:50.240
 and Sims on Game Design.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.840
 I love that game.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.840
 Jane Goodall on Conservation,

02:53.840 --> 02:57.400
 Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists on guitar,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.520
 Gary Kasparov on Chess.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.240
 Obviously, I'm Russian.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.760
 I love Gary.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.800
 Daniel Negrano on Poker, one of my favorite poker players,

03:05.800 --> 03:10.800
 also Phil Ivy, gives a course as well, and many, many more.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.080
 Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work

03:14.080 --> 03:17.200
 and the experience of being launched into space alone

03:17.200 --> 03:18.920
 is worth the money.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.560
 By way of advice for me,

03:20.560 --> 03:24.200
 the key is not to be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.200
 Pick three courses you want to complete.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.560
 Watch each all the way through from start to finish.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.760
 It's not that long, but it's an experience

03:30.760 --> 03:33.960
 that will stick with you for a long time, I promise.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.440
 It's easily worth the money.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.040
 You can watch it on basically any device.

03:38.040 --> 03:42.080

03:45.720 --> 03:49.440
 And now, here's my conversation with Simon Sinek.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.160
 In The Infinite Game, your most recent book,

03:53.160 --> 03:56.040
 you described the finite game and the infinite game.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.640
 So from my perspective of artificial intelligence

03:58.640 --> 04:01.120
 and game theory in general,

04:01.120 --> 04:03.840
 I'm a huge fan of finite games

04:03.840 --> 04:05.680
 from the broad philosophical sense of something

04:05.680 --> 04:08.680
 that in the robotics, artificial intelligence space,

04:08.680 --> 04:09.640
 we know how to deal with.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.720
 And then you describe the infinite game,

04:11.720 --> 04:13.920
 which has no exact static rules,

04:13.920 --> 04:16.960
 has no well defined static objective,

04:16.960 --> 04:19.800
 has the players are known, unknown, they changed,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.440
 there's the dynamic element.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.360
 So this is something that applies to business,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.760
 politics, life itself.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.640
 So can you try to articulate the objective function here

04:32.640 --> 04:36.600
 of the infinite game or in the cliche,

04:36.600 --> 04:41.600
 broad philosophical sense, what is the meaning of life?

04:41.600 --> 04:44.920
 Go for the start with the soft polls.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.560
 Easy question first.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.800
 So James Kars was the philosopher who originally articulated

04:51.800 --> 04:54.040
 this concept of finite and infinite games.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.240
 And when I learned about it,

04:56.240 --> 05:00.040
 it really challenged my view of how the world works, right?

05:00.040 --> 05:02.560
 Because I think we all think about winning

05:02.560 --> 05:04.000
 and being the best and being number one.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.400
 But if you think about it,

05:06.400 --> 05:07.880
 only in a finite game can that exist.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.920
 The game that has fixed rules, agreed upon objectives

05:11.920 --> 05:14.000
 and known players, like football or baseball.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.360
 There's always a beginning, middle and end.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.120
 And if there's a winner, there has to be a loser.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.600
 Infinite games, as Kars describes them, as you said,

05:21.600 --> 05:22.960
 have known and unknown players,

05:22.960 --> 05:24.640
 which means anyone can join.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.200
 It has a changeable rules,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.840
 which means you can play however you want.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.480
 And the objective is to perpetuate the game,

05:29.480 --> 05:32.200
 to stay in the game as long as possible.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.920
 In other words, there's no such thing as being number one

05:33.920 --> 05:36.680
 or winning in a game that has no finish line.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.640
 And what I learned is that when we try to win

05:40.640 --> 05:42.800
 in a game that has no finish line,

05:42.800 --> 05:44.800
 we try to be number, we try to be the best

05:44.800 --> 05:46.600
 in a game that has no agreed upon objectives

05:46.600 --> 05:49.280
 or agreed upon metrics or time frames,

05:49.280 --> 05:51.800
 there's a few consistent and predictable outcomes,

05:51.800 --> 05:54.360
 the decline of trust, the decline of cooperation,

05:54.360 --> 05:55.680
 the decline of innovation.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.720
 And I find this fascinating

05:59.720 --> 06:02.400
 because so many of the ways that we run most organizations

06:02.400 --> 06:04.000
 is with a finite mindset.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.880
 So trying to reduce the beautiful complex thing

06:06.880 --> 06:09.560
 that is life or what politics or business

06:09.560 --> 06:12.040
 into something very narrow.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.800
 And in that process, the reductionist process,

06:14.800 --> 06:16.200
 you lose something fundamental

06:16.200 --> 06:20.200
 that makes the whole thing work in the longterm.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.600
 So returning, I'm not gonna let you off the hook easy.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.880
 What is the meaning of life?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.440
 So what is the objective function

06:28.440 --> 06:31.000
 that is worthwhile to pursue?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.040
 Well, if you think about our tombstones, right?

06:34.040 --> 06:36.440
 They have the date we were born and the date we died,

06:36.440 --> 06:39.880
 but really it's what we do with the gap in between.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.840
 There's a poem called the dash.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.960
 You know, it's the dash that matters.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.480
 It's what we do between the time we're born

06:45.480 --> 06:47.760
 and the time we die that gives our life meaning.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.160
 And if we live our lives with a finite mindset,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.400
 which means to accumulate more power or money

06:52.400 --> 06:54.320
 than anybody else to outdo everyone else

06:54.320 --> 06:55.720
 to be number one, to be the best,

06:55.720 --> 06:56.880
 we don't take any of us with us.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.520
 We don't take any of it with us, we just die.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.280
 The people who get remembered,

07:02.280 --> 07:04.200
 the way we wanna be remembered

07:04.200 --> 07:06.280
 is how, what kind of people we were, right?

07:06.280 --> 07:08.080
 Devoted mother, loving father,

07:08.080 --> 07:10.560
 what kind of person we were to other people.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.200
 Jack Welch just died recently.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.800
 And the Washington Post,

07:14.800 --> 07:18.360
 when it wrote the headline for his obit,

07:18.360 --> 07:23.200
 it wrote, he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.560
 And that's his legacy.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.160
 A finite player who is obsessed with winning.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.440
 Yes, who leaves behind a legacy of short term gains

07:31.440 --> 07:33.680
 for a few and distress for many.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.520
 That's his legacy.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.040
 And every single one of us gets the choice

07:37.040 --> 07:39.640
 of the kind of legacy we wanna have.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.480
 Do we wanna be remembered for our contributions

07:41.480 --> 07:43.880
 or our detractions?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.160
 To live with a finite mindset,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.800
 to live a career with a finite mindset,

07:47.800 --> 07:50.240
 to be number one, be the best, be the most famous.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.360
 You live a life like Jack Welch, you know?

07:56.360 --> 07:57.320
 To live a life of service,

07:57.320 --> 07:59.160
 to see those around us rise,

07:59.160 --> 08:02.000
 to contribute to our communities, to our organizations,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.600
 to leave them in better shape than we found them.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.880
 That's the kind of legacy most of us would like to have.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.720
 So day to day, when you think about what is the fundamental

08:14.880 --> 08:19.880
 goals, dreams, motivations of an infinite game,

08:20.920 --> 08:24.560
 of seeing your life, your career is an infinite game.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.160
 What does that look like?

08:26.160 --> 08:29.640
 I mean, I guess I'm sort of trying to stick

08:29.640 --> 08:32.160
 on this personal ego, personal drive,

08:32.160 --> 08:35.440
 the thing that the fire, the reason we wanna wake up

08:35.440 --> 08:37.520
 in the morning and the reason we can't go to bed

08:37.520 --> 08:39.640
 because we're so excited, what is that?

08:39.640 --> 08:41.800
 So for me, it's about having a just cause.

08:41.800 --> 08:44.280
 It's about a vision that's bigger than me.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.640
 That my work gets to contribute

08:45.640 --> 08:48.400
 to something larger than myself, you know?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.320
 That's what drives me every day.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.800
 I wake up every morning with a vision of a world

08:53.800 --> 08:54.640
 that does not yet exist,

08:54.640 --> 08:56.280
 a world in which the vast majority of people

08:56.280 --> 08:58.320
 wake up every single morning inspired,

08:58.320 --> 09:01.160
 feel safe at work and return home fulfilled

09:01.160 --> 09:02.120
 at the end of the day.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.800
 It is not the world we live in.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.680
 And so that we still have work to do

09:06.680 --> 09:08.640
 is the thing that drives me.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.240
 I know what my underlying values are.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.920
 I wake up to inspire people to do the things

09:12.920 --> 09:13.760
 that inspire them.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.040
 And these are the things that I,

09:16.040 --> 09:17.680
 these are my go tos, my touch points

09:20.280 --> 09:22.200
 that inspire me to keep working.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.760
 I think of a career like an iceberg, you know?

09:24.760 --> 09:27.000
 If you have a vision for something,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.160
 you're the only one who can see

09:28.160 --> 09:30.440
 the iceberg underneath the ocean.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.240
 But if you start working at it, a little bit shows up.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.200
 And now a few other people can see what you imagine,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.440
 be like, oh, right, yeah, no,

09:36.440 --> 09:37.680
 I wanna help build that as well.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.280
 And if you have a lot of success,

09:39.280 --> 09:40.240
 then you have a lot of iceberg.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.320
 And people can see this huge iceberg

09:41.320 --> 09:42.960
 and they say, you've accomplished so much.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.040
 But what I see is all the work still yet to be done.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.720
 You know, I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.240
 And so the growth, you talk about momentum.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.720
 So the incremental revealing of the iceberg

09:56.720 --> 09:58.200
 is what drives you.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.680
 Well, it necessarily is incremental.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.480
 What drives me is that, is the realization,

10:03.480 --> 10:05.480
 is realizing the iceberg,

10:05.480 --> 10:08.040
 bringing more of the iceberg from the unknown to the known,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.480
 bringing more of the vision

10:09.480 --> 10:11.380
 from the imagination to reality.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.480
 And you have this fundamental vision of optimism.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.400
 You call yourself an optimist.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.200
 I mean, in this world, I have a sort of,

10:20.200 --> 10:23.440
 I see myself a little bit as the main character

10:23.440 --> 10:25.400
 from the idiot by Dostoyevsky,

10:25.400 --> 10:29.120
 who's also kind of seen by society as a fool

10:29.120 --> 10:32.400
 because he was optimistic.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.280
 So one, can you maybe articulate

10:35.280 --> 10:37.600
 where that sense of optimism comes from?

10:37.600 --> 10:40.320
 And maybe you also try to articulate your vision

10:40.320 --> 10:43.880
 of the future where people are inspired,

10:43.880 --> 10:46.040
 where optimism drives us.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.200
 It's easy to forget that when you look at social media

10:48.200 --> 10:50.480
 and so on with the word toxicity

10:50.480 --> 10:53.120
 and negativity can often get more likes

10:53.120 --> 10:56.360
 that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.120
 And I do hope it's out there.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.320
 So can you try to articulate that vision?

11:00.320 --> 11:01.160
 Yeah, yeah.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.360
 So I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist

11:04.360 --> 11:08.080
 is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.320
 Even in tragedy, it brings people together.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.720
 And the question is, can we see that?

11:12.720 --> 11:15.880
 Can you see the beauty that is in everything?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.480
 I don't think optimism is foolishness.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.000
 I don't think optimism is blindness,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.160
 though it probably involves some naivete,

11:27.160 --> 11:29.760
 the belief that things will get better,

11:29.760 --> 11:32.520
 the belief that we tend towards the good,

11:33.840 --> 11:36.000
 even in times of struggle or bad.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.400
 You can't sustain war, but you can sustain peace.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.520
 I think things that are stable are more sustainable,

11:46.520 --> 11:49.560
 things that are optimistic are more sustainable

11:49.560 --> 11:52.120
 than things that are chaotic.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.880
 So you see people as fundamentally good.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.560
 I mean, some people may disagree

11:56.560 --> 12:00.440
 that you can't sustain peace, you can't sustain war.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.760
 I mean, you don't have to, I think war is costly.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.200
 It involves life and money

12:06.280 --> 12:08.480
 and peace does not involve those things.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.760
 It requires work.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.720
 I'm not saying it doesn't require work,

12:11.720 --> 12:14.120
 but it doesn't drain resources,

12:14.120 --> 12:16.240
 I think the same way that war does.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.080
 You know, the people that would say

12:18.080 --> 12:19.560
 that we always have war,

12:19.560 --> 12:21.880
 and I just talked to the historian of Stalin,

12:21.880 --> 12:25.040
 is, you know, would say that conflict

12:25.040 --> 12:27.920
 and the desire for power and conflict

12:27.920 --> 12:30.560
 is central to human nature.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.880
 I concur.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.960
 But something in your words also,

12:34.960 --> 12:38.120
 perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share,

12:38.120 --> 12:39.440
 is that you have an optimism

12:39.440 --> 12:40.840
 that people are fundamentally good.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.240
 I'm an idealist, you know?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.400
 And I think idealism is good.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.840
 I'm not a fool to believe

12:45.840 --> 12:48.400
 that the ideals that I imagine can come true.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.440
 Of course there'll never be world peace,

12:50.440 --> 12:52.760
 but shouldn't we die trying?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.120
 You know, I think that's the whole point.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.160
 That's the whole point of vision.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.480
 Vision should be idealistic

12:56.480 --> 13:00.440
 and it should be for all practical purposes impossible.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.360
 But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.880
 And it's the milestones that we reach

13:06.880 --> 13:09.200
 that take us closer to that ideal

13:09.200 --> 13:12.360
 that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning

13:12.360 --> 13:14.400
 and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.200
 You know, just because it's impossible

13:17.200 --> 13:19.520
 doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.640
 As I said, we're still moving the ball down the field.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.080
 We're still making progress.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.600
 Things are still getting better,

13:24.600 --> 13:27.200
 even if we never get to that ideal state.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.480
 So I think idealism is a good thing.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.200
 You know, in the word infinite game,

13:34.040 --> 13:37.000
 one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.200
 human life at least, at least from the biological perspective

13:40.200 --> 13:41.400
 is that it ends.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.720
 So sadly, it's...

13:44.720 --> 13:46.160
 To some people, yeah.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.280
 Fine, it's tragic to some people or is it ends?

13:50.280 --> 13:53.200
 I think some people believe that it ends on the day you die

13:53.200 --> 13:55.280
 and some people think it continues on.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.440
 And there's a lot of different ways

13:56.440 --> 13:58.760
 to think what continues on even looks like.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.800
 But let me drag it back to the personal.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.640
 Sure.

14:02.640 --> 14:06.160
 Which is how do you think about your own mortality?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.680
 Are you afraid of death?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.120
 How do you think about your own death?

14:10.120 --> 14:12.360
 I definitely haven't accomplished everything

14:12.360 --> 14:14.040
 I want to contribute to.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.640
 I would like more time on this earth

14:17.640 --> 14:20.680
 to keep working towards that vision.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.520
 Do you think about the fact that it ends for you?

14:22.520 --> 14:23.880
 Are you cognizant of it?

14:23.880 --> 14:24.960
 Of course I'm cognizant of it.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.120
 I mean, aren't we all?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.960
 I don't dwell on it.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.160
 I'm aware of it.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.680
 I know that my life is finite

14:33.680 --> 14:35.800
 and I know that I have a certain amount of time

14:35.800 --> 14:36.640
 left on this planet

14:36.640 --> 14:39.440
 and I'd like to make that time be valuable.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.640
 Some people would think that ideas kind of allow you

14:43.640 --> 14:46.720
 to have a certain kind of immortality.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.600
 Maybe to linger on this kind of question.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.440
 So first to push back on the,

14:56.440 --> 14:58.840
 you said that everyone's cognizant of the immortality.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.840
 There's a guy named Ernest Becker

15:00.840 --> 15:03.600
 who would disagree that you basically say

15:03.600 --> 15:08.600
 that most of human cognition is created by us

15:08.600 --> 15:09.960
 trying to create an illusion

15:09.960 --> 15:12.000
 and try to hide the fact from ourselves

15:12.000 --> 15:13.360
 the fact that we're going to die

15:13.360 --> 15:17.000
 to try to think that it's all going to go on forever.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.560
 But the fact that we know that it doesn't?

15:19.560 --> 15:21.800
 Yes, but this mix of denial.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.400
 I mean, I think the book is called Denial of Death.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.560
 It's this constant denial that we're running away from.

15:27.560 --> 15:32.560
 In fact, some would argue that the inspiration,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.560
 the incredible ideas you've put out there,

15:35.560 --> 15:36.960
 your TED Talk has been seen

15:36.960 --> 15:38.840
 by millions and millions of people, right?

15:38.840 --> 15:41.760
 It's just you trying to desperately fight the fact

15:41.760 --> 15:43.960
 that you are biologically mortal

15:43.960 --> 15:48.160
 and your creative genius comes from the fact

15:48.160 --> 15:49.440
 that you're trying to create ideas

15:49.440 --> 15:51.120
 that live on long past you.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.160
 Well, that's very nice of you.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.280
 I mean, I would like my ideas to live on beyond me

15:57.280 --> 15:59.400
 because I think that is a good test

15:59.400 --> 16:03.560
 that those ideas have value in the lives of others.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.400
 I think that's a good test

16:05.400 --> 16:08.760
 that others would continue to talk about

16:08.760 --> 16:12.560
 or share the ideas long after I'm gone.

16:12.560 --> 16:16.400
 I think is perhaps the greatest compliment

16:16.400 --> 16:17.960
 one can get for one's own work.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.480
 But I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality

16:23.480 --> 16:25.600
 that drives me to do it.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.280
 It's my desire to contribute that drives me to do it.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.800
 It's the optimal, it's the optimist vision.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.480
 It's the pleasure and the fulfillment you get

16:36.480 --> 16:38.600
 from inspiring others.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.200
 It's as pure as that.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.360
 Let me ask, listen, I'm Russian.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.200
 I'm trying to get used to it.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.040
 You're good, you're good.

16:45.040 --> 16:45.880
 I'm enjoying it.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.720
 You get you into these dark areas.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.560
 You're good, I'm enjoying it.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.000
 Is the ego tied up into it somehow?

16:50.000 --> 16:54.440
 So your name is extremely well known.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.080
 If your name wasn't attached to it,

16:56.080 --> 16:58.520
 do you think you would act differently?

16:58.520 --> 17:02.240
 I mean, for years I hated that my name was attached to it.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.080
 I had a rule for years that I wouldn't have my face

17:06.080 --> 17:08.160
 on the front page of the website.

17:09.760 --> 17:10.840
 I had a fight with the publisher

17:10.840 --> 17:14.040
 because I didn't want my name big on the book.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.440
 I wanted it tiny on the book

17:15.440 --> 17:17.040
 because I kept telling them it's not about me,

17:17.040 --> 17:18.160
 it's about the ideas.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.640
 They wanted to put my name on the top of my book, I refused.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.400
 None of my books have my names on the top

17:22.400 --> 17:25.280
 because I won't let them.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.560
 They would like very much to put my name

17:26.560 --> 17:27.400
 on the top of the book,

17:27.400 --> 17:30.200
 but the idea has to be bigger than me.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.040
 I'm not bigger than the idea.

17:32.040 --> 17:32.880
 That's beautifully put.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.440
 Do you think ego?

17:34.440 --> 17:38.000
 But I also am aware that I've become recognized

17:38.000 --> 17:39.440
 as the messenger.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.000
 And even though I still think the message is bigger than me,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.160
 I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.560
 And whether I like it or not is irrelevant.

17:47.560 --> 17:52.560
 I accept the responsibility, I'm happy to do it.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.720
 I'm not sure how to phrase this,

17:54.720 --> 17:58.920
 but there's a large part of the culture right now

17:58.920 --> 18:01.880
 that emphasizes all the things

18:01.880 --> 18:03.400
 that nobody disagrees with,

18:03.400 --> 18:07.080
 which is health, sleep, diet, relaxation,

18:07.080 --> 18:10.320
 meditation, vacation are really important.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.720
 And there's no, you know, it's like,

18:11.720 --> 18:13.440
 you can't really argue against that.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.400
 In fact, people...

18:14.400 --> 18:16.000
 Less sleep.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.040
 Less, I'm joking.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.920
 Yes, well, that's the thing.

18:18.920 --> 18:23.760
 I often speak to the fact that passion

18:23.760 --> 18:25.800
 and love for what you're doing

18:25.800 --> 18:28.320
 and the two words hard work,

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
 especially in the engineering fields,

18:30.320 --> 18:35.320
 are more important to prioritize than sleep.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.120
 Even though sleep is really important,

18:38.120 --> 18:40.560
 your mind should be obsessed with the hard work,

18:40.560 --> 18:41.680
 with the passion and so on.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.920
 And then I get some pushback, of course, from people.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.080
 What do you make sense of that?

18:46.080 --> 18:49.160
 Is that just me, the crazy Russian engineer

18:49.160 --> 18:50.320
 really pushing hard work?

18:50.320 --> 18:51.160
 Probably.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.120
 I think that's a short term strategy.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.920
 I think if you sacrifice your health for the work,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.360
 at some point, it catches up with you.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.480
 And at some point, it's like going, going, going,

19:02.480 --> 19:03.440
 and you get sick.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.760
 Your body will shut down for you

19:04.760 --> 19:07.280
 if you refuse to take care of yourself.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.760
 You know, you get sick, it's what happens.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.560
 Sometimes, you know, more severalness

19:12.560 --> 19:14.240
 than something that just slows you down.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.920
 So I think taking, like getting sleep,

19:17.920 --> 19:20.920
 I mean, there've been studies on this that, you know,

19:20.920 --> 19:24.080
 executives, for example, who get a full night's sleep

19:24.080 --> 19:26.000
 and stop at a reasonable hour,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.600
 actually accomplish more, are more productive

19:29.600 --> 19:31.520
 than people who work and burn the midnight oil

19:31.520 --> 19:33.440
 because their brains are working better,

19:33.440 --> 19:35.320
 because they're well rested.

19:35.320 --> 19:39.240
 So, you know, working hard, yes, but why not work smart?

19:39.240 --> 19:44.240
 I think that giving our minds and our bodies rest

19:45.360 --> 19:46.720
 makes us more efficient.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.200
 I think just driving, driving, driving, driving

19:49.200 --> 19:52.080
 is a short term strategy.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.960
 So, but to push back on that a little bit,

19:53.960 --> 19:57.040
 the annoying thing is you're like 100% right

19:57.040 --> 19:58.680
 in terms of science, right?

19:58.680 --> 20:02.960
 But the thing is, it's because you're 100% right,

20:02.960 --> 20:07.560
 that weak part of your mind uses that fact

20:07.560 --> 20:10.160
 to convince you, like, so, you know,

20:10.160 --> 20:12.600
 I get all kinds of, my mind comes up with all kinds

20:12.600 --> 20:14.360
 of excuses to try to convince me

20:14.360 --> 20:16.080
 that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing.

20:16.080 --> 20:16.920
 To rationalize.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.320
 To rationalize, and so what I have a sense,

20:21.320 --> 20:23.080
 I think what you said about executives

20:23.080 --> 20:25.000
 and leaders is absolutely right,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.880
 but there's the early days,

20:26.880 --> 20:29.120
 the early days of madness and passion.

20:29.120 --> 20:29.960
 For sure.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.720
 Then I feel like emphasizing sleep,

20:33.720 --> 20:37.560
 thinking about a sleep is giving yourself a way out

20:37.560 --> 20:39.480
 from the fact that those early days,

20:39.480 --> 20:42.800
 especially, it can be suffering.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.680
 As long, it's not sustainable.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.000
 You know, right, it's not sustainable.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.040
 Sure, if you're investing all that energy

20:49.040 --> 20:52.600
 in something at the beginning to get it up and running,

20:52.600 --> 20:55.640
 then at some point you're gonna have to slow down,

20:55.640 --> 20:57.600
 or your body will slow you down for you.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.000
 Like, you can choose or your body can choose.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.840
 I mean, so, okay, so you don't think, from my perspective,

21:04.840 --> 21:07.400
 it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft,

21:07.400 --> 21:11.160
 but you're saying, no, I think that there seems evidence

21:11.160 --> 21:16.160
 that working harder and later have taken a backseat.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.680
 I think we have to be careful with broad generalizations,

21:24.680 --> 21:28.160
 but I think if you go into the workplace,

21:28.160 --> 21:31.560
 there are people who would complain that more people

21:31.560 --> 21:34.520
 now than before, you know, look at their watches

21:34.520 --> 21:37.240
 and say, oops, five o clock, goodbye, right?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.600
 Now, is that a problem with the people?

21:39.600 --> 21:41.720
 You're saying it's the people giving themselves excuses

21:41.720 --> 21:43.000
 and people who don't work hard,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.080
 or is it the organizations aren't giving them something

21:45.080 --> 21:46.840
 to believe in, something to be passionate about?

21:46.840 --> 21:48.160
 We can't manufacture passion.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.080
 You can't just tell someone, be passionate.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.400
 You know, that's not how it works.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.000
 Passion's an output, not an input.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.600
 Like, if I believe in something and I wanna contribute

21:57.600 --> 22:00.280
 all that energy to do it, we call that passion.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.360
 You know, working hard for something we love is passion.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.200
 Working hard for something we don't care about

22:04.200 --> 22:06.800
 is called stress, but we're working hard either way.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.440
 So I think the organizations bear some accountability

22:10.440 --> 22:11.720
 and our leaders bear some accountability,

22:11.720 --> 22:13.640
 which is if they're not offering a sense of purpose,

22:13.640 --> 22:15.520
 if they're not offering us a sense of cause,

22:15.520 --> 22:17.680
 if they're not telling us that our work is worth more

22:17.680 --> 22:19.800
 than simply the money it makes,

22:19.800 --> 22:21.160
 then yeah, I'm gonna come at five o clock

22:21.160 --> 22:23.200
 because I don't really care about making you money.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.600
 Remember, we live in a world right now

22:24.600 --> 22:26.960
 where a lot of people, rather a few people,

22:26.960 --> 22:29.720
 are getting rich on the hard work of others.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.000
 And so I think when people look up and say,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.640
 well, why would I do that?

22:34.640 --> 22:36.600
 I'll just, if you're not gonna look after me,

22:36.600 --> 22:38.160
 and then you're gonna lay me off at the end of the year

22:38.160 --> 22:40.440
 because you missed your arbitrary projections,

22:40.440 --> 22:41.720
 you know, you're gonna lay me off

22:41.720 --> 22:43.960
 because you missed your arbitrary projections,

22:43.960 --> 22:47.440
 then why would I offer my hard work and loyalty to you?

22:47.440 --> 22:50.760
 So I don't think we can immediately blame people

22:50.760 --> 22:51.960
 for going soft.

22:51.960 --> 22:54.960
 I think we can blame leaders

22:54.960 --> 22:58.760
 for their inability or failure to offer their people

22:58.760 --> 23:02.720
 something bigger than making a product or making money.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.360
 Yeah, so that's brilliant.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.960
 And start with why leaders eat last, your books,

23:07.960 --> 23:10.880
 you kind of, you basically talk about

23:10.880 --> 23:14.000
 what it takes to be a good leader.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.720
 And so some of the blame should go on the leader,

23:15.720 --> 23:19.880
 but how much of it is on finding your passion,

23:19.880 --> 23:21.880
 how much is it on the individual?

23:21.880 --> 23:24.760
 And allowing yourself to pursue that passion,

23:24.760 --> 23:28.960
 pushing yourself to your limits to really take

23:28.960 --> 23:33.240
 concrete steps along your path towards that passion.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.640
 Yeah, there's mutual responsibility,

23:34.640 --> 23:35.560
 there's mutual accountability.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.680
 I mean, we're responsible as individuals to find

23:38.680 --> 23:41.240
 the organizations and find the leaders that inspire us.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.000
 And organizations are responsible for maintaining that flame

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
 and giving people who believe what they believed,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.800
 you know, a chance to contribute.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.600
 So to linger on it, have you by chance

23:52.600 --> 23:54.080
 seen the movie Whiplash?

23:54.080 --> 23:54.920
 Yes.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.400
 Again, maybe I'm romanticizing suffering.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.440
 Again. It's the Russian in you.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.280
 It's the Russian.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.400
 Yeah, the Russians love suffering.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.080
 But for people who haven't seen,

24:07.080 --> 24:10.920
 it's the movie Whiplash as a drum instructor

24:10.920 --> 24:15.920
 that pushes the drum musician to his limits

24:16.600 --> 24:18.720
 to bring out the best in him.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.600
 And there's a toxic nature to it.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.840
 There's suffering in it.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.360
 Like you've worked a lot of great leaders,

24:24.360 --> 24:25.520
 a lot of great individuals.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.440
 So is that toxic relationship as toxic

24:29.440 --> 24:30.520
 as it appears in the movie?

24:30.520 --> 24:31.480
 Or is that fundamental?

24:31.480 --> 24:33.680
 I've seen that relationship,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.800
 especially in the past with Olympic athletes,

24:35.800 --> 24:39.840
 with especially in athletics, extreme performers,

24:39.840 --> 24:40.960
 seem to do wonders.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.120
 It does wonders for me.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.960
 There's some of my best relationships,

24:44.960 --> 24:47.720
 now I'm not representative of everyone certainly,

24:47.720 --> 24:50.080
 but some of my best relationships for mentee

24:50.080 --> 24:54.880
 and mentor have been toxic from an external perspective.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.720
 What do you make of that movie?

24:57.720 --> 25:00.600
 What do you make of that kind of relationship?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.080
 That's not my favorite movie.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.960
 Okay, so you don't think that's a healthy,

25:06.960 --> 25:08.640
 you don't think that kind of relationship

25:08.640 --> 25:11.920
 is a great example of a great leader?

25:11.920 --> 25:13.040
 I think it's a short term strategy.

25:13.040 --> 25:13.880
 I mean, short term.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.440
 I mean, look, being hard on someone

25:15.440 --> 25:16.880
 is not the same as toxicity.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.880
 You know, if you go to the Marine Corps,

25:22.000 --> 25:26.160
 a drill instructor will be very hard on their Marines.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.520
 And then, but still, even on the last day of boot camp,

25:29.520 --> 25:32.040
 they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.840
 But the, of all the drill instructors,

25:34.840 --> 25:38.800
 you know, the three or four main drill instructors

25:38.800 --> 25:40.520
 assigned to a group of recruits,

25:40.520 --> 25:42.160
 the one that they all want the respect of

25:42.160 --> 25:44.120
 is the one that's the hardest on them.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.880
 That's true.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.400
 And you hear, you know, there's plenty of stories

25:48.400 --> 25:50.960
 of people who want to earn the respect of a hard parent

25:50.960 --> 25:52.080
 or a hard teacher.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.080
 But fundamental, that parent, that teacher,

25:55.080 --> 25:57.360
 that drill instructor has to believe in that person.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.640
 It has to see potential of them.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.000
 It's not a formula, which is if I'm hard on people,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.120
 they'll do well, which is there has to still be love.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.040
 It has to be done with absolute love

26:06.040 --> 26:09.000
 and it has to be done responsibly.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.560
 I mean, some people can take a little more pressure

26:10.560 --> 26:12.840
 than others, but it's not, I don't,

26:12.840 --> 26:15.720
 I think it's irresponsible to think of it as a formula

26:15.720 --> 26:19.480
 that if I'm just toxic at people, they will do well.

26:20.480 --> 26:21.840
 It depends on their personalities.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.920
 First of all, that works for some, but not all.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.560
 And second of all, it can't be done willy nilly.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.000
 It has to still be done with care and love.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
 And sometimes you can get equal or better results

26:36.240 --> 26:37.720
 without all of the toxicity.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.920
 So one of the, I guess toxicity on my part

26:41.920 --> 26:43.560
 was a really bad word to use,

26:43.560 --> 26:46.440
 but if we talk about what makes a good leader

26:46.440 --> 26:49.680
 and just look at an example in particular,

26:49.680 --> 26:51.240
 looking at Elon Musk,

26:51.240 --> 26:54.440
 he's known to push people to the limits

26:55.640 --> 27:00.640
 in a way that I think really challenges people

27:01.360 --> 27:03.040
 in a way that they've never been challenged before

27:03.040 --> 27:07.280
 to do the impossible, but it can really break people.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.240
 And jobs was hard and Amazon is hard.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.360
 And, you know, but the thing that's important

27:12.360 --> 27:14.400
 is none of them lie about it.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.400
 You know, people ask me about Amazon all the time.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
 Like Jeff Bezos never lied about it.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.040
 You know, even the ones who like Amazon

27:20.040 --> 27:21.640
 don't last more than a couple of years

27:21.640 --> 27:22.680
 before they burn out.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.320
 But when we're honest about the culture,

27:25.320 --> 27:26.640
 then it gives people the opportunity

27:26.640 --> 27:28.080
 who like to work in that kind of culture,

27:28.080 --> 27:29.920
 to choose to work in that kind of culture,

27:29.920 --> 27:31.360
 as opposed to pretending and saying,

27:31.360 --> 27:34.520
 oh no, this is all, you know, it's all lovey lovey here.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.280
 And then you show up and it's the furthest thing from it.

27:37.280 --> 27:41.400
 So, I mean, I think the reputations

27:41.400 --> 27:44.080
 of putting a lot of pressure on people to, you know,

27:44.080 --> 27:48.800
 Jobs was not an easy man to work for.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.960
 He pushed people, but everyone who worked there

27:50.960 --> 27:53.000
 was given the space to create and do things

27:53.000 --> 27:54.800
 that they would not have been able to do anywhere else

27:54.800 --> 27:56.960
 and work at a level that they didn't work anywhere else.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.760
 And Jobs didn't have all the answers.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.160
 I mean, he pushed his people to come up with answers.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.880
 He wasn't just looking for people to execute his ideas.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.480
 And people did.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.720
 People accomplished more than they thought

28:09.720 --> 28:12.320
 they were capable of, which is wonderful.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.720
 How do you, you're talking about the infinite game

28:16.560 --> 28:19.840
 and not thinking about too short term.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.840
 And yet you see some of the most brilliant people

28:22.840 --> 28:24.760
 in the world being pushed by Elon Musk

28:24.760 --> 28:27.080
 to accomplish some of the most incredible things.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.640
 When we're talking about autopilot,

28:28.640 --> 28:32.000
 when we're talking about some of the hardware engineering,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.120
 and they do some of the best work of their life.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.360
 And then leave.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.280
 How do you balance that in terms of what it takes

28:40.280 --> 28:41.680
 to be a good leader,

28:41.680 --> 28:44.280
 what it takes to accomplish great things in your life?

28:44.280 --> 28:46.680
 Yeah, so I think there's a difference between

28:48.480 --> 28:52.640
 someone who can get a lot out of people in the short term

28:52.640 --> 28:54.360
 and building an organization that can sustain

28:54.360 --> 28:55.600
 beyond any individual.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.040
 There's a difference.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.440
 When you say beyond any individual,

28:59.440 --> 29:03.040
 you mean beyond like if the leader dies.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.120
 Correct, like could Tesla continue to do

29:05.120 --> 29:07.480
 what it's doing without Elon Musk?

29:07.480 --> 29:10.680
 And you're perhaps implying,

29:10.680 --> 29:13.640
 which is a very interesting question that he cannot.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.280
 I don't know.

29:15.280 --> 29:18.480
 The argument you're making of this person

29:18.480 --> 29:23.480
 who pushes everyone arguably is not a repeatable model, right?

29:23.520 --> 29:25.760
 Is Apple the same without Steve Jobs,

29:25.760 --> 29:28.280
 or is it slowly moving in a different direction?

29:29.840 --> 29:31.040
 Or has he established something

29:31.040 --> 29:34.040
 that could be resurrected with the right leader?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.680
 That was his dream, I think,

29:35.680 --> 29:39.920
 is to build an organization that lives on beyond them.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.960
 At least I remember reading that somewhere.

29:40.960 --> 29:44.320
 I think that's what a lot of leaders desire,

29:44.320 --> 29:47.720
 which is to create something that was bigger than them.

29:47.720 --> 29:51.480
 Most businesses, most entrepreneurial ventures

29:51.480 --> 29:54.920
 could not pass the school bus test,

29:54.920 --> 29:57.160
 which is if the founder was hit by a school bus,

29:57.160 --> 29:58.840
 would everyone continue the business without them

29:58.840 --> 30:01.160
 or would they all just go find jobs?

30:01.160 --> 30:04.240
 And the vast majority of companies would fail that test,

30:06.600 --> 30:08.320
 especially in the entrepreneurial world,

30:08.320 --> 30:11.040
 that if you take the inspired visionary leader away,

30:11.040 --> 30:12.400
 the whole thing collapses.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.920
 So is that a business or is that just a force of personality?

30:15.920 --> 30:19.320
 And a lot of entrepreneurs face that reality,

30:19.320 --> 30:20.600
 which is they have to be in every meeting,

30:20.600 --> 30:24.120
 make every decision, come up with every idea,

30:24.120 --> 30:25.880
 because if they don't, who will?

30:25.880 --> 30:27.440
 And the question is, well,

30:27.440 --> 30:29.240
 what have you done to build your bench?

30:29.240 --> 30:33.440
 Is it, it's not, sometimes it's ego,

30:33.440 --> 30:35.480
 the belief that only I can.

30:35.480 --> 30:39.720
 Sometimes it's just things got,

30:39.720 --> 30:42.720
 did so well for so long that just forgot.

30:43.640 --> 30:48.640
 And sometimes it's a failure to build the training programs

30:49.840 --> 30:53.800
 or hire the right people that could replace you,

30:53.800 --> 30:56.120
 who are maybe smarter and better.

30:56.120 --> 31:01.120
 And brow beating people is only one strategy.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.480
 I don't think it's necessarily the only strategy,

31:03.480 --> 31:05.080
 nor is it always the best strategy.

31:05.080 --> 31:05.920
 I think people,

31:05.920 --> 31:07.800
 people get to choose the cultures they want to work in.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.320
 So this is why I think,

31:09.320 --> 31:11.760
 I think companies should be honest

31:12.880 --> 31:15.120
 about the kind of culture that they've created.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.120
 You know, I heard a story about Apple

31:18.120 --> 31:20.640
 where somebody came in from a big company,

31:20.640 --> 31:25.640
 you know, he'd accomplished a lot and his ego was very large

31:26.240 --> 31:28.440
 and he was going on about how he did this and he did that

31:28.440 --> 31:30.480
 and he did this and he did that.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.360
 And somebody from Apple said,

31:32.360 --> 31:34.640
 we don't care what you've done.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.440
 The question is, what are you gonna do?

31:37.360 --> 31:42.040
 And that's, you know, for somebody who wants to be pushed,

31:42.040 --> 31:45.120
 that's the place you go, because you choose to be pushed.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.080
 Now, we all want to be pushed to some degree,

31:48.080 --> 31:51.000
 you know, anybody who wants to, you know, accomplish anything

31:51.000 --> 31:52.600
 in this world wants to be pushed to some degree,

31:52.600 --> 31:55.880
 whether it's through self pressure or external pressure

31:55.880 --> 31:58.360
 or, you know, public pressure, whatever it is.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.600
 But I think this whole idea of one size fits all

32:03.600 --> 32:06.400
 is a false narrative of how leadership works,

32:06.400 --> 32:09.200
 but what all leadership requires is creating an environment

32:09.200 --> 32:11.160
 in which people can work at their natural best.

32:11.160 --> 32:15.040
 But you have a sense that it's possible to create a business

32:15.040 --> 32:18.360
 where it lives on beyond you.

32:18.360 --> 32:22.360
 So if we look at now, if we just look at this current moment,

32:22.360 --> 32:25.680
 I just recently talked to Jack Doris, the CEO of Twitter,

32:25.680 --> 32:27.320
 and he's under a lot of pressure now.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.760
 I don't know if you're aware of the news

32:28.760 --> 32:31.640
 that he's being pushed out as a potential as the CEO

32:31.640 --> 32:33.720
 of Twitter, because he's the CEO already

32:33.720 --> 32:35.800
 of an incredibly successful company.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.640
 Plus he wants to go to Africa to live a few months

32:38.640 --> 32:41.720
 in Africa to connect with the world

32:41.720 --> 32:43.920
 that's outside of the Silicon Valley

32:43.920 --> 32:45.840
 and sort of there's this idea

32:45.840 --> 32:48.480
 while can Twitter live without Jack?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.320
 We'll find out.

32:50.320 --> 32:55.320
 But you have a general as a student of great leadership.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.600
 You have a general sense that it's possible.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.640
 Yeah, of course it's possible.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.720
 I mean, what Bill Gates built with Microsoft

33:02.920 --> 33:05.280
 may not have survived Steve Ballmer

33:05.280 --> 33:07.560
 if the company weren't so rich,

33:07.560 --> 33:12.240
 but Sachin Ardala is putting it back on track again.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.800
 It's become a visionary company again.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.000
 It's attracting great talent again.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.920
 It went through a period where they couldn't get

33:16.920 --> 33:18.760
 the best talent and the best talent was leaving.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.560
 Now people want to work for Microsoft again.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.760
 Well, that's not because of pressure.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.200
 Ballmer put more pressure on people,

33:25.200 --> 33:27.800
 mainly to hit numbers than anything else.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.600
 That didn't work.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.320
 Yes, right?

33:31.320 --> 33:32.160
 And so the question is,

33:32.160 --> 33:33.400
 what kind of pressure are we putting on people?

33:33.400 --> 33:35.680
 We're putting on pressure people to hit numbers

33:35.680 --> 33:38.240
 or hit arbitrary deadlines,

33:38.240 --> 33:39.520
 or we're putting on pressure on people

33:39.520 --> 33:41.960
 because we believe that they can do better work.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.440
 And the work that we're trying to do

33:44.440 --> 33:46.640
 is to advance a vision that's bigger than all of us.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.960
 And if you're going to put pressure on people,

33:47.960 --> 33:49.760
 it better be for the right reason.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.000
 Like if you're going to put pressure on me,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.560
 it better be for a worthwhile reason.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.360
 If it's just to hit a goal,

33:54.360 --> 33:56.000
 if it's just to hit some arbitrary date

33:56.000 --> 33:58.160
 or some arbitrary number or make a stock price,

33:58.160 --> 33:59.800
 hit some target, you can keep it.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.120
 I'm out of here.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.160
 But if you want to put pressure on me

34:02.160 --> 34:07.000
 because we are brothers and sisters in arms,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.080
 working to advance a cause bigger than ourselves,

34:09.080 --> 34:10.720
 that we believe whatever we're going to build

34:10.720 --> 34:12.360
 will significantly contribute

34:12.360 --> 34:14.160
 to the greater good of society,

34:14.160 --> 34:16.240
 then go ahead, I'll take the pressure.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.360
 And if you look at the apples

34:17.360 --> 34:22.360
 and if you look at the Elon Musk's,

34:22.880 --> 34:24.120
 you know, the jobs in the Elon Musk,

34:24.120 --> 34:25.440
 they fundamentally believe

34:25.440 --> 34:27.520
 that what they were doing would improve society

34:27.520 --> 34:30.200
 and it was for the good of humankind.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.760
 And so the pressure, in other words,

34:33.760 --> 34:36.080
 what they were doing was more important,

34:36.080 --> 34:38.320
 more valuable than any individual on the team.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.200
 And so the pressure they put on people

34:41.200 --> 34:42.960
 served a greater good.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.680
 And so we looked to the left

34:45.680 --> 34:47.000
 and we looked to the right, to each other

34:47.000 --> 34:49.120
 and said, we're in this together.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.600
 We accept this, we want this.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.840
 But if it's just pressure to hit a number

34:54.840 --> 34:59.120
 or, you know, make the widget move a little faster,

35:01.280 --> 35:02.440
 that's soul sucking.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.600
 That's not passion, that's stress.

35:06.600 --> 35:11.200
 And I think a lot of leaders confuse

35:11.200 --> 35:12.320
 that making people work hard

35:12.320 --> 35:13.920
 is not what makes them passionate.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.600
 Giving to them something to believe in

35:17.600 --> 35:20.920
 and work on is what drives passion.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.160
 And when you have that, then turning up the pressure

35:23.160 --> 35:27.240
 only brings people together, drives them farther.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.920
 If done the right way.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.840
 If done the right way.

35:30.840 --> 35:35.200
 Speaking of pressure, I'm gonna give you 90 seconds

35:35.200 --> 35:37.080
 to answer the last question,

35:37.080 --> 35:39.480
 which is if I told you that tomorrow

35:39.480 --> 35:42.960
 was your last day to live, you talked about mortality,

35:42.960 --> 35:45.360
 sunrise to sunset, can you tell me,

35:45.360 --> 35:46.400
 can you take me through the day?

35:46.400 --> 35:48.560
 What do you think that day would involve?

35:48.560 --> 35:52.160
 You can't spend it with your family, I told you as well.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.040
 I would probably want to fill all of my senses

35:55.040 --> 35:59.200
 with things that excite my senses.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.520
 I'd want to look at beautiful art.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.960
 I'd want to listen to beautiful music.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.000
 I'd want to taste incredible food.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.960
 I'd want to smell amazing tastes.

36:06.960 --> 36:11.960
 I'd want to touch something that's beautiful to touch.

36:14.200 --> 36:18.240
 I'd want all of my senses to just be consumed

36:19.280 --> 36:21.160
 with things that I find beautiful.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.320
 And you talked about this idea of

36:23.320 --> 36:26.120
 we don't do it often these days of just listening to music,

36:26.120 --> 36:28.680
 turning off all the devices and actually taking in

36:28.680 --> 36:29.880
 and listening to music.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.560
 So as a addendum, if we're to talk about music,

36:34.560 --> 36:38.160
 what song would you be blasting in this last day of your life?

36:38.160 --> 36:39.120
 Is it Led Zeppelin?

36:39.120 --> 36:39.960
 What did we talk about?

36:39.960 --> 36:40.800
 I hope that I love.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.640
 No, no.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.000
 There's probably going to be a Beatles song in there.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.160
 There'll definitely be some Beethoven in there.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.440
 The Classics.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.280
 The Classics.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.120
 Yeah, exactly.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.880
 Thank you so much for talking to us.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.600
 Thank you for making time for it.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.120
 Under pressure, we made it happen.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.840
 Yeah, it was great.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.720

37:29.040 --> 37:32.280
 There are only two ways to influence human behavior.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.480
 You can manipulate it or you can inspire it.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.240
 Thank you for listening.

37:38.240 --> 38:03.240
 I hope to see you next time.
