00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
 The following is a conversation between me and Michael Malis.

00:05.040 --> 00:12.080
 Michael is an author, anarchist, and simpleton, and I'm proud to call him my friend.

00:12.080 --> 00:19.120
 He makes me smile, he makes me think, and he makes me wonder why I sound so sleepy all

00:19.120 --> 00:20.560
 the time.

00:20.560 --> 00:27.280
 And now, enjoy this conversation with Michael Malis in the Dupagalovic language that I'm

00:27.280 --> 00:32.800
 increasingly certain I'll never quite able to get the hang of.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
 Hello, Comrade.

00:33.800 --> 00:40.880
 So, Animal Farm by George Orwell is one of my favorite books.

00:40.880 --> 00:46.640
 It's an allegory about, at least I think, about the Soviet Union and the Russian Revolution

00:46.640 --> 00:48.880
 of 1917.

00:48.880 --> 00:54.480
 So for people who haven't read it, it's animals overthrow the humans and then slowly become

00:54.480 --> 00:57.720
 as bad or worse than the humans.

00:57.720 --> 01:04.360
 So Comrade, if we lived on this farm, in the book Animal Farm, which animal would you most

01:04.360 --> 01:06.560
 rather be?

01:06.560 --> 01:13.920
 Would it be the pigs, the horses, the donkey Benjamin, the raven Moses, the humans, Mr.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.160
 Mrs. Jones, the dogs, or the sheep?

01:17.160 --> 01:23.760
 I'm going to go with the Milton answer, which is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven,

01:23.760 --> 01:24.760
 right?

01:24.760 --> 01:27.080
 It's better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.080
 Yeah.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.800
 So I would have to go with the pigs.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.280
 So I guess I'd be a cop.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
 At the very top.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.960
 So the leader, the main pig, Napoleon, versus like the...

01:35.960 --> 01:37.200
 The wallet of the others.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
 Yeah.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
 I would say it's not...

01:39.200 --> 01:43.200
 It's sure it's an allegory about the Russian Revolution, but I think Orwell's point was

01:43.200 --> 01:46.280
 this is broader towards most totalitarian dictatorships.

01:46.280 --> 01:51.720
 I mean, it could very easily be reticent indictment of Mussolini or Hitler or many of these others.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.320
 I'm a huge George Orwell fan.

01:55.320 --> 02:01.560
 One of the things that I think people on the right need to appreciate is the courage of

02:01.560 --> 02:09.840
 many of these indisputably left wing voices who were the strongest ones to take on totalitarianism,

02:09.840 --> 02:10.840
 totalitarian communism.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.680
 And the three I could think off top of my head who are all in my top 10 heroes of all

02:14.680 --> 02:20.600
 time are Emma Goldman, Albert Camus, and Orwell being the third.

02:20.600 --> 02:25.160
 Something that leftists like to throw in the face of people on the right who constantly

02:25.160 --> 02:29.200
 invoke Orwell is that Orwell said, and I don't have the exact quote off top of my head, but

02:29.200 --> 02:35.000
 something to the effect of every word I have written should be taken as a defense of democratic

02:35.000 --> 02:37.360
 socialism against totalitarianism.

02:37.360 --> 02:44.260
 So people like Truman was obviously very hardcore in many ways, anti communist.

02:44.260 --> 02:51.760
 We like to parse things out, you're going to laugh into binary fashions that left good,

02:51.760 --> 02:53.760
 right bad, or right good, left bad.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.720
 But historically speaking, it was just not fall away into these camps as easily as people

02:58.720 --> 03:00.560
 would like.

03:00.560 --> 03:06.680
 And I think it is important for those of us, it takes a lot more courage to fight the right

03:06.680 --> 03:12.120
 from the right or to fight the left from the left, because in a sense, a lot of your countrymen

03:12.120 --> 03:15.680
 or your fellow travelers are going to regard you as a traitor to the cause.

03:15.680 --> 03:22.200
 So every chance I get, I will sing the praises of these three figures among others who not

03:22.200 --> 03:27.440
 all, even if they hadn't done what they had done, just lived just amazing lives that all

03:27.440 --> 03:34.400
 of us can learn from and admire and regard as somewhat a role model.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.760
 So what was the nature of their opposition to totalitarianism?

03:38.760 --> 03:42.560
 Is it basically freedom, the value of freedom?

03:42.560 --> 03:43.840
 Let's go through the three of them.

03:43.840 --> 03:48.840
 So Emma Goldman, she was an early anarchist figure, we'll talk about her later, I'm sure.

03:48.840 --> 03:53.480
 She got deported from the United States with her partner in crime, Alexander Berkman,

03:53.480 --> 03:58.760
 literal crime, he tried to assassinate Frick, who was Andrew Carnegie's main man in the

03:58.760 --> 04:00.960
 Pittsburgh Steel Mill Strike.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.640
 She got deported to the Soviet Union, and they're like, oh, you want socialism because

04:05.640 --> 04:09.320
 at the time the anarchists were regarded as socialists, go choke on it.

04:09.320 --> 04:13.640
 And she's there, and she was watching in great horror what was going on.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.920
 And she actually went to Lenin's office, and she goes, this isn't what we're about.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.120
 The revolution is about the individual and free speech, and everyone working together

04:21.120 --> 04:23.040
 to further society.

04:23.040 --> 04:27.920
 And he told her that free speech is a bourgeois contrivance, and regardless, you can't have

04:27.920 --> 04:30.800
 these circumstances in the midst of a revolution.

04:30.800 --> 04:35.880
 And when she left the Soviet Union, and she went to Britain, and at the time, before the

04:35.880 --> 04:41.800
 1917, there was a lot of discussion among socialist circles about what would the revolution

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
 look like, right?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.680
 Would there be the Bakunin anarchist model?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.600
 Would there be the Marxist model?

04:46.600 --> 04:49.880
 Obviously the Bolsheviks ended up winning, but even then it wasn't obvious because there

04:49.880 --> 04:51.640
 was the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.

04:51.640 --> 04:56.400
 And what people, you and I know what those words mean, but Bolsheviks were kind of funny

04:56.400 --> 04:59.760
 because Bolsheviks means bigger and Mensheviks means smaller.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.520
 The Mensheviks had the numbers.

05:01.520 --> 05:06.280
 It was sarcastic that they were called Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks were called Bolsheviks.

05:06.280 --> 05:11.600
 And Lenin destroyed all his foes in a very merciless way, obviously.

05:11.600 --> 05:17.320
 Beforehand, there was the idea that with all these kakamimi ideas, we have to work together.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.000
 We don't know what's going to look like for the cause.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.240
 Then as soon as he sees power, he's like, yeah, yeah, we're not doing that kind of pluralism

05:22.240 --> 05:23.240
 anymore.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.840
 This is going to be the right approach.

05:25.840 --> 05:31.640
 So she left the Soviet Union, as did Berkman, she wrote a book that they titled My Disillusion

05:31.640 --> 05:32.640
 with Russia.

05:32.640 --> 05:36.280
 And I remember there's one anecdote, which I'm going to discuss in a forthcoming book,

05:36.280 --> 05:39.600
 where she goes to Britain and the British were very red at the time.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.440
 They really had something called the Fabian Society, which was the predecessor to the

05:43.440 --> 05:47.540
 British Labor Party, which were like, all right, we're going to get rid of liberalism

05:47.540 --> 05:50.880
 and have a socialist kind of nation.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.040
 And she gave talks and there was this one time where she gave a talk and she started

05:55.040 --> 05:58.840
 and there was a standing ovation by the time she was done, you could hear a pin drop because

05:58.840 --> 06:03.720
 she dared to look at these people in the face, something they've been fighting for all their

06:03.720 --> 06:07.040
 lives and saying, we've been to the future and it works.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.720
 And she's like, guys, this is worse than the czar.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.440
 People are under house arrest, you're not allowed to have newspapers being shut down

06:14.440 --> 06:16.920
 if they have heretical views, so on and so forth.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.560
 And she was just even more of a pariah than she had been previously.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.600
 So she deserves huge accolades in that regard.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.640
 I brought her up and we were talking about with our conversation with Yaron Orwell.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.280
 I think you don't need me to explain what he has done and continues to do to use fiction

06:34.280 --> 06:39.920
 to demonstrate the horrors of a totalitarian state.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.840
 And Camus, who might be my all time, great lighthouse, so to speak, in terms of being

06:44.840 --> 06:49.120
 a man of conscience, he joined the Communist Party and for a lot of people in the States,

06:49.120 --> 06:51.400
 you hear, oh, you joined the Communist Party, so I need to hear.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.360
 So he was the Communist, all you need to know.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.840
 He joined the Communist Party because they were the main ones fighting the fascists in

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
 France and other locations.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.240
 And he took Nazism, as did many others, of course, very, very, very seriously.

07:03.240 --> 07:08.760
 He wasn't some committed communist, but this was just his mechanism to take on, you know,

07:08.760 --> 07:11.700
 be part of the underground and Vichy France and so on and so forth.

07:11.700 --> 07:16.960
 So he had the quote, which is ascribed to him, which is kind of a misquote.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.800
 Howard Zinn is the one who actually said it, that it is a job of thinking people not to

07:20.800 --> 07:23.040
 be on the side of the executioners.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.720
 And he very much felt, if you read his speech when he won the Nobel Prize, I forget, in

07:27.720 --> 07:33.880
 the 50s, where he goes, it's basically the job of writers to keep civilization from destroying

07:33.880 --> 07:34.880
 himself.

07:34.880 --> 07:39.160
 I don't think I'm ever going to be a man on the level of Camus and what he's accomplished,

07:39.160 --> 07:46.960
 but I think that vision of it is the job of writers to be the conscience and to point out,

07:46.960 --> 07:51.940
 you know, this is the leftism at its best when, you know, giving voice to the voiceless,

07:51.940 --> 07:56.680
 when you have the machine of the state crushing and marginalizing people and they might not

07:56.680 --> 08:03.160
 be educated, literate or have any power at all, he's the guy who's like, you are ruining

08:03.160 --> 08:08.560
 humans, these humans matter and I'm not going to let you look the other way and act like

08:08.560 --> 08:10.080
 you don't know what you're doing.

08:10.080 --> 08:15.000
 So in this time, whether we look at the time of fascism or we look at the fictional animal

08:15.000 --> 08:17.960
 farm, what's the heroic action then?

08:17.960 --> 08:23.560
 So Camus joined the Communist Party, there's a bunch of different heroic actions, some

08:23.560 --> 08:29.280
 more heroic than others, not just for the, you know, heroes the wrong word in terms

08:29.280 --> 08:30.280
 of like effectiveness.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
 Sure.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.520
 What's the effective action, I guess is what I want to ask.

08:33.520 --> 08:38.400
 As a writer, as a thinker, as somebody with a mind, what's the heroic action?

08:38.400 --> 08:42.980
 That's a tricky question because a lot of times in the West, heroism is regardless intertwined

08:42.980 --> 08:44.280
 with martyrdom, right?

08:44.280 --> 08:47.760
 So it's kind of this idea of like you have to speak to, you know, Camus always talked

08:47.760 --> 08:50.520
 about let justice be done, though the heavens fall.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.080
 This is a common kind of motto among people with conscience and that you have to do the

08:55.080 --> 08:58.080
 right thing, even the consequences might not be what you like.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.480
 And I think that is a good loose definition of heroism.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.920
 So if you meet, I'll give you one example of heroism.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.800
 This was on Twitter and I really feel bad that I don't remember the guy's name.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.820
 This was the line to Auschwitz, I believe it was, and you know, there's the Nazi guards

09:13.820 --> 09:16.000
 keeping everyone along.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.800
 And if you were a certain, I think if you were under 12, they killed you or some, there

09:19.800 --> 09:24.200
 was some age limit where some kids were killed or some were not, there was some circumstances.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.600
 And he asked the mom how old this kid was and she's like, he's 14 and she's like, no,

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
 he's 12.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.600
 And she's like, no, he's nice 14.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.040
 She goes, he's 12.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.520
 And she realized what this Nazi was telling her, even in that circumstance, and it ended

09:36.520 --> 09:37.840
 up saving the kid's life.

09:37.840 --> 09:47.840
 So I think heroism in this context is defiance and standing true to values of liberalism,

09:47.840 --> 09:51.680
 humanism and venerating the sanctity of human life.

09:51.680 --> 09:56.880
 I think that, and I think it's also important to pick your battles.

09:56.880 --> 10:02.760
 I don't think if, you know, he got that Nazi over there, gotten a bullhorn and said, hey,

10:02.760 --> 10:04.800
 this is the rules, blah, blah, blah, blah.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.320
 That's not going to help anyone do anything.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.000
 So I do think, you know, people a lot of times attack me for my anarchist views.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.400
 It's like, oh, you know, would you call the police?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.400
 Would you use the roads?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.840
 Would you pay your income taxes?

10:15.840 --> 10:19.760
 You know, I got an argument with Tim Poole because there was that couple, I think, in

10:19.760 --> 10:24.760
 what was that Missouri or Illinois when they had their guns and they were being arrested

10:24.760 --> 10:27.800
 and they basically took a plea deal and he said, you should have fought.

10:27.800 --> 10:32.320
 I go, it's a lot easier to say you should fight, but we don't know what circumstance

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
 someone is under.

10:33.320 --> 10:40.080
 And what these totalitarian regimes did very, very well, as you know, is if you were a target

10:40.080 --> 10:43.520
 and they can't get through to you, that's fine, you have a family.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.600
 So you can sit there, Lex, and gird your jaw and you can stand up to all the torture.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
 Cool.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.760
 What are we going to do about your wife?

10:50.760 --> 10:51.760
 What about your mom?

10:51.760 --> 10:57.760
 One thing Stalin did, he made it a law that kids up to 14 and up could get the death penalty

10:57.760 --> 10:59.240
 for certain crimes.

10:59.240 --> 11:05.040
 So after that, the rule was from the NKVD, if you were interrogating someone, they would

11:05.040 --> 11:09.440
 have death warrants for the kid's child on the desk visible.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.920
 So I'm interrogating you, asking you to commit to, I'm sorry, to admit to some crime that

11:14.920 --> 11:16.080
 you're not committed.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.960
 And those piece of paper, it's, you know, Svetlana, she's got a death warrant.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.080
 You're going to admit to any crime you want.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.720
 So this is something Americans, this is even the case right now in North Korea, which I

11:26.720 --> 11:29.360
 know you had Yanmi Park on is something I talk about a lot.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.760
 Let's talk about instead of the hypothetical, but this is happening right now on earth.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.000
 You can look at the map on Google.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.660
 The great leader Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea said class enemies must be

11:39.660 --> 11:41.720
 exterminated three generations.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.560
 So North, when people talk about individualism versus collectivism, Rick Santorum from Ascender

11:46.560 --> 11:50.680
 says the family is the basic unit of society, unit.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.080
 North Korea takes that seriously.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.400
 The family is punished as a unit.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.560
 So if someone does something wrong, three generations have to pay the price and you

11:58.560 --> 12:01.880
 often don't know who it is that got you all in trouble.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.160
 There's not a trial.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.000
 This to Western minds is something almost incomprehensible.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.320
 It's a lot easier to be brave when it's just your skin.

12:10.320 --> 12:17.240
 There's something when it's, yeah, when it's your child, your loved ones, every man becomes

12:17.240 --> 12:18.240
 a coward.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.520
 But also what bravery is there for me to write an essay for The Guardian to say I don't vote?

12:22.520 --> 12:25.640
 There's no consequences to me, there's no possibility of consequences to me.

12:25.640 --> 12:29.120
 This is the wonderful thing about living, excuse me, in a free country.

12:29.120 --> 12:35.120
 It would take a lot of courage to be in the Soviet Union and say, I'm not going to vote.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.880
 And what would that courage accomplish very little?

12:37.880 --> 12:42.080
 So I think heroism in the sense of kind of the suicidal stuff and taking a stance with

12:42.080 --> 12:45.560
 no consequence that is a bit overrated.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.640
 There is some aspect like the way I think about heroism is something like you said about

12:50.640 --> 12:58.800
 the Nazi soldier, which is quietly, privately in your own life, lived the virtues that you

12:58.800 --> 13:01.200
 want the rest of the world to live by.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
 Yes.

13:02.200 --> 13:08.000
 So like without writing about it is not as heroic as living it quietly.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.840
 I'll give you a great example of this.

13:10.840 --> 13:17.160
 I sometimes give talks on networking and I tell the kids, if you know someone's in town

13:17.160 --> 13:19.600
 and it's their birthday with nothing to do, take them out.

13:19.600 --> 13:22.920
 And I say, I do this for selfish reasons and everyone laughs.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.080
 And I go, think about it this way.

13:25.080 --> 13:29.160
 The guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.

13:29.160 --> 13:33.920
 That could be you, like you have that capacity to be that person and you're making that day

13:33.920 --> 13:34.920
 feel special.

13:34.920 --> 13:39.320
 They're going to remember for a long time what's the cost, dinner, 30 bucks, 25 bucks.

13:39.320 --> 13:48.200
 So it's very disturbing to me how often people have opportunities to slightly move the needle

13:48.200 --> 13:51.960
 and make things a bit better at almost no cost.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.720
 And they just literally don't think in those terms.

13:54.720 --> 14:00.040
 And one of the things Camus talked about, he's often described as an existentialist,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.720
 which he did not like that term, he regarded himself as an absurdist, is the idea that

14:03.720 --> 14:06.080
 we're basically blank canvases.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.800
 And this isn't something that is dangerous.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.680
 This is enormous opportunity.

14:09.680 --> 14:14.680
 And you have the ability to become the kind of man or woman that you admire and want

14:14.680 --> 14:15.680
 to be.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.880
 You don't have to be, I don't know, George Washington or one of these great heroes of

14:18.880 --> 14:26.800
 all time, but everyone out there has the capacity to be a hero to their kids or to be a hero

14:26.800 --> 14:30.840
 to maybe some, there's nursing homes and there's old people who are lonely.

14:30.840 --> 14:36.000
 I think that you take in a dog that's on its last legs.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.120
 These are little things, Terry Shepherd does that a lot on Abraham as a hero.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.080
 These are not Terry Shepherd, I'm blanking his name.

14:43.080 --> 14:48.640
 These are things that people do that aren't heroic in the sense of Superman, but that

14:48.640 --> 14:53.360
 I find admirable extremely and I think are very underrated because these people aren't

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
 championed.

14:54.360 --> 15:00.840
 Is this some kind of weird passive aggressive and direct way for you to tell me that I should

15:00.840 --> 15:03.160
 take you off for your birthday on Monday?

15:03.160 --> 15:05.240
 Is that why you gave that whole speech?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
 That wasn't it at all.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.760
 That was a joke, Michael.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.760
 No, it was a failed joke.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
 Nevertheless.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.840
 There was no punchline.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
 No failure.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
 We would not have triumph.

15:14.840 --> 15:20.040
 Can we stick on the Camus absurdism versus existentialism?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
 Sure.

15:21.040 --> 15:28.480
 What do you think is the difference in your ideas about anarchism too?

15:28.480 --> 15:36.320
 It seems like those are somehow intricately connected because existentialism is connected

15:36.320 --> 15:40.440
 to freedom and freedom is connected to anarchism.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.440
 Sure.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.160
 I mean, Sartre was a defender of the Soviet Union.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.280
 He said explicitly about things like gulags, like even if it's true, we shouldn't talk

15:50.280 --> 15:53.400
 about it.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.880
 What people don't appreciate is how human beings can have contradictory ideas in their

15:57.880 --> 15:59.520
 minds at the same time.

15:59.520 --> 16:04.280
 One would think, okay, someone's a Democrat, they think ABC, therefore they can think DEF.

16:04.280 --> 16:08.160
 People that have all sorts of contradictions and it's not at all clear and they'll have

16:08.160 --> 16:12.200
 a clean conscience because the human mind is very sophisticated and is capable of doing

16:12.200 --> 16:13.200
 this.

16:13.200 --> 16:19.040
 Sartre was, you would think, he's this radical individualist, this sense of ultimate freedom,

16:19.040 --> 16:20.760
 but he's defending the Soviet Union.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.560
 Camus, on the other hand, would probably be, was very much like a social Democrat.

16:25.560 --> 16:29.880
 He didn't really talk about what politics should be so much as it shouldn't be.

16:29.880 --> 16:34.840
 His essay, Reflections on the Guillotine, is one of the great masterpieces of all time

16:34.840 --> 16:41.680
 and attack on the death penalty, not in terms of no one's evil or it's wrong to kill murderers,

16:41.680 --> 16:44.640
 but in terms of what does it do for a society?

16:44.640 --> 16:51.000
 If you'd have someone who takes a person and locks them in a room and says, in two years,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.760
 I'm going to murder you and you lock them for that, this is not someone we'd regard as

16:54.760 --> 17:00.440
 moral, we regard this as someone who's a complete monster, but that's what the state does with

17:00.440 --> 17:06.240
 the death penalty and he challenges us to think, is this the kind of people we want

17:06.240 --> 17:07.400
 to be?

17:07.400 --> 17:11.040
 And again, he's saying, I'm not saying killing a murder is wrong.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.600
 I'm not saying evil is wrong.

17:12.600 --> 17:18.600
 His entire career was dedicated to fighting the concept of evil, but are we the kind of

17:18.600 --> 17:23.960
 people who want to be doing these things that in any other context, we regard as torture

17:23.960 --> 17:25.000
 or depraved?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.720
 So I'm much more of a Camus person than a Sartre person.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.000
 Because he was probably against war in that same way.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
 So I don't have to admit, I don't know much about the political side of Camus.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.840
 Well, and I don't think his political side is that interesting or relevant.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.640
 What I find, sorry to interrupt you, what I find fascinating about Camus and what I

17:42.640 --> 17:48.760
 think about on a daily basis from him is his insistence that you have to live a life based

17:48.760 --> 17:53.040
 on conscience, that you have to be accountable to yourself when you put your head on the

17:53.040 --> 17:59.080
 belt at the end of the day and ask yourself, did I live a righteous life with integrity

17:59.080 --> 18:00.840
 true to my values?

18:00.840 --> 18:06.320
 Did I not needlessly cause harm to innocent people?

18:06.320 --> 18:11.160
 That kind of mindset, did I, if someone is weak, am I using that as an opportunity to

18:11.160 --> 18:13.000
 exploit them or to harm them?

18:13.000 --> 18:17.280
 Or do I feel a bit of sympathy or empathy for this person?

18:17.280 --> 18:23.080
 Because maybe they didn't have circumstances that were as beneficial as other people had.

18:23.080 --> 18:29.720
 Well, how does that fit absurdism where everything is absurd, nothing has meaning, it really

18:29.720 --> 18:31.560
 borders on nihilism.

18:31.560 --> 18:41.320
 So his philosophy explicitly said is a response to nihilism and a attack on nihilism.

18:41.320 --> 18:48.120
 He regrets cynicism as the worst value people can have and I agree with him 100%.

18:48.120 --> 18:53.320
 A lot of times people call me cynical online and I push back very, very hard because to

18:53.320 --> 18:57.240
 be a, you know, I had this quote in the New Right where I said, I'd rather be naive than

18:57.240 --> 19:01.840
 a cynic because a cynic is a hopeless man who projects his hopelessness to the world

19:01.840 --> 19:02.840
 at large.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.520
 Camus, this is the metaphor I use and I find it very inspirational.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.200
 I thought it was in his work, but I guess I thought if it described it to him.

19:11.200 --> 19:17.840
 There's two types of people, you imagine you go to a mountainside and you see a blank canvas

19:17.840 --> 19:21.160
 on an easel standing in front of this mountainside.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.880
 One people be like, why is this blank canvas here, you know, what was this, what's going

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
 on here?

19:26.880 --> 19:31.960
 And just be confused, whereas the other type of person will be like, there's a blank canvas

19:31.960 --> 19:35.640
 here in this beautiful countryside, what a great opportunity.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.360
 I can paint this river, I could paint that bird, I could paint my friends or myself in

19:40.360 --> 19:45.240
 the background, infinite choices and this is a gift that I have been given.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.160
 And I think that also ties very heavily into what I was, I went to Yeshiva as a kid, which

19:49.160 --> 19:50.400
 is Jewish school.

19:50.400 --> 19:56.840
 What we were taught incessantly how to look at life is this beautiful gift that God has

19:56.840 --> 19:59.960
 given you and that God wants you to be happy.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.400
 He wants you to live to the fullest in a moral way.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.160
 I remember the first time I went into a church and they were asking questions about the Jewish

20:08.160 --> 20:11.000
 concept, the afterlife, they weren't familiar with Jewish thought.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.200
 And it took me a second because I didn't really have answers.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.280
 And then I remembered what we were taught, which is, let's suppose you're at this banquet,

20:18.280 --> 20:22.320
 the best chef on earth and the table's so heavy because you've got steaks and you've

20:22.320 --> 20:29.120
 got chicken and you've got sushi and the wine's flowing and you've got your Dr. Pepper and

20:29.120 --> 20:31.760
 Mr. Pib and the store brand, everything you want.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.840
 And you're looking around at this amazing bounty, right?

20:34.840 --> 20:39.080
 And then you turn to this best chef on earth and you're like, oh, so what's for dessert?

20:39.080 --> 20:44.400
 I mean, the offensiveness of that is just so insane.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.800
 You have this, eat the meal.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.120
 I promise you, if I could deliver this meal, the dessert's going to be okay.

20:50.120 --> 20:56.720
 So this focus on the afterlife when we've been given this amazing gift on this earth

20:56.720 --> 21:01.640
 is a very different mindset from both the Jewish tradition as I've been taught and the

21:01.640 --> 21:02.640
 Camus mindset.

21:02.640 --> 21:06.280
 And obviously Camus was an atheist, didn't believe in an afterlife, but this concept

21:06.280 --> 21:15.040
 that life is meaningless, but that means you have that opportunity to find value, to seek

21:15.040 --> 21:17.560
 for truth, to seek for happiness.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.080
 And Camus has this quote, it's ascribed to him, it's like a meme.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.080
 I've never found the source, so maybe he doesn't really say it, but he says, maybe it's not

21:24.080 --> 21:26.760
 about happy endings, maybe it's about the journey.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.920
 And I think when you have that mindset, and as you and I, I think you and I have both

21:29.920 --> 21:34.640
 found this because neither of us, when we were kids, thought we'd be doing this, right?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.320
 But now that we are really fortunate.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.320
 Definitely this.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.320
 Yeah.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.320
 And definitely that.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.320
 Yeah.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.160
 But now that we're fortunate enough to do this and that we're blessed enough that there's

21:43.160 --> 21:47.240
 people who find this of value and interest and we could pay the rent doing this, there's

21:47.240 --> 21:53.240
 not a day that goes by where I don't think you and I think this is pretty absurd.

21:53.240 --> 21:59.080
 But it's also pretty wonderful and as a consequence of us thriving, it also shows other people

21:59.080 --> 22:01.920
 that happiness is possible on this earth.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.080
 And I think cynicism is the lie.

22:05.080 --> 22:10.120
 It's not just a world view, it's a lie that happiness is not possible on this earth.

22:10.120 --> 22:15.920
 Or it's only possible if you sell your soul and you're like a bad person, you screw other

22:15.920 --> 22:17.200
 people over.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.960
 I reject that in every aspect.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.880
 You know, as you said, my birth is coming up.

22:21.880 --> 22:27.320
 I've been feeling just a lot of really great things have been happening very, very recently.

22:27.320 --> 22:33.200
 So it affects me very heavily emotionally, especially when I see the response it gives

22:33.200 --> 22:36.120
 to the kids.

22:36.120 --> 22:41.160
 So it's one thing to say, this is what I'm for, but when you can provide proof of concept

22:41.160 --> 22:46.080
 that what you've been advocating does result in positive responses, I got a message from

22:46.080 --> 22:50.280
 this kid who had tried to kill himself a year ago.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.520
 And then he was like, look, I found your work.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.000
 I found some other stuff.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.560
 And now I realize I'm going to make something of myself.

22:56.560 --> 23:02.240
 I was born in a meth house, you know, whatever, 19, 20 years old, I should be in the garbage,

23:02.240 --> 23:06.600
 but I'm going to try to be a standup because I have opportunity on this earth.

23:06.600 --> 23:12.000
 Even if he fails as a standup, you know, he's still such whatever he does, washing dishes,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.640
 there's no shame in that.

23:13.640 --> 23:18.400
 Is it so bad to have a crappy job and a girlfriend who you don't really like?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.000
 But as compared to the alternative of like, I'm going to kill myself.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
 This is heaven.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.560
 Well, I think there's beauty to be discovered in all of it, in all of those experiences.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
 Yes.

23:28.560 --> 23:34.960
 So, but at the same time, so I often think about, I just recently reread the idiot by

23:34.960 --> 23:36.200
 Dostoyevsky.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.120
 I often feel like the idiot.

23:38.120 --> 23:43.280
 That's why when I say I'm an idiot, I often think about Prince Mishkin, that kind of idiot,

23:43.280 --> 23:45.160
 which the world sees you as naive.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.320
 I don't think he's naive.

23:46.320 --> 23:51.960
 I don't think I'm naive, but I tend to see the good in people and the good in every

23:51.960 --> 24:00.760
 moment and the world often is cynical and in fact, especially in what we do, often the

24:00.760 --> 24:04.320
 intellectual is supposed to be cynical.

24:04.320 --> 24:10.880
 This is very much an urban elite educated mindset where if you write a book about someone

24:10.880 --> 24:15.640
 who's let's suppose a drug addict or a prostitute, that has heft and that's valid.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.120
 But if you're writing a book about like a love story, you know, two people fall in love

24:19.120 --> 24:23.000
 and they're on roller coasters or carousels, that's less legitimate.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
 I hate that.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
 I hate that.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.880
 I hate that so much because the message it gives to people is you have to choose between

24:29.880 --> 24:34.440
 thriving and happiness and silliness and seriousness and depravity.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.800
 And I'm not saying a drug addict or a prostitute is depraved, but they're basically their worldviews.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.000
 If it's unless it's dark and twisted, it doesn't really count as art.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
 And I despise that mindset, that subtext.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.760
 So the internet and people around me often will call me naive because I don't know.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.040
 But the word they want is innocent, don't you think?

24:50.040 --> 24:51.040
 It's a better word.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.040
 But it's not that innocent.

24:52.040 --> 24:56.480
 No, but innocent in that you genuinely in your heart, I know you fairly well at this

24:56.480 --> 25:02.480
 point, believe that goodness is possible and that people can, if not be good, at least

25:02.480 --> 25:04.040
 be better than they were yesterday.

25:04.040 --> 25:09.920
 See, even the word naive or the word innocent presumes that there's not wisdom in that.

25:09.920 --> 25:16.200
 Presumes that somehow that's, oh, isn't that beautiful to live that life of a child who

25:16.200 --> 25:21.280
 sees the world with these bright eyes and is hopeful about the future, but just wait

25:21.280 --> 25:26.080
 until they go up and realize that reality is much harsher than they think.

25:26.080 --> 25:31.360
 But that child might be wiser than all of the adults in the room.

25:31.360 --> 25:35.440
 And don't you, don't you want to be, if the world is like that, don't you want to be the

25:35.440 --> 25:39.160
 guy who takes it on and changes it for the better, right?

25:39.160 --> 25:42.360
 So it's like saying, well, you know, cancer is everywhere.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
 It's inevitable.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.840
 Well, don't you want to be the one who says not anymore?

25:45.840 --> 25:51.320
 I'm here and I'm going to make that change and I can see it being better than it is now.

25:51.320 --> 25:58.240
 So I think you and I have the same analysis of your worldview and I don't think that there

25:58.240 --> 25:59.960
 is a good word for it.

25:59.960 --> 26:04.520
 So I guess it's this idea of, you know, inherent benevolence might be, you know, maybe wordy,

26:04.520 --> 26:08.640
 but I think that's more accurate because, you know, you and I did not have such easy

26:08.640 --> 26:11.280
 lives growing up to put it mildly.

26:11.280 --> 26:16.000
 You constantly talk about just horrific aspects of life.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.080
 So to claim that you kind of don't know that they exist or you sweep on the rug is completely

26:20.080 --> 26:25.160
 not accurate to your work and your mindset.

26:25.160 --> 26:29.760
 Can we talk about World War II and the Soviet Union?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.760
 Sure.

26:31.760 --> 26:41.260
 So on Sunday, June 22nd, 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, which was the surprising

26:41.260 --> 26:44.000
 invasion of the Soviet Union.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
 If I could read to you a few lyrics from a song that, for some reason, has stuck throughout

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
 my childhood.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
 It was a famous song during that time.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.440
 On June 22nd, exactly four o clock, Kiev was bombed, we were announced that the war

27:02.440 --> 27:03.440
 began.

27:03.440 --> 27:21.680
 The song talks about that moment as part of that operation that Kiev was first bombed

27:21.680 --> 27:24.520
 and it was announced on June 22nd.

27:24.520 --> 27:28.880
 The song says at exactly four o clock that the war has begun.

27:28.880 --> 27:39.760
 For some reason, this song haunts me because the exactness of that time and this realization

27:39.760 --> 27:46.380
 that at any moment you can have this thing happen to you in your own personal life, maybe

27:46.380 --> 27:52.820
 we'll have something like 9 11 happen where everything changes and it's just like haunting

27:52.820 --> 27:57.940
 because it makes me think that at any moment something like that could happen that changes

27:57.940 --> 28:05.620
 everything and I just think about like normal life going on in Kiev at the time and then

28:05.620 --> 28:10.700
 all of a sudden the bombs are dropping and they announced that the war has begun and

28:10.700 --> 28:22.980
 you thought you were going to stay out of the war.

28:22.980 --> 28:28.740
 This is something that is very intensely emotional for me because you and I are both Russian

28:28.740 --> 28:37.940
 Jewish so to know that my grandparents and my great grandma were told that the Nazis

28:37.940 --> 28:45.140
 are coming and this was an address rehearsal and that if they get here, which they do,

28:45.140 --> 28:50.660
 they did live up is very Western Ukraine that 100% you and all your relatives are going

28:50.660 --> 29:01.700
 to be murdered and there's a monument now in Lviv where I'm from about this but I don't

29:01.700 --> 29:11.740
 think either of us can imagine what it's like to know, to think that we're about minutes

29:11.740 --> 29:19.540
 or whatever hours or there's just the Russian army standing between us and everyone we are

29:19.540 --> 29:29.620
 related to are going to be murdered for no reason and what's the closure here, right?

29:29.620 --> 29:36.260
 They evacuated a lot of people but they didn't evacuate enough and to know that there is this

29:36.260 --> 29:40.740
 force coming to 100% murder you.

29:40.740 --> 29:45.940
 This isn't some kind of the TV news being hyperbolic.

29:45.940 --> 29:52.820
 They're coming to kill you and if they get you, they will kill you and we all think about

29:52.820 --> 29:59.980
 war like, oh, we hope America wins in Iraq but if America got their ass kicked in Vietnam,

29:59.980 --> 30:04.220
 it's not really going to affect America in the sense that you're going to have the body

30:04.220 --> 30:08.100
 bags and all the kids being killed and that's something I'm not sleeping in the rug but

30:08.100 --> 30:12.260
 no one in America thought the Vietnamese are going to come here and kill them, right?

30:12.260 --> 30:14.580
 They were secure in their person.

30:14.580 --> 30:24.580
 To have that sense of we really need to win because if we don't win, we are 100% if they,

30:24.580 --> 30:30.820
 the Russian army doesn't win, we are 100% all going to be slaughtered and often not just

30:30.820 --> 30:36.820
 a bullet to the head in insidistic ways is something that to know that people who share

30:36.820 --> 30:45.500
 my blood saw and went through is very hard for me to kind of wrap my head around.

30:45.500 --> 30:52.940
 And there's no possibility to delude yourself because, I mean, they would, as the song also

30:52.940 --> 30:56.620
 talks about, but they would burn the factories.

30:56.620 --> 31:00.100
 So it's basically saying, we're in the war now.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.780
 This is like, this is your life.

31:02.780 --> 31:03.780
 This is our life now.

31:03.780 --> 31:08.460
 You know how yesterday you were worried about, like, oh, I misplaced my pen, where is it?

31:08.460 --> 31:11.780
 It's like, yeah, this was paradise.

31:11.780 --> 31:18.580
 Most of us are going to, our life now is that most of us are going to die and if we want

31:18.580 --> 31:23.820
 to prevent all of us from dying, we have to fight.

31:23.820 --> 31:30.940
 And we also can't sit down in some kind of weird desert island or plain crash situation

31:30.940 --> 31:34.380
 and be like, let's decide between us who's going to be the first to die.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.860
 Maybe the Titanic, that's Titanic, right?

31:36.860 --> 31:40.180
 They sat down and they're like women and children in the lifeboats.

31:40.180 --> 31:41.780
 They had this rational agreement.

31:41.780 --> 31:44.540
 You don't have those choices in a war.

31:44.540 --> 31:51.540
 So it's something that I, it's just very chilling.

31:51.540 --> 31:58.300
 And it's something I don't really have the emotional space to understand or grapple with.

31:58.300 --> 32:04.420
 You know, obviously I've been to North Korea, you can see it and so on and so forth.

32:04.420 --> 32:10.100
 You and I can't, or anyone listening to this, except for maybe on me and people like that,

32:10.100 --> 32:13.100
 you can't imagine what that's like to live it.

32:13.100 --> 32:18.420
 We can't, we can't imagine what it's like to live in those situations where it's not

32:18.420 --> 32:23.340
 like before Hitler came, everyone's, you know, dancing around and having a great time.

32:23.340 --> 32:29.340
 I mean, imagine how what that life is like where your preference to Hitler is starving

32:29.340 --> 32:33.620
 and waiting online for hours for bread and to have the secret police and your friend's

32:33.620 --> 32:36.580
 attorney you went and your phones are all tapped and your prisoner.

32:36.580 --> 32:40.460
 But to you, this is infinitely better than the alternative.

32:40.460 --> 32:45.140
 Like these are the choices that, you know, our family had to deal with.

32:45.140 --> 32:50.020
 It's something that no matter how much you, it's like a, let me put it in terms of people

32:50.020 --> 32:51.300
 to understand, you know what I mean?

32:51.300 --> 32:53.740
 It's like your first bad breakup, right?

32:53.740 --> 32:57.740
 Like that's a much simpler thing to wrap your head around because it's like, if you've

32:57.740 --> 33:01.980
 never had it, you can't really, but when you feel that it's just so intense, but you can't

33:01.980 --> 33:07.340
 tell someone what's like, we could sit down for days and hours and have people tell us.

33:07.340 --> 33:13.420
 But until it's the totality of your environment and your life and your mindset, I remember

33:13.420 --> 33:30.220
 my grandma, she would talk about it like, when you're that hungry, all you're thinking

33:30.220 --> 33:33.220
 about is bread.

33:33.220 --> 33:37.260
 Because your brain won't let, you know, human beings, you know, we're evolved, we have instincts,

33:37.260 --> 33:42.700
 whatever, and the mind is telling you food, food, food, food, food, food.

33:42.700 --> 33:48.940
 And that there's kids thinking this and that they're not going to get the food.

33:48.940 --> 33:54.340
 And imagine being a parent and your kids watching your kids without food and knowing they're

33:54.340 --> 33:56.580
 not going to get the food.

33:56.580 --> 34:05.060
 And the fact that this happened in North Korea in the 90s, I met a refugee and he had to

34:05.060 --> 34:07.580
 watch his dad starve to death.

34:07.580 --> 34:11.340
 And thank you.

34:11.340 --> 34:19.540
 And we have no concept of what it's like.

34:19.540 --> 34:25.500
 I mean, we kind of, you know, it's just like last night here in Austin, all the places

34:25.500 --> 34:28.620
 were closed and I couldn't get my protein powder.

34:28.620 --> 34:33.580
 And this is the extent of my suffering when it comes to food, you know.

34:33.580 --> 34:38.540
 Or if I couldn't, there was a restaurant that I went to in Brooklyn where for some

34:38.540 --> 34:42.340
 of the cocktails reason, they weren't serving sashimi, they only had sushi.

34:42.340 --> 34:47.340
 So I had to have the rice and the carbs to live a life where that is the extent of your

34:47.340 --> 34:55.220
 food problems as opposed to the choices either Hitler killing you or being hungry 24 seven.

34:55.220 --> 34:59.700
 You know, my grandma told this story of how they had a close call.

34:59.700 --> 35:04.100
 It was her and her brother and her mom, my great grandma who passed.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.780
 And I think there was like either a helicopter overhead or something.

35:06.780 --> 35:12.780
 And my great grandma jumped on top of my grandma's brother and not my grandma.

35:12.780 --> 35:18.900
 So she basically did a Sophie's choice, my grandma's name is Sophia and chose the brother.

35:18.900 --> 35:23.300
 And this is something that she felt, you know, all her life that her mom had chosen her brother

35:23.300 --> 35:24.500
 over her.

35:24.500 --> 35:29.300
 But these little things that happen, these little kind of a decisions we have to make

35:29.300 --> 35:35.660
 in war, there's a book I read called Five Chimneys, I think this woman who was an Auschwitz

35:35.660 --> 35:37.100
 survivor.

35:37.100 --> 35:42.460
 And what she talked about what people don't appreciate, it's not necessarily the slaughter

35:42.460 --> 35:43.460
 and the torture.

35:43.460 --> 35:46.340
 It's that there's no rhyme or reason to it.

35:46.340 --> 35:51.620
 She talked about how they had a camp just for people from Czechoslovakia and they were

35:51.620 --> 35:53.540
 treated better than the Jews.

35:53.540 --> 35:55.700
 And then one day they just killed them all, right?

35:55.700 --> 36:00.060
 And she's like, I still don't understand why they're giving them food and treating them

36:00.060 --> 36:01.060
 well.

36:01.060 --> 36:04.140
 And then the next day they're all killed and we will never get answers, you know.

36:04.140 --> 36:11.500
 And she's, and things like she talks about how they decided to kill all the kids and

36:11.500 --> 36:15.420
 they didn't really, either for some reason, they didn't have the courage to or they wanted

36:15.420 --> 36:16.420
 to be cruel.

36:16.420 --> 36:20.180
 So instead of shooting them, they just kept walking them in the snow until they all died.

36:20.180 --> 36:26.300
 So it's things like this, that the fact that you and I dodged these bullets and that we

36:26.300 --> 36:33.140
 can be here and be doing this and, you know, running our mouths for a living, I think about

36:33.140 --> 36:34.300
 it all the time.

36:34.300 --> 36:43.460
 And it's just very disturbing to know, and I know you know this as well, that there's

36:43.460 --> 36:47.700
 lots of places on earth where if people had a choice, they would kill us on site and be

36:47.700 --> 36:49.140
 proud of themselves for it.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.140
 Yeah.

36:50.140 --> 36:52.740
 I don't know what to make of the contrast.

36:52.740 --> 36:58.980
 You were talking about the fact that you've been truly happy the last few weeks and months.

36:58.980 --> 36:59.980
 Yes.

36:59.980 --> 37:06.500
 You know, a lot of moments of happiness and joy, and that joy is built on a history of

37:06.500 --> 37:11.980
 human suffering, like in your roots, in your blood, is a lot of people that were tortured

37:11.980 --> 37:14.580
 that suffered so that you could have this joy.

37:14.580 --> 37:20.020
 And you have both the, you have the responsibility to truly be grateful for that joy.

37:20.020 --> 37:24.260
 But it also shows that there's the happy ending, that it does end in a good note, that it does

37:24.260 --> 37:27.900
 get infinitely, infinitely better.

37:27.900 --> 37:31.820
 And that I think there's a, I don't like you saying there were responsibility, but there

37:31.820 --> 37:40.060
 is an opportunity for those of us who did dodge that bullet to give testimony to these

37:40.060 --> 37:46.340
 people, and more importantly, to give testimony to the people who are going through this now.

37:46.340 --> 37:51.820
 So one of the reasons I talk about North Korea so much, why I wrote Dear Reader, is because

37:51.820 --> 37:56.580
 it's very easy, and this is human nature, I'm not condemning people.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.620
 I think that's just how people are wired.

37:58.620 --> 38:04.340
 When you see an Asian country with Asian people, and things are bad over there, I think in

38:04.340 --> 38:08.620
 the West, it's like, oh, Asia, they're all crazy, they're wacky, they eat dogs or so

38:08.620 --> 38:12.900
 on and so forth, some weird stereotype, and they think of them as kind of Martians.

38:12.900 --> 38:18.860
 So it's important for people who aren't of that kind of ancestry to kind of speak on

38:18.860 --> 38:22.740
 behalf of these people, because it's very different how just people just naturally act

38:22.740 --> 38:29.380
 when you have a Westerner talking about this, instead of becoming them over there, it becomes,

38:29.380 --> 38:31.740
 this could have been us very easily.

38:31.740 --> 38:36.380
 I have a friend, Peter, they hand ski great dude, and I was showing him photos when I was

38:36.380 --> 38:40.300
 in Pyongyang, and he goes, this looks like a Russian city with Asian people.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.620
 It completely disturbed him.

38:42.620 --> 38:46.540
 So that was one of the reasons I did go to North Korea, because that was as close as

38:46.540 --> 38:50.780
 I would get to see what your family went through, to see what my family went through, and they're

38:50.780 --> 38:54.660
 still living under this regime.

38:54.660 --> 38:58.580
 And one of the things I fought very hard to do with Dear Reader, which I was successful

38:58.580 --> 39:02.860
 in amazingly, and it just, I said, I could die now.

39:02.860 --> 39:08.100
 I feel like if you just move the needle a little bit, then you've kind of paid your

39:08.100 --> 39:14.540
 due for your time here on this earth to have it change from being a laughing stock.

39:14.540 --> 39:17.180
 And I think Team America did a good job.

39:17.180 --> 39:22.220
 They made Kim Jong Il into a clown, and they made a joke of it, but you're going from nothing

39:22.220 --> 39:23.220
 to jokes.

39:23.220 --> 39:26.100
 At least now people are aware of it, that it exists, right?

39:26.100 --> 39:32.020
 And then I, and many others, took it from a joke to like, guys, this is really, really,

39:32.020 --> 39:35.540
 really bad, and none of us can even appreciate how bad it is.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.940
 And I think now there is an understanding, other than a few people who are just looking

39:38.940 --> 39:42.020
 at it through a Trump lens and wanting Trump to fail, because Trump's an asshole, and that's

39:42.020 --> 39:45.140
 fine, to be like these poor people.

39:45.140 --> 39:50.340
 And it's really unfortunate because there's a segment of a Western culture who thinks

39:50.340 --> 39:57.020
 that, correctly, often when you're complaining about, or discussing the plight of another

39:57.020 --> 40:01.140
 country, that's just your prelude to war and an excuse to invade.

40:01.140 --> 40:04.380
 Like the Kurds in Syria, you know, we talked about, if we don't in Syria tomorrow, it's

40:04.380 --> 40:06.380
 going to be another genocide, blah, blah.

40:06.380 --> 40:09.260
 I'm not saying let's invade North Korea and things like that.

40:09.260 --> 40:14.460
 All I'm saying is, you know, thank God that this isn't your life.

40:14.460 --> 40:15.940
 I bring this up all the time.

40:15.940 --> 40:21.340
 The woman who was my guide when I was there, I'm aware of what she's up to now.

40:21.340 --> 40:26.980
 She's still, she's extremely rich by North Korean standards, but she'll never be in a

40:26.980 --> 40:28.620
 position to buy medicine.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.540
 She'll never be in a position to go on a vacation.

40:31.540 --> 40:36.420
 Things that you and I just, you know, whatever, she can't go on the internet.

40:36.420 --> 40:39.240
 She can't get an encyclopedia.

40:39.240 --> 40:43.980
 She can't better herself as a person other than through what the state allows and meaning

40:43.980 --> 40:47.220
 better yourself as a person in service to the state.

40:47.220 --> 40:52.820
 So I mean, there's, it's also frustrating because there's only so much that I can do

40:52.820 --> 40:54.460
 as an individual.

40:54.460 --> 40:59.220
 What's your takeaway about human nature from looking at North Korea and looking at how

40:59.220 --> 41:01.900
 the rest of the world is looking at North Korea?

41:01.900 --> 41:03.700
 I always, this is a great question.

41:03.700 --> 41:08.020
 I think about it fairly often and I always say human beings are animals, right?

41:08.020 --> 41:12.460
 When you say someone's an animal, it's like a slur, like he's like a beast.

41:12.460 --> 41:17.740
 Animals are capable of enormous kindness, empathy, sympathy, you know, they look out

41:17.740 --> 41:19.940
 for one another, groom one another.

41:19.940 --> 41:24.380
 There's a thing with apes where they groom each other for parasites and you're, even

41:24.380 --> 41:28.660
 if there are no parasites, they pretend there's parasites just to have that kind of bonding.

41:28.660 --> 41:34.940
 You see infinite photos online of like cats raising puppies because the puppies mom died,

41:34.940 --> 41:35.940
 things like this.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.420
 That's part of being an animal.

41:37.420 --> 41:42.500
 Part of being an animal is also just the most monstrous cruelty.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.340
 Killer whales, you know, there's this big PC move to not call them killer whales and

41:46.340 --> 41:47.780
 just call them orcas.

41:47.780 --> 41:53.860
 They will murder blue whale pups, calves, excuse me, and play with them and not even

41:53.860 --> 41:54.860
 eat them.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.700
 So they just murder for the sake of fun.

41:56.700 --> 42:00.740
 So there's, and cats, you know, kill birds all the time, things like this.

42:00.740 --> 42:03.300
 So it runs the whole gamut.

42:03.300 --> 42:07.780
 And I think it's, you know, when you're on and I were on your show, I don't think Lord

42:07.780 --> 42:08.780
 the Flies is accurate.

42:08.780 --> 42:14.140
 I don't think Hobbes is how reality works when you're in that kind of state.

42:14.140 --> 42:21.220
 But I think we've seen countless examples of human beings, especially when human beings

42:21.220 --> 42:28.020
 have power over someone who's powerless of allowing themselves to engage in not just

42:28.020 --> 42:34.900
 harm, but cruelty, and that is something as Soviet, you and I are very painfully aware

42:34.900 --> 42:35.900
 of it.

42:35.900 --> 42:40.660
 It's not just about the oppression, which as bad enough as it is, it's that mediocre

42:40.660 --> 42:43.780
 person with that little bit of power.

42:43.780 --> 42:49.860
 And now they're standing between you and your daughter having medicine and they love it

42:49.860 --> 42:55.420
 to make you dance to be like, oh, you need me to get this medicine, make you go through

42:55.420 --> 42:58.900
 hoops, because now they feel like for the first time in their life, they're in a position

42:58.900 --> 43:00.180
 of strength and power.

43:00.180 --> 43:05.380
 I think that is in many ways the more common nature of evil that what Hannah Arendt talks

43:05.380 --> 43:09.420
 about the banality of evil, then someone who's like an SS guard, you're shooting someone

43:09.420 --> 43:10.420
 in the head.

43:10.420 --> 43:14.780
 Like that, I think we could all wrap our heads around to some extent, like, okay, I'm a military.

43:14.780 --> 43:15.780
 It's not easy.

43:15.780 --> 43:17.540
 I have to execute people pulling a trigger.

43:17.540 --> 43:20.860
 You could kind of have this mental disconnect between the finger and the victim.

43:20.860 --> 43:24.220
 But like that little day to day stuff, like, are you doing the right thing on a day to

43:24.220 --> 43:29.500
 day basis that I think is far more common and far more disturbing aspect in certain senses

43:29.500 --> 43:31.100
 of the human psyche?

43:31.100 --> 43:43.300
 Yeah, there's something especially disturbing about a weak man given power and just abusing

43:43.300 --> 43:44.300
 that power.

43:44.300 --> 43:49.500
 There's something about not just weak, but like mediocre at everything it does or less

43:49.500 --> 43:50.500
 than mediocre.

43:50.500 --> 43:55.060
 A great example of this, which I'm also talking about in the next book is Ceausescu, who was

43:55.060 --> 43:57.820
 the dictator of Romania.

43:57.820 --> 44:03.780
 The Cold War is still somewhat poorly understood in popular culture, but the different countries

44:03.780 --> 44:07.940
 in the second world, the Soviet bloc, some are more liberal than others, some are more

44:07.940 --> 44:08.940
 sane than others.

44:08.940 --> 44:14.100
 Ceausescu at first was one of the more Western friendly, more of the free ones.

44:14.100 --> 44:17.820
 Then he met the great leader Kim Il Sung from North Korea, and he had the idea to impose

44:17.820 --> 44:22.380
 a personality cult on Romania, and it's the kind of things like forcing people to breed

44:22.380 --> 44:24.460
 because he wanted to make people taller.

44:24.460 --> 44:28.260
 I think he made like the biggest building in all of Europe, the people's palace, but

44:28.260 --> 44:31.940
 it was just for him, bothers no electricity elsewhere.

44:31.940 --> 44:34.700
 But you look at this guy, Stalin's a badass, right?

44:34.700 --> 44:35.700
 He was a bank robber.

44:35.700 --> 44:40.540
 If you look at photos of him as a kid, he was a hunk, Lenin was clearly intellectual.

44:40.540 --> 44:46.140
 These were powerful men with huge egos, huge force of personality.

44:46.140 --> 44:52.100
 So you look at this Ceausescu guy, and you could, like for example, on my driver's license,

44:52.100 --> 44:57.180
 instead of my address, I'm like in my real address, being like 12345th Avenue, by mistake

44:57.180 --> 44:59.860
 it says 12345th Street, right?

44:59.860 --> 45:04.060
 So you can imagine him being in the post office and me giving him my ID to get my package

45:04.060 --> 45:08.580
 and him being baffled because this says Street, this says Avenue instead of Understand, and

45:08.580 --> 45:12.900
 the look on his face, this dullard that you can see how, you know how sometimes I'm going

45:12.900 --> 45:14.140
 to connect hers?

45:14.140 --> 45:15.140
 Fuck yes.

45:15.140 --> 45:16.140
 Yeah.

45:16.140 --> 45:18.460
 So if you know like how if you're in the airport and you see someone and you look at them an

45:18.460 --> 45:22.260
 adult and you think, okay, this person was born fucked up, just like on site, like something's

45:22.260 --> 45:24.060
 wrong with them, how are they traveling alone?

45:24.060 --> 45:28.020
 You look at Ceausescu, you look at him, you're like something's not right with this guy.

45:28.020 --> 45:31.340
 Not in the sense of like evil, but in the sense that he's a simpleton, right?

45:31.340 --> 45:35.140
 And now he's in charge of this whole country and everyone's taught to regard him as one

45:35.140 --> 45:37.420
 of the great geniuses of all time.

45:37.420 --> 45:43.260
 And it's this, the idea of this mediocre nobody, this guy would have in any other culture

45:43.260 --> 45:49.340
 been accomplished nothing or would have had an honest job where he's like, okay, he works

45:49.340 --> 45:52.820
 at the mail service and he's bad at it, okay, fine, he's not hurting anyone.

45:52.820 --> 45:58.420
 And now as a result of this, he's responsible for mass death, secret police and incarceration.

45:58.420 --> 46:03.340
 And you know, one of the greatest things that I've ever seen, which I'm sure many people

46:03.340 --> 46:04.340
 have seen as well.

46:04.340 --> 46:08.620
 If you go on YouTube, it's his speech and it's the first time the crowd turns and his

46:08.620 --> 46:11.940
 head kind of like, because they start booing him, which was unheard of.

46:11.940 --> 46:16.380
 And you know, he was shot with his dog faced wife not that long after, it was just a great

46:16.380 --> 46:17.380
 moment.

46:17.380 --> 46:18.380
 But it's things like this.

46:18.380 --> 46:23.300
 I agree with you that mediocre, weak person is now in a position of power over somebody

46:23.300 --> 46:29.180
 else and that sense of vindictiveness, like I'm going to feel strong for once in my life,

46:29.180 --> 46:31.020
 but it's going to be at your expense.

46:31.020 --> 46:34.620
 That I think is, you know, human nature, it's most primal.

46:34.620 --> 46:39.060
 And every time I meet a person in this world, you're the first person to get me to cry on

46:39.060 --> 46:41.860
 a fucking podcast, fucking the robot gets me to cry.

46:41.860 --> 46:43.420
 What the fuck is going on?

46:43.420 --> 46:52.260
 Every time I meet a weird person, somebody, to me, heroism is also taking a risk to rebel

46:52.260 --> 47:01.300
 against mediocrity, like in the most simplest of ways, like the license address, like taking

47:01.300 --> 47:05.300
 a risk to break the little bit of rule that nobody will know about, to take that little

47:05.300 --> 47:11.100
 bit of a leap of like that little protest against the bureaucracy.

47:11.100 --> 47:15.140
 Like that Nazi guard where he just spoke out, he's like, Hey lady, that's a big one.

47:15.140 --> 47:16.140
 Oh, that's a brochure.

47:16.140 --> 47:21.140
 I mean, like literally at the line at Starbucks or something like that, like even in the tiniest

47:21.140 --> 47:27.100
 of ways, when I see people just like, it's almost like that little like glimmer in their

47:27.100 --> 47:32.020
 eye of wink, like we're in this together, this, there's, there's all this conformity

47:32.020 --> 47:38.780
 all around us that's at a different time could have been Nazi Germany could have been Stalin

47:38.780 --> 47:43.940
 and the Soviet Union, we're in this together, we're going to rebel against that conformity.

47:43.940 --> 47:48.940
 But I just, just taking the risk, that little bit of risk against mediocrity.

47:48.940 --> 47:49.940
 I don't know.

47:49.940 --> 47:55.180
 And that, and then once again, I see this in companies too.

47:55.180 --> 48:00.940
 When I see the mediocrity, I see this, I used to work at Google, I see it in Google.

48:00.940 --> 48:04.580
 When the companies grow, that mediocrity is overwhelming.

48:04.580 --> 48:05.740
 The Peter principle, right?

48:05.740 --> 48:06.740
 The Peter principle.

48:06.740 --> 48:07.740
 Yeah.

48:07.740 --> 48:16.100
 And that is that all of us have the possibility for that glimmer, that risk taking, the leap

48:16.100 --> 48:21.140
 of faith or whatever the heck that is, the leap out of the ordinary, out of the conformity,

48:21.140 --> 48:22.540
 out of the mediocrity.

48:22.540 --> 48:24.860
 So this is where you and I disagree.

48:24.860 --> 48:28.940
 I think most, a lot of people are not capable of that.

48:28.940 --> 48:30.780
 They're accustomed to it.

48:30.780 --> 48:32.540
 I don't know if they're not capable.

48:32.540 --> 48:34.420
 No, I understand your position.

48:34.420 --> 48:35.420
 I'm disagreeing with it.

48:35.420 --> 48:36.860
 I'm saying I do not think they're capable.

48:36.860 --> 48:40.700
 I think a lot of people effectively don't have souls.

48:40.700 --> 48:45.700
 They do not have a conscience in this sense where they're going to look at an issue, bring

48:45.700 --> 48:51.740
 their critical thinking and say, all right, I am going to do the right thing, although

48:51.740 --> 48:52.740
 I'm taking a risk.

48:52.740 --> 48:56.140
 I don't think thinking is involved or is it just taking that leap?

48:56.140 --> 48:58.900
 There's something about that basic human spirit.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.740
 Forget the thinking part.

49:00.740 --> 49:06.180
 It's just saying like, I'll take that risk, taking that adventure, the same thing that

49:06.180 --> 49:14.900
 got people to explore the seas, you know, throughout human civilization, explore land,

49:14.900 --> 49:21.900
 explore the oceans, like that exploration, like we've done stuff this way all this time.

49:21.900 --> 49:23.540
 I'm going to take a leap.

49:23.540 --> 49:24.980
 And that comes out of nowhere, seemingly.

49:24.980 --> 49:30.740
 But those people are the heroes, but I don't think that's universal.

49:30.740 --> 49:33.420
 I'm going to use a very gauche example.

49:33.420 --> 49:37.220
 There was a show called Scare Tactics, which was basically a candid camera, but they would

49:37.220 --> 49:38.220
 scare people.

49:38.220 --> 49:44.460
 They'd have vampires, whatever, a hidden camera in people's reactions.

49:44.460 --> 49:48.740
 But sometimes the prank didn't work out like they expected.

49:48.740 --> 49:53.020
 So there was one where they were hiring the people who were the marks, you know, the contestants,

49:53.020 --> 49:56.420
 so to speak, who hired to be a security guard.

49:56.420 --> 50:00.540
 And you have to watch this factory overnight and you get paid.

50:00.540 --> 50:05.940
 And what the setup was, some people were breaking out of the factory in the middle of the night,

50:05.940 --> 50:10.340
 like in rags, and they were saying they were keeping us prisoner here, blah, blah, blah,

50:10.340 --> 50:12.460
 and just watched the person reaction to this.

50:12.460 --> 50:18.340
 And there was one security guard where he basically forced them back into the building,

50:18.340 --> 50:20.940
 and they're like, they're working us 24 seven, we're getting beaten.

50:20.940 --> 50:24.380
 He's like, I'm here to do a job, get back in there.

50:24.380 --> 50:30.060
 And you watch this, and it never even enters his head to be like, something's wrong here.

50:30.060 --> 50:33.900
 He was given his orders, he's following his orders.

50:33.900 --> 50:37.580
 And to me, that is not uncommon.

50:37.580 --> 50:42.780
 And that person, although they look like you and I, there's something essentially human

50:42.780 --> 50:43.780
 missing with them.

50:43.780 --> 50:49.900
 Now, very quickly, the reaction is, well, it's one step from there to Nazism.

50:49.900 --> 50:54.540
 I don't think it's something that, I'm not saying this person should be killed, but I'm

50:54.540 --> 51:02.660
 just saying to expect that every human being has the capacity to have that defiance, especially

51:02.660 --> 51:06.940
 at a cost of their own life, that I think is not realistic.

51:06.940 --> 51:12.180
 And I, but at the same time, I feel like an octopus on the eighth hand, it is those few

51:12.180 --> 51:20.260
 of us, or if you want to include me in this, who do make these tiny little protests, who

51:20.260 --> 51:25.460
 look the other way when someone is hungry, who's stealing food from the supermarket, right?

51:25.460 --> 51:29.100
 It's like, all right, I'm going to pretend I didn't see anything.

51:29.100 --> 51:37.260
 That, those little elements of heroism are what move humanity forward and demonstrate

51:37.260 --> 51:42.260
 the validity of the human experience, whereas everyone else is kind of like scenery.

51:42.260 --> 51:48.540
 I think almost everybody in the world can derive deep meaning and pleasure from having

51:48.540 --> 51:50.500
 done those courageous acts.

51:50.500 --> 51:55.460
 And I also think they have the capacity to do them, to discover that meaning and happiness.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.540
 So you're the cynic, then why aren't they doing it?

51:57.540 --> 52:05.340
 They haven't gotten a chance to, like I've never tried LSD or DMT, you haven't gotten

52:05.340 --> 52:11.060
 a chance to try this amazing journey, which is taking the risk and rebellience.

52:11.060 --> 52:17.140
 Because as you just said, two minutes ago, everyone has that chance every day to do the

52:17.140 --> 52:18.140
 right thing.

52:18.140 --> 52:21.700
 We have the chance to do a lot of things and we don't realize, there's a lot of stuff

52:21.700 --> 52:26.700
 right in front of our nose that we don't realize, because you have to kind of wake up to it.

52:26.700 --> 52:30.140
 Sometimes you need the catalyst.

52:30.140 --> 52:36.020
 There needs to be some kind of thing that happens that wakes you up.

52:36.020 --> 52:42.460
 The fact that most people don't take the small acts of rebellion doesn't mean they don't

52:42.460 --> 52:49.020
 have the capacity to both do so and to derive a lot of meaning from it.

52:49.020 --> 52:55.100
 Then it's a discussion about how to create societies that get more and more people to

52:55.100 --> 52:59.300
 be free actors and free thinkers.

52:59.300 --> 53:00.740
 That's the question.

53:00.740 --> 53:03.500
 That probably leads us into a discussion of anarchism and so on.

53:03.500 --> 53:07.460
 But I just think we are very young as a species.

53:07.460 --> 53:14.460
 We're trying to figure out how to get ourselves to first be collaborative, but at the same

53:14.460 --> 53:16.460
 time be free spirits.

53:16.460 --> 53:19.460
 I think both of those are within human nature for most of us.

53:19.460 --> 53:25.900
 I think another big concern is that there's enormous disincentives, and this is Michael

53:25.900 --> 53:31.980
 Malis speaking, for human beings to be kind and for tenderness.

53:31.980 --> 53:37.300
 I think especially when you're young, when you're immature, a lot of times someone will

53:37.300 --> 53:42.460
 reach out to you with kindness or vulnerability, and you think it's funny to dunk the head

53:42.460 --> 53:44.900
 on the water in a pool or something like that.

53:44.900 --> 53:50.940
 When you get older, there's this one example of this.

53:50.940 --> 53:57.060
 This was in the 90s, and there was a woman, she became a stripper or something like that

53:57.060 --> 53:59.260
 or whatever it was, but she had this amazing body.

53:59.260 --> 54:01.220
 She was just gorgeous.

54:01.220 --> 54:05.980
 The show was, she was talking about how when she was in high school, she was bullied a lot,

54:05.980 --> 54:10.140
 and that there was this football player, he messed with her every single day, and at one

54:10.140 --> 54:13.100
 day she even threw pickles in her hair, and her hair smelled like pickles, and it was

54:13.100 --> 54:14.620
 laughing at her.

54:14.620 --> 54:18.900
 This really screwed her up, up to that show, and they took her backstage, and they brought

54:18.900 --> 54:19.900
 out the football player.

54:19.900 --> 54:25.420
 Now, he's a dad and a regular dude, and he's like, do you know why you're here?

54:25.420 --> 54:26.420
 He's like, no.

54:26.420 --> 54:27.660
 They're like, oh, what were you like in high school?

54:27.660 --> 54:30.180
 I was kind of a jock bully, whatever.

54:30.180 --> 54:34.620
 They brought her out, and he didn't even remember her really, and she just starts crying about

54:34.620 --> 54:38.700
 the pickles and whatever, and there's something that affected her for 20 years, and I've never

54:38.700 --> 54:43.540
 seen a clear example of someone who wanted to kill themselves in this guy.

54:43.540 --> 54:48.620
 The guilt on his face, and he's looking at her, and he's desperate to be like, what can

54:48.620 --> 54:54.180
 I do to take your pain away, to make it better?

54:54.180 --> 54:57.100
 He was just crippled by it, because he knew there's nothing he could do.

54:57.100 --> 54:59.660
 He knew he 100% did the wrong thing.

54:59.660 --> 55:02.300
 He knew he did the wrong thing unthinkingly.

55:02.300 --> 55:08.500
 You can imagine, I got to screw over this lady to feed my family, that's fine.

55:08.500 --> 55:11.860
 At the time, it meant nothing to him, so of course, he didn't remember, and he was just

55:11.860 --> 55:14.580
 paralyzed by this sense of crippling guilt.

55:14.580 --> 55:19.260
 One of the reasons I always tried to do the right thing isn't because I'm an inherently

55:19.260 --> 55:21.420
 good person, which I do not think I am.

55:21.420 --> 55:26.340
 I don't think anyone is inherently good, but because I will feel guilty about it for a

55:26.340 --> 55:31.780
 very, very long time, because if you do the wrong thing, this is a very Camus idea, if

55:31.780 --> 55:38.660
 you do the wrong thing to a good person, that's really, really bad, because what kind of person

55:38.660 --> 55:39.660
 are you?

55:39.660 --> 55:44.220
 In the same way that everyone can be that guy who takes someone out for their birthday,

55:44.220 --> 55:48.620
 everyone has that ability for someone who did the wrong thing to someone who is a normal

55:48.620 --> 55:52.100
 person, and do you want to be that guy as well?

55:52.100 --> 55:58.420
 My friend, Bitstein, he's a Bitcoin person.

55:58.420 --> 56:04.500
 My biography, Ego and Hubris, is $500 now in eBay, it's hard to find, came out in 2006.

56:04.500 --> 56:11.140
 He had told me that you can get it on Torrent, it's downloadable, and I'm like, oh, I thought

56:11.140 --> 56:16.020
 if you were my friend, you'd want to buy it, at the time, it was not $500, I assure you.

56:16.020 --> 56:20.100
 He goes, I did buy it, I'm just telling you that you could also get it for free, this

56:20.100 --> 56:23.300
 information that you might want to use.

56:23.300 --> 56:30.460
 I'm like, I snapped at this kid who was doing right by me, and I felt, it just stuck in

56:30.460 --> 56:32.780
 my head, I'm like, you're an ass.

56:32.780 --> 56:36.140
 And then years later, I apologize, he didn't have no memory of this at all, and I'm glad

56:36.140 --> 56:38.300
 to be able to reiterate the apology again.

56:38.300 --> 56:45.860
 But a lot of times I'm extremely aggressive on Twitter and in other venues, I always try

56:45.860 --> 56:51.580
 to, and maybe I fail, and that's my moral failing, always do it as a counterattack.

56:51.580 --> 56:55.380
 If you're going to start going personal, if you're going to start being aggressive against

56:55.380 --> 57:00.340
 an individual, I'm not going to necessarily hold back when I reciprocate.

57:00.340 --> 57:05.660
 And it's something that is very common on social media, but I don't think it is normal.

57:05.660 --> 57:09.380
 Just because a lot of, this is what you were talking about, the quiet little rebellion,

57:09.380 --> 57:13.780
 just because everyone else around you thinks it's okay to just go up to people and attack

57:13.780 --> 57:18.860
 them in the most personal ways, impromptu, because of their views, really just take a

57:18.860 --> 57:20.860
 step back and realize what you're engaging with.

57:20.860 --> 57:26.780
 Now, if that's the fight they want, then my Soviet cruelty can come out, and that's kind

57:26.780 --> 57:29.540
 of why I don't drink, because I do enjoy it.

57:29.540 --> 57:33.580
 But at the same time, be aware of what you're doing.

57:33.580 --> 57:39.180
 And again, this goes back to Camus's sense that the conscience really is what makes us

57:39.180 --> 57:40.180
 human beings.

57:40.180 --> 57:44.420
 But that's the thing we're saying, I don't think most people think in terms of conscience.

57:44.420 --> 57:50.580
 They don't think it, we are taught, this is that creeping cynicism, that, oh, grow up

57:50.580 --> 57:55.540
 when you're an adult, you have to make sacrifices, blah, blah, blah.

57:55.540 --> 57:58.060
 And even if I buy that for a second, which I don't.

57:58.060 --> 58:02.820
 But if I have to make sacrifices sometimes, that doesn't mean it's okay for me to make

58:02.820 --> 58:06.500
 a sacrifice of my values in this moment.

58:06.500 --> 58:10.740
 If I have to maybe be at work and my boss is a jerk to me and calls me names, I have

58:10.740 --> 58:15.500
 to be humiliated, but I got to put food on the plate, that doesn't mean it's okay later

58:15.500 --> 58:21.700
 if I'm at a party and I'm just extremely offensive to someone for no reason.

58:21.700 --> 58:32.980
 My own flavor of a little bit of rebellion, sometimes I use the number two, is you're

58:32.980 --> 58:36.140
 very witty on Twitter.

58:36.140 --> 58:43.500
 And Twitter likes mockery and wit.

58:43.500 --> 58:51.180
 And on the counter attack is Twitter loves that, somebody who's skilled at it.

58:51.180 --> 59:01.340
 My own flavor of a bit of rebellion is to say things very simply, bordering on cliche

59:01.340 --> 59:09.780
 with authenticity and like genuinely meaning the words I say, but knowing that those words

59:09.780 --> 59:13.740
 would be are easy to attack.

59:13.740 --> 59:20.380
 And that sometimes those attacks can hurt because people would just mock me.

59:20.380 --> 59:24.780
 People don't like earnestness because they've been taught to be too cool for school.

59:24.780 --> 59:29.380
 So there's this pressure for me to be sound way more sophisticated.

59:29.380 --> 59:38.380
 Use bigger words, sometimes throw in a criticism of institutions or something like that, like

59:38.380 --> 59:42.820
 almost as if I have a deep wisdom about the way the world is broken.

59:42.820 --> 59:50.020
 But when you speak very simply about beautiful things in life, it's very easy to sound like

59:50.020 --> 59:52.780
 you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

59:52.780 --> 59:58.100
 And I kind of, I stick by that, I don't know where that's going to end up, but it's like

59:58.100 --> 59:59.500
 the idiot from the stadesky.

59:59.500 --> 1:00:04.780
 It feels like that's the right, that's the right thing, even if it hurts when I'm attacked

1:00:04.780 --> 1:00:05.780
 for it.

1:00:05.780 --> 1:00:09.620
 And I do something similar sometimes, which is I'll have some innocuous comment about

1:00:09.620 --> 1:00:10.620
 like bubble gum.

1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:12.940
 I mean, just it's not to be in political.

1:00:12.940 --> 1:00:18.940
 And a lot of times people will respond to this paragraph of just invective about like

1:00:18.940 --> 1:00:22.500
 blah, blah, blah, and then this and you say this and you're an ass and just really trying

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:24.260
 to get at me.

1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:28.140
 And what I, in those situations, they're very specific circumstances.

1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:31.020
 I will respond and I mean it every single time.

1:00:31.020 --> 1:00:36.500
 I will say I wish your parents had been kinder to you or your mom or your dad, because if

1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:40.300
 someone is some, even if I'm some idiot on Twitter, right, if we just talk about bubble

1:00:40.300 --> 1:00:43.820
 gum and this is your, I'm not talking about politics where I can see how people get emotional,

1:00:43.820 --> 1:00:46.540
 COVID, my grandma died, now you're talking about her.

1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:50.220
 And you, I realize this isn't about me.

1:00:50.220 --> 1:00:55.500
 Like I'm someone you've never met, making some inane point about nothing and you're getting

1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:57.060
 agitated about this.

1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:01.420
 It's clearly something else that's going on here and someone taught you, someone had to

1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:07.100
 teach you that this is how to respond in this kind of very kind of harsh way.

1:01:07.100 --> 1:01:11.300
 And a lot of times they'll, you know, they won't say anything or get deleted.

1:01:11.300 --> 1:01:19.540
 And I hope every single time there's no asterisk here that they take a second and they realize

1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:25.540
 that the way that they were talked to growing up was not acceptable, that they don't have

1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:30.980
 to carry this forward and that they don't have to be kind to me, I'm nobody of them.

1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:36.060
 But take a second and ask if this is the kind of mindset you want to be your norm as opposed

1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:39.260
 to a weapon you pull out of your pocket sometimes where it's warranted or even when it's not

1:01:39.260 --> 1:01:40.260
 warranted.

1:01:40.260 --> 1:01:46.620
 I think there's a lot of those people out there, you know, and we forget how, you know,

1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:53.780
 how hard it is for a lot of people to grow up, how they're trained from their parents

1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:58.300
 or the single parent, that the only way they're going to get attention is by acting out, that

1:01:58.300 --> 1:02:01.100
 when they do good things, it doesn't get comment.

1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:04.260
 But if they do bad things, they got to smack upside their head.

1:02:04.260 --> 1:02:07.260
 That I think is far more common than we realize.

1:02:07.260 --> 1:02:10.660
 And that's such a, it's not even, it's not hitting the kid that's going to last.

1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:12.860
 The pain is going to give five seconds.

1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:18.140
 But when you're training this child, helpless child is something that's really, really bad.

1:02:18.140 --> 1:02:20.620
 I don't know if it always can be mapped to that.

1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:24.860
 I always wonder about them, like what their motivations are.

1:02:24.860 --> 1:02:28.980
 And I just kind of, like, whenever I think about them, I think only positively.

1:02:28.980 --> 1:02:31.180
 And I don't even think about the childhood thing.

1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:39.420
 I think, I don't know, I kind of imagine that all of us can go through that stage where

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:43.100
 we enjoy the derision of others.

1:02:43.100 --> 1:02:44.540
 We go through stages of being.

1:02:44.540 --> 1:02:48.100
 I enjoy the derision of others, but it has to be, you know, Billy, I'd have that quote

1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:51.580
 of like, I like it when people are mean to me because it's not pretending to be nice.

1:02:51.580 --> 1:02:53.780
 But like, what's the worst thing something to say to about you?

1:02:53.780 --> 1:02:56.580
 You're not, what harm are you doing?

1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:59.700
 Maybe your podcast is garbage and the people are, the conversations suck and the people

1:02:59.700 --> 1:03:00.700
 are losers.

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:01.700
 Okay.

1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:05.580
 No, the main thing I would say is I'm way more popular than I deserve to be.

1:03:05.580 --> 1:03:07.100
 What does deserve mean?

1:03:07.100 --> 1:03:13.380
 The reality is there's people out there that just enjoy hating on others.

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:18.820
 And I don't, I don't fault them for it.

1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:21.260
 Like I don't even think of them as haters.

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:25.020
 I think of them as just people that in this particular part of their life are enjoying

1:03:25.020 --> 1:03:32.020
 this activity of deriding others on the internet.

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:34.260
 I'm not sure what to do with that.

1:03:34.260 --> 1:03:38.580
 I just don't want to, I don't want to allow myself to think badly of them, I guess is the

1:03:38.580 --> 1:03:39.580
 thing.

1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:41.180
 I'm the one saying don't think badly of them.

1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:43.620
 I'm saying that, I don't think they're inherently bad people.

1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:48.020
 I think that their thinking is screwed and that I'm, I'm, I'm steelmanning them.

1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:51.380
 I'm saying, let's assume everything you're saying about Lex is true.

1:03:51.380 --> 1:03:53.540
 This is an opportunity for you to outdo Lex.

1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:54.540
 Like it's,

1:03:54.540 --> 1:03:59.420
 No, but are you saying they should stop hating because I'm saying like, maybe they shouldn't

1:03:59.420 --> 1:04:00.420
 just keep

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:01.740
 I don't believe in should, right?

1:04:01.740 --> 1:04:06.900
 I'm an anarchist, but I'm saying is like, if this is your belief about Lex, you know

1:04:06.900 --> 1:04:07.900
 what it is?

1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:11.940
 I made this comment in my book, the new right when people make fun of Andy Warhol and they're

1:04:11.940 --> 1:04:15.380
 like, Oh my God, he painted a soup can and now he became a millionaire.

1:04:15.380 --> 1:04:16.380
 I could do this.

1:04:16.380 --> 1:04:17.980
 Well, why don't you?

1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:22.940
 So basically, if I go up to you with a check and I say, I will give you a million dollars,

1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:27.260
 you could see the check, you got to paint a soup can, what am I waiting for?

1:04:27.260 --> 1:04:32.380
 So clearly there's a disconnect in their thinking between what they're perceiving and the reality

1:04:32.380 --> 1:04:37.540
 because if it was as simple or as maybe not simple, but as, as, as possible for them as

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:42.420
 they perceive it to be, why are they leaving comments instead of outdoing you?

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:46.260
 How great would it be for them to have your bigger audience and drive you into the ground?

1:04:46.260 --> 1:04:48.260
 I don't know how that would work because it's not the NBA, but

1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:50.620
 No, but you want to point out, you do this too on Twitter.

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:57.860
 You want to point out the hypocrisy, the fraudulence of others, right?

1:04:57.860 --> 1:04:58.860
 Sure.

1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:02.860
 But what are you, you're not claiming anything other than this is the following is the conversation

1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:06.820
 between me and, and, and Michiki or whatever his name is, right?

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:07.980
 I got the voice down, dude.

1:05:07.980 --> 1:05:08.980
 I got it down.

1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:11.100
 I've been walking out of my house doing my Lex impression.

1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:13.260
 I've been leaking motor oil everywhere.

1:05:13.260 --> 1:05:16.260
 Yeah, but yeah, I don't know.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:17.260
 I, I don't know.

1:05:17.260 --> 1:05:20.860
 I don't know what to make of it because I think there's, there's a more general statement

1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:21.860
 to be made.

1:05:21.860 --> 1:05:23.580
 Like I see Twitter this way too.

1:05:23.580 --> 1:05:30.060
 When I read a tweet, I try to read it with like the best possible interpretation, meaning

1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:32.660
 like what is the wisdom in this tweet?

1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:33.660
 Sure.

1:05:33.660 --> 1:05:40.020
 It goes to what I think a large number of people, not a large number, but some fraction

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:43.940
 tried to see what is the worst possible interpretation of this tweet.

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:49.380
 And they want to, they, they want to destroy you for that worst interpretation.

1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:54.180
 Like they want to, um, there's people, I'm already aware of this with me and certainly

1:05:54.180 --> 1:05:57.020
 with a lot of people, they're waiting for me to fail.

1:05:57.020 --> 1:06:01.220
 They want me to be like this guy talks about love all the time.

1:06:01.220 --> 1:06:05.900
 They want me to be some dark, like, uh, they want you to be in pain, yeah.

1:06:05.900 --> 1:06:09.580
 They want you to be in pain because they don't, I'll tell you exactly why.

1:06:09.580 --> 1:06:13.160
 Because this is why I'm so for being white pilled and being for hope.

1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:18.140
 Because if you are black pilled, meaning if you think it's pointless, we're all done.

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:19.740
 You're just wasting your breath.

1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:25.020
 If you have any counter examples to this thesis, if there's even a little bit of hope, your

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.180
 entire hypothesis falls through, right?

1:06:27.180 --> 1:06:31.700
 So if it's, it's kind of how like you have all these stories of people who are like painting

1:06:31.700 --> 1:06:35.780
 swastikas who aren't Nazis, but just to show that, oh, there's all this Nazism.

1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:38.820
 So I'm going to, you know, kind of, uh, force the conclusion.

1:06:38.820 --> 1:06:44.980
 So for them, when they see you thriving, you are as a mediocre person with a crappy show,

1:06:44.980 --> 1:06:47.300
 but you're demonstrating that people can succeed.

1:06:47.300 --> 1:06:48.460
 This bothers them.

1:06:48.460 --> 1:06:51.180
 So you are, anyone can succeed.

1:06:51.180 --> 1:06:52.180
 That bothers them.

1:06:52.180 --> 1:06:53.180
 Yeah.

1:06:53.180 --> 1:06:56.660
 Cause that, why haven't they, so now you're a counter to their worldview and that is going

1:06:56.660 --> 1:07:01.740
 to cause anxiety when you have data that contradicts other data in your, in your worldview.

1:07:01.740 --> 1:07:04.380
 This is the, in your mindset, this is a big issue for them.

1:07:04.380 --> 1:07:05.380
 Yeah.

1:07:05.380 --> 1:07:09.740
 So anyone listening to this, they're annoyed by the look of my face.

1:07:09.740 --> 1:07:13.000
 Remember that you could probably do a better than me and you should.

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.700
 But also what would you failing look like?

1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:21.220
 Like let's suppose this podcast went from whatever views you had to 100 views in episode.

1:07:21.220 --> 1:07:22.740
 That's still success.

1:07:22.740 --> 1:07:26.940
 You are talking to people you like, having conversations about important issues, you're

1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:29.180
 having good time, they're giving good time.

1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:30.300
 How is that a failure?

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:35.660
 If I have dinner with a friend of mine, there's zero viewers and we enjoy that time.

1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:38.940
 That is the height of human success.

1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:43.780
 When you are sharing happiness, joy, joy over love.

1:07:43.780 --> 1:07:46.620
 So what's the difference between joy and love, Michael Malus?

1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:49.940
 Uh, I think joy is easier to attain.

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:50.980
 It's more common.

1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:53.300
 You could share it with everyone.

1:07:53.300 --> 1:07:55.300
 Give me an example of joy.

1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:58.180
 Like what was the moment of joy for you recently?

1:07:58.180 --> 1:08:02.580
 I could give you a great example of joy and this is part in the absurdist mindset.

1:08:02.580 --> 1:08:03.580
 Okay.

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:09.300
 I love having a bad meal at a restaurant and I'll give you, you can see why.

1:08:09.300 --> 1:08:10.980
 You go with your friend.

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:13.340
 It takes you 45 minutes to get seated.

1:08:13.340 --> 1:08:14.340
 Okay.

1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:15.340
 I'm starving.

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:17.420
 Waiters not at paying attention to you.

1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:18.420
 They bring your water.

1:08:18.420 --> 1:08:19.420
 It's got a hair in it.

1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:20.780
 They get the food wrong.

1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:21.780
 They comes out again.

1:08:21.780 --> 1:08:23.100
 It's ripe, but it's cold.

1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:26.220
 At a certain point you're like, okay, I'm hungry.

1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:28.340
 I'm living an anecdote.

1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:31.780
 This is something that you, if you were at dinner, we could talk about this for years

1:08:31.780 --> 1:08:37.700
 because how great is it that the worst thing that's happening to me is I got to wait an

1:08:37.700 --> 1:08:40.700
 hour for this meal that's going to be cooked wrong, right?

1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:48.740
 That to me is joy is holding on to that idea that happiness and thriving are possible even

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:53.020
 when in the moment it's, everything's going the wrong way.

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:57.540
 Doesn't every moment have the capacity to fill you with joy then?

1:08:57.540 --> 1:08:58.540
 Yes.

1:08:58.540 --> 1:09:00.340
 So it's both the shitty moments and the good moments.

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:01.340
 Yes.

1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:09.300
 See, that's the way I usually talk about love is like, I love life and because life can

1:09:09.300 --> 1:09:18.580
 generate everything, the pain, the loss, but also just like simple or complicated bliss.

1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:19.580
 All of that.

1:09:19.580 --> 1:09:25.580
 I just love all of that and that because it fills me with a kind of, I guess, joy, but

1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:28.700
 joy has a connotation that it's supposed to be somehow positive, like you're supposed

1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:30.580
 to be smiling.

1:09:30.580 --> 1:09:39.740
 To me, man search for meaning with Victor Frankel, you're in the Holocaust, you're in

1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:43.660
 a concentration camp, just having a little bit of food that you didn't expect you will

1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:47.940
 have or even just thinking about food.

1:09:47.940 --> 1:09:51.660
 What about there's a kid there, you tell him a funny story and you crack him up.

1:09:51.660 --> 1:09:56.580
 Like you take away this child's pain for like five minutes, that is the height of joy.

1:09:56.580 --> 1:10:01.940
 So to me, all of life is infinitely full of possibility for joy.

1:10:01.940 --> 1:10:07.620
 And that's what I mean by love because oftentimes romantic love is what people think about when

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:11.540
 they think love, but to me, it's all part of the same thing.

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:18.260
 It's almost like love, romantic love or love with a friend, friendship is like, you both

1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:19.980
 notice each other.

1:10:19.980 --> 1:10:23.340
 It's like dogs, they look at each other and then they look at the thing they're interested

1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:24.340
 in.

1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:27.340
 You both notice each other and that moment of joy.

1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:28.820
 You share that moment of joy together.

1:10:28.820 --> 1:10:29.820
 Yeah, like the restaurant.

1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:30.820
 The restaurant.

1:10:30.820 --> 1:10:31.820
 Yeah.

1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:39.340
 If you're both almost without conspiring, notice the absurdity of how shitty this meal

1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:40.340
 is.

1:10:40.340 --> 1:10:46.620
 And again, that little glimmer of realization, that's what makes life beautiful.

1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:52.060
 You mentioned your grandmother in Levov, you were thinking of returning there.

1:10:52.060 --> 1:10:58.420
 The plans got a little bit delayed, but what are you hoping from that trip of going back

1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:01.420
 to Russia, going back to Ukraine?

1:11:01.420 --> 1:11:07.540
 What do you hope to get out of it, but what do you think you will feel?

1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:08.540
 A lot of things.

1:11:08.540 --> 1:11:11.500
 First of all, I'm going with my buddy Chris Williamson.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.420
 He hosts the Modern Wisdom Podcast.

1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.700
 He is one of my closest friends.

1:11:15.700 --> 1:11:16.700
 We've never met.

1:11:16.700 --> 1:11:17.700
 Oh, really?

1:11:17.700 --> 1:11:18.700
 We've never met.

1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:19.700
 He's in Britain.

1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:22.980
 He's trying to get his ass over here to Austin.

1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:24.540
 He's filling out his form right now.

1:11:24.540 --> 1:11:25.540
 He's too good looking.

1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:26.540
 It's a crime.

1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:29.580
 I call him Apollo and I'm Loki.

1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:32.220
 So right away, you have a buddy comedy because we're going to film it, right?

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:36.780
 You have these two guys who on paper, you're very dissimilar, but we're very, very close.

1:11:36.780 --> 1:11:40.380
 In which way are you similar?

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:47.540
 I think we're both very intense people, very strong emotionally.

1:11:47.540 --> 1:11:52.260
 We're both very ambitious in the sense that not in terms of career, but like we want to

1:11:52.260 --> 1:11:55.300
 grab life by the short hairs kind of thing.

1:11:55.300 --> 1:11:59.060
 We're just both like good experiences.

1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:00.900
 He benched more than you or?

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:01.900
 Oh yeah.

1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:02.900
 Of course.

1:12:02.900 --> 1:12:04.300
 I mean, the guy's jacked.

1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:09.420
 Because you know, he's so good looking, he could be one of those guys who is mostly biceps.

1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:10.420
 Oh no, no, no.

1:12:10.420 --> 1:12:16.660
 If you look at, go to his Instagram, chriswillx is the handle, it's like head to toe, it's

1:12:16.660 --> 1:12:17.660
 just sculpted.

1:12:17.660 --> 1:12:18.660
 So he's perfect in every way.

1:12:18.660 --> 1:12:19.660
 That's great.

1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:21.900
 What flaws does he have?

1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:22.900
 Because I need.

1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:24.900
 He's bad taster friends.

1:12:24.900 --> 1:12:29.580
 At his accent, it's all crazy.

1:12:29.580 --> 1:12:32.300
 He pronounces it, he's an under a model.

1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:38.940
 So now I spell it MUDL, so just us two, British and American and just two different dudes.

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:39.940
 It's going to be a lot of fun.

1:12:39.940 --> 1:12:43.300
 Although to be fair, as you know, I'm an underwear model now as well.

1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:48.300
 So we're going to talk that in a second, maybe, but yeah, sheathunderwear.com.

1:12:48.300 --> 1:12:52.300
 Yeah, this episode is brought to you by Sheath Underwear.

1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:53.980
 We're going to get some pictures eventually.

1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:58.340
 I think we might be, yes, I have them on my phone, we're going to, we'll have them because

1:12:58.340 --> 1:13:01.020
 shouldn't write, you could slice it in right here.

1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:06.760
 So to be able to go with someone who is a very close, I mean, we meet and talk like

1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:08.020
 every day, right?

1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:15.300
 So to someone who generally cares about you, who, who's, he's very, very grounded, right?

1:13:15.300 --> 1:13:19.860
 So like a lot of times I'll have like some concern and he's really good and if you listen

1:13:19.860 --> 1:13:24.300
 to show at slicing through the noise and being like, hold on a second, I can't do the accent

1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:25.300
 yet.

1:13:25.300 --> 1:13:26.860
 Have you considered A, B and C?

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:29.540
 Because you know, whenever I had the situation, this is what I did.

1:13:29.540 --> 1:13:32.740
 So he's really good with that.

1:13:32.740 --> 1:13:37.700
 So to have a, first of all, just like two buddies on a trip is a really a lot of fun.

1:13:37.700 --> 1:13:41.620
 Second of all, I know that if it's going to be very intense.

1:13:41.620 --> 1:13:44.660
 So for you, you left Russia much later than I did.

1:13:44.660 --> 1:13:45.660
 How old were you?

1:13:45.660 --> 1:13:46.660
 13.

1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:47.660
 13, right.

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:48.660
 So you remember it, I'm sure very, very well.

1:13:48.660 --> 1:13:54.060
 I left when I was one and a half to, I don't remember at all, to go to the streets where,

1:13:54.060 --> 1:13:58.060
 you know, my family had to go through this stuff to see the, you know, they, they came

1:13:58.060 --> 1:13:59.820
 to live up, they slaughtered all the Jews.

1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:04.140
 I mean, to have that little memorial there that's there now and to just look around and

1:14:04.140 --> 1:14:08.540
 know yesterday, basically, they came here, they rounded everyone up.

1:14:08.540 --> 1:14:12.220
 And also from the other side, you had the Stalinists coming in and starting all the

1:14:12.220 --> 1:14:13.220
 people.

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:18.940
 It's just to know that so much horror and death, there's this quote I saw once about

1:14:18.940 --> 1:14:23.540
 a woman who went to Auschwitz and she just made the comment like, grass grows here.

1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:26.980
 Because we think, you know, that when you come to the nature of evil that you're going

1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:29.820
 to go there, there's going to be this pits of hell or whatever.

1:14:29.820 --> 1:14:30.820
 There's birds.

1:14:30.820 --> 1:14:34.700
 You know, there's, you know, Robbins hopping around looking for the worms or whatever.

1:14:34.700 --> 1:14:38.740
 They think it's perfectly nice and you, you, you stand there to understand that so much

1:14:38.740 --> 1:14:42.980
 suffering happened here or there is going to be very jarring.

1:14:42.980 --> 1:14:47.820
 I know that it's going to be an issue because I speak Russian and not Ukrainian and to speak

1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:50.220
 Russian to Ukrainians is like a big deal.

1:14:50.220 --> 1:14:51.740
 So that's going to be a concern.

1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:56.420
 I'm also worried about going to Russia because every Russian has this idea that even though

1:14:56.420 --> 1:15:00.380
 they've just met you, they feel, they feel they're in a position to tell you what you're

1:15:00.380 --> 1:15:03.380
 doing wrong with your life, what you should be doing if they're a cab driver.

1:15:03.380 --> 1:15:07.140
 I have no tolerance for unsolicited advice and it based at all.

1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:08.140
 That's going to be horrible.

1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:13.420
 They're going to be telling me I need to speak Russian better because I'm not hearing it.

1:15:13.420 --> 1:15:15.340
 I'm not interested in hearing it.

1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:21.040
 So that I think, and also, you know, given my upcoming book, The White Pill and covering

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:26.620
 what happened back in the day under Stalinism and later to see this was the Ljublanka.

1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:30.220
 This was the basement where they would, you know, once this is something that people might

1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:34.700
 not realize, there's a superb film, The Death of Stalin, which is kind of does what I do

1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:37.460
 with North Korea, you know, puts a humorous spin on it.

1:15:37.460 --> 1:15:40.140
 Then when you take a step back and you realize what they're actually saying, it's just like

1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:44.860
 it's very, very disturbing how when Stalin was dying, he had a stroke.

1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:46.500
 He's laying there in a pile of his own past.

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:48.180
 He's unconscious.

1:15:48.180 --> 1:15:52.300
 He'd be right before he died, he thought the doctors were all plotting against him.

1:15:52.300 --> 1:15:56.340
 So they were being tortured to confess that they were trying to murder him.

1:15:56.340 --> 1:16:01.780
 They had to get the doctors out of the torture chambers to attend to him and they did it.

1:16:01.780 --> 1:16:07.300
 So this kind of thing to like go there like Red Square and see this is where it happened

1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:11.700
 to see Lenin's body like this is the guy who Emma Goldman yelled at.

1:16:11.700 --> 1:16:17.980
 It's going to be really, because I've worked so much in this space, jarring and intense

1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:18.980
 and emotional.

1:16:18.980 --> 1:16:22.660
 And as intense as it is for me sitting here talking to you about it, to see it and to

1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:28.020
 see the faces and to see Cyrillic everywhere, you know, other than Brighton Beach in Brooklyn,

1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:34.300
 it's going to, I'm sure it's going to do a huge number on me because as Western and

1:16:34.300 --> 1:16:38.420
 as the DuPoi Medikanyets, as the Russians will say I am, this is still where I came

1:16:38.420 --> 1:16:39.420
 from.

1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:43.340
 So no matter to see it face to face, I don't know how I'm going to react, but I don't think

1:16:43.340 --> 1:16:45.900
 it's going to be like meh.

1:16:45.900 --> 1:16:51.340
 You've assembled a number of essays from anarchist thinkers in a new book called The Anarchist

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:52.840
 Handbook.

1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:55.780
 You mentioned Emma Goldman.

1:16:55.780 --> 1:17:00.780
 What interesting things do these thinkers agree on and what do they disagree on?

1:17:00.780 --> 1:17:03.220
 The anarchisthandbook.com is the website.

1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:09.660
 It covers from the 1790s to I think my essays, the last one from 2014, which a friend of

1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:14.060
 mine who's kind of a mediocre scientist is going to be reading for the audiobook.

1:17:14.060 --> 1:17:15.060
 Also podcast.

1:17:15.060 --> 1:17:16.060
 Also podcast.

1:17:16.060 --> 1:17:19.220
 I never, but it's not a podcast anyone would have heard of.

1:17:19.220 --> 1:17:20.940
 It's like Tom Woods, but even worse.

1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:29.500
 So what they all agreed on was the illegitimacy of government and also the malevolence of

1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:34.220
 state actors and the consequences of governments.

1:17:34.220 --> 1:17:41.860
 So they range in terms that most people would easily regard as either left or right wing,

1:17:41.860 --> 1:17:48.620
 but it tackles the nature of government and also creates positive non state alternatives

1:17:48.620 --> 1:17:50.620
 from really many different angles.

1:17:50.620 --> 1:17:54.300
 The slogan I have is the black flag, which is the traditional flag of anarchism.

1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:56.580
 The black flag comes in many colors.

1:17:56.580 --> 1:18:00.980
 So they were really all over the map in terms of what they're for, but their disagreement

1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:04.700
 is about the nature of state and the nature of power.

1:18:04.700 --> 1:18:08.780
 And it's very edifying because this is an ideology that's been in many ways swept under

1:18:08.780 --> 1:18:09.780
 the rug.

1:18:09.780 --> 1:18:12.820
 No one takes this seriously, grow up.

1:18:12.820 --> 1:18:18.180
 That I can allow people to sit down and read these essays and see for themselves just how

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:23.540
 beautiful this tapestry over the decades and centuries has been woven about people who

1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:32.540
 genuinely believed in freedom as the most important and how to maximize that for society.

1:18:32.540 --> 1:18:36.260
 So maybe it's useful to talk about a few contrasting thinkers in there.

1:18:36.260 --> 1:18:49.700
 So one is Leo Tolstoy, who I think not many people know is an anarchist, a Christian anarchist.

1:18:49.700 --> 1:18:56.220
 So he came to despise government for his deceit and its violence.

1:18:56.220 --> 1:19:00.260
 But to him, the Christian principles of nonviolence, I think, are important.

1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:01.260
 Oh, yeah.

1:19:01.260 --> 1:19:06.260
 And it's kind of pacifist kind of mindset of, you know, it's better to someone to punch

1:19:06.260 --> 1:19:07.820
 you than to punch them back.

1:19:07.820 --> 1:19:12.500
 So he's in that way, at least I read he influenced MLK and Gandhi.

1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:19.260
 What do you think about this flavor, color of the anarchist flag of nonviolence, nonviolent

1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:21.500
 opposition?

1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:26.180
 I will put the caveat that it bothers me when people bring up MLK because he's become so

1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:29.580
 corporate and everyone just brings him up without knowing about him.

1:19:29.580 --> 1:19:35.140
 One of the things that Martin Luther King did so very well was that he forced people

1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:40.340
 to face the consequences of what they were putting forward.

1:19:40.340 --> 1:19:43.940
 You want to be racist, you want to be for Jim Crow, you want to be for segregation.

1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:46.700
 Okay, it's easy for you to do that from your living room.

1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:53.020
 Now turn on your news and you see men and women in suits being attacked by dogs, being

1:19:53.020 --> 1:19:58.620
 attacked by firehoses and beaten by cops just so they could sit on the front of the bus.

1:19:58.620 --> 1:20:03.220
 And now for a lot of people who were still racist, who were still had animus toward black

1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:05.140
 people are watching this.

1:20:05.140 --> 1:20:09.660
 And it's going to be a lot harder to be like, I'm okay with this.

1:20:09.660 --> 1:20:15.460
 I'm okay with human beings, even ones I regard as somehow bad or inferior to be beaten and

1:20:15.460 --> 1:20:20.420
 attacked by trained dogs and they're not doing anything in response.

1:20:20.420 --> 1:20:26.100
 That strikes to, I think, a very basic nature of, especially American, like, okay, whatever

1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:30.780
 you're for, I'm not for people getting beaten and attacked when they're not really doing

1:20:30.780 --> 1:20:31.780
 anything.

1:20:31.780 --> 1:20:38.380
 So I think pacifism is something that's very easy to make fun of, but people don't underestimate

1:20:38.380 --> 1:20:44.380
 how powerful it is for someone to say, you can do what you want to me, I'm not going

1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:49.300
 to fight you back, I just want to live peacefully and have the same rights as you.

1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:52.660
 And to say, screw you, you should get beaten.

1:20:52.660 --> 1:20:55.220
 That's a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow.

1:20:55.220 --> 1:21:00.300
 So I think he was really, and Gandhi, of course, as well, were excellent in that regard.

1:21:00.300 --> 1:21:02.220
 There's a little bit of Machiavellianism to it.

1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:08.260
 They've both been beatified regard as saints, but their strategy worked very, very well

1:21:08.260 --> 1:21:09.380
 for their purposes.

1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:15.380
 So I think just all of us, when you see someone, you know, in this kind of Christian, you know,

1:21:15.380 --> 1:21:18.980
 I know you're Ron, obviously, it's nothing very highly Christianity, but if he's someone

1:21:18.980 --> 1:21:24.580
 who's willing to, you know, take a punch and just say, you could do whatever you want to

1:21:24.580 --> 1:21:32.540
 me, I'm not going to hurt somebody else instinctively, and maybe this is kind of a hack, most people

1:21:32.540 --> 1:21:36.900
 want to side with that guy, step in between and be like, oh, okay, let's take a step back

1:21:36.900 --> 1:21:40.980
 because whatever led to this is not tenable, we need to go back to drawing board if the

1:21:40.980 --> 1:21:45.980
 consequence is people are having these as a result of my decisions and actions.

1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:53.820
 So I think that aspect of anarchism is very, very in certain contexts, healthy and much

1:21:53.820 --> 1:21:57.700
 smarter and more sophisticated than people give it credit for.

1:21:57.700 --> 1:22:03.420
 And let's also point out that Tolstoy wrote War and Peace, and he wrote Anna Karenina.

1:22:03.420 --> 1:22:07.220
 So this was not some naive or innocent, whatever word you want to use.

1:22:07.220 --> 1:22:08.980
 He knew the nature of evil.

1:22:08.980 --> 1:22:10.820
 He knew how bad things get.

1:22:10.820 --> 1:22:15.180
 So he wasn't saying at all that human beings are inherently nice and kind.

1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:20.620
 He was saying it's much more effective to not fight back and to force them to face that.

1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:22.500
 I'll give you another example.

1:22:22.500 --> 1:22:27.820
 I was talking to, I was on the show Trigonometry, and I was talking to the hosts and one of

1:22:27.820 --> 1:22:33.620
 them talked about how someone he knew had been in the gulag, or his mom was born in

1:22:33.620 --> 1:22:35.100
 the gulag grandma.

1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:39.340
 And after Stalin died and the Serbian liberalized and lots of the people in the gulags were

1:22:39.340 --> 1:22:43.820
 freed by Khrushchev and so on and so forth, I didn't know this.

1:22:43.820 --> 1:22:48.820
 Many of the, or some, let's say some, of the guards of the gulags killed themselves because

1:22:48.820 --> 1:22:54.460
 they had genuinely believed that everyone in these camps was there for a reason.

1:22:54.460 --> 1:22:58.580
 And when they found out that these people were completely innocent, didn't even have

1:22:58.580 --> 1:23:03.020
 trials and that they were the ones forced them to work themselves to death and starve,

1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:05.300
 they couldn't deal with that guilt.

1:23:05.300 --> 1:23:13.220
 So when you are a pacifist or a non retaliatory and you're forcing someone who's using force,

1:23:13.220 --> 1:23:14.300
 look what you're doing.

1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:15.900
 Look what you've become.

1:23:15.900 --> 1:23:18.340
 For some people, some people don't care.

1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:21.900
 The guide and scare tactics, like I mentioned earlier, where for a lot of others, they're

1:23:21.900 --> 1:23:24.940
 going to be like, okay, is this who I wanted to grow up to be?

1:23:24.940 --> 1:23:27.860
 They will have that little flame of conscious that you and I talked about earlier.

1:23:27.860 --> 1:23:32.900
 There will be like, how did I get to the point where there's this lady who wants to ride

1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:38.460
 the bus and she's, you know, lovely dressed, put together, and I have a, sending a dog

1:23:38.460 --> 1:23:39.460
 on her?

1:23:39.460 --> 1:23:40.500
 What kind of person am I?

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:45.060
 For some of those people, they're going to be like, okay, I can't be a part of this.

1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:46.700
 I don't even understand the politics.

1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:51.980
 I still am racist, but I'm not going to take part in this atrocity.

1:23:51.980 --> 1:23:58.580
 Well, that was for him, from the individual perspective, perhaps he calls that Christian,

1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:04.460
 but listening to that voice of conscience, like whatever that is in you.

1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:13.820
 So for Tolstoy, it seems like anarchism from the individual perspective is silencing the

1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:20.220
 rest of the world and listening to the, for him, probably God given voice of conscience.

1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:25.340
 And so that, that's what it means to live in body anarchism for him.

1:24:25.340 --> 1:24:29.220
 And it's in body Christianity, I would think he would say, but he would see those as basically

1:24:29.220 --> 1:24:30.220
 Yes.

1:24:30.220 --> 1:24:31.220
 Correct.

1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:32.220
 Yeah.

1:24:32.220 --> 1:24:37.420
 So in terms of forms of government, the Christian government is one that's no government.

1:24:37.420 --> 1:24:38.420
 Yeah.

1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:39.420
 Correct.

1:24:39.420 --> 1:24:46.620
 What do you think about that as advice for an individual, turn the other cheek?

1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:50.380
 Do you think, I tend to believe that that's a really good way to live?

1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:53.780
 I think it's very underrated and this is me talking.

1:24:53.780 --> 1:24:59.540
 I think a lot of times when someone, let's suppose you're having an argument and, but

1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:01.220
 you have to, you have to pick your battles, right?

1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:04.580
 Let's suppose you're having a heated argument and someone says something very cruel to you.

1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:08.600
 We have attempted to double down and hit back twice as hard, but if it's someone who had

1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:12.420
 all cares about you, what they're just in the moment and you just stop and you just

1:25:12.420 --> 1:25:14.900
 say, did you hear what you just said to me?

1:25:14.900 --> 1:25:19.180
 For some cases, that person will take a step back and be like, just like we, when I snapped

1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:24.420
 at Michael, uh, at bitstein years ago, I'd be like, wow, okay, this, this is bad.

1:25:24.420 --> 1:25:25.420
 This is bad.

1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:26.420
 I'm sorry.

1:25:26.420 --> 1:25:30.340
 And they kind of, you know, it's kind of like they have to get to 10 before they read control

1:25:30.340 --> 1:25:32.340
 of the lead to use your language.

1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:33.340
 Thank you.

1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:34.340
 Yeah.

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:35.780
 But for overflow, I'd appreciate that.

1:25:35.780 --> 1:25:39.780
 But for some, they're going to, they're going to just twist the knife, but I think this

1:25:39.780 --> 1:25:41.820
 is a very useful technique.

1:25:41.820 --> 1:25:47.620
 And also you can also sleep well at night because you could be like as much as this person tried

1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:51.100
 to hurt me, I still didn't reciprocate.

1:25:51.100 --> 1:25:56.500
 And yeah, I took that punch and it sucks, but at least I never said anything that I

1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:58.140
 could feel guilty about.

1:25:58.140 --> 1:25:59.140
 Exactly.

1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:05.620
 Do you think that's ultimately a good way to implement anarchy in your personal life?

1:26:05.620 --> 1:26:10.620
 Anarchy, I don't, implementing anarchy in your personal life just means, uh, respecting

1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:12.540
 people's boundaries.

1:26:12.540 --> 1:26:18.460
 It means, um, uh, not forcing people to do things that otherwise wouldn't want to do.

1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:25.020
 I think you then have to take, uh, case by case, like there's so many human interactions

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:27.780
 that are required for life.

1:26:27.780 --> 1:26:29.660
 And there's tension and all those kinds of things.

1:26:29.660 --> 1:26:30.660
 It's not always...

1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:31.660
 You're not being naive or innocent.

1:26:31.660 --> 1:26:33.660
 You're being, you're being so naive.

1:26:33.660 --> 1:26:34.660
 No, it's...

1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:35.660
 Put the hat on.

1:26:35.660 --> 1:26:38.180
 The hat's on the other head now.

1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:41.100
 Well, I had to take off the hat because it's like photo with the ring.

1:26:41.100 --> 1:26:43.580
 I was starting to feel like powerful.

1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:49.900
 I wanted to give you orders and I went, no, I, I just, I think there's, uh, ways of dealing

1:26:49.900 --> 1:26:57.660
 with the tensions that are natural to human interactions that can't be simply, um, you

1:26:57.660 --> 1:27:04.860
 know, it's not as simple as saying you want to respect the freedom of others and, um,

1:27:04.860 --> 1:27:06.420
 the boundaries of others.

1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:11.580
 It's like, you both have to agree on stuff and work something out and the mechanisms

1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:16.780
 of that agreement, the game theory of that agreement, requires different hacks and strategies.

1:27:16.780 --> 1:27:25.340
 And the, the question is for an anarchist collective that's well functioning, what kind

1:27:25.340 --> 1:27:32.940
 of hacks, uh, what kind of ways of behavior are more likely to be productive and not?

1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:35.220
 You know, that, that's almost like the question.

1:27:35.220 --> 1:27:39.140
 Do you want to turn the other cheek or do you want to stand your ground really firmly?

1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:42.780
 When somebody's an asshole to you, you walk away.

1:27:42.780 --> 1:27:46.460
 Or when somebody's an asshole to you, you turn the other cheek and give them a chance

1:27:46.460 --> 1:27:52.020
 to rise to the best version of themselves and then find a common ground kind of thing.

1:27:52.020 --> 1:27:56.620
 It's an open question of how to form those collectives when there's people with, with

1:27:56.620 --> 1:27:59.780
 difficult childhoods and the, the, all that kind of stuff.

1:27:59.780 --> 1:28:03.300
 Well, this also comes down to what is your relationship for this person?

1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:04.300
 Is this out of character?

1:28:04.300 --> 1:28:07.780
 If you and I got into a disagreement, all of a sudden you started getting very personal.

1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:10.620
 The first thought would be very hurt, but then I'd be like, this is out of character

1:28:10.620 --> 1:28:11.620
 for legs.

1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:13.620
 I'm sure I could be like, well, let's take a pause here.

1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:14.780
 Like you're getting heated.

1:28:14.780 --> 1:28:16.420
 I'm trying to work this out.

1:28:16.420 --> 1:28:17.420
 What's going on here?

1:28:17.420 --> 1:28:19.220
 And you get it kind of a meta conversation.

1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:23.140
 But again, you and I have a relationship of mutual respect, so as opposed to if it was

1:28:23.140 --> 1:28:27.140
 a stranger, you know, who's, yeah, just wants a piece of you.

1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:29.220
 It's just like, I don't, you are coming at me.

1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:30.220
 Not correct.

1:28:30.220 --> 1:28:31.740
 I don't have to reciprocate in kind.

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:36.060
 I'm not going to shoot you, but I'm not going to pretend that you deserve respect when

1:28:36.060 --> 1:28:38.380
 you're treating me with such contempt.

1:28:38.380 --> 1:28:43.540
 I would, I do defer, especially with people I know, because it's just, this is smart

1:28:43.540 --> 1:28:46.180
 longterm game theory as well as the right thing to do.

1:28:46.180 --> 1:28:48.820
 I do try to give them the benefit of data first, right?

1:28:48.820 --> 1:28:52.380
 Because if you're going to go aggro, you can't go back, but you could always go from like,

1:28:52.380 --> 1:28:54.940
 let me hear them out and then, then I could go aggro.

1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:56.820
 So there's a big asymmetry there.

1:28:56.820 --> 1:28:57.820
 Yeah.

1:28:57.820 --> 1:29:02.300
 And that's, I mean, I don't think anyone has the answer to this question is, is that the

1:29:02.300 --> 1:29:03.460
 right strategy?

1:29:03.460 --> 1:29:07.580
 To me, game theoretically, it seems the right strategy is to, well, reciprocity is what

1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:09.380
 game theory says is the right strategy.

1:29:09.380 --> 1:29:13.700
 They did the prisoner's dilemma and they found tit for tat is the one that's the most advantageous.

1:29:13.700 --> 1:29:17.380
 So that's for when it's perfectly rational actors, but when you have, I mean, there's

1:29:17.380 --> 1:29:26.580
 noise that there's a, I think benefit to just, even if they keep being shitty to you, still

1:29:26.580 --> 1:29:27.580
 being nice to them.

1:29:27.580 --> 1:29:30.060
 Well, then there's the inverse where girls are turned off.

1:29:30.060 --> 1:29:34.380
 Some people are like, if you're in a relationship and not just girls, but girl, like some people,

1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:37.020
 when you're kind to them, they find you less attractive, right?

1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:38.020
 Yeah.

1:29:38.020 --> 1:29:40.620
 Like that is kind of this weird, what am I supposed to do?

1:29:40.620 --> 1:29:42.220
 Like you're only into me.

1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:46.060
 If I mean to you, I don't want to be mean, but then I'm getting punished for doing the

1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:47.060
 right thing.

1:29:47.060 --> 1:29:48.340
 That's another tricky one.

1:29:48.340 --> 1:29:52.500
 And I mean, this is nothing that necessarily do with anarchism so much as like, you know,

1:29:52.500 --> 1:29:54.300
 human beings are infinitely complex.

1:29:54.300 --> 1:29:55.860
 We don't often know the backstory.

1:29:55.860 --> 1:30:00.300
 Like for example, just yesterday, Jay, who's here is one of my closest friends.

1:30:00.300 --> 1:30:02.260
 I had a dinner with a bunch of people.

1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:04.140
 I couldn't bring a plus four.

1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:06.300
 So I didn't, he wasn't invited.

1:30:06.300 --> 1:30:07.700
 He didn't know the circumstances.

1:30:07.700 --> 1:30:09.220
 He just thought we were having dinner without him.

1:30:09.220 --> 1:30:10.300
 He was hurt.

1:30:10.300 --> 1:30:12.420
 Once I spelled it out, he completely understood it.

1:30:12.420 --> 1:30:17.300
 And I felt horrible because for me to have any of my friends feel left out is just a very,

1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:19.380
 very cruel thing.

1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:22.700
 And I was, I felt bad and I'm glad to apologize again publicly that that's ended up being

1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:23.700
 the circumstances.

1:30:23.700 --> 1:30:27.460
 But yeah, it's, it's, it's a lot of times we're also in Plato's cave.

1:30:27.460 --> 1:30:30.820
 When you're dealing with somebody else, you have very, very limited information about

1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:32.660
 their background and circumstances.

1:30:32.660 --> 1:30:37.220
 And that's why I will always, if it's someone I have even have a little bit of a relationship

1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:41.860
 with, try to give them the benefit of the doubt because I found, especially this comes

1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:45.340
 from being a co author when you co author books and you're walking other people's shoes.

1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:47.540
 You don't know what's a lot of the information.

1:30:47.540 --> 1:30:51.140
 So it's a lot of times it's just a misunderstanding.

1:30:51.140 --> 1:30:56.820
 But isn't that a fundamentally anarchist question of how we figure out this puzzle of human

1:30:56.820 --> 1:30:59.340
 complexities in order to form voluntary collectives?

1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:03.780
 Like, when you have to figure that out, how to make people feel good, how to make people

1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:04.780
 like.

1:31:04.780 --> 1:31:05.780
 I agree.

1:31:05.780 --> 1:31:06.780
 That's fair.

1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:09.940
 And that I think, I think not only anarchists have to think about this as my point, of

1:31:09.940 --> 1:31:10.940
 course.

1:31:10.940 --> 1:31:13.740
 But we have to think about it more than others do.

1:31:13.740 --> 1:31:14.740
 Right.

1:31:14.740 --> 1:31:20.700
 I feel like I should try to argue against anarchism at some point, out of love, out of love.

1:31:20.700 --> 1:31:28.500
 And so because people, people enjoy seeing me, what is it, when like Ben Shapiro argues

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:33.900
 against like a 20 year old feminist, destroys high school students, this is this video of

1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:40.420
 Michael Malz destroys a Marxist Russian communist pig.

1:31:40.420 --> 1:31:43.220
 So anarchism is opposed to hierarchies.

1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:45.620
 Well, that's left anarchism, anarcho communism.

1:31:45.620 --> 1:31:46.620
 Yeah.

1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:47.620
 The state.

1:31:47.620 --> 1:31:48.620
 But there are many hierarchies that are not the state.

1:31:48.620 --> 1:31:49.620
 We have a hierarchy here.

1:31:49.620 --> 1:31:50.620
 This is your show.

1:31:50.620 --> 1:31:51.620
 I'm differential to you.

1:31:51.620 --> 1:31:52.620
 Right.

1:31:52.620 --> 1:31:53.620
 But they're rigid hierarchies.

1:31:53.620 --> 1:31:54.620
 Forced hierarchies.

1:31:54.620 --> 1:31:55.620
 Forced hierarchies.

1:31:55.620 --> 1:31:56.620
 Yes.

1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:57.620
 Forced hierarchies.

1:31:57.620 --> 1:31:58.620
 Okay.

1:31:58.620 --> 1:32:04.300
 So do you think it's possible that humans, when left on their own court, they form hierarchies

1:32:04.300 --> 1:32:05.300
 naturally?

1:32:05.300 --> 1:32:06.300
 Yes.

1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:07.300
 Inevitably in my opinion.

1:32:07.300 --> 1:32:08.300
 Inevitably.

1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:09.300
 Which is why I disagree with the left anarchist.

1:32:09.300 --> 1:32:14.300
 It's not a coherent thing to argue for non hierarchical relationships.

1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:16.220
 Even in theory, it doesn't make sense to me.

1:32:16.220 --> 1:32:22.180
 And I know the old school anarchists will call me stupid or uninformed, but I've never

1:32:22.180 --> 1:32:26.020
 been able to even wrap my head around this claim that you could have relationships without

1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:27.020
 hierarchy.

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.020
 Right.

1:32:28.020 --> 1:32:31.020
 So I guess there's a certain sense in which we're living in anarchism now.

1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:36.940
 And I don't mean just like because the nations as you've said are in anarchism relative to

1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:42.740
 each other, but isn't the United States just a collective that was formed in anarchy?

1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:46.820
 And this is just the collective that we're operating under, this hierarchy that was naturally

1:32:46.820 --> 1:32:47.820
 formed.

1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:49.620
 Well, the United States was not naturally formed.

1:32:49.620 --> 1:32:51.860
 It was formed by force and by fiat.

1:32:51.860 --> 1:32:56.780
 But to your point, I stress this throughout the book.

1:32:56.780 --> 1:33:00.500
 I always say this anarchism is not a location, it's a relationship.

1:33:00.500 --> 1:33:05.060
 So yeah, you and I do have a hierarchy in that this is your show, but neither of us really

1:33:05.060 --> 1:33:06.700
 has an authority over the other.

1:33:06.700 --> 1:33:08.140
 Like I'm here voluntarily.

1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:09.340
 You can kick me out if you want.

1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:10.780
 I can leave it if you want.

1:33:10.780 --> 1:33:13.940
 Neither of us has the power to force the other to be in this relationship we've chosen.

1:33:13.940 --> 1:33:17.420
 My lawyer, I defer to his judgment.

1:33:17.420 --> 1:33:18.580
 He's not forcing me to do it.

1:33:18.580 --> 1:33:20.940
 He gives me his advice and I can take it or leave it.

1:33:20.940 --> 1:33:21.940
 Same with the doctor.

1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:25.340
 So there is a clearly like who's in charge and who's not in charge, but they're not in

1:33:25.340 --> 1:33:27.620
 a position to impose their will on everybody else.

1:33:27.620 --> 1:33:33.900
 And you could very easily see John is Stephanie's lawyer and Stephanie is John's doctor.

1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:38.460
 And in each of those contexts, one has a position of ostensible authority over the other.

1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:42.460
 So anarchism is in fact not some utopian crazy thing.

1:33:42.460 --> 1:33:48.100
 It is the norm of human relationships where you meet people, you're not necessarily equal.

1:33:48.100 --> 1:33:51.020
 Someone's going to be taller, someone's going to be stronger, someone's smarter, wealthier

1:33:51.020 --> 1:33:56.700
 with others, but you're not at all thinking, I am here and I could tell you what to do

1:33:56.700 --> 1:34:01.460
 and you are legally or morally obligated to follow my wishes.

1:34:01.460 --> 1:34:03.260
 That is the basis of anarchism.

1:34:03.260 --> 1:34:09.460
 So in what way is the United States imposing by force something on you, do you think?

1:34:09.460 --> 1:34:12.820
 If you leave your house, you will go to jail.

1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:15.700
 My money being taken from you via taxation.

1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:19.060
 But don't you have the freedom to not operate under that?

1:34:19.060 --> 1:34:22.860
 No, but that's like, yeah, like technically if someone comes up to you and mugs you and

1:34:22.860 --> 1:34:27.380
 says your money or your life, you are making a choice, but what the anarchist argument

1:34:27.380 --> 1:34:31.020
 is they're not in a position to force you to make that choice.

1:34:31.020 --> 1:34:35.900
 That is not morally binding, even though they have practically the power to force you into

1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:37.260
 that dilemma.

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:41.300
 But you have the freedom to live under the United States or not.

1:34:41.300 --> 1:34:46.700
 So even, yeah, the argument is if you don't like it, leave, right?

1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:53.980
 Not necessarily leave like geographically, but there's ways to live outside the force

1:34:53.980 --> 1:34:54.980
 of the United States.

1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:57.420
 There's ways it's just very difficult to operate that way.

1:34:57.420 --> 1:35:01.340
 But that's like saying you could outrun the mugger, which is true, but the issue is does

1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:08.220
 that mugger have the right to tell you at gunpoint, you're either giving me your money

1:35:08.220 --> 1:35:12.460
 or I'm going to shoot you or secret plan C, you get to run away.

1:35:12.460 --> 1:35:14.620
 Is that person a moral actor?

1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:16.540
 And the anarchist answer is never.

1:35:16.540 --> 1:35:20.060
 And the difference, just one more thing, the anarchist view is the difference between

1:35:20.060 --> 1:35:25.700
 that mugger and the government is only an air of legitimacy.

1:35:25.700 --> 1:35:27.220
 Literally they're morally identical.

1:35:27.220 --> 1:35:33.180
 So is it possible that every hierarchy that gets big enough and successful enough such

1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:39.500
 that it can monopolize a bunch of services it provides, isn't it always going to be

1:35:39.500 --> 1:35:44.580
 a moral in your sense, the way the United States government is a moral?

1:35:44.580 --> 1:35:47.380
 Well, I don't want to say just like the United States government is a moral because that

1:35:47.380 --> 1:35:51.700
 implies the United States government is uniquely or especially a moral, which I just want to

1:35:51.700 --> 1:35:56.500
 clarify that because I know you didn't mean that and I want that to be the implication.

1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:57.500
 Can you repeat the question?

1:35:57.500 --> 1:36:01.540
 So like won't every okay, so that's right.

1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:03.300
 So that's progressive economics.

1:36:03.300 --> 1:36:07.980
 So the argument is in any market at a certain point, things tend to centralize and then

1:36:07.980 --> 1:36:12.540
 that organization de facto can dictate price can dictate so on and so forth.

1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:14.740
 That is completely a historical.

1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:20.020
 If you look at any market, the trend is always towards decentralization, the music industry,

1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:21.020
 right?

1:36:21.020 --> 1:36:23.460
 When we were kids, there were four or five record labels.

1:36:23.460 --> 1:36:25.740
 They were the ones who made all the songs that you're going to see in the Billboard

1:36:25.740 --> 1:36:27.540
 Top 100 with a few exceptions.

1:36:27.540 --> 1:36:29.980
 Now anyone can go to direct to market.

1:36:29.980 --> 1:36:31.460
 If you look at TV stations, right?

1:36:31.460 --> 1:36:36.620
 It went from CBS, NBC, ABC, then you got Fox, then you had cable, which is 100.

1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:39.300
 Now you have satellite, which have sounds around the world and you have YouTube, which

1:36:39.300 --> 1:36:40.700
 is literally infinite.

1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:45.780
 So as technology improves and as wealth increases, which is a function of free enterprise, you

1:36:45.780 --> 1:36:52.900
 are going to always have more and more choice even within a monopoly, Coca Cola, right?

1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:56.460
 This is an example I used, I think, in the New Right, when we were kids, every terrible

1:36:56.460 --> 1:37:02.220
 comedian would be like, oh, now that I've got diet caffeine free Coke, what's next?

1:37:02.220 --> 1:37:03.900
 It's like, yeah, that's good.

1:37:03.900 --> 1:37:08.900
 You want to have, what was his name, Cayman, the guy who invented the Segway.

1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:14.860
 If you go, Dean Cayman, if you go into some restaurants right now, you will have those

1:37:14.860 --> 1:37:15.860
 machines.

1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:19.580
 You have like 80 kinds of Cokes and then you could have whatever flavor you want to add

1:37:19.580 --> 1:37:22.700
 to a grape, cherry, lemon lime, so on and so forth.

1:37:22.700 --> 1:37:27.220
 So in any field, you're going to have more and more competition.

1:37:27.220 --> 1:37:31.700
 You're going to have less competition and less choices when the state gets involved

1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:33.660
 because the state wants control.

1:37:33.660 --> 1:37:38.180
 The state wants one big neck with one leash around it and that way it could just pull that

1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:39.940
 dog in one direction or another.

1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:44.380
 And you saw this last year with the lockdowns, Carol Roth wrote this amazing book called

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:49.620
 the war on small business and she talked about, we have seen for the first time in history

1:37:49.620 --> 1:37:55.380
 a massive wealth transfer from small and medium business towards organizations like Target

1:37:55.380 --> 1:38:00.820
 and Amazon who made trillions of dollars last year, whereas mom and pop, which to me at

1:38:00.820 --> 1:38:03.540
 least is like the acme of American achievement.

1:38:03.540 --> 1:38:08.740
 You come to America, you have a fruit stand, a laundromat, you make, you socks, whatever

1:38:08.740 --> 1:38:11.860
 it is, you're that unique artisan creating something special.

1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:14.780
 They're the ones who didn't last, whereas Target and Amazon did.

1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:18.460
 So when you have the state involvement, it will always be in favor of Jeff Bezos.

1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:22.580
 And for the simple reason that it's going to be a lot easier for Jeff Bezos to get Nancy

1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:27.780
 Pelosi and Mitch McConnell on the phone than it is for me making socks and Etsy.

1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:34.140
 But your sense is that there'll be less and less over time, Jeff Bezos is like whatever

1:38:34.140 --> 1:38:42.140
 the industry will look at, there's a trend towards decentralization across all industries.

1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:45.700
 And when I say decentralization, I just mean choice, right?

1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:50.140
 So if you look at, again, networks, you're going to, if you were in the 80s and you had

1:38:50.140 --> 1:38:55.260
 a network just for LGBT issues, first of all, it's going to be completely heretical.

1:38:55.260 --> 1:38:56.540
 That's not going to happen.

1:38:56.540 --> 1:38:59.780
 And there's not going to be enough necessarily people identify as that to have an audience.

1:38:59.780 --> 1:39:01.060
 Then there was something called logo.

1:39:01.060 --> 1:39:02.060
 They have that.

1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:03.660
 And there's lots of other shows like that in this way.

1:39:03.660 --> 1:39:06.620
 So more specifically, look at websites.

1:39:06.620 --> 1:39:12.940
 I am positive that you and I, if we wanted to look up breeding guinea pigs, would find

1:39:12.940 --> 1:39:17.580
 thousands of websites about different breeds and all this other stuff 20 years ago, 30

1:39:17.580 --> 1:39:21.700
 years ago, like you're going to have two books and they're not going to be dynamic as these

1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:24.580
 new breeds are developed.

1:39:24.580 --> 1:39:31.780
 So at the same time, it does following on your argument, it does seem easier to move

1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:37.020
 and immigrate from state to state within the United States and to other countries.

1:39:37.020 --> 1:39:45.100
 Do you think that's a form of freedom that embodies anarchism where you can resist the

1:39:45.100 --> 1:39:47.540
 force of state by choosing where you live?

1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:51.700
 To some extent, but the line of people, some of these boomers will go on me on Twitter

1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:55.260
 if I'm going up to police or something and be like, if you don't like America, get out

1:39:55.260 --> 1:39:56.260
 of here.

1:39:56.260 --> 1:39:58.940
 And I tell them freedom means I do what I want.

1:39:58.940 --> 1:39:59.940
 Not what you want.

1:39:59.940 --> 1:40:01.660
 Freedom means I don't have to move.

1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:02.900
 You don't have to move.

1:40:02.900 --> 1:40:04.060
 Free speech is a good example.

1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:05.900
 It doesn't mean I have to be on Twitter, right?

1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:09.380
 Twitter has the right to ban me, but what I'm saying is I'm saying something and you

1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:11.500
 don't like it too bad.

1:40:11.500 --> 1:40:15.900
 You're the one who has to accommodate me because I have a right to do what I want with my person

1:40:15.900 --> 1:40:18.140
 as long as I'm being peaceful.

1:40:18.140 --> 1:40:24.700
 So I guess I'm trying to get to the difference between the state and what you would naturally

1:40:24.700 --> 1:40:32.780
 want in anarchy, which is like a security company, all of those things, they will as

1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:37.220
 they become successful start looking more and more like the state because you get to

1:40:37.220 --> 1:40:42.220
 elect, you give them money, they have leaders.

1:40:42.220 --> 1:40:49.980
 What's the difference between a government and a very successful service provider in

1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:50.980
 anarchism?

1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:55.460
 This gets a little confused in America as big companies necessarily are hand in hand

1:40:55.460 --> 1:40:57.620
 with the government, ended up in bed with them.

1:40:57.620 --> 1:41:01.500
 The answer to this question is a long, complicated one and thankfully it's all in the anarchist

1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:02.500
 handbook.

1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.980
 There's an essay by Murray Rothbard, this is the essay that converted Dave Smith.

1:41:06.980 --> 1:41:11.140
 So maybe it's not as good as it could have been otherwise called Anatomy of the State.

1:41:11.140 --> 1:41:16.500
 And Murray Rothbard points out that state is the only agency in a country which gets

1:41:16.500 --> 1:41:18.620
 its goods through force.

1:41:18.620 --> 1:41:24.020
 The state is the only agency that is not a producer but inherently a parasite because

1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:28.900
 it does not get its money voluntarily but through taxation and by imposing its values

1:41:28.900 --> 1:41:30.180
 on a country.

1:41:30.180 --> 1:41:35.260
 That is what makes a state uniquely different from let's suppose an Amazon or a Barnes & Noble

1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:36.260
 or a Target.

1:41:36.260 --> 1:41:42.980
 Jeff Bezos does not have the authority or the moral legitimacy to get an army and go

1:41:42.980 --> 1:41:48.540
 into somebody's house whereas Andrew Cuomo or Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump and Barack

1:41:48.540 --> 1:41:50.140
 Obama certainly do.

1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:59.940
 But is it possible that to reframe, so Jeff Bezos does if he hires a security force.

1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:06.020
 So is it possible to reframe taxation as a form of payment?

1:42:06.020 --> 1:42:11.660
 If it was done much better, if you could pay this collective that we call government in

1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:18.260
 ways where you could pay for things that you care for, so your money would be much more

1:42:18.260 --> 1:42:21.140
 directly contributing to the things you care for.

1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:25.740
 If you care for a service like healthcare, you'll be able to buy essentially insurance

1:42:25.740 --> 1:42:26.740
 from the government.

1:42:26.740 --> 1:42:30.060
 Why am I buying insurance from the government as opposed to insurance from an insurance

1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:31.060
 company?

1:42:31.060 --> 1:42:33.180
 What do you perceive as the difference between a tax and a price?

1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:34.180
 Do you see the difference?

1:42:34.180 --> 1:42:41.460
 I guess I know on the surface level I'm trying to get deeply to say there's a lot of similarities.

1:42:41.460 --> 1:42:46.820
 What I'm saying is there's one essential difference which is taxes are imposed on you and you

1:42:46.820 --> 1:42:48.900
 have no choice.

1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:49.900
 Here's an example.

1:42:49.900 --> 1:42:53.780
 My book Ego and Hubris, my biography, it goes for $500 in eBay.

1:42:53.780 --> 1:42:54.780
 Someone paid for it.

1:42:54.780 --> 1:42:55.780
 Some crazy person.

1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:59.940
 People were showing me that it's on Amazon for $3,000 or something like that.

1:42:59.940 --> 1:43:01.380
 You could put a million for it.

1:43:01.380 --> 1:43:03.100
 You could charge whatever price you want.

1:43:03.100 --> 1:43:05.460
 The question is, is someone paying that $3,000 for it?

1:43:05.460 --> 1:43:07.380
 Is someone paying that million for it?

1:43:07.380 --> 1:43:11.820
 It's actually the buyer who establishes the price because the seller can put any price

1:43:11.820 --> 1:43:17.220
 that he wants, $80 trillion, but unless someone's paying that amount and clearing the market,

1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:19.540
 that price has literally no real meaning.

1:43:19.540 --> 1:43:22.740
 It's not an indicator of value or worth or market price.

1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:25.140
 Taxation, on the other hand, is by fiat.

1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:32.180
 I can decide it's fair that you, Lex, have to pay 40% and Joe has to pay 45%.

1:43:32.180 --> 1:43:36.100
 Joe and Lex are in no position to be like, this price is too high.

1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:43.380
 Not only is that money set just completely out of their hands, for people who are employees,

1:43:43.380 --> 1:43:45.700
 it's taken out of their paychecks before they even see it.

1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:48.140
 They didn't have the choice to be like, you know what?

1:43:48.140 --> 1:43:50.940
 I agree that the government has the right to pay taxation.

1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:52.340
 Here's my check for 40%.

1:43:52.340 --> 1:43:53.340
 It's going on.

1:43:53.340 --> 1:43:56.580
 It's a completely different paradigm than you are when you're paying for price.

1:43:56.580 --> 1:44:00.420
 The government provides a lot of services in the current system.

1:44:00.420 --> 1:44:04.980
 There's no service the government provides that would not be provided better more efficiently

1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:07.140
 and with more choices in the market.

1:44:07.140 --> 1:44:08.140
 That's a hypothesis.

1:44:08.140 --> 1:44:09.140
 No, that's...

1:44:09.140 --> 1:44:10.140
 Very likely.

1:44:10.140 --> 1:44:11.140
 That's not a...

1:44:11.140 --> 1:44:12.140
 I can demonstrate to you very easily.

1:44:12.140 --> 1:44:15.420
 I love it when you get flustered.

1:44:15.420 --> 1:44:17.900
 This is what people like.

1:44:17.900 --> 1:44:20.140
 It's so cute.

1:44:20.140 --> 1:44:21.140
 The robots...

1:44:21.140 --> 1:44:22.140
 Don't make me put on the hat again.

1:44:22.140 --> 1:44:23.540
 The robot has a fire.

1:44:23.540 --> 1:44:26.300
 There was a smoke coming out of his ears.

1:44:26.300 --> 1:44:27.300
 What is price?

1:44:27.300 --> 1:44:31.420
 I will tax love.

1:44:31.420 --> 1:44:33.460
 You know, people like...

1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:36.740
 I think of the government as a subscription service.

1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:37.740
 No, no.

1:44:37.740 --> 1:44:38.740
 That's the anarchist view.

1:44:38.740 --> 1:44:43.140
 The anarchist view of private security would be a subscription service.

1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:44.140
 That's exactly correct.

1:44:44.140 --> 1:44:50.100
 But everyone hates when you sign up to a gym and then you realize in the contract it's

1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:54.220
 very difficult to cancel that membership and then they up the price.

1:44:54.220 --> 1:44:55.220
 I mean, that's...

1:44:55.220 --> 1:45:00.540
 There's a lot of unpleasant things with a subscription service that then you can elect

1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:02.700
 to go to another subscription service.

1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:03.700
 Sure.

1:45:03.700 --> 1:45:06.940
 Or you could go and yelp and complain and if there's enough people do that, the gym

1:45:06.940 --> 1:45:08.140
 will be receptive.

1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:11.020
 Look at the power of yelp versus the power of the vote.

1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:12.020
 Well this...

1:45:12.020 --> 1:45:13.340
 We could talk about that too.

1:45:13.340 --> 1:45:18.740
 So you're saying yelp is more effective than a voting.

1:45:18.740 --> 1:45:25.340
 The thing is, I agree with you, but you take a further step.

1:45:25.340 --> 1:45:33.580
 You say that yelp is ethical and moral and voting is amoral or like not voting but government

1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:34.580
 is amoral.

1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:39.220
 So like it's not only one more efficient than the other, you're saying like, because I would

1:45:39.220 --> 1:45:45.660
 say government sucks at doing what it does and it's gotten a lot better at it and I believe

1:45:45.660 --> 1:45:52.140
 it can keep getting better as it gets smaller and you leverage as companies more and more.

1:45:52.140 --> 1:45:59.620
 But you're saying, no, no, no, government is fundamentally as an idea gets in the way

1:45:59.620 --> 1:46:03.100
 of companies that should be doing those things anyway.

1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:07.620
 I just think that companies, when you take away government, will start looking like government.

1:46:07.620 --> 1:46:11.500
 Jessica, something looks like something does not mean it's the same.

1:46:11.500 --> 1:46:16.900
 If someone puts out a yarmulke and to fill in and they go to shul, they're not Jewish.

1:46:16.900 --> 1:46:18.220
 Right.

1:46:18.220 --> 1:46:23.980
 The basic objection you have with government, because you can leave, I apologize that this

1:46:23.980 --> 1:46:31.220
 is that stupid Twitter cliche statement, but your opposition to this idea of leaving the

1:46:31.220 --> 1:46:37.460
 United States is that it's just a lot of effort, it's too much friction.

1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:38.620
 That's not the option.

1:46:38.620 --> 1:46:43.820
 The opposition is, in the introduction to the book, I say anarchism can be summed up

1:46:43.820 --> 1:46:44.820
 in one sentence.

1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:46.500
 You do not speak for me.

1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:47.900
 Everything else is application.

1:46:47.900 --> 1:46:53.180
 So the claim that somebody I've never met or who I voted against, let's say, I hate

1:46:53.180 --> 1:46:56.980
 Donald Trump, I despise him, I want Hillary Clinton to be president.

1:46:56.980 --> 1:46:59.940
 Too bad, Trump's your president, but that's not what I want.

1:46:59.940 --> 1:47:05.100
 The idea that this person can come on me and make any claims onto one second of my time

1:47:05.100 --> 1:47:09.620
 as opposed to trying to persuade me, that is something that I, an anarchist, regard

1:47:09.620 --> 1:47:12.820
 as inherently evil and nonsensical.

1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:18.220
 But to operate large organizations, like you see this with cryptocurrency, there's governance,

1:47:18.220 --> 1:47:19.700
 you have to make difficult decisions.

1:47:19.700 --> 1:47:22.660
 There's a block size of wars for Bitcoin.

1:47:22.660 --> 1:47:27.540
 So there is a voting mechanism often with membership when you're subscription service.

1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:32.500
 See, the thing is you're using these words and you're switching definitions because if

1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:36.580
 I go to a store, I can technically say I'm voting for Tropicana orange juice as opposed

1:47:36.580 --> 1:47:41.180
 to another one, but to kind of say, oh, well, you're making a choice there for every choice

1:47:41.180 --> 1:47:42.180
 is a vote.

1:47:42.180 --> 1:47:44.700
 I don't, I think that that's something that the Venn diagram is not right.

1:47:44.700 --> 1:47:47.060
 No, I literally mean vote in this case, not money.

1:47:47.060 --> 1:47:48.060
 Okay.

1:47:48.060 --> 1:47:52.500
 There's some decisions like should Bitcoin have increases block size?

1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:53.500
 Okay.

1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:56.940
 There's a bunch of different, they're called soft forks or hard forks.

1:47:56.940 --> 1:47:58.980
 Oh, I'm not saying you should never vote.

1:47:58.980 --> 1:48:00.860
 Like stockholders have to vote, right?

1:48:00.860 --> 1:48:01.860
 Exactly.

1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:04.420
 So pretense, here's, let's look at this.

1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:06.260
 If you want to build robots, right?

1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:09.060
 You would sit down with the company, you would, you guys would be like, we should do this

1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:10.780
 kind of robot, we should do this kind of robot.

1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:14.860
 The stockholders would have a vote or the board in proportion to their investment in

1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:15.860
 the firm.

1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:21.980
 Me, who knows nothing about robots, I am the idea that I'm in a position to walk in and

1:48:21.980 --> 1:48:26.860
 be like, this is what you should do is crazy and bizarre and wrong because I'm not in an

1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.060
 informed position.

1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:33.500
 So what democracy does is it forces people who run businesses well to run businesses

1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:37.540
 poorly by people who don't know how to run businesses at all.

1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:39.220
 That's one of the many concerns.

1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:43.020
 But you're saying that's the fundamental property of the state.

1:48:43.020 --> 1:48:47.780
 I have a sense that the state could become as effective as what we think of as companies.

1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:49.020
 I mean, as...

1:48:49.020 --> 1:48:54.300
 This is why they can't because the state does not have access to data the way that firms

1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:55.300
 do.

1:48:55.300 --> 1:48:59.660
 This is one of Ludwig von Mises's great points when he called the calculation problem.

1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:04.780
 If I'm looking at comic books, right, and I have detective comics, if detective comics

1:49:04.780 --> 1:49:12.500
 26 is a thousand and detective comics 28 is a thousand and detective comics 27 is 50,000,

1:49:12.500 --> 1:49:16.780
 that is telling me that even if I don't know anything about comics, that detective comics

1:49:16.780 --> 1:49:21.620
 27 is either very, very scarce for some reason or very, very desirable.

1:49:21.620 --> 1:49:24.900
 It's the first appearance of Batman, whatever, but you don't need to know that to just look

1:49:24.900 --> 1:49:28.620
 at this data and be like, okay, this is the market, tell me something.

1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:33.100
 If prices are set by the government, which the government is a monopoly, I have no way

1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:35.060
 of picking those winners or losers.

1:49:35.060 --> 1:49:40.620
 I don't have that data of supply and demand of an entire nation or a world of people making

1:49:40.620 --> 1:49:47.420
 individual decisions and having price be dynamic and informing me as the organization where

1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:49.380
 I should allocate my resources.

1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:58.100
 So the price is a really strong signal that allows you to operate a voluntary collective

1:49:58.100 --> 1:50:01.900
 where people get what they want and don't get what they don't want.

1:50:01.900 --> 1:50:04.580
 And it tells me what to produce, but not to produce.

1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:08.700
 And it also is great because if I see this podcast thing in history, which didn't exist

1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:14.660
 five years ago, and now these people are making bank, that tells me as someone who is an investor,

1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:21.300
 okay, they're making 50%, whatever, 10% profit on their capital in the plant industry, it's

1:50:21.300 --> 1:50:22.300
 2%.

1:50:22.300 --> 1:50:26.940
 If I, I'm going to further my capital into this 10% and that's going to lower the profit

1:50:26.940 --> 1:50:29.060
 rate as that builds up.

1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:32.500
 And that is how markets are regulated voluntarily.

1:50:32.500 --> 1:50:38.500
 But the word government, I just think it's possible to have collectives that, of human

1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:42.020
 beings that represent others based on their voluntary...

1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:48.540
 Yes, of course, you have private governance, any company, you're going to have a CEO, you're

1:50:48.540 --> 1:50:50.060
 going to have a board directors.

1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:58.020
 But then you, I just, it starts to look very similar to me, a successful private governance

1:50:58.020 --> 1:51:04.260
 mechanism at a scale of the United States starts looking a whole lot like the current

1:51:04.260 --> 1:51:07.620
 government of the United States.

1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:12.500
 Even Amazon, I don't think is anything close to the federal budget wise or budget wise

1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:13.500
 or power wise.

1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:14.500
 No.

1:51:14.500 --> 1:51:17.860
 So you're saying you just, it's not even state.

1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:21.540
 It's almost like anything at that size, you want to keep things smaller.

1:51:21.540 --> 1:51:29.220
 And I don't, markets are not going to combine to that level of the state because Jeff Bezos

1:51:29.220 --> 1:51:34.420
 will never in position to tell everyone in America, I'm going to take 40% of your money

1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:35.620
 before you even see it.

1:51:35.620 --> 1:51:37.420
 That to me is actually unclear.

1:51:37.420 --> 1:51:41.660
 We don't know that to be true where that Google or Amazon can't grow to the size.

1:51:41.660 --> 1:51:46.220
 If you take away the US government, I'm not so sure that Amazon can't grow to the size

1:51:46.220 --> 1:51:47.220
 of the US government.

1:51:47.220 --> 1:51:48.220
 Okay.

1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:52.740
 So worst case scenario is, we're back where we started, right?

1:51:52.740 --> 1:51:54.220
 That's not worst case scenario.

1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:58.620
 But the concern is that Google is going to be the federal government?

1:51:58.620 --> 1:51:59.620
 That's not the concern.

1:51:59.620 --> 1:52:02.620
 I'm saying like, this is what it looks like when Google is the federal government.

1:52:02.620 --> 1:52:10.940
 It's like, to me, the US government is our best attempt so far to have large scale representation

1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:12.500
 of people's interests.

1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:15.620
 It really sucks, but it's our best attempt so far.

1:52:15.620 --> 1:52:17.420
 And the question is how to improve it.

1:52:17.420 --> 1:52:21.780
 Like if you take away all, if you take away the US government, I'm trying to see how do

1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:27.820
 we improve on that level, that scale of representation of people's interests.

1:52:27.820 --> 1:52:28.820
 Let me give you one example.

1:52:28.820 --> 1:52:30.780
 That's that people could wrap their heads on very easily.

1:52:30.780 --> 1:52:34.820
 I'm against government police monopoly, I'm for private security, right?

1:52:34.820 --> 1:52:37.220
 You don't have to be an anarchist to understand this.

1:52:37.220 --> 1:52:42.820
 Can everyone agree, or at least as a hypothesis, everyone can wrap the heads around, here's

1:52:42.820 --> 1:52:45.020
 a big concern, 911, right?

1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:47.380
 I've heard this 911 call, it's very chilling.

1:52:47.380 --> 1:52:50.140
 There's a kid in a closet, his family's being murdered outside, right?

1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:51.900
 He has the call 911, he's whispering.

1:52:51.900 --> 1:52:53.980
 It's horrifying to hear.

1:52:53.980 --> 1:52:59.600
 There's no reason why the number I call for my family's being murdered is the same number

1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:02.700
 I call for the fire department is the same number I call for an ambulance.

1:53:02.700 --> 1:53:06.780
 What if instead you're operated like Uber, you have buttons on your phone, there's a

1:53:06.780 --> 1:53:11.380
 real emergency, like someone's gun flyers, someone's being killed, you press this and

1:53:11.380 --> 1:53:16.700
 it sends instead of the one police district, whatever company is nearby, you have a bunch

1:53:16.700 --> 1:53:20.300
 of them and they're the ones who are going to come to your house to save you.

1:53:20.300 --> 1:53:22.300
 People can wrap their heads around that very easily.

1:53:22.300 --> 1:53:27.540
 That is one very clear way to go from having a government security monopoly towards having

1:53:27.540 --> 1:53:29.940
 a more free enterprise system.

1:53:29.940 --> 1:53:35.340
 When you apply that to pretty much anything, it doesn't become that complicated of alternative.

1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:42.300
 What I would, you're going to criticize this, but I believe the government, it's like the

1:53:42.300 --> 1:53:44.060
 parenting thing we talked about earlier.

1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:51.820
 I think it creates a safe space for a, I'm for safe spaces, so I'm not going to laugh

1:53:51.820 --> 1:53:52.820
 you about that.

1:53:52.820 --> 1:53:53.820
 No.

1:53:53.820 --> 1:53:54.820
 I want people to be safe.

1:53:54.820 --> 1:53:57.660
 I want a safe space for entrepreneurship.

1:53:57.660 --> 1:54:02.180
 I believe that good government, hold on a second, give me a second.

1:54:02.180 --> 1:54:03.180
 Sure, sure.

1:54:03.180 --> 1:54:04.180
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:54:04.180 --> 1:54:05.180
 You're right.

1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:06.180
 You're right.

1:54:06.180 --> 1:54:07.180
 I'm sorry.

1:54:07.180 --> 1:54:11.580
 I think government gives opportunity for companies to outcompet it.

1:54:11.580 --> 1:54:12.580
 Yes.

1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:16.460
 UPS, FedEx, 100%, not a question.

1:54:16.460 --> 1:54:23.820
 I believe you need to have government to give a chance for UPS FedEx, for SpaceX, for

1:54:23.820 --> 1:54:30.660
 SpaceX, what was the next in there, to pop up and then government will naturally back

1:54:30.660 --> 1:54:33.420
 off from that place.

1:54:33.420 --> 1:54:37.100
 But you need the innovator to step in and build the thing.

1:54:37.100 --> 1:54:38.100
 You can't just...

1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:39.860
 When has government ever backed off though?

1:54:39.860 --> 1:54:41.260
 That never happens.

1:54:41.260 --> 1:54:47.620
 Back from FedEx and UPS, from SpaceX, from Amazon.

1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:49.540
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:53.780
 The US Postal Service still competes with FedEx and UPS, so here's the other thing.

1:54:53.780 --> 1:54:54.780
 Not nearly...

1:54:54.780 --> 1:54:56.380
 Not well, but they still exist.

1:54:56.380 --> 1:54:57.380
 The point is...

1:54:57.380 --> 1:54:58.380
 They're dying.

1:54:58.380 --> 1:55:03.100
 But UPS and FedEx are taxed, so not only are they paying for their own company, they're

1:55:03.100 --> 1:55:06.260
 paying for this competitor, this is the essential difference.

1:55:06.260 --> 1:55:10.380
 Imagine if you didn't have UPS, excuse me, federal government, no post office.

1:55:10.380 --> 1:55:13.980
 So you had FedEx, you have DHL, you have US Postal Service and many others.

1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:22.500
 How about in this scenario, UPS has the capacity to take 20% of FedEx's DHL and courier's money

1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:25.260
 and put in their own pocket and they never have to do anything in return.

1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:29.380
 This is going to be an enormous advantage of UPS, and then when you add the addition

1:55:29.380 --> 1:55:32.980
 that UPS is not necessarily going to be more efficient than the others, this is going to

1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:35.300
 be a huge distortion in the market.

1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:38.940
 Can you imagine if your podcast, you just automatically got 20% of the views of everybody

1:55:38.940 --> 1:55:39.940
 else?

1:55:39.940 --> 1:55:43.180
 I mean, would there be any incentive for you to be great, or you could just send in your

1:55:43.180 --> 1:55:46.140
 laurels and do whatever you want, even more than now?

1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:48.540
 It's hard to imagine more than now.

1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:51.340
 That's because you're a robot and lack imagination.

1:55:51.340 --> 1:55:56.260
 I think there just has to be, of course, you can do it completely without government,

1:55:56.260 --> 1:55:57.260
 but government...

1:55:57.260 --> 1:55:58.260
 That's all I need to hear.

1:55:58.260 --> 1:55:59.260
 Okay.

1:55:59.260 --> 1:56:00.260
 That's all I need to hear.

1:56:00.260 --> 1:56:01.260
 Shows over.

1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:02.260
 Shows over.

1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:03.260
 What's you can do without government?

1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:09.740
 The question is that safety net that's needed for entrepreneurship, that's needed for...

1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:13.580
 I'm sorry to say, but I have a sense that there needs to be a bit of a safety net for

1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:14.580
 freedom.

1:56:14.580 --> 1:56:18.740
 I'm much more comfortable with saying you need a safety net for freedom than you need

1:56:18.740 --> 1:56:20.220
 one for entrepreneurs.

1:56:20.220 --> 1:56:25.780
 The beauty of markets is with your startup, if you have a startup and it completely fails,

1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:28.460
 the only person who's screwed is you and your investors.

1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:32.660
 If I'm a government and I make a startup, the entire society fails, like the Iraq war.

1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:36.540
 If I have this Kaka Mami plan, everyone else doesn't have a choice.

1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:40.380
 They are both funding it and sometimes even drafted or forced into it.

1:56:40.380 --> 1:56:43.860
 The safety net, let's get back to the early anarchists.

1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:47.780
 One of the things that I admire about them, the anarcho communists, the old school left

1:56:47.780 --> 1:56:51.660
 anarchists, is people don't remember what context they were in.

1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:53.740
 They were in context without a welfare state.

1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:56.460
 They're immigrating in huge numbers from Eastern Europe.

1:56:56.460 --> 1:56:57.460
 People are...

1:56:57.460 --> 1:57:00.460
 You go to the Tenement Museum in New York, people like 12 to a room, kids are working

1:57:00.460 --> 1:57:03.420
 in factories or they're either working in factories or they have to starve.

1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:06.500
 It's not like their parents didn't love them, it's that the parents didn't have birth control,

1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:07.700
 which was a felony.

1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:11.580
 They also weren't in positions but food on the table for their kids because they're uneducated

1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:13.260
 and the jobs are paying nothing.

1:57:13.260 --> 1:57:17.740
 You could understand why Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Prudone, and all these other things

1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:19.780
 were like, this is untenable.

1:57:19.780 --> 1:57:26.700
 We see Carnegie with 80,000 mansions, whereas this lady whose husband died at age 30, who's

1:57:26.700 --> 1:57:31.060
 never been to high school or even junior high school, has 10 kids.

1:57:31.060 --> 1:57:32.300
 How's she going to put food on the table?

1:57:32.300 --> 1:57:33.380
 It's not going to happen.

1:57:33.380 --> 1:57:36.820
 You can understand why they would be like, all right, we need to seize this money and

1:57:36.820 --> 1:57:37.900
 distribute it around the people.

1:57:37.900 --> 1:57:39.180
 That makes a lot of sense.

1:57:39.180 --> 1:57:44.860
 In a contemporary context where food is much cheaper, where shelter to some extent is more

1:57:44.860 --> 1:57:53.180
 available, when medical care, we're so oblivious to how bad things were that we see things

1:57:53.180 --> 1:57:56.140
 are bad now, so we assume that they were better than in some context.

1:57:56.140 --> 1:57:59.220
 They were much, much worse there in many contexts.

1:57:59.220 --> 1:58:04.660
 If you're going to make an argument for government, for me, the strongest argument is food stamps

1:58:04.660 --> 1:58:10.660
 or free lunches for children because I agree that would be very inefficient and it's going

1:58:10.660 --> 1:58:15.020
 to probably make them obese because you're going to have Nabisco lobbying to make sure

1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:19.500
 that if you're going to have this protein, you're not going to give the kids an Oreo,

1:58:19.500 --> 1:58:20.500
 aren't you?

1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:21.500
 These kids are poor.

1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:24.940
 You want them to have some pleasure and that's going to have deleterious effects, but if

1:58:24.940 --> 1:58:29.980
 the choice is an inefficient government program and mass starvation, that is one where as

1:58:29.980 --> 1:58:36.180
 an anarchist, I could easily see making the argument for that one.

1:58:36.180 --> 1:58:39.500
 Even though I think very clearly private charity would be more efficient and distribute it

1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:42.780
 more effectively, but at that point, I don't really care about efficiency.

1:58:42.780 --> 1:58:46.980
 If you're throwing out food to make sure these kids get fed, I don't care.

1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:55.420
 Would engagement in military conflict be one of the biggest negative things about the state

1:58:55.420 --> 1:58:56.420
 to you?

1:58:56.420 --> 1:58:57.420
 Yeah, of course.

1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:58.420
 Wars.

1:58:58.420 --> 1:58:59.420
 War is the state at its worst.

1:58:59.420 --> 1:59:02.020
 So if we take away war, would you be much…

1:59:02.020 --> 1:59:04.420
 Or make it defensive instead of aggressive.

1:59:04.420 --> 1:59:05.420
 Yeah.

1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:09.420
 I mean, wouldn't that be a huge step forward if the war, instead of regarded…

1:59:09.420 --> 1:59:11.100
 This is what drives me crazy.

1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:16.580
 We're taught as kids in school that war is a last resort, and I agree with that.

1:59:16.580 --> 1:59:21.700
 And yet when you look at the corporate press, war is always the first response.

1:59:21.700 --> 1:59:26.580
 And these people do not talk about what war means.

1:59:26.580 --> 1:59:31.700
 They'll show examples during the Bush years of soldiers coming home in caskets, which

1:59:31.700 --> 1:59:36.900
 already is an unacceptable price in many cases for me, but they don't even pretend to care

1:59:36.900 --> 1:59:41.660
 about the people overseas whose countries we've ransacked and lives were ruined.

1:59:41.660 --> 1:59:44.620
 And it's just like, well, what are you going to do, not ransack those countries?

1:59:44.620 --> 1:59:49.300
 So that war, to me, is the state at its worst.

1:59:49.300 --> 1:59:55.140
 See I think that there is value from small government that doesn't engage in wars.

1:59:55.140 --> 2:00:01.620
 I do think that the kind of collectives that you imagine functioning well would look like

2:00:01.620 --> 2:00:04.260
 the best version of government that I imagine.

2:00:04.260 --> 2:00:05.260
 Okay, great.

2:00:05.260 --> 2:00:06.260
 What a great endorsement.

2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:08.640
 Well, I see them as the same.

2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:10.940
 I think a lot of it is just terminology.

2:00:10.940 --> 2:00:15.580
 I have no problem saying that I'm using the word anarchism incorrectly and to go for

2:00:15.580 --> 2:00:16.580
 what you want.

2:00:16.580 --> 2:00:21.380
 I have no problem with that or anything, really, because like I said, life is beautiful.

2:00:21.380 --> 2:00:29.220
 But nevertheless, you wrote the essay, why I'm not going to vote this time or ever.

2:00:29.220 --> 2:00:33.980
 Yeah, why won't vote this year or any other year or any year?

2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:34.980
 And the basic idea...

2:00:34.980 --> 2:00:37.500
 You can do a better job reading it than you just read that title.

2:00:37.500 --> 2:00:42.220
 I guess you'll take as many takes as necessary.

2:00:42.220 --> 2:00:45.420
 I'll read it in Russian and then pay somebody to translate it.

2:00:45.420 --> 2:00:49.220
 This isn't even Russian at all, he's just making up words.

2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:51.580
 Where'd you find this guy?

2:00:51.580 --> 2:00:55.300
 You get what you pay for.

2:00:55.300 --> 2:00:57.420
 Yeah, exactly.

2:00:57.420 --> 2:00:58.420
 This is anarchy.

2:00:58.420 --> 2:01:03.020
 This is what you wanted.

2:01:03.020 --> 2:01:09.140
 Like your basic summary is, let me see, if pressed, the simplest explanation I have for

2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:16.180
 refusing to vote is this, I don't vote for the same exact reasons that I don't take communion.

2:01:16.180 --> 2:01:22.020
 No matter how admirable he is or how much I agree with him, the Pope isn't the steward

2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:27.800
 over my soul, nor is any president the leader of my life.

2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:32.420
 This does not make me ignorant or evil any more than not being a Christian makes me ignorant

2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:33.580
 or evil.

2:01:33.580 --> 2:01:38.780
 If I need representation, I will hire the most qualified person to do so.

2:01:38.780 --> 2:01:44.340
 Isn't voting our current best developed way of hiring the most qualified person to represent

2:01:44.340 --> 2:01:45.740
 you on some things?

2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:50.940
 No, because if I have a lawyer and the lawyer screws up, I can fire him.

2:01:50.940 --> 2:01:53.460
 If I vote for someone, I don't get who I want.

2:01:53.460 --> 2:01:57.740
 I get for who my neighbors want, so that makes no sense.

2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:03.180
 Election means I want you to speak for me, whereas voting is like, I kind of want you,

2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:04.460
 but I'll take what I can get.

2:02:04.460 --> 2:02:08.140
 I'm going to take what I can get regardless, so what's the point?

2:02:08.140 --> 2:02:11.740
 In governance, again, that's what Bitcoin is.

2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:15.580
 You want to be represented in deciding what to do, but once...

2:02:15.580 --> 2:02:17.740
 Wait, Bitcoin isn't picking a person.

2:02:17.740 --> 2:02:19.620
 They're not picking a president of Bitcoin.

2:02:19.620 --> 2:02:21.060
 They're picking an idea.

2:02:21.060 --> 2:02:22.860
 It's more like a referendum.

2:02:22.860 --> 2:02:30.100
 To me, a referendum is much more coherent and defensible than it is voting for representative,

2:02:30.100 --> 2:02:35.940
 because if I'm voting for Joe Biden, I'm saying this person speaks for me for abortion, taxation,

2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:38.460
 environmental policy, immigration, war, right?

2:02:38.460 --> 2:02:42.660
 The odds that unless you're a complete NPC that this one person will speak for you for

2:02:42.660 --> 2:02:47.300
 everything and will deliver what he promised and has the power to deliver what he promised

2:02:47.300 --> 2:02:48.300
 is not true.

2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:54.060
 Whereas if I have Brexit, if I say I want Britain to remain part of the European Union

2:02:54.060 --> 2:02:57.900
 to say yes or no question, that makes a lot more sense to me.

2:02:57.900 --> 2:03:02.180
 But even that is not pure democracy, because going back to the idea of the circulation

2:03:02.180 --> 2:03:06.740
 of elites, which James Burnham talked about, Pareto and Mosca and all them, you are still

2:03:06.740 --> 2:03:11.380
 going to have someone telling you what you can and can't vote for and how these questions

2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:12.380
 are framed.

2:03:12.380 --> 2:03:17.900
 So, contradiction to what the left anarchist said, some element of hierarchy is always

2:03:17.900 --> 2:03:21.660
 going to be inevitable.

2:03:21.660 --> 2:03:27.980
 So listen, I agree with this aspect very much so that we should be voting for ideas and

2:03:27.980 --> 2:03:33.500
 issues, not voting for leaders, for leaders to represent this across the full spectrum

2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:34.500
 of issues.

2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:35.500
 Right.

2:03:35.500 --> 2:03:36.500
 It seems to make no sense.

2:03:36.500 --> 2:03:37.500
 Okay, good.

2:03:37.500 --> 2:03:38.500
 Yeah, this is great.

2:03:38.500 --> 2:03:44.220
 But I do think there should be a leader, I do believe in voting for representatives

2:03:44.220 --> 2:03:48.500
 to debate, to be communicators of ideas to us.

2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:52.740
 But let me start interrupting, but you could have those two things.

2:03:52.740 --> 2:03:55.820
 For example, wouldn't this be an improvement if they have that now?

2:03:55.820 --> 2:03:59.540
 You have a referendum, do you want tax rate to be 30 or 40, whatever percent?

2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:03.820
 You have the guy leading the campaign for 50, fight for 50, then you have the lady leading

2:04:03.820 --> 2:04:07.980
 the campaign for 40, fight for 40, they'll go out there, they can have debates, they

2:04:07.980 --> 2:04:11.180
 can talk about the issue, but you're still not voting for one of them, you're voting

2:04:11.180 --> 2:04:12.340
 for the issue.

2:04:12.340 --> 2:04:16.220
 That makes much more sense to me than I'm going to vote for him and hope that he puts

2:04:16.220 --> 2:04:18.860
 forward 50 and that depends on 99 other senators.

2:04:18.860 --> 2:04:19.860
 Exactly.

2:04:19.860 --> 2:04:23.660
 But also, I mean, I do like the idea of voting for certain people to debate certain ideas.

2:04:23.660 --> 2:04:24.660
 Yes.

2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:25.660
 I think that's a major improvement.

2:04:25.660 --> 2:04:27.980
 But the final vote should be based on the idea.

2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:29.340
 So, okay, so we agree.

2:04:29.340 --> 2:04:35.740
 That would be nice to have plus no wars and then you'll stop tweeting so aggressively.

2:04:35.740 --> 2:04:39.260
 And to decriminalize things that don't hurt people.

2:04:39.260 --> 2:04:40.260
 Drugs.

2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:43.900
 Drugs especially, prostitution is a big one.

2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:47.220
 And this is me talking, Mr. All Cops or Criminals.

2:04:47.220 --> 2:04:52.620
 There's no one or maybe other than abused children who needs access to the police other

2:04:52.620 --> 2:04:54.260
 than sex workers.

2:04:54.260 --> 2:04:58.580
 They're the ones who are the most likely to really put themselves in danger situation,

2:04:58.580 --> 2:05:02.980
 so they need to be able to call security because that's why they have pimps because you're

2:05:02.980 --> 2:05:07.220
 a woman dealing with some strange dudes who are a lot of the time going to have weird

2:05:07.220 --> 2:05:11.740
 kinks, you want to be able to be sure, even if you don't approve a prostitution, think

2:05:11.740 --> 2:05:15.820
 it's horrible, that she's not going to be raped and murdered and have no consequences.

2:05:15.820 --> 2:05:19.780
 And if you're going to say, oh, well, she's a prostitute, she can't be raped, just think

2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:20.780
 for a second.

2:05:20.780 --> 2:05:23.900
 If you're agreeing to sleep with somebody and then he starts choking you and being the

2:05:23.900 --> 2:05:27.900
 crap out of you and saying, it's now it's a dumb situation, that is clearly beyond the

2:05:27.900 --> 2:05:28.900
 pale salt.

2:05:28.900 --> 2:05:35.860
 And the same thing with drugs, heroin, cocaine, you crack.

2:05:35.860 --> 2:05:39.940
 The people that need help the most are the ones who are addicted to those drugs.

2:05:39.940 --> 2:05:43.420
 But even the ones who need punishment, let's suppose you think drug dealers should be in

2:05:43.420 --> 2:05:44.700
 jail, right?

2:05:44.700 --> 2:05:51.300
 It is very hard for me to say that someone who sells cocaine should be treated or in

2:05:51.300 --> 2:05:55.340
 the same building as someone who rapes children or is a murderer.

2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:58.780
 These are not similar types of evil, even if you believe that that drug dealer is an

2:05:58.780 --> 2:05:59.780
 evil person.

2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:00.780
 Yeah.

2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:06.140
 I mean, there's an essay in there called by Alexander Berkman, who is Emma Goldman's

2:06:06.140 --> 2:06:09.140
 partner crime on prisons and crime.

2:06:09.140 --> 2:06:13.260
 And this is left as met its best for getting the person is forgotten.

2:06:13.260 --> 2:06:17.220
 And the fact that we have the world's largest prison population, the fact that so many people

2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:20.700
 are just like, oh, you commit a crime, just put them in jail, throw away the key.

2:06:20.700 --> 2:06:24.300
 At the very least, if you want to be totally immoral about it, it's expensive.

2:06:24.300 --> 2:06:28.260
 And second of all, the concept that all criminals should be locked in a room together in these

2:06:28.260 --> 2:06:31.820
 kind of largely inhuman conditions, and that's going to help people.

2:06:31.820 --> 2:06:34.220
 I don't think that that's the ideal mechanism.

2:06:34.220 --> 2:06:35.220
 Yeah.

2:06:35.220 --> 2:06:40.220
 I tend to believe, I usually don't speak so negatively about politicians, but I do think

2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:46.660
 that politicians have done more evil in the war on drugs than did the people that are

2:06:46.660 --> 2:06:49.020
 supposed to believe the criminals in this picture.

2:06:49.020 --> 2:06:52.980
 And I'll give you another example of how this is the anarchist critique of power.

2:06:52.980 --> 2:06:55.740
 Hunter Biden, and I'm not going to, I'm not making fun of him, I'm not taking a shot

2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:56.740
 to him.

2:06:56.740 --> 2:07:01.020
 There's an article in The New Yorker where he talks about when he was in LA, he was

2:07:01.020 --> 2:07:05.380
 buying crack and there was a misunderstanding or like he left the crack pipe in the Hertz

2:07:05.380 --> 2:07:07.740
 car and then blah, blah, blah, there's an issue.

2:07:07.740 --> 2:07:12.220
 He's admitting to a felony in writing to a reporter, and I'm sure this was within the

2:07:12.220 --> 2:07:14.020
 statute of limitations.

2:07:14.020 --> 2:07:17.220
 There was no possibility he was going to have consequences.

2:07:17.220 --> 2:07:22.420
 Kamala Harris, who was a cop, talked about when she was in college, she was smoking weed,

2:07:22.420 --> 2:07:27.780
 and it's like, I don't begrudge you guys smoking your crack or smoking your weed, but for other

2:07:27.780 --> 2:07:32.780
 people who are poor or maybe just have the short end of the stick, this is years of their

2:07:32.780 --> 2:07:35.220
 life being destroyed.

2:07:35.220 --> 2:07:37.940
 At the very least, even a rest is a traumatic situation.

2:07:37.940 --> 2:07:41.300
 If you have a weed or cocaine or crack, you're arrested.

2:07:41.300 --> 2:07:44.860
 That's really going to screw up, it's going to do a number on you being locked up.

2:07:44.860 --> 2:07:50.060
 So to have that double standard to me is completely unacceptable, and that has nothing to do with

2:07:50.060 --> 2:07:51.540
 the Republican or Democrat.

2:07:51.540 --> 2:07:55.220
 George W. Bush was a cokehead back in the day.

2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:59.500
 He talks about overcoming his addiction, and I'm glad that he did more power to him.

2:07:59.500 --> 2:08:04.980
 But just to have this kind of, it's just really kind of disturbing to me, and this is my anarchist

2:08:04.980 --> 2:08:07.980
 brain, how prevalent drug use is in college.

2:08:07.980 --> 2:08:11.100
 I think it was a joke on South Park, there's a time and a place to try drugs, and that's

2:08:11.100 --> 2:08:13.060
 called college, where people experiment.

2:08:13.060 --> 2:08:17.140
 But all those college kids, which are going to become next generation's elite, don't really

2:08:17.140 --> 2:08:21.580
 have that worry that if they get caught, then anything's going to happen to them.

2:08:21.580 --> 2:08:25.660
 But that kid in the street who did not have that good upbringing, even if he's a piece

2:08:25.660 --> 2:08:29.340
 of crap, he's not going to have a different punishment.

2:08:29.340 --> 2:08:33.340
 I think that's just really, that is based on American.

2:08:33.340 --> 2:08:39.820
 So in contrast to Tolstoy, let me ask you about Emma Goldman, you wrote that if anarchism

2:08:39.820 --> 2:08:46.580
 believed in rulers, then Emma Goldman would be the undisputed queen.

2:08:46.580 --> 2:08:51.940
 What ideas to find her flavor of anarchism, would you say?

2:08:51.940 --> 2:08:56.420
 Emma was really an old school radical.

2:08:56.420 --> 2:08:58.780
 She was a radical among radicals.

2:08:58.780 --> 2:09:03.980
 I don't know what ideas, I mean, what would the ideas to find her was anarchism, obviously.

2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:04.980
 There's the violence.

2:09:04.980 --> 2:09:11.420
 I mean, she was more open to the idea of violent opposition versus something like Tolstoy.

2:09:11.420 --> 2:09:12.620
 Oh, sure, for sure.

2:09:12.620 --> 2:09:17.340
 So basically, Emma and Alexander Bergman, their mentor was someone named Johann Most.

2:09:17.340 --> 2:09:22.540
 And Johann Most was a very early free speech, not very early, but he was a free speech concern

2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:26.860
 because he published a pamphlet in Europe that was translated in the States about how

2:09:26.860 --> 2:09:28.540
 to build dynamite.

2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:32.060
 Because his idea was, all right, you have this oppressive government, this oppressive

2:09:32.060 --> 2:09:36.380
 police force that use batons and bolts against us.

2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:40.820
 The only way for us as the working class to level the playing field is through dynamite

2:09:40.820 --> 2:09:42.420
 and here's how you build it.

2:09:42.420 --> 2:09:46.460
 So the question is, all right, is this something that could be allowed to be legal now that

2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:50.340
 you're allowing the layman to, in his own house, build bombs?

2:09:50.340 --> 2:09:56.540
 So Johann Most, basically, they had a big parting of ways because when Alexander Bergman

2:09:56.540 --> 2:10:02.860
 tried to assassinate Frick, Johann said, no, no, no, this is not something I'm for.

2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:07.460
 And in fact, they thought with this assassination, this failed assassination, this would be the

2:10:07.460 --> 2:10:11.100
 thing that fired off the revolution because you had this strike, the Pinkerton's in a

2:10:11.100 --> 2:10:14.460
 vile, Pinkerton's getting killed, Strikers are getting killed.

2:10:14.460 --> 2:10:15.860
 This is what Marx predicted.

2:10:15.860 --> 2:10:18.980
 They're going to light the spark and everything's going to come falling down.

2:10:18.980 --> 2:10:23.100
 He ends up going to jail for 13 years instead, Alexander Bergman does.

2:10:23.100 --> 2:10:28.820
 And then Goldman and Bergman had a big issue because when Leon Solgaugh's killed McKinley

2:10:28.820 --> 2:10:32.700
 in 1901, it was really, it's kind of humorous in retrospect.

2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:34.820
 He gets arrested and they're like, why'd you kill the president?

2:10:34.820 --> 2:10:38.300
 He goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman and she's like, oh, damn it.

2:10:38.300 --> 2:10:42.540
 She's on the run, she's like, I don't even know this guy.

2:10:42.540 --> 2:10:47.100
 And she made the point about like, why is it worse than the president being killed in

2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:48.100
 somebody else?

2:10:48.100 --> 2:10:49.260
 We're all equal.

2:10:49.260 --> 2:10:52.980
 And you would think if you're against capitalism against the ruling class, this would be your

2:10:52.980 --> 2:10:54.100
 first target.

2:10:54.100 --> 2:11:01.300
 But Bergman, who went to jail, who tried to assassinate someone, he had said, McKinley,

2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:02.300
 this is your villain.

2:11:02.300 --> 2:11:03.540
 He's just a party hack.

2:11:03.540 --> 2:11:05.540
 He's like a symptom of the times.

2:11:05.540 --> 2:11:06.780
 This is foolish.

2:11:06.780 --> 2:11:08.220
 And Goldman disagreed with him.

2:11:08.220 --> 2:11:14.780
 He thought it wasn't necessarily justified, but it may have done something that was defensible.

2:11:14.780 --> 2:11:19.260
 So the three of them, you know, had their differences on the use of violence.

2:11:19.260 --> 2:11:23.820
 And in fact, when she came back from Russia and was denouncing it in her book, My Dissolution

2:11:23.820 --> 2:11:28.260
 in Russia, My Fur Dissolution in Russia, the last chapter, she goes, look, I'm not saying

2:11:28.260 --> 2:11:29.940
 I'm against violence.

2:11:29.940 --> 2:11:32.180
 When there's the revolution comes, we're going to have to use force.

2:11:32.180 --> 2:11:37.100
 She goes, but it's not the force of the state against the working class, against the masses.

2:11:37.100 --> 2:11:38.620
 This is exactly what we're opposed to.

2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:41.820
 This is a complete obscenity to our principle.

2:11:41.820 --> 2:11:43.300
 So that was interesting.

2:11:43.300 --> 2:11:50.660
 The fact that her periodical mother earth was a clearinghouse for many prominent ideas

2:11:50.660 --> 2:11:52.940
 of the day that weren't anarchist, but were certainly radical.

2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:55.860
 So she was a bit, and also she was like tiny, she was like five one.

2:11:55.860 --> 2:12:02.740
 So to have this little woman who was so feisty and talk back to Lenin, talk back to Lenin,

2:12:02.740 --> 2:12:07.420
 which she took on Lenin, Woodrow, Wilson, Jagger, Hoover was the one who deported her.

2:12:07.420 --> 2:12:12.740
 Someone who just, and the thing is you have to be careful because I think just like war,

2:12:12.740 --> 2:12:18.900
 it's very easy to glamorize violence and to regard it as something admirable or heroic,

2:12:18.900 --> 2:12:20.540
 like you're fighting for the cause.

2:12:20.540 --> 2:12:24.460
 But if you take it out of the romanticism, you're like, you're killing someone who had

2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:25.460
 kids.

2:12:25.460 --> 2:12:27.260
 You are, you know, killing someone with a family.

2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:30.820
 You're making your, if you're going to shoot someone, they're probably going to retaliate

2:12:30.820 --> 2:12:32.340
 twice as hard.

2:12:32.340 --> 2:12:34.900
 This sings its own song and this is a very dangerous road.

2:12:34.900 --> 2:12:35.900
 You're going down.

2:12:35.900 --> 2:12:41.420
 So you really need to be careful about what you're preaching here.

2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:46.460
 And you know, she kind of had this mixed feelings about it, but that is certainly not Emma Goldman

2:12:46.460 --> 2:12:47.460
 her best.

2:12:47.460 --> 2:12:54.060
 Emma Goldman her best was about the ultimate freedom of the individual of caring about

2:12:54.060 --> 2:12:58.900
 people who are desperately poor, who despised the corporate idea that we all had to be

2:12:58.900 --> 2:13:04.140
 made to cookie cutters and be interchangeable and all have to start work at the same time.

2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:08.260
 And basically our entire life, slave or corporation that have nothing to show for it while they

2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:13.420
 get wealthy and you have no opportunity for either productive work or creative work.

2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:19.340
 So that I think the valorization of kind of the lowest of the low is something I find

2:13:19.340 --> 2:13:20.340
 very admirable.

2:13:20.340 --> 2:13:24.620
 There's a quote of hers, which I think even for those of us who are, you know, for property

2:13:24.620 --> 2:13:30.780
 rights is left anarchism at its best, but she goes, go and ask for work.

2:13:30.780 --> 2:13:33.380
 If they don't give you work, ask for bread.

2:13:33.380 --> 2:13:35.260
 If they don't give you bread, take bread.

2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:38.780
 So the idea that like, if you're that poor and you're honestly trying to work and work

2:13:38.780 --> 2:13:43.660
 isn't available and you steal food to keep alive, that you shouldn't feel guilt about

2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:44.660
 it.

2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:46.060
 I don't know that I would disagree with that.

2:13:46.060 --> 2:13:50.580
 I think that there's something to be said at that point where it's just like, you know,

2:13:50.580 --> 2:13:54.860
 if property rights come between that and mass starvation, it's gonna be very hard for anyone

2:13:54.860 --> 2:13:56.420
 to make the case for property rights.

2:13:56.420 --> 2:14:00.860
 Now my argument is when you have free enterprise, food becomes so plentiful that now obesity

2:14:00.860 --> 2:14:01.900
 is an issue.

2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:06.380
 But at the time she did not have, of course, have that data to, you know, access.

2:14:06.380 --> 2:14:11.740
 Is there somebody you left out from the book that you thought about leaving in?

2:14:11.740 --> 2:14:14.060
 Like some interesting figures?

2:14:14.060 --> 2:14:15.980
 Yeah, there's a couple.

2:14:15.980 --> 2:14:22.780
 So Chomsky would have been one, of course, because he's one of the biggest anarchist

2:14:22.780 --> 2:14:26.060
 thinkers in contemporary times.

2:14:26.060 --> 2:14:30.020
 I was on the fence about Herbert Spencer because he's not an anarchist.

2:14:30.020 --> 2:14:32.100
 Chris Williamson is reading the chapter for the book.

2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:35.340
 He coined the term survival of the fittest and the chapter is called the right to ignore

2:14:35.340 --> 2:14:37.660
 the state from his book, Social Statics.

2:14:37.660 --> 2:14:42.380
 It was deleted from later editions, but Bill found it and reprinted it.

2:14:42.380 --> 2:14:47.340
 And Randolph Bourne, he was an early progressive.

2:14:47.340 --> 2:14:51.740
 He was the only one or one of the very few fighting against entering the Great War.

2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:55.740
 And he had an essay called War is the Health of the State, which is basically about how

2:14:55.740 --> 2:14:59.660
 states love war because it gives them an excuse to increase their power.

2:14:59.660 --> 2:15:03.260
 And it's very hard to argue against increasing state power in a time of war.

2:15:03.260 --> 2:15:07.300
 But since he was not himself an anarchist and there was plenty antiwar in there already,

2:15:07.300 --> 2:15:09.300
 I didn't include him, but those would be the ones.

2:15:09.300 --> 2:15:16.540
 Is there some people that you think the public would be surprised to learn that they are,

2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:17.940
 at least in part, anarchists?

2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:21.540
 I saw that Howard Zinn is supposed to be an anarchist.

2:15:21.540 --> 2:15:25.500
 I mean, is there just like Tolstoy is an anarchist.

2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:29.700
 Is there some people like that that you think in our modern life that would be surprised

2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:31.140
 to learn they're anarchists?

2:15:31.140 --> 2:15:34.220
 I can't think of any off the top of my head.

2:15:34.220 --> 2:15:37.900
 I mean, you could say Carl Hess, who was like Barry Goldwater, speechwriter from the

2:15:37.900 --> 2:15:41.460
 1964 campaign, but he's hardly a household name.

2:15:41.460 --> 2:15:48.180
 I mean, I think a lot of people would not ascribe to that term, but it's certainly informed

2:15:48.180 --> 2:15:51.500
 with this complete distrust of all authority.

2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:54.780
 Murray Rothbard had an essay, if I didn't include an admiral of the state, I was going

2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:55.780
 to include this one.

2:15:55.780 --> 2:15:57.300
 It's much, much shorter.

2:15:57.300 --> 2:16:00.700
 And his question was, who are our allies and who are our enemies?

2:16:00.700 --> 2:16:04.900
 And the point he made is there's lots of people who would call themselves anarchists who are

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:10.220
 of little use, whereas someone who is still like a minarchist or for government, but genuinely

2:16:10.220 --> 2:16:14.900
 hates the question Rothbard had is, if there's a button and you could press that you would

2:16:14.900 --> 2:16:18.340
 end the state, would you press it so fast, your finger would get a blister?

2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:22.100
 Those are our allies, even if they're somewhat of a minarchist.

2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:26.100
 So I think that is kind of a better lens of looking at it.

2:16:26.100 --> 2:16:31.620
 And I don't think anyone needs to really ascribe to anarchism as a whole ideology in so far

2:16:31.620 --> 2:16:36.740
 as you're seeing right now, many people in certain fringe elements are just essentially

2:16:36.740 --> 2:16:42.700
 or are decreasingly fringe and increasing mainstream elements are realizing that this

2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:47.420
 idea that whatever the state does is somehow morally binding or legitimate is something

2:16:47.420 --> 2:16:50.140
 that at least bears strong questioning.

2:16:50.140 --> 2:16:51.140
 Sure.

2:16:51.140 --> 2:16:57.700
 And I mean, I guess there's a lot of groups like the libertarians, for example, have some

2:16:57.700 --> 2:16:58.700
 element of that.

2:16:58.700 --> 2:16:59.700
 Oh, sure.

2:16:59.700 --> 2:17:00.700
 For sure.

2:17:00.700 --> 2:17:02.780
 It's something of the ways of government.

2:17:02.780 --> 2:17:07.820
 And also, I think what I love, I mean, if there's one issue where I would want people

2:17:07.820 --> 2:17:10.580
 to have this kind of analysis, it is war.

2:17:10.580 --> 2:17:15.940
 And it is like, okay, are you really sure, because this is 100% going to result in a

2:17:15.940 --> 2:17:20.780
 lot of people being killed, a lot of people being traumatized, a lot of people who are

2:17:20.780 --> 2:17:25.500
 never going to recover, children, innocent people, are you really sure this is the right

2:17:25.500 --> 2:17:26.780
 thing to do?

2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:30.860
 And I think a lot of times the answer is, well, it's the profitable thing to do.

2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:37.420
 And that is, I think, again, government and it's absolute most venal and worst.

2:17:37.420 --> 2:17:41.020
 You, Michael Malis, in many ways, are a New Yorker.

2:17:41.020 --> 2:17:42.020
 Oh, yes.

2:17:42.020 --> 2:17:43.460
 I'll give you one example.

2:17:43.460 --> 2:17:45.180
 I don't know where Austin is on the map.

2:17:45.180 --> 2:17:46.180
 No idea.

2:17:46.180 --> 2:17:47.180
 Not even kidding.

2:17:47.180 --> 2:17:48.180
 But does it even matter?

2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:50.140
 It doesn't matter.

2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:52.860
 But nevertheless, you've decided to move to Austin.

2:17:52.860 --> 2:17:53.860
 Yes.

2:17:53.860 --> 2:17:59.620
 Why do you think you're moving to Austin, or why are you moving both to Austin and away

2:17:59.620 --> 2:18:00.740
 from New York?

2:18:00.740 --> 2:18:05.660
 This was one of the, I hate it when people talk like this, but I'm going to do it anyway.

2:18:05.660 --> 2:18:08.940
 This was one of the hardest and easiest decisions of my life.

2:18:08.940 --> 2:18:13.460
 It was hard because I've lived in New York since I was two other than college.

2:18:13.460 --> 2:18:14.700
 It's the only home I've known.

2:18:14.700 --> 2:18:16.140
 I know it intimately.

2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:17.540
 I know all the cool spots.

2:18:17.540 --> 2:18:20.940
 I love it with every fiber of my being, or I did.

2:18:20.940 --> 2:18:26.340
 It was very much ingrained in my personality, my outlook about what cities can be and can't

2:18:26.340 --> 2:18:29.740
 be and should be and shouldn't be.

2:18:29.740 --> 2:18:36.140
 Deciding to move was not done, but when you see your crew, your chosen family, one by

2:18:36.140 --> 2:18:39.340
 one whittling away, it's not easy.

2:18:39.340 --> 2:18:40.340
 They all left.

2:18:40.340 --> 2:18:44.380
 There's just a couple of us left in New York.

2:18:44.380 --> 2:18:47.340
 I don't see any mechanism by which New York is going to improve.

2:18:47.340 --> 2:18:49.420
 Things are getting much worse all the time.

2:18:49.420 --> 2:18:51.780
 That's just completely outrageous.

2:18:51.780 --> 2:18:54.500
 Here I would have a huge crew.

2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:57.500
 I didn't realize how much cheaper real estate is than in New York.

2:18:57.500 --> 2:18:58.660
 This is another way.

2:18:58.660 --> 2:19:01.460
 New Yorkers are the most provincial people on earth who are completely oblivious to

2:19:01.460 --> 2:19:02.820
 the rest of the country.

2:19:02.820 --> 2:19:06.780
 For a long time, the argument was New York versus LA for certain types of people.

2:19:06.780 --> 2:19:08.980
 They would say LA is cheaper in terms of rent.

2:19:08.980 --> 2:19:12.740
 In New York, let's suppose the rent is 1,000, LA was 700, but you'd have to get a car.

2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:14.540
 I'm like, this is kind of a wash.

2:19:14.540 --> 2:19:19.500
 I assumed Austin would be like 80% of New York prices, and I'm looking at these houses

2:19:19.500 --> 2:19:25.020
 and for like 700,000, you could get a house here that would cost like 3.5 million New

2:19:25.020 --> 2:19:26.260
 York.

2:19:26.260 --> 2:19:27.260
 You could have a gun.

2:19:27.260 --> 2:19:30.860
 It's just like I could have a yard, and I could have a dog, and I could have a three

2:19:30.860 --> 2:19:36.140
 bedroom, and I could have aquariums and my weird plants.

2:19:36.140 --> 2:19:44.500
 To have all that, I am very, very lucky that I have such a supportive crew.

2:19:44.500 --> 2:19:49.740
 They're also very smart, because they sat me down and they said, whatever excuse you

2:19:49.740 --> 2:19:53.980
 have not to move here, we are going to make sure that doesn't count.

2:19:53.980 --> 2:19:59.220
 My buddy Matt said, because I have a huge library, he goes, I will go to your house

2:19:59.220 --> 2:20:04.340
 and I will pack every single book you own myself so you can get that as an excuse either

2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:05.340
 way.

2:20:05.340 --> 2:20:07.620
 I don't know how to drive in New York.

2:20:07.620 --> 2:20:10.300
 She's like, we're going to take driving lessons together.

2:20:10.300 --> 2:20:12.340
 There goes that excuse.

2:20:12.340 --> 2:20:13.820
 How do I find an apartment?

2:20:13.820 --> 2:20:17.500
 They're like, we'll go with the realtor and we'll take pictures for you.

2:20:17.500 --> 2:20:18.500
 We'll report back.

2:20:18.500 --> 2:20:20.300
 You could trust our judgment.

2:20:20.300 --> 2:20:21.300
 I would do that.

2:20:21.300 --> 2:20:23.780
 That sounds like fun shopping for house that up to buy them.

2:20:23.780 --> 2:20:29.620
 Then Matt, just yesterday had the idea, goes, come here, rent a furnished apartment for

2:20:29.620 --> 2:20:30.620
 a few months.

2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:34.460
 You don't have the pressure of buying, and it's going to be an easy transition.

2:20:34.460 --> 2:20:37.140
 The rent's not going to be anything compared to New York.

2:20:37.140 --> 2:20:39.540
 These are all very valid things.

2:20:39.540 --> 2:20:40.780
 You're here.

2:20:40.780 --> 2:20:41.780
 Lots of other people.

2:20:41.780 --> 2:20:47.260
 That's what this is, I made sure that's renting month to month.

2:20:47.260 --> 2:20:48.260
 This is rental.

2:20:48.260 --> 2:20:49.260
 This is rental.

2:20:49.260 --> 2:20:50.260
 You didn't realize this?

2:20:50.260 --> 2:20:51.260
 I thought you bought this.

2:20:51.260 --> 2:20:52.260
 No, no, no.

2:20:52.260 --> 2:20:53.260
 This is rental.

2:20:53.260 --> 2:20:54.260
 Talk.

2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:55.260
 Why?

2:20:55.260 --> 2:20:56.260
 I thought you bought it.

2:20:56.260 --> 2:20:57.260
 No, it's rental.

2:20:57.260 --> 2:20:58.260
 Well, it really values freedom.

2:20:58.260 --> 2:20:59.260
 Yeah, of course.

2:20:59.260 --> 2:21:00.260
 Who are you talking to?

2:21:00.260 --> 2:21:02.620
 Have you heard of this thing, freedom?

2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:05.460
 It's really great.

2:21:05.460 --> 2:21:08.980
 But not everybody, the implementation of freedom is different for everybody.

2:21:08.980 --> 2:21:09.980
 Of course.

2:21:09.980 --> 2:21:14.260
 I don't want to make a statement about others.

2:21:14.260 --> 2:21:15.620
 I'll just speak for myself.

2:21:15.620 --> 2:21:22.860
 I think when you buy a house, that is not just a wise financial decision or all those

2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:26.340
 kinds of reasons that people have, investment, all those kinds of things.

2:21:26.340 --> 2:21:31.980
 I think it's also a hit on your freedom because the positive way to frame that is you make

2:21:31.980 --> 2:21:32.980
 it a home.

2:21:32.980 --> 2:21:33.980
 Yes.

2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:38.540
 You have a deep connection to it, but the negative way to frame it is you're now a little bit

2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:39.540
 stuck there.

2:21:39.540 --> 2:21:44.740
 And you may stay there way longer than you should when much better opportunities for

2:21:44.740 --> 2:21:46.940
 life come up.

2:21:46.940 --> 2:21:50.020
 There are stages in life when you're not sure exactly what the future will hold.

2:21:50.020 --> 2:21:54.580
 I would argue that's very often the case, basically at every stage in life.

2:21:54.580 --> 2:22:03.100
 I just want to make sure I maximize the freedom to embrace the most ambitious, the craziest,

2:22:03.100 --> 2:22:07.340
 the wildest, the most beautiful opportunities that come by.

2:22:07.340 --> 2:22:10.500
 You've actually brought this up to, because I said I really enjoyed the conversation with

2:22:10.500 --> 2:22:17.860
 you and Iran, like you talking to you and somebody else.

2:22:17.860 --> 2:22:20.420
 I think you make a really significant effort.

2:22:20.420 --> 2:22:26.060
 You've said this before, but it really is true and it stands in contrast to other folks

2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:27.340
 who are also good conversation.

2:22:27.340 --> 2:22:32.060
 You really make an effort for that person, like to meet the person.

2:22:32.060 --> 2:22:33.260
 Oh, for sure.

2:22:33.260 --> 2:22:45.260
 And you made me realize it's an art form, but it's also just, it's a thing worth doing

2:22:45.260 --> 2:22:51.020
 of putting in that effort and that leap of humanity to reach the, whether you're talking

2:22:51.020 --> 2:22:58.700
 to Dave Rubin or Alex Jones or Joe or me, just those are different human beings.

2:22:58.700 --> 2:22:59.700
 Of course.

2:22:59.700 --> 2:23:00.700
 And then taking that leap is fascinating.

2:23:00.700 --> 2:23:04.660
 I mean, Dave, how do you think about that?

2:23:04.660 --> 2:23:08.860
 I'm a huge introvert, as you are, I think.

2:23:08.860 --> 2:23:17.980
 I feel very, very, very lucky that I get to get on a mic and run my mouth and for some

2:23:17.980 --> 2:23:20.100
 people, for some reason people like this.

2:23:20.100 --> 2:23:27.980
 So I know what it's like to have a good convo and I know what it's like to have a bad convo.

2:23:27.980 --> 2:23:33.860
 So before I'll do a show, I will have like some things I would want to talk about, then

2:23:33.860 --> 2:23:36.420
 I'll think about how to say them in an engaging way.

2:23:36.420 --> 2:23:38.220
 So I do my homework in that regard.

2:23:38.220 --> 2:23:45.140
 I'm also very good at or I pride myself at taking people who are cerebral or intellectual

2:23:45.140 --> 2:23:49.740
 and making them a little bit silly, but also making them feel safe to be silly because

2:23:49.740 --> 2:23:55.140
 I'm not going to be making a buffoon of them that we're having fun as opposed to disrespecting

2:23:55.140 --> 2:23:56.140
 the person.

2:23:56.140 --> 2:24:00.060
 I think we all saw that with Yaron, who's very cerebral, very serious, but we were all

2:24:00.060 --> 2:24:05.460
 cracking jokes and he was having good time and he knew even if I'm making fun of him

2:24:05.460 --> 2:24:09.820
 to his face, it is coming from a place of kindness and he's in on the joke and we're

2:24:09.820 --> 2:24:11.300
 all having fun.

2:24:11.300 --> 2:24:15.980
 That is something I try to do as much as possible.

2:24:15.980 --> 2:24:20.700
 I had an episode of my show a couple of weeks ago and someone who's been a friend of mine

2:24:20.700 --> 2:24:25.100
 for a long time and someone I admire a lot, Elizabeth Spires, she was the founding member

2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:28.660
 of Gawk, founding editor of Gawker.

2:24:28.660 --> 2:24:30.420
 She's worked for The Observer for Jared Kushner.

2:24:30.420 --> 2:24:36.340
 She's her resume second to none and she was on my show and she was talking, her politics

2:24:36.340 --> 2:24:39.980
 are pretty straightforward like corporate journalists, blue pilled politics.

2:24:39.980 --> 2:24:43.380
 And my audience was very upset that I wasn't pushing back or whatever.

2:24:43.380 --> 2:24:48.580
 I'm like, my job, if someone is coming to a place where the audience is at least giving

2:24:48.580 --> 2:24:54.780
 me somewhat hostile, is not to make her have negative consequences for doing something

2:24:54.780 --> 2:24:56.180
 that she didn't need to do.

2:24:56.180 --> 2:25:02.100
 My job is to make sure that the experience is a positive one for her as the host.

2:25:02.100 --> 2:25:07.540
 So when I'm the guest, I always feel that my job is to make the host look good and make

2:25:07.540 --> 2:25:09.660
 the host not feel like it's work.

2:25:09.660 --> 2:25:13.060
 And the audience really likes that because instead of it being an interview or intense,

2:25:13.060 --> 2:25:16.620
 it is a conversation, nine of us know what's going to happen.

2:25:16.620 --> 2:25:21.460
 And so this is something I think about a fair amount and I try to apply and insofar as

2:25:21.460 --> 2:25:25.900
 it successfully, I'm delighted and there's times when it's not successful and that's

2:25:25.900 --> 2:25:28.820
 a shame, but all we could do is do our best.

2:25:28.820 --> 2:25:29.820
 Yeah.

2:25:29.820 --> 2:25:30.820
 I really enjoyed that conversation with her.

2:25:30.820 --> 2:25:34.300
 I was surprised by the dislikes and all that kind of stuff.

2:25:34.300 --> 2:25:38.820
 Well, one of the things I always talk about is I don't care what my friends politics are.

2:25:38.820 --> 2:25:42.860
 I care about if I'm having a bad day, can I call them up and ask for advice?

2:25:42.860 --> 2:25:45.340
 And Elizabeth has been there for me in the past.

2:25:45.340 --> 2:25:49.060
 And then when I do it on a camera in front of Mike's people freaking out, I'm like, I'm

2:25:49.060 --> 2:25:51.180
 practicing what I preach.

2:25:51.180 --> 2:25:57.260
 My, the relationships are more important than someone's political views and it's not hypocrisy

2:25:57.260 --> 2:26:01.300
 at all to demonstrate that and not to push back.

2:26:01.300 --> 2:26:02.620
 And there was great humor there.

2:26:02.620 --> 2:26:07.620
 You're both a bit of trolls in very different ways, but nevertheless that connection, the

2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:11.500
 humor and the mutual respect and love that was all there.

2:26:11.500 --> 2:26:12.500
 Yeah.

2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:13.500
 Yeah.

2:26:13.500 --> 2:26:14.500
 It's just fascinating.

2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:16.460
 You've talked to Alex Jones a couple of days ago.

2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:17.460
 Sure.

2:26:17.460 --> 2:26:18.460
 Yeah.

2:26:18.460 --> 2:26:22.020
 But you've had him on your podcast this week.

2:26:22.020 --> 2:26:23.020
 Yeah.

2:26:23.020 --> 2:26:24.020
 This week.

2:26:24.020 --> 2:26:31.860
 I was kind of surprised that he mentioned that human animal hybrids was like the number,

2:26:31.860 --> 2:26:38.860
 the main conspiracy that people should look into to open their eyes to the, you know,

2:26:38.860 --> 2:26:42.540
 to all the, to the globalists, to all the conspiracies that are out there.

2:26:42.540 --> 2:26:44.500
 Was that surprising to you?

2:26:44.500 --> 2:26:51.300
 No, because I came in there with questions and I was very focused on corralling him and

2:26:51.300 --> 2:26:54.140
 having it be like kind of a coherent intellectual conversation.

2:26:54.140 --> 2:26:55.780
 That was a really, really good.

2:26:55.780 --> 2:26:57.980
 It was only an hour, but it was a very good conversation.

2:26:57.980 --> 2:26:58.980
 Yeah.

2:26:58.980 --> 2:26:59.980
 Thank you.

2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:04.260
 The response was overwhelmingly positive and I'm like, all right, I'm in a unique position

2:27:04.260 --> 2:27:08.780
 because Alex, I met Alex, well, that's not true, but I was on Alex, with Alex on Tim

2:27:08.780 --> 2:27:10.300
 Pool a couple of times.

2:27:10.300 --> 2:27:11.420
 It was Mayhem.

2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:14.140
 It was Anarchy and I'm like, all right, let me get.

2:27:14.140 --> 2:27:18.020
 But the thing is what people enjoyed is I was the one who was basically able to translate

2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:19.020
 Alex's.

2:27:19.020 --> 2:27:23.340
 He's obviously very performative and a lot of times Alex will say things that are not

2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:29.180
 really particularly controversial, but he'll say them in such a way that it sounds crazier

2:27:29.180 --> 2:27:30.180
 than it is.

2:27:30.180 --> 2:27:32.420
 You know, I think Joe's made this out of reservation as well.

2:27:32.420 --> 2:27:37.620
 So what I wanted to have him on when on my show is, all right, let's go through all these

2:27:37.620 --> 2:27:40.780
 conspiracies which have validity, which don't.

2:27:40.780 --> 2:27:43.900
 And I knew if I asked him, because he's got a lot of historical knowledge, even if you

2:27:43.900 --> 2:27:48.340
 think of a lot of it's nonsensical, let's sort out the wheat from the chaff.

2:27:48.340 --> 2:27:50.700
 You know, because everyone has someone craze in them.

2:27:50.700 --> 2:27:54.380
 I have this expression, you take one red pill, not the whole bottle.

2:27:54.380 --> 2:27:56.940
 You take the whole bottle of red pills, you assume literally everything in the media is

2:27:56.940 --> 2:28:00.980
 a lie that that's just not a coherent position to have is the weather a lie when they tell

2:28:00.980 --> 2:28:03.100
 you the temperature is going to be wrong tomorrow.

2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:05.460
 So that was fun to watch him go through that.

2:28:05.460 --> 2:28:10.860
 And he felt bad because he felt incorrectly, in my opinion, that he was needlessly aggressive

2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:12.380
 and disrespectful toward me on Tim.

2:28:12.380 --> 2:28:13.700
 I didn't feel disrespected at all.

2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:15.740
 I got heated, but I didn't take it personally.

2:28:15.740 --> 2:28:17.340
 People have heated debates all the time.

2:28:17.340 --> 2:28:21.620
 So I think he promised me he wouldn't interrupt and would be differential, but that because

2:28:21.620 --> 2:28:27.300
 he promised to be on his best behavior, that gave me an opportunity to address him seriously

2:28:27.300 --> 2:28:32.140
 and not to bring the clown aspect out of him, which is easy to caricature him.

2:28:32.140 --> 2:28:35.980
 My friend Ethan Suppley, who I'm sure people know, played a basically character based on

2:28:35.980 --> 2:28:40.300
 him and the hunt because Eric Alex is kind of this cartoon archetype.

2:28:40.300 --> 2:28:45.660
 So it was really fun to get another side of him.

2:28:45.660 --> 2:28:49.060
 And also it's just fun being on his show, just him being bombastic and just trying to

2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:50.980
 be the calm voice of reason.

2:28:50.980 --> 2:28:52.860
 And for once the trickster was Apollo.

2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:56.980
 Well, I like this thing he said before.

2:28:56.980 --> 2:29:03.500
 And that's what makes me the most interested in Alex is the Nietzsche quote about the gazing

2:29:03.500 --> 2:29:04.860
 into the abyss.

2:29:04.860 --> 2:29:08.940
 I think he said on your show that he has become the abyss or something like that.

2:29:08.940 --> 2:29:14.820
 I think that makes him fascinating that when you really take conspiracy theory seriously,

2:29:14.820 --> 2:29:17.820
 the kind of effect it has on your mind.

2:29:17.820 --> 2:29:18.820
 That to me is fascinating.

2:29:18.820 --> 2:29:22.100
 Well, can I say one thing that term conspiracy theory?

2:29:22.100 --> 2:29:26.460
 If you ask any layman, like it's like this, you say, do you like puppies?

2:29:26.460 --> 2:29:27.460
 I hate them.

2:29:27.460 --> 2:29:28.460
 Do you like baby dogs?

2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:29.460
 Oh, they're the best, right?

2:29:29.460 --> 2:29:31.900
 People, the human mind is capable of doing this.

2:29:31.900 --> 2:29:38.580
 So if you ask people, do you think extremely powerful people often get together and manipulate

2:29:38.580 --> 2:29:43.180
 data or rules in order to further power and control and maintain it?

2:29:43.180 --> 2:29:46.380
 I think 90 plus percent of people will be like, of course.

2:29:46.380 --> 2:29:48.100
 Then you say, oh, so you believe in conspiracy theories?

2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:49.780
 Oh, no, that's for crazy people.

2:29:49.780 --> 2:29:51.460
 Those concepts are identical.

2:29:51.460 --> 2:29:57.540
 Now that term is used for people who are like, all right, you know, there's conspiracies

2:29:57.540 --> 2:30:00.020
 in government to experiment on people like Tuskegee.

2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:01.020
 This is not in dispute.

2:30:01.020 --> 2:30:05.500
 The CIA has, you know, unsealed things, operation mockingbird, so on and so forth.

2:30:05.500 --> 2:30:09.700
 And at the same time, conspiracy theory applies to people who say 9 11 never happened and

2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:10.700
 those are holograms.

2:30:10.700 --> 2:30:16.220
 Now, it's the same word for both, but these are not at all equal truth claims and they

2:30:16.220 --> 2:30:20.580
 do not at all have equal evidence to them, but it's very useful for powerful people to

2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:24.420
 have that term in the zeitgeist because then I don't have to explain or defend.

2:30:24.420 --> 2:30:27.580
 It's like only lunatics are going to look further on this.

2:30:27.580 --> 2:30:29.420
 Do you really want to be a lunatic kid?

2:30:29.420 --> 2:30:31.260
 And that takes care of the issue.

2:30:31.260 --> 2:30:35.780
 Unfortunately, the same problem applies with language applies to a lot of other areas.

2:30:35.780 --> 2:30:36.780
 A hundred percent.

2:30:36.780 --> 2:30:37.780
 That's an age of language.

2:30:37.780 --> 2:30:38.780
 Yeah.

2:30:38.780 --> 2:30:39.780
 It's used not just to communicate, but to obfuscate.

2:30:39.780 --> 2:30:45.900
 Obviously, that could be fixed by coming up with different words to label conspiracy

2:30:45.900 --> 2:30:48.580
 theories that are much more likely to be true.

2:30:48.580 --> 2:30:49.580
 Yeah.

2:30:49.580 --> 2:30:53.740
 Power elite analysis is another is basically conspiracy theory.

2:30:53.740 --> 2:30:59.220
 This is the black pill versus white pill question with the abyss.

2:30:59.220 --> 2:31:06.780
 Do you think thinking about these things can destroy the mind, can make you deeply cynical

2:31:06.780 --> 2:31:08.140
 about the world?

2:31:08.140 --> 2:31:09.380
 Yeah.

2:31:09.380 --> 2:31:15.980
 Because if you are thinking that you are not aware of or no one is aware of who's controlling

2:31:15.980 --> 2:31:20.700
 things and that the level of their control, it gives you the sense of powerlessness and

2:31:20.700 --> 2:31:22.180
 hopelessness.

2:31:22.180 --> 2:31:27.540
 And my counter is the people in charge, one of the reasons I'm an anarchist, are nowhere

2:31:27.540 --> 2:31:30.420
 near as smart and crafty as you think they are.

2:31:30.420 --> 2:31:34.340
 And certainly maybe the ones to complete the shadow maybe are, but the ones who are in

2:31:34.340 --> 2:31:38.060
 the public face most certainly are not as social media has demonstrated.

2:31:38.060 --> 2:31:44.940
 When you look at how senators and Harvard professors tweet, these are not intellects

2:31:44.940 --> 2:31:47.340
 that you're in awe of to put it mildly.

2:31:47.340 --> 2:31:52.700
 So I think that takes the bloom off the rose to a great extent.

2:31:52.700 --> 2:31:57.500
 You mentioned that you've been doing a lot of amazing things, been truly joyful recently.

2:31:57.500 --> 2:32:02.380
 But I don't know if you have a bucket list.

2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:05.740
 Is there items on the bucket list you haven't done yet?

2:32:05.740 --> 2:32:08.740
 Are you pretty much satisfied and happy?

2:32:08.740 --> 2:32:12.260
 And if you die today, if I murder you, you'd be happy.

2:32:12.260 --> 2:32:13.380
 I could die today.

2:32:13.380 --> 2:32:17.820
 Is there an item on the bucket list you want to get done?

2:32:17.820 --> 2:32:22.620
 I don't, yeah, deep sea submersible.

2:32:22.620 --> 2:32:24.940
 That would be number one on a bucket list.

2:32:24.940 --> 2:32:25.940
 Why?

2:32:25.940 --> 2:32:28.620
 That's where all the most interesting zoology is.

2:32:28.620 --> 2:32:36.580
 And to be in a place where virtually no human being has been and to see these God's mistakes

2:32:36.580 --> 2:32:38.740
 in their natural environment.

2:32:38.740 --> 2:32:40.580
 My friend coined that term God's mistakes.

2:32:40.580 --> 2:32:44.460
 If you look at deep sea creatures, you can imagine God making some animal being like,

2:32:44.460 --> 2:32:45.460
 oh, God, this is hideous.

2:32:45.460 --> 2:32:46.460
 I'll just throw the bomb in the ocean.

2:32:46.460 --> 2:32:48.220
 I was going to see this.

2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:51.020
 So that would be my number one bucket list thing.

2:32:51.020 --> 2:32:56.260
 I would say go to the White House as a guest would be a bucket list thing, Russia, go to

2:32:56.260 --> 2:32:59.620
 Russia would be a bucket list thing.

2:32:59.620 --> 2:33:00.620
 I want to go.

2:33:00.620 --> 2:33:03.980
 These are secondary, like go to Eritrea would be a bucket list thing.

2:33:03.980 --> 2:33:07.820
 I've got a long list of books I need to write that's that's I don't know that's really a

2:33:07.820 --> 2:33:12.660
 bucket list per se.

2:33:12.660 --> 2:33:13.660
 There's not that much.

2:33:13.660 --> 2:33:19.460
 What I'm at a point in my life is once you cross up certain things, you basically instead

2:33:19.460 --> 2:33:22.740
 of driving the car starts surfing and just amazing thing.

2:33:22.740 --> 2:33:27.100
 I talked to you about this medical thing before we started at a certain point and I'm sure

2:33:27.100 --> 2:33:30.380
 this happens to you because your platform is a lot bigger than mine.

2:33:30.380 --> 2:33:33.300
 All sorts of things start coming your way that you never would have thought of and you're

2:33:33.300 --> 2:33:35.420
 like, this is pretty darn cool.

2:33:35.420 --> 2:33:40.500
 So to be and that's happening at an escalating rate, like I'm at a point now where I get

2:33:40.500 --> 2:33:43.100
 stopped every day by people.

2:33:43.100 --> 2:33:49.180
 So that's going to be a weird thing for me to get adjusted to.

2:33:49.180 --> 2:33:53.420
 That exception, everyone who has ever stopped me on the street has been cool and it's been

2:33:53.420 --> 2:33:54.820
 a pleasant experience.

2:33:54.820 --> 2:33:58.900
 There was one exception and an event where someone was genuinely on the spectrum and

2:33:58.900 --> 2:34:04.180
 they didn't understand distance and you don't touch people and that's as bad as it got.

2:34:04.180 --> 2:34:09.380
 So that is something that's going to be weird for me to have to deal with over the next

2:34:09.380 --> 2:34:14.020
 couple of years, but it's the price you pay and it's hardly a small price when people

2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:16.300
 come up to you and say you've made my life better.

2:34:16.300 --> 2:34:20.580
 But it's just weird when you go and like I was at the gym and then someone tweets, like

2:34:20.580 --> 2:34:22.620
 did I see you at the gym just now?

2:34:22.620 --> 2:34:27.100
 It's kind of weird and I'm sure it's the same for you when you're walking around and you

2:34:27.100 --> 2:34:29.860
 don't think about it, but people know who you are and you don't know who they are that

2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:30.860
 you're being watched.

2:34:30.860 --> 2:34:34.820
 Even though it's not malevolent, it's still just, you don't get prepared for that.

2:34:34.820 --> 2:34:42.540
 Michael, there will be two really big names that wanting to do this podcast will do this

2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:48.700
 podcast that I consider to do episode 200 with, but then I realized why the hell talk

2:34:48.700 --> 2:34:57.100
 to somebody famous when I could talk to somebody I love that nobody knows or cares for.

2:34:57.100 --> 2:35:00.900
 You just hit a random number generator.

2:35:00.900 --> 2:35:01.900
 Yeah.

2:35:01.900 --> 2:35:04.700
 Just I'd listed all the Russians I know and who's the easiest to get.

2:35:04.700 --> 2:35:08.620
 Yeah, who's the most desperate for every song?

2:35:08.620 --> 2:35:09.620
 He's got a shitty book out.

2:35:09.620 --> 2:35:15.340
 We can talk about that for five minutes, this garbage cut and paste that he did.

2:35:15.340 --> 2:35:16.340
 Yeah.

2:35:16.340 --> 2:35:20.620
 It turned out okay, I think, slightly above average.

2:35:20.620 --> 2:35:22.540
 Michael, I love you.

2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:24.020
 You're an incredible human being.

2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:26.780
 It's an honor that you would talk to me and you'll be my friend.

2:35:26.780 --> 2:35:27.980
 Thanks so much for doing this.

2:35:27.980 --> 2:35:34.740
 The respect that I got when you asked me to be the guest for the anniversary episode was

2:35:34.740 --> 2:35:37.740
 similar to the respect with my two friends, Josh and Zoe.

2:35:37.740 --> 2:35:40.460
 They were going to get married at City Hall and they said, we want someone to witness

2:35:40.460 --> 2:35:41.980
 that they ask you.

2:35:41.980 --> 2:35:46.900
 It's one thing when people tell you they like you and respect you, which I had growing up.

2:35:46.900 --> 2:35:48.660
 It's another thing when they show it.

2:35:48.660 --> 2:35:52.060
 This is something that I do not take lightly and I hope no one takes lightly.

2:35:52.060 --> 2:35:57.380
 If someone does right by you and shows you respect, going back to taking out for dinner,

2:35:57.380 --> 2:35:58.380
 thank them.

2:35:58.380 --> 2:35:59.380
 Buy them a candy bar.

2:35:59.380 --> 2:36:00.460
 Buy them a soda.

2:36:00.460 --> 2:36:04.980
 Do something to show that you don't take it for granted because I think what you and

2:36:04.980 --> 2:36:11.340
 I both want to do is increase human kindness as much as possible and I'm going to look

2:36:11.340 --> 2:36:12.940
 at the camera.

2:36:12.940 --> 2:36:16.940
 Be kind to yourself because a lot of you deserve it.

2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:42.420
 Good bye.

2:36:42.420 --> 2:36:47.900
 The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad

2:36:47.900 --> 2:36:53.180
 to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say

2:36:53.180 --> 2:37:00.400
 commonplace thing but burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders

2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:05.940
 across the stars and in the middle you see the blue center light pop and everybody goes

2:37:05.940 --> 2:37:11.940
 thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
