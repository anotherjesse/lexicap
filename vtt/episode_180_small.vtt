 The following is a conversation with Jeremy Surrey, a historian at UT Austin, whose research

00:05.960 --> 00:11.880
 interests and writing are on modern American history with an eye towards presidents and

00:11.880 --> 00:15.320
 in general individuals who wielded power.

00:15.320 --> 00:23.000
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Element, MonkPak, Velcampo, FourSigmatic, and AteSleep.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.760
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:26.760 --> 00:33.280
 As a side note, let me say that in these conversations, for better or worse, I seek understanding,

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
 not activism.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.680
 I'm not left nor right.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.520
 I love ideas, not labels.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.080
 And most fascinating ideas are full of uncertainty, tension, and tradeoffs.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.480
 Labels destroy that.

00:45.480 --> 00:51.160
 I try ideas out, let them breathe for a time, try to challenge, explore, and analyze.

00:51.160 --> 00:56.080
 But mostly, I trust the intelligence of you, the listener, to think and to make up your

00:56.080 --> 00:58.640
 own mind, together with me.

00:58.640 --> 01:04.720
 I will try to have economists and philosophers on from all points on the multidimensional

01:04.720 --> 01:07.960
 political spectrum, including the extremes.

01:07.960 --> 01:12.520
 I will try to both have an open mind and to ask difficult questions when needed.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.360
 I'll make mistakes.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.840
 Don't shoot this robot at the first sign of failure.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.680
 I'm still under development.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.480
 Pre release version 0.1.

01:21.480 --> 01:27.600
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Jeremy Surrey.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.120
 You studied many American presidents throughout history.

01:31.120 --> 01:36.000
 So who do you think was the greatest president in American history?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.200
 The greatest American president was Abraham Lincoln.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.200
 And Tolstoy reflected on this himself, actually, saying that when he was in the Caucasus, he

01:45.200 --> 01:50.680
 asked these peasants in the Caucasus, who was the greatest man in the world that they

01:50.680 --> 01:51.680
 had heard of.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.320
 And they said, Abraham Lincoln.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
 And why?

01:54.320 --> 01:58.960
 Well, because he gave voice to people who had no voice before.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.760
 He turned politics into an art.

02:00.760 --> 02:05.120
 This is what Tolstoy recounted, the peasants in the Caucasus telling him.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.400
 Lincoln made politics more than about power.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.520
 He made it an art.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.920
 He made it a source of liberation.

02:10.920 --> 02:16.520
 And those living even far from the United States could see that model, that inspiration

02:16.520 --> 02:18.000
 from Lincoln.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.800
 He was a man who had two years of education, yet he mastered the English language.

02:22.800 --> 02:28.040
 And he used the language to help people imagine a different kind of world.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.560
 You see, leaders and presidents are at their best when they're doing more than just manipulating

02:32.560 --> 02:36.800
 institutions and power when they're helping the people imagine a better world.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.520
 And he did that as no other president has.

02:40.520 --> 02:44.160
 And you say he gave voice to those who are voiceless.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.440
 Who are you talking to about in general?

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
 Is this about African Americans?

02:47.440 --> 02:51.200
 Or is this about just the populace in general?

02:51.200 --> 02:56.800
 Certainly part of it is about slaves, African Americans, and many immigrants, immigrants

02:56.800 --> 03:00.960
 from all parts of Europe and other areas that have come to the United States.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.320
 But part of it was just for ordinary American citizens.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.680
 The Republican Party, for which Lincoln was the first president, was a party created to

03:07.680 --> 03:13.920
 give voice to poor white men, as well as slaves and others.

03:13.920 --> 03:17.960
 Lincoln was a poor white man himself, grew up without slaves and without land, which

03:17.960 --> 03:19.280
 meant you had almost nothing.

03:19.280 --> 03:25.000
 What do you think about the trajectory of that man with only two years of education?

03:25.000 --> 03:33.480
 Is there something to be said about how does one come from nothing and nurture the ideals

03:33.480 --> 03:38.680
 that kind of make this country great into something where you can actually be a leader

03:38.680 --> 03:43.440
 of this nation to espouse those ideas, to give the voice to the voiceless?

03:43.440 --> 03:46.320
 Yes, I think you actually hit the nail on the head.

03:46.320 --> 03:52.720
 I think what he represented was the opportunity, and that was the word that mattered for him,

03:52.720 --> 03:58.320
 opportunity that came from the ability to raise yourself up, to work hard, and to be

03:58.320 --> 04:00.520
 compensated for your hard work.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.760
 This is at the core of the Republican Party of the 19th century, which is the core of

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
 capitalism.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.360
 It's not about getting rich.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.520
 It's about getting compensated for your work.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.920
 It's about being incentivized to do better work.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.600
 And Lincoln was constantly striving.

04:13.600 --> 04:19.240
 One of his closest associates, Herndon, said he was the little engine of ambition that

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
 couldn't stop.

04:20.240 --> 04:24.320
 He just kept going, taught himself to read, taught himself to be a lawyer.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.400
 He went through many failed businesses before he even reached that point.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.600
 Many failed love affairs, but he kept trying.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.680
 He kept working, and what American society offered him and what he wanted American society

04:34.680 --> 04:39.720
 to offer everyone else was the opportunity to keep trying to fail and then get up and

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
 try again.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.760
 What do you think was the nature of that ambition?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.200
 Was there a hunger for power?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.680
 I think Lincoln had a hunger for success.

04:46.680 --> 04:52.480
 I think he had a hunger to get out of the poor station he was in.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.360
 He had a hunger to be someone who had control over his life.

04:56.360 --> 05:01.240
 Freedom for him did not mean the right to do anything you want to do, but it meant the

05:01.240 --> 05:06.800
 right to be secure from being dependent upon someone else, so independence.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.720
 He writes in his letters when he's very young that he hated being dependent on his father.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.560
 He grew up without a mother.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.080
 His father was a struggling farmer, and he would write in his letters that his father

05:17.080 --> 05:19.440
 treated him like a slave on the farm.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.680
 Some think his hatred of slavery came from that experience.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.280
 He didn't ever want to have to work for someone again.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.400
 He wanted to be free and independent, and he wanted, again, every American, this is

05:28.400 --> 05:34.360
 the kind of Jeffersonian dream, to be the owner of themself and the owner of their future.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.160
 That's a really nice definition of freedom.

05:36.160 --> 05:42.320
 We often think this very abstract notion of being able to do anything you want, but really,

05:42.320 --> 05:48.800
 it's ultimately breaking yourself free from the constraints, like the very tight dependence

05:48.800 --> 05:56.480
 on whether it's the institutions or on your family or the expectations or the community

05:56.480 --> 06:03.800
 or whatever, being able to realize yourself within the constraints of your own abilities.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.720
 It's still not true freedom.

06:05.720 --> 06:10.920
 True freedom is probably almost like designing a video game character, something like that.

06:10.920 --> 06:11.920
 I agree.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.880
 I think that's exactly right.

06:13.880 --> 06:19.080
 I think freedom is not that I can have any outcome I want.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.280
 I can't control outcomes.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.000
 The most powerful, freest person in the world cannot control outcomes, but it means that

06:24.000 --> 06:25.560
 at least I get to make choices.

06:25.560 --> 06:29.120
 Someone else doesn't make those choices for me.

06:29.120 --> 06:36.160
 Is there something to be said about Lincoln and the political game front of it, which

06:36.160 --> 06:38.400
 is he's accomplished some of them?

06:38.400 --> 06:42.720
 I don't know, but it seems like there were some tricky politics going on.

06:42.720 --> 06:48.640
 We tend to not think of it in those terms because of the dark aspects of slavery.

06:48.640 --> 06:55.680
 We tend to think about it in ethical and human terms, but in their time, it was probably

06:55.680 --> 07:02.200
 as much a game of politics, not just these broad questions of human nature.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
 It was a game.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.000
 Is there something to be said about being a skillful player in the game of politics

07:07.000 --> 07:08.680
 that you take from Lincoln?

07:08.680 --> 07:10.680
 Absolutely.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.760
 Lincoln never read Carl von Klauswitz, the great 19th century German thinker on strategy

07:14.760 --> 07:18.440
 and politics, but he embodied the same wisdom, which is that everything is politics.

07:18.440 --> 07:24.560
 If you want to get anything done, and this includes even relationships, there's a politics

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
 to it.

07:25.560 --> 07:30.920
 It means that you have to persuade, coerce, encourage people to do things they wouldn't

07:30.920 --> 07:33.360
 otherwise do.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.720
 Lincoln was a master at that.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.120
 He was a master at that for two reasons.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.440
 He had learned through his hard life to read people, to anticipate them, to spend a lot

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
 of time listening.

07:41.440 --> 07:47.720
 One thing I often tell people is the best leaders are the listeners, not the talkers.

07:47.720 --> 07:52.480
 Then second, Lincoln was very thoughtful and planned every move out.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.840
 He was thinking three or four moves, maybe five moves down the chessboard, while others

07:56.840 --> 07:59.320
 were move number one or two.

07:59.320 --> 08:05.200
 That's fascinating to think about him just listening to studying.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.400
 They look at great fighters in this way, like the first few rounds of boxing and mixed martial

08:09.400 --> 08:17.080
 arts, you're studying the movement of your opponent in order to define the holes.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.880
 That's a really interesting frame to think about it.

08:18.880 --> 08:28.360
 Is there, in terms of relationships, where do you think as president or as a politician

08:28.360 --> 08:30.040
 is the most impact to be had?

08:30.040 --> 08:33.640
 I've been reading a lot about Hitler recently.

08:33.640 --> 08:40.040
 One of the things that I'm more and more starting to wonder, what the hell did he do alone in

08:40.040 --> 08:47.280
 a room one on one with people because it seems like that's where he was exceptionally effective.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.280
 When I think about certain leaders, I'm not sure Stalin was this way.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.280
 I apologize.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.840
 I've been very obsessed with these with this period of human history.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.920
 It just seems like certain leaders are extremely effective one on one.

09:01.920 --> 09:08.840
 A lot of people think of Hitler in Lincoln as a speechmaker, as a great charismatic speechmaker,

09:08.840 --> 09:15.200
 but it seems like to me that some of these guys were really effective inside a room.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
 What do you think?

09:16.200 --> 09:24.640
 I think it's more important your effectiveness to make a hell of a good speech, be in a room

09:24.640 --> 09:29.440
 with many people, or is it all boiled down to one on one?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.320
 Well I think in a sense it's both.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.680
 One needs to do both, and most politicians, most leaders are better at one or the other.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.840
 It's the rare leader who can do both.

09:37.840 --> 09:44.760
 I will say that if you are going to be a figure who's a president or the leader of a complex

09:44.760 --> 09:48.440
 organization, not a startup, but a complex organization where you have many different

09:48.440 --> 09:53.760
 constituencies and many different interests, you have to do the one on one really well.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.920
 Because a lot of what's going to happen is you're going to be meeting with people who

09:56.920 --> 10:01.840
 represent different groups, the leader of the labor unions, the leader of your investing

10:01.840 --> 10:05.480
 board, et cetera, and you have to be able to persuade them.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.120
 It's the intangibles that often matter most.

10:08.120 --> 10:13.160
 Lincoln's skill, and it's the same that FDR had, is the ability to tell a story.

10:13.160 --> 10:17.640
 I think Hitler was a little different, but what I've read of Stalin is he was a storyteller

10:17.640 --> 10:18.640
 too.

10:18.640 --> 10:19.640
 One on one storyteller?

10:19.640 --> 10:23.640
 Yeah, that's my understanding is that he, and what Lincoln did, I don't want to compare

10:23.640 --> 10:30.880
 Lincoln to Stalin, what Lincoln did is he was not confrontational.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.920
 He was happy to have an argument if an argument were to be had, but actually what he would

10:34.920 --> 10:40.480
 try to do is move you through telling a story that got you to think about your position

10:40.480 --> 10:43.520
 in a different way to basically disarm you.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.840
 Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing, Ronald Reagan did the same thing.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.600
 Storytelling is a very important skill.

10:49.600 --> 10:55.040
 It's almost heartbreaking that we don't get to have, or maybe you can correct me if I'm

10:55.040 --> 10:58.800
 wrong on this, but it feels like we don't have a lot of information how all of these

10:58.800 --> 11:03.200
 folks were in private one on one conversations.

11:03.200 --> 11:12.680
 Even if we get stories about it, it's like, again, sorry to bring up Hitler, but people

11:12.680 --> 11:16.760
 have talked about his peers and gays when they're one on one.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.400
 There's a feeling like he's just looking through you.

11:19.400 --> 11:26.520
 I wonder, it makes me wonder, was Lincoln somebody who's a little bit more passive, who's more,

11:26.520 --> 11:32.520
 the ego doesn't shine, it's not like an overwhelming thing, or is it more like, again, don't want

11:32.520 --> 11:37.760
 to bring up controversial figures, but Donald Trump, it's more menacing.

11:37.760 --> 11:44.080
 There's a more physically menacing thing where it's almost like a bullying kind of dynamic.

11:44.080 --> 11:51.920
 I wonder, I wish we knew, because from a psychological perspective, I wonder if there's a thread

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
 that connects most great leaders.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.200
 That's a great question.

11:55.200 --> 12:00.760
 I think the best writer on this is Max Weber, and he talks about the power of charisma,

12:00.760 --> 12:06.120
 the term charisma comes from Weber, and Weber's use of it, actually, to talk about profits,

12:06.120 --> 12:08.240
 and I think he has a point.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.800
 Leaders who are effective in the way you describe are leaders who feel prophetic, or Weber says

12:13.800 --> 12:17.920
 they have a kind of magic about them, and I think that can come from different sources.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.560
 I think that can come from the way someone carries themselves.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.360
 It can come from the way they use words.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.840
 Maybe there are different kinds of magic that someone develops, but I think there are two

12:28.840 --> 12:31.640
 things that seem to be absolutely necessary.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.160
 First is you have to be someone who sizes up the person on the other side of the table.

12:35.160 --> 12:39.000
 You cannot be the person who just comes in and reads your brief.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.520
 Then second, I think it's interactive, and there is a quickness of thought.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.800
 You brought up Donald Trump.

12:45.800 --> 12:51.080
 I don't think Donald Trump is a deep thinker at all, but he's quick, and I think that quickness

12:51.080 --> 12:55.200
 is part of it's different from delivering a lecture where it's the depth of your thought.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.960
 Can you for 45 minutes analyze something?

12:57.960 --> 13:01.880
 Many people can't do that, but they still might be very effective if they're able to

13:01.880 --> 13:06.840
 quickly react, size up the person on the other side of the table, and react in a way that

13:06.840 --> 13:09.920
 moves that person in the way they want to move them.

13:09.920 --> 13:16.240
 Yeah, and there's also just a couple do the quickness as a kind of instinct about human

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
 nature.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
 Yes.

13:18.240 --> 13:23.080
 Sort of asking the question, what does this person worry about?

13:23.080 --> 13:24.360
 What are the biggest problems?

13:24.360 --> 13:30.320
 Actually, what is this Stephen Schwartz man I think said to me, this businessman, I think

13:30.320 --> 13:37.320
 he said, what I've always tried to do is try to figure out, ask enough questions to figure

13:37.320 --> 13:41.080
 out what is the biggest problem in this person's life.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.120
 Try to get a sense of what is the biggest problem in their life, because that's actually

13:44.120 --> 13:49.440
 what they care about most, and most people don't care enough to find out.

13:49.440 --> 13:58.200
 He kind of wants to sneak up on that and find that, and then use that to then build closeness

13:58.200 --> 14:02.000
 in order to then probably he doesn't put it in those words, but to manipulate the person

14:02.000 --> 14:04.600
 into whatever, to do whatever the heck they want.

14:04.600 --> 14:12.200
 I think part of it is that, and part of the effect that Donald Trump has is how quick

14:12.200 --> 14:14.560
 he's able to figure that out.

14:14.560 --> 14:21.960
 We've written a book about how the role and power of the presidency has changed.

14:21.960 --> 14:28.600
 How has it changed since Lincoln's time, the evolution of the presidency as a concept,

14:28.600 --> 14:35.520
 which seems like a fascinating lens through which to look at American history.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.640
 We seem to only be talking about the presidents, maybe a general here and there, but it's mostly

14:40.640 --> 14:45.320
 the story of America is often told through presidents.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.200
 That's right.

14:47.200 --> 14:52.160
 One of the points I've tried to make in my writing about this and various other activities

14:52.160 --> 14:58.720
 is we use this word president as if it's something timeless, but the office has changed incredibly.

14:58.720 --> 15:04.960
 Just from Lincoln's time to the present, which is 150 years, he wouldn't recognize the office

15:04.960 --> 15:08.720
 today, and George Washington would not have recognized it in Lincoln.

15:08.720 --> 15:16.160
 Just as I think a CEO today would be unrecognizable to a Rockefeller or a Carnegie of 150 years

15:16.160 --> 15:17.160
 ago.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.960
 What are some of the ways in which the office has changed?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.720
 I'll just point to three there a lot.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.880
 One, presidents now can communicate with the public directly.

15:25.880 --> 15:30.360
 We've reached the point now where a president can have direct almost one on one communication.

15:30.360 --> 15:35.520
 President can use Twitter if he so chooses to circumvent all media.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.160
 That was unthinkable. Lincoln, in order to get his message across, often wrote letters

15:39.160 --> 15:43.440
 to newspapers and waited for the newspaper for Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune

15:43.440 --> 15:44.960
 to publish his letter.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.240
 That's how he communicated with the public.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.520
 There weren't even many speaking opportunities.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.960
 That's a big change.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.480
 We feel the president in our life much more.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.360
 That's why we talk about him much more.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
 That also creates more of a burden.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.680
 This is the second point.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.840
 Presidents are under a microscope.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.840
 Presidents are under a microscope.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.440
 You have to be very careful what you do and what you say, and you're judged by a lot of

16:04.440 --> 16:07.840
 the elements of your behavior that are not policy relevant.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.920
 In fact, the things we judge most and make most of our decisions on about individuals

16:11.920 --> 16:13.480
 are often that.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.040
 Then third, the power the president has.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
 It's inhuman, actually.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.600
 This is one of my critiques of how the office has changed.

16:21.600 --> 16:29.400
 This one person has power on a scale that's, I think, dangerous in a democracy.

16:29.400 --> 16:34.840
 Having the founders 220 years ago would have had trouble conceiving.

16:34.840 --> 16:39.040
 Presidents now have the ability to deliver force across the world to literally assassinate

16:39.040 --> 16:42.240
 people with a remarkable accuracy.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.960
 That's an enormous power that presidents have.

16:44.960 --> 16:52.880
 Your sense, this is not to get conspiratorial, but do you think a president currently has

16:52.880 --> 17:03.120
 the power to initiate the assassination of somebody, of a political enemy or a terrorist

17:03.120 --> 17:09.040
 leader or that kind of thing, to frame that person in a way where assassination is something

17:09.040 --> 17:12.320
 that he alone or she alone could decide to do?

17:12.320 --> 17:14.760
 I think it happens all the time, and it's not to be conspiratorial.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.960
 This is how we fought terrorism by targeting individuals.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.480
 Now, you might say these were not elected leaders of state, but these were individuals

17:22.480 --> 17:23.480
 with a large following.

17:23.480 --> 17:30.280
 I mean, the killing of Osama bin Laden was an assassination operation, and we've taken

17:30.280 --> 17:35.840
 out very successfully many leaders of terrorist organizations, and we do it every day.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.520
 You're saying that back in Lincoln's time or George Washington's time, there was more

17:39.520 --> 17:43.880
 of a balance of power, like a president could not initiate this kind of assassination?

17:43.880 --> 17:44.880
 Correct.

17:44.880 --> 17:49.320
 I think presidents did not have the same kind of military or economic power.

17:49.320 --> 17:55.960
 We could talk about how a president can influence a market by saying something about where money

17:55.960 --> 18:01.240
 is going to go or singling out a company or critiquing a company in one way or another.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.360
 They didn't have that kind of power.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.560
 Now, much of the power that a Lincoln or a Washington had was the power to mobilize

18:07.560 --> 18:09.760
 people to then make their own decisions.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.640
 At the start of the Civil War, Lincoln doesn't even have the power to bring people into the

18:13.640 --> 18:14.640
 army.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.960
 He has to go to the governors and ask the governors to provide soldiers, so the governor of

18:18.960 --> 18:25.400
 Wisconsin, the governor of Massachusetts, could you imagine that today?

18:25.400 --> 18:33.160
 But yes, they used speeches and words to mobilize versus direct action in closed door environments,

18:33.160 --> 18:35.480
 initiating wars, for example.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.480
 Correct.

18:36.480 --> 18:43.840
 It's difficult to think about, if we look at Barack Obama, for example, if you're listening

18:43.840 --> 18:49.200
 to this and you're on the left or the right, please do not make this political.

18:49.200 --> 18:53.440
 In fact, if you're a political person and you're getting angry at the mention of the

18:53.440 --> 18:58.000
 word Obama or Donald Trump, please turn off this podcast and I'm subscribed.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.480
 We're not going to get very far.

18:59.480 --> 19:06.480
 I hope we maintain a political discussion about even the modern presidents that viewed

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
 through the lens of history.

19:07.480 --> 19:13.240
 I think there's a lot to be learned about the office and about human nature.

19:13.240 --> 19:20.080
 Some people criticize Barack Obama for expanding the military industrial complex, engaging

19:20.080 --> 19:28.680
 in more and more wars, as opposed to the initial rhetoric, was such that we would pull back

19:28.680 --> 19:33.800
 from being more skeptical in our decisions to wage wars.

19:33.800 --> 19:40.240
 From the lens of the power of the presidency, as the modern presidency, the fact that we

19:40.240 --> 19:46.840
 continue the war in Afghanistan at different engagements in military conflicts.

19:46.840 --> 19:52.440
 Do you think Barack Obama could have stopped that?

19:52.440 --> 19:58.280
 Do you put the responsibility on that expansion on him because of the implied power that the

19:58.280 --> 19:59.840
 presidency has?

19:59.840 --> 20:04.720
 Or is this power just sits there and if a president chooses to take it, they do.

20:04.720 --> 20:10.000
 And if they don't, they don't, almost like you don't want to take on the responsibility

20:10.000 --> 20:13.120
 because of the burden of that responsibility.

20:13.120 --> 20:18.080
 So a lot of my research is about this exact question, not just with Obama.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.880
 And my conclusion, and I think the research is pretty clear on this, is that structure

20:21.880 --> 20:26.800
 has a lot more effect on us than we like to admit, which is to say that the circumstances,

20:26.800 --> 20:30.680
 the institutions around us drive our behavior more than we like to think.

20:30.680 --> 20:35.180
 So Barack Obama, I'm quite certain, came into the office of the presidency committed to

20:35.180 --> 20:39.560
 actually reducing the use of military force overseas and reducing presidential war making

20:39.560 --> 20:40.920
 power.

20:40.920 --> 20:45.720
 As a trained lawyer, he had a moral position on this, actually, and he tried.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.320
 And he did withdraw American forces from Iraq and was, of course, criticized by many people

20:49.320 --> 20:50.760
 for doing that.

20:50.760 --> 20:54.440
 But at the same time, he had some real problems in the world to deal with, terrorism being

20:54.440 --> 20:55.920
 one of them.

20:55.920 --> 21:01.120
 And the tools he has are very much biased towards the use of military force.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.240
 It's much harder, as president, to go and get Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to agree

21:05.240 --> 21:06.240
 with you.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.280
 It's much easier to send these wonderful toys we have and these incredible soldiers we

21:11.280 --> 21:12.960
 have over there.

21:12.960 --> 21:17.120
 And when you have Congress, which is always against you, it's also easier to use the

21:17.120 --> 21:20.560
 military because you send them there, and even if members of Congress from your own

21:20.560 --> 21:24.280
 party or the other are angry at you, they'll still fund the soldiers.

21:24.280 --> 21:28.040
 No member of Congress wants to vote to starve our soldiers overseas.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
 So they'll stop your budget.

21:29.040 --> 21:33.160
 They'll even threaten not to pay the debt, but they'll still fund your soldiers.

21:33.160 --> 21:38.680
 And so you are pushed by the circumstances you're in to do this, and it's very hard

21:38.680 --> 21:40.000
 to resist.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
 So I think the criticism of Obama, the fair one, would be that he didn't resist the pressures

21:45.000 --> 21:47.880
 that were there, but he did not make those pressures.

21:47.880 --> 21:55.760
 So is there something about putting the responsibility and the president to form the structure around

21:55.760 --> 22:01.640
 him locally such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric?

22:01.640 --> 22:05.760
 So what I'm talking to is hiring.

22:05.760 --> 22:11.600
 So basically just everybody you work with, you have power as a president to fire and

22:11.600 --> 22:20.040
 hire or to basically schedule meetings in such a way that can control your decision making.

22:20.040 --> 22:27.880
 So I imagine it's very difficult to get out of Afghanistan or Iraq when most of your scheduled

22:27.880 --> 22:31.280
 meetings are with generals or something like that.

22:31.280 --> 22:36.680
 But if you reorganize the schedule and you reorganize who you have late night talks

22:36.680 --> 22:41.760
 with, you potentially have a huge ripple effect on the policy.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.760
 I think that's right.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.000
 I think who has access to the president is absolutely crucial.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.080
 And presidents have to be more strategic about that.

22:48.080 --> 22:52.260
 They tend to be reacting to crises because every day has a crisis.

22:52.260 --> 22:55.000
 And if you're reacting to a crisis, you're not controlling access because the crisis

22:55.000 --> 22:56.400
 is driving you.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.720
 So that's one element of it.

22:57.720 --> 23:01.960
 But I also think, and this is the moment we're in right now, presidents have to invest in

23:01.960 --> 23:06.020
 reforming the system, the system of decision making.

23:06.020 --> 23:09.480
 Should we have a national security council that looks the way it does?

23:09.480 --> 23:11.840
 Should our military be structured the way it is?

23:11.840 --> 23:14.680
 The founding fathers wanted a military that was divided.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.080
 They did not want to unify the Department of Defense.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.320
 That was only created after World War II.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.920
 Should we have as large a military as we have?

23:20.920 --> 23:23.160
 Should we be in as many places?

23:23.160 --> 23:26.960
 There are some fundamental structural reforms we have to undertake.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.680
 And part of that is who you appoint, but part of that is also how you change the institutions.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.320
 The genius of the American system is that it's a dynamic system.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.560
 It can be adjusted.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.400
 It has been adjusted over time.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.440
 That's the heroic story.

23:40.440 --> 23:44.880
 The frustrating story is it often takes us a long time to make those adjustments until

23:44.880 --> 23:48.960
 we go into such bad circumstances that we have no choice.

23:48.960 --> 23:56.680
 So in the battle of power of the office of the president versus the United States military,

23:56.680 --> 24:01.920
 the Department of Defense, do you have a sense that the president has more power ultimately

24:01.920 --> 24:09.800
 so to decrease the size of the Department of Defense to withdraw from any wars or increase

24:09.800 --> 24:13.080
 the amount of wars is the president?

24:13.080 --> 24:16.640
 You're kind of implying the president has a lot of power here in this scale.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.640
 Yes.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.720
 The president has a lot of power and we are fortunate and it was just proven in the last

24:20.720 --> 24:26.640
 few years that our military uniquely among many countries with large militaries is very

24:26.640 --> 24:31.560
 deferential to the president and very restricted in its ability to challenge the president.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.920
 So that's a strength of our system.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.720
 But the way you reform the military is not with individual decisions.

24:37.720 --> 24:43.160
 It's by having a strategic plan that reexamines what role it plays.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.680
 So it's not just about whether we're in Afghanistan or not.

24:45.680 --> 24:50.360
 The question we have to ask is when we look at our toolbox of what we can do in our foreign

24:50.360 --> 24:56.840
 policy, are there other tools we should build up and therefore some tools from the military

24:56.840 --> 24:58.200
 we should reduce?

24:58.200 --> 25:00.400
 That's the broader strategic question.

25:00.400 --> 25:06.000
 Let me ask you the most absurd question of all that you did not sign up for, but especially

25:06.000 --> 25:08.320
 I've been hanging out with a guy named Joe Rogan recently.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
 Sure.

25:09.320 --> 25:13.720
 So it's very important for me and him to figure this out.

25:13.720 --> 25:18.320
 If a president, because you said you implied the president is very powerful, if a president

25:18.320 --> 25:26.640
 shows up and US government is in fact in possession of aliens, alien spacecraft, do you think

25:26.640 --> 25:33.960
 the president will be told a more responsible adult historian question version of that?

25:33.960 --> 25:40.720
 Is there some things that the machine of government keeps secret from the president?

25:40.720 --> 25:42.800
 Or is the president ultimately at the very center?

25:42.800 --> 25:49.120
 So if you map out the set of information and power, you have CIA, you have all these organizations

25:49.120 --> 25:59.920
 that do the machinery of government, not just like the passing of bills, but gaining information,

25:59.920 --> 26:07.080
 homeland security, actually engaging in wars, all those kinds of things.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.280
 How central is the president?

26:09.280 --> 26:14.720
 Would the president know some of the shady things that are going on?

26:14.720 --> 26:21.480
 Or some kind of cyber security stuff against Russia and China, all those kinds of things.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.760
 Is the president really made aware?

26:23.760 --> 26:26.600
 And if so, how nervous does that make you?

26:26.600 --> 26:31.760
 So presidents, like leaders of any complex organizations, don't know everything that

26:31.760 --> 26:32.760
 goes on.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.240
 They have to ask the right questions.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.760
 This is Machiavelli.

26:35.760 --> 26:40.160
 Most important thing a leader has to do is ask the right questions.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.080
 You don't have to know the answers.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.520
 That's why you hire smart people, but you have to ask the right questions.

26:45.520 --> 26:50.400
 So if the president asks the U.S. government, those who are responsible for the aliens or

26:50.400 --> 26:54.720
 responsible for the cyber warfare against Russia, they will answer honestly.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.320
 They will have to.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.120
 But they will not volunteer that information in all cases.

27:00.120 --> 27:05.280
 So the best way a president can operate is to have people around him or her who are not

27:05.280 --> 27:06.720
 the traditional policy makers.

27:06.720 --> 27:12.880
 This is where I think academic experts are important, suggesting questions to ask to

27:12.880 --> 27:15.280
 therefore try to get the information.

27:15.280 --> 27:24.400
 Makes me nervous because I think human nature is such that the academics, the experts, everybody

27:24.400 --> 27:32.320
 is almost afraid to ask the questions for which the answers might be burdensome.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.320
 Yes.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.200
 That's right.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.840
 And you can get into a lot of trouble not asking.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.560
 It's the old elephant in the room.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.560
 Correct.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.060
 Correct.

27:43.060 --> 27:44.280
 This is exactly right.

27:44.280 --> 27:49.520
 And too often, mediocre leaders and those who try to protect them try to shield themselves.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.560
 They don't want to know certain things.

27:51.560 --> 27:55.720
 So this is part of what happened with the use of torture by the United States, which

27:55.720 --> 27:59.800
 is a war crime, during the war on terror.

27:59.800 --> 28:04.240
 President Bush at times intentionally did not ask and people around him prevented him

28:04.240 --> 28:08.240
 from asking or discouraged him from asking questions he should have asked to know about

28:08.240 --> 28:09.960
 what was going on.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.400
 And that's how we ended up where we did.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.320
 You could say the same thing about Reagan and Iran Contra.

28:15.320 --> 28:21.280
 I wonder what it takes to be the kind of leader that steps in and asks some difficult questions.

28:21.280 --> 28:25.920
 So aliens is one, UFO spacecraft, right?

28:25.920 --> 28:31.120
 Another one, yeah, tortures, another one, the CIA, how much information is being collected

28:31.120 --> 28:32.680
 about Americans?

28:32.680 --> 28:37.920
 I can see as a president being very uncomfortable asking that question, because if the answer

28:37.920 --> 28:43.520
 is a lot of information is being collected by Americans, then you have to be the guy

28:43.520 --> 28:46.520
 who lives with that information.

28:46.520 --> 28:52.680
 For the rest of your life, you have to walk around, you're probably not going to reform

28:52.680 --> 28:53.680
 that system.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.680
 It's very difficult.

28:54.680 --> 28:58.720
 You probably have to be very picky about which things you reform, you don't have much time.

28:58.720 --> 29:04.000
 It takes a lot of effort to restructure things, but you nevertheless would have to be basically

29:04.000 --> 29:13.840
 lying to yourself, to all those around you about the unethical things, depends of course

29:13.840 --> 29:17.160
 what your ethical system is.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.360
 I wonder what it takes to ask those hard questions.

29:20.360 --> 29:26.400
 I wonder if how few of us can be great leaders like that.

29:26.400 --> 29:32.920
 And I wonder if our political system, the electoral system, is such that makes it likely

29:32.920 --> 29:35.800
 that such leaders will come to power.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.600
 It's hard and you can't ask all the right questions and there is a legal hazard if you

29:39.600 --> 29:41.720
 know things at certain times.

29:41.720 --> 29:45.160
 But I think you can, back to your point on hiring, you can hire people who will do that

29:45.160 --> 29:46.760
 in their domains.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.720
 And then you have to trust that when they think it's something that's a question you

29:49.720 --> 29:52.320
 need to ask, they'll pass that on to you.

29:52.320 --> 29:57.080
 This is why it's not a good idea to have loyalists because loyalists will shield you from things.

29:57.080 --> 30:01.600
 It's a good idea to have people of integrity who you can rely on and who you think will

30:01.600 --> 30:07.280
 ask those right questions and then pass that down through their organization.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.120
 What's inspiring to you?

30:09.120 --> 30:15.040
 What's insightful to you about several of the presidencies throughout the recent decades?

30:15.040 --> 30:20.000
 Is there somebody that stands out to you that's interesting and sort of in your study of how

30:20.000 --> 30:22.560
 the office has changed?

30:22.560 --> 30:25.360
 Well, Bill Clinton is one of the most fascinating figures.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.840
 Why can't I apologize?

30:26.840 --> 30:30.440
 Bill Clinton just puts a smile on my face every time somebody mentions him at this point.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.440
 I don't know why.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.640
 He's, I guess, charisma, I suppose.

30:33.640 --> 30:42.200
 Well, and he's a unique individual, but he fascinates me because he's a figure of such

30:42.200 --> 30:51.600
 enormous talent and enormous appetite and such little self control and such extremes.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.560
 I think it's not just that he tells us something about the presidency, he tells us something

30:54.560 --> 30:56.560
 about our society.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.400
 American society, this is not new to our time, is filled with enormous reservoirs of talent

31:01.400 --> 31:03.000
 and creativity.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.960
 Those have a bright and a dark side and you see both with Bill Clinton.

31:06.960 --> 31:11.240
 In some ways, he's the mirror of the best and worst of our society.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.120
 Maybe that's really what presidents are in the end.

31:13.120 --> 31:16.800
 They're mirrors of our world, that we get the government we deserve, we get the leaders

31:16.800 --> 31:17.800
 we deserve.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.760
 I wish we embraced that a little bit more.

31:19.760 --> 31:24.960
 A lot of people criticize Donald Trump for certain human qualities that he has, a lot

31:24.960 --> 31:28.600
 of people criticize Bill Clinton for certain human qualities.

31:28.600 --> 31:34.080
 I wish we'd kind of embraced the chaos of that because he does, you're right, in some

31:34.080 --> 31:41.440
 sense represent, he doesn't represent the greatest ideal of America, but the flawed

31:41.440 --> 31:45.320
 aspect of human nature that he represents and that's the beautiful thing about America,

31:45.320 --> 31:55.000
 the diversity of this land, the mix of it, the corruption of within capitalism, the

31:55.000 --> 31:59.120
 beauty of capitalism, the innovation, all those kinds of things, the people that start

31:59.120 --> 32:04.480
 from nothing and create everything, the Elon Musk's of the world and the Bill Gates and

32:04.480 --> 32:10.400
 so on, but also the people Bernie Mados and all as the Me Too movement has showed the

32:10.400 --> 32:15.280
 multitude of creeps that apparently permeate the entirety of our system.

32:15.280 --> 32:23.320
 So I don't know, there is something, there is some sense in which we put our president

32:23.320 --> 32:31.080
 on a pedestal which actually creates a fake human being.

32:31.080 --> 32:37.040
 The standard we hold them to is forcing the fake politicians to come to power versus the

32:37.040 --> 32:44.600
 authentic one, which is in some sense the promise of Donald Trump is a definitive statement

32:44.600 --> 32:46.520
 of authenticity.

32:46.520 --> 32:51.680
 It's like this, the opposite of the fake politician is whatever else you want to say

32:51.680 --> 32:57.680
 about him is there's the chaos that's unlike anything else that came before.

32:57.680 --> 33:03.520
 One thing, and this particular may be preference and quirk of mind, but I really admire, maybe

33:03.520 --> 33:11.280
 I'm romanticizing the past again, but I romanticized the presidents that were students of history.

33:11.280 --> 33:23.360
 They were almost like King philosophers that made speeches that reverberated through decades

33:23.360 --> 33:27.240
 after.

33:27.240 --> 33:31.640
 Using the words of those presidents, whether written by them or not, we tell the story

33:31.640 --> 33:35.480
 of America.

33:35.480 --> 33:39.960
 Even Obama has been an exceptionally good, as far as I know, I apologize if I'm incorrect

33:39.960 --> 33:46.080
 on this, but from everything I've seen, he was a very deep scholar of history.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.240
 I really admire that.

33:48.240 --> 33:53.680
 Is that through the history of the office of the presidency?

33:53.680 --> 33:57.600
 Is that just your own preference or is that supposed to come with a job?

33:57.600 --> 34:00.000
 Are you supposed to be a student of history?

34:00.000 --> 34:03.040
 I think, I mean, I'm obviously biased as a historian, but I do think it comes with a

34:03.040 --> 34:04.040
 job.

34:04.040 --> 34:09.440
 Every president I've studied had a serious interest in history.

34:09.440 --> 34:13.240
 Now, how they pursued that interest would vary.

34:13.240 --> 34:16.640
 Obama was more bookish, more academic.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.600
 So was George W. Bush in strange ways.

34:18.600 --> 34:22.360
 George H. W. Bush was less so, but George H. W. Bush loved to talk to people, so he

34:22.360 --> 34:24.560
 would talk to historians.

34:24.560 --> 34:30.040
 Ronald Reagan loved movies and movies were an insight into history for him.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.680
 He likes to watch movies about another time.

34:32.680 --> 34:37.120
 It wasn't always the best of history, but he was interested in what is a fundamental

34:37.120 --> 34:38.800
 historical question.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.840
 How has our society developed?

34:40.840 --> 34:43.520
 How has it grown and changed over time?

34:43.520 --> 34:47.160
 And how has that change affected who we are today?

34:47.160 --> 34:48.960
 That's the historical question.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.080
 It's really interesting to me.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.680
 I do a lot of work with business leaders and others, too.

34:53.680 --> 34:58.600
 You reach a certain point in any career and you become a historian because you realize

34:58.600 --> 35:04.120
 that the formulas and the technical knowledge that you've gained got you to where you are.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.360
 But now your decisions are about human nature.

35:07.360 --> 35:12.080
 Your decisions are about social change and they can't be answered technically.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.200
 They can only be answered by studying human beings.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
 And what is history?

35:16.200 --> 35:19.880
 It's studying the laboratory of human behavior.

35:19.880 --> 35:28.320
 To sort of play devil's advocate, especially in the engineering scientific domains, I often

35:28.320 --> 35:35.000
 see history holding us back, sort of the way things were done in the past are not necessarily

35:35.000 --> 35:43.160
 going to hold the key to what will progress us into the future.

35:43.160 --> 35:47.240
 Of course, with history and studying human nature, it does seem like humans are just

35:47.240 --> 35:48.240
 the same.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.840
 It's just like the same problems over and over.

35:51.840 --> 35:56.400
 So in that sense, it feels like history has all the lessons, whether we're talking about

35:56.400 --> 36:02.000
 wars, whether we're talking about corruption, whether we're talking about economics.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.760
 I think there's a difference between history and antiquarianism.

36:06.760 --> 36:12.240
 So antiquarianism, what some people call history, is the desire to go back to the past or stay

36:12.240 --> 36:13.240
 stuck in the past.

36:13.240 --> 36:17.320
 So antiquarianism is the desire to have the desk that Abraham Lincoln sat at.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.160
 Wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk?

36:19.160 --> 36:20.160
 I'd love to have that desk.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.040
 If I had a few extra million dollars, I'd acquire it, right?

36:23.040 --> 36:25.800
 So in a way, that's antiquarianism.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.760
 That's trying to capture and hold on, hold on to the past.

36:28.760 --> 36:33.160
 The past is a talisman for antiquarians.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.160
 What history is, is the study of change over time.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.120
 That's the real definition of historical study and historical thinking.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.280
 And so what we're studying is change.

36:42.280 --> 36:47.360
 And so a historian should never say, we have to do things the way we've done them in the

36:47.360 --> 36:48.360
 past.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.080
 The historian should say, we can't do them the way we did them in the past.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.320
 We can't step in the same river twice.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.560
 Every podcast of yours is different from the last one, right?

36:56.560 --> 37:00.880
 We plan it out and then it goes in its own direction, right?

37:00.880 --> 37:03.040
 And what are we studying then in history?

37:03.040 --> 37:08.120
 We're studying the patterns of change and we're recognizing we're part of a pattern.

37:08.120 --> 37:12.160
 So what I would say to the historian who's trying to hold the engineer back, I'd say,

37:12.160 --> 37:14.920
 no, don't tell that engineer not to do this.

37:14.920 --> 37:19.960
 Tell them to understand how this fits into the relationship with other engineering products

37:19.960 --> 37:23.720
 and other activities from the past that still affect us today.

37:23.720 --> 37:28.600
 For example, any product you produce is going to be used by human beings who have prejudices.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.360
 It's going to go into an unequal society.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.280
 Don't assume it's going to go into an equal society.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.720
 Don't assume that when you create a social media site that people are going to use it

37:35.720 --> 37:38.920
 fairly and put only truthful things on it.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.920
 We shouldn't be surprised.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.120
 That's where human nature comes in.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.560
 But it's not trying to hold onto the past.

37:43.560 --> 37:47.960
 It's trying to use the knowledge from the past to better inform the changes today.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.200
 I have to ask you about George Washington.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.800
 It may be, maybe you have some insights.

37:52.800 --> 38:00.040
 It seems like he's such a fascinating figure in the context of the study of power, because

38:00.040 --> 38:06.680
 I intuitively have come to internalize the belief that power corrupts and absolute power

38:06.680 --> 38:14.760
 corrupts absolutely.

38:14.760 --> 38:21.080
 In thinking that we cannot trust any one individual, I can't trust myself with power.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.960
 We can trust anybody with power.

38:22.960 --> 38:27.680
 We have to create institutions and structures that prevent us from ever being able to amass

38:27.680 --> 38:28.840
 absolute power.

38:28.840 --> 38:34.400
 Yet, here's a guy, George Washington, who seems to, you can correct me if I'm wrong,

38:34.400 --> 38:37.240
 but he seems to give away relinquish power.

38:37.240 --> 38:45.480
 It feels like George Washington did it almost like the purest of ways, which is believes

38:45.480 --> 38:54.400
 in this country, but he just believes he's not the person to carry it forward.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
 What do you make of that?

38:55.400 --> 38:58.680
 What kind of human does it take to give away that power?

38:58.680 --> 39:04.360
 Is there some hopeful message we can carry through to the future, to elect leaders like

39:04.360 --> 39:09.800
 that, or to find friends to hang out with or like that?

39:09.800 --> 39:10.800
 What is that?

39:10.800 --> 39:11.800
 How do you explain that?

39:11.800 --> 39:15.840
 It's actually the most important thing about George Washington, it's the right thing to

39:15.840 --> 39:17.960
 bring up.

39:17.960 --> 39:23.240
 What the historian Gary Wills wrote years ago, I'm going to quote him, was that Washington

39:23.240 --> 39:28.440
 recognized that sometimes you get more power by giving it up than by trying to hold on

39:28.440 --> 39:31.040
 to every last piece of it.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.920
 Washington gives up power at the end of the revolution.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.000
 He's successfully carried through the Revolutionary War Ames.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.520
 He's commander of the Revolutionary Forces, and he gives up his command, and then of course

39:40.520 --> 39:43.480
 he's president, and after two terms he gives up his command.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.480
 What is he doing?

39:44.480 --> 39:50.120
 He's an ambitious person, but he's recognizing that the most important currency he has for

39:50.120 --> 39:56.840
 power is his respected status as a disinterested statesman.

39:56.840 --> 40:00.640
 That's really what his power is, and how does he further that power?

40:00.640 --> 40:04.520
 By showing that he doesn't crave power.

40:04.520 --> 40:10.040
 So he was self aware of this, and very self aware of this, and very sophisticated in understanding

40:10.040 --> 40:11.040
 this.

40:11.040 --> 40:16.000
 And I think there are many other leaders who recognize that.

40:16.000 --> 40:22.720
 You can look to, in some ways, the story of many of our presidents who, even before there

40:22.720 --> 40:27.840
 is a two term limit in the Constitution, leave after two terms, they do that because they

40:27.840 --> 40:34.240
 recognize that their power is the power of being a statesman, not of being a president.

40:34.240 --> 40:42.080
 I still wonder what kind of human being it takes to do that, because I've been studying

40:42.080 --> 40:51.880
 Vladimir Putin quite a bit, and I believe he still has popular support, that that's

40:51.880 --> 40:57.680
 not fully manipulated, because I know a lot of people in Russia, almost the entirety of

40:57.680 --> 41:03.840
 my family in Russia, are big supporters of Putin, and everybody I talk to, that's not

41:03.840 --> 41:06.240
 just on social media.

41:06.240 --> 41:11.080
 The people that live in Russia seem to support him.

41:11.080 --> 41:16.800
 It feels like this will be in a George Washington way.

41:16.800 --> 41:24.240
 Now will be the time that Putin, just like Yeltsin, could relinquish power, and thereby,

41:24.240 --> 41:32.000
 in the eyes of Russians, become, in the long arc of history, be viewed as a great leader.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.560
 You look at the economic growth of Russia.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.240
 You look at the rescue from the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia, finding its

41:38.240 --> 41:45.840
 footing, and then relinquishing power in a way that perhaps, if Russia succeeds, forms

41:45.840 --> 41:48.160
 a truly democratic state.

41:48.160 --> 41:52.880
 This would be how Putin can become one of the great leaders in Russian history, at least

41:52.880 --> 41:55.800
 in the context of the 21st century.

41:55.800 --> 42:01.680
 I think there are two reasons why this is really hard for Putin and for others.

42:01.680 --> 42:07.320
 One is the trappings of power are very seductive, as you said before, they're corrupting.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.440
 This is a real problem.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.120
 If it's in the business context, you don't want to give up that private jet.

42:13.120 --> 42:17.560
 If it's in Putin's context, it's billions of dollars every year that he's able to take

42:17.560 --> 42:19.600
 for himself or give to his friends.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.800
 It's not that he'll be poor if he leaves, he'll still be rich, and he has billions of

42:22.800 --> 42:27.000
 dollars stored away, but he won't be able to get the new billions.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
 That's part of it.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.440
 The trappings of power are a big deal.

42:30.440 --> 42:35.080
 And then second, in Putin's case in particular, he has to be worried about what happens next.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.080
 Will he be tried?

42:36.080 --> 42:38.240
 Will someone try to come and arrest him?

42:38.240 --> 42:41.800
 Will someone try to come and assassinate him?

42:41.800 --> 42:47.560
 Washington recognized that leaving early limited the corruption and limited the enemies that

42:47.560 --> 42:48.920
 you made.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.040
 And so it was a strategic choice.

42:51.040 --> 42:55.480
 Putin is at this point bringing power too long, and this comes back to your core insight.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.080
 It's a cliche, but it's true, power corrupts.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.400
 No one should have power for too long.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.760
 This was one of the best insights the founders of the United States had.

43:02.760 --> 43:07.760
 That power was to be held for a short time as a fiduciary responsibility, not as something

43:07.760 --> 43:08.880
 you owned.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.840
 This is the problem with monarchy, with aristocracy, that you own power.

43:12.840 --> 43:17.000
 We don't own power, we're in holding it in trust.

43:17.000 --> 43:24.920
 Yeah, there's some probably very specific psychological study of how many years it takes

43:24.920 --> 43:28.760
 for you to forget that you can't own power.

43:28.760 --> 43:30.440
 That's right.

43:30.440 --> 43:35.360
 That could be a much more rigorous discussion about the length of terms that are appropriate,

43:35.360 --> 43:40.760
 but really there's a amount like Stalin had power for 30 years, like Putin is pushing

43:40.760 --> 43:44.280
 those that many years already.

43:44.280 --> 43:49.160
 There's a certain point where you forget the person you were before you took the power.

43:49.160 --> 43:55.200
 You forget to be humble in the face of this responsibility, and then there's no going back.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.200
 That's right.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.760
 That's how dictators are born.

43:57.760 --> 44:06.040
 That's how the evil authoritarians become evil, or well, let's not use the word evil,

44:06.040 --> 44:12.480
 but counterproductive, destructive to the ideal that they initially probably came to

44:12.480 --> 44:13.480
 office with.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.480
 That's right.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.480
 That's right.

44:15.480 --> 44:21.040
 One of the core historical insights is people should move jobs, and it's the place for CEOs

44:21.040 --> 44:22.040
 probably.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.040
 Absolutely.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.800
 Apps, they can become CEOs somewhere else, but don't stay CEO one place too long.

44:26.800 --> 44:27.800
 That's the problem with startups.

44:27.800 --> 44:32.080
 The founder, you can have a brilliant founder, and that founder doesn't want to let go.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.480
 It's the same issue.

44:33.480 --> 44:39.840
 At the same time, this is where Elon Musk and a few others like Larry Page and Sergey

44:39.840 --> 44:45.320
 Brin that stayed for quite a long time, and they actually were the beacon.

44:45.320 --> 44:51.320
 They on their shoulders carried the dream of the company, where everybody else doubted,

44:51.320 --> 44:55.040
 but that seems to be the exception versus the rule.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.600
 And Sergey, for example, has stepped back.

44:57.600 --> 45:01.840
 He plays less of a day to day role and is not running Google in the way he did.

45:01.840 --> 45:07.680
 But the interesting thing is, he stepped back in a quite tragic way from what I've seen,

45:07.680 --> 45:14.040
 which is, I think Google's mission, an initial mission of making the world's information

45:14.040 --> 45:18.360
 accessible to everybody is one of the most beautiful missions of any company in the history

45:18.360 --> 45:19.360
 of the world.

45:19.360 --> 45:26.000
 It's what Google has done with a search engine and other efforts that are similar, like scanning

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
 a lot of books.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
 Sure.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
 It's just incredible.

45:29.000 --> 45:38.360
 It's similar to Wikipedia, but what he said was that it's not the same company anymore.

45:38.360 --> 45:43.360
 And I know maybe I'm reading too much into it because it's more maybe practically saying

45:43.360 --> 45:47.240
 just the size of the company is much larger, the kind of leadership that's great.

45:47.240 --> 45:54.280
 But at the same time, they changed the motto from don't be evil to it's becoming corporatized

45:54.280 --> 45:56.040
 and all those kinds of things.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.040
 It's sad.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.560
 There also are cycles, right?

45:59.560 --> 46:01.240
 History is about cycles, right?

46:01.240 --> 46:02.640
 They're cycles to life.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.160
 They're cycles to organizations.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.160
 It's sad.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.160
 I mean, it's sad.

46:07.160 --> 46:14.480
 Steve Jobs, Leaving Apple, by passing away, said, what the future of SpaceX and Tesla looks

46:14.480 --> 46:17.040
 like with Adi Elon Musk is quite sad.

46:17.040 --> 46:20.440
 It's very possible that those companies become something very different.

46:20.440 --> 46:29.000
 They become something much more like corporate and stale.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.880
 So maybe most of progress is made through cycles.

46:31.880 --> 46:35.800
 Maybe New Elon Musk comes along, all those kinds of things.

46:35.800 --> 46:43.400
 But it does seem that the American system of government has built into it the cycling

46:43.400 --> 46:47.760
 thing, that makes it effective and it makes it last very long.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.440
 It lasts a very long time, right?

46:50.440 --> 46:53.400
 It continues to excel and lead the world.

46:53.400 --> 46:54.400
 Sure.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.400
 Sure.

46:55.400 --> 46:56.720
 And let's hope it continues to.

46:56.720 --> 47:03.800
 I mean, we're into a third century and democracies on this scale rarely last that long.

47:03.800 --> 47:06.600
 So that's a point of pride.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.000
 But it also means we need to be attentive to keep our house in order because it's not

47:10.000 --> 47:13.520
 inevitable that this experiment continues.

47:13.520 --> 47:17.240
 No, it's important to meditate on that actually.

47:17.240 --> 47:24.560
 You mentioned that FDR, Franklin Roosevelt is one of the great leaders in American history.

47:24.560 --> 47:25.920
 Why is that?

47:25.920 --> 47:29.720
 Franklin Roosevelt had the power of empathy.

47:29.720 --> 47:34.360
 No leader that I have ever studied or been around or spent any time reading about was

47:34.360 --> 47:39.320
 able to connect with people who were so different from himself as Franklin Roosevelt.

47:39.320 --> 47:41.080
 He came from the most elite family.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.360
 He never had to work for a paycheck in his life.

47:43.360 --> 47:47.040
 When he was president, he was still collecting an allowance from his mom.

47:47.040 --> 47:52.360
 You couldn't be more elite than Franklin Roosevelt, but he authentically connected.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.520
 This was not propaganda.

47:54.520 --> 48:00.640
 He was able to feel the pain and understand the lives of some of the most destitute Americans

48:00.640 --> 48:02.040
 in other parts of the country.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.040
 It's interesting.

48:03.040 --> 48:08.040
 So through one of the hardest economic periods of American history, he was able to feel the

48:08.040 --> 48:09.040
 pain.

48:09.040 --> 48:13.320
 The number of immigrants I read oral histories from or who have written themselves, Saul

48:13.320 --> 48:17.480
 Bello was one example, the great novice who talked about how as immigrants to the US,

48:17.480 --> 48:19.440
 Saul Bello was a Russian Jewish immigrant.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.280
 He said, growing up in Chicago, politicians were all trying to steal from us.

48:22.280 --> 48:28.520
 I didn't think any of them cared until I heard FDR, and I knew he spoke to me.

48:28.520 --> 48:32.600
 I think part of it was FDR really tried to understand people.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.600
 That's the first thing.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.640
 He was humble enough to try to do that, but second, he had a talent for that and it's

48:36.640 --> 48:41.280
 hard to know exactly what it was, but he had a talent for putting himself, imagining

48:41.280 --> 48:45.760
 himself in someone else's shoes.

48:45.760 --> 48:52.360
 What stands out to you as important, so he went through the Great Depression, so the

48:52.360 --> 48:57.560
 New Deal, which some people criticize, some people see, I mean, it's funny to look at

48:57.560 --> 49:05.800
 some of these policies and their long ripple effects, but at the time, it's some of the

49:05.800 --> 49:09.360
 most innovative policies in the history of America.

49:09.360 --> 49:14.440
 You could say they're ultimately not good for America, but they're nevertheless hold

49:14.440 --> 49:17.840
 within them very rich and important lessons.

49:17.840 --> 49:22.880
 But the New Deal, obviously World War II, that entire process, is there something that

49:22.880 --> 49:29.720
 stands out to you as a particularly great moment that made FDR?

49:29.720 --> 49:36.920
 Yes, I think what FDR does from his first 100 days in office forward, and this begins

49:36.920 --> 49:43.720
 with his fireside chats, is he helps Americans to see that they're all in it together.

49:43.720 --> 49:49.480
 That's by creating hope and creating a sense of common suffering and common mission.

49:49.480 --> 49:51.320
 It's not offering simple solutions.

49:51.320 --> 49:55.440
 One of the lessons from FDR is if you want to bring people together, don't offer a simple

49:55.440 --> 49:59.720
 solution, because as soon as I offer a simple solution, I have people for it and against

49:59.720 --> 50:00.720
 it.

50:00.720 --> 50:01.720
 Don't do that.

50:01.720 --> 50:06.040
 Explain the problem, frame the problem, and then give people a mission.

50:06.040 --> 50:12.560
 So Roosevelt's first radio address in March of 1933, the banking system is collapsing.

50:12.560 --> 50:13.880
 We can't imagine it, right?

50:13.880 --> 50:16.480
 Banks were closing, and you couldn't get your money out.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.000
 Your life savings would be lost, right?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.480
 We can't imagine that happening in our world today.

50:20.480 --> 50:24.560
 He comes on the radio, he takes five minutes to explain how banking works.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.640
 Most people didn't understand how banking works, right?

50:26.640 --> 50:28.560
 They don't actually hold your money in a vault.

50:28.560 --> 50:33.440
 They lend it out to someone else, and then he explains why if you go and take your money

50:33.440 --> 50:36.920
 out of the bank and put it in your mattress, you're making it worse for yourself.

50:36.920 --> 50:41.560
 He explains this, and then he says, I don't have a solution, but here's what I want to

50:41.560 --> 50:42.560
 do.

50:42.560 --> 50:47.640
 I'm going to send in government officers to examine the banks and show you the books

50:47.640 --> 50:52.520
 on the banks, and I want you to help me by going and putting your money back in the banks.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.280
 We're all going to do this together.

50:54.280 --> 50:58.640
 No simple solution, no ideological statement, but a sense of common mission.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.400
 Let's go out and do this together.

51:00.400 --> 51:04.400
 When you read, as I have so many of these oral histories and memoirs for people who

51:04.400 --> 51:08.600
 lived through that period, many of them disagreed with some of his policies.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.520
 Many of them thought he was too close to Jews, and they didn't like the fact he had a woman

51:11.520 --> 51:16.720
 in his cabinet and all that, but they felt he cared, and they felt they were part of

51:16.720 --> 51:18.640
 some common mission.

51:18.640 --> 51:23.040
 When they talk about their experience fighting in World War II, whether in Europe or Asia,

51:23.040 --> 51:24.440
 it was that that prepared them.

51:24.440 --> 51:28.800
 They knew what it meant to be an American when they were over there.

51:28.800 --> 51:33.280
 That to me is a model of leadership, and I think that's as possible today as it's ever

51:33.280 --> 51:34.280
 been.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.280
 Do you think it's possible?

51:35.280 --> 51:43.160
 I was going to ask this, again, it may be a very shallow view, but it feels like this

51:43.160 --> 51:48.960
 country is more divided than it has been in recent history.

51:48.960 --> 51:54.680
 The social media and all those kinds of things are merely revealing the division as opposed

51:54.680 --> 52:01.560
 to creating the division, but is it possible to have a leader that unites in the same way

52:01.560 --> 52:06.360
 that FDR did without, well, we're living through a pandemic.

52:06.360 --> 52:07.360
 This is already...

52:07.360 --> 52:08.360
 Yes.

52:08.360 --> 52:13.000
 I was going to say without suffering, but this is economic suffering and a huge number

52:13.000 --> 52:18.680
 of people have lost their job, so is it possible to have, is there one, a hunger?

52:18.680 --> 52:22.480
 Is there a possibility to have an FDR style leader who unites?

52:22.480 --> 52:23.480
 Yes.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.720
 I think that is what President Biden is trying.

52:25.720 --> 52:29.480
 I'm not saying he'll succeed, but I think that's what he's trying to do.

52:29.480 --> 52:35.000
 The way you do this is you do not allow yourself to be captured by your opponents in Congress

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
 or somewhere else.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.040
 FDR had a lot of opponents in Congress.

52:38.040 --> 52:42.000
 He had a lot of opponents in politics, governors, and others who didn't like him.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.440
 Herbert Hoover was still around and still accusing FDR of being a conspiratist and all

52:47.440 --> 52:48.440
 these other things.

52:48.440 --> 52:53.400
 So you don't allow yourself to be captured by the leaders of the other side.

52:53.400 --> 52:55.960
 You go over their heads to the people.

52:55.960 --> 53:00.680
 And so today, the way to do this is to explain to people and empathize with the suffering

53:00.680 --> 53:04.880
 and dislocation and difficulties they're dealing with and show that you're trying to

53:04.880 --> 53:06.120
 help them.

53:06.120 --> 53:11.560
 Not an easy solution, not a simple statement, but here are some things we can all do together.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.720
 That's why I think infrastructure makes a lot of sense.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.400
 It's what FDR invested into.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.440
 FDR built Hoover Dam.

53:17.440 --> 53:22.880
 Hoover Dam turned the lights on for young Lyndon Johnson, who grew up outside of Austin.

53:22.880 --> 53:28.520
 FDR was the one who invested in road construction that was then continued by Dwight Eisenhower,

53:28.520 --> 53:31.400
 by a Republican with the Interstate Highway System.

53:31.400 --> 53:36.000
 FDR invested through the WPA in building thousands of schools in our country, planting

53:36.000 --> 53:37.440
 trees.

53:37.440 --> 53:40.560
 That's the kind of work that can bring people together.

53:40.560 --> 53:44.240
 You don't have to be a Democrat or a Republican to say, you know what, we'd be a lot better

53:44.240 --> 53:47.480
 off in my community if we had better infrastructure today.

53:47.480 --> 53:48.920
 I want to be a part of that.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.120
 Maybe I can get a job doing that.

53:50.120 --> 53:52.920
 Maybe my company can benefit from that.

53:52.920 --> 53:57.280
 You bring people together and that way it becomes a common mission, even if we have

53:57.280 --> 53:58.800
 different ideological positions.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.720
 Yeah, it's funny.

54:01.720 --> 54:11.360
 When I first heard Joe Biden many years ago, I think he ran for president against Obama.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.520
 Before I heard him speak, I really liked him.

54:13.520 --> 54:18.000
 But once I heard him speak, I started to like him less and less.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.520
 It speaks to something interesting, where it's hard to put into words why you connect

54:24.520 --> 54:25.520
 with people.

54:25.520 --> 54:31.160
 The empathy that you mentioned in FDR, you have these bad part in the French motherfuckers

54:31.160 --> 54:34.040
 like Teddy Roosevelt that connect with you.

54:34.040 --> 54:39.720
 There's something just powerful and with Joe Biden, I want to really like him and there's

54:39.720 --> 54:45.720
 something not quite there where it feels like he doesn't quite know my pain.

54:45.720 --> 54:53.040
 Even though he on paper, he knows the pain of the people and there's something not connecting.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.040
 It's hard to explain.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.680
 It's hard to put into words.

54:56.680 --> 55:04.600
 It makes me not, as an engineer and scientist, it makes me not feel good about presidencies

55:04.600 --> 55:09.000
 because it makes me feel like it's more art than science.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.320
 It is an art and I think it's exactly an art for the reasons you laid out.

55:12.320 --> 55:13.320
 It's aesthetic.

55:13.320 --> 55:14.320
 It's about feeling.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.320
 It's about emotion.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.320
 All the things that we can't engineer.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.080
 We've tried for centuries to engineer emotion.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.080
 We're never going to do it.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.080
 Don't try it.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.080
 I'm a parent of teenagers.

55:22.080 --> 55:24.960
 Don't even try to explain emotion.

55:24.960 --> 55:27.240
 But you hit on the key point and the key challenge for Biden.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.000
 He's got to find the right words.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.560
 It's not finding the words to bullshit people.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.440
 It's finding the words to help express.

55:34.440 --> 55:39.720
 We've all felt empowered and felt good when someone uses words that put into words what

55:39.720 --> 55:41.240
 we're feeling.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.240
 That's what he needs.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.240
 That's the job of a leader.

55:43.240 --> 55:47.560
 There's certain words, I haven't heard many politicians use those words, but there's certain

55:47.560 --> 55:54.960
 words that make you forget that you're for immigration or against immigration.

55:54.960 --> 55:57.680
 Make you forget whether you're for wars and against wars.

55:57.680 --> 56:05.160
 Make you forget about the bickering and somehow inspire you, elevate you to believe in the

56:05.160 --> 56:07.440
 greatness that this country could be.

56:07.440 --> 56:08.440
 Yes.

56:08.440 --> 56:15.440
 In that same way, the reason I moved to Austin, it's funny to say, is I just heard words from

56:15.440 --> 56:21.800
 people, from friends, where they're excited by the possibility of the future here.

56:21.800 --> 56:25.000
 I wasn't thinking what's the right thing to do.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.200
 That's strategic because I want to launch a business.

56:28.200 --> 56:33.720
 There's a lot of arguments for San Francisco or maybe staying in Boston in my case, but

56:33.720 --> 56:39.560
 there's this excitement that was beyond reason, that was emotional.

56:39.560 --> 56:40.920
 That's what it seems like.

56:40.920 --> 56:45.320
 That's what great leaders do, but that's what builds countries.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.800
 That's what builds great businesses.

56:47.800 --> 56:48.800
 That's right.

56:48.800 --> 56:52.760
 It's what people say about Austin, for example, all the time, talented people who come here

56:52.760 --> 56:54.560
 like yourself.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.840
 Here's the interesting thing, no one person creates that.

56:56.840 --> 56:58.640
 The words emerge.

56:58.640 --> 57:03.240
 Part of what FDR understood, you should've got to find the words out there and use them.

57:03.240 --> 57:06.000
 You don't have to be the creator of them.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.400
 Just as the great painter doesn't invent the painting, they're taking things from others.

57:10.400 --> 57:19.440
 As a smaller side, is there something you could say about FDR and Hitler?

57:19.440 --> 57:27.760
 I constantly tried to think, can this person, can this moment in history have been circumvented,

57:27.760 --> 57:29.480
 prevented?

57:29.480 --> 57:31.760
 Can Hitler have been stopped?

57:31.760 --> 57:38.040
 Can some of the atrocities from my own family that my grandparents had to live through,

57:38.040 --> 57:42.480
 the starvation in the Soviet Union, so the thing that people don't often talk about is

57:42.480 --> 57:47.000
 the atrocities committed by Stalin and his own people.

57:47.000 --> 57:58.560
 It feels like here's this great leader, FDR, that had the chance to have an impact on the

57:58.560 --> 58:08.480
 world that he already probably had a great positive impact, but had a chance to stop

58:08.480 --> 58:12.160
 maybe World War II or stop some of the evils.

58:12.160 --> 58:18.160
 When you look at how weak Hitler was from much of the 30s relative to militarily, relative

58:18.160 --> 58:23.880
 to everything else, how many people could've done a lot to stop him?

58:23.880 --> 58:26.760
 And FDR in particular didn't.

58:26.760 --> 58:36.920
 He tried to play, not pacify, but basically do diplomacy and let Germany do Germany, let

58:36.920 --> 58:40.880
 Europe do Europe, and focus on America.

58:40.880 --> 58:45.720
 Is there something you would, would you hold his feet to the fire on this, or is it very

58:45.720 --> 58:50.520
 difficult from the perspective of FDR to have known what was coming?

58:50.520 --> 58:54.640
 I think FDR had a sense of what was coming, not quite the enormity of what Hitler was

58:54.640 --> 58:57.320
 doing and not quite the enormity of what the Holocaust became.

58:57.320 --> 59:01.920
 I also lost relatives in the Holocaust.

59:01.920 --> 59:04.600
 And part of that was beyond the imagination of human beings.

59:04.600 --> 59:10.000
 But it's clear in his papers that as early as 1934, people he respected, who he knew

59:10.000 --> 59:13.920
 well told him that Hitler was very dangerous, they also thought Hitler was crazy, that he

59:13.920 --> 59:15.320
 was a lunatic.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.680
 Hamilton Fish Armstrong, who was a friend of Roosevelt's, who was actually at the Council

59:19.680 --> 59:22.520
 on Foreign Relations in New York, had a meeting with Hitler in 1934.

59:22.520 --> 59:26.560
 I remember reading the account of this, and he basically said to FDR, this man is gonna

59:26.560 --> 59:28.680
 cause a war, he's gonna cause a lot of damage.

59:28.680 --> 59:30.680
 Again, they didn't know quite the scale.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.360
 So they saw this coming.

59:32.360 --> 59:33.360
 They saw this coming.

59:33.360 --> 59:35.360
 FDR had two problems.

59:35.360 --> 59:38.760
 First, he had an American public that was deeply isolationist.

59:38.760 --> 59:41.480
 The opposite of the problem in a sense that we were talking about before.

59:41.480 --> 59:47.840
 If we're an overmilitarized society, now we were a deeply isolationist society in the 1930s.

59:47.840 --> 59:52.560
 The Depression reinforced that FDR actually had to break the law in the late 30s to support

59:52.560 --> 59:53.920
 the Allies.

59:53.920 --> 59:58.240
 So it was very hard to move the country in that direction, especially when he had this

59:58.240 --> 1:00:03.440
 program at home, the New Deal that he didn't want to jeopardize by alienating an isolationist

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.440
 public.

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:05.440
 That was the reality.

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:06.440
 We talked about political manipulation.

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:07.440
 He had to be conscious of that.

1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:09.440
 He had to know his audience.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:14.640
 And second, there were no Allies willing to invest in this either.

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:17.640
 The British were as committed to appeasement.

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:19.960
 As you know, you're obviously very knowledgeable about this.

1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:20.960
 The French were as well.

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:21.960
 It was very hard.

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:27.040
 The Russian government, the Soviet government, was cooperating to remilitarize Germany.

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:29.960
 So there weren't a lot of Allies out there either.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:37.400
 I think if there's a criticism to be made of FDR, it's that once we're in the war,

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:41.480
 he didn't do enough to stop, in particular, the killing of Jews.

1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:44.680
 And there are a number of historians, myself included, who have written about this, and

1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:45.680
 it's an endless debate.

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:46.680
 What should he have done?

1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:51.880
 There's no doubt by 1944, the United States had air superiority and could have bombed

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.960
 the rail lines to Auschwitz and other camps, and it would have saved as many as a million

1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:56.960
 Jews.

1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.760
 That's a lot of people who could have been saved.

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:01.680
 Why didn't FDR insist on that?

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:05.560
 In part because he wanted to use every resource possible to win the war.

1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:08.440
 He did not want to be accused of fighting the war for Jews.

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:13.280
 But I think it's also fair to say that he probably cared less about Jews and East Europeans

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:18.240
 than he did about others, those of his own Dutch ancestry, and from Western Europe.

1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.480
 And so even there, race comes in.

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.520
 It's also the explanation for the internment of Japanese in the United States, which is

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:29.560
 a horrible war crime committed by this heroic president, 120,000 Japanese American citizens

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.440
 lost their freedom unnecessarily.

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:38.160
 So he had his limitations and I think he could have done more during the war to save many

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:39.680
 more lives and I wish he had.

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:45.960
 And there's something to be said about empathy that you spoke, that FDR had empathy.

1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:52.160
 But us, for example, now there's many people who describe the atrocities happening in China

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:56.200
 and there's a bunch of places across the world where there's atrocities happening now and

1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:04.880
 we care, we do not uniformly apply how much we care for the suffering of others.

1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:05.880
 That's correct.

1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:06.880
 Depending on the group.

1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:07.880
 That's correct.

1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:15.800
 And in some sense, the role of the president is to rise above that natural human inclination

1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:22.240
 to protect, to do the us versus them to protect the inner circle and empathize with the suffering

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:24.760
 of those that are not like you.

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:25.760
 That's correct.

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:26.760
 I agree with that.

1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:29.760
 Yeah.

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:33.840
 Speaking of war, you wrote a book on Henry Kissinger.

1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:39.280
 It's not a great transition, but it made sense in my head.

1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:43.600
 Who was Henry Kissinger as a man and as a historical figure?

1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:47.760
 So Henry Kissinger to me is one of the most fascinating figures in history because he

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:53.200
 comes to the United States as a German Jewish immigrant at age 15, speaking no English.

1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:58.320
 And within a few years, he's a major figure influencing US foreign policy at the height

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:00.440
 of US power.

1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:07.160
 But while he's doing that, he's never elected to office and he's constantly reviled by people,

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.520
 including people who are anti Semitic because he's Jewish.

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.840
 But at the same time also, his exoticism makes him more attractive to people.

1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:20.120
 So someone like Nelson Rockefeller wants Kissinger around, he's one of Kissinger's first patrons

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:24.240
 because he wants a really smart Jew and Kissinger's going to be that smart Jew I call Kissinger

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.240
 a policy Jew.

1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:28.640
 They were these court Jews in the 16th and 17th and 18th centuries in Europe.

1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:31.400
 Every king wanted the Jew to manage his banking.

1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:35.760
 And in a sense, in the United States, in the second half of the 20th century, many presidents

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:38.680
 want a Jew to manage their international affairs.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:39.680
 And what does that really mean?

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.600
 It's not just about being Jewish.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:42.600
 It's the internationalism.

1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:44.760
 It's the cosmopolitanism.

1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:47.360
 That's one of the things I was fascinated with with Kissinger.

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:51.120
 Someone like Kissinger is unthinkable as a powerful figure in the United States 30 or

1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:54.200
 40 years earlier because the United States is run by WAST.

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:59.280
 It's run by white elites who come from a certain background.

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:03.680
 Kissinger represents a moment when American society opens up, not to everyone, but opens

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:09.280
 up to these cosmopolitan figures who have language skills, historical knowledge, networks

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:14.760
 that can be used for the US government when after World War II, we have to rebuild Europe,

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:17.320
 when we have to negotiate with the Soviet Union, when we need the kinds of knowledge

1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:19.720
 we didn't have before.

1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:23.560
 And Harvard, where he gets his education late, he started at City College actually, but

1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:27.160
 Harvard, where he gets his education late, is at the center of what's happening at all

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:31.920
 these major universities, at Harvard, at Yale, at Stanford, at the University of Texas, everywhere,

1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:36.440
 where they're growing in their international affairs, bringing in the kinds of people who

1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:42.800
 never would be at the university before, training them and then enlisting them in Cold War activities.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:46.080
 And so Kissinger is a representative of that phenomenon.

1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:49.000
 I became interested in him because I think he's a bellwether.

1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.920
 He shows how power has changed in the United States.

1:04:52.920 --> 1:05:00.200
 So he enters this whole world of politics, what post World War II, in the 50s?

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.200
 Yes.

1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:05.000
 So he actually, in the 40s even, it's an extraordinary story.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.760
 He comes to the United States in 1938, just before Kristallnacht.

1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:09.760
 His family leaves.

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:12.000
 He actually grew up right outside of Nuremberg.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:16.840
 They leave right before Kristallnacht in fall of 1938.

1:05:16.840 --> 1:05:17.840
 Come to New York.

1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:23.360
 He originally works in a brush factory cleaning brushes, goes to a public high school.

1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:27.760
 And in 1942, just after Pearl Harbor, he joins the military.

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:32.440
 And he's very quickly in the military, first of all, given citizenship, which he didn't

1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:34.480
 have before.

1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:36.760
 He's sent from the first time outside of a kosher home.

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.200
 He had been in a kosher home his entire life.

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:42.480
 He's sent to South Carolina to eat ham for Uncle Sam.

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:49.040
 And then he is, and this is extraordinary, at the age of 20, barely speaking English,

1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:54.920
 he is sent back to Germany with the U.S. Army in an elite counterintelligence role.

1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:55.920
 Why?

1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:57.800
 Because they need German speakers.

1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:00.080
 He came when he was 15, so he actually understands the society.

1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:02.720
 I mean, people have that cultural knowledge.

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:07.920
 And because he's Jewish, they can trust that he'll be anti Nazi.

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:10.280
 And there's a whole group of these figures.

1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:11.520
 He's one of many.

1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:14.000
 And so he's in an elite circle.

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.040
 He's discriminated against in New York.

1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:19.480
 When he goes to Harvard after that, he can only live in a Jewish only dorm.

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:23.040
 But at the same time, he's in an elite policy role in counterintelligence.

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:27.880
 He forms a network there that stays with him the rest of his career.

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:32.920
 There's a gentleman named Fritz Kramer, who becomes a sponsor of his in the emerging Pentagon

1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:35.120
 Defense Department world.

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:40.360
 And as early as the early 1950s, he sent them to Korea to comment on affairs in Korea.

1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:44.920
 He becomes both an intellectual recognized for his connections, but also someone who

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:46.560
 policymakers want to talk about.

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:51.960
 His book on nuclear weapons, when it's written, is given to President Eisenhower to read,

1:06:51.960 --> 1:06:54.280
 because they say, this is someone writing interesting things.

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.680
 You should read what he says.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:59.800
 There's a certain aspect to him that's kind of like Forrest Gump.

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:03.680
 He seems to continuously be the right person at the right time in the right place.

1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:04.680
 That's right.

1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:11.720
 I'm finding him in this, I don't want to, you can only get lucky so many times because

1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:18.520
 he continues to get lucky in terms of being at the right place in history for many decades

1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:19.520
 until today.

1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:20.520
 Yeah.

1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:21.520
 Well, he has a knack for that.

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:25.120
 I spent a lot of time talking with him.

1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:30.920
 And what comes through very quickly is that he has an eye for power.

1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:31.920
 It's I think unhealthy.

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:32.920
 He's obsessed with power.

1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:39.520
 Can you explain like an observer of power or does he want power himself?

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:40.520
 Yes.

1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:41.520
 Both of those things.

1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:42.520
 Both of those.

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.040
 And I think, I explained this in the book.

1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:47.120
 He doesn't agree with what I'm going to say now, but I think I'm right.

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:48.120
 And I think he's right.

1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:50.760
 It's very hard to analyze yourself, right?

1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:56.320
 I think he develops an obsession with gaining power because he sees what happens when you

1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:57.800
 have no power.

1:07:57.800 --> 1:08:00.520
 He experiences the trauma.

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:05.240
 His father is a very respected Gymnasium Lehrer in Germany.

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:12.360
 Even though he's Jewish, he's actually the teacher of German classics to the German kids.

1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:15.720
 And he's forced to flee and he becomes nothing.

1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:19.080
 His father never really makes a way for himself in the United States.

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:22.240
 He becomes a postal delivery person, which is nothing wrong with that.

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:27.240
 But for someone who's a respected teacher in Germany and Gymnasium Lehrer, like professors

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:31.320
 here, right, to then be in this position, his mother has to open and catering business

1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:33.320
 when they come to New York.

1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:35.000
 It's a typical immigrant story.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.000
 But he sees the trauma.

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.440
 His grandparents are killed by the Nazis.

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:43.240
 So he sees the trauma and he realizes how perilous it is to be without power.

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:49.280
 And you're saying he does not want to acknowledge the effect of that?

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:50.280
 It's hard.

1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:54.520
 I mean, most of us, if we've had trauma, it's believable that it's traumatic because you

1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:55.520
 don't talk about it.

1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:00.640
 We have a friend who interviews combat veterans and he says, as soon as someone freely wants

1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:05.440
 to tell me about their combat trauma, I suspect that they're not telling me the truth.

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:07.960
 If it's traumatic, it's hard to talk about.

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:08.960
 Yeah.

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:15.280
 Sometimes I wonder how much for my own life everything that I've ever done is just the

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:21.240
 result of the complicated relationship with my father.

1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:25.680
 I had a really difficult time, I did a podcast conversation with him.

1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:27.640
 I saw it actually.

1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:28.640
 It's great.

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:29.640
 I regret everything.

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:32.040
 I could never do that with my father.

1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:38.600
 But I remember as I was doing it and for months after I regretted doing it, I'm just regretting

1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:39.600
 it.

1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:44.240
 And the fact that I was regretting it spoke to the fact that I'm running away from some

1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:47.960
 truths that are back there somewhere.

1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.800
 And that's perhaps what Kissinger is as well.

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:57.360
 But is there, I mean, he's done, he's been a part of so many interesting moments of American

1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:03.800
 history, of world history from the Cold War of Vietnam War until today.

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:14.000
 What stands out to you as a particularly important moment in his career that made who he is?

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:22.080
 Well, I think what made his career in many ways was his experience in the 1950s building

1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:29.360
 a network, a network of people across the world who were rising leaders from unique

1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:30.520
 positions.

1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:36.800
 He ran what he called the International Seminar at Harvard, which was actually a summer school

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:39.480
 class that no one at Harvard cared about.

1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:46.920
 But he invited all of these rising intellectuals and thinkers from around the world.

1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:50.960
 And he built a network there that he used forevermore.

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:54.080
 So that's what really, I think, boosts him.

1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:58.320
 The most important moments in terms of making his reputation, making his career or two sets

1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:02.680
 of activities, one is the opening to China.

1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:07.600
 And his ability to, first of all, take control of US policy without the authority to do that

1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:14.640
 and direct US policy and then build a relationship with Mao Tse Dung and Joe Enlai that was unthinkable

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:16.720
 just four or five years earlier.

1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:19.040
 Of course, President Nixon is a big part of that as well.

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:22.400
 But Kissinger is the mover and shaker on that, and it's a lot of manipulation, but it's

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:23.400
 also a vision.

1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:29.320
 Now, this is in the moment of American history where there's a very powerful anti communism.

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:30.320
 Correct.

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:35.920
 So communism is seen as much more even than today as the enemy.

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:36.920
 Correct.

1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:40.840
 And in particular, they were one of our key enemies in Vietnam.

1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:44.320
 And in Korea, American forces were fighting Chinese forces directly.

1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:49.240
 Chinese forces come over the border, thousands of Americans die at the hand of Chinese forces.

1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:52.360
 So for the long time, the United States had no relationship with communist China.

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:54.640
 He opens that relationship.

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:59.720
 And at the same time, he also creates a whole new dynamic in the Middle East.

1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:05.000
 After the 1973 war, the so called Yom Kippur War, he steps in and becomes the leading negotiator

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:10.160
 between the Israelis, the Egyptians, and other major actors in the region.

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:13.720
 And it makes the United States the most powerful actor in the Middle East, the Soviet Union

1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:17.960
 far less powerful, which is great for the United States in the 70s and 80s.

1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:21.160
 It gets us though into the problems we of course have thereafter.

1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:29.040
 So that speaks to the very pragmatic approach that he's taken, the realistic approach versus

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:36.280
 the idealistic approach termed real politic, what is this thing?

1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:39.000
 What is this approach to world politics?

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:47.560
 So real politic for Kissinger is really focusing on the power centers in the world and trying

1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:51.520
 as best you can to manipulate those power centers to serve the interests of your own

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:52.720
 country.

1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.440
 And so that's why he's a multilateralist.

1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.000
 He's not a unilateralist.

1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.640
 He believes the United States should put itself at the center of negotiations between other

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:02.160
 powerful countries.

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:05.600
 But that's also why he pays very little attention to countries that are less powerful.

1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:09.120
 And this is why he's often criticized by human rights activists.

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:14.320
 For him, parts of Africa and Latin America, which you and I would consider important places

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:16.760
 are unimportant because they don't have power.

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:17.920
 They can't project their power.

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:20.680
 They don't produce a lot of economic wealth.

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:21.800
 And so they matter less.

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:27.160
 Real politic views the world in a hierarchy of power.

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:32.920
 How does real politic realize itself in the world?

1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:35.280
 What does that really mean?

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:38.040
 How do you push forward the interest of your own country?

1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:46.080
 You said there's power centers, but it is a big bold move to negotiate, to work with

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:51.600
 a communist nature with your enemies that are powerful.

1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.320
 What is sort of if you can further elaborate the philosophy behind it?

1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:59.920
 So there are two key elements that then end up producing all kinds of tactics, but the

1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:03.520
 two strategic elements of Kissinger's way of thinking about real politic, which are

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.760
 classical ways, going back to Thucydides and the Greeks, are to say, first of all, you

1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:14.920
 figure out who your allies are, and you build webs of connection so that your allies help

1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:18.400
 you to acquire what you want to acquire.

1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:21.240
 This is why, according to Herodotus, the Greeks beat the Persians.

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:25.120
 The Persians are bigger, but the Greeks, the Spartans, the Athenians are able to work together

1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:27.360
 and leverage their resources.

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:29.800
 So it's about leveraging your resources for Kissinger.

1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:32.480
 This makes Western Europe crucially important.

1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:35.120
 It makes Japan crucially important.

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:39.560
 It makes Israel and Egypt crucially important in building these webs.

1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:44.240
 You build your surrogates, you build your brother states in other parts of the world.

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.120
 You build tight connections and you work together to control the resources that you want.

1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:54.000
 The second element of the strategy is not to go to war with your adversary, but to do

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.560
 all you can to limit the power of your adversary.

1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:01.560
 Some of that is containment, preventing the Soviet Union from expanding.

1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:04.360
 That was the key element of American Cold War policy.

1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.320
 But sometimes it's actually negotiation.

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:09.040
 That's what Detant was about for Kissinger.

1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:13.000
 He spends a lot of time, more time than any other American foreign policymaker negotiating

1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.960
 with Soviet leaders, as well as Chinese leaders.

1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:16.960
 What does he want to do?

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.200
 He wants to limit the nuclear arms race.

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:21.240
 The United States is ahead.

1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:22.840
 We don't want the Soviet Union to get ahead of us.

1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.120
 We negotiate to limit their abilities.

1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:28.280
 We play to our strengths.

1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:34.000
 So it's a combination of keeping your adversary down and building tight webs.

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.200
 Within that context, military force is used, but you're not using war for the sake of war.

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:45.640
 You're using warfare to further your access to the resources, economic, political, geographic

1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:46.640
 that you want.

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:50.360
 You want to build relationships, and then the second thing to limit the powers of those

1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:51.360
 you're against.

1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:52.360
 Exactly.

1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:59.280
 Is there any insights into how he preferred to build relationships?

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:03.160
 We're talking about, again, it's the one on one.

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:06.920
 Is it through policy or is it through phone conversations?

1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:10.000
 Is there any cool insights that you could speak to?

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.520
 Yeah, Kissinger is the ultimate kiss up.

1:16:14.520 --> 1:16:20.960
 He is, some used to make fun of him, in fact, even the filmmaker from Doctor Strange Love,

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:27.400
 whose name I'm forgetting, Stanley Kubrick, called him kiss up at that time.

1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:32.360
 He had a wonderful way of figuring out what it is you wanted, back to that discussion

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:36.800
 we had before, and trying to show how he could give you more of what you wanted as a leader.

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:41.360
 It was very personalistic, very personalistic.

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:46.680
 He spends a lot of time, for example, kissing up to Leonid Brezhnev, kissing up to Mao.

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:49.960
 He tells Mao, you're the greatest leader in the history of the 20th century.

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:52.840
 People will look back on you as the great leader.

1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:55.640
 Some of this sounds like BS, but it's serious.

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:59.080
 He's feeding the egos of those around him.

1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:02.240
 Second, he is willing to get things done for you.

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:03.240
 He's effective.

1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:06.080
 You want him around you because of his efficacy.

1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:09.760
 Richard Nixon is always suspicious that Henry Kissinger is getting more of the limelight.

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.080
 He hates that Kissinger gets the Nobel Peace Prize and he doesn't, but he needs him because

1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:17.720
 Kissinger is the guy who gets things done, so he performs.

1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:21.400
 He builds a relationship in almost, I say this in the book, in almost a gangster way.

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:22.400
 He didn't like that.

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.640
 He criticized that part of the book, but again, I still think the evidence is there.

1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.000
 You need something to be done, boss.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.080
 I'll do it.

1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:32.240
 Don't forget that I'm doing this for you.

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:36.720
 You get mutual dependency in a Hegelian way.

1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:43.600
 He builds this personal dependency through ego and through performance, and then he's

1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:49.400
 so skillful at making decisions for people who are more powerful because he's never elected

1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:50.400
 to office.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:54.640
 He always needs powerful people to let him do things, but he convinces you it's your decision

1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:55.880
 when it's really his.

1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:57.800
 To read his memos are beautiful.

1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:02.360
 He's actually very skilled at writing things in a way that looks like he's giving you options

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:03.360
 as president.

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:06.960
 In fact, there's only one option there.

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:12.720
 Is he speaking to the gangster, to the loyalty?

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:20.160
 The sense I got from Nixon is Nixon would backstab you if he needed to.

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:28.880
 One of the things that I admire about gangsters is they don't backstab those in the inner circle,

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:30.560
 like loyalty above all else.

1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:37.360
 I mean, at least that's the sense I've gotten from the stories of the past, at least.

1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:38.920
 Where would you put Kissinger on that?

1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:46.440
 Is he loyalty above all else, or are humans like the Steve Jobs thing?

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:52.320
 As long as you're useful, you're useful, but then the moment you're no longer useful

1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:55.640
 is when you're knocked off the chessboard.

1:18:55.640 --> 1:18:57.120
 It's the latter with him.

1:18:57.120 --> 1:18:59.760
 He's backstabbing quite a lot.

1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:05.000
 He's self serving, but he also makes himself so useful that even though Nixon knows he's

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:09.440
 doing that, Nixon still needs him.

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:15.040
 By the way, on that point, having spoken with Kissinger, what's your relationship like with

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:21.720
 him as somebody who is in an objective way writing his story?

1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:26.800
 It was very difficult because he's very good at manipulating people.

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:33.680
 We had about 12 or 13 interviews, usually informal over lunch.

1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:37.680
 This was many years ago, but this is probably not more than 10 years ago.

1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:44.120
 Did you find yourself being sweet talked, like to where you go back home later and look

1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:46.600
 in the mirror and it's like, wait, what just happened?

1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:51.120
 He can be enormously charming and enormously obnoxious at the same time.

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:55.520
 So I would have these very mixed emotions because he gives no ground.

1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:03.760
 He's unwilling to, and I think this is a weakness, he's unwilling to admit mistake.

1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:05.240
 Others make mistakes, but he doesn't.

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:09.120
 And he certainly won't take on any of the big criticisms that are pushed.

1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:10.120
 I understand why.

1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:13.840
 I mean, when you've worked as hard for what he has as he has, you're defensive about it.

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:14.840
 But he is very defensive.

1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:15.840
 He's very fragile about it.

1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:18.040
 He does not like criticisms at all.

1:20:18.040 --> 1:20:22.080
 He used to, he hasn't done this in a while, but he used to call me up and yell at me on

1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:26.880
 the phone quite literally when I would be quoted in the New York Times or somewhere saying

1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:28.840
 something that sounded critical of him.

1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:33.480
 So for instance, there was one instance a number of years ago where a reporter came

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:38.040
 across some documents where Kissinger said negative things about Jews in Russia, typical

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:42.040
 things that a German Jew would say about East European Jews.

1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:44.800
 And the New York Times asked me, is this accurate?

1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:46.800
 And I said, yeah, the documents are accurate.

1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:47.800
 I've seen them.

1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:48.800
 They're accurate.

1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:49.800
 He was so angry about that.

1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:53.760
 So there's the fragility, but there's also the enormous charm and the enormous intelligence.

1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:57.000
 The real challenge with him though is he's very good at making his case.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.040
 He'll convince you.

1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:03.760
 And as a scholar, as an observer, you don't want to hear a lawyer's case.

1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:07.200
 You want to actually interrogate the evidence and get to the truth.

1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:09.440
 And so that was a real challenge with him.

1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:17.280
 So speaking of his approach of real politics, if we just zoom out and look at a human history,

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:25.560
 human civilization, what do you think works best in the way we progress forward?

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:32.000
 A realistic approach, do whatever it takes, control the centers of power to play a game

1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:40.240
 for the greater interests of the good guys, quote unquote, or lead by a sort of idealism,

1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:49.200
 which is like truly act in the best version of the ideas you represent, as opposed to

1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:55.360
 kind of present one view and then do whatever it takes behind the scenes.

1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:59.360
 Obviously, you need some of both, but I lean more to the idealistic side and more so, actually,

1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:04.520
 believe it or not, as I get into my 40s, as I do more historical work.

1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:05.520
 Why do I say that?

1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:09.080
 Because I think, and this is one of my criticisms of Kissinger, who I also have a lot of respect

1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:15.520
 for, the real politic becomes self defeating because you're constantly running to keep power,

1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:17.320
 but you forget why.

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:21.560
 And you often then use power, and I think Kissinger falls into this in some of his worst moments,

1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:24.520
 not all of his moments, where the power is actually being used to undermine the things

1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:25.520
 you care about.

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:29.400
 It's sort of the example of being a parent, and you're doing all these things to take

1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:33.440
 your kid to violin, basketball, all these things, and you realize you're actually killing

1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:35.760
 your kid and making your kid very unhappy.

1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:39.280
 And the whole reason you were doing it was to improve the person's life.

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:44.080
 And so you have to remember why it is, what Hans Morgenthau calls this is your purpose.

1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:45.920
 Your purpose has to drive you.

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:49.320
 Now your purpose doesn't have to be airy fairy idealism.

1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:53.320
 So I believe deeply in democracy is an ideal.

1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:58.720
 I don't think it's going to ever look like Athenian democracy, but that should drive

1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:02.920
 our policy, but we still have to be realistic and recognize we're not going to build that

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:06.320
 democracy in Afghanistan tomorrow.

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:12.560
 Does it ultimately just blow down again to the corrupting nature of power that nobody

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:21.760
 can hold power for very long before you start acting in the interest of power as opposed

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:28.880
 to in the interest of your ideals that's impossible to be like somebody like Kissinger who is

1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:37.440
 essentially in power for many, many decades and still remember what are the initial ideals

1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:40.720
 that you strove to achieve?

1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:44.680
 Yes, I think that's exactly right.

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:49.560
 There's a moment in the book I quote about him, comes from one of our interviews.

1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:54.560
 I asked him, what were the guiding ideals for your policies?

1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:57.560
 And he said, I'm not prepared to share that.

1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:00.720
 And I don't think it's because he doesn't know what he thinks he was trying to do.

1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:04.880
 He realizes his use of power departed quite a lot from.

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:10.200
 So he would sound, if he made them explicit, he would sound hypocritical.

1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:11.200
 Correct.

1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:17.240
 Well, on that, let me ask about war.

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:21.960
 America often presents itself to its own people, but just the leaders, when they look in the

1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:32.360
 mirror, I get the sense that we think of ourselves as the good guys and especially this begins

1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:39.360
 sometimes to look hypocritical when you're waging war.

1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:45.440
 What's a good, is there a good way to know when you've lost all sense of what it is to

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:48.840
 be good?

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:54.400
 Another way to ask that, is there in military policy in conducting war, is there a good

1:24:54.400 --> 1:25:00.840
 way to know what is a just war and what is a war crime?

1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:06.960
 In some circles Kissinger is accused of contributing, being a war criminal.

1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:08.400
 Yes.

1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:13.080
 And I argue in the book he's not a war criminal, but that doesn't mean that he didn't misuse

1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:15.120
 military power.

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:24.000
 I think a just war is Michael Walzer and others write about it, a just war is a war where

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:31.560
 both the purpose is just and you are using the means to get to that purpose that kill

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:33.480
 as few people as necessary.

1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:38.120
 That doesn't mean they won't be killing, but as few as necessary, proportionality.

1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:41.040
 Your means should be proportional to your ends.

1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:48.600
 And that's often lost sight of because the drive to get to the end often self justifies

1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:50.240
 means that go well beyond that.

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:55.960
 And so that's how we get into torture in the war on terror.

1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:00.400
 Is there some kind of lesson for the future that you can take away from that?

1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:01.400
 Yes.

1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:05.760
 I think the first set of lessons that I've shared as a historian with military decision

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:09.680
 makers is, first of all, always remember why you're there, what your purpose is, and always

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:13.840
 ask yourself if the means you're using are actually proportional.

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:15.320
 Ask that question.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:19.320
 Just because you have these means that you can use, just because you have these tools

1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:22.480
 doesn't mean they're the right tools to use.

1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:25.360
 And here's the question that follows from that.

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:29.440
 And it's a hard question to ask because the answer is one we often don't like to hear.

1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:34.760
 Are the things I'm doing in war actually doing more harm or more good to the reason I went

1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:36.920
 into war?

1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:40.440
 We came to a point in the war on terror where what we were doing was actually creating more

1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:43.000
 terrorists.

1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:44.920
 And that's when you have to stop.

1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.560
 Well, some of that isn't a data, but some of it there's a leap of faith.

1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:54.560
 So from a parenting perspective, let me speak as a person with no kids and a single guy.

1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:58.200
 Let me be the expert in the room on parenting.

1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:09.040
 No, it does seem that it's a very difficult thing to do even though you know that your

1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:13.160
 kid was making a mistake to let them make a mistake, to give them the freedom to make

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:15.440
 the mistake.

1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.800
 I don't know what to do, but I mean, that's a very kind of light hearted way of phrasing

1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:27.360
 the following, which is when you look at some of the places in the world like Afghanistan,

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:36.760
 which is not doing well, to move out knowing that there's going to be a lot of suffering,

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:44.080
 economic suffering, injustices, terrorist organizations growing, committing crimes on

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:50.200
 its own people and potentially committing crimes against allies, violence against allies,

1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:55.080
 violence against the United States.

1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:58.360
 How do you know what to do in that case?

1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:03.440
 Well, again, it's an art, not a science, which is what makes it hard for an engineer

1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:06.920
 to think about this is what makes it endlessly fascinating for me.

1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.920
 And I think the real intellectual work is at the level of the art, right?

1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:15.080
 And I think probably engineering at its highest level becomes an art as well, right?

1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:20.200
 So policymaking you never know, but I will say this, I'll say you have to ask yourself

1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:24.400
 and look in the mirror and say, is all the effort I'm putting in actually making this

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:25.400
 better?

1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:32.840
 And in Afghanistan, you look at the 20 years and $2 plus trillion that the US has put in.

1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:36.600
 And the fact that, as you said correctly, it's not doing well right now after 20 years

1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:42.720
 of that investment, I might like a company that I invest in, but after 20 years of my

1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:46.280
 throwing money in that company, it's time to get out.

1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:51.480
 Well, in some sense, getting out now is that's kind of obvious.

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:56.440
 I'm more interested in how we figure out in the future, how to get out earlier than,

1:28:56.440 --> 1:29:01.560
 I mean, at this point, it's, we stayed too long and it's obvious, the data, the investment,

1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:07.560
 nothing is working, you know, it's very, the very little data points to us staying there.

1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:12.560
 I'm more interested in, you know, being in a relationship, let me back, take it back

1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:16.440
 to a safer place again, being in a relationship and getting out of that relationship while

1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:20.920
 things are still good, but you have a sense that it's not going to end up in a good place.

1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:22.360
 That's the difficult thing.

1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:26.600
 You have to ask yourself, whether it's a relationship or you're talking about policymaking in a place

1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:32.600
 like Afghanistan, are the things I'm doing showing me evidence, real evidence that they're

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:35.760
 making things better or making things worse?

1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:36.760
 That's a hard question to ask.

1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:37.760
 To be honest with you.

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:38.760
 You have to be very honest.

1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:42.680
 And in a policymaking context, we have to actually do the same thing we do in a relationship

1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:43.680
 context.

1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:44.680
 What do we do in a relationship context?

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:46.600
 We ask other friends who are observing, right?

1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:48.120
 We ask for other observers.

1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:50.880
 This is actually just a scientific method element actually, right?

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:54.520
 That we can't, the Heisenberg principle, I can't see it because I'm too close to it.

1:29:54.520 --> 1:29:57.040
 I'm changing it by my looking at it, right?

1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:01.680
 I need others to tell me in a policymaking context, this is why you need to hear from

1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:06.120
 other people, not just the generals, because here's the thing about the generals.

1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:11.560
 They generally are patriotic, hardworking people, but they're too close.

1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:12.560
 They're not lying.

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:13.560
 They're too close.

1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:15.000
 They always think they can do better.

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.000
 Yeah.

1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:22.240
 How do you think about the Cold War now from the beginning to end?

1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:31.520
 And maybe also with an eye towards the current potential cyber conflict, cyber war with China

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:37.040
 and with Russia, if we look sort of other kind of Cold Wars potentially emerging in

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:43.840
 the 21st century, when you look back at the Cold War of the 20th century, how do you see

1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:46.960
 it and what lessons do we draw from it?

1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:51.360
 It's a wonderful question because I teach this to undergraduates and it's really interesting

1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:57.680
 to see how undergraduates now, almost all of whom were born after 911.

1:30:57.680 --> 1:30:59.840
 So the Cold War is ancient history to them.

1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:09.800
 In fact, the Cold War to them is as far removed as the 1950s were to me.

1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:10.800
 It's unbelievable.

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:15.000
 It's almost like World War II for my generation and Cold War and Cold War for them.

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.000
 It's so far removed.

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:19.320
 The collapse of the Soviet Union doesn't mean anything to them.

1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:23.360
 So how do you describe the Cold War to them?

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:25.760
 How do you describe the Soviet Union to them?

1:31:25.760 --> 1:31:30.800
 First of all, I have to explain to them why people were so fearful of communism.

1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:34.400
 Anti communism is very hard for them to understand.

1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:39.960
 The fact that in the 1950s, Americans believed that communists were going to infiltrate our

1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:46.520
 society and many other societies and that after Fidel Castro comes to power in 1959,

1:31:46.520 --> 1:31:50.880
 that we're going to see communist regimes all across Latin America, that fear of communism

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:57.120
 married to nuclear power and then even the fear that maybe economically they would outpace

1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:03.280
 us because they would create the sort of army of Khrushchev and builders of things.

1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:04.280
 What is Khrushchev said?

1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:09.680
 Say we're going to catch Britain in five years and then the United States after that.

1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:14.520
 To explain that sense of fear to them that they don't have of those others.

1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:15.920
 That's really important.

1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:22.040
 The Cold War was fundamentally about the United States defending a capitalist world order

1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.040
 against a serious challenger from communism.

1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:28.120
 An alternative way of organizing everything.

1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:34.240
 Private property, economic activity, enterprise, life, everything organized in a totally different

1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:35.240
 way.

1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:37.120
 It was a struggle between two systems.

1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:41.520
 Your sense is, and sorry to interrupt, but your sense is that the conflict of the Cold

1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:48.400
 War was between two ideologies and not just two big countries with nuclear weapons.

1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:52.680
 I think it was about two different ways of life or two different promoted ways of life.

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:59.240
 The Soviet Union never actually lived communism, but I think my reading of Stalin is he really

1:32:59.240 --> 1:33:03.800
 tried to go there and Khrushchev really believed Gorbachev thought he was going to reform the

1:33:03.800 --> 1:33:09.120
 Soviet Union so you would go back to a kind of Bukhar and Lenin communism.

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:10.360
 I do think that mattered.

1:33:10.360 --> 1:33:11.760
 I do think that mattered enormously.

1:33:11.760 --> 1:33:17.040
 For the United States point of view, the view was that communism and fascism were these

1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:22.880
 totalitarian threats to liberal democracy and capitalism which went hand in hand.

1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:26.880
 I do think that's what the struggle was about and in a certain way liberal capitalism proved

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:31.400
 to be the more enduring system and the United States played a key role in that.

1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:35.320
 That's the reality of the Cold War, but I think it means different things now to my

1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:38.280
 students and others.

1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:47.480
 They focus very much on the expansion of American power and the challenges of managing.

1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:52.840
 They're looking at it from the perspective of not will we survive, but did we waste our

1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:54.840
 resources on some elements of it?

1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:59.160
 It doesn't mean they were against what America did, but there is a question of the resources

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:03.160
 that went into the Cold War and the opportunity costs.

1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:06.840
 You see this when you look at the healthcare systems that other countries build and you

1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:08.880
 compare them to the United States.

1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:11.200
 Race issues also.

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:14.960
 They look at the costs, which I think often happens after a project is done.

1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:16.840
 You look back at that.

1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:24.680
 Second I think they're also more inclined to see the world as less bipolar, to see the

1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:30.760
 role of China as more complicated, post colonial or anti colonial movements, independent states

1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:32.320
 in Africa and Latin America.

1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:35.800
 That gets more attention.

1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:43.000
 One of the criticisms now is because you forget the lessons of 20th century history and the

1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:50.880
 atrocities committed under communism that you may be a little bit more willing to accept

1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:58.960
 some of those ideologies into the United States society, that forgetting that capitalistic

1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:08.040
 forces are part of the reason why we have what we have today, there's a fear amongst

1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:17.520
 some now that we would allow basically communism to take hold in America.

1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:20.640
 I mean, Jordan and others speak to this kind of idea.

1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:23.800
 I tend to not be so fearful of it.

1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:25.600
 I think it's on the surface.

1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.680
 It's not deep within.

1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:34.240
 I do see the world as very complicated as they're needing to be a role of having support

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:40.240
 for each other on certain political levels, economic levels and then also supporting entrepreneurs.

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:47.720
 It's like that the kind of enforcing of outcomes that is fundamental to the communist system

1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:50.520
 is not something we're actually close to.

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:56.520
 Some of that is just fear mongering for likes on Twitter kind of thing.

1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:00.040
 If I could come in on that because I agree with you 100%, I've spent a lot of time writing

1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:03.320
 and looking at this and talking to people about this.

1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:05.040
 There's no communism in the United States.

1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:07.840
 There never has been and there certainly isn't now.

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.160
 I'll say this both from an academic point of view but also from just spending a lot

1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:13.640
 of time observing young people in the United States.

1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:17.200
 Even those on the farthest left, take whoever you think is the farthest left, they don't

1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:18.760
 even understand what communism is.

1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:21.120
 They're not communist in any sense.

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:25.320
 Americans are raised in a vernacular and environment of private property ownership.

1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:28.760
 As you know better than anyone, if you believe in private property, you don't believe in

1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:30.760
 communism.

1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:36.760
 What the Bernie Sanders kind of socialist elements, that's very different.

1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:41.240
 I would say some of that, not all of that, some of that does harken back to actually

1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:42.800
 what won in the Cold War.

1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:46.640
 There were many social democratic elements of what the United States did that led to

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:48.120
 our winning the Cold War.

1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:55.400
 For example, the New Deal was investing government money in propping up business, in propping

1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:58.400
 up labor unions.

1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:03.800
 During the Cold War, we spent more money than we had ever spent in our history on infrastructure,

1:37:03.800 --> 1:37:10.520
 on schools, on providing social support, social security, our national pension system being

1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:12.320
 one of them.

1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:17.880
 You could argue actually that social democracy is very compatible with capitalism.

1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:20.600
 I think that's the debate we're having today, how much social democracy.

1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:25.280
 I'd also say that the capitalism we've experienced the last 20 years is different from the capitalism

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:27.080
 of the Cold War.

1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:35.320
 During the Cold War, there was the presumption in the United States that you had to pay taxes

1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:40.960
 to support our Cold War activities, that it was okay to make money, but the more money

1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:43.840
 you made, the more taxes you had to pay.

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:48.440
 We had the highest marginal tax rates in our history during the Cold War.

1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:52.800
 Now the aversion to taxes, and of course, no one ever likes paying taxes, but the notion

1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:58.120
 that we can do things on deficit spending, that's a post Cold War phenomenon.

1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:00.480
 That's not a Cold War phenomenon.

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:03.440
 So much of the capitalism that we're talking about today is not the capitalism of the Cold

1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:04.440
 War.

1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:10.680
 And maybe, again, we can learn that and see how we can reform capitalism today and get

1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:14.920
 rid of this false worry about communism in the United States.

1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:15.920
 Yeah.

1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:16.920
 You know what?

1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:17.920
 You make me actually realize something important.

1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:21.880
 What we have to remember is the words we use on the surface about different policies,

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:29.360
 what you think is right and wrong, is actually different than the core thing that is in your

1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:33.680
 blood, the core ideas that are there.

1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:45.320
 I do see the United States as this fire that burns of individual freedoms, of property

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:51.040
 rights, these basic foundational ideas that everybody just kind of takes for granted.

1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:59.440
 And I think if you hold on to them, if you're like raised in them, talking about ideas of

1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:06.680
 social security, of universal basic income, of reallocation of resources is a fundamentally

1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:10.680
 different kind of discussion that you had in the Soviet Union.

1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:17.440
 I think the value of the individual is so core to the American system that you basically

1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:25.320
 cannot possibly do the kind of atrocities that you saw in the Soviet Union.

1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:30.760
 But of course, you never know, the slippery slope has a way of changing things, but I

1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:35.480
 do believe the things you're born with is just so core to this country.

1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:40.960
 It's part of the, I don't know what your thoughts are, we are in Texas.

1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:45.440
 Not necessarily, I don't necessarily want to have a gun control type of conversation,

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:52.040
 but the reason I really like guns, it doesn't make any sense.

1:39:52.040 --> 1:40:00.480
 But philosophically, it's such a declaration of individual rights that's so different than

1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.600
 the conversations I hear with my Russian family and my Russian friends, that the gun, it's

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.240
 very possible that having guns is bad for society in the sense that it will lead to

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:11.240
 more violence.

1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:23.300
 But there's something about this discussion that proclaims the value of my freedom as

1:40:23.300 --> 1:40:24.800
 an individual.

1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:29.760
 I'm not being eloquent in it, but there's very few debates where whenever people are

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:34.480
 saying should do, would you have what level of gun control, all those kinds of things,

1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:42.560
 what I hear is it's a fight for how much freedom, even if it's stupid freedom, should

1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:43.560
 the individual have.

1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:46.680
 I think that's what's articulated quite often.

1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:51.360
 I think combining your two points, which are great points, I think there is something

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:56.800
 about American individualism, which is deeply ingrained in our culture and our society.

1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:02.120
 It means that the kinds of bad things that happen are different, usually not as bad.

1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:08.840
 But our individualism often covers up for vigilante activity and individual violence

1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:12.080
 toward people that you wouldn't have in a more collective culture.

1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:17.320
 So in the Soviet Union, it was at a much worse scale and it was done by government organizations.

1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:22.380
 In the United States, it's individuals, the history of lynching in our country, for example.

1:41:22.380 --> 1:41:25.000
 Sometimes it's individual police officers, sometimes it's others.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:28.720
 Again, the vast majority of police officers are good people and don't do harm to people.

1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:34.280
 But there are these examples and they are able to fester in our society because of our

1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:35.280
 individualism.

1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:41.320
 Now, gun ownership is about personal freedom, I think, for a lot of people.

1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.160
 There's no doubt that in our history, included in the Second Amendment, which can be interpreted

1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:49.240
 in different ways, is the presumption that people should have the right to defend themselves,

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:53.200
 which is what I think you're getting at here, that you should not be completely dependent

1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:56.880
 for your defense on an entity that might not be there for you.

1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:59.600
 You should be able to defend yourself.

1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:01.520
 And guns symbolize that.

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:08.480
 I think that's a fair point, but I think it's also a fair point to say that as with everything,

1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:10.720
 defining what self defense is is really important.

1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:13.600
 So does self defense mean I can have a bazooka?

1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:19.080
 Does it mean I can have weapons that are designed for a military battlefield to mass kill people?

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:23.880
 That seems to me to be very different from saying I should have a handgun or some small

1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:26.600
 arm to defend myself.

1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:28.760
 That distinction alone would make a huge difference.

1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:33.560
 Most of the mass shootings, at least, which are a proportion, a smaller proportion of

1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:36.400
 the larger gun deaths in the United States, which are larger than any other society, but

1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:41.360
 at least the mass shootings are usually perpetrated by people who have not self defense weapons,

1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:43.520
 but mass killing, mass killing weapons.

1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:45.720
 And I think there's an important distinction there.

1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:49.160
 The Constitution talks about a right to bear arms for a well regulated militia.

1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:53.760
 When the Framers talked about arms, that did not mean the ability to kill as many people

1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:54.760
 as you want to kill.

1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:56.520
 It meant the ability to defend yourself.

1:42:56.520 --> 1:42:57.720
 So let's have that conversation.

1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:59.720
 I think it would be useful as a society.

1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:02.200
 Stop talking about guns or no guns.

1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:05.800
 What is it that we as citizens need to feel we can defend ourselves?

1:43:05.800 --> 1:43:06.800
 Yes.

1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:07.800
 Yeah.

1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:11.040
 I mean, guns have this complicated issue that it can cause harm to others.

1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:16.080
 I tend to see maybe legalization of drugs.

1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.560
 I tend to believe that we should have the freedom to do stupid things.

1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:21.560
 Yeah.

1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:23.480
 So long as we're not harming lots of other people.

1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:24.480
 Yes.

1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:27.000
 So guns, of course, have the property that they can be used.

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.000
 It's not just a bazooka, I would argue, is pretty stupid to own for your own self defense,

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:38.680
 but it has the very negative side effect of being potentially used to harm other people.

1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:42.480
 And you have to consider that kind of stuff.

1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:47.640
 By the way, as a side note to the listeners, there's been a bunch of people saying that

1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:51.160
 Lex is way too libertarian for my taste.

1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:56.560
 No, I actually am just struggling with ideas and sometimes put on different hats in these

1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:57.560
 conversations.

1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:02.560
 I think through different ideas, whether they're left, right, or libertarian, that's true for

1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:03.560
 gun control.

1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:04.560
 That's true for immigration.

1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:05.960
 That's true for all of that.

1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:11.680
 I think we should have discussions in the space of ideas versus in the space of bins.

1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:13.920
 We put each other in labels and we put each other in.

1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:15.400
 I agree 100%.

1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:18.880
 And also change our minds all the time.

1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:25.680
 Try out, say stupid stuff with the best of intention, try our best to think through it,

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:30.520
 and then after saying it, think about it for a few days and then change your mind and grow

1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:31.520
 in this way.

1:44:31.520 --> 1:44:34.520
 Let me ask a ridiculous question.

1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:41.560
 When you zoom out, when human civilization is destroyed itself and alien graduate students

1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:47.600
 are studying it like three, four, five centuries from now, what do you think we'll remember

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:50.600
 about this period in history?

1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:59.040
 The 20th century, the 21st century, this time, we had a couple of wars, we had a charismatic

1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:06.440
 black president in the United States, we had a couple of pandemics, what do you think we'll

1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:11.520
 actually stand out in history?

1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:19.040
 No doubt the rapid technological innovation of the last 20 to 30 years, how we created

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:23.440
 a whole virtual universe we didn't have before.

1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:27.560
 And of course, that's going to go in directions you and I can't imagine 50 years from now.

1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:31.840
 But this will be seen as that origin moment that when we went from playing below the rim

1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:37.440
 to playing above the rim, right, to be all in person, to having a whole virtual world.

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:43.280
 And in a strange way, the pandemic was a provocation to move even further in that direction.

1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:46.480
 And we're never going back, right, we're going to restore some of the things we were

1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:49.320
 doing before the pandemic, but we're never going to go back to that world we were in

1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:54.680
 before, where every meeting you had to fly to that place to be in the room with the people.

1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:59.960
 So this whole virtual world and the virtual personas and the avatars and all of that,

1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:04.160
 I think that's going to be a big part of how people remember our time.

1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:10.240
 Also the sort of biotechnology element of it, which the vaccines are part of.

1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:15.040
 It's amazing how quickly, this is the great triumph, how quickly we've produced and distributed

1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:16.040
 these vaccines.

1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:20.320
 And of course, there are problems with who's taking them, but the reality is, I mean, this

1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:26.840
 is light speed compared to what it would have been like, not just in 1918, in 1980.

1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:31.080
 One of the, sorry if I'm interrupting, but one of the disappointing things about this

1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:38.520
 particular time is because vaccines, like a lot of things got politicized, used as little

1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:45.600
 pawns in the game of politics, that we don't get the chance to step back fully at least

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:49.280
 and celebrate the brilliance of the human species.

1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:50.280
 That's right.

1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:51.280
 That's right.

1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:59.800
 This is, yes, there are scientists who use their authority improperly that have an ego

1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:08.560
 that within institutions are dishonest with the public because they don't trust the intelligence

1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:09.560
 of the public.

1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:11.440
 They are not authentic and transparent.

1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:16.360
 All the same things you could say about humans in any position, the power, anywhere.

1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:22.520
 That doesn't mean science isn't incredible and the vaccines, I mean, I don't often talk

1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:31.440
 about it because it's so political and it's heartbreaking how all the good stuff is getting

1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:32.440
 politicized.

1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:33.440
 Yeah.

1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:34.440
 That's right.

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:35.440
 And it shouldn't be.

1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:36.440
 It'll seem less political.

1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:38.160
 It's in the long arc of history.

1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:39.160
 Yeah.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:44.920
 It'll be seen as an outstanding accomplishment and as a step toward whatever, maybe they're

1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:49.400
 doing vaccines or something that replaces the vaccine in 10 seconds at that point, right?

1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:50.400
 Yeah.

1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:51.400
 It'll be seen as a step.

1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:52.400
 It'll be seen as positive.

1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:57.240
 I think one of the negatives they will point to will be our inability, at least at this

1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:03.040
 moment, to manage our environment better, how we're destroying our living space and

1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:06.520
 not doing enough, even though we have the capabilities to do more to preserve or at

1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:09.280
 least allow a sustainable living space.

1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:13.880
 I'm confident because I'm an optimist that we will get through this and we will be better

1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:16.840
 at sustaining our environment in future decades.

1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:22.520
 And so in terms of environmental policy, they'll see this moment as a dark age or the beginnings

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:26.360
 of a better age, maybe as a renaissance.

1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:33.240
 Or maybe as the last time most people lived on earth when a couple of centuries afterwards

1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:37.400
 we were all dissipated throughout the solar system and the galaxy.

1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:38.400
 Very possible.

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:45.560
 If the local resident, hometown resident, Mr. Elon Musk has anything to do with it.

1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:51.160
 I do tend to think you're absolutely right with all this political bickering.

1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:56.160
 We shouldn't forget that what this age will be remembered by is the incredible levels

1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:57.320
 of innovation.

1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:03.640
 I do think the biotech stuff worries me more than anything because it feels like there's

1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:06.920
 a lot of weapons that could be yet to be developed in that space.

1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:11.840
 But I tend to believe that I'm excited by two avenues.

1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:19.520
 One is artificial intelligence, the kind of systems we'll create in this digital space

1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:21.240
 that you mentioned we're moving to.

1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:25.480
 And then the other, of course, this could be the product of the Cold War, but I'm super

1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:27.160
 excited by space exploration.

1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:28.160
 Sure.

1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:30.480
 There's a magic to humans being...

1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:31.480
 And we're getting back to it.

1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:35.880
 I mean, we were enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s when it was a Cold War competition.

1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:38.420
 And then after the 70s, we sort of gave up on it.

1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:42.120
 And thanks to Elon Musk and others, we're coming back to this issue.

1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:47.720
 And I think there's so much to be gained from the power of exploration.

1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:52.800
 Is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that had a big impact on you?

1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:53.800
 Yes.

1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:54.800
 Is it something you were...

1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:55.800
 Yes.

1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:58.760
 You know, my favorite novel, I always tell people this.

1:49:58.760 --> 1:49:59.760
 I love reading novels.

1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:04.080
 I'm a historian, and I think the historian and the novelist are actually...

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:06.920
 And the technology innovator are all actually one and the same.

1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:07.920
 We're all...

1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:08.920
 Storytellers.

1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:09.920
 Storytellers.

1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:11.840
 And we're all in the imagination space.

1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:16.880
 And I'm trying to imagine the world of the past to inform us in the present for the future.

1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:20.680
 So one of my favorite novels that I read, actually when I was in graduate school, is

1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:23.480
 Thomas Mann's, Buddenbrooks.

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:28.840
 And it's the story of a family in Lübeck in Northern Germany living through the 19th

1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:31.880
 century and the rise and fall of families, cycles of life.

1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:34.720
 Many things we've talked about in the last couple of hours.

1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:39.760
 cycles of life, challenges of adjusting to the world around you.

1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:45.280
 And it's just a very moving reflection on the limits of human agency and how we all

1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:49.320
 have to understand the circumstances we're in and adjust to them.

1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:51.720
 And there's triumph and tragedy in that.

1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:52.720
 It's a wonderful novel.

1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:54.280
 It used to be a kind of canonical work.

1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:55.640
 It's sort of fallen out now.

1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:59.200
 It's a big, big novel, but I'm very moved by that.

1:50:59.200 --> 1:51:01.000
 I'm very moved by Tolstoy's War and Peace.

1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.160
 I assign that every year to my students.

1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:05.020
 It's a big, big book.

1:51:05.020 --> 1:51:11.280
 But what Tolstoy challenges is he challenges the notion that a Napoleon can rule the world.

1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:12.800
 And we're all little Napoleons, right?

1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:15.480
 We're all sort of thinking that we're going to do that.

1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:18.200
 And he reminds us how much is contingency, circumstance.

1:51:18.200 --> 1:51:21.160
 It doesn't mean we don't have some control.

1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:23.800
 You've spoke to me a little bit of Russian.

1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:24.800
 Where does that come from?

1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:28.960
 So your, your appreciation of Tolstoy, but also your ability to speak a bit of Russian.

1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:30.200
 Where's that from?

1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:32.000
 So I speak, in addition to English.

1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:39.360
 I speak reasonably well, depending on how much vodka I've had Russian, French and German.

1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:42.960
 I learned those for research purposes.

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:46.240
 I learned French actually when I was in high school, Russian when I was in college, German

1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:47.840
 when I was in graduate school.

1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:53.040
 Now I do have family on my mother's side that's of Russian Jewish extraction, but they were

1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:56.600
 Yiddish speakers by the time, you know, I met them by the time they had gone through Germany

1:51:56.600 --> 1:51:59.120
 and come to the United States or really gone through Poland and come to the United States.

1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:00.120
 They were Yiddish speakers.

1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:03.800
 So there's no one really in my family who speaks Russian, but I do feel a connection

1:52:03.800 --> 1:52:07.360
 there, at least a long range personal connection.

1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:13.120
 Is there something to be said about the language and your ability to imagine history?

1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:19.520
 Sort of when you study these different countries, your ability to imagine what it was like to

1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:24.560
 be a part of that culture, a part of that time?

1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:25.560
 Yes.

1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:27.920
 Language is crucial to understanding a culture.

1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:32.600
 And even if you learn the languages I have, you're learning Russian and German and French,

1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:36.480
 it's still not the same as also being a native speaker either, as you know.

1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:42.920
 But I think language tells you a lot about mannerism, about assumptions, the very fact

1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:49.120
 that English doesn't have a formal U, but Russian has a formal U, right, V, versus

1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:50.120
 T, right?

1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:53.320
 German has a formal U, Z, versus D, right?

1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:59.200
 So the fact that English doesn't have a formal U tells you something about Americans, right?

1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:01.120
 And that's just one example.

1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:10.040
 The fact that Germans have such a wider vocabulary for certain scientific concepts than we have

1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:12.640
 in English tells you something about the culture, right?

1:53:12.640 --> 1:53:15.040
 Language is an artifact of the culture.

1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:16.480
 The culture makes the language.

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:17.480
 It's fascinating to explore.

1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:26.800
 I mean, even just exactly what you just said, V, T, which is there's a fascinating transition.

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:30.000
 So I guess in English, we just have U.

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:39.000
 There's a fascinating transition that persists to this day of formalism and politeness, where

1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:47.280
 it's an initial kind of dance of interaction that's different methods of signaling respect.

1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:48.280
 I guess.

1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:54.760
 The language provides that in the English language, there's fewer tools to show that

1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:59.760
 kind of respect, which has potentially positive or negative effects on it flattens the society

1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:06.720
 where a teenager could talk to an older person and show a difference.

1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:12.960
 But at the same time, it creates a certain kind of dynamic, a certain kind of society.

1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:17.840
 And it's funny to think of just those few words can have a ripple effect through the

1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:18.840
 whole culture.

1:54:18.840 --> 1:54:23.040
 And we don't have a history in the United States of aristocracy.

1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:26.280
 These elements of language reflect aristocracy.

1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:30.560
 The serf would never refer to the master, even if the master is younger, as the, it's always

1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:31.560
 the way, right?

1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:36.920
 And again, if it's always the way, I mean, and so it tells you something about the history.

1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:41.240
 That's why to your question, which was a great question, it's so crucial to try to penetrate

1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:42.240
 the language.

1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:45.760
 I also say something else, and this is a problem for many Americans who haven't learned a foreign

1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:46.760
 language.

1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:48.360
 We're very bad at teaching foreign languages.

1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:53.280
 If you've never taught yourself a foreign language, you have closed yourself off to

1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:58.000
 certain kinds of empathy, because you have basically trained your brain to only look

1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.720
 at the world one way.

1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:06.760
 The very act of learning another language, I think tells your brain that words and concepts

1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:08.000
 don't translate one to one.

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:09.360
 This is the first thing you realize, right?

1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:12.600
 We can say, you know, these two words mean the same thing from two languages.

1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:15.280
 They never mean exactly the same thing.

1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:19.440
 Dosvedanya is really not goodbye, right?

1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:23.200
 And there's something, you know, right now there's people talking about idea of lived

1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:24.200
 experience.

1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:29.560
 One of the ways to force yourself into this idea of lived experiences by learning another

1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:34.160
 language is to understand that you can perceive the world in a totally different way, even

1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:36.040
 though you're perceiving the same thing.

1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:40.760
 And of course, the way to first learn Russian for those looking for tutorial lessons for

1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:44.720
 me is just like you said, you start by drinking lots of vodka.

1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:45.720
 Yes, of course.

1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:48.120
 It's very difficult to do otherwise.

1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:55.160
 Is there advice you have for young people about career, about life, in making their

1:55:55.160 --> 1:55:56.960
 way in the world?

1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:57.960
 Yes.

1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:04.200
 The two things I believe that I say to a lot of talented young people, first, I don't

1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:09.200
 think you can predict what is going to be well renumerated 20 years from now.

1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:12.720
 Don't pick a profession because you think, even though your parents might tell you or

1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:17.080
 do this and you'll make money, you know, there's the scene in the graduate where a guy tells

1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:20.400
 Dustin Hoffman, go into plastics, money in plastics.

1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:21.400
 We don't know.

1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:25.480
 So many of my students now have parents who are telling them, bright students, you know,

1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:26.680
 go to the business school.

1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:29.400
 That's what's going to set you up to make money.

1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:31.200
 If you're passionate about business, yes.

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:35.600
 But don't begin by thinking you know what's going to be hot 20 years from now.

1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:39.040
 You don't know what's going to be hot from 20 years ago, 20 years from now.

1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:40.040
 What should you do?

1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:43.360
 This is advice number one, find what you're passionate about.

1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:47.560
 Because if you're passionate about it, you will do good work in that area if you're talented

1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:51.680
 and usually passionate talent overlap and you'll find a way to get people to pay you

1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:52.680
 for it.

1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:54.080
 I mean, you do it really well.

1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:55.080
 People will want to pay you.

1:56:55.080 --> 1:56:56.360
 That's where capitalism works.

1:56:56.360 --> 1:56:58.040
 People will find it valuable, right?

1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:04.080
 Whether it's violin playing or engineering or poetry, you might not become a billionaire.

1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:07.560
 That involves other things, but you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it.

1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:13.680
 And then the second thing is it's really important at the very beginning of your career, even

1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:18.440
 before you're in your job to start building your networks.

1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.920
 But networks are not just people you're on Facebook with or Twitter with.

1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:24.800
 I mean, that's fine.

1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:26.840
 It's actually forming relationships.

1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:30.360
 And some of that can be mediated in the digital world, but I mean real relationships.

1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:33.720
 I like podcasts because I think they actually open up that space.

1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:37.960
 I know a lot of people can listen to a podcast and find someone else who's listened to that

1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:40.480
 podcast and have a conversation about a topic.

1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:42.600
 It opens up that space.

1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:46.240
 Build those relationships not with people who you think will be powerful, but people

1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:50.720
 you think are interesting because they'll do interesting things.

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:56.640
 And every successful person I know at some level had a key moment where they got where

1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:01.280
 they are because of someone they knew for some other reason who had that connection.

1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:05.440
 So use and spread your networks and make them as diverse as possible.

1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:09.840
 Find people who are of a different party, have different interests, but are interesting

1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:11.960
 to you.

1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:12.960
 That's brilliant advice.

1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:23.720
 On the passion side, I do find that as somebody who has a lot of passions, I find the second

1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:32.240
 part to that is committing, which sucks because life is finite.

1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:38.400
 And when you commit, you say, well, I'm never going to be good.

1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:42.520
 When you choose one of your two passions, one of the two things you're interested in,

1:58:42.520 --> 1:58:45.320
 you're basically saying, I'm letting go.

1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:47.720
 I'm saying, that's you're done you.

1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:48.720
 That's true.

1:58:48.720 --> 1:58:49.720
 That's true.

1:58:49.720 --> 1:58:50.720
 Which is actually what does with done your means.

1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:51.720
 Not goodbye, but letting go.

1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:52.720
 That's exactly right.

1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:53.720
 I think that's exactly right.

1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:55.280
 I think you do have to make choices.

1:58:55.280 --> 1:58:56.760
 You do have to set priorities.

1:58:56.760 --> 1:59:00.600
 I often laugh at students who tell me they want to have like three majors.

1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:02.240
 If you have three majors, you have no major, right?

1:59:02.240 --> 1:59:04.640
 I mean, so I do think you have to make choices.

1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:12.760
 I also think it's important that whatever you do, even if it's a small thing, you always

1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:13.800
 do the best you can.

1:59:13.800 --> 1:59:15.560
 You always do excellent work.

1:59:15.560 --> 1:59:19.600
 My kids are tired of hearing me say this at home, but I believe everything you do should

1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:21.240
 be about excellence.

1:59:21.240 --> 1:59:22.480
 The best you can do.

1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:25.360
 If I'm going to wash the dishes, I'm going to be the best person washing the dishes.

1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:26.360
 Yeah.

1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:27.360
 Right?

1:59:27.360 --> 1:59:29.680
 If I'm going to write a book review, I'm going to write the best possible book review

1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:30.680
 I can.

1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:31.680
 Why?

1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:35.120
 Because you develop a culture about yourself, which is about excellence.

1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:36.120
 Yeah.

1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:40.680
 I was telling you offline about all the kind of stuff, Google Fiber and cable installation,

1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:41.680
 all that stuff.

1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:45.600
 I've been always a believer washing dishes.

1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:47.760
 People don't often believe me when I say this.

1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:50.720
 I don't care what I do.

1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:52.480
 I am with David Foster Wallace.

1:59:52.480 --> 1:59:54.040
 I'm unboreable.

1:59:54.040 --> 1:59:58.720
 There's so much joy for me, I think for everyone, but okay, let me just speak for me, to be

1:59:58.720 --> 2:00:02.360
 discovered in getting really good at anything.

2:00:02.360 --> 2:00:12.880
 In fact, getting good at stuff that most people believe is boring or menial labor or impossible

2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:17.960
 to be interesting, that's even more joyful to find the joy within that and the excellence.

2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:22.920
 Just the Girodreams of sushi making the same freaking sushi over and over and becoming

2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:25.760
 a master of that, that can be truly joyful.

2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:29.440
 There's a sense of pride on the pragmatic level.

2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:33.080
 You never know when someone will spot that.

2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:36.640
 Intelligent people who perform at the level of high excellence look for others.

2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:37.640
 Yeah.

2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:38.640
 Who do you say?

2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:39.640
 And it radiates some kind of signal.

2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:40.640
 It's weird.

2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:47.360
 It's weird what you attract to yourself when you just focus on mastery and pursuing excellence

2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:49.280
 in something.

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:51.960
 This is the cool thing about it.

2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:53.920
 That's the joy I've really truly experienced.

2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:55.080
 I didn't have to do much work.

2:00:55.080 --> 2:00:59.560
 It's just cool people, I find myself in groups of cool people.

2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:03.240
 Really people who are excited about life, who are passionate about life, there's a fire

2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:09.120
 in their eyes that at the end of the day just makes life fun.

2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:13.840
 And then also money wise, at least in this society, we're fortunate to where if you do

2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:16.640
 that kind of thing, money will find a way.

2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:22.600
 I have the great, I say this that I don't care about money, but I have to think about

2:01:22.600 --> 2:01:26.560
 what that means because some people criticize that idea as like, yeah, that must be nice

2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:32.320
 to say that because I have for many periods of my life had very little money.

2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:37.380
 But I think we're living in a society where not caring about money, but just focusing

2:01:37.380 --> 2:01:39.080
 on your passions.

2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:42.640
 If you're truly pursuing excellence, whatever that is, money will find you.

2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:44.800
 That's I guess the ideal of the capitalist system.

2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:48.400
 And I think that the entrepreneurs I've studied and had the chance to get to know, and I'm

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:53.520
 sure you'd agree with this, they do what they do because they're passionate about the product.

2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:55.040
 They're not just in it to make money.

2:01:55.040 --> 2:01:59.680
 In fact, that's when they get into trouble when they're just trying to make money.

2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:00.880
 Exactly.

2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:04.440
 You said your grandmother, Emily, had a big impact on your life.

2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:08.440
 She lived to 102.

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:11.800
 What are some lessons she taught you?

2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:18.360
 Emily, who was the child of immigrants from Russia and Poland, who never went to college,

2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:27.520
 her proudest day I think was when I went to college, she treated everyone with respect

2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:28.600
 and tried to get to know everyone.

2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:31.080
 She knew every bus driver in the town.

2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:33.560
 She'd remember their birthdays.

2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:39.320
 And one of the things she taught me is no matter how high you fly, the lowest person close

2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:45.400
 to the ground matters to you and you treat them the same way you treat the billionaire

2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:47.280
 at the top of the podium.

2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:48.280
 And she did that.

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:49.720
 She didn't just say that.

2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:51.280
 Some people say that and don't do it.

2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:52.280
 She really did that.

2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:58.920
 And I always remember that it comes up in my mind at least once a week because we're all

2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:04.600
 busy doing a lot of things and you either see or you even feel in yourself the desire

2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:10.920
 to just for the reasons of speed to be short or not polite with someone who can't do anything

2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:13.480
 to harm you right now.

2:03:13.480 --> 2:03:18.640
 And I remember her saying to me, no, you treat everyone with respect.

2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:22.520
 You treat the person you're on the phone with, right, customer service.

2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:27.920
 You treat that person if you're talking to Jeff Bezos or you're talking to Elon Musk.

2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:32.520
 And I think making that a culture of who you are so important and people notice that.

2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:33.520
 That's the other thing.

2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:35.080
 And they notice when it's authentic.

2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:38.200
 Everyone's nice to the person at the bottom or the totem pole when you want to get ahead

2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:40.480
 in the line for your driver's license.

2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:42.520
 But are you nice to them when you don't need that?

2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:43.520
 They notice that.

2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:49.400
 And even when nobody's watching, that has a weird effect on you that's going to have

2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:52.640
 a ripple effect and people know, that's the cool thing about the internet.

2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:55.320
 I've come to believe that people see authenticity.

2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:57.520
 They see when you're full of shit, when you're not.

2:03:57.520 --> 2:03:58.520
 That's right.

2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:01.360
 The other thing that Emily taught me, and I think we've all had relatives who have taught

2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:04.080
 us this, right, that you could be very uneducated.

2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:05.080
 She was very uneducated.

2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:11.000
 She had a high school diploma, but I think she was working in a delicatessen in New York

2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.520
 while she was in high school, or maybe it was at Gimbal's or somebody.

2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:14.840
 So she probably didn't take high school very seriously.

2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:15.840
 She wasn't very well educated.

2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:17.640
 She was very smart.

2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:22.480
 And we can fall into a world where I'm a big believer in higher education and getting a

2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:29.680
 PhD and things of that sort, but where we think those are the only smart people.

2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:33.160
 Sometimes those are the people because of their accomplishments, because of their egos

2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:42.360
 are the ones who are least educated in the way of the world, least curious, and ultimately

2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:45.000
 wisdom comes from curiosity.

2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:54.440
 And sometimes getting a PhD can get in the way of curiosity as opposed to in power curiosity.

2:04:54.440 --> 2:05:01.160
 Let me ask, from a historical perspective, you've studied some of human history.

2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:05.280
 So maybe you have an insight about what's the meaning of life?

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:10.240
 Do you ever ask when you look at history, the why?

2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:14.080
 Yeah, I do all the time, and I don't have an answer.

2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:16.440
 It's the mystery that we can't answer.

2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:22.120
 I do think what it means is what we make of it.

2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:23.960
 There's no universal.

2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:26.800
 Every period I've studied, and I've studied a little bit of a lot of periods and a lot

2:05:26.800 --> 2:05:30.320
 of a few periods, every period people struggle with this, and there's no, they don't come

2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:37.360
 to wiser people than us don't come to a firm answer, except it's what you make of it.

2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:38.480
 Meaning is what you make of it.

2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:44.880
 So think about what you want to care about and make that the meaning in your life.

2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:50.680
 I wonder how that changes throughout human history, whether there's a constant.

2:05:50.680 --> 2:05:57.120
 I often think, especially when you study evolutionary biology and you just see our origins from

2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:04.200
 life and as it evolves, it's like, it makes you wonder, it feels like there's a thread

2:06:04.200 --> 2:06:11.200
 that connects all of it that we're headed somewhere.

2:06:11.200 --> 2:06:20.400
 We're trying to actualize some greater purpose, there seems to be a direction to this thing.

2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:25.960
 We're all kind of stumbling in the dark trying to figure it out, but it feels like we eventually

2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:28.400
 will find an answer.

2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:29.400
 I hope so.

2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:30.400
 Yeah, maybe.

2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:38.120
 I mean, I do think we all want our families to do better.

2:06:38.120 --> 2:06:41.360
 We are familial, and family doesn't just mean biological family.

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:47.560
 You can have all kinds of ways you define family and community, and I think we are moving slowly

2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:53.120
 and in a very messy way toward a larger world community.

2:06:53.120 --> 2:07:01.080
 To include all of biological life and eventually artificial life as well.

2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:08.600
 So to expand the lesson to the advice that your grandmother taught you is I think we

2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:15.680
 should treat robots and AI systems good as well, even if they're currently not very intelligent,

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:17.040
 because one day they might be.

2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:22.960
 Right, I think that's exactly right, and we should think through exactly as a humanist

2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:24.640
 how I would approach that issue.

2:07:24.640 --> 2:07:29.680
 We need to think through the kinds of behavior patterns we want to establish with these new

2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:35.960
 forms of life, artificial life, for ourselves also to your point.

2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:39.840
 So we behave the right way, so we don't misuse this.

2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:44.560
 We started talking about Abraham Lincoln, ended talking about robots.

2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:48.920
 I think this is the perfect conversation, Jeremy, this was a huge honor.

2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:55.040
 I love Austin, I love UT Austin, and I love the fact that you would agree to waste all

2:07:55.040 --> 2:07:56.760
 your valuable time with me today.

2:07:56.760 --> 2:07:57.760
 Thank you so much for talking today.

2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:00.480
 I can't imagine a better way to spend a Friday afternoon.

2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:04.160
 This was so much fun, and I'm such a fan of your podcast, and delighted to be a part

2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:05.160
 of it.

2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:06.160
 Thank you.

2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:11.040
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jeremy Surrey, and thank you to Element,

2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:15.960
 MonkPak, Bell Campo, FourSigmatic, and EightSleep.

2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:19.360
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:25.480
 And now, let me leave you some words from Franklin D. Roosevelt, FDR.

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:30.400
 Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose

2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:31.600
 wisely.

2:08:31.600 --> 2:08:36.160
 The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.

2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:44.960
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
