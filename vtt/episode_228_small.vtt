 The following is a conversation with RZA, the rapper,

00:04.200 --> 00:07.840
 record producer, filmmaker, actor, writer, philosopher,

00:07.840 --> 00:10.680
 Kung Fu scholar, and the mastermind

00:10.680 --> 00:14.880
 of the legendary hip hop group Wu Tang Clan.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.280
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:19.280 --> 00:20.480
 in the description.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.640
 And now, here's my conversation with RZA.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.160
 In the Tao of Wu, you write,

00:27.160 --> 00:29.440
 when my mother left the physical world,

00:29.440 --> 00:32.480
 I lost one of my main links to the universe.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.200
 They say that you have an umbilical cord

00:35.200 --> 00:36.960
 and an aetheric cord,

00:36.960 --> 00:40.080
 which is the invisible cord that attaches you to your soul,

00:40.080 --> 00:43.200
 your mother's soul, and all other souls.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.440
 When one passes away, you really lose something.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.280
 It's physical and mental.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.480
 It's real.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.640
 Part of you dies.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.880
 What have you learned about life from your mother?

00:54.880 --> 00:57.800
 I mean, I learned life itself from my mother.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.800
 You know, being one of 11 children

01:03.800 --> 01:08.800
 and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us,

01:09.240 --> 01:11.280
 therefore given to life,

01:12.280 --> 01:14.480
 it's really the greatest lesson of life.

01:15.640 --> 01:20.480
 The thing that shook me as I wrote those words

01:21.480 --> 01:22.320
 was,

01:22.320 --> 01:26.000
 was coming up young

01:27.440 --> 01:32.440
 with arrogance, confidence, knowledge of myself.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.800
 They called me the sciences.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.080
 We was taught, you're the supreme being.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.480
 In order to be the supreme being,

01:41.480 --> 01:44.520
 you gotta be supreme amongst other beings.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.920
 I understand that more now than I did then,

01:49.920 --> 01:52.920
 because then it was so literal.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.040
 You know, the word God derived basically

01:57.040 --> 01:58.640
 from the Greek language, as they say,

01:58.640 --> 02:01.680
 and it meant wisdom, strength, and beauty.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.920
 And yeah, we could have that.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.520
 But the power to control life and death

02:09.520 --> 02:14.000
 is something that you would assume is a God trait.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
 So now here you are saying that you're a God, right?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.400
 And you're reading the Bible,

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
 how Jesus brought back glass of us.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.400
 And you know, now here's your turn to do something.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.400
 And when my mother was laying there in the hospital bed

02:31.400 --> 02:33.600
 and it was no longer coming out of her lungs

02:33.600 --> 02:35.000
 and going into her lungs,

02:36.400 --> 02:38.800
 where's my power to bring her back to life?

02:38.800 --> 02:42.800
 So you can't truly be God, you're powerless.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.800
 Yeah, or God is not the definition

02:45.800 --> 02:47.800
 that we need to use to describe it

02:48.800 --> 02:51.800
 because it's a translation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
 So you could be that.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.800
 But so I'm answering your question

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
 whether my mother teach me about life.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.800
 I learned that day on her physical passing,

03:00.800 --> 03:01.800
 that okay.

03:01.800 --> 03:07.800
 You know what I mean, there's a physical me.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.800
 Do you think about her, you miss her?

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
 Of course.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.800
 I keep my mother in my prayer every day.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
 And the thing I pray the most

03:21.800 --> 03:25.800
 beyond giving thanks is I pray that her name

03:26.800 --> 03:28.800
 is honored and remembered by my family.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.800
 I don't know if the world's gonna remember that, right?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
 Even though if you watch my movie, Love, Beach, Rhymes,

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
 I named the school in that movie after my mother

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
 just to leave it somewhere else.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.800
 Yeah, in physical space.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.800
 Yeah, exactly.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
 But yeah, painful.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.800
 The pain of my mother's passing is indescribable.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.800
 Only until it happens to a person they know

03:53.800 --> 03:55.800
 and then they won't describe it either.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
 Only the people that lost their mother,

03:57.800 --> 03:59.800
 they could look at each other and they got this nod.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
 You know what I mean?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.800
 But one other thing happened to me

04:04.800 --> 04:07.800
 was the joy of life hit me differently.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.800
 And I think it was the realization

04:12.800 --> 04:18.800
 of my own mortality versus my immortality.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.800
 It's a big, big thing.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.800
 And I don't know if we'll get to expound on that,

04:23.800 --> 04:25.800
 but there was a joy that overcame me

04:25.800 --> 04:28.800
 because I was kind of free of a certain illusion

04:29.800 --> 04:33.800
 about the immortality of my physical being

04:34.800 --> 04:37.800
 versus the mortality of my physical being.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.800
 And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.800
 So that was the first or the hardest realization

04:44.800 --> 04:46.800
 you've experienced that you're mortal?

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
 Yeah, that, yeah.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.800
 And I'll say mortal and what you're looking at here physically,

04:53.800 --> 04:56.800
 I won't say my soul is mortal, right?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.800
 I'll say it's immortal because at the end of the day,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
 it's just like I could sit here

05:03.800 --> 05:06.800
 and I could just hum, please, please, please,

05:06.800 --> 05:07.800
 by James Brown.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.800
 But James Brown is not going to come in here and do that.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.800
 So in some sense, James Brown is still here

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
 in another sense.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.800
 He's gone.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.800
 He's sold us here.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
 Sold us here.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
 Well, it lives through.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
 It lives through you by you singing it.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.800
 It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.800
 And the hope is that the human species continues

05:31.800 --> 05:35.800
 to celebrate the great minds and the great creations of the past.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.800
 I would add this to that equation.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.800
 When I say it's immortal,

05:43.800 --> 05:47.800
 I don't think it's not just only because somebody sings it, right?

05:47.800 --> 05:50.800
 It's like, where's the fire at right now?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.800
 It's in the air.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.800
 You just got to spark the spark.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.800
 Yeah.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.800
 So it's always there.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
 Are you afraid of death?

06:02.800 --> 06:04.800
 No, I'm not afraid of death.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.800
 I'm not trying to see it.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.800
 I'm not watching that nowhere near me, right?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.800
 Because all I know is life, right?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.800
 My life is living.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.800
 You know, I read a lot of ancient texts.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.800
 People probably know about me and I love one of the great teachers

06:19.800 --> 06:21.800
 named Bodhidharma.

06:22.800 --> 06:28.800
 And there was a thing written in one of the books of his

06:28.800 --> 06:30.800
 or one of the teachings of his.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.800
 And somebody asked him a similar question.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.800
 You know, are you scared of death or what are you going to be after you die?

06:38.800 --> 06:40.800
 And his answer was, I don't know.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.800
 He had answers to everything.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
 But he's like, I don't know.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.800
 That's all.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
 He doesn't know that.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
 So yeah, because I haven't died yet.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
 Yeah.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.800
 Well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.800
 Not knowing what's on the other side of the door.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.800
 Yeah.

06:55.800 --> 07:02.800
 I mean, especially when you're young, you know, as a kid, fear permeated my life.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
 You know what I mean?

07:03.800 --> 07:08.800
 You know, I was actually watching horror movies and I believed in all type of

07:08.800 --> 07:11.800
 supernatural things that could or can't happen.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.800
 I thought I saw things as well.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.800
 And, you know, whether it was being projected from my own mind or whether

07:17.800 --> 07:19.800
 it was there visible to me, I don't know.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.800
 But life is beautiful.

07:25.800 --> 07:31.800
 And we have it and we should use it all the way to the last drop.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.800
 Realizing the mortality, the gift your mother gave to you is realizing the

07:36.800 --> 07:41.800
 immortal and in so doing, hope you realize that life is beautiful.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
 Yeah.

07:43.800 --> 07:49.800
 On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you, when it rains, get wet.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
 What do these words mean to you?

07:54.800 --> 07:59.800
 Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was, you know, I think I was

07:59.800 --> 08:07.800
 more conservative, like as a person and like, you know, had money, women wanted me.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.800
 Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.800
 You know what I mean?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
 And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet.

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
 Enjoy this, man.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.800
 It's raining on you.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
 You know what I mean?

08:20.800 --> 08:21.800
 Don't put up the umbrella.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
 Don't go back in the house.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.800
 Yeah.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.800
 Get wet.

08:25.800 --> 08:26.800
 Experience the moment.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
 Yeah.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.800
 And enjoy it.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.800
 And I didn't take total heed to him at that time.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.800
 A couple of years later, I took some heed.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.800
 But at that time, I didn't take heed.

08:37.800 --> 08:46.800
 And when I took heed, I think that I may have misinterpreted by looking at his

08:46.800 --> 08:50.800
 example of getting wet versus my example of getting wet.

08:50.800 --> 08:55.800
 And I can tell you right now, I'm getting wet right now in my way.

08:55.800 --> 09:00.800
 In part, thanks to your mother, but overall, you just learned how to appreciate

09:00.800 --> 09:03.800
 the rain, just like the experience of every moment.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
 Yeah.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.800
 And I'll share this with you, because this is going to be a very open conversation.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.800
 And I haven't had this conversation.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.800
 So definitely in part to my mother, then in part to my wife.

09:14.800 --> 09:21.800
 I meet my wife, it's my second wife, but I met her after my mother passed.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.800
 And she was just a friend, you know, some girls.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.800
 I met her because she was beautiful and actually built a friendship with her.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.800
 But a few years later, when the relationship became like, you know, this is going to be

09:36.800 --> 09:37.800
 my woman.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.800
 It was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.800
 And I was like, you know, do I run wild?

09:44.800 --> 09:47.800
 And hey, you know, me and my wife already filed.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.800
 We were separated.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.800
 And do I run wild?

09:50.800 --> 09:54.800
 And I didn't run wild a little bit, but not too wild, right?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.800
 And, you know, I'm still a man.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.800
 I'm a hip hop guy.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
 I read you know how to party.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
 Yeah, exactly.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.800
 But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Telani.

10:07.800 --> 10:14.800
 My uncle said she reminds me of your mother.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.800
 He knew my mother when, before I knew my mother.

10:18.800 --> 10:30.800
 And he saw that and we ended up dating, got engaged, and then her mother passes.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.800
 And so now there's a total understanding of everything.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.800
 And we actually help build each other back up.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.800
 So, of course, I have to thank my mother for the awareness.

10:42.800 --> 10:49.800
 Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness to actualization,

10:49.800 --> 10:54.800
 like to actually feel, I don't think I'll be talking to you right now

10:54.800 --> 10:58.800
 and talking as much as I do these days if it wasn't for the security

10:58.800 --> 11:04.800
 and peace and harmony that I was able to gain at home, you know?

11:04.800 --> 11:11.800
 And like you said, you now share that look of having both lost your mom.

11:11.800 --> 11:17.800
 What have you learned from Quincy about music, about business, about life?

11:17.800 --> 11:25.800
 Quincy Jones is a great mind, a great artist, you know, a treasure in all reality.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.800
 He's seen it from when it was, he couldn't walk in this,

11:29.800 --> 11:32.800
 he couldn't eat in the same place as he played his music at

11:32.800 --> 11:35.800
 to owning places bigger than ours.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.800
 So what a beautiful life, you know?

11:37.800 --> 11:43.800
 He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him,

11:43.800 --> 11:47.800
 you got a lifetime of information.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.800
 And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him and days with him.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.800
 And, you know, there's a certain period of time where we came across each other

11:54.800 --> 11:58.800
 and he was always there to share the knowledge.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.800
 Like, that's another thing about him that I think is special.

12:01.800 --> 12:08.800
 And hopefully I picked that up is that he's always willing to share,

12:08.800 --> 12:11.800
 share with his experience, his knowledge.

12:11.800 --> 12:17.800
 I mean, I think he'll even share his home to the right person

12:17.800 --> 12:20.800
 if he feels that that's what they need to get back on that field.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.800
 He's a very beautiful man.

12:22.800 --> 12:28.800
 So just the kindness, the goodness of the man is like the thing that really rubbed off on you?

12:28.800 --> 12:34.800
 Yeah, I mean, minimum. I mean, Quincy Jones also in his fifties

12:34.800 --> 12:39.800
 as a producer produced one of the greatest albums of all time

12:39.800 --> 12:41.800
 and one of the greatest selling albums of all time.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.800
 I just great critically, economically great.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.800
 And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now

12:49.800 --> 12:54.800
 so I might have a great year coming up.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.800
 Time and well, yeah.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.800
 So now you got a taste of what greatness is.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.800
 You get to see what greatness is.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.800
 So you know what you have to do.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.800
 Exactly, how to survive for yourself, yeah.

13:05.800 --> 13:11.800
 You've had a few people you've worked with who are fascinating like yourself, Quentin Tarantino.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
 You worked with him.

13:12.800 --> 13:17.800
 When somebody asked you to describe him with one word, you said encyclopedia.

13:17.800 --> 13:21.800
 What have you learned from the guy about filmmaking and about life again?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.800
 A very generous man with his knowledge.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.800
 And for me, he shared it.

13:26.800 --> 13:33.800
 I think in a way that was unique in a sense of, you know, at a point in time, you know,

13:33.800 --> 13:38.800
 we just was super duper tight, like, you know, like I'm going to his crib and watching movies

13:38.800 --> 13:43.800
 and just having long conversations about art and about life.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.800
 You know what I mean?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.800
 So I learned a lot.

13:47.800 --> 13:52.800
 I consider him, you know, especially when it comes to anything cinematic in my life,

13:52.800 --> 13:55.800
 I consider him the godfather of that for me.

13:55.800 --> 14:03.800
 I think, you know, I humbly asked him to mentor me, which is a very humbling thing to do,

14:03.800 --> 14:10.800
 coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am, coming from, I was already a multi platinum artist.

14:10.800 --> 14:15.800
 You know, I mean, it was a year, it was past the year 2000 already.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.800
 So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.800
 So I was the result already, you know what I mean?

14:23.800 --> 14:33.800
 But I humbled myself because I saw in him a craft of brainpower that to me resonated with me,

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
 but I was just a pattern on that.

14:35.800 --> 14:41.800
 I was a novice at it because I was trying to make movies in my music, you know,

14:41.800 --> 14:48.800
 trying to make videos and here was a man who was a master of it and an encyclopedia of it as well.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
 Like film history.

14:50.800 --> 14:57.800
 Film history from whether it's the actor, the director, the cinematographer, maybe even the costume designer.

14:57.800 --> 15:02.800
 He may know 50, 60, he may know the 50 greatest costume designers in his memory.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.800
 I mean, it's God's brain.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.800
 Both of you have pretty good memory.

15:07.800 --> 15:13.800
 I'd love to be a fly in the wall of that conversation and kung fu movies mostly.

15:13.800 --> 15:20.800
 We actually started, I think we started our relationship trying to outdo each other.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.800
 Knowledge wise or what?

15:22.800 --> 15:26.800
 Yeah, movie knowledge wise, actually kung fu movie knowledge wise.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.800
 And I think that cat, if it wasn't another category, I wouldn't have had a chance.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.800
 But at least in that category, I was pretty holding my weight.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.800
 For one.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
 You know what?

15:36.800 --> 15:42.800
 I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few he didn't see.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.800
 But Quinn is older than me.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.800
 So he could go back further.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.800
 Yeah, he could go back to 72 when I didn't see one yet, you know what I mean?

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
 Yeah.

15:52.800 --> 15:59.800
 He said master of the flying gay team that I got a chance to, that you commentate over today and I got a chance to see the screening of.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
 He said that's one of his favorites.

16:02.800 --> 16:09.800
 For you, the 36th chamber of Shaolin, the master killer is your favorite.

16:09.800 --> 16:15.800
 Best ever, would you say that's the greatest kung fu movie ever?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
 It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?

16:17.800 --> 16:22.800
 Because somebody may make another one and it depends on your own phase of life.

16:22.800 --> 16:27.800
 But I will put that first.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.800
 If I want to introduce somebody to kung fu movies, that's a beautiful entry.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.800
 You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.800
 What kind of wisdom do you draw from kung fu movies?

16:38.800 --> 16:41.800
 You know what, the martial art itself and the movies.

16:41.800 --> 16:46.800
 It's endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know?

16:46.800 --> 16:52.800
 I draw it in a way, you know, that I could decipher it in my own life.

16:52.800 --> 17:07.800
 So, for instance, in the movie master killer, he basically, when he does kung fu, he does really a style called the hunger technique.

17:07.800 --> 17:16.800
 And the director of the movie is actually a hunger expert who has a lineage that traces all the way back to Shaolin Temple.

17:16.800 --> 17:22.800
 And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure and to bring hunger to the world.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.800
 It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage.

17:25.800 --> 17:30.800
 In fact, you just said master of the flying gullotine is Quentin's favorite movie.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.800
 And we mentioned in 36 chambers, it's my favorite movie.

17:32.800 --> 17:39.800
 But the action director of master of flying gullotine is the director of 36 chambers of Shaolin.

17:39.800 --> 17:52.800
 And some of the things that's happening in master of the flying gullotine is really the infant stage of what this action director is going to learn and then use later on in his movies.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
 So that's the beauty of it.

17:54.800 --> 18:02.800
 It's almost like, you know, Quentin is seeing him in his generation, so Quentin might have been the same age I was watching that movie.

18:02.800 --> 18:07.800
 And then when he becomes a director, I'm at Quentin's age and I'm seeing his work.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.800
 So some symbiont relationship there.

18:09.800 --> 18:23.800
 And I'll end this question by saying, hunger deals with the five animal technique, the tiger, the crane, the leopard, the snake, and the dragon.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.800
 Those are the five.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
 That's the five pattern.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.800
 Some people go seven, some go 12, but it's a stick to the five pattern fist.

18:29.800 --> 18:35.800
 How do a man emulate a tiger?

18:35.800 --> 18:39.800
 And you see a tiger's fist.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.800
 He curls before he spawns on you.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.800
 How does a man emulate a snake?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.800
 It doesn't have to be only in the kung fu move.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.800
 It's in the ideology of the snake.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.800
 It's in the agility of the crane at any moment.

18:58.800 --> 19:06.800
 Sometimes punching a person is not going to work, as they would say in leopard fist or tiger paw.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.800
 So sometimes you may have to poke them in the eye with the crane's beak.

19:11.800 --> 19:25.800
 So having your mind able to adapt the instinct of the animal when you are being attacked or when you are being the aggressor, that's something that you don't need to form for.

19:25.800 --> 19:26.800
 That's the mentality.

19:26.800 --> 19:35.800
 So kung fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly because at first I was trying to learn how to hold my, like, I can't really hit you with that and really hurt you.

19:35.800 --> 19:42.800
 I've been banging my hand a thousand times on some bricks and made it so callous or muscles are so strong.

19:42.800 --> 19:56.800
 But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight and I'm going to tiger up on you and take that instinct and prance when I'm a prance or fly away like the stalk.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.800
 You know what I mean?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.800
 That's the mentality.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
 It's much more than technical moves.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.800
 It's much deeper.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
 Yeah, it's interesting.

20:06.800 --> 20:14.800
 I mean, when I see the kung fu movies, because I love martial arts, all martial arts and competitive ones too, like the actual competitions and so on.

20:14.800 --> 20:19.800
 It just seems like kung fu movies go much deeper than just like the techniques.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.800
 They strike.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.800
 I mean, if you see it, right?

20:22.800 --> 20:33.800
 Even I watched a great MMA fight recently, you know, just interesting because he was on top of the guy, you know, and the way he got from Undam.

20:33.800 --> 20:41.800
 You know, it had to be, you know, a spirit guy from Undam.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.800
 It's some like mixture of crane and whatever.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
 Snake.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
 Ill.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.800
 The slippery ill technique.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.800
 Yeah.

20:49.800 --> 20:57.800
 No, I love that when people become artists in the cage or they, that's much bigger than just like winning much bigger than particular techniques.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.800
 It's just art, especially at the highest level competition where millions of people are watching.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.800
 Which is pressure within itself.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.800
 Yes.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.800
 Yes.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.800
 That's art under pressure is even more beautiful art.

21:09.800 --> 21:15.800
 You know, you look at some of these fights and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.

21:15.800 --> 21:20.800
 And sometimes the less talented guy could win because he could deal with the pressure.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.800
 But the other guy, he could have beat them.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.800
 There was someone else, but not in this arena.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.800
 So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.800
 You've, I've listened to so many of your interviews.

21:34.800 --> 21:43.800
 You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.800
 Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.800
 What made them special in the history of music?

21:49.800 --> 21:51.800
 That's a good question.

21:51.800 --> 21:58.800
 So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it, but I'll just speak my piece on it.

21:58.800 --> 22:04.800
 And maybe I could just add on because I'm sure it's a lot of people that spent a lot of time with them that could speak on it.

22:04.800 --> 22:18.800
 But just as a fellow artist, I think not only was B.I.G. a dope lyricist, I think he had a voice that was really immaculate.

22:18.800 --> 22:29.800
 In the sense that some rappers get on top of music and you got to get used to them when you got to vibe with them.

22:29.800 --> 22:36.800
 But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.800
 If you go back and listen to his music, you could take his voice and put it on anything.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.800
 And for some reason, it sounds like a record.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.800
 You mean just like the raw voice of the man?

22:49.800 --> 22:53.800
 You could just listen to it raw and it sounds like a record.

22:53.800 --> 23:01.800
 But if you put a beat, take his voice and put it on any beat, he just has a voice.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
 It's immaculate.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.800
 So it's lyrical skills and all that was great.

23:06.800 --> 23:14.800
 And you got to think once again, he's doing all this, he's not even 25 years old.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.800
 Then you go to Park once again, immaculate voice.

23:18.800 --> 23:27.800
 But what Park had, I think, was a way of touching us on all of our emotions.

23:27.800 --> 23:36.800
 And especially on like Park had the power to infuse your emotional thought like Brenda has a baby, their mama.

23:36.800 --> 23:42.800
 But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.

23:42.800 --> 23:55.800
 And those two things, actually, he was probably more dangerous than Big, Notorious B.I.G.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.800
 Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him to this day.

23:59.800 --> 24:07.800
 But Park was probably going to a point, he was more going into the Malcolm X of things.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.800
 And society fears that.

24:11.800 --> 24:18.800
 Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love and at starting revolutions.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.800
 Yeah.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
 And that's dangerous.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.800
 Very dangerous.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.800
 And they communicated love, but he wasn't starting revolutions.

24:26.800 --> 24:32.800
 Well, it's interesting to think about what the world would be like if they were still with us.

24:32.800 --> 24:39.800
 But it's the way the world, Hendricks, a lot of those guys just go too soon.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.800
 Yeah, it's a peculiar thing.

24:41.800 --> 24:46.800
 Now, you asked me earlier, am I scared of death?

24:46.800 --> 24:49.800
 And I asked you, no, I'm not scared of death.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.800
 I mean, I'm not trying to see it though.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.800
 It's like that was the block of death.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.800
 It's like, I'm not really going right there right now.

24:57.800 --> 25:04.800
 I'm making a left or right turn, unless it was mandatory for some greatness, greater good.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.800
 It's like, okay, I got to drive through that.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.800
 Yeah, but it can still happen.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.800
 That's the meditation on death part where you could die at the end of today.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.800
 Yeah, you could die.

25:15.800 --> 25:20.800
 Well, dying in death, I think it's two different things, personally.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.800
 The process, immune of death?

25:22.800 --> 25:24.800
 Yeah, I mean, you could die.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.800
 You could die every day.

25:26.800 --> 25:32.800
 You could die and not be yourself, which is crazy.

25:32.800 --> 25:37.800
 But to get to a point of no return, that's a whole other chamber.

25:37.800 --> 25:45.800
 I mean, there's some sense in which Riza, the producer, becomes somebody else completely

25:45.800 --> 25:48.800
 when you're making a film, becomes somebody else completely.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.800
 When you're, I don't know, playing chess, becomes completely something different

25:53.800 --> 25:58.800
 when you do kung fu or watch kung fu or when you're a family man.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.800
 All of those are little deaths when you transition from one place to another.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.800
 So it's not like you're one being, you're many things.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.800
 Yeah, I would describe that as all life, though.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.800
 Hey, that's fun.

26:12.800 --> 26:21.800
 Outside of you and anybody on Wu Tang, who's the greatest rapper from a lyric,

26:21.800 --> 26:26.800
 like a Wortsmith perspective in hip hop history or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?

26:26.800 --> 26:28.800
 There's name of few.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.800
 And you're going to have to start with Rock Kim.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.800
 You're going to have to pick Kujirap in there.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
 You know what I mean?

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
 So going back.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.800
 You're going to have to pick up with those brothers first.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.800
 You might have to, if you want a good technical, you might have to start with Grandmaster Cass.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
 You know what I mean?

26:44.800 --> 26:46.800
 Who you might not have even heard of.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
 You know what I mean?

26:47.800 --> 26:51.800
 But you may have sung his lyrics every time you sang Sugar Hill Rappers Delight.

26:51.800 --> 26:52.800
 Because that's his.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.800
 That was it.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.800
 They copied his and they made it theirs.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.800
 But point being made, but I'll name a couple more.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.800
 I got to put Nas in that category.

27:04.800 --> 27:09.800
 You know, we got a chessboard in front of us and one of the greatest chess players,

27:09.800 --> 27:20.800
 the youngest Grandmaster, you know, before I think Carlson was Bobby Fisher.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.800
 So he just used Bobby Fisher as American, one of the greatest American chess players.

27:24.800 --> 27:29.800
 Of course, Susan Polka may have tied his record as the youngest Grandmaster.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.800
 And she's the youngest female Grandmaster, I think, to date.

27:32.800 --> 27:36.800
 But he was a master at what, 14?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
 Yeah, something like that.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.800
 Right?

27:39.800 --> 27:44.800
 So now, to me, I met Nas when he was 15.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
 He was already a master lyricist.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.800
 It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.

27:49.800 --> 27:55.800
 By the time the world heard of Wu Tang, most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.800
 So that's why you met us at mastery level.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.800
 The juzzer was already a master when Nas was a master, but juzzer was 21.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.800
 Nas was 15.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.800
 Nas is like the Mozart of rap.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.800
 Yeah, on a Bobby Fisher.

28:10.800 --> 28:15.800
 Just a Bobby Fisher, just born something in him or maybe those early years.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.800
 Because he's not just good at the lyrics.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.800
 He goes deep with it, just like you.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
 So he's like, there's depth.

28:24.800 --> 28:30.800
 It's not just mastery of the words smithing.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.800
 It's just the message you actually get sent across.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.800
 And some information into a small phrase.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.800
 That's the whole thing of energy.

28:41.800 --> 28:48.800
 How do we condense all that energy into this so that it could fuel that?

28:48.800 --> 28:53.800
 And he's definitely one of those artist MCs that does that.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
 And he was doing it at 15.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.800
 Like I said, I'm thinking five years or four or five years older than Nas.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.800
 So I was always feeling my confidence of what I was doing.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.800
 But I was like, this kid is only 15.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.800
 I gotta step up my game.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.800
 When he turned 19, then we got Illumatic.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.800
 Yeah.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.800
 From you, what are the best and most memorable lyrics you've ever written?

29:19.800 --> 29:23.800
 Well, that's a hard question for me.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.800
 The stuff stand out?

29:24.800 --> 29:28.800
 Like stuff you're really proud of that was like, important in your career?

29:28.800 --> 29:34.800
 Yeah, I mean, I think I did a song called Sunshower.

29:34.800 --> 29:40.800
 I don't know if we put it on the Wu Tank Forever double CD, but only on the international version.

29:40.800 --> 29:46.800
 But if anybody could go get those lyrics and write those lyrics down, you could just put that in your pocket.

29:46.800 --> 29:51.800
 And I'm sure it'll answer at least about 25% of your life's problems.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
 Well, that's a good one.

29:53.800 --> 29:57.800
 Sunshine, where you talk about religion and God, that's good.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.800
 Timo, I think it's on A diagram.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.800
 I'm not a record guy.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.800
 I'm a song guy.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.800
 Do you have a lyric from it?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.800
 Yeah, the answer to all questions.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.800
 You're talking about God.

30:10.800 --> 30:15.800
 The spark of all suggestions, of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection,

30:15.800 --> 30:18.800
 who gives you all and never asks more of you.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.800
 The faithful companion that fights every war with you.

30:21.800 --> 30:28.800
 Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical, he's the all in all you searching for the oracle.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.800
 This is so good.

30:31.800 --> 30:37.800
 Our mission impossible is purely philosophical, but you can call on your deathbed when you're laying in the hospital.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.800
 You will call them on your deathbed.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.800
 I have a scientist friend.

30:42.800 --> 30:48.800
 Well, my wife's best friend, Rebecca, she married a scientist.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.800
 They're both scientists. They're both scientists, and she married Dr. Neal.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.800
 I ain't gonna say their last names.

30:55.800 --> 31:00.800
 But Neal and Rebecca, you know, they're my wife's best friends, so they come over.

31:00.800 --> 31:06.800
 And me and Neal, we go through the longest debates of science and religion.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.800
 We just go. We could go break day with it.

31:09.800 --> 31:17.800
 And, you know, before he had a child, he was more adamant.

31:17.800 --> 31:22.800
 And, you know, there's, you know, I don't believe in God, you know what I mean?

31:22.800 --> 31:26.800
 After a child, he still kept his thing, but I just hit him with the question.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.800
 If you was about to die, because now you got a child thing about, right?

31:30.800 --> 31:32.800
 It's different when you're thinking about yourself.

31:32.800 --> 31:36.800
 If you was about to die, you don't think you're going to make that call.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.800
 He's like, I'll make that call.

31:39.800 --> 31:44.800
 And it kind of inspired my lyric because it was like, yeah, who you gonna?

31:44.800 --> 31:47.800
 And I just want to say, so you mentioned lyric.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.800
 That is one of my favorite lyrics, but that's part two.

31:50.800 --> 31:56.800
 To Sunshower was the prequel to Sunshine.

31:56.800 --> 32:03.800
 So if you ever get a chance to check out Sunshower, start off with Trouble Follows a Wicked Mind.

32:03.800 --> 32:10.800
 2020 vision of the prism of life, but still blind because you lack the inner.

32:10.800 --> 32:15.800
 So every sinner could end up in the everlasting winter of Hellfire.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.800
 With thorns and splinters, prick your eye out.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.800
 Your words fly out, but you remain unheard.

32:23.800 --> 32:30.800
 Suffering internal and external, along with the wicked fraternal of generals and colonels,

32:30.800 --> 32:36.800
 letting off thermal nuclear heat that burns you firmly and permanently upon the journey

32:36.800 --> 32:38.800
 through the Journal of the Book of Life.

32:38.800 --> 32:43.800
 For those who took a life without justice will become just ice.

32:43.800 --> 32:51.800
 It's been taught your worst enemy couldn't harm you as much as your own wicked thoughts.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.800
 But people ought to be nought and listen wrought.

32:54.800 --> 32:59.800
 So they find themselves persecuted inside their own universal court.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.800
 So that is a long one.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.800
 It's like a free pager.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.800
 Wow, that is about life.

33:04.800 --> 33:09.800
 That's like character, integrity, how to be in this world.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.800
 And that ultimately connects to God.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.800
 Who's God to you?

33:14.800 --> 33:16.800
 I'm glad you just asked that question.

33:16.800 --> 33:22.800
 Because I actually, I'm going to have to make a distinguishable separation here.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.800
 All right.

33:24.800 --> 33:33.800
 And it's funny because I heard recently, I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian,

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
 Dr. Ben.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.800
 I can't pronounce Dr. Ben name, but there was a debate.

33:37.800 --> 33:43.800
 And then the debate, they started going back through the etymology.

33:43.800 --> 33:48.800
 They went way back beyond antiquity because they was debating.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.800
 So there was, you know, some things, they was going deep.

33:51.800 --> 33:57.800
 And they really went far, far back to kind of the first word of God.

33:57.800 --> 34:03.800
 And it was, when they pronounced it on this particular debate, it was Allah.

34:03.800 --> 34:07.800
 And they said for that, they got Elohim.

34:07.800 --> 34:17.800
 I've already agreed in my heart in my life that the father of this universe, proper name is Allah.

34:17.800 --> 34:21.800
 And of course, in Allah, I get all.

34:21.800 --> 34:22.800
 You know?

34:22.800 --> 34:28.800
 And I don't think that God is the same as that.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.800
 I think Allah gives birth to God.

34:32.800 --> 34:39.800
 In fact, if you take the word Allah, A L L A H, and you take it through numerology or numbers,

34:39.800 --> 34:43.800
 the number A being letter A being 1, L being 12.

34:43.800 --> 34:49.800
 And you add it all up to its lowest, to, you know, the last denominator.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.800
 You're going to get the number seven.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.800
 And the number seven is going to bring you right back to that letter G.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.800
 So Allah borns God, but God don't born Allah.

34:58.800 --> 35:07.800
 How does that God, how does Allah connect to the oracle that you're going to be calling for when you're laying in the hospital?

35:07.800 --> 35:11.800
 Well, what I was saying in that particular verse was that we're looking for the oracle.

35:11.800 --> 35:17.800
 We're looking for somebody else or something to help us that nobody can really help you at the end of the day.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.800
 You know?

35:18.800 --> 35:23.800
 And we're speaking on, so now that we, I don't want to say we're speaking on religion,

35:23.800 --> 35:28.800
 but we're speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.800
 And I've read many books, of course.

35:31.800 --> 35:39.800
 And I could say there's no book that my, the book that is the most strongest book I've ever read is actually the Holy Quran.

35:39.800 --> 35:48.800
 It's stronger to me than the Bible, which I read is stronger than quantum physics, which I've read is stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.

35:48.800 --> 35:55.800
 And I read once a British scholar said it's the most stupidest book ever written.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.800
 And it doesn't make sense.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.800
 And so I said, I see why he says that.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.800
 I can understand exactly why he said that as well.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.800
 Why is that?

36:05.800 --> 36:12.800
 Because the structure of the words are just, it's peculiar.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.800
 You know what I mean?

36:13.800 --> 36:19.800
 But it's almost like how some people's songs, you don't really know exactly what they say until years later.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
 Yeah.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
 Yeah.

36:22.800 --> 36:29.800
 You have, actually with Joe Rogan, I think you talked about how a joke of Dave Chappelle hit you like a long time after.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
 So this is kind of like the Quran.

36:31.800 --> 36:41.800
 I tend to believe that we, human beings cannot possibly understand anything as big as these ideas.

36:41.800 --> 36:50.800
 So just, I don't know, did you think that, like, are you humble in the face of just the immensity of it?

36:50.800 --> 37:03.800
 To be honest, Jess, I'm humble in the face of the, you can say the word again, I pronounce words funny, the omnipotence, the omnessence, the magnitude.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.800
 I'm humble in the face of Allah.

37:06.800 --> 37:15.800
 The problem that I may have had was that I wasn't humble in the face of God because it's just a definable thing.

37:15.800 --> 37:21.800
 And that's why I think a lot of us, and I'm saying that, you know, I know when we say God, we're trying to say Allah.

37:21.800 --> 37:30.800
 Like people were saying that, but you're actually not saying the same thing because you're actually putting something beside Him.

37:30.800 --> 37:36.800
 And that's the reason why you can have as many gods.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.800
 You can find a whole bunch of them.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
 You know what I mean?

37:40.800 --> 37:41.800
 But you're not going to find many.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.800
 There's no body beside Allah.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.800
 Allah is one.

37:45.800 --> 37:49.800
 So I know it's a whole thing, but that's my heart is there.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
 I'm humbled by it.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.800
 I'm at peace with it.

37:53.800 --> 37:58.800
 And it doesn't take nothing or demerit anything from myself.

37:58.800 --> 37:59.800
 That's the beauty of it.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.800
 It doesn't take nothing from me, from being who with Him.

38:02.800 --> 38:09.800
 So if I say, if somebody woke up your peace guard, I could take that because they're telling me that, yall, I'm a man of wisdom.

38:09.800 --> 38:10.800
 I'm a man of strength.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.800
 I'm a man of beauty or some attribute of that.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
 You know what I mean?

38:15.800 --> 38:17.800
 So Wu Tang, they the gods of rap.

38:17.800 --> 38:18.800
 There's wisdom there.

38:18.800 --> 38:19.800
 There's strength there.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.800
 There's beauty there.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.800
 We'll take that.

38:21.800 --> 38:28.800
 So Wu Tang is one of the greatest musical, artistic, philosophical groups ever.

38:28.800 --> 38:34.800
 Let's look hundreds of years from now when humans or robots or aliens or whatever that's left here, they look back.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.800
 What do you hope they remember about Wu Tang?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.800
 What do you hope the legacy is?

38:39.800 --> 38:44.800
 Well, I, well, even if it's thousands of years, I hope we don't give it to the humans.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.800
 But you know, look, whatever happens is going to happen.

38:47.800 --> 38:57.800
 But I think that my philosophy on it is that we're going to continue to advance.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.800
 And continue to advance things around us.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.800
 But I don't see us becoming extinct.

39:03.800 --> 39:10.800
 Well, I mean, the reason I bring up sort of Wu Tang in that context, and this is a special moment in human history.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.800
 It's like a hundred years and we've created all of this music.

39:13.800 --> 39:20.800
 Just if you think of all the richness of music that's been created over a hundred years, it's like, it's not obvious to me that that's not going to stop.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.800
 Right.

39:21.800 --> 39:22.800
 Like there's a flourishing here.

39:22.800 --> 39:28.800
 So it's funny because I could see where the book of human history is written.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.800
 There's a chapter on this period of time.

39:30.800 --> 39:31.800
 Right.

39:31.800 --> 39:39.800
 And one of the things we did well is like all the technological innovation with like, with the rockets and with the internet.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.800
 But then there's also the musical innovation and film innovation.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
 Right.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.800
 Just so much art that's being created.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
 And Wu Tang is a huge part of that.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.800
 So I just wonder what, like if there's a few sentences written about Wu Tang.

39:51.800 --> 39:56.800
 It just makes me wonder how they remember.

39:56.800 --> 40:06.800
 I would hope that people, no matter how many years are inspired by us, but I will say if I could just use Wu Tang as itself.

40:06.800 --> 40:16.800
 So we first started off the witty, unpredictable talent and natural game, right?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.800
 Natural gaming and natural wordplay.

40:18.800 --> 40:37.800
 And then we went to the wisdom of the universe, the truth of a law for a nation of God, wisdom, universal, truth, a law, nation, God.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.800
 And it's just like, so let's just go back to a nation of God.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.800
 Let's just take the last two letters.

40:43.800 --> 40:48.800
 A nation of wisdom, strength and beauty.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
 Right.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.800
 You know, and I'm going to go a little political here, but not going political.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.800
 As we'll say, we're the greatest country in the world.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.800
 What makes us the greatest?

40:57.800 --> 40:59.800
 That should be a question we act.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.800
 Is it our wisdom?

41:00.800 --> 41:02.800
 Is it our strength?

41:02.800 --> 41:04.800
 Is it our beauty?

41:04.800 --> 41:08.800
 Now let's just say, off the easiest answer, you know, it's our strength.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
 We got the nukes.

41:10.800 --> 41:16.800
 Nobody can really, you know, between America and Russia, you know, that's the argument.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.800
 Who could beat them?

41:18.800 --> 41:20.800
 But where's the wisdom?

41:20.800 --> 41:23.800
 Then they can argue, well, we got the technology.

41:23.800 --> 41:28.800
 All right, but then where's the beauty when there's so much suffering in the people?

41:28.800 --> 41:36.800
 I mean, the hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents and the imperfect, but why is founding the documents?

41:36.800 --> 41:45.800
 Of that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas, sort of having a lot of nukes, having a lot of airplanes and tanks.

41:45.800 --> 41:49.800
 That's not, that's not, that's not important.

41:49.800 --> 41:57.800
 And the hope is whatever we're doing here with this, quote, greatest country on earth that we preserve the ideas and help them flourish.

41:57.800 --> 41:58.800
 Yeah.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.800
 Well, that's what I mean.

41:59.800 --> 42:04.800
 So we could get, so if you go back to the Wu Tang, I'm saying that's what we're striving for.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.800
 We're striving for that.

42:06.800 --> 42:15.800
 But you started on predictable and just like, yeah, but like, got deep pretty quick.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.800
 I got to talk to you about Bruce Lee.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.800
 Who's Bruce Lee to you?

42:20.800 --> 42:21.800
 Who is he to the world?

42:21.800 --> 42:24.800
 What ideas of his were interesting to you?

42:24.800 --> 42:30.800
 Like what, you know, you talk about like Hendricks and music, Bruce Lee is that in martial arts.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.800
 He just seems to have changed the game.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.800
 Yeah.

42:34.800 --> 42:44.800
 You know, I went as, I guess, I don't know if the word bold is the right word to say, but I went as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.

42:44.800 --> 42:51.800
 And I got that concept from the Holy Quran where it says that we send prophets to every nation, every village.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.800
 We don't let nobody not hear the word in some form.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
 Because it won't be fair.

42:56.800 --> 43:02.800
 And so if a law is merciful, even a man who's deaf has to somehow get a sign.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.800
 I don't know if Moses saw a burning bush.

43:05.800 --> 43:06.800
 There was nobody else to talk to.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.800
 So they had to talk to the bush.

43:07.800 --> 43:08.800
 I don't know.

43:08.800 --> 43:09.800
 It could have been a bush.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.800
 That's right.

43:10.800 --> 43:14.800
 But point being made, it says that they are minor prophets.

43:14.800 --> 43:25.800
 And I see Bruce Lee as one of them because what he brought to the world through martial art was a whole shift in the dynamic of thinking.

43:25.800 --> 43:35.800
 You know, and that happens when certain certain entities are born, but he didn't do it only in a physical sense.

43:35.800 --> 43:39.800
 He was also philosophizing in the same process.

43:39.800 --> 43:45.800
 And he was also striving to be the best of himself.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.800
 So you got three things going on.

43:47.800 --> 43:52.800
 I studied Bruce Lee multiple times.

43:52.800 --> 44:01.800
 And first, of course, when I saw my first Kung Fu movie, it was the fake.

44:01.800 --> 44:02.800
 It wasn't really Bruce Lee.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.800
 It was a few green horny clips cut together.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
 And then I saw Black Samurai.

44:08.800 --> 44:16.800
 Then my following Kung Fu movies was like Fearless Fighters, The Ghostly Face, you know, the Fist of Double Kid.

44:16.800 --> 44:23.800
 But basically in Fearless Fighters, the lady put the little kid on her back and flew across the ocean, across the lake.

44:23.800 --> 44:24.800
 Right?

44:24.800 --> 44:26.800
 So Bruce wasn't doing that.

44:26.800 --> 44:34.800
 And then I went on to five deadly Venoms and Spearman and 36 Chambers and these movies are beautiful.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.800
 And yet they're all heightened.

44:38.800 --> 44:42.800
 Bruce, they're heightened beyond doable.

44:42.800 --> 44:43.800
 You're not going to.

44:43.800 --> 44:47.800
 Like surreal, they play with the world that's not of this world.

44:47.800 --> 44:48.800
 Yeah.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.800
 Bruce played with this world.

44:50.800 --> 44:57.800
 So when I first saw Bruce, I honestly didn't think he was as good as these guys.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.800
 He can't fly.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.800
 He's not flying in the movies, right?

45:02.800 --> 45:10.800
 But then when I saw, the first one I saw was The Big Boss, which they retitled Fist of Fury.

45:10.800 --> 45:18.800
 But then when I saw Chinese Connection, which is The Real Fist of Fury, right?

45:18.800 --> 45:20.800
 I saw something different there.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.800
 And I got enamored.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.800
 And then of course, Into the Dragon, right?

45:25.800 --> 45:27.800
 Just really complete.

45:27.800 --> 45:32.800
 That's why my first album was Into the Wu Tang, 36 Chambers of Shaolin.

45:32.800 --> 45:37.800
 So it's Into the Dragon and 36 Put Together because those are the two epitomies.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.800
 So what happened is, you know, that's young me.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.800
 Then teenage me, studies him again.

45:42.800 --> 45:46.800
 And I realized, wow, look at, look at his physicality.

45:46.800 --> 45:50.800
 Look how he's really, he's moving for real.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.800
 And then I studied him again.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.800
 Wow, look at what he's saying.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.800
 Then I studied him again.

45:55.800 --> 45:59.800
 Wow, look at what he stands for.

45:59.800 --> 46:05.800
 Which do you like in the realm of martial arts, the real or the surreal?

46:05.800 --> 46:07.800
 Or the dance between the two?

46:07.800 --> 46:15.800
 Yeah, I like the dance between the two because a movie, I mean, a movie to me is to entertain you.

46:15.800 --> 46:25.800
 So I'm cool with Obi Wan Kenobi disappearing out of the cloak when Vader strikes him down.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.800
 And then I'm like, yo, what happened?

46:27.800 --> 46:29.800
 And he's like, run, Luke, run.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.800
 I'm cool with that, right?

46:31.800 --> 46:33.800
 Because that's the imagination.

46:33.800 --> 46:39.800
 And the imagination gets stimulated to the point to where as things that we saw imagined by an artist,

46:39.800 --> 46:41.800
 we strive to create in our real world.

46:41.800 --> 46:46.800
 Thus, Star Trek to me is just a precursor to our cell phones.

46:46.800 --> 46:50.800
 So for me, I like the mixture too.

46:50.800 --> 46:56.800
 Yeah, it's funny how the science fiction, like pushing into the impossible actually makes it realize eventually.

46:56.800 --> 47:01.800
 Yeah, we humans, like, once we see an idea on screen, no matter how wild it is, we...

47:01.800 --> 47:02.800
 We're trying to make it.

47:02.800 --> 47:03.800
 Yeah, we're trying to make it.

47:03.800 --> 47:07.800
 As soon as a young kid gets inspired and wants that, I'll be like, I'm going to build that.

47:07.800 --> 47:08.800
 Exactly.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.800
 So I don't know who's going to come with the Back to the Future time machine,

47:12.800 --> 47:15.800
 but do you have any classmates that you think...

47:15.800 --> 47:17.800
 Time machine?

47:17.800 --> 47:23.800
 I thought you were going to Back to the Future, like the hoverboard or like...

47:23.800 --> 47:25.800
 Yeah, we're there at least.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.800
 Somebody, they got...

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
 You seen the one on the water?

47:29.800 --> 47:30.800
 No.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.800
 No, the surf hover straight is dope.

47:33.800 --> 47:34.800
 Nice.

47:34.800 --> 47:35.800
 It's dope.

47:35.800 --> 47:42.800
 It actually, if you were Back to the Future fan, you feel like you made it there.

47:42.800 --> 47:43.800
 Yeah.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.800
 Well, now we just got to work on the time travel.

47:45.800 --> 47:50.800
 And it was cool to hear you talk about the master of the flying gear team today,

47:50.800 --> 47:58.800
 that that inspired the lyric for the Wu Tang Clan and Nothing to F With.

47:58.800 --> 47:59.800
 Yeah.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.800
 How does that go again?

48:01.800 --> 48:03.800
 But the Coast Word or the lyric?

48:03.800 --> 48:04.800
 Nothing.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.800
 I am rushing.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
 But the lyric.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.800
 I said, I'd be torsing and forcing.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
 My style is awesome.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.800
 I'm causing more family foods than Richard Dawson.

48:16.800 --> 48:19.800
 And the survey said, you're dead.

48:19.800 --> 48:22.800
 The fatal flying gullotine chops off your head.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.800
 Yeah.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.800
 Yeah.

48:24.800 --> 48:29.800
 And it was interesting to see the guillotine in a movie today, how...

48:29.800 --> 48:31.800
 I don't know.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.800
 That's surreal, right?

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
 But it's not.

48:34.800 --> 48:36.800
 It's like, it's engineering.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
 It's both surreal.

48:37.800 --> 48:38.800
 Right.

48:38.800 --> 48:43.800
 And it adds this chaos into this real world that...

48:43.800 --> 48:46.800
 And then challenges everybody to think what you're going to do with that.

48:46.800 --> 48:47.800
 Yeah.

48:47.800 --> 48:48.800
 How are you going to beat it?

48:48.800 --> 48:49.800
 Yeah.

48:49.800 --> 48:50.800
 How are you going to beat it?

48:50.800 --> 48:54.800
 And the evil and the mix of the bad guys and the good guys.

48:54.800 --> 48:56.800
 And you're not sure who the bad guys are.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.800
 It's the old question of good versus evil, right?

48:58.800 --> 48:59.800
 Yeah.

48:59.800 --> 49:03.800
 Like you said, then the question of who was good, who was evil.

49:03.800 --> 49:07.800
 But they all had a similar problem and the guillotine came.

49:07.800 --> 49:12.800
 But in terms of the real, you mentioned The Godfather, Good and Evil.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.800
 That's your favorite movie.

49:13.800 --> 49:14.800
 Yeah.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.800
 What makes it great, do you think?

49:16.800 --> 49:19.800
 The characters, the study of family, of justice, of power.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.800
 What connects with you?

49:21.800 --> 49:27.800
 Oh, I mean, every one of those themes connects in the real.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.800
 And it connects in a cinematic way as well.

49:30.800 --> 49:36.800
 The difference, I think, with me and The Godfather was, I seen it during the period of time when

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
 my father was absent.

49:38.800 --> 49:47.800
 And therefore, family structure and family values was actually adopted in my family because

49:47.800 --> 49:48.800
 of that.

49:48.800 --> 49:58.800
 Me and my brother, Devon, we actually took so much heed to that movie in our family life.

49:58.800 --> 50:09.800
 And we kind of mimic that family in its structure of somebody has to be the leader of the family.

50:09.800 --> 50:14.800
 Even if it was the younger, Michael was younger than Sonny and Fredra.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.800
 But he was worthy.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.800
 And my brother, Devon, is older than me.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.800
 My brother, King is older than me.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.800
 And it's funny, sometimes Devon calls King, Fredra, and I know King wants to.

50:24.800 --> 50:29.800
 Because King was actually, he could beat our ass in my language.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.800
 But you're Michael.

50:31.800 --> 50:32.800
 Yeah.

50:32.800 --> 50:37.800
 And not by choice, just by definition of that's what I am.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
 You know what I mean?

50:39.800 --> 50:47.800
 And it's just a blessing for me to have my older sister, my older brothers and my younger

50:47.800 --> 50:55.800
 brothers look to me as just as a good light in the family.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.800
 And like I said, that movie helped.

50:57.800 --> 50:58.800
 My sisters too.

50:58.800 --> 51:02.800
 You know, the cool thing about my family, I don't know if I shared this a lot.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.800
 It's a big, we all watch these movies together.

51:05.800 --> 51:11.800
 And so the eight diagram pole fighter, master killer, five that even as my family knows

51:11.800 --> 51:14.800
 these movies, it's not just I know them.

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
 Right.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.800
 And then you extended further, my friends know them, right too.

51:19.800 --> 51:28.800
 So there's a language that we all can have that actually film has informed a communication.

51:28.800 --> 51:36.800
 So the Godfather, you know, which also is still a fictional story of something.

51:36.800 --> 51:42.800
 But since it was based in reality, based on something real, and it was human, it wasn't

51:42.800 --> 51:43.800
 so heightened.

51:43.800 --> 51:50.800
 I think the purity of it resonates and the purity of it is something that resonates with

51:50.800 --> 51:51.800
 me.

51:51.800 --> 51:55.800
 You know, you got to be, you got to plan ahead.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.800
 You know, he didn't want to deal with the drugs.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.800
 But that time of business was upon them.

52:01.800 --> 52:04.800
 It's like, it's almost like this is a tough one.

52:04.800 --> 52:09.800
 Like sometimes when the Muslim brothers come from the Middle East to America and they open

52:09.800 --> 52:13.800
 up delis, right, they would sell him.

52:13.800 --> 52:19.800
 And we would go in there and complain to them and make them like they used to get mad at

52:19.800 --> 52:20.800
 us when we came.

52:20.800 --> 52:24.800
 But, you know, and that's as a kid, but as a man, I'm like, yo, he's here to sell.

52:24.800 --> 52:27.800
 Now, he stills don't have to sell to him.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.800
 Like Vito Corleone didn't want to sell the drugs.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.800
 Okay.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.800
 He didn't have to do it.

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
 He didn't do it.

52:34.800 --> 52:39.800
 And it cost him some bullets to eventually somebody in the family ended up doing it.

52:39.800 --> 52:40.800
 Yeah.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.300
 You see what I mean?

52:42.300 --> 52:46.080
 What about this idea that it's family before everything else?

52:46.080 --> 52:53.240
 So like, you know, there's different laws you live according to in this world and family

52:53.240 --> 52:54.240
 is first.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.240
 Yeah.

52:55.240 --> 52:58.240
 That's, that's, that's mathematically correct.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.240
 I don't like that.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.240
 You know what I mean?

53:01.240 --> 53:07.000
 I mean, there's a, there's a certain sense of, you look at powerful people, you look

53:07.000 --> 53:12.400
 at Putin, there's a certain sense in which the people who are in the inner circle, that's

53:12.400 --> 53:13.960
 who you take care of.

53:13.960 --> 53:20.600
 That's family and anyone else that crosses you that, you know, there's a different set

53:20.600 --> 53:23.480
 of ethics under which you operate for those people.

53:23.480 --> 53:30.440
 Well, Jesus said the same thing, you know, when he said love that neighbor and our brother,

53:30.440 --> 53:32.040
 he was talking about that community.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.040
 Yeah.

53:33.040 --> 53:38.280
 When the other lady, it's a marathon, say, Hey, Jesus, I'm not feeling, my brother not

53:38.280 --> 53:39.280
 feeling so well.

53:39.280 --> 53:42.560
 And could you say, give not that which is holy unto the dogs.

53:42.560 --> 53:48.600
 If you're going to tell a woman, I'm give not that which is holy unto the dogs.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.600
 And she's a woman.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.880
 You just called her a dog.

53:51.880 --> 53:53.680
 I translated that in hip hop.

53:53.680 --> 53:54.680
 Yeah.

53:54.680 --> 53:55.680
 She's a female.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.680
 He called her a dog.

53:56.680 --> 53:57.680
 Yeah.

53:57.680 --> 53:58.680
 I know how that goes.

53:58.680 --> 54:04.480
 But she trans, but she said to him, but even the dog is allowed to eat the crumbs that

54:04.480 --> 54:08.160
 falls from the master's table.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
 And he went and helped.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.160
 Yeah.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.160
 He helped her.

54:11.160 --> 54:15.480
 Now let's go back to what you just said about Putin or Vito Colón or myself and my family.

54:15.480 --> 54:21.520
 Of course the family is first, but once the family is good, it has to then spread to the

54:21.520 --> 54:27.880
 community, then to the state, country, world.

54:27.880 --> 54:31.720
 The problem we have sometimes is that, and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families

54:31.720 --> 54:32.720
 was overthrown.

54:32.720 --> 54:36.760
 Like why did they behead their own king with the gulleteam, right?

54:36.760 --> 54:45.720
 Because that, once the family was strong, they didn't let the wealth, the opportunity

54:45.720 --> 54:47.960
 expand out.

54:47.960 --> 54:48.960
 You know?

54:48.960 --> 54:55.520
 Look at the gulleteam, yes, our family was made strong first, but then all the women

54:55.520 --> 55:00.480
 was able to form their own corporations and they had their own subfamilies.

55:00.480 --> 55:01.480
 It has to grow out.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.320
 And they took over the world.

55:03.320 --> 55:10.160
 You've talked about being vegan and I don't think I heard you explain this because it

55:10.160 --> 55:13.720
 connects somehow about how you think about life.

55:13.720 --> 55:19.640
 So you talk about when your family is good, you grow that circle of empathy, you grow

55:19.640 --> 55:21.400
 the community.

55:21.400 --> 55:28.280
 Is that how you think about being vegan, that just the capacity of living beings on earth

55:28.280 --> 55:33.200
 to suffer, that you just don't want to add suffering to them?

55:33.200 --> 55:34.200
 Yeah.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.560
 I mean, you said it clear.

55:36.560 --> 55:40.880
 It's like nothing in all reality.

55:40.880 --> 55:46.320
 I came to a realization that nothing really has to die for me to live.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.320
 No animal.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.560
 The plants themselves, right?

55:49.560 --> 55:55.360
 So let's just say, you know, you want a steak, which is probably the most, you know, you

55:55.360 --> 55:59.080
 know, I don't know the most expensive piece of meat, but let's just say the steak is,

55:59.080 --> 56:03.520
 you know, top of the line, nice steak and you eating the steak for the protein to help

56:03.520 --> 56:05.640
 build your muscle.

56:05.640 --> 56:08.720
 And I don't know if you got it from a cow or a bull, but whether it's the cow or the

56:08.720 --> 56:16.800
 bull, they grow to about 1500 pounds and if it's a bull, it's all muscly muscle and it's

56:16.800 --> 56:19.960
 only eating grass.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.480
 Yeah.

56:21.480 --> 56:22.480
 Yeah.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.360
 There's, yeah.

56:24.360 --> 56:29.200
 It's possible to both as an athlete and just as a human being to perform well without

56:29.200 --> 56:30.200
 meat and meat.

56:30.200 --> 56:36.600
 There's something, especially in the way we're treating animals, to deliver that meat to

56:36.600 --> 56:37.600
 the plate.

56:37.600 --> 56:38.680
 I think about that a lot.

56:38.680 --> 56:44.560
 So I do, I'm a robotics person, AI person, and I think a lot about, I don't know if you

56:44.560 --> 56:48.760
 think about this kind of stuff, but building AI systems as they become more and more human

56:48.760 --> 56:55.480
 like, you start to ask the question of, are we okay?

56:55.480 --> 57:02.520
 If we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer, first to feel, but then to suffer,

57:02.520 --> 57:07.680
 to hate and to love, to feel emotion, how do we deal with that?

57:07.680 --> 57:13.840
 It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals, are we okay adding that suffering

57:13.840 --> 57:14.840
 to the world?

57:14.840 --> 57:15.840
 Right.

57:15.840 --> 57:19.560
 And I don't think we should add to suffering because it's not necessary.

57:19.560 --> 57:22.520
 Like when you look, if it's necessary, right?

57:22.520 --> 57:27.280
 Because we're survival or the first law of nature is self preservation.

57:27.280 --> 57:31.160
 If you are in a desert and there's nothing else to eat, but that lizard.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.160
 Yeah.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.160
 Okay.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.160
 You got to do what you got to do.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.160
 The lizard's got to go.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.160
 Yeah.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.160
 You got to go.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.120
 You got to do what you got to do because at the end of the day, man is, when they say

57:39.120 --> 57:45.800
 man has dominion over these things, his dominion is almost like a caretaker out the way we

57:45.800 --> 57:47.240
 do our dominion.

57:47.240 --> 57:49.880
 We dominate it, eat it, cook it.

57:49.880 --> 57:54.680
 Like who's the first guy that looked at the lobster and was like, I'm going to eat this

57:54.680 --> 57:55.680
 thing.

57:55.680 --> 57:59.080
 It's like, it's first of all, it's hard to eat it.

57:59.080 --> 58:03.120
 You got to go through a process to get that, a crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when

58:03.120 --> 58:04.120
 we was kids.

58:04.120 --> 58:07.360
 And I didn't know why I was always getting itchy throats and all that.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.200
 You know, you can't, you don't know, just eat.

58:09.200 --> 58:15.920
 But at the end of the day, a crab didn't provide no more than a finger worth of meat, maybe.

58:15.920 --> 58:18.160
 And it's hell getting that thing, getting it out.

58:18.160 --> 58:20.960
 It's like, it's not worth it in all of reality.

58:20.960 --> 58:32.280
 You could have gave me a banana and did better for my body and my appetite and my being fulfilled

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
 as full.

58:33.280 --> 58:39.000
 Like, look at the blessings of life, right?

58:39.000 --> 58:47.720
 If you take a seed or you get an apple and you eat it, in that apple is multiple seeds

58:47.720 --> 58:49.360
 in it.

58:49.360 --> 58:54.760
 If you plant that seed, it'll give you a whole tree with a whole bunch of apples with all

58:54.760 --> 58:56.880
 multiple seeds.

58:56.880 --> 59:02.200
 But if you kill a fish, it can't be produced, it's done.

59:02.200 --> 59:04.920
 If you kill a cat, it's done, it's not, it's not coming back.

59:04.920 --> 59:11.960
 But when you deal with the plants, even after you eat the apple and then you defecate, your

59:11.960 --> 59:16.320
 defecation is what feeds the ground, the cause of apple to grow more.

59:16.320 --> 59:21.360
 Yeah, it's a circle of life, and especially there's a guy named David Foster Wallace,

59:21.360 --> 59:24.320
 he wrote a short story called, Consider the Lobster.

59:24.320 --> 59:30.960
 If you actually think philosophically about what, from a perspective of a lobster, that's

59:30.960 --> 59:37.080
 like symbolic or something because you're basically put in water, like cold water, and

59:37.080 --> 59:41.240
 then it heats up slowly until it's no more.

59:41.240 --> 59:46.680
 Yeah, it must have been like, they started eating lobsters in the inquisition.

59:46.680 --> 59:50.640
 Yeah, they just enjoyed, they were probably enjoyed torturing animals and they realized

59:50.640 --> 59:54.120
 they're also delicious after the tortures finished, that's probably how they discovered

59:54.120 --> 59:55.120
 it.

59:55.120 --> 59:56.120
 Let me ask you a question.

59:56.120 --> 59:58.320
 I know you're asking me the questions, but I just want to talk a little bit about the

59:58.320 --> 1:00:07.280
 AI, and you said something about trying to put the emotion in it, right?

1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:11.880
 So are you thinking there's an algorithm for emotion?

1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:19.600
 Yes, but I think emotion isn't something that there's an algorithm for a particular system,

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.560
 we create emotions together.

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:27.720
 So emotion is something like this conversation, it's like magic we create together.

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:34.000
 So I've worked with quite a few robots, a very simple version of that, I've had Roomba

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.840
 vacuum cleaners, I've had them make different sounds and one of them is like screaming in

1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:41.280
 pain like lightly.

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:45.880
 And just having them do that when you kick them or when they run at the stuff, immediately

1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:47.920
 I start to feel something for them.

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:54.400
 Right, so the emotion you're saying is imposed back on the human, but I'm asking, do you

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:58.520
 think there's an algorithm for the emotion to be imposed from machine to machine?

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.560
 Yeah, that's a really good way to ask it.

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:09.360
 It's difficult because I think ultimately I only know how to exist in the human world.

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:13.440
 So it's like, it's the question of if a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there to

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.880
 see it, does it still fall?

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:22.920
 I still think that ultimately machines will have to show emotion to other humans and that's

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.240
 when it becomes real.

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:32.480
 I've been thinking about this a lot too, and I just, okay, I'll come into with this because

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:36.880
 I've been thinking about this and this is just your feeling.

1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:40.400
 Well do you think the emotion is wave?

1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:45.840
 Like light is wave or do you think it's particle?

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:50.360
 So emotion is just a small, it's like a shadow of something bigger and I think that bigger

1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:52.080
 thing is consciousness.

1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:53.480
 So emotion is just...

1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:59.080
 It's a wave or a particle, you haven't thought about that?

1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:05.160
 I have thought about it, whether it's, there's something like, whether consciousness or emotion

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:09.280
 is a law of physics, like if it's that fundamental to the universe.

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:15.240
 I had a lyric, I had a lyric that said this, it comes out, they did this documentary about

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:20.200
 the planet and it gave, it wrote a song, it's called, The World of Confusion and I'll try

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:23.960
 to paraphrase the lyric but in the world of the confusion where there's so much illusions,

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:29.520
 we suck the blood from the planet, now it needs a transfusion and the redistribution

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:39.640
 of wealth, of health and wealth of self and a deeper understanding about mental health.

1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:49.440
 The doctor described the physical solution, the psychiatrist wants to build a bigger institution

1:02:49.440 --> 1:03:00.520
 but neither have the solution or the equation to make an instrument to measure the weight

1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:03.560
 of the hate vibration.

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:06.640
 What is the weight of hate?

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:10.440
 Is it heavier than the weight of love?

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:17.560
 Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug with just 10 milligrams is all it

1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:18.560
 takes to kill a man.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:20.400
 But anyways, they're not going from there.

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:21.880
 Damn, that is good.

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:24.000
 But the question, you see the question there.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.500
 Can it be measured?

1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:27.500
 Can that be measured?

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:28.500
 I think so.

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:29.500
 I think so.

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:31.200
 I've just not got the estimate yet.

1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:36.360
 Yeah, we're in the dark ages of that but I think it could be measured.

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:42.280
 I think there's something physical, like something that connects us all this much.

1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:46.600
 We tend to think we humans are distinct entities and we move about this world but I think there's

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:49.280
 some deeper connection.

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:55.200
 But we're so, listen, science is in the, we just had a few breakthroughs in the past

1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:58.960
 hundred years from Einstein on the theoretical physics side.

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.920
 We don't know anything about human psychology.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.880
 We barely know much about human biology.

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:05.720
 We're trying to figure it all out.

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:14.000
 Yeah, I had another theory because you think about quantum, right?

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:20.400
 As long as you say that there's an uncertainty and you have me believe there's an uncertainty,

1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:22.520
 then there's an uncertainty.

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:26.560
 But if there's not an uncertainty, what happens?

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:30.080
 So I'm only saying that, it's last, last, last, because you look at quantum computers,

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:35.360
 they're going to give you the O, the one, the one, the O. They're going to take two things

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:39.480
 and make it eight things and by the time you multiply four of those things together, it's

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:41.280
 like this chess board, right?

1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:44.360
 The moves goes into the millions.

1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:51.440
 But the thing that's introduced is the uncertainty, right?

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:58.280
 You're going to make a move.

1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:01.120
 You know this already, right?

1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:06.080
 Because this has been played a thousand times, but sooner or later, something uncertain is

1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:13.960
 going to come in or make the next move.

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.960
 I like the weight of these.

1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:18.320
 They add the certainty.

1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:20.800
 I think it's just like Wu Tang, unpredictable.

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:25.520
 There's something about us humans that really doesn't like everything to be fully predictable.

1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:30.800
 I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable.

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:32.760
 There's nothing unpredictable about chess.

1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:33.760
 Right.

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:40.680
 I agree to that because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books, which I actually love

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:49.720
 what he said, he said, every game of chess is a draw.

1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:53.640
 The only way somebody wins is when one of us makes a mistake.

1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:57.680
 I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.

1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:58.680
 What is chess?

1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:00.720
 Like, how do you think about chess?

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:02.560
 What's at the core of your interest in chess?

1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:09.440
 Do you see kung fu, music, film, all of it, life, all just living through chess?

1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:10.440
 Yeah.

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:16.920
 I see it's the most stimulating passage of time for me.

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:26.000
 That's also, it's like, it's a pastime that stimulates my mind, my music, my thoughts

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:27.680
 about life at the same time.

1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:31.200
 So while some pastimes is like, say baseball is watched, it's a pastime.

1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:33.440
 And baseball can stimulate you, depending on how you look at it, right?

1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:40.080
 But most likely, you're not going to get this much brain activation, this much calculation,

1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:44.400
 and this much thinking about yourself in a game of baseball.

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:47.920
 I mean, a player maybe, but not the viewer.

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:51.120
 Chess is something that I can engage in too.

1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:58.120
 And even though it's a pastime, it's giving me all the stimulation of real time in my

1:06:58.120 --> 1:06:59.120
 life.

1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:05.640
 It's funny because it's also, it's a funny game because it's connected through centuries

1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:07.200
 of play.

1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:11.080
 Just some of the most interesting people in the history of the world have played this

1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:16.960
 game and have struggled with whatever, have projected their struggles onto the chessboard

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:20.800
 and thought, and then nations have fought over the chessboard.

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:24.600
 The Soviet Union versus the United States, Bobby Fisher represented the United States.

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.840
 The Spassky represented the Soviet Union.

1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:32.760
 I got a, before I lose track of it, when we were talked about The Godfather, you were

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:36.000
 an American gangster, great film.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.600
 You said it's one of your favorites too.

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:46.000
 What, you were in it with Denzel Washington, what makes that movie meaningful to you?

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000
 What was the like making that movie?

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.360
 Because it's a great, great American film.

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:50.600
 That was a great American film.

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:52.480
 There was so many things in that film.

1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:58.800
 Being a part of that film was probably a blessing, a treasure, because even if I wasn't a part

1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:07.920
 of it, it just sets great filmmaking and to me, a really cool, great story.

1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:18.560
 The thing that I love about it the most really is the process of it.

1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:19.560
 Which part of the process?

1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:22.640
 I wasn't known the process if I wasn't part of it.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.200
 So as a film joyous, it was a great film.

1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:32.440
 But even the process of making it was like high level education for me on multiple levels.

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:38.520
 I'm working with Ridley Scott, which is, and this is a bold statement if I say this here,

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:43.480
 because I got a lot of friends that's going to probably, but he's probably the best living

1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:47.200
 director.

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:54.440
 Because watching him allowed me to understand a principle that I've coined to him, and I

1:08:54.440 --> 1:09:00.560
 don't know if people use it yet, called multi vision.

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:09.240
 He seems to have the capacity to see eight things at one time.

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:11.760
 I heard on Robin Hood he had 18 cameras.

1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:12.960
 I wasn't there for that.

1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:15.560
 And you think he keeps them all in his mind?

1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:22.320
 I've seen him do it when he went to the monitors with the video playback guy.

1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:30.160
 I've seen him bring everything back to a point, but nothing was the same on the frame.

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:36.520
 He was already there, and he knew if he had what he was or not.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:45.400
 And he placed the cameras there, and he saw it in his own way, and I peeped it.

1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:54.240
 And I said, yeah, and I just humbly asked him, he was gracious enough to speak to me and

1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:59.600
 talk to me and confirm what I thought I saw.

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:00.600
 He confirmed it?

1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:01.600
 He confirmed it.

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:08.480
 And I was able to utilize it as I'm a filmmaker now, and I can at least see three or four

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:09.480
 things.

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:10.480
 I can't see eight yet.

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.840
 I'll be there though.

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:21.080
 But I could definitely, even right now, just I could go like this in the room, okay?

1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:22.360
 I got it now.

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:27.080
 I got like how to make this right here, which is just us all sitting.

1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:28.080
 How do I make this?

1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:29.080
 Look, boom.

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:30.080
 There's a story there.

1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:31.080
 It's a story there.

1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:37.080
 And I might just go off this hanging watch or this hanging wristband.

1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:38.080
 Yeah.

1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:39.080
 You know what I mean?

1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:40.320
 Because there's something else there too.

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:43.320
 Is he dead?

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:44.320
 We don't know.

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:45.320
 Exactly.

1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:46.320
 So he has this.

1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:47.520
 And even though this is the scene.

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:48.520
 Yeah.

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.680
 You keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:56.360
 What about like, can you give an inkling of other parts of the process, like the editing?

1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:58.440
 Like, where does the magic happen?

1:10:58.440 --> 1:10:59.440
 Another thing.

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:00.440
 Another thing.

1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:01.440
 Pedro?

1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:02.440
 I don't pronounce Pedro last name.

1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:03.440
 Right?

1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:04.440
 He's a cool guy.

1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:05.440
 I had a chance to play rugby with him.

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:06.440
 He was on, was he on my team?

1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:07.440
 Yeah.

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:08.440
 Well, we went both teams.

1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:15.720
 And Pedro, the editor, who, you know, added many great films.

1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:24.040
 Once again, he has, I will call, deciphering power.

1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:29.560
 A good editor is a decipher, almost like breaking the enigma.

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:36.800
 Because he's dealing with thousands, or we'll call it a film, with millions of feet of film,

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:40.800
 at least a million feet of film, that's a lot of film for a feature.

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:43.080
 He's dealing with that.

1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:47.160
 But he's dealing with multiple cameras.

1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:51.960
 So it ain't like it's like two cameras, he got an A, B, and he could just go back, no.

1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:56.200
 He may have six cameras, and he has to go back and deal with that process.

1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.640
 And you know what?

1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:03.200
 He knows how to tell the story again.

1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:08.560
 And he proved it on American Gangster as me being a witness.

1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:13.560
 Because it's so much information, it's even when the brothers all start getting their

1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:19.480
 little business, and then he picked one of the Bronx, and he just captured every neighborhood

1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:25.800
 within one minute, and you knew what would happen, you knew it all, you saw the whole

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:26.800
 rise of fame.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:34.280
 He watched the Palmer and Scarface, who does it in two minutes, but it's only one character.

1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.960
 So you see him go to the bank, he drops the money off, you see him buy the lion, you see

1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:42.800
 him get his wife, or the tiger, you see him get his wife, you see all that, then it ends

1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:46.800
 on the big side of him in the big house with all the TV screens.

1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:49.320
 And you see him go through it, right?

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:53.400
 But in American Gangster, you're going to tell that story of rising, but you also got to

1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:55.040
 include these five brothers.

1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:57.720
 Yeah, that's all in the edit.

1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:58.720
 Oh man.

1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:02.600
 But also all in the director, knowing that as well.

1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:05.880
 And you got to keep track, you got to keep thinking about them, because that was a story

1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:06.880
 right there.

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:11.080
 Yeah, well I was hearing it, I don't know if they was taking pictures of him, or if they

1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:13.520
 was having a little party over there.

1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:16.760
 Yeah, Jess, I think, yeah, I like it.

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:19.720
 They're playing chess in the distance.

1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.320
 This is great.

1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:28.120
 You said that you were always an old soul, and see the world as if you're 200 years old,

1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:29.800
 I like this.

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:34.040
 Because your creative vision allows you to see the final piece you've created, or you're

1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:38.280
 creating very quickly, quicker than others.

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:43.920
 I heard that as if you've almost like lived many lives, you have this experience that

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:45.600
 allows you to see the vision.

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:51.280
 So let me ask you on creativity, where does this creativity behind RZA come from, both

1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:54.240
 musically and film wise?

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.720
 Dad, I don't know if I have the answer to that one, right?

1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:00.120
 No, for sure it's where it comes from.

1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:07.920
 Only thing I could say about that is that for some reason it seems endless.

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:17.920
 And that's peculiar when I think about it myself, because I was taught a lot of things

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:20.040
 from the juzza.

1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:27.240
 He introduced me to mathematics, he introduced me to hip hop itself, to breakdancing, I got

1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:34.080
 other cousins that introduced me to graffiti, the cousins that introduced me to DJing.

1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:41.080
 I realized I had a lot of introductions, but the juzza definitely, my older cousin gave

1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:44.880
 me a lot of early inspirations.

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:54.880
 And not saying that he's not creative, as creative as he was then or now, I just didn't,

1:14:54.880 --> 1:15:03.080
 like the wide span of creativity, I don't see him doing that, right?

1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:08.360
 And I don't see my cousin, you know, the cousins that taught me how to DJ, I didn't see them

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:12.080
 move from DJing to making the beats.

1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:21.440
 You know, my cousin that, you know, who actually got me into instruments, I didn't see him

1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:24.080
 leave funk and rock.

1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:27.600
 He didn't go, like I'm orchestra composing now.

1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:37.120
 So I just said to myself, I just accept myself as an artist, as a creative artist, that's

1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:39.120
 what I am.

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:40.520
 I have to accept that.

1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:45.440
 And where it comes from, I don't know if I was just trying to try to say where it comes

1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:46.440
 from.

1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:50.760
 Like, give me some type of answer, I'll say from life itself.

1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:51.760
 But what does it feel like?

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:55.960
 Because you mentioned during this pandemic, for example, for some reason, more came to

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:58.000
 you in terms of writing.

1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:03.880
 And so do you feel like you're just receiving signals from elsewhere or like, do you feel

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:06.720
 like it's hard work or you're just waiting?

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:07.720
 Wow.

1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:10.800
 It's not even waiting, nor is it hard work.

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:15.520
 It's almost like, I said in one of my other lyrics, this is for the MC part of it.

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:18.520
 I said, MCing to me is easy as breathing.

1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:20.640
 So it's like breathing?

1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:25.920
 Yeah, it's just like, in fact, there's actually was a scientific, scientific thing I read

1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:27.920
 about that now that you said that.

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:30.160
 You heard this, I know you've had to hear this.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:41.320
 They say that the atoms in our atmosphere, which seem to be infinite in number, are not

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:48.400
 infinite in the space they occupy, because they're in our atmosphere.

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:55.760
 And so there's a chance that at least 1 million atoms that you breathe in your life was breathed

1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:56.760
 by Galileo.

1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:59.760
 You heard this before, didn't you?

1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:00.760
 Okay.

1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:04.360
 It's very accurate.

1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:05.520
 Okay.

1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:08.320
 How does your body digest it?

1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:16.680
 Well, let's start at the fact that most of the atoms that we're made of is from like

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.680
 stars, right?

1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:19.680
 Stars birth.

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:24.200
 So like, we're all really connected fundamentally somehow, and then the atoms that make up our

1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:28.120
 body come and leave, and the same with the cells that are in our body.

1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:31.600
 They die and are reborn, and we don't pay attention to any of that.

1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:33.320
 That all just goes through us.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:37.560
 I don't know.

1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:41.960
 That makes me feel like I'm not an individual.

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:47.280
 I'm just a finger of something much bigger, some much bigger organism.

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:51.880
 Well, because you're drinking the coffee there, right?

1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:54.360
 You're going to digest that.

1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:58.880
 You're going to digest those atoms, whether you're going to put them through the bowel

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:02.400
 or through the urination, it's coming out, or maybe you'll sweat it out.

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:05.800
 You might sneeze it out, but they're going to make their way out.

1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:10.880
 How do you digest the atoms if you just breathe in Galileo?

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:14.560
 How do, and that's what I think an artist does.

1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:17.880
 I think something in the artist, it's like some people eat things and they're going

1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:18.880
 to gain weight.

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:22.200
 Some people ain't going to gain weight, they're going to gain muscle.

1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:23.600
 I'm just giving you an analogy here.

1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:29.880
 I'm thinking that the artist breathes in and translates it into the art.

1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:30.880
 First they got to hear it.

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:34.000
 I think most of us don't hear that.

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000
 We receive it, but it just doesn't happen.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.440
 Yeah, we not have the frequency.

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:43.480
 I said this to our artists, and even we all consider ourselves artists in a certain way,

1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:51.840
 but let's just say there's only one million artists in the world.

1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:53.840
 Good.

1:18:53.840 --> 1:19:03.400
 If you divide that into the population, what part of the table would it be?

1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:04.520
 A tiny part.

1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:06.400
 It might be that, right?

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:07.400
 Yeah.

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:11.000
 Yeah, it's that that inspires that.

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:12.000
 Oh yeah.

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.200
 Ain't no so crazy about that though.

1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:18.800
 There's also a chance, I'm just going numbers and I'm just hypothesizing with you, but there's

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:26.720
 also a chance that all of this is actually informing that.

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:32.440
 The artist is just watching this, all of this, all of the chaos of this.

1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:34.680
 So it's hard to know where the beauty comes from.

1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:36.800
 Is it the artist or the chaos from the?

1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:42.120
 So I don't have the answer, but if I was to be forced to say a certain answer, you're

1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:43.120
 not twisting my arm.

1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:44.120
 Yeah.

1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:45.120
 I can if you want me to.

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:46.120
 No, thank you.

1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:49.120
 I'll see life.

1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:51.720
 Yeah, life.

1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:56.720
 In the Tao of Wu, you write something about confusion, which I really like.

1:19:56.720 --> 1:19:58.840
 Confusion is a gift from God.

1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:04.640
 Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution, sit, wait, the information will

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.160
 become clear.

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:08.960
 The confusion is there to guide you.

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:11.840
 Seek detachment and become the producer of your life.

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:17.520
 So I got to ask you advice.

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:22.120
 If a young person today in high school, college is looking for some advice, what advice could

1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:26.320
 you give them to be a producer of a life that can be proud of?

1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:28.240
 Read the Tao of Wu.

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.480
 Let's start with the Wu Tang Manual first.

1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:32.480
 Yeah.

1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:33.480
 No, you can do that second.

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:34.480
 Second.

1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:35.480
 Yeah.

1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:39.800
 I think you could read the Tao of Wu first and then do the manual because the manual

1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:44.360
 is not to put the two books against each other, but the manual is talking about things that

1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:51.400
 is so deeply connected to the music and the people and the Tao of Wu goes beyond that.

1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:57.600
 So I would actually start there, which is not normally how I prescribe.

1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:00.560
 I always tell people to start at knowledge, then go to wisdom.

1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:01.560
 But since the Tao...

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.560
 Skip ahead to the wisdom.

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:03.560
 I like it.

1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:09.080
 Yeah, I think for a young man in high school, go to the Tao of Wu and then go back.

1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:16.400
 Just like sometimes, like my son's generation, they have to watch the second round of Star

1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:19.720
 Wars and then go back.

1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:27.200
 This generation is watching The Force Awakens and then they go back.

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:31.960
 Because if you just look at your life as an example, that's one heck of a life.

1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:33.840
 There's very few lives like it.

1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:38.560
 You've created some of the most incredible things artistically in this world.

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:40.160
 If somebody...

1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:44.800
 You talk about that like one million right at the corner of the table.

1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:51.240
 If somebody once strives dreams to become one of those, how do they do it?

1:21:51.240 --> 1:22:00.440
 Well, the beautiful thing is that there are footprints left by those who've done it and

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:02.480
 the best way is to study that.

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:07.200
 To study those who've already done what you want to do.

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:13.680
 We live on the civilizations, we said this is the greatest country in the world, but

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:21.560
 our silas are pyramid with an eye on it because they did it before and they may have failed

1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:27.920
 for some reason or something happens, but it was just a strong enough example to take

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:28.920
 us further.

1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:33.800
 Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better than what the rocket builders did before.

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:36.280
 He's not the first one to build the rocket.

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:39.120
 He's not the first guy to think over the electric car.

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:40.480
 He's doing it better.

1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:45.880
 He's advancing it to the point that whoever picks up after him, maybe they'll get to that

1:22:45.880 --> 1:22:47.800
 flying car.

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:51.440
 So that's the beauty.

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:52.440
 There's a good verse.

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:58.920
 I love finding verses to say things, to confirm because this way people could take it verbally,

1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:01.240
 physically, and then maybe even spiritually.

1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:07.640
 For Christmas, he said the fastest way to heaven is by spending time or studying the

1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:13.460
 wise people, meaning the wise people who was living and those who lived before you.

1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:14.960
 Study the masters.

1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:18.960
 Let me ask you a big, perhaps ridiculous question, but give it a shot.

1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:20.360
 What is the meaning of this whole thing?

1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:23.440
 What's the meaning of life?

1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:24.440
 Big question.

1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:31.040
 I'm not going to rush into the answer.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:34.960
 I'm going to give you somebody else's answer first and I'll give you my answer.

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:42.120
 I remember asking this, and I don't know, I was 15, 16 years old.

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:55.280
 One of the brothers, we're studying in mathematics, and the letter I itself means I, Islam.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:24:01.840
 I mean in the individual, right, being a total accord with Islam.

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:04.080
 And I mean, let's finish this.

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:13.360
 Then they took the word Islam and they defined it as Islam is an Arabic word for peace.

1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:21.760
 Then they said peace is the absence of confusion, okay?

1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:26.560
 So then they took, this is something that really hit me when I was, I never forgot it

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:32.400
 and I'm going to decipher it, but then they took the word Islam and they broke it down

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:37.400
 by the letter into an acronym like casual, everything around me.

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:48.840
 And they broke it down to I stimulate light and matter.

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:53.760
 Because what it means is that if you're not here, then light and matter don't exist to

1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:54.760
 you.

1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:59.320
 So you're stimulating it or it ain't here for you.

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:04.000
 So anyway, taking all that, so then I said, you know, so what's the meaning of life?

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.120
 And the brothers just said love Islam forever.

1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:08.120
 Right?

1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:12.840
 I ain't saying the religious point of it.

1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:15.800
 I'm just saying all those other elements I just spoke about in front of it.

1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:17.880
 I stimulate light and matter.

1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:18.880
 I love that.

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:19.880
 That's powerful.

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:24.960
 And let me give you my definition of life.

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:32.600
 I think life is a simple lead for each and every one of us to add on to.

1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:37.560
 Build, like you said, the master's build on top.

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:41.640
 Life gave you life, give life back.

1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:44.880
 I don't think there's a better way to end it than talking about the meaning of life.

1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:49.320
 I'm a huge fan and such a huge honor that you spend your valuable time with me.

1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:52.320
 Thank you so much.

1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:55.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Riza.

1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:03.160
 And now let me leave you with some words from Plato.

1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:08.360
 Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history.

1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:15.360
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
