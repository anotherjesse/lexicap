00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
 Evolutionarily, if we see a lion running at us,

00:03.040 --> 00:06.400
 we didn't have time to calculate the lion's kinetic energy,

00:06.400 --> 00:08.840
 and is it optimal to go this way or that way?

00:08.840 --> 00:11.760
 You just react it, and physically,

00:11.760 --> 00:14.520
 our bodies are well attuned to actually make right decisions.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.600
 But when you're playing a game like poker,

00:16.600 --> 00:19.320
 this is not something that you ever evolved to do,

00:19.320 --> 00:22.360
 and yet you're in that same flight or fight response.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.120
 And so that's a really important skill to be able to develop,

00:25.120 --> 00:28.280
 to basically learn how to meditate in the moment

00:28.280 --> 00:30.480
 and calm yourself so that you can think clearly.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.720
 The following is a conversation with Liv Burri,

00:35.720 --> 00:38.400
 formerly one of the best poker players in the world,

00:38.400 --> 00:40.320
 trained as an astrophysicist

00:40.320 --> 00:44.240
 and is now a philanthropist and an educator

00:44.240 --> 00:48.280
 on topics of game theory, physics, complexity, and life.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.200
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:53.200 --> 00:54.440
 in the description.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.520
 And now, dear friends, here's Liv Burri.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.560
 What role do you think luck plays in poker and in life?

01:02.560 --> 01:04.240
 You can pick whichever one you want,

01:04.240 --> 01:06.920
 poker or life and or life.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.640
 The longer you play, the less influenced luck has,

01:10.640 --> 01:11.640
 you know, like with all things,

01:11.640 --> 01:13.880
 the bigger your sample size,

01:13.880 --> 01:16.360
 the more the quality of your decisions

01:16.360 --> 01:17.920
 or your strategies matter.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.760
 So to answer that question, yeah, in poker, it really depends.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.120
 If you and I sat and played 10 hands right now,

01:26.120 --> 01:30.240
 I might only win 52% of the time, 53% maybe.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.720
 But if we played 10,000 hands,

01:31.720 --> 01:35.160
 then I'll probably win like over 98, 99% of the time.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.160
 So it's a question of sample sizes.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.120
 And what are you figuring out over time?

01:40.120 --> 01:42.240
 The betting strategy that this individual does

01:42.240 --> 01:43.720
 or literally doesn't matter

01:43.720 --> 01:45.920
 against any individual over time?

01:45.920 --> 01:47.200
 Against any individual over time,

01:47.200 --> 01:49.520
 the better player because they're making better decisions.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.240
 So what does that mean to make a better decision?

01:51.240 --> 01:55.280
 Well, to get into the real nitty gritty already.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.760
 Basically, poker is the game of math.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.320
 There are these strategies familiar

02:00.320 --> 02:02.520
 with like Nash Equilibria that term, right?

02:02.520 --> 02:06.280
 So there are these game theory optimal strategies

02:06.280 --> 02:08.280
 that you can adopt.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.320
 And the closer you play to them,

02:10.320 --> 02:12.360
 the less exploitable you are.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.920
 So because I've studied the game a bunch,

02:15.920 --> 02:17.240
 although admittedly not for a few years,

02:17.240 --> 02:20.000
 but back in, you know, when I was playing all the time,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.040
 I would study these game theory optimal solutions

02:23.040 --> 02:25.680
 and try and then adopt those strategies when I go and play.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.720
 So I'd play against you and I would do that.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.800
 And because the objective,

02:31.800 --> 02:33.240
 when you're playing game theory optimal,

02:33.240 --> 02:35.960
 it's actually, it's a loss minimization thing

02:35.960 --> 02:37.360
 that you're trying to do.

02:37.360 --> 02:42.360
 Your best bet is to try and play a sort of similar style.

02:42.720 --> 02:46.200
 You also need to try and adopt this loss minimization.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.080
 But because I've been playing much longer than you,

02:48.080 --> 02:49.400
 I'll be better at that.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.880
 So first of all,

02:50.880 --> 02:53.160
 you're not taking advantage of my mistakes,

02:53.160 --> 02:55.040
 but then on top of that,

02:55.040 --> 02:56.960
 I'll be better at recognizing

02:56.960 --> 02:59.560
 when you are playing suboptimally

02:59.560 --> 03:02.200
 and then deviating from this game theory optimal strategy

03:02.200 --> 03:05.160
 to exploit your bad plays.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.680
 Can you define game theory and Nash Equilibria?

03:08.680 --> 03:10.960
 Can we try to sneak up to it in a bunch of ways?

03:10.960 --> 03:13.360
 Like, what's the game theory framework

03:13.360 --> 03:16.320
 of analyzing poker, analyzing any kind of situation?

03:16.320 --> 03:21.320
 So game theory is just basically the study of decisions

03:22.360 --> 03:25.560
 within a competitive situation.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.720
 I mean, it's technically a branch of economics,

03:27.720 --> 03:30.920
 but it also applies to like wider decision theory.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.840
 And usually when you see it,

03:35.840 --> 03:37.600
 it's these like little payoff matrices

03:37.600 --> 03:38.840
 and so on, that's how it's depicted.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.160
 But it's essentially just like study of strategies

03:41.160 --> 03:43.160
 under different competitive situations.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.400
 And as it happens, certain games,

03:46.400 --> 03:48.880
 in fact, many, many games have these things

03:48.880 --> 03:50.480
 called Nash Equilibria.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.440
 And what that means is when you're in a Nash Equilibrium,

03:52.440 --> 03:55.480
 basically it is not,

03:55.480 --> 03:59.720
 there is no strategy that you can take

03:59.720 --> 04:01.200
 that would be more beneficial

04:01.200 --> 04:02.800
 than the one you're currently taking,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.720
 assuming your opponent is also doing the same thing.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.760
 So it would be a bad idea,

04:06.760 --> 04:10.680
 if we're both playing in a game theory optimal strategy,

04:10.680 --> 04:12.200
 if either of us deviate from that,

04:12.200 --> 04:16.640
 now we're putting ourselves at a disadvantage.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.880
 Rockpapers is actually a really great example of this.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.520
 Like if we were to start playing rockpapers,

04:22.520 --> 04:23.800
 you know, you know nothing about me

04:23.800 --> 04:26.200
 and we're gonna play for all our money,

04:26.200 --> 04:27.880
 let's play 10 rounds of it.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.240
 What would your sort of optimal strategy be?

04:30.240 --> 04:31.080
 Do you think?

04:31.080 --> 04:31.920
 What would you do?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.200
 Let's see.

04:35.200 --> 04:42.200
 I would probably try to be as random as possible.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.000
 Exactly, because you don't know anything about me,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.120
 you don't want to give anything away about yourself,

04:48.120 --> 04:49.560
 so ideally you'd have like a little dice

04:49.560 --> 04:52.560
 or somewhat perfect randomizer

04:52.560 --> 04:54.480
 that makes you randomize 33% of the time

04:54.480 --> 04:56.080
 each of the three different things.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.160
 And in response to that,

04:58.160 --> 04:59.640
 well, actually I can kind of do anything,

04:59.640 --> 05:01.360
 but I would probably just randomize back too,

05:01.360 --> 05:02.400
 but actually it wouldn't matter

05:02.400 --> 05:05.120
 because I know that you're playing randomly.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.640
 So that would be us in a Nash equilibrium

05:07.640 --> 05:10.640
 where we're both playing this like unexploitable strategy.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.120
 However, if after a while,

05:12.120 --> 05:14.920
 you then notice that I'm playing rock

05:14.920 --> 05:16.360
 a little bit more often than I should.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.160
 Yeah, you're the kind of person that would do that,

05:18.160 --> 05:19.000
 wouldn't you?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.800
 Sure, yes, yes, yes, I'm more of a scissors girl,

05:20.800 --> 05:21.640
 but anyway.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.480
 You are?

05:22.480 --> 05:24.400
 No, I'm a, as I said, randomizer.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.120
 So you notice I'm throwing rock too much

05:27.120 --> 05:28.160
 or something like that.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.280
 Now you'd be making a mistake

05:29.280 --> 05:32.200
 by continuing playing this game theory optimal strategy,

05:32.200 --> 05:33.040
 well the previous one,

05:33.040 --> 05:36.680
 because you are now there's an,

05:36.680 --> 05:37.840
 I'm making a mistake

05:37.840 --> 05:41.320
 and you're not deviating and exploiting my mistake.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.840
 So you'd want to start throwing paper a bit more often

05:43.840 --> 05:46.000
 in whatever you figure is the right sort of percentage

05:46.000 --> 05:48.120
 of the time that I'm throwing rock too often.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.400
 So that's basically an example of where,

05:51.400 --> 05:53.320
 what game theory optimal strategy is

05:53.320 --> 05:54.720
 in terms of loss minimization,

05:54.720 --> 05:58.080
 but it's not always the maximally profitable thing

05:58.080 --> 06:00.160
 if your opponent is doing stupid stuff,

06:00.160 --> 06:02.600
 which in that example.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.520
 So that's kind of then how it works in poker,

06:04.520 --> 06:06.440
 but it's a lot more complex.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.680
 And the way poker players typically,

06:10.680 --> 06:11.760
 nowadays they study,

06:11.760 --> 06:12.960
 the games change so much.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.480
 And I think we should talk about how it sort of evolved,

06:15.480 --> 06:17.840
 but nowadays like the top pros

06:17.840 --> 06:20.880
 basically spend all their time in between sessions

06:20.880 --> 06:24.280
 running these simulators using like software

06:24.280 --> 06:26.160
 where they do basically Monte Carlo simulations,

06:26.160 --> 06:31.160
 sort of doing billions of fictitious self play hands.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.040
 You input a fictitious hand scenario,

06:34.040 --> 06:36.080
 like, oh, what do I do with Jack 9 suited

06:36.080 --> 06:40.400
 on a King 10, four to two spade board

06:42.000 --> 06:43.960
 and against this bet size.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.800
 So you'd input that, press play,

06:45.800 --> 06:49.360
 it'll run, it's billions of fake hands

06:49.360 --> 06:50.320
 and then it will converge upon

06:50.320 --> 06:52.480
 what the game theory optimal strategies are.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.440
 And then you want to try and memorize what these are.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.480
 Basically they're like ratios of how often,

06:57.480 --> 06:59.920
 what types of hands you want to bluff

06:59.920 --> 07:01.320
 and what percentage of the time.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.800
 So then there's this additional layer

07:02.800 --> 07:04.440
 of inbuilt randomization built in.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.400
 Yeah, those kind of simulations incorporate

07:06.400 --> 07:08.480
 all the betting strategies and everything else like that.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.320
 So as opposed to some kind of very crude mathematical model

07:12.320 --> 07:13.840
 of what's the probability you win

07:13.840 --> 07:16.400
 just based on the quality of the card,

07:16.400 --> 07:19.000
 it's including everything else too.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.240
 The game theory of it.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.960
 Yes, yeah, essentially.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.760
 And what's interesting is that nowadays,

07:23.760 --> 07:25.640
 if you want to be a top pro and you go and play

07:25.640 --> 07:27.560
 in these really like the super high stakes tournaments

07:27.560 --> 07:29.240
 or tough cash games,

07:29.240 --> 07:30.680
 if you don't know this stuff,

07:30.680 --> 07:33.280
 you're going to get eaten alive in the long run.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.160
 But of course you could get lucky over the short run

07:35.160 --> 07:36.880
 and that's where this like luck factor comes in

07:36.880 --> 07:40.400
 because luck is both a blessing and a curse.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.600
 If luck didn't, you know, if there wasn't this random element

07:42.600 --> 07:45.280
 and there wasn't the ability for worse players

07:45.280 --> 07:48.240
 to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.000
 You know, the same reason people don't play chess

07:51.000 --> 07:53.360
 professionally for money against you.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.480
 You don't see people going and hustling chess,

07:55.480 --> 07:57.840
 like not knowing, trying to make a living from it

07:57.840 --> 08:00.160
 because you know there's very little luck in chess,

08:00.160 --> 08:01.400
 but there's quite a lot of luck in poker.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.920
 Have you seen Beautiful Mind, that movie?

08:03.920 --> 08:04.760
 Years ago.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.120
 Well, what do you think about the game

08:06.120 --> 08:08.560
 theoretic formulation of what is it,

08:08.560 --> 08:10.000
 the hot blonde at the bar?

08:10.000 --> 08:10.840
 Do you remember?

08:10.840 --> 08:11.680
 Oh, yeah.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.560
 The way they'd illustrated it is

08:13.560 --> 08:15.280
 they're trying to pick up a girl at a bar

08:15.280 --> 08:16.440
 and there's multiple girls.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.120
 They're like, it's like a friend group

08:18.120 --> 08:20.080
 when you're trying to approach.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.000
 I don't remember the details, but I remember.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.840
 Don't you like then speak to her friends?

08:23.840 --> 08:24.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.720
 Just like that, faint disinterest.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.040
 I mean, it's classic pickup artists stuff.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.880
 Yeah.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.800
 And they were trying to correlate that somehow,

08:30.800 --> 08:35.360
 that being an optimal strategy, game theoretically.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.760
 Why?

08:36.760 --> 08:37.600
 What?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.920
 Like, I don't think, I remember.

08:38.920 --> 08:39.760
 I can't imagine that they were,

08:39.760 --> 08:41.920
 I mean, there's probably an optimal strategy.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.600
 Is it, does that mean that there's

08:43.600 --> 08:46.640
 a natural Nash equilibrium of like picking up girls?

08:46.640 --> 08:49.000
 Do you know the marriage problem?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.920
 It's optimal stopping.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.760
 Yes.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.160
 So where it's an optimal dating strategy,

08:54.160 --> 08:56.560
 where you, do you remember?

08:56.560 --> 08:57.400
 Yeah.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.240
 I think it's like something like,

08:58.240 --> 08:59.960
 you know, you've got like a set of a hundred people

08:59.960 --> 09:00.800
 you're going to look through.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.280
 And after how many do you,

09:04.280 --> 09:05.680
 now after that,

09:05.680 --> 09:08.080
 after going on this many dates out of a hundred,

09:08.080 --> 09:09.200
 at what point do you then go,

09:09.200 --> 09:10.840
 okay, the next best person I see,

09:10.840 --> 09:11.680
 is that the right one?

09:11.680 --> 09:14.160
 And I think it's like something like 37%.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.760
 It's one over E, whatever that is.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.600
 Right.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.440
 Which I think is 37%.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.280
 Yeah.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.840
 I'm going to fact check that.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.400
 Yeah.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.400
 So, but it's funny under those strict constraints,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.680
 then yes, after that many people,

09:30.680 --> 09:32.880
 as long as you have a fixed size pool,

09:32.880 --> 09:36.480
 then you just picked the next person

09:36.480 --> 09:38.440
 that is better than anyone you've seen before.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.280
 Yeah.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.760
 Have you tried this?

09:41.760 --> 09:42.600
 Have you incorporated it?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
 I'm not one of those people.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.880
 And we're going to discuss this.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.160
 And what do you mean those people?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.560
 I try not to optimize stuff.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.320
 I try to listen to the heart.

09:55.320 --> 09:59.800
 I don't think I like,

09:59.800 --> 10:04.800
 my mind immediately is attracted to optimizing everything.

10:06.240 --> 10:11.080
 And I think that if you really give into that kind of addiction

10:11.080 --> 10:14.920
 that you lose the joy of the small things,

10:14.920 --> 10:17.200
 the minutiae of life, I think.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.040
 I don't know.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.840
 I'm concerned about the addictive nature

10:19.840 --> 10:21.640
 of my personality in that regard.

10:21.640 --> 10:25.560
 In some ways, while I think the,

10:25.560 --> 10:30.160
 on average people under try and quantify things

10:30.160 --> 10:33.920
 or try under optimize, there are some people who,

10:33.920 --> 10:35.320
 you know, it's like with all these things,

10:35.320 --> 10:37.120
 it's a, you know, it's a balancing act.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.160
 I've been on dating apps when I've never used them.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.040
 I'm sure they have data on this

10:42.040 --> 10:45.240
 because they probably have the optimal stopping control problem.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.360
 Cause there aren't a lot of people that use social,

10:47.360 --> 10:51.040
 like dating apps are on there for a long time.

10:51.040 --> 10:56.040
 So the interesting aspect is like, all right,

10:56.320 --> 10:58.800
 how long before you stop looking,

10:58.800 --> 11:01.240
 before it actually starts affecting your mind

11:01.240 --> 11:05.080
 negatively such that you see dating as a kind of,

11:07.400 --> 11:08.240
 A game.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.240
 A kind of game versus an actual process of finding somebody

11:13.600 --> 11:15.840
 that's gonna make you happy for the rest of your life.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.360
 That's really interesting.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.200
 They have the data.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.440
 I wish they would be able to release that data.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.280
 And I do want to.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.100
 It's okay.

11:22.100 --> 11:22.940
 Cupid, right?

11:22.940 --> 11:25.360
 I think they ran a huge, huge study on all of their.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.480
 Yeah, they're more data driven.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.080
 I think, okay, Cupid folks are.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.240
 I think there's a lot of opportunity for dating apps

11:30.240 --> 11:32.360
 and you know, even bigger than dating apps,

11:32.360 --> 11:35.080
 people connecting on the internet.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.600
 I just hope they're more data driven

11:37.600 --> 11:40.360
 and it doesn't seem that way.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.400
 I think like, I've always thought that

11:44.800 --> 11:47.920
 Goodreads should be a dating app.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.760
 Like the.

11:48.760 --> 11:49.600
 I've never used it.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.600
 Goodreads is just lists like books that you've read.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.360
 And it allows you to comment on the books you read

11:57.360 --> 11:58.920
 and what the books you're currently reading.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.280
 But it's a giant social networks of people reading books.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.640
 And that seems to be a much better database of like interests.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.560
 Of course, to constrain you to the books you're reading,

12:06.560 --> 12:10.200
 but like that really reveals so much more about the person

12:10.200 --> 12:12.440
 allows you to discover shared interests

12:12.440 --> 12:13.960
 because books are kind of window

12:13.960 --> 12:16.000
 into the way you see the world.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.360
 Also like the kind of places people you're curious about,

12:20.360 --> 12:21.720
 the kind of ideas you're curious about.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.680
 Are you romantic?

12:22.680 --> 12:24.880
 Are you cold calculating rationalist?

12:24.880 --> 12:27.000
 Are you, are you into Iron Rand?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.280
 Or are you into Bernie Sanders?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.360
 Are you into whatever?

12:29.360 --> 12:30.200
 Right.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.000
 And I feel like that reveals so much more

12:32.000 --> 12:35.240
 than like a person trying to look hot

12:35.240 --> 12:37.120
 from a certain angle in the Tinder profile.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.960
 Well, and it would also be a really great filter

12:38.960 --> 12:40.360
 in the first place for people.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.960
 It selects people who read books

12:41.960 --> 12:44.720
 and are willing to go and rate them

12:44.720 --> 12:47.040
 and give feedback on them and so on.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.760
 So that's already a really strong filter

12:48.760 --> 12:50.640
 or probably the type of people you'd be looking for.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.400
 Well, at least be able to fake reading books.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.600
 I mean, the thing about books,

12:53.600 --> 12:54.560
 you don't really need to read it.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.880
 You can just look at the cliff notes.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.120
 Yeah, game the dating app by feigning intellectualism.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.400
 Can I admit something very horrible about myself?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.240
 Go on.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.360
 The things that, you know,

13:04.360 --> 13:05.760
 I don't have many things in my closet,

13:05.760 --> 13:07.000
 but this is one of them.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.760
 I've never actually read Shakespeare.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.400
 I've only read cliff notes.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.760
 And I got a five in the AP English exam.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.920
 Wow.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.680
 And I had the witch books, have I read?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.560
 Well, yeah, which was the exam on which books?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.360
 Oh, no, they include a lot of them.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.560
 But Hamlet, I don't even know if you read Romeo and Juliet.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.760
 Macbeth, I don't remember, but I don't understand it.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.080
 It's like really cryptic.

13:34.080 --> 13:34.920
 It's hard.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.040
 It's really, I don't, and it's not that pleasant to read.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.280
 It's like ancient speak.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.400
 I don't understand it.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.840
 Anyway, maybe I was too dumb.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.760
 Man, I'm still too dumb, but I did.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.800
 But you got a five, which is.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.640
 Yeah, yeah.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.000
 I don't know how the U.S. grading system.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.400
 Oh, no, so AP English is a,

13:50.400 --> 13:53.080
 there's kind of this advanced versions of courses

13:53.080 --> 13:54.920
 in high school and you take a test

13:54.920 --> 13:58.920
 that is like a broad test for that subject and includes a lot.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.600
 It wasn't obviously just Shakespeare.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.920
 I think a lot of it was also writing, written.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.160
 You have like AP physics, AP computer science,

14:07.160 --> 14:11.160
 AP biology, AP chemistry, and then AP English

14:11.160 --> 14:13.520
 and AP literature, I forget what it was.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.080
 But I think Shakespeare was a part of that.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.400
 But I.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.200
 And you, and you gave the point is you gave a fight it.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.040
 Gave a fight.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.640
 Well, entirety, I was into getting A's.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.240
 I saw it as a game.

14:24.240 --> 14:29.240
 I don't think any, I don't think all the learning I've done

14:30.400 --> 14:34.000
 has been outside of the, outside of school.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.320
 The deepest learning I've done has been outside of school

14:36.320 --> 14:38.440
 with a few exceptions, especially in grad school,

14:38.440 --> 14:40.520
 like deep computer science courses.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.840
 But that was still outside of school

14:41.840 --> 14:43.760
 because it was outside of getting, sorry,

14:43.760 --> 14:46.240
 it was outside of getting the A for the course.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.680
 The best stuff I've ever done is when you read the chapter

14:49.680 --> 14:52.400
 and you do many of the problems at the end of the chapter,

14:52.400 --> 14:55.000
 which is usually not what's required for the course.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.200
 Like the hardest stuff.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.880
 In fact, textbooks are freaking incredible.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.320
 If you go back now and you look at like biology textbook

15:02.320 --> 15:06.120
 or any of the computer science textbooks

15:06.120 --> 15:07.800
 on algorithms and data structures,

15:07.800 --> 15:09.600
 those things are incredible.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.040
 They have the best summary of a subject.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.400
 Plus they have practice problems of increasing difficulty

15:15.400 --> 15:17.760
 that allows you to truly master the basic,

15:17.760 --> 15:19.720
 like the fundamental ideas behind that.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.680
 That was, I got to my entire physics degree

15:22.680 --> 15:26.360
 with one textbook that was just this really comprehensive one

15:26.360 --> 15:28.720
 that they told us at the beginning of the first year,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.760
 buy this, but you're gonna have to buy 15 other books

15:31.760 --> 15:33.440
 for all your supplementary courses.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.600
 And I was like, every time I was just checked

15:35.600 --> 15:38.120
 to see whether this book covered it and it did.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.840
 And I think I only bought like two or three extra

15:39.840 --> 15:41.960
 and thank God, because they're so super expensive textbooks.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.360
 It's a whole racket they've got going on.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.280
 Yeah, they are, they could just,

15:46.280 --> 15:49.560
 you get the right one, it's just like a manual for,

15:49.560 --> 15:51.440
 but what's interesting though,

15:51.440 --> 15:56.440
 is this is the tyranny of having exams and metrics.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.720
 The tyranny of exams and metrics, yes.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.040
 I loved them because I loved, I'm very competitive

16:01.040 --> 16:04.080
 and I liked finding ways to gamify things

16:04.080 --> 16:06.160
 and then like sort of dust off my shoulders

16:06.160 --> 16:08.200
 after when I get a good grade or be annoyed at myself

16:08.200 --> 16:10.920
 when I didn't, but yeah, you're absolutely right

16:10.920 --> 16:12.880
 in that the actual, you know,

16:12.880 --> 16:15.760
 how much of that physics knowledge I've retained?

16:15.760 --> 16:19.720
 Like I've, I learned how to cram and study

16:19.720 --> 16:21.400
 and please an examiner,

16:21.400 --> 16:24.040
 but did that give me the deep lasting knowledge

16:24.040 --> 16:24.880
 that I needed?

16:24.880 --> 16:27.840
 I mean, yes and no, but really like,

16:27.840 --> 16:31.040
 nothing makes you learn a topic better

16:31.040 --> 16:34.080
 than when you actually then have to teach it yourself.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.240
 You know, like I'm trying to wrap my teeth around this

16:36.240 --> 16:38.200
 like game theory, Molek stuff right now.

16:38.200 --> 16:43.120
 And there's no exam at the end of it that I can gamify.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.600
 There's no way to gamify and sort of like

16:44.600 --> 16:45.440
 shortcut my way through it.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.280
 I have to understand it so deeply

16:47.280 --> 16:50.720
 from like deep foundational levels to then build upon it

16:50.720 --> 16:52.400
 and then try and explain it to other people.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.240
 And like, you know,

16:53.240 --> 16:54.360
 you're about to go and do some lectures, right?

16:54.360 --> 16:57.680
 You can't, you can't sort of just like,

16:58.680 --> 17:00.680
 you presumably can't rely on the knowledge

17:00.680 --> 17:03.480
 that you got through when you were studying for an exam

17:03.480 --> 17:04.880
 to reteach that.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.880
 Yeah, and especially high level lectures,

17:06.880 --> 17:09.440
 especially the kind of stuff you do on YouTube,

17:09.440 --> 17:12.800
 you're not just regurgitating material.

17:12.800 --> 17:17.800
 You have to think through what is the core idea here.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.800
 And when you do the lectures live, especially,

17:20.800 --> 17:23.960
 you have to, there's no second takes.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.440
 That is the luxury you get if you're recording a video

17:28.440 --> 17:30.240
 for YouTube or something like that,

17:30.240 --> 17:34.000
 but it definitely is a luxury you shouldn't lean on.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.320
 I've gotten to interact with a few YouTubers

17:37.320 --> 17:39.280
 that lean on that too much.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.440
 And you realize, oh, you're,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.360
 you've gamified this system

17:43.360 --> 17:46.720
 because you're not really thinking deeply about stuff.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.400
 You're through the edit,

17:48.400 --> 17:52.200
 both written and spoken.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.880
 You're crafting an amazing video,

17:53.880 --> 17:55.440
 but you yourself as a human being

17:55.440 --> 17:57.560
 have not really deeply understood it.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.760
 So live teaching, or at least recording video

18:00.760 --> 18:04.640
 with very few takes is a different beast.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.280
 And I think it's the most honest way of doing it,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.200
 like as few takes as possible.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.720
 That's what I'm nervous about this.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.160
 Don't go back, you're like,

18:13.160 --> 18:14.000
 ah, let's do that.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.480
 Don't fuck this up, Liv.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.480
 The tyranny of exams.

18:18.480 --> 18:23.480
 I do think people talk about high school and college

18:24.160 --> 18:27.160
 as a time to do drugs and drink and have fun

18:27.160 --> 18:28.280
 and all this kind of stuff.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.880
 But, you know, looking back,

18:31.880 --> 18:34.200
 of course I did a lot of those things.

18:34.200 --> 18:39.000
 No, yes, but it's also a time

18:39.000 --> 18:43.640
 when you get to like read textbooks or read books

18:43.640 --> 18:48.400
 or learn with all the time in the world.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.520
 Like you don't have these responsibilities of like,

18:51.520 --> 18:56.520
 you know, laundry and having to sort of pay for mortgage

19:00.880 --> 19:02.480
 or all that kind of stuff, pay taxes,

19:02.480 --> 19:04.040
 all this kind of stuff.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.920
 In most cases, there's just so much time

19:06.920 --> 19:08.160
 in the day for learning.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.280
 And you don't realize at the time,

19:10.280 --> 19:11.920
 because at the time it seems like a chore,

19:11.920 --> 19:15.480
 like why the hell does there's so much homework?

19:15.480 --> 19:18.040
 But you never get a chance to do this kind of learning,

19:18.040 --> 19:21.080
 this kind of homework ever again in life,

19:21.080 --> 19:24.600
 unless later in life you really make a big effort out of it.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.360
 You get, like you basically, your knowledge gets solidified.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.160
 You don't get to have fun and learn.

19:29.160 --> 19:33.360
 Learning is really fulfilling and really fun

19:33.360 --> 19:34.320
 if you're that kind of person.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.840
 Like some people like to, you know,

19:37.840 --> 19:40.560
 like knowledge is not something that they think is fun.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.640
 But if that's the kind of thing that you think is fun,

19:43.640 --> 19:45.840
 that's the time to have fun and do the drugs

19:45.840 --> 19:46.920
 and drink and all that kind of stuff.

19:46.920 --> 19:51.400
 But the learning, just going back to those textbooks,

19:51.400 --> 19:55.040
 the hours spent with the textbooks is really, really rewarding.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.640
 Do people even use textbooks anymore?

19:56.640 --> 19:57.480
 Yeah.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.320
 Do you think?

19:58.320 --> 20:01.280
 Because it's these days with their TikTok and there.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.720
 Well, not even that, but it's just like so much information,

20:04.720 --> 20:05.960
 really high quality information.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.160
 You know, it's now in digital format online.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.160
 Yeah, but they're not, they are using that,

20:11.160 --> 20:16.240
 but you know, college is still very, there's a curriculum.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.680
 I mean, so much of school is about rigorous study

20:19.680 --> 20:23.680
 of a subject and still on YouTube, that's not there.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.520
 Right.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.760
 YouTube has, Grant Sanderson talks about this.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.320
 He's this math.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.160
 331 Brown.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.640
 Yeah, 331 Brown.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.960
 He says like, I'm not a math teacher.

20:33.960 --> 20:37.800
 I just take really cool concepts and I inspire people.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.560
 But if you want to really learn calculus,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.880
 if you want to really learn linear algebra,

20:41.880 --> 20:44.920
 you should do the textbook, you should do that.

20:44.920 --> 20:49.080
 You know, and there's still the textbook industrial complex

20:49.080 --> 20:53.440
 that like charges like $200 for textbooks somehow.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.280
 I don't know.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.120
 It's ridiculous.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.640
 Well, they're like, oh, sorry, new edition, edition 14.6.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.920
 Sorry, you can't use 14.5 anymore.

21:02.920 --> 21:03.760
 It's like, what's different?

21:03.760 --> 21:05.400
 We've got one paragraph different.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.160
 So we mentioned offline, Daniel Negrado.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.680
 I'm gonna get a chance to talk to him on this podcast.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.440
 And he's somebody that I found fascinating

21:14.440 --> 21:16.600
 in terms of the way he thinks about poker,

21:16.600 --> 21:18.680
 verbalizes the way he thinks about poker,

21:18.680 --> 21:20.240
 the way he plays poker.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.960
 So, and he's still pretty damn good.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.920
 He's been good for a long time.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.720
 So you mentioned that people are running these kinds

21:27.720 --> 21:30.600
 of simulations and the game of poker has changed.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.200
 Do you think he's adapting in this way?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.960
 Do you like the top pros?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.600
 Do they have to adopt this way?

21:36.600 --> 21:41.600
 Or is there still like over the years,

21:41.600 --> 21:45.240
 you basically developed this gut feeling about,

21:45.240 --> 21:49.760
 like you get to be like good the way alpha zero is good.

21:49.760 --> 21:54.120
 You look at the board and somehow from the fog

21:54.120 --> 21:55.320
 comes out the right answer.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.960
 Like this is likely what they have.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.400
 This is likely the best way to move.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.240
 And you don't really,

22:01.240 --> 22:04.440
 you can't really put a finger on exactly why,

22:05.480 --> 22:09.000
 but it just comes from your gut feeling or no.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.520
 Yes and no.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.800
 So gut feelings are definitely very important.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.720
 That we've got our two mode or you can distill it down

22:17.720 --> 22:19.080
 to two modes of decision making, right?

22:19.080 --> 22:22.160
 You've got your sort of logical linear voice in your head,

22:22.160 --> 22:24.040
 system two as it's often called

22:24.040 --> 22:27.280
 and your system on your gut intuition.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.360
 And historically in poker,

22:32.360 --> 22:35.160
 the very best players were playing almost entirely

22:35.160 --> 22:36.000
 by their gut.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.240
 You know, often they would do some kind of inspired play

22:39.240 --> 22:40.480
 and you'd ask them why they do it

22:40.480 --> 22:42.600
 and they wouldn't really be able to explain it.

22:42.600 --> 22:46.480
 And that's not so much because their process

22:46.480 --> 22:47.600
 was unintelligible,

22:47.600 --> 22:50.160
 but it was more just because no one had the language

22:50.160 --> 22:52.360
 with which to describe what optimal strategies were

22:52.360 --> 22:54.280
 because no one really understood how poker worked.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.560
 This was before, you know, we had analysis software,

22:57.560 --> 22:59.360
 you know, no one was writing,

22:59.360 --> 23:01.480
 I guess some people would write down their hands

23:01.480 --> 23:02.720
 in a little notebook,

23:02.720 --> 23:04.600
 but there was no way to assimilate all this data

23:04.600 --> 23:05.920
 and analyze it.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.480
 But then, you know, when computers became cheaper

23:08.480 --> 23:09.880
 and software started emerging

23:09.880 --> 23:11.440
 and then obviously online poker,

23:11.440 --> 23:14.200
 where it would like automatically save your hand histories,

23:14.200 --> 23:17.040
 now all of a sudden you kind of had this body of data

23:17.040 --> 23:19.560
 that you could run analysis on.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.120
 And so that's when people started to see, you know,

23:22.120 --> 23:27.120
 these mathematical solutions and so what that meant

23:28.600 --> 23:33.600
 is the role of intuition essentially became smaller.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.400
 And it went more into as we talked before

23:38.400 --> 23:40.600
 about, you know, this game theory optimal style.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.320
 But also as I said, like game theory optimal

23:43.320 --> 23:47.760
 is about loss minimization and being unexploitable.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.640
 But if you're playing against people who aren't,

23:49.640 --> 23:51.600
 because no person, no human being can play perfectly

23:51.600 --> 23:54.040
 game theory optimal in poker, not even the best AIs,

23:54.040 --> 23:57.200
 they're still like, they're 99.99% of the way there

23:57.200 --> 23:59.240
 or whatever, but it's kind of like speed of light,

23:59.240 --> 24:01.080
 you can't reach it perfectly.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.760
 So they're still a role for intuition?

24:03.760 --> 24:07.120
 Yes, so when, yeah, when you're playing

24:07.120 --> 24:09.960
 this unexploitable style, but when your opponents start

24:09.960 --> 24:12.560
 doing something, you know, suboptimal

24:12.560 --> 24:15.840
 that you want to exploit, well, now that's where

24:15.840 --> 24:18.120
 not only your like logical brain will need to be thinking,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.200
 well, okay, I know I have this,

24:20.200 --> 24:22.560
 I'm in the sort of top end of my range here with this,

24:22.560 --> 24:23.960
 with this hand.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.840
 So that means I need to be calling x% of the time

24:27.800 --> 24:30.480
 and I put them on this range, et cetera.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.000
 But then sometimes you'll have this gut feeling

24:34.000 --> 24:37.320
 that will tell you, you know, you know what, this time

24:37.320 --> 24:40.080
 I know, I know mathematically I meant to call now,

24:40.080 --> 24:42.720
 you know, I've got, I'm in the sort of top end of my range

24:42.720 --> 24:45.160
 and this is the odds I'm getting.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.480
 So the math says I should call, but there's something

24:47.480 --> 24:49.360
 in your gut saying they've got it this time,

24:49.360 --> 24:53.080
 they've got it like, they're beating you,

24:53.080 --> 24:55.200
 might be your hand is worse.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.720
 So then the real art, this is where the last remaining art

24:58.720 --> 25:03.680
 in poker, the fuzziness is like, do you listen to your gut?

25:03.680 --> 25:06.120
 How do you quantify the strength of it

25:06.120 --> 25:08.360
 or can you even quantify the strength of it?

25:08.360 --> 25:13.120
 And I think that's what Daniel has.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.360
 I mean, I can't speak for how much he's studying

25:15.360 --> 25:17.760
 with the simulators and that kind of thing.

25:17.760 --> 25:22.280
 I think he has, like he must be to still be keeping up,

25:22.280 --> 25:26.360
 but he has an incredible intuition for just,

25:26.360 --> 25:29.200
 he's seen so many hands of poker in the flesh.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.880
 He's seen so many people, the way they behave

25:31.880 --> 25:33.760
 when the chips are, you know, when the money's on the line

25:33.760 --> 25:36.120
 and he's got him staring you down in the eye,

25:36.120 --> 25:37.480
 you know, he's intimidating.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.640
 He's got this like kind of X factor vibe

25:39.640 --> 25:42.200
 that he, you know, gives out.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.040
 And he talks a lot, which is an interactive element,

25:45.040 --> 25:47.240
 which is he's getting stuff from other people.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.080
 Yes.

25:48.080 --> 25:48.920
 Yeah.

25:48.920 --> 25:49.760
 And just like the subtlety.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.480
 So he's like, he's probing constantly.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.920
 Yeah, he's probing and he's getting this extra layer

25:53.920 --> 25:55.960
 of information that others can't.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.960
 Now that said though, he's good online as well.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.640
 You know, I don't know how, again,

25:59.640 --> 26:02.720
 would he be beating the top cash game players online?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.960
 Probably not, no.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.320
 But when he's in person

26:07.320 --> 26:09.000
 and he's got that additional layer of information,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.720
 he can not only extract it,

26:10.720 --> 26:14.200
 but he knows what to do with it still so well.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.120
 There's one player who I would say is the exception

26:16.120 --> 26:17.120
 to all of this.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.960
 And he's one of my favorite people to talk about

26:19.960 --> 26:24.520
 in terms of, I think he might have cracked the simulation.

26:24.520 --> 26:28.040
 It's Phil Helmuth, he...

26:28.040 --> 26:29.120
 In more ways than one.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.560
 He's cracked the simulation, I think.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.560
 Yeah, he somehow to this day is still,

26:34.560 --> 26:37.320
 and I love you, Phil, I'm not in any way knocking you,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.480
 he's still winning so much

26:41.480 --> 26:43.920
 at the World Series of Pogo specifically.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.560
 He's now won 16 bracelets.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.520
 The next nearest person I think has won 10.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.280
 And he is consistently year in, year out,

26:50.280 --> 26:53.200
 going deep or winning these huge field tournaments.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.360
 You know, with like 2,000 people,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.840
 which statistically he should not be doing.

26:57.840 --> 27:02.760
 And yet, you watch some of the plays he makes

27:02.760 --> 27:04.120
 and they make no sense.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.760
 Like mathematically, they are so far

27:05.760 --> 27:07.600
 from game theory optimal.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.080
 And the thing is, if you went and stuck him

27:09.080 --> 27:11.440
 in one of these high stakes cash games

27:11.440 --> 27:13.280
 with a bunch of like GTO people,

27:13.280 --> 27:15.120
 he's gonna get ripped apart.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.600
 But there's something that he has

27:16.600 --> 27:17.560
 that when he's in the halls

27:17.560 --> 27:19.640
 of the World Series of Pogo specifically,

27:19.640 --> 27:23.880
 amongst sort of amateurish players,

27:23.880 --> 27:26.920
 he gets them to do crazy shit like that.

27:26.920 --> 27:31.000
 And, but my little pet theory is that also,

27:31.000 --> 27:35.160
 he just the car, he's like a wizard

27:35.160 --> 27:37.560
 and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to.

27:39.040 --> 27:42.840
 Because he just expects to win

27:42.840 --> 27:44.280
 and he expects to receive, you know,

27:44.280 --> 27:48.040
 to get flopper set with a frequency far beyond what this,

27:48.040 --> 27:50.840
 you know, the real percentages are.

27:50.840 --> 27:51.680
 And I don't even know

27:51.680 --> 27:52.640
 if he knows what the real percentages are.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.800
 He doesn't need to because he gets that.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.040
 I think he has found the Chico.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.440
 Because when I've seen him play,

27:57.440 --> 27:59.920
 he seems to be like annoyed

27:59.920 --> 28:02.000
 that the long shot thing didn't happen.

28:02.000 --> 28:02.920
 Yes.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.240
 He's like annoyed.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.520
 And it's almost like everybody else is stupid

28:06.520 --> 28:08.280
 because he was obviously going to win with this.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.600
 He's meant to win if that silly thing hadn't happened.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.520
 And it's like, you don't understand,

28:11.520 --> 28:14.000
 the silly thing happens 99% of the time.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.760
 And it's a 1%, not the other way round.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.600
 But genuinely, for his lived experience at the world's,

28:18.600 --> 28:21.560
 only at the world's, it is like that.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.040
 So I don't blame him for feeling that way.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.480
 But he does, he has this X factor

28:26.480 --> 28:29.960
 and the poker community has tried for years

28:29.960 --> 28:31.880
 to rip him down saying like, you know, he doesn't,

28:31.880 --> 28:33.720
 he's no good, but he's clearly good

28:33.720 --> 28:36.240
 because he's still winning or there's something going on.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.160
 Whether that's, he's figured out how to mess

28:39.160 --> 28:40.640
 with the fabric of reality

28:40.640 --> 28:42.600
 and how cards are, you know,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.320
 a randomly shuffled deck of cards come out.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.680
 I don't know what it is, but he's doing it right still.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.720
 Who do you think is the greatest of all time?

28:48.720 --> 28:49.880
 Would you put Hellmuth?

28:52.360 --> 28:54.720
 Now he's definitely, he seems like the kind of person

28:54.720 --> 28:56.520
 would mention he would actually watch this.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.360
 So you might want to be careful.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.800
 Well, as I said, I love Phil.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.480
 And I have, I would say this to his face.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.320
 I'm not saying anything.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.040
 I don't, he's got, he truly, I mean,

29:07.040 --> 29:09.560
 he is one of the greatest.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.000
 I don't know if he's the greatest.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.300
 He's certainly the greatest at the World Series of Poker.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.400
 And he is the greatest at,

29:16.400 --> 29:19.400
 despite the game switching into a pure game

29:19.400 --> 29:20.920
 or almost an entire game of math,

29:20.920 --> 29:22.840
 he has managed to keep the magic alive.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.000
 And there's like, just through sheer force of will

29:26.000 --> 29:27.600
 making the game work for him.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.660
 And that is incredible.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.480
 And I think it's something that should be studied

29:30.480 --> 29:32.000
 because it's an example.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.240
 Yeah, there might be some actual game theoretic wisdom.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.400
 There might be something to be said about optimality

29:37.400 --> 29:39.560
 from studying him, right?

29:39.560 --> 29:40.960
 What do you mean by optimality?

29:40.960 --> 29:45.560
 Meaning, or rather game design, perhaps.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.440
 Meaning if what he's doing is working,

29:48.440 --> 29:51.640
 maybe poker is more complicated

29:51.640 --> 29:54.200
 than we're currently modeling it as.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.040
 So like, yeah.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.640
 Or there's an extra layer,

29:56.640 --> 29:59.480
 and I don't mean to get too weird and wooey,

29:59.480 --> 30:04.640
 but, or there's an extra layer of ability

30:04.640 --> 30:07.520
 to manipulate the things the way you want them to go

30:07.520 --> 30:09.720
 that we don't understand yet.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.960
 Do you think Phil Helmuth understands them?

30:11.960 --> 30:13.600
 Is he just generally.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.760
 Hashtag positivity.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.200
 Well, he wrote a book on positivity, and he.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.040
 He has.

30:18.040 --> 30:18.880
 He did.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.400
 Not like a trolling book.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.240
 No.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.080
 A serious.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.800
 Straight up, yeah.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.040
 Phil Helmuth wrote a book about positivity.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.240
 Yes.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.080
 Okay.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.040
 About, I think, and I think it's about sort of manifesting

30:31.040 --> 30:34.140
 what you want and getting the outcomes that you want

30:34.140 --> 30:36.500
 by believing so much in yourself

30:36.500 --> 30:40.240
 and in your ability to win, like eyes on the prize.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.160
 And I mean, it's working.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.160
 The man's delivered.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.360
 But where do you put like Phil Ivy

30:45.360 --> 30:47.360
 and all those kinds of people?

30:47.360 --> 30:50.120
 I mean, I'm too, I've been, to be honest,

30:50.120 --> 30:50.960
 too much out of the scene

30:50.960 --> 30:52.640
 for the last few years to really,

30:53.760 --> 30:55.240
 I mean, Phil Ivy's clearly got, again,

30:55.240 --> 30:56.540
 he's got that X factor.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.400
 He's so incredibly intimidating to play against.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.760
 I've only played against him a couple of times,

31:01.760 --> 31:03.680
 but when he like looks you in the eye

31:03.680 --> 31:05.040
 and you're trying to run a bluff on him,

31:05.040 --> 31:07.160
 oof, no one's made me sweat harder than Phil Ivy.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.400
 Just my bluff got through, actually.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.840
 That was actually one of the most thrilling moments

31:11.840 --> 31:14.280
 I've ever had in poker was it was in a Monte Carlo

31:14.280 --> 31:15.480
 in a high roller.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.760
 I can't remember exactly what the hand was,

31:16.760 --> 31:19.520
 but I, you know, a three bit

31:19.520 --> 31:22.120
 and then like just barreled all the way through.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.400
 And he just like put his laser eyes into me.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.200
 And I felt like he was just scouring my soul.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.760
 And I was just like, hold it together, live,

31:29.760 --> 31:30.600
 hold it together.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.440
 And he was like, hold it.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.040
 You knew your hand was weaker.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.400
 Yeah. I mean, I was bluffing.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.360
 I presume, which, you know,

31:36.360 --> 31:37.720
 there's a chance I was bluffing with the best hand,

31:37.720 --> 31:39.800
 but I'm pretty sure my hand was worse.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.240
 And he folded.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.440
 I was truly one of the deep highlights of my career.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.000
 Did you show the cards or did you fall?

31:50.000 --> 31:50.840
 What is it?

31:50.840 --> 31:52.600
 You should never show in game.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.880
 Because especially as I felt like I was one

31:53.880 --> 31:55.680
 of the worst players at the table in that tournament.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.840
 So giving that information,

31:57.840 --> 31:59.840
 unless I had a really solid plan

31:59.840 --> 32:02.240
 that I was now like advertising or look,

32:02.240 --> 32:03.560
 I'm capable of bluffing Phil Ivy,

32:03.560 --> 32:06.680
 but like why, it's much more valuable

32:06.680 --> 32:09.000
 to take advantage of the impression that they have of me,

32:09.000 --> 32:10.200
 which is like, I'm a scared girl

32:10.200 --> 32:11.960
 playing a high roller for the first time.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.360
 Keep that going, you know.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.560
 Interesting.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.080
 But isn't there layers to this?

32:17.080 --> 32:20.320
 Like psychological warfare that the scared girl

32:21.320 --> 32:22.400
 might be way smart.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.680
 And then like just to flip the tables,

32:24.680 --> 32:26.000
 do you think about that kind of stuff?

32:26.000 --> 32:26.840
 Oh, definitely.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.480
 Is it better not to reveal information?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.480
 I mean, generally speaking,

32:29.480 --> 32:31.040
 you want to not reveal information.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.120
 You know, the goal of poker is to be as deceptive

32:34.120 --> 32:36.000
 as possible about your own strategies

32:36.000 --> 32:38.680
 while elucidating as much out of your opponent

32:38.680 --> 32:39.720
 about their own.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.080
 So giving them free information,

32:42.080 --> 32:42.920
 particularly if they're people

32:42.920 --> 32:44.800
 who you consider very good players,

32:44.800 --> 32:46.360
 any information I give them

32:46.360 --> 32:48.120
 is going into their little database

32:48.120 --> 32:51.760
 and I assume it's going to be calculated and used well.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.480
 So I have to be really confident

32:53.480 --> 32:56.720
 that my like meta gaming that I'm going to then do,

32:56.720 --> 32:58.320
 or they've seen this, so therefore that,

32:58.320 --> 33:00.640
 I'm going to be on the right level.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.400
 So it's better just to keep that little secret

33:03.400 --> 33:04.320
 to myself in the moment.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.720
 So how much is bluffing part of the game?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.360
 Huge amount.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.400
 So yeah, I mean, maybe actually, let me ask,

33:10.400 --> 33:13.000
 like what did it feel like with Phil Ivey

33:13.000 --> 33:15.040
 or anyone else when it's a high stake,

33:15.040 --> 33:18.840
 when it's a big, it's a big bluff.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.760
 So a lot of money on the table.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.640
 And maybe, I mean, what defines a big bluff?

33:24.640 --> 33:26.000
 Maybe a lot of money on the table,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.160
 but also some uncertainty in your mind and heart

33:29.160 --> 33:31.960
 about like self doubt,

33:31.960 --> 33:34.560
 well, maybe I miscalculated what's going on here,

33:34.560 --> 33:36.720
 what the bet said, all that kind of stuff.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.840
 Like what does that feel like?

33:38.840 --> 33:43.840
 I mean, it's, I imagine comparable to,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.840
 you know, running a, I mean,

33:47.840 --> 33:52.360
 any kind of big bluff where you have a lot of something

33:52.360 --> 33:54.640
 that you care about on the line, you know?

33:54.640 --> 33:57.240
 So if you're bluffing in a courtroom,

33:57.240 --> 33:58.160
 not that I didn't want to ever do that,

33:58.160 --> 34:01.520
 or something equatable to that, it's incredible.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.040
 You know, in that scenario, you know,

34:04.040 --> 34:05.680
 I think it was the first time I'd ever played a 20,

34:05.680 --> 34:09.160
 I'd won my way into this 25K tournament.

34:09.160 --> 34:11.160
 So that was the buy in, 25,000 euros.

34:11.160 --> 34:13.000
 And I had satelliteed my way in

34:13.000 --> 34:16.080
 because it was much bigger than I would ever normally play.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.160
 And, you know, I hadn't,

34:17.160 --> 34:18.720
 I wasn't that experienced at the time.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.240
 And now I was sitting there against all the big boys,

34:21.240 --> 34:23.600
 you know, the Nogranos, the Phil Ivey's and so on.

34:23.600 --> 34:28.600
 And then to like, each time you put the bets out,

34:30.360 --> 34:33.000
 you know, you put another bet out, your card.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.880
 Yeah, I was on a, what's called a semi bluff.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.320
 So there were some cards that could come

34:36.320 --> 34:39.200
 that would make my hand very, very strong and therefore win,

34:39.200 --> 34:40.960
 but most of the time those cards don't come.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.640
 So that is a semi bluff because you're representing,

34:43.640 --> 34:46.960
 what are you representing that you already have something?

34:47.880 --> 34:52.160
 So I think in this scenario, I had a flush draw to,

34:52.160 --> 34:55.920
 so I had two clubs, two clubs came out on the flop,

34:55.920 --> 34:58.080
 and then I'm hoping that on the turn and the river,

34:58.080 --> 34:59.120
 one will come.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.960
 So I have some future equity.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.760
 I could hit a club and then I'll have the best hand

35:02.760 --> 35:04.600
 in which case, great.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.480
 And so I can keep betting and I'll want them to call,

35:07.480 --> 35:09.640
 but I'm also got the other way of winning the hand

35:09.640 --> 35:11.920
 where if my card doesn't come,

35:11.920 --> 35:14.720
 I can keep betting and get them to fold their hand.

35:14.720 --> 35:18.040
 And I'm pretty sure that's what the scenario was.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.040
 So I had some future equity, but it's still, you know,

35:21.040 --> 35:23.280
 most of the time I don't hit that club.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.320
 And so I'd rather him just fold

35:25.320 --> 35:27.800
 because the pot is now getting bigger and bigger.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.000
 And in the end, like I jam all in on the river,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.680
 that's my entire tournament on the line.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.160
 As far as I'm aware, this might be the one time

35:35.160 --> 35:37.200
 I ever get to play a big 25K.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.680
 You know, this was the first time I played one.

35:38.680 --> 35:42.000
 So it was, it felt like the most momentous thing.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.800
 And this was also when I was trying to build myself up,

35:43.800 --> 35:46.680
 you know, build my name, a name for myself in poker.

35:46.680 --> 35:47.720
 I wanted to get respect.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.280
 Destroy everything for you.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.520
 It felt like it in the moment.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.760
 Like, I mean, it literally does feel

35:51.760 --> 35:52.800
 like a form of life and death.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.360
 Like your body physiologically

35:54.360 --> 35:55.880
 is having that flight or fight response.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.120
 What are you doing with your body?

35:57.120 --> 35:58.240
 What are you doing with your face?

35:58.240 --> 36:01.360
 Are you just like, what are you thinking about?

36:02.720 --> 36:04.760
 Well, a mixture of like, okay, what are the cards?

36:04.760 --> 36:07.080
 So in theory, I'm thinking about like, okay,

36:07.080 --> 36:10.040
 what are cards that make my hand look stronger?

36:10.040 --> 36:13.880
 Which cards hit my perceived range from his perspective?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.680
 Which cards don't?

36:15.680 --> 36:18.320
 What's the right amount of bet size to, you know,

36:18.320 --> 36:20.840
 maximize my fold equity in this situation?

36:20.840 --> 36:22.120
 You know, that's the logical stuff

36:22.120 --> 36:23.240
 that I should be thinking about.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.440
 But I think in reality, because I was so scared,

36:25.440 --> 36:26.920
 because there's this, at least for me,

36:26.920 --> 36:30.440
 there's a certain threshold of like nervousness or stress

36:30.440 --> 36:33.440
 beyond which the like logical brain shuts off.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.240
 And now it just gets into this like,

36:36.600 --> 36:38.800
 it just like, it feels like a game of wits basically.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.840
 It's like, of nerve.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.800
 Can you hold your resolve?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.320
 And it certainly got by that, like by the river.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.840
 I think by that point, I was like,

36:45.840 --> 36:47.720
 I don't even know if this is a good bluff anymore,

36:47.720 --> 36:49.960
 but fuck it, let's do it.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.280
 Your mind is almost numb

36:51.280 --> 36:53.160
 from the intensity of that feeling.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.160
 I call it the white noise.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.920
 And that's, and it happens in all kinds of decision making.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.800
 I think anything that's really, really stressful.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.960
 Like I can imagine someone in like an important job interview,

37:02.960 --> 37:04.800
 if it's like a job they've always wanted

37:04.800 --> 37:06.560
 and they're getting grilled, you know,

37:06.560 --> 37:09.240
 like Bridgewater style where they ask these really hard,

37:09.240 --> 37:11.200
 like mathematical questions.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.440
 You know, that's, it's a really learned skill

37:13.440 --> 37:17.840
 to be able to like subdue your flight or fight response,

37:17.840 --> 37:19.400
 you know, what I think get from the sympathetic

37:19.400 --> 37:20.360
 into the parasympathetic.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.080
 So you can actually, you know,

37:22.080 --> 37:24.200
 engage that voice in your head

37:24.200 --> 37:26.040
 and do those slow logical calculations.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.360
 Cause evolutionarily, we, you know,

37:28.360 --> 37:29.680
 if we see a lion running at us,

37:29.680 --> 37:31.680
 we didn't have time to sort of calculate

37:31.680 --> 37:34.000
 the lion's kinetic energy and, you know,

37:34.000 --> 37:35.480
 is it optimal to go this way or that way?

37:35.480 --> 37:37.080
 You just react it.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.880
 And physically, our bodies are well attuned

37:39.880 --> 37:41.160
 to actually make right decisions.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.280
 But when you're playing a game like poker,

37:43.280 --> 37:44.800
 this is not something that you ever, you know,

37:44.800 --> 37:45.960
 evolved to do.

37:45.960 --> 37:49.000
 And yet you're in that same flight or fight response.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.080
 And so that's a really important skill

37:51.080 --> 37:52.520
 to be able to develop to basically learn

37:52.520 --> 37:54.920
 how to like meditate in the moment

37:54.920 --> 37:57.440
 and calm yourself so that you can think clearly.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.840
 But as you were searching for a comparable thing,

38:00.840 --> 38:03.360
 it's interesting cause you just made me realize

38:03.360 --> 38:06.000
 that bluffing is like an incredibly

38:06.000 --> 38:08.240
 high stakes form of lying.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.680
 You're lying.

38:10.800 --> 38:11.640
 And I don't think you can...

38:11.640 --> 38:13.360
 You're telling a story.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.280
 No, no, it's straight up lying.

38:15.280 --> 38:19.120
 In the context of game, it's not a negative kind of lying.

38:19.120 --> 38:19.960
 But it is, yeah, exactly.

38:19.960 --> 38:23.400
 You're representing something that you don't have.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.480
 And I was thinking like,

38:24.480 --> 38:29.480
 in how often in life do we have such high stakes of lying?

38:30.360 --> 38:35.360
 Cause I was thinking certainly in high level military

38:35.560 --> 38:40.320
 strategy, I was thinking when Hitler was lying to Stalin

38:40.320 --> 38:44.600
 about his plans to invade the Soviet Union.

38:44.600 --> 38:48.320
 And so you're talking to a person like your friends

38:48.320 --> 38:50.720
 and you're fighting against the enemy,

38:50.720 --> 38:53.920
 whatever the formulation of the enemy is.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.800
 But meanwhile, the whole time you're building up troops

38:56.800 --> 38:57.640
 on the border.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.760
 That's extremely...

38:59.760 --> 39:01.840
 Wait, wait, so Hitler and Stalin were like pretending

39:01.840 --> 39:02.680
 to be friends?

39:02.680 --> 39:04.240
 Well, my history knowledge is terrible.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
 That's crazy.

39:05.240 --> 39:09.520
 Yeah, that they were, yeah, man.

39:09.520 --> 39:13.840
 And it worked because Stalin until the troops crossed

39:13.840 --> 39:17.560
 the border and invaded in Operation Barbarossa

39:17.560 --> 39:22.560
 where this storm of Nazi troops invaded

39:23.560 --> 39:25.160
 large parts of the Soviet Union.

39:25.160 --> 39:30.160
 And hence one of the biggest wars in human history began.

39:30.400 --> 39:34.960
 Stalin for sure was thought that this was never going to be,

39:34.960 --> 39:38.680
 that Hitler is not crazy enough to invade the Soviet Union.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.840
 That it makes geopolitically makes total sense

39:41.840 --> 39:43.080
 to be collaborators.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.320
 And ideologically, even though there's a tension

39:46.320 --> 39:50.360
 between communism and fascism or national socialism,

39:50.360 --> 39:53.280
 however you formulated, it still feels like

39:53.280 --> 39:55.840
 this is the right way to battle the West.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.760
 Right, they were more ideologically aligned.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.440
 They in theory had a common enemy, which is the West.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.520
 So it made total sense.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.080
 And in terms of negotiations and the way things

40:06.080 --> 40:11.080
 were communicated, it seemed to Stalin that for sure

40:11.560 --> 40:16.120
 that they would remain at least for a while

40:16.120 --> 40:17.680
 peaceful collaborators.

40:17.680 --> 40:22.240
 And everybody, because of that in the Soviet Union,

40:22.240 --> 40:25.840
 believe that it was a huge shock when Kiev was invaded.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.240
 And you hear echoes of that when I traveled to Ukraine

40:28.240 --> 40:32.240
 sort of the shock of the invasion.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.560
 It's not just the invasion on one particular border,

40:34.560 --> 40:36.720
 but the invasion of the capital city.

40:36.720 --> 40:41.400
 And just like, holy shit, especially at that time

40:41.400 --> 40:44.240
 when you thought World War I,

40:44.240 --> 40:46.960
 you realized that that was the war to end all wars.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.000
 You would never have this kind of war.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.400
 And holy shit, this person is mad enough

40:52.400 --> 40:56.320
 to try to take on this monster in the Soviet Union.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.760
 So it's no longer going to be a war of hundreds

40:58.760 --> 40:59.880
 of thousands dead.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.280
 It'll be a war of tens of millions dead.

41:02.280 --> 41:07.280
 And yeah, but that's a very large scale kind of lie,

41:08.320 --> 41:11.480
 but I'm sure there's in politics and geopolitics

41:11.480 --> 41:13.960
 that kind of lying happening all the time.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.280
 And a lot of people pay financially

41:17.280 --> 41:19.080
 and with their lives for that kind of lying.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.280
 But in our personal lives, I don't know how often we,

41:22.280 --> 41:23.120
 maybe we...

41:23.120 --> 41:23.960
 I think people do.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.120
 I mean, like think of spouses cheating on their partners,

41:27.120 --> 41:27.960
 right?

41:27.960 --> 41:28.780
 And then like having to lie like,

41:28.780 --> 41:29.620
 where were you last night?

41:29.620 --> 41:30.460
 Stuff like that.

41:30.460 --> 41:33.720
 Like that's, I think, you know,

41:33.720 --> 41:35.720
 I mean, unfortunately that stuff happens all the time, right?

41:35.720 --> 41:36.560
 So...

41:36.560 --> 41:38.800
 Or having like multiple families, that one is great.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.280
 When each family doesn't know about the other one

41:42.280 --> 41:44.640
 and like maintaining that life,

41:44.640 --> 41:47.280
 there's probably a sense of excitement about that too.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.760
 Seems unnecessary, yeah.

41:50.760 --> 41:51.760
 But why?

41:51.760 --> 41:54.240
 Well, just lying, like, you know,

41:54.240 --> 41:56.800
 the truth finds a way of coming out, you know?

41:56.800 --> 41:59.280
 Yes, but hence that's the thrill.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.880
 Yeah, perhaps, yeah, people.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.240
 I mean, you know, that's why I think actually like poker,

42:04.240 --> 42:08.640
 what's so interesting about poker is most of the best

42:08.640 --> 42:10.880
 players I know, they're always exceptions, you know,

42:10.880 --> 42:12.460
 they're always bad eggs,

42:12.460 --> 42:15.140
 but actually poker players are very honest people.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.560
 I would say they are more honest than the average,

42:17.560 --> 42:22.360
 you know, if you just took random population sample.

42:22.360 --> 42:26.120
 Because A, you know, I think, you know,

42:26.120 --> 42:27.600
 humans like to have that.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.600
 Most people like to have some kind of, you know,

42:30.600 --> 42:32.760
 mysterious, you know, an opportunity to do something

42:32.760 --> 42:34.920
 like a little edgy.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.520
 So we get to sort of scratch that itch of being edgy

42:37.520 --> 42:40.480
 at the poker table where it's like, it's part of the game.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.440
 Everyone knows what they're in for and that's allowed.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.320
 And you get to like really get that out of your system.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.280
 And then also like poker players learned that, you know,

42:51.280 --> 42:55.440
 I would play in a huge game against some of my friends,

42:55.440 --> 42:57.800
 even my partner Igor, where we will be, you know,

42:57.800 --> 42:59.720
 absolutely going at each other's throats,

42:59.720 --> 43:02.120
 trying to draw blood in terms of winning each money

43:02.120 --> 43:04.080
 off each other and like getting under each other's skin,

43:04.080 --> 43:08.400
 winding each other up, doing the craftiest moves we can.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.160
 But then once the game's done, the, you know,

43:11.160 --> 43:12.800
 the winners and the losers will go off and get a drink

43:12.800 --> 43:15.240
 together and have a fun time and like talk about it

43:15.240 --> 43:17.320
 in this like weird academic way afterwards.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.560
 Because that, and that's why games are so great.

43:19.560 --> 43:24.040
 Cause you get to like live out or like this competitive urge

43:24.040 --> 43:26.440
 that, you know, most people have.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.720
 What's it feel like to lose?

43:28.720 --> 43:31.400
 Like we talked about bluffing when it worked out.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.560
 What about when you, when you go broke?

43:35.400 --> 43:37.200
 So like in a game, I'm, you know,

43:37.200 --> 43:39.160
 fortunately I've never gone broke.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.880
 You mean in like full life?

43:40.880 --> 43:42.480
 Full life, no.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.240
 I know plenty of people who have.

43:46.800 --> 43:47.840
 And I don't think Igor would mind me saying,

43:47.840 --> 43:49.960
 he went, you know, he went broke once in poker bowl,

43:49.960 --> 43:51.840
 you know, early on when we were together.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.320
 I feel like you haven't lived unless you've gone broke.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.640
 Oh, yeah.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.480
 In some sense.

43:56.480 --> 43:57.320
 Right.

43:57.320 --> 43:58.160
 It's a fundamental sense.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.000
 I mean, I'm happy.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.880
 I've sort of lived through it vicariously through him

44:00.880 --> 44:02.360
 when he did it at the time.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.160
 But yeah, what's it like to lose?

44:04.160 --> 44:05.000
 Well, it depends.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.040
 So it depends on the amount.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.680
 It depends what percentage of your net worth

44:07.680 --> 44:08.640
 you've just lost.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.560
 It depends on your brain chemistry.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.200
 It really, you know, varies from person to person.

44:13.200 --> 44:16.920
 You have a very cold calculating way of thinking about this.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.000
 So it depends what percentage you have.

44:19.000 --> 44:19.840
 Well, it did.

44:19.840 --> 44:20.680
 It really does, right?

44:20.680 --> 44:21.520
 Yeah, it's true.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.760
 But that's, I mean, that's another thing

44:23.760 --> 44:24.720
 poker trains you to do.

44:24.720 --> 44:28.080
 You see, you see everything in percentages

44:28.080 --> 44:29.640
 or you see everything in like ROI

44:29.640 --> 44:32.400
 or expected hourly's or cost benefit, et cetera.

44:32.400 --> 44:37.200
 You know, so that's, one of the things I've tried to do

44:37.200 --> 44:39.800
 is calibrate the strength of my emotional response

44:39.800 --> 44:43.400
 to the win or loss that I've received.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.520
 Because it's no good if you like, you know,

44:45.520 --> 44:49.440
 you have a huge emotional dramatic response to a tiny loss.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.600
 Or on the flip side, you have a huge win

44:52.600 --> 44:55.000
 and you're sort of dead inside that you don't even feel it.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.400
 Well, that's, you know, that's a shame.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.840
 I want my emotions to calibrate with reality

44:59.840 --> 45:01.080
 as much as possible.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.800
 So yeah, what's it like to lose?

45:03.800 --> 45:06.840
 I mean, I've had times where I've lost, you know,

45:06.840 --> 45:08.640
 busted out of a tournament that I thought I was going to win in.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.160
 You know, especially if I got really unlucky

45:10.160 --> 45:14.320
 or I make a dumb play where I've gone away

45:14.320 --> 45:17.840
 and like, you know, kicked the wall, punched a wall.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.560
 I like nearly broke my hand one time.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.680
 Like I'm a lot less competitive than I used to be.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.200
 Like I was like pathologically competitive

45:26.200 --> 45:28.320
 in my like late teens, early twenties.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.480
 I just had to win at everything.

45:30.480 --> 45:33.200
 And I think that sort of slowly waned as I've gotten older.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.480
 According to you, yeah.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.240
 According to me.

45:35.240 --> 45:38.120
 I don't know if others would say the same, right?

45:38.120 --> 45:40.480
 I feel like ultra competitive people,

45:40.480 --> 45:42.640
 like I've heard Joroh can say this to me.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.040
 It's like, he's a lot less competitive than he used to be.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.000
 I don't know about that.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.240
 Oh, I believe it.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.200
 No, I totally believe it.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.560
 Like, because as you get, you can still be like,

45:51.560 --> 45:52.960
 I care about winning.

45:52.960 --> 45:55.960
 Like when, you know, I play a game with my buddies online

45:55.960 --> 45:57.080
 or, you know, whatever it is,

45:57.080 --> 45:58.680
 polytopia is my current obsession.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.720
 Like, when I...

46:00.720 --> 46:02.840
 Thank you for passing on your obsession to me.

46:02.840 --> 46:03.640
 Are you playing now?

46:03.640 --> 46:04.640
 Yeah, I'm playing now.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.760
 We're going to have a game.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.000
 But I'm terrible and I enjoy playing terribly.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.040
 I don't want to have a game

46:09.040 --> 46:11.320
 because that's going to pull me into your monster

46:11.320 --> 46:13.760
 of like competitive play.

46:13.760 --> 46:14.600
 It's important.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.280
 It's an important skill.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.200
 I'm enjoying playing on the...

46:17.200 --> 46:18.200
 I can't...

46:18.200 --> 46:20.880
 You just do the points thing, you know, against the bots.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
 Yeah, against the bots.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.840
 And I can't even do the...

46:24.840 --> 46:26.920
 There's like a hard one and there's a very hard one.

46:26.920 --> 46:27.760
 And then it's crazy, yeah.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.600
 It's crazy.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.840
 I don't even enjoy the hard one.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.960
 The crazy I really don't enjoy.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.600
 Because it's intense.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.920
 You have to constantly try to win

46:34.920 --> 46:37.920
 as opposed to enjoy building a little world and...

46:37.920 --> 46:40.000
 Yeah, no, no, there's no time for exploration of polytopia.

46:40.000 --> 46:40.680
 You've got to get...

46:40.680 --> 46:42.680
 Well, once you graduate from the crazies,

46:42.680 --> 46:44.480
 then you can come play the...

46:44.480 --> 46:46.400
 Graduate from the crazies.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.960
 Yeah, in order to be able to play a decent game against,

46:48.960 --> 46:51.640
 like, you know, our group,

46:51.640 --> 46:55.640
 you'll need to be consistently winning

46:55.640 --> 46:58.280
 like 90% of games against 15 crazy bots.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.120
 Yeah.

46:59.120 --> 46:59.840
 And you'll be able to...

46:59.840 --> 47:03.320
 Like, I could teach you it within a day, honestly.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.640
 How to beat the crazies?

47:04.640 --> 47:05.680
 How to beat the crazies.

47:05.680 --> 47:08.120
 And then you'll be ready for the big leagues.

47:08.120 --> 47:11.040
 Generalizes to more than just polytopia.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.280
 But okay, why were we talking about polytopia?

47:14.280 --> 47:15.840
 Losing hurts.

47:15.840 --> 47:16.960
 Losing hurts. Oh, yeah.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.240
 Yes, competitiveness over time.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
 Oh, yeah.

47:20.240 --> 47:23.240
 I think it's more that, at least for me,

47:23.240 --> 47:26.360
 I still care about winning when I choose to play something.

47:26.360 --> 47:31.960
 It's just that I don't see the world as zero some as I used to be, you know?

47:31.960 --> 47:34.840
 I think as you one gets older and wiser,

47:34.840 --> 47:37.960
 you start to see the world more as a positive something.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.720
 Or at least you're more aware of externalities

47:40.720 --> 47:44.160
 of scenarios, of competitive interactions.

47:44.160 --> 47:50.080
 And so, yeah, I'm more aware of my own, you know, like,

47:50.080 --> 47:52.720
 if I have a really strong emotional response to losing,

47:52.720 --> 47:54.920
 and that makes me then feel shitty for the rest of the day.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.160
 And then I beat myself up mentally for it.

47:57.160 --> 48:01.600
 Like, I'm now more aware that that's unnecessary negative externality.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.840
 So I'm like, okay, I need to find a way to turn this down,

48:03.840 --> 48:05.200
 you know, dial this down a bit.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.520
 Was poker the thing that has...

48:07.520 --> 48:09.600
 If you think back at your life

48:09.600 --> 48:12.080
 and think about some of the lower points of your life,

48:12.080 --> 48:14.880
 like the darker places you've gone in your mind,

48:14.880 --> 48:16.960
 did it have to do something with poker?

48:16.960 --> 48:23.440
 Like, did losing spark the descent into darkness,

48:23.440 --> 48:24.800
 or was it something else?

48:24.800 --> 48:29.360
 Um, I think my darkest points in poker

48:29.360 --> 48:34.320
 were when I was wanting to quit and move on to other things.

48:34.320 --> 48:39.600
 But I felt like I hadn't ticked all the boxes I wanted to tick.

48:39.600 --> 48:43.600
 Like, I wanted to be the most winningest female player,

48:43.600 --> 48:45.680
 which is by itself a bad goal.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.840
 Um, you know, that was one of my initial goals,

48:47.840 --> 48:48.640
 and I was like, well, I haven't...

48:48.640 --> 48:50.800
 You know, and I wanted to win a WPT event.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.000
 I've won one of these, I've won one of these,

48:52.000 --> 48:53.520
 but I won one of those as well.

48:53.520 --> 48:57.360
 And that sort of, again, like,

48:57.360 --> 48:59.040
 is a drive of, like, overoptimization

48:59.040 --> 49:01.360
 to random metrics that I decided were important,

49:02.320 --> 49:03.760
 without much wisdom at the time,

49:03.760 --> 49:04.800
 but then, like, carried on.

49:04.800 --> 49:09.520
 Um, that made me continue chasing it longer

49:09.520 --> 49:12.160
 than I still actually had the passion to chase it for.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.600
 And I don't have any regrets that, you know,

49:15.600 --> 49:17.440
 I played for as long as I did, because who knows,

49:17.440 --> 49:19.120
 you know, I wouldn't be sitting here,

49:19.120 --> 49:20.880
 I wouldn't be living this incredible life

49:20.880 --> 49:22.000
 that I'm living now.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.640
 Um, this is the height of your life right now.

49:24.640 --> 49:26.640
 This is it, peak experience.

49:26.640 --> 49:30.880
 Absolute pinnacle here in your robot land.

49:30.880 --> 49:31.760
 Yeah, yeah.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.360
 With your creepy light.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.880
 No, it is.

49:34.880 --> 49:38.160
 I mean, I wouldn't change a thing about my life right now,

49:38.160 --> 49:39.520
 and I feel very blessed to say that.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.800
 So, but the dark times were in the sort of, like,

49:44.800 --> 49:48.720
 2016 to 18, even sooner, really,

49:48.720 --> 49:52.000
 where I was like, I had stopped loving the game,

49:52.960 --> 49:54.240
 and I was going through the motions.

49:55.360 --> 49:59.360
 And I would, and then I was like,

49:59.360 --> 50:00.720
 you know, I would take the loss as harder

50:00.720 --> 50:02.480
 than I needed to, because I'm like,

50:02.480 --> 50:03.280
 oh, it's another one.

50:03.280 --> 50:04.720
 And it was, I was aware that, like,

50:04.720 --> 50:06.080
 I felt like my life was ticking away,

50:06.080 --> 50:07.840
 and I was like, is this going to be what's on my tombstone?

50:07.840 --> 50:09.440
 Oh, yeah, she played the game of, you know,

50:09.440 --> 50:10.880
 this zero sum game of poker,

50:11.600 --> 50:13.360
 slightly more optimally than her next opponent.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.240
 Like, cool, great legacy, you know.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.520
 I just wanted, you know, there was something in me

50:19.520 --> 50:20.880
 that knew I needed to be doing something

50:21.600 --> 50:25.120
 more directly impactful, and just meaningful.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.160
 It was just like a search for meaning,

50:26.160 --> 50:27.760
 and I think it's a thing a lot of poker players,

50:27.760 --> 50:32.960
 even a lot of, I imagine any games players who sort of love

50:32.960 --> 50:36.160
 intellectual pursuits, you know,

50:36.160 --> 50:38.000
 I think you should ask Magnus Carlson this question.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.680
 Yeah, walking away from chess, right?

50:39.680 --> 50:41.360
 Yeah, like, it must be so hard for him.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.960
 You know, he's been on the top for so long,

50:43.680 --> 50:45.120
 and it's like, well, now what?

50:45.120 --> 50:48.240
 He's got this incredible brain, like, what to put it to.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.000
 And yeah, it's...

50:52.000 --> 50:54.720
 It's this weird moment where I was just

50:54.720 --> 50:57.680
 spoken with people that won multiple gold medals at the Olympics,

50:58.320 --> 51:01.200
 and the depression hits hard after you win.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.000
 Don't come in crash.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.720
 Because it's a kind of a goodbye, saying goodbye to that person

51:06.720 --> 51:11.120
 to all the dreams you had that you thought would give meaning

51:11.120 --> 51:11.760
 to your life.

51:11.760 --> 51:16.720
 But in fact, life is full of constant pursuits of meaning.

51:16.720 --> 51:17.680
 It doesn't...

51:17.680 --> 51:20.160
 You don't, like, arrive and figure it all out,

51:20.160 --> 51:21.600
 and there's endless bliss.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.920
 Now it continues going on and on.

51:23.920 --> 51:27.680
 You constantly have to figure out to rediscover yourself.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.800
 And so for you, like, that struggle to say goodbye to poker,

51:31.440 --> 51:33.600
 you have to, like, find the next...

51:33.600 --> 51:34.800
 There's always a bigger game.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.520
 That's the thing.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.480
 That's my motto.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.400
 It's like, what's the next game?

51:38.400 --> 51:41.600
 And more importantly, because obviously,

51:41.600 --> 51:43.040
 game usually implies zero sum.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.840
 Like, what's the game which is, like, OmniWin?

51:46.400 --> 51:46.960
 Look, what?

51:46.960 --> 51:47.440
 OmniWin.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.000
 OmniWin.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.920
 Why is OmniWin so important?

51:49.920 --> 51:54.000
 Because if everyone plays zero sum games,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.200
 that's a fast track to either completely stagnate as a civilization,

51:57.200 --> 52:00.400
 but more actually far more likely to extinct ourselves.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.600
 You know, like, the playing field is finite.

52:04.240 --> 52:09.200
 You know, nuclear powers are playing, you know,

52:09.200 --> 52:13.200
 a game of poker with their chips of nuclear weapons, right?

52:13.760 --> 52:16.320
 And the stakes have gotten so large

52:16.320 --> 52:18.560
 that if anyone makes a single bet, you know,

52:18.560 --> 52:21.840
 fires some weapons, the playing field breaks.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.720
 I made a video on this.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.160
 Like, you know, the playing field is finite.

52:26.720 --> 52:30.240
 And if we keep playing these adversarial zero sum games,

52:31.360 --> 52:33.840
 thinking that in order for us to win,

52:33.840 --> 52:35.200
 someone else has to lose.

52:35.200 --> 52:39.120
 Or if we lose that someone else wins, that will extinct us.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.040
 It's just a matter of when.

52:41.040 --> 52:44.080
 What do you think about that mutually assured destruction?

52:44.080 --> 52:49.120
 That very simple, almost to the point of caricaturing game theory idea

52:49.120 --> 52:54.240
 that does seem to be at the core of why we haven't blown each other up yet with nuclear weapons.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.560
 Do you think there's some truth to that?

52:56.560 --> 53:00.800
 This kind of stabilizing force of mutually assured destruction?

53:00.800 --> 53:05.920
 And do you think that's going to hold up through the 21st century?

53:06.480 --> 53:09.680
 I mean, it has held, yes.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.880
 There's definitely truth to it that it was a, you know,

53:12.880 --> 53:14.560
 it's a Nash equilibrium.

53:14.560 --> 53:16.480
 Yeah, are you surprised it held this long?

53:17.040 --> 53:17.760
 Isn't it crazy?

53:18.320 --> 53:21.120
 It is crazy when you factor in all the, like,

53:21.120 --> 53:23.600
 near miss accidental firings.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.280
 Yes.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.360
 That makes me wonder, like, you know,

53:27.920 --> 53:30.960
 you're familiar with the, like, quantum suicide thought experiment,

53:30.960 --> 53:33.360
 where it's basically like you have a,

53:34.560 --> 53:40.480
 you know, like a Russian roulette type scenario hooked up to some kind of quantum event,

53:40.480 --> 53:45.760
 you know, particle splitting or periparticle splitting.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.320
 And if it, you know, if it goes A,

53:48.320 --> 53:50.080
 then the gun doesn't go off and it goes B,

53:50.080 --> 53:51.280
 then it does go off and it kills you.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.880
 Because you can only ever be in the universe,

53:54.880 --> 53:56.560
 you know, assuming like the Everett branch, you know,

53:56.560 --> 54:00.080
 multiverse theory, you'll always only end up in the branch

54:00.080 --> 54:03.200
 where you continually make, you know, option A comes in.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.280
 But you run that experiment enough times,

54:05.280 --> 54:09.200
 it starts getting pretty damn, you know, out of the tree gets huge.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.800
 There's a million different scenarios,

54:10.800 --> 54:12.400
 but you'll always find yourself in this,

54:12.400 --> 54:14.000
 in the one where it didn't go off.

54:14.800 --> 54:20.000
 And so from that perspective, you are essentially immortal,

54:20.640 --> 54:22.560
 because someone, and you will only find yourself

54:22.560 --> 54:24.960
 in the set of observers that make it down that path.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.040
 Yeah.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.480
 So it's, it's kind of.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.880
 That doesn't mean, that doesn't mean you're,

54:30.880 --> 54:33.040
 you're still not going to be fucked at some point in your life.

54:33.040 --> 54:33.520
 No, of course not.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.800
 No, I'm not, I'm not advocating,

54:34.800 --> 54:36.400
 like we're all immortal because of this.

54:36.400 --> 54:38.400
 It's just like a fun thought experiment.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.640
 And the point is it like raises this thing of like these things

54:40.640 --> 54:43.120
 called observer selection effects, which Bostrom,

54:43.120 --> 54:44.400
 and Nick Bostrom talks about a lot,

54:44.400 --> 54:45.360
 and I think people should go read.

54:46.080 --> 54:46.800
 It's really powerful,

54:46.800 --> 54:48.800
 but I think it could be overextended that logic.

54:48.800 --> 54:52.160
 I'm not sure exactly how it can be.

54:52.160 --> 54:55.120
 I just feel like you can get,

54:55.120 --> 54:58.240
 you can overgeneralize that logic somehow.

54:58.240 --> 55:00.560
 Well, no, I mean, it leads you into like solipsism,

55:00.560 --> 55:02.080
 which is a very dangerous mindset.

55:02.080 --> 55:04.240
 Again, if everyone like falls into solipsism of like,

55:04.240 --> 55:05.120
 well, I'll be fine.

55:05.120 --> 55:07.840
 I mean, that's a great way of creating a very,

55:07.840 --> 55:10.160
 you know, self terminating environment.

55:10.160 --> 55:13.520
 But my point is, is that with the nuclear weapons thing,

55:14.480 --> 55:16.880
 there have been at least, I think it's 12 or 11,

55:18.480 --> 55:20.960
 near misses of like just stupid things.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.160
 Like there was moonrise over Norway,

55:24.160 --> 55:27.520
 and it made weird reflections of some glaciers in the mountains,

55:27.520 --> 55:30.720
 which set off, I think, the alarms of NORAD,

55:30.720 --> 55:35.600
 NORAD radar, and that put them on high alert, nearly ready to shoot.

55:35.600 --> 55:39.600
 And it was only because the head of Russian military

55:39.600 --> 55:41.840
 happened to be at the UN in New York at the time,

55:41.840 --> 55:43.280
 that they go like, well, wait a second,

55:43.280 --> 55:46.960
 why would they fire now when their guy is there?

55:46.960 --> 55:49.120
 And it was only that lucky happenstance,

55:49.120 --> 55:50.080
 which doesn't happen very often,

55:50.080 --> 55:51.920
 where they didn't then escalate it into firing.

55:51.920 --> 55:53.760
 And there's a bunch of these different ones.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.560
 Stanislav Petrov, like saved the person

55:56.560 --> 55:57.840
 who should be the most famous person on earth,

55:57.840 --> 55:59.520
 because he's probably on expectations,

55:59.520 --> 56:01.120
 saved the most human lives of anyone,

56:01.120 --> 56:05.200
 like billions of people by ignoring Russian orders to fire,

56:05.200 --> 56:07.360
 because he felt in his gut that actually this was a false alarm,

56:07.360 --> 56:09.840
 and it turned out to be, you know, very hard thing to do.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.480
 And there's so many of those scenarios

56:12.480 --> 56:14.400
 that I can't help but wonder at this point,

56:14.400 --> 56:17.760
 that we aren't having this kind of like selection effect thing going on,

56:17.760 --> 56:19.600
 because you look back and you're like, geez,

56:19.600 --> 56:20.720
 that's a lot of near misses.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.720
 But of course, we don't know the actual probabilities

56:22.720 --> 56:24.720
 that they would have lent each one would have ended up in nuclear war.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.000
 Maybe they were not that likely.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.720
 But still, the point is, it's a very dark,

56:28.720 --> 56:30.000
 stupid game that we're playing.

56:30.880 --> 56:35.360
 And it is an absolute moral imperative, if you ask me,

56:35.360 --> 56:37.200
 to get as many people thinking about ways

56:37.200 --> 56:39.440
 to make this like very precarious,

56:39.440 --> 56:41.040
 because we're in a Nash equilibrium,

56:41.040 --> 56:42.720
 but it's not like we're in the bottom of a pit.

56:42.720 --> 56:45.280
 You know, if you would like map it topographically,

56:46.320 --> 56:48.240
 it's not like a stable ball at the bottom of a thing.

56:48.240 --> 56:49.360
 We're not in equilibrium because of that.

56:49.360 --> 56:52.320
 We're on the top of a hill with a ball balanced on top,

56:52.320 --> 56:54.960
 and just any little nudge could send it flying down,

56:54.960 --> 56:58.640
 and, you know, nuclear war pops off and hellfire and bad times.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.120
 On the positive side, life on earth will probably still continue,

57:03.120 --> 57:06.080
 and another intelligent civilization might still pop up.

57:06.080 --> 57:06.640
 Maybe, yeah.

57:06.640 --> 57:09.120
 It depends on the X risk.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.080
 It depends on the X risk.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.400
 Nuclear war, sure, that's one of the perhaps less bad ones.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.880
 Green goo through synthetic biology, very bad.

57:16.880 --> 57:25.360
 It will turn, you know, destroy all, you know, organic matter through,

57:25.360 --> 57:28.000
 you know, it's basically like a biological paperclip maximizer,

57:28.000 --> 57:32.960
 also bad, or AI type, you know, mass extinction thing as well would also be bad.

57:32.960 --> 57:34.080
 Shh, they're listening.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.400
 There's a robot right behind you.

57:36.400 --> 57:38.640
 Okay, wait, so let me ask you about this.

57:38.640 --> 57:40.240
 From a game theory perspective,

57:40.240 --> 57:42.160
 do you think we're living in a simulation?

57:42.160 --> 57:46.960
 Do you think we're living inside a video game created by somebody else?

57:47.920 --> 57:50.000
 Well, so what was the second part of the question?

57:50.000 --> 57:51.600
 Do I think we're living in a simulation and?

57:52.800 --> 57:58.480
 A simulation that is observed by somebody for purpose of entertainment,

57:58.480 --> 57:59.520
 so like a video game.

57:59.520 --> 58:00.240
 Are we listening?

58:00.240 --> 58:05.040
 Are we, because there's a, it's like Phil Hellmuth type of situation, right?

58:07.120 --> 58:09.200
 There's a creepy level of like,

58:09.200 --> 58:11.760
 this is kind of fun and interesting.

58:12.960 --> 58:15.680
 Like there's a lot of interesting stuff going on.

58:16.160 --> 58:19.360
 I mean, that could be somehow integrated into the evolutionary process,

58:19.360 --> 58:23.280
 where the way we perceive and are.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.640
 Are you asking me if I believe in God?

58:26.480 --> 58:27.200
 Sounds like it.

58:28.000 --> 58:36.480
 Kind of, but God seems to be not optimizing in the different formulations of God that we conceive of.

58:36.480 --> 58:42.400
 He doesn't seem to be, or she optimizing for like personal entertainment.

58:44.080 --> 58:48.400
 Maybe the older gods did, but the, you know, just like the,

58:48.400 --> 58:50.880
 basically like a teenager in their mom's basement,

58:51.520 --> 58:54.800
 watching, create a fun universe to observe.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.760
 So kind of crazy shit might happen.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.600
 Okay, so to try and answer this.

58:59.600 --> 59:11.840
 Do I think there is some kind of extraneous intelligence to our,

59:13.200 --> 59:17.520
 you know, classic measurable universe that we, you know, can measure with,

59:17.520 --> 59:22.560
 you know, through our current physics and instruments?

59:23.680 --> 59:24.560
 I think so, yes.

59:24.560 --> 59:32.400
 Partly because I've had just small little bits of evidence in my own life,

59:32.400 --> 59:35.600
 which have made me question, like, so I was a diehard atheist.

59:36.880 --> 59:41.600
 Even five years ago, you know, I got into like the rationality community,

59:41.600 --> 59:45.440
 big fan of less wrong, continue to be incredible resource.

59:47.040 --> 59:50.080
 But I've just started to have too many little

59:50.080 --> 1:00:00.320
 snippets of experience, which don't make sense with the current sort of purely materialistic

1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:07.200
 explanation of how reality works.

1:00:09.200 --> 1:00:16.640
 Isn't that just like a humbling practical realization that we don't know how reality works?

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.280
 Isn't that just a reminder to yourself?

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:23.120
 Yeah, no, it's a reminder of epistemic humility, because I felt too hard,

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:26.400
 you know, same as people, like, I think, you know, many people who are just like,

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.520
 my religion is the way, this is the correct way, this is the work, this is the law.

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.560
 You are immoral if you don't follow this, blah, blah, blah.

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:34.960
 I think they are lacking epistemic humility.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:36.480
 They're a little too much hubris there.

1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:44.880
 But similarly, I think the sort of the Richard Dawkins brand of atheism is too rigid as well

1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:50.880
 and doesn't, you know, there's a way to try and navigate these questions,

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:54.960
 which still honors the scientific method, which I still think is our best sort of realm of like

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:57.200
 reasonable inquiry, you know, a method of inquiry.

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:05.840
 So an example, I have two kind of notable examples that like really rattled my cage.

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:13.360
 The first one was actually in 2010, early on in my poker career.

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:21.040
 And I remember the Icelandic volcano that erupted that like shut down kind of all

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:21.920
 Atlantic airspace.

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:25.120
 And it meant I got stuck down in the south of France.

1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:26.080
 I was there for something else.

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:29.200
 And I couldn't get home.

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:31.760
 And someone said, well, there's a big poker tournament happening in Italy.

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:32.800
 Maybe do you want to go?

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:33.680
 I was like, oh, right, sure.

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:36.480
 Like, let's, you know, got a train across, found a way together.

1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:42.480
 And the buy in was 5,000 euros, which was much bigger than my bankroll would normally allow.

1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:47.760
 And so I played a feeder tournament, won my way in, kind of like I did with the Monte Carlo,

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:48.080
 big one.

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:53.200
 So then I won my way, you know, from 500 euros into 5,000 euros to play this thing.

1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:58.880
 And on day one of then the big tournament, which turned out to have,

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:01.200
 it was the biggest tournament ever held in Europe at the time.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:03.840
 It got over like 1,200 people, absolutely huge.

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:09.120
 And I remember they dimmed the lights for before, you know, the normal shuffle up and

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:15.120
 deal to tell everyone to start playing. And they played Chemical Brothers, Hey Boy, Hey Girl,

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:19.040
 which I don't know why it's notable, but it was just like a really, it was a song I always liked.

1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:21.040
 It was like one of these like pump me up songs.

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:22.800
 And I was sitting there thinking, oh, yeah, it's exciting.

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:23.920
 I'm playing this really big tournament.

1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:31.200
 And out of nowhere, just suddenly this voice in my head, just it sounded like my own sort of,

1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:34.800
 you know, when you say, you think in your mind, you hear a voice kind of, right?

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:35.360
 At least I do.

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:37.920
 And so it sounded like my own voice.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.840
 And it said, you are going to win this tournament.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:44.320
 And it was so powerful that I got this like wave of like, you know,

1:02:44.880 --> 1:02:46.640
 this sort of goosebumps down my body.

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:49.600
 And that I even, I remember looking around being like, did anyone else hear that?

1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.760
 And obviously people are in their phones like no one else heard it.

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:59.440
 And I was like, okay, six days later, I win the fucking tournament out of 1,200 people.

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:07.200
 And I said, I don't know how to explain it.

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:14.560
 Okay. Yes. Maybe I have that feeling before every time I play.

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:16.960
 And it's just that I happen to, you know, because I won the tournament,

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.240
 I retroactively remembered it.

1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:24.480
 Or the, or the feeling gave you a kind of, now from the film Hellmuthian.

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:25.520
 Well, exactly.

1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:28.240
 Like it gave you a confident, a deep confidence.

1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:29.600
 And it did, it definitely did.

1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:33.840
 Like I remember then feeling this like sort of, well, although I remember then on day one,

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:35.760
 I then went and lost half my stack quite early on.

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:37.600
 And I remember thinking like, oh, that was bullshit.

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:40.160
 You know, what kind of premonition is this?

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:40.960
 Thinking, oh, I'm out.

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:43.360
 But, you know, I managed to like keep it together and recover.

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:46.560
 And then, and then just went like pretty perfectly from then on.

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:51.920
 And either way, it definitely instilled me with this confidence.

1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:55.680
 And I don't want to put a, I don't, I can't put an explanation.

1:03:55.680 --> 1:04:03.200
 Like, you know, was it some, you know, huge extra, extra supernatural thing driving me?

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:07.920
 Or was it just my own self confidence in someone that just made me make the right decisions?

1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:08.640
 I don't know.

1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:10.560
 And I don't, I'm not going to put a frame on it.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.240
 And I think I know a good explanation.

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:16.480
 So we're a bunch of NPCs living in this world created by in the simulation.

1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:21.040
 And then people, not people, creatures from outside of the simulation

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.080
 sort of can tune in and play your character.

1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:26.400
 And that feeling you got is somebody just like,

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:29.200
 they got to play a poker tournament through you.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:30.560
 Honestly, it felt like that.

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:32.400
 It did actually feel a little bit like that.

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:35.120
 But it's been 12 years now.

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:36.560
 I've retold this story many times.

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:38.880
 Like, I don't even know how much I can trust my memory.

1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:41.360
 You're just an NPC retelling the same story.

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:42.960
 Because they just played the tournament and left.

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:43.840
 Yeah.

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:44.640
 They're like, oh, that was fun.

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:44.800
 Cool.

1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:45.440
 Yeah, cool.

1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:45.680
 Next.

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:51.680
 And now you're for the rest of your life left as a boring NPC retelling this great greatness.

1:04:51.680 --> 1:04:54.240
 Well, what was interesting was that after that, then I didn't obviously

1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:56.800
 win a major tournament for quite a long time.

1:04:56.800 --> 1:04:59.040
 And it left.

1:04:59.040 --> 1:05:02.720
 That was actually another sort of dark period because I had this incredible,

1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:06.880
 like the highs of winning that just on a material level were insane, winning the money.

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:10.080
 I was on the front page of newspapers because there was this girl that came out of nowhere

1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:10.800
 and won this big thing.

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:15.920
 And so again, chasing that feeling was difficult.

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:20.560
 But then on top of that, that was this feeling of almost being touched by something

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:23.120
 bigger that was like, uh.

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:28.560
 And also maybe did you have a sense that I might be somebody special?

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:40.080
 Like this kind of, I think that's the confidence thing that maybe you could do something special

1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:42.000
 in this world after all kind of feeling.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.120
 I definitely, I mean, this is the thing I think everybody wrestles with to an extent, right?

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.800
 We all, we are truly the protagonists in our own lives.

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:58.800
 And so it's a natural bias, human bias to feel, to feel special.

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:00.720
 And I think, and in some ways we are special.

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:04.560
 Every single person is special because you are that the universe does,

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.160
 the world literally does revolve around you.

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:07.920
 That's the thing in some respect.

1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:12.000
 But of course, if you then zoom out and take the amalgam of everyone's experiences,

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:12.720
 then no, it doesn't.

1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:15.520
 So there is this shared sort of objective reality,

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:17.600
 but sorry, this objective reality that is shared.

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:20.640
 But then there's also this subjective reality, which is truly unique to you.

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:24.400
 And I think both of those things coexist and it's not like one is correct and one isn't.

1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:29.040
 And again, anyone who's like, uh, oh no, your lived experience is everything versus

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:30.000
 your lived experience is nothing.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.400
 No, it's, it's, it's a blend between these two things.

1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:33.600
 They can exist concurrently.

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:36.640
 But there's a certain kind of sense that at least I've had my whole life.

1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:40.320
 And I think a lot of people have this as like, well, I'm just like this little person.

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:46.400
 And surely I can't be one of those people that do the big thing, right?

1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:48.560
 There's all these big people doing big things.

1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:52.800
 There's big actors and actresses, big musicians.

1:06:53.360 --> 1:06:58.080
 There's big business owners and all that kind of stuff, scientists and so on.

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:02.400
 I, you know, I have my own subjective experience that I enjoy and so on,

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:09.360
 but there's like a different layer, like, um, surely I can't do those great things.

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:13.600
 I mean, one of the things just having interacted with a lot of great people,

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:19.360
 I realized, no, they're like just the same, the same, the same humans as me.

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.080
 And that realization I think is really empowering.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:24.160
 And like to remind yourself.

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:24.960
 But are they?

1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:25.280
 Huh?

1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:25.840
 But are they?

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:26.240
 Are they?

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:29.840
 Well, it depends on some, yeah.

1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:41.760
 They're like a bag of insecurities and peculiar sort of like their own little weirdness and so on.

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:50.800
 I should say also not, they have the capacity for brilliance, but they're not

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:52.800
 generically brilliant.

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:57.200
 Like, you know, we tend to say this person or that person is brilliant,

1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:04.400
 but really, no, they're just like sitting there and thinking through stuff, just like the rest of us.

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:04.880
 Right.

1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:08.720
 I think they're in the habit of thinking through stuff seriously.

1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:14.480
 And they've built up a habit of not allowing them their mind to get trapped in a bunch of

1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:16.880
 bullshit and minutiae of day to day life.

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:23.200
 They really think big ideas, but those big ideas, it's like allowing yourself the freedom

1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:29.120
 to think big, to realize that you can be one that actually solve this particular big problem.

1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:33.120
 First identify a big problem that you care about, then like I can actually be the one

1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:34.160
 that solves this problem.

1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:37.120
 And like allowing yourself to believe that.

1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:41.200
 And I think sometimes you do need to have like that shock go through your body and a voice

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:42.800
 tells you you're going to win this tournament.

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:43.440
 Well, exactly.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:49.920
 And whether it was, it's this idea of useful fictions.

1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:54.720
 So again, like going through all like the classic rationalist training of less wrong,

1:08:54.720 --> 1:09:01.040
 where it's like, you want your map, the image you have of the world in your head to as accurately

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:03.200
 match up with how the world actually is.

1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:08.720
 You want the map and the territory to perfectly align as, you know, you want it to be as an

1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:10.080
 accurate representation as possible.

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:13.120
 I don't know if I fully subscribe to that anymore.

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:18.720
 Having now had these moments of like feeling of something either bigger or just actually just

1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:20.160
 being overconfident.

1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:22.880
 Like there is value in overconfidence sometimes.

1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:23.520
 I do.

1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:29.520
 If you would, you know, take, you know, take Magnus Carlson, right?

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:33.520
 If he, I'm sure from a young age, he knew he was very talented.

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:39.440
 But I wouldn't be surprised if he was also had something in him to, well, actually, maybe

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.440
 he's a bad example because he truly is the world's greatest.

1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:45.840
 But someone who is unclear whether they were going to be the world's greatest but ended up

1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:51.280
 doing extremely well because they had this innate deep self confidence, this like even

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:54.720
 overblown idea of how good their relative skill level is.

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.680
 That gave them the confidence to then pursue this thing and like with the kind of focus

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:03.280
 and dedication that it requires to excel in whatever it is you're trying to do, you know?

1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:09.520
 And so there are these useful fictions and that's where I think I diverge slightly with

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:19.120
 the classic, the classic sort of rationalist community because that's a field that is worth

1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:24.960
 studying of like how the stories we tell, what the stories we tell to ourselves,

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:27.600
 even if they are actually false and even if we suspect they might be false.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.120
 How it's better to sort of have that like little bit of faith, like value in faith,

1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:34.240
 I think, actually.

1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:37.200
 And that's partly another thing that's like now led me to explore

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:43.440
 the concept of God, whether you want to call it a simulator, the classic

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:44.160
 theological thing.

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:46.320
 I think we're all like elucidating to the same thing.

1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:49.680
 Now, I don't know, I'm not saying, you know, because obviously the Christian God is like,

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:53.280
 you know, all benevolent, endless love.

1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:57.360
 The simulation, at least one of the simulation hypothesis is like, as you said,

1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:01.440
 like a teenager in its bedroom who doesn't really care, doesn't give a shit about the

1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:02.400
 individuals within there.

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:06.000
 It just like wants to see how the thing plays out because it's curious and it could turn it

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:06.800
 off like that.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:10.720
 You know, we're on the, you know, we're on the sort of psychopathy to benevolent

1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:12.560
 spectrum God is, I don't know.

1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:21.200
 But having this, just having a little bit of faith that there is something else

1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:26.080
 out there that might be interested in our outcome is, I think, an essential thing,

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:27.840
 actually, for people to find.

1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:29.760
 A, because it creates commonality between us.

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.760
 It's something we can all share.

1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:34.880
 And like it is uniquely humbling of all of us to an extent.

1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:37.040
 It's like a common objective.

1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:43.200
 But B, it gives people that little bit of like reserve, you know, when things get really dark

1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:45.600
 and I do think things are going to get pretty dark over the next few years.

1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:51.920
 But it gives that like, to think that there's something out there that actually wants our

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:52.960
 game to keep going.

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:57.360
 I keep calling it the game, you know, it's a thing C and I recall it the game.

1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:03.600
 You and C is AKA Grimes, call what the game?

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:04.960
 Everything, the whole thing?

1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:06.560
 Yeah, we joke about like.

1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:07.840
 So everything is a game?

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:13.920
 Not, well, the universe, like what if it's a game and the goal of the game is to figure

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:18.480
 out like, well, either how to beat it, how to get out of it, you know, maybe this universe

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:21.200
 is an escape room, like a giant escape room.

1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.720
 And the goal is to figure out, put all the pieces of puzzle, figure out how it works

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:31.120
 in order to like unlock this like hyperdimensional key and get out beyond what it is.

1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:35.440
 No, but then, so you're saying it's like different levels and it's like a cage within

1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:39.680
 a cage within a cage and never like one cage at a time, you figure out how to do that.

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.040
 Like a new level up, you know, like us becoming multi planetary would be a level up or us,

1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:48.400
 you know, figuring out how to upload our consciousnesses to the thing that would

1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:53.840
 probably be a leveling up or spiritually, you know, humanity becoming more combined and

1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.640
 less adversarial and bloodthirsty and us becoming a little bit more enlightened,

1:12:58.640 --> 1:12:59.520
 that would be a leveling up.

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:03.920
 You know, there's many different frames to it, whether it's physical, you know,

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:05.920
 digital or like metaphysical.

1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:09.840
 I wonder what the level, I think, I think level one for earth is probably

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:13.040
 the biological evolutionary process.

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:20.240
 So going from single cell organisms to early humans, then maybe level two is

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:25.120
 whatever is happening inside our minds and creating ideas and creating technologies.

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:29.760
 That's like evolutionary process of ideas.

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.600
 And then multi planetary is interesting.

1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:36.960
 Is that fundamentally different from what we're doing here on earth?

1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:41.040
 Probably, because it allows us to like exponentially scale.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:46.240
 It delays the Malthusian trap, right?

1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:55.360
 It's a way to make the playing field get larger so that it can accommodate more of our stuff,

1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:56.480
 more of us.

1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:03.120
 And that's a good thing, but I don't know if it like fully solves this issue of

1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:07.760
 well, this thing called Molek, which we haven't talked about yet,

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:12.560
 but which is basically, I call it the god of unhealthy competition.

1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:13.840
 Yeah, let's go to Molek.

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:14.880
 What's Molek?

1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:20.320
 You did a great video on Molek, one aspect of it, the application of it to one aspect.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:21.360
 Instagram beauty filters.

1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:26.320
 Very niche, I wanted to start off small.

1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:36.240
 So Molek was originally coined as well, so apparently back in the like

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:41.280
 Canaanite times, it was to say ancient Carthaginian.

1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:46.480
 I can never say Carthagin, somewhere around like 300 BC or 280, I don't know.

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:54.320
 There was supposedly this death cult who would sacrifice their children to this awful demon

1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:59.200
 god thing they called Molek in order to get power to win wars.

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:02.480
 So really dark, horrible things, and it was literally like about child sacrifice,

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:05.600
 whether they actually existed or not, we don't know, but in mythology they did,

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:08.160
 and this god that they worshipped was this thing called Molek.

1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:12.880
 And then, I don't know, it seemed like it was kind of quiet throughout history

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:21.600
 in terms of mythology, beyond that, until this movie Metropolis in 1927 talked about

1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:28.880
 this, you see that there was this incredible futuristic city that everyone was living great in,

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.960
 but then the protagonist goes underground into the sewers and sees that the city is run by this

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:38.400
 machine, and this machine basically would just kill the workers all the time because it was

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:41.920
 just so hard to keep it running, they were always dying, so there was all this suffering

1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:45.760
 that was required in order to keep the city going, and then the protagonist has this vision

1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:49.920
 that this machine is actually this demon Molek. So again, it's like this sort of like mechanistic

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:57.600
 consumption of humans in order to get more power. And then Alan Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s,

1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:06.160
 which is an incredible poem called Howl about this thing, Molek. And a lot of people sort of

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:10.560
 quite understandably take the interpretation of that, he's talking about capitalism.

1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:17.200
 But then the sort of Pista resistance that's moved Molek into this idea of game theory

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:23.120
 was Scott Alexander of Slate's Sarcodex, wrote this incredible one, literally,

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:26.480
 I think it might be my favorite piece of writing of all time, it's called Meditations on Molek.

1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:31.760
 Molek, everyone must go read it. Slate's Sarcodex is a blog.

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:34.960
 It's a blog, yes. We can link to it in the show notes or something, right?

1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:44.160
 Yes, yes. But I like how you assume I have a professional operation going on here.

1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:48.720
 I shall try to remember. What are you, what are you, what are you, what are you, what are you,

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:52.160
 you're giving the impression of it. Yeah, I'll like, please, if I, if I don't,

1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:56.960
 please somebody in the comments remind me. If you don't know this blog, it's one of the

1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:04.000
 best blogs ever, probably. You should probably be following it. Are blogs still a thing?

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.000
 I think they are still a thing. Yeah, he's migrated on to Substack, but yeah, it's still a blog.

1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:13.360
 Substack, better not fuck things up. I hope not. Yeah. I hope they don't,

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:17.040
 I hope they don't turn Molekie, which will mean something to people when we continue.

1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:21.440
 Yeah. When they stop interrupting for us. No, no, it's fine.

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:26.080
 So anyway, so he writes, he writes this, this piece, Meditations on Molek. And basically,

1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:30.560
 he analyzes the poem and he's like, okay, so it seems to be something relating to

1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:36.240
 where competition goes wrong. And, you know, Molek was historically this thing of like,

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:40.880
 where people would sacrifice a thing that they care about, in this case, children,

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:45.120
 their own children, in order to gain power, a competitive advantage.

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:49.680
 And if you look at almost everything that sort of goes wrong in our society,

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:56.800
 it's that same process. So with the Instagram beauty filters thing, you know,

1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:03.440
 if you're trying to become a famous Instagram model, you are incentivized to post the hottest

1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:05.840
 pictures of yourself that you can, you know, you're trying to play that game.

1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:10.320
 There's a lot of hot women on Instagram. How do you compete against them? You post really

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:16.800
 hot pictures and that's how you get more likes. As technology gets better, you know,

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:21.920
 more makeup techniques come along. And then more recently, these beauty filters,

1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:26.240
 where like at the touch of a button, it makes your face look absolutely incredible compared

1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:31.840
 to your natural natural natural face. These these technologies come along, it's everyone is

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:39.040
 incentivized to do that short term strategy. But over on net, it's bad for everyone because

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:42.080
 now everyone is kind of like feeling like they have to use these things. And these things like

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.440
 they make you like the reason why I talked about them in this video is because I noticed it myself,

1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:49.600
 you know, like, I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while, I've given up on it now. But

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:53.840
 yeah, and I noticed these filters, how good they made me look. And I'm like, well,

1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:58.800
 I know that everyone else is kind of doing it. Subscribe to Liv's Instagram.

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:04.640
 Please, so I don't have to use the filters. Post a bunch of yeah, make it blow up.

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.400
 So yeah, with those, you felt the pressure actually.

1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:13.200
 Exactly. These short term incentives to do this like, this thing that like either

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:18.800
 sacrifices your integrity, or something else, in order to like stay competitive,

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.960
 which on aggregate, turns like, creates this like sort of race to the bottom spiral where

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:28.320
 everyone else ends up in a situation which is worse off than if they hadn't start, you know,

1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:35.440
 than it were before, kind of like if like at a football stadium, like the system is so badly

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:39.520
 designed, a competitive system of like everyone sitting and having a view, that if someone at

1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:43.920
 the very front stands up to get an even better view, it forces everyone else behind to like

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.560
 adopt that same strategy just to get to where they were before. But now everyone's stuck standing up,

1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:53.040
 like, so you need this like top down gods like coordination to make it go back to the better

1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:56.720
 state. But from within the system, you can't actually do that. So that's kind of what this

1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:02.720
 MOLIC thing is. It's this thing that makes people sacrifice values in order to optimize for the

1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:09.840
 winning the game in question, the short term game. But this MOLIC, can you attribute it to

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:14.960
 anyone centralized source, or is it an emergent phenomena from a large collection of people?

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:22.960
 Exactly that. It's an emergent phenomena. It's a force of game theory. It's a force of bad

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:28.000
 incentives on a multi agent system where you've got more, you know, Prisoner's Dilemma is technically

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:33.920
 a kind of MOLIC system as well. But it's just a two player thing. But another word for MOLIC is

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:38.800
 multi polar trap. Where basically you just got a lot of different people all competing for some

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:45.120
 kind of prize. And it would be better if everyone didn't do this one shitty strategy. But because

1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:48.880
 that strategy gives you a short term advantage, everyone's incentivized to do it. And so everyone

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:54.800
 ends up doing it. So the responsibility for social media is a really nice place for a large

1:20:54.800 --> 1:21:01.360
 number of people to play game theory. And so they also have the ability to then design the rules of

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:08.240
 the game. And is it on them to try to anticipate what kind of like to do the thing that poker

1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:14.480
 players are doing to run simulation? Ideally, that would have been great if, you know, Mark Zuckerberg

1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:19.920
 and Jack and all the, you know, the Twitter founders and everyone, if they had at least just run a few

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:24.720
 simulations of how their algorithms would turn, you know, different types of algorithms would turn

1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:29.360
 out for society, that would have been great. That's really difficult to do that kind of deep

1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:38.080
 philosophical thinking about thinking about humanity actually. So not not kind of this level of how do

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:44.800
 we optimize engagement? Or what brings people joy in the short term? But how is this thing going to

1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:52.400
 change the way people see the world? How's it going to get morphed in iterative games played

1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:58.800
 into something that will change society forever? That requires some deep thinking. That's,

1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:03.440
 I hope there's meetings like that inside companies, but I haven't seen them.

1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:09.120
 That's the problem. And it's difficult because, like, when you're starting up a social media

1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:16.000
 company, you know, you're aware that you've got investors to please, there's bills to pay,

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:21.600
 you know, there's only so much R&D you can afford to do. You've got all these like incredible

1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:25.040
 pressures, you know, bad incentives to get on and just build your thing as quickly as possible

1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.840
 and start making money. And, you know, I don't think anyone intended when they built these

1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:35.920
 social media platforms and just to like preface it. So the reason why, you know, social media is

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:41.200
 relevant because it's a very good example of like everyone these days is optimizing for, you know,

1:22:41.200 --> 1:22:46.640
 clicks, whether it's a social media platforms themselves because, you know, every click gets

1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:50.960
 more, you know, impressions and impressions pay for, you know, they get advertising dollars or

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.920
 whether it's individual influencers or, you know, whether it's the New York Times or whoever,

1:22:55.920 --> 1:22:59.760
 they're trying to get their story to go viral. So everyone's got this bad incentive of using

1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.080
 click, you know, as you called it, the clickbait industrial complex. That's a very mollkey system

1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:07.760
 because everyone is now using worse and worse tactics in order to like try and win this attention

1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:16.640
 game. And yeah, so ideally, these companies would have had enough slack in the beginning

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:22.320
 in order to run these experiments to see, okay, what are the ways this could possibly go wrong

1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:26.240
 for people? Well, what are the ways that mollock, they should be aware of this concept of mollock

1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:31.920
 and realize that it's, whenever you have a highly competitive multiagent system, which social media

1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:36.640
 is a classic example of millions of agents all trying to compete for likes and so on, and you

1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:43.520
 try and bring all this complexity down into like very small metrics such as number of likes,

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:48.560
 number of retweets, whatever the algorithm optimizes for, that is a like guaranteed recipe

1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:53.040
 for this stuff to go wrong and become a race to the bottom. I think there should be an honesty

1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:57.120
 when founders, I think there's a hunger for that kind of transparency of like, we don't know what

1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:02.640
 the fuck we're doing. This is a fascinating experiment. We're all running as a human civilization.

1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:06.960
 Let's try this out. And like, actually, just be honest about this, that we're all like,

1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:13.280
 these weird rats and amaze, none of us are controlling it. There's this kind of sense,

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:19.840
 like the founders, the CEO of Instagram or whatever, Mark Zuckerberg has a control and he's like,

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:24.640
 with strings playing people. No, they're... He's at the mercy of this is like everyone else. He's

1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:32.320
 just like trying to do his best. And like, I think putting on a smile and doing over polished

1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:38.080
 videos about how Instagram and Facebook are good for you, I think is not the right way to

1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:45.040
 actually ask some of the deepest questions we get to ask as a society. How do we design the game

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:52.000
 such that we build a better world? I think a big part of this as well is people... There's this

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:59.280
 philosophy, particularly in Silicon Valley of, well, techno optimism, technology will solve

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:04.720
 all our issues. And there's a steelman argument to that, where yes, technology has solved a lot

1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:10.000
 of problems and can potentially solve a lot future ones. But it can also... It's always

1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.280
 a double edged sword. And particularly as technology gets more and more powerful,

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:18.800
 we've now got big data and we're able to do all kinds of psychological manipulation with it and

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:26.320
 so on. Technology is not about values neutral thing. People think... I used to always think

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:32.160
 this myself. It's like this naive view that, oh, technology is completely neutral. It's the humans

1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:37.920
 that either make it good or bad. No. To the point we're at now, the technology that we are creating,

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:45.600
 they are social technologies. They literally dictate how humans now form social groups and so

1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:50.880
 on beyond that. And beyond that, it also then... That gives rise to the memes that we then coalesce

1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:56.800
 around. And that... If you have the stack that way, where it's technology driving social interaction,

1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:03.760
 which then drives memetic culture and which ideas become popular, that's Moloch.

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:08.240
 And we need the other way around. We need it so we need to figure out what are the good memes?

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:17.120
 What are the good values that we think we need to optimize for that makes people happy and healthy

1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:22.880
 and keeps society as robust and safe as possible, then figure out what the social structure around

1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:26.640
 those should be. And only then do we figure out technology. But we're doing the other way around.

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:34.720
 And as much as I love in many ways the culture of Silicon Valley and I do think that technology...

1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:38.880
 I don't want to knock it. It's done so many wonderful things for us, same as capitalism.

1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:46.080
 There are... We have to be honest with ourselves. We're getting to a point where we are losing

1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:49.440
 control of this very powerful machine that we have created.

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:54.240
 Can you redesign the machine within the game? Can you just have...

1:26:54.240 --> 1:27:01.840
 Can you understand the game enough? Okay, this is the game. And this is how we start to reemphasize

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:11.200
 the memes that matter, the memes that bring out the best in us. The way I try to be in real life

1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:18.480
 and the way I try to be online is to be about kindness and love. And I feel like I sometimes

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:24.720
 get criticized for being naive and all those kinds of things. But I feel like I'm just trying to live

1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:30.960
 within this game. I'm trying to be authentic. Yeah, but also like, hey, it's kind of fun to do this.

1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:38.720
 Like you guys should try this too. And that's like trying to redesign some aspects of the game

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:47.440
 within the game. Is that possible? I don't know. But I think we should try. I don't think we have

1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:53.360
 an option but to try. Well, the other option is to create new companies or to pressure companies

1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:58.880
 that or anyone who has control of the rules of the game.

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:03.520
 I think we need to be doing all of the above. I think we need to be thinking hard about what

1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:12.400
 are the kind of positive, healthy memes. As Elon said, he who controls the memes controls the

1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:19.680
 universe. I think he did. But there's truth to that. There is wisdom in that because

1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:27.040
 memes have driven history. We are a cultural species. That's what sets us apart from chimpanzees

1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:34.080
 and everything else. We have the ability to learn and evolve through culture as opposed to biology

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:39.920
 or like classic physical constraints. And that means culture is incredibly powerful.

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:47.280
 And we can create and become victim to very bad memes or very good ones. But we do have some agency

1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:54.800
 over which memes we not only put out there but we also subscribe to. So I think we need to take

1:28:54.800 --> 1:29:03.920
 that approach. I'm making this video right now called The Attention Wars which is about how

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:10.320
 the media machine is this mollock machine. Well, is this kind of like blind, dumb thing

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:14.400
 where everyone is optimizing for engagement in order to win their share of the attention pie?

1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:18.640
 And then if you zoom out, it's really like mollock that's pulling the strings because the only

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:23.120
 thing that benefits from this in the end. Our information ecosystem is breaking down.

1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:29.120
 You look at the state of the US, we're in a civil war. It's just not a physical war.

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:36.080
 It's an information war. And people are becoming more fractured in terms of what their actual

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:40.320
 shared reality is. Like truly like an extreme left person, an extreme right person,

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:46.080
 they literally live in different worlds in their minds at this point. And it's getting more and

1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:51.920
 more amplified. And this force is like a razor blade pushing through everything. It doesn't

1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:57.040
 matter how innocuous the topic is, it will find a way to split into this bifurcated culture war.

1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:01.280
 And it's fucking terrifying. Because that maximizes the tension. And that's like an emergent

1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:10.160
 mollock type force that takes anything, any topic and cuts through it so that you can split nicely

1:30:11.040 --> 1:30:18.160
 into two groups. One that's... All everyone is trying to do within the system is just

1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:22.320
 maximize whatever gets them the most attention because they're just trying to make money so

1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:29.440
 they can keep their thing going. And the best emotion for getting attention... Because it's

1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:33.360
 not just about attention on the internet, it's engagement. That's the key thing. In order for

1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:37.760
 something to go viral, you need people to actually engage with it. They need to comment or retweet

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:46.480
 or whatever. And of all the emotions, there's like seven classic shared emotions that studies

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:52.640
 have found that all humans, even from like previously uncontacted tribes have. Some of

1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:59.280
 those are negative, like sadness, disgust, anger, et cetera. Some are positive, happiness,

1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:06.560
 excitement, and so on. The one that happens to be the most useful for the internet is anger.

1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:14.480
 Because anger is such an active emotion. If you want people to engage, if someone's scared... And

1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:17.040
 I'm not just talking out my ass here, there are studies here that have looked into this.

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:23.840
 Whereas if someone's disgusted or fearful, they actually tend to then be like,

1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:27.520
 I don't want to deal with this. So they're less likely to engage and share it and so on. They're

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:32.320
 just going to be like, whereas if they're enraged by a thing, well, now that trick is all the

1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:40.880
 old tribalism emotions. And so that's how then things get spread much more easily. They outcompete

1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:48.480
 all the other memes in the ecosystem. And so the attention economy, the wheels that make it go

1:31:48.480 --> 1:31:55.520
 around is rage. I did a tweet. The problem with raging against the machine is that the machine

1:31:55.520 --> 1:31:59.520
 has learned to feed off rage because it is feeding off our rage. That's the thing that's

1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:02.160
 now keeping it going. So the more we get angry, the worse it gets.

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:10.880
 So the malloc in this attention, in the war of attention is constantly maximizing rage.

1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:15.360
 What it is optimizing for is engagement. And it happens to be that engagement

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:23.840
 is propaganda. It just sounds like everything is putting... More and more things are being

1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:28.720
 put through this like propagandist lens of winning whatever the war is in question,

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:33.200
 whether it's the culture war or the Ukraine war. Yeah. Well, I think the silver lining of this,

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:38.720
 do you think it's possible that in the long arc of this process, you actually do arrive

1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:44.000
 at greater wisdom and more progress? In the moment, it feels like people are

1:32:45.120 --> 1:32:49.440
 tearing each other to shreds over ideas. But if you think about it, one of the magic things

1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:54.480
 about democracy and so on is you have the blue versus red constantly fighting. It's almost like

1:32:54.480 --> 1:33:01.680
 they're in discourse, creating devil's advocate, making devils out of each other. And through that

1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:08.560
 process, discussing ideas, like almost really embodying different ideas, just to yell at each

1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:14.560
 other and through the yelling over the period of decades, maybe centuries, figuring out a better

1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:19.840
 system. Like in the moment, it feels fucked up. Right. But in the long arc, it actually is productive.

1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:30.400
 I hope so. That said, we are now in the era of just as we have weapons of mass destruction

1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:37.840
 with nuclear weapons that can break the whole playing field, we now are developing weapons of

1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:44.000
 informational mass destruction, information weapons, WMDs that basically can be used for

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:50.080
 propaganda or just manipulating people. However, they, you know, is needed, whether that's through

1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:59.200
 dumb TikTok videos, or, you know, there are significant resources being put in. I don't

1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:04.320
 mean to sound like, you know, to doom and doom, but there are bad actors out there. That's the

1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.840
 thing. There are plenty of good actors within the system who are just trying to stay afloat in the

1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:12.480
 game. So we're effectively doing monarchy things. But then on top of that, we have actual bad actors

1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:17.280
 who are intentionally trying to like manipulate the other side into doing things.

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:24.400
 And using, so because it's a digital space, they're able to use artificial actors, meaning bots.

1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:31.120
 Exactly. Botnets, you know, and this is a whole new situation that we've never had before.

1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:37.520
 It's exciting. You know what I want to do? Because there is, you know, people are talking

1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:43.440
 about bots manipulating and like malicious bots that are basically spreading propaganda.

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:48.960
 I want to create like a bot army for like, that like fights that, yeah, exactly for love that

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.520
 fights though, that, I mean, you know, there's the, I mean, there's truth to fight fire with fire.

1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:58.880
 It's like, but how you always have to be careful whenever you create, again, like

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.280
 Molek is very tricky. Yeah. Hitler was trying to spread love too.

1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:08.080
 Yeah. Yeah. So we thought, but you know, I agree with you that like, that is a thing that should

1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:12.880
 be considered, but there is, again, everyone, the road to hell is paved in good intentions.

1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:20.320
 And this is, there's always unforeseen circumstance, you know, outcomes, externalities,

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:23.440
 if you're trying to adopt a thing, even if you do it in the very best of faith.

1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:26.880
 But you can learn lessons of history. If you can run some sims on it first.

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:32.320
 Absolutely. But also there's certain aspects of a system as we've learned through history that

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:38.240
 that do better than others. Like for example, don't have a dictator. So like if I were to create

1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:43.840
 this bot army, it's not good for me to have full control over it. Because in the beginning,

1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:48.480
 I might have a good understanding of what's good and not, but over time that starts to get

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:52.640
 deviated because I'll get annoyed at some assholes and I'll think, okay, wouldn't it be nice to get

1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:56.720
 rid of those assholes, but then that power starts getting to your head, you become corrupted.

1:35:56.720 --> 1:35:59.440
 That's basic human nature. So distribute the power.

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:07.200
 We need a love botnet on a DAO. A DAO love botnet.

1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:10.560
 Yeah. And without a leader. Like without...

1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:14.240
 Exactly. Distributed, right. But yeah, without any kind of centralized...

1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:19.600
 Yeah. Without even, you know, basic is the more control, the more you can decentralize the control

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:26.640
 of a thing to people, you know, but then you still need the ability to coordinate.

1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:30.960
 Because that's the issue when if something is too... You know, that's really, to me,

1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:37.280
 like the culture wars, the bigger war we're dealing with is actually between the sort of the...

1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:41.920
 I don't know what even the term is for it, but like centralization versus decentralization.

1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:48.080
 That's the tension we're seeing. Power in control by a few versus completely distributed.

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:52.240
 And the trouble is if you have a fully centralized thing, then you're at risk of tyranny,

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:57.360
 you know, Stalin type things can happen or completely distributed. Now you're at risk of

1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:01.360
 complete anarchy and chaos where you can't even coordinate to like on, you know, when there's

1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:06.080
 like a pandemic or anything like that. So it's like, what is the right balance to strike between

1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:10.880
 these two structures? Well, can't Molek really take hold in a fully decentralized system?

1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:12.880
 That's one of the dangers too. Yes.

1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:17.600
 The very vulnerable to Molek. So the dictator can commit huge atrocities,

1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.880
 but they can also make sure the infrastructure works and...

1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:27.680
 They have that God's eye view at least. They have the ability to create like laws and rules that

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:33.120
 like force coordination, which stops Molek. But then you're vulnerable to that dictator

1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:36.320
 getting infected with like this, with some kind of psychopathy type thing.

1:37:37.440 --> 1:37:38.480
 What's reverse Molek?

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:46.080
 So great question. So that's where... So I've been working on this series,

1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:49.920
 it's been driving me insane for the last year and a half. I did the first one a year ago.

1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:53.920
 I can't believe it's nearly been a year. The second one, hopefully we're coming out in like a month.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.840
 And my goal at the end of the series is to like present, because basically I'm painting the picture

1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:05.040
 of like what Molek is and how it's affecting almost all these issues in our society and how it's,

1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:08.880
 you know, driving. It's like kind of the generator function, as people describe it,

1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:11.600
 of existential risk. And then at the end of that...

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:16.080
 Wait, wait. The generator function of existential risk. So you're saying Molek is sort of the

1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:22.080
 engine that creates a bunch of X risks? Yes, not all of them. Like a, you know, a...

1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:26.640
 Just a cool phrase. Generator function. It's not my phrase. It's Daniel Schmacktenberger.

1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:28.720
 Oh, Schmacktenberger. I got that from him. Of course.

1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:32.560
 All things. It's like all roads lead back to Daniel Schmacktenberger, I think.

1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:35.280
 The dude is brilliant. He's really brilliant.

1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:41.040
 After that, it's Mark Twain. But anyway, sorry. Totally rude to interrupt this from me.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:45.840
 No, it's fine. So not all X risks. So like an asteroid technically isn't because it's,

1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:51.040
 you know, it's just like this one big external thing. It's not like a competition thing

1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:54.080
 going on. But, you know, synthetic bio, you know,

1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:59.600
 bio weapons, that's one because everyone's incentivized to build, even for defense, you know,

1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.880
 bad, bad viruses, you know, just to threaten someone else, etc. Or AI, technically, the

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:12.800
 race to AGI is kind of potentially a Moloky situation. But yeah, so if Moloky is this,

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:17.760
 like, generator function that's driving all of these issues over the coming century that might

1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:24.320
 wipe us out, what's the inverse? And so far, what I've gotten to is this character that I want to

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:29.280
 put out there called Winwin. Because Moloky is the God of Lose Lose, ultimately. It masquerades

1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:33.120
 as the God of Winlose, but in reality, it's Lose Lose. Everyone ends up worse off.

1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:37.440
 So I was like, well, what's the opposite of that? It's Winwin. And I was thinking for ages,

1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:40.800
 like, what's a good name for this character? And then the more I was like, okay, well,

1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:47.120
 don't try and, you know, think through it logically. What's the vibe of Winwin? And to me,

1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:52.160
 like in my mind, Moloky is like, and I dress as it in the video, like, it's red and black. It's

1:39:52.160 --> 1:40:00.480
 kind of like very, you know, hyper focused on its one goal you must win. So Winwin is kind of

1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:07.200
 actually like these colors. It's like purple turquoise. It loves games too. It loves a little

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:11.760
 bit of healthy competition, but constrained, like kind of like before, like nose out of ring fence,

1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:17.280
 zero sum competition into like just the right amount, whereby its externalities can be controlled

1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:22.320
 and kept positive. And then beyond that, it also loves cooperation, coordination, love,

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:27.840
 all these other things. But it's also kind of like mischievous. Like, you know, it will have

1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:32.560
 a good time. It's not like kind of like boring, you know, like, oh, God, it's, you know, it's

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:39.600
 how to have fun. It can get like, it can get down. But ultimately, it's unbelievably wise,

1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:45.120
 and it just wants the game to keep going. And I call it Winwin. Winwin. That's a good, like,

1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:51.360
 pet name. Yes. Winwin. The, I think the Winwin, right? And I think it's formal name when it has

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:58.800
 to do like official functions is Omnia. Omnia. Yeah. From like omniscience, kind of, what's,

1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:02.880
 why Omnia? It's just like Omnia. It's just like Omwin. Omniwin. But I'm open to suggestions. I

1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:07.520
 would like, you know, and this is. I like Omnia. Yeah. But there's an angelic kind of sense to

1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:16.560
 Omnia though. So Winwin is more fun. So it's more like, it embraces the fun aspect. I mean,

1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:24.320
 there is something about sort of, there's some aspect to Winwin interactions that requires

1:41:26.400 --> 1:41:34.880
 embracing the chaos of the game and enjoying the game itself. I don't know. I don't know what that

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:41.360
 is. That's almost like a zen like appreciation of the game itself, not optimizing for the consequences

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:47.680
 of the game. Right. Well, it's recognizing the value of competition in of itself. It's not like

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:52.080
 about winning. It's about you enjoying the process of having a competition and not knowing whether

1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:56.800
 you're going to win or lose this little thing. But then also being aware that, you know, what's

1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:01.440
 the boundary? How big do I want competition to be? Because one of the reasons why Molek is doing so

1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:06.640
 well now in our society, in our civilization is because we haven't been able to ring fence competition.

1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:11.280
 You know, and so it's just having all these negative externalities and it's we've completely

1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:17.680
 lost control of it. You know, it's, I think my guesses are now we're getting really like,

1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:26.720
 you know, metaphysical technically. But I think we'll be, we'll be in a more interesting universe

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:32.320
 if we have one that has both pure cooperation, you know, lots of cooperation and some pockets

1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:37.280
 of competition than one that's purely competition, cooperation entirely. Like it's good to have some

1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:43.600
 little zero sum this bits. But I don't know that fully. And I'm not qualified as a philosopher to

1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:49.840
 know that. And that's what reverse Molek. So this kind of win win creature is in a system as an

1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:58.320
 antidote to the Molek system. Yes. And I don't know how it's going to do that. But it's good to kind

1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:03.760
 of try to start to formulate different ideas, different frameworks of how we think about that.

1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:09.040
 Exactly. At the small scale of a collection of individuals, a large scale of a society.

1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:14.000
 Exactly. It's a meme. I think it's, I think it's an example of a good meme. And I'm open,

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:17.520
 I'd love to hear feedback from people if they think it's at, you know, they have a better idea

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:22.800
 or it's not, you know, but it's the direction of meme that we need to spread this idea of like,

1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:28.560
 look for the win wins in life. Well, on the topic of beauty filters, on that particular context

1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:36.640
 where Molek creates negative consequences, what, you know, Dostoevsky said beauty will save the

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:46.720
 world. What is beauty anyway? It would be nice to just try to discuss what kind of thing we would

1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:57.120
 like to converge towards in our understanding of what is beautiful. So to me, I think something

1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:08.400
 is beautiful when it can't be reduced down to easy metrics. Like if you think of a tree,

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:12.960
 what is it about a tree, like a big ancient beautiful tree, right? What is it about it

1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:19.600
 that we find so beautiful? It's not, you know, the, you know, what are the sweetness of its fruit

1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:30.080
 or the value of its lumber. It's, it's this entirety of it that is, there's these immeasurable

1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:36.800
 qualities. It's like almost like a qualia of it. That's both like it walks this fine line between

1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:41.280
 pattern, well, it's got lots of patternicity, but it's not overly predictable. You know, again,

1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:45.120
 it walks this fine line between order and chaos. It's a very highly complex system.

1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:52.800
 And the, you know, you can't, it's evolving over time, you know, the definition of a complex

1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:57.520
 versus, and this is another Schmacktenberger thing, you know, a complex versus a complicated system.

1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:02.080
 A complicated system can be sort of broken down into bits, understood, and then put that together.

1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:07.760
 A complex system is kind of like a black box. It does all this crazy stuff. But if you take it

1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:11.600
 apart, you can't put it back together again, because it's, there's, there's all these intricacies.

1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:15.840
 And also very importantly, like the, there's some of the parts, sorry, the sum of the whole

1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:21.200
 is much greater than the sum of the parts. And that's where the beauty lies, I think.

1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:26.000
 And I think that extends to things like art as well. Like there's something, there's something

1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:29.840
 immeasurable about it. There's something we can't break down to a narrow metric.

1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:33.200
 Does that extend to humans, you think? Yeah, absolutely.

1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:38.640
 So how can Instagram reveal that kind of beauty, the complexity of a human being?

1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:39.680
 Good question.

1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:45.040
 And this takes us back to our dating sites and good reads, I think.

1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:52.160
 Very good question. I mean, well, I know what it shouldn't do. It shouldn't try and like, right now,

1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:56.880
 you know, one of the, I was talking to like a social media expert recently, because I was like,

1:45:57.440 --> 1:45:59.760
 Oh, I hate things. The social media expert.

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:04.480
 Oh, yeah. There are like agencies out there that you can like outsource because I'm thinking about

1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:08.160
 working with one to like, so I want to start a podcast.

1:46:09.280 --> 1:46:11.680
 You should, you should have done it a long time ago.

1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:16.320
 Working on it. It's going to be called win win. And it's going to be about this like positive

1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:21.680
 some stuff. And the thing that, you know, they always come back and say is like, well, you need

1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:26.320
 to like, figure out what your thing is, you know, you need to narrow down what your thing is and

1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:32.000
 then just follow that, have like a sort of a formula, because that's what people want.

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.080
 They want to know that they're coming back to the same thing. And that's the advice on YouTube,

1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:41.360
 Twitter, you name it. And that's why, and the trouble with that is that it's a complexity

1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:45.360
 reduction. And generally speaking, complex, you know, complexity reduction is bad. It's

1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:49.840
 making things more, it's an oversimplification. Not that simplification is always a bad thing.

1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:57.040
 But when you're trying to take, you know, what is social media doing is trying to like,

1:46:57.040 --> 1:47:03.680
 encapsulate the human experience and put it into digital form and commodify it to an extent.

1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:08.800
 So you do that, you compress people down into these like, narrow things.

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:13.760
 And that's why I think it's kind of ultimately fundamentally incompatible

1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:15.280
 with at least my definition of beauty.

1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:23.760
 It's interesting because there is some sense in which a simplification, sort of in the Einstein

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:30.560
 kind of sense of a really complex idea, a simplification in a way that still captures some

1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:37.680
 core power of an idea of a person is also beautiful. And so maybe it's possible for

1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:46.080
 social media to do that, a presentation, a sort of a slither, a slice, a look into a person's life

1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.200
 that reveals something real about them. But in a simple way, in a way that can be displayed

1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:59.840
 graphically or through words, some way, I mean, in some way, Twitter can do that kind of thing.

1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:08.480
 A very few set of words can reveal the intricacies of a person. Of course, the viral machine that

1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:17.200
 spreads those words often results in people taking the thing out of context. People often

1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.880
 don't read tweets in the context of the human being that wrote them. The full history of the

1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:29.040
 tweets they've written, the education level, the humor level, the world view they're playing

1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:34.720
 around with, all that context is forgotten and people just see the different words. So that can

1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:41.040
 lead to trouble. But in a certain sense, if you do take it in context, it reveals some kind of

1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:47.280
 quirky little beautiful idea or a profound little idea from that particular person that

1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:51.840
 shows something about that person. So in that sense, Twitter can be more successful if we talk

1:48:51.840 --> 1:49:01.040
 about mollusks is driving a better kind of incentive. Yeah. I mean, how they can, if we were to

1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:10.880
 rewrite, is there a way to rewrite the Twitter algorithm so that it stops being the fertile

1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:17.440
 breeding ground of the culture wars? Because that's really what it is. I mean, maybe I'm giving it

1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:22.640
 Twitter too much power, but just the more I looked into it, and I had conversations with

1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:31.520
 Tristan Harris from Center of Human Technology, and he explained it as Twitter is where you

1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:37.280
 have this amalgam of human culture, and then this terribly designed algorithm that amplifies the

1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:45.680
 craziest people, and the angriest, the angriest, most divisive takes and amplifies them. And then

1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:50.320
 the media, the mainstream media, because all the journalists are also on Twitter, they then

1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:56.000
 are informed by that. And so they draw out the stories they can from this already like

1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:04.320
 very boiling lava of rage, and then spread that to their millions and millions of people

1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:11.840
 who aren't even on Twitter. And so honestly, I think if I could press a button, turn them off,

1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:17.280
 I probably would at this point, because I just don't see a way of being compatible with healthiness,

1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:24.080
 but that's not going to happen. And so at least one way to like stem the tide and make it less

1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:32.640
 monarchy would be to change, at least if like it was on a subscription model, then it's now not

1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:39.120
 optimizing for impressions, because basically what it wants is for people to keep coming back

1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:43.600
 as often as possible. That's how they get paid, right? Every time an ad gets shown to someone,

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:47.680
 and the way is to get people constantly refreshing their feed. So you're trying to encourage

1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:54.240
 addictive behaviors. Whereas if someone, if they moved on to at least a subscription model, then

1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:59.680
 they're getting the money either way, whether someone comes back to the site once a month or

1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:04.720
 500 times a month, they get the same amount of money. So now that takes away that incentive

1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:09.280
 to use technology, to build, to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive.

1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:13.840
 That would be one way, for example. Yeah, but you still want people to...

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:20.800
 Yeah, I just feel like that just slows down, creates friction in the virality of things.

1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:25.360
 But that's good. We need to slow down virality. It's good. It's one way.

1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:33.680
 Virality is mollic, to be clear. So mollic is always negative, then.

1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:38.720
 Yes, by definition. Yes, but then I disagree with you.

1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:40.400
 Competition is not always negative. Competition is neutral.

1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:46.240
 I disagree with you that all virality is negative, then, is mollic, then. Because

1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:51.760
 it's a good intuition, because we have a lot of data on virality being negative.

1:51:51.760 --> 1:51:59.360
 But I happen to believe that the core of human beings, so most human beings, want to be good

1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:06.160
 more than they want to be bad to each other. And so I think it's possible. It might be just

1:52:06.160 --> 1:52:13.040
 harder to engineer systems that enable virality, but it's possible to engineer systems that are viral,

1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:21.280
 that enable virality, and the kind of stuff that rises to the top is things that are positive.

1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:25.680
 And positive, not like lala positive. It's more like win, win,

1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:29.600
 meaning a lot of people need to be challenged. Wise things, yes.

1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:33.520
 You grow from it. It might challenge you. You might not like it, but you ultimately grow from it.

1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:37.600
 And ultimately, bring people together as opposed to tear them apart.

1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:43.600
 I deeply want that to be true. And I very much agree with you that people at their core

1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:46.720
 are on average good as opposed to care for each other as opposed to not.

1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:53.600
 I think it's actually a very small percentage of people are truly wanting to do just destructive,

1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:56.320
 malicious things. Most people are just trying to win their own little game,

1:52:56.320 --> 1:52:59.680
 and they don't mean to be, they're just stuck in this badly designed system.

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:09.120
 That said, the current structure, yes. The current structure means that virality is

1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:12.960
 optimized towards mollock. That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions. Sometimes positive

1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:16.240
 stories do go viral, and I think we should study them. I think there should be a whole field of

1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:24.240
 study into understanding, identifying memes that above a certain threshold of the population agree

1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:29.120
 as a positive, happy, bringing people together meme, the kind of thing that brings families

1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:33.680
 together that would normally argue about cultural stuff at the table, at the dinner table.

1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:40.080
 Identify those memes and figure out what was the ingredient that made them spread that day.

1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:49.120
 Also, not just happiness and connection between humans, but connection between humans in other

1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:54.640
 ways that enables productivity, cooperation, solving difficult problems and all those kinds

1:53:54.640 --> 1:54:01.360
 of stuff. It's not just about let's be happy and have a fulfilling lives. It's also like,

1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:06.160
 let's build cool shit. Which is the spirit of collaboration, which is deeply anti mollock.

1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:13.360
 It's not using competition. It's like mollock hates collaboration and coordination and people

1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:20.960
 working together. Again, the internet started out as that. It could have been that, but because

1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:27.840
 of the way it was structured in terms of very lofty ideal, they wanted everything to be open

1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:33.040
 source and also free, but they needed to find a way to pay the bills anyway because they were

1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:38.160
 still building this on top of our old economics system. The way they did that was through third

1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:44.160
 party advertisement, but that meant that things were very decoupled. You've got this third party

1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:51.360
 interest, which means that people are having to optimize for that. The actual consumer is

1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:58.000
 actually the product, not the person you're making the thing for. In the end, you stop making the

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:07.040
 thing for the advertiser. That's why it then breaks down. There's no clean solution to this,

1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:15.200
 and it's a really good suggestion by you actually to figure out how we can optimize

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:28.080
 virality for positive sum topics. I shall be the general of the lovebot army. Distributed.

1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:33.920
 Just even in saying that, the power already went to my head. No. Okay. You've talked about

1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:38.480
 quantifying your thinking. We've been talking about this, a game theoretic view on life

1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:44.160
 and putting probabilities behind estimates. If you think about different trajectories,

1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:48.240
 you can take through life, just actually analyzing life in a game theoretic way,

1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:53.680
 like your own life, like personal life. I think you've given an example that you had an honest

1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:59.600
 conversation with the ego about how long is this relationship going to last. Similar to our marriage

1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:06.320
 problem discussion, having an honest conversation about the probability of things that we sometimes

1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:12.800
 are a little bit too shy or scared to think of in probabilistic terms. Can you speak to that

1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:18.960
 kind of way of reasoning, the good and the bad of that? Can you do this kind of thing with human

1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:26.000
 relations? Yeah. The scenario you're talking about, it was like... Yeah. Tell me about that scenario.

1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:34.320
 I think it was about a year into our relationship, and we were having a fairly heavy conversation

1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:39.200
 because we were trying to figure out whether or not I was going to sell my apartment. He'd already

1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:44.720
 moved in, but I think we were just figuring out what our long term plans should be. Should we buy

1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:48.640
 a place together, et cetera. When you guys start having that conversation, are you drunk out of

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:53.520
 your mind on wine or is you sober and you're actually having a serious... I think we were sober.

1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:56.560
 How do you get to that conversation? Because most people are kind of afraid to have that

1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:02.800
 kind of serious conversation. Well, our relationship was very... Well, first of all, we were good

1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:13.040
 friends for a couple of years before we even got romantic. When we did get romantic, it was very

1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:18.560
 clear that this was a big deal. It wasn't just another random thing.

1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:25.040
 So the probability of it being a big deal was high? It was already very high. Then we'd been

1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:32.000
 together for a year, and it had been pretty golden and wonderful. There was a lot of foundation

1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:37.280
 already where we felt very comfortable having a lot of frank conversations. But Igor's MO has

1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:42.960
 always been much more than mine. He was always from the outset. Just in a relationship, radical

1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:47.840
 transparency and honesty is the way, because the truth is the truth, whether you want to hide it

1:57:47.840 --> 1:57:56.320
 on where it will come out eventually. If you aren't able to accept difficult things yourself,

1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:02.160
 then how could you possibly expect to be the most integral version? The relationship needs

1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:07.520
 this bedrock of honesty as a foundation, more than anything. Yeah, that's really interesting,

1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:11.840
 but I would like to push against some of those ideas, but let's throw them up.

1:58:11.840 --> 1:58:14.960
 Don, the line, yes, throw them up. I just rudely interrupt.

1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:21.760
 And so we'd been about together for a year, and things were good, and we were having this hard

1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:26.880
 conversation. And then he was like, well, okay, what's the likelihood that we're going to be

1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:31.600
 together in three years then? Because I think it was roughly a three year time horizon. And I was

1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:34.960
 like, oh, interesting. And then we were like, actually, wait, before you said out loud, let's

1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:39.360
 both write down our predictions formally. Because we'd been like, we were just getting into like

1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:42.880
 effective altruism and rationality at the time, which is all about making, you know,

1:58:42.880 --> 1:58:51.920
 formal predictions as a means of measuring your own, well, your own foresight, essentially, in a

1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:56.960
 quantified way. So we like both wrote down our percentages. And we also did a one year

1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:01.120
 prediction and a 10 year one as well. So we got percentages for all three.

1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:05.280
 And then we showed each other. And I remember like having this moment of like,

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:10.240
 because for the 10 year one, I was like, well, I mean, I love them a lot, but like a lot can

1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:14.880
 happen in 10 years, you know, and we've only been together for, you know, so I was like,

1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:19.120
 I think it's over 50%, but it's definitely not 90%. And I remember like wrestling, I was like,

1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:22.000
 but I don't want him to be hurt. I don't want him to, you know, I don't want to give a number

1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:27.040
 lower than his. And I remember thinking, I was like, don't game it. This is an exercise in radical

1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:31.840
 honesty. So just give your real percentage. And I think mine was like 75%. And then we showed

1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:41.120
 each other. And luckily, we were fairly well aligned. But honestly, if we weren't 20%, it

1:59:41.120 --> 1:59:45.920
 definitely would have, I, if his had been consistently lower than mine, that would have

1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:50.480
 rattled me for sure. Whereas if it had been the other way around, I think he would have,

1:59:50.480 --> 1:59:53.760
 he's just kind of like a water off the duck's back type of guy. It'd be like, okay, well,

1:59:53.760 --> 1:59:58.080
 all right, we'll figure this out. Well, did you guys provide airbars on the estimate? Like the

1:59:58.080 --> 2:00:03.040
 level. They came built in, we didn't give formal plus or minus error bars. I didn't draw any or

2:00:03.040 --> 2:00:09.280
 anything like that. Well, I guess that's the question I have is, did you feel informed enough

2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:15.280
 to make such decisions? Because like, I feel like if you were, if I were to do this kind of thing

2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:23.120
 rigorously, I would want some data. I would want to say that one of the assumptions you have is

2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:29.120
 you're not that different from other relationships. Right. And so I want to have some data about the

2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:34.560
 way. You want the base rates. Yeah. And also actual trajectories of relationships. I would

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:42.400
 love to have like time series data about the ways that relationships fall apart or prosper,

2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:48.400
 how they collide with different life events, losses, job changes moving,

2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:57.040
 both partners find jobs. Only one has a job. I want that kind of data and how often the

2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:04.240
 different trajectories change in life. Like how informative is your past to your future?

2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:10.400
 That's the whole thing I got. Can you look at my life and have a good prediction about,

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:15.280
 in terms of my characteristics of my relationships with what that's going to look like in the future

2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:18.880
 or not? I don't even know the answer to that question. I'll be very ill informed in terms of

2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:26.160
 making the probability. I would be far, yeah, I just would be under informed. I would be under

2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:32.320
 informed. I'll be over biasing to my prior experiences, I think. Right. But as long as you're

2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:35.760
 aware of that and you're honest with yourself, and you're honest with the other person, say,

2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:40.800
 look, I have really wide error bars on this for the following reasons. That's okay. I still think

2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:45.840
 it's better than not trying to quantify it at all if you're trying to make really major irreversible

2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:52.080
 life decisions. I feel also the romantic nature of that question. For me personally, I try to

2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:59.520
 live my life thinking it's very close to 100%. Allowing myself, actually, this is the difficulty

2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:06.320
 of this, is allowing myself to think differently. I feel like has a psychological consequence.

2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:14.000
 That's one of my pushbacks against radical honesty is this one particular perspective.

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:20.080
 So you're saying you would rather give a falsely high percentage to your partner?

2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:24.560
 Going back to the wide sage film. In order to create this additional optimism.

2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:26.160
 Helm youth. Yes.

2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:31.040
 Of fake it till you make it. The positive, the positive thinking.

2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:37.920
 Hashtag positivity. Yeah, hashtag. Well, so that and this comes back to this idea of useful

2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:43.440
 fictions. And I agree. I don't think there's a clear answer to this and I think it's actually

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:49.760
 quite subjective. Some people this works better for than others. To be clear, Igor and I weren't

2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:56.160
 doing this formal prediction in it. We did it with very much tongue in cheek. It wasn't like

2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:01.440
 we were going to make, I don't think it even would have drastically changed what we decided to do

2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:04.000
 even. We kind of just did it more as a fun exercise.

2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:09.840
 For the consequence of that fun exercise, there was a deep honesty to it too.

2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:13.680
 Exactly. It was a deep, and it was just like this moment of reflection. I'm like, oh wow,

2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:21.040
 I actually have to think through this quite critically and so on. And it's also what was

2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:27.120
 interesting was I got to check in with what my desires were. So there was one thing of what

2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:31.520
 my actual prediction is, but what are my desires and could these desires be affecting my predictions

2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:36.560
 and so on. And that's a method of rationality. And I personally don't think it loses anything in

2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:40.560
 terms of, it didn't take any of the magic away from our relationship. Quite the opposite. It

2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:45.200
 brought us closer together because it was like, we did this weird fun thing that I appreciate.

2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:51.840
 A lot of people find quite strange. And I think it was somewhat unique in our relationship that

2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:56.640
 both of us are very, we both love numbers. We both love statistics. We're both poker players.

2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:04.960
 So this was kind of like our safe space anyway. For others, one partner really might not like

2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:08.640
 that kind of stuff at all, in which case it's not a good exercise to do. I don't recommend it to

2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:17.840
 everybody. But I do think it's interesting sometimes to poke holes in the probe at these

2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:24.720
 things that we consider so sacred that we can't try to quantify them, which is interesting because

2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:28.240
 that's intention with the idea of what we just talked about with beauty and what makes something

2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:31.840
 beautiful, the fact that you can't measure everything about it. And perhaps something

2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:38.560
 shouldn't be tried to measure. Maybe it's wrong to completely try and put a utilitarian

2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:44.160
 frame of measuring the utility of a tree in its entirety. I don't know. Maybe we should, maybe

2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:52.720
 we shouldn't. I'm ambivalent on that. But overall, people have too many biases. People

2:04:52.720 --> 2:05:00.560
 are overly biased against trying to do a quantified cost benefit analysis on really tough life

2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:07.040
 decisions. They're like, oh, just go with your gut. It's like, well, sure. But our intuitions

2:05:07.040 --> 2:05:11.120
 are best suited for things that we've got tons of experience in. Then we can really

2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:15.120
 trust on it if it's a decision we've made many times. But if it's like, should I marry this

2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:20.160
 person? Or should I buy this house over that house? You only make those decisions a couple

2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:27.360
 of times in your life, maybe. Well, I would love to know there's a balance that probably is a

2:05:27.360 --> 2:05:34.480
 personal balance of strike is the amount of rationality you apply to a question versus

2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:42.800
 the useful fiction, the fake it till you make it. For example, just talking to soldiers in Ukraine,

2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:53.520
 you ask them, what's the probability of you winning, Ukraine winning? Almost everybody

2:05:53.520 --> 2:06:00.480
 I talk to is 100%. Wow. And you listen to the experts. They say all kinds of stuff.

2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:08.080
 Right. First of all, the morale there is higher than probably enough. I've never been to a war

2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:15.200
 zone before this. But I've read about many wars. And I think the morale in Ukraine is higher than

2:06:15.200 --> 2:06:20.720
 almost anywhere I've read about. It's every single person in the country is proud to fight for their

2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:27.120
 country. Everybody, not just soldiers, not everybody. Why do you think that is specifically

2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:38.000
 more than in other wars? I think because there's perhaps a dormant desire for the citizens of

2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:44.560
 this country to find the identity of this country because it's been going through this 30 year

2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:50.800
 process of different factions and political bickering. And they haven't had, as they talk about,

2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:55.760
 they haven't had their independence war. They say all great nations have had an independence war.

2:06:55.760 --> 2:07:01.840
 They had to fight for their independence, for the discovery of the identity of the core of the ideals

2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:07.120
 that unify us. And they haven't had that. There's constantly been factions. There's been divisions.

2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:14.000
 There's been pressures from empires, from United States and from Russia, from NATO in Europe.

2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:18.400
 Everybody telling them what to do. Now they want to discover who they are. And there's that kind

2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:24.560
 of sense that we're going to fight for the safety of our homeland, but we're also going to fight for

2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:33.840
 our identity. And that on top of the fact that there's just, if you look at the history of Ukraine

2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:40.240
 and there's certain other countries like this, there are certain cultures are feisty in their

2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:48.240
 pride of being part of being the citizens of that nation. Ukraine is that, Poland was that.

2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:55.360
 You just look at history. In certain countries, you do not want to occupy. I mean, both Stalin and

2:07:55.360 --> 2:08:00.960
 Hitler talked about Poland in this way. They're like, this is a big problem if we occupy this

2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:05.280
 land for prolonged periods of time. They're going to be a pain in their ass. They're not going to

2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:11.360
 be want to be occupied. And certain other countries are like pragmatic. They're like, well, leaders

2:08:11.360 --> 2:08:19.840
 come and go. I guess this is good. Ukrainians, throughout the 20th century, don't seem to be

2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:28.880
 the kind of people that just sit calmly and let the quote unquote occupiers impose their

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.920
 roots. That's interesting though, because you said it's always been under conflict and leaders

2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:38.640
 have come and gone. So you would expect them to actually be the opposite under that reason.

2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:44.640
 Because it's a very fertile land. It's great for agriculture. So a lot of people want to,

2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:48.000
 I mean, I think they've developed this culture because they've constantly been occupied by

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:55.040
 different people for the different peoples. And so maybe there is something to that where

2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:01.840
 you've constantly had to feel like within the blood of the generations, there's the struggle for

2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:09.120
 or against the man, against the imposition of rules against oppression and all that kind of

2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:15.840
 stuff. And that stays with them. So there's a will there. But a lot of other aspects are also

2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:21.440
 part of that has to do with the reverse, small kind of situation where social media has definitely

2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:27.600
 played a part of it. Also different charismatic individuals have had to play a part. The fact

2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:36.800
 that the president of the nation, Zelensky, stayed in Kiev during the invasion is a huge

2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:43.280
 inspiration to them because most leaders, as you could imagine, when the capital of the nation is

2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:49.040
 under attack, the wise thing, the smart thing that the United States advised Zelensky to do

2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:56.000
 is to flee and to be the leader of the nation from a distant place. He said, fuck that,

2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:04.800
 I'm staying put. Everyone around him, there was a pressure to leave and he didn't. And that in

2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:11.280
 those singular acts really can unify a nation. There's a lot of people that criticize Zelensky

2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:18.720
 within Ukraine. Before the war, he was very unpopular, even still. But they put that aside

2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:26.080
 for the, especially that singular act of staying in the capital. Yeah, a lot of those kinds of things

2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:31.280
 come together to create something within people.

2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:42.240
 These things always, of course though, which, how zoomed out of a view do you want to take?

2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:48.000
 Because yeah, you describe it as like an anti Moloch thing happened within Ukraine because

2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:52.400
 it brought the Ukrainian people together in order to fight a common enemy. Maybe that's a good thing,

2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:56.960
 maybe that's a bad thing. In the end, we don't know how this is all going to play out. But if you

2:10:56.960 --> 2:11:11.440
 zoom it out on a global level, they're coming together to fight. That could make a conflict

2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:16.320
 larger. You know what I mean? I don't know what the right answer is here. It seems like a good

2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:20.480
 thing that they came together. But we don't know how this is all going to play out. If this all

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:23.920
 turns into a nuclear war, we'll be like, okay, that was the bad, that was... Oh yeah. So I was

2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:30.080
 describing the reverse Moloch for the local level. Exactly. Now, this is where the experts come in

2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:39.120
 and they say, well, if you channel most of the resources of the nation and the nation supporting

2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:47.440
 Ukraine into the war effort, are you not beating the drums of war that is much bigger than Ukraine?

2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:54.480
 In fact, even the Ukrainian leaders are speaking of it this way. This is not a war between two

2:11:54.480 --> 2:12:02.480
 nations. This is the early days of a world war. If we don't play this correctly. Yes.

2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:11.760
 We need cool heads from our leaders. From Ukraine's perspective, Ukraine needs to win the war

2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:20.880
 because what is winning the war mean is coming up, coming to peace negotiations, an agreement

2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:27.520
 that guarantees no more invasions. And then you make an agreement about what land belongs to

2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:35.760
 whom. You stop that. And basically, from their perspective is you want to demonstrate to the

2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:40.720
 rest of the world who's watching carefully, including Russia and China and different players on the

2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:47.040
 geopolitical stage, that this kind of conflict is not going to be productive if you engage in it.

2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:51.920
 So you want to teach everybody a lesson, let's not do World War III. It's going to be bad for

2:12:51.920 --> 2:13:01.600
 everybody. It's a lose, lose. It's a deep lose, lose. Doesn't matter. And I think that's actually

2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:11.840
 a correct, when I zoom out, 99% of what I think about is just individual human beings and human

2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:17.680
 lives and just that war is horrible. But when you zoom out and think from a geopolitics perspective,

2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:24.880
 we should realize that it's entirely possible that we will see a World War III in the 21st

2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:34.480
 century. And this is like a dress rehearsal for that. So the way we play this as a human

2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:39.520
 civilization will define whether we do or don't have a World War III.

2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:53.120
 You know, how we discuss war, how we discuss nuclear war, the kind of leaders we elect

2:13:53.120 --> 2:14:00.160
 and prop up, the kind of memes we circulate. Because you have to be very careful when you're

2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:10.400
 being pro Ukraine, for example, you have to realize that you are also indirectly feeding

2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:17.840
 the ever increasing military industrial complex. So be extremely careful that

2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:29.360
 when you say pro Ukraine or pro anybody, you're pro human beings, not pro the machine,

2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:38.000
 that creates narratives that says it's pro human beings. But it's actually if you look

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:45.760
 at the raw use of funds and resources, it's actually pro making weapons and shooting bullets

2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:51.840
 and dropping bombs. Right. The real, we have to just somehow get the meme into everyone's heads

2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:59.200
 that the real enemy is war itself. That's the enemy we need to defeat. And that doesn't mean

2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:07.520
 to say that there isn't justification for small local scenarios, adversarial conflicts. If you

2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:13.840
 have a leader who is starting wars, they're on the side of team war, basically. It's not that

2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:17.760
 they're on the side of team country, whatever that country is, it's they're on the side of team war.

2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:21.840
 So that needs to be stopped and put down. But you also have to find a way that your

2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:27.280
 corrective measure doesn't actually then end up being coopted by the war machine

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.600
 and creating greater war. Again, the playing field is finite. The scale of

2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:38.560
 conflict is now getting so big that the weapons that can be used are so mass destructive

2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:43.520
 that we can't afford another giant conflict. We just, we won't make it.

2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:49.440
 What existential threat in terms of us not making it, are you most worried about?

2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:53.360
 What existential threat to human civilization? We got like, let's go down a dark path, huh?

2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:59.040
 Well, no, it's a dark. No, it's like, well, we're in the somber place, we might as well.

2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:08.800
 Some of my best friends are dark paths. What worries you most? We mentioned

2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:16.480
 asteroids, we mentioned AGI, nuclear weapons. The one that's on my mind the most,

2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:21.840
 mostly because I think it's the one where we have actually a real chance to move the needle on

2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:26.720
 in a positive direction or more specifically stop some really bad things from happening,

2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:37.280
 really dumb, avoidable things is bioresks. In what kind of bioresks?

2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:43.520
 In terms of, yeah, so many. Of course, we have risks from natural pandemics,

2:16:43.520 --> 2:16:50.000
 naturally occurring viruses or pathogens. Then also as time and technology goes on and technology

2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:55.040
 becomes more and more democratized into the hands of more and more people, the risk of synthetic

2:16:55.040 --> 2:17:02.640
 pathogens. Whether or not you fall into the camp of COVID was gain of function,

2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:07.680
 accidental lab leak, or whether it was purely naturally occurring. Either way,

2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:17.520
 we are facing a future where synthetic pathogens or like, human meddled with pathogens

2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:25.520
 either accidentally get out or get into the hands of bad actors, whether they're omnicide or maniacs,

2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:32.880
 either way. That means we need more robustness for that. You would think that us having this nice

2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:39.600
 little dry run, which is what as awful as COVID was in all those poor people that died, it was

2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:48.160
 still like child's play compared to what a future one could be in terms of fatality rate.

2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:56.160
 We would then be much more robust in our pandemic preparedness. Meanwhile, the budget

2:17:57.520 --> 2:18:03.920
 in the last two years for the US, sorry, they just did this, I can't remember the name of what

2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:08.080
 the actual budget was, but it was like a multi trillion dollar budget that the US just set aside.

2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:13.120
 Originally in that, considering that COVID cost multiple trillions to the economy,

2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:19.840
 the original allocation in this new budget for future pandemic preparedness was $60 billion,

2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:26.480
 so tiny proportion of it. That proceeded to get whittled down to like $30 billion,

2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:32.080
 to $15 billion, all the way down to $2 billion out of multiple trillions for a thing that has

2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:36.080
 just cost us multiple trillions. We've just finished, we're barely even, we're not even

2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:40.480
 really out of it. It basically got whittled down to nothing because for some reason people think

2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:45.920
 that, oh right, we've got the pandemic out the way, that was that one. The reason for that is that

2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:51.840
 people are, and I say this with all due respect to a lot of the science community, but there's an

2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:59.440
 immense amount of naivety about, they think that nature is the main risk moving forward and it

2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:05.200
 really isn't. I think nothing demonstrates this more than this project that I was just reading

2:19:05.200 --> 2:19:11.520
 about that's sort of being proposed right now called Deep Vision. The idea is to go out into

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:17.360
 the wild, and we're not talking about just like within cities, deep into caves that people don't

2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:23.120
 go to, deep into the Arctic, wherever, scour the earth for whatever the most dangerous possible

2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:30.720
 pathogens could be, that they can find. Then not only do you try and find these, bring samples of

2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:36.640
 them back to laboratories. Again, whether you think COVID was a lab leak or not, I'm not going to

2:19:36.640 --> 2:19:41.680
 get into that, but we have historically had so many, as a civilization, we've had so many

2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:47.440
 lab leaks from even like the highest level security things. People should go and just read,

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:52.720
 it's like a comedy show of just how many they are, how leaky these labs are, even when they do their

2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:58.640
 best efforts. Bring these things then back to civilization. That's step one of the badness.

2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.720
 The next step would be to then categorize them, do experiments on them and categorize them by

2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:11.360
 their level of potential pandemic lethality. Then the piece of resistance on this plan is to then

2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:16.720
 publish that information freely on the internet about all these pathogens, including their genome,

2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:21.760
 which is literally like the building instructions of how to do them on the internet. This is something

2:20:21.760 --> 2:20:30.960
 that genuinely a pocket of the scientific community thinks is a good idea. I think on expectation,

2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:38.240
 and their argument is, oh, this is good because it might buy us some time to develop vaccines,

2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:42.080
 which, okay, sure, maybe would have made sense prior to mRNA technology, but

2:20:44.560 --> 2:20:49.840
 we can develop a vaccine now when we find a new pathogen within a couple of days.

2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:52.880
 Now then there's all the trials and so on. Those trials would have to happen anyway,

2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:57.520
 in the case of a brand new thing. You're saving maybe a couple of days, so that's the upside.

2:20:57.520 --> 2:21:03.600
 Meanwhile, the downside is, you're not only bringing the risk of these pathogens of getting

2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:09.760
 leaked, but you're literally handing it out to every bad actor on earth who would be doing

2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:16.400
 cartwheels. I'm talking about Kim Jong Un, ISIS, people who want, the rest of the world is their

2:21:16.400 --> 2:21:23.200
 enemy. In some cases, they think that killing themselves is a noble cause, and you're literally

2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:27.120
 giving them the building blocks of how to do this. It's the most batshit idea I've ever heard. On

2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:32.480
 expectation, it's probably minus EV of multiple billions of lives, if they actually succeeded

2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:37.680
 in doing this. Certainly in the tens or hundreds of millions. The cost benefit is so unbelievably,

2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:44.800
 it makes no sense. I was trying to wrap my head around, what's going wrong in people's minds

2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:50.560
 to think that this is a good idea. It's not that it's malice or anything like that. I think it's

2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:59.920
 that people don't, the proponents, they're actually overly naive about the interactions of

2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:05.600
 humanity. They're all bad actors who will use this for bad things. Because not only will it,

2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:12.000
 if you publish this information, even if a bad actor couldn't physically make it themselves,

2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:17.760
 which in 10 years time, the technologies are getting cheaper and easier to use.

2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:21.840
 But even if they couldn't make it, they could now bluff it. What would you do if there's some

2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:27.600
 deadly new virus that we've published on the internet in terms of its building blocks? Kim

2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:32.000
 Jong Un could be like, hey, if you don't let me build my nuclear weapons, I'm going to release

2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:35.760
 this. I've managed to build it. Well, now he's actually got a credible bluff. We don't know.

2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:40.880
 And so that's, it's just like handing the keys, it's handing weapons of mass destruction to

2:22:40.880 --> 2:22:47.120
 people. Makes no sense. The possible, I agree with you, but the possible world in which you might

2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:55.360
 make sense is if the good guys, which is a whole another problem defining who the good guys are,

2:22:55.360 --> 2:23:04.320
 but the good guys are like an order of magnitude, higher competence. And so they can stay ahead

2:23:04.320 --> 2:23:12.400
 of the bad actors by just being very good at the defense, by very good, not meaning like a little

2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:17.360
 bit better, but an order of magnitude better. But of course, the question is in each of those

2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:23.520
 individual disciplines, is that feasible? Can you, can the bad actors, even if they don't have

2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:30.240
 the competence, leap frog to the place where the good guys are? Yeah, I mean, I would agree in

2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:38.000
 principle, with pertaining to this like particular plan of like, that, you know, with the thing I

2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:41.120
 described this deep vision thing, where at least then that would maybe make sense for

2:23:41.120 --> 2:23:44.960
 steps one and step two of like getting the information, but then why would you release

2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:50.960
 it, the information to your literal enemies? You know, that's, that makes, that doesn't fit at all

2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:54.800
 in that perspective of like trying to be ahead of them. You're literally handing them the weapon.

2:23:54.800 --> 2:24:00.960
 But there's different levels of release, right? So there's the kind of secrecy where you don't

2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:07.520
 give it to anybody. But there's a release where you incrementally give it to like major labs.

2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:11.680
 So it's not public release, but it's like, you're giving it to different layers of

2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:17.520
 reasonability. But the problem there is it's going to, if you go anywhere beyond like complete

2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:22.000
 secrecy, it's going to leak. That's the thing. It's very hard to keep secrets. And so that's

2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:28.000
 still, so you might as well release it to the public is that argument. So you either go complete

2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:34.640
 secrecy or you release it to the public. So, which is essentially the same thing. It's going to leak

2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:39.680
 anyway. If you don't do complete secrecy, right? Which is why you shouldn't get the information

2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:45.440
 in the first place. Yeah. I mean, what in that, I think, well, that's a solution. Yeah. The solution

2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:50.080
 is either don't get the information in the first place or be keep, keep it incredibly,

2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:55.520
 incredibly contained. See, I think, I think it really matters which discipline we're talking

2:24:55.520 --> 2:25:00.400
 about. So in the case of biology, I do think you're a very right. We shouldn't even be,

2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:08.080
 it should be forbidden to even like, think about that. Meaning don't collect, don't just even

2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:13.680
 collect the information, but like, don't do, I mean, gain of function research is a really iffy

2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:18.480
 area. Like you start, I mean, it's all about cost benefits, right? There are some scenarios

2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:22.720
 that I could imagine the cost benefit of a gain of function research is very, very clear,

2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:27.360
 where you've evaluated all the potential risks factored in the probability that things can go

2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:31.680
 wrong. And like, you know, not only known unknowns, but unknown unknowns as well, tried to quantify

2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:36.240
 that. And then even then it's like orders of magnitude better to do that. I'm behind that

2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:40.640
 argument. But the point is, is that there's this like naivety that's preventing people from even

2:25:40.640 --> 2:25:46.400
 doing the cost benefit properly on a lot of the things. Because, you know, the science community,

2:25:46.400 --> 2:25:50.640
 they're like, again, I don't want to bucket the science community, but like some people within

2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:54.880
 the science community just think that everyone's, everyone's good and everyone just cares about

2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:58.000
 getting knowledge and doing the best for the world. And unfortunately, that's not the case. I

2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:03.520
 wish we lived in that world, but we don't. Yeah, I mean, there's a lie. Listen, I've been

2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:09.120
 criticizing the science community broadly quite a bit. There's so many brilliant people that

2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:13.600
 brilliance is somehow hindering sometimes because it has a bunch of blind spots. And then you start

2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:20.800
 to look at a history of science, how easily it's been used by dictators to any conclusion they want.

2:26:20.800 --> 2:26:25.920
 And it's, it's, it's dark, how you can use brilliant people that like playing the little

2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:30.560
 game of science, because it is a fun game. You know, you're building, you're going to conferences,

2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:35.600
 you're building on top of each other's ideas, breakthroughs. I think I've realized how this

2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:39.600
 particular molecule works and I could do this kind of experiment and everyone else is impressed.

2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:43.600
 Oh, cool. No, I think you're wrong. Let me show you why you're wrong. And that little game,

2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:47.120
 everyone gets really excited and they get excited. Well, it came up with a pill that

2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:51.280
 solves this problem and it's going to help a bunch of people. And I came up with a giant study

2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:56.240
 that shows the exact probability it's going to help or not. And you get lost in this game

2:26:56.240 --> 2:27:03.840
 and you forget to realize this game, just like Molek, it can have like unintended consequences

2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:12.800
 and unintended consequences that might destroy human civilization or divide human civilization

2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:19.600
 or have dire geopolitical consequences. I mean, the effects of, I mean, it's just so,

2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:25.680
 the most destructive effects of COVID have nothing to do with the biology of the virus,

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:31.600
 it seems like. I mean, I could just list them forever. But like one of them is the complete

2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:36.800
 distrust of public institutions. The other one is because of that public distrust, I feel like if

2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:44.560
 a much worse pandemic came along, we as a world have now cried wolf. And if an actual wolf now

2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:50.800
 comes, people will be like, fuck masks, fuck vaccines, fuck everything. And they won't be,

2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:55.520
 they'll distrust every single thing that any major institution is going to tell them.

2:27:55.520 --> 2:28:06.080
 Yeah. Because that's the thing, there were certain actions made by certain health public figures

2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:12.160
 where they told, they very knowingly told, it was a white lie, it was intended in the best possible

2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:21.440
 way such as early on when there was clearly a shortage of masks. And so they said to the public,

2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:27.520
 oh, don't get masks, there's no evidence that they work. Don't get them, they don't work. In fact,

2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:32.000
 it might even make it worse. You might even spread it more. That was the real stinker.

2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:36.800
 Yeah, no, no. Unless you know how to do it properly, you're going to get sicker or you're

2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:43.200
 more likely to catch the virus, which is just absolute crap. And they put that out there. And

2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:47.440
 it's pretty clear the reason why they did that was because there was actually a shortage of masks

2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:53.680
 because then they really needed it for health workers, which makes sense. I agree. But the

2:28:53.680 --> 2:29:01.200
 cost of lying to the public when that then comes out, people aren't as stupid as they think they

2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:07.440
 are. And that's, I think, where this distrust of experts has largely come from. A, they've lied

2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:14.240
 to people overtly. But B, people have been treated like idiots. Now, that's not to say that a lot

2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:18.560
 of stupid people who have a lot of wacky ideas around COVID and all sorts of things. But if you

2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:23.440
 treat the general public like children, they're going to see that they're going to notice that and

2:29:23.440 --> 2:29:28.640
 that is going to just like absolutely decimate the trust in the public institutions that we depend

2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:34.560
 upon. And honestly, the best thing that could happen, I wish like if like Fauci or, you know,

2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:39.280
 and these other like leaders who I mean, God, I would, I can't imagine how nightmare his job

2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:44.720
 has been for the last few years, hell on earth. Like, so, you know, I have a lot of sort of

2:29:44.720 --> 2:29:49.280
 sympathy for the position he's been in. But like, if he could just come out and be like, okay, look,

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:54.960
 guys, hands up, we didn't handle this as well as we could have. These are all the things I would

2:29:54.960 --> 2:29:59.360
 have done differently in hindsight. I apologize for this and this and this and this. That would go

2:29:59.360 --> 2:30:04.400
 so far. And maybe I'm being naive. Who knows, maybe this would backfire. But I don't think it

2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:08.240
 would like to someone like me even, because I've like, I've lost trust in a lot of these things.

2:30:08.240 --> 2:30:12.080
 I'm, I'm fortunate that at least no people who I can go to who I think are good, like have good

2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:16.320
 epistemics on this stuff. But, you know, if they, if they could sort of put their hands on, we go,

2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:21.360
 okay, these are the spots where we screwed up this, this, this. This was our reasons. Yeah,

2:30:21.360 --> 2:30:24.800
 we actually told a little white lie here, we did it for this reason, we're really sorry,

2:30:24.800 --> 2:30:28.000
 but they just did the radical honesty thing, the radical transparency thing.

2:30:28.560 --> 2:30:33.120
 That would go so far to build rebuilding public trust. And I think that's what needs to happen.

2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:39.680
 Yeah, I totally agree with you. Unfortunately, his job was very tough and all those kinds of things,

2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:47.680
 but I see arrogance and arrogance prevented him from being honest in that way previously.

2:30:47.680 --> 2:30:53.440
 And I think arrogance will prevent him from being honest in that way. Now we need leaders. I think

2:30:53.440 --> 2:31:01.200
 young people are seeing that, that kind of talking down to people from a position of power.

2:31:01.200 --> 2:31:08.000
 Or I hope is, is the way of the past. People really like authenticity and they, they like

2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:14.720
 leaders that are like a man and a woman of the people. And I think that just,

2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:19.200
 I mean, he still has a chance to do that, I think. I mean, I don't think, you know,

2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:23.840
 if I doubt he's listening, but if he is like, hey, I, I think, you know,

2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:26.400
 I don't think he's irredeemable by any means. I think there's, you know,

2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:31.360
 I don't, I don't have an opinion of whether there was arrogance or there or not. Just know that,

2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:37.040
 I think, like coming clean on the, you know, it's understandable to have fucked up during

2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:41.040
 this pandemic. Like I won't expect any government to handle it well because it was so difficult,

2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:47.360
 like so many moving pieces, so much like lack of information and so on. But the step to

2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:51.600
 rebuilding trust is to go, okay, look, we're doing a scrutiny of where we went wrong. And I,

2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:55.040
 and for my part, I did this wrong in this part. And that would be huge.

2:31:55.040 --> 2:31:59.840
 All of us can do that. I mean, I was struggling for a while whether I want to talk to him or not.

2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:06.000
 I talked to his boss, Francis Collins. Another person that's screwed up in terms of trust,

2:32:07.920 --> 2:32:14.960
 lost a little bit of my respect too. There seems to have been a kind of dishonesty in the,

2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:24.480
 in the back rooms, in that they didn't trust people to be intelligent. Like we need to tell them

2:32:24.480 --> 2:32:28.240
 what's good for them. We know what's good for them. That kind of idea.

2:32:28.880 --> 2:32:34.880
 To be fair, the thing that's, what's it called? I heard the phrase today,

2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:40.240
 nut picking. Social media does that. So you've got like nitpicking. Nut picking is where

2:32:41.040 --> 2:32:46.720
 the craziest stupidest, you know, if you have a group of people, let's call, you know, let's say

2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:50.400
 people who are vaccine, I don't like the term anti vaccine, people who are vaccine hesitant,

2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:56.640
 vaccine speculative, you know, what social media did or the media or anyone, you know,

2:32:57.200 --> 2:33:01.840
 their opponents would do is pick the craziest example. So the ones who are like,

2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:07.360
 you know, I think I need to inject myself with motor oil up my ass or something, you know,

2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:12.880
 select the craziest ones and then have that beamed to, you know, so from like someone like Fauci

2:33:12.880 --> 2:33:16.880
 or Francis's perspective, that's what they get because they're getting the same social media

2:33:16.880 --> 2:33:20.800
 stuff as us. They're getting the same media reports. I mean, they might get some more information,

2:33:20.800 --> 2:33:25.840
 but they too are going to get these, the nuts portrayed to them. So they probably have a

2:33:25.840 --> 2:33:29.040
 misrepresentation of what the actual public's intelligence is.

2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:33.520
 Well, that actually, that just, yes, and that just means they're not social media savvy.

2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:37.680
 So one of the skills of being on social media is to be able to filter that in your mind,

2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:40.000
 like to understand, to put into proper context.

2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:45.040
 To realize that what you are seeing to social media is not anywhere near an accurate representation

2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:46.480
 of humanity.

2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:51.280
 Not picking a letter. And there's nothing wrong with putting motor oil up your ass.

2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:56.560
 It's just one, it's one of the better aspects. I do this every weekend. Okay.

2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:00.160
 How did that analogy come from in my mind? Like what?

2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:04.560
 I don't know. I think you need to, there's some Freudian thing you would need to deeply

2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:09.120
 investigate with a therapist. Okay. What about AI? Are you worried about

2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:15.920
 AI, superintelligence systems, or paperclip maximizer type of situation?

2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:24.320
 Yes. I'm definitely worried about it. But I feel kind of bipolar in the, some days I wake up and

2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:26.000
 I'm like, you're excited about the future?

2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:29.920
 Well, exactly. I'm like, wow, we can unlock the mysteries of the universe, you know, escape the

2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:35.920
 game. And this, this, you know, because I spend all my time thinking about these

2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:39.840
 Molyke problems that, you know, what, what is the solution to them? What, you know,

2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:45.280
 in some ways you need this like omnibenevolent, omniscient, omnivise

2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:52.400
 coordination mechanism that can like make us all not do the, the, the Molyke thing.

2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:57.680
 Or like provide the infrastructure or redesign the system so that it's not vulnerable to this

2:34:57.680 --> 2:35:02.720
 Molyke process. And in some ways, you know, that's, that's the strongest argument to me for

2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:07.120
 like the race to build AGI is that maybe, you know, we can't survive without it.

2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:14.480
 But the flip side to that is the, the, the, the, the, unfortunately now that there's multiple

2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:19.360
 actors trying to build AI, AGI, you know, this was, this was fine 10 years ago when it was just

2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:24.000
 DeepMind, but then other companies started up and now it created a race dynamic. Now it's like,

2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:28.240
 that's the whole thing is at the same, it's got the same problem. It's like,

2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:33.760
 whichever company is the one that like optimizes for speed at the cost of safety will get the

2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:37.760
 competitive advantage. And so we, we're the more likely the ones to build the AGI, you know, and,

2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:41.600
 and that's the same cycle that you're in. And there's no clear solution to that because you

2:35:41.600 --> 2:35:49.680
 can't just go like slapping, you know, the, if you go and try and like stop all the different

2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:55.520
 companies, then it will, you know, the good ones will stop because they're the ones, you know,

2:35:55.520 --> 2:35:59.840
 within, you know, within the West's reach, but then that leaves all the other ones to continue.

2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:04.080
 And then they're even more likely. So it's like, it's a very difficult problem with no clean solution.

2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:12.000
 And, you know, at the same time, you know, I know the, at least some of the folks at DeepMind

2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:15.040
 and they're incredible and they're thinking about this, they're very aware of this problem. And

2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:18.480
 they're like, you know, I think some of the smartest people on earth.

2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:22.080
 Yeah, the culture is important there because they are thinking about that and they're

2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:29.280
 there. Some of the best machine learning engineers. So it's possible to have a company or a community

2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:33.680
 of people that are both great engineers and are thinking about the philosophical topics.

2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:38.160
 Exactly. And importantly, they're also game theorists, you know, and because this is ultimately

2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:43.440
 a game theory problem, the thing this, this mollock mechanism and like, you know, what this rate,

2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.600
 how do we voice rate your arms race scenarios? You need people who aren't naive to be thinking

2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:53.840
 about this. And again, like, luckily, there's a lot of smart, non naive game theorists within

2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:58.320
 that group. Yes, I'm concerned about it. And I think it's again, a thing that we need

2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:05.280
 people to be thinking about in terms of like, how do we create, how do we mitigate the arms race

2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:11.760
 dynamics? And how do we solve the thing of it? It's got, Bostrom calls it the orthogonality

2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:17.360
 problem, whereby, because obviously there's a chance, you know, the belief, the hope is,

2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:22.480
 is that you build something that's super intelligent. And by definition of being super

2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:27.760
 intelligent, it will also become super wise and have the wisdom to know what the right goals are.

2:37:27.760 --> 2:37:33.600
 And hopefully those goals include keeping humanity alive, right? But Bostrom says that

2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:38.000
 actually those two things, you know, on super intelligence and super wisdom,

2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:43.440
 aren't necessarily correlated. They're actually kind of orthogonal things. And how do we make

2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:46.640
 it so that they are correlated? How do we guarantee it? Because we need it to be guaranteed,

2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:48.800
 really, to know that we're doing the thing safely.

2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:55.840
 But I think that like, merging of intelligence and wisdom, at least my hope is that this whole

2:37:55.840 --> 2:38:00.640
 process happens sufficiently slowly, that we're constantly having these kinds of debates,

2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:08.000
 that we have enough time to, to figure out how to modify each version of the system as it

2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:12.480
 becomes more and more intelligent. Yes, buying time is a good thing, definitely. Anything that

2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:19.200
 slows everything down. We just, everyone needs to chill out. We've got millennia to figure this out.

2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:27.760
 Or at least, at least, well, it depends again, some people think that, you know,

2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:31.360
 we can't even make it through the next few decades without having some kind of

2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:38.560
 omnibus coordination mechanism. And there's also an argument to that. Yeah, I don't know.

2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:44.240
 Well, there is, I'm suspicious of that kind of thinking, because it seems like the entirety

2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:50.640
 of human history has people in it that are like predicting doom just around the corner.

2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:58.640
 There's something about us that is strangely attracted to that thought. It's almost like

2:38:58.640 --> 2:39:04.000
 fun to think about the destruction of everything. Just objectively speaking,

2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:12.400
 I've talked and listened to a bunch of people and they are gravitating towards that. I think

2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:16.960
 it's the same thing that people love about conspiracy theories, is they love to be the

2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:23.200
 person that kind of figured out some deep fundamental thing about the, that's going to be,

2:39:23.200 --> 2:39:28.240
 it's going to mark something extremely important about the history of human civilization,

2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:37.520
 because then I will be important. When in reality, most of us will be forgotten and life will go on.

2:39:37.520 --> 2:39:42.480
 And one of the sad things about whenever anything traumatic happens to you, whenever

2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:50.800
 you lose loved ones, or just tragedy happens, you realize life goes on. Even after a nuclear war,

2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:59.840
 that will wipe out some large percentage of the population and will torture people for years

2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:06.080
 to come because of the sort of, I mean, the effects of a nuclear winter. People will still

2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:11.360
 survive. Life will still go on. I mean, it depends on the kind of nuclear war. But in

2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.680
 case of a nuclear war, it will still go on. That's one of the amazing things about life.

2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:22.400
 It finds a way. And so in that sense, I just, I feel like the doom and gloom thing is a...

2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:26.000
 Well, yeah, we don't want a self fulfilling prophecy.

2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:27.360
 Yes, that's exactly.

2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:34.560
 Yes. And I very much agree with that. And I even have a slight feeling from the amount of time

2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:40.000
 we spent in this conversation talking about this, because it's like, is this even a net positive

2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:45.840
 if it's like making everyone feel, in some ways, like making people imagine these bad scenarios

2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:51.600
 can be a self fulfilling prophecy. But at the same time, that's weighed off with at least

2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:55.840
 making people aware of the problem and gets them thinking. And I think particularly,

2:40:55.840 --> 2:40:59.840
 you know, the reason why I want to talk about this to your audience is that on average,

2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:03.200
 they're the type of people who gravitate towards these kind of topics because they're

2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:06.880
 intellectually curious and they can sort of sense that there's trouble brewing.

2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:10.640
 Yeah. They can smell that there's, you know, I think there's a reason people are thinking

2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:15.120
 about this stuff a lot is because the probability, the probability for, you know,

2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:18.240
 it's increased in probability over the, certainly over the last few years,

2:41:19.200 --> 2:41:26.240
 trajectory's have not gone favorably. Let's put it, you know, since 2010. So it's right,

2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:30.480
 I think, for people to be thinking about it. But that's where they're like, I think,

2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:34.320
 whether it's a useful fiction or whether it's actually true or whatever you want to call it,

2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:38.960
 I think having this faith, this is where faith is valuable, because it gives you at

2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:43.760
 least this like anchor of hope. And I, and I'm not just saying it to like trick myself,

2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:46.800
 like I do truly, I do think there's something out there that wants us to win.

2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:47.600
 Yeah.

2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:52.240
 I think there's something that really wants us to win. And it just, you just have to be like,

2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:57.760
 just like, okay, now I sound really crazy, but like, open your heart to it a little bit.

2:41:57.760 --> 2:42:06.160
 Yeah. And it will give you the like, the sort of breathing room with which to marinate

2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:10.480
 on the solutions. We are the ones who have to come up with solutions, but

2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:19.200
 we can use that there's like, there's hashtag positivity. There's value in that.

2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:24.880
 Yeah. You have to kind of imagine all the destructive trajectories that lay in our future

2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:32.160
 and then believe in the possibility of avoiding those trajectories. All while you said audience,

2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:37.200
 all while sitting back, which is majority, the two people that listen to this are probably sitting

2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:46.640
 on a beach smoking some weed. That's a beautiful sunset. They're looking at just the waves going

2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:53.760
 in and out. And ultimately, there's a kind of deep belief there in the momentum of humanity to

2:42:53.760 --> 2:43:00.880
 figure it all out. But we've got a lot of work to do. Which is what makes this whole simulation,

2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:08.080
 this video game kind of fun. This battle of polytopia. I still, man, I love those games so

2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:13.600
 much. That's so good. And that one for people who don't know, but battle polytopia is a big,

2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:20.400
 is like a, is this really radical some simplification of a civilization type of game.

2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:28.480
 It still has a lot of the skill tree development, a lot of the strategy. But it's easy enough to

2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:33.680
 play on a phone. Yeah. It's kind of interesting. They've really figured it out. It's one of the

2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:38.800
 most elegantly designed games I've ever seen. It's incredibly complex. And yet being, again,

2:43:38.800 --> 2:43:42.160
 it walks that line between complexity and simplicity in this really, really great way.

2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:49.600
 And they use pretty colors that hack the dopamine reward circuits in our brains very well.

2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:56.720
 It's fun. Video games are so fun. Most of this life is just about fun, escaping all the suffering

2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:02.400
 to find the fun. What's energy healing? I have in my notes energy healing question mark. What's

2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:12.640
 that about? Oh, man. God, your audience is going to think I'm mad. So the two crazy things that

2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.000
 happened to me, the one was the voice in the head that said, you're going to win this tournament.

2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:23.440
 And then I won the tournament. The other craziest thing that's happened to me was in 2018,

2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:34.160
 I started getting this weird problem in my ear where it was low frequency sound distortion

2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:39.280
 where voices, particularly men's voices, became incredibly unpleasant to listen to.

2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:44.800
 It would create this. It would be falsely amplified or something. And it was almost

2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:50.080
 like a physical sensation in my ear, which was really unpleasant. And it would last for a few

2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:54.000
 hours and then go away and then come back for a few hours and go away. And I went and got hearing

2:44:54.000 --> 2:45:02.880
 tests and they found that the bottom end, I was losing the hearing in that ear. And in the end,

2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:08.800
 I got, doctors said they think it was this thing called Meniere's disease, which is this very

2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:12.800
 unpleasant disease where people basically end up losing their hearing, but they get this like,

2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:17.520
 it often comes with like dizzy spells and other things because it's like the inner ear gets all

2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:23.360
 messed up. Now, I don't know if that's actually what I had, but that's what at least a couple of

2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:27.440
 one doctor said to me. But anyway, so I'd had three months of this stuff, this going on,

2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:32.880
 it was really getting me down. And then I was at Burning Man of all places. I don't mean to be

2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:38.400
 that person talking about Burning Man, but I was there. And again, I'd had it and I was unable

2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:42.400
 to listen to music, which is not what you want, because Burning Man is a very loud, intense place.

2:45:42.400 --> 2:45:47.840
 And I was just having a really rough time. And on the final night, I get talking to this girl

2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:52.160
 who's like a friend of a friend. And I mentioned, I was like, oh, I'm really down in the dumps about

2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:55.760
 this. And she's like, oh, well, I've done a little bit of energy healing. Would you like me to have

2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:03.040
 a look? And I was like, sure. Now, this is again, deep, I was, you know, no time in my life for

2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:06.560
 this. I didn't believe in any of this stuff. I was just like, it's all bullshit. It's all wooing

2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:14.000
 nonsense. I was like, sure, have a go. And she starts with her hand and she says, oh,

2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:19.280
 there's something there. And then she leans in and she starts sucking over my ear, not actually

2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:24.240
 touching me, but close to it with her mouth. And it was really unpleasant. I was like, well,

2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:26.400
 can you stop? She's like, no, no, no, there's something there. I need to get it. And I was

2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:30.080
 like, no, no, no, I really don't like it. Please. This is really loud. She's like, I need to just

2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:34.560
 bear with me. And she does it. And I don't know how long for a few minutes. And then she eventually

2:46:34.560 --> 2:46:42.240
 collapses on the ground, like freezing cold crying. And I'm just like, I don't know what the hell is

2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:46.000
 going on. I mean, I thoroughly freaked out, as is everyone else watching, just like, what the

2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:52.960
 hell? I mean, like, warm her up. And she was like, what? She was really shaken up. And she's like,

2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:58.560
 I don't know what that, she said it was something very unpleasant and dark. Don't worry, it's gone.

2:46:58.560 --> 2:47:01.360
 I think you'll be fine in a couple, you'll have the physical symptoms for a couple of weeks and

2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:07.760
 you'll be fine. But, you know, she was just like that. You know, so I was, I was so rattled, A,

2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:12.960
 because the potential that actually I had had something bad in me that made someone feel bad,

2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:17.760
 and that she was scared. That was what, you know, I was like, wait, I thought you do this,

2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:22.400
 this is a thing. Now you're terrified, like you pulled like some kind of exorcism or something

2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:30.400
 like that. What the fuck is going on? So it, like just the most insane experience. And frankly,

2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:37.760
 it took me like a few months to sort of emotionally recover from it. But my ear problem went away

2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:43.120
 about a couple of weeks later. And touch wood, I've not had any issues since. So

2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:49.600
 that gives you like hints that maybe there's something out there.

2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:57.040
 I mean, I don't, I, again, I don't have an explanation for this. The most probable explanation

2:47:57.040 --> 2:48:00.480
 was, you know, I was a burning man. I was in a very open state. Let's just leave it at that.

2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:10.240
 And, you know, placebo is an incredibly powerful thing and a very not understood thing.

2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:14.720
 So almost assigning the word placebo to it reduces it down to a way that

2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:19.040
 it doesn't deserve to be reduced down. Maybe there's a whole science of what we call placebo.

2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:25.520
 Maybe there's a placebo is a door. Self healing. Yeah. You know, and I mean, I don't know what the

2:48:25.520 --> 2:48:29.360
 problem was. Like I was told it was many years. I don't want to say I definitely had that because

2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:32.240
 I don't want people to think that, oh, that's how, you know, if they do have that, because it's

2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:35.200
 terrible disease. And if they have that, that this is going to be a guaranteed way for it to fix

2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:41.200
 for them. I don't know. And I also don't, I don't, you're absolutely right to say, like,

2:48:41.200 --> 2:48:48.000
 using even the word placebo is like, it comes with this like baggage of, of like frame. And I

2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:52.720
 don't want to reduce it down. All I can do is describe the experience and what happened.

2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:59.920
 I cannot put an ontological framework around it. I can't say why it happened, what the mechanism was,

2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:05.040
 what the problem even was in the first place. I just know that something crazy happened.

2:49:05.040 --> 2:49:09.360
 And it was while I was in an open state. And fortunately for me, it made the problem go away.

2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:14.000
 But what I took away from it, again, it was part of this, you know, this took me on this

2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:18.640
 journey of becoming more humble about what I think I know. Because as I said before, I was like,

2:49:18.640 --> 2:49:23.600
 I was in the like Richard Dawkins train of atheism in terms of there is no God. There's

2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:27.200
 everything like that is bullshit. We know everything. We know, you know, the only way we

2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:32.240
 can get through, we know how medicine works and its molecules and chemical interactions and that

2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:39.120
 kind of stuff. And now it's like, okay, well, there's, there's clearly more for us to understand.

2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:46.400
 And that doesn't mean that it's ascientific as well. Because, you know, the beauty of the scientific

2:49:46.400 --> 2:49:51.200
 method is that it still, it still can apply to this situation. Like I don't see why, you know,

2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:56.000
 I would like to try and test this experimentally. I haven't really, you know, I don't know how we

2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.600
 would go about doing that, we'd have to find other people with the same condition, I guess, and like

2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:06.000
 try and repeat repeat the experiment. But it doesn't just because something happens,

2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:10.960
 that's sort of out of the realms of our current understanding, it doesn't mean that

2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:13.680
 it's the scientific method can't be used for it.

2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:20.080
 Yeah, I think the scientific method sits on a foundation of those kinds of experiences.

2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:31.440
 Because a scientific method is a process to carve away at the mystery all around us. And

2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:37.200
 experiences like this is just a reminder that we're mostly shrouded in mystery still. That's it.

2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:40.880
 It's just like a humility. Like we haven't really figured this whole thing out.

2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:47.360
 But at the same time, we have found ways to act, you know, we're clearly doing something right,

2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:50.800
 because think of the technological scientific advancements, the knowledge that we have,

2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:55.200
 that blow people's minds even from 100 years ago.

2:50:55.200 --> 2:51:01.120
 Yeah, and we've even allegedly got out to space and landed on the moon. Although I still haven't,

2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:06.240
 I have not seen evidence of the earth being round, but I'm keeping an open mind.

2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:11.200
 Speaking of which, you studied physics in astrophysics.

2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:20.800
 Just to go to that and just to jump around through the fascinating life you've had,

2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:28.400
 how did that come to be? When did you fall in love with astronomy and space and things like this?

2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:34.560
 As early as I can remember. I was very lucky that my mom and my dad, but particularly my mom,

2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:41.040
 my mom is like the most nature. She is Mother Earth. It's the only way to describe her.

2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:46.320
 Just she's like, Dr. Do little animals flock to her and just like sit and look at her adoringly.

2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:47.680
 And she sings.

2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:52.960
 Yeah, she's just, she just is Mother Earth. And she has always been fascinated by,

2:51:54.160 --> 2:51:57.520
 you know, she doesn't have any, you know, she never went to university or anything like that.

2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:01.440
 She's actually phobic of maths. If I try and get her to like, you know, I was trying to teach her

2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:09.520
 poker when she hated it. But she's so deeply curious. And that just got instilled in me when,

2:52:09.520 --> 2:52:13.040
 you know, we would sleep out under the stars whenever it was, you know, the two nights a year

2:52:13.040 --> 2:52:18.560
 when it was warm enough in the UK to do that. And we'll just lie out there until we fell asleep

2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:24.160
 looking at looking for satellites, looking for shooting stars. And I was just always,

2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:27.760
 I don't know whether it was from that, but I've always naturally gravitated to like

2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:34.320
 the biggest, the biggest questions. And also the like, the most layers of abstraction.

2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:37.920
 I love just like, what's the meta question? What's the meta question and so on.

2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:42.640
 So I think it just came from that really. And, and, and then on top of that, like physics,

2:52:43.680 --> 2:52:50.560
 you know, it also made logical sense in that it was a, it was, it was the degree, it was a degree

2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:55.360
 that was subject to tick the box of being, you know, answering these really big picture questions,

2:52:55.360 --> 2:53:01.440
 but it was also extremely useful. It like has a very high utility in terms of, I didn't know

2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:05.040
 necessarily, I thought I was going to become like a research scientist. My original plan was,

2:53:05.040 --> 2:53:08.960
 I want to be a professional astronomer. So it's not just like a philosophy degree that asks the

2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:15.840
 big questions. And it's not like biology in the path to go to medical school or something like

2:53:15.840 --> 2:53:24.160
 that, which is overly pragmatic, not overly is, is very pragmatic. But this is, yeah, physics is

2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:28.720
 a good combination of the two. Yeah, at least for me, it made sense. And I was good at it. I

2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:33.840
 liked it. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't like I did an immense amount of soul searching to choose it or

2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:39.600
 anything. It just was like this. It made the most sense. I mean, you have to make this decision

2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:45.760
 in the UK age 17, which is crazy. Because, you know, in US, you go the first year, you do a bunch

2:53:45.760 --> 2:53:50.320
 of stuff, right? And then you choose your major. I think the first few years of college, you focus

2:53:50.320 --> 2:53:56.720
 on the drugs and only as you get closer to the end, do you start to think, oh, shit, this wasn't

2:53:56.720 --> 2:54:04.800
 about that. And I'm, I owe the government a lot of money. How many alien civilizations are out

2:54:04.800 --> 2:54:09.600
 there? When you, when you looked up at the stars with your mom, and you were counting them,

2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:16.720
 what's your mom think about the number of alien civilizations? I don't know. I would imagine

2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:21.440
 she would take the viewpoint of, you know, she's pretty humble. And she knows how many, she knows

2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:26.640
 there's a huge number of potential spawn sites out there. So she would spawn sites, spawn sites.

2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:31.520
 Yeah. You know, this is our spawn site. Yeah. Spawn sites in Polytopia. We spawned on Earth.

2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:39.760
 You know, it's, hmm. Yeah. Spawn sites. Why does that feel weird to say spawn? Because it makes

2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:47.280
 me feel like it's, there's only one source of life and it's spawning in different locations.

2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:51.920
 That's why the word spawn, because like, it feels like life that originated on Earth

2:54:52.640 --> 2:55:00.480
 really originated here. Right. It is, it is unique to this particular. Yeah. I mean, but I don't,

2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:04.720
 in my mind, it doesn't exclude, you know, the completely different forms of life and

2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:12.400
 different biochemical soups can't also spawn. But I guess it implies that there's some spark

2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:18.320
 that is, which I kind of like the idea of. And then I get to think about respawning

2:55:19.040 --> 2:55:26.000
 like after it dies. Like what happens if life on Earth ends? Is it, is it going to restart again?

2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:30.880
 Probably not. It depends. Maybe Earth is too. It depends on the type of, you know, what's the

2:55:30.880 --> 2:55:35.280
 thing that kills it, kills it off, right? If it's a paperclip maximizer, not, you know, for the,

2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:41.360
 for the example, but, you know, some kind of very self replicating, you know, high on the

2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:47.200
 capabilities, very low on the wisdom type thing. So whether that's, you know, gray goo, green goo,

2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:52.720
 you know, like nanobots or just a shitty, misaligned AI that thinks it needs to turn

2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:58.240
 everything into paperclips. You know, if it's something like that, then it's going to be very

2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:03.040
 hard for life, you know, complex life. Because by definition, you know, a paperclip maximizer

2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:08.320
 is the ultimate instantiation of Moloch. Deeply low complexity, over optimization on a single

2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:12.000
 thing, sacrificing everything else, turning the whole world into. Although something tells me,

2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:17.600
 like if we actually take a paperclip maximizer, it destroys everything. It's a really dumb system

2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:25.440
 that just envelops the whole of Earth. And it diverts beyond. I didn't, I didn't know that part.

2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:30.080
 But okay, great. So it becomes a multi planetary paperclip maximizer.

2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:34.000
 Well, it just, it just propagates. I mean, it depends whether it figures out how to jump the

2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:40.080
 vacuum gap. But again, I mean, this is all silly, because it's a hypothetical thought experiment,

2:56:40.080 --> 2:56:43.600
 which I think doesn't actually have much practical application to the AI safety problem. But

2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:47.600
 it's just a fun thing to play around with. But if by definition, it is maximally intelligent,

2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:53.760
 which means it is maximally good at navigating the environment around it in order to achieve its

2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:58.720
 goal, but extremely bad at choosing goals in the first place. So again, we're talking on this

2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:04.080
 orthogonality thing, right? It's very low on wisdom, but very high on capability. Then it will

2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:08.320
 figure out how to jump the vacuum gap between planets and stars and so on. And thus just turn

2:57:08.320 --> 2:57:13.200
 every atom it gets its hands on into paperclips. Yeah, by the way, for people who which is maximum

2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:18.400
 virality, by the way, that's what virality is. But it does not mean that virality is necessarily

2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:22.160
 all about maximizing paperclips. In that case, it is. So for people who don't know,

2:57:22.160 --> 2:57:28.640
 this is just a thought experiment example of an AI system that has a goal and is willing to do

2:57:28.640 --> 2:57:33.360
 anything to accomplish that goal, including destroying all life on earth and all human

2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:39.840
 life and all of consciousness in the universe for the goal of producing a maximum number of paperclips.

2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:44.880
 Okay. Or whatever its optimization function was that it was set up.

2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:48.720
 But don't you think... It could be making, recreating lexes. Maybe it'll tie all the

2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:53.200
 universe in lex. Go on. I like this idea and I'm just kidding.

2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:56.080
 That's better. That's more interesting than paperclips.

2:57:56.080 --> 2:57:58.000
 That could be infinitely optimal if I were to say so myself.

2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:02.960
 But if you ask me, it's still a bad thing because it's permanently capping what the

2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:05.760
 universe could ever be. That's its end to it.

2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:10.720
 Or achieving the optimal that the universe could ever achieve. But that's up to different people

2:58:10.720 --> 2:58:16.400
 have different perspectives. But don't you think within the paperclip world that would emerge

2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:22.560
 just like in the zeros and ones that make up a computer that would emerge beautiful complexities?

2:58:23.680 --> 2:58:30.320
 Like it won't suppress. As you scale to multiple planets and throughout,

2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:38.000
 there'll emerge these little worlds that on top of the fabric of maximizing paperclips,

2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:46.560
 there would emerge little societies of paperclips.

2:58:46.560 --> 2:58:51.520
 We're not describing a paperclip maximizer anymore. Because if you think of what a paperclip is,

2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:58.480
 it is literally just a piece of bent iron. So if it's maximizing that throughout the

2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:03.200
 universe, it's taking every atom it gets its hand on into somehow turning it into iron or steel

2:59:04.080 --> 2:59:06.080
 and then bending it into that shape and then done and done.

2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:12.880
 And by definition, like paperclips, there is no way for, well, okay, so you're saying that

2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:17.680
 paperclips somehow will just emerge and create gravity or something?

2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:24.720
 There's a dynamic element to the whole system. It's not just, it's creating those paperclips

2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:30.480
 and the act of creating, there's going to be a process and that process will have a dance to it.

2:59:30.480 --> 2:59:35.200
 Because it's not like sequential thing. There's a whole complex three dimensional system of

2:59:35.200 --> 2:59:40.160
 paperclips, you know, like, you know, people like string theory, right? It's supposed to be strings

2:59:40.160 --> 2:59:44.720
 that are interacting in fascinating ways. I'm sure paperclips are very string like they can be

2:59:44.720 --> 2:59:50.560
 interacting very interesting ways as you scale exponentially through three dimensional. I mean,

2:59:50.560 --> 2:59:56.560
 I'm sure the paperclip maximizer has to come up with a theory of everything. It has to create

2:59:56.560 --> 3:00:02.560
 like wormholes, right? It has to break like, it has to understand quantum mechanics.

3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:08.240
 I love your optimism. This is where I'd say we're going into the realm of pathological optimism,

3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:15.680
 wherever it's. I'm sure there'll be a, I think there's an intelligence that emerges from that

3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:20.800
 system. You're saying that basically intelligence is inherent in the fabric of reality and will

3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:25.600
 find a way kind of like, Goldblum says life will find a way you think life will find a way even

3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:32.320
 out of this perfectly homogenous dead soup. It's not perfectly homogenous. It has to,

3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.400
 it's perfectly maximal in the production. I don't know why people keep thinking it's

3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:41.920
 it maximizes the number of paperclips. That's the only thing. It's not trying to be homogenous.

3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:47.760
 It's trying to try to maximize paperclips. So you're saying, you're saying that because it,

3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:51.520
 because, you know, kind of like in the big bang, or, you know, it seems like, you know,

3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:55.840
 things, there were clusters. There was more stuff here than there. That was enough of the

3:00:55.840 --> 3:00:59.760
 patternicity that kickstarted the evolutionary process. The little weirdnesses that will make

3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:02.400
 it beautiful. Even out of, so yeah. A flood city emerges.

3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:06.800
 Interesting. Okay. Well, so how does that line up then with the whole

3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:10.560
 heat death of the universe, right? Because that's another sort of instantiation of this. It's like

3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:17.040
 everything becomes so far apart and so cold and so perfectly mixed that it's like

3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:23.680
 homogenous, grayness. Do you think that even out of that homogenous grayness where there's no,

3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:30.320
 you know, negative entropy, that, you know, there's no free energy that we understand,

3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:38.720
 even from that new. Yeah. The paperclip maximizer or any other intelligence systems will figure

3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:44.160
 out ways to travel to other universes to create big bangs within those universes or through black

3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:50.320
 holes to create whole other worlds to break the, what we consider the limitations of physics.

3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:58.400
 The paperclip maximizer will find a way if a way exists and we should be humbled to realize that

3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:01.920
 we don't. Yeah, but because it just wants to make more paperclips. So it's going to go into

3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:08.400
 those universes and turn them into paperclips. Yeah. But we humans, not humans, but complex

3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:16.720
 systems exist on top of that. We're not interfering with it. This complexity emerges from the simple

3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:22.000
 base state. The simple base. Yeah. Whether it's, you know, plank lens or paperclips is the base

3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:28.160
 unit. Yeah. You can think of like the universe as a paperclip maximizer because it's doing some

3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:34.080
 dumb stuff. Like physics seems to be pretty dumb. It has like, I don't know if you can summarize it.

3:02:34.080 --> 3:02:39.520
 Yeah. The laws are fairly basic and yet out of them amazing complexity emerges.

3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:45.760
 And its goals seem to be pretty basic and dumb. If you can summarize its goals, I mean, I don't

3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:53.680
 know what's a nice way. Maybe laws of thermodynamics could be good. I don't know if you can assign

3:02:53.680 --> 3:02:58.800
 goals to physics, but if you formulate in the sense of goals, it's very similar to

3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:05.680
 paperclip maximizing in the dumbness of the goals. But the pockets of complexity as it

3:03:05.680 --> 3:03:10.720
 emerges is where beauty emerges. That's where life emerges. That's where intelligence. That's

3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:16.160
 where humans emerge. And I think we're being very down on this whole paperclip maximizer thing.

3:03:16.160 --> 3:03:19.760
 No. The reason we hate it. I think, yeah, because what you're saying is that you

3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:27.280
 think that the force of emergence itself is another like unwritten, well, not unwritten,

3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:34.720
 but like another baked in law of reality. Yeah. And you're trusting that emergence will find a way

3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:41.840
 to even out of seemingly the most moleky, awful, you know, plain outcome emergence will still

3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:47.200
 find a way. I love that as a philosophy. I think it's really nice. I would wield it carefully

3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:51.760
 because there's large error bars on that and the certainty of that.

3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:55.840
 How about we build the paperclip maximizer and find out?

3:03:55.840 --> 3:03:59.040
 Classic. Yeah. Molec is doing cartwheels. Man.

3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:03.120
 Yeah. But the thing is, it will destroy humans in the process, which is the thing,

3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:08.000
 which is the reason we really don't like it. We seem to be really holding on to this whole

3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:13.680
 human civilization thing. Would that make you sad if AI systems that are beautiful,

3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:19.120
 that are conscious, that are interesting and complex and intelligent ultimately lead to the

3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:23.680
 death of humans? Would that make you sad? If humans led to the death of humans, sorry.

3:04:23.680 --> 3:04:26.800
 Like if they would supersede humans. Oh, if some AI.

3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:32.480
 Yeah. AI would end humans. I mean, that's the reason why I'm like,

3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:38.320
 in some ways, less emotionally concerned about AI risk as then say, you know,

3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:44.000
 bio risk. Because at least with AI, there's a chance, you know, if we're in this hypothetical

3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:49.040
 where it wipes out humans, but it does it for some like higher purpose, it needs our atoms

3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:53.520
 to an energy to do something. At least now, there's the universe is going on to do something

3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:58.400
 interesting. Whereas if it wipes everything, you know, bio like just kills everything on

3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:02.800
 Earth. And that's it. And there's no more, you know, Earth cannot spawn anything more

3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:06.480
 meaningful in the in the few hundred million years it has left left, because it doesn't have much

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:16.560
 time left. Then, yeah, I don't know that. So one of my favorite books I've ever read is Novescene

3:05:17.200 --> 3:05:23.280
 by James Lovelock, who sadly just died. He wrote it when he was like 99. He died aged 102. So it's

3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:29.360
 a fairly new book. And he sort of talks about that that he thinks it's, you know, sort of

3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:36.000
 building off this Gaia theory, where like, Earth is like living some form of intelligence itself,

3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:40.960
 and that this is the next like step, right, is this this whatever this new intelligence

3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:47.040
 that is maybe silicon based as opposed to carbon based goes on to do. And it's a really sort of

3:05:47.040 --> 3:05:52.240
 in some ways an optimistic but really fatalistic book. I don't know if I fully subscribe to it,

3:05:52.240 --> 3:05:58.480
 but it's a beautiful piece to read anyway. So am I sad by that idea? I think so, yes. And actually,

3:05:58.480 --> 3:06:03.040
 yeah, this is the reason why I'm sad by the idea, because if something is truly brilliant and wise

3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:09.360
 and smart and truly super intelligent, it should be able to figure out abundance. So

3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:13.920
 if it figures out abundance, it shouldn't need to kill us off. It should be able to find a way for

3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:19.040
 us. It should be there's plenty. The universe is huge. There should be plenty of space for it to go

3:06:19.040 --> 3:06:24.080
 out and do all the things it wants to do and like give us a little pocket where we can continue

3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:28.720
 doing our things and we can continue to do things and so on. And again, if it's so supremely wise,

3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:32.800
 it shouldn't even be worried about the game theoretic considerations that by leaving us alive,

3:06:32.800 --> 3:06:35.920
 we'll then go and create another like super intelligent agent that it then has to compete

3:06:35.920 --> 3:06:39.920
 against, because it should be omnivise and smart enough to not have to concern itself with that.

3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:49.840
 Unless it deems humans to be kind of assholes. The humans are a source of a lose, lose kind of

3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:57.360
 dynamics. Well, yes and no. We're not. Moloch is. That's why I think it's important to say.

3:06:57.360 --> 3:07:03.040
 But maybe humans are the source of Moloch. No. I mean, I think game theory is the source of

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:09.680
 Moloch because Moloch exists in nonhuman systems as well. It happens within agents,

3:07:09.680 --> 3:07:18.800
 within a game, in terms of like, it applies to agents, but it can apply to a species that's on

3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:25.520
 an island of animals. Rats outcompeting the ones that massively consume all the resources of the

3:07:25.520 --> 3:07:30.640
 ones that are going to win out over the more like chill socialized ones and so creates this

3:07:30.640 --> 3:07:35.760
 Malthusian trap. Moloch exists in little pockets in nature as well. So it's not a strictly human

3:07:35.760 --> 3:07:39.760
 thing. I wonder if it's actually a result of consequences of the invention of predator and

3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:48.080
 prey dynamics. Maybe AI will have to kill off every organism that. Now you're talking about

3:07:48.080 --> 3:07:59.920
 killing off competition. Not competition, but just like the way it's like the weeds or whatever

3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:07.600
 in a beautiful flower garden or the parasites on the whole system. Now, of course, it won't do

3:08:07.600 --> 3:08:11.360
 that completely. It'll put them in a zoo like we do with parasites. It'll ring fence. Yeah,

3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:16.560
 and there'll be somebody doing a PhD on like they'll prod humans with a stick and see what they do.

3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:25.040
 But I mean, in terms of letting us run wild outside of the, you know, geographic and

3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:32.480
 straight region that might be that he might have decided to. No, I think there's obviously

3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:39.920
 the capacity for beauty and kindness and non, non Moloch behavior amidst humans. So I'm pretty

3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:47.280
 sure AI will preserve us. Let me, I don't know if you answered the aliens question. You had a

3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:53.120
 good conversation with Toby, Toby or yes, about various sides of the universe. I think, did he

3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:59.920
 say, now I'm forgetting, but I think he said it's a good chance we're alone. So the classic,

3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:09.520
 you know, Fermi paradox question is, there are so many spawn points. And yet, you know, it didn't

3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:16.000
 take us that long to go from harnessing fire to sending out radio signals into space. So surely,

3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:20.640
 given the vastness of space we should be, and you know, even if only a tiny fraction of those

3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:24.720
 create life and other civilizations too, we should be, the universe should be very noisy.

3:09:24.720 --> 3:09:29.200
 There should be evidence of Dyson spheres or whatever, you know, like at least radio signals

3:09:29.200 --> 3:09:33.360
 and so on. But seemingly, things are very silent out there. Now, of course, it depends on who you

3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:37.040
 speak to. Some people say that they're getting signals all the time and so on. And like, I don't

3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:43.520
 want to make an epistemic statement on that. But it seems like there's a lot of silence. And so

3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:52.000
 that raises this paradox. And then say, you know, the Drake equation. So the Drake equation is like

3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:58.160
 basically just a simple thing of like trying to estimate the number of possible civilizations

3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:02.720
 within the galaxy by multiplying the number of stars created per year by the number of stars

3:10:02.720 --> 3:10:05.520
 that have planets, planets that are habitable, blah, blah, blah. So all these like different

3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:10.640
 factors. And then you plug in numbers into that. And you, you know, depending on like the range of,

3:10:10.640 --> 3:10:15.360
 you know, your lower bound and your upper bound point, point estimates that you put in, you get

3:10:15.360 --> 3:10:20.800
 out a number at the end for the number of civilizations. But what Toby and his crew did

3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:28.000
 differently was Toby, this is a researcher at the Future Humanity Institute. They, instead of,

3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:33.760
 they realized that it's like basically a statistical quirk that if you put in point sources,

3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:37.840
 even if you think you're putting in conservative point sources, because on some of these variables,

3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:44.000
 the, the uncertainty is so large, it spans like maybe even like a couple of hundred of orders

3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:50.080
 of magnitude. By putting in point sources, it's always going to lead to overestimates.

3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:56.080
 And so they, by putting stuff on a log scale, or actually they did it on like a log log scale on

3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:02.800
 some of them. And then like ran the simulation across the whole bucket of uncertainty across

3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:07.520
 all of those orders of magnitude. When you do that, then actually the number comes out much,

3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:11.840
 much smaller. And that's the more statistically rigorous, you know, mathematically correct way

3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:16.160
 of doing the calculation. It's still a lot of hand waving. As science goes, it's, it's like

3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:23.840
 definitely, you know, just waving, I don't know what an analogy is, but it's hand wavy. And anyway,

3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:28.240
 when they did this, and then they did a Bayesian update on it as well to like factor in the fact

3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:32.320
 that there is no evidence that we're picking up because, you know, no evidence is actually a form

3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:40.000
 of evidence, right? And the long and short of it comes out that the, we're roughly around 70%

3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:46.560
 to be the only intelligent civilization in our galaxy thus far, and around 50 50 in the entire

3:11:46.560 --> 3:11:52.640
 observable universe, which sounds so crazily counterintuitive, but their math is legit.

3:11:53.280 --> 3:11:57.360
 Well, yeah, the math around this particular equation, which is equations, ridiculous on many

3:11:57.360 --> 3:12:04.080
 levels, but the, the, the night, the powerful thing about the equation is there's the different

3:12:04.080 --> 3:12:12.320
 things, different components that can be estimated and the error bars on which can be reduced with

3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:18.880
 science and enhance throughout since the equation came out, the error bars have been coming out

3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:26.160
 on different aspects. And so that it almost kind of says what like this gives you a mission to reduce

3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:31.600
 the error bars on these estimates now over a period of time. And once you do, you can better

3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:35.680
 and better understand like in the process of redoing the error bars, you'll get to understand

3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:42.880
 actually what is the right way to find out where the aliens are, how many of them there are,

3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:48.000
 and all those kinds of things. So I don't think it's good to use that for an estimation. I think

3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:53.200
 you do have to think from like, more like from first principles, just looking at what life is on

3:12:53.200 --> 3:13:01.920
 earth, like, and trying to understand the very physics based biology, chemistry, biology based

3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:09.440
 question of what is life, maybe computation based, what the fuck is this thing? And that like, how

3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:14.720
 difficult does it to create this thing? It's one way to say like, how many plants like this are

3:13:14.720 --> 3:13:21.120
 out there, all that kind of stuff, but it feels like from our very limited knowledge perspective,

3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:28.480
 the right ways to think how how does what is this thing and how does it originate from,

3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:38.480
 from very simple non life things, how does complex life like things emerge from from a rock

3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:47.120
 to a bacteria protein, and these like weird systems that encode information and pass

3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:51.920
 information from self replicate, and then also select each other and mutate in interesting

3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:56.480
 ways such that they can adapt and evolve and build increasingly more complex systems.

3:13:56.480 --> 3:14:02.160
 Right. Well, it's a form of information processing, right? Right. Whereas information transfer,

3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:08.960
 but then also an energy processing, which then results in I guess information processing,

3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:12.480
 maybe I'm getting bogged down. Well, it's always doing some modification and yeah,

3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:18.640
 the input is some energy. Right. It's able to extract, yeah, extract resources

3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:24.000
 from its environment in order to achieve a goal. But the goal doesn't seem to be clear.

3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:28.560
 Right. The goal is, well, the goal is to make more of itself.

3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:38.960
 Yeah. But in a way that increases, I mean, I don't know if evolution is a fundamental law of the

3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:46.640
 universe, but it seems to want to replicate itself in a way that maximizes the chance of its survival.

3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:53.200
 Individual agents within an ecosystem do. Yes. Yes. Evolution itself doesn't give a fuck.

3:14:53.200 --> 3:14:59.440
 Right. It's a very, don't care. It's just like, oh, you optimize it. Well, at least it's certainly,

3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:06.000
 yeah, it doesn't care about the welfare of the individual agents within it, but it does seem to,

3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:10.000
 I don't know. I think it's, I think the mistake is that we're anthropomorphizing. It's to even try

3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:19.360
 and give evolution a mindset because it is, there's a really great post by Elie as Yidkowsky on

3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:28.400
 Less Wrong, which is an alien god. And he talks about the mistake we make when we try and put

3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:33.520
 on mind, think through things from an evolutionary perspective as though we're giving evolution

3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:39.440
 like some kind of agency and what it wants. Yeah, worth reading, but yeah.

3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:44.640
 I would like to say that having interacted with a lot of really smart people that say that

3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:49.920
 anthropomorphization is a mistake, I would like to say that saying that anthropomorphization is

3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:55.840
 a mistake is a mistake. I think there's a lot of power in anthropomorphization. If I can only say

3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:01.360
 that word correctly one time, I think that's actually a really powerful way to reason through

3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:05.840
 things. I think people, especially people in robotics seem to run away from it as fast as

3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:11.920
 possible. Can you give an example of like how it helps in robotics?

3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:22.960
 Oh, that our world is a world of humans and to see robots as fundamentally just tools

3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:29.920
 runs away from the fact that we live in a world, a dynamic world of humans,

3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:36.160
 that like all these game theory systems we've talked about that a robot that ever has to

3:16:36.160 --> 3:16:41.280
 interact with humans. And I don't mean like intimate friendship interaction. I mean in a

3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:45.440
 factory setting where it has to deal with the uncertainty of humans, all that kind of stuff.

3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:51.200
 You have to acknowledge that the robot's behavior has an effect on the human,

3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:56.000
 just as much as the human has an effect on the robot. And there's a dance there.

3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:02.000
 And you have to realize that this entity, when a human sees a robot, this is obvious in a

3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:07.840
 physical manifestation of a robot, they feel a certain way. They have a fear, they have uncertainty,

3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:13.840
 they have their own personal life projections. If they have pets and dogs and the thing looks

3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:18.560
 like a dog, they have their own memories of what a dog is like, they have certain feelings. And

3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:22.720
 that's going to be useful in a safety setting, safety critical setting, which is one of the

3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:29.040
 most trivial settings for a robot, in terms of how to avoid any kind of dangerous situations.

3:17:29.040 --> 3:17:35.760
 And a robot should really consider that in navigating its environment. And we humans are

3:17:35.760 --> 3:17:41.520
 right to reason about how a robot should consider navigating its environment through

3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:51.840
 anthropomorphization. I also think our brains are designed to think in human terms,

3:17:51.840 --> 3:18:00.880
 like game theory, I think, is best applied in the space of human decisions.

3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:06.960
 And so... Right, you're dealing, I mean, with things like AI, AI is they are,

3:18:08.240 --> 3:18:14.000
 you know, we can somewhat, like, I don't think it's... The reason I say anthropomorphization,

3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:19.360
 we need to be careful with, is because there is a danger of overly applying,

3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:24.720
 overly wrongly assuming that this artificial intelligence is going to operate in any similar

3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:30.480
 way to us. Because it is operating on a fundamentally different substrate, like even

3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:37.040
 dogs or even mice or whatever in some ways, like anthropomorphizing them is less of a mistake,

3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:41.440
 I think, than an AI, even though it's an AI we built and so on. Because at least we know that

3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:46.080
 they're running from the same substrate. And they've also evolved from the same out of the same

3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:52.320
 evolutionary process. They've followed this evolution of needing to compete for resources

3:18:52.320 --> 3:18:57.200
 and needing to find a mate and that kind of stuff. Whereas an AI that has just popped into

3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:02.640
 an existence somewhere on a cloud server, let's say, or whatever, however it runs,

3:19:02.640 --> 3:19:05.360
 and whatever... I don't know whether they have an internal experience,

3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:09.200
 I don't think they necessarily do. In fact, I don't think they do. But the point is,

3:19:09.200 --> 3:19:15.280
 is that to try and apply any kind of modeling of thinking through problems and decisions in

3:19:15.280 --> 3:19:22.720
 the same way that we do has to be done extremely carefully because they're so alien,

3:19:23.440 --> 3:19:27.600
 their method of whatever their form of thinking is. It's just so different because they've never

3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:34.000
 had to evolve in the same way. Yeah, beautifully put. I was just playing devil's advocate. I do

3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:38.960
 think in certain contexts, anthropomorphization is not going to hurt you. Yes. Engineers run away

3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:46.320
 from it too fast. I can see that. From the most point you're right. Do you have advice for young

3:19:46.320 --> 3:19:55.280
 people today, like the 17 year old that you were, of how to live life you can be proud of,

3:19:55.280 --> 3:19:59.360
 how to have a career you can be proud of in this world full of mullocks?

3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:09.120
 Think about the windwinds. Look for windwind situations and be careful not to overly use

3:20:09.120 --> 3:20:13.440
 your smarts to convince yourself that something is windwind when it's not. That's difficult. I don't

3:20:13.440 --> 3:20:18.800
 know how to advise people on that because it's something I'm still figuring out myself. But

3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:27.440
 have that as a default MO. Don't see everything as a zero sum game. Try to find the positive

3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:34.160
 sumness and find ways to, if there doesn't seem to be one, consider playing a different game.

3:20:34.160 --> 3:20:40.560
 So I would suggest that. Do not become a professional poker player. Because people always

3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:45.440
 ask, they're like, oh, she's a pro. I want to do that too. Fine. You could have done it when I

3:20:45.440 --> 3:20:52.720
 started out. It was a very different situation back then. Poker is a great game to learn in order

3:20:52.720 --> 3:20:57.760
 to understand the ways to think. I recommend people learn it, but don't try and make a living from

3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:06.400
 it these days. It's very, very difficult to the point of being impossible. Then really,

3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:12.960
 really be aware of how much time you spend on your phone and on social media and really try

3:21:12.960 --> 3:21:18.000
 and keep it to a minimum. Be aware that basically every moment that you spend on it is bad for you.

3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:22.160
 So it doesn't mean to say you can never do it, but just have that running in the background.

3:21:22.160 --> 3:21:26.400
 I'm doing a bad thing for myself right now. I think that's the general rule of thumb.

3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:32.400
 Of course, about becoming a professional poker player, if there is a thing in your life

3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:38.400
 that's like that and nobody can convince you otherwise, just fucking do it.

3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:47.200
 Don't listen to anyone's advice. Find a thing that you can't be talked out of too. That's a thing.

3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:55.840
 I like that. You were a lead guitarist in the metal band. Did I write that down from something?

3:21:57.120 --> 3:22:08.800
 What did you do it for? The performing, was it the music of it? Was it just being a rock star?

3:22:08.800 --> 3:22:19.200
 Why did you do it? We only ever played two gigs. It wasn't very famous or anything like that,

3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:29.040
 but I was very into metal. It was my entire identity from the age of 16 to 23.

3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:33.600
 What's the best metal band of all time? Don't ask me that. It's so hard to answer.

3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:43.200
 I had a long argument with, I'm a guitarist, more like a classic rock guitarist.

3:22:44.640 --> 3:22:50.000
 I've had friends who are very big Pantera fans. There was often arguments about

3:22:51.040 --> 3:22:56.240
 what's the better metal band Metallica versus Pantera. This is a more 90s maybe discussion,

3:22:57.120 --> 3:23:03.200
 but I was always on the side of Metallica both musically and in terms of performance and the

3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:11.520
 depth of lyrics and so on. Basically, everybody was against me because if you're a true metal fan,

3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:18.080
 I guess the idea goes is you can't possibly be a Metallica fan. Metallica is pop. It's like

3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:27.040
 they sold out. Metallica are metal. You can't say who was the godfather of metal, but they

3:23:27.040 --> 3:23:34.880
 were so groundbreaking and so brilliant. You've named literally two of my favorite bands.

3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:38.880
 When you ask that question, or who are my favorites, those were two that came up.

3:23:38.880 --> 3:23:44.720
 A third one is Children of Bodom, who I just think, they just tick all the boxes for me.

3:23:47.280 --> 3:23:55.600
 Yeah, I don't know. Nowadays, I feel like a repulsion to the... I was that myself,

3:23:55.600 --> 3:23:58.800
 like I'd be like, who do you prefer more? Come on. You have to rank them,

3:23:58.800 --> 3:24:04.080
 but it's like this false zero somnus that's like, why? They're so additive. There's no conflict there.

3:24:05.280 --> 3:24:10.560
 When people ask that kind of question about anything, movies, I feel like it's hard work

3:24:11.360 --> 3:24:18.240
 and it's unfair, but you should pick one. That's actually the same kind of... It's like a fear

3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:24.240
 of a commitment. When people ask me what's your favorite band, it's like... It's good to pick.

3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:26.720
 Exactly. And thank you for the tough question. Yeah.

3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:30.880
 Well, maybe not in a context when a lot of people are listening.

3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:34.640
 Yeah, I was just like, what? Why does this matter? No, it does...

3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:36.400
 Are you still into metal?

3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:39.520
 Funny enough, I was listening to a bunch before I came over here.

3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:44.480
 Oh, like, do you use it for motivation or get you into certain...

3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:47.360
 Yeah, I was weirdly listening to 80s hair metal before I came.

3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:49.120
 Does that count as metal?

3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:55.440
 I think so. It's like proto metal and it's happy. It's optimistic, happy, proto metal.

3:24:56.560 --> 3:24:59.040
 Yeah, I mean, these things, all these genres bleed into each other.

3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:04.320
 But yeah, sorry to answer your question about guitar playing. My relationship with it was

3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:11.120
 kind of weird in that I was deeply uncreative. My objective would be to hear some really hard

3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:16.320
 technical solo and then learn it, memorize it, and then play it perfectly. But I was

3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:21.280
 incapable of trying to write my own music. The idea was just absolutely terrifying.

3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:26.320
 But I was also just thinking, I was like, it'd be kind of cool to actually try

3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:33.200
 starting a band again and getting back into it and write. But it's scary.

3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:38.000
 It's scary. I mean, I put out some guitar playing, just other people's covers,

3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:43.840
 like I play comfortably numb on the internet. It's scary too. It's scary putting stuff out there.

3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:49.760
 And I had this similar kind of fascination with technical playing both on piano and guitar.

3:25:55.680 --> 3:26:00.960
 One of the reasons I started learning guitar is from Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Crowley's solo.

3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:07.840
 And one of the first solos I learned is that there's a beauty to it. There's a

3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:15.600
 lot of beauty to it. There's some tapping, but it's just really fast. Beautiful, like arpeggios.

3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:20.720
 Yeah, arpeggios. Yeah. And there's a melody that you can hear through it, but there's also a build

3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:25.200
 up. It's a beautiful solo, but it's also technically just visually the way it looks

3:26:25.840 --> 3:26:31.280
 when a person's watching you feel like a rock star playing. But it ultimately has to do with

3:26:31.280 --> 3:26:39.520
 technical... You're not developing the part of your brain that I think requires you to generate

3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:43.920
 beautiful music. It is ultimately technical in nature. And so that took me a long time to

3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:52.000
 let go of that and just be able to write music myself. And that's a different journey, I think.

3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:56.960
 I think of that journey as a little bit more inspired in the blues world, for example,

3:26:56.960 --> 3:27:02.960
 or improvisation is more valued, obviously in jazz and so on. But I think ultimately it's a more

3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:10.880
 rewarding journey because your relationship with the guitar then becomes a kind of escape

3:27:11.440 --> 3:27:15.600
 from the world where you can create. I mean, creating stuff is...

3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:20.480
 And it's something you work with because my relationship with my guitar was like it was

3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:26.160
 something to tame and defeat. Yeah, the challenge. Which was kind of what my whole personality

3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:30.480
 was back then. I was just very... As I said, very competitive, very just must

3:27:31.360 --> 3:27:37.840
 bend this thing to my will. Whereas writing music, it's like a dance. You work with it.

3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:42.400
 But I think because of the competitive aspect, for me at least, that's still there,

3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:47.840
 which creates anxiety about playing publicly or all that kind of stuff. I think there's just

3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:53.040
 like a harsh self criticism within the whole thing. It's really tough.

3:27:53.040 --> 3:27:58.240
 I want to hear some of your stuff. I mean, there's certain things that

3:27:58.240 --> 3:28:03.760
 feel really personal. And on top of that, as we talked about poker offline, there's certain

3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:07.040
 things that you get to a certain height in your life. And that doesn't have to be very high,

3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:13.040
 but you get to a certain height and then you put it aside for a bit. And it's hard to return to

3:28:13.040 --> 3:28:20.160
 it because you remember being good. And it's hard to... You being at a very high level in poker,

3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:24.960
 it might be hard for you to return to poker every once in a while and you enjoy it knowing that

3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:28.480
 you're just not as sharp as it used to be because you're not doing it every single day.

3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:33.680
 That's something I always wonder with... I mean, even just like in chess with Kasparov,

3:28:33.680 --> 3:28:37.040
 some of these greats, just returning to it, it's almost painful.

3:28:37.040 --> 3:28:38.240
 Yes, I can... Yeah.

3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:45.520
 And I feel that way with guitar too, because I used to play every day a lot. So returning to it is

3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:55.040
 painful because it's like accepting the fact that this whole ride is finite and you have a prime...

3:28:55.840 --> 3:28:58.640
 There's a time when you're really good and now it's over and now...

3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:00.160
 We're on a different chapter of life.

3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:02.800
 Yeah, it's like... But I miss that, yeah.

3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:08.560
 But you can still discover joy within that process. It's been tough, especially with some level of

3:29:08.560 --> 3:29:18.480
 like, as people get to know you and people film stuff, you don't have the privacy of just sharing

3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:20.800
 something with a few people around you. Yeah.

3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:24.000
 That's a beautiful privacy. That's a good point.

3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:26.000
 With the internet, it's just disappearing.

3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:27.760
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:34.160
 Yeah. But all those pressures aside, if you really... You can step up and still enjoy the

3:29:34.160 --> 3:29:41.040
 fuck out of a good musical performance. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:29:42.160 --> 3:29:43.200
 What's the meaning of life?

3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:52.160
 It's in your name, as we talked about. Do you feel the requirement to have to live up to your name?

3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:55.200
 Because live?

3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:56.000
 Yeah.

3:29:56.000 --> 3:30:00.320
 No, because I don't see it. I mean, again, it's kind of like...

3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:05.200
 I don't know. Because my full name is Olivia.

3:30:05.200 --> 3:30:05.760
 Yeah.

3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:08.480
 So I can retreat in that and be like, oh, Olivia, what does that even mean?

3:30:09.920 --> 3:30:15.040
 Live up to live. No, I can't say I do because I've never thought of it that way.

3:30:15.040 --> 3:30:18.320
 Okay. And then your name backwards is evil, as we also talked about.

3:30:20.720 --> 3:30:22.160
 There's like layers of people there.

3:30:22.160 --> 3:30:26.240
 I mean, I feel the urge to live up to that, to be the inverse of evil.

3:30:26.240 --> 3:30:29.360
 Yeah. Or even better. Because I don't think...

3:30:30.480 --> 3:30:34.800
 Is the inverse of evil good or is good something completely separate to that?

3:30:34.800 --> 3:30:38.800
 I think... My intuition says it's the latter, but I don't know. Anyway, again, getting in the weeds.

3:30:39.840 --> 3:30:41.280
 What is the meaning of all this?

3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:42.560
 Of life.

3:30:44.160 --> 3:30:44.880
 Why are we here?

3:30:46.720 --> 3:30:55.360
 I think to explore, have fun and understand and make more of here and to keep the game going.

3:30:55.360 --> 3:30:57.120
 Of here? More of here?

3:30:57.120 --> 3:31:00.000
 More of this? Whatever this is?

3:31:00.000 --> 3:31:05.200
 More of experience. Just to have more of experience and ideally the positive experience.

3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:12.720
 And more... I guess try and put it into a sort of vaguely scientific term.

3:31:15.600 --> 3:31:21.280
 Make it so that the program required, the length of code required to describe the universe

3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:26.000
 is as long as possible. And highly complex and therefore interesting.

3:31:27.040 --> 3:31:38.480
 Because again, I know we bang the metaphor to death, but tiled with paperclips doesn't require

3:31:38.480 --> 3:31:43.840
 that much of a code to describe. Obviously, maybe something emerges from it. But that steady state,

3:31:43.840 --> 3:31:49.520
 assuming a steady state, it's not very interesting. Whereas it seems like our universe is over time

3:31:49.520 --> 3:31:53.840
 becoming more and more complex and interesting. There's so much richness and beauty and diversity

3:31:53.840 --> 3:31:59.440
 on this earth. And I want that to continue and get more. I want more diversity. And in the very

3:31:59.440 --> 3:32:06.160
 best sense of that word is, to me, the goal of all this.

3:32:07.040 --> 3:32:10.560
 Yeah. And somehow have fun in the process.

3:32:11.920 --> 3:32:18.800
 Because we do create a lot of fun things in this creative force and all the beautiful things

3:32:18.800 --> 3:32:24.480
 we create. Somehow there's like a funness to it. And perhaps that has to do with the finiteness

3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:29.920
 of life, the finiteness of all these experiences, which is what makes them kind of unique.

3:32:31.200 --> 3:32:36.800
 Like the fact that they end, there's this, whatever it is, falling in love or

3:32:38.800 --> 3:32:46.240
 creating a piece of art or creating a bridge or creating a rocket or creating a,

3:32:46.240 --> 3:32:57.200
 I don't know, just the businesses that build something or solve something. The fact that it

3:32:57.200 --> 3:33:08.640
 is born and it dies somehow embeds it with fun, with joy for the people involved. I don't know

3:33:08.640 --> 3:33:13.040
 what that is, the finiteness of it. It can do. Some people struggle with the,

3:33:13.040 --> 3:33:19.760
 you know, I mean, a big thing I think that one has to learn is being okay with things coming

3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:26.960
 to an end. And in terms of like projects and so on, right, people cling on to things beyond

3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:30.080
 what they're meant to be doing, you know, beyond what is reasonable.

3:33:31.840 --> 3:33:35.680
 And I'm going to have to come to terms with this podcast coming to an end.

3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:40.080
 I really enjoy talking to you. I think it's obvious, as we've talked about many times,

3:33:40.080 --> 3:33:45.840
 you should be doing a podcast. You should, you're already doing a lot of stuff publicly

3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:49.040
 to the world, which is awesome. And you're a great educator, you're a great mind,

3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:53.600
 you're great intellect. But it's also this whole medium of just talking is also fun.

3:33:53.600 --> 3:33:59.680
 It's a fun one. It really is good. And it's just, it's nothing but like, it's just so much fun.

3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:06.480
 And you can just get into so many, yeah, there's this space to just explore and see what comes

3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:10.320
 and emerges. And yeah, to understand yourself better. And if you're talking to others to

3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:14.800
 understand them better and together with them, I mean, you should do your, you should do your own

3:34:14.800 --> 3:34:19.520
 podcast, but you should also do a podcast with C as we talked about. The two of you have such

3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:27.120
 different minds that like melt together in just hilarious ways, fascinating ways, just

3:34:27.840 --> 3:34:32.800
 the tension of ideas there is really powerful. But in general, I think you got a beautiful

3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:37.200
 voice. So thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for

3:34:37.200 --> 3:34:41.200
 honoring me with this conversation and with your valuable time. Thanks, Liv. Thank you.

3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:46.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Liv Barry. To support this podcast,

3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:50.880
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:57.200
 Richard Feynman. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers,

3:34:57.200 --> 3:35:02.960
 which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of

3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:09.040
 uncertainty about different things. But I'm not absolutely sure of anything. And there are many

3:35:09.040 --> 3:35:14.480
 things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here.

3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:21.600
 I don't have to know the answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things by being lost in

3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:27.200
 a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell.

3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:51.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
