00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
 The following is a conversation with Jeff Shaneline,

00:03.080 --> 00:05.680
 a scientist at NIST interested in

00:05.680 --> 00:08.440
 optoelectronic intelligence.

00:08.440 --> 00:12.160
 We have a deep technical dive into computing hardware

00:12.160 --> 00:14.120
 that will make Jim Keller proud.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.440
 I urge you to hop on to this roller coaster ride

00:17.440 --> 00:19.320
 through neuromorphic computing

00:19.320 --> 00:21.720
 and superconducting electronics

00:21.720 --> 00:24.360
 and hold on for dear life.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.200
 Jeff is a great communicator of technical information

00:27.200 --> 00:30.160
 and so it was truly a pleasure to talk to him

00:30.160 --> 00:32.280
 about some physics and engineering.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.440
 To support this podcast,

00:34.440 --> 00:37.440
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

00:39.880 --> 00:43.360
 and here is my conversation with Jeff Shaneline.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.920
 I got a chance to read a fascinating paper you authored

00:48.920 --> 00:52.040
 called Optoelectronic Intelligence.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.200
 So maybe we can start by talking about this paper

00:55.200 --> 00:57.080
 and start with the basic questions,

00:57.080 --> 01:00.360
 what is optoelectronic intelligence?

01:00.360 --> 01:02.040
 Yeah, so in that paper,

01:02.040 --> 01:04.280
 the concept I was trying to describe

01:04.280 --> 01:08.400
 is sort of an architecture for building

01:08.400 --> 01:10.800
 brain inspired computing

01:10.800 --> 01:13.400
 that leverages light for communication

01:13.400 --> 01:17.640
 in conjunction with electronic circuits for computation.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.920
 In that particular paper,

01:18.920 --> 01:20.880
 a lot of the work we're doing right now

01:20.880 --> 01:23.160
 in our project at NIST is focused

01:23.160 --> 01:25.840
 on superconducting electronics for computation.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.760
 I won't go into why that is,

01:27.760 --> 01:31.440
 but that might make a little more sense in context

01:31.440 --> 01:35.440
 if we first describe what that is in contrast to,

01:35.440 --> 01:37.920
 which is semiconducting electronics.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.760
 So is it worth taking a couple minutes

01:39.760 --> 01:42.840
 to describe semiconducting electronics?

01:42.840 --> 01:46.000
 It might even be worthwhile to step back

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
 and talk about electricity and circuits

01:50.000 --> 01:52.280
 and how circuits work

01:52.280 --> 01:54.800
 before we talk about superconductivity.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.520
 Right, okay.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.080
 How does the computer work, Jeff?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.800
 Well, I won't go into everything

01:59.800 --> 02:01.120
 that makes a computer work,

02:01.120 --> 02:05.200
 but let's talk about the basic building blocks,

02:05.200 --> 02:08.040
 a transistor and even more basic

02:08.040 --> 02:11.520
 than that a semiconductor material, silicon say.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.440
 So in silicon, silicon is a semiconductor

02:15.440 --> 02:18.440
 and what that means is at low temperature,

02:18.440 --> 02:20.760
 there are no free charges,

02:20.760 --> 02:22.880
 no free electrons that can move around.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.960
 So when you talk about electricity,

02:24.960 --> 02:28.080
 you're talking about predominantly electrons

02:28.080 --> 02:30.800
 moving to establish electrical currents

02:30.800 --> 02:33.120
 and they move under the influence of voltages.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.680
 So you apply voltages, electrons move around,

02:36.680 --> 02:38.440
 those can be measured as currents

02:38.440 --> 02:40.960
 and you can represent information in that way.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.880
 So semiconductors are special

02:43.880 --> 02:46.880
 in the sense that they are really malleable.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.120
 So if you have a semiconductor material,

02:50.120 --> 02:52.640
 you can change the number of free electrons

02:52.640 --> 02:56.040
 that can move around by putting different elements,

02:56.040 --> 02:58.320
 different atoms in lattice sites.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.240
 So what is a lattice site?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.240
 Well, a semiconductor is a crystal,

03:02.240 --> 03:06.520
 which means all the atoms that comprise the material

03:06.520 --> 03:09.040
 are at exact locations

03:09.040 --> 03:10.880
 that are perfectly periodic in space.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.240
 So if you start at any one atom

03:12.240 --> 03:14.680
 and you go along what are called the lattice vectors,

03:14.680 --> 03:17.360
 you get to another atom and another atom and another atom

03:17.360 --> 03:19.480
 and for high quality devices,

03:19.480 --> 03:21.960
 it's important that that is a perfect crystal

03:21.960 --> 03:23.880
 with very few defects,

03:23.880 --> 03:27.480
 but you can intentionally replace a silicon atom

03:27.480 --> 03:29.280
 with say a phosphorus atom

03:29.280 --> 03:32.200
 and then you can change the number of free electrons

03:32.200 --> 03:34.040
 that are in a region of space

03:34.040 --> 03:37.200
 that has that excess of what are called dopants.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.320
 So picture a device that has a left terminal

03:40.320 --> 03:42.080
 and a right terminal.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.200
 And if you apply a voltage between those two,

03:44.200 --> 03:47.800
 you can cause electrical current to flow between them.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.160
 Now we add a third terminal up on top there

03:52.160 --> 03:53.840
 and depending on the voltage

03:53.840 --> 03:55.600
 between the left and right terminal

03:55.600 --> 03:58.760
 and that third voltage, you can change that current.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.320
 So what's commonly done in digital electronic circuits

04:02.320 --> 04:06.600
 is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right

04:06.600 --> 04:09.120
 and then change that voltage that's applied

04:09.120 --> 04:11.240
 at what's called the gate, the gate of the transistor.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.680
 So what you do is you make it to where there's an excess

04:14.680 --> 04:15.720
 of electrons on the left,

04:15.720 --> 04:17.400
 excess of electrons on the right

04:17.400 --> 04:18.920
 and very few electrons in the middle.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.560
 And you do this by changing the concentration

04:21.560 --> 04:24.840
 of different dopants in the lattice spatially.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.920
 And then when you apply a voltage to that gate,

04:27.920 --> 04:30.720
 you can either cause current to flow or turn it off.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.480
 And so that's sort of your zero and one.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.400
 If you apply voltage, current can flow.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.400
 That current is representing a digital one.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.000
 And from that, from that basic element,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.240
 you can build up all the complexity

04:44.240 --> 04:48.040
 of digital electronic circuits that have really

04:48.040 --> 04:50.120
 had a profound influence on our society.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.640
 Now you're talking about electrons.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.680
 Can you give a sense of what scale we're talking about

04:54.680 --> 04:56.680
 when we're talking about in silicon,

04:57.640 --> 05:01.600
 being able to mass manufacture these kinds of gates?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.520
 Yeah, so scale in a number of different senses.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.560
 Well, at the scale of the silicon lattice,

05:07.560 --> 05:10.920
 the distance between two atoms there is half a nanometer.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.520
 So people often like to compare these things

05:14.520 --> 05:16.560
 to the width of a human hair.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.080
 I think it's some six orders of magnitude smaller

05:20.080 --> 05:24.480
 than the width of a human hair, something on that order.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.880
 So remarkably small.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.320
 We're talking about individual atoms here.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.520
 And electrons are of that length scale

05:29.520 --> 05:31.560
 when they're in that environment.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.440
 But there's another sense that scale matters

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
 in digital electronics.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.480
 This is perhaps the more important sense,

05:36.480 --> 05:37.920
 although they're related.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.360
 Scale refers to a number of things.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.600
 It refers to the size of that transistor.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.320
 So for example, I said you have a left contact,

05:47.320 --> 05:49.840
 a right contact, and some space between them

05:49.840 --> 05:52.280
 where the gate electrode sits.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.040
 That's called the channel width or the channel length.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.160
 And what has enabled what we think of as Moore's Law

06:00.160 --> 06:03.080
 or the continued increased performance

06:03.080 --> 06:05.600
 in silicon microelectronic circuits

06:05.600 --> 06:09.000
 is the ability to make that size, that feature size,

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
 ever smaller, ever smaller at a really remarkable pace.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.840
 I mean, that feature size has decreased consistently

06:20.200 --> 06:23.800
 every couple of years since the 1960s.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.200
 And that was what Moore predicted in the 1960s.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.520
 He thought it would continue for at least two more decades

06:29.520 --> 06:30.840
 and it's been much longer than that.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.280
 And so that is why we've been able

06:34.280 --> 06:37.080
 to fit ever more devices, ever more transistors,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.200
 ever more computational power

06:39.200 --> 06:41.680
 on essentially the same size of chip.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.640
 So a user sits back and does essentially nothing.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.200
 You're running the same computer program,

06:46.200 --> 06:47.720
 but those devices are getting smaller

06:47.720 --> 06:50.320
 so they get faster, they get more energy efficient,

06:50.320 --> 06:51.760
 and all of our computing performance

06:51.760 --> 06:53.480
 just continues to improve.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.440
 And we don't have to think too hard

06:56.440 --> 07:00.360
 about what we're doing as, say, a software designer,

07:00.360 --> 07:01.200
 something like that.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.400
 I absolutely don't mean to say

07:02.400 --> 07:05.480
 that there's no innovation in software,

07:05.480 --> 07:07.200
 the user side of things, of course there is,

07:07.200 --> 07:09.560
 but from the hardware perspective,

07:09.560 --> 07:12.400
 we just have been given this gift

07:12.400 --> 07:16.120
 of continued performance improvement through this scaling

07:16.120 --> 07:19.240
 that is ever smaller feature sizes

07:19.240 --> 07:22.840
 with very similar, say, power consumption.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.040
 That power consumption has not continued to scale

07:26.040 --> 07:29.520
 in the most recent decades, but nevertheless,

07:29.520 --> 07:31.360
 we had a really good run there for a while.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.320
 And now we're down to gates that are seven nanometers,

07:34.320 --> 07:36.240
 which is state of the art right now.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.920
 Maybe global foundries is trying to push it

07:38.920 --> 07:39.760
 even lower than that.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.560
 I can't keep up with where the predictions are

07:42.560 --> 07:47.600
 that it's gonna end, but seven nanometer transistor

07:47.600 --> 07:50.080
 has just a few tens of atoms

07:50.080 --> 07:51.880
 along the length of the conduction pathway.

07:51.880 --> 07:56.760
 So a naive semiconductor device physicist

07:56.760 --> 07:58.720
 would think you can't go much further than that

07:58.720 --> 08:01.720
 without some kind of revolution in the way

08:01.720 --> 08:04.000
 we think about the physics of our devices.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.120
 Is there something to be said

08:05.120 --> 08:08.320
 about the mass manufacture of these devices?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.520
 Right, right, so that's another thing.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.080
 So how have we been able to make those transistors

08:13.080 --> 08:14.040
 smaller and smaller?

08:14.040 --> 08:17.920
 Well, companies like Intel, Global Foundries,

08:17.920 --> 08:20.480
 they invest a lot of money in the lithography.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.000
 So how are these chips actually made?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.920
 Well, one of the most important steps is this,

08:25.920 --> 08:27.840
 what's called ion implantation.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.120
 So you start with sort of a pristine silicon crystal

08:32.120 --> 08:34.240
 and then using photolithography,

08:34.240 --> 08:37.560
 which is a technique where you can pattern different shapes

08:37.560 --> 08:41.560
 using light, you can define which regions of space

08:41.560 --> 08:45.760
 you're going to implant with different species of ions

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
 that are going to change

08:46.760 --> 08:49.680
 the local electrical properties right there.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.840
 So by using ever shorter wavelengths of light

08:52.840 --> 08:54.520
 and different kinds of optical techniques

08:54.520 --> 08:56.760
 and different kinds of lithographic techniques,

08:56.760 --> 09:01.200
 things that go far beyond my knowledge base,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.560
 you can just simply shrink that feature size down.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.920
 And you say you're at seven nanometers.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.480
 Well, the wavelength of light that's being used

09:07.480 --> 09:08.840
 is over a hundred nanometers.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.320
 That's already deep in the UV.

09:10.320 --> 09:14.800
 So how are those minute features patterned?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.000
 Well, there's an extraordinary amount of innovation

09:17.000 --> 09:18.280
 that has gone into that.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.360
 But nevertheless, it stayed very consistent

09:20.360 --> 09:22.000
 in this ever shrinking feature size.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.840
 And now the question is, can you make it smaller?

09:24.840 --> 09:27.040
 And even if you do, do you still continue

09:27.040 --> 09:28.400
 to get performance improvements?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.280
 But that's another kind of scaling

09:30.280 --> 09:34.360
 where these companies have been able to...

09:34.360 --> 09:37.120
 So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.840
 Well, that chip is not made as a chip.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.960
 It's made on a wafer.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.440
 And using photolithography,

09:43.440 --> 09:47.280
 you basically print the same pattern on different dyes

09:47.280 --> 09:48.400
 all across the wafer.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.400
 Multiple layers tends probably 100 some layers

09:53.400 --> 09:55.280
 in a mature foundry process.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.640
 And you do this on ever bigger wafers too.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.080
 That's another aspect of scaling

09:59.080 --> 10:00.960
 that's occurred in the last several decades.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.040
 So now you have this 300 millimeter wafer.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.360
 It's like as big as a pizza

10:04.360 --> 10:06.640
 and it has maybe a thousand processors on it.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.960
 And then you dice that up using a saw.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.840
 And now you can sell these things so cheap

10:11.840 --> 10:15.240
 because the manufacturing process was so streamlined.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.480
 I think a technology as revolutionary

10:17.480 --> 10:20.160
 as silicon microelectronics has to have

10:20.160 --> 10:23.800
 that kind of manufacturing scalability,

10:23.800 --> 10:25.720
 which I will just emphasize.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.200
 I believe is enabled by physics.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.760
 It's not, I mean, of course there's human ingenuity

10:31.760 --> 10:32.600
 that goes into it.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.120
 But at least from my side where I sit,

10:36.120 --> 10:39.040
 it sure looks like the physics of our universe

10:39.040 --> 10:41.160
 allows us to produce that.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.960
 And we've discovered how more so than we've invented it.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.440
 Although of course we have invented it,

10:47.440 --> 10:48.720
 humans have invented it.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.240
 But it's almost as if it was there

10:51.240 --> 10:53.240
 waiting for us to discover it.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.440
 You mean the entirety of it?

10:54.440 --> 10:56.160
 Or are you specifically talking about

10:56.160 --> 10:58.600
 the techniques of photolithography

10:58.600 --> 10:59.960
 like the optics involved?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.840
 I mean, the entirety of the scaling down

11:02.840 --> 11:07.440
 to the seven nanometers that you're able to have electrons

11:07.440 --> 11:09.000
 not interfere with each other in such a way

11:09.000 --> 11:11.560
 that you could still have gates.

11:11.560 --> 11:16.560
 Like that's enabled to achieve that scale spatial and temporal.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.760
 It seems to be very special

11:18.760 --> 11:21.520
 and is enabled by the physics of our world.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.800
 All of the things you just said.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.000
 So starting with the silicon material itself,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.800
 silicon is a unique semiconductor.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.600
 It has essentially ideal properties

11:31.600 --> 11:33.720
 for making a specific kind of transistor

11:33.720 --> 11:35.240
 that's extraordinarily useful.

11:35.240 --> 11:39.600
 So I mentioned that silicon has,

11:39.600 --> 11:40.680
 well, when you make a transistor,

11:40.680 --> 11:42.040
 you have this gate contact

11:42.040 --> 11:44.560
 that sits on top of the conduction channel.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.280
 And depending on the voltage you apply there,

11:47.280 --> 11:50.040
 you pull more carriers into the conduction channel

11:50.040 --> 11:53.080
 or push them away so it becomes more or less conductive.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.720
 In order to have that work

11:54.720 --> 11:57.160
 without just sucking those carriers right into that contact,

11:57.160 --> 11:59.160
 you need a very thin insulator.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.240
 And part of scaling has been to gradually decrease

12:03.240 --> 12:06.080
 the thickness of that gate insulator

12:06.080 --> 12:09.080
 so they can use a roughly similar voltage

12:09.080 --> 12:12.120
 and still have the same current voltage characteristics.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.640
 So the material that's used to do that

12:14.640 --> 12:16.920
 or I should say was initially used to do that

12:16.920 --> 12:18.760
 was a silicon dioxide,

12:18.760 --> 12:21.840
 which just naturally grows on the silicon surface.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.120
 So you expose silicon to the atmosphere that we breathe

12:25.120 --> 12:27.600
 and well, if you're manufacturing,

12:27.600 --> 12:29.760
 you're gonna purify these gases,

12:29.760 --> 12:32.520
 but nevertheless that what's called a native oxide

12:32.520 --> 12:33.560
 will grow there.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.080
 There are essentially no other materials

12:36.080 --> 12:37.520
 on the entire periodic table

12:37.520 --> 12:42.320
 that have as good of a gate insulator

12:42.320 --> 12:43.680
 as that silicon dioxide.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.280
 And that has to do with nothing but the physics

12:46.280 --> 12:49.240
 of the interaction between silicon and oxygen.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.000
 And if it wasn't that way, transistors could not,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.280
 they could not perform in nearly the degree

12:57.280 --> 12:58.800
 of capability that they have.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.880
 And that has to do with the way that the oxide grows,

13:02.880 --> 13:05.760
 the reduced density of defects there,

13:05.760 --> 13:08.600
 it's insulation, meaning essentially it's energy gaps.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.360
 You can apply a very large voltage there

13:10.360 --> 13:12.280
 without having current leak through it.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.520
 So that's physics right there.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.880
 There are other things too.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.840
 Silicon is a semiconductor in an elemental sense.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.560
 You only need silicon atoms,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.480
 a lot of other semiconductors you need

13:23.480 --> 13:24.880
 to different kinds of atoms

13:24.880 --> 13:26.800
 like a compound from group three

13:26.800 --> 13:28.600
 and a compound from group five.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.680
 That opens you up to lots of defects that can occur

13:31.680 --> 13:34.640
 where one atom's not sitting quite at the lattice site it is

13:34.640 --> 13:38.320
 and it switched with another one that degrades performance.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.320
 But then also on the side that you mentioned

13:40.320 --> 13:42.080
 with the manufacturing,

13:43.480 --> 13:45.840
 we have access to light sources

13:45.840 --> 13:48.600
 that can produce these very short wavelengths of light.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.920
 How does photolithography occur?

13:50.920 --> 13:54.480
 Well, you actually put this polymer on top of your wafer

13:54.480 --> 13:56.240
 and you expose it to light

13:56.240 --> 14:00.120
 and then you use a aqueous chemical processing

14:00.120 --> 14:03.520
 to dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light

14:03.520 --> 14:06.000
 and leave the regions that were not.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.600
 And we are blessed with these polymers

14:08.600 --> 14:09.720
 that have the right property

14:09.720 --> 14:13.640
 where they can cause decision events

14:13.640 --> 14:16.240
 where the polymer splits where a photon hits.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.800
 I mean, maybe that's not too surprising,

14:19.800 --> 14:20.640
 but I don't know.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.280
 It all comes together to have this really complex

14:24.280 --> 14:26.200
 manufacturable ecosystem

14:26.200 --> 14:30.640
 where very sophisticated technologies can be devised

14:30.640 --> 14:33.080
 and it works quite well.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.440
 And amazingly, like you said,

14:34.440 --> 14:36.280
 with a wavelength at like a hundred nanometers

14:36.280 --> 14:37.120
 or something like that,

14:37.120 --> 14:39.760
 you're still able to achieve on this polymer

14:39.760 --> 14:43.520
 precision of whatever we said, seven nanometers.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.760
 I think I've heard like four nanometers

14:45.760 --> 14:48.440
 being talked about something like that.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.880
 If we could just pause on this

14:49.880 --> 14:52.160
 and we'll return to superconductivity,

14:52.160 --> 14:56.440
 but in this whole journey from a history perspective,

14:56.440 --> 14:58.440
 what do you think is the most beautiful

14:59.520 --> 15:01.920
 at the intersection of engineering and physics to you

15:01.920 --> 15:04.080
 in this whole process that we talked about

15:04.080 --> 15:06.560
 with silicon and photolithography,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.360
 things that people were able to achieve

15:08.360 --> 15:12.320
 in order to push the Moore's Law forward?

15:12.320 --> 15:13.680
 Is it the early days,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.280
 the invention of the transistor itself?

15:16.280 --> 15:19.320
 Is it some particular cool little thing

15:19.320 --> 15:22.000
 that maybe not many people know about?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.400
 Like what do you think is the most beautiful

15:23.400 --> 15:26.800
 in this whole process, journey?

15:26.800 --> 15:29.560
 The most beautiful is a little difficult to answer.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.040
 Let me try and sidestep it a little bit

15:32.040 --> 15:36.080
 and just say what strikes me about looking at

15:36.080 --> 15:41.080
 the history of silicon microelectronics is that,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.600
 so when quantum mechanics was developed,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.440
 people quickly began applying it to semiconductors

15:47.440 --> 15:49.360
 and it was broadly understood

15:49.360 --> 15:50.760
 that these are fascinating systems

15:50.760 --> 15:52.720
 and people cared about them for their basic physics,

15:52.720 --> 15:55.040
 but also their utility is devices.

15:55.040 --> 15:59.280
 And then the transistor was invented in the late 40s

15:59.280 --> 16:02.080
 in a relatively crude experimental setup

16:02.080 --> 16:04.280
 where you just crammed a metal electrode

16:04.280 --> 16:08.040
 into the semiconductor and that was ingenious.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.960
 These people were able to make it work,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.840
 but so what I wanna get to that really strikes me

16:16.840 --> 16:19.320
 is that in those early days,

16:19.320 --> 16:21.200
 there were a number of different semiconductors

16:21.200 --> 16:22.120
 that were being considered.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.840
 They had different properties, different strengths,

16:23.840 --> 16:24.920
 different weaknesses.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.480
 Most people thought germanium was the way to go.

16:28.480 --> 16:33.480
 It had some nice properties related to things

16:33.680 --> 16:37.320
 about how the electrons move inside the lattice,

16:37.320 --> 16:39.800
 but other people thought that compound semiconductors

16:39.800 --> 16:42.000
 with group three and group five also had

16:42.000 --> 16:46.240
 really, really extraordinary properties

16:46.240 --> 16:50.080
 that might be conducive to making the best devices.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.560
 So there were different groups exploring each of these

16:52.560 --> 16:54.240
 and that's great, that's how science works.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.160
 You have to cast a broad net,

16:56.160 --> 17:01.160
 but then what I find striking is why is it that silicon won?

17:02.160 --> 17:05.280
 Because it's not that germanium is a useless material

17:05.280 --> 17:06.760
 and it's not present in technology

17:06.760 --> 17:08.080
 or compound semiconductors,

17:08.080 --> 17:12.640
 they're both doing exciting and important things,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.400
 slightly more niche applications

17:14.400 --> 17:18.080
 where a silicon is the semiconductor material

17:18.080 --> 17:19.080
 for microelectronics,

17:19.080 --> 17:21.000
 which is the platform for digital computing,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.760
 which has transformed our world.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.200
 Why did silicon win?

17:24.200 --> 17:28.720
 It's because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities

17:28.720 --> 17:32.120
 that no one of them was the clear winner,

17:32.120 --> 17:34.560
 but it made these sort of compromises

17:34.560 --> 17:36.680
 between a number of different influences.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.480
 It had that really excellent gate oxide

17:40.480 --> 17:43.240
 that allowed us to make MOSFETs,

17:43.240 --> 17:45.400
 these high performance transistors,

17:45.400 --> 17:47.200
 so quickly and cheaply and easily

17:47.200 --> 17:49.360
 without having to do a lot of materials development.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.400
 The band gap of silicon is actually,

17:53.400 --> 17:56.280
 so in a semiconductor there's an important parameter

17:56.280 --> 17:57.480
 which is called the band gap,

17:57.480 --> 18:00.600
 which tells you there are sort of electrons

18:00.600 --> 18:04.600
 that fill up to one level in the energy diagram,

18:04.600 --> 18:06.240
 and then there's a gap where electrons

18:06.240 --> 18:08.280
 aren't allowed to have an energy in a certain range,

18:08.280 --> 18:11.320
 and then there's another energy level above that,

18:11.320 --> 18:14.960
 and that difference between the lower sort of filled level

18:14.960 --> 18:16.880
 and the unoccupied level,

18:16.880 --> 18:19.640
 that tells you how much voltage you have to apply

18:19.640 --> 18:22.160
 in order to induce a current to flow.

18:22.160 --> 18:27.160
 So with germanium, that's about 0.75 electron volts.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.360
 That means you have to apply 0.75 volts

18:29.360 --> 18:31.960
 to get a current moving.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.280
 And it turns out that if you compare that

18:34.280 --> 18:38.520
 to the thermal excitations that are induced

18:38.520 --> 18:40.680
 just by the temperature of our environment,

18:40.680 --> 18:42.120
 that gap's not quite big enough.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.120
 You start to use it to perform computations,

18:45.120 --> 18:45.960
 it gets a little hot,

18:45.960 --> 18:48.160
 and you get all these accidental carriers

18:48.160 --> 18:50.720
 that are excited into the conduction band,

18:50.720 --> 18:53.400
 and it causes errors in your computation.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.240
 Silicon's band gap is just a little higher,

18:56.240 --> 18:59.000
 1.1 electron volts,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.320
 but you have an exponential dependence

19:01.320 --> 19:04.240
 on the number of carriers that are present

19:04.240 --> 19:06.680
 that can induce those errors,

19:06.680 --> 19:08.480
 it decays exponentially with that voltage.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.960
 So just that slight extra energy in that band gap

19:12.800 --> 19:17.040
 really puts it in an ideal position to be operated

19:17.040 --> 19:20.240
 in the conditions of our ambient environment.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.440
 It's kind of fascinating that like you mentioned,

19:22.440 --> 19:27.440
 errors decrease exponentially with the voltage.

19:27.480 --> 19:32.040
 So it's funny because this error thing comes up

19:32.040 --> 19:34.600
 when you start talking about quantum computing,

19:34.600 --> 19:36.040
 and it's kind of amazing that everything

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
 we've been talking about,

19:37.040 --> 19:41.480
 the errors as we scale down seems to be extremely low.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.320
 Yes.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.400
 And like all of our computation

19:45.400 --> 19:47.760
 is based on the assumption that it's extremely low.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.560
 Yes, well it's digital computation.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.480
 Digital, sorry, digital computation.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.040
 So as opposed to our biological computation in our brain,

19:55.040 --> 19:58.280
 is like the assumption is stuff is gonna fail

19:58.280 --> 19:59.160
 all over the place,

19:59.160 --> 20:01.760
 and we somehow have to still be robust to that.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.080
 That's exactly right.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.200
 So this also,

20:04.200 --> 20:05.840
 this is gonna be the most controversial part

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
 of our conversation where you're gonna make some enemies.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.080
 So let me ask,

20:09.080 --> 20:12.040
 because we've been talking about physics and engineering.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.760
 Which group of people is smarter

20:15.760 --> 20:17.840
 and more important for this one?

20:17.840 --> 20:20.600
 Let me ask the question in a better way.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
 Some of the big innovations,

20:22.600 --> 20:25.760
 some of the beautiful things that we've been talking about,

20:25.760 --> 20:27.000
 how much of it is physics?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.480
 How much of it is engineering?

20:28.480 --> 20:31.680
 My dad is a physicist and he talks down

20:31.680 --> 20:34.440
 to all the amazing engineering that we're doing

20:34.440 --> 20:37.960
 in the artificial intelligence and the computer science

20:37.960 --> 20:39.600
 and the robotics and all that space.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.680
 So we argue about this all the time.

20:41.680 --> 20:42.520
 So what do you think?

20:42.520 --> 20:43.960
 Who gets more credit?

20:43.960 --> 20:46.800
 I'm genuinely not trying to just be politically correct here.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.320
 I don't see how you would have any of the,

20:50.320 --> 20:52.640
 what we consider sort of the great accomplishments

20:52.640 --> 20:54.080
 of society without both.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.920
 You absolutely need both of those things.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.680
 Physics tends to play a key role earlier in the development

20:59.680 --> 21:04.680
 and then engineering optimization, these things take over.

21:04.680 --> 21:09.240
 And I mean, the invention of the transistor,

21:09.240 --> 21:10.880
 or actually even before that,

21:10.880 --> 21:12.880
 the understanding of semiconductor physics

21:12.880 --> 21:14.840
 that allowed the invention of the transistor,

21:14.840 --> 21:15.680
 that's all physics.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.960
 So if you didn't have that physics,

21:16.960 --> 21:20.280
 you don't even get to get on the field.

21:20.280 --> 21:24.200
 But once you have understood and demonstrated

21:24.200 --> 21:26.480
 that this is, in principle, possible,

21:26.480 --> 21:28.360
 more is less engineering.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.160
 Why we have computers more powerful

21:32.160 --> 21:36.360
 than old supercomputers in each of our phones,

21:36.360 --> 21:37.480
 that's all engineering.

21:37.480 --> 21:42.480
 And I think I would be quite foolish to say that that's

21:42.480 --> 21:46.920
 that's not valuable if it's not a great contribution.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.840
 It's a beautiful dance.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.720
 Would you put like silicon,

21:49.720 --> 21:52.760
 the understanding of the material properties

21:52.760 --> 21:54.320
 in the space of engineering?

21:54.320 --> 21:55.680
 Like how does that whole process work?

21:55.680 --> 21:58.000
 To understand that it has all these nice properties

21:58.000 --> 22:02.240
 or even the development of photolithography.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.840
 Is that basically,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.120
 would you put that in a category of engineering?

22:06.120 --> 22:09.960
 No, I would say that it is basic physics.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.160
 It is applied physics.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.720
 It's material science.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.040
 It's x ray crystallography.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.600
 It's polymer chemistry.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.520
 It's everything.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.240
 I mean, chemistry even is thrown in there.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.440
 Absolutely, yes.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.800
 The whole thing, just no biology.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.520
 We can get to biology.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.200
 Well, the biology is in the humans

22:28.200 --> 22:29.520
 that are engineering the system.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.160
 So it's all integrated deeply.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.520
 Okay, so let's return.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.600
 You mentioned this word superconductivity.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.560
 So what does that have to do with what we're talking about?

22:38.560 --> 22:39.400
 Right, okay.

22:39.400 --> 22:44.280
 So in a semiconductor, as I tried to describe a second ago,

22:44.280 --> 22:49.280
 you can sort of induce currents by applying voltages

22:50.040 --> 22:52.280
 and those have sort of typical properties

22:52.280 --> 22:55.400
 that you would expect from some kind of a conductor.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.400
 Those electrons, they don't just flow perfectly

22:59.400 --> 23:00.360
 without dissipation.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.240
 If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice

23:03.240 --> 23:05.600
 or another electron, it's gonna slow down.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.880
 It's gonna lose its momentum.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.280
 So you have to keep applying that voltage

23:09.280 --> 23:11.400
 in order to keep the current flowing.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.440
 In a superconductor, something different happens.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.520
 If you get a current to start flowing,

23:16.520 --> 23:18.280
 it will continue to flow indefinitely.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.880
 There's no dissipation.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.640
 So that's crazy.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.480
 How does that happen?

23:22.480 --> 23:26.800
 Well, it happens at low temperature and this is crucial.

23:26.800 --> 23:30.200
 It has to be a quite low temperature

23:30.200 --> 23:32.920
 and what I'm talking about there.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.800
 For essentially all of our conversation,

23:35.800 --> 23:39.640
 I'm gonna be talking about conventional superconductors,

23:39.640 --> 23:42.280
 sometimes called low TC superconductors,

23:42.280 --> 23:45.160
 low critical temperature superconductors.

23:45.160 --> 23:50.160
 And so those materials have to be at a temperature around,

23:50.680 --> 23:52.000
 say around four Kelvin.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.160
 I mean, their critical temperature

23:53.160 --> 23:55.320
 might be 10 Kelvin, something like that,

23:55.320 --> 23:57.160
 but you wanna operate them at around four Kelvin,

23:57.160 --> 23:59.280
 four degrees above absolute zero.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.680
 And what happens at that temperature,

24:01.680 --> 24:03.920
 at that very low temperatures in certain materials

24:03.920 --> 24:08.920
 is that the noise of atoms moving around,

24:10.120 --> 24:13.600
 the lad is vibrating, electrons colliding with each other.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.120
 That becomes sufficiently low

24:15.120 --> 24:18.600
 that the electrons can settle into this very special state.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.280
 It's sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum state

24:22.280 --> 24:26.560
 because if I had a piece of superconducting material here,

24:26.560 --> 24:30.960
 let's say niobium is a very typical superconductor.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.640
 If I had a block of niobium here

24:33.640 --> 24:36.720
 and we cooled it below its critical temperature,

24:36.720 --> 24:40.840
 all of the electrons in that superconducting state

24:40.840 --> 24:42.800
 would be in one coherent quantum state.

24:42.800 --> 24:46.520
 They would, the wave function of that state

24:46.520 --> 24:49.760
 is described in terms of all of the particles simultaneously,

24:49.760 --> 24:52.240
 but it extends across macroscopic dimensions,

24:52.240 --> 24:53.720
 the size of whatever material,

24:53.720 --> 24:57.040
 the size of whatever block of that material I have sitting here.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.440
 And the way that this occurs is that,

25:01.240 --> 25:03.480
 let's try to be a little bit light on the technical details,

25:03.480 --> 25:06.520
 but essentially the electrons coordinate with each other.

25:06.520 --> 25:10.320
 They are able to, in this macroscopic quantum state,

25:10.320 --> 25:12.280
 they're able to sort of,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.400
 one can quickly take the place of the other.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.800
 You can't tell electrons apart.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.720
 They're what's known as identical particles.

25:17.720 --> 25:22.040
 So if this electron runs into a defect

25:22.040 --> 25:25.000
 that would otherwise cause it to scatter,

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
 it can just sort of almost miraculously avoid that defect

25:30.440 --> 25:32.240
 because it's not really in that location.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.000
 It's part of a macroscopic quantum state

25:34.000 --> 25:37.160
 and the entire quantum state was not scattered by that defect.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.760
 So you can get a current that flows without dissipation

25:40.760 --> 25:42.960
 and that's called a supercurrent.

25:42.960 --> 25:47.800
 That's sort of just very much scratching the surface

25:47.800 --> 25:49.840
 of superconductivity.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.240
 There's very deep and rich physics there,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.520
 just probably not the main subject

25:54.520 --> 25:55.640
 we need to go into right now,

25:55.640 --> 26:00.520
 but it turns out that when you have this material,

26:00.520 --> 26:03.560
 you can do usual things like make wires out of it

26:03.560 --> 26:06.440
 so you can get current to flow in a straight line on a chip,

26:06.440 --> 26:08.920
 but you can also make other devices

26:08.920 --> 26:11.880
 that perform different kinds of operations.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.760
 Some of them are kind of logic operations

26:14.760 --> 26:16.680
 like you'd get in a transistor.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.840
 The most common or the most,

26:21.200 --> 26:25.480
 I would say, diverse in its utility component

26:25.480 --> 26:26.920
 is a Josephson junction.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.520
 It's not analogous to a transistor in the sense

26:29.520 --> 26:31.480
 that if you apply a voltage here,

26:31.480 --> 26:33.880
 it changes how much current flows from left to right,

26:33.880 --> 26:37.200
 but it is analogous in sort of a sense of

26:37.200 --> 26:41.040
 it's the go to component that a circuit engineer

26:41.040 --> 26:44.520
 is going to use to start to build up more complexity.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.840
 So these are these junctions serve as gates?

26:48.840 --> 26:50.520
 They can serve as gates.

26:50.520 --> 26:55.520
 They can, so I'm not sure how concerned to be with semantics,

26:56.560 --> 26:59.480
 but let me just briefly say what a Josephson junction is

26:59.480 --> 27:02.240
 and we can talk about different ways that they can be used.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.280
 Basically, if you have a superconducting wire

27:05.280 --> 27:09.680
 and then a small gap of a different material

27:09.680 --> 27:13.520
 that's not superconducting an insulator or normal metal

27:13.520 --> 27:15.800
 and then another superconducting wire on the other side,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.040
 that's a Josephson junction.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.320
 So it's sometimes referred to as a superconducting weak link.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.200
 So you have this superconducting state on one side

27:24.200 --> 27:25.080
 and on the other side

27:25.080 --> 27:27.520
 and that the superconducting wave function

27:27.520 --> 27:30.680
 actually tunnels across that gap.

27:30.680 --> 27:35.440
 And when you create such a physical entity,

27:35.440 --> 27:40.440
 it has very unusual current voltage characteristics.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.920
 In that gap?

27:42.920 --> 27:44.240
 Like weird stuff.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.120
 Through the entire circuit.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.560
 So you can imagine, suppose you had a loop setup

27:47.560 --> 27:51.200
 that had one of those weak links in the loop.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.200
 Current would flow in that loop,

27:53.200 --> 27:55.600
 independent even if you hadn't applied a voltage to it

27:55.600 --> 27:57.000
 and that's called the Josephson effect.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.520
 So the fact that there's this phase difference

28:00.520 --> 28:02.960
 in the quantum wave function from one side

28:02.960 --> 28:04.400
 of the tunneling barrier to the other

28:04.400 --> 28:05.760
 induces current to flow.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.640
 So how does it change state?

28:07.640 --> 28:08.520
 Right, exactly.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.560
 So how do you change state?

28:09.560 --> 28:13.880
 Now picture, if I have a current bias coming down

28:13.880 --> 28:14.920
 this line of my circuit

28:14.920 --> 28:18.120
 and there's a Josephson junction right in the middle of it

28:18.120 --> 28:19.960
 and now I make another wire

28:19.960 --> 28:21.800
 that goes around the Josephson junction.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.600
 So I have a loop here, a superconducting loop.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.960
 I can add current to that loop

28:27.960 --> 28:29.760
 by exceeding the critical current

28:29.760 --> 28:30.880
 of that Josephson junction.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.000
 So like any superconducting material,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.720
 it can carry this supercurrent that I've described,

28:37.720 --> 28:40.560
 this current that can propagate without dissipation

28:40.560 --> 28:41.840
 up to a certain level.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.280
 And if you try and pass more current than that

28:44.280 --> 28:45.960
 through the material,

28:45.960 --> 28:49.240
 it's going to become a resistive material,

28:49.240 --> 28:51.160
 a normal material.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.160
 So in the Josephson junction, the same thing happens.

28:54.160 --> 28:57.120
 I can bias it above its critical current

28:57.120 --> 28:58.240
 and then what it's gonna do,

28:58.240 --> 29:03.240
 it's going to add a quantized amount of current

29:03.560 --> 29:04.400
 into that loop.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.320
 And what I mean by quantized is,

29:06.320 --> 29:09.000
 it's going to come in discrete packets

29:09.000 --> 29:11.200
 with a well defined value of current.

29:11.200 --> 29:16.200
 So in the vernacular of some people working in this community,

29:16.880 --> 29:20.200
 you would say you pop a flux on into the loop.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.760
 So a flux on.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.680
 You pop a flux on into the loop.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.520
 Yeah.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.720
 Sounds like skateboarder talk.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.560
 I love it.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.400
 Okay.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.920
 Sorry, go ahead.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.640
 A flux on is one of these quantized sort of amounts

29:33.640 --> 29:35.200
 of current that you can add to a loop.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.600
 And this is a cartoon picture,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.400
 but I think it's sufficient for our purposes.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.800
 So which maybe it's useful to say,

29:41.720 --> 29:45.480
 what is the speed at which these discrete packets

29:45.480 --> 29:47.000
 of current travel?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.160
 Because we'll be talking about light a little bit.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.080
 It seems like the speed is important.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.000
 The speed is important.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.560
 That's an excellent question.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.680
 Sometimes I wonder where you,

29:55.680 --> 29:57.800
 how you became so astute,

29:57.800 --> 30:00.840
 but so this...

30:00.840 --> 30:02.600
 Matrix four is coming out.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.400
 So maybe that's related.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.240
 I'm not sure.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.040
 I'm dressed for the job.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.360
 I was trying to get to become an extra on matrix four.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.680
 It didn't work out.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.320
 Anyway, so what's the speed of these packets?

30:13.320 --> 30:15.040
 You'll have to find another gig.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.600
 I know, I'm sorry.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.400
 So the speed of the pack is actually these flux ons,

30:19.400 --> 30:24.240
 these sort of pulses of current

30:24.240 --> 30:26.160
 that are generated by Joseph's injunctions.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.680
 They can actually propagate very close to the speed of light,

30:29.680 --> 30:31.880
 maybe something like a third of the speed of light.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.840
 That's quite fast.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.240
 So one of the reasons why Joseph's injunctions are appealing

30:37.240 --> 30:40.560
 is because their signals can propagate quite fast

30:40.560 --> 30:43.400
 and they can also switch very fast.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.040
 What I mean by switch is perform that operation

30:46.040 --> 30:49.400
 that I described where you add current to the loop.

30:49.400 --> 30:53.920
 That can happen within a few tens of picoseconds.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.840
 So you can get devices that operate

30:56.840 --> 30:58.800
 in the hundreds of gigahertz range.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.040
 And by comparison, most processors

31:02.040 --> 31:03.960
 in our conventional computers

31:03.960 --> 31:07.120
 operate closer to the one gigahertz range.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.840
 Maybe three gigahertz seems to be kind of

31:09.840 --> 31:12.560
 where those speeds have leveled out.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.560
 So the gamers listening to this are getting really excited

31:15.560 --> 31:17.640
 that overclock their system to like,

31:17.640 --> 31:19.560
 what is it like four gigahertz or something?

31:19.560 --> 31:21.960
 100 is sounds incredible.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.080
 Can I just, as a tiny tangent,

31:24.080 --> 31:26.880
 is the physics of this understood well

31:26.880 --> 31:28.520
 how to do this stably?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.160
 Oh yes, the physics is understood well.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.560
 The physics of Joseph's injunctions is understood well.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.520
 The technology is understood quite well too.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.600
 The reasons why it hasn't displaced

31:37.600 --> 31:41.720
 silicon microelectronics in conventional digital computing,

31:41.720 --> 31:45.040
 I think are more related to what I was alluding to before

31:45.040 --> 31:49.280
 about the myriad practical, almost mundane aspects

31:49.280 --> 31:52.120
 of silicon that make it so useful.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.920
 You can make a transistor ever smaller and smaller

31:55.920 --> 31:58.840
 and it will still performance digital function quite well.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.800
 The same is not true of a Josephson junction.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.520
 You really, it's not the same thing

32:03.520 --> 32:05.480
 that there's this feature that you can keep making

32:05.480 --> 32:07.040
 smaller and smaller and it'll keep performing

32:07.040 --> 32:08.240
 the same operations.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.520
 This loop I described, any Josephson circuit,

32:11.520 --> 32:14.400
 well, I wanna be careful, I shouldn't say any Josephson

32:14.400 --> 32:17.280
 circuit, but many Josephson circuits,

32:17.280 --> 32:19.480
 the way they process information

32:19.480 --> 32:21.320
 or the way they perform whatever function it is

32:21.320 --> 32:22.800
 they're trying to do, maybe it's sensing

32:22.800 --> 32:26.400
 a weak magnetic field, it depends on an interplay

32:26.400 --> 32:28.840
 between the junction and that loop.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.600
 And you can't make that loop much smaller

32:30.600 --> 32:32.160
 and it's not for practical reasons

32:32.160 --> 32:33.480
 that have to do with lithography.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.720
 It's for fundamental physical reasons

32:35.720 --> 32:39.000
 about the way the magnetic field interacts

32:39.000 --> 32:41.200
 with that superconducting material.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.840
 There are physical limits that no matter

32:43.840 --> 32:47.280
 how good our technology got, those circuits would,

32:47.280 --> 32:50.400
 I think would never be able to be scaled down

32:50.400 --> 32:54.400
 to the densities that silicon microelectronics can.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.000
 I don't know if we mentioned, is there something interesting

32:57.000 --> 33:00.240
 about the various superconducting materials involved

33:00.240 --> 33:01.080
 or is it all?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.680
 There's a lot of stuff that's interesting.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.480
 And it's not silicon.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.880
 It's not silicon, no.

33:05.880 --> 33:09.560
 So like, it's some materials that also require

33:09.560 --> 33:12.080
 to be super cold for Kelvin and so on.

33:12.080 --> 33:15.320
 Yes, so let's dissect a couple of those different things.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.520
 The super cold part, let me just mention

33:18.520 --> 33:20.600
 for your gamers out there that are trying to clock it

33:20.600 --> 33:22.160
 at four gigahertz and would love to go to 400.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.160
 What kind of cooling system can achieve for Kelvin?

33:24.160 --> 33:26.320
 For Kelvin, you need liquid helium.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.920
 And so liquid helium is expensive, it's inconvenient.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.120
 You need a cryostat that sits there

33:32.120 --> 33:36.560
 and the energy consumption of that cryostat

33:36.560 --> 33:39.760
 is impracticable for, it's not going in your cell phone.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.760
 You're not, so you can picture holding your cell phone

33:41.760 --> 33:46.160
 like this and then something the size of a keg of beer

33:46.160 --> 33:47.840
 or something on your back to cool it.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.600
 Like that makes no sense.

33:49.600 --> 33:54.160
 So if you're trying to make this in consumer devices,

33:54.160 --> 33:57.040
 electronics that are ubiquitous across society,

33:57.040 --> 33:59.320
 superconductors are not in the race for that.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.040
 For now, but you're saying,

34:01.040 --> 34:03.280
 so just to frame the conversation,

34:03.280 --> 34:06.600
 maybe the thing we're focused on is computing systems

34:06.600 --> 34:10.440
 that serve as servers, like large systems.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.440
 Yes, large systems.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.800
 So then you can contrast what's going on in your cell phone

34:14.800 --> 34:18.240
 with what's going on at one of the supercomputers,

34:19.400 --> 34:22.080
 colleague Katie Schumann invited us out to Oak Ridge

34:22.080 --> 34:24.080
 a few years ago, so we got to see Titan

34:24.080 --> 34:26.120
 and that was when they were building Summit.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.280
 So these are some high performance supercomputers

34:29.280 --> 34:32.480
 out in Tennessee and those are filling entire rooms

34:32.480 --> 34:33.920
 the size of warehouses.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
 So once you're at that level,

34:35.920 --> 34:37.760
 okay, there you're already putting a lot of power

34:37.760 --> 34:42.240
 into cooling is part of your engineering task

34:42.240 --> 34:43.560
 that you have to deal with.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.560
 So there it's not entirely obvious

34:45.560 --> 34:49.520
 that cooling to for Kelvin is out of the question.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.240
 It has not happened yet and I can speak to why that is

34:53.240 --> 34:55.480
 in the digital domain if you're interested.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.520
 I think it's not going to happen.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.520
 I don't think superconductors

35:00.520 --> 35:04.640
 are gonna replace semiconductors for digital computation.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.600
 There are a lot of reasons for that,

35:07.600 --> 35:09.760
 but I think ultimately what it comes down to

35:09.760 --> 35:13.400
 is all things considered cooling errors,

35:13.400 --> 35:16.040
 scaling down to feature sizes, all that stuff,

35:16.040 --> 35:19.360
 semiconductors work better at the system level.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.680
 Is there some aspect of just curious

35:22.680 --> 35:25.520
 about the historical momentum of this?

35:25.520 --> 35:28.160
 Is there some power to the momentum of an industry

35:28.160 --> 35:31.160
 that's mass manufacturing using a certain material?

35:31.160 --> 35:33.640
 Is this like a Titanic shifting?

35:33.640 --> 35:37.080
 Like what's your sense when a good idea comes along,

35:37.080 --> 35:39.880
 how good does that idea need to be

35:39.880 --> 35:42.600
 for the Titanic to start shifting?

35:42.600 --> 35:44.160
 That's an excellent question.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.480
 That's an excellent way to frame it.

35:46.480 --> 35:51.280
 And you know, I don't know the answer to that,

35:51.280 --> 35:54.680
 but what I think is, okay, so the history

35:54.680 --> 35:57.960
 of the superconducting logic goes back to the 70s.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.400
 IBM made a big push to do superconducting digital computing

36:01.400 --> 36:06.080
 in the 70s and they made some choices about their devices

36:06.080 --> 36:07.360
 and their architectures and things

36:07.360 --> 36:11.000
 that in hindsight were kind of doomed to fail.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.120
 And I don't mean any disrespect for the people that did it.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.280
 It was hard to see at the time,

36:14.280 --> 36:17.880
 but then another generation of superconducting logic

36:17.880 --> 36:22.320
 was introduced, I wanna say the 90s,

36:22.320 --> 36:24.960
 someone named Lykarev and Seminov,

36:24.960 --> 36:28.280
 they propose an entire family of circuits

36:28.280 --> 36:29.960
 based on Joseph's injunctions

36:29.960 --> 36:33.440
 that are doing digital computing based on logic gates

36:33.440 --> 36:36.600
 and or not these kinds of things.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.560
 And they showed how it could go hundreds of times faster

36:41.560 --> 36:43.200
 than silicon microelectronics.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.360
 And it's extremely exciting.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.040
 I wasn't working in the field at that time,

36:47.040 --> 36:49.560
 but later when I went back and read the literature,

36:49.560 --> 36:52.040
 I was just like, wow, this is so awesome.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.000
 And so you might think, well,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.280
 the reason why it didn't display silicon

36:58.280 --> 37:01.720
 is because silicon already had so much momentum at that time.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.280
 But that was the 90s, silicon kept that momentum

37:04.280 --> 37:06.920
 because it had the simple way to keep getting better.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.680
 You just make features smaller and smaller.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.760
 So it would have to be,

37:11.760 --> 37:13.520
 I don't think it would have to be that much better

37:13.520 --> 37:15.400
 than silicon to displace it,

37:15.400 --> 37:17.760
 but the problem is it's just not better than silicon.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.920
 It might be better than silicon in one metric,

37:19.920 --> 37:21.400
 speed of a switching operation

37:21.400 --> 37:24.360
 or power consumption of a switching operation.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.000
 But building a digital computer

37:26.000 --> 37:28.680
 is a lot more than just that elemental operation.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.000
 It's everything that goes into it,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.280
 including the manufacturing, including the packaging,

37:33.280 --> 37:38.280
 including the various materials aspects of things.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.560
 So the reason why,

37:40.560 --> 37:42.760
 and even in some of those early papers,

37:42.760 --> 37:44.080
 I can't remember which one it was,

37:44.080 --> 37:47.400
 Lykarev said something along the lines of,

37:47.400 --> 37:49.880
 you can see how we could build an entire family

37:49.880 --> 37:52.760
 of digital electronic circuits based on these components.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.960
 They could go a hundred or more times faster

37:54.960 --> 37:59.280
 than semiconductor logic gates.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.160
 But I don't think that's the right way to use

38:01.160 --> 38:02.680
 superconducting electronic circuits.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.320
 He didn't say what the right way was,

38:04.320 --> 38:07.440
 but he basically said digital logic,

38:07.440 --> 38:11.280
 trying to steal the show from silicon

38:11.280 --> 38:13.440
 is probably not what these circuits

38:13.440 --> 38:16.360
 are most suited to accomplish.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.840
 So if we can just linger on, use the word computation.

38:20.840 --> 38:24.080
 When you talk about computation, how do you think about it?

38:24.080 --> 38:28.960
 Do you think purely on just the switching

38:28.960 --> 38:31.360
 or do you think something a little bit larger scale

38:31.360 --> 38:33.560
 a circuit taken together performing

38:33.560 --> 38:38.280
 the basic arithmetic operations that are then required

38:38.280 --> 38:42.200
 to do the kind of computation that makes up a computer?

38:42.200 --> 38:44.440
 Because when we talk about the speed of computation,

38:44.440 --> 38:47.000
 is it boiled down to the basic switching

38:47.000 --> 38:49.240
 or is there some bigger picture that you're thinking about?

38:49.240 --> 38:52.280
 Well, all right, so maybe we should disambiguate.

38:52.280 --> 38:55.600
 There are a variety of different kinds of computation.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.200
 I don't pretend to be an expert

38:57.200 --> 39:00.160
 in the theory of computation or anything like that.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.480
 I guess it's important to differentiate

39:02.480 --> 39:05.760
 though between digital logic,

39:05.760 --> 39:09.760
 which represents information as a series of bits,

39:09.760 --> 39:12.960
 binary digits, which you can think of them

39:12.960 --> 39:14.120
 as zeros and ones or whatever,

39:14.120 --> 39:17.360
 usually they correspond to a physical system

39:17.360 --> 39:21.200
 that has two very well separated states.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.800
 And then other kinds of computation,

39:22.800 --> 39:25.240
 like we'll get into more the way your brain works,

39:25.240 --> 39:30.240
 which it is, I think indisputably processing information,

39:30.360 --> 39:34.040
 but where the computation begins and ends

39:34.040 --> 39:36.320
 is not anywhere near as well defined.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.640
 It doesn't depend on these two levels.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.280
 Here's a zero, here's a one.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.600
 There's a lot of gray area

39:42.600 --> 39:45.600
 that's usually referred to as analog computing.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.840
 Also in conventional digital computers

39:49.840 --> 39:54.200
 or digital computers in general,

39:54.200 --> 39:57.240
 you have a concept of what's called arithmetic depth,

39:57.240 --> 39:59.760
 which is jargon that basically means

39:59.760 --> 40:03.800
 how many sequential operations are performed

40:03.800 --> 40:07.600
 to turn an input into an output.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.840
 And those kinds of computations in digital systems

40:10.840 --> 40:14.440
 are highly serial, meaning that data streams,

40:14.440 --> 40:16.440
 they don't branch off too far to the side.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.840
 You do, you have to pull some information over there

40:18.840 --> 40:20.840
 and access memory from here and stuff like that.

40:20.840 --> 40:24.280
 But by and large, the computation proceeds

40:24.280 --> 40:26.160
 in a serial manner.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.680
 It's not that way in the brain.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.680
 In the brain, you're always drawing information

40:30.680 --> 40:31.520
 from different places.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.760
 It's much more network based computing.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.600
 Neurons don't wait for their turn.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.120
 They fire when they're ready to fire.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.160
 And so it's asynchronous.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.600
 So one of the other things about a digital system

40:41.600 --> 40:44.440
 is you're performing these operations on a clock.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.640
 And that's a crucial aspect of it.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.840
 Get rid of a clock in a digital system.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.400
 Nothing makes sense anymore.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.520
 The brain has no clock.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.840
 It builds its own time scales based

40:53.840 --> 40:56.520
 on its internal activity.

40:56.520 --> 41:00.120
 So you can think of the brain as kind of like this network

41:00.120 --> 41:03.160
 computation where it's actually really trivial,

41:03.160 --> 41:07.440
 simple computers, just a huge number of them

41:07.440 --> 41:09.000
 and they're networked together.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.920
 I would say it is complex, sophisticated little processors

41:12.920 --> 41:14.400
 and there's a huge number of them.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.400
 Neurons are not.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.560
 No offense, I don't mean to offend Neurons.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.680
 They're very complicated and beautiful.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.920
 Yeah, but we often oversimplify them.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.800
 Yes, they're actually like there's computation happening

41:24.800 --> 41:25.640
 within a Neuron.

41:25.640 --> 41:29.480
 Right, so I would say to think of a transistor

41:29.480 --> 41:32.320
 as the building block of a digital computer is accurate.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.640
 You use a few transistors to make your logic gates.

41:34.640 --> 41:35.960
 You build up more.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.800
 You build up processors from logic gates

41:37.800 --> 41:39.120
 and things like that.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.560
 So you can think of a transistor

41:40.560 --> 41:42.280
 as a fundamental building block

41:42.280 --> 41:44.520
 or you can think of as we get into more

41:44.520 --> 41:46.320
 highly parallelized architectures,

41:46.320 --> 41:49.280
 you can think of a processor as a fundamental building block

41:49.280 --> 41:53.120
 to make the analogy to the neuro side of things.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.280
 A Neuron is not a transistor.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.280
 A Neuron is a processor.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.160
 It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors

42:00.160 --> 42:03.040
 but they are more, they're lower

42:03.040 --> 42:05.360
 on the information processing hierarchy in a sense.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.160
 They do a bulk of the computation

42:08.160 --> 42:13.160
 but Neurons are entire processors in and of themselves

42:13.560 --> 42:16.240
 that can take in many different kinds of inputs

42:16.240 --> 42:18.760
 on many different spatial and temporal scales

42:18.760 --> 42:20.840
 and produce many different kinds of outputs

42:20.840 --> 42:23.840
 so that they can perform different computations

42:23.840 --> 42:24.880
 in different contexts.

42:24.880 --> 42:27.440
 So this is where it enters this distinction

42:27.440 --> 42:30.720
 between computation and communication.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.120
 So you can think of Neuron as performing computation

42:34.120 --> 42:39.000
 and the networking, the interconnectivity of Neurons

42:39.000 --> 42:40.920
 is communication between Neurons.

42:40.920 --> 42:44.040
 And you see this with very large server systems.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.160
 I mentioned offline, we've been talking to Jim Keller

42:46.160 --> 42:50.080
 whose dream is to build giant computers that, you know

42:50.080 --> 42:52.360
 the bottom like there's often the communication

42:52.360 --> 42:54.680
 between the different pieces of the computing.

42:54.680 --> 42:57.360
 So in this paper that we mentioned

42:57.360 --> 42:59.640
 Optoelectronic Intelligence,

42:59.640 --> 43:03.200
 you say electrons excel at computation

43:03.200 --> 43:08.200
 while light is excellent for communication.

43:08.360 --> 43:11.000
 Maybe you can linger and say in this context,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.960
 what do you mean by computation and communication?

43:13.960 --> 43:17.400
 What are electrons? What is light?

43:17.400 --> 43:20.640
 And why do they excel at those two tasks?

43:20.640 --> 43:23.600
 Yeah, just to first speak to computation

43:23.600 --> 43:27.680
 versus communication, I would say computation

43:27.680 --> 43:31.600
 is essentially taking in some information,

43:32.440 --> 43:34.640
 performing operations on that information

43:34.640 --> 43:39.000
 and producing new hopefully more useful information.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.920
 So for example, imagine you have a picture

43:43.920 --> 43:48.040
 in front of you and there is a key in it

43:48.040 --> 43:49.600
 and that's what you're looking for for whatever reason.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.560
 You wanna find the key, we all wanna find the key.

43:51.560 --> 43:56.560
 So the input is that entire picture

43:56.560 --> 43:59.040
 and the output might be the coordinates where the key is.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.520
 So you've reduced the total amount of information you have

44:01.520 --> 44:03.000
 but you found the useful information

44:03.000 --> 44:04.400
 for you in that present moment.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.480
 That's the useful information.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.160
 And you think about this computation

44:07.160 --> 44:10.840
 as the controlled synchronous sequential?

44:10.840 --> 44:12.680
 Not necessarily, it could be.

44:12.680 --> 44:16.240
 That could be how your system is performing the computation

44:16.240 --> 44:19.320
 or it could be asynchronous.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.400
 There are lots of ways to find the key.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.680
 It depends on the nature of the data.

44:23.680 --> 44:27.520
 It depends on, that's a very simplified example,

44:27.520 --> 44:28.720
 a picture with a key in it.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.560
 What about if you're in the world

44:30.560 --> 44:32.520
 and you're trying to decide the best way

44:32.520 --> 44:35.960
 to live your life, you know?

44:35.960 --> 44:37.040
 It might be interactive,

44:37.040 --> 44:38.600
 it might be there might be some recurrence

44:38.600 --> 44:41.320
 or some weird asynchronous, I got it.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.240
 But there's an input and there's an output

44:43.240 --> 44:44.400
 and you do some stuff in the middle

44:44.400 --> 44:46.000
 that actually goes from the input to the output.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.320
 You've taken in information

44:47.320 --> 44:49.040
 and output different information,

44:49.040 --> 44:51.760
 hopefully reducing the total amount of information

44:51.760 --> 44:53.760
 and extracting what's useful.

44:53.760 --> 44:57.720
 Communication is then getting that information

44:57.720 --> 44:59.400
 from the location to which it's stored

44:59.400 --> 45:02.640
 because information is physical as Landauer emphasized.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.000
 And so it is in one place

45:05.000 --> 45:07.800
 and you need to get that information to another place

45:07.800 --> 45:10.080
 so that something else can use it

45:10.080 --> 45:12.000
 for whatever computation it's working on.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.440
 Maybe it's part of the same network

45:13.440 --> 45:15.000
 and you're all trying to solve the same problem,

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
 but neuron A over here just deduced something

45:20.480 --> 45:24.120
 based on its inputs and it's now sending that information

45:24.120 --> 45:26.440
 across the network to another location.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.400
 So that would be the act of communication.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.800
 Can you look on Landau and saying information is physical?

45:31.800 --> 45:35.320
 Rolf Landauer, not to be confused with Lev Landau.

45:35.320 --> 45:38.000
 Yeah, and he made huge contributions

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
 to our understanding of the reversibility of information

45:43.000 --> 45:46.720
 and this concept that energy has to be dissipated

45:46.720 --> 45:50.160
 and computing when the computation is irreversible,

45:50.160 --> 45:52.160
 but if you can manage to make it reversible,

45:52.160 --> 45:55.120
 then you don't need to expend energy,

45:55.120 --> 45:59.720
 but if you do expend energy to perform a computation,

45:59.720 --> 46:02.360
 there's sort of a minimal amount that you have to do

46:02.360 --> 46:04.520
 and it's KT log two.

46:04.520 --> 46:05.960
 And it's also somehow related

46:05.960 --> 46:07.720
 to the second law of thermodynamics

46:07.720 --> 46:09.680
 and that the universe is an information process

46:09.680 --> 46:11.560
 and then we're living in a simulation.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.040
 So, okay, sorry for that tangent.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.000
 So that's the defining,

46:16.000 --> 46:19.640
 the distinction between computation and communication.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.000
 Let me say one more thing just to clarify,

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
 communication ideally does not change the information.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.960
 It moves it from one place to another,

46:28.960 --> 46:30.960
 but it is preserved.

46:30.960 --> 46:32.560
 Got it, okay.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.760
 All right, that's beautiful.

46:33.760 --> 46:38.640
 So then the electron versus light distinction

46:38.640 --> 46:42.400
 and why are electrons good at computation

46:42.400 --> 46:44.560
 and light good at communication?

46:44.560 --> 46:48.840
 Yes, this is, there's a lot that goes into it, I guess,

46:48.840 --> 46:51.720
 but just try to speak to the simplest part of it.

46:54.120 --> 46:57.040
 Electrons interact strongly with one another.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.400
 They're charged particles.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.040
 So if I pile a bunch of them over here,

47:02.040 --> 47:03.880
 they're feeling a certain amount of force

47:03.880 --> 47:05.680
 and they wanna move somewhere else.

47:05.680 --> 47:06.920
 They're strongly interactive.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.920
 You can also get them to sit still.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.680
 You can, an electron has a mass,

47:10.680 --> 47:15.680
 so you can cause it to be spatially localized.

47:15.880 --> 47:18.120
 So for computation, that's useful

47:18.120 --> 47:20.160
 because now I can make these little devices

47:20.160 --> 47:21.960
 that put a bunch of electrons over here

47:21.960 --> 47:25.640
 and then I change the state of a gate,

47:25.640 --> 47:26.480
 like I've been describing,

47:26.480 --> 47:28.400
 put a different voltage on this gate

47:28.400 --> 47:30.000
 and now I move the electrons over here.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.240
 Now they're sitting somewhere else.

47:31.240 --> 47:34.000
 I have a physical mechanism

47:34.000 --> 47:36.080
 with which I can represent information.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.400
 It's spatially localized

47:37.400 --> 47:39.080
 and I have knobs that I can adjust

47:39.080 --> 47:42.440
 to change where those electrons are or what they're doing.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.000
 Light by contrast, photons of light,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.160
 which are the discrete packets of energy

47:48.160 --> 47:50.840
 that were identified by Einstein,

47:50.840 --> 47:53.560
 they do not interact with each other,

47:54.640 --> 47:56.320
 especially at low light levels.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.440
 If you're in a medium

47:57.440 --> 48:00.440
 and you have a bright, high light level,

48:00.440 --> 48:02.600
 you can get them to interact with each other

48:02.600 --> 48:05.400
 through the interaction with that medium that they're in,

48:05.400 --> 48:07.880
 but that's a little bit more exotic

48:07.880 --> 48:10.400
 and for the purposes of this conversation,

48:10.400 --> 48:13.280
 we can assume that photons don't interact with each other.

48:13.280 --> 48:16.160
 So if you have a bunch of them

48:16.160 --> 48:17.640
 all propagating in the same direction,

48:17.640 --> 48:19.200
 they don't interfere with each other.

48:19.200 --> 48:23.000
 If I wanna send, if I have a communication channel

48:23.000 --> 48:24.520
 and I put one more photon on it,

48:24.520 --> 48:26.080
 it doesn't screw up with those other ones,

48:26.080 --> 48:29.120
 it doesn't change what those other ones were doing at all.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.320
 So that's really useful for communication

48:31.320 --> 48:33.360
 because that means you can sort of

48:33.360 --> 48:35.640
 allow a lot of these photons to flow

48:36.840 --> 48:38.880
 without disruption of each other

48:38.880 --> 48:41.160
 and they can branch really easily and things like that,

48:41.160 --> 48:42.760
 but it's not good for computation

48:42.760 --> 48:46.400
 because it's very hard for this packet of light

48:46.400 --> 48:48.760
 to change what this packet of light is doing.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.240
 They pass right through each other.

48:50.240 --> 48:53.320
 So in computation, you want to change information

48:53.320 --> 48:55.760
 and if photons don't interact with each other,

48:55.760 --> 48:57.400
 it's difficult to get them to change

48:57.400 --> 48:59.440
 the information represented by the others.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.440
 So that's the fundamental difference.

49:01.440 --> 49:04.800
 Is there also something about the way they travel

49:04.800 --> 49:06.440
 through different materials

49:07.520 --> 49:10.720
 or is that just a particular engineering?

49:10.720 --> 49:12.600
 No, it's not, that's deep physics, I think.

49:12.600 --> 49:17.080
 So this gets back to electrons interact with each other

49:17.080 --> 49:18.160
 and photons don't.

49:18.160 --> 49:22.440
 So say I'm trying to get a packet of information

49:22.440 --> 49:25.840
 from me to you and we have a wire going between us.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.040
 In order for me to send electrons across that wire,

49:29.040 --> 49:32.200
 I first have to raise the voltage at my end of the wire

49:32.200 --> 49:34.600
 and that means putting a bunch of charges on it

49:34.600 --> 49:39.160
 and then that charge packet has to propagate along the wire

49:39.160 --> 49:40.640
 and it has to get all the way over to you.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.720
 There's, that wire is gonna have something

49:42.720 --> 49:45.800
 that's called capacitance which basically tells you

49:45.800 --> 49:48.080
 how much charge you need to put on the wire

49:48.080 --> 49:49.960
 in order to raise the voltage on it

49:49.960 --> 49:52.520
 and the capacitance is gonna be proportional

49:52.520 --> 49:54.040
 to the length of the wire.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.880
 So the longer the length of the wire is,

49:56.880 --> 49:59.120
 the more charge I have to put on it

49:59.120 --> 50:03.080
 and the energy required to charge up that line

50:03.080 --> 50:04.960
 and move those electrons to you

50:04.960 --> 50:06.840
 is also proportional to the capacitance

50:06.840 --> 50:08.480
 and goes as the voltage squared.

50:08.480 --> 50:10.560
 So you get this huge penalty

50:10.560 --> 50:15.040
 if you wanna send electrons across a wire

50:15.040 --> 50:16.600
 over appreciable distances.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.120
 So distance is an important thing here

50:19.120 --> 50:20.800
 when you're doing communication.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.120
 Distance is an important thing.

50:22.120 --> 50:25.360
 So is the number of connections I'm trying to make.

50:25.360 --> 50:27.640
 Me to you, okay, one, that's not so bad.

50:27.640 --> 50:31.440
 If I want to now send it to 10,000 other friends

50:31.440 --> 50:34.360
 then all of those wires are adding tons

50:34.360 --> 50:35.480
 of extra capacitance.

50:35.480 --> 50:37.680
 Now, not only does it take forever

50:37.680 --> 50:39.560
 to put the charge on that wire

50:39.560 --> 50:41.840
 and raise the voltage on all those lines

50:41.840 --> 50:43.560
 but it takes a ton of power

50:43.560 --> 50:47.000
 and the number 10,000 is not randomly chosen.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.120
 That's roughly how many connections

50:49.120 --> 50:50.640
 each neuron in your brain makes.

50:50.640 --> 50:55.080
 So a neuron in your brain needs to send 10,000 messages

50:55.080 --> 50:56.800
 every time it has something to say.

50:56.800 --> 51:00.160
 You can't do that if you're trying to drive electrons

51:00.160 --> 51:02.120
 from here to 10,000 different places.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.720
 The brain does it in a slightly different way

51:03.720 --> 51:04.920
 which we can discuss.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.080
 How can light achieve the 10,000 connections

51:07.080 --> 51:12.000
 and why is it better in terms of like the energy use

51:12.000 --> 51:14.240
 required to use light for the communication

51:14.240 --> 51:15.360
 of the 10,000 connections?

51:15.360 --> 51:16.200
 Right, right.

51:16.200 --> 51:17.720
 So now instead of trying to send electrons

51:17.720 --> 51:19.400
 for me to you, I'm trying to send photons.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.560
 So I can make what's called a wave guide

51:21.560 --> 51:25.160
 which is just a simple piece of a material.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.120
 It could be glass like an optical fiber

51:27.120 --> 51:29.920
 or silicon on a chip.

51:29.920 --> 51:34.200
 And I just have to inject photons into that wave guide

51:34.200 --> 51:35.840
 and independent of how long it is,

51:35.840 --> 51:39.680
 independent of how many different connections I'm making,

51:39.680 --> 51:43.160
 it doesn't change the voltage or anything like that

51:43.160 --> 51:45.520
 that I have to raise up on the wire.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.960
 So if I have one more connection,

51:47.960 --> 51:49.840
 if I add additional connections,

51:49.840 --> 51:51.800
 I need to add more light to the wave guide

51:51.800 --> 51:53.320
 because those photons need to split

51:53.320 --> 51:55.080
 and go to different paths.

51:55.080 --> 51:55.920
 That makes sense.

51:55.920 --> 51:58.880
 But I don't have a capacitive penalty.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.320
 Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.480
 There are no parasitics associated with light

52:03.480 --> 52:04.480
 in that same sense.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.320
 So.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.520
 Well, just to, this might be a dumb question,

52:07.520 --> 52:10.960
 but how do I catch a photon on the other end?

52:10.960 --> 52:12.520
 What's, is it material?

52:12.520 --> 52:15.040
 Is it the polymer stuff you were talking about

52:15.040 --> 52:19.400
 for the, for a different application for photolithography?

52:19.400 --> 52:21.000
 Like how do you catch a photon?

52:21.000 --> 52:22.520
 There's a lot of ways to catch a photon.

52:22.520 --> 52:23.640
 It's not a dumb question.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.960
 It's a, it's a deep and important question

52:25.960 --> 52:29.240
 that basically defines a lot of the work

52:29.240 --> 52:31.400
 that goes on in our group at NIST.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.440
 One of my group leaders,

52:33.440 --> 52:35.360
 Sey Woonam has built his career

52:35.360 --> 52:38.440
 around these superconducting single photon detectors.

52:38.440 --> 52:42.480
 So if you're going to try to sort of reach a lower limit

52:42.480 --> 52:45.280
 and detect just one particle of light,

52:45.280 --> 52:47.680
 superconductors come back into our conversation

52:47.680 --> 52:50.160
 and just picture a simple device

52:50.160 --> 52:51.880
 where you have current flowing through

52:51.880 --> 52:54.640
 a superconducting wire and.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.600
 A loop again or no?

52:56.600 --> 52:57.840
 Let's say yes, you have a loop.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.600
 So you have a superconducting wire

52:59.600 --> 53:01.040
 that goes straight down like this

53:01.040 --> 53:02.600
 and on, on your loop branch,

53:02.600 --> 53:04.280
 you have a little ammeter,

53:04.280 --> 53:05.840
 something that measures current.

53:05.840 --> 53:09.040
 There's a resistor up there to go with me here.

53:09.040 --> 53:12.040
 So you're, you're current biasing this.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.240
 So there's current flowing through

53:13.240 --> 53:14.440
 that superconducting branch.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.600
 Since there's a resistor over here,

53:16.600 --> 53:18.960
 all the current goes through the superconducting branch.

53:18.960 --> 53:22.320
 Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.320
 We talked about this superconducting

53:24.320 --> 53:25.800
 macroscopic quantum state.

53:25.800 --> 53:28.520
 That's going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon.

53:28.520 --> 53:32.120
 So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.800
 And you've properly designed your circuit

53:33.800 --> 53:36.720
 so that the resistance on that superconducting branch

53:36.720 --> 53:38.440
 is much greater than the other resistance.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.800
 Now all of your current is going to go that way.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.280
 Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.160
 That must mean I detected a photon.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.240
 Then where you broke that superconductivity

53:47.240 --> 53:49.120
 in a matter of a few nanoseconds,

53:49.120 --> 53:51.120
 it cools back off, dissipates that energy

53:51.120 --> 53:52.960
 and the current flows back through

53:52.960 --> 53:54.280
 that superconducting branch.

53:54.280 --> 53:59.280
 This is a very powerful superconducting device

53:59.280 --> 54:02.280
 that allows us to understand quantum states of light.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.880
 I didn't realize a loop like that

54:04.880 --> 54:07.160
 could be sensitive to a single photon.

54:07.160 --> 54:11.360
 I mean, that seems strange to me.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.360
 Because, I mean, so what happens

54:14.360 --> 54:16.600
 when you just barrage it with photons?

54:16.600 --> 54:18.360
 If you put a bunch of photons in there,

54:18.360 --> 54:19.880
 essentially the same thing happens.

54:19.880 --> 54:21.680
 You just drive it into the normal state,

54:21.680 --> 54:23.160
 it becomes resistive,

54:23.160 --> 54:25.400
 and it's not particularly interesting.

54:25.400 --> 54:28.000
 So you have to be careful how many photons you send.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.080
 Like you have to be very precise with your communication.

54:30.080 --> 54:31.200
 Well, it depends.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.200
 So I would say that that's actually in the application

54:34.200 --> 54:37.040
 that we're trying to use these detectors for.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.840
 That's a feature because what we want is for,

54:41.120 --> 54:46.120
 if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection

54:46.640 --> 54:49.840
 and one of these superconducting detectors is sitting there,

54:49.840 --> 54:51.200
 you get this pulse of current

54:51.200 --> 54:54.000
 and that synapse says event,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.040
 then I'm gonna do what I do when there's a synapse event,

54:56.040 --> 54:58.640
 I'm gonna perform computations, that kind of thing.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.080
 But if accidentally you send two there or three or five,

55:02.080 --> 55:03.360
 it does the exact same.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.200
 Got it.

55:04.200 --> 55:09.200
 So this is how in the system that we're devising here,

55:10.080 --> 55:12.800
 communication is entirely binary.

55:12.800 --> 55:15.080
 And that's what I tried to emphasize a second ago.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.840
 Communication should not change the information.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.440
 You're not saying,

55:19.440 --> 55:22.320
 oh, I got this kind of communication event for photons.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.760
 No, we're not keeping track of that.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.640
 This neuron fired, this synapse says that neuron fired.

55:26.640 --> 55:27.480
 That's it.

55:27.480 --> 55:31.520
 So that's a noise filtering property of those detectors.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.200
 However, there are other applications

55:33.200 --> 55:36.200
 where you'd rather know the exact number of photons.

55:36.200 --> 55:39.360
 That can be very useful in quantum computing with light.

55:39.360 --> 55:42.200
 And our group does a lot of work around

55:42.200 --> 55:44.640
 another kind of superconducting sensor

55:44.640 --> 55:46.720
 called a transition edge sensor

55:46.720 --> 55:50.000
 that Adrian Alida in our group does a lot of work on that.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.640
 And that can tell you,

55:52.640 --> 55:55.840
 based on the amplitude of the current pulse you divert,

55:55.840 --> 56:00.320
 exactly how many photons were in that pulse.

56:00.320 --> 56:01.160
 So...

56:01.160 --> 56:02.480
 What's that useful for?

56:02.480 --> 56:04.680
 One way that you can encode information

56:04.680 --> 56:07.400
 in quantum states of light is in the number of photons.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.280
 You can have what are called number states.

56:09.280 --> 56:13.000
 And a number state will have a well defined number of photons.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.360
 And maybe the output of your quantum computation

56:16.360 --> 56:19.720
 encodes its information in the number of photons

56:19.720 --> 56:20.560
 that are generated.

56:20.560 --> 56:23.000
 So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that,

56:23.000 --> 56:24.240
 it's extremely useful.

56:24.240 --> 56:29.240
 Can you achieve like a clock with photons?

56:29.240 --> 56:30.200
 Or is that not important?

56:30.200 --> 56:33.320
 Is there a synchronicity here?

56:33.320 --> 56:35.400
 In general, it can be important.

56:36.920 --> 56:39.400
 Clock distribution is a big challenge

56:39.400 --> 56:43.320
 in especially large computational systems.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.360
 And so yes, optical clocks,

56:45.360 --> 56:50.360
 optical clock distribution is a very powerful technology.

56:51.200 --> 56:53.200
 I don't know the state of that field right now,

56:53.200 --> 56:55.640
 but I imagine that if you're trying to distribute a clock

56:55.640 --> 56:59.000
 across any appreciable size computational system,

56:59.000 --> 57:00.360
 you want to use light.

57:00.360 --> 57:04.320
 Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work,

57:04.320 --> 57:07.400
 especially like supercomputers.

57:07.400 --> 57:09.400
 Do they need to do clock distribution?

57:09.400 --> 57:14.400
 Or are they doing more ad hoc parallel

57:14.440 --> 57:15.560
 concurrent programming?

57:15.560 --> 57:18.160
 Like there's some kind of locking mechanisms or something.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.320
 That's a fascinating question,

57:19.320 --> 57:23.920
 but let's zoom in at this very particular question

57:23.920 --> 57:28.200
 of computation on a processor

57:28.200 --> 57:31.560
 and communication between processors.

57:31.560 --> 57:36.440
 So what does this system look like?

57:36.440 --> 57:38.440
 That you're envisioning,

57:38.440 --> 57:40.080
 one of the places you're envisioning it

57:40.080 --> 57:43.120
 is in the paper on optoelectronic intelligence.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.760
 So what are we talking about?

57:44.760 --> 57:46.280
 Are we talking about something

57:46.280 --> 57:48.720
 that starts to look a lot like the human brain?

57:48.720 --> 57:51.320
 Or does it still look a lot like a computer?

57:51.320 --> 57:52.960
 What are the size of this thing?

57:52.960 --> 57:54.400
 Is it go inside a smartphone?

57:54.400 --> 57:55.960
 Or as you said, does it go inside

57:55.960 --> 57:58.520
 something that's more like a house?

57:58.520 --> 58:01.120
 Like what should we be imagining?

58:01.120 --> 58:02.200
 What are you thinking about

58:02.200 --> 58:05.400
 when you're thinking about these fundamental systems?

58:05.400 --> 58:07.320
 Let me introduce the word neuromorphic.

58:07.320 --> 58:09.880
 There's this concept of neuromorphic computing

58:09.880 --> 58:12.520
 where what that broadly refers to

58:12.520 --> 58:15.840
 is computing based

58:15.840 --> 58:19.200
 on the information processing principles of the brain.

58:19.200 --> 58:24.120
 And as digital computing seems to be pushing towards

58:24.120 --> 58:26.440
 some fundamental performance limits,

58:26.440 --> 58:29.160
 people are considering architectural advances,

58:29.160 --> 58:30.840
 drawing inspiration from the brain,

58:30.840 --> 58:33.640
 more distributed parallel network kind of architectures

58:33.640 --> 58:34.480
 and stuff.

58:34.480 --> 58:37.440
 And so there's this continuum of neuromorphic

58:37.440 --> 58:42.440
 from things that are pretty similar to digital computers,

58:42.760 --> 58:45.720
 but maybe there are more cores

58:45.720 --> 58:49.160
 and the way they send messages is a little bit more

58:49.160 --> 58:52.800
 like the way brain neurons send spikes.

58:52.800 --> 58:56.120
 But for the most part, it's still digital electronics.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.720
 And then you have some things in between

58:58.720 --> 59:02.080
 where maybe you're using transistors,

59:02.080 --> 59:03.240
 but now you're starting to use them

59:03.240 --> 59:06.120
 instead of in a digital way, in an analog way.

59:06.120 --> 59:08.160
 And so you're trying to get those circuits

59:08.160 --> 59:10.320
 to behave more like neurons.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.160
 And then that's a little bit,

59:12.160 --> 59:14.960
 quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things.

59:14.960 --> 59:17.080
 You're trying to get your circuits,

59:17.080 --> 59:19.160
 although they're still based on silicon,

59:19.160 --> 59:22.480
 you're trying to get them to perform operations

59:22.480 --> 59:24.680
 that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain.

59:24.680 --> 59:26.720
 That's where a great deal of work is

59:26.720 --> 59:29.200
 in neuromorphic computing people like Yakumo Indiveri

59:29.200 --> 59:32.960
 and Gerr Cowenbergs, Jennifer Hasler, countless others.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.560
 It's a rich and exciting field,

59:35.560 --> 59:39.480
 going back to Carver Mead in the late 1980s.

59:39.480 --> 59:44.240
 And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum

59:44.240 --> 59:48.600
 is where you say, I'll give up anything related

59:48.600 --> 59:51.400
 to transistors or semiconductors or anything like that.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.600
 I'm not starting with the assumption

59:53.600 --> 59:55.160
 that I'm gonna use any kind of

59:55.160 --> 59:57.280
 conventional computing hardware.

59:57.280 --> 59:59.320
 And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand

59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.680
 what makes the brain powerful

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:03.200
 at the kind of information processing it does.

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:05.520
 And I wanna think from first principles

1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:10.560
 about what hardware is best going to enable us

1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:14.000
 to capture those information processing principles

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000
 in an artificial system.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:17.400
 And that's where I live.

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:21.720
 That's where I'm doing my exploration these days.

1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:25.760
 So what are the first principles

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:29.920
 of brain like computation and communication?

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:32.560
 Right, yeah, this is so important.

1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:35.520
 And I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this because...

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:37.200
 I only have 13, I'm sorry.

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:41.480
 Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated.

1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:46.280
 And I think that's an important part of why it can do what it does.

1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:48.680
 But okay, let me try to break it down.

1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:54.600
 Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before,

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:57.080
 they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:58.200
 and synapses are too.

1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:03.040
 They can change their state based on the activity

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:04.880
 so they adapt over time.

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:06.960
 That's crucial to the way the brain works.

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:09.360
 They don't just adapt on one time scale,

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:12.440
 they can adapt on myriad time scales

1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.040
 from the spacing between pulses,

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.680
 the spacing between spikes that come from neurons

1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:21.520
 all the way to the age of the organism.

1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:26.240
 Also relevant, perhaps,

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:29.200
 I think the most important thing that's guided my thinking

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:33.000
 is the network structure of the brain.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:33.840
 So...

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:36.320
 Which can also be adjusted on different scales.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.160
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:41.320
 Yeah, so you're changing the strength of contacts,

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:44.080
 you're changing the spatial distribution of them.

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:46.880
 Although spatial distribution doesn't change that much

1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:49.400
 once you're a mature organism,

1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:52.880
 but that network structure is really crucial.

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:55.400
 So let me dwell on that for a second.

1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:59.360
 You can't talk about the brain without emphasizing that

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:02.840
 most of the neurons in the neocortex

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:04.080
 or the prefrontal cortex,

1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:06.280
 the part of the brain that we think is most responsible

1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.080
 for high level reasoning and things like that,

1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.360
 those neurons make thousands of connections.

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:15.600
 So you have this network that is highly interconnected.

1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:19.920
 And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons

1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:23.200
 that they make so many different connections

1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:26.920
 is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly

1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:28.440
 from any spot in the network

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:30.360
 to any other spot in the network.

1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:33.960
 So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it.

1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:38.520
 You can quantify this in terms of concepts

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:41.040
 that are related to fractals and scale invariance,

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.280
 which I think is a very beautiful concept.

1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:46.240
 So what I mean by that is kind of,

1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:50.760
 no matter what spatial scale you're looking at in the brain,

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.360
 within certain bounds,

1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:55.000
 you see the same general statistical pattern.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.640
 So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex,

1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:02.320
 most of the connections that those neurons

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:04.520
 within that box make are gonna be within the box

1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.240
 to each other in their local neighborhood.

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:09.320
 And that's sort of called clustering, loosely speaking.

1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.640
 But a non negligible fraction is gonna go outside of that box.

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:14.120
 And then if I draw a bigger box,

1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:16.440
 the pattern is gonna be exactly the same.

1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:18.440
 So you have this scale invariance,

1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:22.720
 and you also have a non vanishing probability

1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:25.400
 of a neuron making connection very far away.

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:28.720
 So suppose you wanna plot the probability

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.440
 of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance.

1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:34.240
 If that weren't exponential function,

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.720
 it would go E to the minus radius

1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:38.720
 over some characteristic radius,

1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:41.840
 and it would drop off up to some certain radius.

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.920
 The probability would be reasonable close to one.

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:49.120
 And then beyond that characteristic length R zero,

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.320
 it would drop off sharply.

1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:53.560
 And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:56.320
 are really localized.

1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:58.640
 And that's not what we observe.

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.680
 And instead, what you see is that the probability

1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:02.720
 of making a longer distance connection,

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.840
 it does drop off, but it drops off as a power loss.

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:08.440
 So the probability that you're gonna have a connection

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:13.200
 at some radius R goes as R to the minus some power.

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:16.800
 And that's what we see with forces in nature,

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:19.400
 like the electromagnetic force between two particles

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:23.000
 or gravity goes as one over the radius squared.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:23.840
 So...

1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:24.680
 You can see this in fractals.

1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:28.600
 I love that there's like a fractal dynamics of the brain.

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.440
 That if you zoom out, you draw the box

1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.040
 and you increase that box by certain step sizes,

1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:36.720
 you're gonna see the same statistics.

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.000
 I think that's probably very important

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.880
 to the way the brain processes information.

1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.600
 It's not just in the spatial domain,

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:45.640
 it's also in the temporal domain.

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:47.200
 And what I mean by that is...

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.600
 That's incredible that this emerged

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:52.320
 through the evolutionary process

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.880
 that potentially somehow connected

1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:57.800
 to the way the physics of the universe works.

1:04:57.800 --> 1:04:59.360
 Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:01.440
 That it's a deep and fascinating subject

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:04.160
 that I hope to be able to spend the rest of my life studying.

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:07.320
 Do you think you need to solve, understand this,

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:09.520
 this fractal nature in order to understand

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:10.760
 intelligence and communication?

1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:11.600
 I do think so.

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:13.360
 I think they're deeply intertwined.

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:16.920
 Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it.

1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:19.360
 So just to push that one through,

1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:21.520
 the same thing happens in the temporal domain.

1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:23.200
 So suppose you had...

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.040
 Suppose your neurons in your brain

1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:28.200
 were always oscillating at the same frequency.

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:30.760
 Then the probability of finding a neuron

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.560
 oscillating as a function of frequency

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:34.560
 would be this narrowly peaked function

1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:36.560
 around that certain characteristic frequency.

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:37.920
 That's not at all what we see.

1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:40.280
 The probability of finding neurons oscillating

1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:43.920
 or pulsing, producing spikes at a certain frequency

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:45.240
 is again a power law,

1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:49.680
 which means there's no defined scale

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.720
 of the temporal activity in the brain.

1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:56.080
 At what speed do your thoughts occur?

1:05:56.080 --> 1:05:58.320
 Well, there's a fastest speed they can occur,

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:01.520
 and that is limited by communication and other things,

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.960
 but there's not a characteristic scale.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:06.920
 We have thoughts on all temporal scales

1:06:06.920 --> 1:06:10.840
 from a few tens of milliseconds,

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:13.400
 which is physiologically limited by our devices,

1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.760
 compare that to tens of picoseconds

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:17.160
 that I talked about in superconductors,

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:19.280
 all the way up to the lifetime of the organism.

1:06:19.280 --> 1:06:20.760
 You can still think about things

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.600
 that happened to you when you were a kid.

1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:24.120
 Well, if you want to be really trippy

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:25.880
 then across multiple organisms

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:27.480
 in the entirety of human civilization,

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:29.440
 you have thoughts that span organisms, right?

1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:31.240
 Yes, taking it to that level.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:34.680
 If you're willing to see the entirety of the human species

1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:37.240
 as a single organism with a collective intelligence,

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.960
 then that too on a spatial and temporal scale,

1:06:39.960 --> 1:06:41.160
 there's thoughts occurring.

1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:44.080
 And then if you look at not just the human species,

1:06:44.080 --> 1:06:46.560
 but the entirety of life on earth

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:49.680
 as an organism with thoughts that are occurring

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:51.680
 that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts,

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:54.720
 there's a different spatial and temporal scale there.

1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:57.280
 This is getting very suspicious.

1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:58.120
 Well, hold on though.

1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:01.040
 Before we're done, I just want to just tie the bow

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:04.360
 and say that the spatial and temporal aspects

1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:06.520
 are intimately interrelated with each other.

1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:09.880
 So activity between neurons that are very close

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:11.560
 to each other is more likely to happen

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.640
 on this faster time scale.

1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:15.360
 And information is going to propagate

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:17.280
 and encompass more of the brain,

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:20.320
 more of your cortices, different modules in the brain

1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:23.800
 are going to be engaged in information processing

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:25.320
 on longer time scale.

1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:28.000
 So there's this concept of information integration

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:32.000
 where most neurons are specialized.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.040
 Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron

1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:35.800
 has its specific purpose,

1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:39.960
 but they're also very much integrated.

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:41.960
 So you have neurons that specialize,

1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:43.720
 but share their information.

1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:47.640
 And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations

1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:49.480
 that occur across spatial and temporal scales.

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:53.720
 I think capturing those dynamics in hardware,

1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:57.120
 to me, that's the goal of neuromorphic computing.

1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:58.720
 So does it need to look...

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.880
 So first of all, that's fascinating.

1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:04.000
 We stated some clear principles here.

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:08.160
 Now, does it have to look like the brain

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:09.840
 outside of those principles as well?

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:11.360
 Like what other characteristics

1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:13.120
 have to look like the human brain?

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:15.880
 Or can it be something very different?

1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:18.040
 Well, it depends on what you're trying to use it for.

1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:20.760
 And so I think a lot of the community

1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:23.120
 asks that question a lot.

1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:24.400
 What are you going to do with it?

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:26.640
 And I completely get it.

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:28.040
 I think that's a very important question.

1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:31.880
 And it's also sometimes not the most helpful question.

1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:33.800
 What if what you want to do with it is study it?

1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.200
 What if you just want to see...

1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:39.280
 What do you have to build into your hardware

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:42.240
 in order to observe these dynamical principles?

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:43.240
 So...

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:45.640
 And also, I ask sometimes...

1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:47.560
 I ask myself that question every day,

1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:49.880
 and I'm not sure I'm able to answer that.

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.240
 It's like, what are you going to do

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.520
 with this particular neuromorphic machine?

1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:55.360
 So suppose what we're trying to do with it

1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:57.000
 is build something that thinks.

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.160
 We're not trying to get it to make us any money

1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:00.240
 or drive a car.

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:01.680
 Maybe we'll be able to do that.

1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:02.640
 But that's not our goal.

1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:06.280
 Our goal is to see if we can get the same types

1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:08.920
 of behaviors that we observe in our own brain.

1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:10.480
 And by behaviors, in this sense,

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.320
 what I mean the behaviors of the components,

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:16.000
 the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.440
 I think there's another element

1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:19.120
 that I didn't really hit on

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:21.200
 that you also have to build into this.

1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:22.920
 And those are architectural principles.

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:26.640
 They have to do with the hierarchical modular construction

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:27.480
 of the network.

1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:30.200
 And without getting too lost and jargon,

1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:33.680
 the main point that I think is relevant there,

1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:35.720
 let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:38.200
 of the architecture of the brain.

1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:41.120
 So in the brain, you have the cortex,

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.560
 which is sort of this outer sheet.

1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:47.160
 It's a layered structure.

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:48.480
 If you could take it out of your brain,

1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:50.680
 you could unroll it on the table,

1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:52.840
 and it would be about the size of a pizza.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:53.680
 Sitting there.

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:57.320
 And that's a module.

1:09:57.320 --> 1:09:58.720
 It does certain things.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.720
 It processes as Yorgi Buzaki would say,

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:04.480
 it processes the what of what's going on around you.

1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:07.200
 But you have another really crucial module

1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:09.000
 that's called the hippocampus.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.480
 And that network is structured entirely differently.

1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:12.920
 First of all, this cortex

1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:15.600
 that I described, 10 billion neurons in there.

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.840
 So numbers matter here.

1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:21.400
 And they're organized in that sort of power law distribution

1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.240
 where the probability of making a connection

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:25.320
 drops off as a power law in space.

1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:27.000
 The hippocampus is another module

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.280
 that's important for understanding how,

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:33.040
 where you are, when you are,

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:38.000
 keeping track of your position in space and time.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.040
 And that network is very much random.

1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:42.800
 So the probability of making a connection,

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:45.560
 it almost doesn't even drop off as a function of distance.

1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:46.680
 It's the same probability

1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:48.480
 that you'll make it here to over there.

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:51.480
 But there are only about a hundred million neurons there.

1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.160
 So you can have that huge, densely connected module

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.760
 because it's not so big.

1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:02.520
 And the neocortex or the cortex and the hippocampus,

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:05.400
 they talk to each other constantly.

1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:08.400
 And that communication is largely facilitated

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:10.200
 by what's called the thalamus.

1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:11.360
 I'm not a neuroscientist here.

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:13.520
 I'm trying to do my best to recite things.

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:15.160
 Cartoon picture of the brain, I gotcha.

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:16.040
 Yeah, something like that.

1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:19.120
 So this thalamus is coordinating the activity

1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:21.200
 between the neocortex and the hippocampus

1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:24.040
 and making sure that they talk to each other

1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:25.760
 at the right time and send messages

1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:27.320
 that will be useful to one another.

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:29.120
 So this all taken together

1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:32.080
 is called the thalamocortical complex.

1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:35.360
 And it seems like building something like that

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.440
 is going to be crucial

1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:40.560
 to capturing the types of activity we're looking for

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:45.320
 because those responsibilities, those separate modules,

1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:46.200
 they do different things.

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:51.200
 That's got to be central to achieving these states

1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:56.200
 of efficient information integration across space and time.

1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:59.440
 By the way, I am able to achieve this state

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:02.320
 by watching simulations, visualizations

1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:04.280
 of the thalamocortical complex.

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:06.960
 There's a few people I forget from where

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:10.400
 they've created these incredible visual illustrations

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:15.200
 of like visual stimulation from the eye or something like that.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:18.520
 And this image flowing through the brain.

1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:20.040
 Wow, I haven't seen that.

1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:20.880
 I got to check that out.

1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:22.120
 So it's one of those things,

1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.280
 you find this stuff in the world

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:25.440
 and you see like I need to,

1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:26.960
 but it has like 1000 views.

1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.800
 These visualizations of the human brain

1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:32.200
 processing information.

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:36.440
 And like, because there's chemistry there,

1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.880
 because this is from actual human brains,

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.720
 I don't know how they're doing the coloring,

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:44.440
 but they're able to actually trace the different,

1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:46.680
 the chemical and the electrical signals

1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:48.880
 throughout the brain and the visual thing.

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:51.800
 It's like, whoa, because it looks kind of like the universe.

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:53.800
 I mean, the whole thing is just incredible.

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:55.080
 I recommend it highly.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:56.640
 I'll probably post a link to it,

1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.960
 but you can just look for one of the things they simulate

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.840
 is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization.

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.520
 You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it's beautiful.

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:13.560
 The other question I have for you is how does memory

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:14.440
 play into all of this?

1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:17.120
 Because all the signals sending back and forth,

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:20.880
 that's kind of like, that's computation and communication,

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:25.000
 but that's kind of like processing of inputs

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.560
 and outputs to produce outputs in the system.

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.000
 That's kind of like maybe reasoning,

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.920
 maybe there's some kind of recurrence,

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:33.160
 but like, is there a storage mechanism

1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:34.600
 that you think about in the context

1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:35.840
 of neuromorphic computing?

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:36.680
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:37.760
 So that's got to be central.

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.520
 You have to have a way that you can store memories

1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:44.720
 and there are a lot of different kinds of memory

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:45.480
 in the brain.

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.160
 That's yet another example of how it's not a simple system.

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:53.440
 So there's one kind of memory, one way

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:57.320
 of talking about memory usually starts

1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:59.040
 in the context of Hopfield Networks.

1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.440
 You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program,

1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:05.840
 but the basic idea there is working memory

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:09.120
 is stored in the dynamical patterns of activity

1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:12.200
 between neurons and you can think

1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:16.040
 of a certain pattern of activity as an attractor,

1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:21.040
 meaning if you put in some signal that's similar enough

1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:26.040
 to other previously experienced signals like that,

1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:29.560
 then you're going to converge to the same network dynamics

1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:34.560
 and you will see these neurons participate

1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:36.200
 in the same network patterns of activity

1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.600
 that they have in the past.

1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:39.720
 So you can talk about the probability

1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:42.480
 that different inputs will allow you to converge

1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.200
 to different basins of attraction

1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:46.560
 and you might think of that as,

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:49.880
 oh, I saw this face and then I excited this network pattern

1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:53.040
 of activity because last time I saw that face,

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:55.520
 I was at, you know, some movie

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.480
 and that's a famous person is on the screen

1:14:57.480 --> 1:14:58.320
 or something like that.

1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:00.520
 So that's one memory storage mechanism,

1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:04.400
 but crucial to the ability to imprint those memories

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:08.560
 in your brain is the ability to change the strength

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:11.360
 of connection between one neuron and another,

1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:13.280
 that synaptic connection between them.

1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:16.600
 So synaptic weight update is a massive field

1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:19.560
 of neuroscience and neuromorphic computing as well.

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:24.560
 So there are two poles to that on that spectrum one.

1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:28.880
 Okay, so in more in the language of machine learning,

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.000
 we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.520
 in when I'm trying to tie that down to neuromorphic computing,

1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.440
 I will use a definition of supervised learning,

1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:43.000
 which basically means the external user,

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.520
 the person who's controlling this hardware

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:48.360
 has some knob that they can tune

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.440
 to change each of the synaptic weights

1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:52.440
 depending on whether or not the network's doing

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:53.560
 what you want it to do.

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:56.160
 Whereas what I mean in this conversation

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:58.360
 when I say unsupervised learning is that

1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:02.320
 those synaptic weights are dynamically changing

1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:05.000
 in your network based on nothing that the user is doing,

1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.080
 nothing that there's no wire from the outside

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:09.040
 going into any of those synapses.

1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:12.080
 The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:15.760
 based on physical properties

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.600
 that you've built into the devices.

1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:21.400
 So if the synapse receives a pulse from here

1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:23.360
 and that causes the neuron to spike,

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:27.040
 some circuit built in there with no help from me

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:29.800
 or anybody else adjust the weight in a way

1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:34.600
 that makes it more likely to store the useful information

1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:36.400
 and excite the useful network patterns

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.360
 and makes it less likely that random noise,

1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:41.920
 useless communication events will have

1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:45.320
 an important effect on the network activity.

1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:48.280
 So there's memory encoded in the weights,

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:49.760
 the synaptic weights.

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.880
 What about the formation of something

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.680
 that's not often done in machine learning,

1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:56.280
 the formation of new synaptic connections?

1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:57.440
 Right, well that seems to,

1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.120
 so again, not a neuroscientist here,

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:02.160
 but my reading of the literature is that

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:05.000
 that's particularly crucial in early stages

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.120
 of brain development where a newborn is born

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:11.680
 with tons of extra synaptic connections

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.880
 and it's actually pruned over time.

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:16.800
 So the number of synapses decreases

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:19.680
 as opposed to growing new long distance connections.

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.280
 It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons

1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:26.080
 and assign new synaptic connections,

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:29.120
 but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism

1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:31.840
 by which the brain is learning.

1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:35.720
 So for example, like right now, sitting here talking to you,

1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:37.000
 you say lots of interesting things

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.520
 and I learn from you and I can remember things

1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:41.360
 that you just said,

1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:44.720
 and I didn't grow new axonal connections

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.360
 down to new synapses to enable those.

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:52.160
 It's plasticity mechanisms in the synaptic connections

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:55.960
 between neurons that enable me to learn on that time scale.

1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:59.400
 So at the very least that you can sufficiently approximate

1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:01.360
 that with just weight updates,

1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:03.000
 you don't need to form new connections.

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.080
 I would say weight updates are a big part of it.

1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:08.640
 I also think there's more because broadly speaking,

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.440
 when we're doing machine learning,

1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:12.480
 our networks say we're talking about feed forward,

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:15.800
 deep neural networks, the temporal domain

1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:16.920
 is not really part of it.

1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:18.200
 Okay, you're gonna put in an image

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:20.400
 and you're gonna get out a classification

1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:22.000
 and you're gonna do that as fast as possible.

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.200
 So you care about time,

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:26.640
 but time is not part of the essence of this thing really.

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:30.040
 Whereas in spiking neural networks,

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:31.760
 what we see in the brain,

1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:34.600
 time is as crucial a space in their intimately intertwined

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:36.000
 as I've tried to say.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.000
 And so adaptation on different time scales is important,

1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:44.120
 not just in memory formation,

1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:45.360
 although it plays a key role there,

1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:48.240
 but also in just keeping the activity

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.320
 in a useful dynamic range.

1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:52.520
 So you have other plasticity mechanisms,

1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:54.240
 not just weight update,

1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:56.800
 or at least not on the time scale

1:18:56.800 --> 1:18:58.760
 of many action potentials,

1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:00.200
 but even on the shorter time scale.

1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.720
 So a synapse can become much less efficacious.

1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:07.240
 It can transmit a weaker signal

1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:08.680
 after the second, third, fourth,

1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:12.000
 that can second, third, fourth action potential

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.080
 to occur in a sequence.

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:15.960
 So that's what's called short term synaptic plasticity,

1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:17.600
 which is a form of learning.

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.640
 You're learning that I'm getting too much stimulus

1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:21.680
 from looking at something bright right now.

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:23.840
 So I need to tone that down, you know?

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:28.080
 There's also another really important mechanism

1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:30.520
 in learning, it's called meta plasticity.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:35.360
 What that seems to be is a way that you change

1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:37.440
 not the weights themselves,

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:40.320
 but the rate at which the weights change.

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:44.640
 So when I am in, say, a lecture hall,

1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:48.400
 and my, this is a potentially terrible cartoon example,

1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:49.680
 well, let's say I'm in a lecture hall,

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.960
 and it's time to learn, right?

1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:55.280
 So my brain will release more perhaps dopamine

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:58.360
 or some neuromodulator that's gonna change

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.240
 the rate at which synaptic plasticity occurs.

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:04.240
 So that can make me more sensitive to learning

1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:06.880
 at certain times, more sensitive to overriding

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:10.400
 previous information, and less sensitive at other times.

1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:13.200
 And finally, as long as I'm rattling off the list,

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:16.480
 I think another concept that falls in the category

1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:20.560
 of learning or memory adaptation is homeostasis

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:24.960
 or homeostatic adaptation where neurons have the ability

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:27.800
 to control their firing rate.

1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:31.200
 So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much,

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.040
 it will naturally tone itself down.

1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:37.440
 Its threshold will adjust so that it stays

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:38.520
 in a useful dynamical range.

1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:41.720
 And we see that that's captured in deep neural networks

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:43.360
 where you don't just change the synaptic weights,

1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:46.680
 but you can also move the thresholds of simple neurons

1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:47.640
 in those models.

1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:52.640
 And so to achieve the spiking neural networks,

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:56.440
 you want to use, like,

1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:01.240
 you want to implement the first principles

1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:03.400
 that you mentioned of the temporal

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.040
 and the spatial fractal dynamics here.

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:08.800
 So you can communicate,

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.320
 locally you can communicate across much greater distances

1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.000
 and do the same thing in space

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000
 and do the same thing in time.

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.000
 Now, you have a chapter called

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.360
 Superconducting Hardware for Neuromorphic Computing.

1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:27.760
 So what are some ideas that integrate

1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:29.080
 some of the things we've been talking about

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:30.440
 in terms of the first principles

1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:32.080
 of neuromorphic computing

1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:34.280
 and the ideas that you outline

1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:38.040
 in optoelectronic intelligence?

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.920
 Yeah, so let me start, I guess,

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:42.520
 on the communication side of things

1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:46.280
 because that's what led us down this track

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.120
 in the first place.

1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:50.840
 By us, I'm talking about my team of colleagues

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:54.040
 at NIST, you know, Saeed Han, Bryce Primavera,

1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:56.520
 Sonia Buckley, Jeff Chiles, Adam McCon,

1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:58.720
 to name Alex Tate, to name a few,

1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:01.240
 our group leaders, Seyhu Nam and Rich Mirren.

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.480
 We've all contributed to this.

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:06.520
 So this is not me saying necessarily just the things

1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:07.560
 that I've proposed,

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:09.560
 but sort of where our team's thinking

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:11.560
 has evolved over the years.

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.680
 Can I quickly ask, what is NIST

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:18.040
 and where is this amazing group of people located?

1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:21.640
 NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:26.640
 The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:29.720
 Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado.

1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:34.640
 We, NIST is a federal agency

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.200
 under the Department of Commerce.

1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:40.160
 We do a lot with, by we, I mean, other people at NIST,

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.640
 do a lot with standards, you know,

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.120
 making sure that we understand the system of units,

1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:49.320
 international system of units, precision measurements.

1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:53.560
 There's a lot going on in electrical engineering,

1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:54.760
 material science.

1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:55.720
 And it's historic.

1:22:55.720 --> 1:22:57.560
 I mean, it's like, it's one of those,

1:22:57.560 --> 1:22:59.040
 it's like MIT or something like that.

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:00.960
 It has a reputation over many decades

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:04.240
 of just being this really a place

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:05.640
 where there's a lot of brilliant people

1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:07.600
 who have done a lot of amazing things.

1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:10.600
 But in terms of the people in your team,

1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:12.760
 in this team of people involved

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.600
 in the concept we're talking about now,

1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:15.440
 I'm just curious,

1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:17.240
 what kind of disciplines are we talking about?

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.080
 What is it?

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.240
 Mostly physicists and electrical engineers,

1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:21.880
 some material scientists.

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.080
 But I would say, yeah,

1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:27.240
 I think physicists and electrical engineers,

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:29.480
 my background is in photonics,

1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:31.040
 the use of light for technology.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.360
 So coming from there,

1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:36.840
 I tend to have found colleagues

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.240
 that are more from that background.

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.240
 Although Adam McCann,

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:42.720
 more of a superconducting electronics background,

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.280
 we need a diversity of folks.

1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:46.840
 This project is sort of cross disciplinary.

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:48.280
 I would love to be working more

1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:50.760
 with neuroscientists and things,

1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:53.880
 but we haven't reached that scale yet.

1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:54.720
 But yeah.

1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:56.480
 You're focused on the hardware side,

1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:59.160
 which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned.

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:00.000
 And then of course,

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.120
 neuroscience may be a source of inspiration

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.360
 for some of the longterm vision.

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:06.240
 I would actually call it more than inspiration.

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:11.120
 I would call it sort of a road map.

1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:15.000
 We're not trying to build exactly the brain,

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.480
 but I don't think it's enough to just say,

1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:19.240
 oh, neurons kind of work like that.

1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:20.760
 Let's kind of do that thing.

1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.360
 I mean, we're very much following the concepts

1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.440
 that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us,

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:30.520
 which I believe is a really robust roadmap.

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:33.080
 I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent,

1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:36.120
 it's often stated that we just don't understand the brain

1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:37.960
 and so it's really hard to replicate it

1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:40.200
 because we just don't know what's going on there.

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:44.800
 And maybe five or seven years ago, I would have said that,

1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:47.880
 but as I got more interested in the subject,

1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:50.480
 I had read more of the neuroscience literature

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:53.640
 and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense.

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:55.880
 I can't believe how much they know about this.

1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:59.280
 I can't believe how mathematically rigorous

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:04.200
 and sort of theoretically complete a lot of the concepts are.

1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:06.640
 That's not to say we understand consciousness

1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:08.520
 or we understand the self or anything like that,

1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:11.000
 but what is the brain doing

1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.960
 and why is it doing those things?

1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:15.960
 Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions.

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:17.800
 So there's a lot, if you're a hardware designer

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:19.400
 that just wants to get going,

1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:22.960
 whoa, it's pretty clear which direction to go in, I think.

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:27.960
 Okay, so I love the optimism behind that,

1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:31.080
 but any implementation of these systems

1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:36.080
 that uses superconductivity, how do you make it happen?

1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.880
 So to me, it starts with thinking

1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:43.400
 about the communication network.

1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:47.560
 You know for sure that the ability of each neuron

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:50.560
 to communicate to many thousands of colleagues

1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:52.360
 across the network is indispensable.

1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.280
 I take that as a core principle of my architecture,

1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:57.640
 my thinking on the subject.

1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:02.280
 So coming from a background in photonics,

1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.760
 it was very natural to say, okay,

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:05.360
 we're gonna use light for communication.

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.720
 Just in case listeners may not know,

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:10.840
 light is often used in communication.

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.720
 I mean, if you think about radio, that's light.

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.320
 It's long wavelengths, but it's electromagnetic radiation.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:17.600
 It's the same physical phenomenon

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:20.280
 obeying exactly the same Maxwell's equations.

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:24.920
 And then all the way down to fiber optics,

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:26.240
 now you're using visible

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.800
 or near infrared wavelengths of light,

1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:30.360
 but the way you send messages across the ocean

1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:33.200
 is now contemporary over optical fibers.

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:37.480
 So using light for communication is not a stretch.

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:38.960
 It makes perfect sense.

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.560
 So you might ask, well, why don't you use light

1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.320
 for communication in a conventional microchip?

1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:49.280
 And the answer to that is, I believe physical.

1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.120
 If we had a light source on a silicon chip

1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:55.880
 that was as simple as a transistor,

1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.200
 there would not be a processor in the world

1:26:58.200 --> 1:26:59.720
 that didn't use light for communication,

1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:01.760
 at least above some distance.

1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:04.040
 How many light sources are needed?

1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:06.800
 Oh, you need a light source at every single point.

1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:08.400
 A light source per neuron?

1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:09.920
 Per neuron, per little,

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:14.120
 but then if you could have a really small and nice light source,

1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:17.920
 your definition of neuron could be flexible.

1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:19.160
 Could be, yes, yes.

1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:21.720
 Sometimes it's helpful to me to say,

1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.560
 in this hardware, a neuron is that entity

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:26.120
 which has a light source.

1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:28.000
 And I can explain.

1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:29.560
 And then there was light.

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.280
 I mean, I can explain more about that, but...

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.680
 Somehow this rhymes with consciousness

1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:38.240
 because people will often say the light of consciousness.

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:41.680
 So that consciousness is that which is conscious.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:42.520
 I got it.

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:44.840
 That's not my quote.

1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:47.000
 That's me. That's my quote.

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.480
 See, that quote comes from my background.

1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:54.880
 Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine is in darkness.

1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:56.480
 So go ahead.

1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:59.600
 So the point I was making there is that

1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:02.960
 if it was easy to manufacture light sources

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:05.760
 along with transistors on a silicon chip,

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:07.240
 they would be everywhere.

1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:08.880
 And it's not easy.

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:10.160
 People have been trying for decades

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.960
 and it's actually extremely difficult.

1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:13.720
 I think an important part of our research

1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:17.360
 is dwelling right at that spot there.

1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:18.760
 Is it physics or engineering?

1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:19.600
 It's physics.

1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.280
 So, okay, so it's physics, I think.

1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:26.920
 So what I mean by that is as we discussed,

1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:29.400
 silicon is the material of choice for transistors

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.280
 and it's very difficult to imagine

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:35.200
 that that's gonna change anytime soon.

1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.160
 Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light

1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:43.280
 and that has to do with the immutable properties

1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:46.240
 of silicon itself, the way that the energy bands

1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:47.880
 are structured in silicon.

1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.520
 You're never going to make silicon efficient

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:53.520
 as a light source at room temperature

1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:55.640
 without doing very exotic things

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:58.320
 that degrade its ability to interface nicely

1:28:58.320 --> 1:28:59.840
 with those transistors in the first place.

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.600
 So that's like one of these things where it's,

1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:05.200
 why is nature dealing us that blow?

1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:07.000
 You give us these beautiful transistors

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.640
 and you give us all the motivation

1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.120
 to use light for communication,

1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:11.520
 but then you don't give us a light source.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:14.000
 So, well, okay, you do give us a light source,

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.360
 compound semiconductors.

1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:16.920
 Like we talked about back at the beginning,

1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:19.680
 an element from group three and an element from group five

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:21.840
 from an alloy where every other lattice site

1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:23.680
 switches which element it is.

1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:27.280
 Those have much better properties for generating light.

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:30.040
 You put electrons in, light comes out.

1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:33.160
 Almost a hundred percent of the electron hold,

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.360
 it can be made efficient.

1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:37.440
 Okay, I'll take your offer, okay.

1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:39.600
 However, I say it's physics, not engineering,

1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:43.160
 because it's very difficult to get those

1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:45.280
 compound semiconductor light sources

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:47.560
 situated with your silicon.

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:49.440
 In order to do that ion implantation

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:50.800
 that I talked about at the beginning,

1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:52.760
 high temperatures are required.

1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:55.720
 So you gotta make all of your transistors first

1:29:55.720 --> 1:29:58.600
 and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there.

1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:00.840
 You can't grow them afterwards

1:30:00.840 --> 1:30:02.400
 because that requires high temperature.

1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:04.040
 It screws up all your transistors.

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:05.840
 You try and stick them on there.

1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:08.000
 They don't have the same lattice constant.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.360
 The spacing between atoms is different enough

1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:11.680
 that it just doesn't work.

1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:14.880
 So nature does not seem to be telling us

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:17.960
 that, hey, go ahead and combine light sources

1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:19.960
 with your digital switches

1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.680
 for conventional digital computing.

1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:24.720
 And conventional digital computing

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:27.680
 will often require smaller scale, I guess,

1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:29.600
 in terms of smartphone.

1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:35.440
 So in which kind of systems does nature hint

1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:40.440
 that we can use light and photons for communication?

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:43.560
 Well, so let me just try and be clear.

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:46.840
 You can use light for communication in digital systems.

1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:50.280
 Just the light sources are not intimately integrated

1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:51.120
 with the silicon.

1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:52.640
 You manufacture all the silicon,

1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:55.280
 you have your microchip, plunk it down.

1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:57.240
 And then you manufacture your light sources,

1:30:57.240 --> 1:30:59.280
 separate chip, completely different process,

1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:01.000
 made in a different foundry,

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.760
 and then you put those together at the package level.

1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:07.920
 So now you have some, I would say,

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:10.040
 a great deal of architectural limitations

1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:15.040
 that are introduced by that sort of package level integration

1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:18.520
 as opposed to monolithic on the same chip integration,

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.120
 but it's still a very useful thing to do.

1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:23.640
 And that's where I had done some work previously

1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:24.640
 before I came to NIST.

1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:28.440
 There's a project led by Vladimir Stojanovich

1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:31.360
 that now spun out into a company called IR Labs,

1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:33.720
 led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun,

1:31:33.720 --> 1:31:35.000
 where they're doing exactly that.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.960
 So you have your light source chip,

1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:39.760
 your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing,

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:40.880
 maybe it's digital electronics,

1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:43.640
 maybe it's some other control purpose, something.

1:31:43.640 --> 1:31:47.760
 And the silicon chip drives the light source chip

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:49.760
 and modulates the intensity of the light,

1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:52.640
 so you can get data out of the package on an optical fiber.

1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:56.560
 And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth,

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.840
 as opposed to sending those signals out

1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:00.760
 over electrical lines,

1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:05.160
 but it is somewhat peculiar to my eye

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.880
 that they have to be integrated at this package level.

1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:09.760
 And those people, I mean, they're so smart.

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:12.880
 Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal.

1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:15.520
 So it's very clear that it's not just

1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:18.760
 they're making a bad choice.

1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.480
 This is what physics is telling us.

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:22.280
 It just wouldn't make any sense

1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.240
 to try to stick them together.

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:26.480
 Yeah, so even if it's difficult,

1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:30.880
 it's easier than the alternative, unfortunately.

1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:31.720
 I think so, yes.

1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:33.280
 And again, I need to go back

1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:35.080
 and make sure that I've not taken the wrong way.

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:37.960
 I'm not saying that the pursuit of integrating compound

1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:40.040
 semiconductors with silicon is fruitless

1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:41.120
 and shouldn't be pursued.

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.400
 It should, and people are doing great work.

1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:45.680
 Kai Mei Lao and John Bauer's others,

1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:48.200
 they're doing it and they're making progress.

1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:50.480
 But to my eye, it doesn't look like

1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:55.480
 that's ever going to be just the standard monolithic

1:32:57.120 --> 1:32:58.560
 light source on silicon process.

1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:00.000
 I just don't see it.

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:02.800
 Yeah, so nature kinda points the way, usually.

1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:04.080
 And if you resist nature,

1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:05.640
 you're gonna have to do a lot more work.

1:33:05.640 --> 1:33:07.680
 And it's gonna be expensive and not scalable.

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:08.520
 Got it.

1:33:08.520 --> 1:33:11.280
 Okay, so let's go far into the future.

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:14.720
 Let's imagine this gigantic neuromorphic computing system

1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:17.320
 that simulates all of our realities

1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:19.040
 that currently is Metro Matrix 4.

1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:23.160
 So this thing, this powerful computer,

1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:24.880
 how does it operate?

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:27.480
 So what are the neurons?

1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:29.000
 What is the communication?

1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:29.960
 What's your sense?

1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:34.160
 All right, so let me now, after spending 45 minutes

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:36.120
 trashing light source integration with silicon,

1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:40.080
 let me now say why I'm basing my entire life,

1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:43.640
 professional life on integrating light sources

1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:44.920
 with electronics.

1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:47.000
 I think the game is completely different

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.560
 when you're talking about superconducting electronics.

1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:54.200
 For several reasons, let me try to go through them.

1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:56.440
 One is that, as I mentioned,

1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.560
 it's difficult to integrate those compounds

1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:01.320
 and semiconductor light sources with silicon.

1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:04.840
 With silicon is a requirement that is introduced

1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:07.320
 by the fact that using semiconducting electronics.

1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:08.880
 In superconducting electronics,

1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.880
 you're still gonna start with a silicon wafer,

1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:13.080
 but it's just the bread for your sandwich

1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:13.920
 in a lot of ways.

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:15.840
 You're not using that silicon

1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:17.760
 in precisely the same way for the electronics.

1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:20.480
 You're now depositing superconducting materials

1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:21.880
 on top of that.

1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:24.560
 The prospects for integrating light sources

1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:27.440
 with that kind of an electronic process

1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:30.480
 are certainly less explored,

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:31.960
 but I think much more promising

1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:34.280
 because you don't need those light sources

1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.600
 to be intimately integrated with the transistors.

1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:37.920
 That's where the problems come up.

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:39.920
 They don't need to be lattice matched to the silicon,

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.160
 all that kind of stuff.

1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.640
 Instead, it seems possible

1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:45.080
 that you can take those compounds,

1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:47.320
 semiconductor light sources,

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:49.160
 stick them on the silicon wafer,

1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:51.400
 and then grow your superconducting electronics

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:52.320
 on the top of that.

1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:55.800
 It's at least not obviously going to fail.

1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:57.320
 So the computation would be done

1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:00.160
 on the superconductive material as well?

1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:01.960
 Yes, the computation is done

1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:03.960
 in the superconducting electronics,

1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:06.440
 and the light sources receive signals

1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:08.240
 that say, hey, a neuron reach threshold,

1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:09.840
 produce a pulse of light,

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:12.520
 send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections.

1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:16.280
 Those are again superconducting electronics,

1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:18.040
 perform your computation,

1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:19.680
 and you're off to the races.

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:20.800
 Your network works.

1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:22.640
 So then if we can rewind real quick.

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.000
 So what are the limitations of the challenges

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.960
 of superconducting electronics

1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:31.520
 when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.680
 So actually, let me say one other thing

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:37.600
 about the light sources,

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.880
 and then I'll move on, I promise,

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:42.360
 because this is probably tedious for some.

1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:44.040
 This is super exciting.

1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:45.760
 Okay, one other thing about the light sources,

1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:48.920
 I said that silicon is terrible at emitting photons.

1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:50.680
 It's just not what it's meant to do.

1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:52.840
 However, the game is different

1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:54.080
 when you're at low temperature.

1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:55.760
 If you're working with superconductors,

1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:57.000
 you have to be at low temperature

1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:58.720
 because they don't work otherwise.

1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:00.280
 When you're at four Kelvin,

1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:03.480
 silicon is not obviously a terrible light source.

1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:05.880
 It's still not as efficient as compound semiconductors,

1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.720
 but it might be good enough for this application.

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:11.360
 The final thing that I'll mention about that is, again,

1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:14.000
 leveraging superconductors, as I said,

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:15.440
 in a different context,

1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:19.560
 superconducting detectors can receive one single photon.

1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:21.280
 In that conversation, I failed to mention

1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:23.480
 that semiconductors can also receive photons.

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.640
 That's the primary mechanism by which it's done.

1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:29.200
 A camera in your phone that's receptive to visible light

1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:31.120
 is receiving photons.

1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:32.240
 It's based on silicon,

1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:34.400
 or you can make it in different semiconductors

1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:36.600
 for different wavelengths,

1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:39.640
 but it requires, on the order of a thousand,

1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:43.600
 a few thousand photons to receive a pulse.

1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:46.200
 Now, when you're using a superconducting detector,

1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:48.400
 you need one photon, exactly one.

1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:50.920
 I mean, one or more.

1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:54.880
 So the fact that your synopsis can now be based

1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:56.720
 on superconducting detectors,

1:36:56.720 --> 1:36:58.840
 instead of semiconducting detectors,

1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:00.760
 brings the light levels that are required

1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:03.200
 down by some three orders of magnitude.

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:06.560
 So now you don't need good light sources.

1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:08.840
 You can have the world's worst light sources

1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:11.880
 as long as they spit out maybe a few thousand photons

1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:13.840
 every time a neuron fires.

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:17.680
 You have the hardware principles in place

1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:19.640
 that you might be able to perform

1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:21.720
 this optoelectronic integration.

1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:23.640
 To me, optoelectronic integration is,

1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:25.040
 it's just so enticing.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.640
 We want to be able to leverage electronics

1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:30.400
 for computation, light for communication,

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:32.120
 working with silicon microelectronics

1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:35.040
 at room temperature that has been exceedingly difficult.

1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:40.040
 And I hope that when we move to the superconducting domain,

1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:41.880
 target a different application space

1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:44.960
 that is neuromorphic instead of digital,

1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:47.720
 and use superconducting detectors,

1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:50.160
 maybe optoelectronic integration comes to us.

1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:51.720
 Okay, so there's a bunch of questions.

1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:53.720
 So one is temperature.

1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:58.360
 So in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous systems,

1:37:58.360 --> 1:37:59.600
 what's the temperature?

1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:01.640
 What are some of the constraints of the operation here?

1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:03.640
 Does it all have to be at four Kelvin as well?

1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:06.880
 Four Kelvin, everything has to be at four Kelvin.

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:09.760
 Okay, so what are the other engineering challenges

1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:14.360
 of making this kind of optoelectronic systems?

1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:16.600
 Let me just dwell on that four Kelvin for a second

1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:18.320
 because some people hear four Kelvin

1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:19.280
 and they just get up and leave.

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:21.520
 They just say, I'm not doing it, you know?

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:25.400
 And to me, that's very Earth centric, species centric.

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:27.280
 We live in 300 Kelvin,

1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:29.160
 so we want our technologies to operate there too.

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:30.120
 I totally get it.

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:31.920
 Yeah, what's zero Celsius?

1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:34.560
 Zero Celsius is 273 Kelvin.

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:37.680
 So we're talking very, very cold here.

1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:38.520
 This is...

1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:39.520
 Not even Boston cold.

1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:44.320
 This is real cold, this is Siberia cold, no.

1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:45.720
 Okay, so just for reference,

1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:47.960
 the temperature of the cosmic microwave background

1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:49.440
 is about 2.7 Kelvin.

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.400
 So we're still warmer than deep space.

1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:53.240
 Good.

1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:56.560
 So that when the universe dies out,

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:57.960
 it'll be colder than 4K.

1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:59.440
 It's already colder than 4K.

1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:01.800
 In the expanses, you know,

1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:05.040
 you don't have to get that far away from the Earth

1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:08.120
 in order to drop down to not far from four Kelvin.

1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:09.400
 So what you're saying is the aliens

1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:13.320
 that live at the edge of the observable universe

1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:16.440
 are using superconductive material for their computation.

1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:17.880
 They don't have to live at the edge of the universe.

1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:21.040
 The aliens that are more advanced than us

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.040
 in their solar system are doing this in their asteroid belt.

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:27.800
 We can get to that.

1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:29.440
 Oh, because of the...

1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:31.640
 They can get that to that temperature easier there?

1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:32.480
 Sure, yeah.

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:34.120
 All you have to do is reflect the sunlight away

1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:36.040
 and you have a huge head start.

1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:37.680
 Oh, so the sun is the problem here.

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:39.480
 Like it's warm here on Earth, got it?

1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:40.320
 Yeah.

1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:42.920
 Okay, so how do we get to 4K?

1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:43.760
 What's...

1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.920
 Well, okay, so what I want to say about temperature is that

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.920
 if you can swallow that, if you can say,

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.200
 all right, I give up applications

1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.200
 that have to do with my cell phone

1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:02.040
 and the convenience of, you know, a laptop on a train

1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:04.320
 and you instead, for me,

1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.400
 I'm very much in the scientific headspace.

1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:07.960
 I'm not looking at products.

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:09.880
 I'm not looking at what this will be useful

1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.000
 to sell to consumers.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.360
 Instead, I'm thinking about scientific questions.

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:16.520
 Well, it's just not that bad to have to work at 4K.

1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:18.960
 We do it all the time in our labs at NIST.

1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:19.800
 And so does...

1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:21.400
 I mean, for reference,

1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:25.520
 the entire quantum computing sector

1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:28.640
 usually has to work at something like 100 millikelvin,

1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:29.640
 50 millikelvin.

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:31.600
 So now you're talking of another factor

1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:35.120
 of 100 even colder than that, a fraction of a degree.

1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:37.320
 And everybody seems to think quantum computing

1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:39.160
 is going to take over the world.

1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:41.600
 It's so much more expensive to have to get

1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:46.600
 that extra factor of 10 or whatever colder.

1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:48.600
 And yet it's not stopping people

1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:50.240
 from investing in that area.

1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:51.800
 And by investing, I mean,

1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:54.280
 putting their research into it as well

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:55.760
 as venture capital or whatever.

1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:56.600
 So...

1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.600
 So based on the energy of what you're commenting on,

1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.960
 I'm getting a sense that's one of the criticism

1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.720
 of this approach is 4K, 4Kelvin is a big negative.

1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:10.680
 It is the showstopper for a lot of people.

1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.920
 They just, I mean, and understandably,

1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:16.880
 I'm not saying that that's not a consideration.

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:17.840
 Of course it is.

1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:20.480
 For some, okay, so different motivations

1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:21.480
 for different people.

1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:23.040
 In the academic world,

1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:24.440
 suppose you spent your whole life

1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:26.800
 learning about silicon microelectronic circuits,

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:28.920
 you send a design to a foundry,

1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:30.560
 they send you back a chip

1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:33.040
 and you go test it at your tabletop.

1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:34.360
 And now I'm saying,

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.560
 here now learn how to use all these cryogenics

1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:38.480
 so you can do that at 4Kelvin.

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:41.240
 No, come on, man, I want to do that.

1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:42.080
 That sounds bad.

1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:44.560
 It's the old momentum, the Titanic or the turning.

1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:45.640
 Yeah, kind of.

1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:48.320
 But you're saying that's not too much of a,

1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:50.120
 when we're looking at large systems

1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:52.360
 and the gain you can potentially get from them,

1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:53.440
 that's not that much of a cost.

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:55.200
 And when you want to answer the scientific question

1:41:55.200 --> 1:41:58.160
 about what are the physical limits of cognition?

1:41:58.160 --> 1:41:59.840
 Well, the physical limits,

1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:01.480
 they don't care if you're at 4Kelvin.

1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:04.600
 If you can perform cognition at a scale,

1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:07.720
 orders of magnitude beyond any room temperature technology,

1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:10.480
 once you got to get cold to do it, you're going to do it.

1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:14.640
 And to me, that's the interesting application space.

1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:16.160
 It's not even an application space.

1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:18.960
 That's the interesting scientific paradigm.

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:22.560
 So I personally am not going to let low temperature

1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.560
 stop me from realizing a technological domain

1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:32.760
 or realm that is achieving in most ways everything else

1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:36.160
 that I'm looking for in my hardware.

1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:37.640
 So that, okay, that's a big one.

1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:40.000
 Is there other kind of engineering challenges

1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:40.840
 that you envision?

1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:41.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:43.120
 So let me take a moment here

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:46.520
 because I haven't really described what I mean by a neuron

1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:49.000
 or a network in this particular hardware.

1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.640
 Yeah, do you want to talk about loop neurons

1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.680
 and there's so many fascinating,

1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:55.960
 but you just have so many amazing papers

1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:57.720
 that people should definitely check out

1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:59.840
 and the titles alone are just killer.

1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:01.080
 So anyway, go ahead.

1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:06.040
 Right, so let me say big picture based on optics,

1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:07.720
 photonics for communication,

1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:10.120
 superconducting electronics for computation.

1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:11.520
 How does this all work?

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.520
 So a neuron in this hardware platform can be thought of

1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:21.080
 as circuits that are based on Joseph's injunctions

1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:22.720
 like we talked about before,

1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:25.320
 where every time a photon comes in,

1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:27.120
 so let's start by talking about a synapse.

1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:29.680
 A synapse receives a photon one or more

1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:31.400
 from a different neuron

1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:35.360
 and it converts that optical signal to an electrical signal.

1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:38.960
 The amount of current that that adds to a loop

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:40.840
 is controlled by the synaptic weight.

1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:42.360
 So as I said before,

1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.520
 you're popping fluxons into a loop, right?

1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:46.440
 So a photon comes in,

1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:49.200
 it hits a superconducting single photon detector,

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:52.120
 one photon, the absolute physical minimum

1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:53.040
 that you can communicate

1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:54.520
 from one place to another with light.

1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:57.360
 And that detector then converts that into an electrical signal

1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:00.000
 and the amount of signal is correlated

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:01.200
 with some kind of weight.

1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:02.920
 Yeah, so the synaptic weight will tell you

1:44:02.920 --> 1:44:05.480
 how many fluxons you pop into the loop.

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:06.600
 It's an analog number.

1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:08.200
 We're doing analog computation now.

1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:09.800
 Well, can you just linger on that?

1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:11.040
 What the heck is a fluxon?

1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:12.000
 Are we supposed to know this?

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.640
 Or is this a funny, it's like the big bang.

1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:18.880
 Is this a funny word for something deeply technical?

1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:21.080
 No, let's try to avoid using the word fluxon

1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:23.000
 because it's not actually necessary.

1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:24.480
 When a photon...

1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:25.600
 It's fun to say though.

1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:29.080
 So it's very necessary, I would say.

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.280
 When a photon hits that superconducting

1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:32.960
 single photon detector,

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:36.600
 current is added to a superconducting loop.

1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.240
 And the amount of current that you add

1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:40.360
 is an analog value.

1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:43.000
 You can have eight bit equivalent resolution,

1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.280
 something like that.

1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:45.480
 10 bits, maybe.

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:46.960
 That's amazing, by the way.

1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:48.520
 This is starting to make a lot more sense.

1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:50.680
 When you're using superconductors for this,

1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:54.760
 the energy of that circulating current

1:44:54.760 --> 1:44:58.640
 is less than the energy of that photon.

1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:01.800
 So your energy budget is not destroyed

1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:04.040
 by doing this analog computation.

1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:07.120
 So now in the language of a neuroscientist,

1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:09.240
 you would say that's your postsynaptic signal.

1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:11.720
 You have this current being stored in a loop.

1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:13.520
 You can decide what you wanna do with it.

1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:16.200
 Most likely you're gonna have it decay exponentially.

1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:18.920
 So every single synapse is gonna have

1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:21.000
 some given time constant.

1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:25.440
 And that's determined by putting some resistor

1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:27.080
 in that superconducting loop.

1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:31.160
 So a synapse event occurs when a photon strikes a detector,

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.880
 adds current to that loop, it decays over time.

1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:35.560
 That's the postsynaptic signal.

1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:38.440
 Then you can process that in a dendritic tree.

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:41.080
 Bryce Primavera and I have a paper

1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:43.400
 that we've submitted about that

1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:45.360
 for the more neuroscience oriented people.

1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:47.080
 There's a lot of dendritic processing,

1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.440
 a lot of plasticity mechanisms you can implement

1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:51.480
 with essentially exactly the same circuits.

1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:54.440
 You have this one simple building block circuit

1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:57.240
 that you can use for a synapse, for a dendrite,

1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.320
 for the neuron cell body, for all the plasticity functions.

1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:02.360
 It's all based on the same building block,

1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:03.720
 just tweaking a couple parameters.

1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:06.040
 So this basic building block has both an optical

1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:07.240
 and an electrical component

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:11.640
 and then you just build arbitrary large systems with that.

1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:14.000
 Close, you're not at fault for thinking

1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:15.000
 that that's what I meant.

1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:18.760
 What I should say is that if you wanted to be a synapse,

1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:21.200
 you tack a detector, a superconducting detector

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:22.240
 onto the front of it.

1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:23.440
 And if you wanted to be anything else,

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:25.280
 there's no optical component.

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.800
 Got it, so at the front,

1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:32.160
 optics in the front, electrical stuff in the back.

1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:34.120
 Electrical, yeah, in the processing

1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.480
 and in the output signal that it sends

1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:39.400
 to the next stage of processing further.

1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:41.520
 So the dendritic trees is electrical?

1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:42.520
 It's all electrical.

1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:44.880
 It's all electrical in the superconducting domain

1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:48.560
 for anybody who's up on their superconducting circuits.

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.520
 It's just based on a DC squid.

1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:53.280
 The most ubiquitous, which is a circuit

1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:55.160
 composed of two Joseph's injunctions.

1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:58.720
 So it's a very bread and butter kind of thing.

1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:00.920
 And then the only place where you go beyond that

1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:03.040
 is the neuron cell body itself.

1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:05.320
 It's receiving all these electrical inputs

1:47:05.320 --> 1:47:06.840
 from the synapses or dendrites

1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:09.840
 or however you've structured that particular unique neuron.

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:12.320
 And when it reaches its threshold,

1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:14.360
 which occurs by driving a Joseph's injunction

1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:15.760
 above its critical current,

1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:17.200
 it produces a pulse of current

1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:19.480
 which starts an amplification sequence,

1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:21.400
 voltage amplification,

1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:24.480
 that produces light out of a transmitter.

1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:26.880
 So one of our colleagues, Adam McCann

1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:28.680
 and Sonya Buckley as well did a lot of work

1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:33.040
 on the light sources and the amplifiers

1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:34.680
 that drive the current

1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:37.560
 and produce sufficient voltage to drive current

1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:39.160
 through that now semi conducting part.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:41.840
 So that light source is the semi conducting part

1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:43.160
 of a neuron.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:45.640
 And that, so the neuron has reached threshold.

1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:47.680
 It produces a pulse of light.

1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:51.600
 That light then fans out across a network of wave guides

1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:54.560
 to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals

1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:57.360
 that perform this process themselves.

1:47:57.360 --> 1:47:59.920
 So it's probably worth explaining

1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:02.360
 what a network of wave guides is

1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.800
 because a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that.

1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:07.160
 Look up the papers by Jeff Childs on this one.

1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:11.400
 But basically light can be guided in a simple,

1:48:11.400 --> 1:48:14.920
 basically wire of usually an insulating material.

1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:18.280
 So silicon, silicon nitride,

1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:20.040
 different kinds of glass,

1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.440
 just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide.

1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:24.840
 That makes it a little bit big.

1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.160
 We wanna bring these down.

1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:28.040
 So we use different materials like silicon nitride,

1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:33.000
 but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material

1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.000
 that just goes and branches forms different branch points

1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.080
 that target different sub regions of the network.

1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:45.040
 You can transition between layers of these.

1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:46.320
 And now we're talking about building

1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:48.840
 in the third dimension, which is absolutely crucial.

1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.720
 So that's what waveguides are.

1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:52.080
 Yeah, that's great.

1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:54.720
 Why the third dimension is crucial?

1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:56.640
 Okay, so yes, you were talking about

1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:59.640
 what are some of the technical limitations?

1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:04.280
 One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:08.800
 is that our brains are miraculously compact.

1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:11.560
 For the number of neurons that are in our brain,

1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:13.480
 it sure does fit in a small volume,

1:49:13.480 --> 1:49:16.160
 as it would have to if we're gonna be biological organisms

1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.200
 that are resource limited and things like that.

1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:22.040
 Any kind of hardware neuron is almost certainly

1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:23.400
 gonna be much bigger than that

1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.120
 if it is of comparable complexity.

1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:28.480
 Even whether it's based on silicon transistors,

1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:30.680
 okay, a transistor, seven nanometers,

1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:33.680
 that doesn't mean a semiconductor based neuron

1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:35.480
 is seven nanometers, they're big.

1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:38.720
 They require many transistors,

1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:40.240
 different other things like capacitors

1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:41.560
 and things that store charge.

1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:44.640
 They end up being on the order of 100 microns

1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:46.760
 by 100 microns and it's difficult

1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:48.240
 to get them down any smaller than that.

1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:50.840
 The same is true for superconducting neurons

1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:52.080
 and the same is true

1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:54.000
 if we're trying to use light for communication.

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.880
 Even if you're using electrons for communication,

1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:00.680
 you have these wires where, okay,

1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:03.360
 the size of an electron might be angstroms,

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:05.560
 but the size of a wire is not angstroms.

1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:07.160
 And if you try and make it narrower,

1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:08.520
 the resistance just goes up.

1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:10.760
 So you don't actually win.

1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:12.360
 To communicate over long distances,

1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:15.640
 you need your wires to be microns wide.

1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.160
 And it's the same thing for waveguides.

1:50:17.160 --> 1:50:18.920
 Waveguides are essentially limited

1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:20.280
 by the wavelength of light

1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:21.920
 and that's gonna be about a micron.

1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:24.680
 So whereas compare that to an axon,

1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:26.760
 the analogous component in the brain,

1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:30.120
 which is 10 nanometers in diameter,

1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:31.080
 something like that,

1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:33.680
 they're bigger when they need to communicate

1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:34.640
 over long distances,

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:37.960
 but grappling with the size of these structures

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.840
 is inevitable and crucial.

1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:43.800
 And so in order to make systems

1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:46.880
 of comparable scale to the human brain by scale here,

1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:49.840
 I mean number of interconnected neurons,

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.760
 you absolutely have to be using

1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:53.640
 the third spatial dimension.

1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:55.960
 And that means on the wafer,

1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:57.360
 you need multiple layers

1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:59.600
 of both active and passive components.

1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:03.360
 Active, I mean superconducting electronic circuits

1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:05.360
 that are performing computations.

1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:07.400
 And passive, I mean these waveguides

1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:10.160
 that are routing the optical signals to different places,

1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:11.720
 you have to be able to stack those.

1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:15.240
 If you can get to something like 10 planes of each of those,

1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:18.840
 or maybe not even 10, maybe five, six, something like that,

1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:19.760
 then you're in business.

1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:22.880
 Now you can get millions of neurons on a wafer,

1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:26.360
 but that's not anywhere close to the brain scale.

1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:27.960
 In order to get to the scale of the human brain,

1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:30.000
 you're gonna have to also use the third dimension

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.320
 in the sense that entire wafers need to be stacked

1:51:33.320 --> 1:51:34.160
 on top of each other

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:36.080
 with fiber optic communication between them.

1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:38.640
 And we need to be able to fill a space

1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:42.040
 the size of this table with stacked wafers.

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:44.280
 And that's when you can get to some 10 billion neurons

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:45.120
 like your human brain.

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.680
 And I don't think that's specific

1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:48.800
 to the optoelectronic approach that we're taking.

1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:51.400
 I think that applies to any hardware

1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:53.560
 where you're trying to reach commensurate scale

1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:55.000
 and complexity as the human brain.

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.520
 So you need that fractal stacking.

1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:01.120
 So stacking on the wafer and stacking of the wafers

1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:03.240
 and then whatever the system,

1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:06.360
 the stacking of the tables with the wafers.

1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:07.680
 And it has to be fractal all the way.

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:08.560
 You're exactly right.

1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.040
 Because that's the only way

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:12.480
 that you can efficiently get information

1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:15.040
 from a small point to across that whole network.

1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:17.480
 It has to have the power law connected.

1:52:17.480 --> 1:52:20.600
 And photons out like optics throughout.

1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:21.440
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:23.680
 Once you're at this scale, to me it's just obvious.

1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:25.560
 Of course you're using light for communication.

1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:30.560
 You have fiber optics given to us from nature, so simple.

1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:32.680
 The thought of even trying to do this,

1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:36.040
 any kind of electrical communication just doesn't,

1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:37.040
 it doesn't make sense to me.

1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:38.240
 I'm not saying it's wrong.

1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:40.840
 I don't know, but that's where I'm coming from.

1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:43.680
 So let's return to loop neurons.

1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:46.240
 Why are they called loop neurons?

1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:48.840
 Yeah, the term loop neurons comes from the fact,

1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:49.840
 like we've been talking about,

1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:53.240
 that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops.

1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:57.240
 So even in a lot of forms of digital computing

1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:01.360
 with superconductors, storing a signal

1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:05.280
 in a superconducting loop is a primary technique.

1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:08.840
 In this particular case, it's just loops everywhere you look.

1:53:08.840 --> 1:53:11.840
 So the strength of a synaptic weight

1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:15.280
 is gonna be set by the amount of current circulating

1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:17.960
 in a loop that is coupled to the synapse.

1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:22.960
 So memory is implemented as current circulating

1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:24.360
 in a superconducting loop.

1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:28.000
 The coupling between say a synapse in a dendrite

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.520
 or a synapse in the neuron cell body occurs

1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:33.920
 through loop coupling through transformer.

1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:35.600
 So current circulating in a synapse

1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:38.360
 is gonna induce current in a different loop,

1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:41.560
 a receiving loop in the neuron cell body.

1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:45.240
 So since all of the computation is happening

1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:47.360
 in these flux storage loops

1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:49.160
 and they play such a central role

1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:51.040
 in how the information is processed,

1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:53.600
 how memories are formed, all that stuff,

1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:54.800
 I didn't think too much about it.

1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:56.320
 I just called them loop neurons

1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:58.240
 because it rolls off the tongue a little bit better

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.240
 than superconducting optoelectronic neurons.

1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:07.240
 Okay, so how do you design circuits for these loop neurons?

1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:09.760
 That's a great question.

1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:12.360
 There's a lot of different scales of design.

1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:16.400
 So at the level of just one synapse,

1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:19.040
 you can use conventional methods.

1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:21.400
 They're not that complicated

1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:23.240
 as far as superconducting electronics goes.

1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:27.120
 It's just for Joseph's injunctions or something like that,

1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:29.200
 depending on how much complexity you wanna add.

1:54:29.200 --> 1:54:34.200
 So you can just directly simulate each component in SPICE.

1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:35.880
 We've been with... What's SPICE?

1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:39.240
 It's Standard Electrical Simulation Software, basically.

1:54:39.240 --> 1:54:42.600
 So you're just explicitly solving the differential equations

1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:44.360
 that describe the circuit elements.

1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:46.240
 And then you can stack these things together

1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:48.880
 in that simulation software to then build circuits.

1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:51.600
 You can, but that becomes computationally expensive.

1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:54.120
 So one of the things when COVID hit,

1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:58.320
 we knew we had to turn some attention to more things you can do

1:54:58.320 --> 1:54:59.840
 at home in your basement or whatever.

1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:02.720
 And one of them was computational modeling.

1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:07.720
 So we started working on adapting,

1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:10.200
 abstracting out the circuit performance

1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:12.560
 so that you don't have to explicitly solve

1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.160
 the circuit equations,

1:55:14.160 --> 1:55:15.880
 which for Joseph's injunctions,

1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:18.480
 usually needs to be done on like a picosecond time scale

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:21.240
 and you have a lot of nodes in your circuit.

1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:24.880
 So it results in a lot of differential equations

1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:26.360
 that need to be solved simultaneously.

1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:29.440
 We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits

1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.200
 that is scalable up to networks of millions or so.

1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:36.640
 Neurons is sort of where we're targeting right now.

1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:40.800
 So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits.

1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:43.640
 And as I said, it's based on these simple building blocks.

1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:46.360
 So you really only need to understand this one building block.

1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:49.000
 And if you get a good model of that, boom, it tiles.

1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.160
 And you can change the parameters in there

1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:52.840
 to get different behaviors and stuff.

1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:54.400
 But it's all based on now,

1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:57.120
 it's one differential equation that you need to solve.

1:55:57.120 --> 1:55:59.760
 So one differential equation

1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:03.760
 for every Synapse, Dendrite or Neuron in your system.

1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:05.360
 And for the neuroscientists out there,

1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:08.440
 it's just a simple leaky integrate and fire model.

1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:10.000
 Leaky integrator, basically.

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.880
 A Synapse is a leaky integrator,

1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:13.480
 a Dendrite is a leaky integrator.

1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:18.480
 So I'm really fascinated by how this one simple component

1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:22.200
 can be used to achieve lots of different types

1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:24.440
 of dynamical activity.

1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:27.520
 And to me, that's where scalability comes from.

1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:29.200
 And also complexity as well.

1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:30.880
 Complexity is often characterized

1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:35.440
 by relatively simple building blocks

1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:39.360
 connected in potentially simple or sometimes complicated ways.

1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:41.040
 And then emergent new behavior

1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:44.680
 that was hard to predict from those simple elements.

1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:46.640
 And that's exactly what we're working with here.

1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:49.040
 So it's a very exciting platform,

1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:50.360
 both from a modeling perspective

1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.760
 and from a hardware manifestation perspective

1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:57.360
 where we can hopefully start to have this test bed

1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:58.840
 where we can explore things,

1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:00.800
 not just related to neuroscience,

1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:04.480
 but also related to other things that connected

1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:07.120
 to other physics like critical phenomenon,

1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:08.680
 ising models, things like that.

1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:13.080
 So you were asking how we simulate these circuits.

1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:14.560
 It's at different levels.

1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:18.360
 And we've got the simple spice circuit stuff.

1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:19.560
 That's no problem.

1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:21.760
 And now we're building these network models

1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:23.640
 based on this more efficient leaky integrator.

1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:26.240
 So we can actually reduce every element

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.480
 to one differential equation.

1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:28.880
 And then we can also step through it

1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.720
 on a much coarser time grid.

1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:32.400
 So it ends up being something like a factor

1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:35.400
 of 1,000 to 10,000 speed improvement,

1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:37.800
 which allows us to simulate,

1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:40.560
 but hopefully up to millions of neurons.

1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:44.680
 Whereas before we would have been limited to tens,

1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:45.840
 a hundred, something like that.

1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.840
 And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems

1:57:48.840 --> 1:57:49.920
 with a quantum computer.

1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:53.440
 So the goal here is to understand such systems.

1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:55.960
 For me, the goal is to study this

1:57:55.960 --> 1:57:58.960
 as a scientific physical system.

1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:02.000
 I'm not drawn towards turning this

1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:03.520
 into an enterprise at this point.

1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:05.840
 I feel short term applications

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:07.480
 that obviously make a lot of money

1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:11.400
 is not necessarily a curiosity driver for you at the moment.

1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:12.240
 Absolutely not.

1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:14.040
 If you're interested in short term making money,

1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:16.520
 go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:20.880
 If you wanna understand things like the physics

1:58:20.880 --> 1:58:23.000
 of a fascinating system,

1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.600
 or if you wanna understand something more

1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:27.800
 along the lines of the physical limits

1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:29.480
 of what can be achieved,

1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:32.680
 then I think single photon communication,

1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:35.960
 superconducting electronics, extremely exciting.

1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:39.640
 What if I wanna use superconducting hardware

1:58:39.640 --> 1:58:42.040
 at Fort Kelvin to mine Bitcoin?

1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:43.280
 That's my main interest.

1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.920
 That's the reason I wanted to talk to you today.

1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:47.680
 I wanna, I don't know.

1:58:47.680 --> 1:58:49.000
 What's Bitcoin?

1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:53.200
 That's a look it up on the internet.

1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:54.800
 Somebody told me about it.

1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:56.880
 I'm not sure exactly what it is.

1:58:56.880 --> 1:58:59.080
 So, but let me ask nevertheless

1:58:59.080 --> 1:59:01.560
 about applications to machine learning.

1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:02.400
 Okay.

1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:07.400
 So, if you look at the scale of five, 10, 20 years,

1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:10.200
 is it possible to,

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:13.200
 before we understand the nature of human intelligence

1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:14.640
 and general intelligence,

1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:19.320
 do you think we'll start falling out of this exploration

1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:21.560
 of neuromorphic systems,

1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:23.960
 ability to solve some of the problems

1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:26.640
 that the machine learning systems of today can't solve?

1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:31.640
 I'm really hesitant to over promise.

1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:33.600
 So, I really don't know.

1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:36.760
 I also, I don't really understand machine learning

1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:37.600
 in a lot of senses.

1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:42.480
 I mean, machine learning, from my perspective,

1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:46.880
 appears to require that you know

1:59:46.880 --> 1:59:49.200
 precisely what your input is

1:59:49.200 --> 1:59:51.720
 and also what your goal is.

1:59:51.720 --> 1:59:53.360
 You usually have some objective function

1:59:53.360 --> 1:59:54.200
 or something like that.

1:59:54.200 --> 1:59:57.320
 And that's just, that's very limiting.

1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:00.200
 I mean, of course, a lot of times that's the case.

2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:03.120
 You know, there's a picture and there's a horse in it.

2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:03.960
 So, you're done.

2:00:03.960 --> 2:00:06.520
 But that's not a very interesting problem.

2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:09.520
 I think, when I think about intelligence,

2:00:09.520 --> 2:00:13.200
 it's almost defined by the ability to handle problems

2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:15.960
 where you don't know what your inputs are going to be

2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:17.400
 and you don't even necessarily know

2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:18.600
 what you're trying to accomplish.

2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:21.640
 I mean, I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish

2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:22.560
 in this world.

2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:24.560
 Yeah, at all scales.

2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:25.920
 Yeah, at all scales, right.

2:00:25.920 --> 2:00:30.920
 I mean, so sometimes, so I'm more drawn to the underlying

2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:37.840
 phenomena, the critical dynamics of this system

2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:41.320
 trying to understand how elements

2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:43.600
 that you build into your hardware

2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:48.600
 result in emergent, fascinating activity

2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:52.040
 that was very difficult to predict, things like that.

2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:53.600
 But I gotta be really careful

2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:55.160
 because I think a lot of other people

2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:57.000
 who, if they found themselves working

2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:58.560
 on this project in my shoes,

2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:00.880
 they would say, all right, what are all the different ways

2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:02.400
 we can use this for machine learning?

2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:04.840
 Actually, let me just definitely mention

2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:06.600
 colleague at NIST, Mike Schneider.

2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:09.280
 He's also very much interested,

2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:11.640
 particularly in the superconducting side of things,

2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:14.880
 using the incredible speed, power efficiency,

2:01:14.880 --> 2:01:18.080
 also Kensigal at Colgate, other people working on,

2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:20.440
 specifically the superconducting side of this,

2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:25.000
 for machine learning and deep feedforward neural networks,

2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:27.360
 there, the advantages are obvious.

2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:28.760
 It's extremely fast.

2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:31.840
 Yeah, so that's less on the nature of intelligence

2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:35.720
 and more on various characteristics of this hardware

2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:38.360
 that you can use for the basic computations

2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:40.640
 we know today and communication.

2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:42.840
 One of the things that Mike Schneider's working on right now

2:01:42.840 --> 2:01:46.120
 is an image classifier at a relatively small scale.

2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:48.320
 I think he's targeting that nine pixel problem

2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:50.040
 where you can have three different characters

2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:54.200
 and you put in a nine pixel image

2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:58.400
 and you classify it as one of these three categories.

2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:00.120
 And that's gonna be really interesting

2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:01.240
 to see what happens there.

2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:05.680
 Because if you can show that even at that scale,

2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:08.160
 you just put these images in and you get it out

2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:09.520
 and he thinks he can do it.

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:11.600
 I forgot if it's a nanosecond or some,

2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:14.000
 extremely fast classification time.

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:15.560
 It's probably less, it's probably

2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:17.400
 100 picoseconds or something.

2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:18.800
 There you have challenges though

2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:21.560
 because the Josephson junctions themselves,

2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:24.480
 the electronic circuit is extremely power efficient.

2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:26.840
 Some orders of magnitude for something more

2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:29.240
 than a transistor doing the same thing.

2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:31.440
 But when you have to cool it down to four Kelvin,

2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:33.880
 you pay a huge overhead just for keeping it cold,

2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:35.240
 even if it's not doing anything.

2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:40.240
 So it has to work at large scale

2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:43.680
 in order to overcome that power penalty,

2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:45.120
 but that's possible.

2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:48.000
 It's just, it's gonna have to get that performance.

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.720
 And this is sort of what you were asking about before

2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:52.800
 is like how much better than silicon would it need to be?

2:02:52.800 --> 2:02:54.120
 And the answer is, I don't know.

2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.240
 I think if it's just overall better than silicon

2:02:57.240 --> 2:03:00.200
 at a problem that a lot of people care about,

2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:02.640
 maybe it's image classification,

2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:03.960
 maybe it's face recognition,

2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:07.560
 maybe it's monitoring credit transactions, I don't know.

2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:09.000
 Then I think it will have a place.

2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:10.440
 It's not gonna be in your cell phone,

2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:12.280
 but it could be in your data center.

2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:16.160
 So what about in terms of the data center,

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:17.720
 I don't know if you're paying attention

2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:22.720
 to the various systems like Tesla recently announced Dojo,

2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:27.240
 which is a large scale machine learning training system

2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:28.960
 that again, the bottleneck there

2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:32.840
 is probably going to be communication between those systems.

2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:34.920
 Is there something from your work

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:38.720
 on everything we've been talking about

2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:41.680
 in terms of superconductive hardware

2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:43.560
 that could be useful there?

2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:46.760
 Oh, I mean, okay, tomorrow, no.

2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:49.040
 In the longterm, it could be the whole thing.

2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:50.440
 It could be nothing, I don't know,

2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:52.160
 but definitely, definitely.

2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:56.760
 So I don't know that much about Dojo.

2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:58.840
 My understanding is that that's new, right?

2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:01.360
 That's just coming online.

2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:06.360
 Well, I don't even know where it hasn't come online.

2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.560
 And when you announce big sexy,

2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:13.200
 so let me explain to you the way things work in the world.

2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:15.720
 In the word of business and marketing,

2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:18.400
 it's not always clear where you are

2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:20.560
 on the coming online part of that.

2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:22.680
 So I don't know where they are exactly,

2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:26.960
 but the vision is from ground up to build a very,

2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:31.080
 very large scale modular machine learning ASIC,

2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.640
 basically hardware that's optimized

2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:34.120
 for training neural networks.

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:36.080
 And of course, there's a lot of companies

2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:39.360
 that are small and big working on this kind of problem.

2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:42.680
 The question is how to do it in a modular way

2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:45.640
 that has very fast communication.

2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:49.520
 The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company

2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:51.560
 that at least at this time,

2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:55.200
 is so singularly focused on solving

2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:57.720
 a particular machine learning problem

2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:00.880
 and is making obviously a lot of money doing so

2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:02.200
 because the machine learning problem

2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:05.160
 happens to be involved with autonomous driving.

2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:09.760
 And so you have a system that's driven by an application.

2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:12.440
 And that's really interesting because, you know,

2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:16.200
 you have maybe Google working on TPUs

2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:21.040
 and so on, you have all these other companies with ASICs,

2:05:21.040 --> 2:05:25.960
 they're usually more kind of always thinking general.

2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:29.160
 So I like it when it's driven by a particular application

2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:32.880
 because then you can really get to the, it's like,

2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:37.240
 it's somehow, if you just talk broadly about intelligence,

2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:40.280
 you may not always get to the right solutions.

2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:42.720
 It's nice to couple that sometimes a specific

2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:46.120
 clear illustration of something

2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:47.640
 that requires general intelligence,

2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.880
 which for me, driving is one such case.

2:05:49.880 --> 2:05:51.080
 I think you're exactly right.

2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:54.360
 Sometimes just having that focus on that application

2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:57.640
 brings a lot of people focuses their energy and attention.

2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:59.560
 I think that, so one of the things

2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:01.960
 that's appealing about what you're saying is

2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:03.840
 not just that the application is specific,

2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:06.000
 but also that the scale is big.

2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:10.080
 And that the benefit is also huge.

2:06:10.080 --> 2:06:12.280
 So financial anti humanity.

2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:13.040
 Right, right, right.

2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:15.480
 Yeah, so I guess let me just try to understand

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:20.000
 is the point of this dojo system to figure out

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:23.840
 the parameters that then plug into neural networks

2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:26.480
 and then you don't need to retrain,

2:06:26.480 --> 2:06:29.080
 you just make copies of a certain chip

2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:32.320
 that has all the parameters established or?

2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:36.760
 No, it's straight up retraining a large neural network

2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:38.560
 over and over and over.

2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:41.640
 So you have to do it once for every new car?

2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:43.120
 No, no, no, you have to,

2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:44.800
 so they do this interesting process,

2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:47.000
 which I think is a process for machine learning,

2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.280
 supervised machine learning systems.

2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:50.760
 You're going to have to do,

2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:55.120
 which is you have a system, you train your network once,

2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:57.160
 it takes a long time, I don't know how long,

2:06:57.160 --> 2:06:59.720
 but maybe a week to train.

2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:05.080
 And then you deploy it on, let's say about a million cars.

2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:05.920
 I don't know what the number is.

2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:07.800
 But that part, you just write software

2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:10.640
 that updates some weights in a table and yeah, okay.

2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:12.600
 But there's a loop back.

2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:13.440
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:17.440
 Each of those cars run into trouble rarely,

2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:23.840
 but they catch the edge cases of the performance

2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:28.280
 of that particular system and then send that data back

2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:31.440
 and either automatically or by humans,

2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:34.760
 that weird edge case data is annotated

2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:37.560
 and then the network has to become smart enough

2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:40.160
 to now be able to perform in those edge cases

2:07:40.160 --> 2:07:41.800
 so it has to get retrained.

2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:43.960
 There's clever ways of retraining different parts

2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:46.240
 of that network, but for the most part,

2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:49.280
 I think they prefer to retrain the entire thing.

2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:51.320
 So you have this giant monster

2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:54.880
 that kind of has to be retrained regularly.

2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:59.880
 I think the vision with Dojo is to have a very large

2:08:00.200 --> 2:08:05.200
 machine learning focused, driving focused supercomputer

2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:07.600
 that then is sufficiently modular,

2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:10.320
 that can be scaled to other machine learning applications.

2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:12.760
 But like, so they're not limiting themselves completely

2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:14.000
 to this particular application,

2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:17.440
 but this application is the way they kind of test

2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:20.400
 this iterative process of machine learning is

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:25.160
 you make a system that's very dumb, deploy it,

2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:27.160
 get the edge cases of where it fails,

2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:30.000
 make it a little smarter, it becomes a little less dumb

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000
 and that iterative process achieves something

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.120
 that you can call intelligent or is smart enough

2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:37.960
 to be able to solve this particular application.

2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:42.960
 So it has to do with training your own networks fast

2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:45.880
 and training your own networks that are large.

2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:48.520
 But also based on an extraordinary amount

2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:49.880
 of diverse input.

2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:50.720
 Data, yeah.

2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:51.880
 And that's one of the things,

2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:54.480
 so this does seem like one of those spaces

2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:58.920
 where the scale of superconducting optical electronics,

2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.480
 the way that, so when you talk about the weaknesses,

2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:04.080
 like I said, okay, well, you have to cool it down.

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:05.720
 At this scale, that's fine.

2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:09.400
 Because that's not too much of an added cost.

2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:10.920
 Most of your power is being dissipated

2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:12.880
 by the circuits themselves, not the cooling.

2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:17.880
 And also you have one centralized kind of cognitive hub

2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:20.720
 if you will.

2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:24.240
 And so when, if we're talking about putting

2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:28.560
 a superconducting system in a car, that's questionable.

2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:30.600
 Do you really wanna cryostat in the trunk

2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:31.440
 of everyone in your car?

2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:32.920
 It'll fit, it's not that big of a deal,

2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:35.720
 but hopefully there's a better way, right?

2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:39.080
 But since this is sort of a central supreme intelligence

2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.400
 or something like that,

2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:45.120
 and it needs to really have this massive data acquisition,

2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:47.120
 massive data integration,

2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:49.120
 I would think that that's where large scale

2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:51.240
 spiking neural networks with vast communication

2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:53.120
 and all these things would have something

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:54.280
 pretty tremendous to offer.

2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:55.720
 It's not gonna happen tomorrow.

2:09:55.720 --> 2:09:58.240
 There's a lot of development that needs to be done.

2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:00.560
 But you know, we have to be patient

2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:02.320
 with self driving cars for a lot of reasons.

2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:04.600
 We were all optimistic that they would be here by now.

2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:06.480
 And okay, they are to some extent,

2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:09.600
 but if we're thinking five or 10 years down the line,

2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:12.120
 it's not unreasonable.

2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:15.200
 One other thing I'll just, let me just mention,

2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:17.400
 getting into self driving cars and technologies

2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:19.720
 that are using AI out in the world,

2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:21.560
 this is something NIST cares a lot about.

2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:25.080
 Elham Tabasi is leading up a much larger effort

2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:29.360
 in AI at NIST than my little project.

2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:32.720
 And really central to that mission

2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:35.040
 is this concept of trustworthiness.

2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:38.960
 So when you're going to deploy this neural network

2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:43.360
 in every single automobile with so much on the line,

2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:45.280
 you have to be able to trust that.

2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:48.040
 So now how do we know that we can trust that?

2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:50.120
 How do we know that we can trust the self driving car

2:10:50.120 --> 2:10:53.720
 or the supercomputer that trained it?

2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:54.880
 There's a lot of work there

2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:57.000
 and there's a lot of that going on at NIST.

2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:58.240
 And it's still early days.

2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:01.160
 I mean, you're familiar with the problem

2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:02.000
 and all that.

2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.480
 But there's a fascinating dance in engineering

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.720
 with like safety critical systems.

2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:08.880
 There's a desire in computer science,

2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:13.160
 just recently talked to Don Knuth to do,

2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:14.840
 for algorithms and for systems

2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:17.480
 for them to be provably correct or provably safe.

2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:20.320
 And this is one other difference

2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:22.360
 between humans and biological systems

2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:24.320
 is we're not provably anything.

2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:25.160
 Right, right.

2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:29.120
 So there's some aspect of imperfection.

2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:29.960
 Yes.

2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:33.360
 That we need to have built in like robustness

2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:37.920
 to imperfection be part of our systems,

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:40.680
 which is a difficult thing for engineers to contend with.

2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:42.800
 They're very uncomfortable with the idea

2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:46.880
 that you have to be okay with failure

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:49.720
 and almost engineer failure into the system.

2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:51.000
 Mathematicians hate it too.

2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.640
 But I think it was Turing who said something

2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:57.080
 along the lines of I can give you an intelligent system

2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:59.520
 or I can give you a flawless system,

2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:00.880
 but I can't give you both.

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.120
 And it's in sort of creativity and abstract thinking

2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:07.840
 seem to rely somewhat on stochasticity

2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.320
 and not having components

2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:13.760
 that perform exactly the same way every time.

2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:15.720
 This is where like the disagreement I have

2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:18.560
 with not disagreement, but a different view on the world.

2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:23.560
 I'm with Turing, but when I talk to robotic robot colleagues

2:12:24.640 --> 2:12:26.480
 that sounds like I'm talking robots,

2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:31.480
 colleagues that are roboticists, the goal is perfection.

2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:36.640
 And to me is like, no, I think the goal should be

2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:41.000
 imperfection that's communicated

2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:44.200
 and through the interaction between humans and robots

2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:49.120
 that imperfection becomes a feature, not a bug.

2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:52.200
 Like together, as seen as a system,

2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:53.720
 the human and the robot together

2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:56.400
 are better than either of them individually,

2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:00.560
 but the robot itself is not perfect in any way.

2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:02.800
 Of course, there's a bunch of disagreements,

2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:07.800
 including with Mr. Elon about to me autonomous driving

2:13:07.960 --> 2:13:10.800
 is fundamentally a human robot interaction problem,

2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:12.400
 not a robotics problem.

2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:14.360
 To Elon, it's a robotics problem.

2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:18.640
 That's actually an open and fascinating question,

2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:21.720
 whether humans can be removed from the loop completely.

2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:27.720
 We've talked about a lot of fascinating chemistry

2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:31.280
 and physics and engineering,

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:33.720
 and we're always running up against this issue

2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:37.600
 that nature seems to dictate what's easy and what's hard.

2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:40.120
 So you have this cool little paper

2:13:40.120 --> 2:13:42.760
 that I'd love to just ask you about.

2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:46.040
 It's titled, does cosmological evolution

2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:48.240
 select for technology?

2:13:48.240 --> 2:13:53.240
 So in physics, there's parameters

2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:56.240
 that seem to define the way our universe works,

2:13:56.240 --> 2:13:59.360
 that physics works, that if it worked any differently,

2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:01.760
 we would get a very different world.

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:04.240
 So it seems like the parameters are very fine tuned

2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:06.520
 to the kind of physics that we see.

2:14:06.520 --> 2:14:08.640
 All the beautiful E equals MC squared,

2:14:08.640 --> 2:14:10.440
 we get these nice, beautiful laws.

2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:13.160
 It seems like very fine tuned for that.

2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:18.160
 So what you're arguing this article is it may be

2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:20.600
 that the universe is also fine tuned,

2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:25.400
 it's parameters that enable the kind of technological

2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:29.600
 innovation that we see, that technology that we see.

2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:31.520
 Can you explain this idea?

2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:33.440
 Yeah, I think you've introduced it nicely.

2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:38.440
 Let me just try to say a few things in my language.

2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:41.680
 Leia, what is this fine tuning problem?

2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:46.520
 So physicists have spent centuries trying to understand

2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:51.520
 the system of equations that govern the way nature behaves,

2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:55.080
 the way particles move and interact with each other.

2:14:55.080 --> 2:15:00.080
 And as that understanding has become more clear over time,

2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:05.080
 it became sort of evident that it's all well adjusted

2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:12.120
 to allow a universe like we see,

2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:16.320
 very complex, this large, long lived universe.

2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:20.000
 And so one answer to that is, well, of course it is

2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:21.600
 because we wouldn't be here otherwise.

2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:24.480
 But I don't know, that's not very satisfying.

2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:27.280
 That's what's known as the weak anthropic principle.

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:29.280
 It's a statement of selection bias.

2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:33.720
 We can only observe a universe that is fit for us to live in.

2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:35.480
 So what does it mean for a universe to be fit

2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:36.320
 for us to live in?

2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:38.480
 Well, the pursuit of physics,

2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:42.680
 it is based partially on coming up with equations

2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:46.360
 that describe how things behave and interact with each other.

2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:48.560
 But in all those equations you have,

2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:50.040
 so there's the form of the equation,

2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:54.720
 sort of how different fields or particles move

2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:58.560
 in space and time, but then there are also the parameters

2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:01.200
 that just tell you sort of the strength

2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:04.440
 of different couplings, how strongly does it,

2:16:04.440 --> 2:16:06.960
 a charged particle couple to the electromagnetic field

2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:10.880
 or masses, how strongly does a particle couple

2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:13.080
 to the Higgs field or something like that.

2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:17.080
 And those parameters that define,

2:16:17.080 --> 2:16:19.880
 not the general structure of the equations,

2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:23.680
 but the relative importance of different terms,

2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:25.360
 they seem to be every bit as important

2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:27.880
 as the structure of the equations themselves.

2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:29.440
 And so I forget who it was,

2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:31.280
 somebody when they were working through this

2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:34.080
 and trying to see, okay, if I adjust the parameter,

2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:35.320
 this parameter over here, call it the,

2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:36.840
 say the fine structure constant,

2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:38.000
 which tells us the strength

2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.480
 of the electromagnetic interaction.

2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:42.400
 Oh boy, I can't change it very much.

2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:43.840
 Otherwise, nothing works.

2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:45.440
 The universe sort of doesn't,

2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:47.320
 it just pops into existence and goes away

2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:49.000
 in a nanosecond or something like that.

2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.120
 And somebody had the phrase,

2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:53.040
 this looks like a put up job.

2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:57.720
 Meaning every one of these parameters was dialed in,

2:16:57.720 --> 2:17:00.720
 arguable how precisely they have to be dialed in,

2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:02.800
 but dialed in to some extent,

2:17:02.800 --> 2:17:05.400
 not just in order to enable our existence,

2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:07.160
 that's a very anthropocentric view,

2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:10.040
 but to enable a universe like this one.

2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:14.080
 So okay, maybe, I think the majority position

2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:17.080
 of working physicists in the field is,

2:17:17.080 --> 2:17:19.000
 it has to be that way in order for us to exist.

2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:20.440
 We're here, we shouldn't be surprised

2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:22.840
 that that's the way the universe is.

2:17:22.840 --> 2:17:24.560
 And I don't know, for a while,

2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:26.160
 that never sat well with me,

2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:29.480
 but I just kind of moved on because there are things to do

2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:31.200
 and a lot of exciting work,

2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:33.800
 doesn't depend on resolving this puzzle.

2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:38.800
 But as I started working more with technology,

2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:41.840
 getting into the more recent years of my career,

2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:43.760
 particularly when I started,

2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:46.560
 after having worked with silicon for a long time,

2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:49.040
 which was kind of eerie on its own.

2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:51.200
 But then when I switched over to superconductors,

2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:53.600
 I was just like, this is crazy.

2:17:53.600 --> 2:17:57.400
 It's just absolutely astonishing

2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:00.600
 that our universe gives us superconductivity.

2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:02.480
 It's one of the most beautiful physical phenomena,

2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:06.600
 and it's also extraordinarily useful for technology.

2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:08.720
 So you can argue that the universe has to have

2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:11.320
 the parameters it does for us to exist

2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:13.040
 because we couldn't be here otherwise.

2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:14.800
 But why does it give us technology?

2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:18.880
 Why does it give us silicon that has this ideal oxide

2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:20.920
 that allows us to make a transistor

2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:25.120
 without trying that hard, that can't be explained

2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:26.760
 by the same anthropic reasoning?

2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.360
 Yeah, so it's asking the why question.

2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:34.680
 I mean, a slight natural extension of that question is,

2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:39.440
 I wonder if the parameters were different,

2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:44.240
 if we would simply have just another set of paint brushes

2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:46.880
 to create totally other things

2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:50.040
 that wouldn't look like anything like the technology

2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:54.560
 of today, but would nevertheless have incredible complexity,

2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:57.200
 which is if you sort of zoom out and start defining things,

2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:01.480
 not by like how many batteries it needs

2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:03.640
 and whether it can make toast,

2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:06.480
 but more like how much complexity is within the system

2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:07.320
 or something like that.

2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:09.720
 Well, yeah, you can start to quantify things.

2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:10.880
 You're exactly right.

2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:15.600
 So nowhere am I arguing that in all of the vast parameter

2:19:15.600 --> 2:19:18.080
 space of everything that could conceivably exist

2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:20.680
 in the multiverse of nature,

2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:23.320
 there is this one point in parameter space

2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:25.160
 where complexity arises.

2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.680
 I doubt it.

2:19:26.680 --> 2:19:31.160
 That would be a shameful waste of resources, it seems.

2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:34.720
 But it might be that we reside at one place

2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:38.480
 in parameter space that has been adapted

2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:40.080
 through an evolutionary process

2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:43.200
 to allow us to make certain technologies

2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:47.120
 that allow our particular kind of universe to arise

2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:49.800
 and sort of achieve the things it does.

2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:52.720
 See, I wonder if nature in this kind of discussion,

2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:55.720
 if nature is a catalyst for innovation

2:19:55.720 --> 2:19:57.680
 or if it's a ceiling for innovation.

2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:00.800
 So like, is it going to always limit us?

2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:04.000
 Like what you're talking about, Silicon,

2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.640
 is it just make it super easy to do awesome stuff

2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.000
 in a certain dimension,

2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:09.360
 but we could still do awesome stuff

2:20:09.360 --> 2:20:11.560
 in other ways, it'll just be harder.

2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:15.440
 Or does it really set like the maximum we can do?

2:20:15.440 --> 2:20:17.840
 That's a good thing to,

2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:19.440
 that's a good subject to discuss.

2:20:19.440 --> 2:20:20.960
 I guess I feel like we need to lay

2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:23.160
 a little bit more groundwork.

2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:28.160
 So I wanna make sure that I introduce this

2:20:28.440 --> 2:20:31.760
 in the context of Lee Smolin's previous idea.

2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:35.640
 So who's Lee Smolin and what kind of ideas does he have?

2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:39.000
 Okay, Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist

2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.800
 who back in the late 1980s,

2:20:41.800 --> 2:20:43.960
 published a paper in the early 1990s,

2:20:43.960 --> 2:20:47.000
 introduced this idea of cosmological natural selection,

2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:51.400
 which argues that the universe did evolve.

2:20:51.400 --> 2:20:54.480
 So his paper was called, did the universe evolve?

2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.480
 And I gave myself the liberty of titling my paper,

2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.400
 does cosmological selection,

2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:03.920
 or does cosmological evolution select for technology

2:21:03.920 --> 2:21:04.960
 in reference to that?

2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:08.160
 So he introduced that idea decades ago,

2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:12.160
 now he primarily works on quantum gravity,

2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:14.640
 loop quantum gravity, other approaches to

2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:19.280
 unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity,

2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:21.960
 as you can read about in his most recent book,

2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:24.280
 I believe, and he's been on your show as well.

2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:27.760
 So, but I wanna introduce this idea

2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:29.360
 of cosmological natural selection

2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:32.640
 because I think that is one of the core ideas

2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:35.320
 that could change our understanding

2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:37.800
 of how the universe got here, our role in it,

2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:39.840
 what technology is doing here.

2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:41.240
 But there's a couple more pieces

2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:42.280
 that need to be set up first.

2:21:42.280 --> 2:21:44.200
 So the beginning of our universe

2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:47.240
 is largely accepted to be the big bang.

2:21:47.240 --> 2:21:49.800
 And what that means is if you look back in time

2:21:49.800 --> 2:21:52.480
 by looking far away in space,

2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:56.840
 you see that everything used to be at one point

2:21:56.840 --> 2:21:58.800
 and it expanded away from there,

2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:02.560
 there was an era in the evolutionary process

2:22:02.560 --> 2:22:05.400
 of our universe that was called inflation.

2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:09.000
 And this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guthin

2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:13.120
 and others, Andre Linday and others in the 80s.

2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:16.000
 And this idea of inflation is basically that

2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:21.000
 when a singularity begins this process of growth,

2:22:25.200 --> 2:22:27.560
 there can be a temporary stage

2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:30.840
 where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly.

2:22:30.840 --> 2:22:33.720
 And based on quantum field theory,

2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:35.680
 this tells us that this should produce matter

2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:37.800
 in precisely the proportions that we find

2:22:37.800 --> 2:22:41.320
 of hydrogen and helium and the big bang, lithium too,

2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:44.840
 lithium also, and other things too.

2:22:44.840 --> 2:22:47.120
 So the predictions that come out of big bang

2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:50.720
 inflationary cosmology have stood up extremely well

2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:55.080
 to empirical verification, the cosmic microwave background,

2:22:55.080 --> 2:22:55.920
 things like this.

2:22:55.920 --> 2:22:59.880
 So most scientists working in the field think

2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:03.720
 that the origin of our universe is the big bang.

2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:08.040
 And I base all my thinking on that as well.

2:23:08.040 --> 2:23:11.440
 I'm just laying this out there so that people understand

2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:14.200
 that where I'm coming from is an extension,

2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:19.080
 not a replacement of existing well founded ideas.

2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:24.080
 In a paper, I believe it was 1986 with Alan Guth

2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:26.560
 and another author Farhi,

2:23:26.560 --> 2:23:31.560
 they wrote that a big bang, I don't remember the exact quote,

2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:35.240
 big bang is inextricably linked with a black hole.

2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:39.200
 The singularity that we call our origin

2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:41.960
 is mathematically indistinguishable from a black hole.

2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:44.320
 They're the same thing.

2:23:44.320 --> 2:23:48.880
 And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea,

2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:50.680
 I believe, I don't mean to speak for him,

2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:52.080
 but this is my reading of it.

2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:56.640
 So what Lee Smolin will say is that a black hole

2:23:56.640 --> 2:24:00.680
 in one universe is a big bang in another universe.

2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:04.640
 And this allows us to have progeny offspring.

2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:09.640
 So a universe can be said to have come before another universe.

2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:14.160
 And very crucially Smolin argues,

2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:16.880
 I think this is potentially one of the great ideas

2:24:16.880 --> 2:24:18.600
 of all time, that's my opinion,

2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:20.920
 that when a black hole forms,

2:24:20.920 --> 2:24:22.360
 it's not a classical entity,

2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:24.480
 it's a quantum gravitational entity.

2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:27.200
 So it is subject to the fluctuations

2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:30.980
 that are inherent in quantum mechanics.

2:24:30.980 --> 2:24:35.400
 The properties, what we're calling the parameters

2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:38.560
 that describe the physics of that system

2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:40.640
 are subject to slight mutations,

2:24:40.640 --> 2:24:42.560
 so that the offspring universe

2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:45.160
 does not have the exact same parameters

2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:48.400
 defining its physics as its parent universe.

2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:50.400
 They're close, but they're a little bit different.

2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:55.160
 And so now you have a mechanism for evolution,

2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:57.280
 for natural selection.

2:24:57.280 --> 2:24:59.720
 So there's mutation, so there's,

2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:03.320
 and then if you think about the DNA of universe

2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:05.920
 are the basic parameters that govern its laws.

2:25:05.920 --> 2:25:10.160
 Exactly, so what Smolin said is,

2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:13.640
 our universe results from an evolutionary process

2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:14.760
 that can be traced back some,

2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:17.680
 he estimated 200 million generations.

2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:20.680
 Initially there was something like a vacuum fluctuation

2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:25.680
 that produced through random chance a universe

2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:27.400
 that was able to reproduce just once.

2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:29.800
 So now it had one offspring and then over time

2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:31.040
 it was able to make more and more

2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:35.360
 until it evolved into a highly structured universe

2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:37.600
 with a very long lifetime,

2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:40.280
 with a great deal of complexity,

2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:42.480
 and importantly, especially importantly

2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:45.600
 for Lee Smolin, stars.

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:47.240
 Stars make black holes,

2:25:47.240 --> 2:25:50.960
 therefore we should expect our universe to be optimized,

2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:53.240
 have its physical parameters optimized

2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:55.680
 to make very large numbers of stars

2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:57.960
 because that's how you make black holes

2:25:57.960 --> 2:25:59.520
 and black holes make offspring.

2:25:59.520 --> 2:26:02.280
 So we expect the physics of our universe

2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:05.280
 to have evolved to maximize fecundity,

2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:06.840
 the number of offspring.

2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:09.280
 And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that

2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:12.240
 is through stars that the biggest ones die

2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:13.520
 in these core collapse supernova

2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:17.320
 that make a black hole and a child.

2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:19.840
 Okay, first of all, I agree with you that

2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:24.720
 this is back to our fractal view of everything

2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:27.240
 from intelligence to our universe.

2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.120
 That is very compelling and a very powerful idea

2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:36.120
 that unites the origin of life

2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.760
 and perhaps the origin of ideas and intelligence.

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:42.200
 So from a Dawkins perspective here on earth,

2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:44.040
 the evolution of those

2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:48.360
 and then the evolution of the laws of physics

2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:49.680
 that led to us.

2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:52.320
 I mean, it's beautiful.

2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:54.880
 And then you stacking on top of that

2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:57.520
 that maybe we're one of the offspring.

2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:01.080
 Right, okay, so before getting into

2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:03.080
 where I'd like to take that idea,

2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:05.200
 let me just a little bit more groundwork.

2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:07.120
 There is this concept of the multiverse

2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:08.640
 and it can be confusing.

2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:10.320
 Different people use the word multiverse

2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:15.080
 in different ways in the multiverse

2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:16.960
 that I think is relevant to picture

2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:20.880
 when trying to grasp Lee Smollin's idea.

2:27:20.880 --> 2:27:24.320
 Essentially, every vacuum fluctuation

2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:25.960
 can be referred to as a universe.

2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:28.880
 It occurs, it borrows energy from the vacuum

2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:30.240
 for some finite amount of time

2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:34.000
 and it evanesces back into the quantum vacuum.

2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.880
 And ideas of Gooth before that

2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:41.680
 and Andre Linde with eternal inflation

2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:42.800
 aren't that different,

2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:44.800
 that you would expect nature

2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:47.240
 due to the quantum properties of the vacuum,

2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:48.680
 which we know exists.

2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:50.280
 They're measurable through things

2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:52.560
 like the Casimir effect and others.

2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:54.520
 You know that there are these fluctuations

2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:55.440
 that are occurring.

2:27:55.440 --> 2:27:57.840
 What Smollin is arguing is that

2:27:57.840 --> 2:28:00.160
 there is this extensive multiverse

2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:03.840
 that this universe, what we can measure

2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:07.360
 and interact with is not unique in nature.

2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:10.760
 It's just our residents, it's where we reside.

2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:13.600
 And there are countless, potentially infinity,

2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:17.240
 other universes, other entire evolutionary trajectories

2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:19.160
 that have evolved into things

2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:20.960
 like what you were mentioning a second ago

2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:22.400
 with different parameters

2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:25.240
 and different ways of achieving complexity

2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:27.000
 and reproduction and all that stuff.

2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.480
 So it's not that the evolutionary process

2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:34.200
 is a funnel towards this endpoint, not at all.

2:28:34.200 --> 2:28:36.960
 Just like the biological evolutionary process

2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:39.320
 that has occurred within our universe

2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:42.800
 is not a unique route toward achieving

2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:45.000
 one specific chosen kind of species.

2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.160
 No, we have extraordinary diversity around us.

2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:50.520
 That's what evolution does.

2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.200
 And for anyone species like us,

2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:54.840
 it might feel like we're at the center of this process.

2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:57.160
 We're the destination of this process,

2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:01.400
 but we're just one of the many nearly infinite branches

2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:02.240
 of this process.

2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:04.240
 And I suspect it is exactly infinite.

2:29:04.240 --> 2:29:09.080
 I mean, I just can't understand how with this idea,

2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:11.000
 you can ever draw a boundary around and say,

2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:14.320
 no, the universe, I mean, the multiverse has 10

2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:18.880
 to the one quadrillion components, but not infinity.

2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:20.160
 I don't know, that's...

2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:24.080
 Well, yeah, I have a cognitively incapable,

2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:25.680
 as I think all of us are,

2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:29.080
 and truly understanding the concept of infinity.

2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:31.000
 And the concept of nothing as well.

2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.360
 And nothing, but also the concept of a lot

2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:35.480
 is pretty difficult.

2:29:35.480 --> 2:29:39.960
 I can count, I run out of fingers at a certain point,

2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:40.800
 and then you're screwed.

2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:41.800
 And when you're wearing shoes

2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:44.440
 and you can't even get down to your toes, it's like...

2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:47.080
 It's like, all right, a thousand fine, a million.

2:29:47.080 --> 2:29:48.040
 Is that what?

2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:50.080
 And then it gets crazier and crazier.

2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:50.920
 Right, right.

2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:55.720
 So this particular, so when we say technology, by the way,

2:29:55.720 --> 2:30:00.680
 I mean, there's some not to over romanticize the thing,

2:30:00.680 --> 2:30:04.200
 but there is some aspect about this branch of ours

2:30:04.200 --> 2:30:08.040
 that allows us to, for the universe to know itself.

2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:09.000
 Yes, yes.

2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:14.000
 So to have little conscious cognitive fingers,

2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:18.360
 they're able to feel like the scratch the head.

2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:19.640
 Right, right, right.

2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:22.080
 To be able to construct E equals MC squared

2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:25.680
 and to introspect, to start to gain some understanding

2:30:25.680 --> 2:30:27.440
 of the laws that govern it.

2:30:27.440 --> 2:30:32.040
 Isn't that kind of amazing?

2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:35.600
 Okay, I'm just human, but it feels like that,

2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.240
 if I were to build a system that does this kind of thing,

2:30:39.240 --> 2:30:42.120
 that evolves laws of physics, that evolves life,

2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:45.480
 that evolves intelligence, that my goal would be

2:30:45.480 --> 2:30:49.000
 to come up with things that are able to think about itself.

2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:53.400
 Right, aren't we kind of close to the design specs,

2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:54.720
 the destination?

2:30:54.720 --> 2:30:56.080
 We're pretty close, I don't know.

2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:58.400
 I mean, I'm spending my career designing things

2:30:58.400 --> 2:30:59.840
 that I hope will think about themselves.

2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:00.680
 Exactly.

2:31:00.680 --> 2:31:02.720
 You and I aren't too far apart on that one.

2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:05.560
 But that may be that problem is a lot harder

2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:06.400
 than we imagine.

2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:07.840
 Maybe we need to...

2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:09.520
 Let's not get too far,

2:31:09.520 --> 2:31:12.080
 because I want to emphasize something that,

2:31:12.080 --> 2:31:14.640
 what you're saying is, isn't it fascinating

2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:16.920
 that the universe evolved something

2:31:16.920 --> 2:31:19.920
 that can be conscious, reflect on itself?

2:31:19.920 --> 2:31:23.800
 But Lee Smollin's idea didn't take us there, remember?

2:31:23.800 --> 2:31:25.800
 It took us to stars.

2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:29.200
 Lee Smollin has argued, I think,

2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:32.120
 right on almost every single way,

2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:35.800
 that cosmological natural selection

2:31:35.800 --> 2:31:38.760
 could lead to a universe with rich structure,

2:31:38.760 --> 2:31:41.120
 and he argued that the structure,

2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:43.200
 the physics of our universe is designed

2:31:43.200 --> 2:31:46.120
 to make a lot of stars so that they can make black holes.

2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:48.320
 But that doesn't explain what we're doing here.

2:31:48.320 --> 2:31:51.360
 In order for that to be an explanation of us,

2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:55.400
 what you have to assume is that once you made that universe

2:31:55.400 --> 2:31:58.080
 that was capable of producing stars,

2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:00.320
 life, planets, all these other things,

2:32:00.320 --> 2:32:01.320
 we're along for the ride.

2:32:01.320 --> 2:32:02.240
 They got lucky.

2:32:02.240 --> 2:32:05.640
 We're kind of arising, growing up in the cracks,

2:32:05.640 --> 2:32:06.960
 but the universe isn't here for us.

2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:09.320
 We're still kind of a fluke in that picture.

2:32:09.320 --> 2:32:12.640
 And I can't, I don't necessarily have

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:14.920
 a philosophical opposition to that stance.

2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:19.920
 It's just not, okay, so I don't think it's complete.

2:32:20.280 --> 2:32:23.040
 So it seems like whatever we got going on here to you,

2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:25.720
 it seems like whatever we have here on earth

2:32:25.720 --> 2:32:28.520
 seems like a thing you might want to select for

2:32:28.520 --> 2:32:29.720
 in this whole big process.

2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:30.560
 Yes, exactly.

2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:32.160
 So if what you are truly,

2:32:32.160 --> 2:32:34.960
 if your entire evolutionary process

2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:36.840
 only cares about fecundity,

2:32:36.840 --> 2:32:39.840
 it only cares about making offspring universes

2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:41.840
 because then there's gonna be the most of them

2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:45.200
 in that local region of hyperspace,

2:32:45.200 --> 2:32:49.440
 which is the set of all possible universes, let's say.

2:32:50.340 --> 2:32:52.920
 You don't care how those universes are made.

2:32:52.920 --> 2:32:54.960
 You know they have to be made by black holes.

2:32:54.960 --> 2:32:58.040
 This is what inflationary theory tells us.

2:32:58.040 --> 2:33:02.160
 The Big Bang tells us that black holes make universes.

2:33:02.160 --> 2:33:04.320
 But what if there was a technological means

2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:06.040
 to make universes?

2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:09.320
 Stars require a ton of matter

2:33:09.320 --> 2:33:11.760
 because they're not thinking very carefully

2:33:11.760 --> 2:33:12.920
 about how you make a black hole.

2:33:12.920 --> 2:33:15.120
 They're just using gravity, you know?

2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:19.280
 But if we devise technologies

2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:23.400
 that can efficiently compress matter into a singularity,

2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:26.320
 it turns out that if you can compress about 10 kilograms

2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:28.680
 into a very small volume,

2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:29.840
 that will make a black hole

2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:32.480
 that is likely highly probable to inflate

2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:34.880
 into its own offspring universe.

2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:37.200
 This is according to calculations done by other people

2:33:37.200 --> 2:33:40.280
 who are professional quantum theorists, quantum field theorists.

2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:44.600
 And I hope I am grasping what they're telling me correctly.

2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:47.640
 I'm somewhat of a translator here.

2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:50.440
 But so that's the position

2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:52.680
 that is particularly intriguing to me,

2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:56.280
 which is that what might have happened is that,

2:33:56.280 --> 2:34:01.160
 okay, this particular branch on the vast tree of evolution,

2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:03.240
 cosmological evolution that we're talking about,

2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:05.720
 not biological evolution within our universe,

2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:09.040
 but cosmological evolution went through exactly

2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:10.960
 the process that Lee Smollin described.

2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:15.840
 Got to the stage where stars were making lots of black holes,

2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:19.520
 but then continued to evolve and somehow bridge that gap

2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:22.080
 and made intelligence and intelligence

2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:24.120
 capable of devising technologies

2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:27.880
 because technology's intelligence species

2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:29.640
 working in conjunction with technologies

2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:32.320
 could then produce even more.

2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:35.840
 More efficiently, more like faster and better

2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:36.880
 and more different.

2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:38.800
 Then you start to have different kind of mechanisms

2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:40.840
 and mutation perhaps, all that kind of stuff.

2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:43.120
 And so if you do a simple calculation that says,

2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:47.040
 all right, if I want to, we know roughly how many

2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:52.640
 core collapse supernovae have resulted in black holes

2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:56.000
 in our galaxy since the beginning of the universe.

2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:57.760
 And it's something like a billion.

2:34:57.760 --> 2:35:00.640
 So then you would have to estimate

2:35:00.640 --> 2:35:04.240
 that it would be possible for a technological civilization

2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:07.400
 to produce more than a billion black holes

2:35:07.400 --> 2:35:09.960
 with the energy and matter at their disposal.

2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:12.680
 And so one of the calculations in that paper,

2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:15.640
 back of the envelope, but I think revealing nonetheless,

2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:20.640
 is that if you take a relatively common asteroid,

2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:23.680
 something that's about a kilometer in diameter,

2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:26.720
 what I'm thinking of is just scrap material

2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:29.040
 laying around in our solar system

2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:31.440
 and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks

2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:33.360
 and turn each of those into a universe,

2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:38.120
 then you would have made at least a trillion black holes

2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:41.520
 outpacing the star production rate

2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:43.320
 by some three orders of magnitude.

2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:44.800
 That's one asteroid.

2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:46.840
 So now if you envision an intelligent species

2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.600
 that would potentially have been devised initially by humans,

2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:53.160
 but then based on superconducting

2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:55.200
 optoelectronic networks, no doubt,

2:35:55.200 --> 2:35:57.080
 and they go out and populate,

2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:58.960
 they don't have to fill the galaxy.

2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:01.680
 They just have to get out to the asteroid belt.

2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.240
 They could potentially dramatically outpace

2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:07.840
 the rate at which stars are producing offspring universes.

2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:10.640
 And then wouldn't you expect that

2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:13.080
 that's where we came from instead of a star?

2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:16.520
 Yeah, so you have to somehow become masters of gravity?

2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:17.840
 So like, or generate?

2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:18.680
 This is really gravity.

2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:20.600
 So stars make black holes with gravity,

2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:25.600
 but any force that can make the energy density

2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:30.040
 can compactify matter to produce a great enough energy density

2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:31.120
 can form a singularity.

2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:33.480
 It doesn't, it would not likely be gravity.

2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:34.480
 It's the weakest force.

2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:37.520
 You're more likely to use something like

2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:39.760
 the technologies that we're developing for fusion,

2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:40.600
 for example.

2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:45.440
 So I don't know, the large ignition facility recently

2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:50.440
 blasted a pellet with a hundred really bright lasers

2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:53.320
 and caused that to get dense enough

2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:55.240
 to engage in nuclear fusion.

2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:56.560
 So something more like that,

2:36:56.560 --> 2:36:58.680
 or a Tokamak with a really hot plasma,

2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:00.280
 I'm not sure, something,

2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:02.120
 I don't know exactly how it would be done.

2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:04.520
 I do like the idea of that,

2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:07.080
 especially just been reading a lot about gravitational waves

2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:11.680
 and the fact that us humans with our technological capabilities,

2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:15.800
 one of the most impressive technological accomplishments

2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:17.320
 of human history is LIGO,

2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:20.680
 be able to precisely detect gravitational waves.

2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:24.960
 I'm particularly find appealing the idea

2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:29.480
 that other alien civilizations from very far distances

2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:34.280
 communicate with gravity, with gravitational waves,

2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:37.720
 because as you become greater and greater master of gravity,

2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:40.560
 which seems way out of reach for us right now,

2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:44.040
 maybe that seems like an effective way of sending signals,

2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:48.360
 especially if your job is to manufacture black holes.

2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:49.200
 Right.

2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:51.760
 So let me ask there,

2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:56.360
 whatever, I mean broadly thinking,

2:37:56.360 --> 2:37:58.840
 because we tend to think other alien civilizations

2:37:58.840 --> 2:37:59.920
 would be very human like,

2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:04.000
 but if we think of alien civilizations out there

2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.600
 as basically generators of black holes,

2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:10.000
 however they do it, because they get stars,

2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:12.760
 do you think there's a lot of them

2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:15.720
 in our particular universe out there?

2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.200
 In our universe?

2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:23.320
 Well, okay, let me ask, okay, this is great.

2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:26.640
 Let me ask a very generic question

2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:29.160
 and then let's see how you answer it,

2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:34.040
 which is how many alien civilizations are out there?

2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:38.320
 If the hypothesis that I just described

2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:40.760
 is on the right track,

2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:43.840
 it would mean that the parameters of our universe

2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.400
 have been selected so that intelligent civilizations

2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:51.040
 will occur in sufficient numbers,

2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:54.680
 so that if they reach something

2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:56.400
 like supreme technological maturity,

2:38:56.400 --> 2:39:00.000
 let's define that as the ability to produce black holes,

2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.640
 then that's not a highly improbable event.

2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:05.360
 It doesn't need to happen often

2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:06.600
 because as I just described,

2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:09.120
 if you get one of them in a galaxy,

2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:10.440
 you're gonna make more black holes

2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:12.640
 than the stars in that galaxy.

2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:16.480
 But there's also not a super strong motivation,

2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:21.480
 well, it's not obvious that you need them

2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:24.040
 to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.

2:39:24.040 --> 2:39:27.520
 So one of the things that I try to emphasize in that paper

2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:32.520
 is that given this idea of how our parameters

2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:35.120
 might have been selected,

2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:39.280
 it's clear that it's a series of trade offs, right?

2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:42.040
 If you make, I mean, in order for intelligent life

2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:45.720
 of our variety or anything resembling us to occur,

2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:47.600
 you need a bunch of stuff, you need stars.

2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:51.080
 So that's right back to Smollin's roots of this idea,

2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:54.480
 but you also need water to have certain properties.

2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:58.800
 You need things like the rocky planets,

2:39:58.800 --> 2:40:00.640
 like the Earth to be within the habitable zone,

2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:02.720
 all these things that you start talking about

2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:06.800
 in the field of astrobiology,

2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:08.840
 trying to understand life in the universe.

2:40:08.840 --> 2:40:10.560
 But you can't over emphasize,

2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:13.640
 you can't tune the parameters so precisely

2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:15.200
 to maximize the number of stars

2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:19.000
 or to give water exactly the properties

2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.280
 or to make rocky planets like Earth the most numerous.

2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:24.520
 You have to compromise on all these things.

2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:27.360
 And so I think the way to test this idea

2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:30.240
 is to look at what parameters are necessary

2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:32.760
 for each of these different subsystems.

2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:34.880
 And I've laid out a few that I think are promising.

2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:36.680
 There could be countless others.

2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:40.840
 And see how changing the parameters

2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:43.600
 makes it more or less likely that stars would form

2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:46.320
 and have long lifetimes or that rocky planets

2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:48.280
 in the habitable zone are likely to form,

2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:49.400
 all these different things.

2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:52.160
 So we can test how much these things

2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:54.560
 are in a tug of war with each other.

2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:56.280
 And the prediction would be

2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:58.160
 that we kind of sit at the central point

2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.040
 where if you move the parameters too much,

2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:05.680
 stars aren't stable or life doesn't form

2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:07.720
 or technology is infeasible.

2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:10.760
 Cause life alone, at least the kind of life

2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.160
 that we know of, cannot make black holes.

2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:16.920
 We don't have this, well, I'm speaking for myself.

2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:18.520
 You're a very fit, strong person,

2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:20.560
 but it might be possible for you,

2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:22.320
 but not for me to compress matter.

2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:23.800
 So we need these technologies,

2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:28.800
 but we don't know, we have not been able to quantify yet

2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:33.760
 how finely adjusted the parameters would need to be

2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:35.520
 in order for silicon to have the properties it does.

2:41:35.520 --> 2:41:37.760
 Okay, this is not directly speaking to what you're saying.

2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:39.480
 You're getting to the Fermi paradox,

2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:40.640
 which is where are they?

2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:42.800
 Where are the life forms out there?

2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:43.800
 How numerous are they?

2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:44.640
 That sort of thing.

2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:49.120
 What I'm trying to argue is that if this framework

2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:50.800
 is on the right track,

2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:53.760
 a potentially correct explanation for our existence,

2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:56.360
 we, it doesn't necessarily predict

2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:59.320
 that intelligent civilizations are just everywhere

2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:02.560
 because even if you just get one of them in a galaxy,

2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:05.800
 which is quite rare, it could be enough

2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:08.640
 to dramatically increase the fecundity

2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:10.160
 of the universe as a whole.

2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:12.480
 Yeah, and I wonder once you start generating

2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:15.420
 the offspring for universes, black holes,

2:42:15.420 --> 2:42:18.400
 how that has effect on the,

2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:19.960
 what kind of effect does it have

2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:24.960
 on the other candidates, civilizations within that universe?

2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:28.440
 Maybe it has a destructive aspect,

2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:30.160
 or there could be some arguments about

2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:32.080
 once you have a lot of offspring

2:42:32.080 --> 2:42:34.080
 that that just quickly accelerates

2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:35.800
 to where the other ones can't even catch up.

2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:40.800
 It could, but I guess if you want me to put my chips

2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:42.560
 on the table or whatever,

2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:45.400
 I think I come down more on the side

2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:51.320
 that intelligent life civilizations are rare.

2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:57.160
 And I guess I follow Max Tegmark here.

2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:01.040
 And also there's a lot of papers coming out recently

2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:04.360
 in the field of astrobiology that are seeming to say,

2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.040
 all right, you just work through the numbers

2:43:06.040 --> 2:43:09.680
 on some modified Drake equation or something like that.

2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:12.960
 And it looks like it's not improbable.

2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:15.000
 You shouldn't be surprised

2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:17.960
 that an intelligent species has arisen in our galaxy,

2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:19.160
 but if you think there's one,

2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:21.520
 the next solar system over, it's highly improbable.

2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:24.840
 So I can see that the probability

2:43:24.840 --> 2:43:28.240
 of finding a civilization in a galaxy,

2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:31.000
 maybe it's most likely that you're gonna find

2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:32.820
 one to a hundred or something.

2:43:32.820 --> 2:43:34.880
 But okay, now it's really important

2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:36.640
 to put a time window on that, I think,

2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:40.080
 because does that mean in the entire lifetime

2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:45.160
 of the galaxy, so for in our case,

2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:47.040
 before we run into Andromeda?

2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:53.000
 I think it's highly probable, I shouldn't say I think,

2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:56.760
 it's tempting to believe that it's highly probable

2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:00.000
 that in that entire lifetime of your galaxy,

2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.600
 you're gonna get at least one intelligent species,

2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:05.160
 maybe thousands or something like that.

2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:09.960
 But it's also, I think a little bit naive

2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:13.200
 to think that they're going to coincide in time

2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:14.960
 and we'll be able to observe them.

2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:19.960
 And also, if you look at the span of life on Earth,

2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:24.440
 the Earth history, it was surprising to me

2:44:24.440 --> 2:44:27.840
 to kind of look at the amount of time,

2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:29.680
 first of all, the short amount of time

2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:31.520
 there's no life is surprising.

2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:33.480
 Life sprang up pretty quickly.

2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:35.000
 Cellular, single cell.

2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:36.960
 What that was, that's the point I'm trying to make

2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.960
 is like so much of life on Earth

2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:45.840
 was just like single cell organisms, like most of it.

2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:48.640
 Most of it is like boring bacteria type of stuff.

2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:50.680
 Well, bacteria are fascinating, but I take your point.

2:44:50.680 --> 2:44:52.920
 No, I get it, I mean, no offense to them.

2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:57.640
 This kind of speaking from the perspective of your paper

2:44:57.640 --> 2:45:00.040
 of something that's able to generate technologies,

2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:01.440
 we kind of understand it,

2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:05.480
 that's a very short moment in time relative to that,

2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:08.680
 that full history of life on Earth.

2:45:08.680 --> 2:45:12.240
 And maybe our universe is just saturated

2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:15.880
 with bacteria like humans.

2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:16.720
 Right.

2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:22.520
 But not the special extra AGI superhumans

2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:25.560
 that those are very rare.

2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:28.440
 And once those spring up,

2:45:28.440 --> 2:45:33.360
 everything just goes to, it accelerates very quickly.

2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:36.520
 Yeah, we just don't have enough data to really say,

2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:40.000
 but I find this whole subject extremely engaging.

2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:41.680
 I mean, there's this concept,

2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:43.880
 I think it's called the rare Earth hypothesis,

2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:46.920
 which is that basically stating that,

2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:49.040
 okay, microbes were here right away

2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:52.120
 after the Hadean era where we were being bombarded.

2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:54.920
 Well, after bombarded by comets, asteroids,

2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:57.080
 things like that, and also after the moon formed.

2:45:57.080 --> 2:45:59.520
 So once things settled down a little bit,

2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:03.640
 in a few hundred million years, you have microbes everywhere.

2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:05.320
 And it could have been, we don't know exactly when,

2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:08.040
 it could have been remarkably brief that that took.

2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:12.120
 So it does indicate that, okay, life forms relatively easily.

2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:15.880
 I think that alone is sort of a checker on the scale

2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:20.880
 for the argument that the parameters that allow,

2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:24.320
 even microbial life to form are not just a fluke,

2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:27.480
 but anyway, that aside, yes,

2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:30.640
 then there was this long dormant period, not dormant,

2:46:30.640 --> 2:46:34.080
 things were happening, but important things were happening

2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:37.280
 for some two and a half billion years or something

2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:41.640
 after the metabolic process that releases oxygen

2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:46.080
 was developed, then basically the planet's just sitting there

2:46:46.080 --> 2:46:47.520
 getting more and more oxygenated,

2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:50.160
 more and more oxygenated until it's enough

2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:54.120
 that you can build these large complex organisms.

2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:56.920
 And so the rare earth hypothesis would argue that

2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:01.800
 the microbes are common and everywhere in any planet

2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:04.120
 that's like roughly in the habitable zone

2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:06.600
 and has some water on it's probably gonna have those.

2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:09.280
 But then getting to this Cambrian explosion

2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:13.720
 that happened some between five and 600 million years ago,

2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:16.320
 that's rare, you know?

2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:19.040
 And I buy that, I think that is rare.

2:47:19.040 --> 2:47:21.840
 So if you say how much life is in our galaxy,

2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:24.080
 I think that's probably the right answer

2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:26.400
 is that microbes are everywhere,

2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:29.280
 Cambrian explosion is extremely rare.

2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:32.720
 And then, but the Cambrian explosion kind of went like that

2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:37.720
 where within a couple tens or 100 million years,

2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:40.920
 all of these body plans came into existence

2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:43.040
 and basically all of the body plans

2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:46.040
 that are now in existence on the planet

2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:48.680
 were formed in that brief window

2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:51.600
 and we've just been shuffling around since then.

2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:54.800
 So then what caused humans to pop out of that?

2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:59.800
 I mean, that could be another extremely rare threshold

2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:06.200
 that a planet roughly in the habitable zone with water

2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:08.400
 is not guaranteed to cross, you know?

2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:10.240
 To me, it's fascinating if we're being humble,

2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:13.080
 like the humans cannot possibly be the most amazing thing

2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.880
 that such, if you look at the entirety of the system,

2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:17.800
 that least small and you paint,

2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:20.080
 that cannot possibly be the most amazing thing

2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:21.480
 that process generates.

2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:23.720
 So like if you look at the evolution,

2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:27.040
 what's the equivalent in the cosmological evolution

2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:29.000
 and its selection for technology,

2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.440
 the equivalent of the human eye or the human brain?

2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:35.600
 Universes that are able to do some like,

2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:37.760
 they don't need the damn stars,

2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:42.120
 they're able to just do some incredible generation

2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:46.640
 of complexity fast on like much more than,

2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:49.040
 if you think about, it's like most of our universe

2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:50.920
 is pretty freaking boring.

2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:51.960
 There's not much going on,

2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:53.400
 there's a few rocks flying around

2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:58.400
 and there's some like apes that are just like doing podcasts.

2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:02.880
 On some weird planet, it just seems very inefficient.

2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:05.360
 If you think about like the amazing thing,

2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:06.840
 the human eye, the visual cortex,

2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:09.440
 can do the brain, the nervousness,

2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:12.880
 everything that makes us more powerful

2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:15.520
 than single cell organisms.

2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:19.000
 Like if there's an equivalent of that for universes,

2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:21.720
 they're like the richness of physics

2:49:21.720 --> 2:49:24.680
 that could be expressed

2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:26.880
 through a particular set of parameters.

2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:31.080
 Like, I mean, like for me,

2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:33.800
 I'm sort of from a computer science perspective,

2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:35.640
 huge fan of cellular automata,

2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:39.360
 which is a nice sort of pretty visual way

2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:42.840
 to illustrate how different laws can result

2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:46.440
 in drastically different levels of complexity.

2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:49.000
 So like, it's like, yeah, okay.

2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.280
 So we're all like celebrating,

2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:52.080
 look, our little cellular automata

2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:54.520
 is able to generate pretty triangles and squares

2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:57.560
 and therefore we achieve general intelligence.

2:49:57.560 --> 2:50:01.840
 And then there'll be like some badass Chuck Norris type,

2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.520
 like universal touring machine type of cellular automata.

2:50:06.520 --> 2:50:09.520
 They're able to generate other cellular automata

2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:13.040
 that does any arbitrary level of computation off the bat.

2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:16.440
 Like those have to then exist.

2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:17.880
 And then we're just like,

2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:20.840
 we're just, we'll be forgotten is the story.

2:50:20.840 --> 2:50:24.880
 This podcast just entertains a few other apes

2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:26.880
 for a few months.

2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:30.320
 Well, I'm kind of surprised to hear your cynicism.

2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:32.080
 No, I'm very up.

2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:36.120
 I usually think of you as like a one who celebrates humanity

2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:37.600
 and all its forms and things like that.

2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:41.000
 And I guess I just, I don't see it the way you just described.

2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.520
 I mean, okay, we've been here for 13.7 billion years

2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:47.240
 and you're saying, gosh, that's a long time.

2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:48.480
 Let's get on with the show already.

2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:51.480
 Some other universe could have kicked our butt by now,

2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:55.320
 but that's putting a characteristic time.

2:50:55.320 --> 2:50:58.360
 I mean, why is 13.7 billion a long time?

2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:00.400
 I mean, compared to what?

2:51:00.400 --> 2:51:02.280
 I guess, so when I look at our universe,

2:51:02.280 --> 2:51:05.400
 I see this extraordinary hierarchy

2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:08.040
 that has developed over that time.

2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:11.640
 So at the beginning, it was a chaotic mess of,

2:51:11.640 --> 2:51:16.040
 you know, some plasma and nothing interesting going on there.

2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:18.880
 And even for the first stars to form,

2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:23.880
 that a lot of really interesting evolutionary processes

2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:26.240
 had to occur by evolutionary in that sense.

2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:30.520
 I just mean taking place over extended periods of time

2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:32.000
 and structures are forming then.

2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.640
 And then it took that first generation of stars

2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:39.640
 in order to produce the metals that then can more efficiently

2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:42.440
 produce another generation of stars.

2:51:42.440 --> 2:51:44.720
 We're only the third generation of stars.

2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:47.920
 So we might still be pretty quick to the game here.

2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:51.000
 So, but I don't think, I don't, okay.

2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:52.440
 So then you have these stars

2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:54.640
 and then you have solar systems on those solar systems.

2:51:54.640 --> 2:51:57.800
 You have rocky worlds.

2:51:57.800 --> 2:51:59.800
 You have gas giants, like all this complexity.

2:51:59.800 --> 2:52:01.120
 And then you start getting life

2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:04.880
 and the complexity that's evolved through the evolutionary

2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:07.600
 process in life forms is just,

2:52:07.600 --> 2:52:09.840
 it's not a let down to me.

2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:10.680
 Just some of it.

2:52:10.680 --> 2:52:12.720
 And there's some of it is like some of the planets

2:52:12.720 --> 2:52:16.080
 is like icy, it's like different flavors of ice cream.

2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:18.560
 They're icy, but there might be water underneath.

2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:21.120
 All kinds of life forms with some volcanoes.

2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:22.320
 All kinds of weird stuff.

2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:24.600
 No, no, no, I don't, I think it's beautiful.

2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:25.920
 I think our life is beautiful.

2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:29.560
 And I think it was designed that by design,

2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:31.200
 the scarcity of the whole thing,

2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:33.840
 I think mortality as terrifying as it is

2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:37.280
 is fundamental to the whole reason we enjoy everything.

2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:38.200
 No, I think it's beautiful.

2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:42.400
 I just think that all of us conscious beings

2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:44.600
 in the grand scheme of basically

2:52:44.600 --> 2:52:46.960
 at every scale will be completely forgotten.

2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:47.800
 Well, that's true.

2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:49.320
 I think everything is transient.

2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:52.520
 And that would go back to maybe something more like Lao Tzu,

2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:55.440
 the Dao De Jing or something where it's like,

2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:57.720
 yes, there is nothing but change.

2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:00.720
 There is nothing but emergence and dissolve and that's it.

2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:04.520
 But just in this picture of this hierarchy that's developed,

2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:06.600
 I don't mean to say that now it gets to us

2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:07.440
 and that's the pinnacle.

2:53:07.440 --> 2:53:10.520
 In fact, I think at a high level,

2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:14.240
 the story I'm trying to tease out in my research is about,

2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:17.040
 okay, well, so then what's the next level of hierarchy?

2:53:17.040 --> 2:53:21.520
 And if it's, okay, we're kind of pretty smart.

2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:23.280
 I mean, talking about people like

2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:25.240
 Lee Small and Alan Gooth, Max Tagmark,

2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:26.760
 okay, we're really smart, talking about me.

2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:28.480
 Okay, we're kind of,

2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:30.760
 we can find our way to the grocery store or whatever,

2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:32.760
 but what's next?

2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:35.440
 You know, I mean, what if there's another level

2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:37.760
 of hierarchy that grows on top of us

2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:40.280
 that is even more profoundly capable?

2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:42.080
 And I mean, we've talked a lot

2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:43.560
 about superconducting sensors.

2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:48.560
 Imagine these cognitive systems far more capable than us

2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:52.320
 residing somewhere else in the solar system

2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:53.640
 off of the surface of the earth

2:53:53.640 --> 2:53:55.400
 where it's much darker, much colder,

2:53:55.400 --> 2:53:57.080
 much more naturally suited to them.

2:53:57.080 --> 2:53:59.360
 And they have these sensors that can detect

2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:02.640
 single photons of light from radio waves

2:54:02.640 --> 2:54:05.200
 out to all across the spectrum to gamma rays

2:54:05.200 --> 2:54:07.400
 and just see the whole universe.

2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:09.960
 And they just live in space with these massive

2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:12.920
 collection optics so that they,

2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:13.760
 what did they do?

2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:18.760
 They just look out and experience that vast array

2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:22.520
 of what's being developed.

2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:26.160
 And if you're such a system, presumably,

2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:28.960
 you would do some things for fun.

2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:31.800
 And the kind of fun thing I would do

2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:33.880
 as somebody who likes video games

2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:37.080
 is I would create and maintain

2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:39.400
 and observe something like earth.

2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:43.760
 And so in some sense,

2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:47.360
 we're like all what players on a stage

2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:49.960
 for this superconducting

2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:54.200
 cold computing system out there.

2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:56.720
 I mean, all of this is fascinating to think.

2:54:56.720 --> 2:54:59.520
 The fact that you're actually designing systems here

2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:01.760
 on earth, they're trying to push this technological,

2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:03.400
 at the very cutting edge.

2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:06.200
 And also thinking about how does the,

2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:09.800
 like the evolution of physical laws

2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:12.480
 lead us to the way we are.

2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:14.200
 It's fascinating.

2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:15.960
 That coupling is fascinating.

2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:20.800
 It's like the ultimate rigorous application of philosophy

2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:23.680
 to the rigorous application of engineering.

2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:26.200
 So I, Jeff, you're one of the most fascinating.

2:55:26.200 --> 2:55:29.000
 I'm so glad I did not know much about you

2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:30.560
 except through your work.

2:55:30.560 --> 2:55:34.200
 And I'm so glad we got this chance to talk.

2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:37.760
 You're one of the best explainers

2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:39.800
 of exceptionally difficult concepts.

2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:44.560
 And you're also the, speaking of like fractal,

2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:46.680
 you're able to function intellectually

2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:50.160
 at all levels of the stack, which I deeply appreciate.

2:55:50.160 --> 2:55:51.600
 This was really fun.

2:55:51.600 --> 2:55:53.520
 You're a great educator, a great scientist.

2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:57.200
 It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.

2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:00.080
 It's an honor that you would spend your time with me as well.

2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:00.920
 Thanks, Jeff.

2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.560
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:05.200
 with Jeff Shaneline.

2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:06.680
 To support this podcast,

2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:09.560
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:12.040
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:15.960
 from the great John Carmack, who surely will be a guest

2:56:15.960 --> 2:56:17.280
 on this podcast soon.

2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:20.080
 Because of the nature of Moore's Law,

2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:22.800
 anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer

2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:26.040
 can do at one point can be replicated

2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:29.380
 by a merely competent programmer some number of years later.

2:56:29.380 --> 2:56:41.540
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
