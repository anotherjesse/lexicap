WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
 We think that self assembly,

00:01.760 --> 00:04.760
 this modular reconfigurable algorithm

00:04.760 --> 00:07.520
 for constructing space structures in orbit

00:07.520 --> 00:10.760
 is gonna give us this promise of space architecture

00:10.760 --> 00:12.320
 that's actually worth living in.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.480
 You see, you do believe we might one day

00:14.480 --> 00:17.920
 become intergalactic civilization.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.040
 I have a hope, yeah.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.240
 The following is a conversation with Ariel Agblah,

00:24.240 --> 00:27.400
 Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.120
 She's especially interested in autonomously

00:30.120 --> 00:32.680
 self assembling space architectures.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.880
 Basically, giant space structures

00:35.880 --> 00:37.680
 that can sustain human life

00:37.680 --> 00:40.400
 and that assemble themselves out in space

00:40.400 --> 00:45.400
 and then orbit Earth, Moon, Mars, and other planets.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.280
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.480
 To support it, we check out our sponsors in the description

00:51.480 --> 00:55.400
 and now dear friends, here's Ariel Agblah.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.160
 When did you first fall in love

00:58.160 --> 01:01.280
 with space exploration and space in general?

01:01.280 --> 01:04.120
 My parents are both ex Air Force.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.880
 So my dad's an A10 fighter pilot

01:05.880 --> 01:09.680
 and my mom trained and had qualified to be a fighter pilot

01:09.680 --> 01:11.000
 but it was early enough

01:11.000 --> 01:13.400
 that women were not allowed in combat at that time.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.360
 And so I grew up with these two pilots

01:16.360 --> 01:18.640
 and although they themselves did not become astronauts,

01:18.640 --> 01:20.960
 there's a really rich legacy of Air Force pilots

01:20.960 --> 01:24.280
 becoming astronauts and this loomed large in my childhood.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.760
 What does it mean to be courageous, to be an explorer,

01:26.760 --> 01:31.680
 to be at the vanguard of something hard and challenging

01:31.680 --> 01:32.920
 and to couple with that,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.080
 my dad was a huge fan of science fiction.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.760
 And so I as a kid read Heinlein and Isaac Asimov,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.240
 all these different classics of science fiction

01:41.240 --> 01:42.520
 that he had introduced me to.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.920
 And that just started a love affair with space exploration

01:45.920 --> 01:49.640
 and really thinking about civilization scale,

01:49.640 --> 01:50.760
 space exploration.

01:50.760 --> 01:55.760
 So did they themselves dream about going to the stars

01:56.400 --> 01:59.800
 as opposed to flying here in the Earth's atmosphere,

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
 just looking up?

02:00.800 --> 02:01.640
 Yeah.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.160
 My dad always said he was absolutely convinced

02:03.160 --> 02:05.200
 because he was a child of the Apollo years

02:05.200 --> 02:07.480
 that he would get to go in his lifetime.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.960
 I really thought it was gonna happen.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.000
 And so it was a challenge and sad for many people

02:12.000 --> 02:14.160
 and to their view on the outside,

02:14.160 --> 02:16.960
 space exploration slowed down for a period of time.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.560
 In reality, we were just catching up.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.960
 I think we leapt so far ahead with Apollo

02:21.960 --> 02:24.160
 more than the rest of society was ready for.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.520
 And now we're coming back to this moment

02:26.520 --> 02:28.960
 for space exploration where we actually have an economy

02:28.960 --> 02:31.680
 and we have the other accoutrement that society needs

02:31.680 --> 02:33.880
 to be able to make space exploration more real.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.880
 And my dad's thrilled because finally,

02:35.880 --> 02:38.840
 not nearly, I hope not anywhere near the end of his life,

02:38.840 --> 02:39.680
 but as he's an older man,

02:39.680 --> 02:43.360
 he now can see still within his lifetime,

02:43.360 --> 02:44.400
 people really getting a chance

02:44.400 --> 02:46.760
 to build a sustainable lunar settlement on the moon

02:46.760 --> 02:48.680
 or maybe even go to Mars.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.480
 So settlement, civilizations and other planets,

02:51.480 --> 02:54.840
 that's the cool thing to dream about in the future.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.160
 It really is.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.880
 What was the favorite sci fi author when you're growing up?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.920
 Probably Aztec Asimov Foundation Trilogy.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.600
 This is an amazing story of Harry Selden,

03:04.600 --> 03:08.440
 this foundation that he forms at different ends of the,

03:08.440 --> 03:10.040
 well, according to the story,

03:10.040 --> 03:11.800
 different ends of the universe

03:11.800 --> 03:16.640
 and has this interesting focus on society.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.000
 So it's not just space exploration

03:19.000 --> 03:21.280
 for the sake of space exploration or novel technology,

03:21.280 --> 03:23.760
 which is a lot of what I work on, data, data, MIT,

03:23.760 --> 03:26.760
 but how do you structure a society

03:27.760 --> 03:31.360
 across those vast expanses of distance and time?

03:31.360 --> 03:33.480
 And so I'd say absolutely a favorite.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.880
 Now though, my favorite is Neil Stevenson and Seven Eves.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.440
 It's a book that inspired my own PhD research

03:40.440 --> 03:42.920
 and some ongoing work that we're doing with NASA now

03:42.920 --> 03:46.480
 for the future of swarm robotics for spacecraft.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.600
 We were saying offline about Neil Stevenson

03:49.600 --> 03:51.480
 because I just recently had a conversation with him

03:51.480 --> 03:54.560
 and I said that, not until I was doing the research form

03:54.560 --> 03:59.560
 that I realized he also had a role to play in Blue Origin.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.680
 So it's like sci fi actually having a role to play

04:02.680 --> 04:06.000
 in the design, engineering,

04:06.000 --> 04:07.560
 just the implementation of ideas

04:07.560 --> 04:10.800
 that come kind of percolate up from the sci fi world

04:10.800 --> 04:11.920
 and actually become reality.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.440
 It's kind of a fascinating figure in that way.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.680
 So do you also think about him beyond just his work

04:18.680 --> 04:19.600
 in science fiction,

04:19.600 --> 04:22.840
 but his role in coming up with wild, crazy ideas

04:22.840 --> 04:24.160
 that actually become reality?

04:24.160 --> 04:26.840
 Yes, I think it's a great example of this cycle

04:26.840 --> 04:29.960
 between authors and scientists and engineers

04:29.960 --> 04:32.080
 that we can be inspired in one generation

04:32.080 --> 04:33.880
 by what authors dream up.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.720
 We build it, we make it a reality,

04:35.720 --> 04:37.400
 and then that inspires another generation

04:37.400 --> 04:40.520
 of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.240
 I think Neil Stevenson does a beautiful job

04:42.240 --> 04:44.720
 of being what we'd call a hard science fiction author.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.480
 So it's really grounded in a lot of science,

04:46.480 --> 04:47.920
 which makes it very compelling for me

04:47.920 --> 04:50.120
 as a scientist and engineer to read

04:50.120 --> 04:53.240
 and then be challenged to make that vision of reality.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.080
 The other community that Neil's involved with

04:56.080 --> 04:57.600
 and some of my other mentors are involved with

04:57.600 --> 04:59.920
 that we are thinking about more and more

04:59.920 --> 05:01.520
 in the work that we do at MIT

05:01.520 --> 05:06.240
 is the long now foundation and this focus

05:06.240 --> 05:09.760
 on what does society need to take in terms of steps

05:09.760 --> 05:13.520
 at this juncture, this particular inflection point

05:13.520 --> 05:15.920
 in human history to make sure that we're setting ourselves

05:15.920 --> 05:18.800
 up for a long and prosperous horizon,

05:18.800 --> 05:20.440
 for humanities horizons.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.360
 There's a lot of examples

05:21.360 --> 05:23.840
 of what the long now foundation doesn't think about.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.520
 But when I think about this in my own work,

05:25.520 --> 05:30.520
 it's what does it take to scale humanities presence in orbit?

05:31.720 --> 05:34.200
 We are seeing some additional investment

05:34.200 --> 05:36.280
 in commercial space habitats,

05:36.280 --> 05:37.640
 so it'll no longer be just NASA

05:37.640 --> 05:39.400
 running the International Space Station,

05:39.400 --> 05:42.080
 but to really democratize access to space

05:42.080 --> 05:44.520
 to have like Bezos wants to have millions of people

05:44.520 --> 05:46.000
 living and working in space.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.440
 You need architecture that's bigger and grander

05:49.440 --> 05:50.920
 and can actually scale.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.080
 That means you need to be thinking about

05:52.080 --> 05:55.080
 how can you construct things for long time horizons

05:55.080 --> 05:56.720
 that are really sustainable in orbit

05:56.720 --> 05:59.440
 or on a surface of a celestial body

05:59.440 --> 06:02.160
 that are bigger than the biggest rocket payload fairing

06:02.160 --> 06:03.440
 that we currently have available.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.400
 And that what led me to self assembly

06:05.400 --> 06:08.280
 and other models of in space construction.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.600
 Okay, every time you speak,

06:10.600 --> 06:12.360
 I get like a million tangent ideas,

06:12.360 --> 06:15.280
 but no, no, no, no, no, no, please keep talking.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.160
 This is amazing.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.120
 I just, there's like a million of ideas.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.840
 So one sort of on the dark side, let me ask,

06:21.840 --> 06:25.080
 do you think about the threats to human civilization

06:25.080 --> 06:28.960
 that kind of motivate the scaling of the expansion

06:28.960 --> 06:31.760
 of humans in space and on other planets?

06:31.760 --> 06:32.880
 What are you worried about?

06:32.880 --> 06:37.680
 Nuclear war, pandemics, super intelligent,

06:37.680 --> 06:39.720
 artificial intelligence systems,

06:40.880 --> 06:44.160
 more not existential crises,

06:44.160 --> 06:46.440
 but ones that have significant,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.800
 potentially significant detrimental effects on society

06:48.800 --> 06:51.080
 like climate change, those kinds of things.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.360
 And then there's of course the fun S story coming out

06:53.360 --> 06:55.480
 from the darkness and hitting all earth.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.120
 There's been a few movies on that.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.360
 Anyway, guys, there's something that you think about

07:00.360 --> 07:02.320
 that threatens us in this century.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.600
 I mean, as an ex military family,

07:04.600 --> 07:06.480
 we used to talk about all of this.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.920
 We would say that luck favors the prepared.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.240
 And so growing up, we had a plan,

07:12.240 --> 07:14.560
 actually a family plan for what we would do in a pandemic.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.640
 Didn't think we were going to have to put that

07:15.640 --> 07:17.600
 and plan into place and here we are.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.880
 We do certainly, among my own family and my friends

07:20.880 --> 07:21.920
 and then our work at MIT,

07:21.920 --> 07:24.960
 we do think about existential threats and risks to humanity

07:24.960 --> 07:27.360
 and what role does space exploration

07:27.360 --> 07:29.280
 and getting humans off world have to play

07:29.280 --> 07:32.160
 in a resilient future for humanity.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.480
 But what I actually find more compelling recently

07:35.480 --> 07:40.480
 is instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon earth

07:40.600 --> 07:43.040
 through a path of space exploration or space foraging,

07:43.040 --> 07:44.920
 is to see how we can use space technology

07:44.920 --> 07:47.320
 to keep earth livable.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.480
 The obvious direct ways of doing this would be satellite

07:50.480 --> 07:52.360
 technology that's helping us learn more

07:52.360 --> 07:56.320
 about climate change or emitters or CO2.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.200
 But there's also a future for geoengineering

07:58.200 --> 07:59.640
 that might be space based.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.920
 A lot of questions that would have to be answered around that.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.320
 But these are examples of pivoting our focus away

08:05.320 --> 08:07.200
 from maybe the Hollywood vision of oh,

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
 an asteroid's going to come,

08:08.200 --> 08:09.960
 we're all going to have to escape earth to,

08:09.960 --> 08:14.440
 let's use our considerable technology prowess

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
 and use space technology to save earth

08:16.440 --> 08:19.880
 and be very much focused on how we can have a worthwhile life

08:19.880 --> 08:22.160
 for earth citizens, even as some of us go,

08:22.160 --> 08:24.040
 want to go out and for their venturing.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.080
 Right, just the desire to explore the mysterious, yes.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.520
 But also it does seem that by placing us

08:31.520 --> 08:33.880
 in harsh conditions, the harsh conditions of space,

08:33.880 --> 08:35.720
 the harsh conditions of planets,

08:35.720 --> 08:38.040
 on the biology, the chemistry, the engineering,

08:38.040 --> 08:41.560
 the robotics, the materials, all of that,

08:41.560 --> 08:43.960
 that's just a nice way to come up with cool new things.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.200
 Great forcing function, yeah.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.280
 Yeah, it's a forcing, exactly.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.000
 It's a forcing function like survival.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
 You don't get this right, you die.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.440
 So, and that you can bring back to earth

08:53.440 --> 08:57.960
 and it will improve like figuring out food and space

08:57.960 --> 09:02.960
 will make you figure out how to live healthier lives

09:02.960 --> 09:04.120
 here on earth.

09:04.120 --> 09:04.960
 So true.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.880
 I mean, some of the technologies

09:05.880 --> 09:08.640
 that we're directly looking at right now

09:08.640 --> 09:12.040
 for space habitats, it's hard to keep humans alive

09:12.040 --> 09:15.600
 in this really fragile little pocket against the vacuum

09:15.600 --> 09:19.040
 and all of the dangers that the space environment presents.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.880
 Some of the technologies we are gonna have to figure out

09:20.880 --> 09:24.640
 is energy efficient, cooling and air conditioning,

09:25.520 --> 09:28.880
 air filtration, scrubbing CO2 from the air,

09:28.880 --> 09:33.880
 being able to have habitats that are themselves resilient

09:34.240 --> 09:36.320
 to extremes of space weather and radiation.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.360
 And some of these are direct translational opportunities

09:39.360 --> 09:41.680
 for areas from financial disasters.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.160
 People in California a decade ago

09:43.160 --> 09:45.840
 would never have had to think about having an airtight house.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.160
 But now with wildfires,

09:47.160 --> 09:50.400
 maybe you do want something close to an airtight house.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.520
 How do you manage that?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.760
 There's a lot of technologies

09:52.760 --> 09:55.080
 from the space habitation world

09:55.080 --> 09:57.040
 that we are hoping we can actually bring back down

09:57.040 --> 09:58.680
 to benefit life on earth as well

09:58.680 --> 10:01.240
 in these extreme environment contexts.

10:01.240 --> 10:05.400
 Okay, so you mentioned to go back to Swarm.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.560
 Mm, yeah.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.120
 So that was interesting to you.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.400
 First of all, in your own work,

10:10.400 --> 10:12.640
 but also I believe you said something

10:12.640 --> 10:14.920
 that was inspiring from you Stevenson as well.

10:14.920 --> 10:19.920
 So when you say Swarm, are you thinking about architectures

10:23.280 --> 10:25.360
 or are you thinking about artificial intelligence

10:25.360 --> 10:28.360
 like robotics or are those kind of intermixed?

10:28.360 --> 10:30.200
 I think the future that we're seeing

10:30.200 --> 10:31.760
 is that they're going to be intermixed,

10:31.760 --> 10:33.160
 which is really exciting.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.240
 So the future of space habitats

10:35.240 --> 10:38.560
 are one of intelligent structures,

10:38.560 --> 10:39.960
 maybe not all the way to how

10:39.960 --> 10:42.480
 and the 2001 Space Odyssey reference

10:42.480 --> 10:44.520
 that scares people about the habitat

10:44.520 --> 10:45.840
 having a mind of its own.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.840
 But certainly we're building systems now

10:47.840 --> 10:51.800
 where the habitat has sensing technology

10:51.800 --> 10:56.360
 that allows it to communicate its basic functions,

10:56.360 --> 10:58.360
 maintaining life support for the astronauts,

10:58.360 --> 11:01.520
 but could also communicate in symbiosis

11:01.520 --> 11:03.280
 with these Swarm robots

11:03.280 --> 11:05.960
 that would be on the outside of the spacecraft,

11:05.960 --> 11:08.200
 whether it's in a microgravity orbiting environment

11:08.200 --> 11:09.240
 or on the surface.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.200
 And these little robots, they crawl,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.360
 just a la Neil Stevenson in 70s,

11:13.360 --> 11:15.520
 they crawl along the outside of the spacecraft

11:15.520 --> 11:18.200
 looking for micrometeorite punctures

11:18.200 --> 11:21.640
 or gas leaks or other faults and defects.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.040
 And right now we're just working on the diagnosis.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.240
 So can the Swarm with its collective intelligence

11:27.240 --> 11:30.200
 act in symbiosis with the spacecraft and detect things?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.280
 But in the future, we'd also love

11:31.280 --> 11:34.120
 for these little micro robots to repair in situ

11:34.120 --> 11:37.600
 and really be like ants living in a tree

11:37.600 --> 11:39.480
 altogether connected to the spacecraft.

11:39.480 --> 11:44.280
 Do you envision the system to be fully distributed?

11:44.280 --> 11:45.800
 And just like an ant colony,

11:45.800 --> 11:50.600
 if one of them is damaged or, you know, whatever,

11:51.920 --> 11:53.520
 loses control and all those kinds of things

11:53.520 --> 11:57.360
 that doesn't affect the performance of the complete system

11:57.360 --> 11:59.000
 or doesn't need to be centralized.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.200
 This is more like almost like a technical question.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.040
 Do you think we could...

12:02.040 --> 12:03.080
 Good architecture question.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.920
 Right, from the ground up,

12:05.920 --> 12:08.840
 it's so scary to go fully distributed.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.160
 Yes.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.720
 But it's also exceptionally powerful, right?

12:12.720 --> 12:15.880
 A robust, resilient to the harsh conditions of space.

12:15.880 --> 12:20.880
 Where do you, if you look into the next 10, 20, 100 years

12:20.880 --> 12:23.480
 starting from scratch,

12:23.480 --> 12:24.640
 do you think we should be doing

12:24.640 --> 12:27.240
 architecturalized distributed systems?

12:28.080 --> 12:31.320
 For space, yes, because it gives you this redundancy

12:31.320 --> 12:33.400
 and safety profile that's really critical.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.200
 So whether it's small swarm robots,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.360
 where it doesn't matter if you lose a few of them,

12:37.360 --> 12:42.360
 to habitats that instead of having a central monolithic habitat,

12:43.880 --> 12:45.840
 you might actually be able to have

12:45.840 --> 12:49.120
 a decentralized node of a space station

12:49.120 --> 12:51.000
 so that you can kind of write out a Star Wars.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.360
 You can shut a blast door if there's a fire

12:53.360 --> 12:55.120
 or if there's a conflict in a certain area

12:55.120 --> 12:57.200
 and you can move the humans and the crew

12:57.200 --> 12:59.880
 into another decentralized node of the spacecraft.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.000
 There's another idea out of Neil Stevenson's Seven Eves,

13:02.000 --> 13:03.840
 actually, where these arclets,

13:03.840 --> 13:06.240
 which were decentralized spacecraft that could form

13:06.240 --> 13:10.000
 and dock little temporary space stations with each other,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.160
 and then separate and go off on their way

13:12.160 --> 13:15.920
 and have a decentralized approach to living in space.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.760
 So the self assembly component of that

13:18.760 --> 13:21.760
 too, so this is your PhD work and beyond,

13:21.760 --> 13:24.440
 you explored autonomously self assembling

13:24.440 --> 13:28.200
 space architecture for future space tourist habitats

13:28.200 --> 13:31.400
 and space stations in orbit around Earth, moon and Mars.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.680
 There's few things I personally find sexier

13:34.680 --> 13:39.680
 than self assembling space, autonomously self assembling

13:39.880 --> 13:40.960
 space architecture.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.720
 In general, it doesn't even need to be space.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.080
 The idea of like self assembling architectures

13:46.080 --> 13:46.920
 is really interesting,

13:46.920 --> 13:49.320
 like building a bridge or something like that

13:49.320 --> 13:51.560
 through self assembling materials.

13:51.560 --> 13:56.560
 It feels like an incredibly efficient way to do it

13:57.320 --> 13:59.880
 because optimization is built in.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.200
 So you can build like the most optimal structures

14:03.200 --> 14:08.200
 given dynamic, uncertain, changing conditions.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.360
 So maybe can you talk about your PhD work,

14:11.360 --> 14:14.240
 about this work, about Tesla Ray?

14:14.240 --> 14:16.400
 What is it in general?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.400
 Also any cool stuff, cause this is super cool.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.120
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.680
 So Tesla Ray is my PhD research.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.840
 It's this idea that we could take tiles

14:26.840 --> 14:30.000
 that construct a large structure like a bucky ball.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.840
 Yeah, this is exactly what we're looking at here,

14:31.840 --> 14:34.720
 which is the tiles that are packed flat in a rocket.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.360
 They're released to float in microgravity.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.240
 Magnets, pretty powerful electro permanent magnets

14:41.240 --> 14:44.480
 on their edges, draw them together for autonomous docking.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.080
 So there's no human in the loop here

14:46.080 --> 14:48.160
 and there's no central agent coordinating

14:48.160 --> 14:50.720
 saying tile one, go to tile two.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.480
 It's completely decentralized system.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.800
 They find each other on their own.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.280
 What we don't show in this video is

14:56.280 --> 14:58.200
 what happens if there's an error, right?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.120
 So what happens if they bond incorrectly?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.440
 The tiles have sensing.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.640
 So proximity sensing, magnetometer,

15:03.640 --> 15:06.600
 other sensors that allow them to detect a good bond

15:06.600 --> 15:10.040
 versus a bad bond and pulse off and self correct,

15:10.040 --> 15:11.600
 which anybody who works in this, you know,

15:11.600 --> 15:13.120
 the field of self assembly will tell you

15:13.120 --> 15:15.760
 that error detection and correction

15:15.760 --> 15:19.040
 just like error detection in a DNA sequence

15:19.040 --> 15:21.400
 or protein folding is really important part

15:21.400 --> 15:23.120
 of the system for that robustness.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.360
 And so we've done a lot of work to engineer

15:25.360 --> 15:29.320
 that ability for the tiles to be self determining.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.840
 They know whether they're forming the structure

15:30.840 --> 15:32.200
 that they're supposed to form or not.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.400
 They know if they're in a toxic relationship

15:34.400 --> 15:35.800
 and they need to get out.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.640
 Right, right.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.720
 If they need to separate exactly, yeah.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.520
 All right, this is like so amazing.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.000
 And for people who are just listening to this,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.200
 yeah, there's a lot, I mean, how large are these tiles?

15:45.200 --> 15:47.840
 So the size that we use in the lab,

15:47.840 --> 15:49.200
 they can really be any size

15:49.200 --> 15:51.120
 because we can scale them down to do testing

15:51.120 --> 15:51.960
 and microgravity.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.080
 So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide

15:55.080 --> 15:57.160
 to the International Space Station a couple of years ago

15:57.160 --> 16:00.160
 to test the code, test the state machine,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.320
 test the algorithm of self assembly.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.560
 But now we're actually building

16:03.560 --> 16:05.720
 our first ever human scale tiles.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.960
 They're me human size.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.080
 So a little, you know, a little smaller

16:08.080 --> 16:09.760
 than maybe your average human,

16:09.760 --> 16:14.080
 but they're 2.5 feet on edge length.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.760
 The larger scale that we would love to build in the future

16:16.760 --> 16:18.760
 would actually be tiles that are big enough

16:18.760 --> 16:21.960
 to form a bucky ball, big open spherical volume,

16:21.960 --> 16:23.640
 spherical approximation volume,

16:23.640 --> 16:25.720
 that'd be about 10 meters in diameter.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.120
 So 30 feet, which is much bigger and grander

16:29.120 --> 16:30.400
 in terms of open space

16:30.400 --> 16:32.600
 than any current module on the ISS.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.200
 And one of the goals of this project was to say,

16:35.200 --> 16:38.840
 what's the purpose of next generation space architecture?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.680
 Should it be something that really inspires

16:41.680 --> 16:44.840
 and delights people when you float into that space?

16:44.840 --> 16:46.760
 Can you get goosebumps in the way that you do

16:46.760 --> 16:49.440
 when you walk into a really stunning piece of architecture

16:49.440 --> 16:50.280
 on Earth?

16:50.280 --> 16:52.320
 And so we think that self assembly,

16:52.320 --> 16:55.320
 this modular reconfigurable algorithm

16:55.320 --> 16:58.080
 for constructing space structures in orbit

16:58.080 --> 17:01.320
 is gonna give us this promise of space architecture

17:01.320 --> 17:03.480
 that's actually worth living in.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.400
 Living in, oh, I thought you also meant

17:05.400 --> 17:07.560
 from like outside artistic perspective,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.680
 see the whole thing is just.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.480
 With the aesthetics of it, absolutely.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.440
 You know, when you like go like into Vegas or something,

17:14.440 --> 17:16.480
 whenever you go into a city

17:16.480 --> 17:19.360
 and it like over the hill appears in front of you.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.720
 And I mean, there's something majestic

17:20.720 --> 17:25.280
 about seeing like, wow, humans created that.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.960
 It gives you like hope about like,

17:26.960 --> 17:28.040
 if these are bunch of ants,

17:28.040 --> 17:30.280
 we're able to figure out how to build skyscrapers

17:30.280 --> 17:31.440
 that light up.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.960
 And in general, the design of these tiles

17:33.960 --> 17:36.440
 and the way you envision it are pretty scalable.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.280
 Yes.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.560
 And they're inspired by exactly what you mentioned a moment ago,

17:39.560 --> 17:43.000
 which is we have these patterns of self assembly on earth.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.040
 And there's a lot of fantastic MIT research

17:45.040 --> 17:46.520
 that we're building this concept on.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.400
 So like Daniela Roos at Seasale and Pebbles,

17:49.400 --> 17:53.880
 taking the power of magnets to create units

17:53.880 --> 17:56.200
 that are themselves interchangeable,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.680
 this notion of programmable matter.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.600
 And so we're interested in going really big with it

18:01.600 --> 18:05.360
 to build big scale space structures with programmable tiles.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.600
 But there's also a really fascinating, you know,

18:07.600 --> 18:08.960
 end of that on the other side of the spectrum,

18:08.960 --> 18:11.400
 which is how small can you go with matter

18:11.400 --> 18:13.800
 that's programmable and stacks and builds itself

18:13.800 --> 18:16.880
 and creates a bridge or something in the future.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.560
 What do you envision the thing would look like?

18:19.560 --> 18:22.320
 Like when you imagine a thing far into the future

18:22.320 --> 18:25.680
 where there's, so we're not even thinking

18:25.680 --> 18:29.000
 about like small space, well, let's not call them small,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.800
 but our currently sized space stations,

18:30.800 --> 18:33.000
 but like something gigantic.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.240
 What do you envision?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.640
 Is this something with symmetry

18:36.640 --> 18:38.840
 or is this something we can't even come up with yet?

18:38.840 --> 18:42.880
 Is there beautiful structures that you imagine in your mind?

18:42.880 --> 18:45.720
 I've got three candidates that I would love to build.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.680
 If we're talking about monumental space architecture,

18:48.680 --> 18:51.720
 one is, what does a space cathedral look like?

18:51.720 --> 18:52.840
 It can be a secular cathedral,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.440
 doesn't necessarily have to be about religion,

18:54.440 --> 18:57.960
 but that notion of long sight lines,

18:57.960 --> 19:01.240
 inspiring stunning architecture when you go in.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.840
 And you can imagine floating instead of, you know,

19:03.840 --> 19:07.280
 being on the ground and only looking up in space,

19:07.280 --> 19:10.080
 you could be in a central node and each direction

19:10.080 --> 19:12.440
 you look at all the cardinal directions

19:12.440 --> 19:15.400
 are spires going off in a really large and long way.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.200
 So that's concept number one.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.000
 Number two would be something more organic

19:20.000 --> 19:21.800
 that's not just geometric.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.440
 So here, one of the ideas that we're working on in MIT

19:24.440 --> 19:27.600
 in my lab is to say, could you,

19:27.600 --> 19:29.280
 instead of the tesserae model, right,

19:29.280 --> 19:31.920
 which is self assembling a shell,

19:31.920 --> 19:35.000
 could you define a module that's a node,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.960
 a small node that someone can live in

19:36.960 --> 19:39.640
 and you self assemble a lot of those together?

19:39.640 --> 19:43.600
 They're called plesiohedrons, like space filling solids

19:43.600 --> 19:45.560
 and you dock a bunch of them together

19:45.560 --> 19:49.800
 and you can create a really organic structure out of that.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.440
 So this is the same way that muscles accrete to appear.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.560
 You can have these nodes that dock together

19:55.560 --> 19:57.640
 and one shape that I would love to form out of this

19:57.640 --> 20:00.440
 is something like a nautilus, a seashell,

20:00.440 --> 20:01.720
 that beautiful, you know,

20:01.720 --> 20:04.920
 Fibonacci spiral sequence that you get in that shape,

20:04.920 --> 20:07.240
 which I think would be a stunning and fabulous

20:08.360 --> 20:10.360
 aggregated space station.

20:10.360 --> 20:14.240
 You said so many cool words, plesiohedron.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.080
 Yeah, plesiohedron.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.280
 So that's a space filling.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.120
 Solid.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.040
 The simplest thing to think about is like a cube.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.000
 Oh, cube. A cube, right?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.680
 So you can stack cubes together

20:23.680 --> 20:25.440
 and if you had an infinite number of cubes,

20:25.440 --> 20:27.200
 you'd fill all that space.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.920
 There's no gaps in between the cubes.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.400
 They stack and fill space.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.720
 Another plesiohedron is a truncated octahedron

20:34.720 --> 20:36.480
 and that's actually one of the candidate structures

20:36.480 --> 20:38.680
 that we think would be great for space stations.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.120
 What's the truncated part?

20:40.120 --> 20:42.640
 Ah, so you cut off an octahedron

20:42.640 --> 20:44.560
 actually has little pointy areas.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.320
 You truncate certain sections of it

20:46.320 --> 20:50.040
 and you get surfaces that are on the structure

20:50.040 --> 20:52.840
 that are cubes and I think hexagons.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.600
 I'd have to remind myself exactly what the faces are.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.000
 But overall, a truncated octahedron

20:58.000 --> 21:00.720
 can be bonded to other truncated octahedrons

21:00.720 --> 21:02.040
 and just like a cube,

21:02.040 --> 21:04.880
 it fills all the gaps as you build it out.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.720
 So you can imagine two truncated octahedrons,

21:07.720 --> 21:09.200
 they come together at an airlock,

21:09.200 --> 21:12.280
 which is what we space people called doors in space

21:12.280 --> 21:14.200
 and you dock them on all sides

21:14.200 --> 21:18.080
 and you've basically created this decentralized network

21:18.080 --> 21:22.000
 of space nodes that make a big space station.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.640
 And once you have enough of them

21:23.640 --> 21:25.480
 and you're growing with enough big units,

21:25.480 --> 21:28.000
 you can do it in any macro shape you want.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.320
 That's where the nautilus comes in.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.960
 This could be design and organically inspired shape

21:32.960 --> 21:34.240
 for a space station.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.840
 Can I just say how awesome it is to hear you say,

21:36.840 --> 21:38.760
 we space people.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.240
 I know you meant people that are doing research

21:41.240 --> 21:43.880
 on space exploration, space technology,

21:43.880 --> 21:45.960
 but it also made me think of a future.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.720
 There's earth people and there's those space people.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.400
 I'd love to unite those two.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.840
 Yeah, no, no, for sure.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.800
 For sure, but like, it's like New Yorkers

21:56.800 --> 21:59.760
 and like Texans or something like that.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.560
 Yeah, of course, you live for a time in New York

22:03.560 --> 22:05.200
 and then you go up to Boston.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.120
 But for a time, you're the space people.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.200
 All I know those space people, they're kind of wild up there.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.560
 We'll see how that dynamic of all.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.400
 Yeah, exactly.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.720
 There's that culture, culture forms.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.120
 And I would love to see what kind of culture,

22:17.120 --> 22:21.160
 once you have sort of more and more civilians.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.600
 I mean, there's a human,

22:22.600 --> 22:24.520
 I mean, I love psychology and sociology

22:24.520 --> 22:27.600
 and I'll maybe ask you about that too,

22:27.600 --> 22:29.640
 which is like the dynamic between humans.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.720
 You have to kind of start considering that.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.160
 You need to start spending more and more time up in space

22:34.160 --> 22:36.800
 and start sending civilians,

22:36.800 --> 22:39.200
 start sending bigger and bigger groups of people.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.960
 And then of course, the beautiful and the ugly emerges

22:42.960 --> 22:47.440
 from the human nature that we haven't been able

22:47.440 --> 22:49.240
 to escape up to this point.

22:49.240 --> 22:53.120
 But when you say the plesorhedrons, these kinds of shapes,

22:53.120 --> 22:54.560
 are they multifunctional?

22:54.560 --> 22:56.760
 Like, is the idea you'd be able to,

22:58.680 --> 23:02.280
 humans cannot occupy them safely in some of them

23:02.280 --> 23:04.920
 and some others have some other purposes?

23:04.920 --> 23:07.360
 Exactly, one could be sleeping quarters.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.440
 One could be a greenhouse or an agricultural unit.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.800
 One could be a storage depot.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.720
 Essentially all of the different rooms

23:15.720 --> 23:17.920
 or functions that you might need in a space station

23:17.920 --> 23:19.960
 could be subdivided into these nodes

23:19.960 --> 23:22.240
 and then stacked together.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.520
 And one of the promises of both Tesseray,

23:24.520 --> 23:26.960
 my original PhD research, which is these shells

23:26.960 --> 23:29.560
 and then this follow on node concept,

23:29.560 --> 23:32.160
 is that right now we build space stations

23:32.160 --> 23:33.840
 and once they're built, they're done.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.320
 You can't really change them profoundly,

23:36.320 --> 23:39.000
 but the benefit of a modular self assembling system

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
 is you can disassemble it.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.840
 You can completely reconfigure it.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.280
 So if your mission changes

23:44.280 --> 23:46.400
 or the number of people in space that you wanna host,

23:46.400 --> 23:47.800
 if you have a space conference happening

23:47.800 --> 23:48.920
 like South by Southwest.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.160
 I was thinking space party,

23:50.160 --> 23:52.480
 but space conference was good too.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.680
 Then maybe all of a sudden you want to change out

23:55.680 --> 23:57.920
 what were window tiles yesterday,

23:57.920 --> 24:00.520
 cupola tiles and make them into a birthing port

24:00.520 --> 24:02.600
 so that you can welcome five new spaceships

24:02.600 --> 24:04.320
 to come and join you in space.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.320
 That's what this promise of reconfigurable space architecture

24:07.320 --> 24:09.120
 might allow us to explore.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.720
 I've been hanging out with Grimes recently

24:10.720 --> 24:13.240
 and just feel like she belongs up in space.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.520
 This is like designed for artists essentially.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.200
 Like imagine, I mean, this is what South by

24:18.200 --> 24:20.120
 keeps introducing me to is there's like,

24:20.120 --> 24:23.440
 the weird and the beautiful people and like the artists

24:23.440 --> 24:26.320
 and it feels like there's a lot of opportunities

24:26.320 --> 24:28.680
 for art and design.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.520
 100%.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.880
 It's like space is a combination of arts,

24:31.880 --> 24:35.560
 design and great engineering with a,

24:36.800 --> 24:39.800
 it's a safety critical with like the highest of stakes.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.720
 So don't, you can't mess it up.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.640
 And is this, first of all, you're talking about tiling.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.600
 So Neil Stevens is obsessed about tiling.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.800
 I don't know if it's related to any of this,

24:48.800 --> 24:50.600
 but he seems to be obsessed with like,

24:50.600 --> 24:51.680
 how do you tile a space?

24:51.680 --> 24:54.040
 That's a mathematical geometric notion.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.080
 Like the tessellation.

24:55.080 --> 24:59.520
 And it's, I mean, it's a beautiful idea for architecture

24:59.520 --> 25:03.400
 that you can self assemble these different shapes

25:03.400 --> 25:07.480
 and you can have probably some centralized guidance

25:07.480 --> 25:09.720
 of the kind of thing you want to build,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.040
 but they also kind of figure stuff out themselves

25:12.040 --> 25:13.520
 in terms of the low level details,

25:13.520 --> 25:15.960
 in terms of the figuring out when the,

25:15.960 --> 25:19.720
 when if everything fits just right for the OCD people,

25:19.720 --> 25:23.040
 like, what's that subreddit?

25:23.040 --> 25:26.120
 Pleasantly, it's like really fun, everything.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.800
 They have like videos of everything's just pleasant

25:27.800 --> 25:29.520
 when everything just fits perfectly.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.360
 Very pleasing.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.480
 All the tolerances come together well.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.360
 So they figure that out on themselves

25:34.360 --> 25:36.280
 and the local robotics problem.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.960
 But by the way, was Daniela Rose Pebbles,

25:37.960 --> 25:39.280
 what's the Pebbles Project?

25:39.280 --> 25:42.680
 The Pebbles Project are little cubes that have EPMs

25:42.680 --> 25:44.240
 on them, electromagnetic magnets,

25:44.240 --> 25:46.120
 and they can self disassemble.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
 So they'll turn off.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.360
 And so you'll have this little structure

25:48.360 --> 25:51.640
 that all of a sudden can flip the little Pebbles over

25:51.640 --> 25:54.600
 and essentially just disaggregate.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.600
 They have to make some pleasing sounds.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.440
 Yes.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.120
 And what that's gonna,

26:00.120 --> 26:01.360
 so I'm supposed to talk to Daniela,

26:01.360 --> 26:02.880
 so that I'll probably spend an hour

26:02.880 --> 26:05.000
 just discussing the sounds on the Pebbles.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.520
 Okay, what were we talking about?

26:07.520 --> 26:10.960
 So that's, cause you mentioned two, I think.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.080
 Right, my third one.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.240
 Yeah, is there a third one?

26:13.240 --> 26:14.640
 My third one is a ring world,

26:14.640 --> 26:17.360
 just because every science fiction book ever

26:17.360 --> 26:19.840
 that's worth anything has a ring world in it.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
 And just...

26:20.840 --> 26:21.840
 Is there a donut?

26:21.840 --> 26:22.720
 A donut, yeah.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.480
 So a really big torus that could encircle a planet

26:27.480 --> 26:29.600
 or encircle a Nether celestial body,

26:29.600 --> 26:32.160
 maybe an asteroid or a small moon.

26:32.160 --> 26:36.080
 And the promise here is just the beauty

26:36.080 --> 26:39.920
 of being able to have that geometry in orbit

26:39.920 --> 26:42.360
 and all that surface area for solar panels

26:42.360 --> 26:46.600
 and talking and essentially just all of what that enables

26:46.600 --> 26:48.960
 to have a ring world at that scale in orbit.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.440
 By the way, for the viewers,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.600
 we're looking at figure alone, what paper is this from?

26:52.600 --> 26:57.360
 So a hexagonal tiling of a torus generated in Mathematica,

26:57.360 --> 27:01.080
 referencing code and approach from two citations.

27:01.080 --> 27:04.240
 So we're looking at a tiled donut and I'm not hungry.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.920
 So this is the, is this from your thesis or no?

27:06.920 --> 27:08.760
 This is probably, I mean, this is in my thesis.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.560
 This looks like it was one of my earlier papers.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.240
 This was an approach to say, great,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.480
 we've come up with this tessellation approach

27:15.480 --> 27:16.840
 for a bucky ball.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.120
 And we picked the bucky ball

27:18.120 --> 27:21.320
 because it is the most efficient surface area

27:21.320 --> 27:23.960
 to volume shape and what's expensive in space,

27:23.960 --> 27:26.360
 the surface area shipping up all that material.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.800
 So we wanted something that would maximize the volume.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.840
 But if we think about ring worlds and other shapes,

27:30.840 --> 27:34.040
 we wanted to look at how do you tile a torus?

27:34.040 --> 27:37.040
 And this is one example with hexagons to be able to say,

27:37.040 --> 27:39.120
 could we take this same tesserae approach

27:39.120 --> 27:42.200
 of self assembling tiles and create other geometries?

27:42.200 --> 27:43.520
 This is so freaking cool.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.360
 That's awesome.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.440
 So you mentioned microgravity and I saw,

27:48.440 --> 27:50.400
 I believe that there's a picture of you

27:50.400 --> 27:52.200
 floating in microgravity.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.720
 When did you get to experience that?

27:53.720 --> 27:54.840
 What was that like?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.520
 So I've flown nine times on the,

27:57.520 --> 27:59.960
 affectionately known as the vomit comet.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.680
 It's the parabolic flight and essentially it does

28:02.680 --> 28:04.280
 what you'd want a plane never to do.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.000
 It pitches really steeply upwards at 45 degrees.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.840
 That's a picture of you.

28:07.840 --> 28:08.920
 Yeah.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.760
 That's tesserae.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.320
 That's super early in my PhD.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.800
 Some of just the passive tiles,

28:12.800 --> 28:14.240
 before we even put electronics in,

28:14.240 --> 28:17.120
 we were just testing the magnet polarity

28:17.120 --> 28:18.760
 and the essentially,

28:18.760 --> 28:20.880
 is it an energy favorable structure

28:20.880 --> 28:22.240
 to self assemble on and so on?

28:22.240 --> 28:23.920
 So we tweaked a lot of things between.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.880
 Are we looking at a couple of them?

28:25.880 --> 28:27.240
 Yeah, you're looking at a bunch of them there.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.080
 Oh, I see.

28:28.080 --> 28:28.920
 Almost 32 of them.

28:28.920 --> 28:29.760
 Yeah.

28:29.760 --> 28:30.600
 They're clumping.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.640
 They're clumping.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.160
 Can you comment on what's the difference

28:33.160 --> 28:35.920
 between microgravity and zero gravity?

28:35.920 --> 28:36.760
 Yes.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.000
 Is that an important difference?

28:38.000 --> 28:38.840
 It's an important difference.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.600
 There is no zero gravity.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.440
 There's no nothing.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.800
 There's in the universe,

28:43.800 --> 28:46.040
 there is no such thing as zero gravity.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.200
 So Newton's law of gravity tells us

28:48.200 --> 28:50.320
 that there's always gravity attraction

28:50.320 --> 28:51.320
 between any two objects.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.800
 So zero G is a shorthand

28:52.800 --> 28:54.280
 that some of us fall into using

28:54.280 --> 28:56.440
 where it's a little easier to communicate to the public.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.440
 The accurate term is microgravity

28:59.440 --> 29:02.080
 where you are essentially floating your weightless

29:02.080 --> 29:04.280
 but generally in free fall.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.920
 So on the parabolic flights,

29:05.920 --> 29:07.840
 the vomit comet you're in free fall

29:07.840 --> 29:09.320
 at the end of the parabola

29:09.320 --> 29:12.440
 and in orbit around the earth when you're floating,

29:12.440 --> 29:14.400
 you're also in free fall.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.960
 So that's microgravity.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.720
 So affectionately called vomit comet,

29:17.720 --> 29:19.840
 I'm sure there's a reason why it's called affectionately.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.080
 So what's it like?

29:21.080 --> 29:23.600
 What's your first time

29:23.600 --> 29:27.960
 to both philosophically, spiritually and biologically?

29:27.960 --> 29:28.880
 What's it like?

29:28.880 --> 29:30.360
 It's profound.

29:30.360 --> 29:35.160
 It is unlike anything else you will experience on earth

29:35.160 --> 29:38.680
 because it is this true feeling of weightlessness

29:38.680 --> 29:40.040
 with no drag.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.720
 So the closest experience you can think of

29:41.720 --> 29:43.040
 would be floating in a pool

29:43.040 --> 29:44.880
 but you move slowly when you float in a pool

29:44.880 --> 29:46.560
 and your motion is restricted.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.600
 When you're floating,

29:47.600 --> 29:51.180
 it's just you and your body flying like in a dream.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.320
 It takes the littlest amount of energy

29:54.320 --> 29:56.480
 like a finger tap against the wall of the plane

29:56.480 --> 29:58.800
 to shoot all the way across the fuselage.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.480
 And you can move at full speed.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.880
 Like you can move your arms to your muscles.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.800
 There's no resistance that it will be in the pool.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.960
 They actually tell you to make a memory

30:09.960 --> 30:11.440
 when you're on the plane

30:11.440 --> 30:13.880
 because it's such a fleeting experience for your body

30:13.880 --> 30:14.960
 that even a few days later,

30:14.960 --> 30:17.800
 you've already forgotten exactly what it felt like.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.120
 It's so foreign to the human experience.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.200
 They kind of suggest that you explicitly try to

30:23.200 --> 30:24.400
 really form this into a memory

30:24.400 --> 30:25.920
 and then you can do the replay for training.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.680
 Cognitively freeze it.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.520
 Yeah.

30:29.720 --> 30:33.000
 Say, when we have neural link, we can replay that.

30:33.000 --> 30:33.840
 There you go.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.000
 The replay, that memory.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.200
 So in terms of how much stress it has on your body,

30:38.200 --> 30:41.200
 is it biologically stressful?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.560
 You do feel a 2G pullout, right?

30:43.560 --> 30:46.440
 So the cost of getting those micro G parabolas

30:46.440 --> 30:48.240
 is you then have a 2G pullout.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.080
 And that's hard.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.200
 You have to train for it.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.600
 If you move your neck too quickly in that 2G pullout,

30:52.600 --> 30:54.760
 you can strain muscles.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.800
 But I wouldn't say that it's actually

30:56.800 --> 31:00.200
 a profound tough thing on the body.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.920
 It's really just an incredibly novel experience.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.520
 And when you're in orbit

31:04.520 --> 31:06.600
 and you're not having to go through the ups and downs

31:06.600 --> 31:07.840
 of the parabolic plane,

31:07.840 --> 31:09.920
 there's a real grace and elegance.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.480
 And you see the astronauts learn to operate

31:12.480 --> 31:15.000
 in this completely new environment.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.400
 What are some interesting differences

31:16.400 --> 31:17.840
 between the parabolic plane

31:17.840 --> 31:20.000
 and when you're actually going up in orbit?

31:20.000 --> 31:24.120
 Is it that with orbit you can look out and see

31:24.120 --> 31:26.200
 that blue little planet of ours?

31:26.200 --> 31:27.280
 You can see the blue marble,

31:27.280 --> 31:28.840
 the stunning overview effect,

31:28.840 --> 31:30.920
 which is something I hope to see one day.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.760
 What's also really different is

31:32.760 --> 31:35.480
 if you're in orbit for any significant period of time,

31:35.480 --> 31:37.640
 there's going to be a lot more physiological changes

31:37.640 --> 31:40.840
 to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight

31:40.840 --> 31:42.160
 on the vomit comet.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.280
 Everything from your bones, your muscles,

31:44.280 --> 31:46.720
 your eyeballs change shape.

31:46.720 --> 31:47.880
 There's a lot of different things

31:47.880 --> 31:50.480
 that happen for long duration space flight.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.800
 And we still have to, as scientists,

31:51.800 --> 31:53.840
 we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges

31:53.840 --> 31:56.840
 to be able to keep humans thriving

31:56.840 --> 32:01.040
 in microgravity or deep duration space missions.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.600
 Deep duration space missions.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.160
 Okay, let's talk about this.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.280
 I was just going to ask a bunch of dumb questions.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.240
 So approximately how long does it take

32:10.240 --> 32:12.680
 to travel to Mars, asking for a friend?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.840
 Asking for a friend, as we all do.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.840
 About three years for a round trip.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.240
 And that's not that it actually takes like that.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.000
 Why the round trip, is that?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.720
 Well, the friend was asking about the one way trip.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.040
 Got it, got it, got it.

32:25.040 --> 32:25.880
 That's okay, cool.

32:25.880 --> 32:29.480
 Before just like literally flying to Mars in a round.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.760
 It takes three years.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.560
 There's an interstitial time there

32:32.560 --> 32:35.480
 because you really can only go between Earth and Mars

32:35.480 --> 32:37.560
 at certain points in their orbits

32:37.560 --> 32:39.480
 where it's favorable to make that journey.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.880
 And so part of that three years

32:40.880 --> 32:43.520
 is you take the journey to Mars a few months,

32:43.520 --> 32:45.040
 six to nine months.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.440
 You're there for a period of time

32:46.440 --> 32:49.800
 until the orbits find a favorable alignment again.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.960
 And then you come back another six to nine months.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.160
 So one way travel is six to nine months.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.440
 You hang out there on vacation and come back.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.280
 Forced vacation.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.120
 Forced vacation.

32:58.120 --> 32:58.960
 You come back.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.960
 Well, me who loves working all the time,

33:00.960 --> 33:02.520
 all vacation is forced vacation.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.440
 But all right, so okay.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.800
 So that gives us a sense of duration.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.880
 And we can maybe also talk about

33:09.880 --> 33:13.640
 longer and longer and longer duration as well.

33:13.640 --> 33:17.280
 What are the hardest aspects of this,

33:17.280 --> 33:20.840
 of living in space for many days?

33:20.840 --> 33:23.360
 For let's say a hundred days, 200 days.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.920
 Maybe there's a threshold when it gets really tough.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.800
 What are some stupid little things or big things

33:29.800 --> 33:32.360
 that are very difficult for human beings to go through?

33:32.360 --> 33:33.880
 So one big thing and one little thing.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.520
 And there are these two classic problems

33:35.520 --> 33:37.320
 that we're trying to solve in the space industry.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.880
 One is radiation.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.000
 It's not as much of a problem for us right now

33:41.000 --> 33:42.320
 on the International Space Station

33:42.320 --> 33:44.120
 because we're still protected

33:44.120 --> 33:46.200
 by part of Earth's magnetosphere.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.040
 But as soon as you get farther out into space

33:48.040 --> 33:49.360
 and you don't have that protection

33:49.360 --> 33:52.760
 once you leave the Van Allen belt area of the Earth

33:52.760 --> 33:55.440
 and the cocoon around the Earth,

33:55.440 --> 33:57.160
 we have really serious concerns

33:57.160 --> 33:59.920
 about radiation and the effect on human health long term.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.320
 That's the big one.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.920
 The small one, and I say it's small

34:02.920 --> 34:04.280
 because it seems mundane,

34:04.280 --> 34:05.960
 but it actually is really big in its own way,

34:05.960 --> 34:09.040
 is mental health and how to keep people happy and balanced.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.480
 And you were alluding to some of the psychological challenges

34:11.480 --> 34:13.960
 of having humans together on missions

34:13.960 --> 34:15.400
 and especially as we try to scale

34:15.400 --> 34:18.160
 the number of humans in orbit or in space.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.360
 So that's another big challenge

34:19.360 --> 34:21.200
 is how to keep people happy and balanced

34:21.200 --> 34:22.880
 and cooperating.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.920
 That's not an issue on Earth at all.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.240
 At all.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.480
 Okay, so we'll talk about each of those

34:29.480 --> 34:31.160
 in a bit more detail,

34:31.160 --> 34:34.480
 but let me continue on the chain of dumb questions.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.760
 What about food?

34:35.760 --> 34:38.760
 What's a good source for food and space?

34:38.760 --> 34:42.760
 And what are some sort of standard go to meals, menus?

34:42.760 --> 34:46.080
 Right now, your go to menu is gonna be mostly freeze dried.

34:46.080 --> 34:50.400
 Every so often, NASA will arrange for a fun stunt

34:50.400 --> 34:51.920
 or a fresh food to get up to station.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.600
 So they did bake double tree cookies with Hilton

34:54.600 --> 34:55.840
 a couple of years ago, as I recall,

34:55.840 --> 34:57.840
 I think sometime before the pandemic.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.160
 But there's work actually in our lab at MIT.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.160
 Maggie Copeland, one of my staff researchers,

35:02.160 --> 35:04.600
 is looking at the future of fermentation.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.160
 Everybody loves beer, right?

35:06.160 --> 35:08.720
 Beer and wine and kimchi and miso,

35:08.720 --> 35:11.920
 these foods that have just been really important

35:11.920 --> 35:13.240
 to human cultures for eons

35:13.240 --> 35:16.560
 because we love the umami and the better flavor in them.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.480
 But it turns out they also have a good shelf life,

35:18.480 --> 35:19.760
 if done properly.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.480
 And they also have an additional health benefit

35:22.480 --> 35:25.720
 for the microbiome, for probiotics and prebiotics.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.640
 So we're trying to work with NASA

35:27.640 --> 35:29.320
 and convince them to be more open minded

35:29.320 --> 35:33.160
 to fermented food for long duration deep space missions.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.200
 That we think is one of the future elements

35:35.200 --> 35:38.120
 in addition to in situ growing your own food.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.480
 Not, okay, this is essential for the space party

35:41.480 --> 35:43.360
 is the space beer.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.800
 Yes, it's the fermented product, yes.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.600
 Okay, cool, in terms of water,

35:47.600 --> 35:49.720
 what's a good source of drinkable water?

35:49.720 --> 35:50.720
 Like where do you get water?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.920
 Do you have to always bring it on board with you?

35:52.920 --> 35:56.720
 And is there compressed efficient way of storing it?

35:56.720 --> 35:58.920
 So to steal a line from Charlie Bolden,

35:58.920 --> 36:01.440
 who's the former administrator of NASA,

36:01.440 --> 36:04.680
 this morning's fresh water is yesterday's coffee.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.480
 So if you think about what that means,

36:06.480 --> 36:08.120
 you drank the coffee yesterday.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.800
 Oh right, as a child, it goes fully through the body.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.160
 Fully through the body as the recycling system.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.440
 And then you drink what you peed out

36:15.440 --> 36:20.440
 as clarified refined fresh water the next day.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.360
 That is one source of water.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.440
 Another source of water in the near neighborhood

36:25.440 --> 36:27.160
 of our solar system would be on the moon.

36:27.160 --> 36:30.040
 So water ice deposits, there's also water on Mars.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.720
 This is one of the big things that's bringing people

36:32.720 --> 36:35.240
 to want to develop infrastructure on the moon,

36:35.240 --> 36:37.840
 is once you've gotten out of the gravity well of earth,

36:37.840 --> 36:40.400
 if you can find water on the moon and refine it,

36:40.400 --> 36:41.920
 you can either make it into propellant

36:41.920 --> 36:44.160
 or drinkable water for humans.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.200
 And so that's really valuable as a potential gateway

36:47.200 --> 36:48.640
 out into the rest of the solar system

36:48.640 --> 36:49.880
 to be able to get propellant

36:49.880 --> 36:52.200
 without always having to ship it up from earth.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.320
 So how much water is there on Mars?

36:56.320 --> 36:57.160
 It's a great question.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.000
 I do not know.

36:58.000 --> 36:58.840
 We don't know this yet, right?

36:58.840 --> 36:59.880
 There's water at the caps.

36:59.880 --> 37:04.240
 I suspect NASA from all of the satellite studies

37:04.240 --> 37:06.760
 that they've done at Mars have a decent idea

37:06.760 --> 37:08.600
 of what the water deposits look like,

37:08.600 --> 37:11.520
 but I don't know to what degree they have characterized those.

37:11.520 --> 37:16.520
 I really hope there's life or traces of previous life on Mars.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.760
 This is a special spot in my heart

37:18.760 --> 37:21.040
 because I got to work on Sherlock,

37:21.040 --> 37:23.240
 which is the astrobiology experiment

37:23.240 --> 37:24.720
 that's on Mars right now,

37:24.720 --> 37:27.600
 searching for what they would say in a very cautious way

37:27.600 --> 37:31.120
 is signs of past habitability.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.280
 They want to be careful not to get people overly excited

37:33.280 --> 37:35.200
 and say we're searching for signs of life.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.560
 They're searching to see if there would have been organics

37:38.560 --> 37:40.880
 on the surface of Mars or water in certain areas

37:40.880 --> 37:43.720
 that would have allowed for life to flourish.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.720
 And I really love this prospect.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.520
 I do think within our lifetimes,

37:47.520 --> 37:50.360
 we'll get a better answer about finding life

37:50.360 --> 37:52.400
 in our solar system if it's there.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.920
 If not on Mars, maybe Europa, one of the icy worlds.

37:55.920 --> 37:59.280
 So you like astrobiology?

37:59.280 --> 38:00.120
 I do.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.360
 This is part of the,

38:01.360 --> 38:03.560
 so it's not just about human biology.

38:03.560 --> 38:06.640
 It's also other extraterrestrial alien biology.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.480
 Search for life in the universe.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.320
 Okay.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.520
 Is that scary you or excited you?

38:10.520 --> 38:12.240
 It excites me profoundly excitedly.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.560
 That there's other alien civilizations,

38:14.560 --> 38:16.840
 potentially very different than our own?

38:16.840 --> 38:18.680
 I think there's gotta be some humility there.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.920
 And certainly from science fiction,

38:19.920 --> 38:23.240
 we have plenty of reasons to fear that outcome as well.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.600
 But I do think as a scientist,

38:24.600 --> 38:27.280
 it would be profoundly exciting if we were to find life,

38:27.280 --> 38:30.120
 especially in the near neighborhood of our solar system.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.360
 Right now, we would expect it to be

38:31.360 --> 38:33.160
 most likely microbial life,

38:33.160 --> 38:35.440
 but we have a real serious challenge in astrobiology,

38:35.440 --> 38:38.440
 which is it may not even be carbon based life.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.760
 And all of our detectors,

38:39.760 --> 38:42.680
 we only know to look for DNA or RNA.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.400
 How would you even build a detector

38:44.400 --> 38:48.960
 to look for silicon based life or different molecules

38:48.960 --> 38:51.960
 than what we know to be the fundamental molecules for life?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.880
 And then you mentioned offline, Sarah Walker.

38:53.880 --> 38:57.040
 I mean, she heard the question that she's obsessed with,

38:57.040 --> 38:58.880
 even just defining life.

38:58.880 --> 39:02.600
 What is life to look outside the carbon base?

39:02.600 --> 39:04.960
 I mean, to look outside of basically anything

39:04.960 --> 39:07.320
 we can even imagine chemically,

39:07.320 --> 39:08.880
 to look outside of any kind of notions

39:08.880 --> 39:10.800
 that we think of as biology.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.280
 Yeah, it's really weird.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.960
 So you now get into this land of like complexity

39:14.960 --> 39:19.960
 of measuring like how many assembly steps

39:21.120 --> 39:23.720
 it takes to build that thing.

39:23.720 --> 39:28.200
 And maybe dynamic movement or some maintenance

39:28.200 --> 39:30.240
 of some kind of membrane structures.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.960
 Like we don't even know like

39:31.960 --> 39:34.520
 which properties life should have,

39:34.520 --> 39:36.760
 whether it can, should be able to reproduce

39:36.760 --> 39:39.720
 and all those kinds of things or pass information,

39:39.720 --> 39:42.440
 genetic type of information, we don't know.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.120
 And it's like, that's so humbling.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.640
 I mean, I tend to believe that there could be

39:48.520 --> 39:51.080
 something like alien life here on earth

39:51.080 --> 39:56.000
 and we're just too human biology obsessed to even recognize it.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.920
 The shadow biosphere, I remember you and Sarah

39:57.920 --> 39:58.960
 was talking about.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.200
 I mean, that's like speaking of beer.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.400
 I mean, that's something I wanted to make sure,

40:04.400 --> 40:06.440
 in all of science to shake ourselves out

40:06.440 --> 40:10.160
 of like remind ourselves constantly how little we know.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.160
 Cause they might be right in front of our nose.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.960
 Like I wouldn't be surprised if like trees

40:15.960 --> 40:18.920
 are like orders of magnitude more intelligent than humans.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.320
 They're just operating at a much slower scale

40:21.320 --> 40:23.880
 and they're like talking shit about us the whole time.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.680
 Like about silly humans that take everything seriously

40:26.680 --> 40:28.680
 and we start all kinds of nuclear wars

40:28.680 --> 40:31.160
 and we quarrel and we tweet about it.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.520
 And then, but the trees are always there

40:33.520 --> 40:35.280
 just watching us silly humans.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.040
 It's like the ants in Lord of the Rings.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.200
 Exactly.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.640
 So, I mean, I don't know.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.320
 I mean, obviously I'm joking on that one,

40:41.320 --> 40:43.040
 but there could be stuff like that.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.720
 Well, let me ask you the Drake equation,

40:46.720 --> 40:48.240
 the big question.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.080
 How many, like obviously nobody knows,

40:51.080 --> 40:52.200
 but what's your gut?

40:52.200 --> 40:54.960
 What's your hope as a scientist, as a human?

40:54.960 --> 40:57.160
 How many alien civilizations are out there?

40:58.560 --> 41:00.640
 As a ex physicist,

41:00.640 --> 41:02.640
 I'm now much more on the aerospace engineering side

41:02.640 --> 41:04.920
 for space architecture, but as an ex physicist,

41:04.920 --> 41:08.680
 I hope it is prolific.

41:08.680 --> 41:09.680
 I think the challenge is,

41:09.680 --> 41:11.280
 if it's as prolific as we would hope,

41:11.280 --> 41:13.720
 if there are many, many, many civilizations,

41:13.720 --> 41:16.960
 then the question is, where are they?

41:16.960 --> 41:18.760
 Why haven't we heard from them?

41:18.760 --> 41:21.840
 And the Fermi paradox is there's some great filter

41:21.840 --> 41:25.560
 that life only gets to some level of sophistication

41:25.560 --> 41:28.360
 and then kills itself off through war,

41:28.360 --> 41:30.240
 or through famine, or through different challenges

41:30.240 --> 41:33.800
 that filter that society out of existence.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.680
 And it would be an interesting question to try to understand

41:35.680 --> 41:38.080
 if the universe was teeming with life,

41:38.080 --> 41:41.040
 why haven't we found it or heard from it yet,

41:41.040 --> 41:41.880
 to our knowledge?

41:41.880 --> 41:44.880
 Yeah, I personally believe that it's teeming with life.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.880
 And you're right, I think that's a really useful

41:46.880 --> 41:49.440
 productive engineering scientific question

41:49.440 --> 41:51.600
 of what kind of great filter

41:51.600 --> 41:54.600
 can just be destroying all of that life

41:54.600 --> 41:59.080
 or preventing it from just constantly talking to us,

41:59.080 --> 42:01.520
 silly descendants of apes.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.640
 That's a really nice question,

42:02.640 --> 42:05.400
 like, what are the ways

42:05.400 --> 42:07.720
 civilizations can destroy themselves?

42:08.680 --> 42:09.520
 And...

42:09.520 --> 42:10.680
 There's too many, sadly.

42:10.680 --> 42:13.640
 Well, I don't think we've come up with most of them yet.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.560
 That's also probably true.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.920
 That's the thing, it's, I mean,

42:17.920 --> 42:19.880
 and like, if you look at nuclear war,

42:19.880 --> 42:21.880
 some of it is physics,

42:21.880 --> 42:24.160
 but some of it is game theory.

42:24.160 --> 42:27.600
 It's human nature, it's how societies built themselves,

42:27.600 --> 42:32.600
 how they interact, how we create and resolve conflict.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.880
 And it gets back to the human question on

42:34.880 --> 42:37.160
 when you're doing long term space travel,

42:37.160 --> 42:40.360
 how do you maintain this dynamical system

42:40.360 --> 42:44.880
 of flawed irrational humans

42:44.880 --> 42:48.400
 such that it persists throughout time?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.160
 And not just maintain the biological body,

42:50.160 --> 42:52.680
 but get people from not murdering each other.

42:52.680 --> 42:54.960
 Like, like each other sufficiently

42:54.960 --> 42:57.840
 to where you kind of fit well.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.280
 But I think, you know,

42:59.280 --> 43:02.480
 if the songs or poetry or books taught me anything,

43:02.480 --> 43:04.520
 if you like each other a little too much,

43:05.800 --> 43:07.240
 I mean, the problems arise.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.280
 Cause then there's always a third person who also likes,

43:09.280 --> 43:10.800
 and then there's the drama is like,

43:10.800 --> 43:13.560
 I can't believe you did that last night, whatever.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.760
 So, and then there's beer.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.600
 Gets complicated quickly.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.200
 Gets complicated quickly.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.240
 Okay, anyway, back to the dumb questions.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.280
 Cause you answered this,

43:22.280 --> 43:23.400
 there's an interview where we answer

43:23.400 --> 43:25.240
 a bunch of cool little questions from,

43:25.240 --> 43:28.360
 from young students and so on about like space.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.400
 One of them was playing music in space.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.320
 Yeah.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.320
 And he mentioned something about

43:35.320 --> 43:37.840
 what kind of instruments you could use

43:37.840 --> 43:39.080
 to play music in space.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.480
 Could you, could you mention about

43:41.480 --> 43:43.200
 like the Spotify work in space?

43:43.200 --> 43:45.160
 And if I wanted to do a live performance,

43:45.160 --> 43:47.840
 what kind of instruments would I need?

43:47.840 --> 43:48.680
 Yeah.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.360
 I mean, you referenced culture before.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.000
 And I think this is one of the most exciting things

43:52.000 --> 43:53.920
 that we have at our fingertips,

43:53.920 --> 43:57.800
 which is to define a new culture for space exploration.

43:57.800 --> 44:01.640
 We don't just have to import cultural artifacts from earth

44:01.640 --> 44:03.520
 to make life worth living in space.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.160
 And this musical instrument that you referenced

44:05.160 --> 44:06.760
 was a design of an object

44:06.760 --> 44:09.520
 that could only be performed in microgravity.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.360
 Oh, cool.

44:10.360 --> 44:12.240
 So it doesn't sound the same way

44:12.240 --> 44:14.240
 when it's a percussive instrument,

44:14.240 --> 44:17.080
 when it's rattled or moved in a gravity environment.

44:17.080 --> 44:18.320
 Is that, can we look it up?

44:18.320 --> 44:19.520
 It's called the telemetron.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.360
 Yeah.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.200
 It's created by.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.040
 Oh, the telemetron.

44:22.040 --> 44:22.880
 Telemetron?

44:22.880 --> 44:23.720
 That is so awesome.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.760
 It's created by Sans Fish and Nicole Villiere

44:25.760 --> 44:27.560
 to amazing graduate students

44:27.560 --> 44:29.440
 and staff researchers on my team.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.280
 What does it look like?

44:30.280 --> 44:33.200
 It looks steampunk, actually.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.040
 That's awesome.

44:34.040 --> 44:35.080
 Yeah, it's a pretty cool design.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.280
 It looks like it's a geometric solid

44:37.280 --> 44:39.840
 that has these interesting artifacts on the inside.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.240
 And it has a lot of sensors actually,

44:41.240 --> 44:42.200
 additionally on the inside,

44:42.200 --> 44:44.960
 like IMUs, inertial measurement sensors,

44:44.960 --> 44:47.760
 that allow it to detect when it's floating

44:47.760 --> 44:49.120
 and when it's not floating

44:49.120 --> 44:52.480
 and provides this really kind of ethereal,

44:52.480 --> 44:53.560
 they later sonify it.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.200
 So they use electronic music to turn it into a symphony

44:56.200 --> 44:57.760
 or turn it into a piece.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.560
 And yeah, this is the object, the telemetron.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.360
 How does the human interact with it?

45:01.360 --> 45:02.200
 By tossing it.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.000
 So it's an interactive musical instrument.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.400
 It actually requires another partner.

45:06.400 --> 45:09.400
 So the idea was that it's something like a dance

45:09.400 --> 45:12.040
 or just like something like a choreography in space.

45:12.040 --> 45:12.880
 Got it.

45:12.880 --> 45:13.720
 And speaking of which,

45:13.720 --> 45:15.840
 you also talked about sports

45:15.840 --> 45:18.400
 and like ball sports, like playing soccer.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.280
 So you mentioned that,

45:20.280 --> 45:23.000
 so you're also gonna move at full speed.

45:23.880 --> 45:26.520
 And then if you push off the wall lightly,

45:26.520 --> 45:28.720
 you can fly across, zoom across.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.400
 So how does the physics of that work?

45:31.400 --> 45:34.480
 Can you still play soccer, for example, in space?

45:34.480 --> 45:37.280
 You can, but one of the most intuitive things

45:37.280 --> 45:39.200
 that we all learn as babies, right?

45:39.200 --> 45:40.640
 Is whenever you throw something,

45:40.640 --> 45:42.000
 if I was gonna toss something to you,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.720
 I toss it up because I know that it has to compensate

45:44.720 --> 45:46.240
 for the fact that that Keplerian arc

45:46.240 --> 45:49.520
 is gonna draw it down, the equations of motion

45:49.520 --> 45:50.920
 are gonna draw it down.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.080
 I would, in space, I would just shoot something

45:53.080 --> 45:56.360
 directly towards you, so like straight line of sight.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.440
 And so that would be very different

45:57.440 --> 46:00.520
 for any type of ball sport is to retrain your human mind

46:00.520 --> 46:03.440
 to have that as your intuitive arc of motion

46:03.440 --> 46:04.360
 or lack of arc.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.280
 From your experience from understanding

46:06.280 --> 46:08.520
 how astronauts get adjusted to the stuff,

46:08.520 --> 46:10.400
 how long does it take to adjust to the physics

46:10.400 --> 46:13.040
 of this world, this other world?

46:13.040 --> 46:15.480
 So even after one or two parabolic flights,

46:15.480 --> 46:18.680
 you can gain a certain facility

46:18.680 --> 46:20.720
 with moving in that environment.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.240
 I think most astronauts would say

46:22.240 --> 46:25.080
 maybe several days on station or a week on station

46:25.080 --> 46:26.800
 and their brain flips.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.000
 It's amazing the plasticity of the human brain

46:29.000 --> 46:31.200
 and how quickly they are able to adapt.

46:31.200 --> 46:34.360
 And so pretty quickly they become creatures

46:34.360 --> 46:36.160
 of this new environment.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.080
 Okay, so that's cool, it's creating

46:38.080 --> 46:39.040
 a little bit of an experience.

46:39.040 --> 46:42.440
 What about if you go for more than 100 days

46:42.440 --> 46:46.160
 for one year, for two years, for three years,

46:46.160 --> 46:49.160
 what challenges start to emerge in that case?

46:49.160 --> 46:51.000
 So Scott Kelly wrote this amazing book

46:51.000 --> 46:53.520
 after he spent a year in space and he's a twin.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.320
 It's absolutely fantastic that NASA

46:55.320 --> 46:58.640
 got to do a twin study, it's perfect.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.800
 So he wrote a lot about his experience

47:00.800 --> 47:03.040
 on the health side of what changed.

47:03.040 --> 47:06.960
 Things like bone density, muscle atrophy,

47:06.960 --> 47:10.160
 eyesight changing because the shape of your eyeball changes

47:10.160 --> 47:12.920
 which changes your lens, which changes how you see.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.640
 If we're then thinking about the challenges

47:14.640 --> 47:16.520
 between a year and three years,

47:16.520 --> 47:18.160
 especially if we're doing that three year trip

47:18.160 --> 47:20.360
 to Mars for your friend who asked earlier,

47:20.360 --> 47:23.960
 then you have to think about nutrition.

47:23.960 --> 47:26.720
 And so how are you keeping all of these different needs

47:26.720 --> 47:28.080
 for your body alive?

47:28.080 --> 47:30.640
 How are you protecting astronauts against radiation

47:30.640 --> 47:33.120
 either having some type of a shell on the spacecraft

47:33.120 --> 47:35.560
 which is expensive because it's heavy.

47:35.560 --> 47:36.440
 If it's something like lead

47:36.440 --> 47:38.000
 of really effective radiation shell,

47:38.000 --> 47:39.680
 it's gonna be a lot of mass.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.080
 Or is there a pill that could be taken

47:42.080 --> 47:46.520
 to try to make you less in danger

47:46.520 --> 47:49.320
 of some of the radiation effects?

47:49.320 --> 47:51.080
 A lot of this has not yet been answered,

47:51.080 --> 47:53.440
 but radiation is a really significant challenge

47:53.440 --> 47:55.560
 for that three year journey.

47:55.560 --> 47:57.520
 And what are the negative effects of radiation

47:57.520 --> 47:59.160
 on the human body out in space?

47:59.160 --> 48:03.320
 A higher likelihood to develop cancer at a younger age.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.320
 So you'd probably be able to get there and get back,

48:05.320 --> 48:08.120
 but you'd find yourself in the same way

48:08.120 --> 48:10.840
 of if you were exposed to significant radiation on earth,

48:10.840 --> 48:13.560
 you'd find significant bad health effects as you age.

48:14.480 --> 48:17.240
 What do you think about like decades?

48:17.240 --> 48:19.160
 Do you think about decades?

48:19.160 --> 48:21.320
 Or is this like an entire human life?

48:21.320 --> 48:23.280
 I think about centuries, centuries.

48:23.280 --> 48:25.880
 For my space knowledge, but yeah, for decades.

48:25.880 --> 48:28.440
 I think as soon as we get past the three year mark,

48:28.440 --> 48:29.880
 we'll absolutely want somewhere

48:29.880 --> 48:31.160
 between three years and a decade,

48:31.160 --> 48:33.680
 we'll want artificial gravity.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.400
 And we know how to do that actually.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.440
 The engineering questions still need to be tweaked

48:37.440 --> 48:38.520
 for how we'd really implement it,

48:38.520 --> 48:42.120
 but the science is there to know how we would spin habitats

48:42.120 --> 48:44.160
 in orbit and generate that force.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.440
 So even if the entire habitat's not spinning,

48:46.440 --> 48:49.160
 you at least have a treadmill part of the space station

48:49.160 --> 48:52.400
 that is spinning and you can spend some fraction of your day

48:52.400 --> 48:56.840
 in a near to one G environment and keep your body healthy.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.480
 Wait, literally from just spinning?

48:58.480 --> 49:00.240
 From spinning, yes, and triple force.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.600
 So you generate this force.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.600
 If you've ever been in those carnival rides,

49:03.600 --> 49:06.120
 the gravitrons that spin you up around the side,

49:06.120 --> 49:07.400
 that's the concept.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.000
 And this is actually one of the reasons

49:09.000 --> 49:13.200
 why we are spinning out a new company from my MIT lab.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.040
 Spinning out, ha.

49:14.040 --> 49:14.880
 Spinning out, ha.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.120
 That was accidental, but well, well noted space pun.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.120
 It could possibly do it.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.760
 That jokes, all right.

49:20.760 --> 49:23.920
 But yeah, we're spinning out a new company

49:23.920 --> 49:27.920
 to look at next generation space architecture

49:27.920 --> 49:30.640
 and how do we actually scale humanities access to space?

49:30.640 --> 49:32.640
 And one of the areas that we wanna look at

49:32.640 --> 49:34.160
 is artificial gravity.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.000
 Is there a name yet?

49:35.000 --> 49:35.840
 Yep, there's a name.

49:35.840 --> 49:36.680
 We are brand new.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.840
 We are just exiting stealth mode.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.680
 So your podcast listeners will literally be

49:40.680 --> 49:42.600
 among some of the first to hear about it.

49:42.600 --> 49:45.240
 It's called Aurelia Institute.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.320
 Aurelia is an old English word for chrysalis.

49:48.320 --> 49:52.000
 And the idea with this is that we, humanity, collectively,

49:52.000 --> 49:55.640
 are at this next stage of our metamorphosis,

49:55.640 --> 49:58.720
 like a chrysalis, into a space fairing species.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.880
 And so we felt that this was a good time,

50:00.880 --> 50:04.360
 a necessary time, to think about

50:04.360 --> 50:06.120
 next generation space architecture,

50:06.120 --> 50:08.160
 but also Starfleet Academy,

50:08.160 --> 50:10.160
 if you know that reference from Star Trek.

50:12.320 --> 50:16.400
 Yes, so let me ask a silly sounding,

50:16.400 --> 50:18.440
 ridiculous sounding, but probably extremely important

50:18.440 --> 50:22.560
 question, sex and space, including intercourse,

50:22.560 --> 50:27.560
 conception, procreation, birth, like being a parent,

50:27.880 --> 50:29.240
 like raising the baby.

50:29.240 --> 50:32.120
 So basically from birth, well, from the before the birth

50:32.120 --> 50:34.800
 part, like the birds and the bees and stuff.

50:34.800 --> 50:38.520
 And then the whole thing, how complicated is that?

50:38.520 --> 50:41.840
 I remember looking at the, thank you, thank you.

50:41.840 --> 50:46.040
 I remember looking at this exact Wikipedia page, actually.

50:46.040 --> 50:49.600
 And it's, I remember being, the Wikipedia page is sex

50:49.600 --> 50:51.840
 and space, and fascinating how difficult of an

50:51.840 --> 50:53.760
 engineering problem the whole thing is.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.400
 Is that something you think about too,

50:55.400 --> 50:58.920
 how to have generations of humans,

50:58.920 --> 51:03.920
 self replicating, organizations, yeah, society is essentially.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.560
 I mean, I guess with micro, like if you solve

51:06.560 --> 51:09.040
 the gravity problem, you solve a lot of these problems.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.320
 That's the hope, yeah, is like the central challenge

51:11.320 --> 51:13.680
 of microgravity to human reproduction.

51:13.680 --> 51:16.680
 But we do host a workshop every year at Beyond the Cradle,

51:16.680 --> 51:18.800
 which is the space event that we run at MIT.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.600
 And we always do one on pregnancy in space,

51:21.600 --> 51:24.400
 or motherhood, or raising children in space,

51:24.400 --> 51:26.720
 because there are huge questions.

51:26.720 --> 51:29.680
 There've been a few mammal studies that have looked

51:29.680 --> 51:31.840
 at reproduction in space, but there are still really

51:31.840 --> 51:33.840
 major questions about how does it work,

51:33.840 --> 51:36.160
 how does the fetus evolve in microgravity

51:36.160 --> 51:37.480
 if you were pregnant in space?

51:37.480 --> 51:39.560
 And I think the near term answer is just gonna be,

51:39.560 --> 51:43.960
 we need to be able to give humans a 1G environment

51:43.960 --> 51:45.280
 for that phase of our development.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.280
 Yeah, so there's some studies on mice in microgravity,

51:49.280 --> 51:51.240
 and it's interesting, like I think the mice,

51:51.240 --> 51:53.200
 like one of them, the mice weren't able to walk,

51:53.200 --> 51:55.120
 or like their understanding of physics,

51:55.120 --> 51:56.640
 I guess is all for something like that.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.960
 Yeah, the mental model when you're really young

51:59.960 --> 52:03.480
 and you're kind of getting your mental model of physics,

52:03.480 --> 52:07.040
 we do think that that would change kids abilities

52:07.040 --> 52:09.040
 to if they were born in microgravity,

52:09.040 --> 52:11.160
 their ability to have that intuition

52:11.160 --> 52:13.920
 around an Earth based 1G environment might be missing,

52:13.920 --> 52:15.360
 because a lot of that is really crystallized

52:15.360 --> 52:17.840
 in early development, early childhood development.

52:17.840 --> 52:20.080
 So that makes sense that they would see that in mice, yeah.

52:20.080 --> 52:25.080
 So what about life when we choose to park our vehicles

52:27.200 --> 52:30.520
 on another planet on the moon, but let's go to Mars?

52:30.520 --> 52:35.520
 First of all, is that excite you humans going to Mars,

52:35.680 --> 52:37.480
 like stepping foot on Mars?

52:37.480 --> 52:38.840
 And when do you think it'll happen?

52:38.840 --> 52:39.880
 It does excite me.

52:39.880 --> 52:43.320
 I think visionaries like Elon are working to make that happen

52:43.320 --> 52:45.840
 in terms of building the road to space.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.200
 We are really excited about building

52:48.200 --> 52:51.440
 out the human lived experience of space once you get there.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.200
 So how are you gonna grow your food?

52:53.200 --> 52:55.240
 What is your habitat gonna look like?

52:55.240 --> 52:56.640
 I think it's profoundly exciting,

52:56.640 --> 52:58.000
 but I do think that there's a little bit

52:58.000 --> 53:02.480
 of a misunderstanding of Mars anywhere in the near future

53:02.480 --> 53:05.000
 being anything like a replacement for Earth.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.320
 So it is good for humanity to have these other pockets

53:07.320 --> 53:10.040
 of our civilization that can expand out beyond Earth,

53:10.040 --> 53:13.640
 but Mars is not in its current state,

53:13.640 --> 53:15.800
 a good home for humanity.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.440
 Too many perchlorates in the soil,

53:17.440 --> 53:19.600
 you can't use that soil to grow crops.

53:19.600 --> 53:21.840
 Atmosphere is too thin, certainly can't breathe it,

53:21.840 --> 53:25.440
 but it's also just really thin compared to our atmosphere.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.440
 A lot of different challenges

53:26.440 --> 53:28.880
 that would have to be fundamentally changed

53:28.880 --> 53:31.320
 on that planet to make it a good home

53:31.320 --> 53:33.400
 for a large human civilization.

53:33.400 --> 53:37.960
 How does a large civilization of humans get built on Mars?

53:37.960 --> 53:42.600
 And where do you think it gets starts being difficult?

53:42.600 --> 53:46.160
 So can you have a small base of like 10 people essentially,

53:46.160 --> 53:49.760
 kind of like the international space station kind of situation?

53:49.760 --> 53:52.200
 And then can you get it to a hundred, to a thousand,

53:52.200 --> 53:53.240
 to a million?

53:53.240 --> 53:55.680
 Are there some interesting challenges there

53:55.680 --> 53:58.920
 that worry you saying that Mars is just not a good backup

53:58.920 --> 54:01.000
 at this time for Earth?

54:01.000 --> 54:04.080
 I think small outposts absolutely, like McMurdo, right?

54:04.080 --> 54:06.560
 So we have these models of really extreme environments

54:06.560 --> 54:08.800
 on Earth and Antarctica, for example,

54:08.800 --> 54:10.400
 where humans have been able to go

54:10.400 --> 54:13.520
 and make a sustainable settlement.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.720
 McMurdo style life on Mars,

54:16.720 --> 54:18.800
 probably feasible in the 2030s.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.120
 So we want to send the first human missions to Mars,

54:21.120 --> 54:22.680
 and maybe as early as the end of this decade,

54:22.680 --> 54:24.800
 more likely early 2030s.

54:24.800 --> 54:28.080
 Moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place

54:28.080 --> 54:31.040
 where like an entire human life would be lived,

54:31.040 --> 54:33.440
 where it's not just you go for a three month deployment

54:33.440 --> 54:34.400
 and you come back.

54:34.400 --> 54:37.840
 That is actually the big challenge line is just saying,

54:37.840 --> 54:41.400
 is there enough technological sophistication

54:41.400 --> 54:44.520
 that can be brought that far out into space?

54:44.520 --> 54:46.560
 If you imagine your electronics break,

54:46.560 --> 54:47.960
 there's no radio shack.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.360
 This dates me a little bit that my mind jumps to radio shack.

54:50.360 --> 54:54.160
 But there's no supply chains on Mars

54:54.160 --> 54:58.120
 that can supply the level of technological sophistication

54:58.120 --> 55:01.120
 for all the products that we rely on on day to day life.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.960
 So you'd be going back to actually a very simple existence,

55:03.960 --> 55:06.040
 more like pioneer life out West

55:06.040 --> 55:08.720
 in the story of the US, for example.

55:08.720 --> 55:13.200
 And I think that the future of larger scale gatherings

55:13.200 --> 55:15.240
 of humans in orbit, or sorry, in space,

55:15.240 --> 55:17.680
 is actually gonna be in microgravity,

55:17.680 --> 55:19.600
 floating space cities,

55:19.600 --> 55:23.760
 not so much trying to establish settlements

55:23.760 --> 55:25.640
 on the surface.

55:25.640 --> 55:29.520
 So you think sort of a significant engineering investment

55:29.520 --> 55:31.480
 in terms of our efforts and money

55:31.480 --> 55:36.760
 should be on large spaceships

55:36.760 --> 55:40.080
 that perhaps are doing this kind of self assembly,

55:40.080 --> 55:41.960
 all these kinds of things and doing an orbit,

55:41.960 --> 55:45.520
 maybe building a giant donut around the planet over time.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.360
 Yeah, that is the goal.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.760
 And I think the current political climate is such

55:48.760 --> 55:52.360
 that you can't get the trillion dollar investment

55:52.360 --> 55:54.360
 to build, to start from scratch

55:54.360 --> 55:56.760
 and build the sci fi megastructure.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.960
 But if you can build it in fits and starts

55:58.960 --> 56:00.000
 in little different pieces,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
 which is another advantage of self assembly,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.120
 it's much more like how nature works.

56:04.120 --> 56:07.600
 So it's biomimicry inspired way for humanity

56:07.600 --> 56:09.760
 to scale out in space.

56:09.760 --> 56:12.720
 And whether it's out in space or on Mars,

56:12.720 --> 56:15.320
 the idea that sort of two people fall in love.

56:16.240 --> 56:17.480
 They have sex.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.560
 A child is born.

56:21.560 --> 56:25.000
 And then that couple has to teach that child

56:25.000 --> 56:27.640
 that they came from Earth.

56:27.640 --> 56:30.560
 I just love the idea that somebody's born on Mars

56:30.560 --> 56:31.720
 or out in space.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.040
 And you have to be like,

56:33.040 --> 56:36.400
 that this is not actually like the original home.

56:36.400 --> 56:38.920
 Just them looking at Earth and being like,

56:38.920 --> 56:40.240
 this is where it came from.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.040
 I don't know, that's really inspiring to me.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.640
 And the child being really confused

56:43.640 --> 56:47.480
 and then wanting to go back to TikTok or whatever they do.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.120
 Whatever they do in that area.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.240
 I mean, there's great sci fi right about

56:51.240 --> 56:52.960
 people being born on Mars.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.000
 And because it's a lower gravity environment,

56:55.000 --> 56:56.800
 they're taller, they're more gangly

56:56.800 --> 56:58.240
 if they were actually able to develop there.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.360
 And then they come back to Earth

56:59.360 --> 57:01.400
 and they're like second class citizens

57:01.400 --> 57:04.040
 because they can't function here in the same way

57:04.040 --> 57:06.080
 because the gravity is too strong for them.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.800
 You see this in series like the expanse

57:07.800 --> 57:10.120
 with the belters and these different societies

57:10.120 --> 57:12.320
 that if we were to succeed

57:12.320 --> 57:14.960
 in having human societies grow up in different pockets,

57:14.960 --> 57:17.880
 it's not necessarily going to be easy for them

57:17.880 --> 57:20.360
 to always come back to Earth as their home.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.760
 Yeah, different cultures form,

57:21.760 --> 57:23.440
 which is the positive way of phrasing it,

57:23.440 --> 57:26.680
 but it's also this human history teaches us

57:26.680 --> 57:29.360
 that we like to form the other.

57:29.360 --> 57:32.040
 So there's this kind of conflict that naturally emerges.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.240
 Let me ask another sort of dark question.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.960
 What do you think about coming from a military family?

57:38.880 --> 57:43.360
 There's still sadly wars in the world.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.440
 Do you think wars,

57:45.440 --> 57:49.280
 a military conflicts will follow us into space?

57:49.280 --> 57:51.360
 Wars between nations?

57:51.360 --> 57:54.040
 Like from my perspective currently,

57:54.040 --> 57:57.760
 it just seems like space is a place for scientists

57:57.760 --> 58:00.120
 and engineers to explore ideas.

58:00.120 --> 58:02.720
 But the more and more progress you make,

58:02.720 --> 58:05.960
 does it worry you that nations start to step in

58:05.960 --> 58:10.960
 and form that go out on full out military conflict,

58:11.640 --> 58:16.640
 whether it's in cyberspace in space or actual hot war?

58:16.640 --> 58:18.280
 I am really concerned about that.

58:18.280 --> 58:20.240
 And I do think for decades,

58:20.240 --> 58:23.240
 the scientific community in space has hung on to this notion

58:23.240 --> 58:26.280
 from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,

58:26.280 --> 58:28.720
 which is space is the province of all humankind,

58:28.720 --> 58:30.960
 peaceful uses of outer space only.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.200
 But I do think the rise in tensions

58:33.200 --> 58:35.800
 and the geopolitical scene that we're seeing,

58:36.800 --> 58:39.320
 I do, yeah, I do harbor a lot of concern

58:39.320 --> 58:43.160
 about hot wars following humanity out into space.

58:43.160 --> 58:47.840
 And it's worth trying to tie nations together

58:47.840 --> 58:50.400
 with more collaboration to avoid that happening.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.240
 The International Space Station is a great example.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.920
 I think it's something like 18 countries

58:53.920 --> 58:55.560
 are party to this treaty.

58:55.560 --> 58:57.480
 It might be less, it might be more.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.320
 And then of course,

58:58.320 --> 58:59.560
 there's a smaller number of countries

58:59.560 --> 59:01.000
 that actually send astronauts.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.120
 But even at the fall of the Soviet Union

59:04.120 --> 59:06.400
 and through some tense times with Russia,

59:06.400 --> 59:09.120
 the ISS had been a place where the US and Russia

59:09.120 --> 59:12.040
 were actually able to collaborate between mirror and ISS.

59:12.040 --> 59:15.800
 I think it'd be really important right now in particular

59:15.800 --> 59:19.280
 to find other platforms where these hegemonic powers

59:19.280 --> 59:22.200
 in the world and developing world nations

59:22.200 --> 59:25.480
 can come and collaborate on the future of space

59:25.480 --> 59:28.280
 and purposefully intertwine our success

59:28.280 --> 59:29.960
 so that there's a danger to multiple parties

59:29.960 --> 59:31.760
 if somebody is a bad actor.

59:31.760 --> 59:35.160
 So we're now talking as there's a war in Ukraine

59:35.160 --> 59:38.800
 and I haven't been sleeping much at family, friends,

59:38.800 --> 59:43.200
 colleagues in both countries.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.520
 And I'm just talking to a lot of people,

59:45.520 --> 59:48.800
 many of whom are crying, refugees.

59:48.800 --> 59:52.720
 And I, you know, there's a basic human compassion

59:52.720 --> 59:55.800
 and love for each other that I believe technology

59:55.800 --> 59:59.160
 can help catalyze and accelerate.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:00.440
 But there's also science.

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:02.160
 There's something about rockets.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.800
 There's something about, and I mean like space exploration

1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:13.800
 that inspires the world about the positive possibilities

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:15.600
 of the human species.

1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:18.720
 So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India

1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:22.800
 and the United States and Europe and everywhere else,

1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:27.920
 it seems like collaborating on giant space projects

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:31.120
 is one way to escape these wars,

1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:33.680
 to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts.

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:36.360
 I mean, there's something, there's so much camaraderie

1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:37.400
 to the whole thing.

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:42.800
 And even in this little period of human history,

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:45.440
 we're living through, it seems like that's essential.

1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:49.160
 Even through this pandemic, there is something so inspiring

1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:52.200
 about those like SpaceX rockets going up, for example.

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:53.360
 That's true.

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:57.080
 This reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:59.560
 by the commercial sector, I don't know.

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:04.560
 That was, as many of us have sort of some dark times

1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:07.840
 during this pandemic, just like loneliness

1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:12.240
 and sometimes emotion and anger and just hopelessness

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:15.680
 and politics, and then you look at those rockets going up,

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:17.160
 and it just gives you hope.

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:21.360
 So I think that's an understated sort of value

1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:24.680
 of space exploration is the thing that unites us

1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.360
 and gives us hope.

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.960
 Obviously, it also inspires young generations of young minds

1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.040
 to also contribute in not necessarily in space exploration,

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:35.440
 but in all of science and literature and poetry.

1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:38.160
 There's something about when you look up to the stars,

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:39.800
 it makes you dream.

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:40.640
 Very true.

1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:44.520
 And so that's a really good reason to sort of invest

1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.160
 in this, whether it's building giant megastructure,

1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:52.680
 which is so freaking cool, but also colonizing Mars.

1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:56.000
 Yeah, it's something to look forward to.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:02.000
 Something that, and not make it a domain of war,

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.920
 but a domain of human collaboration and human

1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:06.840
 compassion, I think.

1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:10.520
 You're the founder and director of the MIT Space

1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:12.240
 Exploration Initiative.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.480
 It includes a ton of projects.

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.560
 So I just wanted to, they're focused, I guess,

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:19.800
 on life in space from astrobiology,

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:22.200
 like we talked about, to habitats.

1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:23.840
 Are there some other interesting projects

1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:27.440
 part of this initiative that pop to mind

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.280
 that you find particularly cool?

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:30.280
 Absolutely.

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:33.360
 One is the future of in space manufacturing.

1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:35.760
 So if we're going to build large scale space structures,

1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:37.760
 yes, it's great to ship them up from Earth

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:39.200
 and self assemble them.

1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:41.880
 But what about extrusion in orbit?

1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.760
 It's one of the best technologies

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.720
 to leverage in microgravity, because you

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.600
 can extrude a particularly long beam that

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:51.000
 would sag in a normal gravity environment,

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.600
 but might be able to become the basis of a truss

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:55.160
 or a large scale space structure.

1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:57.960
 So we're doing miniature tests of extrusion

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:00.200
 and are excited to fly this on the International Space

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:01.920
 Station in a few months.

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:04.320
 We are working on swarm robots.

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:08.920
 We have just announced, actually, MIT's return to the moon.

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:11.480
 So my organization is leading this mission for MIT,

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:12.960
 going back to the surface of the moon

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:17.480
 as early as the end of this year, 2022, maybe early 2023.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.680
 And trying to take data from our research payloads

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:24.600
 at this historic South Pole site, where

1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:27.160
 NASA's supposed to send the first humans back

1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:28.240
 on the Artemis III mission.

1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:30.720
 So our hope is to directly support that human mission

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.160
 with our data.

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:34.440
 How does that connect to the swarm aspects?

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:35.720
 Does it connect?

1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:37.040
 Yeah, so we're actually going to fly

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:38.440
 one of the little astro ants.

1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:39.880
 That's the current plan.

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:43.360
 One of the little swarm robots on the top of a rover.

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:44.520
 That's part of the mission.

1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:45.680
 Ant riding a rover?

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:48.200
 Yes, exactly, an ant riding a rover.

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:49.880
 That rover gets packed in a lander.

1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:52.000
 That lander gets packed in a SpaceX rocket.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.880
 So it's a whole nesting dolls situation

1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:55.400
 to get to the moon.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:57.160
 Mother of robot dragons.

1:03:57.160 --> 1:03:58.600
 Yes, exactly.

1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:01.520
 So this one, a swarm of one?

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:02.680
 Swarm of one, exactly.

1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:03.720
 We're testing out.

1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:06.800
 It's a tech demonstration mission, not a true swarm.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:09.200
 Yeah, there they are, those are the astro ants.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.560
 Wow, and this was a distributed system,

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.160
 and in theory, you could have a ton of these.

1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:15.880
 Yes, these could also be centralized.

1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.960
 So they have wireless technology that could also

1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:19.800
 talk to a central base station.

1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:22.520
 And we'll be assessing kind of case by case,

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.720
 whether it makes sense to operate them in a decentralized

1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:29.080
 swarm or to command them in a centralized swarm.

1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:32.200
 Each robot is equipped with four magnetic wheels,

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:35.640
 which enable the robot to attach to any magnetic surface

1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:37.720
 so you can operate basically any environment.

1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:41.000
 He tested the, we tested the mobility of all robots

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.800
 on different materials in a microgravity environment.

1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:46.920
 On the vomit comet prior to go into the moon.

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:48.320
 That must look so cool.

1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:49.840
 So they're basically moving along

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:52.080
 different metallic surfaces.

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.160
 Yeah, exactly.

1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:56.480
 It's interesting when you, just a minute ago,

1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:00.040
 talking about the reflection of how space can be

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.920
 so aspirational and so uniting.

1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:03.720
 There's a great quote from Bill Anders

1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:05.320
 from the Apollo 8 mission to the moon,

1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.280
 which is he, it's the Earthrise photo that was taken,

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:10.360
 where you see the Earth coming up over the horizon

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:12.800
 of the moon, and the quote is something along the lines of,

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:15.200
 we came all the way to discover the moon,

1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:17.880
 and what we really discovered was the Earth.

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:20.040
 This really powerful image looking back.

1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:22.360
 And so we're also trying to think for our lunar mission,

1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:24.560
 we realized we're a very privileged group at MIT

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:26.280
 to get the opportunity to do this.

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:29.000
 How could we bring humanity along with us?

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.080
 And so one of the things we're still testing out,

1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:32.760
 I don't know if we're gonna be able to just swing it,

1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:35.560
 would be to do something like a Twitch plays Pokemon,

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:36.880
 but with the robot.

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.560
 So let a lot of people on Earth actually control the robot

1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:41.960
 or at least benefit from the data that we're gathering

1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:44.000
 and try to release the data openly.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.520
 So we're exploring a couple of different ideas

1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:48.320
 for how do we engage more people in this mission?

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:52.280
 That would be surreal to be able to interact in some way

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:53.880
 with the thing that's out there.

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:54.720
 Exactly.

1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:55.560
 On another surface.

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:56.560
 Direct connection.

1:05:56.560 --> 1:05:57.720
 Direct connection.

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.280
 I think about artificial intelligence in that same way,

1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:04.800
 which is like building robots,

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:07.320
 puts a mirror to us humans.

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:09.280
 It makes us like wonder about like,

1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:10.520
 what is intelligence?

1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:11.640
 What is consciousness?

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.560
 And what is actually valuable about human beings?

1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:18.320
 When an AI system learns to play chess better than humans,

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.760
 you start to let go of this idea that humans are special

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.800
 because of intelligence.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.700
 It's something else.

1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:29.160
 Maybe the flame of human consciousness.

1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:32.680
 It's the capacity to feel deeply,

1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:36.360
 to sort of to both suffer and to love all those things.

1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:39.800
 And it somehow AI to me puts a mirror to that.

1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:41.880
 You mentioned Hal 9000,

1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.440
 and you had to bring it up with these swarm bots

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:50.160
 crawling on the surface of your cocoon in space.

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:57.040
 Let me steel man the Hal 9000 perspective here.

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:02.160
 The poor guy just wanted to maintain the mission

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:03.840
 and the astronauts were,

1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:05.720
 I don't know if people often talk about that,

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:10.080
 but doctors have to make difficult decisions too.

1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:11.640
 When there's limited resources,

1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:14.040
 you actually do have to sacrifice human life often

1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.720
 because you have to make decisions.

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:20.160
 And I think Hal is probably making that kind of decision

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:22.840
 about what's more important,

1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:26.640
 the lives of individual astronauts or the mission.

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:30.240
 And I feel like when other humans

1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:33.040
 will need to make these decisions,

1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:37.200
 and it also feels like AI systems will need to help

1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:38.960
 make those decisions.

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:42.720
 I don't know, I guess my question is about

1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:46.060
 greater and greater collective intelligence by systems.

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:50.960
 Do you worry about that?

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:54.760
 What is the right way to sort of solve this problem,

1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:56.040
 keeping a human in the loop?

1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:57.520
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:59.400
 Or are they sufficiently dumb now,

1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:03.520
 the robots that's not yet on the horizon to think about?

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:04.880
 I think it should be on the horizon.

1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:06.600
 It's always good to think about these things early

1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:09.320
 because we make a lot of technical design decisions

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:11.200
 at this phase working with swarm robots

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:12.880
 that it would be better to have thought about

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:13.960
 some of these questions early

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:16.360
 in the life cycle of a project.

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.640
 There is a real interest in NASA right now

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:21.680
 thinking about the future of human robot interaction, HRI,

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:24.680
 and what is the right synergy in terms of level of control

1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:27.160
 for the human versus level of dependence

1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:29.160
 or control for the robot.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.600
 And we're beginning to test out more of these scenarios.

1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:36.120
 For example, the Gateway Space Station,

1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:37.920
 which is meant to be in orbit around the moon

1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:40.720
 as a staging base for the surface operations,

1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:43.680
 is meant to be able to function autonomously

1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:46.400
 with no humans in it for months at a time

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:47.840
 because they think it's going to be seasonal.

1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:50.200
 They think we might not be constantly staffing it.

1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:51.840
 So this will be a really great test of,

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:53.480
 I don't know that anybody's yet worried

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.320
 about how 9,000 evolving,

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:58.800
 but certainly just the robustness of some of these AI systems

1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:01.880
 that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station

1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:06.080
 while the humans are away or detection algorithms

1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:07.960
 are going to say, you know, if you had a human pilot,

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:09.920
 they might see debris in orbit and steer around it.

1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:11.280
 There'll be a lot of autonomous navigation

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:12.800
 that has to happen.

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.160
 That'll be one of the early testbeds

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.640
 where we'll start to get a little bit closer to that future.

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.400
 Well, the HRI component is really interesting to me,

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:24.760
 especially when the AI includes like almost friendship

1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:27.560
 because like people don't realize this, I think,

1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:29.880
 that we humans long for connection

1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:32.320
 and when you have even the basic interaction

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:36.280
 that's just like supposed to be just like serving you or something,

1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:41.280
 you still project, it's still a source of meaning and connection.

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:47.040
 And so you do have to think about that.

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:49.920
 I mean, how 9,000, you know,

1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:52.000
 the movie maybe doesn't portray it that way,

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.800
 but I'm sure there's a relationship there

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:56.240
 between the astronauts and the robot,

1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.800
 especially when you have greater and greater level

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.800
 of intelligence, maybe that addresses

1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:02.960
 the happiness question too.

1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:06.320
 Yeah, I think there's a great book by Kate Darling,

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:08.200
 who's one of my colleagues at MIT.

1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:09.520
 Yeah, she's amazing.

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:11.520
 She's already been on this podcast,

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:14.840
 but we talk all the time and we're supposed to talk

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.200
 and we've been missing each other

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.000
 and we're gonna make it happen soon.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:18.840
 Yeah.

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:20.520
 Come down to Texas, Kate.

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:21.360
 All right.

1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:23.200
 Anyway, yeah, she's amazing and she has this book,

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:25.160
 and she has her whole work is about this.

1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:26.560
 Connection with robots, yeah.

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:28.480
 This beautiful connection that we have with robots,

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:30.600
 but I think it's greater and greater importance

1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.240
 when it's out in space,

1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:34.920
 because it could help alleviate some of the loneliness.

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:35.760
 Right.

1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:37.400
 One of the projects in the book that I gave you,

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.080
 which is this catalog of the projects

1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:40.760
 that we've worked on over the last five years,

1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:43.960
 is this social robot that was developed at the Media Lab,

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:46.360
 and we, one of the first years in 2017

1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:47.920
 that we flew a Zergy flight,

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:49.680
 we took the social robot along

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:50.800
 and tried to do a little bit

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:53.000
 of a very scaled down human study

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.120
 to look at these questions,

1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:56.920
 because you do imagine that we would form a bond,

1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:58.880
 a real bond with the social robots

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:01.600
 that might be not just serving us on a mission,

1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:04.480
 but really be our teammates on a future mission.

1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:06.640
 And I do think that that could have a powerful role

1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:08.680
 in the mental health and just the stability of a crew

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.920
 is to have some other robot friends come along.

1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:13.320
 What do you, by the way, the book you mentioned

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:18.320
 is into the Anthropocosmos,

1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:21.160
 a whole space catalog from the space catalog.

1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:22.640
 Get that reference.

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:25.280
 Yeah, so call out to Earth catalog,

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:29.520
 a whole space catalog from the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:31.920
 What about the happiness?

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:33.960
 You said that that's one of the problems

1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:35.920
 of when you're out in space.

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:37.480
 How do you keep humans happy?

1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:38.800
 Again, asking for a friend.

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:41.160
 Yes, I mean, one of the big challenges is

1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:44.560
 you can't just open a window or walk out a door

1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:45.960
 and blow off steam, right?

1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:49.320
 You can't just go somewhere to clear your head.

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:52.800
 And in that sense, you need to build habitats

1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:56.960
 that are homes that really care for the humans inside them

1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:59.280
 and have, whether it's biophilia

1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:02.080
 and a place where you can go and feel like you're in nature

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.960
 or a VR headset, which for some people is a porcimal crumb,

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:09.240
 but is maybe better than nothing.

1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:12.960
 You need to be thinking about these technological interventions

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:15.000
 that are gonna have to be part of your home

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.760
 and be part of your maybe day to day ritual

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:20.800
 to keep you steady and balanced and happy

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:22.840
 or feeling fulfilled.

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.080
 What about other humans,

1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:25.560
 relationship with other humans?

1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:28.000
 Did those get weird

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.360
 when you get past a certain number of humans?

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:31.640
 I'm not an expert in this area,

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:33.040
 but an anecdote that I'll share.

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:36.240
 My understanding is that NASA has still not decided

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.400
 whether it's better to send married couples

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:41.040
 or single crew members in terms of,

1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:43.040
 you want some level of stability,

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:45.560
 you don't wanna have the drama of romantic relationships

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:47.600
 like you're alluding to before,

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:50.600
 but they can't decide because married couples also fight

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.080
 and have a really tough dynamic.

1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:54.440
 And so there's a lot of open questions still to answer

1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:57.560
 about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?

1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.840
 And we're starting to test some of these things

1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:01.760
 with the civilian crews that are going up

1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:04.160
 with Inspiration 4, like last fall with SpaceX,

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:07.400
 and Acts 1 that's gonna fly in a few days here in March.

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:10.960
 As we begin to lengthen the time of those civilian crews,

1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:12.480
 I think we'll start to learn a little bit more

1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:15.840
 about just average everyday human to human dynamics

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:18.320
 and not the astronauts that are themselves selected

1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:21.640
 to be perfect human specimens, very good to work with,

1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:23.080
 easy to get along with.

1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.400
 I wish you collected more data about this pandemic

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:29.280
 because I feel like it's a good rough simulation

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:30.480
 of what it'd be out in space.

1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:33.560
 A lot of people were locked down, some married couples,

1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:35.400
 I think a lot of marriages broke up,

1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:37.640
 a lot of marriages got closer together.

1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:41.160
 So it's like, and then the single people,

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:44.720
 some of them went off the cliff and some of them discovered

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.880
 their new happiness and meaning and so on.

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:50.120
 It's a beautiful little experiment, a painful one.

1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:54.880
 Is there a thorough way to really test that to,

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:56.760
 because it's such a costly experiment

1:13:58.600 --> 1:13:59.840
 to send humans up there,

1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:01.600
 but I guess you can always return back to Earth

1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:02.800
 if it's not working out.

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:04.120
 That's what we hope.

1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:07.040
 We hope you don't have like a Apollo 13 situation

1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:08.080
 that doesn't quite make it back,

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:11.960
 but yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge.

1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:13.600
 The moon is only three days away.

1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:15.320
 That's a lot quicker to recover from

1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:17.080
 if there's a psychological problem with the crew

1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:19.440
 or any type of maintenance problem, anything.

1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:23.720
 Three years is such a challenge

1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:25.080
 compared to these other domains

1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:26.280
 that we've been getting more used to

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:28.000
 in terms of human spaceflight.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.800
 So this is a question that we will need to have explored more

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:33.040
 before we start really sending crews to Mars.

1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:36.160
 So you're a young scientist.

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:38.480
 Do you think in your lifetime,

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:43.520
 you will go out into orbit,

1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.360
 you will go out beyond into deep space

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:50.400
 and potentially step you.

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:53.320
 I don't know if you can call yourself a civilian.

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:54.760
 I don't know if that's what you can't ask,

1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:59.760
 but you as a curious ant from MIT,

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:03.680
 land step on Mars.

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:04.520
 Yes.

1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:07.280
 That's a firm.

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:08.120
 Are you coming back?

1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:08.960
 Yeah, I'm coming back.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:10.160
 I don't want that one way mission.

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:12.600
 I want the two way mission, but yes.

1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:14.200
 I mean, I think we're already talking

1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:16.240
 about a pretty near term opportunity

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:17.880
 where I could send graduate students

1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:19.160
 to the International Space Station.

1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:20.000
 Yeah.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.280
 No, not a sacrifice,

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:29.400
 but send graduate students to the ISS to do their research.

1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:31.720
 I do think you and I both would have an opportunity

1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:35.640
 to go to a lunar base of some sort within our lifetime.

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:39.600
 And there's a good chance if we really wanted to,

1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:41.760
 we might have to really advocate for it,

1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:43.280
 apply to an astronaut program.

1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.120
 There will be some avenues for humans

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.800
 in our lifetime to go to Mars.

1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:51.080
 What's the bar for like health?

1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:53.360
 Do you think that bar will keep getting lower and lower

1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:55.320
 in terms of how healthy, how athletic,

1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:57.840
 like how the psychological profile,

1:15:57.840 --> 1:15:59.000
 all those kinds of things?

1:15:59.000 --> 1:15:59.840
 Yeah.

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:01.600
 For one, we're going to build more robust habitats

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.800
 that don't depend on astronauts being

1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:05.320
 so impeccably well trained.

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.280
 So we're going to make it better for inclusion

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.480
 and just opening access to space.

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.800
 But there's a fantastic group called Astra Access

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:16.080
 that is already helping disabled space flyers do zero G

1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:18.480
 flights and potentially get access to the ISS.

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:20.720
 And some of the things that we think of as disabilities

1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:24.800
 on Earth are hyper abilities in space.

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.520
 You don't need really powerful legs in space.

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.760
 What you'd really benefit from having is a third arm,

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.360
 more ways to kind of move yourself around

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:33.640
 and grip and interact.

1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.040
 So we are already seeing a much more open minded approach

1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:40.800
 to who gets to go to space and Astra Access

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:43.400
 is a wonderful organization doing some of that work.

1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:47.640
 I'm hoping introversion will also be a superpower in space.

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:49.960
 OK, well, first I'd love to get your opinion

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:52.600
 on commercial space flight with SpaceX

1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:54.160
 with Blue Origin are doing.

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.240
 And also another question on top of that

1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:01.320
 is because you've worked with a lot of different kinds

1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:05.720
 of people, culturally, what's the difference between SpaceX

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:10.760
 or commercial type of efforts, NASA and MIT?

1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:11.760
 And academia.

1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:12.680
 Academia.

1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:14.400
 Yeah, so the first part of your question,

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:18.320
 I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space.

1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:20.080
 It has really empowered our program.

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:23.280
 So instead of me waiting for five years to get a grant

1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:25.400
 and get the money from the grant and only then can

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:28.080
 you send a project to space, I got my fundraise,

1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:30.720
 a lot like a startup founder, and I directly

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:33.560
 buy access to space on the International Space Station

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:36.160
 through SpaceX or Nanorax, same with Blue Origin

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.720
 and their suborbital craft, same with Axiom now,

1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.480
 Axiom's making plans for their own commercial space station.

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:44.200
 It's not out of the realm of possibility,

1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:48.320
 but in a few years, I will rent lab space in orbit.

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:50.920
 I will rent a module from the Axiom space station

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:53.560
 or the Orbital Reef, which is the Blue Origin space

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:56.520
 station, or Nanorax is thinking about star lab oasis.

1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:57.960
 There's probably some other companies

1:17:57.960 --> 1:18:00.480
 that I'm not even aware of yet that are doing commercial space

1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:00.980
 habitat.

1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:03.040
 So I think that's fabulous.

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:04.800
 And really empowering for our research.

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.360
 Is it affordable?

1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:09.240
 So loosely speaking, does it become

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:13.120
 affordable for MIT type of research lab?

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:18.240
 Or does it need to be a multi university,

1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:19.280
 like a gigantic effort?

1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:19.800
 It's a consortium thing.

1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:20.840
 Yeah, consortium thing.

1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:22.840
 One of the reasons we're spinning out Oralea

1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:24.680
 is we actually realize it's cheap enough.

1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:26.680
 It doesn't even have to be MIT.

1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:29.640
 And we wanted to start democratizing access

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:31.000
 to these spaceflight opportunities

1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.080
 to a much broader swath of humanity.

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:36.720
 Could you take a Khan Academy educational course

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:38.880
 about, hey, students around the world,

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:40.840
 this is how you get ready for a zero G flight?

1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:42.800
 And by the way, come fly with us next year,

1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:44.880
 which is something we're going to do with Oraleas.

1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:48.200
 We're going to bring much more just kind of day to day folks

1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.320
 on zero G flights and get them access

1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:52.680
 to engaging in the space industry.

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.760
 So it's become cheap enough.

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:57.040
 And the prices have dropped enough to consider even that.

1:18:57.040 --> 1:18:58.040
 So that's amazing.

1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:00.080
 It definitely doesn't have to be a consortium of universities

1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:02.040
 anymore, depends on what you want to fly.

1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:04.720
 If you want to fly James Webb, a huge telescope that's

1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:08.600
 decades in the making, sure, you need a NASA allocation

1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:10.480
 budget, you need billions.

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:13.040
 But for a lot of the stuff in the book and our research

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:16.000
 portfolio, it's actually becoming far more accessible.

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:17.520
 So that's commercial.

1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:21.200
 What about NASA and MIT academia?

1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:25.680
 Yeah, I think people have been worried about NASA

1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:28.400
 the last few years because in some people's minds,

1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:31.560
 they are seeding ground to these commercial efforts.

1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:34.360
 But that's really not what's happening.

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.560
 NASA empowered these commercial efforts

1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:40.080
 because they want to free themselves up to go to Mars

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:43.000
 and go to Europa and continue being

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.960
 that really aspirational force for humanity

1:19:45.960 --> 1:19:48.840
 of pushing the boundary, always pushing the boundary.

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:50.840
 And if they were anchored in low Earth orbit,

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:53.200
 maintaining a space station indefinitely,

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:54.760
 that's so much a part of their budget

1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:57.120
 that it was keeping them from being able to do more.

1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:58.960
 So it actually is really fantastic for NASA

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:00.880
 to have grown this commercial ecosystem,

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:03.000
 and then that frees NASA up to go further.

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:04.480
 And in academia, we like to think

1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:08.160
 that we will be able to do the provocative next generation

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:13.080
 research that is going to unlock things at that frontier.

1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:14.840
 And we can partner with NASA.

1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:17.160
 We can go through a program if we want to send a probe out

1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:19.480
 really far, but we can also partner with SpaceX

1:20:19.480 --> 1:20:22.640
 and see what human life in a SpaceX Mars settlement

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:24.840
 might look like and how we could design for that.

1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:27.520
 Speaking of projects, maybe there are other projects

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.040
 that popped to mind from the Space Exploration Initiative

1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:32.920
 or maybe stuff from the book, the convention.

1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:34.240
 Something super cool.

1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:35.760
 I mean, everything we've been talking about is cool,

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:37.760
 but just something that pops to mind again.

1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:40.480
 Yeah, so we talked about life in space

1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:42.880
 and you might need more arms than legs.

1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:44.760
 One of the projects by Valentina Sumini

1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:48.640
 was an air powered robotics tail.

1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:50.360
 So it's a soft robotics tail

1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:51.800
 that essentially has a little camera

1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:54.280
 on the back end of it, can do computer vision

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:55.680
 and knows where to grapple.

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:56.840
 So it's behind you.

1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:59.320
 It grapples onto something and holds you in space

1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:02.080
 and then you can actually free up both of your hands to work.

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:04.040
 So we're already starting to think about the design

1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:07.080
 of bionic humans or prosthetics

1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:09.240
 or things that would make you kind of like a cyborg

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.600
 to augment your capabilities

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.200
 when you're in a space environment.

1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:14.560
 How would you control something like that?

1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:18.000
 So it's kind of like a, I mean, you can't call it a leg,

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:18.840
 but whatever.

1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:20.240
 It's an additional appendage.

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:21.080
 Appendage.

1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:22.560
 So how would you, what are ideas

1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:23.840
 for controlling something like that?

1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:26.560
 Yeah, so right now it's super, yeah, there you go.

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:27.400
 That's cool.

1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:28.720
 Right now it's super manual.

1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:32.400
 It's basically just like a kind of a set pattern

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:34.160
 of inflating as we're testing it.

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.960
 But in the future, if we had a neuro link,

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:36.800
 I mean, this is something

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:39.000
 that you could imagine directly controlling,

1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.360
 just thinking thoughts and controlling it.

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.560
 That's a ways away.

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:43.400
 Yeah.

1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:46.080
 So we talked about on the biology side, astrobiology,

1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:48.720
 there's probably agriculture stuff.

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:51.240
 Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:53.160
 of out in space for survival

1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:56.200
 or the robotics, architectures, the self assembly stuff?

1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:58.920
 So kind of combining something we were talking about,

1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:00.960
 you can form these relationships with objects

1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:02.560
 and anthropomorphize.

1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:03.880
 One of the things that we're thinking about

1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:07.000
 for agriculture created by Manway and Somu,

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.440
 so two students at MIT, was this little,

1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:11.840
 it looks like a planet, but it's inspired by,

1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:14.920
 I think a Mandala or Nepalese spinning wheel.

1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:16.600
 And you plant plants on the inside

1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:19.080
 and the astronaut has to spin it every day

1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:20.800
 to help the plant survive.

1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:22.680
 So it's a way to give the astronaut something

1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:25.320
 to care about, something that they are responsible

1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:28.960
 for keeping alive and can really invest themselves in.

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:30.440
 And it's not necessary, right?

1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:33.360
 We have other ways to grow in orbit,

1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:34.920
 hydroponics, liquid medium,

1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:37.280
 trying to keep the liquid around the plant roots is hard

1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:38.880
 because there's no gravity to pull it down

1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:40.280
 in a particular direction.

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:42.480
 But what I loved about this project was they said,

1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:45.400
 sure, we have ways that the plants could grow on their own,

1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:47.880
 but the astronauts might wanna care for it

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.480
 in the same way that we have little plants

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:52.520
 that come to be important to us, little plant friends.

1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:53.680
 Yeah, so there's AgriFuge.

1:22:53.680 --> 1:22:55.840
 That's an early model of this spinning,

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.120
 manually spinning plant habitat.

1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:01.600
 I guess this is the best of academic research

1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:03.240
 is you can do these kinds of wild ideas.

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:04.600
 Wild ideas, yeah.

1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:07.320
 Well, you know, I get to spend quite a bit of time

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:12.120
 with Mr. Elon Musk and he's very stressed,

1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:14.600
 especially about starship

1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:16.320
 and all those kinds of engineering efforts.

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:17.880
 Yeah.

1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:20.680
 What do you think about how damn hard it is

1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:23.600
 to get out of this space?

1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:25.800
 Like are we humans gonna be able to do this?

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:27.840
 I don't know.

1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:30.360
 I think it feels like it's an engineering problem,

1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:31.480
 it's a scientific problem,

1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:33.480
 but it's also just a motivation problem

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.480
 for the entire human species.

1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:39.600
 And you also need to have superstar researchers

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:40.880
 and engineers working on it.

1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:43.000
 So you have to get like the best people in the world,

1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:47.320
 inspire them and starting from a young age and kind of...

1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:49.080
 It wasn't calcating us into why we do it.

1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:50.440
 I mean, I guess that's why it's exciting.

1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:52.360
 You don't know if we're gonna be able to pull this off.

1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:56.360
 Like we could like fail miserably.

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:57.840
 And that, I suppose, I mean,

1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:00.040
 that's where the best of engineering is done,

1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:02.960
 is like success is not guaranteed.

1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:06.360
 And even if it happens, it might be very painful.

1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:07.280
 I think that's what's so special

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:09.000
 about what Elon is doing with SpaceX

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.080
 is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively

1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:14.960
 and he'll, we'll see the spectacular failures

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:17.560
 on the path to a successful starship.

1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.400
 It's something that, you know,

1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:20.040
 people have said, why isn't NASA doing that?

1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:22.520
 Well, that's cause NASA is doing that with taxpayer dollars

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:25.200
 and we would all revolt if we saw NASA failing

1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:26.280
 at all these different stages.

1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:27.680
 But that level of, you know,

1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:30.280
 spiral engineering theory of development

1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:31.640
 isn't super impressive.

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:32.840
 And it's a really interesting approach

1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:34.440
 that SpaceX has taken.

1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:38.000
 And I think between people like Elon and Jeff Bezos

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:41.600
 and Firefly and NASA and ESO, we are gonna get there.

1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:43.240
 They're building the road to space.

1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:45.080
 These trailblazers are doing it.

1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:47.840
 And now part of the challenge is to get the rest

1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:52.080
 of the public to understand that it's happening, right?

1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:54.320
 A lot of people don't know that we're going back to the moon,

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:56.560
 that we're gonna send the first woman to the moon

1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:57.840
 within a few years.

1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:58.720
 A lot of people don't know

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:00.760
 that there are commercial space stations in orbit,

1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:03.400
 that it's not just NASA that does space stuff.

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:06.560
 So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:08.560
 excited and educated and involved again,

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:09.920
 kind of like in the Apollo era

1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:12.440
 where it was a big deal for everybody.

1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:15.200
 Well, a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:18.640
 that Elon does, I think, extremely well

1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:21.360
 is the social media, is the getting people excited.

1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:25.120
 And I think that actually he's helped NASA step their game up

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:26.600
 in terms of social media.

1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:28.760
 There's something about, yeah, the storytelling,

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:33.760
 but also not like authentic and just real

1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:36.280
 and raw engineering.

1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:40.600
 There's a lot of excitement for that humor and fun also.

1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:42.640
 All of those things you realize,

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:46.160
 the thing that make up the virality of the meme

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.760
 is beautiful, you have to kind of embrace that.

1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:52.360
 And to me, this kind of,

1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:56.120
 I criticize a lot of companies based on this.

1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:59.400
 I talked to a bunch of CEOs and so on.

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:01.080
 And it's just like, there's a caution,

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:04.680
 like let us do this press conference thing

1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:06.840
 where when the final product is ready

1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:10.520
 and it's overproduced as opposed to the raw, the gritty,

1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:11.360
 just show it off.

1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:14.040
 I mean, something that I think MIT is very good at doing

1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:17.560
 is just showing the raw by nature, the mess of it.

1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:18.960
 And the mess of it is beautiful

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:20.080
 and people get really excited

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:21.800
 and failure is really exciting.

1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:23.960
 When the thing blows up and you're like, oh shit,

1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:27.080
 that makes it even more exciting when it doesn't blow up

1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.040
 and doing all of that on social media

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:31.680
 and showing also the humans behind it,

1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:35.240
 the individual young researchers or the engineers

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.480
 or the leaders where everything's at stake.

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:40.840
 I don't know, I think I'm really excited about that.

1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:43.840
 I do want MIT to do that more for students

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:47.280
 to show off their stuff and not be pressured

1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:51.120
 to do this kind of generic official presentation,

1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:54.480
 but show their, become a YouTuber also.

1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:55.960
 Like show off your raw research

1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:58.120
 as you're working on it in the early days.

1:26:58.120 --> 1:26:59.480
 I hope that's the future.

1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:02.280
 Things like, I was teasing about TikTok earlier,

1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:07.360
 but these kinds of things, I think inspire young people

1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.280
 to show off their stuff, to show their true self,

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:12.120
 the rawness of it,

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:14.000
 because I think that's where engineering is best.

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.160
 And I think that will inspire people

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:19.000
 about all the cool stuff we could do in space.

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.280
 I shouldn't say, I couldn't agree more.

1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.000
 And I actually think that this is why we need

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.760
 a real life Starfleet Academy right now.

1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:27.160
 It was the place where the space cadets got to go

1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.440
 to learn about how to engage in a future of life in space.

1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:33.920
 And we can do it in a much better way.

1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:35.960
 There are a bunch of groups that traditionally haven't thought

1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.880
 that they could engage in aerospace,

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:38.960
 whether it's because you were told

1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:40.720
 you had to be into math and science.

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:42.200
 Now we need space lawyers,

1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:44.280
 we need space artists like Grimes, right?

1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:48.160
 We need really creative, profoundly interesting people

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:50.760
 to want to see themselves in that future.

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:53.960
 I think it's a big challenge to us in the space industry

1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:56.520
 to also do some more diversity, equity and inclusion

1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:58.960
 and show a broader swath of society

1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:01.960
 that there's a future for them in this space exploration vision.

1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:03.200
 Let me push back on one thing.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:04.520
 We don't need space lawyers.

1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:06.680
 I'm just kidding, it's a joke.

1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.840
 We do, we do, we do.

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:11.440
 Okay, we do, the lawyers are great, I love them.

1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:13.840
 Okay, let me ask a big ridiculous question.

1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:16.600
 What is the most beautiful idea

1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:19.240
 to you about space exploration?

1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:22.600
 Whether it's the engineering, the astrobiology,

1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:26.240
 the science, the inspiration,

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:30.280
 that the human happiness or aliens, I don't know.

1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:35.280
 What do you like inspires you every day

1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:39.600
 in terms of its beauty, in terms of its awe?

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:43.280
 As a ex physicist, what I've always found so profound

1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.080
 is just that at really, really small scales

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:50.200
 like particle physics and really, really big scales

1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:53.000
 like astrophysics, there are similarities

1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.600
 in the way that those systems behave and look

1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:59.440
 and there's a certain beautiful symmetry in the universe

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.120
 that's just kind of waiting for us

1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:04.280
 to tie together the physics and really understand it.

1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.760
 That is something that just really captivates me

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:09.920
 and I would love to, even though I'm now much more

1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:12.480
 on the applied space exploration side,

1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:14.240
 I really try to keep up with what's happening

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.160
 in those physics areas,

1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:18.400
 because I think that will be a huge answer for humanity

1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:21.480
 along the lines of are we alone in the universe?

1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:24.200
 One of the fascinating things about you

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.120
 is you have a degree in physics, mathematics,

1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:32.080
 and philosophy and now, I don't know what would you call

1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:34.320
 aerospace engineering, maybe kind of thing.

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:36.960
 So you have a foot in all of these worlds,

1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:41.960
 the theoretic, the sort of the beauty of that world

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.680
 and the philosophy somehow is in there

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:48.400
 and now the very practical, pragmatic implementation

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.880
 of all these wild ideas.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.320
 Plus your incredible communicator, all those things.

1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:56.120
 What did you pick up from those different disciplines?

1:29:56.120 --> 1:29:59.400
 Or maybe I'm just romanticizing all those different disciplines.

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:02.760
 But what did you pick up from the variety

1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:06.200
 of that physics, mathematics, philosophy?

1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:07.880
 What I loved about having this chance

1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:10.120
 to do a liberal arts education

1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:13.400
 was trying to understand the human condition

1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:16.440
 and I think more designers for space exploration

1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:17.720
 should be thinking about that

1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:19.800
 because there's so much depth of,

1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:23.320
 like we were talking about issues and opportunities

1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:25.560
 around human connection, human life,

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:29.400
 meaning in life, how do you find fulfillment or happiness?

1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:31.200
 And I think if you approach these questions

1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:34.000
 just purely from the standpoint of an engineer or a scientist,

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:38.280
 you'll miss some of what makes it a life worth living.

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:40.400
 And so I love being able to combine

1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:41.800
 some of this notion of philosophy

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:43.680
 and the human condition with my work.

1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:46.280
 But I'm also a pragmatist and I didn't wanna stay

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:49.960
 just purely in these big picture questions about the universe.

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.320
 I wanted to have an impact on society

1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:55.960
 and I also felt like I had such a wonderful childhood

1:30:55.960 --> 1:31:00.960
 and a really fantastic setup that I owe society some work

1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:04.400
 to really make a positive impact

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:05.640
 for a broader swath of citizens.

1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:07.800
 And so that kind of led me from the physics domain

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.320
 to thinking about engineering

1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:11.240
 and practical questions for life in space.

1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:13.960
 In physics, was there a dream?

1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:16.120
 Are you also captivated by this search

1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:19.400
 for the theory of everything that kind of unlocks

1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:23.600
 the deeper and deeper in the simple, elegant way,

1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:25.320
 the function of our universe?

1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:27.120
 Do you think they'll be useful for us

1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:30.360
 for the actual practical engineering things

1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:31.520
 that you're working on now?

1:31:31.520 --> 1:31:32.360
 It could be.

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:35.200
 I mean, I worked at CERN for two summers in undergrad

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:37.560
 and we were looking for supersymmetry,

1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:40.040
 which was one of these alternatives to the standard model.

1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:41.640
 And it was sad because my professors

1:31:41.640 --> 1:31:43.200
 were getting sadder and sadder

1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:44.520
 because they weren't finding it.

1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:47.080
 They were excluding what we would call this parameter space

1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:50.040
 of finding these supersymmetric particles.

1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:53.120
 But the search for what that theory of everything could be

1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:55.480
 or a grand unified theory that kind of answers

1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:58.360
 some of the holes within the standard model of physics

1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:02.320
 would presumably kind of unlock a better understanding

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:05.480
 of certain fundamental physical laws

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.000
 that we should be able to build a better understanding

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.720
 of engineering and day to day services from that.

1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:13.120
 It might not be an immediately obvious thing.

1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:15.160
 When we discovered the Higgs boson,

1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:16.600
 I was there at CERN that day.

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.840
 It was July 4th, 2012 that it was announced.

1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:22.240
 We all waited like nerds overnight in line

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:23.800
 to get into the announcement chamber.

1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:25.760
 I had never waited for even like a Harry Potter premiere

1:32:25.760 --> 1:32:27.760
 in my life, but we waited for this like announcement

1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:30.840
 of the Higgs boson to get into the chamber overnight.

1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:33.840
 But did that immediately translate

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:35.680
 to technology for engineering?

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:39.200
 No, but it's still a really important part

1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:41.560
 of our understanding of these fundamental laws of physics.

1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:43.160
 And so I don't know that it's always immediate,

1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:44.680
 but I think it is really critical knowledge

1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:46.920
 for humanity to seek.

1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:50.680
 It might just shake up our understanding of the world.

1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:52.880
 What scares me is it might help us create

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.160
 more dangerous weapons.

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.680
 So, and then we'll figure out that great filter situation.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:00.800
 And I still believe that human compassion and love

1:33:02.120 --> 1:33:04.240
 is actually the way to defend against all these greater

1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:07.760
 and greater and more impressive weapons.

1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:10.160
 Let me ask a weird question.

1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:12.520
 In terms of you disagreeing with others,

1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.640
 what important idea do you believe is true

1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:20.400
 that many others don't agree with you on?

1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:22.280
 Maybe it's a tough question.

1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:23.840
 You might have to think about that one,

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:26.360
 but whether it's very specific,

1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:28.840
 like which material to use or something

1:33:28.840 --> 1:33:30.720
 about a particular project,

1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:35.240
 or it could be grand priorities on missions.

1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:36.960
 I think one you actually mentioned is interesting

1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:40.680
 is like the thing we should be looking for

1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:43.040
 is like colonization of space

1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:45.080
 versus colonization of planets.

1:33:45.080 --> 1:33:46.400
 Meaning like...

1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:47.560
 That's probably my best hot take

1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:49.120
 that people would just agree with me on

1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:51.880
 is life in floating cities

1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:54.880
 as opposed to life on the surface.

1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:58.360
 How do you envision that like spread of humans?

1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:00.760
 Because you said at the beginning of the conversation,

1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:03.840
 something about like scale, increasing the scale,

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:05.600
 basically humans in space.

1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:09.520
 Are they just like, they're in orbit

1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:11.640
 and then they get a little farther and farther out?

1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:15.800
 Like, do you see these kind of floating cities

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.480
 just getting farther and farther from Earth?

1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:18.960
 They can always kind of return.

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:22.040
 But like, if you look a few centuries from now,

1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:24.560
 do you just see us all these like floating cities?

1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:25.400
 Yeah.

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:30.400
 And it just kind of envelops the space around us.

1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:32.360
 And it's like neighborhoods.

1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:33.200
 Yeah, it needs to be.

1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:36.800
 It's like rural and there's like giant structures

1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:39.000
 and there's small pirate structures

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:40.000
 and that kind of stuff.

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:40.840
 Structures, yeah.

1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:43.440
 I think low Earth orbit might come to look like that.

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:45.720
 And it's a really interesting regulatory challenge

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:49.240
 to make sure that there's some cross purposes.

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:51.640
 So the more cool space cities we have in orbit,

1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:53.840
 the more shiny objects in the night sky,

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:55.360
 the worst it is for astronomers

1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:58.120
 in a really kind of overly simplified case.

1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:00.880
 So there's some pushback to this like amoebaing

1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:05.160
 where we just grow kind of incongruously

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:08.040
 or indiscriminately as an amoeba in low Earth orbit.

1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:10.680
 Beyond that though, I think we'll grow in pockets

1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:12.240
 where there are resources.

1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:15.880
 So we won't just expand around the gravity well of Earth.

1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:18.640
 We'll do some development around the moon,

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.240
 some development around asteroids,

1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:21.800
 some development around Mars,

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:23.320
 because there'll always be purposes

1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:25.520
 for which we wanna go down to a physical object

1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:28.520
 and study it or extract something or learn from it.

1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:32.040
 But I think we'll grow in fits and starts in pockets.

1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:35.200
 Some of the coolest pockets are the gravity balanced pockets

1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:36.800
 like the Lagrange points,

1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:38.880
 which is where we just sent, we not me personally,

1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:42.120
 but NASA just sent James Webb, the big telescope.

1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:44.480
 I think it's at L2, so.

1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:46.480
 What's the nice feature about those pockets?

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.480
 So it's a stable orbit.

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:50.520
 There are several different Lagrange points.

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.400
 And so it just requires less energy

1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:54.320
 to stay where you're trying to stay.

1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:57.480
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:59.840
 What's also fascinating is the interaction

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.840
 between nations on that regard, like who owns that.

1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:09.240
 Do you, would you say in those floating cities,

1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:12.240
 do you envision independent governments?

1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:14.520
 That was gonna be my next answer to you,

1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.520
 which pushed me harder for a more provocative question

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:19.360
 where I might disagree with other people.

1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:22.760
 I don't yet have my own opinions fully formed on this,

1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:24.280
 but we are trying to figure out right now

1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:25.880
 what happens to the moon

1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:29.840
 with all of these first come, first served actors

1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:32.400
 just arriving and setting precedents

1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:34.560
 that might really affect future access.

1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:37.280
 And one example is property rights.

1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:40.080
 We do want companies that have the expertise

1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:41.880
 to go to the moon and mine stuff

1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:45.800
 that will help us develop a human settlement

1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:47.160
 there or a gateway.

1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:49.200
 But companies need to know generally

1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:50.800
 that they have rights to a certain area

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.160
 or that they have some legal right

1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:53.760
 to sell things that they're getting.

1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:55.760
 Does that mean we're gonna grant property rights

1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:58.760
 on the moon to companies who has the right

1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:00.720
 to give that right away?

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.760
 So there's a bunch of really kind of gnarly questions

1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:03.600
 that we have to think about,

1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:04.960
 that's why I think we need space lawyers.

1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:07.640
 Maybe that's the true provocative answers.

1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:08.480
 I think we need space lawyers.

1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:10.960
 True, I mean, yeah, yeah.

1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:13.640
 I mean, but those questions again, as you said,

1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:17.160
 eloquently will help us answer questions about here.

1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:18.320
 We hope so, yeah.

1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:20.960
 It is a little strange.

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.120
 I mean, it's obvious, but it's also strange.

1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:25.680
 If you look at the big picture of it all,

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:28.960
 that we draw these like borders around geographical areas

1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:30.360
 and we say, this is mine.

1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:31.520
 Right.

1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:34.960
 Like, and then we fight wars over what's mine or not.

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:39.240
 It seems like there's possible alternatives,

1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:42.960
 but also it seems like there needs to be a public ownership

1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:45.520
 of some parts, like, you know,

1:37:45.520 --> 1:37:47.320
 what is it, Central Park in New York?

1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:50.520
 Is there something like preserving?

1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:52.440
 The commons.

1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:53.280
 Yeah, the commons.

1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:54.120
 The commons.

1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:57.360
 That's why we titled the book into the Anthropocosmos.

1:37:57.360 --> 1:37:59.720
 We know it's a long and kind of a mouthful,

1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:02.400
 but this notion of the Anthropocene,

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:04.960
 we have a lot of commons problems in humanity.

1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:07.040
 How are we treating the Earth global climate change?

1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:09.240
 How are we going to treat and behave in space?

1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:12.960
 How can we be responsible stewards of the space commons?

1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:15.160
 And I would love to see an approach to the moon

1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:17.280
 that is commons based,

1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:19.800
 but it's hard to know who would be the protector

1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:22.000
 or the enforcer of that.

1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.160
 And if it's, which it will be probably in the early days,

1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.120
 a lot of companies sort of working on the moon,

1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:30.840
 working on Mars, working out in space,

1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:33.080
 it feels like there still needs to be

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.400
 a civilian representation of like the greater effort

1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:38.680
 or something like that,

1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:40.160
 like where there should be a president,

1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.840
 there should be a democracy of some kind

1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:43.880
 where people can vote.

1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.320
 Some representative government.

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:49.200
 Those are all, again, the same human questions.

1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.000
 What advice would you give to a young person today

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.840
 thinking about what they want to do with their life, career?

1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:01.520
 So somebody in high school, somebody in college,

1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:03.280
 maybe somebody that looks up to the stars

1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:06.080
 and dreams to one day, take it one way,

1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:09.880
 take it to Mars or to contribute something to the effort.

1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:12.800
 I'd say you should feel empowered

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.080
 because it's really the first time in human history

1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:19.960
 that we're at this cusp of interplanetary civilization.

1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:22.240
 And I don't think we're gonna lapse back from it.

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:25.200
 So the future is incredibly bright for young people

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:26.680
 that even younger than you and I,

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.560
 who will actually really get a chance to go to Mars

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:29.320
 for certain.

1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.800
 The other thing I would say is be open minded

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.360
 about what your own interests are.

1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.480
 I don't think you anymore have to be shoehorned

1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:39.200
 into a particular career to be welcomed

1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:41.320
 into the future of space exploration.

1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:43.800
 If you are an artist and that is your passion,

1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:47.400
 but you would love to do space art or if not space art,

1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:49.920
 use your artistry to communicate a feeling

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.880
 or a message about space.

1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:54.400
 That's a role that we desperately need

1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:57.880
 just as much as we need space scientists and space engineers.

1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:00.200
 Well, when you look at your own life,

1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:02.800
 you're an incredibly accomplished scientist,

1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:05.000
 young scientist, but you know,

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.960
 and you hopped around from physics to aerospace.

1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:11.640
 So going from the biggest theoretical ideas

1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:14.280
 to the biggest practical ideas,

1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:15.760
 is there something from your own journey

1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:17.760
 you can give advice to?

1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:22.280
 Like how to end up doing incredible research at MIT?

1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:26.720
 Maybe the role of the university and college

1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:29.440
 and education and learning, all that kind of stuff.

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.160
 I'd say one piece of advice is find really good teammates

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:35.320
 because I get to be the one that's talking to you,

1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:38.960
 but there are 50 graduate students, staff and faculty

1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:41.680
 that are part of my organization back at MIT.

1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:43.200
 And I'm actually, you guys can't see it on camera,

1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:45.600
 but I'm sitting here with my co founder and COO,

1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:46.440
 Danielle Delotte.

1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:50.920
 And that is really what makes these large scale challenges

1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:52.640
 for humanity possible,

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:55.200
 is really fantastic teams working together

1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:57.440
 to scale more than what I could do alone.

1:40:57.440 --> 1:40:58.680
 So I think that that's an important model

1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:00.440
 that we don't talk about enough in academia.

1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:03.760
 There's a big push for this like lone wolf genius figure

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.080
 in academia, but that's certainly not been the case

1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:06.920
 in my life.

1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:08.920
 I've had wonderful collaborators

1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:10.760
 and people that I work with along the team.

1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:12.640
 Also cross disciplinary.

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:13.480
 Absolutely.

1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:15.400
 Yeah, cross disciplinary, interdisciplinary,

1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:17.320
 whatever you want to call it, but.

1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:19.000
 Artist, where do artists come in?

1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:20.280
 Do you work with artists?

1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:22.160
 We do, we have an arts curator

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:24.200
 on the space exploration initiative side.

1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:25.720
 She helps make sure partly

1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:27.640
 around that communication challenge that we talked about

1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:30.760
 that we're not just doing zero G flights and space missions,

1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:34.400
 but that we take our artifacts of this sci fi space future

1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:37.200
 to museums and galleries and exhibits.

1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:41.800
 She pushed me to make sure her name is Shinglu.

1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:44.480
 She pushed me for our first ISS mission.

1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:46.720
 I was just gathering all the engineering payloads

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:48.600
 that I wanted to support for the students to fly,

1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:49.760
 including my own work.

1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:50.680
 And she said, you know what?

1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:54.040
 We should do an open call internationally for artists

1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:55.960
 to send something to the ISS.

1:41:55.960 --> 1:41:57.760
 And we found out it was the first time

1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:00.120
 we were the first ever international open call

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.920
 for art to go to the ISS.

1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:04.640
 And that was thanks to Shing, an artist bringing a perspective

1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:07.120
 that I might not have thought about prioritizing.

1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:08.000
 So.

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.080
 Yeah, that's awesome.

1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:11.120
 So when you look out there,

1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:12.920
 it's the flame of human consciousness.

1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:16.200
 There does seem to be something quite special about us humans.

1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:21.200
 Well, first of all, what do you think it is?

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000
 What's consciousness?

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.760
 What are we trying to preserve here?

1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:32.040
 What is it about humans that should be preserved

1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:33.880
 or life here on earth?

1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:37.880
 They, what gives you hope to try to expand it out

1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:38.960
 farther and farther?

1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.140
 Like what makes you sad if it was all gone?

1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.580
 I think we're a remarkable species

1:42:45.580 --> 1:42:49.140
 that we are aware of our own thoughts.

1:42:49.140 --> 1:42:51.980
 We are meta aware of our own thoughts and of ourselves.

1:42:51.980 --> 1:42:53.940
 And are able to speak on a podcast

1:42:53.940 --> 1:42:56.380
 about our meta awareness about our own thoughts.

1:42:56.380 --> 1:42:58.380
 About our own thoughts, yeah, turtles all the way down.

1:43:00.180 --> 1:43:02.380
 I think that that is a really special gift

1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:03.940
 that we have been given as a species

1:43:03.940 --> 1:43:06.940
 and that there's a worth to expanding

1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:08.740
 our circles of awareness.

1:43:08.740 --> 1:43:11.340
 So we're very aware of as an earth based species.

1:43:11.340 --> 1:43:13.180
 We've become a little bit of more aware

1:43:13.180 --> 1:43:15.420
 of the fragility of earth and how special a place it is

1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:17.420
 when we go to the moon and we look back.

1:43:17.420 --> 1:43:21.220
 What would it mean for us to have a presence

1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:26.220
 and our purpose in life as a inter solar system species

1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:28.020
 or eventually an intergalactic species?

1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:31.580
 I think it's a really profound opportunity for exploration

1:43:31.580 --> 1:43:33.980
 for the sake of exploration.

1:43:33.980 --> 1:43:35.780
 A real gift for the human mind.

1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:40.540
 Yeah, for anything we're curious creatures.

1:43:40.540 --> 1:43:43.260
 You see, you do believe we might one day

1:43:43.260 --> 1:43:46.380
 become intergalactic civilization.

1:43:46.380 --> 1:43:47.740
 Long, long time from now.

1:43:47.740 --> 1:43:50.020
 We have a lot of propulsion challenges

1:43:50.020 --> 1:43:51.540
 to answer to get that far.

1:43:51.540 --> 1:43:53.180
 So you have a hope for this.

1:43:53.180 --> 1:43:54.780
 Yeah.

1:43:54.780 --> 1:43:57.620
 Another big ridiculous question building on top of that.

1:43:57.620 --> 1:44:00.260
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:44:00.260 --> 1:44:03.860
 This individual life of ours, your life

1:44:03.860 --> 1:44:06.340
 that unfortunately has to come to an end

1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:07.740
 as far as we know for now.

1:44:07.740 --> 1:44:09.220
 Yeah.

1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:13.940
 And our life here together, is there a why?

1:44:13.940 --> 1:44:18.940
 Or do we just kind of like let our curiosity carry us away?

1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:21.580
 Oh, interesting.

1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:25.380
 Is there a single kind of driving purpose why

1:44:25.380 --> 1:44:28.020
 or can it just be curiosity based?

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.700
 I certainly feel, and this is not the scientist

1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:34.100
 in me talking, but just more of like a human soul talking.

1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:38.460
 I certainly feel some sense of purpose

1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:39.620
 and meaning in my life.

1:44:39.620 --> 1:44:42.260
 And there's a version of that that's a very local level

1:44:42.260 --> 1:44:44.900
 within my family, which is funny because this whole conversation

1:44:44.900 --> 1:44:47.100
 has been big grand space exploration themes,

1:44:47.100 --> 1:44:48.860
 but you asked me this question and my first thought

1:44:48.860 --> 1:44:50.780
 is what really matters to me, my family,

1:44:50.780 --> 1:44:53.540
 my biological reproducing unit.

1:44:56.180 --> 1:44:57.940
 But then there's also another purpose,

1:44:57.940 --> 1:44:59.820
 like another version of the meaning in my life

1:44:59.820 --> 1:45:02.460
 that is trying to do good things for humanity.

1:45:02.460 --> 1:45:05.020
 So that sense that we can be individual humans

1:45:05.020 --> 1:45:06.780
 and have our local meaning,

1:45:06.780 --> 1:45:08.660
 and we can also be global humans,

1:45:08.660 --> 1:45:10.540
 maybe someday like the Star Trek utopia

1:45:10.540 --> 1:45:12.500
 will all be global citizens.

1:45:12.500 --> 1:45:14.460
 I don't want to sound too naive,

1:45:15.500 --> 1:45:17.300
 but there is I think that beauty to a meaning

1:45:17.300 --> 1:45:20.140
 and a purpose of your life that's bigger than yourself,

1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:21.980
 working on something that's bigger and grander

1:45:21.980 --> 1:45:23.660
 than just yourself.

1:45:23.660 --> 1:45:26.540
 The deepest meaning is from the local biological

1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:30.100
 reproduction unit, and then it goes to the engineering

1:45:30.100 --> 1:45:35.100
 scientific, what is it, corporate like company unit

1:45:35.260 --> 1:45:37.380
 that can actually produce and compete

1:45:37.380 --> 1:45:38.660
 and interact with the world.

1:45:38.660 --> 1:45:41.380
 And then there's the giant human unit

1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:44.020
 that's struggling with pandemics.

1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:45.340
 And commons.

1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:49.260
 And together struggling against the forces of nature

1:45:49.260 --> 1:45:50.860
 that keeps wanting to kill us.

1:45:50.860 --> 1:45:52.980
 Yeah, there'd be nothing like an alien invasion

1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:55.020
 to unite the planet, we think.

1:45:55.020 --> 1:45:58.020
 I can't wait, bring it on aliens.

1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:00.180
 Listen, your work, you're an incredible,

1:46:00.180 --> 1:46:01.740
 communicating, incredible young scientist,

1:46:01.740 --> 1:46:04.900
 it's huge honor that you would spend your time with me.

1:46:04.900 --> 1:46:07.740
 I can't wait what you do in the future.

1:46:07.740 --> 1:46:11.020
 And thank you for representing MIT so beautifully,

1:46:11.020 --> 1:46:12.820
 so masterfully, you're an incredible person.

1:46:12.820 --> 1:46:13.660
 Thank you for talking to me.

1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:14.660
 Thank you so much for having me.

1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:15.700
 It's been an absolute pleasure.

1:46:15.700 --> 1:46:17.660
 It's a great conversation.

1:46:17.660 --> 1:46:19.180
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:20.740
 with Ariel at Bloch.

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:46:27.900 --> 1:46:31.220
 from Seneca, the Roman Stoic philosopher.

1:46:32.300 --> 1:46:36.420
 There is no easy way from Earth to the stars.

1:46:36.420 --> 1:46:58.420
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
