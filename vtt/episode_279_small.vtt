00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
 I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

00:01.720 --> 00:02.600
 I would like to know.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.520
 Two alien civilizations coexisting on a planet.

00:05.560 --> 00:06.960
 What's that look like exactly?

00:07.080 --> 00:11.160
 When you see them and they see you, you're assuming they have vision.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.200
 They have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.200
 There's a lot of assumptions we're making.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.400
 What human level intelligence has done is quite different.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.680
 It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.280
 It's that we can imagine ones that have never existed.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.120
 And we can actually make them come into existence.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.160
 So you can travel back in time sometimes.

00:32.480 --> 00:32.920
 Yes.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.880
 You travel forward in time to travel back.

00:35.000 --> 00:35.360
 Yes.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.200
 The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.880
 They have each been on this podcast once before individually.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.320
 And now for their second time, they're here together.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.480
 Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.040
 Lee is a chemist.

00:55.040 --> 01:00.480
 And if I may say so, the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.880
 They both are interested in how life originates and develops both life here on

01:05.880 --> 01:12.240
 earth and alien life, including intelligent alien civilizations out there in the cosmos.

01:12.920 --> 01:18.120
 They are colleagues and friends who love to explore, disagree and debate nuanced

01:18.120 --> 01:19.600
 points about alien life.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.560
 And so we're calling this an alien debate.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.840
 Very few questions to me are as fascinating as what do aliens look like?

01:28.080 --> 01:29.480
 How do we recognize them?

01:29.800 --> 01:30.800
 How do we talk to them?

01:31.240 --> 01:35.520
 And how do we make sense of life here on earth in the context of all possible

01:35.520 --> 01:37.040
 life forms that are out there?

01:37.720 --> 01:41.760
 Treating these questions with the seriousness and rigor they deserve.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.400
 So that I hope to do with this conversation and future ones like it.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.040
 Our world is shrouded in mystery.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.640
 We must first be humbled to acknowledge this and then be bold and diving in and

01:53.640 --> 01:55.200
 trying to figure things out anyway.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.800
 This is Alex Friedman podcast to support it.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.200
 Please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.440
 And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.960
 First of all, welcome back, Sarah.

02:08.960 --> 02:09.840
 Welcome back, Lee.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.440
 You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.440
 You're incredible people.

02:12.440 --> 02:16.040
 I should say thank you to Sarah for wearing really awesome boots.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.440
 We'll probably overlay a picture of what we're wearing.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.600
 Sure, later on.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.600
 But why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?

02:21.680 --> 02:22.920
 No, this is me dressed up.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.520
 You were saying that you're pink, that your thing is pink.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.440
 My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.000
 Where's the pink?

02:31.120 --> 02:34.080
 When did it hit you that pink is your color?

02:34.080 --> 02:40.720
 I became pink about, I don't know, actually, maybe 2017?

02:40.960 --> 02:42.800
 Did you know me when you first...

02:42.800 --> 02:43.960
 I think I met you pre pink.

02:44.000 --> 02:44.440
 Yeah, yeah.

02:44.440 --> 02:49.760
 So about 2017, I think I just decided I was boring and I needed to make a

02:49.760 --> 02:51.480
 statement and red was too bright.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.040
 So I went pink, salmon pink.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.280
 Well, I think you were always pink.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.320
 You just found yourself in 2019.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.840
 There's an amazing photo of him where there's like everybody in their black

03:01.840 --> 03:03.560
 gown and he's just wearing the pink pants.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.200
 Well, that wasn't a wagon in university.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.200
 It's totally nuts.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.480
 100 year anniversary.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.760
 They got me to give the plenary and they didn't find the outfit for me.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.080
 So they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.680
 And there was me dressed up in pink, looking like a complete idiot.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.800
 We're definitely going to have to find that picture and overlay a big full

03:19.800 --> 03:21.600
 screen, slow motion.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.640
 All right, let's talk about aliens.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.880
 We'll find places we disagree in places we agree.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.800
 Life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.800
 Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson, stating his skepticism

03:36.800 --> 03:38.840
 about aliens wanting to visit Earth.

03:38.840 --> 03:44.160
 Quote, how egocentric of us to think that space aliens who have mastered

03:44.160 --> 03:51.160
 interstellar travel across the galaxy would give, pardon the French, would

03:51.160 --> 03:53.480
 give a shit about humans on Earth.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.480
 So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth observing, communicating

03:58.480 --> 03:59.120
 with humans?

03:59.720 --> 04:01.560
 Let's take a perspective of aliens.

04:01.560 --> 04:07.720
 Maybe Sarah first, are we interesting in the whole spectrum

04:07.720 --> 04:09.600
 of life in the universe?

04:10.480 --> 04:13.600
 I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now, we're the most

04:13.600 --> 04:14.840
 interesting thing in the universe.

04:15.760 --> 04:23.320
 So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity that we have and how much

04:23.320 --> 04:27.640
 I think that's deeply related to the physics of what we are, that other intelligent

04:27.640 --> 04:32.600
 aliens would want to seek out examples of the phenomena they are to understand

04:32.600 --> 04:33.400
 themselves better.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.600
 And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.680
 And I don't think there's any kind of judgment on it being a lesser

04:40.680 --> 04:41.400
 being or not.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.800
 It's like saying you have nothing to learn by talking to a baby.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.080
 You have lots to learn, probably more than you do talking to somebody

04:47.080 --> 04:47.760
 that's 90.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.760
 So, yeah, so I think they absolutely would.

04:50.760 --> 04:56.120
 So whatever the phenomena is that is human, there would be an inkling of the

04:56.120 --> 04:59.560
 same kind of phenomena within alien species and they would be seeking that same.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.800
 I think there's got to be some features of us that are universal.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.720
 And I think the ones that are most interesting, and I hope I live in an

05:06.720 --> 05:14.320
 interesting universe, are the ones that are driven by our curiosity and the fact

05:14.320 --> 05:18.840
 that our intelligence allows us to do things that the universe wouldn't be

05:18.840 --> 05:20.720
 able to do without things like us existing.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.520
 We're going to define a lot of terms.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.840
 One of them is interesting.

05:25.360 --> 05:25.680
 Yes.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.400
 That's a very interesting term to try to define.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.120
 Ali, what do you think are humans interesting for aliens?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.560
 Well, let's take it from our perspective.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.040
 We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.640
 So if we put the shoe on the other foot, of course, we're interesting.

05:40.120 --> 05:44.280
 But I'm wondering, and assuming that we're at the right technological

05:44.280 --> 05:47.960
 capabilities to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.360
 So what I mean is, if there needs to be a massive leap in technology that we

05:52.360 --> 05:57.640
 don't have, how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?

05:57.640 --> 06:02.440
 But I do think that they would come and find us, because they'd want to find out

06:02.440 --> 06:06.560
 about our culture, what things are universal, what about, I mean, I'm a

06:06.560 --> 06:08.760
 chemist, so I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?

06:08.760 --> 06:12.880
 Are the creatures that we're going to find making all this commotion, are

06:12.880 --> 06:14.240
 they made of the same stuff?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.200
 What does their science look like?

06:19.360 --> 06:21.160
 Are they off planet yet?

06:21.760 --> 06:25.840
 I guess there's, so I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson is being slightly

06:25.840 --> 06:32.280
 pessimistic and maybe trying to play the tune that the universe is vast.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.240
 And it's not worth them coming here.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.880
 I don't think that, but I just worry that maybe we, we don't have the

06:38.880 --> 06:39.920
 ability to talk to them.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.440
 We don't have the universal translator.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.080
 We don't have the right physics, but sure, they should come.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.080
 We are interesting.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.200
 I want to know if they exist.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.040
 It would make it easy if they just came.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.640
 So again, I'm going to use your tweets like it's Shakespeare and

06:54.640 --> 06:55.800
 analyze it.

06:55.800 --> 07:00.400
 So Sarah tweeted, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

07:00.960 --> 07:06.080
 So how much do you think aliens are thinking about other aliens, including

07:06.080 --> 07:06.640
 humans?

07:07.040 --> 07:14.360
 So you said we humans want to visit, like we're longing to connect with aliens.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.120
 Why is that?

07:15.120 --> 07:16.080
 Can you introspect that?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.720
 Is that an obvious thing that we should be, like, what are we hoping to

07:18.720 --> 07:21.160
 understand by meeting aliens?

07:21.720 --> 07:22.360
 Exactly.

07:22.360 --> 07:27.160
 Exactly. Asking as an introvert is like, I ask myself this all the time, why, why

07:27.160 --> 07:29.680
 go out on a Friday night to meet people?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.240
 What are you hoping to find?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.040
 I think the curiosity.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.200
 So when I saw Sarah put that tweet, I think I answered it actually as well,

07:35.200 --> 07:38.720
 which was we are thinking about trying to make contact.

07:38.800 --> 07:43.400
 So they almost certainly are, but maybe there's a number of classes.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.320
 There are those aliens that have not yet made contact with other aliens like us.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.680
 Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.640
 And maybe it's an anticlimax and slime, right?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.280
 And aliens that have made contact with not just one set of intelligent

07:58.280 --> 08:00.720
 species, but several, that must be amazing.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.320
 Actually, literally, there is some place in the universe.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.000
 There must be one alien civilization.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.520
 It's not made contact with not one, but two other intelligent civilizations.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.120
 So they must be thinking about it.

08:12.120 --> 08:17.520
 There must be entire degree courses on aliens, thinking about aliens

08:17.520 --> 08:20.680
 and cultural, universal cultural norms.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.600
 Do you think they will survive the meeting?

08:23.640 --> 08:27.520
 And by the way, Lee did respond saying that's all the universe wants.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.720
 So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.360
 Lee said, that's all the universe wants.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.160
 And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.960
 So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting, all of which

08:41.960 --> 08:44.560
 we'll try to define mathematically.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.000
 Cheeky might be harder than interesting.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.640
 Because there's humor in that too.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.160
 Yes.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.600
 I think there's a mathematical definition of humor, but we'll talk about that in a bit.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
 Oh, interesting.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
 Yeah, absolutely right, yeah.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.840
 So if you're a graduate student alien looking at multiple alien civilizations,

08:59.280 --> 09:01.160
 do you think they survive the encounters?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.560
 I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.760
 A lot of the discussions about alien life, which is a really big challenge.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.600
 So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems, I don't try to think

09:12.600 --> 09:17.280
 about us as humans, but us as an example of phenomena.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.400
 That exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.

09:20.160 --> 09:26.400
 And it doesn't seem to be the case that if I think about the features,

09:26.720 --> 09:30.560
 I would argue are most universal about that phenomena, that there's any reason

09:30.560 --> 09:36.520
 to think that a first encounter with another lineage or example of life

09:36.520 --> 09:37.720
 would be antagonistic.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.360
 I think, yeah.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.520
 And I think there's this kind of assumption.

09:44.520 --> 09:49.120
 I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote, I mean, it kind of bothers me

09:49.120 --> 09:52.320
 because there's a, I mean, I'm a physicist, so I know we have a lot of egos

09:52.320 --> 09:56.320
 about how much we can describe the world, but that there's this, like,

09:56.320 --> 10:00.240
 because we understand fundamental physics so well, we understand alien life

10:00.240 --> 10:02.720
 and we can kind of extrapolate and I just think that we don't.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.600
 And the quest there is really, you know, really to understand something totally

10:07.600 --> 10:10.320
 new about the universe and that thing just happens to be us.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.320
 I agree, I agree.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.600
 There's something else more profound.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.000
 I think Neil is just being, again, he's just trying to stir the pot.

10:16.560 --> 10:21.480
 I would say from a contingency point of view, I want to know how many ways

10:21.480 --> 10:24.480
 does the universe build structures, build memories, right?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.960
 And then I want to know if those memories can interact with each other.

10:28.960 --> 10:33.560
 And if you have two different origins of life and then origins of intelligence

10:33.560 --> 10:36.800
 and then these things become conscious, surely you want to go and talk to them

10:36.800 --> 10:40.240
 and figure out what commonalities you share.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.880
 And it might be that we're just unable to conceive of what they're going to look like.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.920
 They're just going to be completely different, you know, infrastructure.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.360
 But surely we'll want to go and find out a map.

10:50.360 --> 10:55.040
 And surely curiosity is a property that evolution has made on Earth

10:55.040 --> 10:58.360
 and I can't see any reason that won't happen elsewhere

10:58.360 --> 11:03.680
 because curiosity probably exists because we want to find innovations in the environment.

11:03.680 --> 11:09.760
 We want to use that information to help our technology and also curiosity

11:09.760 --> 11:10.760
 is like planning for the future.

11:10.760 --> 11:11.680
 Are they going to fight us?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.680
 Are we going to be able to trade with them?

11:15.120 --> 11:19.320
 So I think that Neil's just, I don't know, maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.960
 That's really, I think that's really down on Earth, right?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.680
 How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?

11:26.040 --> 11:26.760
 How would we?

11:26.760 --> 11:28.120
 So let's put the other way around.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.080
 Slime category?

11:29.080 --> 11:30.120
 Maybe, no, no, no.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.960
 We, maybe we could, the thing is a bit odd, right?

11:33.240 --> 11:36.840
 Look at Instagram, Twitter, all these people taking selfies.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.160
 And I mean, does the universe is the ultimate state of consciousness,

11:40.760 --> 11:43.760
 thinking beings that take photographs themselves and upload them to an

11:43.760 --> 11:46.960
 interweb with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos.

11:46.960 --> 11:53.440
 So I think that they will be, I did not say there was anything wrong with it.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.280
 It's consciousness manifested at scale.

11:56.520 --> 11:56.720
 Yeah.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.400
 Southeast Instagram.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.880
 It's like the mirror test at scale.

12:00.040 --> 12:00.280
 Yeah.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.400
 I do think that curiosity is really the driving force of why we have our technology.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.960
 Right? If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out left the cave.

12:08.520 --> 12:14.280
 So I think that, so I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.280
 Actually, of course, they'd want to come here.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.880
 It doesn't mean they are coming here.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.120
 We've seen evidence for that.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.520
 I guess we can argue about that, right?

12:21.920 --> 12:26.640
 But I think that we want, I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too, but I won't

12:26.640 --> 12:27.560
 speak for you when you're here.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.800
 You can, I desperately want to have missions to look for life in the solar system.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.480
 Right now, I want to map life over the solar system.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.680
 And then I want to understand how we can go and find life as quickly as possible

12:38.040 --> 12:42.280
 at the nearest stars and also at the same time do it in the lab just to compensate.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.760
 You know, so sure.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.040
 Yeah, I just want to point on this.

12:47.040 --> 12:52.000
 If you think about sort of what's driven the most like features of our own evolution

12:52.000 --> 12:54.720
 as a species, you could, and try to map that to alien species.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.200
 I always think like optimism is what's going to get us furthest.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.880
 And so I think a lot of people always think that it's like war and conflict is going to

13:01.880 --> 13:05.760
 be the way that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.640
 But if you just look at how we're doing it and how we talk about it, it's always our

13:09.640 --> 13:13.680
 future in space is always, you know, built from narratives of optimism.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.080
 And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out in the universe, that it's going

13:19.080 --> 13:22.800
 to be more optimism and curiosity driving it than war and conflict, because those things

13:23.000 --> 13:23.920
 end up crushing you.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.880
 So there might be some selective filter.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.200
 Of course, this is me being an optimist.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.760
 I'm a half, half full kind of person, but is it obvious that curiosity?

13:34.720 --> 13:38.320
 Not obvious, but what do you think is curiosity a more powerful force in the

13:38.320 --> 13:42.600
 universe than violence and the will to power?

13:43.200 --> 13:50.040
 So because you said you frame curiosity as a way to also plan on how to avoid violence,

13:50.080 --> 13:52.000
 which is an interesting frame of curiosity.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.960
 But I could also argue that violence is a pretty productive way to operate in the

13:58.960 --> 14:02.080
 world, which is like, that's one way to protect yourself.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.520
 The best defense is offense.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.400
 Um, I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.

14:07.400 --> 14:11.720
 I think that's not what, that's the summary of this podcast.

14:12.920 --> 14:17.120
 I would, yeah, but maybe I would, let's not call it violence, but I call it erasure.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.920
 So if you think about, um, the way evolution works all the way, um, obviously

14:21.920 --> 14:25.800
 call it assembly theory, but I won't, so if you say, you, you, you build pro, you

14:25.800 --> 14:28.440
 curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?

14:28.440 --> 14:34.440
 So new features you can play, what, what, the ability to erase those things allows

14:34.440 --> 14:36.640
 you to start again and do some pruning.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.640
 So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest curiosity gets you rockets

14:40.640 --> 14:45.760
 that land, it gets you robots that can make drugs, it gets you poetry and art.

14:45.760 --> 14:50.800
 And communication and then, you know, I often think, wouldn't it be great in

14:50.800 --> 14:54.440
 bureaucracy to have another world war, not literally a world war now, please.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.600
 No world war, but a, the equivalent so we can get, remove all the admin bureaucracy,

14:58.800 --> 14:59.120
 right?

14:59.120 --> 15:01.520
 All the admin violence, get rid of it and start again.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.200
 Do you know what I mean?

15:02.560 --> 15:05.400
 Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.

15:05.640 --> 15:10.520
 So actually a reset, let's not call it violence, a reset in some aspects of our,

15:10.520 --> 15:16.520
 culture and our, our technology allows us to then build more important things

15:16.520 --> 15:19.520
 without the, because how many, you know, how many cookies do I have to click on?

15:19.520 --> 15:23.960
 How many things, how many, how many extra clicks I do I have in the future of my

15:23.960 --> 15:29.240
 life that I could remove and that a bit of a reset would, would allow us to, to,

15:29.520 --> 15:30.360
 to start again.

15:30.360 --> 15:34.320
 And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter with aliens will be.

15:34.520 --> 15:38.240
 Maybe they will fight with us and say, oh, we're not as excited by the

15:38.240 --> 15:40.680
 rules, we thought we'll just get rid of you.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.680
 Or they might want to reset earth.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.480
 Yeah, why not?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.760
 To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.200
 This seems like they've, there's nothing new happening here.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.400
 They're observing for a while.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.000
 This is just not, let's keep it more fun.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.480
 Let's start with a fish again.

15:57.480 --> 16:02.200
 I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.680
 I suppose that's the kind of violence in this, this modern world where words are

16:06.680 --> 16:08.480
 violence, resetting cookies.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.800
 I don't know where that came from.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.760
 I'm completely, yeah.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.400
 That's poetic, really.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.240
 Okay.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.960
 So let's talk about life.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.400
 What is life?

16:17.800 --> 16:19.080
 What is non life?

16:19.320 --> 16:21.800
 What is the line between life and non life?

16:22.120 --> 16:25.600
 And maybe at any point we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.600
 Like how do we start to try to define life?

16:28.600 --> 16:34.520
 And for people listening, so Sarah identifies as a physicist and Lee

16:34.520 --> 16:36.840
 identifies as a chemist.

16:36.840 --> 16:44.720
 Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature in general, but so what is life?

16:45.640 --> 16:50.760
 So I'm a little asking that question because it's so absurdly big.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.800
 I know, I love it.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.800
 It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.280
 So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.

16:59.160 --> 17:02.600
 And I like to say all three of them because people latch on to different facets of them.

17:02.600 --> 17:07.000
 And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on is not to try to define life,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.840
 but to try to find a more fundamental theory that explains what the phenomena we call life.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.840
 And then it should explain certain attributes.

17:12.840 --> 17:16.040
 And you end up having a really different framing than the way people usually talk.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.200
 So the way I talk about it, three different ways.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.680
 Life is how information structures matter across space and time.

17:23.800 --> 17:29.880
 Life is, I don't know, this one's from you actually, simple machines constructing more

17:29.880 --> 17:30.920
 complex machines.

17:30.920 --> 17:36.840
 And the other one is the physics of existence, so to speak, which is life is the mechanism

17:36.840 --> 17:39.640
 the universe has to explore the space of what's possible.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.640
 That's my favorite.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.760
 So can I, yeah, yeah, can I add on to that?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.600
 Okay, can you see the physics one again?

17:46.600 --> 17:48.840
 Oh, the physics of existence.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.400
 Yeah, the physics of existence, I don't know what to call it.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.240
 You know, like if you think of all the things that could exist, only certain things do exist.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.240
 And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.600
 Of bringing things into physically existing in the moment now.

18:03.880 --> 18:04.360
 Yeah.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.520
 Yeah, well, what's what's another one?

18:06.520 --> 18:07.960
 We were debating this the other day.

18:07.960 --> 18:13.640
 So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it, that's kind of hard to conceive

18:13.640 --> 18:14.360
 of, right?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
 Because this is where physicists really go wrong.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.960
 They think of a universe with nothing in it.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.680
 They can't.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.080
 And you think that existence is really hard to think of.

18:21.080 --> 18:21.640
 Yeah.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.880
 And then you think of universe with everything in it.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.960
 That's really hard.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.120
 And you just, you just have the universe.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.200
 And you just, you just have this white blob, right?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.320
 This is everything.

18:31.320 --> 18:35.160
 But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe beyond, say, planets.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.440
 So you've got stars, space, planet stuff, right?

18:38.440 --> 18:39.240
 The boring stuff.

18:40.280 --> 18:47.080
 Well, I would define life or say that life is where there are architectures, any architectures,

18:47.080 --> 18:52.120
 and we should stop fixating on what the bill is building the architectures to start with.

18:52.120 --> 18:57.080
 And the fact that the universe has discrete things in it is completely mind blowing.

18:57.080 --> 19:02.760
 If you think about it for one second, the fact there's any objects at all,

19:03.480 --> 19:10.360
 and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy for a machine that built it.

19:10.360 --> 19:17.800
 Some information being moved around, actuation, sensing, getting resource,

19:18.600 --> 19:20.040
 and building these objects.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.440
 So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.400
 But I'm like, forget the machine.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.240
 Let's see the objects.

19:27.240 --> 19:32.440
 And I think in a way that assembly theory, we realized maybe a few months ago that assembly

19:32.440 --> 19:37.720
 theory actually does account for the soul in the objects, not mystically like, say,

19:37.720 --> 19:42.760
 Sheldrecht's morphic resonance or Leibniz's monodology, seeing souls in things.

19:42.760 --> 19:48.120
 But when you see an object, and I've said this before, but this object is evidence of thought,

19:49.080 --> 19:51.080
 and then there's a lineage of those objects.

19:51.080 --> 19:57.240
 So I think what is fascinating is that you put it much more elegantly, but the barrier

19:57.240 --> 20:00.840
 between life and nonlife is accruing enough memories to then actuate.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.680
 So what that means is there are contingency.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.600
 There are things that happen in the universe get trapped.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.400
 These memories then have a causal effect on the future.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.320
 And then when you get those concentrated in a machine, and you're actually able,

20:13.320 --> 20:19.720
 in real time, able to integrate the past, the present with the future, and do stuff.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.240
 That's when you are most alive.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.720
 You being the machine?

20:23.720 --> 20:24.360
 Yes.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.160
 Wait a minute.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.960
 Why is the object, so one of the ways to define life, as Sarah said,

20:30.680 --> 20:33.240
 is simple machines creating complex machines.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.240
 So there's a million questions there.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.520
 So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?

20:41.080 --> 20:41.800
 By mutation.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.120
 So this is what we were talking about at the beginning.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.040
 You have a minimum replicator, so a molecule.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.760
 So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah of the mechanism get there.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.240
 Years ago, I think, but then you've been building on it and saying,

20:52.440 --> 20:58.200
 you have a molecule that can copy itself, but then there has to be some variability.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.200
 Otherwise, it's not going to get more functional.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.040
 So you need to add bits on.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.520
 So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,

21:04.520 --> 21:07.080
 but then it can add bits on, and that can be copied as well.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.640
 And those add ons can give you additional function

21:12.360 --> 21:15.000
 to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.440
 So existence is weird, but the fact that there is existence is why there is life.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.720
 And that's why I realized a few days ago that there must be,

21:23.720 --> 21:27.800
 that's why alien life must be everywhere, because there is existence.

21:27.800 --> 21:32.920
 Is there like a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?

21:32.920 --> 21:36.280
 So like, how can you keep injecting more complex things?

21:37.000 --> 21:43.480
 Like, doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be as or more complex,

21:43.480 --> 21:47.320
 more powerful than the things it creates?

21:48.280 --> 21:50.760
 So how can you get complexity from simplicity?

21:51.720 --> 21:55.400
 So the way you get complexity from simplicity is that you,

21:56.040 --> 21:59.400
 I would, this, I'm just making this up, but this is kind of my notion that you have a large volume

21:59.400 --> 22:05.560
 of stuff, so you're able to get seeds if you like random cues from the environment.

22:05.560 --> 22:10.920
 So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever.

22:10.920 --> 22:15.960
 And that is, that is necessarily rich, complex.

22:16.680 --> 22:21.240
 Okay. But it has a low assembliness, but even though it has a high assembly number,

22:21.240 --> 22:22.360
 we can talk about that.

22:22.360 --> 22:27.080
 But then when you start to then integrate that all into a smaller volume as over time,

22:28.600 --> 22:32.280
 and you become more autonomous, you then make the transition.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.680
 I don't know what you think about that.

22:34.680 --> 22:39.960
 I think the easiest way to think about it is actually, which I know is a concept you hate,

22:39.960 --> 22:41.480
 but I also hate it, which is entropy.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.680
 But people are more familiar with entropy than what we talk about in assembly theory.

22:45.640 --> 22:51.880
 And also the idea that, like, say physics as we know it involves objects that don't exist

22:51.880 --> 22:54.520
 across time, or as we would say, low memory objects.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.560
 So one of the key distinctions that that is low memory objects.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.080
 Yeah. So physics is all.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.320
 Physicists are low memory objects.

23:03.320 --> 23:09.800
 But physicists are creators of low memory objects or manipulators of low memory objects.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.600
 Yeah. Absolutely.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.560
 It's a very nice way.

23:13.080 --> 23:13.800
 Okay. Sorry, go ahead.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.440
 Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.560
 Sorry to keep interrupting.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.960
 No, no, no, it's fine. I like it too. It's very funny.

23:18.680 --> 23:22.120
 But I think it's a good way of phrasing it, because I think this kind of idea we have

23:22.120 --> 23:28.200
 in assembly theory is that physics as we know it has basically removed time as being

23:28.200 --> 23:31.320
 a physical observable of an object.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.240
 And the argument I would make is that when you look at things like water bottles or us,

23:35.240 --> 23:40.280
 we're actually things that exist that have a large extent in time.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.360
 So we actually have a physical size in time.

23:44.360 --> 23:49.400
 And we measure that with something called the assembly index in molecules.

23:49.400 --> 23:54.840
 But presumably everyone should have sort of a, do you want to explain what assembly?

23:54.840 --> 23:56.280
 Yeah, let's, you know what?

23:56.280 --> 23:59.400
 Let's step back and start at the beginning.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.920
 What is assembly theory?

24:00.920 --> 24:05.320
 Please send me some slides. There's a big sexy paper coming out probably.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.320
 Maybe, I don't know.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.280
 We've almost finished it.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.480
 Almost, almost finished it.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.480
 That's also a summary of science.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.600
 We're almost done.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.000
 Yes.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.280
 Well, no, no, we're almost done.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.480
 It's the history of science.

24:17.480 --> 24:21.080
 We are ready to start an interesting discussion with our peers.

24:21.640 --> 24:22.280
 Right.

24:22.280 --> 24:26.040
 You're the machine that created the object and we'll see what the object takes us.

24:26.040 --> 24:26.360
 All right.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.520
 So what is assembly theory?

24:28.520 --> 24:32.360
 Yeah, well, I think the easiest way for people to understand it is to think about

24:33.640 --> 24:36.440
 assembly in molecules, although the theory is very general.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.040
 It doesn't just apply to molecules.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.320
 And this was really Lee's insight.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.240
 So it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.120
 But...

24:42.120 --> 24:43.240
 On marquee.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.200
 Okay. All right.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.080
 You ready? I'm ready.

24:45.080 --> 24:45.480
 I'm ready.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.320
 You can tell me where I get the check mark minus.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.440
 It's your theory as well.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.320
 Yeah, I know.

24:49.320 --> 24:55.640
 But imagine a molecule and then you can break the molecule part into elementary building blocks.

24:55.640 --> 24:56.920
 They happen to be bombs.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.640
 And then you can think of all the ways for molecular assembly theory.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.200
 You can think of all the ways of building up the original molecule.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.840
 So there's all these paths that you can assemble it.

25:04.840 --> 25:08.680
 And the sort of rules or assembly is you can use pieces that have been generated already.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.320
 So it has this kind of recursive property to it.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.000
 And so that's where our kind of memory comes into assembly theory.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.240
 And then the assembly index is the shortest path in that space.

25:19.240 --> 25:23.160
 So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history that the universe has to undergo

25:23.160 --> 25:25.400
 in order to assemble that particular object.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.160
 And the reason that this is significant is we figured out how to measure that

25:30.440 --> 25:33.160
 with a mass spec in the lab.

25:33.160 --> 25:37.800
 And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps was sufficiently large,

25:38.360 --> 25:41.560
 it would indicate that you required a machine or a system that had information

25:41.560 --> 25:43.240
 about how to assemble that specific object.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.160
 Because the combinatorial space of possibilities is getting exponentially large

25:47.160 --> 25:48.920
 as the assembly index is increasing.

25:48.920 --> 25:55.720
 So it's just, sorry to interrupt, but so that means there's a sufficiently high assembly index

25:55.720 --> 26:04.280
 that if observed in an object is an indicator that something life like created it

26:04.280 --> 26:06.200
 or is the object itself life like?

26:07.320 --> 26:07.720
 Both.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.880
 But you might want to make the distinction that a water bottle is not life.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.880
 But it would still be a signature that you were in that domain of physics.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.560
 And I might be alive.

26:17.560 --> 26:25.240
 So there will be potentially a lot of arguments about where the line at which assembly index

26:26.760 --> 26:28.680
 does interesting stuff start to happen.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.120
 The point is we can make all the arguments, but it should be experimentally observable.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.040
 And we can talk more about that part of it.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.800
 But the point I want to make about it is there was always this intuition

26:38.360 --> 26:41.720
 that I had that there should be some complexity threshold in the universe,

26:41.720 --> 26:46.840
 above which you would start to say whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.240
 And I think about it a little bit like we have Planck's constant,

26:50.280 --> 26:52.280
 and we have the fine structure constant.

26:52.280 --> 26:59.160
 And then this sort of assembly threshold is basically another sort of potentially constant

26:59.160 --> 26:59.720
 of nature.

26:59.720 --> 27:04.440
 It might depend on specific features of the system, which we debate about sometimes.

27:04.440 --> 27:10.440
 But then when you're past that, you have to have some other explanation than the current

27:10.440 --> 27:12.680
 explanations we have in physics, because now you're in high memory.

27:12.680 --> 27:19.800
 The things actually require time for them to exist, and time becomes a physical variable.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.560
 So the path to the creation of the object is the memory.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.920
 So you need to consider that.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.760
 Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.

27:29.400 --> 27:37.320
 So when I think of all the things in this room, we see the projection of them as a water bottle,

27:37.320 --> 27:40.680
 but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph of all the ways the universe

27:40.680 --> 27:41.640
 can create this thing.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.320
 That's what it is as an object.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.480
 And we're all interacting a causal graph.

27:45.480 --> 27:49.880
 And most of the creativity in the biosphere is because a lot of the objects that exist now

27:49.880 --> 27:54.760
 are huge in their structure across time, four billion years of evolution to get to us.

27:54.760 --> 28:00.360
 So is it possible to look at me and infer the history that led to me?

28:01.400 --> 28:04.840
 If you as an individual might be hard.

28:04.840 --> 28:10.520
 You as a representative of a population of objects that have high assembly with similar

28:10.520 --> 28:14.520
 causal history and structure that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,

28:14.520 --> 28:15.720
 you can infer a lot probably.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.840
 Yeah, also with them.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.200
 Which we do genomically even.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.920
 I mean, it's not like we have a lot of information in us.

28:20.920 --> 28:24.440
 We can reconstruct histories from assembly saying something slightly deeper.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.400
 Yeah, one thing to add.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.960
 I mean, it's not just about the object, but the objects that occur.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.960
 And not just objects with a high assembly number, because you can have random things

28:31.960 --> 28:32.920
 that have a high assembly number.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.280
 They must have, there must be a number of identical copies.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.960
 So you know you're getting away from the random, because you could take a snapshot.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.960
 This is why it's not I hate entropy.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.200
 I love entropy when used correctly.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.120
 But it's about the problem of entropy.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.640
 You have to have a labeler.

28:47.640 --> 28:52.120
 And so, so you can label the beginning and the end to start on the finish, you know,

28:52.120 --> 28:56.280
 where what you can do in assembly is say, oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.040
 They all have these features.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.160
 And then you can infer.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.760
 And one of the things that we debated a lot, particularly during lockdown,

29:02.760 --> 29:06.600
 because I almost went insane trying to crush the produce the assembly equation.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.280
 So we came up with the assembly equation.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.880
 I had, just imagine this.

29:09.880 --> 29:15.880
 So you have a string where, oh, actually it makes me trying to remember it.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.440
 It was so, it did my head in for a long time.

29:18.440 --> 29:21.960
 Yeah, because I couldn't size.

29:21.960 --> 29:26.920
 If you just have a string of say words, say, you know, a series of words, series of letters.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.800
 So you just have a, a, a, b, b, b, c, c, c, d, d, d.

29:29.800 --> 29:34.520
 And you find that object and you just have four a's, four b's, four c's, four d's together.

29:34.520 --> 29:39.960
 Boom, then, and that really, that you measured that, so you physically measured that string of letters.

29:40.600 --> 29:46.520
 Then what you could do is you can infer sub graphs of maybe the four a's, the four b's,

29:46.520 --> 29:49.880
 the four c's, and the four c's, but you don't see them in the real world.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.240
 You just infer them.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.560
 And I really got stuck with that because there's a problem to try and work out

29:55.560 --> 30:00.920
 what's the difference between a long, you know, physical object and the assembly space of the

30:00.920 --> 30:05.160
 objects that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.

30:05.160 --> 30:09.800
 That, so, although we can't infer your entire history, we know at some point the four a's were

30:09.800 --> 30:13.720
 made, the four b's were made, the four c's were made, and the four d's were made,

30:13.720 --> 30:15.400
 and they all got added together.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.920
 And, and that's one really interesting thing that's come out of the theory.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.560
 But the, the killer, when we knew we were going beyond,

30:23.160 --> 30:27.720
 and beyond standard complexity theory, it was incredibly successful

30:27.720 --> 30:32.840
 is that we realized we could start to measure these things for real across domains.

30:33.400 --> 30:38.920
 So the assembly index is actually intrinsic property of all stuff that you can break into

30:39.640 --> 30:45.160
 components, particularly molecules are good because you can break them up into smaller

30:45.160 --> 30:46.360
 molecules into atoms.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.600
 The challenge will be making that more general across all the domains.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.920
 But we're working on it right now, and I think the theory will do that.

30:52.920 --> 30:59.480
 So components, domains, so you're talking about basically measuring the complexity of an object

31:00.120 --> 31:03.080
 in what, biology, chemistry, physics.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.360
 That's what you mean by domains.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.600
 Complexity of tests.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.240
 Sociology.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.040
 Computers.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.080
 Complexity of memes.

31:09.640 --> 31:10.120
 You know.

31:10.120 --> 31:10.680
 Memes.

31:10.680 --> 31:10.920
 Yep.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.360
 What, what is that?

31:12.360 --> 31:13.160
 Ideas.

31:13.160 --> 31:13.480
 Yeah.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.080
 I mean, so one of them.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.920
 Ideas are objects in assembly theory, though.

31:16.920 --> 31:17.720
 Yeah.

31:17.720 --> 31:17.960
 They are.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.840
 They're physical things.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.280
 They're just pictures of the causal graph.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.640
 I mean, the fact that I can talk to you right now is because we're exchanging structure

31:23.640 --> 31:24.520
 of our assembly space.

31:27.160 --> 31:33.160
 So conversation is the exchanging structures in assembly space.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.280
 What is assembly space?

31:35.000 --> 31:39.080
 When I started working on Origins of Life, I was writing about something called top down

31:39.080 --> 31:43.000
 causation, which a lot of like philosophers are interested in and people that worry about the

31:43.000 --> 31:43.960
 mind body problem.

31:43.960 --> 31:49.800
 But the whole idea is, you know, if we have, you know, the microscopic world of physics

31:49.800 --> 31:54.680
 is causally complete, it seems like there's no room for higher level causes like our thoughts

31:54.680 --> 31:56.440
 to actually have any impact on the world.

31:56.440 --> 32:01.720
 And that didn't, that seems problematic when you get to studying life in mind because it

32:01.720 --> 32:05.320
 does seem that quote unquote emergent properties do matter to matter.

32:06.680 --> 32:11.960
 And so, and then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation where information looks

32:11.960 --> 32:13.000
 like it's disembodied.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.600
 So we talk about information like it can just move from any physical system to any other

32:16.600 --> 32:22.200
 physical system, and it doesn't require like you don't have to specify anything about the

32:22.200 --> 32:24.200
 substrate to talk about information.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.920
 And then there's also the way we talk about mathematics is also disembodied, right, like

32:28.920 --> 32:31.160
 the platonic world of forms.

32:31.160 --> 32:36.440
 And I think all of those things are hinging that we really don't know how to think about

32:36.440 --> 32:38.120
 abstractions as physical things.

32:39.720 --> 32:45.160
 And really, I think what assembly theory is pointing to is what we're missing there is the

32:45.160 --> 32:46.920
 dimension of time.

32:46.920 --> 32:52.760
 And if you actually look at an object being extended across time, what we call information

32:52.760 --> 32:56.600
 and the things that look abstract are things that are entangled in the histories of those

32:56.600 --> 32:59.960
 objects, their features of the overlapping assembly space.

32:59.960 --> 33:05.480
 So they look abstract because they're not, you know, part of the current structure, but

33:05.480 --> 33:09.080
 they're part of the structure if you thought about it as like the philosophical concept

33:09.080 --> 33:13.080
 of a hyper object, an object that's too big in time for us to actually to resolve.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
 And so I think information is physical.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.080
 It's just physical in time, not in space.

33:18.360 --> 33:21.560
 To a hyper object, too difficult for us to resolve.

33:21.560 --> 33:27.480
 So what we're supposed to think about of life is this thing that stretches through time

33:27.480 --> 33:30.280
 and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.880
 And then you're trying to measure something with the assembly index about.

33:35.880 --> 33:40.680
 The assembly index is the ordering the order, like you could think of it as like a partial

33:40.680 --> 33:43.160
 ordering of all the things that can happen.

33:43.160 --> 33:47.320
 So in thermodynamics, we coarse grain things by temperature and pressure.

33:47.320 --> 33:52.120
 In assembly theory, we coarse grain by the number of copies of an object and the assembly

33:52.120 --> 33:55.720
 index, which is basically, if you think of the space of all possible things, it's like

33:55.720 --> 33:59.480
 a depth of how far you've gone into that space and how much time was required to get there.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.480
 In the shortest possible version.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.480
 The shortest possible version.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.480
 Not average.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.480
 Can't you just read it?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.480
 You're going to kill me with that question.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.480
 Well, not 3D.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.480
 Can't you always 3D print the thing?

34:13.480 --> 34:15.480
 It's like it's happening in the heart.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.480
 No, because I had such fights.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.480
 So Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper at the moment.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.480
 It's so funny.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.480
 I think we kind of share the, at the beginning, you were like,

34:23.480 --> 34:25.480
 no, that's not right. Oh, that's right.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.480
 And we're doing this for a bit.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
 And then the problem is when you build a theory and build the intuition,

34:29.480 --> 34:33.480
 there's some certain features of the theory

34:33.480 --> 34:35.480
 that almost felt like I was being religious about.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.480
 Say, right, you have to do this.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.480
 And the assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.

34:39.480 --> 34:43.480
 And Sarah's postdoc Daniel and my postdoc Abishek,

34:43.480 --> 34:45.480
 and they were both brilliant.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.480
 They're brilliant.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.480
 But they were like, no, we don't, we don't buy that.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.480
 And I was like, it is.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.480
 They were like, well, Lee, actually,

34:53.480 --> 34:55.480
 I thought you're the first to say that, you know,

34:55.480 --> 34:57.480
 you can't, if you can't explain it,

34:57.480 --> 34:59.480
 and you can't do an experiment that doesn't exist.

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
 And that saved me.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.480
 And I said to Abishek, Abishek's my postdoc in Glasgow,

35:03.480 --> 35:05.480
 Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.480
 I was like, I have the experimental data.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.480
 So when I basically take the molecules

35:10.480 --> 35:12.480
 and chop them up in the mass spec,

35:12.480 --> 35:14.480
 the assembly number is never the average.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.480
 It's always the shortest.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.480
 It's an intrinsic property.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.480
 And then the penny drop for Abishek said, OK,

35:18.480 --> 35:22.480
 because I had these things that we had to believe to start with

35:22.480 --> 35:23.480
 or to trust.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.480
 And then we've done the math and it comes out.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.480
 And they now have the shortest path.

35:26.480 --> 35:27.480
 Actually, it's up.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.480
 It explains why the shortest path.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.480
 Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.480
 The shortest path needs you to identify when the universe

35:35.480 --> 35:37.480
 has basically got a memory, not an average.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.480
 So what you want to be able to do is to say,

35:39.480 --> 35:43.480
 what is the minimum number of features

35:43.480 --> 35:45.480
 that I want to be able to see in the universe?

35:45.480 --> 35:47.480
 When I find those features, I know the universe

35:47.480 --> 35:52.480
 has had a coherent memory and is basically alive.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.480
 And so that gives you the lower bound.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.480
 So that's like, of course, there's going to be other paths.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.480
 We can be more ridiculous, right?

36:00.480 --> 36:03.480
 We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.480
 So probabilistically, at the beginning,

36:05.480 --> 36:09.480
 because assembly theory was built as a measure for biosignatures,

36:09.480 --> 36:11.480
 I needed to go there.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.480
 And then I realized it was intrinsic.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.480
 And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic

36:15.480 --> 36:16.480
 and these hyperobjects were coming.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.480
 And we were kind of fusing that notions together.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.480
 And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy

36:23.480 --> 36:26.480
 and I have enough resources, I might not take the shortest path.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.480
 I might go a bit longer.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.480
 I might take a really long path

36:29.480 --> 36:32.480
 because it allows me then to do something else.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.480
 So what you do is, let's say I've got two different objects, A and B,

36:36.480 --> 36:39.480
 and they both have different shortest paths to get them.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.480
 But then if you want to make A and B together,

36:43.480 --> 36:44.480
 they will have a compromise.

36:44.480 --> 36:48.480
 So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,

36:48.480 --> 36:51.480
 but actually it's the shortest way you can make both A and B

36:51.480 --> 36:54.480
 with a minimum amount of resource in time.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.480
 So suddenly you then layer these things up.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.480
 And so the average becomes not important,

36:59.480 --> 37:04.480
 but as you literally overlap those sets, you get a new shortest path.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.480
 And so what we realized time and time again when we're doing the math

37:07.480 --> 37:11.480
 that shortest path is intrinsic, is fundamental, and is measurable,

37:11.480 --> 37:13.480
 which is kind of mind blowing.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.480
 So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients,

37:16.480 --> 37:20.480
 maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients could be

37:20.480 --> 37:23.480
 and how many steps, when you say shortest path,

37:23.480 --> 37:31.480
 how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients into the final meal.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.480
 So what's the shortest way to make a pizza?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.480
 Or a pie, an apple pie.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.480
 An apple pie, that's right.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.480
 And the pizza and the pie together.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.480
 Or a scratch.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.480
 So there's a lot of ways.

37:44.480 --> 37:48.480
 There's the shortest way and you take the full spectrum of ways

37:48.480 --> 37:55.480
 and there's probably an average, like duration for a noob to make an apple pie.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.480
 Is the average interesting still?

37:57.480 --> 38:03.480
 If you measure the average length of the path to assemble a thing,

38:03.480 --> 38:08.480
 does that tell you something about the way nature usually does it?

38:08.480 --> 38:13.480
 Versus something fundamental about the object,

38:13.480 --> 38:16.480
 which I think is what you're aiming at with the assembly index.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.480
 Yeah, I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.480
 The minimum path gives you the lower bounds,

38:21.480 --> 38:24.480
 so you know you're detecting something, you know you're inferring something.

38:24.480 --> 38:28.480
 The average tells you about really how the objects are existing

38:28.480 --> 38:31.480
 in the ecosystem or the technology.

38:31.480 --> 38:35.480
 And there has to be more paths explored

38:35.480 --> 38:40.480
 because then you can happen upon other memories

38:40.480 --> 38:42.480
 and then condense them down.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.480
 I'm not making too much sense.

38:43.480 --> 38:47.480
 Let's just say, I mean, maybe we're going to get to alien civilizations later, right?

38:47.480 --> 38:53.480
 But I would argue very strongly that alien civilization A and alien civilization B,

38:53.480 --> 38:55.480
 they're different assembly spaces.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.480
 So they're kind of going to be a bit messed up if they happen to come on another.

38:58.480 --> 39:02.480
 Only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,

39:02.480 --> 39:06.480
 because if aliens come to us and they don't share any other causal graph,

39:06.480 --> 39:09.480
 we've shared it, but hopefully they share the periodic table

39:09.480 --> 39:11.480
 and some other and bonds and things.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.480
 So we're going to have to really think about the language to talk to us aliens

39:15.480 --> 39:21.480
 by inferring, by using assembly theory to infer their language,

39:21.480 --> 39:23.480
 their technology, and other bits and bobs.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.480
 And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.

39:25.480 --> 39:31.480
 All right, so all aliens in the causality graphs have a common ancestor in the...

39:31.480 --> 39:33.480
 If the building blocks are the same,

39:33.480 --> 39:35.480
 which means they live in the same universe as us.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.480
 It depends on how far back in time you go though.

39:38.480 --> 39:42.480
 But the universe has all the same building blocks.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.480
 And we have to assume that.

39:45.480 --> 39:53.480
 So there's not different classes of causality graphs, right?

39:53.480 --> 39:55.480
 The universe doesn't just say,

39:55.480 --> 39:59.480
 here, you get the red causality graph and you get the blue one.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.480
 These basic ingredients and they're geographically constrained

40:02.480 --> 40:05.480
 or constrained in space or time or something like that.

40:05.480 --> 40:09.480
 They're constrained in time because only by the virtue of the fact

40:09.480 --> 40:13.480
 that you need enough time to have passed for some things to exist.

40:13.480 --> 40:16.480
 So the universe has to be big enough in time for some things.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.480
 So just a one point on the shortest path versus the average path,

40:19.480 --> 40:22.480
 which I think we'll get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it's like

40:22.480 --> 40:26.480
 the minimal compression is the shortest path for the universe to produce that.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.480
 But it's also like the first time in the ordering of events

40:29.480 --> 40:31.480
 that you might expect to see that object.

40:31.480 --> 40:37.480
 But the average path tells you something about the actual steps

40:37.480 --> 40:40.480
 that were realized and that becomes an emergent property

40:40.480 --> 40:43.480
 of that object's interaction with other objects.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.480
 So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.480
 It's a feature of the interactions with other things.

40:47.480 --> 40:50.480
 And so one of the nice features of assembly is you basically gotten rid of,

40:50.480 --> 40:53.480
 you just look at the things that exist and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms

40:53.480 --> 41:00.480
 for constructing them in some sense, like the machines are not as important

41:00.480 --> 41:04.480
 in the current construction of the theory, although I would like to bridge it

41:04.480 --> 41:06.480
 to some ideas about constructors.

41:06.480 --> 41:12.480
 But then you could only communicate with things as Lee was saying

41:12.480 --> 41:14.480
 if you have some overlap in the past history.

41:14.480 --> 41:18.480
 So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap,

41:18.480 --> 41:20.480
 then there would be no means of communication.

41:20.480 --> 41:25.480
 But as we become, you know, as we progress further and further in time

41:25.480 --> 41:29.480
 and more things become possible because the assembly spaces are larger,

41:29.480 --> 41:32.480
 because you can have a larger assembly space in terms of index

41:32.480 --> 41:35.480
 and also just the size of the space because it's exponentially growing,

41:35.480 --> 41:37.480
 then more things can happen in the future.

41:37.480 --> 41:41.480
 And the example I like to give is actually when we made first contact

41:41.480 --> 41:45.480
 with gravitational waves, because, you know, that's an alien phenomena

41:45.480 --> 41:48.480
 that's been permeating our planet, not alien in life phenomena,

41:48.480 --> 41:51.480
 but alien like something we had never knew existed.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.480
 It's been, you know, like we're, you know, there's gravitational waves

41:54.480 --> 41:56.480
 rippling through this room right now.

41:56.480 --> 42:02.480
 But we had to advance to the level of Einstein writing down his theory of relativity

42:02.480 --> 42:06.480
 and then 100 years of technological development to even quote, unquote,

42:06.480 --> 42:08.480
 see that phenomena.

42:08.480 --> 42:15.480
 So the, okay, to see that phenomena, our cause of graph have to start intersecting.

42:15.480 --> 42:18.480
 Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first, the abstraction, right?

42:18.480 --> 42:22.480
 And then we had to build the technology that could actually observe features

42:22.480 --> 42:23.480
 of that abstraction.

42:23.480 --> 42:27.480
 So the nice promising thing is over time the graph can grow,

42:27.480 --> 42:29.480
 so we can start overlapping eventually.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.480
 Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph is there was an event, you know,

42:32.480 --> 42:37.480
 1.4 billion years away of a black hole merger that we detected on our detector.

42:37.480 --> 42:42.480
 And, you know, now suddenly we're connected through this communication channel

42:42.480 --> 42:45.480
 with this distant event in our universe that, you know,

42:45.480 --> 42:48.480
 if you think about 1.4 billion years ago what was happening on this planet

42:48.480 --> 42:54.480
 or even further back in time that, you know, there's common physics underlying all those events,

42:54.480 --> 42:56.480
 but even for those two events to communicate with them.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.480
 Now I understand what you were going on about the other week.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.480
 Yeah, I'm sorry.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.480
 This is a really abstract example, but it's sort of...

43:02.480 --> 43:04.480
 Your causal graphs are not overlapping.

43:04.480 --> 43:09.480
 Yeah, so, well, let's just say now our causal graphs are overlapping in the deep past.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.480
 No, I like it.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
 See, you made it.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.480
 I totally missed it.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.480
 Oh, the 1.6 billion.

43:13.480 --> 43:14.480
 Yeah.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.480
 You made a connection with it.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.480
 No, I do like that.

43:16.480 --> 43:17.480
 No, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.480
 This is good.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
 Because I was...

43:19.480 --> 43:22.480
 And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so...

43:22.480 --> 43:23.480
 Oh, I get it now.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.480
 All right?

43:24.480 --> 43:25.480
 No, it's all right.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.480
 The joke came two minutes ago.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.480
 I'm slow on the uptake here.

43:28.480 --> 43:32.480
 I wasn't able to comprehend what you were talking about when saying the channel communicating

43:32.480 --> 43:39.480
 to the past, but what you're saying is we were able to infer what happened 1.4 billion years ago.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.480
 We detected the gravity wave.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.480
 I mean, I think it's amazing that, you know, at that time we weren't even...

43:44.480 --> 43:46.480
 We were just becoming multicellular, right?

43:46.480 --> 43:48.580
 It's like insane.

43:48.580 --> 43:55.480
 And then we progressed a multicellularity through to technology and built the detector,

43:55.480 --> 43:59.000
 and then we just extrapolate backwards.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.720
 So although we didn't do anything back to the graph back in time, we understood there's

44:02.720 --> 44:04.480
 existence then overlapped going forward.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.480
 Well, that's because our graphs are larger.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.480
 Yeah.

44:07.480 --> 44:08.480
 But that means that has a consequence.

44:08.480 --> 44:15.480
 One of the things I was trying to say is I think, I don't know, Sarah might be, she

44:15.480 --> 44:19.480
 might correct me, information first, and I'm an object first kind of guy.

44:19.480 --> 44:25.480
 So I mean, as things that get constructed, there has to be this transition in random constructions.

44:25.480 --> 44:32.480
 So when the object that's being constructed by the process bakes in that memory and those

44:32.480 --> 44:35.480
 memories then add on and add on and add on.

44:35.480 --> 44:40.480
 So as it becomes more competent and life is about taking those memories and compressing

44:40.480 --> 44:43.480
 them, increasing their autonomy.

44:43.480 --> 44:47.580
 And so I think that, you know, like the cell that we have in biology on Earth is our way

44:47.580 --> 44:52.480
 of doing that, that really the maximum ability to take memories and to act on the future.

44:52.480 --> 44:54.480
 Oh, I think that's mathematics.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.480
 No, mathematics doesn't exist.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.480
 No, but that's the point.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.480
 The point is that abstractions do exist.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.480
 They're real physical things.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.480
 We call them abstractions.

45:05.480 --> 45:10.480
 But the point about mathematics that I think is, so I don't, I don't disagree.

45:10.480 --> 45:14.480
 I think you're object first and I'm information first, but I think I'm, I'm only information

45:14.480 --> 45:19.480
 first in the sense that I think the thing that we need to explain is why what abstractions

45:19.480 --> 45:23.480
 are and what they are as physical things because of all of human history.

45:23.480 --> 45:28.480
 We've thought that there were these properties that are disembodied exist outside of the

45:28.480 --> 45:34.480
 universe and really they do exist in the universe and we just don't understand what their physics is.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.480
 So I think mathematics is a really good example.

45:36.480 --> 45:42.480
 We do theoretical physics with math, but imagine doing physics of math and then think about

45:42.480 --> 45:45.480
 math as a physical object and math is super interesting.

45:45.480 --> 45:49.480
 I think this is why we think it describes reality so well because it's the most copyable

45:49.480 --> 45:50.480
 kind of information.

45:50.480 --> 45:54.480
 It retains its properties when you move it between physical media, which means that it's

45:54.480 --> 45:59.480
 very deep and so it seems to describe the universe really well, but it probably is because

45:59.480 --> 46:01.480
 it's information that's very deep in our past.

46:01.480 --> 46:08.480
 And it's just, we invented a way of communicating it very effectively between us.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.480
 Isn't math more fundamental?

46:10.480 --> 46:15.480
 Isn't the assembly of the graph, isn't basically, I'm going to say, I sound completely boring.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.480
 It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.480
 It has to be.

46:20.480 --> 46:21.480
 Okay.

46:23.480 --> 46:28.480
 So what is math exactly?

46:28.480 --> 46:37.480
 It's a nice simplification, a simple description of what?

46:37.480 --> 46:40.480
 So we have a computer scientist, a physicist and a chemist here.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.480
 Walking to a bar.

46:41.480 --> 46:45.480
 I think the chemist is going to define math and you guys can correct me.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.480
 Go for it.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.480
 Let's lay it honestly.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.480
 We're ready.

46:50.480 --> 46:58.480
 I think the ability to label objects and place them into classes and then do operations on

46:58.480 --> 47:00.480
 the objects is what math is.

47:00.480 --> 47:06.480
 So on that point, what does it mean to be object first versus information first?

47:06.480 --> 47:11.480
 So what's the difference between object and information when you get to that low fundamental level?

47:11.480 --> 47:13.480
 Well, I might change my view.

47:13.480 --> 47:20.480
 So I'm stuff first, the stuff, and then when stuff becomes objects, it has to invent information.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.480
 And then the information acts on more stuff and becomes more objects.

47:24.480 --> 47:30.480
 So I think there is a transition to information that occurs when you go from stuff to objects.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.480
 Information is emergent.

47:33.480 --> 47:34.480
 Not emergent.

47:34.480 --> 47:39.480
 Information is actionable memories from the universe.

47:39.480 --> 47:44.480
 So when memories become actionable, that's information.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.480
 But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.

47:47.480 --> 47:48.480
 Yeah.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.480
 And then it's not information.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.480
 And actionable is what you can create.

47:52.480 --> 47:53.480
 You can use it.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.480
 If you can't use it, then it's not information.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.480
 If you can't transmit it, if it doesn't have any causal consequence.

47:59.480 --> 48:00.480
 I was in the forest.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.480
 I don't understand.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.480
 Why is that not information?

48:03.480 --> 48:04.480
 It's not information.

48:04.480 --> 48:09.480
 It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.

48:09.480 --> 48:10.480
 Yeah.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.480
 Yeah.

48:11.480 --> 48:12.480
 This is cool.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.480
 It's happening.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.480
 The happening requires information.

48:15.480 --> 48:16.480
 Can't stuff.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.480
 Stuff is always happening.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.480
 No.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.480
 This is where the physicists and the mathematicians get themselves in a loop, because I think

48:22.480 --> 48:29.480
 the universe, I mean, I think, say, Max Tecmark and is very playful and say like the universe,

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
 the universe is just math.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.480
 Then we might as well not bother having any conversation because the conversation already

48:34.480 --> 48:37.480
 written, we just might as well go to the future and say, can you just give us the conversations

48:37.480 --> 48:38.480
 happened already?

48:38.480 --> 48:43.480
 So I think the problem is that mathematicians are so successful at labeling stuff and so

48:43.480 --> 48:47.480
 successful understanding of stuff through those labels, they forget that actually those

48:47.480 --> 48:52.480
 labels had to emerge and that information had to be built on those memories.

48:52.480 --> 48:57.480
 So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph, when they become actionable and the

48:57.480 --> 49:02.480
 graph can loop back on itself or interact with other graphs and they can intersect, those

49:02.480 --> 49:05.480
 memories become actionable and therefore their information.

49:05.480 --> 49:10.480
 And I think you just changed my mind on something pretty big, but I don't have a pen.

49:10.480 --> 49:14.480
 So I can't write, I'm going to write it down later, but roughly the idea is, is like you've

49:14.480 --> 49:20.480
 got these, these two graphs of objects of stuff that you have memories and then when

49:20.480 --> 49:25.480
 they intersect and then they can act on each other, that's maybe the mechanism by which

49:25.480 --> 49:28.480
 information is then, so then you can then abstract.

49:28.480 --> 49:32.480
 So when one graph can then build another graph and say, hey, you don't have to go through

49:32.480 --> 49:35.480
 the nonsense we had to go through, here's literally the way to do it.

49:35.480 --> 49:39.480
 Stuff always comes first, but then when stuff builds the abstraction, the abstraction can

49:39.480 --> 49:41.480
 be then teleported onto other stuff.

49:41.480 --> 49:44.480
 And the abstraction is the looping back to power.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.480
 Okay.

49:45.480 --> 49:47.480
 Am I making, I don't know, I've got stuck.

49:47.480 --> 49:51.480
 Yeah, so first a God made stuff.

49:51.480 --> 49:57.480
 And after that, when you start to be able to form abstractions, that's when the, the

49:57.480 --> 50:00.480
 audition memory week, the universe can remember.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.480
 God is the memory, the universe can remember.

50:02.480 --> 50:06.480
 Otherwise there's not, wait, did you deciphering that statement hundreds of years from now?

50:06.480 --> 50:07.480
 What does that mean?

50:07.480 --> 50:09.480
 What does the human being by this?

50:09.480 --> 50:12.480
 Hey, look, don't, don't diss my, my one liners.

50:12.480 --> 50:16.480
 It took me 15 seconds to come up.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.480
 I don't know what it means.

50:17.480 --> 50:19.480
 What does it mean?

50:19.480 --> 50:24.480
 Okay, wait, we need to, well, how do we get onto this?

50:24.480 --> 50:30.480
 We were time causality mathematics.

50:30.480 --> 50:43.480
 So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff, objects, memory, and information?

50:43.480 --> 50:44.480
 What is that?

50:44.480 --> 50:45.480
 It's mathematics.

50:45.480 --> 50:48.480
 It's the most efficient labeling scheme that you can apply to lots of different graphs.

50:48.480 --> 50:52.480
 Well, the labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.480
 Can I try?

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
 Yep, sure, please.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.480
 Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?

50:56.480 --> 50:57.480
 I'm shocked.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.480
 Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

50:59.480 --> 51:00.480
 But it's correct.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.480
 Go ahead.

51:01.480 --> 51:02.480
 Excellent.

51:02.480 --> 51:06.480
 Um, no, I mean, I think, um, I think we have a problem, right?

51:06.480 --> 51:08.480
 Cause we, we can't not be us.

51:08.480 --> 51:11.480
 Like we're stuck in the shells we are and we're trying to observe the world.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.480
 And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.

51:13.480 --> 51:18.480
 And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful is to try to imagine if you were outside

51:18.480 --> 51:23.480
 of us looking at us as physical systems using mathematics, what would be the specific features

51:23.480 --> 51:29.480
 you associate to the property of understanding mathematics and being able to implement it

51:29.480 --> 51:31.480
 in the universe, right?

51:31.480 --> 51:36.480
 And, um, and when you do that, mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties

51:36.480 --> 51:41.480
 relative to other kinds of abstraction we might talk about, like language or artistic

51:41.480 --> 51:42.480
 expression.

51:42.480 --> 51:47.480
 Uh, one of those properties is the one I mentioned already that is really easy to copy between

51:47.480 --> 51:48.480
 physical media.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.480
 So if I give you a mathematical statement, you almost immediately know what I mean.

51:51.480 --> 51:54.480
 If I tell you the sky is blue, you might say, is it gold ball blue?

51:54.480 --> 51:55.480
 Is it your blue?

51:55.480 --> 51:56.480
 What color blue do you mean?

51:56.480 --> 52:00.480
 And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.480
 So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it when it's copied between physical systems.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.480
 It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.

52:05.480 --> 52:11.480
 Um, and then the second one is it retains its property of actually what it can do in the

52:11.480 --> 52:13.480
 universe when it's copied.

52:13.480 --> 52:17.480
 So the example I like to give there is, is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.

52:17.480 --> 52:23.480
 Um, it's actually, it's a, it's a compressed regularity of a bunch of, uh, phenomena that

52:23.480 --> 52:27.480
 we observe in the universe, but then it'll, that information actually is a causal in a

52:27.480 --> 52:31.480
 sense that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do without that particular knowledge

52:31.480 --> 52:32.480
 and that particular abstraction.

52:32.480 --> 52:36.480
 And in this case, like launch satellites to space or send people to Mars or whatever it

52:36.480 --> 52:37.480
 is.

52:37.480 --> 52:42.480
 Um, so, so if you look at us from the outside and you say, what is it for physical systems

52:42.480 --> 52:49.480
 to invent a thing called mathematics and then to use, uh, and, and then, and then it to

52:49.480 --> 52:55.480
 become a physical observable mathematics is kind of like the universally copyable information

52:55.480 --> 53:00.480
 that allows, uh, new possibilities spaces to be open in the future because it allows this

53:00.480 --> 53:04.480
 kind of ability to map one physical system to another and actually understand that the

53:04.480 --> 53:05.480
 general principles.

53:05.480 --> 53:07.480
 Yeah.

53:07.480 --> 53:11.480
 So is it helping the, uh, overlap of causal graphs then by mapping?

53:11.480 --> 53:15.480
 Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is in terms of the physical theory of assembly

53:15.480 --> 53:21.480
 would be some feature of the structure of the assembly spaces of causal graphs and their

53:21.480 --> 53:22.480
 relationship to each other.

53:22.480 --> 53:26.480
 So for example, and I mean, this is things that we're going to have to work out over

53:26.480 --> 53:27.480
 the next few years.

53:27.480 --> 53:30.480
 I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory here.

53:30.480 --> 53:34.480
 Um, but as is usual, uh, diving off the deep end.

53:34.480 --> 53:39.480
 Um, but I would expect that we would be able to come up with a theory of like, why is it

53:39.480 --> 53:42.480
 that some physical systems can communicate with each other?

53:42.480 --> 53:47.480
 Um, like language language is basically because we're objects extended over time and some

53:47.480 --> 53:50.480
 of the history of that assembly space actually overlaps.

53:50.480 --> 53:54.480
 And when we communicate, it's because we actually have shared structure in our causal history.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.480
 Let me have another quick go at this, right?

53:56.480 --> 53:57.480
 So I think we all agree.

53:57.480 --> 54:02.480
 So I think, um, we take mathematics for granted because we've gone through this chain, right?

54:02.480 --> 54:05.480
 Of, you know, um, we all, we all share a language now.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.480
 Okay.

54:06.480 --> 54:10.480
 And we can, well, we share, so we have languages that we can, we can make interoperable.

54:10.480 --> 54:16.480
 And, and so whether you're speaking, I don't know, all the different dialects of Chinese

54:16.480 --> 54:22.480
 or the different dialects of English, French, German, whatever, you can interconvert them.

54:22.480 --> 54:25.480
 The interesting thing about mathematics now is that everybody on planet Earth, every human

54:25.480 --> 54:31.480
 being and computers, um, share that common language, that language was constructed by

54:31.480 --> 54:32.480
 a process in time.

54:32.480 --> 54:37.480
 So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math is those, those pro right from the, you

54:37.480 --> 54:38.480
 know, mathematics didn't occur.

54:38.480 --> 54:41.480
 It didn't exist before life.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.480
 Abstraction was invented by life, right?

54:43.480 --> 54:47.480
 That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable of mathematical things.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.480
 Wait, wait a minute.

54:48.480 --> 54:52.480
 Can we just ask that, that old famous question is math invented or discovered?

54:52.480 --> 54:58.480
 So when you say, assembly invented or whatever, uh, uh, you, you, you, it means.

54:58.480 --> 55:01.480
 Assembly is a mathematical theory, but sorry.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.480
 Right.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.480
 Are we arguing?

55:03.480 --> 55:04.480
 Exactly.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.480
 Are we arguing now?

55:05.480 --> 55:06.480
 That's what it sounds like.

55:06.480 --> 55:07.480
 Are we discovering?

55:07.480 --> 55:08.480
 No.

55:08.480 --> 55:09.480
 Well, yes and no.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.480
 I would say.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.480
 You call mathematics a language.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
 I would say developing.

55:12.480 --> 55:18.480
 Like I'm pretty sure that, um, there, there are some very common seeds of mathematics in

55:18.480 --> 55:19.480
 the universe, right?

55:19.480 --> 55:25.480
 But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now is not discovered.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.480
 It's invented.

55:26.480 --> 55:30.480
 Um, but even though I think there's two terms are very triggering and I don't think they're

55:30.480 --> 55:35.280
 necessarily useful because I think that what people do, the mathematicians that say our

55:35.280 --> 55:40.680
 mathematics was discovered because they live in a universe where there is no time and it

55:40.680 --> 55:42.480
 just all exists.

55:42.480 --> 55:46.760
 But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way you can create, let's say I'm going

55:46.760 --> 55:51.480
 to go and create and make a piece of art.

55:51.480 --> 55:56.160
 Did I make that piece of art or did I discover, discover it?

55:56.160 --> 55:57.560
 Like inventing the aeroplane.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.560
 Did I invent the aeroplane?

55:58.560 --> 55:59.560
 Let's stick with the aeroplane.

55:59.560 --> 56:00.560
 The aeroplane is a good one.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.840
 I, let's say I'm, I did, did I discover the aeroplane?

56:02.840 --> 56:05.640
 Well, in a way, the universe discovered the aeroplane because it's just chucked a load

56:05.640 --> 56:09.880
 of atoms together and a load of random human beings want to do stuff and they, we, we discovered

56:09.880 --> 56:12.280
 the aeroplane in the space of possibilities.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.560
 But here's the thing.

56:13.560 --> 56:21.580
 When the space of possibilities is so vast, infinite, almost, and you're able to actualize

56:21.580 --> 56:24.680
 one of those in an object, then you are inventing it.

56:24.680 --> 56:28.720
 So in mathematics, because there are infinite number of theorems, the fact you're actually

56:28.720 --> 56:33.560
 pulling, there's no difference between inventing a mathematical structure and inventing the

56:33.560 --> 56:34.560
 aeroplane.

56:34.560 --> 56:35.560
 They're the same thing.

56:35.560 --> 56:38.320
 But that doesn't mean that now the aeroplane exists in the universe.

56:38.320 --> 56:43.200
 It's something weird about the universe that, you know, so I think that the more, this is

56:43.200 --> 56:49.360
 the thing that you probably, the more memory required for the object, the more invented

56:49.360 --> 56:50.360
 it is.

56:50.360 --> 56:56.280
 So when a mathematical theorem has a, has a, needs more bytes to store it, the more invented

56:56.280 --> 57:00.120
 it is and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.

57:00.120 --> 57:02.120
 But everything then is invented.

57:02.120 --> 57:04.080
 It's just more or less invented.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.080
 Absolutely.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.080
 Okay.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.920
 The universe has to generate everything as it goes.

57:07.920 --> 57:08.920
 Yeah.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.120
 And it wasn't there in the beginning.

57:11.120 --> 57:14.880
 And the way we're thinking it, when you're thinking about the difference between invented

57:14.880 --> 57:17.880
 and discovered is because we're throwing away all the memory.

57:17.880 --> 57:18.880
 Yeah.

57:18.880 --> 57:24.040
 And if you start to think in terms of causality and time, then those things become the same.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.040
 Everything is invented.

57:25.040 --> 57:28.280
 And the idea is to make everything intrinsic to the universe.

57:28.280 --> 57:32.240
 So I think one of the features of assembly theory is we don't want to have external observers.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.240
 There's been this long tradition in physics of trying to describe the universe from the

57:35.240 --> 57:37.880
 outside and not the inside.

57:37.880 --> 57:41.440
 And the universe has to generate everything itself if you do it from the inside.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.680
 Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.

57:44.680 --> 57:49.880
 They'll take you 15 seconds to say that and do it to come up with that also.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.880
 No, I've thought of that before.

57:51.880 --> 57:52.880
 Okay.

57:52.880 --> 57:53.880
 It's a good line.

57:53.880 --> 57:54.880
 Are you making fun again?

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
 No, I'm not making fun.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.880
 I'm having fun.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.880
 There's a difference.

57:57.880 --> 57:58.880
 Oh, that's good.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.880
 All right.

57:59.880 --> 58:00.880
 She's inventing fun.

58:00.880 --> 58:01.880
 I'm not all intimidated.

58:01.880 --> 58:02.880
 Yeah.

58:02.880 --> 58:06.320
 And there's a causal history to that fun.

58:06.320 --> 58:11.640
 You mentioned that there's no way to communicate with aliens until there's overlap in the

58:11.640 --> 58:14.920
 cause of graph.

58:14.920 --> 58:21.440
 Communication includes being able to see them and like what are we, this is the question

58:21.440 --> 58:26.480
 is, is communication any kind of detection?

58:26.480 --> 58:32.760
 And if so, what do aliens look like as you get more and more overlap on the cause of

58:32.760 --> 58:33.760
 graph?

58:33.760 --> 58:39.680
 You're assuming, let's assume that so when you see them and they see you, you're assuming

58:39.680 --> 58:44.280
 they have vision, they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time, there's a lot

58:44.280 --> 58:45.880
 of assumptions we're making.

58:45.880 --> 58:46.880
 What detection?

58:46.880 --> 58:47.880
 All right.

58:47.880 --> 58:48.880
 Let's step back.

58:48.880 --> 58:49.880
 So yes.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.880
 Okay.

58:50.880 --> 58:51.880
 You're right.

58:51.880 --> 58:53.520
 So when in the English language, when we say the word see, we mean visually, they show

58:53.520 --> 58:56.440
 up to a party and it's like, oh, wow, that's an alien.

58:56.440 --> 58:57.440
 That's visual.

58:57.440 --> 58:58.440
 That's 3D.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.040
 That's okay.

59:00.040 --> 59:05.680
 And that's also assuming scale, spatial scale of something that's visible to you.

59:05.680 --> 59:09.920
 So it can't be microscopic or it can't be so big that you don't even realize that's an

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
 entity.

59:10.920 --> 59:12.160
 Okay.

59:12.160 --> 59:14.080
 But other kinds of detection too.

59:14.080 --> 59:15.640
 I would make it more abstract and go down.

59:15.640 --> 59:21.360
 I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite the Arecibo message in assembly theory and

59:21.360 --> 59:27.320
 also to abandon binary because I don't think aliens necessarily, why should they have binary?

59:27.320 --> 59:32.360
 Well they have some basic elements with which to do information exchange.

59:32.360 --> 59:37.280
 Let's make it more fundamental or more universal.

59:37.280 --> 59:40.760
 So we need to think about what is the universal way of making a memory and then we should

59:40.760 --> 59:43.600
 reencode Arecibo in that way.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.760
 What's more basic than zeroes and ones?

59:45.760 --> 59:49.520
 Well, it's really difficult to get out of that causal chain because we're so, so let's

59:49.520 --> 59:51.800
 erase the idea of zero for a moment.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.360
 It took human beings a long time to come up with the idea of zero.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.000
 Now, now you got the idea of zero.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
 You can't throw away.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
 It's so useful.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.160
 To discover the idea of zero.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:00.160
 To discover or invent.

1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:01.160
 I don't know.

1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:04.600
 But it took a long time, so it was invented.

1:00:04.600 --> 1:00:05.600
 That's right.

1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:06.600
 Yeah.

1:00:06.600 --> 1:00:07.600
 I think zero was invented.

1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:08.600
 It's exactly.

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:10.600
 So it's not given that aliens know what zero is.

1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:13.680
 It just has the one massive assumption.

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:18.280
 It's a useful discovery that you're saying if you break the causal chain, there might

1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:20.680
 be some other more efficient way of representing.

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:26.400
 That's why I want to meet him and ask him for a shortcut, but you won't be able to ask

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:27.400
 him until.

1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:29.880
 Well, so I interrupted you and I think you're making good point.

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:35.880
 I was just going to say, well, look, sorry, rather than saying, please internet, tweet

1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:37.560
 at him for the rude interruptions.

1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:38.560
 Go ahead.

1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:39.560
 I'm sorry.

1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:40.560
 No, it's okay.

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:41.560
 Maybe it's change.

1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:45.960
 How do we say, oh, I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:53.320
 I would like to know what is the full spectrum of what aliens might look like to us.

1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:58.880
 Now that we've laid this all on, on the table of like, all right, so there has to be some

1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:03.920
 overlap and this causal chain that led to them.

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:05.840
 What are we, what are we looking for?

1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:07.000
 What do you think we should be looking for?

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:12.480
 So you met, you mentioned mass spec, measuring certain objects that aliens could create or

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:15.160
 are aliens themselves.

1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:19.320
 We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet or maybe what, what, what the, what the hell

1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:23.120
 is the basic object we're trying to measure the assembly index of?

1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:24.120
 Let's cut ourselves a break.

1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:29.080
 Let's assume that they are, they, they're metabolized, they've got an energy source

1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:32.720
 and they're, they've, they're a size that we can recognize.

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:36.840
 Let's give ourselves a break because there could be aliens that are so big, we won't

1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:37.840
 recognize we're seeing them.

1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:40.880
 And there might be aliens that are so small, we don't yet have the ability to, you know,

1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:44.600
 we don't have microscopes that can see, you know, far enough away that just wouldn't be

1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:45.600
 able to see them.

1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:46.600
 So what's a good range?

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:50.720
 So let's just make a range of, let's just be very anthropocentric and say we're going

1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:55.400
 to look for aliens roughly our size and technology our size because we, we know it's possible

1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:56.400
 on earth, right?

1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:00.400
 I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be to, to find exoplanets that in the same zone

1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:06.480
 as earth in terms of heat and stuff and then say, Hey, if there's that same kind of gravity,

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:13.400
 same type of stuff, we could reasonably assume that the alien life there might use a similar

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:16.840
 kind of physical infrastructure and then we're good.

1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:20.120
 So then, then your, then, then your question becomes really relevant and say, right, let's

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:22.520
 use vision, sound, touch.

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:24.960
 So, okay, that's really nice.

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:31.680
 So that if there's a lot of aliens out there, there's a good likelihood if you match to

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:37.640
 the planet that they're going to be in the same spatial and temporal operating in the

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:40.520
 same spatial temporal domain as humans.

1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:41.520
 Okay.

1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:48.080
 Within that, what, what, what do they look like visually?

1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:50.280
 What do they sound like?

1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:51.280
 What are they?

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:52.280
 Oh God, this sounds creepy.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:54.280
 It tastes like, what is it?

1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.440
 Oh, it smells like, it smells like that's the smell.

1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:57.440
 It sounds like our clubhouse.

1:02:57.440 --> 1:02:59.440
 It was like, can we have sex of aliens?

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:02.520
 Which was basically me saying, passionate, passionate love, but it wasn't actually about

1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:03.520
 sex.

1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:04.520
 It was about, is our chemistry compatible?

1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:05.520
 Right.

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:06.520
 Is there some?

1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:07.520
 Yeah.

1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:08.520
 Yeah.

1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:09.520
 Can, can we?

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:10.520
 Yeah.

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:11.520
 Are they edible too?

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:12.520
 They could be very edible.

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:13.520
 They could be delicious.

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:14.760
 That's why I want to see some aliens, right?

1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:21.760
 Because I think, are there, I think evolution, I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:23.440
 Because why, why generate memory?

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:27.760
 Why generate storage, the need for storage space when you can use symmetry?

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:32.520
 So, and symmetry is quite, maybe quite effective in allowing you to mechanically design stuff,

1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:33.520
 right?

1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:36.760
 So maybe alien, it could, you could be, would be reasonable to assume that aliens could

1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:42.880
 have, they could be bipedal, they could be symmetric in the same way, might have a couple

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:44.920
 of eyes, or a couple of senses.

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:49.000
 I mean, we can make, make them, perhaps there's this whole zoo of different aliens out there

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.280
 and we'll never get to be able to classify some of the weird aliens we can't interact

1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:55.000
 with because they have made such weird stuff.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.000
 Yeah.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.200
 But we are just going to look at, we're going to find aliens that look most like us.

1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:00.200
 Why not?

1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:02.360
 Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.

1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:03.360
 Yeah.

1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:04.360
 Yeah.

1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:08.520
 But I think it's really hard to imagine what the space of aliens is because the space is

1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:09.520
 huge.

1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:13.160
 Because, you know, like one of the arguments that you can make about wildlife emerges in

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:18.120
 chemistry is because chemistry is the first scale in terms of like, you know, building

1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:23.280
 up objects from elementary objects, that the number of possible things that could exist

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:27.000
 is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once, right?

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:32.080
 So, so you imagine you have two planets and they're cooking some geochemistry, you know,

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:37.120
 our planet invented one kind of biochemistry and presumably as you start building up the

1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:41.400
 complexity of the molecules, the chances of the overlap in those trajectories, those

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:45.280
 causal chains being built up is probably very low.

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:49.160
 And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced along its evolutionary path.

1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:53.280
 So I think it's very difficult to imagine predicting the technologies that aliens are

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:54.280
 going to have.

1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:59.080
 I mean, it's, it's so, it's, you're looking at basically planets have kind of convergent

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:00.920
 chemistry, but there's some variability.

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:04.320
 And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth into the possibility space for chemistry.

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:10.040
 So do you think we would detect the, the technology, the objects created by aliens before we detect

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:11.040
 the aliens?

1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:12.040
 Possibly.

1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:17.680
 So when you're talking about measuring assembly index, don't you think we would detect the

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:26.120
 garbage first, like at the outskirts of alien civilizations, isn't this going to be trash?

1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:30.280
 I think I would come back to Arecibo, the Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope

1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:33.600
 built by Drake, I think, and, and Sagan.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:35.320
 How's Arecibo spelled?

1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:36.320
 Arecibo.

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:37.320
 Yes.

1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:38.320
 Thank you.

1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:39.320
 And there we go.

1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:40.320
 They got out there.

1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:42.640
 That's the telescope that sent the message that you're talking about.

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:45.600
 So that message was sent where?

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:52.400
 It was beamed, it beamed at a star, a specific star, and it was sent out many years ago.

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:56.880
 And what they did, so this is why it's pushing on binary, it's a binary message.

1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.040
 I think it's a semi prime length number of characters.

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:07.960
 I think 2073 by 23, I think, and it basically represents human bit, proton, binary, human

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:10.960
 beings, DNA, male and female.

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:12.800
 And it's, it's really cool.

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:20.720
 But I'm just wondering if it could be done, not making any, because it made assumptions

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:22.320
 that aliens speak binary.

1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:23.320
 Yeah.

1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:24.320
 Why make that assumption?

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:28.640
 Why not just assume that if the difference between physics, chemistry and biology is

1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:36.960
 the amount of memory that's recordable by the substrates, then surely the universal thing,

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:41.640
 I'm going to make some sacrilegious statement, which I think is pretty awesome for people

1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:42.640
 to argue with.

1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:48.960
 So this is, we're looking at an image where it's the entirety of the message encoded in

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:49.960
 binary.

1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:54.280
 And then there's probably interpretation of different parts of that image.

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:58.000
 There's a person, there's green parts.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.720
 It looks like for people just listening like a Tetris, a game of Tetris.

1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:06.120
 So it's encoding in minimal ways, a bunch of cool information probably.

1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:07.120
 Representing all of us.

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:09.720
 So the top, it's kind of teaching yourself to count and then it all goes all the way

1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:14.120
 down teaching you chemistry and then just says, but it makes so many assumptions.

1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:19.160
 And I think if we can actually, so look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:23.360
 expressing this, but I'll have a go and you can correct it if you want, which is like,

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:29.000
 one of the things that Sarah has had a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000
 life.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.240
 And this is one of the reasons why we're working together, because we don't really care about

1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:34.240
 the origin of life.

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:38.800
 We want to make life, make aliens and find aliens, make aliens, find aliens.

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:42.280
 I think we might have to make aliens in the lab before we find aliens in the universe.

1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:43.280
 Right.

1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:45.480
 I think that would be a cool way to do it.

1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:48.280
 So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?

1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:52.640
 Well, it's selection through assembly theory, creating memories.

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:57.680
 Because when you create memories, you can then command your domain, you can basically

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.880
 do stuff, you can command matter.

1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:05.560
 So we need to find a way by understanding what life is of how the minimal way to command

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:08.320
 matter, how that would emerge in the universe.

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:13.720
 And if we want to communicate, I mean, maybe we don't want to necessarily uniformly communicate.

1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:18.120
 What I would do, perhaps if I had, is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth to

1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:22.360
 have this magic way of communicating with aliens, get them quite a far away from Earth,

1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:27.160
 plausibly deniable, and then send out the message that would then attract all the aliens

1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:30.680
 and then basically work out if they're a friend or foe and how they want to hang out.

1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:33.600
 The message is being something has to do with the memories.

1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:34.600
 Yes.

1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:39.520
 Like the assembly version of our SIBO, so that everyone in the universe that has been understands

1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:41.080
 what life is.

1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:43.440
 So aliens need to work out what they are.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:46.400
 Once they've worked out what they are, they then can work out how to encode what they

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:48.720
 are and then they can go out and send messages.

1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:55.960
 It's like the universal, the Rosetta Stone for life in the universe is working out how

1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:56.960
 the memories are built.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:02.960
 I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well, whether that, you would agree with that?

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:09.280
 No, I wanted to raise a different point, which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens

1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:12.000
 yet because we haven't gotten the technology.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.680
 And presumably we think assembly theory is the right way of doing it, but I don't think

1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:19.800
 that we know how to go from the kind of data you're describing, Lex, like, you know, visual

1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:23.400
 data or smell to construct the assembly spaces yet.

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:28.440
 And in some ways, I think that the problem of life detection really is the same problem

1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:35.160
 at the foundations of AI that we don't understand how to get machines to see causal graphs to

1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:38.000
 see reality in terms of causation.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:44.040
 And so I think assembly and AI are going to intersect in interesting ways, hopefully.

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:49.840
 But the sort of key point, and I've been trying to make this argument more recently and might

1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:55.120
 write an essay on it, is people talk about the great filter, which is, again, this doomsday

1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:58.440
 thing that people want to say, there's no aliens out there because something terrible

1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:00.480
 happened to them.

1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:06.000
 And it matters whether that's in our past or our future as to the longevity of our species,

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.240
 presumably, which is why people find it interesting.

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:10.840
 But I think it's not a physical filter.

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:11.960
 It's not like things go extinct.

1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:15.800
 I think it's literally we don't have the technology to see them.

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:16.800
 And you can see that with microscopes.

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:20.600
 I mean, we didn't know there were microscopes on this table for our tables for thousands

1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:21.600
 of years or telescopes.

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:23.600
 Like, there's so much of the universe we can't see.

1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:28.040
 And then basically what we have done as a species is outsource our physical perceptions

1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:33.400
 to technology, building microscopes based on our eyes, you know, and building seismometers

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:36.320
 based on our sense of feelings, like feel earthquakes and things.

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:39.600
 And AI is basically we're trying to outsource what's actually happening in our thinking

1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:43.400
 apparatus into machines now into technological devices.

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:47.320
 And maybe that's the key technology that's going to allow us to see things like us and

1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:48.840
 see the universe in a totally different way.

1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:50.280
 But you kind of mentioned the great filter.

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:54.160
 Do you think there's a way through technology to stop being able to see stuff?

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:55.720
 So can you take step backwards?

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:56.720
 I think so.

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:57.720
 Yeah.

1:10:57.720 --> 1:10:58.720
 Did you imply that with the great?

1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.840
 Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter in the sense that a example

1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:09.720
 of life evolving on a planet over billions of years has to acquire a certain amount of

1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:14.360
 knowledge and technology to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.

1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:20.960
 Well, that's the sense I have is, when you talk with physicists, engineers in general,

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:28.120
 there's this kind of idea that we have most of the tools already to hear the signal.

1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:32.800
 But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools to see the signal.

1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:33.800
 Yeah, I agree.

1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:35.880
 Yeah, that's the biggest, like to hear.

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:38.680
 We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.

1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:39.680
 Yeah.

1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:40.680
 Aliens are everywhere.

1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:41.680
 We just don't have the...

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:42.680
 Exactly.

1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:43.680
 Yeah.

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:44.680
 Well, that's...

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:48.080
 I mean, I got this in part, actually, because you were like, you know, last time I was here,

1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:49.080
 I was like, look at the carpet.

1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:52.560
 You know, could it be like if you had an alien detector, would the carpet be aliens?

1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:54.160
 I mean, I think we really don't...

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:59.640
 So it would be both aliens would nevertheless have a high assembly index or produce things

1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:00.640
 of high assembly index.

1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:01.640
 Yeah.

1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:02.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:08.200
 High assembly index, you have to have a detector that can recognize high assembly index in

1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:09.200
 all its forms.

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:10.200
 Yeah.

1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:11.200
 Yes.

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:12.200
 That's it.

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:13.200
 That's it.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:14.200
 Take data, construct assembly space.

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.200
 Yeah.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:16.200
 Those patterns, basically.

1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:21.520
 So one way to think about high assembly index is interesting patterns, all of basic ingredients.

1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:25.640
 I can give you an example, because, I mean, in molecules we've been talking about in objects,

1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:29.120
 but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.

1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:34.080
 Like imagine you're just like, I always get bothered by the fact that like, when you look

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:38.000
 at birds flocking, you can describe that with like a simple boys model or like, you

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000
 know, people use spin glass to describe animal behavior, and those are like really simple

1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000
 physics models.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:47.880
 Yet you're looking at a system that you know has agency and there's intelligence in those

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:49.000
 birds.

1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000
 And I...

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.840
 And basically, like, you can't help but think there must be some statistical signatures

1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:55.840
 of the fact that they're...

1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:59.720
 That's a group of agents versus, you know, like, I don't know, you know, the physics

1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:03.840
 example, maybe like, I don't know, Brownian motion or something.

1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:06.960
 And so what we're trying to do is actually apply assembly to trajectory data to try to

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:12.400
 say there's a minimal amount of causal history to build up certain trajectories for observed

1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:14.760
 agents, that's like an agency detector for behavior.

1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:21.200
 Do you think it's possible to do some like, like Boids or those kinds of things, like

1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:28.400
 artificial, like cellular automata, play with those ideas with assembly, with assembly theory?

1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:36.600
 Have you found any useful, really simple mathematical like simulation tools that allow you to play

1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:37.600
 with these concepts?

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:38.600
 Yeah.

1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:44.440
 So like one, of course, you're doing math spec in this physical space with chemistry,

1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.360
 but it just seems, well, I mean, computer science person, maybe, it seems easier to

1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:49.360
 just...

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:50.360
 I agree with you.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:57.760
 It's easier in terms of tweeting visual information on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly,

1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:02.160
 to play like, here's an organism of a low assembly index, and here's an organism of

1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:03.800
 a high assembly index.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:09.440
 And let's watch them create more and more memories and more and more complex objects.

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:14.280
 And so like, in mathematics, you get to observe what that looks like, to build up an intuition

1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:15.840
 what assembly index is like.

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:17.920
 We are building a toolkit right now.

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:22.000
 So I think it's a really good idea, but what we've got to do is, I'm kind of still obsessed

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.280
 with the infrastructure required.

1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:29.600
 And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information in mathematics, when human beings,

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:33.480
 when human beings, we take a lot of the infrastructure for granted.

1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:35.960
 And I think we have to strip that back a bit for going forward.

1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:36.960
 But you're absolutely right.

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:42.960
 I would agree that I think the fact that we exist in the universe is like, I can see

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:46.320
 that lots of people would disagree with the statement, but I don't think, I don't think

1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:48.520
 Sarah will, but I don't know.

1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:54.000
 The fact that objects exist, I don't think anyone on earth will disagree that objects

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.960
 can exist elsewhere, right?

1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:58.640
 But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.

1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:04.760
 But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition, the universe's ability to

1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:10.560
 acquire memory is the very first step for building life.

1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:14.200
 And that must be, that's so easy to happen.

1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:20.560
 So therefore, alien life is everywhere, because all alien life is, is those memories being

1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:24.920
 compressed and minimized and the alien equivalent of the cell working.

1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:29.880
 So I think that we will build new technologies to find aliens.

1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:34.600
 But we need to understand what we are first and how we go from physics to chemistry to

1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:36.640
 biology.

1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:41.760
 The most interesting thing, as you're saying to these two organisms, different assemblies,

1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:47.000
 is when you get into biology, biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent.

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.280
 Physics is, chemistry is less weird, because the rules of chemistry are smaller than the

1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.280
 rules of biology.

1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:57.720
 And then going away to physics, where you have a very nicely tangible number of ways

1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:00.440
 of arranging things.

1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:04.040
 And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:08.080
 And so once we get there, my dream is that we are just going to be able to suddenly are,

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:10.640
 I mean, I'm, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.

1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:14.000
 I'm not mean to be arrogant, it's just, again, I've just got this hammer called assembly

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.520
 and everything's a nail.

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:20.040
 But I think that once we crack it, we'll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes

1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:21.200
 to find aliens.

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:27.720
 Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee on the number of aliens that are

1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:28.720
 out there?

1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:29.720
 So, and,

1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:30.720
 Do you actually, yeah, well.

1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:31.720
 And what they look like.

1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:37.240
 So any of the things we've been talking about, is there nuanced, oh, it's always nice to

1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:42.520
 discover wisdom through nuanced disagreement.

1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:48.840
 Yeah, I don't, I don't wholly disagree, but I think, but I do think I disagree.

1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:54.800
 It's kind of, there's nuance there, but, but we disagree, no, it's fine.

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:55.800
 It is nuanced, right?

1:16:55.800 --> 1:17:01.280
 So you made the point earlier that you think, you know, once we discover what alien light,

1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:04.560
 what life is, we'll see alien life everywhere.

1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:07.620
 And I think I agree on some levels in the sense that I think the physics that governs

1:17:07.620 --> 1:17:12.320
 us is universal, but I don't know how far I would go to say, to say that we're a likely

1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:17.320
 phenomena because we don't understand all of the features of the transition at the origin

1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:22.720
 of life, which, which we would just say in assembly is you go from the no memory physics

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:28.160
 to there's like a critical transition around the assembly index where assembliness starts

1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:29.160
 to increase.

1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:33.000
 And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere and complexification of the biosphere.

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.760
 So there's a principle of increasing assembliness where that goes back to what I was saying

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:40.280
 at the very beginning about the physics of the possible that the universe basically gets

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:45.080
 in this mode of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.

1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:50.720
 Now how often that transition happens that you get the kind of cascading effect that

1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:51.720
 we get in our biosphere.

1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:55.600
 I think we don't know if we did, we would know the likelihood of life in the universe.

1:17:55.600 --> 1:17:58.400
 And a lot of people want to say life is common, but I don't think that we can say that yet.

1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:01.440
 So we have the empirical data, which I think you would agree with.

1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:06.560
 But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have, which I don't like, but

1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:12.240
 I did have it, which is, you know, if life emerges on one planet and you get this real

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:17.000
 high density of things that can exist on that planet, is it sort of dominating the density

1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.400
 of creation that the universe can actually generate?

1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:22.520
 So like if you're thinking about counting entropy, right, like the universe has a certain

1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:27.960
 amount of stuff in it, and then, you know, assembly is kind of like an entropic principle.

1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:34.080
 That's not entropy, but the idea is that now transformations among stuff or the actual

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:39.320
 physical histories of things now become things that you have to count as far as saying that

1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:44.040
 these things exist and we're increasing the number of things that exist.

1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:47.640
 And if you think about that cosmologically, maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:48.640
 of the whole universe.

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:49.640
 I don't know.

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:50.640
 But I...

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:51.640
 How's that...

1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:52.640
 Can you explain that a little bit?

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:57.920
 Why can anyone geographical region suck up the creative capacity of the universe?

1:18:57.920 --> 1:18:58.920
 Just like...

1:18:58.920 --> 1:18:59.920
 No.

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:00.920
 I know.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:01.920
 It's a ridiculous thought.

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:02.920
 I don't...

1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:03.920
 I don't actually agree with it, but it was just a thought experiment.

1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:07.520
 I love that you can have thoughts that you don't like and don't agree with, but you have

1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:08.920
 to think through them anyway.

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:09.920
 Yeah.

1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:11.920
 The human mind is fascinating.

1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:12.920
 Yeah.

1:19:12.920 --> 1:19:16.600
 I think these sort of like counterfactual thought experiments are really good when you're

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:20.080
 trying to build new theories because you have to think through all the consequences.

1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:25.120
 And there are people that want to try to account for, say, the degrees of freedom on our planet

1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:31.000
 in cosmological inventories of talking about the entropy of the universe and when we're

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.520
 thinking about cosmological era of time and things like that.

1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:36.680
 Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals as they stand now, but assembly

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:38.400
 would give you a way of counting it.

1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:43.040
 And then the question is if there's a certain maximal capacity of the universe's speed

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.600
 of generating stuff, which Leo always has this argument that assembly is about time,

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:53.080
 the universe is generating more states, really what it's generating is more assembly possibilities.

1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:57.480
 And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that, that the universe is accelerating

1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:00.200
 its expansion because that makes more physical space.

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:04.120
 And what's happening on our planet is it's accelerating in the expansion of possible

1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:05.120
 things that exist.

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:09.480
 And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate of what it can do to generate things.

1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:13.160
 And then if there is a maximal rate, maybe only a certain number of planets can actually

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:17.520
 do that, or there's a trade off about the pace of growth on certain planets versus others.

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:19.320
 I have a million questions there.

1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:20.320
 Do you have thoughts on?

1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:21.320
 Just a quick, yeah.

1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:22.320
 I'll just say something very quick.

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:23.320
 It's a flat experiment.

1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:24.320
 No, it's good.

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:25.320
 I think I get it.

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:26.320
 I think I get it.

1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:34.000
 So what I want to say is when I mean aliens everywhere, I mean memories are the prerequisite

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:40.480
 for aliens via selection and then concentration of selection when selection becomes autonomous.

1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:46.000
 So what I would love to do is to build, say a magical telescope that was a memory, a magical

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:51.520
 one, or a real one that would be a memory detector to see selection.

1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:55.280
 So you could get to exoplanets and say that exoplanet looks like there's lots of selection

1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:56.640
 going on there.

1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:58.880
 Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life.

1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:02.000
 So what I'm trying to say is narrow down the regions of space where you say there's

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:06.640
 definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there, or not high assembly because that would

1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:11.400
 be life, but where it's capable of happening.

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:14.400
 And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:18.920
 I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to cells and all the other things.

1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:23.360
 I think you're right, but I think that we just need to get more data.

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:26.360
 Well, I didn't like the thought experiment because I don't like the idea that if the

1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:30.600
 universe has a maximal limit on the amount it can generate per unit time, that our existence

1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:32.640
 is actually precluding the existence of other things.

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:33.640
 I'll just say one thing.

1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:35.680
 But I think that's probably true anyway because of the resource limitations.

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:40.400
 So I don't like your thought experiment because I think it's wrong, but no, no, I do like

1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:41.400
 the thought experiment.

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:44.280
 So what you're trying to say is like there is a chain of events that goes back that's

1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:49.880
 manifestly combated with life on Earth, and you're not saying that life isn't possible

1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:50.880
 elsewhere.

1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:53.800
 You say that there has been these number of contingent things that have happened that

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:56.800
 have allowed life to merge here.

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:00.000
 That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere, but you're saying that the intersection of

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.760
 events may be concentrated here.

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:03.760
 Right?

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:11.280
 And I think that's not exactly, it's more like, you know, if you look at, say the causal

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:15.160
 graphs are fundamental, maybe space is an emergent property, which is consistent with

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:19.280
 some proposals in quantum gravity, but also how we talk about things in assembly theory.

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:24.280
 Then the universe is causal graphs generating more structure in causal graphs, right?

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:26.320
 So this is how the universe is unfolding.

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:31.920
 And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation, like there's only so much stuff that gets

1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:34.760
 made per update of the universe.

1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:38.760
 And then if there's a lot of stuff being made in a particular region that happens to look

1:22:38.760 --> 1:22:44.280
 the same locally, spatially, that's an after effect of the fact that the whole causal graph

1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:45.280
 is updating.

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:46.280
 Like, it's...

1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:49.160
 Yeah, I don't know that.

1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:50.960
 I think that that doesn't work.

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:53.800
 I don't think it works either, but I don't have a good argument in my mind about.

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:57.280
 But I do like the idea of the capacity, the universe, because you've got a number of states.

1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:59.360
 Yeah, we can come back to it.

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:05.880
 Let me ask real quick, like, why does different, like, local pockets of the universe start

1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:07.640
 remembering stuff?

1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:10.600
 How does memory emerge exactly?

1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:16.200
 So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.

1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:22.440
 That's when the physicists were happiest, those low memory objects, which is like ultra

1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:27.280
 low memory objects, which is what the definition of stuff, okay?

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:29.160
 So how does memory emerge?

1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:30.160
 How does...

1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:31.160
 Which is this...

1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:37.560
 How does the temporal stickiness of objects emerge?

1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:43.200
 I'm going to take a very chemo centric point of view, because I can't imagine any other

1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:44.200
 way of doing it.

1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:52.520
 You could think of other ways, maybe, but I would say heterogeneity in matter is where

1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:53.520
 the memory...

1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:58.680
 So you must have enough different ways of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.

1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:05.000
 So what that means is if you've got particles colliding in a box, let's just take some elements

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:10.360
 in a box, those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:15.320
 So there's a combinatorial explosion of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.240
 bonds being made.

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:22.360
 Because there's such a large number, the population of different objects that are possible, this

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:27.280
 goes back to assembly theory where assembly theory, there's four types of universes, right?

1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:29.000
 So you've got basically a...

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.880
 And this is what one was up earlier, where one universe where you've just got everything

1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:37.600
 as possible, so you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything.

1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:43.800
 Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial, where you basically have to

1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:46.080
 accrue information in steps.

1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:49.280
 Then you've got assembly observed, right?

1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:51.560
 And then you've got the object assembly going back.

1:24:51.560 --> 1:24:56.160
 So what I'm trying to say is if you can take atoms and make bonds, let's say you take a

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.200
 nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid, then you add another

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:04.280
 carbon atom on it in a particular configuration, then another one, all different molecules,

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:07.880
 they all represent different histories.

1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:14.080
 So I would say for me right now, the most simple route into life seems to be from recording

1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:16.200
 memories and chemistry.

1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:20.800
 But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways and can't be other emergent effects.

1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:26.360
 But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds, and those molecules can

1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:29.580
 have a causal effect on the future.

1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:34.960
 So imagine a box of atoms, and then you combine those atoms in some way.

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:43.080
 So you make molecule A from load of atoms, and then molecule A can go back to the box

1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:46.240
 and influence the box.

1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:51.280
 Then you make A prime or A B or A B C, and that process keeps going.

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:53.320
 And that's where the memories come from.

1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:56.480
 Is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding?

1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:03.360
 And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.

1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:04.360
 Yeah.

1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:09.200
 So the physicists have no, no, like not enough.

1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:10.200
 Yeah.

1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:19.880
 I mean, they're like desperately begging for more freedom and heterogeneous components

1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:20.880
 to play with.

1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:21.880
 Yeah.

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:22.880
 That's exactly it.

1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:24.720
 What do you think about that, Sarah?

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:28.960
 I mentioned already, I think it's significant that whatever physics governs life emerges

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:30.240
 actually in chemistry.

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:35.160
 It's not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale.

1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:38.120
 It's in, well, atomic scale chemistry.

1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:43.000
 But when you get into this combinatorial diversity that you get from combining things

1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:48.440
 on the periodic table, that's when selection actually matters or the fact that some things

1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:52.200
 can exist and others can't exist actually starts to matter.

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:57.200
 So I think of it like, you don't, you don't study gravity inside the atomic nucleus.

1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:00.880
 You study it in terms of large scale structure of the universe or black holes or things like

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:01.880
 that.

1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:05.520
 And whatever we're talking about as physics of information or physics of assembly becomes

1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:09.320
 relevant at a certain scale of reality.

1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:13.560
 And the transition that you're talking about, I would think of as just when you get a sufficient

1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:20.120
 density in terms of the assembly space of like the relationship of the overlap and the assembly

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:23.320
 space, which is like a feature of common memory.

1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:28.480
 There is this transition to assembly dominated physics, whatever that is.

1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:32.560
 Oh, like when we're talking about, and we're trying to map out exactly what that transition

1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:33.560
 looks like.

1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:37.760
 We're pretty sure, you know, if some of its features, but we haven't done all of that.

1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:41.000
 Do you think if you were there in the early universe, you would have been able to predict

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.320
 the emergence of chemistry and biology?

1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:49.840
 And I ask that because at this stage as humans, do you think we can possibly predict the

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:56.440
 length of memory that's, that might be able to be formed later on in this pocket of the

1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:57.440
 universe?

1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:02.840
 Like how, how complex is a, what is the ceiling of assembly?

1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:06.560
 I think as much time as you have in the past is how much you can predict in the future.

1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:13.800
 Because that is actually physical in the system and you have to have enough time for futures

1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:15.320
 of that structure to exist.

1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:17.280
 Wait, let me push back on that.

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:21.080
 What, isn't there, isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a shortest path

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.520
 that's been, that stretches all the way to the beginning?

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:24.520
 Yeah.

1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:26.160
 That's building some giant monster.

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:27.160
 Right.

1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:28.160
 Maybe, yeah.

1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:29.160
 Yeah.

1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:30.160
 So you can't predict the world.

1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:32.440
 The universe has as much memory as the largest assembly object in the universe.

1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:33.440
 Yeah.

1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:34.440
 Right.

1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:35.440
 But like, so you can't predict.

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:37.360
 You can't predict any deeper than that.

1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:38.360
 No.

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:39.360
 Right.

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:43.560
 So like that, I guess what I'm saying is, like what intuition do you have about complexity

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:49.200
 living in the world that you'd have today, right, because you just, you can, I mean,

1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:54.080
 I guess how long, does it get more fun?

1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:57.960
 Like, isn't there going to be at some point, because there's a heat death in the universe,

1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:04.480
 isn't there going to be a point of the most, of the highest assembly of object with the

1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:06.480
 highest probability being generated?

1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:09.840
 When is the universe going to be the most fun and can we freeze ourselves and then live

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:10.840
 then?

1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:11.840
 Exactly.

1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:16.000
 I know, when you're having the most fun, that this is the best time you're in your

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:19.920
 prime, or you're going to do what everyone does, which is deny that you're in your prime

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:22.000
 and the best years are still ahead of you.

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.280
 I don't know.

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:26.520
 What option do you have?

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:31.320
 I mean, the problem is, there's a lots of really interesting features here.

1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:35.360
 I just want to mention one thing that might be, is I do think assembly theory applies

1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.320
 all the way back to subatomic particles, and I also think that cosmological selection

1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:43.240
 might have been actually, there might have been a, it's not, I would say it's a really

1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:47.720
 boring bit, but it's really important for a cosmologist that universes have gone through.

1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:49.680
 Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?

1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:53.840
 Maybe that there is this, the basic universe evolves, you've got the wrong constants, we'll

1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:58.200
 start again, and the most productive constants where you can allow particles to form in a

1:29:58.200 --> 1:30:01.200
 certain way, propagate to the next universe, we go again.

1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:05.160
 So actually selection goes all the way back, and there's this cycle of universes, and now

1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:11.480
 this universe has been selected because life can occur, and it carries on, but I've really

1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:13.880
 butchered that, there is a much more.

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:19.240
 Some aspect where through the selection process, there's parameters that are being fine tuned

1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:23.840
 and we happen to be living in one where there's some level of fine tuning, is there given

1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:32.720
 that, can you still man the case that we humans are alone in the universe, we are the highest

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:35.000
 assembly index object in the universe?

1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:36.000
 Yeah, I can.

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:37.000
 I guess.

1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:38.000
 Sad though.

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:39.000
 I mean, so from a...

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:40.000
 Is it possible?

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:41.000
 Yes.

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:42.000
 It's possible.

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.600
 Let's assume, well, we know, I mean, it's possible.

1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:48.600
 So let me...

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:55.400
 So, okay, so there is a particular set of elements on Earth in a particular ratio, and the right

1:30:55.400 --> 1:31:02.720
 gravitational constant, and the right viscosity of stuff being at a move around, the right

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:10.880
 distance from our sun, right number of events where we have a moon, the Earth is rotating,

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:14.120
 the late heavy bombardment produced a lot of...

1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:22.360
 Brought in the right stuff, and Mars was cooking up the right molecules first, so it was habitable

1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:30.240
 before Earth, it was actually doing the combinatorial search, and before Mars kind of became unhabitable,

1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:36.400
 it seeded Earth with the right molecular replicators, and there was just the right stuff on Earth,

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:39.640
 and that's how the miracle of life occurred.

1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:47.280
 Although, I find I'm very uncomfortable with that because actually, because life came so

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:55.680
 quickly in the Earth's past, but that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere.

1:31:55.680 --> 1:32:00.480
 It just might mean that the... because chemistry is actually not a long term thing, chemistry

1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:01.480
 can happen quickly.

1:32:01.480 --> 1:32:05.800
 So maybe, going on with the steel manning of the argument to say, actually, the fact

1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:09.920
 that life emerged quickly doesn't mean that life is easy, it just means that the chemistry

1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:15.640
 was right on Earth, and Earth is very special, and that's why there's no life anywhere else

1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:16.640
 in the universe.

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:17.640
 Yeah.

1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:21.760
 So Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:30.680
 So what if that's the reason we're luckies, that we got to have a rare cascading of accelerating

1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:34.600
 cascading effect in terms of the complexity of things.

1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:40.480
 So maybe most of the universe is trying to get sticky with the memory, and it's not able

1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:46.440
 to really form it, and then we got really lucky in that, and there's a lot of Earth conditions,

1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:51.800
 I'd say, but it's just you really, really have to get lucky on this.

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:56.480
 But I'm doing experiments right now, in fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on

1:32:56.480 --> 1:33:00.240
 because we have some joint funding for this, where we're seeing that the universe can get

1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:01.520
 sticky really quickly.

1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:06.160
 Now of course, we're being very anthropocentric, we're using laboratory tools, we're using

1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:14.400
 theory, but actually, the phenomena of selection, the process of developing heterogeneity, we

1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:15.400
 can do in the lab.

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:20.680
 We are seeing the very first hints of it, and wouldn't it be great if we can start to

1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:28.640
 pin down a bit more precisely, becoming good Bayesianists for this, for the origin of life

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:32.840
 and the emergence of life, defining out what kind of chemistries we really need to look

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:33.840
 for.

1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.080
 And I'm becoming increasingly confident we'll be able to do that in the next few years.

1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:43.480
 Make life in the lab, or make some selection in the lab, from inorganic stuff, from sand,

1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:45.600
 from rocks, from dead stuff, from moon.

1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:51.120
 Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon, put it in our origin of life experiment

1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:56.560
 and make moon life, and restrict ourselves to interesting self replicating stuff that

1:33:56.560 --> 1:33:57.560
 we find on the moon.

1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:02.920
 Well, Sarah, what do you think about this approach of engineering life in order to understand

1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:03.920
 life?

1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:05.840
 So building life in the machine?

1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:06.840
 Yeah.

1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:15.760
 I mean, Lee and I are trying right now to build a vision for a large institute or experimental

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:20.440
 program basically to do this problem, but I think of it as like, we need to simulate

1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:21.440
 a planet.

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.080
 So like the Large Hadron Collider was supposed to be simulating conditions just after the

1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:26.080
 Big Bang.

1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:30.200
 Lee's built a lot of technology in his lab to do these kind of selection engines.

1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:35.040
 But the question you're asking is, how many experiments do you need to run?

1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:40.720
 What volume of chemical space do you need to explore before you actually see an event?

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.720
 And I like to make an analogy to one of my favorite particle physics experiments, which

1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:46.640
 is Super Kamiakande that's looking for the decay of the proton.

1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:51.520
 So this is something that we predicted theoretically, but we've never observed in our universe.

1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:55.320
 And basically what they're doing is every time they don't see a proton decay event,

1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:57.800
 they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.

1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:02.960
 So imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind of trying to simulate planetary

1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.480
 conditions, physically simulate.

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.320
 You can't simulate original life in the computer.

1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:08.960
 You have to do it in an experiment.

1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:13.200
 Simulate enough planetary conditions to explore the space of what's possible and bound the

1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:15.160
 probability for an original life event.

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:19.960
 Even if you're not observing it, you can talk about the probability, but we hopefully life

1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:30.880
 is not exponentially rare and we would then be able to evolve in an automated system alien

1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:31.880
 life in the lab.

1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:35.560
 And if we can do that, then we understand the physics as well as we understand what

1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:37.600
 we can do in particle accelerators.

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:44.520
 So keep expanding physically the simulation, the physical simulation until something happens.

1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:48.480
 Yeah, or just build a big enough volume of chemical experiments and evolve them.

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:50.800
 So if they say volume, you mean like literally volume?

1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:54.800
 I mean physical volume in terms of space, but I actually mean volume in terms of the

1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:56.320
 combinatorial space of chemistry.

1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:04.040
 How do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration, the search space, such that it's

1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:07.840
 always like you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit.

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:08.840
 Yeah.

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:10.600
 How do you build a search engine for chemistry?

1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:11.600
 I think it's very well.

1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:12.600
 We should carry on doing this.

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:15.200
 I should pretend the physics be the physicist, you be the chemist.

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:16.200
 No.

1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:22.800
 So the way to do it is I will always play a joke because I like writing grants to ask

1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:29.120
 for money to do cool stuff, but years ago, I started wanting to build.

1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:30.800
 So I actually wanted to do weather.

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:34.360
 So I built this robot in my lab called the computer, which is this robot you can program

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:36.720
 to do chemistry.

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:43.760
 Now I made a programming language for the computer and made it operate chemical equipment.

1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:49.400
 Originally, I wrote grants to say, hey, I want to make an origin of life system.

1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:51.680
 No one would give me any money for this.

1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:53.280
 They said, what is ridiculous?

1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:54.640
 Why are you wanting to make it?

1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:55.640
 It's really hard.

1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:56.640
 It takes forever.

1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:58.520
 You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.

1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:00.560
 Why would we give you any money?

1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:05.640
 And so I turned it around and said, can you instead, can you give me money to make robots,

1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:06.640
 to make molecules?

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:07.640
 Oh, interesting.

1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:10.880
 And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.

1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:16.760
 And that's, so actually the funny thing is the computer project, which I have in my

1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:21.200
 lab, which is very briefly, it's just basically, it's like literally an automated test tube.

1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:25.320
 And we've made a programming language for the test tube, which is cool.

1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:30.160
 Has come as literally came from this, I went to my lab one day and said, I want to make

1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:33.680
 a search engine to get the origin of life because I have a planet.

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.280
 And I thought about doing in a microfluidic format.

1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.000
 So microfluidic is very nano, very small channels in device where you can basically have all

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:44.040
 the pipes produced by lithography.

1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.640
 And you can have a chamber, maybe say between say 10 and 100 microns in volume.

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:53.000
 And we slot them all together like Lego, and we can make an origin of life system.

1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.880
 And I could never get it to work.

1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:01.360
 And I realized I had to make do chemistry at the kind of test tube level.

1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:06.520
 And what you want to be able to do, yeah, it goes back to that tweet, 1981.

1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:10.280
 1981, the computer, we're looking at a tweet for Lee.

1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:15.880
 In 1981, the computer was a distant dream in, oh wow, this is the scientist looking back

1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:19.320
 it is the young boy who dreamed.

1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:27.920
 In 2018, it was realized, spelled in a British way realized, which is the wrong one.

1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:32.120
 So now there's a system that does the physical manifestation or whatever the programming

1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:37.120
 language of the spec tells you to do.

1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.920
 Yeah, well in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.

1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:41.640
 What was the computer?

1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:42.640
 ZX81.

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:43.640
 ZX81.

1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:44.640
 Sinclair ZX81.

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:49.560
 It was, and I got a chemistry set.

1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:54.280
 And I liked the chemistry set, and I liked the computer, and I just wanted to put them

1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:55.280
 together.

1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:59.160
 I thought wouldn't it be cool if I could use the computer to control the chemistry set.

1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:00.760
 And obviously that was insane.

1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:05.440
 And I was like, you know, eight years old, right, nine years old, going on nine years

1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:06.440
 old.

1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:14.600
 And then I invented the computer just because I wanted to build this origin of life, great

1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:19.520
 grid, right, which is like, literally a billion test tubes connected together in real time

1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:24.880
 and real space, basically throwing a chemical dye, dice, throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.

1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:26.600
 You're going to get lucky.

1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:31.720
 And that's what we, I think Sarah and I have been thinking very deeply about, because you

1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:37.600
 know, there's more money being spent on the origin of the gravity or looking at the Higgs

1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:39.680
 boson than the origin of life, right.

1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:45.040
 And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question, or not the biggest question,

1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:46.040
 it is a big question.

1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:47.040
 Let's put it that way.

1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:48.040
 What is the biggest question?

1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:49.040
 You're okay saying that.

1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:50.040
 Okay.

1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:51.040
 All right.

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:56.040
 Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life that that's not going to solve,

1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:00.400
 that's not actually going to solve the question of what is life?

1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:03.440
 Like isn't it, because you're kind of putting a lot of, I don't think so, yeah, I think

1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:04.720
 that's the same problem.

1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:10.960
 Because you're putting, is it possible that you're putting too many, too much bets into

1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:12.240
 this origin part?

1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:16.720
 Maybe the origin thing isn't, isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle, isn't

1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:17.720
 it a stack of turtles?

1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:21.560
 Because then if you create it in the lab, maybe you need some other stuff.

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:24.920
 Well, that's not the thing about the origin.

1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:26.920
 In the lab, there's still memory.

1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:27.920
 Yeah.

1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:28.920
 Yes.

1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:29.920
 Right.

1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:31.680
 The experiment is already at the product of evolution.

1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:32.680
 Right.

1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:36.160
 It's going to be really deep way, not an obvious way, in some very deep way.

1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:42.160
 So maybe the haters are always going to be like, well, you have to reconstruct the fold.

1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:43.160
 You have to build it from scratch.

1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:45.440
 Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware of that argument.

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:47.440
 Well, no, I know, I know.

1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:51.080
 You're the one making that argument usually.

1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:56.720
 I just think that if we create life in the lab, it's not obvious that you'll get to the

1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:02.640
 deep, deep understanding of necessarily, what is the line between life and nonlife?

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:04.160
 No, I think so.

1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:05.160
 There's so much here.

1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:10.000
 I'm just saying, so much here, but let me play doubles back in a previous conversation,

1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.000
 right?

1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.480
 And say, yeah, I will.

1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:15.480
 Why not?

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:16.480
 Why not?

1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:17.480
 I've got time.

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:18.480
 Seller Automata.

1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:19.480
 Yes.

1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:24.920
 Seller Automata, these very, very simple things where you color squares, black or white and

1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:29.800
 implement rules and play them in time, and you can get these very, very complex patterns

1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:30.800
 coming out.

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:35.200
 You know, there's nice rules, there are Turing complete rules.

1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:41.640
 And I would argue that Seller Automata don't really exist on their own.

1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:45.160
 They have to exist in a computing device.

1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:48.080
 If that, whether it's computing devices, a piece of paper, an abstraction, a mathematician

1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:53.720
 drawing a grid, or a framework.

1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:59.200
 Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things, simple, going complex, but the complexity

1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:02.480
 is all borrowed from the lithography, the numbers.

1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:03.480
 Right.

1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:11.240
 Now, let's take that same argument with the chemistry experiment origin of life.

1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.240
 What you need to be able to do is go out, and I'm inspired to do this, to go out and

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:17.800
 look for CAs occur in nature.

1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:24.880
 You know, let's kind of, let's find some CAs that just emerge in our universe and...

1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:29.440
 For people just to start to interrupt, for people just listening, and in general, I think

1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:35.720
 what we're looking at is a Seller Automata, where again, as we described, there is just

1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:41.640
 binary black or white squares, and they only have local information, and they're born,

1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:42.880
 and they die.

1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:46.520
 And you would think nothing interesting would emerge, but actually what we're looking at

1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:54.560
 is something that I believe is called glider guns, or a glider gun, which is moving objects

1:42:54.560 --> 1:43:01.280
 in this multi cell space that look like they're organisms that have much more information,

1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.720
 that have much more complexity than the individual building components, in fact, look like they

1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:13.040
 have a long term memory, while the individual components don't seem like they have any memory

1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:14.040
 at all.

1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:15.040
 Yes.

1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:16.040
 Which is fascinating.

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:20.280
 The argument here is that has to exist on all this layer of infrastructure, right, and

1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:21.720
 though it looks simple.

1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:25.680
 And then what I would make, I would make a value, say, well, I think CAs are really

1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:29.680
 simple and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge and substrate.

1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:34.440
 Now let's go to the origin of life, machine, I don't think we want to do the origin of

1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:36.600
 life, just any origin is good.

1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:41.840
 So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker, shake the sand, like massive grid of chemistry

1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:45.400
 experiments, shaking sand, shaking whatever.

1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:48.640
 And then because we know what we've put in, so we know where, how we've cheated, and the

1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:51.920
 same way with CA, we know how we've cheated, we know what the, we know the number of operations

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:54.720
 needed, we know how big a grid we want to get this.

1:43:54.720 --> 1:44:03.680
 If we could then say, okay, how can we generate this recipe in the lab and make a life form?

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.280
 What were the, what contingency did we need to put in?

1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:12.160
 And we're upfront about how we cheated, okay, say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic

1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:15.880
 planet rotates, it's tried, comes in and out.

1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:21.560
 So and then we can start to basically say, okay, how difficult is it for these features

1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:23.320
 to be found?

1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:25.360
 And then we can look for exoplanets and other features.

1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:27.520
 So I think Sarah's absolutely right.

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:29.360
 We want to explain to people we're cheating.

1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:30.800
 In fact, we have to cheat.

1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:34.000
 No one has given, I'm good at writing grants, I used to be, I'm not very good right now,

1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.480
 I keep getting rejected, but I writing a grant for a planet in 100 million years, no grant

1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:39.960
 fund there is going to give me that.

1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:46.080
 But maybe money to make a kind of a grid, a computer grid, origin of life, computer

1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:47.080
 grid.

1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:48.080
 In physical space.

1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:49.080
 In physical space.

1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:50.080
 And just do it.

1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:56.400
 So Sarah said something, which is you can't simulate the origin of life in a computer.

1:44:56.400 --> 1:44:59.760
 So like in simulation, why not?

1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:02.520
 What were your, you said it very confidently.

1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:05.200
 So is it possible?

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:06.720
 And why would it be very difficult?

1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:08.880
 Like what's your intuition there?

1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:13.240
 I think it's very difficult right now because we don't know the physics.

1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:17.280
 But if you go based on principles of assembly theory and you think every molecule is actually

1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:21.480
 a very large causal graph, not just the molecule, then you have to simulate all the features

1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:22.680
 of those causal graphs.

1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:24.880
 And I think it becomes computationally intractable.

1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:27.160
 You might as well just build the experiment.

1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:31.880
 Because you have in the physical space, you have all the objects with all the memories.

1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:32.880
 Yes.

1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:36.080
 And in the computer, you would have to copy them reconstruct.

1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:37.080
 Yes.

1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:43.320
 That's a beautifully put, and I would say that lots of people, you just don't have enough

1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:45.320
 resources.

1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:50.440
 It's easier to actually do the physical experiment because we are literally, I would view the

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:53.640
 physical experiment almost like a computational experiment.

1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:58.960
 We're just outsourcing, it's just basically we're just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.

1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:04.760
 On your point about the experiment being also an example of life, it's almost like you want

1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:05.760
 to design.

1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:10.840
 You know, all of us are lineages of propagating information across time, and so everything

1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:14.240
 we do becomes part of life because it's part of that causal chain.

1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:17.840
 So it's like you want to try to pinch off as much as you can of the information from

1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:22.240
 your causal chain that goes into the experiment, but you can't pinch off all of it to move

1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:23.760
 it to like a different timeline.

1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:25.360
 It's always going to be part of your timeline.

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:29.120
 But at least if you can control how much information you put in, you can try to see how much does

1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:33.960
 that particular trajectory you set up start generating its own assembly.

1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:38.760
 So you know where it starts and then you want to try to see it take off on its own when

1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:42.360
 you've tried to pinch it off as much as possible.

1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:43.840
 Got it.

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:44.840
 Quick pause.

1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:45.840
 Bath and break.

1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:46.840
 Yes.

1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:47.840
 All right.

1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:48.840
 Cool.

1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:49.840
 And now we're back.

1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:51.040
 All right.

1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:56.080
 We talked about the early days of the universe when there was just stuff and no memory, not

1:46:56.080 --> 1:46:57.080
 even causality.

1:46:57.080 --> 1:47:00.640
 I think Lee at least implied the causality is emergent somehow.

1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:02.040
 We could discuss this.

1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:07.520
 What happened before this all originated?

1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:09.520
 What's outside the universe?

1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:11.520
 2.5 by 0.

1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:12.520
 Okay.

1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:16.440
 So it's not relevant, not understandable.

1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:18.720
 Is it useful to even ask the question?

1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:19.720
 No.

1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:22.040
 Just because it's so hard?

1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:23.040
 No.

1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:24.040
 It's not hard.

1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:25.040
 It's just not a question.

1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:28.840
 If I can't do an experiment or even think of an experiment, the question doesn't exist.

1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:32.440
 Well, no, you can't think of a lot of experiments.

1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:33.440
 No offense.

1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:39.160
 What I mean is because your causality graph is like, this is what we've been talking about.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:45.680
 It's like there is limits to your ability to construct experiments.

1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:46.680
 I agree.

1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:51.920
 But I was trying to be facetious and I'll try to make a point because I think that if

1:47:51.920 --> 1:48:00.240
 there is a causal bottleneck through which information can't propagate in principle,

1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:05.400
 then it's very hard to think of an experiment, even in principle, even one that's beyond

1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:09.440
 my mediocre intellect, which is fine.

1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:11.040
 I'm happy to accept that.

1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:14.720
 But this is one of the things I actually do think there was something before the Big Bang

1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:19.800
 because I would say that I think the Big Bang just couldn't occur and create time.

1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:21.440
 Time created the Big Bang.

1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:23.560
 There was time before the Big Bang.

1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:24.560
 Yeah.

1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:26.560
 There was no space for those time.

1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:27.560
 Yeah.

1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:28.560
 Yeah.

1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:31.360
 I mean, I'm just making that stuff up just to make all the physicists happy, but I think

1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:32.360
 it's...

1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:35.920
 Do you think that would make them happy because they would be quite upset, actually?

1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:37.320
 Why would they be upset?

1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:41.760
 Because they would say that time can't exist before the Big Bang.

1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:42.760
 Yeah.

1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:46.800
 I mean, this goes back to an argument that you might not want to have the argument here.

1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:50.480
 I was talking to Sarah earlier today about an argument we had about time a long time

1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:51.480
 ago.

1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:52.480
 Yeah.

1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:53.480
 Long time and time.

1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:54.480
 And what I would...

1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:57.280
 It's like, I think there is this thing called time or state creation.

1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:02.200
 The universe is creating states and it's outside of space, but they create space.

1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:06.320
 So what I mean is you can imagine there are states being created all the time and there

1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:08.600
 is this thing called time.

1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:13.880
 Time is a clock, which you can use to measure when things happen, but that doesn't mean

1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:17.400
 because you can't measure something that states aren't being created.

1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:25.840
 And so you might locally refer to the Big Bang and the Big Bang occurred at some point

1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:27.840
 when those states were there.

1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:32.600
 Probably there had to be enough states for the Big Bang to occur.

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:36.560
 But I think that there is something wrong with our conception of how the universe was

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:41.080
 created and the Big Bang because we don't really get time.

1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:47.280
 Because again, I don't want to become boring and sound like a broken record, but time

1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:49.120
 is a real thing.

1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:54.960
 And until I can really explain that more elegantly, I'm just going to get into more trouble.

1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:59.520
 We're going to talk about time because time is a useful measure in device for experiments,

1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:01.400
 but also time is an idea.

1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:02.400
 Okay.

1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:05.000
 But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think?

1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:08.800
 Is it a useful question to ask what happened before the Big Bang?

1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:15.120
 Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:20.440
 So I would think about it as the Big Bang is an event that we reconstructed as probably

1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:24.400
 happening in the past of our universe based on current observational data.

1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:33.160
 And so the way I like to think about it is we exist locally in something called the universe.

1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:37.960
 So in going back to the physics of existence, we exist locally in the space of all things

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.320
 that could exist.

1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:43.360
 And we can infer certain properties of the structure of where we exist locally.

1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:50.120
 And one of the properties that we've inferred in the past is that there is a thing we call

1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:51.120
 the Big Bang.

1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:58.560
 There's some signatures of our local environment that indicate that there was a very low information

1:50:58.560 --> 1:50:59.840
 event that started our universe.

1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:05.200
 I think that's actually just an artifact of the structure of the assembly space that

1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:11.840
 when you start losing all the memory in the objects, it looks like what we call a Big

1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:13.440
 Bang.

1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:16.280
 So I think it makes sense to talk about where you are locally.

1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:21.200
 I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities, what could exist outside the

1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:25.600
 universe in the sense that they become part of our reasoning and therefore part of our

1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:28.640
 causal chain of things that we can do.

1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:33.800
 So like the multiverse in my mind exists, but it doesn't exist as a multiverse of possible

1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:34.800
 universes.

1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:38.600
 It exists as an idea in our minds that allows us to reason about how physics works and then

1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:42.200
 to do physics differently because we reason about it that way.

1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:48.400
 So I always like to recenter it on things exist, but they don't always exist like we

1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:50.520
 think they exist.

1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:54.240
 So when we're thinking about things outside the universe, they absolutely exist because

1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:59.840
 we're thinking about them, but they don't look like the projections in our minds.

1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:00.840
 There's something else.

1:52:00.840 --> 1:52:04.760
 And something you said just gave an idea to go back to your question.

1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:10.920
 If there was, I mean, if something caused the Big Bang, if there was some memory or

1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.200
 some artifact of that, then of course it's, to answer your question, it's worth going

1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:19.760
 back to that because that would imply there is something beyond that barrier, that filter.

1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:21.240
 And that's what you were saying, I guess.

1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:22.240
 Right.

1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:23.800
 I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe.

1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:26.840
 I just don't think that, like I think the most interesting things for us to be doing

1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:32.720
 are finding explanations that allow us to do more like that optimism.

1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:38.080
 So I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask as being scientific ones because I find

1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:42.880
 that that's where the most creative potential is to impact the future trajectory of what

1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:43.880
 we're doing on this planet.

1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:48.600
 It's interesting to think about the Big Bang is basically from our current perspective

1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:53.040
 of what we're able to detect, it's the time when things were forgotten.

1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:54.040
 Yes.

1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:58.600
 It's the time the reset from our limited perspective.

1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:05.320
 And so the question is, is it useful to ever study the thing that was forgotten or should

1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:08.240
 we focus just on the memories that are still there?

1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:11.400
 Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment is I was trying to say both

1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:12.400
 things.

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:16.200
 And I think perhaps, yes, from the pot following point of view, if you could then imagine what

1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:20.920
 was forgotten and then work forwards, you will have different consequences.

1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:22.720
 So then it becomes testable.

1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:26.840
 So as long as we can find tests, and it's definitely worth thinking about, what I don't

1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:31.280
 like is when physicists say, what happened before the Big Bang and before, before, before,

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:38.320
 without giving me any credible conjecture about what we would, how would we know the difference?

1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:39.680
 But the way you framed it is quite nice.

1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:40.680
 I like that.

1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:43.640
 It's like, what have we forgotten?

1:53:43.640 --> 1:53:47.920
 Is there a room for God in assembly theory?

1:53:47.920 --> 1:53:48.920
 Who's God?

1:53:48.920 --> 1:53:52.240
 I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.

1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:54.560
 Well, I think I said it earlier.

1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:55.560
 What's a necessary being?

1:53:55.560 --> 1:53:57.200
 It has to exist.

1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:01.200
 Oh, so you like, I mean, you like the shortest path.

1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:02.200
 Like does God need?

1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:03.200
 No, no, no.

1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:08.320
 I mean, I, well, you can go back to like Thomas Aquinas and arguments for the existence of

1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:09.320
 God.

1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:13.680
 But I think, I think most of the interesting theological arguments are always about whether

1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:17.280
 something has to exist or there was a first thing that had exist.

1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:20.000
 But I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those kind of arguments.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:29.440
 Well, so God here meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff.

1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:32.760
 But God, so what I was trying to say earlier, isn't that just the universe?

1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:33.760
 Yeah.

1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:34.760
 Well, yeah.

1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:39.400
 Well, but I, there's a difference between, I said, I imagine like a black box, like a

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.400
 machine.

1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:41.400
 Yeah.

1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:45.240
 That's, then I would be more comfortable calling that God because it's a machine.

1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.360
 You go into a room and there's a thing with a button.

1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:48.360
 Yeah.

1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:50.160
 It's a great programmer in the sky version.

1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:51.160
 Yeah.

1:54:51.160 --> 1:55:00.000
 But if it's more kind of like, I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,

1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:06.360
 if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God that generates a bunch of stuff.

1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:13.800
 But if there's a machine like that does, that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,

1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:19.280
 then that feels like God, that other sort of, in terms of terminology.

1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:23.400
 So I wonder if there's like a machine that's required to generate this universe.

1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:26.920
 That's very sort of important for running this in the lab.

1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:30.840
 So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier that I can't remember the phrase,

1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:34.440
 but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe?

1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:35.440
 Yes.

1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:37.120
 Where does God exist?

1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:43.720
 God at least exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly people who have religious

1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:45.240
 faith they believe in.

1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:49.280
 But let's then take your, but you're talking a little bit more about generics, say, well,

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.880
 is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God?

1:55:51.880 --> 1:56:00.200
 I would say God did not exist at the beginning, but he or she does now, because I'm saying

1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:01.200
 the mechanism.

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:03.600
 Well, you don't know that he didn't exist in the beginning.

1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:11.360
 So like, this could be us in our minds trying to just listen to gravitational waves, detecting

1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:16.800
 gravitational waves, it's the same thing as us trying to go back further and further

1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:22.960
 into our memories, to try to understand the machines that make up, that make up us.

1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:30.240
 And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of, what kind of machines

1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:37.600
 could create, there's always a tweet, there's always a tweet, the universe is a computer

1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.240
 then God must have built it, computers need creators.

1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:43.360
 There you go.

1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:49.640
 And then Yosha Bach replied, since there's something rather than nothing, perhaps existence

1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:52.440
 is the default.

1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:59.040
 If existence is the default, the many computers exist, creator gods are necessary computers,

1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:00.640
 unnecessarily computers too.

1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:01.960
 I'm very confused by that.

1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:05.760
 But that's an interesting idea that existence is the default versus non existence.

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:07.880
 I agree with that, but the rest is...

1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:12.840
 He responds, perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.

1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:16.440
 That's how scientists talk trash each other on Twitter apparently.

1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:18.840
 Which part don't you agree with?

1:57:18.840 --> 1:57:22.160
 When he said if existence is the default, then many computers exist.

1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:26.280
 This comes back to the inventor and discovery argument.

1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:32.000
 I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable of computation because there

1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.920
 wasn't enough technology, enough states.

1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:40.720
 So what you're saying is, if God is a mechanism, so I might actually agree.

1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:44.560
 But then the thing is, lots of people see God is more than a mechanism.

1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:49.240
 For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory that creates all the stuff in the memories

1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:50.240
 we know.

1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:54.040
 And the fact that we can even relate to each other is because we have the same, we share

1:57:54.040 --> 1:58:02.120
 that heritage and why we love each other or we like to see God in each other is it's just...

1:58:02.120 --> 1:58:04.840
 We know we have a shared existence.

1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:09.280
 So if the God is the mechanism that created this whole thing, I think a lot of people

1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:16.640
 see God in a religious sense as that mechanism also being able to communicate with the objects

1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:18.360
 it creates.

1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:23.640
 And if it's just the mechanism, we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates.

1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:24.640
 It can only create.

1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:28.600
 It can't interact with the...

1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:32.320
 Well, there's versions of God that create the universe and then left.

1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:35.440
 Yeah, like spark.

1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:36.440
 For some religions, but...

1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:37.440
 The first spark.

1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:38.440
 Yeah.

1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:42.440
 But I think I liked your analogy of the machine and the rules, right?

1:58:42.440 --> 1:58:49.920
 But I think part of the problem is, I mean, we have this conception that we can disentangle

1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:51.880
 the rules from the physical substrate, right?

1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:55.200
 And that's the whole thing about software and hardware being separate or the way Newton

1:58:55.200 --> 1:58:57.360
 wrote his laws, that there was some...

1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:00.200
 They exist outside the universe, they're not actually a feature of the universe, they don't

1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:03.160
 have to merge out of the universe itself.

1:59:03.160 --> 1:59:08.600
 So I think if you merged your two views, then it gets back to the God as the universe.

1:59:08.600 --> 1:59:13.240
 And then I think the deeper question is, why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?

1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:18.000
 And if I think about the features of the universe that give it the most meaning and purpose,

1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.080
 those are what we would call the living components of the universe.

1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:25.440
 So if you wanted to say, God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an

1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:30.520
 emergent property of our minds, but I would just say the way the universe creates meaning

1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:32.920
 and purpose, there is really a physics there.

1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:39.200
 It's not like a illusory thing, and that is just what the physics of life is.

1:59:39.200 --> 1:59:47.080
 Is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?

1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:52.600
 So basically, whatever God is that mechanism, we just leave parts of that behind.

1:59:52.600 --> 1:59:54.760
 But the universe is constantly generating itself.

1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:59.280
 So if God is that mechanism, it would be that that would still be acted today.

1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:06.600
 I'm agnostic, but if I would call the things I believe in God in the way that some people

2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:12.320
 talk about God, I would say that God is in the universe now.

2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:16.360
 It's not an absent thing.

2:00:16.360 --> 2:00:25.000
 So I think there's a mislabeling here, because you're, I mean, I'm a professional idiot,

2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:26.000
 actually.

2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:30.000
 You should put that on your CV.

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:31.000
 Professionally.

2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:34.840
 Not recreationally or amateur, but professionally.

2:00:34.840 --> 2:00:39.800
 I think I would say if you were talking about God, I mean, again, I'm way out, way out my

2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:45.080
 depth and I almost feel uncomfortable, but I'll try.

2:00:45.080 --> 2:00:49.160
 For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness, a reasoning entity that

2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:55.240
 actually has causal power and you're human like intelligence.

2:00:55.240 --> 2:00:58.720
 And so you're like, then you're saying like gravity could be God or time could be God.

2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:04.720
 I mean, I think for me, for my conception of time is probably as fundamental as God,

2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:08.920
 because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness in which we can have this

2:01:08.920 --> 2:01:12.120
 abstract notion of God.

2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:18.440
 So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very mechanistic, kind of unsophisticated

2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:23.000
 sense, whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated and got all this feelings

2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:27.160
 and love and this abstracting ability.

2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:29.480
 So is that what, or do you mean that?

2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:36.200
 Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that decided to flick the universe into existence?

2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:44.840
 Well, one of the features that God would have is the ability to flick the universe into

2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:49.200
 existence, like Windows 95.

2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:53.480
 I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP or Windows 10.

2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:55.760
 I don't know the full feature set.

2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:00.080
 So at the very least, you have to flick the universe into existence.

2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:06.600
 And then other features might include ability to interact with that universe in interesting

2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:07.800
 ways.

2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:11.760
 And then how do you interact with the universe in interesting ways?

2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:15.320
 You have to be able to speak the language of its different components.

2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:25.000
 So in order to interact with humans, you have to know how to act human like.

2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:37.240
 So I don't know, but it seems like whatever mechanism created the universe might want

2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:45.280
 to also generate local pockets of mechanisms that can interact with that, like inject.

2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:46.280
 God was lonely?

2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:47.280
 Yeah.

2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:48.280
 It was lonely.

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:51.680
 I mean, it could be just a teenager and another just playing a video game.

2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:52.680
 Yeah, maybe.

2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:57.400
 I mean, I don't, so this is referring to our origin of life engine.

2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:01.200
 It's like, I don't believe in God, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be one.

2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:02.200
 Right.

2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:05.840
 Because I want to make a universe and make a life form, but that maybe that may be rude

2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:08.680
 to people who have, you know, dear religious beliefs.

2:03:08.680 --> 2:03:16.720
 What I mean by that is if we are able to create an entirely new life form, different chemistry,

2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:22.080
 different culture, what does it make up and makes us, by that definition, it makes us

2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:23.080
 goats, right?

2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:24.080
 Well, there is.

2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:28.200
 I mean, like when you have children, you're like one of the magical things of that is

2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:29.560
 your kind of mini gods.

2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:34.960
 I mean, first of all, from a child's perspective, parents are gods for quite a while.

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:39.520
 And then, I mean, in the positive sense, there's a magic to that.

2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:43.640
 That's why I love robotics is you instill life into something.

2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:50.120
 And that makes you feel God like in a sort of positive way.

2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:51.920
 Being a creator is a positive thing.

2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:52.920
 Yeah.

2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:53.920
 Yeah, exactly.

2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:54.920
 And a small scale.

2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:59.600
 And then goddess would be a creator at the largest possible scale, I suppose.

2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:00.720
 Okay.

2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:05.520
 You mentioned offline the assembled Tron.

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:06.520
 Assembly Tron.

2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:07.520
 Assembly Tron.

2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:08.520
 Yep.

2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:09.600
 What's an assembly Tron?

2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:13.000
 These are the, this is an early idea of something you're thinking about.

2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:19.520
 So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team are interested in using AI to understand life.

2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:24.800
 My team is, and I'm, and I'm wondering if we could apply the principles of assembly

2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:30.920
 theory that is the causal structure that you get with assembly theory and hybridize it

2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:34.720
 and make a new type of neuron, if you like.

2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:39.800
 I mean, there are causal neural networks out there, but they are, they are not quite the

2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:41.840
 architecture like what I would like.

2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:48.160
 I would like to associate memory bits with, basically, I'd like to make a, rather than

2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:53.920
 having an ASIC for neural networks, I want to make an ASIC for assembly networks.

2:04:53.920 --> 2:04:54.920
 Right.

2:04:54.920 --> 2:04:59.280
 And so can you say that again, assembly networks?

2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:06.400
 So what, what is a sort of like a thing with an input and an output and it's like a neural

2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:07.600
 network type of thing.

2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:08.600
 What does it do exactly?

2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:09.600
 What's the input?

2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:10.600
 What's the output?

2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:13.960
 So in this case, so if you're talking about a general neural network, I mean, in general

2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:19.760
 neural network, you can train it on also any sort of data, right, depending on the, the

2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:26.040
 framework, whether it's like text or, or image data or whatnot.

2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:27.040
 And that's fine.

2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:31.400
 But there's no causal structure associated with that data.

2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:35.160
 Now just imagine, rather than, you know, let's say we're in a classifier difference between

2:05:35.160 --> 2:05:38.200
 cat and the dog, right, classic cat and dog neural network.

2:05:38.200 --> 2:05:43.800
 What about if the system understood the assembly space to create the cat and the dog?

2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:50.120
 And rather than guessing what was happening and training on those images and not understanding

2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:57.600
 those features, it, it, you almost like you could imagine doing a, going back a step and

2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:01.880
 doing an, an, and training, going back a step and doing the training, going back a step,

2:06:01.880 --> 2:06:03.440
 back a step, back a step.

2:06:03.440 --> 2:06:09.120
 And I wonder if that is actually the origin of intelligence or how we'll crack intelligence.

2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:16.320
 Because we need to, because we'll, we'll create the entire graph of events and, and be able

2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:19.080
 to kind of look at cause and effect across those graphs.

2:06:19.080 --> 2:06:22.640
 I'm explaining it really badly, but it's a, it's a gene of an idea.

2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:28.440
 And I'm guessing very smart, very rich people in AI are already doing this.

2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:34.440
 Oh, trying to not generate cats and dogs, but trying to generate things of high assembly

2:06:34.440 --> 2:06:35.440
 index.

2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:36.440
 Yeah.

2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:41.840
 And, and, and, and also using causal graphs in neural networks and machine learning and

2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:44.280
 deep learning, maybe building a new architecture.

2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:48.840
 I'm just wondering, is there something we can get our assembly theory allows us to rebuild

2:06:48.840 --> 2:06:54.880
 current machine learning architectures to give more, give causation more cheaply.

2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:58.320
 I mean, I don't know if that's what you're, we've been inventing this for a little while,

2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:01.560
 but we're trying to finish the theory paper first before we do anything else.

2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:02.560
 Yeah.

2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:07.960
 We have, say, goal directed behavior in neural networks, then assembly theory is a good framework

2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:08.960
 for doing that.

2:07:08.960 --> 2:07:09.960
 Daniel's been thinking about that a lot.

2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:10.960
 Yeah.

2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:15.240
 And I think it's a really interesting idea that you can map concepts from how neural

2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:20.200
 networks learn to think about goal directed behavior as a learning process, that you're

2:07:20.200 --> 2:07:23.560
 learning a specific goal, the universe is learning a goal when it generates a particular

2:07:23.560 --> 2:07:27.240
 structure and that you can map that physical structure into a neural network.

2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:30.800
 How, what's the goal?

2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:38.640
 Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal in, in biology, I mean, you know,

2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:41.920
 people are not supposed to use teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,

2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:46.960
 but because goals are real things, they're just post selected.

2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:52.840
 So you can talk about goals after the fact, you know, once a goal emerges in the universe,

2:07:52.840 --> 2:07:55.240
 that physical entity has a goal.

2:07:55.240 --> 2:08:00.600
 But Lee and I came up with a test for, like a Turing test for goal directed behavior based

2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:04.200
 on the idea of assembly, like we have to formalize it still, but I would like to write a paper

2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:05.200
 on it.

2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:09.880
 But like the basic idea is like if you, like if you had two systems that were completely

2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:16.400
 equivalent, you know, like in the instantaneous, like physical experimental setup, so we have

2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:18.320
 to figure out how to do this.

2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:21.880
 But there was something that would be different in their future.

2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:25.360
 And there was a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility,

2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:30.040
 that future outcome, then you could say that that system had some representation of some

2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:33.600
 kind of goal in mind about what it wanted to do in the future.

2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:38.840
 And so goals are interesting because they don't exist as instantaneous things.

2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:43.200
 They exist across time, which is one of the reasons that assembly theories may be more

2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:48.240
 naturally able to account for the existence of goals.

2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:57.200
 So goals are the only existent time, or they manifest themselves in time through, you said

2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:58.680
 symmetry breaking.

2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:05.640
 So it's almost like imagine, like if representations in your mind are real, right?

2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:11.160
 And you can imagine future possibilities, but imagine everything else is physically equivalent.

2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:15.520
 And the only thing that you actually change your decision based on is what you model as

2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:17.520
 being the future outcome.

2:09:17.520 --> 2:09:21.800
 Then somehow that representation in your mind of the future outcome becomes causal to what

2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:22.800
 you're doing now.

2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:26.000
 So it's kind of like retro causal effect, but it's not actually retro causal.

2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:32.360
 It's just that your assembly space actually includes those possibilities as part of the

2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:33.360
 structure.

2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:35.800
 It's just you're not observing all the features of the assembly space in the current moment.

2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:42.240
 Well, the possibilities exist, but they don't become a goal until they realize.

2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:46.760
 So one of the features of assembly space that's super interesting, and it's easier to envision

2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:51.680
 with Legos, for example, is if you're thinking about an assembly space, you can't observe

2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:54.080
 the entire assembly space in any instant in time.

2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:57.720
 So if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you want to look at the assembly space of a stack

2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:03.120
 of Legos, you have to break the Legos apart, and then you look at all the possible ways

2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:05.640
 of building up the original object.

2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.360
 So now you have in your mind the goal of building that object, and you have all the possible

2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:13.920
 ways of doing it, and those are actual physical features of that object, but that object doesn't

2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:14.920
 always exist.

2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:17.720
 What exists is the possibility of generating it.

2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:19.720
 And the possibilities are always infinite.

2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:24.640
 Well, for that particular object, you know, like, you know, it has a well defined assembly

2:10:24.640 --> 2:10:25.640
 space.

2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:29.680
 And I guess what I'm saying is that object is the assembly space, but you actually have

2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:33.400
 to unpack that object across time to view that feature of it.

2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:35.240
 It's only an observable across time.

2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:42.120
 The term goal is such a important and difficult to explain concept, right?

2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:47.040
 Because what you want is a way is like, I think only conscious beings can have conscious

2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:49.600
 goals.

2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:51.920
 Something else is doing selection.

2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:57.360
 But selection does invent goals, and in a way that the way that biology reinterprets

2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:04.720
 the past in the present is kind of helps you to understand there was a goal in the past

2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:05.720
 now, right?

2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:09.440
 It's kind of like goals only exist back in time.

2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:17.160
 So first of all, only conscious beings can have conscious goals.

2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:19.480
 I'm not even going to touch that one.

2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:20.480
 Why?

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:22.480
 Go for it.

2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:23.480
 Come on.

2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:29.200
 The line between conscious goals and non conscious goals, exactly.

2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:36.720
 And also maybe just on top of that, you said a touring test for goal directed behavior.

2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:39.160
 What does a touring test potentially look like?

2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:40.920
 So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this.

2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:43.880
 So we actually got some funding to work together on two teams.

2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:47.800
 So I'm trying to do, and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory.

2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:49.760
 And Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory.

2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:52.560
 And Sarah is trying to design experiments, and I'm teaching experiments, because I think

2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:58.480
 it's really good for us to have that to say, when would a, so that's good.

2:11:58.480 --> 2:11:59.480
 I like this.

2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:01.280
 I'm sure we use the Dan Dennett essay.

2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:02.280
 Yeah.

2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:05.520
 And I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a touring test after, but yeah.

2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:11.520
 So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and free will inflation.

2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:12.520
 Love the title.

2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:13.520
 The title is so brilliant.

2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:14.760
 I think that's the actual title.

2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:15.760
 I think so.

2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:18.040
 Rooting cats and free will inflation.

2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:19.040
 Yeah.

2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:20.040
 Something like that.

2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:21.040
 I mean, it's not maybe not.

2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:22.040
 And so, no, I think that's right.

2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:25.160
 So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hill side.

2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:26.160
 Okay.

2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:28.280
 And it just happens to be a snowy hill.

2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:33.120
 And let's just say you see an object go rolling down the hill, or you, you, you, you, and

2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:36.800
 the rock, or go rolls down the hill, but the start goes to the end.

2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:38.040
 How do you know objects had a goal?

2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:41.880
 Now you unveil the object and you'll see it's actually a skier.

2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:44.640
 And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom.

2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:45.640
 Great.

2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:48.840
 And then you look at the rock, rock roll down the hill, gets the bottom.

2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:51.320
 How can you tell the difference between the two?

2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:57.120
 So and what Dan says is like, well, this is clear, the skiers in control and the, and

2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:00.320
 because they're adjusting trajectory system updating going on.

2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.200
 Then the only way you can really do that is you have to put the skier back to the top

2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:04.200
 of the hill again.

2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:08.920
 They tend to start roughly in the same space and probably go to take all that complex set

2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:12.080
 of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right?

2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:17.040
 Plus or minus few meters, whereas if it's just a random rock going down to random trajectory,

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:18.320
 that wouldn't happen.

2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:22.440
 And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing when we were writing this grant, we were like,

2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:29.320
 we need to somehow instantiate the skier and the rock in the experiment and then say, okay,

2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:34.400
 when is the object, when it, so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update,

2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:40.280
 has to have some sensing and some kind of, you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to

2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:42.820
 the environment.

2:13:42.820 --> 2:13:44.320
 And then we just have to iterate on that.

2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:46.960
 And maybe Sarah, you can influence the cheering test part.

2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:50.040
 Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was slightly different.

2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:54.640
 So I get really frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most people do.

2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:58.920
 You know, a lot of people are, which is not necessarily related to, to free will directly

2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:01.120
 or to this goal directed behavior.

2:14:01.120 --> 2:14:04.880
 But I think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics here.

2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:10.440
 I think for me, I was, you know, everybody's always interested in explaining intrinsic experience

2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:12.440
 and quantifying intrinsic experience.

2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:16.560
 And there's all sorts of problems with that because you can never actually be another

2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:17.560
 physical system.

2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:20.520
 So you can't know what it's like to be another physical system.

2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:24.760
 So I always thought there must be some way of getting at this problem about if an agent

2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:28.960
 or an entity is conscious or at least has internal representations.

2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:34.760
 And those are real physical things that there, it must have causal consequences.

2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:40.880
 So the way I would ask the question of consciousness is not, you know, what it, is it like intrinsically?

2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:45.200
 But if, if things have intrinsic experience, is there any observable difference from the

2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:50.560
 outside about the, the kind of causation that that physical system would enact in?

2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:53.880
 And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do is have imaginations.

2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:57.480
 So like we can imagine rockets centuries before we build them.

2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:00.760
 They've become real physical things because we imagine them.

2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:03.760
 And people might disentangle that from conscious experience, but I think a lot of the sort

2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:07.080
 of imagination we do is actually a conscious process.

2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:13.120
 So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems, and I said, one had an

2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:17.880
 internal representation, which is slightly different than a conscious experience, obviously.

2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:22.440
 So I'm entangling some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought experiments.

2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:28.600
 Then how, and I, and I set them up in a physically equivalent situation.

2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:34.840
 Could it be the case that there would be experimental observables associated with it?

2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:39.680
 And that, that became the idea of trying to actually measure for internal representation

2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:40.680
 of consciousness.

2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:42.440
 So Turing basically didn't want to do that.

2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:46.120
 You just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior, but

2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:51.240
 never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that.

2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:56.000
 And I guess I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually

2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:57.800
 test for that?

2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:01.040
 Or your imagination that led to the...

2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:06.520
 That there was something internal going on, some kind of inner world, as people say,

2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:10.080
 or you could say, it actually is an agent.

2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:11.440
 It's making decisions.

2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:14.040
 It has an internal representation.

2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:18.040
 And whether you say that's experience or not is a different thing, but at least the feature

2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:22.600
 that there's some abstraction it's doing, that's not obvious from looking at the physical

2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:23.600
 substrates.

2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:25.360
 Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing?

2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:30.720
 One of the compelling things about the Turing test is that defining intelligence, defining

2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:38.960
 any complicated concept as a thing like observing it from the surface and not caring about what's

2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:42.840
 going on deep inside because how do you know...

2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:43.840
 That's the point.

2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:45.080
 So the idea is exactly that.

2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:50.120
 So what we're trying to do, the Turing test for goal directiveness is literally take some

2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:53.920
 objects that clearly don't have an internal representation, grains of sand blowing on

2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:56.320
 the beach or something, right?

2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:59.520
 And I don't know, a crab wandering around on the beach.

2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:04.760
 And then generating an experiment where literally the experiment generates an entity that literally

2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:09.160
 has no internal representation to sand, these are oil droplets, actually, what I've got

2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:11.760
 in mind, a robot that makes oil droplets.

2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:16.400
 But then what we want to try and do is train the oil droplets to be like crabs, give them

2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:22.720
 an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information from the environment.

2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:31.200
 So they remember the past, are in the present, and can imagine a future.

2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:36.240
 And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine, their limited simulation of the world

2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:38.360
 allows them to then make a decision.

2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.440
 Your objects across time.

2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:44.680
 So then you would run a bunch of crabs, like over and over and over and over?

2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:46.480
 How many crabs, Lee?

2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:47.480
 Is there...

2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:51.520
 Because you have to have a large number of crabs, what does your theory say?

2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:52.520
 Is there a mathematical?

2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:53.520
 We're working on it.

2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:54.520
 I mean, this is literally...

2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:55.520
 Limit.

2:17:55.520 --> 2:17:56.520
 Crab limit.

2:17:56.520 --> 2:17:57.520
 There's literally a...

2:17:57.520 --> 2:17:58.520
 Excellent.

2:17:58.520 --> 2:17:59.520
 There's literally...

2:17:59.520 --> 2:18:00.520
 What's the herding cats have to do?

2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:01.520
 Oh, that's random.

2:18:01.520 --> 2:18:06.920
 Wait, what's cats in the title by Daniel Dennett, herding cats and the free will inflation?

2:18:06.920 --> 2:18:07.920
 So I love this...

2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:09.080
 What does herding cats mean?

2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:10.960
 What does free will inflation mean?

2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:16.000
 So this, I love this essay, because it explained to me how I could live in a deterministic

2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:28.720
 universe, but have free will, but have freedom, and also, it helped me explain that time needed

2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:31.000
 to be a real thing in this universe.

2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:35.120
 So what basically Dan was saying here is like, how do you...

2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:38.720
 These cats appear to just do what they want, right?

2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:42.880
 And if you live in a deterministic universe, why do the cats do these things?

2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:46.400
 Aren't they just all obvious?

2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:48.800
 And how does free will inflate the universe?

2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:53.840
 And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay because my interpretation of the essay in

2:18:53.840 --> 2:19:01.000
 assembly theory makes complete sense, because you need an expanding universe in assembly

2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:08.920
 theory to create novelty that you search for, that then when you find something interesting

2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:14.000
 and you keep doing it because it's cool and it gives you an advantage, then it appears

2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:15.520
 in the past to be a goal.

2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:19.920
 So what does in assembly theory, the expansion of the universe look like?

2:19:19.920 --> 2:19:24.440
 What are we talking about?

2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:30.480
 Why does the expansion universe give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?

2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:34.080
 So for me, I don't think about the universe in terms of big bang in space.

2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:39.960
 I think about in terms of the big memory expansion, that you only have the ability to store one

2:19:39.960 --> 2:19:42.760
 bit of information, so then you can't do very much.

2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:49.080
 So what the universe has been doing since forever, it's been creating more...

2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:53.360
 It's been increasing the size of its RAM, okay?

2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:57.680
 So it's like 1 megabyte, 2 megabyte, 3 megabyte, 4 megabytes all the way up.

2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:04.960
 And so the more RAM you have, the more you can remember about the past, which allows

2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:07.200
 you to do cooler things in the future.

2:20:07.200 --> 2:20:11.520
 So if you can remember how to launch a rocket, then you might be able to imagine how to land

2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:15.080
 a rocket and then relaunch, reland and carry on.

2:20:15.080 --> 2:20:21.160
 And so you're able to expand the space and remember the past.

2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:23.720
 And so that's why I think it's very important.

2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:28.360
 But not a perfect memory, it's an interesting question whether there's some forgetting that

2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:30.560
 happens and might increase.

2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:37.040
 Is the expansion of the forgetting at some point accelerate faster than the remembering?

2:20:37.040 --> 2:20:40.920
 I think that that's a very important thing that probably intelligence does and we're

2:20:40.920 --> 2:20:44.000
 going to learn and machine learning about, because you want machine learning right now

2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:48.080
 or artificial intelligence right now doesn't have memory right, but you want the ability

2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:53.840
 to, or not for, if you want to get to human like consciousness, you need to have the ability

2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:58.400
 I suppose to remember stuff and then to selectively forget stuff so you can re remember it and

2:20:58.400 --> 2:20:59.960
 compress it.

2:20:59.960 --> 2:21:02.200
 Arguably the way that we come up with new physical laws.

2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:03.200
 No currency.

2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:04.200
 Yeah.

2:21:04.200 --> 2:21:05.200
 Yeah.

2:21:05.200 --> 2:21:06.200
 Sorry.

2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:07.200
 No, no, it's all right.

2:21:07.200 --> 2:21:08.200
 No, I just wanted to.

2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:16.040
 I think that there is a great deal to be gained from having the ability to remember things,

2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:20.200
 but then when you forget them, you can then have it, you can basically do the simulation

2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:24.000
 again and work out if you get to that compressed representation.

2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:25.400
 So there's in cycles.

2:21:25.400 --> 2:21:31.520
 So cycles of remembering and forgetting are probably important, but there shouldn't be

2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:34.320
 excuse to have a met universe of memory in it.

2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:40.240
 The universe is going to remember that it forgot, but just not tell you.

2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:45.120
 I'm looking at this paper and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet controlling

2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:48.680
 a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet conceptually

2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:52.960
 easy to understand, but physically impossible as physically impossible as predicting a fair

2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:53.960
 coin toss.

2:21:53.960 --> 2:21:58.680
 I don't know what he's talking about, but there's pictures of puppets controlling puppets.

2:21:58.680 --> 2:22:03.400
 Let me ask you, there's a, there's a few things I want to ask, but we brought up time quite

2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:04.400
 a bit.

2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:09.200
 You guys tweet about time quite a bit.

2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:10.800
 What is time in all of this?

2:22:10.800 --> 2:22:16.240
 You kind of mentioned it a bunch, is it not important at all in terms of, is it just a

2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:17.240
 word?

2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:22.700
 Should we be talking about causality mostly like say, what do you think is, we've talked

2:22:22.700 --> 2:22:24.200
 about like memories.

2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:28.360
 Is that the fundamental thing that we should be thinking about and time is just a useful

2:22:28.360 --> 2:22:30.320
 measurement device or something like that?

2:22:30.320 --> 2:22:32.440
 Well, there's different concepts of time, right?

2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:34.920
 So I think in assembly theory, when we're talking about time, we're talking about the

2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:36.280
 ordering of things.

2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:38.400
 So that's the causal graph part.

2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:42.760
 And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a certain ordering

2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:44.760
 and certain things can't happen until other things happen.

2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:51.640
 But usually when we colloquially talk about time, we're talking about the flow of time.

2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:54.000
 And I guess Lee and I were actually debating about this this morning.

2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:58.280
 So in talking on it, walking on the river here, which is a very lovely spot for talking

2:22:58.280 --> 2:23:03.440
 about time, but that the, you know, that when the universe is updating, it's transitioning

2:23:03.440 --> 2:23:09.480
 between things that exist now and things that exist now.

2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:11.760
 That's really the flow of time.

2:23:11.760 --> 2:23:15.760
 So there's, there's, you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.

2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:20.040
 And then there's also an arrow of time that people talk about in physics, which is that

2:23:20.040 --> 2:23:24.720
 time doesn't appear to have a directionality in fundamental physics, but it does to us,

2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:25.720
 right?

2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:26.960
 Like we can't go backwards in time.

2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:31.560
 And usually we, you know, that would be explained in physics in terms of, well, there's a cosmological

2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:36.200
 arrow of time, but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time of increasing entropy.

2:23:36.200 --> 2:23:39.360
 But what we would say in assembly theory is that there is a clear directionality that

2:23:39.360 --> 2:23:42.960
 the universe only runs in one direction, which is why some things, it's easy to make.

2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:47.760
 If the universe ones and runs in one direction, it's easy to make processes look reversible.

2:23:47.760 --> 2:23:51.240
 For example, if they have no memory, they're easy to run forward and backwards, which is

2:23:51.240 --> 2:23:55.600
 why the laws of physics that we have now look the way they do because they involve objects

2:23:55.600 --> 2:23:56.720
 that have no memory.

2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:00.480
 But when you get to things like us, it becomes very clear that the universe has a directionality

2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:01.480
 associated to it.

2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:03.200
 So it's not reversible at all.

2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:06.360
 It's the no man ever steps in the same river.

2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:08.480
 I just have to bring that out because you won't run the river.

2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:12.800
 No man has ever steps in the same river twice, but it's not the same river and he's not

2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:13.800
 the same man.

2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:15.800
 So it's not reversible.

2:24:15.800 --> 2:24:19.560
 No, no, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?

2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:23.040
 So we think of the reversibility of laws as being fundamental and the irreversibility

2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:24.040
 as being emergent.

2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:28.040
 But I think what we would say from how we think about it, and certainly it's easy to

2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:33.520
 get the case for our perception of time, but also what's happening in biological evolution.

2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:38.840
 You can make things reversible, but it requires work to do it, and it requires certain machines

2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:42.720
 to run it forward and backward, and Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas

2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:46.400
 on constructor theory related to that, which is a totally different set of ideas.

2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:49.560
 So you can travel back in time sometimes?

2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:50.560
 Yes.

2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:51.560
 No.

2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:57.040
 You can't travel actually back in time, but you could reconstruct things that have existed

2:24:57.040 --> 2:24:58.120
 in the past.

2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:01.320
 You're always moving forward in time, but you can cycle through.

2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:03.200
 Can I clarify what you just said?

2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:04.200
 Yeah, yeah, go for it.

2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:05.200
 Quickly.

2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:06.200
 You travel forward in time to travel back?

2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:07.200
 Yes.

2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:08.200
 Thank you.

2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:09.200
 That really clarified it.

2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:13.920
 What Sarah is saying is you don't go back in time, you recreate what happened in the

2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:16.000
 past in the future and inspect it again.

2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:19.240
 So in that local pocket of time, it's as if you travel back in time.

2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:22.440
 So how's that not traveling back in time?

2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:24.960
 Because you're not going back to your same self back in time.

2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:27.320
 You are creating that in the future.

2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:30.120
 But everything else is the same as it was in the past.

2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:31.120
 No.

2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:32.120
 No, no, no.

2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:33.120
 It's not in registry.

2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:34.120
 I mean, it goes back to the big question.

2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:39.840
 I'm saying, I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today when I first had this

2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:44.920
 discussion and I was talking to Sarah on Skype and said, by the way, time is the fundamental

2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:45.920
 thing in the universe.

2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:47.320
 She's almost hung up on me.

2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:48.320
 Right.

2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:51.640
 But you can even, I mean, if you want to make an analogy to computation, and I think Charles

2:25:51.640 --> 2:25:55.880
 Bennett actually has a paper on this, like about reversible computation and reversible

2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:57.120
 Turing machines.

2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:01.360
 In order to make it reversible, you have to store memory to run the process backwards.

2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:05.400
 So time is always running forward in that because you have to write the memory.

2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:06.720
 You can't erase the memory.

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:11.480
 You can erase the memory, but the point, when you go back to zero, right?

2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:17.440
 But the whole point is that in order to have a process that even runs in both directions,

2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:21.720
 you have to start talking about memory to store the information to run it backwards.

2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:22.720
 I got it.

2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:27.440
 So you can't really then, you can't have it exactly how it was in the past.

2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:28.440
 Yeah, exactly.

2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:30.880
 You have extra stuff, extra baggage always.

2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:31.880
 Okay.

2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:34.560
 A really important thing that I want to say on this, I think if I try and get it right,

2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:39.560
 I just say that if you can think that the universe is expanding in terms of the number

2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:45.440
 of boxes that it has to store states, right?

2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:49.040
 And this is where the directionality of the universe comes from, everything comes from.

2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:53.120
 You could have raised what's in those boxes, but the fact you've now got so many boxes

2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:58.120
 at time now in this present, there's more of those boxes than there were in the past.

2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:00.400
 But the boxes aren't physical boxes.

2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:03.520
 It's not space or time.

2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:05.880
 Why is the number of boxes always expanding?

2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:09.720
 It's very hard to imagine this because we live in space.

2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:16.320
 So what I'm saying, which is I think probably correct is that we just, let's just imagine

2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:23.880
 for a second, there is a nonlocal situation, but there are these things called states and

2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:30.600
 that the universe, irrespective of whether you measure anything, there is a universal,

2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:33.680
 let's call it a clock or a state creator.

2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.920
 Maybe we can call this way, maybe you can call it God, but let's call it a state creator

2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:41.720
 where the universe is expanding and the number of states it has.

2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:43.320
 Why are you saying it's expanding though?

2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:45.320
 Is that obvious that it's expanding the number of states?

2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:48.000
 It's obvious because that's where the, because we...

2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.480
 That's a source of novelty.

2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:54.920
 It's a source of novelty, and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.

2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:57.640
 I didn't know it's not predictable.

2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:01.480
 I just like interrupting him, sorry, it's fine because you're struggling.

2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:06.080
 I'm struggling because I'm trying to be as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm

2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:15.160
 insane, and I'm not insane, it's obvious because you did, I'm a chemist, so as a chemist

2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:22.920
 I grew into the world understanding irreversibility, irreversibility is all I knew, and when people

2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:27.800
 start telling me the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick, we can use

2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:28.800
 time to do it.

2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:40.040
 What I mean is the second law is really the magical, but why does it need to be magical?

2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:44.040
 The universe is just asymmetric, all I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric in the state

2:28:44.040 --> 2:28:50.560
 production, and we can erase those states, but we just have more computational power,

2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:56.040
 so what I'm saying is that the universe is deterministic horizon, this is one of the

2:28:56.040 --> 2:29:01.120
 reasons we can't live in a simulation by the way, you can't live in a simulation.

2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:02.120
 The irreversibility?

2:29:02.120 --> 2:29:06.880
 Yeah, so basically every time you try and simulate the universe, you know, I live in

2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:10.200
 a simulation, the universe is expanded in states, like, oh damn it, I need to make my

2:29:10.200 --> 2:29:14.520
 computer bigger again, and every time you try and contain the universe in the computation

2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:20.000
 because it's got bigger in number of states, and so I'm saying the fact the universe has

2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:28.360
 novelty in it is going to turn out experimentally to be proof that time, as I've labeled it,

2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:34.560
 is fundamental and exists as a physical thing that creates space.

2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:40.400
 Okay, so if you can prove that novelty is always being created, you're saying that it's

2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:46.000
 possible to also then prove that it's always expanding in the state space, those are things

2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.240
 that have to be proven.

2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:50.120
 That's what we're working on experiments for, yeah.

2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:55.240
 And you're trying to, like, by looking at the sliver of reality, show that there's always

2:29:55.240 --> 2:29:57.400
 novelty being generated.

2:29:57.400 --> 2:30:01.920
 Because if we go live in a universe that the conventional physicists would live in, it's

2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:04.920
 a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.

2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:12.360
 I want to prove that that book doesn't exist, it's continuously being added pages on.

2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:16.200
 So all I'm saying, if the universe is a book, we started, the universe at the beginning

2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:20.600
 only had no pages or had one page, another page, another page, whereas the physicists

2:30:20.600 --> 2:30:24.560
 would now say all the pages exist and we could in principle access them.

2:30:24.560 --> 2:30:27.240
 I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.

2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:32.320
 Do you know what's written in this book, the free will question?

2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:41.320
 Is there room for free will in this view of the universe is generating novelty and getting

2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:46.600
 greater and greater assembly structures built, Sarah?

2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:47.600
 Yes.

2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:48.600
 Okay.

2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:49.600
 Done.

2:30:49.600 --> 2:30:50.600
 Next question.

2:30:50.600 --> 2:30:51.600
 Why?

2:30:51.600 --> 2:30:53.280
 What's the source of free will in this?

2:30:53.280 --> 2:30:57.520
 Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but...

2:30:57.520 --> 2:30:58.520
 Yeah.

2:30:58.520 --> 2:30:59.520
 Well, please.

2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:00.520
 There's a lot.

2:31:00.520 --> 2:31:08.480
 I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is do we have individual

2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:11.680
 autonomy and agency?

2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:17.960
 When I do things, is it really me or is it my atoms that did it?

2:31:17.960 --> 2:31:19.120
 That's the part that's interesting to me.

2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:23.880
 I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part, but the way I think about

2:31:23.880 --> 2:31:33.480
 it is each of us are a thread or an assembly space through this giant possibility space

2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:38.800
 and it's like we're moving on our own trajectory through that space and that is defined by

2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:39.800
 our history.

2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:46.520
 So we're sort of causally contingent on our past, but also because of the sort of intersection

2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:52.320
 of novelty generation, it's not completely predetermined by the past.

2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:59.000
 And so then you have the causal control of the determinism part that you are your causal

2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:04.560
 history and there's some determinism from that past, but there's also room for creativity.

2:32:04.560 --> 2:32:09.640
 And I think it's actually necessary that something like free will exist if the universe is going

2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:18.120
 to be as creative as possible because if I were all intelligent being, inventing a universe

2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:23.120
 and I wanted it to have maximal number of interesting things happen, again, we should

2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:25.720
 come up with the metric of interesting.

2:32:25.720 --> 2:32:26.720
 Family.

2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:32.920
 Generating, yes, I know, generating maximal possibilities than I would want the agents

2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:40.560
 to have free will because it means that they're more individual, like each entity actually

2:32:40.560 --> 2:32:45.440
 is a different causal force in the universe and it's intrinsic and local property of

2:32:45.440 --> 2:32:46.440
 that system.

2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:52.440
 There's a greater number of distributed agents, like are you always creating more and more

2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:54.800
 individuality?

2:32:54.800 --> 2:32:58.520
 Kind of, I would say you're creating more causal power.

2:32:58.520 --> 2:33:04.440
 So causal power, the word consciousness, is the causal power somehow correlated with

2:33:04.440 --> 2:33:05.440
 consciousness?

2:33:05.440 --> 2:33:09.000
 I mean, that's why I have this conception of consciousness being related to imagination

2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:13.400
 because the more that we can imagine can happen and the more counterfactual possibilities

2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:17.600
 you have in mind, the more you can actually implement and somehow free will is also at

2:33:17.600 --> 2:33:21.560
 the intersection of the counterfactual becoming the actual.

2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:25.800
 So can you elaborate on that a little bit that consciousness is imagination?

2:33:25.800 --> 2:33:30.360
 I don't know exactly how to articulate it and I'm sure people will take aim at certain

2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:34.600
 things I'm saying, but I think the language is really imprecise, so I'm not the best

2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:35.600
 way to.

2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:41.760
 It's really interesting, like what is imagination and what is it, what role does it play in

2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:45.280
 the human experience, in experience of any agent?

2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:49.960
 I love imagination, I think it's like the most amazing thing we do, but I guess one

2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:53.920
 way I would think about it is we talked about the transition to life being the universe

2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:58.760
 acquiring memory and life does something really interesting, just think about biology generally.

2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:02.680
 It remembers states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future.

2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.320
 So the longer life has evolved on this planet, the deeper that past is, the more memory we

2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:11.480
 have, the more kinds of organisms and things, but what human level intelligence has done

2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:12.840
 is quite different.

2:34:12.840 --> 2:34:17.040
 It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before, it's

2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:22.720
 that we can imagine ones that have never existed and we can actually make them come into existence.

2:34:22.720 --> 2:34:27.720
 And I think that's the most unique feature about the transition to whatever we are from

2:34:27.720 --> 2:34:32.120
 what life on this planet has been doing for the last four billion years.

2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:34.480
 And I think it's deeply related to the phenomena we call consciousness.

2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:36.280
 Yeah, I was going to just agree with that.

2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:40.480
 I think that consciousness is the ability to generate those counterfactuals.

2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:43.080
 Now whether you can say, you know, are there degrees of consciousness?

2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:50.240
 I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals, although they

2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:54.160
 do have some kind of, they are able to search a space and pathways.

2:34:54.160 --> 2:35:01.520
 But I think that there is a very concrete, or concrete, there's a very specific property

2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:03.240
 that humans have.

2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:08.000
 And I don't know if it's unique to humans, I mean, maybe dogs can do it and birds can

2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:09.160
 do it, right?

2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:14.600
 And where they are basically solving a problem, because consciousness was invented, or this

2:35:14.600 --> 2:35:19.440
 abstraction was invented by evolution for a specific reason.

2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:24.800
 And so look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion that time was fundamental

2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:30.280
 was actually because Sarah and I had a completely different...

2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:32.520
 The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.

2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:34.080
 No, no, no, no, we had to...

2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:35.080
 On which topic?

2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:37.720
 No, it goes back to the free will thing.

2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:39.360
 So I think the...

2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:42.400
 Although I've changed my view a bit because there's some really interesting physicists

2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:48.240
 out there who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space...

2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:53.640
 I don't want to go there just now because I think I'll mess it up, but briefly, I could

2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:54.840
 not see how the universe...

2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:56.040
 How we can have free will.

2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:01.200
 And I mean, this is really boring because this is like a well trodden path, but I'm not

2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:02.200
 so boring.

2:36:02.200 --> 2:36:03.200
 I suppose it's kind of...

2:36:03.200 --> 2:36:04.200
 We just want to be precise.

2:36:04.200 --> 2:36:08.120
 And if the universe is deterministic, how can we have free will, right?

2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:11.040
 So Sarah's a physicist.

2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:16.760
 I think she believe and not believe can show that most of the laws we have are deterministic

2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:20.400
 to some degree, quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.

2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:22.400
 And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will.

2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:27.040
 And I'm like, your belief system is broken here, right?

2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:33.120
 Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic universe.

2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:39.480
 And then I realized that I agreed with her that I do think that free will is a thing because

2:36:39.480 --> 2:36:41.560
 we are able to search for novelty.

2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:45.160
 And then that's where I came to the conclusion that time universe was expanding in terms

2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:46.520
 of novelty.

2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:51.920
 And it goes back to that Darren Dennett essay that we're talking about, the free will inflation.

2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:58.840
 So the past, it did not exist in the past, the past exists in the present.

2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:03.280
 What I mean is like, there was no past, there is only present.

2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:08.280
 So I mean, you are the sum total, everything that occurs in the past is manifestly here

2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:09.800
 in the present.

2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:15.280
 And then you have this little echo state in your consciousness, because you're able to

2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:20.680
 imagine something without actualization, but the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons

2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:24.840
 and potassium ion flows in your neural network, in your brain.

2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:27.920
 Maybe consciousness is just the present.

2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:30.960
 So somehow you imagine that.

2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:35.760
 And then by imagining, oh, that's good, yeah, I'm going to make a robot do this thing and

2:37:35.760 --> 2:37:36.760
 program it.

2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:39.200
 And then you physically then go and do it.

2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:42.320
 So that changes the future, sorry.

2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:44.360
 What's imagination?

2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:46.120
 Does it require the past?

2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:47.800
 Does it require the future?

2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:49.080
 Does it require memory?

2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:50.080
 Does it?

2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:51.080
 Yes.

2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:52.080
 Imagination.

2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:53.080
 Does it only exist in the moment?

2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:58.920
 So imagination is probably, yeah, probably it's an instantaneous readout of what's going

2:37:58.920 --> 2:37:59.920
 on.

2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:04.720
 You can maybe, your subconscious brain has been generating all the bits for it, but no,

2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:10.680
 imagination occurs when you, in your game engine, you remember the past and you integrate

2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:14.520
 sensory the present and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.

2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:16.200
 And then you go and make that happen.

2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:20.800
 So the imagination is this, it's like, imagine asking what imagination is about asking what

2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:22.520
 surfing is.

2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:26.440
 You can surfboard, surf a wave coming in.

2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:31.320
 When you're on that wave and you're surfing, that's where the imagination is.

2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:35.800
 I think imagination is just accessing things that aren't the present moment in the present

2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:36.800
 moment.

2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:41.000
 So like I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table and I can imagine the river and

2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.440
 things or whatever it was.

2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:50.320
 And so it seems to be that it's like, it's our ability to access things that aren't present.

2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:56.840
 But to conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin to something that happened to you

2:38:56.840 --> 2:38:57.840
 recently.

2:38:57.840 --> 2:38:58.840
 Right.

2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:00.760
 But they don't have to be things that actually happened in your past.

2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:02.680
 And I think this gets back to assembly theory.

2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:07.200
 Like the way I would think about imagination from an assembly theoretic standpoint is I'm

2:39:07.200 --> 2:39:15.520
 a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment as a particular configuration of Sarah.

2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:18.640
 But there's a lot of, I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.

2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:22.480
 But I have that whole causal history and I can access parts of it.

2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:26.160
 Now when you talk about getting to something as complex as us, having as large an assembly

2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:31.440
 space as us, there's ways of, like there's a lot of things in that causal graph that

2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:36.120
 have ever actually never existed in the past history of the universe because like the universe

2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:41.240
 got big enough to contain the three of us in this room in time.

2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:48.440
 But not all the features of each one of us individually have come into existence as physical

2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:49.440
 objects.

2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:50.440
 We would recognize as individual objects.

2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:55.440
 This goes back to your point that we actually have to explain why things actually even look

2:39:55.440 --> 2:40:00.960
 like objects and aren't just a smear of mass.

2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:04.920
 And just on the free will and physics thing, when you were talking, I was, I just want

2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:07.960
 to bring this up because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint that Nicholas Jisen

2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:12.120
 has that, you know, like we want to use the laws of physics and then say you can't have

2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:13.120
 free will.

2:40:13.120 --> 2:40:17.120
 And his point is you have to have free will in order to even choose to set up an experiment

2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:18.280
 to test the laws of physics.

2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:22.400
 So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental than physics is because to even

2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:28.480
 do science, there's some assumption that the agents have free will.

2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:33.920
 And I always thought it was really perplexing that, you know, physics wants to remove agency

2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:37.480
 because the idea that I could do an experiment here on this part of Earth and then I can

2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:43.040
 move somewhere else and prepare an identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again

2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:46.840
 seems to imply something about the structure of our universe that is not encoded in the

2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:50.000
 laws that we're testing in those experiments.

2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.560
 So this kind of dream of physics that you can do multiple experiments, different locations

2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:58.680
 and then validate each other, you're saying that's an illusion?

2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:04.280
 No, I'm saying that requires decision making and free will to be a real thing, I think.

2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:08.320
 Like I think the fact that we can do science is not arbitrary.

2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:12.040
 And I think people, you know, the standard canon in physics would be, well, you could

2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:15.840
 trace all of that back to the initial condition of the universe, but the whole point of science

2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:19.160
 is I can imagine doing the experiment and I can do it and then I can do it again and

2:41:19.160 --> 2:41:20.720
 again and again all over the planet.

2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:24.720
 Do you imagine somehow fundamentally generative of novelty?

2:41:24.720 --> 2:41:25.720
 Yes.

2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:29.640
 So it's not like the universe could have predicted the things you imagined.

2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:33.480
 Imagination super, so coming back to novelty, I think novelty can exist outside of imagination

2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:34.480
 but it supercharges it.

2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:36.320
 It's another transition, I think.

2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:39.880
 I mean, I would say, I mean, this may be a boring statement, but I would say the fact

2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:40.880
 there, sorry?

2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:41.880
 I'm not sure.

2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:42.880
 These are hard questions.

2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:48.440
 I mean, I think the fact that objects exist is yet another proof that time is fundamental

2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:50.760
 and novelty exists, right?

2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:55.120
 Because I think, again, if you ask the physicists to write down in the infinite Bible of the

2:41:55.120 --> 2:42:02.880
 universe, let's call it the Bible, the mathematical universe, whether you're on Max Techmark or

2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:11.280
 Sean Carroll or Frank Wilczek or Stephen Wolfram, okay?

2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:12.280
 I like that book.

2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:13.280
 Yeah.

2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:14.280
 I love it too.

2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:15.280
 Lots of pretty pictures.

2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:19.960
 It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity of the universe by saying, well,

2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:20.960
 it's all their mathematics.

2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:22.640
 It all exists, right?

2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:28.280
 And I would say that that's why I'm excited about the future of the universe because although

2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:36.880
 it is somehow dependent upon the past, it is not constrained just by the past, which

2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:38.800
 is kind of mad.

2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:39.800
 Yeah.

2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:42.560
 Free will is, it's not constrained by the past.

2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:44.480
 It's dependent on the past.

2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:46.560
 This moment, it's not just dependent.

2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:52.080
 This moment is the past, and yet it has the capacity to generate a totally unpredictable

2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:53.080
 future.

2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:56.680
 I mean, the other thing I would say is super important for human beings, right?

2:42:56.680 --> 2:43:00.680
 Human beings have actually very little causal control in the future.

2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:02.160
 I realize this the other week.

2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:03.680
 Oh, then we get future in the future.

2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:04.680
 Yeah.

2:43:04.680 --> 2:43:05.680
 Yeah.

2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:06.680
 So what happened?

2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:07.680
 So this is what I think it is.

2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:11.880
 By reinterpreting your past, I mean, talking about from a kind of cognitive, psychological

2:43:11.880 --> 2:43:18.640
 cognitive point of view, by reinterpreting your past in your current mind, you can actually

2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:25.360
 help you shape your future again, but you have much more freedom to interpret your past,

2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:29.600
 to act in the present, to change your future than you do to change your future.

2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:30.600
 It may sound weird.

2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:34.560
 So I'm saying to everybody, imagine your past, think about your past, reinterpret your

2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:40.320
 past in the nicest way you can, then imagine what you can do next, or imagine your past

2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:43.960
 in a more negative way in what you do next, and look at those two counterfactuals.

2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:44.960
 They're different.

2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:45.960
 Yeah, it's fast.

2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:49.720
 I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this, that most of our life is lived in our memories.

2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:53.920
 It's interesting because you can essentially, in imagination, choose the life you live.

2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:57.960
 So maybe free will exist in imagination.

2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:03.640
 Choices are made in your imagination, and that results in you basically able to control

2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:10.400
 how the future unfolds, because you're like, imagine reinterpreting constantly the things

2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:11.400
 that happen to you.

2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:12.400
 Exactly.

2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:17.320
 So if you want to increase your amount of free will, I don't think everyone has equal

2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:27.520
 amounts of agency because of our sad constraints, whether happenstance, health, economic, born

2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:29.640
 in a certain place, right?

2:44:29.640 --> 2:44:36.200
 But those of us that have the ability to go back and reinterpret our past and use that

2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:42.960
 to change the future are the ones that exert most agency in the present.

2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:49.320
 And I want to achieve higher degrees of agency and enable everyone else to do that as well,

2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:52.080
 to have more fun in the universe.

2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:54.440
 Then we'll hit that peak, the maximum fun point.

2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:56.480
 I don't think there's ever going to be a maximum.

2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:00.360
 I think the wonderful thing about the future is there's always going to be more fun.

2:45:00.360 --> 2:45:01.360
 Yeah.

2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:08.440
 I think, again, go back to Twitter, I think you tweeted something about being a life maximalist

2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:15.160
 that you want to maximize the amount of life in the universe.

2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:20.440
 The more general version of that goal is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe,

2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:25.040
 because life is a subset of fun, all kinds of... I suppose they're either correlated

2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:27.120
 or exactly equal, I don't know.

2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:32.360
 Anyway, speaking of fun, let me ask you about alien sightings.

2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:36.440
 So there's been quite a bit of UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff.

2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:46.120
 What do you think would be the first time when humans sight aliens, see aliens in an

2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:49.560
 sort of unquestionable way?

2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:57.960
 This extremely strong and arguable way, we've made contact with aliens, Sarah.

2:45:57.960 --> 2:45:58.960
 What would it look like?

2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:05.440
 Obviously, the space of possibility is huge here, but if you were to kind of look into

2:46:05.440 --> 2:46:07.320
 the future, what would that look like?

2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:14.440
 Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there that slowly unravel the mystery, or would it

2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:19.160
 be like an obvious overwhelming signal?

2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:23.240
 So I think we have an obsession with making contact with events.

2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:30.200
 So what do I mean by that is people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.

2:46:30.200 --> 2:46:36.960
 And I always think what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now is not

2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:41.720
 that I have a disbelief about what people are experiencing or feeling, but the discussion

2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:45.560
 right now is sort of at the level of modern mythology.

2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:52.400
 Humans are mythos in modern culture, and when you treat it like that, then I want to think

2:46:52.400 --> 2:46:58.280
 about when do things that we traditionally only regularize through mythology actually

2:46:58.280 --> 2:47:00.320
 become things that become standard knowledge.

2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:05.880
 So it used to be variations in the climate were described by some kind of gods or something,

2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:11.240
 and now our technology picks up an anomaly or someone sees something, we say it's aliens.

2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:16.720
 And I think the real thing is it's not contact with events, but first contact is actually

2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:20.080
 contact with knowledge of the phenomena or the explanation.

2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:25.200
 And so this is very subtle and very abstract, but when does it become something that we

2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:28.480
 actually understand what it is that we're talking about?

2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:29.480
 That's first contact.

2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:30.480
 It's not...

2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:35.280
 Would you make the myth, would you give credit to the myth, the mythology as first contact?

2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:36.280
 Because you might...

2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:37.280
 I think yes.

2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:40.640
 I think it's the rudimentary that we have some understanding that there's a phenomena

2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:43.000
 that we have to understand and regularize.

2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:44.000
 So I think...

2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:45.000
 We have to understand that there is weather.

2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:46.000
 Yes.

2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.200
 You have to construct a pathology on that weather.

2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:49.200
 Yes.

2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:50.200
 It's something that's controllable.

2:47:50.200 --> 2:47:51.200
 Right.

2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:52.200
 Yeah, like this is if not...

2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:55.200
 I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.

2:47:55.200 --> 2:47:56.200
 Right.

2:47:56.200 --> 2:48:03.280
 It could be that, although there's lots of alien sight, so called alien sightings, right?

2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:05.520
 So there is a number of things you can do, you could just dismiss them and say they're

2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:09.600
 not true, they're kind of made up, or you say, well, there's something interesting here,

2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:10.600
 right?

2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:11.600
 We keep seeing a commonality, right?

2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:14.560
 We see the same phenomena again and again and again.

2:48:14.560 --> 2:48:17.560
 Also there's this interesting thing about human imagination.

2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:23.800
 Even if they are not, let's not say made up, but misappropriated kind of other inputs,

2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:29.400
 the fact that human consciousness is capable of imagining in contact with aliens, does

2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:32.840
 that not tell us about something about where we are in our position, in our culture, in

2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:33.840
 our technology?

2:48:33.840 --> 2:48:35.520
 It tells us not where in time we are.

2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:38.080
 Could it be that we're making contact with...

2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:42.800
 So let's say, let's take the most miserable version, there are no aliens in the universe,

2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:44.920
 life is only on Earth.

2:48:44.920 --> 2:48:48.440
 That then, the interpretation of that is we're desperate to kind of understand why we're

2:48:48.440 --> 2:48:50.560
 the only life in the universe, right?

2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:54.040
 The other one is the other most extreme is that aliens are visiting all the time, and

2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:58.920
 we're just not able to capture them coherently, or there's a big conspiracy, and there's

2:48:58.920 --> 2:49:04.120
 the Area 51, and there are lizards everywhere, and there's that.

2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.520
 So I kind of in favor the idea that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea that we

2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:12.960
 aren't alone in the universe, and we're just running the simulation, and we're seeing

2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:19.800
 some evidence, we don't know what life is yet, we do have some anomalies out there,

2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:28.760
 we can't explain everything, and over time, we will start to unpack that.

2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:35.800
 One very plausible thing we might do, which might be boring for the average alien observable

2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:40.120
 believes that aliens are, as in intelligent aliens, are visiting Earth, it could be that

2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:45.400
 we might go to the outer solar system and find a new type of life that has completely

2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:50.680
 new chemistry, bring these cells back to Earth, where you could say in my hand, on Earth,

2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:56.560
 here's RNA, DNA, and proteins, and look, cells self replicate, from Titan, we got this new

2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:01.720
 set of molecules, new set of cells, and we feed it stuff and it grows.

2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:09.280
 That for me, if we were able to do that, would be like the most, that would be my UFO sign.

2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:14.560
 That's a good test, so you feed it and it grows.

2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:15.560
 Yeah.

2:50:15.560 --> 2:50:22.720
 We've made, so not until you know how to feed the thing, and it grows somehow.

2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:28.120
 We can make a comic book, the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.

2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:34.120
 What would you say is between the two of you is the biggest disagreement about alien life

2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:35.920
 out there?

2:50:35.920 --> 2:50:41.520
 Is it from the basic framework of thinking about what is life, to maybe what aliens look

2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:47.440
 like, to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings, what would you think?

2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:56.120
 I would say the biggest one is that the emergence of life does not have to be, it can't just

2:50:56.120 --> 2:51:00.120
 happen once on the planet, that it could be two or more life forms present on the planet

2:51:00.120 --> 2:51:03.440
 at once, and I think Sarah doesn't agree with that.

2:51:03.440 --> 2:51:07.840
 I think that's like, logically inconsistent.

2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:08.840
 That's really polite.

2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:11.280
 I'm really saying it's nonsense, because you think that, yeah.

2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:12.280
 Oh, likely is that.

2:51:12.280 --> 2:51:18.680
 The idea that, what does it look like, let's imagine two alien civilizations coexisting

2:51:18.680 --> 2:51:21.360
 on a planet, what's that look like exactly?

2:51:21.360 --> 2:51:25.600
 So I would say, I think I've got to get around your argument.

2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:26.600
 Okay.

2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:27.600
 Yeah.

2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:32.120
 Let's say that on this planet, there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry,

2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:37.920
 and one life form emerges based on carbon and interacts, and there's an ecosystem based

2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:41.960
 on carbon, and there's an orthogonal.

2:51:41.960 --> 2:51:45.480
 And so it's planetary phenomena, which is what you, I think, right?

2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:50.040
 But there's also one that cohes on silicon, and because there's enough energy and there's

2:51:50.040 --> 2:51:57.320
 enough stuff, that these life forms might not actually necessarily compete evolutionarily.

2:51:57.320 --> 2:52:01.400
 Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all, because they're going to be coconstructing

2:52:01.400 --> 2:52:02.680
 each other's causal chains.

2:52:02.680 --> 2:52:04.080
 I think that's what you just got me.

2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:10.280
 So there's no overlap in terms of their causal chains, or very limited overlap.

2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:13.440
 Yeah, so I think the only way I can get away with that is to say, right, life could emerge

2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:15.680
 on a planet underneath.

2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:16.680
 And okay.

2:52:16.680 --> 2:52:18.640
 The lizard people under the crust of the earth.

2:52:18.640 --> 2:52:24.480
 I think, I think, I think, let's go, I, I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree.

2:52:24.480 --> 2:52:29.800
 So, and I think Sarah actually has convinced me because of the, the life is a planetary

2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:34.920
 phenomenon, the emergence of life is a planetary phenomena, and, and actually because of the

2:52:34.920 --> 2:52:39.400
 way evolution selection works, then nothing occurs in isolation, the causal chains interact.

2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:42.480
 So there is a common, there's a consensus model for life on the earth.

2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:49.800
 But you don't think you can place aliens from elsewhere onto the, can't you just place

2:52:49.800 --> 2:52:52.360
 multiple alien civilizations on one planet?

2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:53.360
 Right.

2:52:53.360 --> 2:52:58.560
 But I think, so you can take two original life events that were independent and commingle

2:52:58.560 --> 2:52:59.560
 them.

2:52:59.560 --> 2:53:05.120
 But I don't think when you're talking about, when you, when you look at the interaction

2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:10.800
 of that structure, it's, it, it's like the same idea as like an experiment being an example

2:53:10.800 --> 2:53:11.800
 of life, right?

2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:13.840
 That's a really abstract and subtle concept.

2:53:13.840 --> 2:53:18.320
 And I guess what I'm saying is life is information propagating through matter.

2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:23.880
 So once you start having things interacting, they, in some sense, commingle and they become

2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:26.120
 part of the same chain.

2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:27.120
 So,

2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:29.560
 There is a commingling starts quickly.

2:53:29.560 --> 2:53:30.560
 Yeah.

2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:32.560
 Proceeds, we proceed to commingle quickly.

2:53:32.560 --> 2:53:33.560
 Right.

2:53:33.560 --> 2:53:34.560
 Right.

2:53:34.560 --> 2:53:39.280
 So the question is then, the more interesting question is, are there two distinct origins

2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:40.280
 events?

2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:43.920
 And I still think that there's reasons that on a single planet, you would have one origins

2:53:43.920 --> 2:53:49.680
 event because of the time scales of cycling, of geochemistry on a planet.

2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:53.520
 And also the fact that I don't think that the origin of life happens in a pool and like

2:53:53.520 --> 2:53:58.080
 radiates outward through evolutionary processes, I think it's a multi scale phenomenon happens

2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:02.440
 at the level of individual molecules interacting, collections of molecules interacting in entire

2:54:02.440 --> 2:54:04.240
 planetary scale cycles.

2:54:04.240 --> 2:54:08.200
 So life as we know it has always been multi scale.

2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:13.080
 And there's, I'm brilliant examples of individual mutations at the genome level changing global

2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:14.080
 climate.

2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:15.080
 Right.

2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:19.400
 So there's a tight coupling between things that happen at, you know, the largest scale

2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:24.000
 of our planetary scale and the smallest scale that life mediates.

2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:29.800
 But it still might be difficult within something you will call as a single civil alien civilization,

2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:31.920
 you know, different, there's species and stuff.

2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:32.920
 But I think,

2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:33.920
 Yeah.

2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:36.720
 But you're asking about life, not species, right?

2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:43.240
 But what's the difference between one living civilization?

2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:49.000
 This is almost like a category question versus species, because it can be very different

2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:53.480
 in the way evolution, because there's like island, like literally islands that you can

2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:55.640
 evolve different kinds of turtles and stuff.

2:54:55.640 --> 2:54:56.640
 Yeah.

2:54:56.640 --> 2:54:57.640
 And they can

2:54:57.640 --> 2:54:58.640
 So I guess what I'm saying is

2:54:58.640 --> 2:54:59.640
 Weird.

2:54:59.640 --> 2:55:00.640
 In different ways.

2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:07.920
 You have two interacting living things, populations, and you look in their past, and they have

2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:12.360
 independent origins for their causal chain, then you would say one was alien, you know,

2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:15.000
 they have different independent origins events.

2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:18.640
 But if you look at their future by virtue of the fact they're interacting, their causal

2:55:18.640 --> 2:55:26.320
 chains have become commingled so that in the future, they are not independent, right?

2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:28.560
 So that's why you would even define them as alien.

2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:33.880
 So the structure across time is two examples of life become one example of life, because

2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:36.160
 life is the entire structure across time.

2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:37.160
 Right.

2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:39.320
 But there could be a lot of variation with this.

2:55:39.320 --> 2:55:40.320
 Yeah.

2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:46.200
 So the question we're all interested in is how many independent origins of a complexifying

2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:49.360
 causal chain are there in the universe?

2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:59.360
 The idea of origin is easy for you to define, because when the species split in the evolutionary

2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:09.560
 process and you get like a dolphin versus a human or Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens,

2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:10.560
 isn't there?

2:56:10.560 --> 2:56:13.000
 They make a distinction here quickly.

2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:19.000
 So I think, sorry to interrupt, what we're saying, I mean, I mean, I mean, Sarah, what

2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:23.600
 we won that argument, because I think she's right, that once the causal chains interact

2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:24.600
 and going forward.

2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:25.880
 So we're talking about a number of things.

2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:31.840
 Let's go all the way back before origin of life, origin life on Earth, chemistry emerges.

2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:35.800
 So there's all these, I would say there's probably mechanistically, the chemistry is

2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:40.760
 desperately trying to find any way to get replicated is the ribosome kind of was really

2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:41.760
 rubbish at the beginning.

2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:44.920
 And he just competed, competed, competed, and you got better and better ribosome suddenly.

2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:46.360
 That was a technology.

2:56:46.360 --> 2:56:51.720
 The ribosome is the technology that way, boom, allowed evolution to start.

2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:55.880
 So what I was trying to, why I interrupted you is say that once evolution has started

2:56:55.880 --> 2:57:00.360
 using that technology, then you can speciate.

2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:05.160
 And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said was convinced me of, because I was like,

2:57:05.160 --> 2:57:08.120
 no, we can have lots of different chemistry shadow biosphere on Earth.

2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:14.160
 And she's like, no, no, no, you have to have this, you have to get to this minimum evolutionary

2:57:14.160 --> 2:57:16.400
 machine.

2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:21.760
 And then when that occurs, speciation occurs exactly what it's like dolphins, humans, everything

2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:23.680
 on Earth.

2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:28.040
 But when you're looking at aliens or alien life, there's not going to be two different

2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:31.880
 types of chemistry because they compete, they compete and interact and cooperate because

2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:35.560
 the causal chains overlap, one might kill the other, one might combine with the other.

2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.640
 And then you go on, and then you have this kind of this average and sure there might

2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:42.080
 be respeciation.

2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:44.640
 They might be have two types of emerging chemistry.

2:57:44.640 --> 2:57:50.160
 It almost looks like the origin of life on Earth required two different pre life forms,

2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:55.840
 the peptide world and the RNA world, somehow they got together and by combining, you got

2:57:55.840 --> 2:57:59.800
 the ribosome and that was the minimum competent entity for evolution.

2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:06.880
 And would all alien civilizations have an evolutionary process on a planet?

2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:11.160
 So like that's one of the almost, it's almost the definition of life to create all those

2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:12.160
 memories.

2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:15.880
 You have to have something to change in time.

2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:21.440
 But there has to be selection, that's like an efficient, there's no other way to do

2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:22.440
 it.

2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:23.440
 No.

2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:25.440
 Well, never say never because soon I'll say that's what's up.

2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:28.800
 That's the part that depresses me though, going back to like, I don't know, the earlier

2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:33.440
 discussion on violence and things like, and I don't know where somebody was tweeting about

2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:36.880
 this recently, but like, you know, how much stuff had to die.

2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:38.520
 Maybe it was you.

2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:39.520
 Yeah.

2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:48.440
 So we were talking about life and I guess a lot of murder had to occur.

2:58:48.440 --> 2:58:49.440
 Right.

2:58:49.440 --> 2:58:52.240
 So selection means things had to be weeded out, right?

2:58:52.240 --> 2:58:53.240
 So.

2:58:53.240 --> 2:58:54.240
 Well, we can celebrate that.

2:58:54.240 --> 2:58:55.240
 Death makes way for a tool.

2:58:55.240 --> 2:58:56.240
 Yeah.

2:58:56.240 --> 2:59:00.160
 I mean, and also, you know, one of the most interesting features of major extinction

2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:06.000
 events in the history of our planet is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?

2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:09.680
 So and of course, you know, a lot of people make arguments, we wouldn't be here if the

2:59:09.680 --> 2:59:10.880
 dinosaurs didn't go extinct.

2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:16.680
 So in some ways, we can attribute our existence to all of that.

2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:22.640
 But I guess I was just wondering in sort of like, if I was going to build a universe myself

2:59:22.640 --> 2:59:25.120
 in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?

2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:26.120
 But it does seem to be a universe.

2:59:26.120 --> 2:59:27.120
 I think you have to.

2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:31.280
 I mean, I think we're, I think we're probably being over anthropomorphizing.

2:59:31.280 --> 2:59:34.640
 I remember watching the blue, I think it was the blue planet, David Attenborough was showing

2:59:34.640 --> 2:59:38.760
 these seals and because of climate change, some seals were falling off a cliff and how

2:59:38.760 --> 2:59:39.760
 tragic that was.

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:42.880
 I was like, I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool.

2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:44.400
 Look at, look at those ones down there.

2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:48.120
 They've obviously got some kind of mutations some and they're not doing that dark thing.

2:59:48.120 --> 2:59:51.360
 And so that, that, that poor gene will be weeded out.

2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:54.880
 Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.

2:59:54.880 --> 2:59:58.280
 And of course, as human beings have the ability to abstract and we empathize, we don't want

2:59:58.280 --> 3:00:02.520
 to cause suffering on other human beings and we should retain that, but we shouldn't look

3:00:02.520 --> 3:00:07.800
 back in time and say, you know, how many butterflies had to die?

3:00:07.800 --> 3:00:14.160
 I remember making this, how many, if you think about the caterpillar, become the chrysalis

3:00:14.160 --> 3:00:18.800
 and then the butterfly getting out, how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering.

3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:22.960
 If that process of pruning had not occurred, we have no butterflies.

3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:26.760
 So none of the butterfly beauty in the world without all that pruning.

3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:32.400
 So pruning is required, but we shouldn't anthropomorphize and feel sorry for the biological entities.

3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:37.040
 Because that's, that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.

3:00:37.040 --> 3:00:41.960
 What we should do is project forward and maybe think about what values we have across our

3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:45.120
 species and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings.

3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:50.520
 You know, you know, now that we know that animals suffer at some level, think about

3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:51.520
 humane farming.

3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:55.400
 When we find that plants can, in fact, are conscious and can think and have pain, then

3:00:55.400 --> 3:00:58.800
 we'll do humane gardening.

3:00:58.800 --> 3:01:00.800
 Until that point, we won't do it, right?

3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:02.560
 I like this.

3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:07.520
 Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature of murder.

3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:10.640
 That's the title.

3:01:10.640 --> 3:01:12.160
 I didn't say that, but it's okay.

3:01:12.160 --> 3:01:13.840
 Well, I just insert it.

3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:17.880
 I have a hard time with it, though, I think the way you put it, it's kind of...

3:01:17.880 --> 3:01:23.240
 But it's the reality of, it's the reality of, it is beautiful.

3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:28.960
 You know, there's an Instagram account called natures metal and I keep following it on following

3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:32.080
 it because I can't handle it for prolonged periods of time.

3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:33.080
 We evolve together.

3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:34.080
 You dialogue.

3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:35.080
 Yeah.

3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:36.080
 Well...

3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:37.080
 We evolve together.

3:01:37.080 --> 3:01:38.080
 Well, you die alone.

3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:39.080
 So I...

3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:40.080
 You live alone, too.

3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:41.080
 It's a Gatsby thing.

3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:42.080
 I don't know.

3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:43.080
 We evolve together.

3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:44.080
 Where's the together?

3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:45.080
 The together is the murder.

3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:46.080
 The population.

3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:47.080
 And the sex and murder.

3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:48.080
 The sex and murder.

3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:49.080
 I just try to like...

3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:52.680
 My romantic vision of it to try to make me happy, Sarah, instead of sad, Sarah.

3:01:52.680 --> 3:01:58.720
 I talk in third person when I think very abstractly, sorry, is, you know, like this whole,

3:01:58.720 --> 3:02:02.960
 like, you know, like certain things can coexist, so the universe is trying to maximize existence,

3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:09.320
 but there's some things that just aren't the most productive trajectory together, but

3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:13.800
 it doesn't mean that they don't exist on another timeline or another chain somewhere

3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:14.800
 else.

3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:15.800
 Like, I like...

3:02:15.800 --> 3:02:19.280
 And maybe you would call that like, then some kind of multiverse or things, but what

3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:20.280
 am I saying?

3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:21.280
 I think you can't.

3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:22.800
 I just, you can't go down a level.

3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:23.800
 I'm just making stuff up.

3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:24.800
 No, you're not.

3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:25.800
 I think...

3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:26.800
 I don't understand.

3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:28.800
 Is it logical and we need...

3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:29.800
 No, I know, I know.

3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:33.920
 Yeah, if you look at bacteria, if you look at virus, I mean, just the number of organisms

3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:34.920
 that are constantly...

3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:35.920
 Yeah.

3:02:35.920 --> 3:02:38.520
 Like, looking at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop, like slaughter.

3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:39.520
 Right.

3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:40.520
 So...

3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:41.520
 Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God.

3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:44.800
 I mean, like, there's the whole thing about, like, why is the universe unable to suffering?

3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:45.800
 Individuals don't exist, right?

3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:46.800
 Individuals...

3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:52.760
 So, for this, I think if you think about life as an entity on Earth, right, let's just

3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:53.760
 go back a second.

3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:54.760
 I mean, I like to...

3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:55.760
 I'll be ludicrous for a second.

3:02:55.760 --> 3:02:56.760
 I don't exist.

3:02:56.760 --> 3:02:59.440
 You don't exist, right?

3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:02.560
 But the actions you do, the product of evolution exists, right?

3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:07.600
 The objects you create exist quantitatively in the real world.

3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:11.640
 If you then understand life on Earth, or alien life, or any life in the universe as this

3:03:11.640 --> 3:03:17.520
 integrated entity where you need cells in your body to die, otherwise, you'd just get

3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:20.840
 really big and you wouldn't be able to walk around, right?

3:03:20.840 --> 3:03:23.080
 So, you know, you do.

3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:24.080
 Yeah.

3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:25.080
 Yeah.

3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:26.080
 So, I think...

3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:29.400
 It's the patterns that persist, not the physical things.

3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:31.880
 And of course, we, you know, we have...

3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:36.160
 We place immense values on fellow human beings, and I'm...

3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:39.160
 Majestic professor does like other individual human beings, or...

3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:40.720
 Now you're talking in third person, too.

3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:41.720
 I know.

3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:42.720
 It happens, right?

3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:48.160
 So death, would you say, I mean, because you said evolution is a fundamental part of life.

3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:50.920
 So death is a fundamental part of life.

3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:51.920
 Yeah.

3:03:51.920 --> 3:03:57.400
 So right now, it might not be in the future, we might hack some aspects of death, and we're

3:03:57.400 --> 3:03:58.640
 evolving different ways.

3:03:58.640 --> 3:03:59.640
 But isn't there...

3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:04.400
 I think Sarah mentioned like this life density.

3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:05.400
 Is it...

3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:06.400
 Can't that become a problem?

3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:11.360
 Like too much bureaucracy, too much baggage builds up.

3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:12.360
 Like you need to keep...

3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:15.040
 I think it's okay that we dissipate.

3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:16.960
 Like, I don't think of it like...

3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:17.960
 Disappear.

3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:18.960
 Yes.

3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:23.200
 Like, we're so fixated on ourselves as individuals and agents.

3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:26.040
 And we were talking about this last night, actually, over dinner.

3:04:26.040 --> 3:04:30.320
 But like, you know, an individual persists for a certain amount of time.

3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:34.720
 But what you want to do, like, if you're really concerned with immortality, is not to live

3:04:34.720 --> 3:04:37.840
 indefinitely as an individual, but maximize your causal impact.

3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:41.280
 So like, what are the traces of you that are left?

3:04:41.280 --> 3:04:42.600
 And you're still a real...

3:04:42.600 --> 3:04:47.720
 I always think of Einstein, like, for a period of time, he was a real physical thing we would

3:04:47.720 --> 3:04:52.000
 identify as a human, and now we just see echoes of that human in all of the ways that we talk

3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:55.840
 about his, you know, causal impact, or frankly, right, is another great example.

3:04:55.840 --> 3:04:58.240
 How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future?

3:04:58.240 --> 3:04:59.960
 Like, oh, I got you.

3:04:59.960 --> 3:05:05.400
 So I guess the question is, how much do you want to control the localization of certain

3:05:05.400 --> 3:05:11.760
 features of, say, a packet of propagating information we might call person, and keep

3:05:11.760 --> 3:05:14.600
 them localized to one individual physical structure?

3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:18.560
 Do you want to, you know, is there a time when that just becomes a dissipated feature

3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:22.080
 of the society that it once existed in?

3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:25.560
 And I'm okay with the dissipated feature, because I just think that makes more room

3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:28.320
 for more creativity in the future.

3:05:28.320 --> 3:05:31.680
 So you mentioned engineering life in the lab.

3:05:31.680 --> 3:05:36.080
 Let me take you to Computer Science World.

3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:38.160
 What about robots?

3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:42.560
 So is it possible to engineer...

3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:50.040
 You're really talking about, like, engineering life at the chemistry level.

3:05:50.040 --> 3:05:56.520
 But do you think it's possible to engineer a life at the, like, humanoid level, at the

3:05:56.520 --> 3:05:58.040
 dog level?

3:05:58.040 --> 3:06:05.000
 Like, at which level can we instill the magic of life into inanimate stuff?

3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:07.160
 No, I think you could do it at every level.

3:06:07.160 --> 3:06:12.880
 I just think that we're particularly interested in chemistry, because it's the origin life

3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:16.960
 transition that, presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it, is going to give you

3:06:16.960 --> 3:06:22.920
 the most interesting or deepest insights into the physics.

3:06:22.920 --> 3:06:27.160
 But presumably everything that we do and build is an example of life, and the question

3:06:27.160 --> 3:06:31.880
 is just how much do you want to take from things that we have now and put them into,

3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:35.280
 like, examples of life and copy them into machines?

3:06:35.280 --> 3:06:40.280
 I saw that there was this tweet again, I think you were at the Mars conference and you were

3:06:40.280 --> 3:06:42.040
 hanging out with a humanoid robot.

3:06:42.040 --> 3:06:43.040
 Yes.

3:06:43.040 --> 3:06:44.040
 That was a fun comment.

3:06:44.040 --> 3:06:46.840
 Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.

3:06:46.840 --> 3:06:52.040
 Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot, or did that accidentally happen?

3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:54.280
 Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi.

3:06:54.280 --> 3:06:57.160
 Torr voice, would that be the correct name for the color?

3:06:57.160 --> 3:06:58.320
 I think so.

3:06:58.320 --> 3:07:00.200
 We didn't color coordinate our outfits.

3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:02.720
 Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did.

3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:03.720
 The robot probably did.

3:07:03.720 --> 3:07:04.720
 Much more stylish.

3:07:04.720 --> 3:07:10.240
 So, for people who are just listening, there's a picture of Sarah standing next to a humanoid

3:07:10.240 --> 3:07:11.240
 robot.

3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:14.640
 I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.

3:07:14.640 --> 3:07:15.640
 Actually, no.

3:07:15.640 --> 3:07:16.640
 I just...

3:07:16.640 --> 3:07:17.640
 Oh, I did.

3:07:17.640 --> 3:07:18.640
 They're perfect.

3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:19.640
 There's a lidar.

3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:20.640
 No.

3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:22.320
 I mean, I think I was just deeply interested because...

3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:24.080
 Sorry to interrupt.

3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:25.120
 Was it manual control?

3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:27.240
 Was it actually stabilizing itself?

3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:28.240
 Oh, no.

3:07:28.240 --> 3:07:29.240
 It was walking around.

3:07:29.240 --> 3:07:30.240
 Oh, nice.

3:07:30.240 --> 3:07:31.240
 Yeah.

3:07:31.240 --> 3:07:32.240
 Nice.

3:07:32.240 --> 3:07:33.240
 It was pretty impressive.

3:07:33.240 --> 3:07:37.640
 But there's some videos online of Jeff Bezos walking with one of those across the lawn

3:07:37.640 --> 3:07:38.640
 nearby there.

3:07:38.640 --> 3:07:39.640
 This is great.

3:07:39.640 --> 3:07:40.640
 Yeah.

3:07:40.640 --> 3:07:41.640
 So...

3:07:41.640 --> 3:07:44.640
 I wasn't invited.

3:07:44.640 --> 3:07:52.160
 Yeah, but there you go, see?

3:07:52.160 --> 3:07:53.520
 That's incredible, isn't it?

3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:54.520
 Yeah.

3:07:54.520 --> 3:07:56.320
 See, you look at the walking robot.

3:07:56.320 --> 3:07:57.840
 Where did the idea for walking come from?

3:07:57.840 --> 3:08:00.200
 What was invented by evolution, right?

3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:03.600
 NASA's human beings able to conceptualize and design and engineer.

3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:04.600
 The causal chain.

3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:07.280
 So that robot is evidence of life.

3:08:07.280 --> 3:08:14.680
 And so I think what's going to happen is we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically.

3:08:14.680 --> 3:08:17.840
 How can you literally go from sand to cells?

3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:19.000
 So that's the first transition.

3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:21.560
 I think there are a number of problems we want to do.

3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:23.200
 Make life in a lab.

3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:24.200
 Great.

3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:27.240
 Then we want to make life in a lab and we want to suddenly start to make intelligent

3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:31.560
 life or life that can start to solve abstract problems.

3:08:31.560 --> 3:08:36.040
 And then we want to make life that is conscious, okay?

3:08:36.040 --> 3:08:37.040
 In that order.

3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:41.000
 I think it has to happen in that order, you know, getting towards this artificial general

3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:42.000
 intelligence.

3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:45.800
 I think that artificial general intelligence can't exist in a vacuum.

3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:49.760
 It has to have a causal chain going all the way back to Luca, right?

3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:54.400
 And so the question I think I really like the question is to say, what are we...

3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:59.120
 How is our pursuit of more and more lifelike?

3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:00.120
 I know you want to...

3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:01.120
 You like robots.

3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:02.120
 You want to project into them.

3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:03.640
 You want to interact with them.

3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:05.720
 I think you would want...

3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:08.560
 If you have a robot dog and a robot dog does everything expected from a normal dog and

3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:12.080
 you can't tell a difference, you're not really going to ask the question anymore if it's

3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:13.080
 a real dog or not.

3:09:13.080 --> 3:09:16.120
 Or if you've got a personality, you're interacting with it.

3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:21.280
 And so I think what would be interesting would be to kind of understand the computational

3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:25.120
 architecture, how that evolves, because you could then, you know, teleport the personality

3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:29.600
 from one object to the other and say, right, is it act the same?

3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:35.680
 And I think that as we go along, we're going to get better and better at integrating our

3:09:35.680 --> 3:09:37.680
 consciousness into machines.

3:09:37.680 --> 3:09:43.040
 Well, let me ask you that question, just to linger on it.

3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:49.760
 I would call that a living conscious thing, potentially, as a human, allegedly, but would

3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.800
 you, as a person, try to define life?

3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:57.040
 If you pass the touring test, are you a life form?

3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:03.040
 One of the reasons I walked up to the robot was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?

3:10:03.040 --> 3:10:10.760
 So it felt like I was, and I base a lot of my interaction with reality on emotion and

3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:13.560
 feeling, but like, how do you feel about an interaction?

3:10:13.560 --> 3:10:16.760
 And I always love your point about like, is it enough to have that shared experience with

3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:17.760
 a robot, right?

3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:21.040
 So, so walking up to it, does it feel like you're interacting with a living thing?

3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:25.800
 And it did to an extent, but in some degrees, it feels like you're interacting with a baby

3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:27.040
 living thing.

3:10:27.040 --> 3:10:31.320
 So I think our relationship with technology in particular robots we build is really interesting

3:10:31.320 --> 3:10:36.600
 because basically, they exist as objects in our future in some sense, like we're a much

3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:42.680
 older evolutionary lineage than robots are, but we're all part of the same causal chain.

3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:48.680
 And presumably, they're kind of in their infancy, so it's almost like you're looking at the

3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:55.360
 future of life when you're looking at them, but it hasn't really become life in a full

3:10:55.360 --> 3:11:00.040
 manifestation of whatever it is that they're going to become.

3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:04.800
 And the more, the example of the walking robot was super interesting, but they also had a

3:11:04.800 --> 3:11:09.560
 dolphin that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars, and it looked just like a real

3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:12.960
 dolphin swimming in the pool.

3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:18.640
 And you know, it's in this kind of uncanny valley because, and I was having this conversation

3:11:18.640 --> 3:11:22.800
 with a gentleman named Mutu who was super perceptive, but he was basically saying like, it made

3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:25.960
 him feel really uncomfortable.

3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:29.640
 And I think, yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response.

3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:33.760
 And I guess my point about it is, it is kind of interesting because you're basically trying

3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:38.440
 to make a thing that you think is nonliving mimic a living thing.

3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:42.880
 And so the thought experiment I would want to run in that case is imagine we replaced

3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:47.240
 every living thing on Earth with a robot equivalent, like all the dolphins and things.

3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:51.040
 And in some sense, then you're making, if you think that the robots aren't experiencing

3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:56.920
 reality, for example, in the way that a biologically evolved thing would, you're basically making

3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:03.800
 the philosophical zombie argument become real and basically building reality into a simulation

3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:07.440
 because you've made everything quote unquote fake in some sense.

3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:11.040
 You've replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.

3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:20.240
 So as opposed to being excited by the possibility of creating something new, you're terrified

3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:22.360
 of humans being replaced.

3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:26.280
 I was just trying to run like, what would be the absolute, you know, thought experiment,

3:12:26.280 --> 3:12:29.440
 but I don't think that scenario would actually play out.

3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:34.320
 I guess what I think is weird for why we feel this kind of uncanny valley interacting with

3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:38.480
 something like the robot dolphin is we're looking at an object we know is kind of in

3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:43.000
 the future in the sense of like, if everything's ordered in time, but it's borrowing from a

3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:45.360
 structure that we have common history with.

3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:50.720
 And it's basically copying in a kind of superficial way, things from one part of the causal chain

3:12:50.720 --> 3:12:51.720
 to another.

3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:52.720
 Yeah.

3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:57.720
 Well, that's, that's a video of every believed it was real.

3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:00.680
 They look so real.

3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:05.200
 And obviously a technology was, was developed for movies, so well, I think we're confusing

3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:09.720
 our emotional response and understanding the causal chain of how we got there, right?

3:13:09.720 --> 3:13:15.040
 Because the philosophical dot zombie argument thinks about objects just appearing, right?

3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:19.360
 That you're facsimile in some way, whereas there is the cause of the chain of events

3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:22.360
 that caused the dolphin to be built went for human being.

3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:25.680
 It would, uh, for South Africa, zombies still have a high assembly index.

3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:26.680
 Yeah.

3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:31.120
 Because it came, it can't be philosophical zombies can't like, like Boltzmann brains

3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:32.680
 just can't appear out of nowhere.

3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:36.000
 Well, I guess my question would be in that, that scenario where you built all the robots

3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:39.320
 and replace everything on earth with robots with the, with the biosphere be as creative

3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:40.800
 under that scenario or not.

3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:45.480
 And so are there, are there quantitative differences you would notice over time?

3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:47.480
 And it's not obvious either way, right?

3:13:47.480 --> 3:13:51.400
 It's not obvious right now because we don't really, we don't understand, we haven't built

3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:52.920
 into machines how we work.

3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:58.040
 So that's, I think that there are one of the big missing things that I think that we're

3:13:58.040 --> 3:13:59.040
 both looking for.

3:13:59.040 --> 3:14:00.040
 This is a robot.

3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:01.040
 It's a cute robot.

3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:04.920
 But the, but the point there is, um, the biosphere won't be as creative if you did it

3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:05.920
 right now.

3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:06.920
 No, of course.

3:14:06.920 --> 3:14:07.920
 I think that's why people don't like it.

3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:17.240
 But in the future, it, we will be able to solve the problem of origin of life, um, intelligence

3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:21.200
 and consciousness, um, because they exist in physical substrates.

3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:26.400
 We just don't understand enough about the material substrate and the causal chain, but

3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:30.200
 I'm very confident we will get to an AGI, but it won't be what people think.

3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:34.120
 It won't be a solution, won't be a, we'll get fooled a lot.

3:14:34.120 --> 3:14:40.040
 And so GPT three is getting better at falling us and GPT 153 might really fall us, but it

3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:42.720
 won't have the magic we're looking for.

3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:48.760
 It won't be a creative, but it will help us understand the differences between what

3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:56.400
 really though, because is not what love is being fooled like what, why, why are you not

3:14:56.400 --> 3:15:02.320
 giving much value to the emotional connection with objects, with, with robots, with humans?

3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:07.200
 Emotion is that thing which happens when you're, when you're the, uh, the funk, your

3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:10.600
 expectation function is, is dashed and something else happens.

3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:11.600
 Right.

3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:13.120
 I mean, that's what emotion is.

3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:14.960
 Is that what love is too?

3:15:14.960 --> 3:15:15.960
 Yeah.

3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:18.840
 I think we're expecting one thing and something else happened.

3:15:18.840 --> 3:15:19.840
 Yeah.

3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:20.840
 I don't know.

3:15:20.840 --> 3:15:21.840
 I don't think that's true either.

3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:22.840
 Well, what is it then?

3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:23.840
 I think no emotion.

3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:24.840
 Look, I'm sorry.

3:15:24.840 --> 3:15:25.840
 Emotion is that, but, but.

3:15:25.840 --> 3:15:27.840
 I think love is just fulfilling your purpose.

3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:30.160
 No, but I'll, can we look like, look.

3:15:30.160 --> 3:15:31.160
 Like whatever that means.

3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:32.160
 I mean, really.

3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:33.160
 So yeah.

3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:34.160
 Okay.

3:15:34.160 --> 3:15:35.160
 So when are you happiest?

3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:36.160
 It's like when you're.

3:15:36.160 --> 3:15:37.160
 All right.

3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:38.160
 All right.

3:15:38.160 --> 3:15:39.160
 Let me go back.

3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:40.160
 If you want to, if you want me to.

3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:41.160
 Follow your bliss.

3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:42.160
 Let me define love quickly.

3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:43.160
 Okay.

3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:44.160
 Go for it.

3:15:44.160 --> 3:15:45.160
 In terms of assembly space, right?

3:15:45.160 --> 3:15:46.160
 Okay.

3:15:46.160 --> 3:15:49.080
 I can't wait till assembly theory one on one is taught and the second lecture is assembly

3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:50.080
 theory of love.

3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:53.720
 No, no, but look, actually, but look, but.

3:15:53.720 --> 3:15:54.720
 It's being surprised.

3:15:54.720 --> 3:15:56.160
 The expectation is being broken.

3:15:56.160 --> 3:15:57.160
 I'm just, I'm not.

3:15:57.160 --> 3:15:58.160
 No, go for it.

3:15:58.160 --> 3:15:59.160
 I want to hear you.

3:15:59.160 --> 3:16:01.720
 I'm not an emotional being, but I would say, so let's talk.

3:16:01.720 --> 3:16:05.560
 So we'll talk about emotion a bit, but love is more complex is love is a very complex set

3:16:05.560 --> 3:16:07.760
 of emotions together and logical stuff.

3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:13.000
 But if you've got this thing, this person that's on this causal chain that has this empathy

3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:18.800
 for this other thing, love is being able to project ahead in your assembly space and work

3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:24.760
 out what your, the person you're in love with has a need for and to do that for them without

3:16:24.760 --> 3:16:25.760
 selflessly.

3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:26.760
 Right.

3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:29.640
 Cause you can project ahead what they're going to need and they are there and you, maybe

3:16:29.640 --> 3:16:33.040
 you can see someone is going to fall over and you catch them before they fall over or

3:16:33.040 --> 3:16:37.000
 maybe you can anticipate that someone's going to be hungry and without helping you, you

3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:38.000
 just help them.

3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:39.000
 That's what.

3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:40.000
 It sounds like empathy.

3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:42.120
 But it's more complex than that, right?

3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:43.120
 It's more complex.

3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:46.240
 It's more about not just empathy, it's understanding.

3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:49.720
 It's about kind of sharing that experience expression of love though.

3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:54.440
 That's not what it's like to feel love like feeling love is like, I like, I think it's

3:16:54.440 --> 3:16:59.160
 like when you're aligned with things that you feel like are your purpose or your reason

3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:00.640
 for existing.

3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:06.280
 So if you have those feelings, uh, towards the robot, why is that rope?

3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:11.920
 I mean, cause you said like the AJ will build an AGI, but it won't, there'll be a fundamental

3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:12.920
 difference in AGI.

3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:13.920
 I don't think we'll build it.

3:17:13.920 --> 3:17:15.120
 It's going to emerge from our technology.

3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:16.960
 I think you guys all agree with the same thing.

3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:23.600
 I just said that GPT, that we do not correctly capture the causal chain that we have.

3:17:23.600 --> 3:17:24.600
 Within GPT.

3:17:24.600 --> 3:17:25.600
 Yeah.

3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:26.600
 Within AI.

3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:34.000
 Don't you think it captures, because GPT three is fundamentally trained on a corpus of knowledge,

3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:36.040
 you know, like the internet.

3:17:36.040 --> 3:17:40.040
 Don't you think it gets better and better and better capturing the memory of all the.

3:17:40.040 --> 3:17:42.160
 It will be better at falling you.

3:17:42.160 --> 3:17:44.760
 And at some point you won't care.

3:17:44.760 --> 3:17:48.280
 But when it comes, I, my guess, this is a quick, this is what I was getting to you right

3:17:48.280 --> 3:17:51.480
 before we got, I got in the love trap.

3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:52.480
 Love trap.

3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:53.480
 Yeah.

3:17:53.480 --> 3:17:58.640
 It was like cronin in the love trap, you know, um, sounds like a good, good band name.

3:17:58.640 --> 3:17:59.640
 It makes it sad.

3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:00.640
 Okay.

3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:01.640
 It's sad.

3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:02.640
 It's the only space of sad.

3:18:02.640 --> 3:18:07.760
 No, um, is that so short, but I think there are other features that allow it, that we pull

3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:12.640
 on innovation that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT three.

3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:14.360
 So if you're being fooled there.

3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:19.480
 So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability to be surprising and creative.

3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:26.160
 Whereas is it Dali, this thing, or, or if you take, um, GPT three is not going to create

3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:31.880
 a new verb, Shakespeare created new verbs, you're like, wow.

3:18:31.880 --> 3:18:36.680
 And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language in a different domain.

3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:40.960
 So I think having that connections across multiple domains is what you need for AGI.

3:18:40.960 --> 3:18:41.960
 Yeah.

3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:48.640
 But I don't know if you need, um, I don't know if there's any limitations to GPT, GPT,

3:18:48.640 --> 3:18:51.720
 and not being able to be cost domain.

3:18:51.720 --> 3:18:56.760
 The number one problem is, um, it's instantiated and resource limited substrate, um, that we

3:18:56.760 --> 3:19:03.080
 don't, in Silicon, um, it is, it is the, the architectures used for training for learning

3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:07.080
 is about falling, it's not about understanding.

3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:12.800
 And I think that there is some understanding that we have that is not yet symbolically

3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:13.800
 representable.

3:19:13.800 --> 3:19:20.000
 Language, learning language and using language seems to be fundamentally about fooling, not

3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:21.000
 understanding.

3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:23.880
 What, why, um, why do you use language exactly?

3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:27.000
 I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually.

3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:32.120
 Um, but I don't, I, I'm not sure I understand how I'll make a coherent argument for that.

3:19:32.120 --> 3:19:40.760
 But my feeling is that there is, there are, there is comprehension in reality in our consciousness

3:19:40.760 --> 3:19:47.440
 below language and, and we use those for language for all sorts of expressions and we don't yet

3:19:47.440 --> 3:19:49.120
 understand that there's a gap.

3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:53.080
 We will get there, but I'm saying, wouldn't it be interesting as a bit like saying, could

3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:57.240
 I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being?

3:19:57.240 --> 3:19:58.240
 Right.

3:19:58.240 --> 3:20:01.680
 And, and let's just say I could copy all your atoms and the positions of all your atoms

3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:06.000
 and the electrons into, into this other person they would be you.

3:20:06.000 --> 3:20:07.000
 The answer is no.

3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:11.720
 And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory because actually the feature space

3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:16.800
 that you have, that graph, the only way to copy you is to create you on that graph.

3:20:16.800 --> 3:20:20.000
 So everything that's happened to you in your past, we have to have a faithful record for.

3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:22.560
 If you want another copy of Lex, you have to do the exact thing.

3:20:22.560 --> 3:20:27.360
 One other copy of Sarah, one other copy of Lee, the exact past has to be replicated.

3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:28.920
 Let me push back on that a little bit.

3:20:28.920 --> 3:20:34.520
 That's maybe from an assembly theory perspective, but it, I don't think it's that difficult

3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:40.640
 to recreate a version of me like a clone that would make everybody exactly equally

3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:43.320
 as happy.

3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:44.880
 Like they wouldn't care which one.

3:20:44.880 --> 3:20:49.840
 And like there's two of me and then they get to pick which one and they'll kill either

3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:50.840
 one.

3:20:50.840 --> 3:20:52.360
 They'll be fine as long as they're forced to kill.

3:20:52.360 --> 3:20:53.360
 They'll be fine.

3:20:53.360 --> 3:20:56.920
 But here's what will happen is let's say we make artificial Lex and it was like, wow,

3:20:56.920 --> 3:20:57.920
 so cool.

3:20:57.920 --> 3:20:58.920
 We're going to interact.

3:20:58.920 --> 3:21:01.360
 Then there'll be this battle of like, right, we're going to tell the difference.

3:21:01.360 --> 3:21:07.960
 We're going to, we're going to basically keep nudging Lex and artificial Lex until we get

3:21:07.960 --> 3:21:11.120
 in novelty from one and we'll kill the other one.

3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:12.120
 And I think, thank God.

3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:14.600
 We're not novelty is a fuzzy concept.

3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:16.520
 That's the whole problem of novelty.

3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:19.320
 So I will define novelty is not fuzzy.

3:21:19.320 --> 3:21:28.760
 Availability is the ability for you to create architectures that are or create an architecture.

3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:31.680
 So let's say you've got corpus of architectures known, you can write down, you've got some

3:21:31.680 --> 3:21:36.600
 distance measure and then I create a new one and the distance measure so far away from

3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:43.880
 what you'd expected is there's no linear algebra we're going to get there is like that is creativity

3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:47.200
 and we don't know how to do that yet on any level.

3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:50.640
 Well, I was also thinking about like your argument about free will, like you wouldn't

3:21:50.640 --> 3:21:53.640
 be able to know it was, it doesn't work instantaneously.

3:21:53.640 --> 3:21:57.960
 It's not like a micro level thing, but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories

3:21:57.960 --> 3:21:59.240
 or longer term decisions.

3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:05.040
 So if you think that the novelty manifests over those longer timescales, it might be

3:22:05.040 --> 3:22:12.160
 the two Lex's diverge quite a bit over certain timescales of their behavior, but nobody would

3:22:12.160 --> 3:22:15.200
 notice the difference.

3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:20.520
 They might not and the universe, the earth won't notice the difference, the universe

3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:21.520
 won't notice the difference.

3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:22.520
 Universe would notice the difference.

3:22:22.520 --> 3:22:26.320
 No, the universe doesn't know about its novelty, there's being generated, it's the whole point

3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:27.320
 of novelty.

3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:29.400
 Yeah, but this is what selection is, right?

3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:34.840
 It's like taking nearly equivalent ones and then deciding like the universe selects, right?

3:22:34.840 --> 3:22:38.040
 So whatever selection is, select some things to persist in time.

3:22:38.040 --> 3:22:41.960
 Yeah, it's going to select the artificial one, just because it likes that one better.

3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:43.800
 Well, you're mixing up two arguments here.

3:22:43.800 --> 3:22:45.400
 Let's go back a second.

3:22:45.400 --> 3:22:47.320
 What are you basing this argument on, like?

3:22:47.320 --> 3:22:53.880
 I'm just saying that I kind of don't think, because at least said that it's not possible,

3:22:53.880 --> 3:23:00.080
 like if you copy every single molecule in a person's body, that's not going to be the

3:23:00.080 --> 3:23:07.200
 same person, that they won't have the same assembly index, it won't be the same person.

3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:13.440
 I just don't, I think copying, you can compress, not only do I disagree with that, I think

3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:17.880
 you can even compress a person down to some, where you can fool the universe.

3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:25.000
 I'm saying, let me restate it, it is not possible to copy somebody on, because you, unless

3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:26.880
 you copy the causal history.

3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:31.160
 Also, you can't have two identical, I mean, actually I really like the idea that everything

3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:32.160
 in the universe is unique.

3:23:32.160 --> 3:23:33.680
 So even if like, there were two lexists.

3:23:33.680 --> 3:23:36.920
 I know you like that idea, because you're human and you think you're unique.

3:23:36.920 --> 3:23:37.920
 Yeah, exactly.

3:23:37.920 --> 3:23:41.560
 But also I can make a logical argument for it, that even if we could copy, you know,

3:23:41.560 --> 3:23:44.800
 all of your molecules in all their positions, the other you would be there, and you have

3:23:44.800 --> 3:23:47.800
 a different position in space.

3:23:47.800 --> 3:23:48.800
 You're distinguishable.

3:23:48.800 --> 3:23:49.960
 Yeah, the other thing I was going to add.

3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:53.040
 How unique are you, just by the position in space, really?

3:23:53.040 --> 3:24:00.280
 Sure, but then how much does that light translation of lex, that's not an interesting, I see.

3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:02.520
 But no, wait a minute.

3:24:02.520 --> 3:24:07.800
 Is part of the definition of something being interesting is how much it affects the future?

3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:08.800
 Yes.

3:24:08.800 --> 3:24:09.800
 Yes.

3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:10.800
 But let me come back to it.

3:24:10.800 --> 3:24:11.800
 Do you disagree?

3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:12.800
 Do you disagree?

3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:13.800
 One point quickly that you were making.

3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:14.800
 Sure.

3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:15.800
 I think I probably agree.

3:24:15.800 --> 3:24:16.800
 Yes.

3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:17.800
 There's two lexists, right?

3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:21.200
 There's a robot lex that you just basically, it's a, it's a, it is a charade.

3:24:21.200 --> 3:24:26.800
 It's a facsimile, it's just coded to emulate you.

3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:28.800
 Are you a robot lex?

3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:29.800
 I would know, right?

3:24:29.800 --> 3:24:30.800
 But let's get there.

3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:31.800
 That's the point.

3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:36.120
 That's a very important point here, because he's ducking and diving between this eye.

3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:42.880
 So if I facsimile you into a robot, then it would, your robot might be, would be a representation

3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:45.800
 of you now, but fundamentally be boring because you're going to have other ideas.

3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:50.200
 If however you built an architecture, there's itself was capable of generating novelty.

3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:54.120
 You would diverge in your causal chain and you're both be equally interesting to interact

3:24:54.120 --> 3:24:55.120
 with.

3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:56.120
 Yeah.

3:24:56.120 --> 3:24:57.120
 We don't know that mechanism.

3:24:57.120 --> 3:24:58.640
 All I'm trying to say is we don't yet know that mechanism.

3:24:58.640 --> 3:25:01.400
 We do not know the mechanism that generates novelty.

3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:07.360
 But at the moment in our AIs, we are emulating, we are not generating.

3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:08.920
 You don't think we're sneaking up on that?

3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:09.920
 No.

3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:10.920
 Do you think there's a fun one?

3:25:10.920 --> 3:25:11.920
 No, no.

3:25:11.920 --> 3:25:12.920
 There is no ghost in the machine.

3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:15.200
 And I want there to be one.

3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:16.200
 I want the same thing.

3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:17.200
 You want, sorry.

3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:22.240
 I know you want that as a human because everything you just said makes you feel more special.

3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:24.440
 I want to be, no, no, screw my specialness.

3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:26.200
 I just want to be surprised.

3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:27.200
 If I,

3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:28.360
 You don't think a robot can surprise you?

3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:34.560
 If I, if you can produce an algorithm instantiated in a robot, surprise me, I will, I will, I

3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:38.840
 will, I will have one of those robots to be brilliant, but they won't, it won't surprise

3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:39.840
 me.

3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:44.640
 But why, why is it a problem to think that humans are special?

3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:45.640
 Maybe it's not the special.

3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:46.640
 You're right.

3:25:46.640 --> 3:25:47.640
 It's the better than.

3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:48.640
 Yes.

3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:54.120
 Because then you start to not recognize the magic in other life forms that you either

3:25:54.120 --> 3:26:00.080
 have created or you have observed, because I just think there is magic in, uh, legged

3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:03.400
 robots moving about and they are full of surprises.

3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:04.400
 Yeah.

3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:05.400
 So this is.

3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:06.400
 Infectionality.

3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:07.400
 Yeah.

3:26:07.400 --> 3:26:12.880
 So I'm a little, uh, I know where you like cellular automata, right, but the, the specialness

3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:18.160
 in your robot comes from the roboticist that built it.

3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:19.160
 Yeah.

3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:20.160
 Yeah.

3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:21.160
 It's part of the lineage.

3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:22.160
 Yeah.

3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:23.160
 And so that's fine.

3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:24.160
 Yeah.

3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:26.520
 That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot was I was looking at four billion years

3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:27.520
 of evolution.

3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:28.520
 Yeah.

3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:29.520
 Right.

3:26:29.520 --> 3:26:30.520
 If it wasn't, so I think I'm happy.

3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:31.520
 I mean, I'm happy.

3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:32.520
 We're going to coexist.

3:26:32.520 --> 3:26:33.520
 I'm just saying you're going to get more excitement.

3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:36.480
 There's something missing in our understanding of intelligence.

3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:40.960
 Intelligence isn't just training, uh, the way the neural network is conceived right now

3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:44.160
 is great and it's lovely and it'll be better and we will argue forever.

3:26:44.160 --> 3:26:49.600
 But you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said, look, I know how to invent an architecture

3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:51.080
 and I can give it a soul.

3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:57.560
 And what I mean by a soul is some, I know for real that there is internal reference

3:26:57.560 --> 3:27:01.080
 as soon as I'm not fake internal reference.

3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:04.160
 And if we could generate that mechanism for internal reference, that's why our goal to

3:27:04.160 --> 3:27:05.160
 that direct.

3:27:05.160 --> 3:27:06.160
 That's why you have to do that.

3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:07.160
 We can do that.

3:27:07.160 --> 3:27:08.160
 That's for goal directness.

3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:09.160
 Yeah.

3:27:09.160 --> 3:27:10.160
 Get that goal directness.

3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:13.200
 You would love that robot more than the one that's just made to look like it does because

3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:17.960
 you'll have more fun with it because you better generate search other problems, get

3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:18.960
 more novelty.

3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:24.680
 You'll be able to fall in love with that robot for real, but not the one that's faking it.

3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:26.520
 What about fake it till you make it?

3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:32.960
 Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with, um, with, with fake humans.

3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:33.960
 Yeah.

3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:38.120
 It's nice to, it's nice to fall in love with something that's full of novelty.

3:27:38.120 --> 3:27:39.120
 Yes.

3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:43.280
 I, you know, I could imagine all kinds of robots that I would want to have a close relationship

3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:45.560
 with and I don't mean like sexual.

3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:47.760
 I mean like intimacy.

3:27:47.760 --> 3:27:57.440
 I just don't think that, um, novelty generation is such a special, okay, there's like mathematical

3:27:57.440 --> 3:27:58.920
 novelty or something like that.

3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:02.900
 And then there's just humans being surprised and I think we're easily surprised.

3:28:02.900 --> 3:28:03.900
 That's fine.

3:28:03.900 --> 3:28:05.400
 But that's that, but you don't think that's a good definition.

3:28:05.400 --> 3:28:06.400
 No, that's good.

3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:12.520
 I'm happy to be surprised, um, but not globally surprised because someone else, but I really

3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:18.000
 want, I was why, why I'm a scientist, I really want to be the first to be surprised about

3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:22.520
 something and the first thing in the first in the universe to create that novelty and

3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:26.440
 to know for sure that that novelty has never occurred anywhere else.

3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:27.440
 That's a real buzz.

3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:28.440
 Right.

3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:29.440
 So wait to really know that.

3:28:29.440 --> 3:28:31.160
 I, I, you have to have a really big lookup tape.

3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:32.160
 Right.

3:28:32.160 --> 3:28:33.160
 Yeah.

3:28:33.160 --> 3:28:34.160
 You're never going to be no for sure.

3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:35.160
 Right.

3:28:35.160 --> 3:28:38.160
 That's, that's one of the hard things about being and scientists searching for this type

3:28:38.160 --> 3:28:39.160
 of novelty.

3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:44.720
 And that's why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery, but actually they are creating

3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:49.480
 and then when they to create a new, um, uh, mathematical structure that they can then

3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:53.440
 take, you can, you can write code to work out whether there's, whether that structure

3:28:53.440 --> 3:28:54.960
 exists before that.

3:28:54.960 --> 3:28:58.520
 That's almost why I would love to have been a mathematician from that regard to invent

3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:03.720
 new math that really I know pretty much for sure to not exist, does not exist anywhere

3:29:03.720 --> 3:29:04.720
 else in the universe.

3:29:04.720 --> 3:29:05.720
 Cause it's so contingent.

3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:06.720
 Right.

3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:10.160
 So like you are, you said a few times that I still really don't understand how you actually

3:29:10.160 --> 3:29:14.880
 plan to do this, to build an experiment that detects how the universe is generating novelty

3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:16.880
 or that time is the mechanism.

3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:20.960
 So the, the problem that we all have, which I think is what Lex is pushing against is

3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:24.720
 if I build the experiment, you don't know what you put into it.

3:29:24.720 --> 3:29:29.440
 So you don't know what, like if you, unless you can quantify everything you put in, all

3:29:29.440 --> 3:29:35.320
 of your agency, all the boundary conditions, you don't know if you somehow bias it in some

3:29:35.320 --> 3:29:36.320
 way.

3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:40.120
 So is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment or to that robot, or is it something

3:29:40.120 --> 3:29:43.880
 you gave it, but you didn't realize it's going to be, it's going to asymptote towards

3:29:43.880 --> 3:29:44.880
 that, right?

3:29:44.880 --> 3:29:47.480
 You're never going to know for sure, but you can start to take out, you know, you can

3:29:47.480 --> 3:29:52.840
 use good Bayesian approaches and just keep updating and updating and updating until you

3:29:52.840 --> 3:29:54.840
 point to one sense of purposes.

3:29:54.840 --> 3:29:57.640
 So you want to bound on how much novelty generation it could be.

3:29:57.640 --> 3:29:58.640
 Yeah.

3:29:58.640 --> 3:29:59.640
 Got it.

3:29:59.640 --> 3:30:04.680
 So the ability to generate novelty is correlated with high assembly index with assembly index.

3:30:04.680 --> 3:30:05.680
 Yeah.

3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:11.640
 Because the space of possibilities is bigger.

3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:14.600
 So that's the key.

3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:18.560
 This could be a good, so we're running joke of like why Lex is single.

3:30:18.560 --> 3:30:27.200
 This could be a good part for, so what you're looking for in a robot partner is ability

3:30:27.200 --> 3:30:33.680
 to generate novelty.

3:30:33.680 --> 3:30:39.040
 And that's, I suppose you would say it's a good definition of intelligence too.

3:30:39.040 --> 3:30:47.720
 Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept.

3:30:47.720 --> 3:30:49.120
 Is creativity better?

3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:50.120
 Yeah.

3:30:50.120 --> 3:30:52.200
 I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy.

3:30:52.200 --> 3:30:54.640
 It's kind of the same.

3:30:54.640 --> 3:30:57.920
 Maybe that's why aliens haven't come yet is because we're not creating enough novelty.

3:30:57.920 --> 3:31:01.360
 Like there's some kind of a hierarchy of novelty in the university.

3:31:01.360 --> 3:31:04.200
 Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right?

3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:07.800
 So it's a very passive thing, but I guess I would remember by saying creativity is I

3:31:07.800 --> 3:31:08.800
 think it's much more active.

3:31:08.800 --> 3:31:12.840
 Like you think there's like a mechanism of like the things that exist are generating

3:31:12.840 --> 3:31:14.200
 the creativity.

3:31:14.200 --> 3:31:18.240
 Novelty seems to be there's some spontaneous production and it's completely decoupled from

3:31:18.240 --> 3:31:19.240
 the things that exist.

3:31:19.240 --> 3:31:20.240
 No, I understand.

3:31:20.240 --> 3:31:22.720
 I think it's really good.

3:31:22.720 --> 3:31:26.280
 Creativity is the mechanism and novelty is the observable.

3:31:26.280 --> 3:31:27.520
 Yeah.

3:31:27.520 --> 3:31:32.560
 You could just be surprised your model of the world was broken and not necessarily in

3:31:32.560 --> 3:31:33.560
 a positive way.

3:31:33.560 --> 3:31:34.560
 That's surprise.

3:31:34.560 --> 3:31:35.560
 So there's three things now.

3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:36.560
 Let's go back to school.

3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:37.560
 Right.

3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:38.560
 Let's go.

3:31:38.560 --> 3:31:41.040
 You've got surprise, which is basically, I mean, I'm surprised all the time because

3:31:41.040 --> 3:31:42.040
 I don't read very much.

3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:43.040
 I'm pretty dumb.

3:31:43.040 --> 3:31:44.040
 I was like, oh, wow.

3:31:44.040 --> 3:31:48.080
 I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas and I was really surprised by

3:31:48.080 --> 3:31:49.080
 that.

3:31:49.080 --> 3:31:51.360
 And then when looking at literature properly and it's there, so surprise.

3:31:51.360 --> 3:31:56.080
 That's to the extent that you don't have full information.

3:31:56.080 --> 3:32:04.480
 The act of pushing on that kind of on the causal structure and novelty, which is measuring

3:32:04.480 --> 3:32:05.480
 that degree.

3:32:05.480 --> 3:32:06.480
 Right.

3:32:06.480 --> 3:32:09.680
 So I think that's pretty well defined in that regard.

3:32:09.680 --> 3:32:13.600
 So you want your robot, I mean, and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet

3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:19.600
 and the printing press share some, I actually think creativity has dropped a bit since the

3:32:19.600 --> 3:32:23.160
 internet because everyone's just, you know, just regurgitating stuff.

3:32:23.160 --> 3:32:27.240
 But of course, now it's beginning to accelerate again because everyone is using this tool

3:32:27.240 --> 3:32:31.280
 to be creative and boom, it's exploding.

3:32:31.280 --> 3:32:34.840
 I think that's what happens when you create these new technologies.

3:32:34.840 --> 3:32:36.080
 That's really helpful.

3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:38.080
 There's a difference between novelty and surprise.

3:32:38.080 --> 3:32:39.080
 Okay.

3:32:39.080 --> 3:32:41.080
 I think I was thinking about surprise.

3:32:41.080 --> 3:32:44.000
 If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit, it'd be great.

3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:45.000
 Robot surprises me.

3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:46.000
 You know.

3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:47.000
 Experiment that surprises you.

3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:48.000
 Yeah.

3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:49.560
 I mean, that's why I love doing experiments because I'm, I can't.

3:32:49.560 --> 3:32:50.560
 It's still exciting.

3:32:50.560 --> 3:32:51.560
 Yeah.

3:32:51.560 --> 3:32:52.560
 Surprise is exciting.

3:32:52.560 --> 3:32:53.560
 Yeah.

3:32:53.560 --> 3:32:54.560
 Even negative surprise.

3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:56.560
 Like some people love drama in relationships.

3:32:56.560 --> 3:33:01.080
 Like, it's like, why the hell, why did you do this?

3:33:01.080 --> 3:33:02.080
 That can be exciting.

3:33:02.080 --> 3:33:07.000
 I could imagine companies selling updates to their companion robots that just basically

3:33:07.000 --> 3:33:10.120
 generate negative surprise, just to, just spice things up a bit.

3:33:10.120 --> 3:33:11.120
 Yeah.

3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:12.120
 It's the push and pull.

3:33:12.120 --> 3:33:14.000
 That's, that's one of the components of love.

3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:16.320
 As you said, love is a complicated thing.

3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:17.320
 Oh, beauty.

3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:20.880
 I wanted to mention this because you also tweeted, I think this was Sarah.

3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:22.160
 No, it might have been Lee.

3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:23.160
 I don't remember.

3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:26.920
 But it was a survey published in Nature showing that scientists find.

3:33:26.920 --> 3:33:27.920
 Help me, yeah.

3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:28.920
 Yeah.

3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:36.160
 Anyway, there's a, there's a plot, published in Nature of what scientists find beautiful

3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:39.320
 in their work and it separates biologists and physicists.

3:33:39.320 --> 3:33:45.640
 It'd be nice if you showed the full plot and there's simplicity, elegance, hidden order,

3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:49.680
 inner logic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony, and so on.

3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:53.040
 Is there any interesting things that stand out to you?

3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:57.640
 I think the fact that biologists like complexity and pleasing colors.

3:33:57.640 --> 3:34:00.760
 Oh, there's pleasing colors on there.

3:34:00.760 --> 3:34:01.760
 Yeah.

3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:02.760
 Or shapes.

3:34:02.760 --> 3:34:03.760
 Or shapes.

3:34:03.760 --> 3:34:08.120
 And then physicists obviously love simplicity above all else.

3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:09.120
 Simplicity, elegance.

3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:10.120
 Yeah.

3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:16.800
 They love symmetry and then biologists love complexity and, well, they just love a little

3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:17.800
 bit less.

3:34:17.800 --> 3:34:20.800
 They love everything a little bit less, but complexity a little bit more.

3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:21.800
 A little bit more.

3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:22.800
 That's so interesting.

3:34:22.800 --> 3:34:24.800
 And pleasing colors or shapes.

3:34:24.800 --> 3:34:28.640
 Do you think it's a useful, I forget what your tweet was that this is missing some of

3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:29.640
 the, some of the.

3:34:29.640 --> 3:34:36.560
 Oh, no, I think it's because I think about how explanations become causal to our future.

3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:44.520
 So I have this whole philosophy that the theories we build and the way we describe reality should

3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:52.840
 be have the largest breadth of possibilities for the future of what we can accomplish.

3:34:52.840 --> 3:34:57.040
 So in some sense, it's not like Occam's razor is not for simplicity.

3:34:57.040 --> 3:35:00.240
 It's for optimism or the kind of future you can build.

3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:05.080
 And so I think, I think you have to think this way when you're thinking about life and

3:35:05.080 --> 3:35:09.160
 alien life, because ultimately we're trying to build, I mean, science is just basically

3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:11.120
 our narratives about reality.

3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:14.040
 And now you're building a narrative that is what we are as physical systems.

3:35:14.040 --> 3:35:17.360
 It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible because it's basically going to

3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:20.160
 shape the future trajectory where we're going.

3:35:20.160 --> 3:35:26.040
 And we don't use that as a heuristic in theory building because we think theories are about

3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:28.920
 predicting features of the world, not causing them.

3:35:28.920 --> 3:35:31.960
 But if you look at the history of all of the development of human thought, it's caused

3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:33.120
 the things that happen next.

3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:36.480
 So it's not just about looking at the world and observing it.

3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:43.800
 It's about actually that feedback loop that's missing and it's not in any of those categories.

3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:53.600
 What do you think is the most beautiful idea in the physics of life, in the chemistry of

3:35:53.600 --> 3:36:03.920
 life, in this, through all your exploration with assembly theory, what is the thing that

3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:11.800
 made you step back and say this idea is beautiful or potentially beautiful?

3:36:11.800 --> 3:36:14.360
 For me, it's that the universe is a creative place.

3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:20.280
 I guess I want to think, and whether it's true or not, is that we are special in some

3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:26.080
 way and it's not like an arbitrary, added on epiphenomenon or ad hoc feature of the universe

3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:31.280
 that we exist, but it's something deep and intrinsic to the structure of reality.

3:36:31.280 --> 3:36:35.720
 And to me, the most beautiful ideas that come out of that is that the reason we exist is

3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:42.760
 for the universe to generate more things and to think about itself and use that as a mechanism

3:36:42.760 --> 3:36:47.240
 for creating more stuff.

3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:48.240
 That's for me.

3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:57.400
 So the life that this, however common it is, is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part

3:36:57.400 --> 3:36:59.840
 of this universe, at least, that we live in.

3:36:59.840 --> 3:37:00.840
 I think so.

3:37:00.840 --> 3:37:06.760
 It's always interesting to me because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity,

3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:11.160
 and they're supposed to be our most fundamental theories right now, and they describe things

3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:15.880
 like the interaction of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate or all these

3:37:15.880 --> 3:37:20.520
 kind of features, and they're these really deep theories, and they tell us a lot about

3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:24.960
 how reality works, but they're completely agnostic to our existence, and I can't help

3:37:24.960 --> 3:37:29.520
 but think that whatever describes us has to be even deeper than that.

3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:35.400
 And I think incorporating memory, I guess, or causality, whatever the term you want to

3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:38.840
 use into the physics view of the world might be taking a step forward.

3:37:38.840 --> 3:37:40.840
 That's the easiest way to do it.

3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:44.720
 It's the cleanest, so here we go again with the physicist, I'm a physicist, the cleanest,

3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:50.200
 I was going to say the simplest, most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of ways that

3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:56.760
 we have these paradoxes associated with life when you, it's not that life is not, current

3:37:56.760 --> 3:38:01.960
 physics is not incompatible with life, but it doesn't explain life, and then you want

3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:06.840
 to know where are the explanatory gaps, and this idea that we have an assembly that time

3:38:06.840 --> 3:38:12.880
 is fundamental and objects actually are extended in time, and have physical extent in time

3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:16.640
 is the cleanest way of resolving a lot of the explanatory gaps.

3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:24.320
 So I've been, I struggle with assembly theory for many years because I could see this gap,

3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:30.920
 and I think when I first met Sarah, and we realized we were kind of talking about the

3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:35.800
 same problem, but we were, we understood none of the language, it was quite hilarious actually

3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:40.240
 because it's like, I've no idea what you're talking about, but I think it sounds right.

3:38:40.240 --> 3:38:45.520
 So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory is I realized the assembly theory explains

3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:51.440
 why the universe, why life is a universe developing a memory, but not only that poetically, I

3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:57.840
 could actually go measure it, and I was like, holy shit, we just, we physically measured

3:38:57.840 --> 3:39:01.960
 this thing, this abstract thing, and we could measure it.

3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:08.440
 And not only could we measure it, but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.

3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:14.280
 And because, I mean, you know, I think as a kind of inventing this together with Sarah

3:39:14.280 --> 3:39:20.520
 and her team, I thought there was a quite a high chance that, you know, we're doing science,

3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:26.400
 there's such a high probability we're wrong, you know, on this, and I remember kind of

3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:35.320
 trying to go to hard physicists, mathematicians, complexity theorists, and everyone just kind

3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:38.040
 of giving me such a hard time about it.

3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:41.600
 And so, you know, this is kind of, this is, you've just done this, you just done that,

3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:45.800
 it's, you know, you've just recapitulated an old theory.

3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:52.240
 And I was unable, I lack the language to really explain, and I had to, it was a real struggle.

3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:58.840
 So this realization that life, what life does that physics cannot understand or chemistry

3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:03.200
 is the universe develops a memory that's causally actionable.

3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:08.560
 And then we can measure it, but it isn't just one thing, there is this intrinsic property

3:40:08.560 --> 3:40:12.560
 of all the objects in the universe, like, like I've said before, but you know, me holding

3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:15.960
 up this water bottle isn't any other water bottle, but it is a sum total of all the water

3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:22.680
 bottles that have existed, right, and will likely change the future of water bottles

3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:23.680
 and for other objects.

3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:33.360
 So it's this kind of, so for me, assembly theory explains the soul in stuff, but it is

3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:37.440
 monology, it's not like Sheldrake's Morphic Resonance, where we have this kind of wooey

3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:43.200
 thing permeating universe is the interaction of objects of other objects and some objects

3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:51.240
 have more instantaneous causal power, that's life, living things, and some objects are

3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:56.520
 the instantaneous output of that causal power, dead objects, but they are part of the lineage.

3:40:56.520 --> 3:40:59.160
 And that for me is fascinating and they're really beautiful.

3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:03.880
 And I think that even if we're determined to be totally wrong, I think it will help

3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:09.080
 us help, hopefully understand what life is and go into tech life elsewhere and make life

3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:10.080
 in the lab.

3:41:10.080 --> 3:41:14.000
 How does that make you feel, by the way, does it make you feel less special that you're

3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:18.080
 so deeply integrated, interconnected to the lineage?

3:41:18.080 --> 3:41:21.480
 I mean, I came on one level, I just wanted it in my life as a scientist, I wanted to

3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:25.480
 have an interesting idea just once or an original idea.

3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:31.040
 I mean, it was like, you know, so I think that was cool that we had this idea and we

3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:36.000
 were playing with it and I think also that I kind of, I mean, it took me ages to realize

3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:40.440
 that Sarah had also had the same kind of form coming towards the same formulation just

3:41:40.440 --> 3:41:45.880
 from a completely different point, but no, it makes me feel special and it also makes

3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:50.840
 me feel connected to the universe, it also makes me feel not just humble about, you

3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:55.640
 know, being a living object in the universe, but the fact that it makes me really optimistic

3:41:55.640 --> 3:42:01.400
 about what the universe is going to do in the future, because we're not just isolated phenomena,

3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:06.440
 we are connected, I will be able to have, you know, one of my small objectives in life

3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:12.120
 is to change the future of the universe in some profound way just by existing.

3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:14.920
 Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.

3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:22.640
 I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely, because I just realized

3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:26.000
 I'm not like, I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure, but I have so much overlap with

3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:31.560
 the other entities I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?

3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:39.800
 And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact on the, how this whole thing unrolls

3:42:39.800 --> 3:42:41.480
 on the future of the world.

3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:43.600
 As individuals, that's, yeah.

3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:45.800
 But I was going to say, local packets of agency.

3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:49.520
 I think we all have a profound impact on the future, some more than others, right?

3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:54.640
 All human beings, all life, and I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege and a way for,

3:42:54.640 --> 3:42:59.840
 you know, to say out to some degree of ego and agency, you know, I'm going to make a

3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:03.280
 computer or make an original life machine or we can do this thing, but actually it's

3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:08.760
 just like, you know, life's probably living, if there is a God or there's a soul in everything,

3:43:08.760 --> 3:43:13.200
 it's really laughing at us going, I fool these guys by giving them ego, so they strive for

3:43:13.200 --> 3:43:18.040
 this stuff and look what it does for, you know, the assembly space of the universe.

3:43:18.040 --> 3:43:21.960
 And there's always a possibility that science can't answer all of it, so that part's challenging

3:43:21.960 --> 3:43:22.960
 for me.

3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:27.120
 There might be a limit to this thing.

3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:33.520
 Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions and I demand relatively short answers.

3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:41.120
 Ali, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:45.280
 Or what's the scary thing that pops to mind?

3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:48.720
 Getting lecture, giving seminars in front of other scientists.

3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:51.760
 Yeah, that is terrifying.

3:43:51.760 --> 3:43:57.760
 If I had more time, I would ask you about the most embarrassing, but we'll spare you.

3:43:57.760 --> 3:44:06.200
 What about you Sarah, scariest thing up there, some of the scary things you've done?

3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:09.640
 Actually the scariest for me was deciding I want to get divorced because it was like

3:44:09.640 --> 3:44:12.080
 a totally radical, like...

3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:13.080
 Life transformation.

3:44:13.080 --> 3:44:16.200
 Yeah, because we had been married for a really long time.

3:44:16.200 --> 3:44:21.480
 And I think it was just so much like, I realized like so much of my individual agency I didn't

3:44:21.480 --> 3:44:25.200
 realize I had before and that was just really like scary, like empowering scary, but like

3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:26.200
 terrifying.

3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:29.920
 Like you were living in a kind of one way for your whole life and then you realized your

3:44:29.920 --> 3:44:31.720
 life could be a different way.

3:44:31.720 --> 3:44:32.720
 And...

3:44:32.720 --> 3:44:33.720
 Yeah, there is a between humans.

3:44:33.720 --> 3:44:38.680
 I mean, that's the beautiful thing about love is the connection you have, but it's also

3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:43.720
 becomes a dependency and breaking that whether it's a mentor with your parents, your close

3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:44.720
 friends.

3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:45.720
 It's almost like waking up.

3:44:45.720 --> 3:44:46.720
 Like just there's a different reality.

3:44:46.720 --> 3:44:47.720
 Yeah.

3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:48.720
 That was scary.

3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:49.720
 Reinventing yourself.

3:44:49.720 --> 3:44:50.720
 Okay.

3:44:50.720 --> 3:44:55.800
 If you could leave, maybe I'll actually will alternate, Sarah, if you could be someone

3:44:55.800 --> 3:45:01.280
 else for a day, someone alive today, you haven't met yet, haven't met yet, or maybe you could

3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:04.040
 do one who you've met, who would it be?

3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:06.040
 Kim Kardashian.

3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:07.040
 No joke.

3:45:07.040 --> 3:45:09.040
 The woman's brilliant.

3:45:09.040 --> 3:45:15.360
 I would just like to experience, I think she's got such an interesting and very deep understanding

3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:16.360
 of social reality.

3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:20.280
 But you also said you have appreciation of love for fashion.

3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:24.480
 I do, but that's actually the same, like I just think it's really interesting because

3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:28.000
 we live in a social reality, which is completely artificially constructed.

3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:31.240
 And some people are really genius about moving through that and I think she's particularly

3:45:31.240 --> 3:45:32.240
 good at it.

3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:33.920
 I wonder if she's good at understanding her, if she's...

3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:35.680
 I think it's very deeply intrinsic to her.

3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:36.680
 Right.

3:45:36.680 --> 3:45:37.680
 She's just surfing away.

3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:41.560
 How much cognitive awareness she has of it or how strategic it is, but I think it's deeply

3:45:41.560 --> 3:45:42.560
 fascinating.

3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:44.800
 So I guess that's the first one that comes to mind.

3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:45.800
 What about you, Lay?

3:45:45.800 --> 3:45:48.960
 If you could be somebody for a day, don't say Yosha Bach.

3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:50.960
 Don't say Kim Kardashian.

3:45:50.960 --> 3:45:51.960
 Yeah, right.

3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:52.960
 Let's do off the table.

3:45:52.960 --> 3:45:53.960
 Off the table.

3:45:53.960 --> 3:45:58.080
 No, I was going to say, I would like to be, does that have to be here today?

3:45:58.080 --> 3:46:03.520
 I was going to say, I'd like to be the latest arm processor.

3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:04.520
 Interesting.

3:46:04.520 --> 3:46:07.840
 I would like to be the latest arm processor.

3:46:07.840 --> 3:46:12.400
 I'd like to understand, I would like to know what it feels like to basically...

3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:15.120
 You like being objects.

3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:18.600
 I like being, I've always obsessed with being objects ever since I was a kid.

3:46:18.600 --> 3:46:21.120
 What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day?

3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:24.760
 I mean, I'd like to understand how I access my memory, what it anticipates coming next

3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:26.000
 in clock cycles.

3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:27.520
 What about how it feels like?

3:46:27.520 --> 3:46:30.320
 Yeah, I wonder how it feels like to be...

3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:31.320
 To be useful.

3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:32.320
 To be...

3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:33.320
 I mean...

3:46:33.320 --> 3:46:36.320
 That's the best part for that.

3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:38.840
 All right.

3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:45.160
 If, Leif, everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your days

3:46:45.160 --> 3:46:46.160
 look like?

3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:47.160
 What would you do?

3:46:47.160 --> 3:46:49.040
 Nobody else left impressed.

3:46:49.040 --> 3:46:53.520
 Nobody, no, probably can't really do any real science at scale.

3:46:53.520 --> 3:46:56.000
 What would you do with your remaining days?

3:46:56.000 --> 3:47:02.560
 Every possible tool I could and put it in my workshop and just make stuff.

3:47:02.560 --> 3:47:04.200
 So try to make stuff.

3:47:04.200 --> 3:47:05.320
 Just try to make stuff.

3:47:05.320 --> 3:47:06.320
 Make companions.

3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:07.320
 I'm probably not making companions.

3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:08.320
 It's probably...

3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:09.320
 Yeah.

3:47:09.320 --> 3:47:10.320
 Probably just...

3:47:10.320 --> 3:47:11.320
 In the physical space.

3:47:11.320 --> 3:47:12.320
 Yeah.

3:47:12.320 --> 3:47:13.320
 What about you, Sarah?

3:47:13.320 --> 3:47:14.320
 What would you...

3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:15.320
 When you're just left alone on earth, you're the last...

3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:17.320
 Are there animals in this scenario?

3:47:17.320 --> 3:47:18.320
 No.

3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:19.320
 Nothing.

3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:20.320
 No living beings.

3:47:20.320 --> 3:47:21.320
 No plants?

3:47:21.320 --> 3:47:22.320
 No plants.

3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:23.320
 Oh, interesting.

3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:25.200
 I was going to say, I would just...

3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:28.280
 I would try to walk the entire planet, at least all the landmass.

3:47:28.280 --> 3:47:33.840
 Well, that's true, so you probably don't know if there's stuff.

3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:36.720
 You could be searching for plants or other humans or other animals.

3:47:36.720 --> 3:47:39.720
 What would I eat?

3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:40.720
 It's a...

3:47:40.720 --> 3:47:44.840
 You just have daily just allotment...

3:47:44.840 --> 3:47:46.720
 I would just walk all the time, I think.

3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:47.720
 Of Soylent.

3:47:47.720 --> 3:47:48.720
 I don't know why I...

3:47:48.720 --> 3:47:49.720
 Just walk.

3:47:49.720 --> 3:47:50.720
 That's just...

3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:51.720
 You're the explorer.

3:47:51.720 --> 3:47:52.720
 I would just walk.

3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:55.120
 And I guess I would make a goal of covering all of the entire earth, because what else

3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:56.640
 are you going to do with your time?

3:47:56.640 --> 3:48:00.640
 What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah, that you haven't done yet, but you hope to

3:48:00.640 --> 3:48:01.640
 do?

3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:02.640
 Um...

3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:03.640
 Skydiving.

3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:05.640
 Travel to space.

3:48:05.640 --> 3:48:08.640
 Um...

3:48:08.640 --> 3:48:10.200
 I don't know.

3:48:10.200 --> 3:48:11.720
 You know what's funny with my bucket list?

3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:14.320
 I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off.

3:48:14.320 --> 3:48:15.320
 I always check it off.

3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:17.200
 So your bucket list is like a fog.

3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:18.200
 It's like a mystery.

3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:19.200
 Yeah.

3:48:19.200 --> 3:48:20.200
 You're almost by doing it.

3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:22.880
 Yeah, so it's very subconsciously driven.

3:48:22.880 --> 3:48:26.480
 So it's in your subconscious in there, and you're bringing it to the surface.

3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:29.640
 I think most of the steering of our agency is in our subconscious anyway, so I just kind

3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:30.640
 of go with the flow.

3:48:30.640 --> 3:48:31.640
 But I guess, um...

3:48:31.640 --> 3:48:32.640
 No, seriously.

3:48:32.640 --> 3:48:33.640
 Yeah, no, I get it.

3:48:33.640 --> 3:48:34.640
 Yeah.

3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:35.640
 Space.

3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:36.640
 I don't know.

3:48:36.640 --> 3:48:38.140
 I guess I would like to go in a submarine, like to the bottom of the ocean.

3:48:38.140 --> 3:48:39.140
 I think that'd be really cool.

3:48:39.140 --> 3:48:40.440
 To the bottom of the ocean.

3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:42.640
 Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean?

3:48:42.640 --> 3:48:43.640
 Like how...

3:48:43.640 --> 3:48:44.640
 I am.

3:48:44.640 --> 3:48:45.640
 Yeah.

3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:46.640
 Yeah.

3:48:46.640 --> 3:48:47.960
 What about you, Lee?

3:48:47.960 --> 3:48:50.400
 What item on your bucket list?

3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:51.920
 I don't have a bucket list, but I've just made one.

3:48:51.920 --> 3:48:57.080
 I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars and make drugs off world.

3:48:57.080 --> 3:49:00.760
 It'd be the first chemist to make drugs off world.

3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:02.560
 The first drug manufacturer in space?

3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:03.560
 Yeah, why not?

3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:04.560
 Drugs in space.

3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:09.600
 Do you have to be somehow like be able to habitat, like be able to survive on that particular

3:49:09.600 --> 3:49:10.600
 space?

3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:14.280
 Or like, what's the connection between being on Mars and doing many...

3:49:14.280 --> 3:49:15.280
 I just would like to be that.

3:49:15.280 --> 3:49:21.840
 I'd like to take the ability to have command and control over chemicals programmatically

3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:24.160
 off Earth to somewhere else in the universe.

3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:29.000
 That just seems like you like difficulty engineering problems.

3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:30.000
 Before I die, if I can do that, it's great.

3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:31.000
 Would you travel to space?

3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:32.000
 Yeah.

3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:33.000
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.800
 I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist.

3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:39.960
 I want to take scientific experiment in space and do a thing in space that's never been

3:49:39.960 --> 3:49:41.480
 done before.

3:49:41.480 --> 3:49:42.760
 That's a real possibility.

3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:43.760
 Yeah.

3:49:43.760 --> 3:49:44.760
 Yeah.

3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:45.760
 Yeah.

3:49:45.760 --> 3:49:48.080
 So that's why there's no point in listing things I can't do.

3:49:48.080 --> 3:49:49.080
 Yeah.

3:49:49.080 --> 3:49:56.640
 All right, what small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget?

3:49:56.640 --> 3:49:59.880
 Small act of kindness, not big.

3:49:59.880 --> 3:50:01.320
 Somebody was just kind to you.

3:50:01.320 --> 3:50:03.440
 Somebody did something sweet.

3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:10.760
 When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out with just...

3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:11.760
 I was basically...

3:50:11.760 --> 3:50:12.760
 I needed a computer.

3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:17.920
 I needed some power, computation power, and someone took pity on me and helped me and

3:50:17.920 --> 3:50:18.920
 gave me...

3:50:18.920 --> 3:50:19.920
 I was really touched.

3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:20.920
 They didn't have to.

3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:21.920
 They were actually quite...

3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:22.920
 They were disabled scientists.

3:50:22.920 --> 3:50:27.640
 They had other things to do rather than help some random PhD student, gave me access,

3:50:27.640 --> 3:50:28.920
 taught me a lot of stuff.

3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:29.920
 Yeah.

3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:33.400
 Actually, when you're a grad student or when you're a student, when you're even a student,

3:50:33.400 --> 3:50:35.680
 the younger it is, the better.

3:50:35.680 --> 3:50:40.760
 The attention, the support, the love you get from an older person, a teacher, something

3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:42.400
 like that is super powerful.

3:50:42.400 --> 3:50:43.400
 It's fascinating.

3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:47.640
 And like from the perspective of the teacher, they might not realize the impact they have,

3:50:47.640 --> 3:50:54.320
 but that little bit, those few words, a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.

3:50:54.320 --> 3:50:57.120
 What about you, Sarah?

3:50:57.120 --> 3:50:59.280
 Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point?

3:50:59.280 --> 3:51:00.480
 I love free Starbucks.

3:51:00.480 --> 3:51:04.920
 I like it when you're in the line at Starbucks and somebody buys your coffee in front of

3:51:04.920 --> 3:51:05.920
 you and then you buy the next one.

3:51:05.920 --> 3:51:06.920
 I love those.

3:51:06.920 --> 3:51:07.920
 But that's not my example.

3:51:07.920 --> 3:51:08.920
 I love that too.

3:51:08.920 --> 3:51:09.920
 Those are great.

3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:10.920
 It makes me happy.

3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:13.560
 And then my kids get all excited when we do it, when we go in, for the first ones in line

3:51:13.560 --> 3:51:23.040
 doing it, but I guess I can use a similar example about just being a student.

3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:30.600
 So Paul Davies is a very well known theoretical physicist and he was generous enough with

3:51:30.600 --> 3:51:33.040
 his time to take me on as a postdoc.

3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:36.800
 But before I became his postdoc, he invited me to a workshop at Arizona State University

3:51:36.800 --> 3:51:41.680
 in the Beyond Center and took a walk with me around campus just to talk about ideas

3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:42.680
 after.

3:51:42.680 --> 3:51:48.520
 I think there were two things that were completely generous about that.

3:51:48.520 --> 3:51:54.040
 One is Paul's philosophy is always interacting with young people is like you interact with

3:51:54.040 --> 3:51:55.040
 a mind in the room.

3:51:55.040 --> 3:51:58.040
 It doesn't matter, you know, how well known or whatever.

3:51:58.040 --> 3:52:01.240
 It's like you evaluate the person for the person.

3:52:01.240 --> 3:52:05.840
 But he also gave me a book, The Uri Silence, that he had written and he wrote in it.

3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:09.200
 This is how EE gets to ET.

3:52:09.200 --> 3:52:13.040
 Which was an anti American excess, which I worked on as a PhD student was the original

3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:16.560
 homo chirality all the way up to what the book was about, which was, are we alone in

3:52:16.560 --> 3:52:17.560
 the university?

3:52:17.560 --> 3:52:19.480
 Is there an intelligent life out there?

3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:25.320
 And it was just so much about the questions I wanted to ask because it's like, it was

3:52:25.320 --> 3:52:30.000
 just everything about like, just, it was, it was just really, really kind.

3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:34.440
 Like that it's okay to ask these questions and you can actually have strong and strong

3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:35.440
 answer them.

3:52:35.440 --> 3:52:38.040
 Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of my career is mostly his encouragement to ask deep questions

3:52:38.040 --> 3:52:41.600
 like he gave me the space to do it in ways that a lot of previous mentors had.

3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:46.360
 I mean, I've had a good experience with mentors, but it was like, go off the deep end, ask

3:52:46.360 --> 3:52:48.040
 the hardest questions.

3:52:48.040 --> 3:52:50.680
 And I think that's the best gift you can give somebody.

3:52:50.680 --> 3:52:57.520
 What would you, cause you're both fascinating minds and non, I would say, non standard in

3:52:57.520 --> 3:52:59.040
 the best possible way.

3:52:59.040 --> 3:53:05.400
 Is there advice you can give to young folks how to be non standard, how to stand out,

3:53:05.400 --> 3:53:07.240
 novelty, how to generate novelty?

3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:08.880
 That's what I want on my tombstone.

3:53:08.880 --> 3:53:10.880
 I have one.

3:53:10.880 --> 3:53:11.880
 He generated novelty.

3:53:11.880 --> 3:53:12.880
 No, no.

3:53:12.880 --> 3:53:13.880
 How to.

3:53:13.880 --> 3:53:14.880
 How to.

3:53:14.880 --> 3:53:17.560
 How, how still.

3:53:17.560 --> 3:53:19.200
 I just love doing science.

3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:23.960
 And so when I was younger, I was just, just wanted to, I mean, I'm still not sure I'm a

3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:24.960
 real scientist, right?

3:53:24.960 --> 3:53:26.560
 So I want to try.

3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:31.600
 So my advice for the young people is just if you just, if you love asking questions,

3:53:31.600 --> 3:53:35.760
 then don't be afraid to ask the question, even if it pisses people off, because if you

3:53:35.760 --> 3:53:40.120
 piss people off, you're probably asking the right question.

3:53:40.120 --> 3:53:44.680
 What I would say though is don't do what I did, which is just piss everyone off.

3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:50.600
 Try and work out how to, you know, I think, if you're, if other people are challenged

3:53:50.600 --> 3:53:58.080
 by your questions, you will get not only your respect, but people will give you create space

3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:01.400
 for you because you're doing something really new.

3:54:01.400 --> 3:54:07.920
 I really try to create space in my academic career, my team, really try and praise them

3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:09.640
 and push them to do new things.

3:54:09.640 --> 3:54:17.440
 So my advice is try to do new things, get feedback, and the universe will help you.

3:54:17.440 --> 3:54:19.840
 Because the universe likes novelty.

3:54:19.840 --> 3:54:20.840
 I think so.

3:54:20.840 --> 3:54:21.840
 I think so.

3:54:21.840 --> 3:54:22.840
 Right.

3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:23.840
 If this one will keep them around.

3:54:23.840 --> 3:54:24.840
 Oh my God.

3:54:24.840 --> 3:54:25.840
 What about you, Sarah?

3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:26.840
 Um.

3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:30.640
 You too like to ask the really out there, the question.

3:54:30.640 --> 3:54:32.920
 Uh, because I have a strong passion for them.

3:54:32.920 --> 3:54:36.280
 So I think, um, uh, it goes back to the love.

3:54:36.280 --> 3:54:39.160
 Like if you, if you're doing the thing you're supposed to be doing, you should really love

3:54:39.160 --> 3:54:40.160
 it.

3:54:40.160 --> 3:54:43.400
 Um, so I always tell people that they should do the thing they're most passionate about.

3:54:43.400 --> 3:54:48.560
 But I think a flip side of that is that's when you become, uh, in some might like not

3:54:48.560 --> 3:54:51.080
 to sound cheesy, but like your best version of yourself.

3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:56.120
 So I guess like for me, as I become more successful in my career, I feel like I can be more myself

3:54:56.120 --> 3:54:57.120
 as an individual.

3:54:57.120 --> 3:55:01.440
 And so there's this, I've always been following the questions I'm most interested in, which

3:55:01.440 --> 3:55:05.560
 very early on I was discouraged from knowing by many people because they thought they were

3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:06.560
 unanswerable questions.

3:55:06.560 --> 3:55:10.960
 And I always just thought, well, if no one's even trying to answer them, of course they're

3:55:10.960 --> 3:55:12.480
 going to be unanswerable.

3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:13.880
 And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint.

3:55:13.880 --> 3:55:19.080
 But the more I, I found my way in that space, the more I also made a space for myself as

3:55:19.080 --> 3:55:25.440
 a person because you're basically generating the niche that you want to exist in.

3:55:25.440 --> 3:55:30.640
 And so I think, um, I think that's, that's part of it is not just to follow your passion,

3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:35.080
 but also think about like, who do you want to be and create that?

3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:36.080
 Yeah.

3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:37.080
 Who am I?

3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:38.080
 Who do you want to be?

3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:40.320
 I mean, yeah, play temporally with it.

3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:41.320
 Yeah.

3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:42.320
 Who am I now?

3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:43.320
 Who do I want to be now?

3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:44.320
 But who do I want to be in the future?

3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:45.320
 They're not decoupled.

3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:46.320
 Yeah.

3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:53.400
 I always wonder if that's like, if I become something, am I finding myself or am I creating

3:55:53.400 --> 3:55:54.400
 myself?

3:55:54.400 --> 3:55:55.400
 Yeah.

3:55:55.400 --> 3:55:58.000
 I think those are somehow the same kind of thing.

3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:05.480
 I do feel often like I was always meant to be this kind of thing, but, um, is that created

3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:06.480
 or discovered?

3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:07.480
 I don't know.

3:56:07.480 --> 3:56:09.640
 But basically go towards that direction.

3:56:09.640 --> 3:56:15.240
 If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah, waiting, they would come find me.

3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:17.640
 They're on a spaceship.

3:56:17.640 --> 3:56:24.280
 And then they somehow figured out the language you speak, um, and ask you, what are, what

3:56:24.280 --> 3:56:33.640
 are you, what is, what explain yourself, not you, Sarah, but the species, what's life

3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:42.040
 on earth, uh, like we, we don't have time or busy grad students from another, uh, planet.

3:56:42.040 --> 3:56:45.640
 What, what, what's interesting about human civilization?

3:56:45.640 --> 3:56:50.880
 What's interesting about you, uh, you specifically too, they could be very kind of personal, kind

3:56:50.880 --> 3:56:57.640
 of pushy, um, and yeah, well, how would you, how would you describe?

3:56:57.640 --> 3:56:58.640
 Okay.

3:56:58.640 --> 3:57:04.120
 Um, I have one, um, because, you know, like, obviously I self identify as a scientist and

3:57:04.120 --> 3:57:07.480
 a physicist, but intrinsically I feel more like an artist, but it's almost like you're

3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:09.680
 an artist that you don't know what you're painting yet.

3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:15.200
 Um, and I guess I feel like that's humanity, like in, in some sense we're, we're, we're

3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:20.320
 creating something I think is profound and, and potentially very beautiful like existence

3:57:20.320 --> 3:57:25.480
 of the universe, but we're just so night, like not night, we're just early or we're

3:57:25.480 --> 3:57:28.320
 early, we're, we're young, we don't know what we're doing yet.

3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:29.320
 Yeah.

3:57:29.320 --> 3:57:30.320
 What's with the nuclear weapons?

3:57:30.320 --> 3:57:31.320
 There's a big question too.

3:57:31.320 --> 3:57:34.400
 Like what are you guys, what are we doing with them?

3:57:34.400 --> 3:57:38.160
 This creativity that you talk about, it's not very nice, but it's, you're, we're making

3:57:38.160 --> 3:57:43.320
 things that are like very destructive and like the rockets, what, this seems very aggressive.

3:57:43.320 --> 3:57:44.320
 Yeah.

3:57:44.320 --> 3:57:49.000
 I know this is my, my blinders on, um, I don't know.

3:57:49.000 --> 3:57:51.000
 I, I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation about suffering.

3:57:51.000 --> 3:57:56.600
 I have a hard time, uh, regularizing certain aspects of a reality into what I want to envision

3:57:56.600 --> 3:58:01.280
 and that's obviously problematic, but you know, nuclear power has also given us a lot

3:58:01.280 --> 3:58:02.280
 of good things.

3:58:02.280 --> 3:58:03.280
 So, um,

3:58:03.280 --> 3:58:09.160
 So both that's human nature, both, both human beings and the technology we create has the

3:58:09.160 --> 3:58:11.160
 capacity for evil and the capacity for good.

3:58:11.160 --> 3:58:12.160
 Yeah.

3:58:12.160 --> 3:58:13.160
 And we can't all be good all the time.

3:58:13.160 --> 3:58:17.360
 I mean, there's like this huge misnomer that you need to be liked by everyone universally.

3:58:17.360 --> 3:58:20.920
 And obviously that's like an ideal, but it's physically impossible.

3:58:20.920 --> 3:58:24.240
 You like, you can't get a group of people in the room and have everyone like each other

3:58:24.240 --> 3:58:25.240
 all the time.

3:58:25.240 --> 3:58:30.440
 So I think that kind of tension is actually really important, um, that we have different

3:58:30.440 --> 3:58:38.760
 aesthetics, um, different goals, uh, and, and sometimes conflict comes out of that.

3:58:38.760 --> 3:58:39.760
 Yeah.

3:58:39.760 --> 3:58:43.920
 Speaking of which, uh, do you and Yosha Bach ever say anything nice to each other or is

3:58:43.920 --> 3:58:45.520
 it always conflict?

3:58:45.520 --> 3:58:46.520
 We never have conflict.

3:58:46.520 --> 3:58:49.800
 We argue, but I don't, I don't think they argue, arguments are bad.

3:58:49.800 --> 3:58:50.800
 It's a lot.

3:58:50.800 --> 3:58:55.840
 I mean, I think the problem I have, not problem, I think here we go and he's not here to defend

3:58:55.840 --> 3:58:56.840
 himself.

3:58:56.840 --> 3:59:01.160
 No, I just, I don't necessarily understand the, the, I mean, he's just talking at such

3:59:01.160 --> 3:59:02.160
 a high level.

3:59:02.160 --> 3:59:03.160
 Yeah.

3:59:03.160 --> 3:59:04.160
 You know, I'm, I'm a dimwit.

3:59:04.160 --> 3:59:08.120
 So I'm like, I spend some, so I think a lot of our conflict is not conflict.

3:59:08.120 --> 3:59:11.360
 We actually, we actually have a, I think, I mean, I can't speak for Yosha, I have a deep

3:59:11.360 --> 3:59:12.360
 appreciation for him.

3:59:12.360 --> 3:59:17.680
 He's kind of brilliant, but I, I think I'm kind of frustrated and I'm trying to, he

3:59:17.680 --> 3:59:23.560
 thinks the universe is a computer and I want to turn the universe into a computer.

3:59:23.560 --> 3:59:24.560
 Yeah.

3:59:24.560 --> 3:59:25.920
 That's, that's a small disagreement.

3:59:25.920 --> 3:59:30.520
 So what, what would you, how would you defend your life to an alien when you're being abducted?

3:59:30.520 --> 3:59:32.440
 Would you focus on the specifics of your life?

3:59:32.440 --> 3:59:36.560
 No, no, no, I would be, I would try and be as random as possible and try and confuse

3:59:36.560 --> 3:59:37.560
 them.

3:59:37.560 --> 3:59:38.560
 Oh, good.

3:59:38.560 --> 3:59:39.560
 Good.

3:59:39.560 --> 3:59:42.560
 Excellent.

3:59:42.560 --> 3:59:44.720
 That might be the wiser choice.

3:59:44.720 --> 3:59:46.240
 The Easter eggs in reality?

3:59:46.240 --> 3:59:50.440
 No, I mean, if aliens are doctor, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible.

3:59:50.440 --> 3:59:54.040
 I would try and do something that would surprise the hell out of them, which I thought, I mean,

3:59:54.040 --> 3:59:56.880
 they're probably like risking, they might kill me, but I think that might be funny.

3:59:56.880 --> 4:00:00.360
 That might, yeah, they might want to study you for prolonged periods of time.

4:00:00.360 --> 4:00:04.440
 My reasoning is if I wanted to stay alive, okay, so if the thing is, if I wasn't going

4:00:04.440 --> 4:00:08.280
 back to earth and the job was to stay alive, if I could be as surprising as possible, they

4:00:08.280 --> 4:00:10.520
 would keep me around like a pet, right?

4:00:10.520 --> 4:00:13.040
 Pet Lee on the aliens page book.

4:00:13.040 --> 4:00:14.760
 So you'd be okay being a pet?

4:00:14.760 --> 4:00:19.520
 Well, no, but I mean, the last human that survives would just be a pet to the aliens.

4:00:19.520 --> 4:00:24.520
 I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun because then that might, I might get

4:00:24.520 --> 4:00:26.560
 some feedback from their curiosity, but yeah.

4:00:26.560 --> 4:00:28.720
 Let me ask you this question.

4:00:28.720 --> 4:00:33.400
 Given our conversation has a very different meaning, not a more profound need perhaps,

4:00:33.400 --> 4:00:42.240
 would you rather lose all of your old memories or never be able to make new ones?

4:00:42.240 --> 4:00:47.000
 I would have to lose all my old memories.

4:00:47.000 --> 4:00:49.160
 Again, it's the novelty.

4:00:49.160 --> 4:00:52.200
 What about you, Sarah?

4:00:52.200 --> 4:00:56.440
 I'm the same because I don't think like it's about the future experience, right?

4:00:56.440 --> 4:01:01.200
 And in some sense, like you were saying earlier, most of our lived experience is actually in

4:01:01.200 --> 4:01:08.200
 our memories, so if you can't generate new memories, it's like you're not alive anymore.

4:01:08.200 --> 4:01:10.400
 What comforts you on bad days?

4:01:10.400 --> 4:01:14.560
 When you look at human civilization, when you look at your own life, what gives you

4:01:14.560 --> 4:01:15.560
 hope?

4:01:15.560 --> 4:01:20.840
 What makes you feel good about what we're doing about life at the small scale of you as a

4:01:20.840 --> 4:01:27.720
 human and at the big scale of us as a human civilization, maybe the big scale of the universe?

4:01:27.720 --> 4:01:35.640
 Children, my kids, but I also mean that in a grand sense of like, not a grand, but like

4:01:35.640 --> 4:01:38.160
 future minds in some sense.

4:01:38.160 --> 4:01:43.360
 So for me, the most bleak movie ever, people worry about apocalyptic things like AI existential

4:01:43.360 --> 4:01:48.080
 risk and climate change, which children of men, the whole premise of the movie was there

4:01:48.080 --> 4:01:50.840
 can be no children born on the entire planet.

4:01:50.840 --> 4:01:54.960
 And the youngest person on the planet is 18 years old or something.

4:01:54.960 --> 4:01:56.880
 Can you imagine a world without children?

4:01:56.880 --> 4:02:00.160
 It's just, it's harrowing, that's the scariest thing.

4:02:00.160 --> 4:02:08.800
 So I think what gives me hope is always youth and the hope of children and the possibilities

4:02:08.800 --> 4:02:10.240
 of the future they see.

4:02:10.240 --> 4:02:14.520
 And they grow up in a completely different reality than adults do.

4:02:14.520 --> 4:02:19.680
 And I think we have a hard time seeing what their reality actually looks like.

4:02:19.680 --> 4:02:23.200
 But I think most of the time it's super interesting.

4:02:23.200 --> 4:02:28.720
 Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination, they have this kind of excitement.

4:02:28.720 --> 4:02:31.760
 It's so cool, so fun to watch.

4:02:31.760 --> 4:02:38.880
 And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way of all that imagination.

4:02:38.880 --> 4:02:41.240
 What about, Yuli, what gives you hope?

4:02:41.240 --> 4:02:46.040
 So when I go back to my eight year old self, the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year

4:02:46.040 --> 4:02:50.440
 old self was this world in which technology became programmable when there was internet

4:02:50.440 --> 4:02:58.960
 and I get information and I would expand my consciousness by just getting access to everything

4:02:58.960 --> 4:02:59.960
 that was going on.

4:02:59.960 --> 4:03:01.600
 And this happened in my lifetime.

4:03:01.600 --> 4:03:02.920
 I mean, we really do have that.

4:03:02.920 --> 4:03:06.800
 I mean, okay, there's some bad things, there's TikTok, everyone just don't, whatever, all

4:03:06.800 --> 4:03:08.200
 the bad things about social media.

4:03:08.200 --> 4:03:18.240
 But I think, I mean, I can't quite believe my luck being born now, so amazing.

4:03:18.240 --> 4:03:21.160
 To be able to program reality in some way.

4:03:21.160 --> 4:03:27.040
 And the thing that I really find fascinating about human beings is just how ingenious they

4:03:27.040 --> 4:03:28.040
 are.

4:03:28.040 --> 4:03:35.360
 You know, whether it's from my kids, my research group, my peers, other companies, just how

4:03:35.360 --> 4:03:38.640
 ingenious everyone is.

4:03:38.640 --> 4:03:43.760
 And I'm pretty sure humanity has a, or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital

4:03:43.760 --> 4:03:46.600
 part in the future is going to have a lot of fun.

4:03:46.600 --> 4:03:50.320
 And I'm just, yeah, it's just mind blowing, just to watch.

4:03:50.320 --> 4:03:56.000
 And you know, so humans are ingenious and I hope to help them be more ingenious if I

4:03:56.000 --> 4:03:57.000
 can.

4:03:57.000 --> 4:04:03.200
 Well, what gives me hope, what makes me feel good on bad days is the existence of wild minds

4:04:03.200 --> 4:04:10.680
 like yours, novelty generators, assembly structures that generate novelty and do so beautifully.

4:04:10.680 --> 4:04:12.640
 And then tweet about it.

4:04:12.640 --> 4:04:16.840
 Sarah, this, I really, really enjoy talking to you, I enjoy following you.

4:04:16.840 --> 4:04:17.840
 I'm a huge fan.

4:04:17.840 --> 4:04:21.760
 Sarah Lee, I hope, I hope to talk to you many times in the future, maybe with your Shabak.

4:04:21.760 --> 4:04:23.000
 You're just incredible people.

4:04:23.000 --> 4:04:24.200
 Thank you for everything you do.

4:04:24.200 --> 4:04:25.200
 You're awesome.

4:04:25.200 --> 4:04:26.200
 Thank you for talking today.

4:04:26.200 --> 4:04:27.200
 I really, really appreciate it.

4:04:27.200 --> 4:04:28.200
 Relax.

4:04:28.200 --> 4:04:29.200
 Thanks.

4:04:29.200 --> 4:04:30.200
 Yeah, I'm brilliant to be here.

4:04:30.200 --> 4:04:32.920
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke.

4:04:41.280 --> 4:04:49.080
 Two possibilities exist, either we are alone in the universe or we are not.

4:04:49.080 --> 4:04:52.280
 Both are equally terrifying.

4:04:52.280 --> 4:04:58.680
 And let me, if I may, add to that by saying that both possibilities, at least to me, are

4:04:58.680 --> 4:05:00.960
 both terrifying and exciting.

4:05:00.960 --> 4:05:06.040
 And keeping these two feelings in my heart is a fun way to explore, to wander, to think,

4:05:06.040 --> 4:05:10.400
 and to live, always a little bit on the edge of madness.

4:05:10.400 --> 4:05:11.400
 Thank you for listening.

4:05:11.400 --> 4:05:40.920
 I hope to see you next time.
