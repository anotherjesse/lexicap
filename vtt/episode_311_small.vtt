00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
 you have to have the free markets in order to build prosperity and prosperity means economic power.

00:09.280 --> 00:14.720
 If you have economic power, no one messes with you. Or if they're going to do it,

00:14.720 --> 00:18.080
 they're going to have to think twice. And when they do, they're going to have to pay consequences.

00:20.480 --> 00:26.400
 The following is a conversation with Magat Wade, an entrepreneur who's passionate about creating

00:26.400 --> 00:32.800
 positive change in Africa through economic empowerment. This is Alex Friedman podcast.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.680
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

00:37.680 --> 00:44.720
 here's Magat Wade. You were born in Senegal. You have lived and traveled across the world.

00:45.280 --> 00:51.120
 So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal? Like it's people, it's culture, it's history.

00:51.120 --> 00:57.280
 Can you try to sneak up on telling us what is the spirit of its people?

00:58.000 --> 01:05.600
 Teranga. Teranga. Teranga, it's a Wallof word. Wallof is a main indigenous language of Senegal.

01:05.600 --> 01:12.720
 And it means hospitality. That is what us, the people of Senegal are known for. And it transpires

01:12.720 --> 01:20.240
 in everything that we do, everything that we say. It's a place where, I guess with hospitality goes

01:20.240 --> 01:25.600
 this concept of warmth. So we are very, we are a very warm people. So on and on,

01:25.600 --> 01:30.320
 Shalva, that's us. That's us, the place where you come and everybody will just embrace you,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.880
 make you feel very comfortable, make you look like, feel like you're the only person in the

01:34.880 --> 01:39.200
 world and that we've been waiting for you a whole life, right? So that's my country.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.600
 So that's for people in Senegal, people in Africa or also people across the world,

01:45.600 --> 01:50.320
 weird strangers from all walks of life. So hospitality tells everyone. Yes, for everyone,

01:50.320 --> 01:57.760
 for everyone, especially towards the foreigner. Because it's very, it's very ingrained in us,

01:57.760 --> 02:02.080
 this understanding that especially the foreigner, the foreigner is called foreigner because the

02:02.080 --> 02:06.960
 foreigner is coming from somewhere else. So if someone has taken the time and the energy,

02:06.960 --> 02:14.160
 whether in a forced manner or because it's a choice to travel so far to come to a place that's

02:14.160 --> 02:20.480
 not theirs to start with, that's where the foreigners again, then it is your duty to welcome them,

02:20.480 --> 02:24.880
 to be uber welcome, welcoming to them. So there's not a fear of the foreigner,

02:24.880 --> 02:30.640
 there's not a suspicion of the foreigner? No, no, no. And I think this goes with the other way around.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.560
 Maybe it has to do with just, you know, when you feel good about yourself, when you're very

02:36.560 --> 02:42.080
 grounded yourself, it's very easy to open yourself to others. And I'm wondering if that's not, you

02:42.080 --> 02:49.440
 know, the other side of the equation in a way. So no, we don't have a fear towards the foreigner.

02:49.440 --> 02:56.640
 So when you have a pride of your culture, a pride of your own people, it's easier to sort of embrace.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.000
 I mean, it's interesting how these kind of cultures emerge because, you know, the Slavic

03:02.000 --> 03:09.200
 countries are sometimes colder. They're slower to trust others. We're now here in Austin, Texas,

03:09.200 --> 03:12.560
 one of the reasons I fell in love with this place when I showed up is there's that same

03:12.560 --> 03:20.880
 hospitality as compared to other cities I've lived in, sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco.

03:21.840 --> 03:32.160
 There's a hesitation to open up, to be fragile, to be caring before understanding what the sort of,

03:32.160 --> 03:36.640
 what I can gain from you kind of calculation is really interesting. And I wonder what,

03:36.640 --> 03:41.120
 how those kinds of dynamics emerge because there's certainly parts of the world,

03:41.680 --> 03:46.800
 like Austin is one of them, where you just feel the kindness, just radiate without knowing

03:46.800 --> 03:54.560
 kindness from strangers. You know, if I were to advance one thing, and I had the same experience

03:56.240 --> 04:02.480
 after having lived in San Francisco first, then we went to New York, then we came to Austin.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.120
 And when we came to Austin, I felt it took me a while to put my finger on it. But what I found

04:07.120 --> 04:14.720
 in Austin, people just hang. People, right? They're real. They're real. Unlike what you were saying,

04:14.720 --> 04:20.320
 I feel like in these other places, people are, it's a destination for people who want to come

04:20.320 --> 04:25.360
 and perform. I think maybe the early San Francisco people, it was different for them.

04:25.360 --> 04:32.720
 But later, as prosperity starts to come in and success comes in, then you attract a different

04:32.720 --> 04:39.440
 breed. At first, where are the people who made it, who made this place be what it is? And then it

04:39.440 --> 04:44.960
 attracts all the Bling followers and the Bling attracted people. And when those people show up,

04:44.960 --> 04:49.840
 it's time for all of us to get out. And that's one of my worries about Austin too. And I guess I

04:49.840 --> 04:56.080
 want to, I count myself in it, but because we're also new arrivals, always been furious now.

04:56.080 --> 05:03.360
 But how are we going to protect this place? Yeah. Yeah, these are the best possible version of the

05:03.360 --> 05:08.560
 Austin history. This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin. And so you get a chance to build

05:09.280 --> 05:14.560
 on top of this culture that's already been here, of the weirdos, the artists,

05:14.560 --> 05:22.720
 the sort of the characters, but also the general kindness and love that just permeates the whole

05:22.720 --> 05:30.480
 place, build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit. So like tech companies, new startups,

05:30.480 --> 05:35.680
 all that kind of stuff. And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas, totally

05:35.680 --> 05:40.960
 revolutionary ideas and make them a reality and dream big and build it here. I think Elon

05:40.960 --> 05:50.480
 represents that with all the people that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff they're doing

05:50.480 --> 05:54.880
 at Tesla and SpaceX. But there's a bunch of other companies, they're just like coming up,

05:54.880 --> 06:00.000
 I get to talk to a bunch of tech people and they're just incredible. Versus San Francisco,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.520
 there's a cynicism a bit. And also some of the interaction with strangers,

06:05.520 --> 06:10.960
 there's always a bit of a calculation like how good is this going to be for my career?

06:10.960 --> 06:15.520
 Or how can I hang out with this person, can advance me? You go to a party,

06:15.520 --> 06:20.080
 you're seizing, they're seizing up. It's like, I'm not going to talk to someone so because

06:20.080 --> 06:25.600
 that's not going to advance me. Who's going to advance me next? And so this is what I would not

06:25.600 --> 06:31.040
 want to see here in Austin. And I think maybe there's one way to try to, I really would like to see

06:31.040 --> 06:35.840
 Austin not go the way San Francisco did and other towns before. I like how you pronounce San Francisco

06:35.840 --> 06:42.000
 with a French accent. San Francisco? That's great. That's the one word you go with a French accent.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.160
 You have to. San Francisco. San Francisco. But you know, so now that you find that cute,

06:50.160 --> 06:55.120
 you're going to have to forgive me when I mess up my English because English is not my first language.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.760
 So I always try to make sure people know that. But you know, Lex, this is why

06:59.760 --> 07:05.200
 I am very interested in what some folks here are working on. And I'm just going to be very selfish

07:05.200 --> 07:10.560
 here because I want to help her with what she's doing. It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nodzek

07:10.560 --> 07:13.920
 and her project, you know, with the housing projects that they have right now,

07:14.480 --> 07:19.840
 making sure that Austin remains a town that's affordable for people of all walks of life.

07:20.400 --> 07:25.440
 If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of life doesn't matter how little

07:25.440 --> 07:30.960
 or big you're making money wise, that you can stay in this town so the diversity at that level

07:30.960 --> 07:36.160
 can remain, then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world how to do things differently.

07:36.160 --> 07:42.720
 And what I love about, you know, her initiative is just how they're really trying, you know,

07:42.720 --> 07:47.840
 to again work on keeping affordability down for most people. I think it's important to,

07:48.800 --> 07:52.880
 because it seems like it matters to you, I know that it matters to me. I absolutely would not

07:52.880 --> 07:58.400
 want to see Austin go away, that San Francisco did. And I think the key to that is making sure

07:58.400 --> 08:02.160
 that true diversity, not like the fluff, fluff crap diversity we're hearing over there,

08:02.160 --> 08:05.680
 and that's another thing, by the way, because San Francisco likes to pride itself in,

08:05.680 --> 08:12.960
 oh, you know, we are so into diversity. But I'm like, if diversity for you means gender,

08:12.960 --> 08:18.560
 difference of gender, skin color, you know, maybe the different accents we have, and you think,

08:18.560 --> 08:24.080
 check, check, check, check, check, I'm like, it's not enough. Can we also add diversity of thoughts?

08:24.080 --> 08:28.080
 And that's the other problem I have with that place, you know. And I know some folks who are

08:28.080 --> 08:33.120
 scared of saying much around people, that's also another thing. So not only they're sizing you

08:33.120 --> 08:40.400
 up, but everybody is also, there is this invisible, this invisible, how should I say this,

08:40.400 --> 08:45.680
 there's this invisible agreement that they all seem to have to stay on script.

08:45.680 --> 08:51.520
 Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following a certain kind of script, that's very kind of shallow,

08:51.520 --> 08:56.240
 and there is a bit of a categorization going on, which category do you belong to? And let's put

08:56.240 --> 09:04.160
 this into a simple math equation, what comes out as opposed to just the free, open embrace of people,

09:04.160 --> 09:10.800
 the weirdos, the characters, the interesting, the full, deep sense of diversity, not just ideas,

09:10.800 --> 09:18.640
 but backgrounds, and rich and poor, like, artists, engineers, high school dropouts,

09:18.640 --> 09:25.600
 PhDs, all of this. Yes, yes. That's what makes for a rich society that's going to get ahead.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.960
 I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts. I know she really is passionate about,

09:30.080 --> 09:37.760
 I don't know how complicated that work is, because there's probably a big force trying to

09:37.760 --> 09:45.760
 increase how much it costs to live in Austin. I don't know how you resist that. Whenever I go to

09:45.760 --> 09:51.520
 New York City, just the fact that there's a giant park in the middle of it, I wonder,

09:51.520 --> 09:58.880
 like, how did they pull this off? This is amazing. It's like to resist the force of the increasing

09:58.880 --> 10:06.560
 price of the land, and still to protect this idea of having a park. And then in the same way,

10:06.560 --> 10:11.920
 protecting the ability for people from all walks of life to live in the center of the city, to live

10:11.920 --> 10:17.600
 around the city, to chase a dream when they don't get any money in their pocket.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.720
 Absolutely. I don't know how you do that. It's partly political, probably,

10:21.600 --> 10:24.880
 regulation, all that kind of stuff. A lot of it has to do with regulations.

10:25.920 --> 10:34.480
 And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye in terms of the free markets and also

10:34.480 --> 10:39.680
 prosperity building, because it's always the same problems every most of the time, most places.

10:40.320 --> 10:46.960
 Here, what you have is some people in the name of, we got to stand for, and I don't like to use

10:46.960 --> 10:51.200
 this word, but maybe you helped me find a better one. But at least that's a word that people can

10:51.200 --> 10:55.440
 understand. We got to stand for the lesser fortunate among us. Some people would like

10:55.440 --> 10:59.440
 call them, maybe oftentimes use the word, maybe the underdogs, whatever it is. I was just saying,

10:59.440 --> 11:06.160
 maybe the lesser fortunate among us. In the name of standing up for them, you're promoting policies

11:06.160 --> 11:11.200
 that are actually going to backfire and where they end up being the first ones to suffer from it.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.920
 So let's take this whole housing issue that Nicole and her team are working on.

11:17.520 --> 11:24.800
 We find that oftentimes the cost at the end of the day, it's the good old supply and demand

11:24.800 --> 11:32.720
 equation. If you're going to make it so hard that the supply level of housing remains

11:33.360 --> 11:39.520
 below a certain threshold, remains lower than the demand of people who need, especially affordable

11:39.520 --> 11:46.160
 housing, housing altogether, what's going to happen is scarcity, prices go up, and who gets

11:46.160 --> 11:53.200
 kicked out first, the lesser fortunate among us. But I find that oftentimes people in the name of

11:53.200 --> 11:58.240
 weak care don't engage their mind. And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well, he said,

11:59.360 --> 12:06.320
 having a heart for the poor, that's easy. Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge.

12:06.320 --> 12:12.240
 And oftentimes it's, we all have a heart for the poor. But when it comes then to, then what do we do

12:13.280 --> 12:20.080
 to have a real impact on making sure that people get a chance at, you know, going up,

12:20.080 --> 12:24.960
 then that's where everything starts falling apart. And then you have people who, you know,

12:24.960 --> 12:29.600
 then they start pushing for policies, housing policies, making it super hard for you to even

12:29.600 --> 12:34.320
 renovate or add one more story to your home or anything like that. By doing that, you're messing

12:34.320 --> 12:41.600
 up with the supply, with the supply of housing, and therefore the people who can't afford,

12:41.600 --> 12:46.560
 you know, people get priced out of the market. And so what people like Nicole are doing are

12:46.560 --> 12:50.480
 going back to where all of this is taking place, and they're going back to the regulation side.

12:50.480 --> 12:54.240
 And just like, you know, I'm sure we'll talk about it here, but people wonder today,

12:54.240 --> 13:00.000
 why is Africa the poorest region in the world? We go back to the same culprit. Bad loss.

13:01.280 --> 13:07.200
 And tons of senseless regulations. If you make it so hard that in Berkeley, for someone to build

13:07.200 --> 13:12.640
 one more story to their home, which means maybe one more unit that could be rented out to someone,

13:12.640 --> 13:17.680
 and if many more people do that, then you have a much bigger supply, which means the prices will go

13:17.680 --> 13:22.800
 down, which means more people have access and among them, especially the lesser fortunate among us,

13:22.800 --> 13:26.720
 then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we? But instead, if you go the other way

13:26.720 --> 13:30.720
 around, then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of the market. Same thing was done with us. So

13:30.720 --> 13:36.960
 oftentimes when I see problems of this nature, you can betcha that regulations and senseless laws

13:36.960 --> 13:41.920
 are the heart of it. And that's what they're tackling. It's not popular. It's not fun. And

13:41.920 --> 13:45.520
 people tend to not even understand where you're coming from. But this is a problem we have with

13:45.520 --> 13:50.800
 people not understanding economic econ 101. Well, so it's the regulation of the laws and the system

13:50.800 --> 13:55.680
 that props them up and increases the span of those laws. And we'll talk about that, the fascinating

13:55.680 --> 14:01.520
 way those kinds of things develop when it works, when it doesn't. Let me sort of step back and

14:01.520 --> 14:08.400
 ask you a question about Africa. In the West, in many places in the world, Africa has almost

14:08.400 --> 14:16.560
 talked about like it's one country, like it's one place. So in what ways is Africa one community?

14:16.560 --> 14:21.120
 And in what ways is it many, many, many communities just from your perspective,

14:22.080 --> 14:31.600
 from Senegal and beyond? Right. So at the most basic of what makes us one goes back to even

14:31.600 --> 14:37.040
 what makes you African. You are African. I'm African. We're one big family. Africa is very

14:37.040 --> 14:45.440
 much at the end of the day, the foundation and the birth of the human race. So from that standpoint,

14:45.440 --> 14:51.440
 at the most basic level, we're all Africans. Where this whole thing started. Exactly. Exactly.

14:51.440 --> 14:57.520
 Where this whole thing started and how at some point humanity was hanging by its fingernails.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.000
 Only 2,000 of us were left on this earth. And eventually we started, we went for survival.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.200
 And that's how we started to spread around. And some going up north, some going this way, that way.

15:07.200 --> 15:12.320
 And as you're traveling to different places, then features start to change to adapt to where you

15:12.320 --> 15:19.520
 are. So hair gets lighter for some people. Eyes get different shape for others to adjust to our

15:19.520 --> 15:26.800
 new natural habitat. The genomics program I think at the National Geographic did that so well

15:26.800 --> 15:30.240
 for people who are interested in going back to that work with Spencer Wells and such.

15:30.240 --> 15:36.400
 But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level, that's what unites us all first of all.

15:36.960 --> 15:43.760
 And then I would say that the continent, especially here, I will group it into black Africa,

15:43.760 --> 15:52.160
 you know, black Africa. Unfortunately, our common stories, you know, of having gone through this

15:52.160 --> 15:57.280
 terrible, horrible period of around the same time, the whole continent being, you know,

15:57.280 --> 16:03.440
 enslaved and colonized. So that in a way forms, not that we were ever the first people or only

16:03.440 --> 16:08.880
 people ever, you know, enslaved in this world. As a matter of fact, I mean, the world slaves

16:08.880 --> 16:15.520
 comes from esclave, you know, slave, Slavs, the Slav, right, from the Eastern Bloc. So the first

16:15.520 --> 16:20.880
 slaves were actually people looking more like you than looking like me, right? So, but we don't

16:20.880 --> 16:28.240
 necessarily remember all of that because in our human psyche, the closest to us in history of

16:29.200 --> 16:34.560
 a big mass of people being enslaved is African people. We were the last, the last, you know,

16:34.560 --> 16:39.680
 group like that. You know, the pain of World War I and World War II permeates

16:41.520 --> 16:46.800
 Europe, but it certainly does for the former Soviet Union, the countries that made up the

16:46.800 --> 16:59.920
 former Soviet Union. In the same way, the pain of slavery and empires using Africa, does that

16:59.920 --> 17:05.840
 permeate the culture? Is there still echoes of that? In a way, yes, especially the fact that,

17:05.840 --> 17:13.040
 you know, in many different places, whether it's Ghana or my country or Benin, where you have

17:13.040 --> 17:19.360
 these places that we call the door of no return, or the places of no return, which this was the

17:19.360 --> 17:27.600
 last place where the slaves were standing, or, you know, this is, in Senegal, we call it the

17:27.600 --> 17:32.880
 door of no return. There is this one door, you're there in the slavehouse, and once they go, they

17:32.880 --> 17:42.560
 go. That's it. That's going to be the last time they see back home. So, you know, those, of course,

17:42.560 --> 17:51.600
 it creates for a common lived experience, which becomes a common lived

17:53.600 --> 17:56.640
 history. And of course, it's going to tire us up.

17:56.640 --> 18:02.080
 Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality, is there a kind of resentment

18:02.080 --> 18:09.040
 of the foreigner, that there's a rich, vibrant land? There's many resources, there's powerful

18:09.040 --> 18:15.840
 cultures. Are they just going to show up and use us? That's a way to see geopolitics in this

18:15.840 --> 18:20.640
 modern world. Yeah. This is, okay, so where it plays very differently is, so if you came to Senegal

18:20.640 --> 18:25.920
 today, there is not really a problem at that level. Where people's resentments start to come from

18:27.040 --> 18:33.600
 is, of course, when bad behavior shows up, meaning like you have so many white people who can show

18:33.600 --> 18:39.200
 up, and just in their attitude, they have an entitlement attitude, right? And they think,

18:40.320 --> 18:46.000
 but in a way, we're all still servants. Some people, you know, in your face, some people more,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.840
 but that can cause some little resentment. But where really the resentment is.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.720
 And that can, the entire one can take different forms, like even pity.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.400
 Don't even get me going on that one. I was trying to be polite today. So just don't,

19:00.400 --> 19:04.560
 Lex, do not. You know, sometimes I tell myself, my God, today you're going to be all composed.

19:06.560 --> 19:12.240
 So don't go there and make the fool of yourself. Just behave. But if you get me on some grounds,

19:12.240 --> 19:18.960
 that's when it's all going to go to hell. So yeah, let's move beyond that too. So resentment,

19:18.960 --> 19:23.120
 there's a dance between hospitality and resentment. And resentment. So when you come

19:23.120 --> 19:27.440
 in, you're you, you live your life, you're just a normal human being, and you treat me

19:27.440 --> 19:31.360
 decently like you would treat a friend, normal people. I have no problem with you. I'm not going

19:31.360 --> 19:36.720
 to come back and be like, well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me. You, you're not

19:36.720 --> 19:40.560
 going to see that stuff. Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like it's, you know,

19:41.360 --> 19:48.480
 might look like that. But we in Africa don't do that. Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude,

19:48.480 --> 19:51.680
 you think you're still serving servants around. Well, you can have a problem with someone like

19:51.680 --> 19:55.920
 me. I might even grab you by the back of your neck and, you know, take you back to the airport.

19:55.920 --> 20:03.760
 That's when you're lucky. Help you very quickly. Exactly. But where things come up is,

20:04.880 --> 20:09.440
 especially nowadays with the African youth, when we have to be reminded of a World Bank,

20:10.480 --> 20:14.720
 when we have to be reminded of even the world, places like the World Economic Forum, you know,

20:14.720 --> 20:22.000
 like all of these places that seem to constitute, they would, you, they, the way they describe them,

20:22.000 --> 20:29.040
 then I say they, it's primarily my Pan African friends. So here maybe terms are worth describing.

20:30.480 --> 20:39.600
 So the Pan African movement goes way back when we're talking about, you know, way back when

20:39.600 --> 20:47.760
 started in the, in the 30s going on all the way from there. So what you have there is people

20:47.760 --> 20:55.680
 who have started coming together and dreaming up an emancipated Africa away from the colonies,

20:55.680 --> 20:59.920
 because at that point there were still colonies and dreaming up all of that. So we're talking

20:59.920 --> 21:04.640
 about people like Kwame Kuma, Afghana, we're talking about Julius Nehri, of Tanzania,

21:04.640 --> 21:10.160
 talking about Blaisdian, of Senegal, and other people like that, Bandi of Malawi. So anyway, so,

21:11.040 --> 21:16.640
 and the African youth of today, we're still hanging on onto those, onto some of these ideas of,

21:16.640 --> 21:21.200
 and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa. So when you were talking about

21:21.200 --> 21:26.800
 what seems to unite you, there is that, you know, also meaning like we all feel like we're part of

21:26.800 --> 21:31.600
 the same family. Is it only in our heads? Is it in reality? Many, for many different reasons,

21:31.600 --> 21:37.600
 there is definitely what we call a Pan African movement. And I very much myself consider myself

21:37.600 --> 21:42.880
 one of them. I don't agree all the time with our where we want to go and how we want to go there,

21:42.880 --> 21:48.480
 but not where we want to go. Where we want to go is we would love to see a united Africa for sure,

21:48.480 --> 21:53.840
 but how to get that accomplished, that's where oftentimes we have issues. So on something like

21:53.840 --> 21:59.440
 that, so this Pan African, especially the Pan African youth, but it's beyond the Pan African

21:59.440 --> 22:05.120
 youth, it's the youth in general in Africa, World Bank, UN, all of these organizations that they

22:05.120 --> 22:12.160
 tend to qualify as imperialist organizations. And it's not always a correct way to describe them,

22:12.160 --> 22:18.800
 but I'm sure you get the sentiment. And from that place, there is tons of resentment.

22:19.680 --> 22:26.320
 Because for the longest time, these groups, organizations, and some that preceded them,

22:27.120 --> 22:33.920
 have proceeded to actually decide what even our new frontiers would be. You see,

22:33.920 --> 22:37.600
 when you go to a place like Senegal, Mali, all of that, different countries,

22:37.600 --> 22:45.120
 but we were one people, one group, one kingdom. And then at some point, they decided,

22:45.120 --> 22:48.800
 just when you look at Africa, have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.680
 You were like, did a robot just draw these? Really?

22:51.680 --> 22:52.880
 No offense to a robot.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.360
 No offense to a robot, especially this one, he looks so cute.

22:55.360 --> 23:05.440
 But you know what I mean? So they have continued deciding what it would be to be us,

23:05.440 --> 23:11.280
 to live on our land. And how do we even progress? And it just keeps on going.

23:11.920 --> 23:19.280
 They get to decide how are we going to, which type of even economic development path are we

23:19.280 --> 23:23.920
 going to choose or not? So it's very, so from that standpoint, yes, there's a lot of resentment,

23:23.920 --> 23:25.120
 including even from people like me.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.960
 Yeah. And it's interesting that the invader and the oppressor and the empires

23:28.960 --> 23:36.240
 have actually created a force for unity. I've seen that in Ukraine, in the invasion of Ukraine,

23:36.880 --> 23:40.960
 where it was a pretty divided, not a pretty, a very divided country with many factions.

23:41.520 --> 23:48.160
 But the invasion really forced everyone to think about the identity of this nation together.

23:48.720 --> 23:54.560
 Beyond factions, beyond all of that, it allowed it to look at its history and its future.

23:54.560 --> 24:00.480
 And they all say that all great nations have had to have a war of independence.

24:00.480 --> 24:09.280
 And this is our war to find our own identity. And so in that sense, Africa, as one place,

24:09.280 --> 24:17.120
 as one continent, had to find multiple times its identity through the resistance of the oppressor.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.560
 Especially subterranean Africa, especially subterranean Africa, yes.

24:20.560 --> 24:25.920
 And there's an interesting aspect to this because the president of Senegal is also the head of the

24:25.920 --> 24:34.160
 African Union. So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics of that whole situation. But let me

24:34.160 --> 24:41.760
 ask, in general, you talk about this question, this fascinating question, what does it take

24:41.760 --> 24:49.680
 for a country to prosper? What does it take for a country to prosper? You see many countries in

24:49.680 --> 24:56.800
 the world that really struggle and many that flourish. And it's not always obvious why,

24:56.800 --> 25:05.520
 because some have natural resources, some don't. Some have wars, some don't. Some have

25:07.360 --> 25:13.360
 sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't. And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff.

25:13.360 --> 25:22.160
 So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious. Is there commonalities? Is there fundamental ideas that

25:22.160 --> 25:29.120
 result in a prosperity of a nation? Today, I can confidently say yes, despite all the differences

25:29.120 --> 25:33.680
 that you talked about. And I think then this is where it becomes very important that we are

25:33.680 --> 25:40.400
 very clear about the question you asked me. You said, what does it take to make a country

25:40.400 --> 25:46.160
 prosperous? So I'm just going to stick to prosperity. Because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean

25:46.960 --> 25:54.720
 sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how you conduct yourself, otherwise socially speaking.

25:56.080 --> 26:02.480
 So you can be prosperous. And still, when it comes to your family laws, all the way,

26:02.480 --> 26:07.600
 you approach the other aspects of your life, maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle.

26:07.600 --> 26:16.480
 Or you're in a very liberal society. So for me, when we talk about prosperity,

26:16.480 --> 26:21.440
 I just want to make sure that we're clear on that. Because some people might be somewhere and be like,

26:21.440 --> 26:25.520
 well, because I know what I'm going to talk to you about next. And some people are going to

26:25.520 --> 26:31.440
 sit there and be like, well, China is not like that. Or even Dubai is not like that.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.520
 No. So what I'm talking about is this thing. And that's what I love about this,

26:35.520 --> 26:39.440
 if we just stick to the word prosperity. To me, I see prosperity as this. It's like,

26:39.440 --> 26:42.320
 economically speaking, what are we going to be to be a prosperous nation?

26:42.960 --> 26:49.520
 Meaning we are a middle to high income nation. I'm not talking about what are the rights of

26:49.520 --> 26:56.560
 your woman to vote? Or can people live like this? Or I'm not talking about any of that.

26:56.560 --> 27:01.520
 Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity. Because I think that distinction is very

27:01.520 --> 27:05.200
 important because over the years, I've seen people push back on all types of things and

27:05.200 --> 27:09.040
 it occurred to me that that's what the misunderstanding was there. So if we're going to

27:09.040 --> 27:14.240
 talk about prosperity, make sure that the country can make money so that it can take care of its

27:14.240 --> 27:21.920
 needs and the needs of its citizens. Then what I have come to find is that at the root of that

27:22.560 --> 27:28.240
 is going to be what we call economic freedom. And what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur.

27:28.240 --> 27:33.360
 In that, you can put the rule of law. You can put the concept of clear and transferable property

27:33.360 --> 27:43.440
 rights. Economic freedom is at all the levels that which will allow entrepreneurs and business people

27:44.800 --> 27:50.240
 to create value and create value entrepreneurially. We're not talking about rent seeking or anything

27:50.240 --> 27:56.080
 like that. It's like you found a pie to be this big and you make it this big. So that's what we're

27:56.080 --> 28:03.520
 talking about. Create value. Yes. So when it comes to that, we have found that

28:05.120 --> 28:09.520
 whether you're looking at two countries that start out the same, we're talking the same people,

28:10.160 --> 28:18.240
 East Germany, West Germany, South Korea, North Korea, very similar people to start with, right?

28:18.240 --> 28:26.800
 But yet, radical outcomes. I know that today Germany is united, but we're talking about back

28:26.800 --> 28:32.560
 in the days when you had East and West and block. Same people, very different outcomes.

28:32.560 --> 28:37.600
 Like I said, South Korea, North Korea, and so on and so forth. And at the same time,

28:37.600 --> 28:48.240
 very different nations. Dubai compared to Singapore or to England. Very different yet.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.360
 The same outcome. So it seems to me like whenever we're looking at prosperity,

28:53.360 --> 28:59.680
 if a nation is prosperous, regardless of whatever other shenanigans they might be running,

28:59.680 --> 29:06.080
 whatever other operating software they might be running for anything that's not related to business,

29:06.080 --> 29:15.920
 if on the business side, they are proponents of a free markets or at least a base level

29:16.640 --> 29:21.280
 of free markets, we know that such countries will create prosperity.

29:21.280 --> 29:26.800
 So what are the aspects of the operating systems that lead to Singapore and to South Korea and

29:26.800 --> 29:31.040
 all that kind of stuff? So can you speak to different elements that enable the toolkit

29:31.040 --> 29:38.080
 for entrepreneurs? Sure, sure. And maybe here, let me just maybe illustrate it with my own story

29:38.080 --> 29:45.120
 and then I can take you back to... Macaulay, tell us your story. Who are you?

29:45.120 --> 29:47.840
 It's just because it started with me coming here, you showed me the robot and everything,

29:47.840 --> 29:50.800
 and now it looks like I'm no new for, we're no new sorry for talking. And then you're like,

29:50.800 --> 29:57.040
 tell people. And then, no, no, no. But so this is where this question, even when you asked me,

29:57.040 --> 30:05.600
 how do some countries become prosperous? That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so.

30:06.240 --> 30:13.040
 That's when my family moved me from Senegal for the first time of my life. I left my country,

30:13.040 --> 30:19.440
 I left my continent, and I was headed to Europe to go join my people, my family, my parents,

30:19.440 --> 30:23.440
 who were there as economic migrants. My parents had migrated for a better life,

30:23.440 --> 30:30.400
 as so many people have to. So many people have to, coming from poorer places, coming from low

30:30.400 --> 30:36.640
 income countries. So you saw the difference? Yes. Between the two places? How else would you call

30:36.640 --> 30:41.680
 it? Here you were in Senegal, minding your own business, causing tons of trouble everywhere,

30:41.680 --> 30:46.960
 you know, just being a happy, free wrench kid, but I was. Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker,

30:46.960 --> 30:51.520
 not just now. Okay. Life wouldn't be fun without you. And of course, I agree.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.680
 Right? So because even you, you know, like, and you're like all put together, like front,

30:55.680 --> 30:59.680
 I know there's a lot of trouble making behind you. Desperately trying to keep it together.

30:59.680 --> 31:04.400
 I know you are, but with me, I'm going to totally bring it out. So just, yeah. So.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.200
 So you saw the difference? Right. I saw the difference. I'm walking in here,

31:08.480 --> 31:12.400
 back home, and I tell people this story because to me, it's a defining story.

31:13.360 --> 31:20.400
 Back home, to take a shower. It's a, it takes time. Grandma has to, you know, make the short call,

31:20.400 --> 31:26.960
 catch on a little stove like you use at, you know, when you go camping. And then she puts a pot of

31:26.960 --> 31:32.320
 water on it. It boils. She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket, mixes it with some colder water.

31:32.320 --> 31:37.600
 Then we put a little pot in it. And a stronger member of the family has to drag it to the shower.

31:37.600 --> 31:43.120
 And then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower. Here I'm in Germany in the middle

31:43.120 --> 31:46.960
 of the winter. And my mom's like, my God, time for you to shower. I'm like, I'm not getting

31:46.960 --> 31:52.560
 naked. Where's the bottle? Where's the bucket of hot water? She's like, oh, you silly. Come on,

31:52.560 --> 31:56.800
 just jump in. And I jump in the shower, turn the buttons. The water is coming down temperature.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.800
 Are you kidding me? So amazing. I've been cheated out of life, my whole life.

32:03.440 --> 32:08.320
 So that's what happened. And then I, then, and then I'm like, oh, and all of these roads,

32:08.320 --> 32:13.280
 the paved roads, unlike back home, everything is like sandy and, you know, my feet are always

32:13.280 --> 32:18.160
 ash. I always have to wash off when I, when I go back home and your shoes get ruined most of the time.

32:19.840 --> 32:25.040
 And it started. And I had this question and it was just like, wow, how come they have this?

32:25.040 --> 32:30.000
 And we don't. So I was not being like, oh, you know, how come they have all of this money?

32:30.000 --> 32:34.640
 Oh, I was not that it was just like, how come? And I think what I was alluding to was,

32:34.640 --> 32:38.400
 how come life is so easy here and back? It's not.

32:38.400 --> 32:44.400
 And easy, not in a negative sense, in a beautiful sense. Sometimes I get, you know,

32:44.400 --> 32:49.040
 just having traveled through the war zone, just to come back from traveling through Europe,

32:49.600 --> 32:54.640
 back to America. It just, I'll just get emotional just looking at the efficiency of things. Like,

32:55.200 --> 33:02.400
 how, how easy it is, how we can, first of all, in Ukraine, you currently can't fly, right? It's a

33:02.400 --> 33:07.760
 war zone. Just even the transportation, you said roads. Yeah, the quality of roads in the

33:07.760 --> 33:13.040
 United States is amazing. Just not, you know, many of the places that drive in Ukraine,

33:13.680 --> 33:21.120
 you're talking about, I mean, really bad conditions of roads. And I'm sure in many parts of Africa

33:21.120 --> 33:26.080
 and many parts of the world, the world's even worse. Right, right. And outdoor, you know,

33:26.080 --> 33:32.320
 having a toilet, indoor toilet is a, is a, is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have.

33:32.320 --> 33:40.480
 It is, it is. And don't take me wrong, Lex. Do we have some great roads now in many parts of

33:40.480 --> 33:47.600
 Africa? Yes. Yes. Main arteries, great roads. You're like, whoa, this is moving. Yes, we do.

33:48.480 --> 33:55.440
 But definitely more today than in my time growing up. Do we have, you know,

33:55.440 --> 34:03.120
 a country like Nigeria that just birthed six unicorns last year alone? Yes. Do we have

34:03.120 --> 34:10.480
 the African youth out there being so amazing and, you know, living their lives? Yes. We have all of

34:10.480 --> 34:17.840
 that, but it is still unfortunately just like we're scratching the surface. And those people

34:17.840 --> 34:22.640
 still are getting all of that accomplished, literally swimming through molasses. This is

34:22.640 --> 34:31.760
 some of the most, most gross, immoral, unfair waste of human capital.

34:34.480 --> 34:41.200
 And so that is the, started with you, the seven year old asking, wait a minute,

34:42.080 --> 34:49.200
 how do amazing people in Europe do this? And the amazing people in Africa don't.

34:49.200 --> 34:54.960
 And that's a key word, amazing, because that's what I realized later because, and it was not

34:54.960 --> 34:59.920
 always like that for me, amazing and amazing, right? I knew instinctively that, of course,

34:59.920 --> 35:06.640
 we are amazing too. But so eventually the question became, how, so I went from, how can

35:06.640 --> 35:11.040
 they have this and we don't? To the country as I'm growing up and researching because it

35:11.040 --> 35:16.160
 stayed with me. When I tell you I'm obsessed, I'm haunted. I am haunted. So you can laugh

35:16.160 --> 35:25.040
 or you want, but it's, so the question became, the question became, how come some countries

35:25.040 --> 35:33.920
 like the United States, Singapore are rich and some others like mine and many others in Africa

35:33.920 --> 35:42.000
 are poor? That became the question. And along the line, like, along the road, I continued

35:42.000 --> 35:50.720
 on living my life wondering about this question. And I've heard all types of reasons as to

35:50.720 --> 35:57.120
 supposedly why that might be the case. Some people with a very straight face are still peddling

35:57.120 --> 36:04.080
 the IQ fury, according to which, come on, darling, it's not your fault. You know, your skin color

36:04.080 --> 36:08.960
 goes with a gene sequence that just doesn't allow you to be as smart as white people are.

36:08.960 --> 36:14.880
 And it's not your fault, but just accept it. That stuff is still out there. It's very real.

36:15.920 --> 36:21.600
 I, and I have to hear it. And others would say to me, oh, it's just because, you know,

36:21.600 --> 36:28.000
 you guys don't have adequate level of education. And I say, you know, maybe you got to go say that

36:29.360 --> 36:35.040
 to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal. You go up to any of these, to many of

36:35.040 --> 36:43.360
 these street sellers in Senegal. They are wading through cars and moving cars under the hot sun,

36:44.720 --> 36:53.280
 fumes thrown at their face, trying to sell you anything that you think you might be able to use.

36:53.280 --> 37:01.200
 Whether we're talking about an ironing board, to an umbrella, to Q tips, to, you know,

37:01.200 --> 37:06.240
 toothpicks, selling you whatever you need from your car. These are street sellers.

37:06.240 --> 37:15.440
 And you ask them, dear, do you have any degree? Yeah. I have this graded degree in math or in

37:15.440 --> 37:21.360
 literature or whatever. Some very, very educated people. Yet they're right there. This is what

37:21.360 --> 37:29.760
 they're doing. So that's just that scale wasted human potential. Thank you. So that has to do

37:29.760 --> 37:42.720
 now with the system, with something about the laws, something about sort of the things that limit or

37:42.720 --> 37:49.120
 enable the entrepreneur. Yes. Because at that point, I've heard this, you know, I heard people say,

37:49.120 --> 37:54.880
 yeah, your IQ is no good. Yeah, you're not, you don't have enough degrees or you're not educated.

37:54.880 --> 38:00.080
 Now, some people would even say is because you guys are malnourished. You're malnourished. You

38:00.080 --> 38:04.960
 need to be fed. Others, oh, well, maybe I give you some shoes and maybe something is going to change,

38:04.960 --> 38:09.840
 whatever. And then so I heard all of this nonsense like, but you guess what, but guess what,

38:09.840 --> 38:13.520
 none of them made sense. You know, I didn't make sense. Because if any of that crap was true,

38:14.640 --> 38:23.920
 why, oh, why is it that my parents are any other people from these places? And oh, and by the way,

38:23.920 --> 38:28.960
 some people call those places God forsaken land. That's also the type of

38:29.920 --> 38:32.480
 criteria I always have to hear when it's not just flat out,

38:33.200 --> 38:39.360
 SHIT whole countries from, you know, one person few years ago, president of this country.

38:40.160 --> 38:47.040
 That sentiment is sometimes there. It is. As I go on with my life, trying to find the

38:47.040 --> 38:51.120
 answer to why are some countries like mine poor while others are rich, I'm hearing all of these

38:51.120 --> 38:58.240
 reasons thrown at me. And then they make no sense. Because then how come then if my parents

38:59.200 --> 39:05.920
 move as it is usually anyone else who moves from a poorer nation to a nation that supposedly is

39:05.920 --> 39:13.440
 rich, all of a sudden, they get to manifest the greatest potential. So I'm starting to think

39:13.440 --> 39:17.520
 this has nothing to do with a person per se, because we're talking about the same person,

39:17.520 --> 39:22.960
 same background, same name, features, everything. Now I'm starting to think maybe it doesn't have

39:22.960 --> 39:27.440
 to do with a person. Maybe we're talking about something that has to do with the place that

39:27.440 --> 39:33.680
 they came from or the place that they're going to. So this little thing is starting to be in my

39:33.680 --> 39:38.160
 mind. Again, remember, this is not something that I woke up to overnight. I'm like, well, I got my

39:38.160 --> 39:44.000
 quit. It took me for a long time. And I had to, I had to, to face off, to have many different

39:44.000 --> 39:49.280
 ideologies face each other. I had to really have a reckoning literally in my heart and in my mind.

39:50.880 --> 39:57.680
 And so, so then that's what I'm thinking. It cannot be. It cannot. No, no, no, it's the same

39:57.680 --> 40:02.320
 people. It has to be about the place. But then what about this place? But then even about the place

40:03.440 --> 40:08.640
 you're thinking, again, two countries, different backgrounds, same outcome, same background,

40:08.640 --> 40:16.800
 different outcome. What is this? And then I go on. I start a comp. I am in Silicon Valley

40:17.520 --> 40:26.160
 in the late 90s, early 2000s, that come boom, all of that. And I'm starting to discover this

40:26.160 --> 40:31.600
 concept of this thing called entrepreneurship. You know, I'm in Silicon Valley and just getting

40:31.600 --> 40:37.280
 to experience what seems so cliche by now, but you know, people on the, getting together in the back

40:37.280 --> 40:41.360
 of a napkin, talking about an idea, you know, bring it out. And then they go out and they talk to

40:41.360 --> 40:45.280
 some, to some of these investors who's going to invest in it. Then they have the lawyers who get

40:45.280 --> 40:49.680
 to, you know, put all of this stuff together. And then they have the big four CPA firms,

40:49.680 --> 40:53.760
 this whole ecosystem of what they call of entrepreneurship. And then eventually this

40:53.760 --> 40:59.280
 concept of entrepreneurship being this, this idea of, you know, creating something out of nothing.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.760
 So there I am. And at some point, I become an entrepreneur myself. And the way I became an

41:03.760 --> 41:07.840
 entrepreneur was not like, I woke up and I'm like, I want to make money. So I'm going to become an

41:07.840 --> 41:12.560
 entrepreneur. You know, like, no. And this is also another problem I have with people who have a

41:12.560 --> 41:18.400
 problem with entrepreneurs or business people. Most entrepreneurs do not start a business

41:18.400 --> 41:24.560
 to become rich. Most entrepreneurs start a business because they have found, identified a

41:24.560 --> 41:29.920
 problem that bothered them enough that they said, enough is enough. I'm going to do something about

41:29.920 --> 41:36.560
 it. What entrepreneurs are, are people who criticize by creating. Do they always get it right? No.

41:36.560 --> 41:42.160
 As a matter of fact, the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous. It's, it's, it's kamikaze,

41:42.720 --> 41:48.720
 path to take the entrepreneurship path. We lose our spouses. My first husband passed away

41:48.720 --> 41:55.840
 as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet. And yet I had to keep going. What force

41:55.840 --> 42:01.520
 can keep you going after you just lost the love of your life? What force keeps you going?

42:01.520 --> 42:06.800
 The force of, oh, I just want to be rich. Really? When your whole, your whole world is upside down,

42:08.400 --> 42:13.920
 your whole world is upside down and you just want to quit. You just want to go meet him and

42:13.920 --> 42:19.680
 join him in death. I stayed. Why? Because of the same reason why I started my company.

42:19.680 --> 42:25.440
 I stayed because the women whom I had put back to work by then, we're talking about some of the most

42:25.440 --> 42:31.440
 vulnerable women in my country. These are women who grow the hibiscus, which we need to make the

42:31.440 --> 42:37.440
 bishab, which is the juice of taranga. Remember, this is our national identity drink. And for the

42:37.440 --> 42:41.920
 longest time, women grow this hibiscus that we use for the national drink, for the, this drink.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.640
 And now that Coca Cola, Pepsi, and all that had made it through the marketing that it is more

42:46.640 --> 42:52.320
 cool to drink those beverages. Now there is no more market for the hibiscus. And with that,

42:52.320 --> 42:58.880
 goes the livelihoods of these women. And for me, that bothered me enough because in that force,

42:58.880 --> 43:07.120
 I saw two things. One was a part of my culture. We're talking about, I mean, part of my cultural

43:07.120 --> 43:12.720
 identity for Christ's sake, the juice of taranga. You asked me what defines you. I said taranga.

43:12.720 --> 43:19.360
 There's a juice for it. So my culture is disappearing. And at the same time, these women

43:20.560 --> 43:24.880
 are sliding into abject poverty because what they used to make, no one needs anymore.

43:25.840 --> 43:33.920
 So that is what got me to start a company. And the company was created just because of that.

43:33.920 --> 43:42.000
 I wanted to build a company that would allow me to not only preserve this very important

43:42.000 --> 43:47.760
 aspect of my cultural identity, and at the same time, put these women back to work.

43:48.320 --> 43:52.640
 And maybe it's more difficult to put into words, but there's a kind of,

43:54.160 --> 43:58.480
 it's a basic human spirit where you see that the place we came from,

44:00.480 --> 44:08.560
 breaking apart in some kind of way, and you have the entrepreneurial fire that dreams of helping.

44:08.560 --> 44:14.960
 Yes. And sometimes it's hard to convert that into words. You have to tell nice stories and so on,

44:14.960 --> 44:21.200
 but it's the basic human desire to help. Yes. And get criticized by creating.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.880
 Especially when you've been, especially when, and let's face it,

44:26.480 --> 44:32.800
 do we all, are we all a bundle of circumstances, some happy, some worse? Yes, we are. And

44:32.800 --> 44:42.320
 oftentimes I ask myself, my God, why you? Why did you, why did you get to have the opportunities

44:42.320 --> 44:46.880
 that you have? What makes you different from, let's say, even your cousin that couldn't,

44:46.880 --> 44:52.960
 that is still home, trapped? Because we call ourselves trapped citizens. When you're trapped

44:52.960 --> 45:00.560
 in these countries that go nowhere, we're like a bunch of trapped citizens. So you see, Lex,

45:00.560 --> 45:06.560
 when my husband passed away, and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit and to send,

45:07.200 --> 45:10.880
 investors had already said, we understand if you want to stop, whatever you decide to do,

45:10.880 --> 45:16.960
 we'll do that. And I wanted to quit. And I was actually on my way. I was in Senegal for a month,

45:17.840 --> 45:25.200
 trying to really get a bearing over myself. And by the end of a month, I had decided I'm letting

45:25.200 --> 45:30.800
 go. There's no way. The pain was too great. Nothing made sense anymore. It was too much.

45:31.680 --> 45:38.080
 So I went to see this woman. And I talked to the one who, you know, we're talking back then.

45:39.040 --> 45:47.040
 There were 400 of them. Later on, we grew to 9,000. And I told the representative of all of them,

45:47.680 --> 45:54.240
 and I told her this is very, this very old lady. And just looking at her, I knew I was going through

45:54.240 --> 46:00.240
 some pain, but this woman has probably gone through 10 times. Not that pain is like measurable,

46:00.240 --> 46:05.200
 but you could tell this woman probably lost a child as oftentimes happened in places, you know,

46:05.200 --> 46:11.600
 that are lower income countries. Probably lost a husband also. Probably who knows.

46:11.600 --> 46:15.360
 So many people lost this part of our lives. You could see the pain. You can see the pain.

46:15.360 --> 46:22.400
 Yet she's so, so dignified. She's so dignified. And that already kind of made me like, my God,

46:22.400 --> 46:32.240
 stop crying. And I told her that I was quitting. I could not look her in the eyes. And she said,

46:32.240 --> 46:38.720
 look at me. I could not look her in the eyes. She said, look at me, child. And I looked at her.

46:39.440 --> 46:48.160
 And she said, you know, I know you're in pain, but where your husband is, where your beloved is,

46:48.160 --> 46:53.280
 is absolutely nothing that you can do for him. But for us, you can change everything.

46:53.920 --> 47:00.480
 And I went back. So that's what entrepreneurs are at their best.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.120
 Did she help you find your strength?

47:03.120 --> 47:12.000
 Yes. And I, I was, I was weak still, but I said, you put that aside. There's a job to do here.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.120
 And I went back. And that's, I fought with everything that I had. And this company that I started in my

47:17.120 --> 47:24.240
 kitchen became this company that had the who's who of a beverage world with, at some point,

47:24.240 --> 47:28.880
 Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo sitting on my, on my board, on my board.

47:31.280 --> 47:35.600
 Yeah, I went back because of that. So the reason why I tell this story for me is important,

47:35.600 --> 47:43.600
 because I've, the world needs to understand that there are so, that there is a much more,

47:43.600 --> 47:55.840
 there is a viable way of caring and of being part of a solution for the lesser fortunate

47:56.640 --> 48:00.720
 in terms of not keeping them where they are. And we're like, the savior is coming and,

48:00.720 --> 48:04.080
 you know, giving them food and all that. No, no, no, no, no. But it's like,

48:04.080 --> 48:07.600
 just like the leg up I got in my life, give somebody else a leg up.

48:08.880 --> 48:15.120
 What are the things you're fighting against in Africa when you try to build a business like that?

48:15.840 --> 48:25.040
 So then we're building this company. And back then, this was in 2004, that was when I built my first company.

48:27.040 --> 48:31.680
 We had to have two sister companies, one there, one here. So the one in the U,

48:31.680 --> 48:38.800
 in Africa was about the whole supply chain. And the one in America was, you know,

48:39.440 --> 48:46.080
 research and development, sales and marketing, all of that good stuff. And then at some point,

48:46.080 --> 48:50.640
 I look around, I'm like, wait a second. Here, back in the days, before we had the, you know,

48:50.640 --> 48:54.560
 like they would talk, they would say, oh, we have this one stop shop for business registration.

48:54.560 --> 49:00.320
 But the truth is, very quickly, you can set up an LLC in the U.S.

49:00.320 --> 49:06.240
 We're talking about less than, even then, less than, you know, today's super fast, 20 minutes online, done.

49:06.240 --> 49:13.120
 Back then, it was, you know, less than a few hours to get it done cost you almost nothing.

49:13.120 --> 49:18.000
 We're talking about a few hundred dollars, you know, three to three hundred fifty, depending which state you are.

49:18.000 --> 49:24.400
 So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time, no time, no time, no money, almost.

49:24.400 --> 49:31.680
 You don't have to know a guy that knows the guy that slipped some money to the politician and so on.

49:31.680 --> 49:37.840
 No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff. And so, at the same time, also, things like

49:37.840 --> 49:44.480
 Envisa can take you even to today's day. Okay, Lex, I don't know if you have employees on par or anything like that,

49:44.480 --> 49:52.320
 but do you have to go every month, or anybody listening to us right now, do they have to go

49:52.320 --> 50:07.280
 every single month to three different types of agencies, you know, like governmental agencies to do one step?

50:07.280 --> 50:16.160
 This one is basically you're going to go and give them your retirement money, like, you know, like the pension part of the salary

50:16.160 --> 50:22.000
 that you took out from your employee. You have to go to this agency and put that application through.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.240
 So you leave that money behind, then you go to another agency. This one is for the health, you know, care, whatever.

50:28.240 --> 50:34.480
 You have three of those places where you have to literally go to, in person, three times,

50:34.480 --> 50:41.040
 three places every single month to drop off these, you know, these paperwork.

50:41.040 --> 50:47.040
 Do you have to do that anywhere in the US? I mean, do we have that situation anywhere that you know of right now?

50:47.040 --> 50:52.000
 No. And do you think that's business friendly, or do you think it's cumbersome in business?

50:52.000 --> 50:57.200
 And that's not just cumbersome, sort of physically, it's cumbersome psychologically,

50:57.200 --> 51:03.600
 that there's a feeling, like the system around you, yeah, there's a feeling like you're trapped.

51:03.600 --> 51:09.440
 It's a feeling like the system doesn't want you to succeed versus a system that does want you to succeed.

51:09.440 --> 51:17.440
 Exactly. You're in a country like, we're in Texas. If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year,

51:17.440 --> 51:24.000
 you know, all you do five minutes, it takes you, you're filing, you know, your state, your franchise tax.

51:25.920 --> 51:30.880
 That's it. It's below that number. Tell them what it is. Then you have nothing to give them or anything

51:30.880 --> 51:40.000
 like that. You move on. Us, even if I make this much, there is a minimum tax that you have to pay,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.400
 which is a thousand dollars in Senegal right now.

51:42.400 --> 51:46.080
 For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.680
 You make no money. You still have to pay.

51:52.560 --> 51:57.840
 And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me when we had to try to get the electricity

51:57.840 --> 52:03.440
 hooked up on our first office. So we go, they say, oh, first you have to apply, you know,

52:03.440 --> 52:08.880
 like you normally, you have to apply. Then we apply, we pay the money. Remember again,

52:08.880 --> 52:12.560
 here you have to also go. This was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay.

52:13.200 --> 52:17.680
 And then we wait, and we wait, and we wait. And when I say we wait, I'm not talking about,

52:17.680 --> 52:24.880
 we waited 24 hours, waited 48 hours, a month, two months, three months, four months, five months,

52:24.880 --> 52:30.000
 you go, you send your assistant, she goes, she comes back. Well, they say we send it to wait.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.280
 At some point, I'm like, I got to go there. So I go there. And I asked her to speak to the head

52:35.280 --> 52:42.560
 of the district for, you know, and I'm just like going on and on and on and on about how we've been

52:42.560 --> 52:46.400
 delayed. This is going to be a problem. We have to produce. Everything is delayed.

52:46.400 --> 52:52.080
 And I risk losing my business. We already presold some of these products to our customers.

52:52.080 --> 52:57.840
 I got to, something needs to happen. So at some point, the gentleman looks at me,

52:57.840 --> 53:03.920
 he's like, lady, look over there. I look over there. I see a pile of paper this high. We're

53:03.920 --> 53:10.080
 talking about maybe hundreds of applications. Each one of them is a single, single, single sheet.

53:10.080 --> 53:16.720
 Each single sheet is an application for getting the electricity. And he says, do you see that?

53:16.720 --> 53:19.600
 I said, yeah. And he said, look over there. I look over there to the other side.

53:19.600 --> 53:25.360
 I said, two meters. He's like, each of these applications needs one of those.

53:26.080 --> 53:29.280
 How many do you see? I said, two. Then I knew I was in trouble.

53:31.200 --> 53:38.320
 And then I said, what do I do? And he said, lady, it's not at our level. And I agreed with him.

53:38.320 --> 53:42.960
 It was not on his level. But eventually, you know, by now you can tell that I pretty much get

53:42.960 --> 53:46.400
 what I need because, and at that point, what I did was not threaten him or anything like that.

53:46.400 --> 53:50.720
 I didn't even pay a bribe or anything, but you could see why people pay bribes. Because when

53:50.720 --> 53:54.560
 you have a pile like that, then the only way to advance your file, and that, by the way,

53:54.560 --> 53:59.520
 happens even at the passport office. You come, you apply for your passport, which is your right.

54:00.560 --> 54:04.960
 They force us to have passports. It's your right as a citizen to have a passport. And even there,

54:04.960 --> 54:09.040
 if you want yours to keep going through the process, you have to bribe somebody so we can go

54:09.040 --> 54:14.400
 even the phase it's supposed to go, let alone faster. So here, I'm thinking I have a problem.

54:14.400 --> 54:19.040
 And at that point, I did what I do. I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do.

54:19.600 --> 54:24.080
 I explained to him why I'm here, why I'm trying to do this. And even him said, lady,

54:24.640 --> 54:30.800
 someone like you, you have no reason to even be here. You could be back in America, living your life,

54:30.800 --> 54:34.560
 living the loka. You don't have to be here. So that, I think, gained a lot of his respect.

54:35.120 --> 54:40.960
 And I said, if you don't help me with this, I understand. I shouldn't be of a priority or

54:40.960 --> 54:45.680
 anything like that. But I beg you, I beg of you, I need, I need for this to go on this week.

54:46.240 --> 54:49.840
 And he said, okay, that's how I got my meter. One of those two meters became mine.

54:50.560 --> 54:54.560
 So then he said, but we have a problem. And I said, what? He said, well,

54:55.200 --> 55:00.800
 the truck, we need a truck to be here to do it because because of where you are from the pool,

55:00.800 --> 55:06.640
 we need long cable lines to get it all done. But the truck is, I don't know,

55:06.640 --> 55:09.680
 I don't know where the truck was because they had this one truck for I don't know how many customers.

55:09.680 --> 55:15.120
 So I go to the mayor of a town with whom I'm quite friends, but you see, I know people,

55:15.760 --> 55:20.720
 but it shouldn't be this way. So I go to the mayor of a town and I said,

55:20.720 --> 55:25.280
 mayor, he happens to have the same name as me. First, last name, same, but except he's the ugly

55:25.280 --> 55:32.160
 one. I'm the pretty one because, you know, he's, you know, that's so people can tell you apart.

55:32.160 --> 55:36.880
 She's exactly, I'm the pretty one and he's the whatever. So I got to a mayor and I'm like,

55:36.880 --> 55:41.520
 mayor, I need your help. You need to help me with this. He's like, now what? And I explained to him

55:41.520 --> 55:45.840
 and he's like, okay, you can take the truck from the from the from the city hall. I'll tell the

55:45.840 --> 55:49.760
 guys that they can allow you to have it and then they come and then you guys can do this.

55:50.320 --> 55:54.240
 And then we arrived there. Guess what? I thought I was done Lex, but I was not done

55:54.800 --> 55:59.040
 because now the electricity company, by the way, whom we paid, everything was there.

55:59.040 --> 56:06.560
 They've been sitting around for nine months by now. Well, we need a ladder long enough to, you know,

56:06.560 --> 56:09.920
 like one of the super, super professional ladders that normally the electricity companies have.

56:11.520 --> 56:16.640
 There's was in some other village and they didn't know if he was going to be back for another three

56:16.640 --> 56:23.760
 days or four days. I said, are you kidding me? He's like, no. So I call mayor again. I'm sick mayor.

56:24.320 --> 56:29.920
 Do you have a ladder? And I explained and he said, and that's how I got my electricity hooked up.

56:30.720 --> 56:36.320
 Otherwise, I probably would still be waiting. So Lex, you add all of these things together

56:36.320 --> 56:41.680
 and also the fact that in my country, by the way, the labor laws are so stringent. Basically,

56:41.680 --> 56:46.560
 you are married to employees for good or for bad. And some people say, oh, no, you're not married

56:46.560 --> 56:51.680
 for good or for bad, except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money to get rid of any of

56:51.680 --> 56:56.240
 them. It doesn't matter the circumstances. Do you think I really, an entrepreneur really need to

56:56.240 --> 57:01.280
 hear something like that? You know, the head of the halo, I had an argument with him at the UN

57:01.280 --> 57:08.880
 and I said to him, listen, and you listen to me very well. The reason, if you want to protect

57:08.880 --> 57:15.120
 employees, as you claim, everything you're doing is to protect employees. A, you know

57:15.920 --> 57:19.680
 better for human being than I am in terms of wanting to make sure that people are treated

57:19.680 --> 57:26.640
 right and fairly. But last time I checked, Google, for example, is not offering their employees

57:26.640 --> 57:33.360
 chef cooked meals, super healthy, anything they want, feeding them for a morning till evening,

57:34.320 --> 57:39.520
 having some, you know, babysitters or, you know, having healthcare, child care on site,

57:39.520 --> 57:45.520
 all of these perks that come on top of really cozy salaries. It did not happen because you,

57:45.520 --> 57:50.400
 the ILO, told them, you have to do this. It happened because there are enough jobs created

57:50.400 --> 57:57.840
 around that now you're in an employee's market and employers have to fall all over themselves

57:57.840 --> 58:03.440
 to attract the best talent among us. That's how it's done. And not with your nonsense

58:03.440 --> 58:08.640
 that you're imposing me right now, which the only results you're going to get, like in my country,

58:08.640 --> 58:12.480
 do you know what we have to show for all of these, the fact that Senegalese employees,

58:12.480 --> 58:18.400
 the most protected employee on paper in the world, well, we're one of the 25 poorest countries in

58:18.400 --> 58:28.400
 the world. That's what it got us. So let's try to untangle this. So there's a system in place.

58:28.400 --> 58:35.360
 There's a momentum with that system. Like you said, lady, it's not my level, which is for somebody

58:35.360 --> 58:44.640
 who grew up in the Soviet Union, at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard from people I

58:44.640 --> 58:50.080
 knew there. It's kind of this helpless feeling like, well, this is just part of the system,

58:50.080 --> 58:56.960
 this gigantic bureaucracy. And the corruption that happens is just like the only way to get

58:56.960 --> 59:03.040
 around to get anything done. And so the corruption grows. Maybe could you speak to the corruption?

59:03.040 --> 59:11.840
 Is there, to what degree is there corruption in Senegal and Africa? And how do we fix it?

59:11.840 --> 59:17.040
 So when you said to which degree is there corruption, I will respond to you the same,

59:17.040 --> 59:21.840
 I respond to people. I say, yeah, we have corruption. And it's almost as bad as in Chicago.

59:22.640 --> 59:27.840
 Right? So now, what I want people to understand when it comes to corruption,

59:28.800 --> 59:35.520
 it's because we are misguided with corruption. We think corruption is the root cause of problems.

59:35.520 --> 59:42.800
 When corruption is simply a symptom of a deeper root problem. In this case,

59:46.400 --> 59:55.040
 if you make the laws so senseless, meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws,

59:55.920 --> 59:59.600
 every time I have to import something in my country, I have a business,

59:59.600 --> 1:00:07.440
 we're making lip balms in this case and others skincare products. Some ingredients I'm able

1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:11.760
 to find in the country at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive.

1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:17.200
 Because for example, our products are sold at Whole Foods Market, you can understand it's a

1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:21.840
 pretty sophisticated and really, you know, they don't just put anybody on the shelves.

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:30.160
 But the thing is, it means that on the other end, my inputs has to be right. So out of those,

1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:35.200
 we have seven ingredients, seven items that need to come from abroad

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:40.800
 to go into the making of this product. Some packaging and some raw material.

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:49.600
 But guess what? For five of them, I am paying a 40% tariff and for the other two,

1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:57.040
 almost 70% tariff. That I call senseless laws. These tariffs are senseless.

1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:02.240
 The corruption is just a symptom. They reveal that something is broken about the laws.

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:12.560
 And the laws are so taxation, this kind of restricting laws, like laws that slow down

1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:14.400
 the entrepreneurial momentum.

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:20.560
 They do, they do. Because in this case, when my product comes, what do people have to do?

1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:27.520
 Because every time, if you add 40%, you're basically on the other end. So every time you add,

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:33.760
 if let's say my product normally costs a dollar and with your 40%, by the time I'm done,

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.880
 I had to pay, I had, now it's costing me 140. By the time it arrives in my warehouse,

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:45.680
 in my manufacturing facility, it's now at 140 because of a tariff I left behind. That 40%

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:50.720
 you added to it, do you know how much it's going to add to my final cost that once the product

1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:56.320
 is finished, I have to sell it to the customer? I have to sell it for $1.60 more because of that 40

1:01:56.320 --> 1:02:02.480
 cents extra you took from me. In order for me at the end of the day to have some type of profits,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:08.960
 because profits at the end of the day is the blood of a business. There are two people on

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:14.720
 misguided. They say, oh, you dirty, greedy business people. And it's all about profit,

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:21.200
 profit, profit, profit. I belong to this organization called, I'm a board member

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:28.240
 on the conscious capitalism. It is the largest organization of purpose driven businesses and

1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:33.680
 entrepreneurs. The type of people I told you about, we start our businesses because we see

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:38.400
 something that needs to be taken care of in society. Whole Foods Market is one of them.

1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:43.680
 The Container Store, all of these companies that are beloved in the US that you can hear of,

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:53.520
 we believe that the end goal of business is purpose. But in order to do purpose,

1:02:53.520 --> 1:03:00.560
 you have to have profits to stay in, to stay alive. And the best way for people to think of

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:07.360
 profits so that they're not all twisted about it. Lex, if I asked you, what's your goal in the world?

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:12.320
 You're probably going to tell me your dream. You're going to talk to me about what you're

1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:17.120
 doing right now and how you want to be uniting or you want a more harmonious world. You want

1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:21.440
 human flourishing. That's what you're working towards. That's what you say to me. You're not

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:26.080
 going to say, well, my biggest goal in the world is to produce as many red blood cells as I can,

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:33.920
 except you need to produce those. Otherwise, no Lex. And if no Lex, no one working. You know

1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:39.760
 what I mean? So that's how people need to stop with this whole profit non... Do we have some

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:45.120
 psychopaths among us? Yeah, one person of us in this world of psychopaths in every field,

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:50.000
 anywhere you look. And surely you find that in the entrepreneurial world as well.

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.640
 Yeah. So we have one person of us who are psychopaths for sure. But do they define the

1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:00.400
 rest of us? Absolutely not. And thankfully not. So let's just be clear on that. So here,

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:08.960
 you charge me 40% tariff, which is outrageous. Then you're forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:12.880
 than my competitor who does not have to go through that nonsense because she's an American woman

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.880
 who is operating in America and she doesn't have that nonsense put on her. So now I'm on

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:22.560
 this market competing against this woman eye to eye. So if we're selling the same value product,

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:27.760
 mine cost $1.60 more simply because of some stupid rules from back home,

1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:33.120
 then guess who is going to stay in business and who doesn't? See, they want to talk about equality.

1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:38.960
 That's the type of equality I want to see. The playing field has to be leveled.

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:41.040
 I told you English is a full language.

1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:47.040
 Well, it's two people talking. Between us, maybe we'll have this English thing figured out.

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:52.080
 We'll have it figured out. So the idea of capitalism, the idea of conscious capitalism

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:56.880
 is the thing that in large part enables this level playing field.

1:04:57.760 --> 1:05:02.240
 That's what we want. So what you're trying to say, so here, so when I talked about census laws,

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:07.920
 that's an example. So when you make the tariff so high that you're going to render me

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:17.040
 noncompetitive, then that's where for people who might make sense. When the product arrives at port,

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:24.480
 they say, hey, I give you this. What I give you, maybe it's 10% of the price or 5%. It's

1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:30.160
 surely not 40%, but you are happy with it. You're the government official. That's what we call a

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:36.160
 bribe. And me, I'm like, hey, I saved myself money. And also I saved myself time.

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:43.840
 But you see, if the laws where you pay 5% or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing,

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:48.160
 you come, you pay, you move on. Because who has the business of fooling around and staying behind?

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:53.360
 And no, you do that when it's actually makes sense to do that. So I'm not sitting here telling people

1:05:53.360 --> 1:05:58.480
 I engage in unlawful practices, in my case, because I'm around saying the things I'm saying

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:03.200
 right now. So I'm a target. You have to do things cleanly. And I believe in doing things

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:09.840
 that way. So what I had to do was go to the ask again, mayor, we have a problem. Mayor is whenever

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:15.120
 he sees me, he's like, now what? So I'm like, we've got a problem. Your best friend now.

1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:21.200
 So I say, now it's the customs. And he's like, what do you want me to do? I said,

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:25.040
 do you know anybody at customs? I need to hire up at customs because I got to explain to them

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:30.400
 what's going on here. They all know, of course. But I think they're not always maybe understanding,

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:36.240
 or maybe they understand. And in this case, he understood. So we went. And he's like, yeah,

1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:42.320
 I know this is not, this is not very down this. And I said, what do we do now? And I saw him

1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:48.000
 going through binders and binders in his office, because he's going to try to go and look where

1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:55.840
 in the law, can we find something that can help me escape these rules? And you know,

1:06:55.840 --> 1:07:02.160
 the best he found Lex was, oh, well, here, see, this one, if you've been in business for two years,

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:08.320
 then we can allow you, there's a special term for it, which French is technical,

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:14.320
 we can allow you to bring your raw material. But you have to tell us exactly how much you're

1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:17.920
 bringing. And it has to match your formulation, because, you know, they don't want you to bring

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:22.400
 in more that we need and maybe sell some of that to the rest of the market, and they didn't make

1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:28.640
 their money on it. So there it means I have to give them my recipe. Imagine Coca Cola being

1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:34.800
 asked to give their secret sauce to government officials in a country that you can't even know

1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:39.120
 what might happen. Let alone even in business, you don't do that. I mean, trade secrets or trade

1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:43.360
 secrets. But here you're asked to be putting it in front of some people who don't know where it's

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:48.720
 going to go after that, because there they get to see, okay, her recipe calls for X amount of

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:58.640
 of Candida wax, X amount of coconut, coconut oil, okay. And on top of that, we have to think about

1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:03.440
 how much Polish might they be or not, because again, we don't want her to buffer it over there.

1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:07.360
 So you have to get naked in front of them in terms of your recipe, which might end up only

1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:11.520
 God knows where tomorrow, maybe competition, or maybe even them, they start a business and

1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:16.880
 they compete with you, because we've seen that. So you have to do that. And then each time fill

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:21.040
 out a paperwork, get the approval, then it can come in. So when it can come in, you don't have

1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:25.440
 to pay that tax. Oh, and by the way, you only have one year, one year to make this product and get it

1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:30.960
 out. And all of it needs to be back out. Because if it's any of it stays here, you're going to pay

1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:40.880
 the taxes that we held up. So you're basically forced by these laws to be dishonest. If you

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:45.920
 want to succeed, all of this was so it's so cumbersome, because each it means more paperwork,

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.800
 paperwork everywhere, maybe having to disclose your things. So me, in my case, what I did is,

1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:56.800
 you know, this person said, okay, we're going to see how we can, how we can work with you.

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:59.840
 But for the first two years, we were more or less in the gray area.

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:03.440
 Yeah. So even gray area is good.

1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:08.480
 Yeah. But what does it mean in a situation like that, whenever they want to mess with you,

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:14.000
 it means they can come and they will look and they will find something. So it means that every

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.960
 day I'm trying to do business, I'm running the risk of being harassed and or maybe even put in

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:27.040
 jail depending on what it is. I mean, you're an incredible person because it seems like there's

1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:35.680
 two ways to change this, become president or gain power in the country and to try to change the

1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:43.600
 laws, which seems really difficult to do. And the other way is fight through the laws and create

1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:48.880
 the business anyway, build the business community and through that method create a huge amount of

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:54.480
 pressure to change the laws. You're totally getting it by, with your last part, because this is the

1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:01.200
 other thing. And this is where I get so upset sometimes with my fellow Africans because they

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:08.080
 get so disgusted by what they're seeing, right? And they think the answer is to go for politics.

1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:11.840
 Let's go be president. Let's go be this. Let's go be that. And we're going to change everything.

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:16.160
 I see that in the US too. People thinking that presidents have all this power. Do you know who

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:21.440
 is the least power in government? The president. I mean, people don't get that. Your best bet,

1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:25.680
 if you're going to, if you insist on going into politics, stick to the local level. That's where

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:30.320
 all the skeletons are buried and hidden. And that's where you can make the most impact,

1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:35.040
 local level. I know it's not shiny. I know it's not exciting, but that's where it's at. So if you

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:40.800
 must go into politics, but there's another way. So in my case, what I do is two things. I preach

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.920
 and I practice. I preach. When I'm here talking to about this, I'm preaching. I am sharing with

1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:52.800
 people that is which I found. And by the way, the answer was there. I was doing these two businesses,

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:59.520
 realizing the difference in treatment of the doing business environment of the US compared

1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:04.800
 to the doing business environment of Senegal. And at first I was like, of course, us, everything is

1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:09.520
 messed up. It's because we're a poor country. But when I started to put two and two together,

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:13.360
 I'm like, you're poor because you have no money, at least not enough money to take care of your

1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:18.880
 basic needs. You have no money because you have no source of income. Where does a source of income

1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:25.280
 come from? For most of us, it comes from a job, doesn't it? And some people sometimes at my UC

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.240
 Berkeley class, they say, oh no, it comes from government too. I'm like, I would like to think

1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:32.720
 that even if you work for government, you're going to be paid something, right? And they're like,

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:37.280
 yeah. And then even before I can say something, they're like, oh, yeah, because that money we used

1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:44.480
 to pay our public officials comes from taxes, employers, employees, we go back to the private

1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:51.040
 sector for most of it from where this whole thing is created. So it's clear. You're poor because

1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:55.200
 you have no money, no money because no source of income. Source of income for most of us is a job.

1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:00.160
 We're talking about so where do jobs come from the private sector, primarily small and medium

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:07.360
 sized enterprises, then don't you think that we should make it easy, that we should have

1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:16.400
 friendly doing business environment? And also a lot of the, a lot of it comes not just in the

1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:24.400
 small and medium sized businesses, but I think a lot of the value is created from new ones being

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:30.640
 launched. Right. It's not just like me like saving somehow through regulation, the ones that are

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:38.800
 already there. It's like letting the market, letting the new better ideas flourish. Yes.

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:43.360
 It's about what I mean by doing business environment is all the things that you and I

1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:48.480
 talked about earlier. Even the access of electricity is part of a doing business,

1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:52.800
 the doing business. So basically when I've discovered all of that, when I put all of those

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.320
 dots together, then I'm like, well, I guess the business and it makes sense. Like, if you want

1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:04.080
 to grow tomatoes, you're going to have to have two things. One is a good seed, right? That has

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:11.040
 good attributes. And then you're going to have to have a good environment for it. Is the soil

1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:16.000
 the right one? What's your pH level? All of those good nutrients that you're going to put in it?

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.320
 Is it in a place that has tons of sun? How much sun exposure or not? The climate

1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:25.680
 engineer is going to be cold, not not. You can't have some beautiful tomatoes in the middle of

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:32.400
 Siberia last time I checked. So same thing here. You know, Mohammed Yunus, the noble laureate for

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:41.600
 peace said, poor people are bonsai people. They're the same people. If you put them in the normal,

1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:48.880
 natural, friendly habitat where they can thrive, they become the tallest tree in the forest.

1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:55.280
 Poor people are bonsai people. So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree? That's the

1:13:55.280 --> 1:14:02.640
 tiny pot that you created by giving me such a hostile business environment that basically

1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:08.080
 we're put together by the set of laws that you have put that basically I have to jump through

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:15.440
 as a business person, practicing business in my country. If you turn that environment into

1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:23.440
 a friendly environment where I am not married to my employees, I have flexibility of the labor laws

1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:30.160
 are simple, straightforward, clean, where the tax code is very simple. It's not worth truckloads

1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:35.440
 of laws like in my country. It's so complicated. You have to hire a CPA which costs more money

1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:39.280
 and even them tell them, girl, we're going to make some mistakes. They don't talk to me like that.

1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:45.360
 They don't send me a call. They shouldn't. They better not. But they say, whatever they say.

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:47.360
 I'm scared. I'm scared.

1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:54.800
 But bottom line is, we're going to make mistakes. This thing is so complicated, we're going to

1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:02.000
 make mistakes. So which means my ass is on the line. So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple,

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:07.360
 straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas, where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing,

1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:13.520
 go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes, you're compliant, keep building your business

1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:20.720
 because that's what we need from you. If you made it so easy and straightforward, then you know what?

1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:24.240
 That's when you get all of these people likes what you're talking about saying, you know what?

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:31.440
 My name is Aminata and I live in the middle of nowhere Senegal. But you know what? I've got this

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:35.840
 great idea for this really hot, nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are going to love. I'm

1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:41.200
 hearing that hot sauce is a big thing. Let me bring it to them. But everything is there for you to

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:48.320
 jump into the ring of entrepreneurship. You don't have to know someone like my God. You don't have

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:56.080
 to even have the ability to sell yourself maybe like I can sometimes. You are someone with a

1:15:56.080 --> 1:16:01.280
 great idea. You're willing to work hard for it and pour everything you got into it. Guess what?

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:08.800
 It's there. You can get into the race. You can be a dreamer and you can be a dreamer in a rural

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:13.600
 little village and then that has ripple effects throughout the entire country. Young kids growing

1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:19.200
 up, you know, I want to be the next X whatever and it doesn't have to be, you know, the next Steve

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:27.040
 Jobs. That seems really far, far away. It's at all levels. You create local heroes because

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:36.000
 representation matters. And we are so badly in need of that. And so that's what all the things

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:41.200
 that have been stolen from us as long as things remain the same. So once I found out that basically

1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:46.640
 at the end of the day, the answer is economic freedom and that when it comes to that, the

1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:50.640
 indexes, economic indexes that measure that, whether it's the doing business index ranking of

1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:56.400
 the World Bank or the Frasier Economic Freedom Index of the Heritage Foundation, when you look

1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:01.760
 at all of those indexes and others, what do they have in common? One after another, they show you

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:08.720
 that it is harder to do business in almost anywhere in Subterran Africa than it is, per se,

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:16.000
 anywhere in Scandinavia. So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations, that socialist Americans

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.440
 tend to love so much and take as an example over there too. They're showing you that they don't

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:26.320
 understand what's going on really in Scandinavia. That Scandinavia is more capitalist. Scandinavian

1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:32.560
 nations are more capitalist than almost any Subterran African nations. Ultimately,

1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:39.600
 the political systems actually don't even matter nearly as much as the private sector

1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:47.360
 being able to operate the machinery of capitalism. There you go. There you go. There you go. And it's

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:52.240
 almost like, like I said, it's almost like its own little widget within it. You can have whatever

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:57.440
 type of society you want to practice, you want to exercise at whatever level you want to. But if

1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:05.280
 you're serious about becoming a middle to high income nation, there is no other pathway that we

1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:12.800
 know of at this point. And you know what made me super excited about that beyond having finally

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.840
 found my answer. I have to tell you, when I found that answer, I literally fell to my knees.

1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:28.080
 It was the type of feeling that, you know, if something is not well with you, whether it's

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:33.840
 physical or mental, something is not well, you're not well. And you go around and you go to the so

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:39.440
 called specialists, some of them, you know, but you're going around for years, going around trying

1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:47.200
 to get help for your ailment. And here they don't know. Here they tell you things that you can't

1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:53.120
 tell why, but you just know it's not true. There this, there that, and it's going on for years,

1:18:53.120 --> 1:19:01.600
 after year after year. And finally you meet this one person and boom, it's there. Not only the

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:11.600
 liberation, but also this whole new world that comes with it. You know, I'm still ill, but guess

1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:19.120
 what? There's a path forward. We know that. I'm going to have a lot of work to do, but there's

1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:24.960
 hope, right? And you're the beacon of hope, actually, for a lot of people in that part of the

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:29.920
 world. And that's those beacons are actually really necessary. So not only is there hope, but you can

1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:40.320
 become, I mean, the beacon for your people, your home, this power that you see that you feel all

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:50.400
 around to escape the feeling of being trapped. Is there advice you can give to people that,

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:58.800
 to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa of how to change the world?

1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:03.920
 That's right. And by the way, I want to say, there are bigger beacons, there are better beacons

1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:12.080
 than me. I just happen to be someone who has the chance of talking to you right now. And one of my

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:17.040
 goals is to open the same doors that were opened for me, because together, our voice,

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:26.160
 there's such amazing stories out there. And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:34.240
 One thing here for me, the reason why I do what I'm doing right now, and it's almost to the point

1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:41.760
 of self destructing my own health, I feel invested with such the mission of I have been afforded the

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:47.680
 truth. So it is my moral duty to try to take it around. I know I sound, people sometimes say,

1:20:47.680 --> 1:20:56.400
 when I listen to it, I feel like I'm talking to a priest. And I'm like, because the gospel, I receive

1:20:56.400 --> 1:21:03.520
 the gospel. So anyway, but the thing is Lex, who tells you these things to this day? When they talk

1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:07.600
 about the poverty of Africa, what do they talk about? They sit in front telling you, oh, yeah,

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:11.760
 it's because of colonialism, it's because of racism, it's because of imperialism, it's because

1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:20.560
 they're stealing raw material, blah, blah, blah. Is any of those guilty to some level of where we

1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:28.000
 are today, maybe part of the reason where we are today? Maybe, maybe. Is that the only reason

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:35.600
 or the overwhelming reasons? No. Is that insurmountable? Absolutely not. So for me, don't stay in that

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:43.680
 place of that steals and rubs you of your agency. So I think it's important for people to A, get

1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:47.360
 the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are. Because what you and I just talked about,

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:53.760
 the mainstream does not talk about this when they even talk about Africa in terms of, you know,

1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:58.800
 or not the usual suspect of, oh, famine is building over there, war is building over here,

1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:02.160
 oh, we're having Ebola is coming, all of that stuff. Even when they were talking about the

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:07.840
 monkeypox, which at first, you know, in this wave, it started with white people in Europe.

1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:13.840
 Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out, it's black people with monkeypox on their skin.

1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:18.560
 I'm like, wait a second, this time around, we did not start with us. So why are you always

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:24.320
 showing us when it's right now happening to white people, you know? So all of that is happening.

1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:32.720
 So for me, the thing is, we, the world simply right now, does not have the right diagnosis as to

1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:38.240
 why this continent right now, despite all of its riches, because Lord knows it's got riches,

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:42.960
 starting with its young population, 75% of the population in my country is below the age of

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:49.280
 25 years old. So when we're talking, I know we're talking about, you know, repopulation, you know,

1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:54.240
 it's an important, we're going to have to go for that. Maybe you'll get me going

1:22:54.240 --> 1:23:00.080
 about climate change. I don't know. But anyway, so here my point is, A, we need the right diagnosis

1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:04.000
 as to why this continent is the poorest continent in the world, despite its riches,

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.080
 starting with its young people, all the natural resources, diversity in land, people, cultures,

1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:15.600
 languages, everything that make, that make for great ingredients for, for awesomeness.

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:20.080
 Despite all of that, we are the poorest region in the world. People need to know that the reason

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:27.600
 why that is, it's because we also happen to be the most over over regulated region in the world.

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:34.480
 At the end of the day, with Africa, as an idea to say Africa here, and treated as one, we are

1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:42.720
 54 countries, 55 depending on how you count, yet we almost for a tiny minority of these countries,

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:49.840
 we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms that there are. If you're serious about

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:55.920
 prosperity building, we lack economic freedom. And economic freedom is the thing that unlocks

1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:02.480
 that human potential of the young people just. Yes. For them to run, to run with their ideas,

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:08.000
 to start businesses, or to start initiative. It doesn't have to be for profit all the time,

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.240
 right? But it is, it is, it is this thing that gets you to get up and go and do something,

1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:18.880
 criticize by creating. Young people are naturally wired to want to criticize by creating. They're

1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:23.120
 not sitting around waiting or complaining usually, unless you put them in a tiny box and they have

1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:27.920
 no other way to go. And in this situation, what they do, you know, let's talk about precolonial

1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:34.880
 Africa of four faves before slavery ever happened. There were black people in the, on the continent.

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.280
 You see, when we talk about the story of black people and Africans, Africans, you know, black

1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:46.320
 people in Africa, for most of us, even me, I noticed that unconsciously, it starts with slavery.

1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:51.280
 But you're like, no, we weren't there before. Before what men ever sat foot. Who were we? What

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:58.960
 were we doing in our diversity? What economic systems were we running on? And then you realize

1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:03.520
 that for most of them, they were free marketeers, and they were very much on the free trade, on

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:08.320
 the free enterprise side. So even that is a reinforcement. This is the place where we do

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:14.880
 not understand our history. So proper diagnosis, Africa is a poorest region in the world because

1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:21.120
 it happens to be the most overregulated region in the world lacks economic freedom. Number two,

1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:26.960
 what do we do about that? We got to become serious about reforms, economic reforms, so that we can

1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:33.680
 become beacons of free markets. Just like the Asian Tigers, that's what the Asian Tigers did.

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:40.080
 They had to become serious. Singapore, Taiwan, you know, South Korea, those guys had to become

1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:47.440
 serious about the free markets. Lee Kwon Woo, you know, when, you know, he's just like, we've got

1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.320
 to do something. And he looked around and he realized at some point, we've got to make these

1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:58.000
 reforms. And he went on to that journey of reforms, making his country one of the most free market

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.080
 countries in the world. And voila, the magic happened. Back in the, you know, in the 30s,

1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:10.160
 the stock market crash, and the Great Depression and everything, the world, and with all the lies

1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:16.560
 that were told to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin, while they were starving and

1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:21.040
 dying over there. But oh, no, you know, I mean, Durante was telling the world that, oh, no,

1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:25.520
 no, everything is going well. Nobody's dying when we know now and getting police surprises

1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:31.840
 based on this stuff. But then the world went on believing that, oh, no, capitalism failed.

1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:38.880
 This is this, this, this, you know, crash that you had in the, in the, in the stock market is proof

1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:43.120
 this is what least age capitalism produces. You guys always have your big ups and downs. And

1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:47.200
 by that time, it was so hard on people that they're like, we're done with this. And at the same time,

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:51.040
 we were told the lies coming out of the Soviet Union, that supposedly the communism was doing

1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:56.400
 just fine. And at that, you had the point where the free market concept almost died. And it's the,

1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:03.600
 you know, the, the, the Asian tigers who kind of helped, you know, bring that idea back to life,

1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:09.840
 right? Their success, having used the free markets. And so for me, we got to have, we got to

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:14.240
 make a new commitment to the free markets on this continent, if we want to go anywhere,

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:19.280
 if we want to go anywhere. And the timing is perfect because the young people, there's a,

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:25.680
 there is a kind of freedom for that revolutionary free markets in this whole space.

1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:29.600
 Exactly. And by the way, you said something, oh, say that again, because I want to tell you

1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:32.800
 what I'm hearing in that, because something's really cool. Say it again. Come on, Lex.

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:37.600
 I don't know which part. English is my second language too. No, you said, you said there's

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:42.400
 something revolutionary in, in that, because you know how young people are attached to a revolution

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:49.920
 and how, you know, I understand, look, look Lex, I understand and I am willing to give the

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:58.240
 benefits of the doubt to some of these socialists who cut, who came to it because they had to witness

1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:05.360
 some of the horrors of, you know, of their times, you know. There's a revolution behind that. It's

1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:12.480
 ultimately criticized by creating. Exactly. Exactly. But violent revolution is never the answer.

1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:16.080
 But that's what they went for in 1789 in France, you know, the French Revolution.

1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:21.200
 And then, you know, Marx and Engels, you know, they're promoting these ideas that usually,

1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:28.320
 for them, justifies violent revolution. Then in all of these people, I am with them when they say

1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:34.160
 that they want to see equal rights for people. Of course, I don't agree with their, therefore,

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:39.280
 we need to push for equal outcomes. Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not right.

1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:44.960
 So, but I am with them for all the way to equal rights, but this is where the two paths go this

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:50.880
 way. And also, they're, they're, they're none the fact that they have no issue with violent

1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:56.480
 revolution, that people get killed, you know, people get put in gulags and people get, that's

1:28:56.480 --> 1:29:01.920
 not right. So what you just said here, just give me goosebumps, because there is revolution in

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:06.240
 the free markets, but that's a type of revolution we want. The revolution that comes from people

1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:11.200
 creating, criticizing by creating, it's one of the best forms of revolution. If you ask me,

1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:17.440
 that's the most sexy way of revolution, criticized by creating. But what, you're gonna go shoot people

1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:24.800
 or be like, what's his name? Che Guevara, who tells you, I love, it's in writing, I love nothing

1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:34.400
 more than to fry the brain of a man with his gun. Really? Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:43.360
 that message of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy that has abused their power, they need to be

1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:48.640
 destroyed. And there's power in that, in the message of that violence. Unfortunately, the lessons

1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:56.080
 of history show that the violence, one doesn't work, but it does, it does the following. There is

1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:00.640
 something about human nature as the old cliche goes that power corrupt and absolute power corrupts,

1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:06.480
 absolutely, is the people who are in charge of committing that violence, it does something to

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:12.960
 their head. The first person you kill, the second person you kill, for some reason, you lose your

1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:19.680
 ability, the compassion for other humans, even if you began as a revolutionary, as the Soviets did,

1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:26.080
 fighting for the worker, for the, for the rights and the, the basic humanity of the people that

1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:34.640
 really do the work, you lose, you lose the plot somehow, because of the violence. So in that way,

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:40.160
 it seems like the lesson, at least of this part of the human history, until the robots take over,

1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:51.040
 is that the economic freedom, free markets, and protecting those and allowing anyone from your

1:30:51.040 --> 1:31:00.720
 country to dream and to make that dream a reality by creating it with as few sort of roadblocks as

1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:06.800
 possible. Exactly. So, so that's why for me, the message is very clear is what we talked about

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:10.960
 today. The reason why Africa is the first region of the world is because it happens to be the most

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:18.000
 overregulated region in the world. And for some people who might be, you know, put off by it,

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:23.200
 because they're like, oh, she's talking about laissez faire. No, let me put it maybe in a way

1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:30.000
 that you can understand. Do you think that it should be as easy for any person in Africa, for

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:36.160
 any entrepreneur in Africa to enterprise than it is for any person in Scandinavia to enterprise?

1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:42.960
 If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is, then you have a moral obligation to work with me,

1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:49.600
 to make my country and as a whole my continent more free markets. It's that simple. At that

1:31:49.600 --> 1:31:55.040
 point, there's no like, yes, but on the other hand, no. And for me on that question, and I

1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:59.280
 yet have to find somebody who claims to say no, if you say no, then we have a whole other problem.

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:04.640
 I'm not even talking to it at that point anymore. So, yeah. So just to clarify, you know, there's

1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:10.320
 a perception in some reality that Scandinavian countries have elements of socialism in their

1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:16.240
 politics and their society in their, even in their economics. So at the very least,

1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:24.560
 Africa should have, in terms of economic indices, should be as free as the Scandinavian countries.

1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:32.720
 You're just giving that example. Yes, because if the Scandinavian, they do have a subsidized,

1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:37.920
 you know, like a welfare system, that's what a more socialized welfare system. But the way

1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:43.040
 they make the money is very much the way of the free markets. So there is how you make your money,

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:49.360
 and then there's how you maybe decide as a country to redistribute it, right? And so

1:32:49.920 --> 1:32:56.960
 even there, even in Scandinavia, again, yes, they have more economic freedom. So then from

1:32:56.960 --> 1:33:06.080
 there, like where we go is my job and my goal is for every single African, young and old,

1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:20.560
 to know what I have come to learn. We are not doomed. It's not over for us. We will never catch

1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:27.920
 up. The time for catch up is gone. But guess what? We've got a strong, strong possibility and chance

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:36.400
 to leapfrog. And leapfrog, we will. It is still time. But for that to happen, like I said, we need

1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:41.120
 to know what we just talked about today, because that is not what the mainstream keeps us abreast

1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:47.040
 with. When you go to the World Bank, they don't necessarily work along these lines. They're still,

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:55.360
 it's not when you go to universities. I will ask you, MIT, the MIT econ department, or even some

1:33:55.360 --> 1:34:00.320
 of most of the professors, are they free market oriented? We find that oftentimes in academia,

1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:08.160
 there is a strong anticaptice bias. There is a strong anti free market bias. So this is a problem.

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.440
 This is a problem. Nobody cares about the economists anyway. So we move forward.

1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:20.880
 In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright, not in the economics department,

1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:26.480
 because they just write op ed articles, but in the dreamers, the young undergrads that

1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:31.440
 actually build something. No, I get that. But then we cannot be stifling their efforts

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:39.040
 by putting these artificially made regulations and laws that stand in the way and clip their wings.

1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:44.240
 So that's why when you were saying, what advice do you give to them? The advice I give to them is

1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:52.240
 each one of them, they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had. I don't ask anybody

1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:58.240
 to agree with me on face value. Go back, do like I had to do. I come very much from the left of

1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:03.280
 the left, if you can believe that. But I had to have my own intellectual journey. And in this case,

1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:09.600
 my intellectual journey was very much complimented by my own life, having to build these companies

1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:17.040
 on two separate continents and having to, I was, I had front row seat of the differences.

1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:21.200
 At first, I thought it was this way just because we're poor, and therefore we messed up,

1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:25.520
 and therefore it's like this. But eventually I learned that no, we're poor because we lack

1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:29.840
 economic freedom. And if the country allows its citizens the economic freedom to enterprise,

1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:34.880
 then they become rich. So I had it upside down, you see. And so it's important for people to

1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:42.560
 know that. So number one, know your facts because your facts will empower you. In this case, I like

1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:48.240
 to use that word. Facts will empower you and they will even furthermore, they will power you, empower

1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:53.760
 and power you. Because empower is like inside and power is like a push you forward and up.

1:35:53.760 --> 1:36:01.440
 So that's what it does to know the facts. And then go on and look around you. Where are the best

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:06.880
 practices of this? Who is at the cutting edge of a free market? Where it's done in a way where

1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:13.360
 people don't necessarily be left behind or anything like that. We're in 2022 for quite

1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:17.760
 sake. We don't have to do entrepreneurship the same way maybe it was done 50 years ago,

1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:22.000
 100 years ago, when as a community, as a people, we were maybe less enlightened because of our

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:28.720
 times, right? We can update this thing and move forward. But update is definitely not build back,

1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:32.640
 build back, what do they call it? Build back new or whatever they're calling it at the WF,

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:37.200
 you know, like whatever nonsense and stuff they're smoking over there. It's not that.

1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:43.280
 There are some principles that are universal and that stand the test of time. Those we have to keep

1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:50.640
 and on top add the new things we learned from our times and from life. So that's what I want them

1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:57.920
 to know. Learn your facts, be empowered, empowered, and then look around, think about and look to see

1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:03.440
 where the best practices are around the world because the world is yours. You might be African,

1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:08.080
 but the world is yours. So stop this nonsense of, oh, well, it's done by white people. So we're not

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:14.160
 going to do it. Get the best that exists in humanity for what you're trying to solve.

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:22.480
 And on top of that, put your own twist, right? Bitcoin is all of ours to take. Bitcoin is not

1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.160
 the white man's thing. So therefore, oh, come on, you know, because, you know, we have a misguided

1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:30.160
 pride. We're not going to use Bitcoin because it's white man stuff. Bitcoin is Matthew edit.

1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:37.280
 Math is universal. So it belongs to all of us. There's no color. Exactly. In the space of economics,

1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:44.400
 in the space of ideas, ideas, and there's a chance to leapfrog to exactly, which is really, really

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:50.160
 powerful. Exactly. Because here we will leapfrog. And let's, I'm not crazy. This is, this is going

1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:55.760
 to happen. You mark my words. But it's going to happen if as many people hear what we're talking

1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:01.760
 about today, because at some point, the solution is not going to come. It's not me. It's not,

1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:07.600
 it's going to come from the wisdom of the crowd. This is why I love the crowd. There's no better

1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:11.200
 wisdom than the crowd. And that's also why I believe in the free markets. This concept of

1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:17.200
 emergent order, there's no way, there's no central planning that is smart enough, that has the level

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:23.920
 of intel that street level people have. Trying to create something. It's just, we just have to be

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:29.680
 humble. There's just something at the bottom of a pyramid that just bubbles up and happens.

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:37.440
 They're the best. I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb is at the core of a lot of

1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.640
 things that prevent the flourishing of society. You know, this kind of anecdotally people are

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:49.520
 like, everyone is stupid and people say that jokingly. But the reality is people are incredible.

1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:56.800
 They have the capacity for kindness, for love, for innovation, for brilliance in all kinds

1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:02.000
 of dimensions. You might be, you might suck at math, but you might be amazing at carpentry.

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:07.360
 You have to find that thing. And there's something about, when there's freedom to find that thing

1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:13.280
 and people interact and get excited about shit together, and then they build. It's, if you look

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:21.360
 at authoritarian, at places that limit that freedom, at the core, I think, is the idea that

1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:26.080
 people are dumb. Let us take care of everything. We'll come up with the rules and the regulations

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:32.400
 because people are too dumb to manage things themselves. And then that idea builds on top

1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:38.960
 of itself where you think that the entire populace is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the

1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:44.400
 top. Then you add violence at the top of that and that leads to corruption, to corrupting

1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:51.600
 just the human mind of the leaders. And the whole thing becomes a giant mess. The antidote to that

1:39:51.600 --> 1:40:00.080
 is economic freedom. For people to have a freedom to enterprise. And look, Lex, when we allow for

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:06.880
 that to happen, have you looked around lately and looked at the level of niche that has happened in

1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:12.960
 this country? I mean, you have clubs where, you have places where people are into guitar strings,

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:18.240
 you know, like some of them. It's all about guitar strings. And others, it's all about

1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:24.160
 these best cupcakes. And others, it's all about this new crypto thing over here. And others like

1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:34.000
 hair, best, you know, weight. It's when you allow us because seven billion geniuses,

1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:40.000
 each one of us, I believe, came to this world with something, something that only he or her

1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:46.480
 possesses. And that is the genius. And it is their contribution to the human problem.

1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:52.640
 But when you think about your identity today, so it's all started in Africa, just like it did for

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:58.000
 the entirety of the human species. There's a bit of European flavor in there, a little French,

1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:09.440
 Silicon Valley, you're now in part a Texan, there's, you really are an American, but you're also

1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:15.760
 an African. Who are you when you look in the mirror, when you think about yourself, when you

1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:21.440
 listen, when everything gets quiet and you listen to your heart? Who are you? Is can you figure out

1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:28.880
 that puzzle? That's a very interesting question because it's been a long time I haven't asked

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:51.840
 myself I have before. What I have found is I think who I am today has been for sure shaped by

1:41:51.840 --> 1:42:00.240
 I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco, Dakar, San Diego, Paris, France, and San Francisco

1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:04.560
 primarily. And now, yeah, I think I might want to ask a little bit of Texan in there.

1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:13.520
 How do you say Texas in French? Texas, Texas, Texas. Austin, Texas. Austin, Texas. Austin, Texas.

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:33.440
 Austin, Texas. So you, I was formed by those three, I have to say that what I enjoy from

1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:46.000
 my Senegalese roots are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance very much. And Teranga, obviously.

1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:54.320
 And I like that it's a culture that's very much about reverence. It's big on reverence.

1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:02.480
 I don't think you could ever hear me tell an older person, especially not my parents or my

1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:08.720
 grandma or anybody like that, for us to be able to tell an older person that's not true or you're

1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:13.280
 lying would never cross my mind because that's the most disrespectful thing you can think of,

1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:17.360
 the most irreverent thing you can think of. It doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything

1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:24.800
 that's said, but there is a way to disagree. There is a way to push back that doesn't have to rob

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:30.480
 this person who happens to be older than you especially from the dignity that older age

1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:36.560
 normally provides. And there's wisdom to the rewards that you yourself may not see. So the

1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:44.560
 reverence is for the idea of wisdom of tradition. Exactly. Exactly. And again, so that is something

1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:51.840
 that I really enjoy, especially and something I'm very attached to, to this day. And then from

1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:58.000
 France, what I had to, what I really came to enjoy, of course, is all the fineness

1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:06.240
 that one can find within French culture. The fineness? Yeah, the fineness, foods. You mean

1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:11.840
 like the intricacies that like the very stuff? Yeah, the sophistication in there. I mean,

1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:20.400
 French lingerie, for example, I mean, la dentelle, you know, the laces, all of that super, it's

1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:26.880
 exquisite. So the fashion, the food, fashion, the food. I mean, there's something to be said

1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:32.560
 about all of that. And it's very beautiful. And I love also, even when I talk about fineness,

1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:36.400
 it's like a meal is not about like this big thing we put in front of you. But you know,

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:41.440
 smaller portions, enjoy what you're eating and spend time at the table. Like the eating time

1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:48.480
 is not necessarily just this function of feeding yourself, which I understand it. But for, this

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:54.480
 is something that they share with Senegalese culture is eating is a moment of communion.

1:44:54.480 --> 1:45:01.680
 It's a moment of friendship, family. It's a precious moment to this day. And my husband is

1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:08.800
 American. We eat our meals together all the time. There's, I would not have it any other way. And

1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:12.800
 there's a prep time, all of that stuff. It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it.

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:16.560
 Actually, to push back a little bit, it's interesting, because yeah, the camaraderie

1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:22.800
 over a meal is a beautiful thing. I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place because on the way

1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:29.440
 to Ukraine, I traveled to Paris, and I stayed in Paris, and I wasn't able to enjoy the fineness

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.240
 because it was almost a distraction from the humanity for some reason to me, because there's

1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:43.200
 such a focus on the art of it all that you lose the basic connection to humanity. Now, that said,

1:45:43.200 --> 1:45:48.400
 depends what you're talking about. I think some of the lack of connection over humanity was the

1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:52.960
 humanity was the fact that while I did know how to speak French for a long time, I forgot most

1:45:52.960 --> 1:46:00.800
 of the language. And so part of it, there is a barrier. You said hospitality. There is a bit

1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:08.000
 of a barrier in French culture to where in order to be welcomed in, you have to, you have to hear

1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:14.960
 the music and be able to play the music of the people. And if you don't, there's a bit of a

1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:21.840
 bit of a barrier. I must admit on that and that it is true. You would feel less that if you were

1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:27.120
 with a group of Senegalese people per se, or I would even say if a group of Spanish people.

1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:33.200
 And I think this has to, this is maybe the other side of it for the French people, they can be a

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:37.520
 little bit, you know, up a little bit up there. And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there.

1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:42.880
 If you don't have the codes, which is what you call the, if you don't sing the music,

1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:48.240
 then it's hard for you to be part of it. But I was speaking here from the standpoint of you're in.

1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:55.600
 From the inside. Also, come on, come on. Coming from Texas and also Ukraine. Ukraine,

1:46:55.600 --> 1:47:02.800
 I should say, some of the best steak and meat I've ever had. Cheap. Texas, some of the greatest.

1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:10.880
 The size of the meals in France, it's like, what are we doing here? I get it. I get its art.

1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:16.320
 But I'd like to look at my art on the wall. No, okay. And then eat my damn steak.

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:20.960
 Did you go, so maybe, okay, no, no, no, no, okay. Now here I have to defend them, although sometimes

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:25.600
 I'm the worst. No, you, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant? Maybe that's why.

1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:29.440
 Yeah, a little bit, a little bit. That's why. Because next time you go to France,

1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:38.320
 I'll take you to the countryside or any French home. They will serve you multiple times. I mean,

1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:43.040
 you're, by the time you're done, even if it's, you know, the portions are smaller,

1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:46.800
 they're smaller if you want to, but because that way you get a chance to really, you know,

1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:50.480
 feel what you're eating and then have more and then all of that stuff, but not be like this.

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:54.800
 And then, you know, but no, you'll eat plenty, but it's because you went to the Michelin places

1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:59.520
 where they were like. I'm sure the warmth and the people's there. It's almost makes me sad

1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:05.040
 that sometimes, I think to properly be in a place, you really should spend a long time there and

1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:09.680
 also be emotionally ready. Again, I was emotionally unavailable. I just like,

1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:13.040
 Well, I would imagine a new way to be Ukraine. I'm like, who can think about food?

1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:17.360
 But in your identity, a bit of Texas, a bit of San Francisco.

1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:25.120
 And yeah, San Francisco. And, um, I guess from America, the defining, the defining

1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:32.320
 thing for me for America is it's the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset.

1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:38.320
 See, very quickly, when I moved from France to the United States and I started becoming successful

1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:43.360
 in the United States, I found myself, me and my husband, he was French and my first husband,

1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:50.080
 he passed away. We found ourselves at some point, we stopped talking to our friends in France who

1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:57.040
 stayed in France because we were talking to them about things that were so outside of their,

1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:05.440
 their, their comprehension. What do you mean you're in your twenties and, um, you know,

1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:10.240
 you just raised, um, I don't know, a million dollars or two million dollars, especially

1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:12.640
 from back in those days today, you know, it's easy here and there.

1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:16.080
 So even in France, that entrepreneurial spirit didn't burn quite as bright.

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:20.720
 I mean, I mean, don't take me wrong. Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France?

1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:25.520
 Yeah. But to the level that you have it in the US, absolutely not. It's just, uh, I mean,

1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:30.160
 in France, it's still very much, you know, you're born in this area, you go to school in that area,

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:35.040
 your parents live around, eventually you'll marry and be where your parents are, or maybe

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:40.400
 go to where your spouse's parents are, and you buy your house and you buy it once and you're

1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:44.000
 not going to do like the Americans two years later, I sell my house or go somewhere else.

1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.320
 You don't have any of, and what do you mean, you know, like just stopping from nowhere,

1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:51.760
 you're going to do a bit, you're going to do what? Start a business and you have nothing to back you

1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:58.160
 up or whatever. Oh, and, um, even this idea of, um, you know, going and fundraising this venture

1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:02.080
 cap, especially back in the days, venture cap, all of that is, it's very American. We take it

1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:07.360
 for granted, but it's very American. Who would have made a bet on me in France? The same person,

1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:12.800
 I would not have found the same people. I would never in France have been able to, um,

1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:16.560
 raise it, you know, at some point it was $32 million for my first business, never would have

1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:19.920
 been able to do that in France. And it doesn't mean that French people are bad people or anything

1:50:19.920 --> 1:50:25.200
 like that. It's just, um, something that's just not so in the culture, right? Just like, um,

1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:28.960
 this whole concept of philanthropy, it's not that the French people don't do philanthropy,

1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:34.880
 but philanthropy in America is very different from the level and also the magnitude of maybe

1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:38.720
 what the French people do. And also they have this, um, always like, oh, let's do it

1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:42.800
 behind the scenes. Money is suspicious, you know, success is suspicious. So at some point,

1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:46.480
 my husband and I just felt like our friends actually were maybe thinking that we're maybe

1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.880
 some drug dealers or something. So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore.

1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:58.560
 And so, um, so yes, in America, I found, I found this, um, this, um, entrepreneurial spirit,

1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:03.680
 but then I was able to link it with something that I'm very familiar with in my country.

1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:08.720
 See, back home in Senegal, um, I'm part of this, um, you know, you have what we call the

1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:13.600
 murid. I'm a murid. So what it is is, uh, one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal,

1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:18.080
 muridism is the most influential of them and the biggest one. And, um,

1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:23.280
 us, it's all about entrepreneurship as well. I mean, of course, there's the whole religious part

1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:30.320
 and, but our mantra is pray as if you will die tomorrow and work as if you will never die.

1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:34.480
 And the way we say, the way somebody will say that somebody passed away,

1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:40.720
 we say, somebody has retired. Somebody has retired from their work, right? Beautiful, right?

1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:48.720
 So, so, so I think, um, it's funny because in, in that community, we're very much entrepreneurial,

1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:53.520
 um, you know, left to our own devices where entrepreneurial, but then what happens is the

1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:57.920
 minute people start going to, they're being educated through the education system, you know,

1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:01.520
 like the French, uh, especially the system that tend to breed more like, you know,

1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:06.160
 the French bureaucrat mindset, then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset kind of starting

1:52:06.160 --> 1:52:13.360
 to dwindle down. So it's kind of very interesting. So in a way, America helped me reunite with that

1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:21.120
 side of my, of my roots, where America tells me reinforces that side of my roots and also gives

1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:27.120
 me more tools to practice that side of my roots. If that makes any sense, uh, through all of that,

1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:32.000
 that's what, uh, brings out the heart of a cheetah, which I think is a beautiful, beautiful

1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:39.040
 thing that encapsulate that whole trajectory, which I think is the best possible answer anyone

1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:45.920
 could give. It makes me want to really think about who I am because you really have brought together

1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:53.360
 so many cultures within yourself that just talking to you makes you feel like we are just all one

1:52:53.360 --> 1:53:00.640
 people. Because at the end we are, at the end we are. Um, and, you know, when you come from, um, at

1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:05.360
 the end we are, and also I think for me, if people can take anything from my story,

1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:11.360
 it's at the end of the day, I am very care about it. And, uh, I'm all for harmony among people and

1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:21.120
 among, um, among us peoples. Um, if we can accept that we're all, I know this sounds so cliche,

1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:28.080
 but for me it's so true that we're all humans. You know, when I left Senegal, when I was about

1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:32.640
 to leave Senegal for the first time and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents,

1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:39.120
 because now they had emigrated and things were going to be fine. And I was going to be,

1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:42.880
 things were stable for them. Now they're like, it's time to be reunited with her.

1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:48.080
 They brought me over, but before I left Senegal, my grandma sat me down. She,

1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:53.280
 actually she lowered herself down to my level and she said, said, my God, you're about to go to this

1:53:53.280 --> 1:54:00.000
 place where most people will not look like you. And most people speak a language that's going to

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.320
 be different from yours. And you're going to realize that all the kids are going to school and you're

1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:08.240
 never been to school because, you know, I was, like I said, a free range kid and I was just living

1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:15.120
 my life. And she said, but I don't want for any of that. And she showed her words that I don't

1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:21.280
 want for any of that to intimidate you. She said, you can be impressed by some of it if you want,

1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:26.000
 but no intimidation. And she said, because the fact that they might be different from you,

1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.240
 yeah, they're going to have a different skin color from you, but it is still human skin.

1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:34.240
 You're human, they're human. And she said, this language you're going to speak,

1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:40.080
 it's a different language from yours, but it is still a language that humans speak.

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:46.800
 You're human, they're human. Therefore, you can speak it. And lastly, they have gone to school.

1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:52.000
 Going to school is what little humans do. You're a little human. So you'll be just fine.

1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:59.040
 And I went and grandma was right, right? It was right. And that helped me. And I think when you

1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:07.360
 internalize that so early on, it just makes you belong to the human family that you're part of.

1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:13.200
 I am part of a human family. And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example, let's take

1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:19.280
 and be totally open. Maybe don't go right now, but no, not now, maybe not now, you're right.

1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:25.040
 But at least don't bring weed if you go on the plane. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:30.480
 Yeah, right. That girl, I don't know what she was thinking, but no. So, but what I'm trying to say,

1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.360
 Lex, is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world, including some of the most

1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:40.560
 unfriendly places in the world to someone like me, because there are places like that.

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:49.600
 And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere, someone will take care of me. Someone will help

1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:59.040
 me. When I first came to this country, I came as a tourist. And, but, you know, you had this

1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:06.480
 amazing family who had a business, a family business in Indiana, Columbus, Indiana, the Wences,

1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:11.600
 Carolyn Eldon Wences, I owe them everything that I have in this country, that I am in this country.

1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:20.080
 They are Americans in mid America, from a place that most other Americans would maybe,

1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:23.360
 you know, look down on because, you know, and some people would be like, oh, you're going to this

1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:27.360
 place where they have more churches and cows than people, you know, that type of behavior.

1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:32.800
 Because, you know, the elite, the coastal elites, but it is in Midwest, in the Midwest,

1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:42.160
 that I found that I, black, young women, coming out of nowhere, found support.

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:46.720
 They all rallied around me. I didn't even come from the same faith as they are from.

1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:54.800
 Yet their whole church rallied around me to find me an apartment. My host family found me, got me

1:56:54.800 --> 1:57:00.400
 a job, and it was not a pity job. They were like, we need, we are in serious needs of getting our

1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:05.200
 accounting under control and our marketing and all of that. And I had to catch up years of

1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:11.040
 accounting like to the cent and come up with marketing, all of that. And I did it way faster

1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:14.400
 than they thought I would ever be able to do that. At some point, they look at me and they're like,

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:21.120
 look, there is a future for you. And we are too small for that future. And now we could be,

1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:24.880
 we could be selfish and keep you here with us. And we wouldn't, we would want nothing more than

1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:28.560
 that. Because really, they like my parents to this day. I just came back from seeing them.

1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:35.200
 And they said, but there's so much more for you. And we don't have it. So we want you to go and

1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:38.800
 find out what it is. And that's eventually when I, you know, because something was

1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:43.920
 growing up in San Francisco, when I say, I left my heart in San Francisco. Because,

1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:48.720
 you know, my, my, the man would become my husband. We went to the same business school in France,

1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:53.280
 but then he was older than me. So he had come to San Francisco and started a business there.

1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:55.840
 And I just looked like there was something there. And Scarol was like,

1:57:55.840 --> 1:57:58.960
 you got to go to San Francisco and find out with Emmanuel what's going on.

1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:02.320
 So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco. I came back and I'm like, okay, I'm leaving.

1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:08.960
 Here's the keys to my apartment. But I'm out of here. So no, but Carol, so this is it. This is

1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:14.000
 what I'm saying, especially in these times when this country loves to dwell on, you know,

1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:17.920
 you're bad because you have this skin color. Here are people with a completely different

1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:23.520
 skin color than mine, completely different faith than mine, yet embraced me, protected me,

1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:31.040
 paid for my visa, you know, for my, for my lawyer to, for my H1B, everything, and also

1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:37.680
 played emotional support for me. And no one, no one asked them to do that. They didn't have to

1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:42.160
 do it. They didn't. So what I'm saying is, and this has been the story of my life,

1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:48.640
 everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me, you bet you have that there's always,

1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:52.960
 always going to be somebody who shows up for you and somebody who is at the,

1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:57.920
 at the extremes of, at the antipods of where you are and who you are. And that tells me something.

1:58:59.200 --> 1:59:02.480
 In the end, we are good people. Most people are good people.

1:59:02.480 --> 1:59:09.920
 And there's so much power to that. The internalizing of this idea that we're all just human.

1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:17.200
 And there's human kindness all around us. I've seen it a lot where people internalize that.

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:26.240
 And they're able to walk lightly amidst hate and walk past it. And it doesn't, it doesn't

1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:32.960
 stick to them in a way that they build resentment and it paralyzes them.

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:38.240
 If they internalize the world as human, they can be in the, just like you said, in the,

1:59:38.240 --> 1:59:40.560
 in the worst places in the world for them.

1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:44.320
 And someone, somewhere that human magic and touch is there.

1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:46.720
 Yeah. You'll find, you'll find them.

1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:50.240
 It will find, yeah, yeah. And you know, the other thing too, Lex, is,

1:59:50.240 --> 1:59:57.200
 especially in these times we're walking in, it is to remind yourself, I think this is where

1:59:57.200 --> 2:00:04.000
 we all are called to practice more, more courage. I call it courage. It's the courage

2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:10.000
 to show up with curiosity, with empathy, and with love. To me, those three are the antidote

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:12.000
 to pretty much anything.

2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:12.480
 Yeah.

2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:18.480
 Curiosity and to be in love. In the face of fear, can you, can you show up with curiosity?

2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:24.080
 In the, in the face of hate, can you say, I'm going to, I'm going to engage with love,

2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:29.520
 even if I'm scared to death and even if I'm pissed off to death by this, but can you do that?

2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:35.840
 In the, in the face of just like, you know, judgment or whatever, can you show up with

2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:43.200
 empathy? And I had just found that when you try to do that, you, you engage very different

2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:47.760
 parts of your brain that's, that's proven by the way by the brain scientists, but you also

2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:51.360
 can feel it in your body that you're engaging very different parts of your soul.

2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:57.600
 And so I try myself, I'm not always good at it, but it's a practice that I try to honor,

2:00:57.600 --> 2:00:59.600
 which is curiosity, empathy and love.

2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:05.200
 As I told you offline, those, I agree with you a hundred percent on that, but there is,

2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:12.400
 you know, when you go to Ukraine and, and you can say, you can speak about the power of love,

2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:18.000
 but when you lose your family, when you lose your home, all you have in your heart is hate.

2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:24.080
 Even if you know it, you're not supposed to have it. You still, all you have is hate. So sometimes

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:29.760
 it's, it's a very human thing to have resentment, to have hate,

2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:35.680
 but it is, but it is about trying not to stay there and it's okay if it takes you years,

2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:42.480
 but it is about trying and I mean the word trying. It is about trying not to stay there.

2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:47.520
 Let me ask you about some of the things you see in this country from your,

2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:51.840
 from your perspective of everywhere you've been in the world. What do you think about

2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:59.440
 the Black Lives Matter movement here in America that does struggle with the role of

2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:09.440
 skin color today and throughout the history of this country, maybe even throughout the history

2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:18.320
 of the world? Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me because do Black Lives Matter,

2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:23.120
 those three words together in that order, what do they mean? They mean everything

2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:29.120
 because Black Lives do matter as any other lives do matter, but I know in this case why they say

2:02:29.120 --> 2:02:36.160
 Black Lives Matter because some of the context we have had. Now, while I agree with the principles

2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:42.880
 that Black Lives Matter, I have a big problem with the organization and what it stands for.

2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:50.480
 When I have an organization that pretends to want to stand for Black Lives Matter,

2:02:51.360 --> 2:03:02.720
 yet you are self proclaimed Marxist socialists, I pause. Why? I pause and then I'm like,

2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:09.040
 have we learned nothing? Have we learned nothing? And the reason why I say that

2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:18.160
 is because 60 some years ago, it started before even 60 some years ago,

2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:29.360
 Black people in this case, I'm talking about the African people, I'm talking about

2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:41.440
 the Black Africans who would go on to really cement this concept of African emancipation

2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:49.200
 and African liberation. And here I'm taking us back to 1945. They had four of them before that,

2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:56.720
 but in 1945, in Manchester, UK, happened something that would become major for

2:03:56.720 --> 2:04:06.800
 Africa and its future, especially subterranean Africa. In Manchester, UK, people like Blaise

2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:18.240
 Diagne of my country, Nira Ray, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana, and others and others from different

2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:27.360
 parts of the continent got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B Dubois. And I say Dubois because

2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:32.640
 that's how we say it in French. He has a French name, a French name at least. And Americans would

2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:38.480
 say, so for Americans listening, I know you say Dubois, but Dubois, no, because just in case they

2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:44.480
 like who's talking about, that's what I'm talking about. So all of those people got together in the

2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:54.080
 UK. And with W.E.B Dubois and Marcus Garvey, big top African American intellectuals of their times.

2:04:56.320 --> 2:05:00.960
 W.E.B Dubois had so many things happened to him, starting from the north, being more or

2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:07.440
 more or less a liberal type guy, came to the south just to see at this time,

2:05:08.320 --> 2:05:13.360
 Black people being lynched and some of the body parts being shown in store windows.

2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:19.360
 I mean, just for a second, we put ourself in his shoes. I put myself in his shoes.

2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:24.480
 And that's when he started to become radicalized, right? Because at first it was like, oh, reforms,

2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:28.160
 isn't that? And I was like, God darn it, and maybe these people, we don't talk to them, we force,

2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:32.960
 you know? And eventually, little by little, things going through,

2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:39.280
 yeah, you have these people, they're very much on the Marxist socialist train.

2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:45.440
 So do you think the sort of, it's the political movements that are just using?

2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:52.480
 Yeah, because what happened back in those days, it is true that to their credit,

2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:58.880
 communist socialists were fighting for equal rights. They were fighting for the rights of Black

2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:06.960
 people to have equal rights. So of course, I could see why one could say, especially in these times,

2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:18.160
 you're being lynched, bodies burnt, body parts showcased at window stores.

2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:30.800
 Meanwhile, in Africa, under colonization, in your own country, in your own land,

2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:44.160
 and you have this group that's saying, we, your fight is part of what we fight.

2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:52.960
 Of course, you're going to say aside with you, especially if this is all happening at a time

2:06:52.960 --> 2:07:03.280
 where, you know, so 1945, these guys who would be the liberators of various African nations,

2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:11.760
 they're meeting with Garvey, with W.E.B Dubois. And that's where this meeting is very important.

2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:15.920
 It's the fifth Pan African Congress meeting. It's very important. It could be the last one,

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:21.200
 but it's the most important one because that's when they formed their plans and really the

2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:27.280
 rallied around this concept of African emancipation and African liberation. We're going to liberate

2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:34.320
 our countries. Then later, so that's how all of these movements started to happen. And from there,

2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:39.360
 Gandhi was already making some progress with India, you know, getting them out of British rule

2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:42.640
 and all of that. So all of this was happening and really like this whole thing was bubbling,

2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:48.160
 bubbling, bubbling, you know, like there's like a new force going on. And then we arrived in late 50s

2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:54.160
 and, you know, Krumah with them, you know, then with the British as well, they might

2:07:54.160 --> 2:08:02.240
 manage to become, to become, their colonization is over. They're the first one to go in, 57.

2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:06.560
 Then from there, it's what we call the independences. That's what most Subterranean

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:11.600
 African nations are getting their independences, different dates, mine, April 4th, 1960. So all

2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:16.000
 over. So this is happening. And now think about it, you're talking 57, you're talking 60.

2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.960
 We're like at the, we're like at this time now with the middle of a cold war.

2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:24.480
 Because we have to put things in context if we want to understand what's going on.

2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:28.800
 Because people today ask me, why do you think, because even now when they understand, oh,

2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:32.720
 you're right, it makes sense. If you have no economic freedom, you're going to be poor.

2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:36.720
 But why, why, why did they go for this? Why did they go for this? And then they don't understand.

2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.080
 So that's what happened. So beginning of the day of times, precolonial Africans were free

2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:47.120
 marketeers, free enterprise. It's pretty well recorded by someone like George Ayute. That's

2:08:47.120 --> 2:08:52.400
 where I got the cheat I think from. And Ghanaian economist, and then slavery happened, colonialism

2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:58.720
 happened, and then the independences, late 50s, early 60s for most Subterranean African countries.

2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:04.080
 So there what you have is, but then what happened there? So I told you in 45,

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:12.000
 5th Pan African Congress in the UK with the liberators of Africa under the under the leadership,

2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:18.400
 because he was the wise, you know, eldest man. Dubois was, he was in his 70s back in the day.

2:09:18.400 --> 2:09:22.000
 So he's older than them, you know, and he's coming with all of his ideas and everything.

2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.360
 So they're like, so there they are. Now in the late 50s, early 60s, we're starting to make progress

2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:31.840
 with the independences, you know, India has gone there before. So all of that is starting to happen.

2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:40.160
 And at that time, remember, they, they already were being introduced to the concept of socialism,

2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:48.000
 Marxism, all of that way before by some of these, you know, black African American intellectuals

2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:54.560
 of their time who were very socialist Marxist by that time. So now they're becoming independent,

2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:59.040
 because I do, I do independent like this, because I, I reckon that there's still

2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:05.760
 neocolonism going on. So now this is happening and becoming free. But then you look around,

2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:11.920
 what do you see? That now most of these liberators of their nations become the present of their

2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:19.440
 nations. But remember what I told you, most of them have drunken the social socialist,

2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:26.800
 Marxist socialism Kool Aid. So as these African nations become independent with their first

2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:33.600
 independent governments and in, you know, presidents, most of them, most of them are

2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:40.720
 socialists, various forms of status type of government. And this is because at that point,

2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:49.600
 we had made a fatal mistake of going off saying, we are Marxist socialists, because

2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:54.160
 you guys fight for equal rights. So in this case, there should be no colonialism or anything like

2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:00.640
 that. And so not only you have that going on, and the people, so right now you had this battle

2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:05.600
 of ideology going on, because on one hand represented by freedom and the economic, what do

2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:10.400
 you call it, the economic system they were using is capitalism. And these are represented by the

2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:16.720
 Western nations facing off with Eastern bloc, practicing various forms of statism, socialism,

2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:23.760
 communism, various forms of statism. And these two are fighting for influence. So, and we also

2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:29.200
 have, it's also not, so two things there. One is we are the time where, remember the free market

2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:37.920
 concept was almost dead, almost dead. So almost every intellectual at that time was social Marxist.

2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:44.880
 Or Marxist socialists, I put the name, that's what you were. So you in the world where it was

2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:51.120
 the normal thing, it was just mainstream acceptance. So not only you have that force, but at the same

2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:56.560
 time, if these two forces are fighting one another, it turns out that the one representing

2:11:56.560 --> 2:12:04.160
 capitalism and freedom, well, sorry, but isn't it you who enslaved us and colonized us, and you're

2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:11.040
 fighting with the people who represent supposedly people who are saying that who had been fighting

2:12:11.040 --> 2:12:16.480
 for equal rights with us for the longest time, these are our friends. And that's when we made a

2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:23.040
 fatal mistake. Because while, yes, there were maybe good things to agree on with Marxist socialists

2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:29.360
 of the times, especially equal rights for all people and all of that, that's the only thing we

2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:34.560
 should have, among the only things we should have agreed upon. Their violent revolution tendencies,

2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:40.800
 no way. When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way. We should not have thrown the baby out

2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:44.720
 with the bathwater, but that's what we did. And that's when we made a fatal mistake. So then we

2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:51.040
 became free, all of these nations, and most of them started with socialist or communist

2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:59.760
 leaders. My country, socialist. Leopold Siddharth Sengar, he was a socialist. And they stayed in

2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:07.680
 power for 40 years, the first 40 years of our freedom years. And all over the continent,

2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:13.120
 more or less, that's what you had. And on top of that, something else that the French don't know,

2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:20.080
 the people don't know, is France, with its colonies, said, you cannot not do, you have to

2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:30.720
 keep the French civil law. So we're talking about the Napoleonic civil code. Are you kidding me?

2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:39.360
 So that's what happened. So the reason why I go back to BLM is while I have all the respect

2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:45.840
 in the world and all the compassion in the world, for people like Krumah, for people like Nerewe,

2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:52.720
 for people, all of us people of those times, the liberators of Africa, while I have so much love,

2:13:52.720 --> 2:14:01.360
 compassion for them, I am also able to say, because I got the benefit of 60 some years time,

2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:08.160
 and, you know, where you get to do a debrief and see what worked, what didn't work, what happened.

2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:16.800
 And we have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect. So yes, I can understand why they did

2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:23.280
 what they did. I can even, I can understand why they sided with these people who on the surface,

2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:27.280
 or at least some part of a fight, was the same fight as them when it came to equal rights.

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:37.600
 I can excuse them, but I will not excuse the BLM founders,

2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:47.040
 because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago. Today, no. The blacks of today

2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:54.640
 cannot be serious about Black Lives Mattering and saying in the same sentence,

2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:59.280
 and we're going to be socialist Marxists, Marxist socialists. It just doesn't work.

2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:06.160
 So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated with the ideas of Marxism.

2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:15.440
 Yeah, they're anti free market, anti capitalist, and we do know that you have to have free markets

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:23.440
 in order to build prosperity. And prosperity means economic power. If you have economic power,

2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:28.240
 no one messes with you. Or if they're going to do it, they're going to have to think twice.

2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:34.720
 And when they do, they're going to have to pay consequences. So if you want for blacks to be

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:39.040
 respected anywhere in the world, you're going to have to be serious about Black prosperity.

2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:46.000
 All mass, not just a few people, Oprah over here and somebody over there, no. We as a group

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:53.600
 have to be a critical mass of prosperity across the board. And because we're talking

2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:58.960
 critical mass of prosperity across the board, it means black people everywhere in the world.

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:06.000
 But guess what? We in Africa happen to represent 90% of our representatives of a black race.

2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:10.240
 So you're going to be serious about Black Lives Mattering without being serious for

2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:15.520
 Africa, the 1 billion people in Africa that are black, and for them to have access to the free

2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:25.120
 markets and yes, fossil fuels so that they can rocket up prosperity wise.

2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:27.520
 And the resources of the young people, the young minds.

2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:32.240
 Yes, so that all of these young people, young minds can finally manifest their greatness

2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:37.440
 that I know they have and that they're showing us every day despite the obstacles.

2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:44.080
 That's what we need. Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become and will be richer than France.

2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:46.480
 The colonized Singapore did it. We can do it.

2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:56.400
 Mali rich, Nigeria rich functioning as well. Mali Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich,

2:16:56.400 --> 2:17:03.840
 Zimbabwe rich, Niger rich, everywhere rich, prosperous as prosperous if not more prosperous

2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:10.240
 than Switzerland or Singapore or the U.S. I don't know of, or the Liechtenstein or Luxembourg

2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:19.360
 places that have no natural resources. We become rich and you watch the world having

2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:26.240
 a very different relationship with us. That's the only time we will command any type of respect.

2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:33.840
 That's when people, even our common psyche will change even about black people.

2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:41.200
 All of the stereotypes that they have of us is going to melt away and you may still not like us

2:17:42.160 --> 2:17:48.560
 but you will still respect us because we are a force to be dealt with and only economic power

2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:54.320
 does that. It would be nice of course for us to respect people because they're people.

2:17:54.320 --> 2:18:02.240
 It would be nice but let us not kid ourselves. This is earth and someone said nice people

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:05.760
 will make it to heaven but not to Harvard necessarily. It's true.

2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:13.680
 It's interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect. It would be nice if it did.

2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:18.640
 It would be nice but it doesn't. Prosperity is the only thing.

2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:23.200
 Prosperity is the only thing and the way we do that there is no, just like all of us humans

2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:32.480
 have to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. That's a human way of breathing.

2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:38.160
 You bring me on but you want to be foolish and be like, oh well sorry that's how white people

2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:41.520
 breathe so as black people we're going to have to do something different. Well good luck with that.

2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:48.560
 So this is here why I'm saying I have no patience for black lives matter. They're making a mistake

2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:56.080
 that was made 60 some plus years ago. Even more than that maybe even 100 you know when we were

2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:01.120
 siding with the Marxist socialists because they're the ones who've been fighting for equal rights.

2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:11.520
 Let me ask you though about racism. Do you, as you travel through this world, as you travel

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:21.040
 through America, feel the burn of hatred? You've spoken about the revolutions that have been fought

2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:29.200
 throughout the 20th century against racism but today as people talk about educating,

2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:34.320
 reminding the world with even with more philosophical ideas of critical race theory,

2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:42.240
 for example, do you think this is still a battle that needs to be fought at the forefront of culture

2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:54.880
 in the United States? Does racism exist? Yes it does. But all forms of isms exist.

2:19:54.880 --> 2:20:04.080
 Some people it's about various forms of ableism. Others it's about size and racism yes is one of

2:20:04.080 --> 2:20:12.480
 them. Does it exist? Yes it does. But is it what's going to stop anyone from manifesting their greatest

2:20:12.480 --> 2:20:22.480
 potential? I say no. I say no. Many people in this country have showed it. Whether the African

2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:29.920
 Americans or African immigrant, I'm an African immigrant, you have African Americans like Oprah

2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:38.000
 and others and other people even before her who despite the nastiness around them were able to

2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:45.280
 make it. So we do know especially us black people but I think it's humanity as a whole

2:20:45.920 --> 2:20:52.080
 and that's what I love about the human spirit. It's resiliency but resiliency only can happen

2:20:52.080 --> 2:20:58.400
 if you don't allow yourself to be beaten down and to lose yourself of agency.

2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:06.960
 It's of course easier said than done and some among us need a little bit more help

2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:14.720
 to not succumb for it than others do and I've seen it. It might be harder for you if you're

2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:23.520
 somewhere in inner city black America maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher

2:21:24.560 --> 2:21:31.840
 for you to try and get to act together and all of that stuff and it's okay but even in that situation

2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:39.200
 we need to I think it's important that we still do not rob you of your agency

2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:51.440
 and this is where I am mad as heck against those who supposedly care and their idea of how to make

2:21:51.440 --> 2:21:57.280
 sure that I don't become or stay a victim of racism is through all the things we talked about,

2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:07.440
 the CRT, the anti racism crap of you know Abraham X. Kendi and what's her name? Robin D. Angelo.

2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:14.640
 I mean her I'm shocked. The woman is making all of this money supposedly fighting a war on our

2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:20.320
 behalf. I'm like lady I hear you loud and clear that you are a true racist. I know that you told

2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:26.320
 me you are and for you to think that your anti racism makes you less racist and it's that happens

2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:31.920
 too. She comes from a racist background fine she's saying it it's true but this idea that

2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:38.000
 that every walking person on earth belongs to one category of the other depending on what you

2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:44.800
 you know which skin color you came with it's it's problematic at its root so my point is

2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:51.520
 does racism exist? Yes. Do you think it's going to stop me from doing anything I have to do?

2:22:51.520 --> 2:23:01.920
 No. Might it make it harder, longer, maybe but it will not stop me but for it not to stop me

2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:07.680
 I can't engage in victimhood mentality. I can't lose myself or self I got I got to use all the

2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:14.400
 agency that I have to fight back and fight beyond see it says shouldn't you just better fight back

2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:19.760
 you fight back and you fight beyond because at some point yeah and it's this concept of yes and

2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:28.080
 so this is why I have loved the job so when I have somebody who is like oh anti racism is away

2:23:28.640 --> 2:23:32.960
 we're going to go and tell all the white kids that you know because they will happen to be white

2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:37.200
 that they're really the oppressors and blah blah blah and the black kids because they're black you

2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:43.440
 know you're not changing anything when you're doing that nothing except that you're putting

2:23:43.440 --> 2:23:48.880
 problems where there were no problems to start with all we had to do was maybe go for a different

2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:54.480
 route from there kids are kids kids are born kids and this I'm not sure if you want to get me going

2:23:54.480 --> 2:24:01.760
 on to the whole science of bias because that's something I spent years of my life on and my journey

2:24:01.760 --> 2:24:10.800
 on the science of bias started with the days of Philando Castile Eric Garner that whole summer of

2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:20.320
 2016 when we had this horrendous horrendous situation of black people killing being killed by the police

2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:25.760
 where they shot before asking and people left to die in the most inhumane way for the rest of us to

2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:31.920
 watch from the social media that's me that's when my George Floyd moment happened not later

2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:39.680
 four years ago in the whole world is like you know so that sent me on a journey of understanding

2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:45.440
 what discrimination is and bias is um and in a way that's the reason why I started this company

2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:52.400
 that I even called skin is skin that's where it came from again criticized by creating I I I needed

2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:57.440
 to understand what discrimination was how does it work is it true what candy is saying is it true

2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:03.520
 what D. Angelo is saying is it true that that I it could it could be that your back your your

2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:09.920
 race is just because of the skin color you happen to be born in is it true is it true I I needed to

2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:16.080
 know because I was at a time of my life where at some point you know when when those killings were

2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:22.320
 happening it was so hard for me um being a black person in this country and wondering

2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:31.440
 I mean what is this and and what do we do with this

2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:40.080
 um yeah is it true how much discrimination am I operating under in the system all of that you

2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:45.280
 need to understand the full characteristics of if you're if you're dreaming of making a big change

2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:51.760
 by building companies you have to kind of intuit how much what am I up against what am I up against

2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:56.960
 right and so this is why you know spend all of this time on some of the work and then eventually

2:25:56.960 --> 2:26:02.720
 I understood that discrimination if you wanted to understand it beyond um it's um you know beyond

2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:09.040
 the the big lines of especially the the clickbait lines would make it very black and white then I

2:26:09.040 --> 2:26:14.800
 had to really take a moment and I spent time you know with a world of brain scientists with behavioral

2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:22.560
 psychologists with evolutionary biologists we have all of this ecosystem but together form what we

2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:30.160
 one might call the science of bias and especially I came across the work of this team of scientists

2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:35.760
 at the University of I think it's Wisconsin and they're the only ones who made sense

2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:44.480
 in this sea of nonsense back then and this article was in political and it was saying

2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:51.760
 something that I could relate with and eventually what I learned was and this part comes from the

2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:58.800
 evolutionary biologist people they in a way tell you that right around age three can happen sooner

2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:04.720
 or later because you know we're all different but um you go from this person who has to rely on these

2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:11.040
 other people usually your parents to stay alive to be fed to be housed to be even your diaper change

2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:22.160
 all of that stuff right to now something is kicking in where you have to in order for you to survive

2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:28.080
 and this is all wired in so you don't even understand it consciously as I'm saying it now

2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:33.760
 where in order for you to survive for in order for you to go from this state of dependency to another

2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:38.000
 to the next state to the next station more and more and more you're going to have to develop

2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:43.600
 this ability to make sense of the world and what's making sense of the world at this most basic level

2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:53.200
 means is can you determine if a situation or a person is good or bad for you failure and you

2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:59.120
 need to be able to do that do so ever so quickly because failure to do to be able to do that might

2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:06.240
 means that you might not be alive the next second see it's so wired in so this process starting to

2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:14.000
 kick in and at that point your brain is going to be your best ally for that and what the brain is

2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:20.080
 going to do is it's going to help you and the way the brain works is through um it it works with um

2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:27.520
 for if it's all wired for efficiency and the way it um it goes for efficiency is through automation

2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:30.800
 meaning that every time it has computed and you probably know these things way better than me

2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:36.640
 every time it has computed one algorithm it doesn't try it it doesn't want to do it again

2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:41.280
 it's almost like this okay got it stored stored right and then it adds maybe some

2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:45.680
 little of levels of complexity to it but it has to be something new meaning the new level of

2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:50.640
 complexity for it to even be willing to reconsider otherwise you have so then all of a sudden what

2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:57.520
 you have is these neurons in the back of your head and they have created pathways right so and every

2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:03.360
 time um neurons have created pathway among themselves because basically they're attached

2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:09.920
 and here is the pathway well this pathway in the world of um the world of um bias science of bias

2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:15.680
 it's a habit in general it's a habit when they form two pathways when they form a pathway it's a habit

2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:22.720
 so if we're willing to talk about unconscious bias because of course it's very different from somebody

2:29:22.720 --> 2:29:30.000
 who tells me to my face there's no world in which you or I could ever be equal because you're black

2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:36.640
 and I'm white you're a woman I'm a man this this and that that people like that again 100 one person

2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:41.760
 of psychopaths in our world they're out there unfortunately by the time they do nasty things

2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:46.080
 it's pretty horrible and that's what all we hear about but I'm talking mostly about the rest of us

2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:51.200
 remember when I told you that most of us are good people bumbling along making it up as we're going

2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:57.360
 that's why I have compassion for human nature so but really in the morning when I wake up do you

2:29:57.360 --> 2:30:01.360
 really think that I'm waking up and thinking how am I gonna go kill how am I gonna go kill Lex

2:30:01.360 --> 2:30:05.360
 that Lex guy needs to go down he's a man he's a don't take me around I'm sure there's some women

2:30:05.360 --> 2:30:10.080
 who feel like that but I'm not one of them and I do think a majority of us are not whatever but

2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:17.200
 you know in the morning I'm waking up I'm just like gee can I get my tea oh my dog is not looking

2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:25.760
 okay today you know we've got right it's a lot going on and so you're using these kind of just

2:30:25.760 --> 2:30:31.120
 like you said brilliantly the brain has as much as simplifications is built up and it uses those

2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:36.880
 simplifications to get through the day exactly so so then here you are needing to make sense of a

2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:41.280
 world and then the brain is your best ally in that the way it's going to do it is for efficiency

2:30:41.280 --> 2:30:46.720
 efficiency done through automation so every time it thinks it's figured something out it's never

2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:51.200
 going to think about it again so that's how you build all of these habits of unconscious bias

2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:58.400
 because everything so it's somewhere along the line you come up with the with the information

2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:02.800
 that black man walking around with a hoodie equals danger so later what do you see

2:31:04.800 --> 2:31:09.040
 whether it's like so my god I'm walking in the dark alley I see a black man with a hoodie

2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:13.920
 maybe I'm going to run away because I've been given that information so the best way to think

2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:21.680
 about it is the brain is a hardware and and the software it runs on is um what do you call it

2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:27.680
 is a cultural imprint all of this information that we're getting from the Disney movies that you're

2:31:27.680 --> 2:31:32.000
 reading telling you that damn cells are to be saved by the prints and all that stuff and girls

2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.720
 were pink and all whatever um you know you watch the movies and all the movies whenever you watch

2:31:36.720 --> 2:31:40.160
 images about Africa they're talking to about the blood diamonds or they're talking to you about

2:31:40.160 --> 2:31:43.680
 slavery or they're talking to about this and then of wonder you walk away thinking that all the ills

2:31:43.680 --> 2:31:48.720
 of Africa are caused because of resource extraction of the diamonds or they're always fighting each

2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:55.280
 other look at the amin and the movie you know or you know slavery all the time you walk away and this

2:31:55.280 --> 2:32:00.880
 is it and we're all programmed along the same lines see that's the beauty of it all of us are

2:32:00.880 --> 2:32:05.440
 because even some black people who are going to claim that they didn't business up when they registered

2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:10.320
 really so the truth so then when I learned a little bit something like wow this concept of if

2:32:10.320 --> 2:32:18.080
 you've got a brain you've got biases it comes with a territory that makes sense now it doesn't mean

2:32:18.080 --> 2:32:24.880
 we can't we can't transcend that function of a brain and that we should transcend it right but I

2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:30.080
 think it's very important because once you understand that a little bit more peace is created among us

2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:35.680
 because this is not about a black and white or a yellow or green issue it's about we are human

2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:43.200
 issue and these are part of things we develop to you know to to to keep to stay around just like

2:32:43.200 --> 2:32:51.360
 we no longer have to rely on you know this fear of flight you know like ability of a brain because

2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:56.240
 bears over there start running and running fast right today where are the bears show me where they

2:32:56.240 --> 2:33:03.360
 are but we have kept this tendency to go for fear of fear of flight I don't know how they say it

2:33:03.360 --> 2:33:09.120
 and so we have this you know court is done by the stress you know stress triggers that back in the

2:33:09.120 --> 2:33:15.840
 days we have a stress trigger we run and it's all you know expelled out but today we get triggers

2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:21.040
 and we don't know what to do with it because where would we run to what do we do the bear is not even

2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:27.120
 here so same thing here with that and so when you realize this whole thing that is now we what you

2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:33.840
 understand is that this problem is not about anti racism BS but it is about can each one of us

2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:41.360
 do the work where the work is needed which is we look inside can we go for this work of deprogrammation

2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:52.000
 this concept of a mindful practice of undoing the habit of bias and that doesn't necessarily have to

2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:57.760
 do with a simple categorization of black and white it's all kinds of about everything it's about

2:33:57.760 --> 2:34:02.880
 everything and you know when I started on that journey and in my friend back then built you

2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:09.680
 know this practice of undoing your habit of unconscious bias we had all types of people come

2:34:10.720 --> 2:34:17.920
 and say wow I discovered that my bias against larger people and I'm like what what do you mean

2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:25.120
 well um I think I it seems to me like I felt that larger people maybe are are dumb no we heard

2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:32.240
 things and you know and you don't judge yeah you don't judge and so and you see it's at every level

2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:36.480
 you know like I don't know like there's even this one friend she was like you know when I

2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:40.400
 looked into the whole dating thing I absolutely didn't want to have um you know date the Asian men

2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:46.320
 because she went her mind was into some stereotypes about the size of whatever and she was like no

2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:52.400
 no but you see you once you start because there's this whole thing of um it's the five step thing

2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:59.840
 bias awareness this uh understood basically at this level what you're doing is you're learning

2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:04.320
 to spot the biases in our culture because that's where the cultural imprint comes from

2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:08.240
 you're watching this movie and you're realizing just like I said wow gee I realized once again

2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:15.200
 the black person is portrayed like uh like the fog of a movie um or you know um the Latina lady

2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.840
 this is how she's been portrayed and you see it everywhere even the NPR NPR is happening

2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:24.480
 like you're listening to something like NPR you gotta be more liberal than that and this gentleman

2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:28.320
 is asking these two candidates one of them is a woman political candidates if the other one is a

2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:32.640
 man I'm hearing us I'm asking the lady a question that I know he's not gonna ask the man and he

2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:39.280
 didn't ask her he said how do you um how do you balance um you know your race with a family

2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:47.120
 yeah does a man not have a family right there you see it's very subtle yeah but you see

2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:52.240
 but because now my mind is kind of trained to see things I'm like interesting or like when the media

2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:59.920
 just says froze um climate change issue on something without even the choice of words

2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:05.360
 so it's pretty much everywhere you open the book everywhere the interesting thing though uh I mean

2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:12.880
 even that man uh woman example is I think it's really um powerful to bring that bias to the

2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:19.920
 surface but not let that lead to kind of a fear and paralysis that's right you should almost I mean

2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:25.360
 that's where humor is make fun of it bring it to the surface like acknowledge the fact that those

2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:32.080
 things are a part of the conversation and a lot of them are it is you know it's a cultural imprint

2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:35.840
 because it's part of culture and that might be there could be you know I grew up in the in the

2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:40.720
 Soviet Union where the gender roles were stronger than in other places that's right and that's part

2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:45.840
 of the culture we have to acknowledge exactly that this is how this is affecting how I think you

2:36:45.840 --> 2:36:50.880
 might exactly we might like how that works when we might not but we have to acknowledge it and

2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:55.440
 not get you know make it part of humor make fun of yourself you know all that kind of stuff that

2:36:55.440 --> 2:37:00.800
 that's the thing and so legs that's why this first step is bias um bias awareness so you get

2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:05.920
 you train yourself oh yeah okay that was one or it's you know and it's about it's in you it's we're

2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:12.400
 talking about you we're not and then from there you're like um replace the bias like bias replacement

2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:19.600
 then it is um where you practice the empathy you're like gee wow I wonder how I would feel

2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:23.440
 every day I walk into a store and the guy thinks he should be following me because maybe I can

2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:27.600
 I might steal something because I'm black right because when once you try that to put yourself

2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.240
 in the other person's shoes all of a sudden something else starts to click and then from there

2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:39.600
 you go on to making connection then you're making your connection and then things start to change

2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:45.840
 because now you um no you're making um then you make cultural immersion so this is where we had

2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:52.960
 some people like this one woman she was very um uh quite uh very feminist oriented and um she had

2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:58.640
 um issue with women wearing their the hijab and because for her it was like how come you how come

2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:05.520
 how come you you you you just slow it you know like how come you're accepting this uh demeaning

2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:11.360
 of yourself not understanding everything else that comes with it but through as she understood

2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:16.160
 that she even had that bias then she went on through all the different processes and then

2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:21.680
 eventually when comes the next step cultural immersion she started going uh to the mosque

2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:26.480
 during uh Ramadan when the Muslims are doing you know they're uh it's the holy month of um you know

2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:32.240
 fasting and then we break uh at night and she started understanding very different things

2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:37.920
 and eventually happens the last step that happened naturally making a true real genuine

2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:43.200
 connection and this is where friendships happen this is where that's it you guys can go home now

2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:50.640
 because it has been challenged with reality and understanding and so for me that is what I was after

2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:55.120
 and then but then the world was just like we don't want to be told we're part of a problem

2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:00.080
 so but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness type of practice that's going to

2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:06.480
 need to happen and it's one that's very internal to to to you it is it is not and it happens

2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:14.320
 everybody at their own pace so all of this I take it back to um to the racism the question

2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:19.840
 you were asking me does racism exist yes it does is it going to stop me from doing anything I want

2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:27.760
 to do no it's going to make it harder me but this is where for anybody who is serious about

2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:36.480
 making sure uh about fighting racism I think the only job you have to do is to

2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:45.440
 make sure that people keep their sense of self agency and be can you help provide people with

2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:53.440
 the tools to stand up so this is why I have so much respect for vengeance people like vengeance

2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:01.200
 although I disagree with him on so many things but people like Miss Alice Johnson she was pardoned

2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:08.000
 by President Trump through the work of people like vengeance and Kim Kardashian and others

2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:13.600
 they all joined forces this is a case where people of and and those folks then went on to

2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:21.920
 combine forces furthermore no no no regard given to their political belongings they said

2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:29.360
 if the issue is criminal criminal justice reform then anybody who stands for it has to come together

2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:35.920
 and so what they did in this situation with with what they're doing criminal justice reform in my

2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:45.200
 mind is a valid action to fight racism in my mind because what are you doing there you're

2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:50.720
 trying to get people out of jail who really have no business being there and also when you have

2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:56.480
 people like Bishop Omar and the people he passed away unfortunately but today we have Anton lucky

2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:04.720
 Anton lucky who was in jail for having killed his cousin you know he had started I think he

2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:10.800
 started the the the the gang in South Dallas so we're talking really tough guy who was written

2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:17.200
 the wrong side of the of the equation and then in in jail literally he found Plato the cave and all

2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:23.280
 of that so today these people I'm like why don't we hear more about them the urban specialists

2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:29.200
 because these people it's not about the anti racism crap of Candio DiAngelo I'll say it again

2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:36.080
 until the cows come home but it is about we go where help is needed we go in we go in in urban

2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:42.320
 you know inner city inner city black inner city neighborhoods and block by block we change the

2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:47.760
 culture and they say it like that it's their words these are African American people who have as many

2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:52.960
 rights as anybody else to talk about their own culture and they will tell you we have to change

2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:58.240
 the culture I have some some videos like that on my youtube with Bishop Omar what these people are

2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:05.040
 doing is what we need to do Bishop will explain it says sometimes people are the the feet and feet

2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:12.800
 deep down in the mud and what we have to do is to try to pull them up and you cannot say you

2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:16.960
 didn't pull them up because we're not seeing the head out yet but how much how much progress have

2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:23.520
 been made from the bottom to where they are now and keep going so what I see these people doing

2:42:23.520 --> 2:42:30.080
 you see I have so much I love and respect Glen Larry and Company you know and Ian Rove and all

2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:36.800
 of those guys I love them I love a lot of the things that they say you know this whole concept

2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:41.440
 of personal response we don't know that but I'm just like at some point it also needs to be matched

2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:49.200
 up with real actions and that's what the people like Anton Lucky urban specialists Alice Johnson

2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:53.040
 are doing they're going where it's hard Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail every

2:42:53.040 --> 2:42:58.720
 single day literally and then people like Anton Lucky and his team are giving them the tools to

2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:06.480
 live the gang life to to be better people to go for a life of redemption this is happening right

2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:12.000
 now but what I find is they're not getting the bulk of the attention but this is anybody who's

2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:20.800
 serious about this is why how I would love to see people do anti racism is help lift people up for

2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:29.760
 real action support support um a school choice support school choice black mamas are they know

2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:33.920
 what's going on and when they tell you we want school choice they know what to talk about they're

2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:41.600
 not idiots especially at the local level yes helping at the local level yes so help them make sure

2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:47.520
 that they can take their kids out of these public schools that are doing horrendous things to them

2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:55.440
 you know miss virginia watch that movie how could you not support black moms in this country to take

2:43:55.440 --> 2:44:01.040
 the kids to safety when it comes to education how come not that's what I want to see happen and not

2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:07.120
 like some yeah let's go to some classrooms and everybody's white you go over here everybody's

2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:13.920
 the next thing you go over here and kids let us tell you about this no no no no as a black person

2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:21.360
 I don't want you to do any of that crap let me grow my wings yeah if you want help put some fuel

2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:26.400
 behind them and let me take my flight that's all I'm asking for that's the only way for you to do

2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:31.200
 um a for that's the only way for you to be part of a racism battle if that's what you think is the

2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:36.080
 most important battle of our life that's it that's what I have to say about that and so for me I'm

2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:46.720
 keeping my head very straight it's about what uh enables black people to thrive I don't need for you

2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:51.840
 to be an activist on my behalf no because when you're doing that you're doing exactly what you've

2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:56.960
 been doing to us black people in Africa our whole life I don't need you white savior complex because

2:44:56.960 --> 2:45:01.680
 that's what anti racism is white savior complex that stuff doesn't work it's only works to make

2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:07.840
 you feel better about how superior to me but it does nothing absolutely nothing to change my everyday

2:45:07.840 --> 2:45:14.880
 life if it is not if it is at least in the African side to actually even change my um you know turn

2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:21.200
 me into somebody who's waiting for handouts so if I would encourage people to really those people

2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:26.320
 who are really serious about wanting to be part of a solution and I know there are many out there

2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:32.800
 for the love of god and everything that's out there and they care about stop it's it's about

2:45:32.800 --> 2:45:41.440
 think about what's gonna um enable people maybe the word is wrongly chosen but you know what I'm

2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:47.760
 talking about give them freedom to spread their wings yes give a person um yeah to learn to teach

2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:52.400
 a person how to fish and don't give them a fish when you're putting your stupid signs on a lawn

2:45:52.400 --> 2:45:57.120
 um with black lives matter and all that crap you're not helping and when you're buying one more

2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:04.400
 anti racism book or or as a company you know financing one more di you know um if it done

2:46:04.400 --> 2:46:10.320
 along those lines I think we've got a problem yeah so you do think that the the efforts of

2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:17.360
 diversity equity and inclusion are often not effective not only are they not effective but

2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:24.080
 they're also backfire and there are reports on all of us and at the end of the day it makes sense

2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:33.200
 it makes sense so for me I am very very glad that people um have developed an enlightenment

2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:42.800
 about this very happy about that very but let us not keep going for the easy perceived solution

2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:50.000
 to problems again they've done this to us the poor people of Africa they thought the solution

2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:58.320
 was to give it does not work and then they say oh we're gonna do a social social um social

2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:02.240
 entrepreneurship on you tom shoes buy one pair of shoes and we give one pair of shoes to some

2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:08.160
 people in uh in poor countries then guess what happened to us you know in the town where we

2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:14.400
 operate in Senegal where I have my little manufacturing two we have two thousand little mom

2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:23.040
 and pop businesses and guess what they happen to be in lex shoemakers right so every shoemaker

2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:31.120
 each one of them hires at least five fifteen people do the math family businesses guess what

2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:40.320
 happens to them the day the tom shoes truck shows up with bunch of free shoes yeah who can who can

2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:44.800
 who can compete against free now all of these people little by little gonna have to close their

2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:48.720
 shops because who can compete against free because tom shoes dumping all of these shoes on them

2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:54.800
 and then they go out of business and now instead of helping anybody you actually sent all the kids

2:47:54.800 --> 2:48:00.400
 who depended on these adults working in these places now they have to join the rank of kids who

2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:08.400
 need to be given shoes because you took their parents ability to make money through their wages

2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:16.320
 buy them shoes you see so first they said we just have to give so that was um primarily um

2:48:16.880 --> 2:48:22.960
 you know the charity business and um you still have foreign aid business going on so we just

2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:28.480
 need to give and then the social entrepreneurs came in place but I'm like the only person for

2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:32.960
 this is business is good is for Blake McCarthy you know the founder of tom shoes but other

2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:38.560
 than that I'm not sure really seeing who else is winning from this and then they and so today

2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:48.480
 my whole thing is we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor or to have a mind for the lesser

2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:54.480
 fortunate maybe in this country it is easy and lesser fortunate because you know for anybody

2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:59.280
 that you see you you feel like is being trampled upon because of something maybe it's because of

2:48:59.280 --> 2:49:06.800
 economic circumstances or maybe it's race in this case or whatever to have a heart for the

2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:14.640
 lesser fortunate among us for whatever reason that's easy but to have a mind for them that's a

2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:21.360
 challenge let me ask you a difficult question yeah as if we were not already asking difficult

2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:29.360
 questions uh the president of senegal uh Maggie saw is also now the chair of the african union

2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:38.640
 he met with the president of latimer putin on june 3rd i think primarily was to discuss food

2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:47.840
 security africa seems to be split halfway on their perspective in the war in ukraine so broadly

2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:56.560
 speaking what do you think about this first of all the geopolitics of africa and the geopolitical

2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:04.400
 relationship of africa with the rest of the world and this current conflict with the war in ukraine

2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:10.480
 what are your thoughts there well you've seen that many countries when it was time to vote

2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:17.680
 some of them abstained you know which in a way says something i think for the africans today

2:50:17.680 --> 2:50:21.840
 especially as represented by the african union because not all countries fall in this along

2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:28.880
 the same lines i feel like again we're back to we're back for the longest time the west tries

2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:38.560
 to tell us what to do they decide for us and here they are there's trouble meaning there's

2:50:38.560 --> 2:50:46.480
 definitely a ref major one between most of the western world as represented by you know europe

2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:53.600
 and america primarily and have australian and all that and then them they're saying you know

2:50:54.800 --> 2:50:57.040
 i think this is more or less an attempt to

2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:07.600
 to stand on their own as well it's like you're not don't tell us what to do as usual you always

2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:12.240
 rope us in with when it makes sense for you you try to rope us in and then we're left hanging on our

2:51:12.240 --> 2:51:18.400
 own so there's a this goes back to the sentiment you were talking about earlier it's been challenging

2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:27.440
 for me to watch this because remember i have one foot also you know like because there's what i get

2:51:27.440 --> 2:51:34.320
 to see and hear from being in the western world but there's also what i get to see and hear from

2:51:34.320 --> 2:51:43.040
 when i'm in the back home so i wear all hats and i think this is a situation where the african

2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:52.640
 union and african nations in general are saying we don't it's this is the case where one was like

2:51:52.640 --> 2:51:58.800
 you guys are fighting you guys are fighting maybe for once we have to watch it for ourselves

2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:06.720
 yeah there's a sense in which um this is the embodiment sort of you know abstaining from

2:52:06.720 --> 2:52:13.760
 a vote on the war in ukraine is a political embodiment of a resistance to the influence of

2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:18.880
 the west right it's not about the war between whatever you guys are fighting yes it's saying

2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:27.120
 we're not going to let this particular empire that seems to be at the top right now which is

2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:36.400
 the united states empire in europe to dominate our political discourse our geopolitical considerations

2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:42.000
 it's almost like no we're not touching this yeah especially that given usually so when they need us

2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:48.320
 again for influence which means more power oh you guys vote the same way we do and when the

2:52:48.320 --> 2:52:53.920
 it's all over and they go back to they go back to us spreading you know they go back to um how do

2:52:53.920 --> 2:53:00.640
 you say that they go back to um uh exchanging and sharing between themselves the goodies of uh you

2:53:00.640 --> 2:53:06.560
 know their halloween collection we're no longer we're not there when the goodies are being shared

2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:15.120
 so i think it's it's definitely one of those situations but for me it still is hard because

2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:24.160
 i watch everything that's going on and um i it's it's going to be complicated for ramifications of

2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:30.320
 all of this i would like to to see our african leaders also what they're doing is is clear

2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:40.880
 but this is a place where i almost i'm also tempted to say yes and um yes to the reasons

2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:47.280
 you're advancing right now you know of we don't want to be always siding because we're tired we're

2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:53.280
 tired of always being dragged around and taken for granted and you vote our way you know um come on

2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:58.160
 guys uh when when you need us we're we're great and everything is good and then when it's time to go

2:53:58.160 --> 2:54:04.480
 and share the goodies we don't exist anymore and you actually go for um policies that go against us

2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:11.360
 but in this situation though i would like to still see us do the right thing in my case i was not very

2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:21.760
 happy to see um us going and more or less begging for you know um what do you call it um cereals

2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:27.840
 you know oh please let the cereals um make it so at least we get them and we don't starve

2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:35.120
 i can understand why a president would say something like that or try to negotiate something like that

2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:43.920
 but when it comes to an african president having to do that with a non african president

2:54:44.640 --> 2:54:49.360
 i'm sorry but for me it's too close to begging listen it's hard to be a leader it's such a

2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:59.440
 difficult dance because in some sense sort of the the flip side of that is you're creating a market

2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:06.080
 a geopolitical market of saying we're willing to sit down at the table with america with european

2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:15.440
 leaders with uh russian leaders with china and we're gonna let you guys convince us who we should

2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:24.240
 collaborate with and that's what sort of great um nations and groups of nations do do now there's

2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:31.040
 a cynical of course a dark perspective with that because what's in in that game played by leaders

2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:37.520
 and the people that hurt people of ukraine hurt people of africa can hurt people of russia people

2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:44.800
 of russia can hurt people of china people in united states but it is the way of the world

2:55:44.800 --> 2:55:51.280
 and to to earn you have to you have to earn respect and sometimes earning respect leads

2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:58.240
 to the suffering of many well but except in this case yes to all of that and the reason why i'm

2:55:58.240 --> 2:56:04.240
 actually upset with with going and being like oh can you let at least the boats uh that are supposed

2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:09.920
 to come to africa full of cereals come over the wheat and all that it's just like look africa has

2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:17.280
 the highest land that you can do agriculture on yes you know we have a larger surface such surface

2:56:17.280 --> 2:56:23.680
 in the world why is this not a time for us to try to win ourselves off of cereals that we

2:56:23.680 --> 2:56:32.240
 don't necessarily have on the ground but no let us go and plead don't beg create instead create

2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:36.480
 instead exactly this should have been you know just like how the rest of the world

2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:41.200
 when uh covid happened and china had to close off for different reasons and since then has not

2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:46.320
 you know completely reopened and people have started to realize wow we've got um we've got

2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:52.000
 too much we're too dependent on china for a lot of what we need so we're gonna have to bring back

2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:57.360
 some production to the us the europeans are doing the same all of that this should have been enough

2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:05.200
 a time for african leaders to be like we need to be serious now uh about um you know food security

2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:11.840
 and maybe the stuff that maybe don't grow under our climate necessarily can we work on coming up

2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:16.800
 with different things now i understand that it can take time but um if i knew that that was happening

2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:20.960
 at the same time that we're saying oh well let the cereals come in maybe i would be a little

2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:25.440
 bit easier with it but right now i'm just like is it going to be the same business as usual

2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:29.200
 and in this case i i'm just like are we going to go are we going to keep going from one massa

2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:36.480
 to another massa i mean really the interesting aspect of all of this is if we look at all of human

2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:43.600
 history it's possible that the 21st century is defined by africa it will be and the young people

2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:48.400
 the huge number of young people it's like the trajectory could be there's so much possibility

2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:54.960
 to define the future of human civilization in africa and i don't mean sort of in the next 10

2:57:54.960 --> 2:58:03.120
 years i mean in the next 50 years what uh so some people concerned about overpopulation

2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:11.520
 some people concerned about us dying out as a human species uh both of those people live in us

2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:19.920
 talk to me often about i know i know i know i know uh i i know who they are but uh what's your

2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:27.200
 in africa is is at the center of this because there is a vibrant huge number probably over a

2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:35.200
 billion uh yeah we're 1.3 billion people in of those 1 billion um blacks i mean that where do you

2:58:35.200 --> 2:58:44.800
 land on that there is a reason like why i say i'm haunted that i'm obsessed that i'm monoma

2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:50.640
 nyako when it comes to the free markets and that i have such a strong sense of urgency to the point

2:58:50.640 --> 2:58:57.520
 that literally it is affecting me and it has to do with the fact that yes you have the youngest

2:58:57.520 --> 2:59:02.960
 region on the earth in terms of the age of its population and the growth and the rate at it at

2:59:02.960 --> 2:59:11.520
 which it's growing demographic wise i am not willing to stay there and say it's a curse for humanity

2:59:11.520 --> 2:59:18.800
 but it will be a curse for humanity if we don't make sure that these people

2:59:20.400 --> 2:59:30.320
 our youth gets to partake and what it takes to partake is not much so if the rest of the world

2:59:30.320 --> 2:59:36.000
 thinks that get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid you have to have more

2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:43.040
 um charity businesses send i mean charity organizations sending stuff away um of course

2:59:43.840 --> 2:59:49.280
 you're almost thinking parasites i'm sorry to say this way if this is what you're thinking

2:59:49.920 --> 2:59:56.320
 you're seeing us as no more than parasites and if that's what it's going to be i could see why

2:59:56.320 --> 3:00:04.720
 some people might be worried about that although humans should never be seen as parasites no matter

3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:15.040
 no matter no matter but some people will go there now people are here what are we going to do dispose

3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:21.920
 of them that's not an option so the only option we have left is to make sure that people partake

3:00:21.920 --> 3:00:29.600
 and what partaking means is that the people get included in them and are part of the systems that

3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:36.960
 allow for human flourishing and it doesn't it's not much in this case it's about can we be serious

3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:45.040
 about the reforms so we have free market zones areas where people where the flourishing can start

3:00:45.040 --> 3:00:54.080
 can start to take place the wealth that people will need to flourish they don't need you to give it

3:00:54.080 --> 3:01:01.200
 to them but it's all about can i let you fly and you will make it happen for you and also for me

3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:08.320
 every young african i see today i realize how stupid the rest of the world is if they're not

3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:13.360
 supporting what i'm trying to talk about because even if you don't want to do it because that's

3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:19.120
 the right thing to do which i think it is the right thing to do you're selfish maybe engage

3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:25.040
 your selfishness because this person right there remember i told you seven billion geniuses everybody

3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:32.080
 is came to this world with a piece of solution to the human problem this person and that person

3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:38.800
 and that person holds something for me because i'm part of humanity this person might have the cure

3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:45.440
 to a cancer that might take my wife out the wife i haven't met yet but this kid right here

3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:52.880
 here has it inside and if i help this if i make sure that this kid gets a chance to flourish

3:01:52.880 --> 3:02:00.000
 and to manifest his genius or her genius that trickle down many years later comes straight

3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:05.440
 back to serve me and the love of my life if we can't see it any other way maybe let's try to

3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:11.200
 think about it that way because it becomes a very good proposition at that point so in this case

3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:19.600
 by 2050 lego's nigeria will be the largest city in the world the future is african whether we want

3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:26.320
 it or not but is it going to be an african future where you have the youth being a ticking bomb

3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:34.720
 because they have not you know there's no hope they stay in poverty because they belong to nations

3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:38.960
 that don't even understand sometimes the importance of common law versus civil law

3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:45.360
 because they're trapped in countries that don't understand that you know you need to

3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:50.080
 you need to um make the legal framework to provide for better economic freedom so you

3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:56.960
 can unleash the the genuineness the awesomeness the ingenuity the industries the industrious side

3:02:56.960 --> 3:03:02.560
 of your young people especially of your women so that they build all the wealth that your nation

3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:07.840
 is going to need you to build and with it the respect that comes from that see we have a

3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:13.680
 choice to make and this is why i feel so so so restless about this at this point of my life

3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:20.000
 we just lost george hayite george hayite is one of the few africans that i knew who

3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:29.360
 who put this out that's who i learned from he's gone and i feel a strong sense of urgency

3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:37.040
 to not only bring back to the table that which he has been working on but to also make sure that

3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:44.480
 he gets seen that's why being here talking with you today it's it's you have no idea it's

3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:50.800
 people ask what if someone like you could say what can i do you did or you did more than you

3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:55.920
 could ever ever imagine by just allowing me to take this message to one more person

3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:03.280
 and because if we do this the change is going to happen somewhere down the line so

3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:08.880
 the ripple effects of all of that on the unlocking the human potential it's unbelievable all those

3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:15.200
 people in africa building cool stuff amazing things yes yes yes so some are going to be built

3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:19.280
 stuff others are going to work on the reforms so we're working on reforms by the way i'm

3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:24.880
 i'm the head of the africa center for prosperity of the atlas network the largest organization in

3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:29.440
 the world working on taking down barriers of entry for entrepreneurs around the world in

3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:35.920
 their respective countries so we're doing great work there are i i basically you know all the i

3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:41.040
 obviously all the think tanks we have in in in africa right now free market think tanks

3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:46.480
 and we want to promote more of them to come up and these are local solutions by local people

3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:53.280
 for their local problems always that's where we draw the line and so um there so we're working on

3:04:53.280 --> 3:04:59.120
 reforms primarily and making people understand the free markets and the importance of it um

3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:07.280
 but it is piecemeal legislation it takes time it is hard by the time you accomplish something here

3:05:07.840 --> 3:05:12.000
 more crap has happened over here more laws have been pounded up because you know how they fix a

3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.640
 bad law most of the time whether it's in the u.s somewhere else put other laws to kind of undo the

3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:21.440
 law from before but it keeps stacking up and before you know it where you should have one thing

3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:26.160
 and it's clear you have a hundred and they go against each other and then it's all it's worse

3:05:26.160 --> 3:05:30.400
 so we have piecemeal legislation but happening you know our teams are doing really amazing

3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:35.760
 fantastic work especially the team in you know imani in gana we have a group in in barundi the

3:05:35.760 --> 3:05:42.000
 great and the great lakes i mean people are doing amazing work amazing work but we need to run faster

3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:48.560
 so while we keep we help run running faster we also have to unlock other things and right now

3:05:48.560 --> 3:05:56.080
 i'm working on one of my most craziest projects something bold radical crazy for some people

3:05:57.040 --> 3:06:02.480
 but i know we're not crazy because before our singapore has done it you know uh hong kong has

3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:09.760
 done it latest the most recent china with the sz's the smell the special economic zones um some of

3:06:09.760 --> 3:06:16.320
 the most radical free market zones in the world they've done it and oftentimes within a generation

3:06:16.320 --> 3:06:23.600
 meaningful change starts to happen right so um here what i'm working on is this concept of

3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:33.200
 some call it um charter cities paul romer others call it um the um free cities and i like to call

3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:40.400
 it startup cities what these are is for us to think about okay if piecemeal legislation takes forever

3:06:40.400 --> 3:06:47.200
 at the same while we have this demographic that's growing faster and faster in africa there is a

3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:53.120
 discrepancy here between the the process of the progress we're making to set the right environment

3:06:53.120 --> 3:07:01.440
 for business to prop up and how many more people are coming to life literally every day on the

3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:07.840
 continent there's a discrepancy here and so the ticking bomb is going faster than the the process

3:07:07.840 --> 3:07:13.040
 we the progress we can make this is a problem so what some of us are working on is this concept of

3:07:13.040 --> 3:07:19.760
 a startup cities and to say piecemeal legislation takes too long how about we continue doing that

3:07:19.760 --> 3:07:25.120
 work which is essential and critical but at the same time can we think of zones and i like to

3:07:25.120 --> 3:07:34.400
 call them also common law zones where we basically try to have within the country an area where for

3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:38.320
 business i'm not talking about family law or any of that stuff no one is touching your culture or

3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:44.960
 anything like that but we're just saying business wise an enclave where you have the best practices

3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:50.720
 from around the world including yours in terms of what constitutes a great business environment

3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:58.800
 and allow people in that it's uh it's you know you get in freely or nobody's forcing you to go

3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:04.720
 nobody's forcing you to whatever so in these so basically you're you're to think about this

3:08:04.720 --> 3:08:14.160
 rather unoccupied plot of land within a country think dubai on 110 acres of land dubai is thinking

3:08:14.160 --> 3:08:19.360
 that uh in their case they're like maybe they decided maybe she realized that the best for

3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:23.920
 business in their case and they said they looked around and were like wow but common law especially

3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:29.280
 british common law seems like a very good one so at that point they decided for business only

3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:33.440
 not family or anything like that which is going to stand there you know sharia or whatever

3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:39.840
 and so they said we are going to bring in um you know uh so they hired a retired british

3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:45.200
 common law judges to educate the law and trained the people under there and i'm over simplifying

3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:53.920
 but at the end of the day in uh within a generation dubai became one of the top international financial

3:08:53.920 --> 3:09:01.520
 centers of the world it is what it is today um so in the case of the african nations that that zone

3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:07.120
 can then spread yes it can not only spread but maybe let's say senegal is senegal was to go for

3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:12.480
 this here you have this one and then over there you have another zone and then what they start to do

3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:17.680
 is they're not all modeled the same way because maybe this one is saying hey we want to attract more

3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:23.280
 i don't know maybe we want to attract more um um medical research right this one's gonna be saying

3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:28.080
 maybe we want to attract more um crypto or maybe it's going to be more like us we want to be more

3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:32.640
 about religious this or whatever you know what i mean so we wanted to fit more of this of that

3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:41.200
 and just kind of give the basics the grounds and then watch the magic happen on it right and so

3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:46.960
 this is what we're working on and the hope there because some people are like you know i know some

3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:52.800
 people are like you guys are crazy but hey i'm like no it it's just it's more or less the story of um

3:09:52.800 --> 3:10:00.480
 you know um the asian tigers and um most recently most of uh china's progress economically speaking

3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:06.800
 because some people might say well you don't want to china we're developing you see even then i say

3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:15.280
 and it's okay we you can always do better but we cannot deny the what the magic that they have

3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:19.680
 accomplished what they have accomplished is nothing short but a miracle 800 million people

3:10:19.680 --> 3:10:26.240
 getting out of poverty yeah exactly so it's not yeah for the the quality of life and the majority

3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:30.880
 of the chinese population yes does something like that happen without problems of course not

3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:36.640
 and so the next person to do something just actually gets to learn from lessons from lessons

3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:42.160
 that's all and leapfrog and leapfrog and leapfrog exactly so for me this is a promise and people

3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:46.640
 are like oh but you guys are crazy but i'm like just like with everything do you know how many

3:10:46.640 --> 3:10:51.680
 attempts it took before the first flight you know the right brothers took off do you know how many

3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:58.000
 and that's important you you try you crash you try you crash but each time you're going higher

3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:05.040
 up higher and you want to get up for once then you stay up longer and before you know it you're

3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:12.960
 doing all types of things so here's the same thing i tell people listen all i need is one success story

3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:22.000
 and then the sea change people don't even wait for us yeah everybody but this is hard

3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:28.320
 because it's the first time so but the good news is there are many groups working on the continent

3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:34.000
 there are some some groups in zambia there's a zone there folks are doing something like this in

3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:39.360
 nigeria where we're part of a project there in nigeria um the one that i'm most excited about

3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:45.280
 i cannot disclose the name of the country yet but my god i'm so excited by it and i just know

3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:50.000
 i just know lex it's going to happen in our lifetime i hope so it's a really powerful vision

3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:56.080
 and uh you know it's not being dramatic to say that the future of humanity uh depends on this

3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:03.280
 that your success that success in africa it's such an important continent it is century it's

3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:09.120
 the continent where everything started and i think it's the continent where we have that continent

3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:16.960
 has to finally finally finally thrive we cannot all of us call ourselves um an enlightened society

3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:22.800
 as a whole when you have such when you have this it's a humongous continent have you seen the size

3:12:22.800 --> 3:12:31.200
 of it you know yeah it's it's it's hard to fathom actually yeah forget exactly and it has such

3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:36.400
 ingenious people you know sometimes i look at my people i have to tell you

3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:44.800
 i'm so proud of him and the young people especially and you know he would look at them

3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:49.840
 and you know somebody said sometimes one day and it was so true they said you know we've seen

3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:57.840
 poverty other places but here it is just maybe somebody doesn't have money but they have dignity

3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:04.560
 and it's true yeah so everything else we can handle and we will handle you have to mark my word

3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:12.640
 for this this is gonna happen and um our youth is amazing you should see them so full of creativity

3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:15.920
 and it doesn't matter you know you were telling me what makes you different many things makes us all

3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:22.240
 different you know the rondons are very different from um the west africans that we are um rondons

3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:27.120
 for example never dance with their hips they dance more like you know with with this part of the body

3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:33.920
 um west africans hips us it's hips all over place all the time and it's you know more jumping stuff

3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:37.840
 like that in ronda you feel it's more like uh you know i mean they remind me more of bell you

3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:43.760
 know the ballet thing um rondons have a sense where you know they don't eat in uh you know

3:13:43.760 --> 3:13:49.360
 most so much in public it's not very well it's something you do um us we are the west africans

3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:54.640
 we like to be loud we're almost like the italiens of the continent and then the rondons are more

3:13:54.640 --> 3:13:59.840
 like you know the swiss of the active country even looks like switzerland i mean we're so different

3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:03.360
 from one group to another then you go to the congo and you see these guys they're so crazy

3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:10.160
 we have a dress i mean les sapeurs so we are a very different bunch um but you know what i love

3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:20.640
 about us what i love about my people we are the we are we we are the manifestation of what resiliency

3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:29.840
 means and um so everything we need is there everything we need is there i will say that

3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:37.680
 there is nothing wrong with the seed everything that's wrong with us is that pot that we put

3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:45.680
 around us so we're tired of being bonsai people we need to be the tallest trees in the forest

3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:50.800
 that we were designed to be and so and that can be fixed and that can be fixed and that's the beauty

3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:58.320
 of it and that's why i am so i'm almost dizzy with i get dizzy with uh with hope i know my history

3:14:58.960 --> 3:15:06.080
 i know my economics my fellow humans and all of that and we know that there's an unfailing recipe

3:15:08.640 --> 3:15:11.440
 and when it comes to that recipe we have the hardest part of it

3:15:11.440 --> 3:15:16.000
 the one missing ingredient which is a free markets

3:15:18.160 --> 3:15:25.280
 as we go around and talk and people start to understand and each country tries to figure

3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:34.320
 out okay where do we go there from here i i know that i will die with my continent

3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:40.480
 having taken the right shift for a turn i don't have to see where it ends because i

3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:45.680
 cannot in my wildest dream imagine where it's going to end but i know it's going to be

3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:49.040
 yeah so all my only job

3:15:51.520 --> 3:15:56.160
 is to get this message out and then let my people do with it what they want to do

3:15:56.160 --> 3:16:01.280
 yeah the scale of impact is just boundless it's kind of cool i mean you know sometimes we think

3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:06.400
 about individual problems and how do we solve them we look up at certain individuals like the

3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:13.040
 i don't know steve jobs and a lot of muscles but it's so much more powerful to just without

3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:22.080
 knowing what they will do give the freedom uh to millions to hundreds of millions of people

3:16:22.080 --> 3:16:26.960
 to do whatever the hell they're gonna do can you imagine can you just imagine it's truly

3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:32.400
 truly exciting so with the in that sense the work you're doing it's unimaginable the kind of impact

3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:39.040
 it would have now going back to that hard moment this dark place you went in in your mind in your

3:16:39.040 --> 3:16:46.240
 personal life story you lost your husband um what gave you strength during that time uh what were the

3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:54.000
 what were the places you went to your mind in terms of personal struggle in terms of maybe even

3:16:54.000 --> 3:17:05.600
 depression or or these kinds of struggles i think for me when my person passed away i went to

3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:10.960
 maybe my friend could see what was going on maybe they couldn't i don't know

3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:16.320
 but on the surface i looked like i was fine but what happened is the only thing i think that

3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:24.000
 kept me around as i thought about it uh was um the job to be done

3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:32.880
 these women relied on me and i was no longer free i did not own myself and they said it in

3:17:32.880 --> 3:17:41.440
 those words you don't own yourself anymore and it was true but it helped me because i was able to um

3:17:41.440 --> 3:17:47.600
 um you know sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around whatever it takes and that's what i would

3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:53.200
 tell people who feel like they can't just push one more push and they think they need to end it

3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:59.120
 at that point whatever it takes just just stick around for one more second because the next second

3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:07.120
 you know so i stuck around because of duty i felt a very strong sense of duty my duty

3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:11.520
 was in this case i think stronger than my than my pain i don't know if it's possible i don't

3:18:11.520 --> 3:18:20.240
 know how that was possible but it was and um and i just pushed my grief under the rug for years

3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:27.120
 for years i worked like a mad lady i traveled i would travel i would do three states in three

3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:32.880
 days landing between the morning around five or six going right along with our distributors

3:18:32.880 --> 3:18:37.280
 because it was beverage and just keep going and have all of this energy and look like everything

3:18:37.280 --> 3:18:42.160
 is fine but what happened was just like i was focused on the job to be done and sometimes

3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:47.760
 it is okay to do that at least for me it was my safety my you know like when you're in the water

3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:53.280
 and you're about to sink and they throw you that um that round thing i don't know how you call it um

3:18:53.280 --> 3:18:58.880
 you know that uh you know that keeps you afloat you mean yes yes it's a odor yeah whatever yeah

3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:07.280
 between the two of us we're still terrible i know exactly what you mean exactly right so you

3:19:07.280 --> 3:19:13.120
 understand me so they send you that thing and you just i was just hanging onto it my life

3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:22.080
 depended on this thing so these women they carried me they carried me and with time things are moving

3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:28.640
 forward and at some point i went into a really really deep depression and um i went into a very

3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:35.040
 dark place even darker than the one i think i came from because by that time i had worked for years

3:19:35.040 --> 3:19:40.480
 on this company and now some other things was happening and around that time it's also when i

3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:48.240
 was discovering a lot of what i'm we talked about today about what makes a country rich and for me

3:19:48.240 --> 3:20:00.400
 to understand that um my network i was very much into um left oriented network and um to to just

3:20:00.400 --> 3:20:07.200
 start to to see all of this i tried to address it to realize that many of these people would prefer

3:20:07.200 --> 3:20:13.920
 go running for the hills than except for a moment that maybe capitalism might be part of a solution

3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:23.760
 when many of them were involved in capitalism so um that was a hard time at some point i was um

3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:32.480
 yeah so many things were happening around that time that basically shook up everything for me

3:20:33.440 --> 3:20:37.440
 one is hard to talk about because it's very personal and the person that i that was

3:20:37.440 --> 3:20:44.480
 but i but i was having a problem with passed away last year and um i'm one to always say leave

3:20:44.480 --> 3:20:50.960
 a dead alone so because of that i won't speak about it but there too having a major fallout

3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:56.080
 with somebody who was like a fabric figure for me somebody that i completely trusted and so

3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:00.800
 at some point you just tell ask yourself was my whole life built on a lie

3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:11.600
 right and um and then you're confused and then you become confused and and then at some point

3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:15.600
 you lose 90 percent of your friends because of ideologically speaking it doesn't work anymore

3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:25.760
 um then you just wonder have i have i been asleep this whole time and then you start

3:21:25.760 --> 3:21:31.360
 to wonder remember when you asked me who am i at some point legs i literally was like a candle in

3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:39.520
 the wind i felt like i was a candle in the wind and it was very hard to come back from that and um

3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:45.360
 people have a hard the few people i talked to about this they have a hardest time understanding

3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:51.520
 or even believing it because they're like you i'm like yes me i used to be a candle in the wind

3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:59.280
 what got you out what made you overcome that my current husband my current husband love love

3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:05.600
 see when i tell you love is the answer but him he came with love but he also came with

3:22:06.720 --> 3:22:12.320
 um really helping me figure out the world so what michael because it's him who we're talking

3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:19.920
 about michael strong um that must be special he's so special he's so so special so you have no idea

3:22:19.920 --> 3:22:26.320
 how special he is but you know um michael the reason why i have such love respect and admiration for

3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:32.480
 my husband i'll never say enough is because um actually it's one of those relationships that

3:22:32.480 --> 3:22:42.800
 got built based on intellect first you see at some point i was in the position where i could start a

3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:53.360
 foundation after having built my first business and all i wanted was an ability to um power

3:22:54.240 --> 3:23:02.400
 as many especially women african women entrepreneurs like me a few years ago before then to do

3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:08.240
 something like i was able to do bring back to the world some really cool aspects of our culture

3:23:08.240 --> 3:23:13.520
 built into a really cool brand 21st century type that's what i wanted to do because the more i could

3:23:13.520 --> 3:23:20.080
 promote women like that and put steam behind them and the more my dream envisioned for and

3:23:20.080 --> 3:23:26.320
 respected africa prosperous africa would happen back then that's what i wanted and around me this

3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:34.880
 was also part of the whole crisis of um ideologies i had back then everybody was like well we

3:23:34.880 --> 3:23:41.040
 we should be just doing grants and i knew that i my people didn't need grants they didn't need

3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:49.280
 like a handout they don't want your charity i didn't want charity i wanted someone who could

3:23:49.280 --> 3:23:55.760
 work with me on my accounting i wanted somebody who um could help me brainstorm marketing wise

3:23:55.760 --> 3:24:03.200
 i wanted somebody or i needed to raise money to um pay my um my research and development guy

3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:09.680
 to help me you know take the juices from my grandma's recipe to something that can be

3:24:09.680 --> 3:24:17.360
 shelf stable i i uh if you're gonna i needed coaching these are all the things that i needed

3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:22.000
 to make my dream happen i didn't want you to give me some crap for free that's not what i want i

3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:27.600
 just want um to be able to build my business with all the things that business building needs and so

3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:34.560
 and so that's what i wanted to do and it's what it was needed and so michael somebody

3:24:34.560 --> 3:24:37.600
 found out about what i was doing because in back in the days in southwest cove they would write a

3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:43.520
 lot about me and everything and um uh so michael along with john mackey the founder of whole

3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:49.520
 foods market they had a nonprofit called flow and it's all about human flourishing they want

3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:54.160
 for people everybody to get this um choice visibility to be able to get to a point in

3:24:54.160 --> 3:24:59.680
 their life where they're in complete flow it's uh michael just michael is the only one who

3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:03.360
 could say that last name but you know the whole concept of flow when you're in a state of flow

3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:07.280
 you're basically doing what you need what you're supposed to do the way you're supposed to do it

3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:11.760
 with the people who supposed this whole concept of flow it's a made it's human flourishing i

3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:20.000
 decided so you know so i meet with this man you flex you're so okay so we we we he finds me his

3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:24.960
 people find me and then there was a program where it was all about accelerating accelerating

3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:30.880
 women entrepreneurs so it's during these times that i'm starting now to see things that's when

3:25:30.880 --> 3:25:36.080
 actually all of this stuff that i noticed how come here it takes me all of this time to start my

3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:39.840
 business over there's 20 minutes here it's free over there's thousands of dollars all of this

3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:43.200
 nonsense that i just took oh maybe it's just because we're messed up we're poor that's why

3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:49.040
 everything is so messed up whoa these people are introducing me to concepts i'm like first of all i'm

3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:56.960
 like oh really um what did you call um the uh doing business in the right what is that um you

3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:01.600
 know all of this stuff and i'm starting to discover this whole other body of work

3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:08.160
 what that the free markets like this thing that i was sensing this environment that i was sensing

3:26:08.160 --> 3:26:14.640
 that it was different around me and that they called it the free markets over here and over there that

3:26:14.640 --> 3:26:20.880
 and then i started to butt head those ideas with the ideas that i was fed with before that

3:26:21.680 --> 3:26:27.520
 and the evidence won and further more than the evidence the evidence combined with my

3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:34.560
 lived experience it was so powerful so i basically understood understanding these ideas from the most

3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:44.400
 visceral part of my my body you know of my being and it made sense so michael michael helped me find

3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:52.160
 the solution the answer to my lifelong little girl's question of why do they have this and we don't

3:26:52.160 --> 3:27:00.240
 and how do some countries like mine be poor while others are rich and with the with learn with

3:27:00.240 --> 3:27:11.040
 understanding all of that the greatest biggest sense of liberation came upon me like i i have no

3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:17.520
 other word to describe that true liberation the liberation that comes from a peer to finally

3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:29.760
 understand and be vindicated in your own you know understand in your own um deep knowing or

3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:35.760
 feeling that they're not what they're saying is not true you're not the problem it's not you

3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:42.080
 you there's something else and when i discovered that my whole life changed so and since then

3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:47.920
 i have been i've been very serious about going deeper and deeper and deeper into my understanding

3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:54.880
 of all of this understanding the subtlety at some point i was very angry about the liberators of

3:27:54.880 --> 3:28:01.840
 africa because i was like yes you helped liberators but just to keep us in this marism i was angry

3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:09.600
 for longest time and then eventually you have to engage empathy and love to put yourself in their

3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:14.480
 shoes and try to understand the time at which they were living and that got me onto a journey of

3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:19.680
 trying to understand history more that's how i understood i was able to go beyond just these

3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:25.280
 liberators and try to understand and rebuild the world around them at the macro at the micro and

3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:33.120
 at the also the at the at the macro level just really you have to try to walk in their shoes and

3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:38.480
 from there finally separate the baby with the bath water that they were not able to do back then

3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:45.280
 that's why today i'm sorry but i have no patience for the blm organizers founders especially founders

3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:49.120
 i don't know what the organizers think but the founders told us what they stand for and i say

3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:55.280
 guys don't make that same mistake again if you're serious about this you cannot make the same mistake

3:28:56.160 --> 3:29:03.200
 the liberators of africa they have an excuse we did no better it was it was so easy back then to

3:29:03.200 --> 3:29:11.200
 conflate everything but today you me anybody alive cannot with a straight face embrace marxist

3:29:11.200 --> 3:29:20.560
 socialist ideas especially especially when they're claiming that they wanted people to thrive no you

3:29:20.560 --> 3:29:26.480
 can't i'm sorry and i will hold you i will hold your feet up to the to the fire on that one i will

3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:29.920
 i will and that's what i'm doing they will give me a lot of grief for this but guess what i could

3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:36.480
 care less do you know why i could care less because we have an entire population to help rise

3:29:36.480 --> 3:29:46.880
 out of property into prosperity where they become you know co creators global co creators of innovation

3:29:48.640 --> 3:29:56.000
 and those ideas give you hope for the place you love for sanago for africa they do they do i live

3:29:56.000 --> 3:30:05.120
 the world i live in the new centers of culture and fashion are in dakar the new the new the new

3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:14.640
 centers of tech and and um you know crypto even is somewhere maybe nigeria so you see that future

3:30:14.640 --> 3:30:21.360
 you see that future clearly i do i do i do it's a beautiful thing and uh it's also beautiful

3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:27.600
 to see that the space of these uh really powerful ideas is where you also found love right so at

3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:32.720
 the intersection at the intersection micah and i would spend hours talking about all of these

3:30:32.720 --> 3:30:37.200
 ideas and i would be like but what about this no it doesn't make any sense no no no oh no

3:30:37.200 --> 3:30:44.880
 and then hours every single day for months legs yeah and then uh from there our love was born

3:30:44.880 --> 3:30:49.600
 because i tell people for us love is not about looking around the eyes like you know they all

3:30:49.600 --> 3:30:54.480
 think but it's about we look in one direction and in this case it's this vision what we know

3:30:54.480 --> 3:31:01.120
 to be possible and true if only you liberate people we what we know to be true and possible

3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:07.520
 we all of us are miracles walking around every time i get on the plane it's the miracle of

3:31:07.520 --> 3:31:13.360
 engineering um all the things we're able to do you know now when they do operation on your teeth

3:31:13.360 --> 3:31:18.880
 how they're able to put the pain down away all of this is us you're working on these robots

3:31:20.320 --> 3:31:26.720
 this this this inside here humans are amazing i know so that's why and when it works in great

3:31:26.720 --> 3:31:32.800
