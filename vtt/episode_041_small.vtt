00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Leonard Suskind.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.400
 He's a professor of theoretical physics at Stanford University

00:06.400 --> 00:10.400
 and founding director of Stanford Institute of Theoretical Physics.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.800
 He is widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory and in general

00:14.800 --> 00:18.720
 is one of the greatest physicists of our time both as a researcher

00:18.720 --> 00:23.200
 and an educator. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.560
 Perhaps you noticed that the people I've been speaking with are not just

00:26.560 --> 00:31.200
 computer scientists but philosophers, mathematicians, writers, psychologists,

00:31.200 --> 00:34.880
 physicists, and soon other disciplines. To me,

00:34.880 --> 00:38.800
 AI is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.720
 It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind

00:42.720 --> 00:47.920
 and creating echoes of it in the machine. If you enjoy the podcast, subscribe on

00:57.440 --> 01:02.640
 And now, here's my conversation with Leonard Suskind.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.960
 You worked and were friends with Richard Feynman. How has he influenced you

01:06.960 --> 01:10.080
 and changed you as a physicist and thinker?

01:10.080 --> 01:16.160
 What I saw, I think what I saw was somebody who could do physics in this

01:16.160 --> 01:20.480
 deeply intuitive way. His style was almost to close his

01:20.480 --> 01:24.480
 eyes and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.480
 And through visualization,

01:28.560 --> 01:32.640
 outflank the mathematical, the highly mathematical and

01:32.640 --> 01:36.880
 very, very sophisticated technical arguments that people would use.

01:36.880 --> 01:42.160
 I think that was also natural to me, but I saw somebody who was actually

01:42.160 --> 01:45.680
 successful at it, who could do physics in a way

01:45.680 --> 01:53.280
 that I regarded as simpler, more direct,

01:53.280 --> 01:57.920
 more intuitive. And while I don't think he changed

01:57.920 --> 02:01.360
 my way of thinking, I do think he validated it.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.800
 He made me look at it and say, yeah, that's something you can do

02:04.800 --> 02:08.800
 and get away with. Practically, you can get away with it.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.120
 So, do you find yourself, whether you're thinking about quantum mechanics

02:13.120 --> 02:18.000
 or black holes or string theory using intuition

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
 as a first step or step throughout using visualization?

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
 Yeah, very much so. Very much so. I tend not to think about the equations. I tend

02:28.000 --> 02:32.560
 not to think about the symbols. I tend to try to visualize the

02:32.560 --> 02:36.320
 phenomena themselves. And then when I get an insight

02:36.320 --> 02:40.800
 that I think is valid, I might try to convert it to mathematics. But I'm not a

02:40.800 --> 02:46.080
 I'm not a natural mathematician or I'm good enough at it.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.760
 I'm good enough at it, but I'm not a great mathematician.

02:49.760 --> 02:55.280
 So, for me, the way of thinking about physics is first intuitive, first

02:55.280 --> 03:01.520
 visualization, scribble a few equations maybe, but then try to convert it to

03:01.520 --> 03:04.400
 mathematics. Experiences that other people are

03:04.400 --> 03:07.920
 better at converting it to mathematics than I am.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.360
 And yet, you've worked very counterintuitive ideas.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.440
 So, how do you visualize something counterintuitive?

03:15.440 --> 03:19.840
 How do you dare rewiring your brain in new ways?

03:19.840 --> 03:24.960
 Yeah, quantum mechanics is not intuitive. Very little of modern physics is

03:24.960 --> 03:29.440
 intuitive. What does intuitive mean?

03:29.440 --> 03:33.840
 It means the ability to think about it with basic classical physics, the

03:33.840 --> 03:40.960
 physics that we evolved with throwing stones,

03:40.960 --> 03:47.040
 splashing water, whatever it happens to be. Quantum physics, general relativity,

03:47.040 --> 03:51.120
 quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.280
 But, you know, after time and getting familiar with these things, you

03:55.280 --> 03:59.680
 develop new intuitions. I always said you rewire.

03:59.680 --> 04:04.320
 And it's to the point where me and many of my friends,

04:04.320 --> 04:09.680
 I and many of my friends, can think more easily quantum

04:09.680 --> 04:13.360
 mechanically than we can classically. We've gotten so used to it.

04:13.360 --> 04:18.800
 I mean, yes, our neural wiring in our brain is such that we understand

04:18.800 --> 04:22.000
 rocks and stones and water and so on. We're sort of evolved for that.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.640
 Evolved for it. Do you think it's possible to create a wiring

04:26.640 --> 04:32.720
 of neuron like state devices that more naturally understand

04:32.720 --> 04:37.920
 quantum mechanics, understand wave function, understand these weird things?

04:37.920 --> 04:41.760
 Well, I'm not sure. I think many of us have evolved

04:41.760 --> 04:46.240
 the ability to think quantum mechanically to some extent.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.080
 But that doesn't mean you can think like an electron.

04:50.080 --> 04:55.760
 That doesn't mean another example. Forget for a minute, quantum mechanics.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.240
 Just visualizing four dimensional space or five dimensional space or six

05:00.240 --> 05:05.600
 dimensional space, I think we're fundamentally wired

05:05.600 --> 05:09.360
 to visualize three dimensions. I can't even

05:09.360 --> 05:13.520
 visualize two dimensions or one dimension without thinking about it as

05:13.520 --> 05:18.160
 embedded in three dimensions. If I want to visualize a line,

05:18.160 --> 05:22.800
 I think of the line as being a line in three dimensions.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.240
 Or I think of the line as being a line on a piece of paper with a piece of paper

05:26.240 --> 05:30.080
 being in three dimensions. I never seem to be able to

05:30.080 --> 05:34.880
 in some abstract and pure way visualize in my head

05:34.880 --> 05:38.640
 the one dimension, the two dimension, the four dimension, the five dimensions,

05:38.640 --> 05:42.480
 and I don't think that's ever going to happen. The reason is I think

05:42.480 --> 05:46.720
 neural wiring is just set up for that.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.240
 On the other hand, we do learn ways to think about

05:50.240 --> 05:54.400
 five, six, seven dimensions. We learn ways, we learn

05:54.400 --> 06:00.640
 mathematical ways, and we learn ways to visualize them, but they're different.

06:00.640 --> 06:05.520
 And so yeah, I think we do rewire ourselves, whether we can ever

06:05.520 --> 06:09.120
 completely rewire ourselves to be completely comfortable with these

06:09.120 --> 06:13.360
 concepts, I doubt. So that it's completely natural.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.720
 Difficult to where it's completely natural. So I'm sure there's

06:16.720 --> 06:21.600
 somewhat, you could argue, creatures that live in a two dimensional

06:21.600 --> 06:26.960
 space. Yeah, maybe there are. And while it's

06:26.960 --> 06:30.000
 romanticizing the notion, of course, we're all living as far as we know in

06:30.000 --> 06:34.400
 three dimensional space, but how do those creatures imagine

06:34.400 --> 06:37.680
 3D space? Well, probably the way we imagine 4D by

06:37.680 --> 06:41.920
 using some mathematics and some equations and some

06:41.920 --> 06:47.280
 some tricks. Okay, so jumping back to Feynman just

06:47.280 --> 06:53.760
 for a second, he had a little bit of an ego.

06:53.760 --> 07:00.000
 Yes. Do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science?

07:00.000 --> 07:04.880
 I think both. Both. I think you have to have both arrogance

07:04.880 --> 07:08.720
 and humility. You have to have the arrogance to say

07:08.720 --> 07:13.600
 I can do this. Nature is difficult. Nature is very, very hard.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.880
 I'm smart enough. I can do it. I can win the battle with nature.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.920
 On the other hand, I think you also have to have the humility

07:21.920 --> 07:29.040
 to know that you're very likely to be wrong on any given occasion.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.280
 Everything you're thinking could suddenly change.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.040
 Young people can come along and say things you won't understand and you'll be

07:37.040 --> 07:42.480
 lost and flabbergasted. So I think it's a combination of both.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.480
 You better recognize that you're very limited

07:46.480 --> 07:50.320
 and you better be able to say to yourself I'm not so limited

07:50.320 --> 07:56.080
 that I can't win this battle with nature. It takes a special kind of

07:56.080 --> 07:59.600
 person who can manage both of those, I would say.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.800
 And I would say there's echoes of that in your own work.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.960
 A little bit of ego, a little bit of outside of the box, humble thinking.

08:06.960 --> 08:12.160
 I hope so. So was there a time

08:12.160 --> 08:17.920
 where you felt you looked at yourself and asked

08:17.920 --> 08:22.560
 am I completely wrong about this? Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about

08:22.560 --> 08:25.840
 specific things. The whole thing? What do you mean?

08:25.840 --> 08:29.840
 Wait, which whole thing? Me and me and my ability to do this thing.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.840
 Oh, those kinds of doubts. First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts?

08:33.840 --> 08:37.760
 No, I had different kind of doubts. I came from a very working class background

08:37.760 --> 08:43.600
 and I was uncomfortable in academia for, well, for a long time.

08:43.600 --> 08:48.240
 But there weren't doubts about my ability or my,

08:48.240 --> 08:54.720
 they were just the discomfort and being in an environment that

08:54.720 --> 08:58.320
 my family hadn't participated in. I knew nothing about as a young person. I

08:58.320 --> 09:01.600
 didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics until I was almost 20

09:01.600 --> 09:08.960
 years old. So I did have certain kind of

09:08.960 --> 09:13.440
 doubts, but not about my ability. I don't think I was too

09:13.440 --> 09:17.920
 worried about whether I would succeed or not.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.960
 I never felt this insecurity, am I ever going to get a job?

09:22.960 --> 09:27.040
 That had never occurred to me that I wouldn't.

09:27.040 --> 09:31.600
 Maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense of what is academia,

09:31.600 --> 09:37.120
 because I too feel a bit uncomfortable in it.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.200
 There's something I can't put quite into words, what you have

09:41.200 --> 09:45.120
 that's not, doesn't, if we call it music,

09:45.120 --> 09:48.480
 you play a different kind of music than a lot of academia.

09:48.480 --> 09:54.320
 How have you joined this orchestra? How do you think about it?

09:54.320 --> 09:57.520
 I don't know that I thought about it as much as I just

09:57.520 --> 10:02.720
 felt it. You know, thinking is one thing, feeling is another thing.

10:02.720 --> 10:08.640
 I felt like an outsider until a certain age when I suddenly found myself the

10:08.640 --> 10:13.760
 ultimate insider in academic physics.

10:14.480 --> 10:20.160
 That was a sharp transition and I wasn't a young man. I was

10:20.160 --> 10:24.320
 probably 50 years old. You were never quite, it was a face

10:24.320 --> 10:27.280
 transition, you were never quite in the middle.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.920
 Yeah, that's right, I wasn't. I always felt a little bit of an outsider

10:31.920 --> 10:35.920
 in the beginning, a lot an outsider.

10:37.200 --> 10:43.040
 My way of thinking was different, my approach to mathematics was different,

10:43.040 --> 10:49.200
 but also my social background that I came from was different.

10:49.200 --> 10:53.040
 Now these days, half the young people I meet, they're parents or professors.

10:53.040 --> 10:57.440
 Right. That was not my case.

10:57.600 --> 11:04.400
 So yeah, but then all of a sudden at some point I found myself at very much the

11:04.400 --> 11:09.120
 center of, maybe not the only one at the center, but certainly one of the people

11:09.120 --> 11:14.320
 in the center of a certain kind of physics and all that went away.

11:14.320 --> 11:21.680
 I mean it went away in a flash. So maybe a little bit with Feynman,

11:21.680 --> 11:24.880
 but in general, how do you develop ideas? Do you work

11:24.880 --> 11:27.680
 through ideas alone? Do you brainstorm with others?

11:27.680 --> 11:34.800
 Oh, both, both, very definitely both. The younger time I spent more time with

11:34.800 --> 11:38.640
 myself. Now because I'm at

11:38.640 --> 11:45.440
 Stanford, because I'm, because I have a lot of

11:45.440 --> 11:52.720
 ex students and people who are interested in the same thing I am,

11:52.720 --> 11:56.320
 I spend a good deal of time almost on a daily basis

11:56.320 --> 12:02.240
 interacting, brainstorming, as you said. It's a very important part.

12:02.240 --> 12:08.720
 I spend less time probably completely self focused than

12:08.720 --> 12:13.040
 with a piece of paper and just sitting there staring at it.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.720
 What are your hopes for quantum computers?

12:16.720 --> 12:22.240
 So machines that are based on, that have some elements of

12:22.240 --> 12:26.160
 leveraged quantum mechanical ideas. Yeah, it's not just leveraging quantum

12:26.160 --> 12:33.280
 mechanical ideas. You can simulate quantum systems on a classical computer.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.640
 Simulate them means solve this Schrodinger equation for them

12:36.640 --> 12:41.200
 or solve the equations of quantum mechanics on

12:41.200 --> 12:47.360
 a computer, on a classical computer. But the classical computer is not doing,

12:47.360 --> 12:51.360
 is not a quantum mechanical system itself. Of course it is. Everything's made of

12:51.360 --> 12:54.320
 quantum mechanics, but it's not functioning. It's not functioning as

12:54.320 --> 12:58.480
 a quantum system. It's just solving equations.

12:58.480 --> 13:02.320
 The quantum computer is truly a quantum system which is

13:02.320 --> 13:07.280
 actually doing the things that you're programming it to do.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.920
 You want to program a quantum field theory?

13:11.920 --> 13:16.880
 If you do it in classical physics, that program is not actually functioning in

13:16.880 --> 13:21.760
 the computer as a quantum field theory. It's just solving some equations.

13:21.760 --> 13:27.120
 Physically it's not doing the things that the quantum system would do.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.800
 The quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system which is

13:30.800 --> 13:36.320
 actually carrying out the quantum operations. You can measure it at the end.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.400
 It intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle.

13:40.400 --> 13:45.120
 It is limited in the same way that quantum systems are limited

13:45.120 --> 13:49.840
 by uncertainty and so forth. And it really is a quantum system. That means

13:49.840 --> 13:52.960
 that what you're doing when you program something for a quantum

13:52.960 --> 13:58.160
 system is you're actually building a real version of the system.

13:58.160 --> 14:02.880
 The limits of a classical computer. Classical computers are enormously limited

14:02.880 --> 14:07.760
 when it comes to the quantum systems. They're enormously

14:07.760 --> 14:12.160
 limited because you've probably heard this before.

14:12.160 --> 14:16.400
 But in order to store the amount of information that's in the quantum state

14:16.400 --> 14:23.920
 of 400 spins, that's not very many. 400 can put in my pocket.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.360
 400 pennies in my pocket.

14:27.760 --> 14:34.800
 To be able to simulate the quantum state of 400 elementary quantum

14:34.800 --> 14:40.160
 systems, qubits we call them, to do that would take more information than can

14:40.160 --> 14:44.800
 possibly be stored in the entire universe if it were packed

14:44.800 --> 14:50.400
 so tightly that you couldn't pack any more in.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.000
 400 qubits. On the other hand, if your quantum

14:54.000 --> 14:59.360
 computer is composed of 400 qubits, it can do everything 400 qubits can do.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.040
 What kind of space, if you just intuitively think about the space of

15:03.040 --> 15:08.400
 algorithms that that unlocks for us. So there's a whole complexity theory

15:08.400 --> 15:12.400
 around classical computers measuring the running time of things

15:12.400 --> 15:18.320
 and p, so on. What kind of algorithms just intuitively do you think it unlocks for us?

15:18.320 --> 15:23.120
 Okay, so we know that there are a handful of algorithms that can seriously

15:23.120 --> 15:27.120
 be classical computers and which can have exponentially

15:27.120 --> 15:30.640
 more power. This is a mathematical statement. Nobody's exhibited this in

15:30.640 --> 15:33.920
 the laboratory. That's a mathematical statement. We know

15:33.920 --> 15:38.000
 that's true, but it also seems more and more that the

15:38.000 --> 15:43.600
 number of such things is very limited. Only very, very special

15:43.600 --> 15:49.840
 problems exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer,

15:49.840 --> 15:54.640
 of standard problems. To my mind, as far as I can tell, the great power of

15:54.640 --> 15:59.760
 quantum computers will actually be the simulate quantum systems.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.640
 If you're interested in a certain quantum system

16:02.640 --> 16:08.640
 and it's too hard to simulate classically, you simply build a version

16:08.640 --> 16:12.240
 of the same system. You build a version of it, you build a model of it that's

16:12.240 --> 16:16.720
 actually functioning as the system, you run it, and then you do the same thing

16:16.720 --> 16:20.320
 you would do the quantum system, you make measurements on it,

16:20.320 --> 16:26.400
 quantum measurements on it. The advantage is you can run it much slower

16:26.400 --> 16:29.360
 because say, why bother? Why not just use the real system?

16:29.360 --> 16:33.440
 Why not just do experiments on the real system? Well, real systems are kind of

16:33.440 --> 16:36.240
 limited. You can't change them. You can't manipulate them.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.320
 You can't slow them down so that you can poke into them.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.120
 You can't modify them in arbitrary kinds of ways to see what would happen

16:45.120 --> 16:53.440
 if I change the system a little bit. I think that quantum computers

16:53.440 --> 17:00.000
 will be extremely valuable in understanding quantum

17:00.000 --> 17:03.360
 systems. At the lowest level, the fundamental

17:03.360 --> 17:06.480
 laws. They're actually satisfying the same laws

17:06.480 --> 17:09.760
 as the systems that they're simulating. That's right.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.960
 Okay, so on the one hand you have things like factoring.

17:12.960 --> 17:18.320
 Factoring is the great thing of quantum computers, factoring large

17:18.320 --> 17:20.880
 numbers. That doesn't seem that much to do with

17:20.880 --> 17:25.520
 quantum mechanics. It seems to be almost a fluke

17:25.520 --> 17:31.520
 that a quantum computer can solve the factoring problem

17:31.520 --> 17:37.120
 in a short time. Those problems seem to be extremely special,

17:37.120 --> 17:42.560
 rare, and it's not clear to me that there's going to be a lot of them.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.000
 On the other hand, there are a lot of quantum systems. There's chemistry,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.520
 there's solid state physics, there's material science,

17:49.520 --> 17:54.400
 there's quantum gravity, there's all kinds of quantum field theory.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.640
 Some of these are actually turning out to be applied sciences as well as very

17:58.640 --> 18:04.560
 fundamental sciences. We probably will run out of the

18:04.560 --> 18:07.840
 ability to solve equations for these things.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.600
 Solve equations by the standard methods of pencil and paper.

18:11.600 --> 18:16.240
 Solve the equations by the method of classical computers.

18:16.240 --> 18:20.720
 And so what we'll do is we'll build versions of these systems,

18:20.720 --> 18:25.280
 run them, and run them under controlled circumstances where we can change them,

18:25.280 --> 18:29.440
 manipulate them, make measurements on them, and find out all the things we want

18:29.440 --> 18:33.600
 to know. So in finding out the things we want to know

18:33.600 --> 18:40.160
 about very small systems, is there something we can also find out

18:40.160 --> 18:44.320
 about the macro level, about something about the function,

18:44.320 --> 18:49.840
 forgive me, of our brain, biological systems, the stuff that's about one meter

18:49.840 --> 18:53.920
 in size versus much, much smaller? Well, what all the

18:53.920 --> 18:57.120
 excitement is about among the people that I interact with is

18:57.120 --> 19:02.000
 understanding black holes. Black holes. Black holes are big things.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.040
 They are many, many degrees of freedom. There is another kind of quantum system

19:07.040 --> 19:12.560
 that is big. It's a large quantum computer. And one of the things we've

19:12.560 --> 19:16.400
 learned is that the physics of large quantum computers is in some way

19:16.400 --> 19:19.600
 similar to the physics of large quantum black holes.

19:19.600 --> 19:24.160
 And we're using that relationship. Now you asked, you didn't ask about quantum

19:24.160 --> 19:29.840
 computers as systems, you didn't ask about black holes, you asked about brains.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.920
 Yeah, about stuff that's in the middle of the two. It's different.

19:33.920 --> 19:38.480
 So black holes are, there's something fundamental

19:38.480 --> 19:43.120
 about black holes that feels to be very different than a brain. Yes.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.720
 And they also function in a very quantum mechanical way. Right.

19:46.720 --> 19:52.640
 Okay. It is, first of all, unclear to me, but of course it's unclear to me. I'm not

19:52.640 --> 19:58.240
 I'm not a neuroscientist. I have, I don't even have very many friends who are

19:58.240 --> 20:01.520
 neuroscientists. I would like to have more friends who are

20:01.520 --> 20:05.520
 neuroscientists. I just don't run into them very often.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.680
 Among the few neuroscientists I've ever talked about about this,

20:09.680 --> 20:14.000
 they are pretty convinced that the brain

20:14.000 --> 20:19.280
 functions classically, that it is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical

20:19.280 --> 20:22.720
 system, or it doesn't make use of the of the

20:22.720 --> 20:26.320
 special features entanglement, coherent superposition.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.240
 Are they right? I don't know. I sort of hope they're wrong,

20:30.240 --> 20:34.080
 just because I like the romantic idea that the brain is a quantum

20:34.080 --> 20:38.560
 system. Yeah. But I think, I think probably not.

20:38.560 --> 20:43.360
 The other thing, big systems can be composed of lots of little systems.

20:43.360 --> 20:47.760
 Okay. Materials, the materials that we work with and so forth

20:47.760 --> 20:52.720
 are, can be large systems, a large piece of material,

20:52.720 --> 20:56.320
 but they're big and they're made out of quantum systems. Now one of the things

20:56.320 --> 21:00.480
 that's been happening over the last, a good number of years

21:00.480 --> 21:04.640
 is we're discovering materials and quantum systems

21:04.640 --> 21:08.320
 which function much more quantum mechanically

21:08.320 --> 21:13.440
 than we imagine. Topological insulators, this kind of thing, that kind of thing.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.840
 Those are macroscopic systems, but they're just superconductors,

21:17.840 --> 21:22.800
 superconductors. I have a lot of quantum mechanics in them.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.840
 You can have a large chunk of superconductor, so it's a big piece of

21:25.840 --> 21:28.880
 material. On the other hand, it's functioning and

21:28.880 --> 21:32.720
 its properties depend very, very strongly on quantum mechanics

21:32.720 --> 21:37.360
 and to analyze them, you need the tools of quantum mechanics.

21:37.360 --> 21:43.680
 If we can go on to black holes and looking at the universe as a

21:43.680 --> 21:48.480
 information processing system, as a computer, as a giant computer,

21:48.480 --> 21:51.840
 what's the power of thinking of the universe as an information processing

21:51.840 --> 21:55.680
 system, but what is perhaps its use besides the

21:55.680 --> 22:00.080
 mathematical use of discussing black holes and

22:00.080 --> 22:04.080
 your famous debates and ideas around that to

22:04.080 --> 22:08.640
 human beings or life in general as information processing systems.

22:08.640 --> 22:13.120
 But all systems are information processing systems.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.640
 You poke them, they change a little bit, they evolve.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.320
 All systems are information processing systems. So there's no extra magic

22:20.320 --> 22:24.400
 to us humans. It certainly feels, consciousness and

22:24.400 --> 22:29.280
 intelligence feels like magic. It sure does. Where does it emerge from

22:29.280 --> 22:33.600
 if we look at information processing?

22:33.600 --> 22:37.440
 What are the emergent phenomena that come from viewing the world

22:37.440 --> 22:41.840
 as an information processing system? Here is what I think.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.960
 My thoughts are not worth much in this. If you ask me about physics, my thoughts

22:44.960 --> 22:48.320
 may be worth something. Yes. If you ask me about this, I'm not

22:48.320 --> 22:53.200
 sure my thoughts are worth anything, but as I said earlier,

22:53.200 --> 22:57.920
 I think when we do introspection, when we imagine doing introspection and try to

22:57.920 --> 23:00.400
 figure out what it is when we do and we're thinking,

23:00.400 --> 23:04.800
 I think we get it wrong. I'm pretty sure we get it wrong.

23:04.800 --> 23:09.680
 Everything I've heard about the way the brain functions is so counterintuitive.

23:09.680 --> 23:14.240
 For example, you have neurons which detect vertical lines.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.400
 You have different neurons which detect lines at 45 degrees. You have different

23:18.400 --> 23:21.200
 neurons. I never imagined that there were whole

23:21.200 --> 23:25.200
 circuits which were devoted to vertical lines in my brain.

23:25.200 --> 23:29.440
 It doesn't seem to me the way my brain works. My brain seems to work if I put my

23:29.440 --> 23:32.960
 finger up vertically, or if I put it horizontally, or if I put it this way or

23:32.960 --> 23:36.080
 that way. It seems to me it's the same circuits.

23:36.080 --> 23:41.440
 It's not the way it works. The way the brain is compartmentalized

23:41.440 --> 23:46.400
 seems to be very, very different than what I would have imagined if I were just

23:46.400 --> 23:51.840
 doing psychological introspection about how things work.

23:51.840 --> 23:55.840
 My conclusion is that we won't get it right that way.

23:55.840 --> 24:02.320
 How will we get it right? I think maybe computer scientists will get it

24:02.320 --> 24:04.800
 right eventually. I don't think there are any ways near it. I don't even think

24:04.800 --> 24:08.640
 they're thinking about it. But by computer, eventually we will

24:08.640 --> 24:14.960
 build machines perhaps which are complicated enough

24:14.960 --> 24:20.640
 and partly engineered, partly evolved, maybe evolved by machine learning and so

24:20.640 --> 24:23.360
 forth. This machine learning is very interesting.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.440
 By machine learning we will evolve systems and we may start

24:27.440 --> 24:34.240
 to discover mechanisms that have implications

24:34.240 --> 24:39.360
 for how we think and for what this consciousness thing is all about.

24:39.360 --> 24:44.800
 We'll be able to do experiments on them and perhaps answer questions

24:44.800 --> 24:49.520
 that we can't possibly answer by introspection.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.800
 That's a really interesting point. In many cases,

24:52.800 --> 24:57.040
 if you look even at string theory, when you first think about a system it seems

24:57.040 --> 25:02.400
 really complicated, like the human brain. Through some basic reasoning

25:02.400 --> 25:06.480
 and trying to discover fundamental low level

25:06.480 --> 25:10.080
 behavior of the system, you find out that it's actually much simpler.

25:10.080 --> 25:15.440
 Is that generally the process and do you have that also hope

25:15.440 --> 25:20.560
 for biological systems as well, for all the kinds of stuff we're studying

25:20.560 --> 25:23.920
 at the human level? Of course, physics always begins by trying to find the

25:23.920 --> 25:27.680
 simplest version of something and analyze it. There are lots of

25:27.680 --> 25:32.640
 examples where physics has taken very complicated

25:32.640 --> 25:36.960
 systems, analyzed them and found simplicity in them for sure.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.800
 I said superconductors before. It's an obvious one. A superconductor seems like

25:40.800 --> 25:44.320
 a monstrously complicated thing with all sorts of crazy

25:44.320 --> 25:48.240
 electrical properties, magnetic properties and so forth.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.800
 When it finally is boiled down to its simplest elements,

25:52.800 --> 25:56.080
 it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon

25:56.080 --> 26:03.600
 called spontaneous symmetry breaking which we, in other contexts,

26:03.600 --> 26:08.320
 we learned about and we're very familiar with. So yeah, I mean,

26:08.320 --> 26:12.000
 yes, we do take complicated things, make them simple,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.600
 but what we don't want to do is take things which are intrinsically

26:15.600 --> 26:20.480
 complicated and fool ourselves into thinking that we can make them simple.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.920
 I don't know who said this, but we don't want to make them simpler than they

26:23.920 --> 26:30.160
 really are. Is the brain a thing which ultimately

26:30.160 --> 26:35.440
 functions by some simple rules or is it just complicated?

26:35.440 --> 26:40.000
 In terms of artificial intelligence, nobody really knows

26:40.000 --> 26:42.240
 what are the limits of our current approaches. You mentioned machine

26:42.240 --> 26:45.760
 learning. How do we create human level intelligence? It seems that there's a

26:45.760 --> 26:50.400
 lot of very smart physicists who perhaps oversimplify the nature of

26:50.400 --> 26:53.680
 intelligence and think of it as information processing

26:53.680 --> 26:57.040
 and therefore there doesn't seem to be any theoretical reason

26:57.040 --> 27:02.400
 why we can't artificially create human level or superhuman level

27:02.400 --> 27:07.200
 intelligence. In fact, the reasoning goes if you create human level intelligence,

27:07.200 --> 27:10.400
 the same approach you just used to create human level intelligence

27:10.400 --> 27:14.480
 should allow you to create superhuman level intelligence very easily,

27:14.480 --> 27:18.800
 exponentially. So what do you think that way of thinking

27:18.800 --> 27:23.760
 that comes from physicist is all about? I wish I knew, but there's a particular

27:23.760 --> 27:30.240
 reason why I wish I knew. I have a second job.

27:30.240 --> 27:34.800
 I consult for Google, not for Google, for Google X.

27:34.800 --> 27:43.600
 I am the senior academic advisor to a group of machine learning physicists.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.600
 Now that sounds crazy because I know nothing about the subject.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.280
 I know very little about the subject. On the other hand, I'm good at giving

27:51.280 --> 27:54.640
 advice, so I give them advice on things. Anyway,

27:54.640 --> 27:58.480
 I see these young physicists who are approaching the machine learning problem.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.520
 There is a real machine learning problem, namely why does it

28:01.520 --> 28:06.400
 work as well as it does? Nobody really seems to understand

28:06.400 --> 28:09.920
 why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations that it does

28:09.920 --> 28:15.200
 and so forth. There are three groups of people who

28:15.200 --> 28:18.880
 have thought about this. There are the engineers.

28:18.880 --> 28:24.080
 The engineers are incredibly smart, but they tend not to think as hard about

28:24.080 --> 28:28.160
 why the thing is working as much as they do how to use it.

28:28.160 --> 28:34.080
 Obviously, they provided a lot of data, and it is they who demonstrated that

28:34.080 --> 28:37.280
 machine learning can work much better than you had any right to expect.

28:37.280 --> 28:41.360
 The machine learning systems are systems that the system is not too

28:41.360 --> 28:44.720
 different than the kind of systems that physicists study.

28:44.720 --> 28:51.440
 There's not all that much difference in the structure of the mathematics.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.400
 Physically, yes, but in the structure of the mathematics

28:54.400 --> 29:00.560
 between a tensor network designed to describe a quantum system, on the one

29:00.560 --> 29:03.280
 hand, and the kind of networks that are used in

29:03.280 --> 29:08.880
 machine learning. So, there are more and more, I think,

29:08.880 --> 29:12.720
 young physicists are being drawn to this field of machine learning.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.720
 Some very, very good ones. I work with a number of very good ones.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.240
 Not on machine learning, but on having lunch.

29:20.240 --> 29:27.520
 On having lunch, right. And I can tell you, they are super smart.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.320
 They don't seem to be so arrogant about their physics backgrounds that they

29:32.320 --> 29:34.960
 think they can do things that nobody else can do.

29:34.960 --> 29:39.520
 But the physics way of thinking, I think, will add

29:39.520 --> 29:43.920
 great value to, will bring value to the machine learning.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.920
 I believe it will. And I think it already has.

29:47.920 --> 29:53.120
 At what time scale do you think predicting the future becomes useless?

29:53.120 --> 29:59.520
 And your long experience and being surprised in your discoveries?

29:59.520 --> 30:06.880
 Sometimes a day, sometimes 20 years. There are things which I thought

30:06.880 --> 30:12.240
 we were very far from understanding, which practically in a snap of the fingers

30:12.240 --> 30:17.280
 or a blink of the eye suddenly became understood,

30:17.280 --> 30:20.720
 completely surprising to me.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.920
 There are other things which I looked at and I said,

30:23.920 --> 30:27.120
 we're not going to understand these things for 500 years,

30:27.120 --> 30:32.640
 in particular quantum gravity. The scale for that was 20 years, 25 years.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.440
 And we understand a lot, and we don't understand it completely now by any

30:35.440 --> 30:39.120
 means. But I thought it was 500 years to make any

30:39.120 --> 30:42.560
 progress. It turned out to be very, very far from

30:42.560 --> 30:45.040
 that. It turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years

30:45.040 --> 30:48.240
 from the time when I thought it was 500 years.

30:48.240 --> 30:55.120
 So if we may, can we jump around quantum gravity, some basic ideas in physics?

30:55.120 --> 30:59.120
 What is the dream of string theory, mathematically?

30:59.120 --> 31:03.360
 What is the hope? Where does it come from? What problem is it trying to solve?

31:03.360 --> 31:06.560
 I don't think the dream of string theory is any different than the dream of

31:06.560 --> 31:10.880
 fundamental theoretical physics altogether. Understanding a unified

31:10.880 --> 31:14.960
 theory of everything. I don't like thinking of string theory

31:14.960 --> 31:20.640
 as a subject unto itself with people called string theorists who are the

31:20.640 --> 31:24.000
 practitioners of this thing called string theory.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.160
 I much prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists

31:28.160 --> 31:31.920
 trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature,

31:31.920 --> 31:35.360
 in particular gravity, in particular gravity and its connection with quantum

31:35.360 --> 31:40.560
 mechanics, and who at the present time find

31:40.560 --> 31:45.360
 string theory a useful tool rather than saying there's a subject

31:45.360 --> 31:48.080
 called string theorist. I don't like being referred to as a string

31:48.080 --> 31:52.160
 theorist. Yes, but as a tool, is it useful to think

31:52.160 --> 31:55.920
 about our nature in multiple dimensions, the strings

31:55.920 --> 31:59.280
 vibrating? I believe it is useful. I'll tell you

31:59.280 --> 32:03.040
 what the main use of it has been up till now. Well, it has had a number of main

32:03.040 --> 32:06.160
 uses. Originally string theory was invented,

32:06.160 --> 32:09.440
 then I know there I was there. I was right at the spot where it was being

32:09.440 --> 32:15.360
 invented, literally, and it was being invented to

32:15.360 --> 32:19.040
 understand hadrons. Hadrons are subnuclear particles,

32:19.040 --> 32:26.960
 protons, neutrons, mesons, and at that time, the late 60s,

32:26.960 --> 32:30.800
 early 70s, it was clear from experiment that these particles

32:30.800 --> 32:35.200
 called hadrons could vibrate, could rotate,

32:35.200 --> 32:40.560
 could do all the things that a little closed string can do,

32:40.560 --> 32:47.200
 and it was and is a valid and correct theory of these

32:47.200 --> 32:53.760
 hadrons. It's been experimentally tested, and that is a done deal.

32:53.760 --> 32:58.000
 It had a second life as a theory of gravity, the same basic mathematics

32:58.000 --> 33:02.160
 except on a very, very much smaller distance scale.

33:02.160 --> 33:08.800
 The objects of gravitation are 19 orders of magnitude smaller than

33:08.800 --> 33:11.840
 a proton, but the same mathematics turned up.

33:11.840 --> 33:15.840
 The same mathematics turned up. What has been its value?

33:15.840 --> 33:20.640
 Its value is that it's mathematically rigorous in many ways

33:20.640 --> 33:27.360
 and enabled us to find mathematical structures which have

33:27.360 --> 33:31.760
 both quantum mechanics and gravity with rigor.

33:31.760 --> 33:36.000
 We can test out ideas. We can test out ideas. We can't test them in the

33:36.000 --> 33:39.280
 laboratory. They had 19 orders of magnitude too

33:39.280 --> 33:42.080
 small, the things that we're interested in, but we can test them out

33:42.080 --> 33:47.760
 mathematically and analyze their internal consistency.

33:47.760 --> 33:55.440
 By now, 40 years ago, 35 years ago, so forth, people very, very much

33:55.440 --> 33:59.120
 questioned the consistency between gravity and quantum mechanics.

33:59.120 --> 34:04.480
 Stephen Hawking was very famous for it, rightly so.

34:05.680 --> 34:10.400
 Now nobody questions that consistency anymore. They don't because we have

34:10.400 --> 34:15.360
 mathematically precise string theories which contain both

34:15.360 --> 34:18.880
 gravity and quantum mechanics in a consistent way.

34:18.880 --> 34:25.200
 So it's provided that certainty that quantum mechanics and gravity can

34:25.200 --> 34:28.240
 coexist. That's not a small thing. It's a very big thing.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.320
 It's a huge thing. Einstein will be proud.

34:30.320 --> 34:34.320
 Einstein, he might be appalled. I don't know. He didn't like quantum mechanics very much,

34:34.320 --> 34:37.600
 but he would certainly be struck by it. Yeah.

34:37.600 --> 34:43.040
 I think that may be at this time its biggest contribution to physics in

34:43.040 --> 34:47.040
 illustrating almost definitively that quantum mechanics and gravity are very

34:47.040 --> 34:50.880
 closely related and not inconsistent with each other.

34:50.880 --> 34:55.040
 Is there a possibility of something deeper, more profound,

34:55.040 --> 35:01.680
 that still is consistent with string theory but is deeper

35:01.680 --> 35:04.800
 that is to be found? Well, you could ask the same thing about quantum mechanics.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.680
 Is there something? Exactly.

35:05.680 --> 35:10.880
 Yeah. I think string theory is just an example of a quantum mechanical system

35:10.880 --> 35:16.480
 that contains both gravitation and quantum mechanics.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.600
 So is there something underlying quantum mechanics?

35:19.600 --> 35:21.520
 Perhaps something deterministic.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.800
 Perhaps something deterministic. My friend,

35:24.800 --> 35:29.520
 Ferrad Etouft, whose name you may know, he's a very famous physicist.

35:29.520 --> 35:33.680
 Dutch, not as famous as he should be, but...

35:33.680 --> 35:36.160
 Hard to spell his name. It's hard to say his name.

35:36.160 --> 35:39.280
 No, it's easy to spell his name. Apostrophe. He's the only person I know whose

35:39.280 --> 35:44.080
 name begins with a metastrophe. And he's one of my heroes in physics.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.440
 He's a little younger than me, but he's nevertheless one of my heroes.

35:47.440 --> 35:55.600
 Etouft believes that there is some sub structure to the world

35:55.600 --> 36:00.960
 which is classical in character, deterministic in character,

36:00.960 --> 36:05.200
 which somehow by some mechanism that he has a hard time

36:05.200 --> 36:10.400
 spelling out emerges as quantum mechanics.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.600
 I don't. The wave function is somehow emergent.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.640
 The wave function and not just the wave function, but the whole

36:16.640 --> 36:21.280
 mech and the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics, uncertainty,

36:21.280 --> 36:23.760
 entanglement, all these things are emergent.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.480
 So you think quantum mechanics is the bottom of the well?

36:26.480 --> 36:32.960
 Is the... Here I think is where you have to be humble.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.640
 Here's where humility comes. I don't think anybody should say anything is

36:36.640 --> 36:40.480
 the bottom of the well at this time. I think we...

36:40.480 --> 36:43.680
 I think we can reasonably say...

36:43.680 --> 36:47.120
 I can reasonably say when I look into the well,

36:47.120 --> 36:52.320
 I can't see past quantum mechanics. I don't see any reason for it to be

36:52.320 --> 36:57.520
 anything beyond quantum mechanics. I think Etouft has asked very

36:57.520 --> 37:01.840
 interesting and deep questions. I don't like his answers.

37:01.840 --> 37:06.480
 Well, again, let me ask, if we look at the deepest nature of reality

37:06.480 --> 37:14.400
 with whether it's deterministic or when observed as probabilistic,

37:14.400 --> 37:18.240
 what does that mean for our human level of ideas of free will?

37:18.240 --> 37:24.080
 Is there any connection whatsoever from this perception, perhaps illusion, of

37:24.080 --> 37:27.600
 free will that we have and the fundamental nature of reality?

37:27.600 --> 37:32.560
 The only thing I can say is I am puzzled by that as much as you are.

37:32.560 --> 37:37.680
 The illusion of it. The illusion of consciousness, the illusion of free will,

37:37.680 --> 37:43.360
 the illusion of self. Does that connect to...

37:43.360 --> 37:48.720
 How can a physical system do that? And I am as puzzled as anybody.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.600
 There's echoes of it in the observer effect.

37:51.600 --> 37:55.200
 Yeah. So do you understand what it means to be an observer?

37:55.200 --> 37:59.520
 I understand it at a technical level. An observer is a system with enough

37:59.520 --> 38:03.120
 degrees of freedom that it can record information and which can become

38:03.120 --> 38:08.240
 entangled with the thing that it's measuring. Entanglement is the key.

38:08.240 --> 38:12.000
 When a system which we call an apparatus or an observer,

38:12.000 --> 38:17.120
 same thing, interacts with the system that it's observing,

38:17.120 --> 38:21.360
 it doesn't just look at it, it becomes physically entangled with it.

38:21.360 --> 38:26.320
 And it's that entanglement which we call an observation or a measurement.

38:26.320 --> 38:32.400
 Now, does that satisfy me personally as an observer?

38:32.400 --> 38:36.560
 Yes or no. I find it very satisfying that we have a mathematical representation

38:36.560 --> 38:42.400
 of what it means to observe a system. You are observing stuff right now,

38:42.400 --> 38:46.160
 the conscious level. Right. Do you think there's echoes

38:46.160 --> 38:49.360
 of that kind of entanglement in our macro scale?

38:49.360 --> 38:53.600
 Yes, absolutely, for sure. We're entangled with it,

38:53.600 --> 38:56.640
 quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room.

38:56.640 --> 39:03.120
 If we weren't, then it would just, well, we wouldn't be observing it.

39:03.120 --> 39:10.160
 But on the other hand, you can ask, am I really comfortable with it?

39:10.160 --> 39:13.760
 And I'm uncomfortable with it in the same way that I can never get comfortable

39:13.760 --> 39:18.720
 with five dimensions. My brain isn't wired for it.

39:18.720 --> 39:22.480
 Are you comfortable with four dimensions? A little bit more,

39:22.480 --> 39:26.160
 because I can always imagine the fourth dimension is time.

39:26.160 --> 39:29.840
 So the arrow of time, are you comfortable with that arrow?

39:29.840 --> 39:34.880
 Do you think time is an emergent phenomena or is it fundamental to nature?

39:34.880 --> 39:40.160
 That is a big question in physics right now. All the physics that we do,

39:40.160 --> 39:46.480
 or at least at the people that I am comfortable talking to,

39:46.480 --> 39:51.920
 my friends, my friends. No, we all ask the same question that you just asked.

39:51.920 --> 39:56.320
 Space, we have a pretty good idea, is emergent and it emerges out of

39:56.320 --> 40:02.880
 entanglement and other things. Time always seems to be built into

40:02.880 --> 40:06.560
 our equations as just what Newton pretty much would have thought.

40:06.560 --> 40:11.920
 Newton modified a little bit by Einstein, would have called time.

40:11.920 --> 40:19.120
 And mostly in our equations, it is not emergent.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.000
 Time in physics is completely symmetric forward and back.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.160
 Symmetric. So you don't really need to think about

40:26.160 --> 40:29.920
 the arrow of time for most physical phenomena.

40:29.920 --> 40:35.120
 For most microscopic phenomena, no. It's only when the phenomena involves

40:35.120 --> 40:38.800
 systems which are big enough for thermodynamics to become important,

40:38.800 --> 40:43.760
 for entropy to become important. For a small system,

40:43.760 --> 40:47.520
 entropy is not a good concept.

40:48.080 --> 40:52.720
 Entropy is something which emerges out of large numbers.

40:52.720 --> 40:56.480
 It's a probabilistic idea, it's a statistical idea,

40:56.480 --> 41:00.880
 and it's a thermodynamic idea. Thermodynamics requires lots and lots and

41:00.880 --> 41:07.600
 lots of little substructures. So it's not until you emerge

41:07.600 --> 41:11.600
 at the thermodynamic level that there's an arrow of time,

41:11.600 --> 41:16.320
 do we understand it? Yeah, I think we understand better than most people

41:16.320 --> 41:19.200
 think they are. Most people say they think we understand it.

41:19.200 --> 41:23.360
 Yeah, I think we understand it. It's a statistical idea.

41:23.360 --> 41:27.120
 You mean like second law, thermodynamics, entropy and so on?

41:27.120 --> 41:30.560
 Yeah, you take a pack of cards and you fling it in the air and you look what

41:30.560 --> 41:34.320
 happens to it. It gets random. It doesn't go from

41:34.320 --> 41:38.560
 random to simple. It goes from simple to random.

41:38.560 --> 41:42.720
 But do you think it ever breaks down? What I think

41:42.720 --> 41:48.240
 you can do is in a laboratory setting, you can take a system which is somewhere

41:48.240 --> 41:53.040
 intermediate between being small and being large

41:53.040 --> 41:58.320
 and make it go backward. A thing which looks like it

41:58.320 --> 42:02.000
 only wants to go forward because of statistical mechanical reasons, because of

42:02.000 --> 42:07.040
 the second law, you can very very carefully manipulate it

42:07.040 --> 42:10.560
 to make it run backward. I don't think you can take an egg

42:10.560 --> 42:14.880
 Humpty Dumpty who fell on the floor and reverse that,

42:14.880 --> 42:20.240
 but you can in a very controlled situation, you can take systems

42:20.240 --> 42:25.440
 which appear to be evolving statistically toward randomness,

42:25.440 --> 42:29.200
 stop them, reverse them and make them go back.

42:29.200 --> 42:33.440
 What's the intuition behind that? How do we do that? How do we reverse it?

42:33.440 --> 42:37.360
 You're saying a closed system. Yeah, pretty much closed system.

42:37.360 --> 42:41.520
 Yes. Did you just say that time travel is possible?

42:41.520 --> 42:45.280
 No, I didn't say time travel is possible. I said you can make a system go

42:45.280 --> 42:48.160
 backward. In time. You can make it go back. You can

42:48.160 --> 42:51.520
 make it reverse its steps. You can make it reverse its trajectory.

42:51.520 --> 42:56.080
 Yeah. How do we do it? What's the intuition there? Is it just a

42:56.080 --> 43:00.000
 fluke thing that we can do at a small scale in

43:00.000 --> 43:03.040
 the lab that doesn't have... What I'm saying is you can do it on a little

43:03.040 --> 43:06.880
 bit better than a small scale. You can certainly do it

43:06.880 --> 43:12.640
 with a simple small system. Small systems don't have any sense of the

43:12.640 --> 43:17.520
 arrow of time atoms. Atoms are

43:17.520 --> 43:22.240
 no sense of an arrow of time. They're completely reversible.

43:22.240 --> 43:26.160
 It's only when you have... The second law of thermodynamics is the

43:26.160 --> 43:30.720
 law of large numbers. So you can break the law because it's not...

43:30.720 --> 43:34.960
 You can break it, but it's hard. It requires great

43:34.960 --> 43:38.960
 care. The bigger the system is, the more care and more

43:38.960 --> 43:43.760
 the harder it is. You have to overcome what's called chaos.

43:43.760 --> 43:48.880
 And that's hard. And it requires more and more precision. For 10 particles, you

43:48.880 --> 43:53.840
 might be able to do it with some effort.

43:53.840 --> 43:58.400
 For 100 particles, it's really hard. For a thousand or a million particles,

43:58.400 --> 44:01.280
 forget it. But not for any fundamental reason, just

44:01.280 --> 44:04.880
 because it's technologically too hard to make the system go

44:04.880 --> 44:07.360
 backward.

44:08.320 --> 44:13.760
 So no time travel for engineering reasons?

44:13.760 --> 44:19.120
 No. What is time travel? Time travel to the future?

44:19.120 --> 44:22.960
 That's easy. You just close your eyes, go to sleep, and you wake up in the

44:22.960 --> 44:27.280
 future. Good nap gets you there.

44:27.280 --> 44:32.240
 But in reversing the second law of thermodynamics,

44:32.240 --> 44:38.160
 going backward in time for anything that's human scale is a very difficult

44:38.160 --> 44:41.520
 engineering effort. I wouldn't call that time travel because

44:41.520 --> 44:45.920
 it gets too mixed up with what science fiction calls time travel.

44:45.920 --> 44:53.600
 This is just the ability to reverse a system. You take the system

44:53.600 --> 44:58.160
 and you reverse the direction of motion of every molecule in it.

44:58.160 --> 45:02.240
 You can do it with one molecule. If you find a particle moving in a

45:02.240 --> 45:06.560
 certain direction, let's not say a particle, a baseball,

45:06.560 --> 45:10.800
 you stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion

45:10.800 --> 45:14.480
 in principle. That's not too hard and it'll go back along its

45:14.480 --> 45:18.080
 trajectory in the backward direction. Just running the program backwards?

45:18.080 --> 45:22.320
 Running the program backward. If you have two baseballs colliding,

45:22.320 --> 45:26.320
 well you can do it but you have to be very very careful to get it just

45:26.320 --> 45:31.040
 right. If you have 10 baseballs, really really

45:31.040 --> 45:37.120
 better yet, 10 billiard balls on an idealized frictionless billiard

45:37.120 --> 45:41.680
 table. You start the balls all in a triangle

45:41.680 --> 45:45.040
 and you whack them. Depending on the game you're playing, you either whack them

45:45.040 --> 45:49.040
 or you're really careful but you whack them and they go flying

45:49.040 --> 45:54.560
 off in all possible directions. Try to reverse that.

45:54.560 --> 45:59.440
 Imagine trying to take every billiard ball stopping it dead at some

45:59.440 --> 46:04.080
 point and reversing its motion so it was going in the opposite direction.

46:04.080 --> 46:08.320
 If you did that with tremendous care, it would

46:08.320 --> 46:12.480
 reassemble itself back into the triangle. Okay,

46:12.480 --> 46:17.360
 that is a fact and you can probably do it with two billiard balls, maybe with

46:17.360 --> 46:21.760
 three billiard balls if you're really lucky. But what happens is as the system

46:21.760 --> 46:26.080
 gets more and more complicated, you have to be more and more precise

46:26.080 --> 46:30.880
 not to make the tiniest error because the tiniest errors will get magnified

46:30.880 --> 46:34.800
 and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal.

46:34.800 --> 46:38.480
 So yeah, but I wouldn't call that time travel.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.080
 Yeah, that's something else. But if you think of it,

46:42.080 --> 46:45.600
 it just made me think, if you think the unrolling

46:45.600 --> 46:52.800
 of state that's happening as a program, if we look at the world,

46:52.800 --> 46:56.320
 silly idea of looking at the world as a simulation,

46:56.320 --> 47:03.120
 as a computer, but it's not a computer, it's just a single program.

47:03.120 --> 47:08.320
 A question arises that might be useful, how hard is it

47:08.320 --> 47:13.760
 to have a computer that runs the universe? Okay, so

47:13.760 --> 47:20.640
 there are mathematical universes that we know about, one of them is called

47:20.640 --> 47:28.320
 anti decider space where we and its quantum mechanics.

47:28.320 --> 47:34.000
 I think we could simulate it in a quantum computer.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.200
 Classical computer, all you can do is solve its equations. You can't make it

47:37.200 --> 47:39.920
 work like the real system. If we could build a quantum

47:39.920 --> 47:43.360
 computer, a big enough one, a robust enough one,

47:43.360 --> 47:49.680
 we could probably simulate a universe,

47:49.680 --> 47:54.720
 a small version of an anti decider universe. Anti decider is a kind of a

47:54.720 --> 47:59.920
 cosmology. So I think we know how to do that.

47:59.920 --> 48:03.040
 The trouble is the universe that we live in is not

48:03.040 --> 48:07.120
 the anti decider geometry, it's the decider geometry,

48:07.120 --> 48:10.960
 and we don't really understand its quantum mechanics at all.

48:10.960 --> 48:14.080
 So at the present time, I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest idea how to

48:14.080 --> 48:17.760
 simulate a universe similar to our own.

48:17.760 --> 48:24.160
 Could we build in the laboratory a small version,

48:24.720 --> 48:30.320
 a quantum mechanical version, the collection of quantum computers entangled

48:30.320 --> 48:37.280
 and coupled together, which would reproduce the phenomena that go on

48:37.280 --> 48:43.040
 in the universe, even on a small scale. Yes, if it were anti decider space,

48:43.040 --> 48:47.600
 no, if it's the decider space. Can you slightly describe the decider space and

48:47.600 --> 48:49.680
 anti decider space? Yeah.

48:49.680 --> 48:54.240
 What are the geometric properties of? They differ by the sign of a single

48:54.240 --> 49:00.240
 constant called the cosmological constant. One of them

49:00.240 --> 49:04.720
 is negatively curved, the other is positively curved.

49:04.720 --> 49:08.160
 Anti decider space, which is the negatively curved one,

49:08.160 --> 49:14.480
 you can think of as an isolated system in a box with reflecting walls.

49:14.480 --> 49:18.320
 You could think of it as a system of quantum mechanical system,

49:18.320 --> 49:23.200
 isolated in an isolated environment. The decider space is the one we really

49:23.200 --> 49:26.800
 live in, and that's the one that's exponentially expanding.

49:26.800 --> 49:31.440
 Exponential expansion, dark energy, whatever we want to call it,

49:31.440 --> 49:35.760
 and we don't understand that mathematically.

49:35.760 --> 49:39.440
 Not everybody would agree with me, but I don't understand.

49:39.440 --> 49:44.640
 They definitely would agree with me that I don't understand it.

49:44.640 --> 49:48.400
 What about, is there an understanding of the birth,

49:48.400 --> 49:52.960
 the origin, the bang bang? No, no, no, no, there's theories.

49:52.960 --> 49:58.800
 There are theories. My favorite is the one called eternal inflation.

49:58.800 --> 50:02.480
 The infinity can be on both sides, on one of the sides, and none of the sides.

50:02.480 --> 50:07.760
 So what's eternal infinity? Okay.

50:09.440 --> 50:15.360
 Infinity on both sides. Oh boy. Yeah, yeah, that's...

50:15.360 --> 50:21.440
 Why is that your favorite? Because it's the most just mind blowing?

50:21.440 --> 50:26.080
 No, because we want a beginning. No, why do we want a beginning?

50:26.080 --> 50:30.240
 I practiced it was a beginning, of course, and practiced it was a

50:30.240 --> 50:34.080
 beginning, but could it have been

50:34.080 --> 50:41.200
 a random fluctuation in an otherwise infinite time? Maybe.

50:41.200 --> 50:45.680
 In any case, the eternal inflation theory,

50:45.680 --> 50:50.560
 I think, if correctly understood, would be infinite in both directions.

50:50.560 --> 50:53.920
 How do you think about infinity? Oh god.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.360
 So, okay, of course you can think about it mathematically.

50:57.360 --> 51:01.040
 I just finished this discussion with my friend Sergei Brin.

51:01.040 --> 51:04.640
 Yes. How do you think about infinity? I say, well, Sergei Brin is infinitely

51:04.640 --> 51:09.280
 rich. How do you test that hypothesis?

51:09.280 --> 51:15.280
 Okay, that's such a good line. Right.

51:15.280 --> 51:20.000
 Yeah, so there's really no way to visualize some of these things.

51:20.000 --> 51:26.240
 Yeah, this is a very good question. Does infinity have any place in

51:26.240 --> 51:31.600
 physics? Right. Right, and all I can say is very

51:31.600 --> 51:34.320
 good question.

51:35.680 --> 51:40.640
 So, what do you think of the recent first image of a black hole visualized from

51:40.640 --> 51:45.600
 the event horizon telescope? It's an incredible triumph of science.

51:45.600 --> 51:50.480
 In itself, the fact that there are black holes which collide is not a surprise,

51:50.480 --> 51:54.800
 and they seem to work exactly the way they're supposed to work.

51:54.800 --> 51:58.880
 Will we learn a great deal from it? I don't know. I can't.

51:58.880 --> 52:05.280
 We might, but the kind of things we'll learn won't really be about black holes.

52:05.280 --> 52:11.360
 Why there are black holes in nature of that particular mass scale and why

52:11.360 --> 52:15.040
 they're so common may tell us something about the

52:15.040 --> 52:18.240
 structure, evolution of structure in the universe.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.840
 But I don't think it's going to tell us anything new about black holes.

52:21.840 --> 52:25.840
 But it's a triumph in the sense that you go back a hundred years and it was a

52:25.840 --> 52:29.920
 continuous development, general relativity, the discovery of

52:29.920 --> 52:34.160
 black holes, LIGO, the incredible technology that

52:34.160 --> 52:37.120
 went into LIGO.

52:37.600 --> 52:45.360
 It is something that I never would have believed was going to happen

52:45.360 --> 52:51.840
 30, 40 years ago. And I think it's a magnificent structure, a

52:51.840 --> 52:57.200
 magnificent thing, this evolution of general

52:57.200 --> 53:03.200
 relativity, LIGO, high precision, ability to

53:03.200 --> 53:07.600
 measure things on a scale of 10 to the minus 21.

53:07.600 --> 53:11.120
 So yeah. So you're just astonishing though we

53:11.120 --> 53:17.040
 that this path took us to this picture. Is it different?

53:17.040 --> 53:21.280
 You've thought a lot about black holes. How did you visualize them

53:21.280 --> 53:25.520
 in your mind? And is the picture different than you

53:25.520 --> 53:29.680
 utilized it? No, it's simply confirmed.

53:29.680 --> 53:34.880
 It's a magnificent triumph to have confirmed a direct observation

53:34.880 --> 53:38.400
 that Einstein's theory of gravity at the level of

53:38.400 --> 53:42.240
 black hole collisions actually works

53:42.240 --> 53:46.640
 is awesome. It is really awesome. You know, I know some of the people who are

53:46.640 --> 53:49.840
 involved in that. They're just ordinary people.

53:49.840 --> 53:54.320
 And the idea that they could carry this out,

53:54.320 --> 53:59.200
 I'm shocked. Yeah, just these little homo sapiens.

53:59.200 --> 54:04.720
 Yeah, just these little monkeys got together and took a picture of

54:04.720 --> 54:09.360
 slightly advanced limers, I think. What kind of questions

54:09.360 --> 54:13.360
 can science not currently answer but you hope might be able to soon?

54:13.360 --> 54:17.040
 Well, you've already addressed them. What is consciousness, for example?

54:17.040 --> 54:20.160
 You think that's within the reach of science? I think it's

54:20.160 --> 54:23.600
 somewhat within the reach of science, but I think now I think it's in the hands

54:23.600 --> 54:27.040
 of the computer scientists and the neuroscientists.

54:27.040 --> 54:31.120
 Not a physicist. Perhaps at some point, but I think

54:31.120 --> 54:35.680
 physicists will try to simplify it down to something that they can use their

54:35.680 --> 54:41.680
 methods and maybe they're not appropriate. Maybe we simply need

54:41.680 --> 54:45.680
 to do more machine learning on bigger scales,

54:45.680 --> 54:50.320
 evolve machines. Machines not only that learn but evolve their own

54:50.320 --> 54:53.200
 architecture. As a process of learning, evolve an

54:53.200 --> 54:57.280
 architecture not under our control, only partially under our control, but under

54:57.280 --> 55:01.520
 the control of machine learning. I'll tell you another thing that I find

55:01.520 --> 55:05.200
 awesome. You know this Google Bing that they

55:05.200 --> 55:08.720
 taught computers how to play chess? Yeah, yeah. Okay.

55:08.720 --> 55:12.320
 They taught computers how to play chess, not by teaching them how to play chess,

55:12.320 --> 55:15.200
 but just having them play against each other. Against each other.

55:15.200 --> 55:18.640
 Self play. Against each other. This is a form of evolution.

55:18.640 --> 55:25.440
 These machines evolved. They evolved in intelligence.

55:25.440 --> 55:30.720
 They evolved in intelligence without anybody telling them how to do it.

55:30.720 --> 55:34.480
 They were not engineered. They just played against each other and got better

55:34.480 --> 55:38.720
 and better and better. That makes me think that

55:38.720 --> 55:45.280
 machines can evolve intelligence. What exact kind of intelligence? I

55:45.280 --> 55:48.560
 don't know. But in understanding that better and

55:48.560 --> 55:51.360
 better, maybe we'll get better clues as to what

55:51.360 --> 55:55.120
 goes on in our own intelligence. Well, life in intelligence is

55:55.120 --> 55:58.640
 last question. What kind of questions can science

55:58.640 --> 56:01.760
 not currently answer and may never be able to answer?

56:01.760 --> 56:04.240
 Yeah.

56:05.520 --> 56:09.120
 Is there intelligence out there that's underlies the whole thing?

56:09.120 --> 56:14.160
 You can call in with a G word if you want. I can say

56:14.160 --> 56:18.400
 are we a computer simulation with a purpose?

56:19.040 --> 56:23.840
 Is there an agent, an intelligent agent that underlies

56:23.840 --> 56:28.800
 or is responsible for the whole thing? Does that intelligent agent

56:28.800 --> 56:32.480
 satisfy the laws of physics? Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics?

56:32.480 --> 56:36.480
 Is it made of atoms and molecules? Yeah, there's a lot of questions.

56:36.480 --> 56:41.920
 And I don't see... It seems to me a real question.

56:41.920 --> 56:44.640
 It's an answerable question. Well, I don't know if it's answerable.

56:44.640 --> 56:49.200
 The questions have to be answerable to be real.

56:49.200 --> 56:53.120
 Some philosophers would say that a question is not a question

56:53.120 --> 56:57.600
 unless it's answerable. This question doesn't seem to me

56:57.600 --> 57:04.960
 answerable by any known method, but it seems to me real.

57:04.960 --> 57:08.560
 There's no better place to end. Leonard, thank you so much for talking today.

57:08.560 --> 57:24.000
 Okay, good.
