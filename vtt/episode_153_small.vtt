00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
 The following is a conversation with Dimitri Korkin,

00:02.880 --> 00:04.840
 his second time in the podcast.

00:04.840 --> 00:06.960
 He's a professor of bioinformatics

00:06.960 --> 00:09.720
 and computational biology at WPI,

00:09.720 --> 00:12.160
 where he specializes in bioinformatics

00:12.160 --> 00:15.080
 of complex disease, computational genomics,

00:15.080 --> 00:18.520
 systems biology, and biomedical data analytics.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.080
 He loves biology, he loves computing,

00:22.080 --> 00:26.140
 plus he is Russian and recites a poem in Russian

00:26.140 --> 00:27.760
 at the end of the podcast.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.120
 What else could you possibly ask for in this world?

00:31.120 --> 00:34.720

00:42.960 --> 00:46.400
 So the choice is browsing privacy, business success,

00:46.400 --> 00:49.240

00:56.480 --> 00:58.640
 As a side note, let me say that to me,

00:58.640 --> 01:00.440
 the scientists that did the best,

01:00.440 --> 01:04.040
 apolitical, impactful, brilliant work of 2020

01:04.040 --> 01:09.040
 are the biologists who study viruses without an agenda,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.840
 without much sleep, to be honest,

01:11.840 --> 01:14.520
 just a pure passion for scientific discovery

01:14.520 --> 01:18.440
 and exploration of the mysteries within viruses.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.400
 Viruses are both terrifying and beautiful,

01:21.400 --> 01:23.000
 terrifying because they can threaten

01:23.000 --> 01:25.160
 the fabric of human civilization,

01:25.160 --> 01:27.880
 both biological and psychological.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.480
 Beautiful because they give us insights

01:30.480 --> 01:32.960
 into the nature of life on Earth

01:32.960 --> 01:35.920
 and perhaps even extraterrestrial life

01:35.920 --> 01:38.000
 of the not so intelligent variety

01:38.000 --> 01:39.600
 that might meet us one day

01:39.600 --> 01:42.440
 as we explore the habitable planets and moons

01:42.440 --> 01:43.800
 in our universe.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.960
 And now here's my conversation with Dimitri Korkin.

01:57.960 --> 02:02.960
 It's often said that proteins and the amino acid residues

02:03.160 --> 02:06.440
 that make them up are the building blocks of life.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.040
 Do you think of proteins in this way

02:08.040 --> 02:11.200
 as the basic building blocks of life?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.240
 Yes and no.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.360
 So the proteins indeed is the basic unit,

02:16.360 --> 02:20.520
 biological unit that carries out

02:20.520 --> 02:22.880
 important function of the cell.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.800
 However, through studying the proteins

02:25.800 --> 02:29.360
 and comparing the proteins across different species,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.440
 across different kingdoms,

02:31.440 --> 02:34.680
 you realize that proteins are actually

02:34.680 --> 02:36.760
 much more complicated.

02:36.760 --> 02:41.760
 So they have so called modular complexity.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.320
 And so what I mean by that is an average protein

02:47.320 --> 02:52.320
 consists of several structural units.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.480
 So we call them protein domains.

02:57.480 --> 03:02.480
 And so you can imagine a protein as a string of beads

03:02.600 --> 03:04.880
 where each bead is a protein domain.

03:05.760 --> 03:10.240
 And in the past 20 years,

03:10.240 --> 03:13.600
 scientists have been studying the nature

03:13.600 --> 03:15.040
 of the protein domains.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.480
 Cause we realized that it's the unit.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.120
 Because if you look at the functions, right?

03:22.120 --> 03:25.920
 So many proteins have more than one function.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.440
 And those protein functions are often carried out

03:29.440 --> 03:31.560
 by those protein domains.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.560
 So we also see that in the evolution,

03:37.320 --> 03:40.160
 those proteins domains get shuffled.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.440
 So they act actually as a unit.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.280
 Also from the structural perspective, right?

03:45.280 --> 03:50.280
 So, you know, some people think of a protein

03:50.960 --> 03:55.320
 as a sort of a globular molecule.

03:55.320 --> 04:00.080
 But as a matter of fact is the globular part

04:00.080 --> 04:02.520
 of this protein is a protein domain.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.640
 So we often have this, you know,

04:05.640 --> 04:09.600
 again, the collection of this protein domains

04:09.600 --> 04:14.600
 align on a string as beads.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.880
 And the protein domains are made up of amino acid residues.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.720
 So we're talking.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.600
 So this is the basic,

04:20.600 --> 04:22.560
 so you're saying the protein domain

04:22.560 --> 04:25.600
 is the basic building block of the function

04:25.600 --> 04:28.280
 that we think about proteins doing.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.360
 So, of course, you can always talk about

04:30.360 --> 04:32.840
 different building blocks with turtles all the way down.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.840
 But there's a point where there is at the point

04:36.840 --> 04:40.680
 of the hierarchy where it's the most, the cleanest

04:40.680 --> 04:45.680
 element block based on which you can put them together

04:46.240 --> 04:49.200
 in different kinds of ways to form complex function.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.880
 And you're saying protein domains,

04:50.880 --> 04:55.160
 why is that not talked about as often in popular culture?

04:55.160 --> 04:58.240
 Well, you know, there are several perspectives on this.

04:59.280 --> 05:03.200
 And one, of course, is the historical perspective, right?

05:03.200 --> 05:07.800
 So historically, scientists have been able

05:07.800 --> 05:12.400
 to structurally resolved to obtain the 3D coordinates

05:12.400 --> 05:17.400
 of a protein for, you know, for smaller proteins.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.000
 And smaller proteins tend to be a single domain protein.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
 So we have a protein equal to a protein domain.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.360
 And so because of that, the initial suspicion was

05:27.360 --> 05:31.720
 that the proteins are, they have globular shapes

05:31.720 --> 05:36.720
 and the more of smaller proteins you obtain structurally,

05:36.840 --> 05:41.840
 the more you became convinced that that's the case.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.840
 And only later when we started having, you know,

05:47.920 --> 05:49.640
 alternative approaches.

05:49.640 --> 05:54.640
 So, you know, the traditional ones are Xray crystallography

05:55.920 --> 05:57.320
 and NMR spectroscopy.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.000
 So these are sort of the two main techniques

06:02.000 --> 06:04.440
 that give us the 3D coordinates.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.760
 But nowadays, there's huge breakthrough

06:07.760 --> 06:10.480
 in cryoelectron microscopy.

06:10.480 --> 06:15.480
 So the more advanced methods that allow us to, you know,

06:15.480 --> 06:19.640
 to get into the, you know, 3D shapes

06:19.640 --> 06:23.480
 of much larger molecules, molecular complexes,

06:23.480 --> 06:28.480
 just to give you one of the common examples for this year.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.040
 Right?

06:30.040 --> 06:32.760
 So the first experimental structure

06:32.760 --> 06:37.760
 of a SARS CoV2 protein was the cryoem structure

06:38.360 --> 06:40.160
 of the S protein.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.960
 So the spike protein.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.320
 And so it was solved very quickly.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.480
 And the reason for that is the advancement

06:49.480 --> 06:53.920
 of this technology is pretty spectacular.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.480
 How many domains is the, is it more than one domain?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.320
 Oh, yes.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.320
 Oh, yes, I mean, so it's a very complex structure.

07:01.320 --> 07:06.320
 And we, you know, on top of the complexity

07:06.480 --> 07:08.520
 of a single protein, right?

07:08.520 --> 07:13.520
 So this structure is actually, is a complex, is a trimer.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.640
 So it needs to form a trimer in order to function properly.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.760
 What's a complex?

07:18.760 --> 07:22.920
 So a complex is a glomeration of multiple proteins.

07:22.920 --> 07:27.920
 And so we can have the same protein copied

07:28.240 --> 07:32.120
 in multiple, you know, made up in multiple copies

07:32.120 --> 07:36.200
 and forming something that we called a Homo oligomer.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.160
 Homo means the same, right?

07:38.160 --> 07:42.840
 So, so in this case, so the spike protein is the,

07:42.840 --> 07:46.800
 is an example of a Homo tetramer, Homo trimer, sorry.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.040
 So means three copies of a three copies in order to.

07:50.040 --> 07:50.880
 Exactly.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.760
 We have these three chains,

07:52.760 --> 07:56.800
 the three molecular chains coupled together

07:56.800 --> 07:58.480
 and performing the function.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.360
 That's what, when you look at this protein from the top,

08:02.360 --> 08:04.560
 you see a perfect triangle.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.880
 So, but other, you know, so other complexes are made up

08:08.880 --> 08:12.840
 of, you know, different proteins.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.400
 Some of them are completely different.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.880
 Some of them are similar, the hemoglobin molecule, right?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.880
 So it's actually, it's a protein complex.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.760
 It's made of four basic subunits.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.040
 Two of them are identical to each other.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.800
 Two other are identical to each other,

08:30.800 --> 08:32.840
 but they are also similar to each other,

08:32.840 --> 08:36.960
 which sort of gives us some ideas about the evolution

08:36.960 --> 08:40.640
 of this, you know, of this molecule.

08:40.640 --> 08:44.000
 And perhaps one of the hypotheses that, you know,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.280
 in the past, it was just a Homo tetramer, right?

08:48.280 --> 08:53.120
 So four identical copies, and then it became, you know,

08:53.120 --> 08:58.120
 sort of modified, it became mutated over the time

08:58.520 --> 09:00.160
 and became more specialized.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.560
 Can we linger on the spike protein for a little bit?

09:02.560 --> 09:04.920
 Is there something interesting

09:04.920 --> 09:06.960
 or like beautifully you find about it?

09:06.960 --> 09:10.960
 I mean, first of all, it's an incredibly challenging protein.

09:10.960 --> 09:15.960
 And so we, as a part of our sort of research

09:16.120 --> 09:20.200
 to understand the structural basis of this virus

09:20.200 --> 09:22.760
 to sort of decode, structure decode

09:22.760 --> 09:27.560
 every single protein in its proteome,

09:27.560 --> 09:31.760
 which, you know, we've been working on the spike protein.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.440
 And one of the main challenges was that

09:34.440 --> 09:39.440
 cryoem data allows us to reconstruct

09:42.720 --> 09:44.640
 or to obtain the 3D coordinates

09:44.640 --> 09:48.040
 of roughly two thirds of the protein.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.960
 The rest of the one third of this protein,

09:51.960 --> 09:56.960
 it's a part that is buried into the membrane of the virus

09:58.400 --> 10:01.560
 and of the viral envelope.

10:01.560 --> 10:06.560
 And it also has a lot of unstable structures around it.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.640
 So it's chemically interacting somehow

10:08.640 --> 10:10.160
 with whatever the heck it's connecting?

10:10.160 --> 10:12.800
 Yeah, so people are still trying to understand.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.040
 So the nature of, and the role of this, you know,

10:17.040 --> 10:18.560
 of this one third,

10:18.560 --> 10:21.320
 because the top part, you know,

10:21.320 --> 10:26.320
 the primary function is to get attached to the, you know,

10:26.720 --> 10:29.560
 ACE2 receptor, human receptor.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.120
 There is also beautiful, you know,

10:33.120 --> 10:36.080
 mechanics of how this thing happens, right?

10:36.080 --> 10:38.720
 So because there are three different copies

10:38.720 --> 10:41.960
 of this chains, you know,

10:41.960 --> 10:44.840
 there are three different domains, right?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.080
 So we're talking about domains.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.240
 So this is the receptor binding domains, RBDs,

10:49.240 --> 10:51.680
 that gets untaggled

10:51.680 --> 10:56.680
 and get ready to get attached to the receptor.

10:56.680 --> 11:01.680
 And now they are not necessarily going in a sync mode.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.360
 As a matter of fact.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.640
 Say synchronous?

11:06.640 --> 11:07.800
 So, yes.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.000
 So, and this is where, you know,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.600
 another level of complexity comes into play

11:13.600 --> 11:17.120
 because right now what we see is,

11:17.120 --> 11:21.840
 we typically see just one of the arms going out

11:21.840 --> 11:24.400
 and getting ready to be attached

11:24.400 --> 11:27.560
 to the ACE2 receptors.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.360
 However, there was a recent mutation

11:30.360 --> 11:35.080
 that people studied in that spike protein

11:35.080 --> 11:39.720
 and a very recently,

11:39.720 --> 11:43.560
 a group from UMass Medical School

11:43.560 --> 11:45.280
 will happen to collaborate with groups.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.240
 So this is a group of Jeremy Luban

11:47.240 --> 11:50.640
 and a number of other faculty.

11:50.640 --> 11:55.640
 They actually solved the mutated structure of the spike

11:59.040 --> 12:01.640
 and they showed that actually,

12:01.640 --> 12:03.000
 because of these mutations,

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
 you have more than one arms opening up.

12:08.840 --> 12:13.840
 And so now, so the frequency of two arms going up

12:15.040 --> 12:18.120
 increase quite drastically.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.160
 How does that change the dynamics somehow?

12:21.160 --> 12:24.360
 It potentially can change the dynamics of,

12:24.360 --> 12:28.440
 because now you have two possible opportunities

12:28.440 --> 12:31.160
 to get attached to the ACE2 receptor.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.000
 It's a very complex molecular process,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.320
 mechanistic process.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.440
 But the first step of this process

12:37.440 --> 12:41.520
 is the attachment of this spike protein,

12:41.520 --> 12:46.520
 of the spike trimer to the human ACE2 receptor.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.960
 So this is a molecule that sits on the surface

12:49.960 --> 12:51.880
 of the human cell.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.400
 And that's essentially what triggers

12:55.400 --> 12:58.840
 the whole process of encapsulation.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.360
 If this was dating, this would be the first date.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.000
 So this is the...

13:03.000 --> 13:04.640
 In a way, yes.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.880
 So is it possible that the spike protein

13:07.880 --> 13:10.560
 just like floating about on its own

13:10.560 --> 13:14.600
 or does it need that interactability with the membrane?

13:14.600 --> 13:16.880
 Yeah, so it needs to be attached,

13:16.880 --> 13:19.000
 at least as far as I know.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.280
 But when you get this thing attached on the surface,

13:23.280 --> 13:25.120
 there is also a lot of dynamics

13:25.120 --> 13:28.160
 on how it sits on the surface.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.160
 So for example, there was a recent work in,

13:32.160 --> 13:35.760
 again, where people use the cryoelectron microscopy

13:35.760 --> 13:38.920
 to get the first glimpse of the overall structure.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.120
 It's a very low res,

13:40.120 --> 13:43.800
 but you still get some interesting details

13:43.800 --> 13:47.040
 about the surface, about what is happening inside

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
 because we have literally no clue

13:49.040 --> 13:54.040
 until recent work about how the capsid is organized.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.360
 What's the capsid?

13:55.360 --> 13:59.080
 So capsid is essentially the inner core

13:59.080 --> 14:04.080
 of the viral particle where there is the RNA of the virus

14:05.040 --> 14:09.120
 and it's protected by another protein and protein

14:10.280 --> 14:13.480
 that essentially acts as a shield.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.560
 But now we are learning more and more,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.640
 so it's actually, it's not just this shield,

14:18.640 --> 14:21.840
 it's potentially used for the stability

14:21.840 --> 14:25.080
 of the outer shell of the virus.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.880
 So it's pretty complicated.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.520
 And understanding all of this is really useful

14:30.520 --> 14:33.040
 for trying to figure out like developing a vaccine

14:33.040 --> 14:36.080
 or some kind of drug to attack any aspects of this, right?

14:36.080 --> 14:39.640
 So I mean, there are many different implications to that.

14:39.640 --> 14:44.600
 First of all, it's important to understand the virus itself.

14:44.600 --> 14:49.600
 So in order to understand how it acts,

14:51.600 --> 14:55.360
 what is the overall mechanistic process

14:55.360 --> 14:57.360
 of this virus replication

14:57.360 --> 15:00.600
 of this virus proliferation to the cell, right?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.640
 So that's one aspect.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.480
 The other aspect is designing new treatments.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.560
 So one of the possible treatments is, you know,

15:10.560 --> 15:12.480
 designing nanoparticles.

15:12.480 --> 15:17.200
 And so some nanoparticles that will resemble the viral shape

15:17.200 --> 15:19.520
 that would have the spike integrated

15:19.520 --> 15:23.680
 and essentially would act as a competitor to the real virus

15:23.680 --> 15:26.680
 by blocking the ACE2 receptors

15:26.680 --> 15:30.360
 and thus preventing the real virus entering the cell.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.920
 Now, there are also, you know,

15:33.920 --> 15:36.720
 there is a very interesting direction

15:36.720 --> 15:39.400
 in looking at the membrane,

15:39.400 --> 15:42.000
 at the envelope portion of the protein

15:42.000 --> 15:45.960
 and attacking its M protein.

15:45.960 --> 15:49.440
 So there are, you know, to give you, you know,

15:49.440 --> 15:51.200
 sort of a brief overview,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.320
 there are four structural proteins

15:53.320 --> 15:55.760
 that these are the proteins that made up

15:55.760 --> 15:59.320
 a structure of the virus.

15:59.320 --> 16:04.080
 So spike S protein that acts as a trimer.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.920
 So it needs three copies.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.800
 E envelope protein that acts as a pentamer.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.720
 So it needs five copies to act properly.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.920
 M is a membrane protein.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.680
 It forms dimers and actually it forms beautiful lattice.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.520
 And this is something that we've been studying

16:23.520 --> 16:25.680
 and we are seeing it in simulations.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.080
 It actually forms a very nice grid

16:28.080 --> 16:31.720
 or, you know, threads, you know,

16:31.720 --> 16:34.880
 of different dimers attached next to each other.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.240
 There's a bunch of copies of each other

16:36.240 --> 16:38.280
 and they naturally, when you have a bunch of copies

16:38.280 --> 16:40.240
 of each other, they form an interesting lattice.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.080
 Exactly.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.520
 And, you know, if you think about this, right?

16:43.520 --> 16:46.920
 So this complex, you know,

16:46.920 --> 16:51.120
 the viral shape needs to be organized somehow,

16:51.120 --> 16:53.520
 self organized somehow, right?

16:53.520 --> 16:57.920
 So, you know, if it was a completely random process,

16:57.920 --> 17:02.120
 you know, you probably wouldn't have the envelope shell

17:02.120 --> 17:03.720
 of the ellipsoid shape.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.880
 You know, you would have something, you know,

17:05.880 --> 17:07.640
 pre random, right shape.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.600
 So there is some, you know, regularity

17:10.600 --> 17:15.600
 and how this, you know, how this M dimers

17:16.720 --> 17:19.600
 get to attach to each other in a very specific,

17:19.600 --> 17:20.560
 directed way.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.080
 Is that understood at all?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.320
 It's not understood.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.440
 We are now, we've been working in the past six months

17:28.440 --> 17:29.880
 since, you know, we're met.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.160
 Actually, this is where we started working

17:32.160 --> 17:35.000
 on trying to understand the overall structure

17:35.000 --> 17:38.200
 of the envelope and the key components

17:38.200 --> 17:41.080
 that made up this, you know, structure.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.240
 Wait, does the envelope also have the lattice structure

17:43.240 --> 17:44.080
 or no?

17:44.080 --> 17:47.360
 So the envelope is essentially is the outer shell

17:47.360 --> 17:48.840
 of the viral particle.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.600
 The N, the nucleocapsid protein,

17:51.600 --> 17:54.000
 is something that is inside.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.840
 Got it.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.520
 But get that.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.520
 The N is likely to interact with M.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.480
 Does it go M and E?

18:01.480 --> 18:02.640
 Like where's the E and the N?

18:02.640 --> 18:05.640
 So E, those different proteins,

18:05.640 --> 18:10.640
 they occur in different copies on the viral particle.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.960
 So E, this pentamer complex,

18:13.960 --> 18:18.520
 we only have two or three maybe per each particle.

18:18.520 --> 18:23.520
 Okay, we have 1,000 or so of M dimers

18:24.520 --> 18:29.520
 that essentially makes up the entire outer shell.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.680
 So most of the outer shell is the M.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.640
 M dimer and the M protein.

18:35.640 --> 18:39.120
 When you say particle, that's the viral on the virus,

18:39.120 --> 18:40.280
 the individual virus.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.120
 It's a single, yes.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.640
 Single element of the virus, single virus.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.080
 Single virus, right.

18:45.080 --> 18:50.080
 And we have about, you know, roughly 50 to 90 spike trimmers.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.000
 Right, so when you show a...

18:54.000 --> 18:55.080
 Per virus particle.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.560
 Per virus particle.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.640
 So what did you say, 50 to 90?

18:58.640 --> 19:00.680
 50 to 90, right.

19:00.680 --> 19:04.000
 So this is how this thing is organized.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.360
 And so now, typically, right,

19:06.360 --> 19:11.360
 so you see the antibodies that target spike protein,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.200
 you know, spike protein,

19:13.200 --> 19:15.120
 certain parts of the spike protein,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.920
 but there could be some, also some treatments, right?

19:17.920 --> 19:21.960
 So these are, you know, these are small molecules

19:21.960 --> 19:26.960
 that bind strategic parts of these proteins

19:27.480 --> 19:29.640
 disrupting its function.

19:29.640 --> 19:34.000
 So one of the promising directions,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.560
 it's one of the newest directions,

19:35.560 --> 19:40.560
 is actually targeting the M dimer of the protein.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.120
 Targeting the proteins that make up this outer shell.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.640
 Because if you're able to destroy the outer shell,

19:47.640 --> 19:52.160
 you're essentially destroying the viral particle itself.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.680
 So preventing it from, you know, function at all.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.000
 So that's, you think,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.440
 is from a sort of cybersecurity perspective,

20:01.440 --> 20:02.920
 virus security perspective,

20:02.920 --> 20:05.720
 that's the best attack vector is,

20:05.720 --> 20:08.440
 or like that's a promising attack vector.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.280
 I would say yes.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.680
 So I mean, there's still tons of research needs to be,

20:12.680 --> 20:13.960
 you know, to be done.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.560
 But yes, I think, you know, so.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.840
 There's more attack surface, I guess.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.840
 More attack surface,

20:19.840 --> 20:22.240
 but you know, from our analysis,

20:22.240 --> 20:24.160
 from other evolution analysis,

20:24.160 --> 20:27.960
 this protein is evolutionary more stable

20:27.960 --> 20:31.480
 compared to the spike protein.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.480
 Stable means a more static target.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.360
 Well, yeah, so it doesn't change.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.120
 It doesn't evolve from the evolutionary perspective

20:42.120 --> 20:46.000
 so drastically as, for example, the spike protein.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.960
 There's a bunch of stuff in the news

20:47.960 --> 20:51.440
 about mutations of the virus in the United Kingdom.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.160
 I also saw in South Africa something,

20:54.160 --> 20:55.480
 maybe that was yesterday.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.200
 You just kind of mentioned about stability and so on.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.800
 Which aspects of this are mutatable

21:02.800 --> 21:07.600
 and which aspects, if mutated, become more dangerous.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.280
 And maybe even zooming out,

21:09.280 --> 21:12.080
 what are your thoughts and knowledge and ideas

21:12.080 --> 21:13.680
 about the way it's mutated,

21:13.680 --> 21:15.400
 all the news that we've been hearing.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.520
 Are you worried about it from a biological perspective?

21:18.520 --> 21:21.320
 Are you worried about it from a human perspective?

21:21.320 --> 21:26.320
 So I mean, you know, mutations are sort of a general way

21:26.320 --> 21:28.640
 for these viruses to evolve, right?

21:28.640 --> 21:32.680
 So it's, you know, it's essentially,

21:32.680 --> 21:34.760
 this is the way they evolve.

21:34.760 --> 21:39.760
 This is the way they were able to jump from, you know,

21:39.960 --> 21:42.080
 one species to another.

21:42.080 --> 21:46.800
 We also see, you know, some recent jumps.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.000
 There were some incidents of this virus jumping

21:50.000 --> 21:51.880
 from human to dogs.

21:51.880 --> 21:55.880
 So, you know, there is some danger in those jumps

21:55.880 --> 21:59.520
 because, you know, every time it jumps, it also mutates, right?

21:59.520 --> 22:04.400
 So it, when it jumps to the species

22:04.400 --> 22:06.160
 and jumps back, right?

22:06.160 --> 22:11.160
 So it acquires some mutations that are sort of driven

22:12.240 --> 22:16.360
 by the environment of a new host, right?

22:16.360 --> 22:19.280
 And it's different from the human environment.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.440
 And so we don't know whether the mutations

22:21.440 --> 22:26.200
 that are acquired in the new species are neutral

22:26.200 --> 22:28.120
 with respect to the human host

22:28.120 --> 22:32.080
 or maybe, you know, maybe damaging.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.520
 Yeah, change is always scary, but so are you worried about,

22:36.520 --> 22:39.720
 I mean, it seems like because the spread is during winter,

22:39.720 --> 22:42.280
 now it seems to be exceptionally high.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.760
 And especially with a vaccine just around the corner,

22:46.760 --> 22:49.160
 already being actually deployed,

22:49.160 --> 22:51.320
 there's some worry that there's,

22:51.320 --> 22:53.000
 this puts evolutionary pressure,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.600
 selective pressure on the virus,

22:55.600 --> 22:59.000
 afford to, to mute, for you to mutate.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.400
 Is that a source of worry?

23:00.400 --> 23:03.400
 Well, I mean, there is always this thought, you know,

23:03.400 --> 23:07.080
 in the scientist's mind, you know, what happened,

23:07.080 --> 23:08.680
 what will happen, right?

23:08.680 --> 23:13.680
 So I know there've been discussions about sort

23:13.680 --> 23:16.760
 of the arms race between the, you know,

23:16.760 --> 23:21.760
 the ability of the humanity to, you know,

23:23.320 --> 23:27.040
 to get vaccinated faster than the virus,

23:27.040 --> 23:32.040
 you know, essentially, you know, becomes, you know,

23:32.120 --> 23:33.880
 resistant to the vaccine.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.600
 I, I mean, I don't worry that much,

23:41.760 --> 23:46.200
 simply because, you know, there is not that much evidence

23:46.200 --> 23:50.040
 to that, to aggressive mutation around the vaccine.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.560
 Exactly, you know, obviously there are mutations

23:52.560 --> 23:54.920
 around the vaccine, you know, there are vaccines.

23:54.920 --> 23:59.920
 So the reason we get vaccinated every year

24:00.000 --> 24:02.560
 against the season of the mutations, right?

24:03.920 --> 24:07.800
 But, you know, I think it's important to study it.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.720
 No doubts, right?

24:09.720 --> 24:12.640
 So, so I think one of the, you know, to me,

24:12.640 --> 24:16.040
 and again, I might be biased because, you know,

24:16.040 --> 24:20.080
 we've been trying to do that as well.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.920
 So, but one of the critical directions

24:22.920 --> 24:26.560
 in understanding the virus is to understand its evolution

24:26.560 --> 24:30.200
 in order to sort of understand the mechanisms,

24:30.200 --> 24:33.640
 the key mechanisms that lead the virus to jump,

24:33.640 --> 24:36.960
 you know, the Nordic viruses to jump from species,

24:36.960 --> 24:38.640
 from species to another,

24:38.640 --> 24:41.680
 that the mechanisms that lead the virus

24:41.680 --> 24:46.680
 to become resistant to vaccines also to treatments, right?

24:47.680 --> 24:51.480
 And hopefully that knowledge will enable us

24:51.480 --> 24:55.480
 to sort of forecast the evolutionary traces,

24:55.480 --> 24:58.080
 the future evolutionary traces of this virus.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.920
 I mean, what, from a biological perspective,

25:00.920 --> 25:02.120
 this might be a dumb question,

25:02.120 --> 25:07.120
 but is there parts of the virus that if souped up

25:07.880 --> 25:11.720
 like through mutation could make it more effective

25:11.720 --> 25:12.560
 at doing its job?

25:12.560 --> 25:15.640
 We're talking about the specific coronavirus, like,

25:15.640 --> 25:16.840
 because we were talking about the different,

25:16.840 --> 25:20.880
 like the membrane, the end protein, the E protein,

25:20.880 --> 25:25.520
 the N and the S, the spike.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
 Is there some?

25:26.520 --> 25:30.280
 And there are 20 or so more in addition to that.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.320
 But is that a dumb way to look at it?

25:32.320 --> 25:37.000
 Like, which of these, if mutated,

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
 could have the greatest impact, potentially damaging impact

25:42.000 --> 25:43.480
 on the effectiveness of the virus?

25:43.480 --> 25:46.560
 So, it's actually, it's a very good question

25:46.560 --> 25:50.120
 because, and the short answer is we don't know yet,

25:50.120 --> 25:53.480
 but of course there is capacity of this virus

25:53.480 --> 25:55.560
 to become more efficient.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.720
 The reason for that is, you know,

25:58.720 --> 26:01.800
 so if you look at the virus, I mean, it's a machine, right?

26:01.800 --> 26:05.520
 So it's a machine that does a lot of different functions.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.480
 And many of these functions are sort of nearly perfect,

26:08.480 --> 26:09.800
 but they're not perfect.

26:09.800 --> 26:14.120
 And those mutations can make those functions more perfect.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.240
 For example, the attachment to ACE2 receptor, right,

26:18.240 --> 26:19.400
 of the spike, right?

26:19.400 --> 26:24.400
 So, you know, has this virus reached the efficiency

26:28.360 --> 26:31.560
 in which the attachment is carried out?

26:31.560 --> 26:36.080
 Or there are some mutations that still to be discovered,

26:36.080 --> 26:41.080
 right, that will make this attachment sort of stronger,

26:41.920 --> 26:46.920
 or, you know, something in a way more efficient

26:46.920 --> 26:50.600
 from the point of view of this virus functioning.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.440
 That's sort of the obvious example,

26:53.440 --> 26:56.040
 but if you look at each of these proteins,

26:56.040 --> 26:59.360
 I mean, it's there for a reason, it performs certain function.

26:59.360 --> 27:04.360
 And it could be that certain mutations will,

27:05.520 --> 27:07.160
 you know, enhance this function.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.160
 It could be that some mutations will make this function

27:10.160 --> 27:12.280
 much less efficient, right?

27:12.280 --> 27:14.360
 So that's also the case.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.200
 Let's, since we're talking about the evolution

27:17.200 --> 27:21.200
 in the history of a virus, let's zoom back out

27:21.200 --> 27:23.800
 and look at the evolution of proteins.

27:23.800 --> 27:28.800
 I glanced at this 2010 Nature paper on the quote,

27:29.720 --> 27:32.920
 ongoing expansion of the protein universe.

27:32.920 --> 27:37.920
 And then, you know, it kind of implies and talks about

27:38.200 --> 27:41.160
 that proteins started with a common ancestor,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.240
 which is kind of interesting.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.440
 It's interesting to think about like even just like

27:45.440 --> 27:50.440
 the first organic thing that started life on Earth.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.280
 And from that, there's now, you know,

27:54.280 --> 27:56.800
 what is it, 3.5 billion years later,

27:56.800 --> 28:00.080
 there's now millions of proteins and they're still evolving.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.360
 And that's, you know, in part, one of the things

28:02.360 --> 28:05.160
 that you're researching, is there something interesting

28:05.160 --> 28:08.760
 to you about the evolution of proteins

28:08.760 --> 28:13.760
 from this initial ancestor to today?

28:14.640 --> 28:16.320
 Is there something beautiful and insightful

28:16.320 --> 28:18.160
 about this long story?

28:18.160 --> 28:23.160
 So I think, you know, if I were to pick a single keyword

28:24.120 --> 28:29.120
 about protein evolution, I would pick modularity,

28:29.360 --> 28:32.920
 something that we talked about in the beginning.

28:32.920 --> 28:37.920
 And that's the fact that the proteins are no longer considered

28:37.920 --> 28:41.360
 as, you know, as a sequence of letters.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.960
 There are hierarchical complexities

28:45.960 --> 28:48.320
 in the way these proteins are organized.

28:48.320 --> 28:52.800
 And these complexities are actually going beyond

28:52.800 --> 28:54.000
 the protein sequence.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.800
 It's actually going all the way back to the gene,

28:57.800 --> 29:00.040
 to the nucleotide sequence.

29:00.040 --> 29:04.880
 And so, you know, again, these protein domains,

29:04.880 --> 29:07.960
 they are not only functional building blocks,

29:07.960 --> 29:10.040
 they are also evolutionary building blocks.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.680
 And so what we see in the sort of,

29:12.680 --> 29:15.200
 in the later stages of evolution,

29:15.200 --> 29:18.800
 I mean, once this stable, structurally,

29:18.800 --> 29:22.120
 and functionally building blocks were discovered,

29:22.120 --> 29:27.120
 they essentially stay, those domains stay as such.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.640
 So that's why if you start comparing different proteins,

29:31.640 --> 29:36.640
 you will see that many of them will have similar fragments.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.680
 And those fragments will correspond to something

29:39.680 --> 29:42.280
 that we call protein domain families.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.040
 And so, they are still different

29:44.040 --> 29:48.000
 because you still have mutations and, you know,

29:48.000 --> 29:52.840
 the, you know, different mutations are attributed

29:52.840 --> 29:56.200
 to, you know, diversification of the function

29:56.200 --> 29:58.880
 of this, you know, protein domain.

29:58.880 --> 30:03.560
 However, you don't, you very rarely see, you know,

30:03.560 --> 30:08.560
 the evolutionary events that would split this domain

30:08.640 --> 30:11.960
 into fragments because, and it's, you know,

30:13.040 --> 30:17.240
 once you have the domain split,

30:17.240 --> 30:22.240
 you actually, you know, you can completely cancel

30:22.520 --> 30:26.440
 out its function, or at the very least, you can reduce it.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.600
 And that's not, you know, efficient from the point of view

30:29.600 --> 30:32.840
 of the, you know, of the cell function.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.840
 So the protein domain level is a very important one.

30:39.120 --> 30:42.000
 Now, on top of that, right?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.080
 So if you look at the proteins, right?

30:44.080 --> 30:46.320
 So you have this structural units

30:46.320 --> 30:48.160
 and they carry out the function.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.840
 But then much less is known about things

30:51.840 --> 30:54.360
 that connect this protein domains.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.480
 Something that we call linkers, and those linkers

30:57.480 --> 31:02.320
 are completely flexible, you know, parts of the protein

31:02.320 --> 31:06.360
 that nevertheless carry out a lot of function.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.040
 It's like little tails or heads.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.800
 So, so, so we do have tails.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.280
 So they call termini, C and N termini.

31:12.280 --> 31:17.280
 So these are things right on the, on one and another ends

31:18.320 --> 31:20.040
 of the protein sequence.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.560
 So they are also very important.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.360
 So they attribute it to very specific interactions

31:26.360 --> 31:27.760
 between the proteins.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.600
 So.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.840
 But you're referring to the links between domains

31:30.840 --> 31:32.640
 that connect the domains.

31:32.640 --> 31:37.640
 And, you know, apart from the, just the simple perspective,

31:38.480 --> 31:41.240
 if you have, you know, a very short domain,

31:41.240 --> 31:43.760
 you have, sorry, a very short linker,

31:43.760 --> 31:45.880
 you have two domains next to each other.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.600
 They are forced to be next to each other.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.440
 If you have a very long one, you have the domains

31:50.440 --> 31:53.160
 that are extremely flexible and they carry out

31:53.160 --> 31:56.920
 a lot of sort of spatial reorganization, right?

31:56.920 --> 31:58.160
 That's so awesome.

31:58.160 --> 32:02.000
 But on top of that, right, just this linker itself,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.800
 because it's so flexible, it actually can adapt

32:05.800 --> 32:07.520
 to a lot of different shapes.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.120
 And therefore, it's a very good interactor

32:11.120 --> 32:14.040
 when it comes to interaction between this protein

32:14.040 --> 32:15.720
 and other protein, right?

32:15.720 --> 32:18.960
 So these things also evolve, you know,

32:18.960 --> 32:23.960
 and they, in a way, have different sort of laws of,

32:25.560 --> 32:30.560
 the driving laws that underlie the evolution

32:30.600 --> 32:34.560
 because they no longer need to preserve

32:34.560 --> 32:38.920
 certain structure, right, unlike protein domains.

32:38.920 --> 32:43.360
 And so on top of that, you have something

32:43.360 --> 32:45.880
 that is even less studied.

32:45.880 --> 32:50.480
 And this is something that attribute to the concept

32:50.480 --> 32:53.240
 of alternative splicing.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.480
 So alternative splicing.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.400
 So it's a very cool concept, it's something

32:57.400 --> 33:02.400
 that we've been fascinated about for over a decade

33:02.800 --> 33:05.520
 in my lab and trying to do research with that.

33:05.520 --> 33:10.520
 But so typically, a simplistic perspective

33:10.520 --> 33:15.520
 is that one gene is equal one protein product, right?

33:16.080 --> 33:19.800
 So you have a gene, you know, you transcribe it

33:19.800 --> 33:22.920
 and translate it and it becomes a protein.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.400
 In reality, when we talk about eukaryotes,

33:28.400 --> 33:32.360
 especially sort of more recent eukaryotes

33:32.360 --> 33:37.360
 that are very complex, the gene is no longer equal

33:37.360 --> 33:42.360
 to one protein, it actually can produce multiple

33:46.200 --> 33:51.200
 functionally active protein products.

33:51.240 --> 33:56.240
 And each of them is called an alternatively spliced product.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.880
 The reason it happens is that if you look at the gene,

34:01.880 --> 34:05.600
 it actually has, it has also blocks.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.320
 And the blocks, some of which,

34:08.320 --> 34:10.680
 and it's essentially, it goes like this.

34:10.680 --> 34:13.880
 So we have a block that will later be translated,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.480
 we call it exon, then we'll have a block

34:16.480 --> 34:20.400
 that is not translated, cut out, we call it intron.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.560
 So we have exon, intron, exon, intron, et cetera, et cetera,

34:23.560 --> 34:24.400
 et cetera, right?

34:24.400 --> 34:26.920
 So sometimes you can have, you know,

34:26.920 --> 34:29.880
 dozens of these exons and introns.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.680
 So what happens is during the process

34:32.680 --> 34:35.800
 when the gene is converted to RNA,

34:37.320 --> 34:41.280
 we have things that are cut out,

34:41.280 --> 34:45.080
 the introns that cut out, and exons that now

34:45.080 --> 34:47.160
 get assembled together.

34:47.160 --> 34:51.420
 And sometimes we will throw out some of the exons.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.640
 And the remaining protein product will become

34:54.640 --> 34:56.800
 still be the same, different, right?

34:56.800 --> 35:00.000
 So now you have fragments of the protein

35:00.000 --> 35:01.360
 that no longer there.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.800
 They were cut out with the introns.

35:03.800 --> 35:07.520
 Sometimes you will essentially take one exon

35:07.520 --> 35:09.840
 and replace it with another one, right?

35:09.840 --> 35:12.600
 So there's some flexibility in this process.

35:12.600 --> 35:17.200
 So that creates a whole new level of complexity.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.040
 Cause now...

35:18.040 --> 35:18.880
 Is this random though?

35:18.880 --> 35:19.720
 Is it random?

35:19.720 --> 35:20.840
 It's not random.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.480
 We, and this is where I think now the appearance

35:24.480 --> 35:29.480
 of this modern single cell before that tissue level

35:29.480 --> 35:31.880
 sequencing, next generation sequencing technique,

35:31.880 --> 35:36.880
 such as RNA seed allows us to see that these are the events

35:37.200 --> 35:42.200
 that often happen in response in, it's a dynamic event

35:42.280 --> 35:45.960
 that happens in response to disease

35:45.960 --> 35:50.960
 or in response to certain developmental stage of a cell.

35:51.120 --> 35:55.960
 And this is an incredibly complex layer

35:55.960 --> 36:00.960
 that also undergoes, I mean, because it's at the gene level,

36:01.360 --> 36:02.200
 right?

36:02.200 --> 36:05.400
 So it undergoes certain evolution, right?

36:05.400 --> 36:10.400
 And now we have this interplay between what is happening

36:10.800 --> 36:14.080
 in the protein world and what is happening

36:14.080 --> 36:18.040
 in the gene and RNA world.

36:18.040 --> 36:23.040
 And for example, it's often that we see that

36:23.040 --> 36:28.040
 the boundaries of these exons coincide

36:28.200 --> 36:32.160
 with the boundaries of the protein domains, right?

36:32.160 --> 36:36.520
 So there is, you know, close interplay to that.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.960
 It's not always, I mean, you know,

36:37.960 --> 36:39.840
 otherwise it would be too simple, right?

36:39.840 --> 36:41.880
 But we do see the connection

36:41.880 --> 36:45.000
 between those sort of machineries.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.760
 And obviously the evolution will pick up this complexity

36:49.760 --> 36:53.520
 and, you know, select for whatever is successful,

36:53.520 --> 36:55.080
 whatever is interesting function.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.560
 We see that complexity in play

36:57.560 --> 37:01.200
 and makes this question, you know, more complex

37:01.200 --> 37:02.280
 but more exciting.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.240
 As a small detour, I don't know if you think about this

37:05.240 --> 37:07.560
 into the world of computer science.

37:07.560 --> 37:12.560
 There's a Douglas Hustader, I think came up with a name

37:12.920 --> 37:16.200
 of Quine, which are, I don't know if you're familiar

37:16.200 --> 37:18.880
 with these things, but it's computer programs

37:18.880 --> 37:22.160
 that have, I guess, exon and intron

37:22.160 --> 37:23.320
 and they copy it.

37:23.320 --> 37:26.240
 The whole purpose of the program is to copy itself.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.480
 So it prints copies of itself

37:28.480 --> 37:31.000
 but can also carry information inside of it.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.480
 So it's a very kind of crude, fun exercise of,

37:36.440 --> 37:39.880
 can we sort of replicate these ideas from cells?

37:39.880 --> 37:41.480
 Or can we have a computer program

37:41.480 --> 37:45.240
 that when you run it just prints itself,

37:45.240 --> 37:47.080
 the entirety of itself

37:47.080 --> 37:50.000
 and does it in different programming languages and so on.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.920
 I've been playing around and writing them.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.680
 It's a kind of fun little exercise.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.680
 You know, when I was a kid, so, you know,

37:55.680 --> 38:00.680
 it was essentially one of the sort of main stages

38:02.840 --> 38:06.760
 in Informatics Olympiad

38:06.760 --> 38:10.840
 that you have to reach in order to be any so good

38:10.840 --> 38:14.360
 is you should be able to write a program

38:14.360 --> 38:16.680
 that replicates itself.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.800
 And so the tags then becomes even, you know,

38:19.800 --> 38:20.920
 sort of more complicated.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.600
 So what is the shortest?

38:22.600 --> 38:24.040
 What is the shortest, yeah.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.400
 And of course, it's, you know,

38:25.400 --> 38:27.480
 it's a function of a programming language.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.280
 But yeah, I remember, you know,

38:29.280 --> 38:33.200
 long, long, long time ago when we tried to, you know,

38:33.200 --> 38:36.560
 to make it short and short and find the shortcuts.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.640
 There's actually on Stack Exchange,

38:38.640 --> 38:43.640
 there's an entire site called CodeGolf, I think,

38:44.120 --> 38:46.520
 where the entirety is just a competition.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.360
 People just come up with whatever task, I don't know,

38:50.360 --> 38:54.640
 like a write code that reports the weather today.

38:54.640 --> 38:58.640
 And the competition is about whatever programming language,

38:58.640 --> 39:00.400
 what is the shortest program?

39:00.400 --> 39:02.240
 And it makes you actually, people should check it out

39:02.240 --> 39:04.920
 because it makes you realize there's some weird

39:04.920 --> 39:07.160
 programming languages out there.

39:07.160 --> 39:11.720
 But, you know, just to dig on that a little deeper,

39:12.720 --> 39:16.080
 do you think, you know, in computer science,

39:16.080 --> 39:19.280
 you don't often think about programs.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.120
 There's like the machine learning world now

39:22.280 --> 39:26.280
 that's still kind of basic programs.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.600
 And then there's humans that replicate themselves, right?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.560
 And there's these mutations and so on.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.480
 Do you think we'll ever have a world

39:34.480 --> 39:38.600
 where there's programs that kind of have

39:38.600 --> 39:40.640
 an evolutionary process?

39:40.640 --> 39:42.640
 So I'm not talking about evolutionary algorithms,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.640
 but I'm talking about programs that kind of

39:44.640 --> 39:47.200
 mate with each other and evolve and,

39:47.200 --> 39:49.600
 like, on their own, replicate themselves.

39:49.600 --> 39:54.600
 So this is kind of, the idea here is, you know,

39:54.640 --> 39:57.120
 that's how you can have a runaway thing.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.240
 So we think about machine learning as a system

39:59.240 --> 40:01.440
 that gets smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.280
 At least the machine learning systems of today

40:04.280 --> 40:09.120
 are like, it's a program that you can, like, turn off.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.800
 As opposed to throwing a bunch of little programs out there

40:12.800 --> 40:15.720
 and letting them, like, multiply and mate

40:15.720 --> 40:17.480
 and evolve and replicate.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.560
 Do you ever think about that kind of world, you know,

40:20.560 --> 40:23.480
 when we jump from the biological systems

40:23.480 --> 40:27.280
 that you're looking at to artificial ones?

40:27.280 --> 40:31.920
 I mean, it's almost like you take the sort of

40:31.920 --> 40:34.480
 the area of intelligent agents, right?

40:34.480 --> 40:38.720
 Which are essentially the independent sort of codes

40:38.720 --> 40:42.560
 that run and interact and exchange the information, right?

40:42.560 --> 40:45.200
 So I don't see why not.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.840
 I mean, I, you know, it could be sort of a natural evolution

40:48.840 --> 40:53.000
 in this area of computer science.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.720
 I think it's kind of an interesting possibility.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.960
 It's terrifying, too.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.360
 But I think it's a really powerful tool.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.680
 Like, to have agents that, you know,

41:00.680 --> 41:02.800
 we have social networks with millions of people

41:02.800 --> 41:03.840
 and they interact.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.720
 I think it's interesting to inject into that.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.400
 It was already injected into that bot, right?

41:08.400 --> 41:10.040
 But those bots are pretty dumb.

41:10.040 --> 41:14.680
 You know, they're probably pretty dumb algorithms.

41:15.680 --> 41:18.640
 You know, it's interesting to think that there might be bots

41:18.640 --> 41:20.440
 that evolve together with humans.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.960
 And there's the sea of humans and robots

41:23.960 --> 41:26.520
 that are operating first in the digital space.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.080
 And then you can also think, I love the idea.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.600
 Some people worked, I think at Harvard, at Penn,

41:32.600 --> 41:36.760
 there's robotics labs that, you know,

41:36.760 --> 41:40.600
 take as a fundamental task to build a robot

41:40.600 --> 41:42.400
 that, given extra resources,

41:42.400 --> 41:44.920
 can build another copy of itself,

41:44.920 --> 41:46.560
 like in the physical space,

41:46.560 --> 41:49.400
 which is super difficult to do,

41:49.400 --> 41:50.920
 but super interesting.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.040
 I remember there's like research on robots

41:54.040 --> 41:55.240
 that can build a bridge.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.880
 So they make a copy of themselves

41:56.880 --> 41:57.960
 and they connect themselves.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.600
 And so it's like self building bridge

42:00.600 --> 42:02.400
 based on building blocks.

42:02.400 --> 42:05.640
 You can imagine like a building that self assembles.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.600
 So it's basically self assembling structures

42:07.600 --> 42:10.640
 from robotic parts,

42:10.640 --> 42:13.880
 but it's interesting to, within that robot,

42:13.880 --> 42:18.880
 add the ability to mutate and do all the interesting,

42:19.840 --> 42:23.200
 like little things that you're referring to in evolution

42:23.200 --> 42:26.320
 to go from a single origin protein building block

42:26.320 --> 42:29.000
 to like this weird complexity.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.960
 And if you think about this, I mean, you know,

42:30.960 --> 42:34.600
 the bits and pieces are there, you know?

42:34.600 --> 42:37.040
 So you mentioned the evolutionary algorithm, right?

42:37.040 --> 42:38.520
 You know, so this is sort of,

42:38.520 --> 42:43.520
 and maybe sort of the goal is in a way different, right?

42:44.800 --> 42:47.680
 So the goal is to, you know, to essentially,

42:47.680 --> 42:50.080
 to optimize your search, right?

42:50.080 --> 42:53.040
 So, but sort of the ideas are there.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.080
 So people recognize that, you know,

42:55.080 --> 42:59.120
 that the recombination events

42:59.120 --> 43:03.280
 lead to global changes in the search trajectories,

43:03.280 --> 43:08.280
 the mutations event is a more refined step in the search.

43:10.040 --> 43:12.200
 Then you have, you know,

43:12.200 --> 43:16.520
 other sort of nature inspired algorithm, right?

43:16.520 --> 43:19.600
 So it's one of the reasons that, you know,

43:19.600 --> 43:22.000
 I think it's one of the funnest one,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.880
 is the slime based algorithm, right?

43:24.880 --> 43:29.880
 So I think the first was introduced by the Japanese group

43:29.880 --> 43:34.720
 where it was able to solve some pre, you know,

43:34.720 --> 43:36.040
 complex problems.

43:36.920 --> 43:41.920
 So that's, you know, and then I think there are still

43:42.320 --> 43:46.520
 a lot of things we've yet to, you know,

43:46.520 --> 43:49.000
 borrow from the nature, right?

43:49.000 --> 43:53.080
 So there are a lot of sort of ideas that nature,

43:54.760 --> 43:56.800
 you know, gets to offer us that, you know,

43:56.800 --> 44:01.080
 it's up to us to grab it and to, you know,

44:01.080 --> 44:02.200
 get the best use of it.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.680
 Including neural networks.

44:03.680 --> 44:07.080
 You know, we have a very crude inspiration

44:07.080 --> 44:08.320
 from nature on neural networks.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.960
 Maybe there's other inspirations to be discovered

44:10.960 --> 44:15.960
 in the brain or other aspects of the various systems,

44:16.320 --> 44:20.200
 even like the immune system, the way it interplays.

44:20.200 --> 44:23.600
 I recently started to understand that the immune system

44:23.600 --> 44:26.080
 has something to do with the way the brain operates.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.400
 Like there's multiple things going on in there,

44:28.400 --> 44:30.560
 which all of which are not modeled

44:30.560 --> 44:32.160
 in artificial neural networks.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.000
 And maybe if you throw a little bit

44:34.000 --> 44:36.240
 of that biological spice in theirs,

44:36.240 --> 44:39.040
 you'll come up with something, something cool.

44:39.040 --> 44:42.680
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Drake equation.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.760
 That estimate, I just did a video on it yesterday

44:46.760 --> 44:49.320
 because I wanted to give my own estimate of it.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.400
 It's an equation that combines a bunch of factors

44:52.400 --> 44:55.840
 to estimate how many alien civilizations

44:55.840 --> 44:57.040
 are in the galaxy.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.520
 I've heard about it, yes.

44:58.520 --> 45:01.160
 So one of the interesting parameters,

45:01.160 --> 45:06.000
 you know, it's like how many stars are born every year,

45:06.000 --> 45:10.720
 how many planets are on average per star,

45:10.720 --> 45:14.280
 for this, how many habitable planets are there.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.600
 And then the one that starts being really interesting

45:18.600 --> 45:23.600
 is the probability that life emerges on a habitable planet.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.640
 So like, I don't know if you think about,

45:26.640 --> 45:28.560
 you certainly think a lot about evolution,

45:28.560 --> 45:30.000
 but do you think about the thing

45:30.000 --> 45:31.400
 which evolution doesn't describe,

45:31.400 --> 45:33.840
 which is like the beginning of evolution,

45:33.840 --> 45:35.520
 the origin of life.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.320
 I think I put the probability of life developing

45:38.320 --> 45:40.600
 a habitable planet at 1%.

45:40.600 --> 45:43.360
 This is very scientifically rigorous.

45:43.360 --> 45:47.360
 Okay, well, first at a high level for the Drake equation,

45:47.360 --> 45:50.560
 what would you put that percent that on Earth?

45:50.560 --> 45:53.800
 And in general, do you have something,

45:53.800 --> 45:57.240
 do you have thoughts about how life might have started?

45:57.240 --> 46:00.200
 You know, like the proteins being the first kind of,

46:00.200 --> 46:02.040
 one of the early jumping points?

46:02.040 --> 46:06.480
 Yes, also, I think back in 2018,

46:06.480 --> 46:09.480
 there was a very exciting paper published in Nature

46:09.480 --> 46:14.480
 where they found one of the simplest amino acids, glycine.

46:14.480 --> 46:19.080
 One of the simplest amino acids, glycine,

46:20.040 --> 46:23.520
 in a comet dust.

46:23.520 --> 46:28.520
 So this is, I apologize if I don't pronounce,

46:29.440 --> 46:32.080
 it's a Russian named Comets.

46:32.080 --> 46:34.840
 I think Chugryumov Gerasimenko.

46:34.840 --> 46:39.840
 This is the comet where, and there was this mission

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
 to get close to this comet

46:44.000 --> 46:48.160
 and get the stardust from its tail.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.640
 And when scientists analyzed it,

46:50.640 --> 46:55.640
 they actually found traces of glycine,

46:56.640 --> 47:01.640
 which makes up, it's one of the 20 basic amino acids

47:04.200 --> 47:06.400
 that makes up proteins, right?

47:06.400 --> 47:10.960
 So that was kind of very exciting, right?

47:10.960 --> 47:14.200
 But the question is very interesting, right?

47:14.200 --> 47:18.520
 So what, if there is some alien life,

47:19.880 --> 47:22.920
 is it gonna be made of proteins, right?

47:22.920 --> 47:24.320
 Or maybe RNAs, right?

47:24.320 --> 47:28.120
 So we see that the RNA viruses

47:28.120 --> 47:32.320
 are certainly very well established

47:32.320 --> 47:37.320
 sort of group of molecular machines, right?

47:37.320 --> 47:41.760
 So yes, it's a very interesting question.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.600
 What probability would you put?

47:43.600 --> 47:48.600
 Like, how unlikely just on earth do you think

47:48.760 --> 47:51.600
 this whole thing is that we got going?

47:51.600 --> 47:54.640
 Like, are we really lucky or is it inevitable?

47:54.640 --> 47:56.240
 Like, what's your sense when you sit back

47:56.240 --> 47:58.840
 and think about life on earth?

47:58.840 --> 48:01.000
 Is it higher or lower than 1%?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.320
 Well, because 1% is pretty low,

48:02.320 --> 48:05.040
 but it still is like, damn, that's a pretty good chance.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.600
 Yes, it's a pretty good chance.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.320
 I mean, I would personally, but again,

48:10.560 --> 48:14.160
 I'm probably not the best person

48:14.160 --> 48:16.640
 to do such estimations,

48:16.640 --> 48:21.640
 but intuitively, I would probably put it lower.

48:23.080 --> 48:24.960
 But still, I mean, you know, give up.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.560
 We're really lucky here on earth.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.480
 Or the conditions are really good.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.480
 I mean, I think that there was everything was right

48:34.480 --> 48:35.480
 in a way, right?

48:35.480 --> 48:39.720
 So we still, the conditions were not like ideal

48:39.720 --> 48:44.040
 if you try to look at what was, you know,

48:44.040 --> 48:48.320
 several billions years ago when the life emerged.

48:48.320 --> 48:52.040
 So there is something called the rare earth hypothesis

48:52.040 --> 48:55.720
 that, you know, in counter to the Drake equation says

48:55.720 --> 49:00.240
 that the, you know, the conditions of earth,

49:00.240 --> 49:03.280
 if you actually were to describe earth,

49:03.280 --> 49:05.720
 it's quite a special place.

49:05.720 --> 49:09.120
 So special, it might be unique in our galaxy

49:09.120 --> 49:11.760
 and potentially, you know, close to unique

49:11.760 --> 49:12.880
 in the entire universe.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.720
 Like it's very difficult to reconstruct

49:14.720 --> 49:16.320
 those same conditions.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.520
 And what the rare earth hypothesis argues

49:19.520 --> 49:23.040
 is all those different conditions are essential for life.

49:23.040 --> 49:26.120
 And so that's sort of the counter, you know,

49:26.120 --> 49:29.200
 like all the things we, you know,

49:29.200 --> 49:31.520
 thinking that earth is pretty average.

49:31.520 --> 49:34.080
 I mean, I can't really, I'm trying to remember

49:34.080 --> 49:36.160
 to go through all of them, but just the fact

49:36.160 --> 49:41.160
 that it is shielded from a lot of asteroids,

49:41.920 --> 49:43.840
 obviously the distance to the sun,

49:43.840 --> 49:48.280
 but also the fact that it's like a perfect balance

49:48.280 --> 49:52.200
 between the amount of water and land

49:52.200 --> 49:53.680
 and all those kinds of things.

49:53.680 --> 49:55.200
 I don't know, there's a bunch of different factors

49:55.200 --> 49:56.320
 that I don't remember.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.720
 There's a long list, but it's fascinating to think about

49:58.720 --> 50:03.640
 if in order for something like proteins

50:03.640 --> 50:06.600
 and then the DNA and RNA to merge,

50:06.600 --> 50:10.520
 you need, and basic living organisms,

50:10.520 --> 50:15.000
 you need to be a very close and earth like planet,

50:15.000 --> 50:18.760
 which would be sad or exciting.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
 I don't know.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.960
 If you ask me, I, you know,

50:21.960 --> 50:25.560
 in a way I put a parallel between, you know,

50:25.560 --> 50:30.200
 between our own research and, I mean,

50:30.200 --> 50:34.080
 from the intuitive perspective, you know,

50:34.080 --> 50:36.760
 you have those two extremes

50:36.760 --> 50:41.760
 and the reality is never very rarely falls into the extremes.

50:41.960 --> 50:45.240
 It's always the optimums always reached somewhere

50:45.240 --> 50:46.560
 in between.

50:46.560 --> 50:50.080
 So I would, and that's what I tend to think.

50:50.080 --> 50:54.080
 I think that, you know, we're probably somewhere in between.

50:54.080 --> 50:57.000
 So they were not unique, unique,

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
 but again, the chances are, you know, reasonably small.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.400
 The problem is we don't know the other extreme ways.

51:04.400 --> 51:08.080
 Like I tend to think that we don't actually understand

51:08.080 --> 51:12.920
 the basic mechanisms of like what this is all originated from.

51:12.920 --> 51:16.200
 Like it seems like we think of life as this distinct thing,

51:16.200 --> 51:18.560
 maybe intelligence is a distinct thing,

51:18.560 --> 51:23.160
 maybe the physics that from which planets and suns are born

51:23.160 --> 51:25.960
 is a distinct thing, but that could be a very,

51:25.960 --> 51:27.480
 it's like the Stephen Wolfram thing.

51:27.480 --> 51:29.120
 It's like the, from simple rules,

51:29.120 --> 51:31.040
 emerges greater and greater complexity.

51:31.040 --> 51:35.000
 So, you know, I tend to believe that just life finds a way.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.600
 It, like, we don't know the extreme of how common life is

51:39.600 --> 51:43.680
 because it could be life is like everywhere.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.440
 Like, like so everywhere that it's almost like laughable.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.520
 Like that we're such idiots to think,

51:51.520 --> 51:56.280
 or you, like it's like ridiculous to even like think.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.440
 It's like ants thinking that their little colony

51:59.440 --> 52:03.200
 is the unique thing and everything else doesn't exist.

52:03.200 --> 52:07.520
 I mean, it's also very possible that that's the extreme.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.880
 And we're just not able to maybe comprehend

52:09.880 --> 52:11.960
 the nature of that life.

52:11.960 --> 52:14.440
 I mean, just to stick on alien life

52:14.440 --> 52:16.240
 for just a brief moment more,

52:16.240 --> 52:21.240
 is there is some signs of life on Venus in gaseous form.

52:22.240 --> 52:27.240
 There's hope for life on Mars, probably extinct.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.840
 We're not talking about intelligent life.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.800
 Although that has been in the news recently.

52:33.800 --> 52:37.000
 We're talking about basic, like, you know, bacteria.

52:37.000 --> 52:37.840
 A lot of bacteria.

52:37.840 --> 52:38.680
 Yeah.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.200
 And then also, I guess, there's a couple moons that I guess.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.040
 Europe.

52:43.040 --> 52:46.040
 Yeah, Europa, which is Jupiter's moon.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.480
 I think there's another one.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.120
 Are you, is that exciting?

52:50.120 --> 52:53.040
 Or is it terrifying to you that we might find life?

52:53.040 --> 52:54.520
 Do you hope we find life?

52:54.520 --> 52:56.840
 I certainly do hope that we find life.

52:57.960 --> 53:02.760
 I mean, it was very exciting to hear about, you know,

53:02.760 --> 53:07.760
 this news about the possible life on Venus.

53:09.280 --> 53:12.560
 It's been nice to have hard evidence of something with,

53:12.560 --> 53:15.400
 which is what the hope is for Mars.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.440
 And Europa, but do you think those organisms

53:18.440 --> 53:20.800
 would be similar biologically?

53:20.800 --> 53:23.960
 Or would they even be sort of carbon based?

53:23.960 --> 53:25.760
 If we do find them?

53:25.760 --> 53:28.920
 I would say they would be carbon based.

53:28.920 --> 53:30.320
 How similar?

53:30.320 --> 53:31.840
 It's a big question, right?

53:31.840 --> 53:36.840
 So it's the moment we discover things outside Earth, right?

53:39.560 --> 53:42.400
 Even if it's a tiny little single cell.

53:42.400 --> 53:45.400
 I mean, there is so much.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.360
 Just imagine that.

53:46.360 --> 53:47.720
 That would be so.

53:47.720 --> 53:50.720
 I think that that would be another turning point

53:50.720 --> 53:52.040
 for the science, you know?

53:52.040 --> 53:54.160
 And if, especially if it's different

53:54.160 --> 53:57.040
 in some very new way, that's exciting.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.720
 Cause that says, that's a definitive state,

53:59.720 --> 54:01.800
 not a definitive, but a pretty strong statement

54:01.800 --> 54:05.440
 that life is everywhere in the universe.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.740
 To me, at least that's really exciting.

54:07.740 --> 54:11.540
 You brought up Joshua Letterberg

54:11.540 --> 54:13.500
 in an offline conversation.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.820
 I think I'd love to talk to you about AlphaFold.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.220
 And this might be an interesting way

54:17.220 --> 54:20.380
 to enter that conversation because,

54:20.380 --> 54:24.500
 so he won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine

54:24.500 --> 54:29.020
 for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes.

54:29.020 --> 54:32.220
 But he also did a ton of other stuff,

54:32.220 --> 54:37.220
 like we mentioned, helping NASA find life on Mars,

54:37.780 --> 54:42.780
 and Dendrol, the chemical expert system.

54:45.260 --> 54:46.900
 Expert systems, remember those?

54:47.900 --> 54:51.380
 Do you, what do you find interesting about this guy

54:51.380 --> 54:54.980
 and his ideas about artificial intelligence in general?

54:54.980 --> 54:59.980
 So I have a kind of personal story to share.

54:59.980 --> 55:04.980
 So I started my PhD in Canada back in 2000.

55:05.180 --> 55:07.780
 And so essentially my PhD was,

55:07.780 --> 55:10.140
 so we were developing sort of a new language

55:10.140 --> 55:12.580
 for symbolic machine learning.

55:12.580 --> 55:15.140
 So it's different from the feature based machine learning.

55:15.140 --> 55:19.860
 And one of the sort of cleanest applications

55:19.860 --> 55:24.020
 of this approach, of this formalism,

55:24.020 --> 55:28.660
 was two cheminformatics and computer aided drug design.

55:28.660 --> 55:32.740
 So essentially, as a part of my research,

55:33.820 --> 55:37.420
 I developed a system that essentially looked

55:37.420 --> 55:40.860
 at chemical compounds of, say,

55:40.860 --> 55:45.860
 the same therapeutic category, male hormones, right?

55:46.380 --> 55:51.380
 And tried to figure out the structural fragments

55:52.500 --> 55:55.180
 that are the structural building blocks

55:55.180 --> 55:58.860
 that are important that define this class

55:58.860 --> 56:00.500
 versus structural building blocks

56:00.500 --> 56:04.980
 that are there just because, to complete the structure.

56:04.980 --> 56:06.740
 But they are not essentially the ones

56:06.740 --> 56:08.820
 that make up the chemical,

56:08.820 --> 56:13.500
 the key chemical properties of this therapeutic category.

56:13.500 --> 56:17.540
 And for me, it was something new.

56:17.540 --> 56:20.660
 I was trained as an applied mathematician

56:20.660 --> 56:23.700
 as with some machine learning background,

56:23.700 --> 56:25.820
 but computer aided drug design

56:25.820 --> 56:28.380
 was completely new territory.

56:28.380 --> 56:32.620
 So because of that, I often find myself asking

56:32.620 --> 56:37.620
 lots of questions on one of these sort of central forums.

56:37.660 --> 56:41.060
 Back then, there were no Facebooks or stuff like that.

56:41.060 --> 56:42.380
 There was a forum.

56:42.380 --> 56:46.500
 It's a forum, it's essentially, it's like a bulletin board.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.100
 On the internet.

56:48.100 --> 56:50.980
 Yeah, so essentially you have a bunch of people

56:50.980 --> 56:52.460
 and you post the question

56:52.460 --> 56:55.860
 and you get an answer from different people.

56:55.860 --> 57:00.860
 And back then, one of the most popular forums was CCL.

57:01.300 --> 57:05.420
 Think Computational Chemistry Library,

57:05.420 --> 57:07.060
 not library, but something like that.

57:07.060 --> 57:09.820
 But CCL, that was the forum.

57:09.820 --> 57:14.020
 And there I asked a lot of dumb questions.

57:14.020 --> 57:15.460
 Yes, I asked questions.

57:15.460 --> 57:20.460
 I also shared some information about our formalism

57:20.460 --> 57:25.100
 and how we do and whether whatever we do makes sense.

57:25.100 --> 57:29.180
 And so, I remember that one of these posts,

57:29.180 --> 57:34.180
 I mean, I still remember I would call it desperately

57:34.900 --> 57:39.900
 looking for a chemist advice, something like that.

57:40.740 --> 57:42.500
 And so I posed my question.

57:42.500 --> 57:47.500
 I explained how our formalism is what it does

57:47.500 --> 57:52.500
 and what kind of applications I'm planning to do.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.260
 And it was in the middle of the night

57:56.260 --> 57:59.660
 and I went back to bed.

57:59.660 --> 58:04.660
 And next morning, have a phone call from my advisor

58:04.820 --> 58:06.940
 who also looked at this forum.

58:06.940 --> 58:11.060
 It's like, you won't believe who replied to you.

58:11.060 --> 58:13.940
 And it's like, who?

58:13.940 --> 58:16.540
 He said, well, there is a message to you

58:16.540 --> 58:17.900
 from Joshua Lederberg.

58:19.140 --> 58:22.580
 And my reaction was like, who is Joshua Lederberg?

58:22.580 --> 58:25.900
 And your advisor hung up.

58:27.460 --> 58:32.460
 So essentially, Joshua wrote me that we had conceptually

58:33.100 --> 58:36.660
 similar ideas in the Dendral project.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.220
 You may wanna look it up.

58:39.340 --> 58:42.860
 And we should also, sorry, and it's a side comment say

58:42.860 --> 58:47.220
 that even though he won the Nobel Prize at a really young age

58:47.220 --> 58:49.380
 in 58, but so.

58:49.380 --> 58:52.380
 He was, I think he was what, 33.

58:52.380 --> 58:53.980
 Yeah, it's just crazy.

58:53.980 --> 58:57.660
 So anyway, so that's, so hence in the 90s,

58:57.660 --> 59:02.100
 responding to young whippersnappers on the CCL forum.

59:02.100 --> 59:02.940
 Okay.

59:02.940 --> 59:05.860
 And so back then he was already very senior.

59:05.860 --> 59:09.620
 I mean, he unfortunately passed away back in 2008.

59:09.620 --> 59:14.180
 But back in 2001, he was a professor emeritus

59:14.180 --> 59:15.980
 at Rockefeller University.

59:15.980 --> 59:18.500
 And that was actually, believe it or not,

59:18.500 --> 59:23.500
 one of the reasons I decided to join as a postdoc,

59:26.780 --> 59:30.820
 the group of Andrei Saleh, who was at Rockefeller University

59:30.820 --> 59:35.820
 with the hope that I could actually have a chance

59:36.020 --> 59:37.980
 to meet Joshua in person.

59:37.980 --> 59:40.740
 And I met him very briefly, right?

59:40.740 --> 59:44.740
 The, just because he was walking,

59:44.740 --> 59:48.100
 you know, there's a little bridge that connects the sort

59:48.100 --> 59:53.100
 of the research campus with the sort of sky scrappers

59:54.260 --> 59:55.500
 that Rockefeller owns.

59:55.500 --> 1:00:00.500
 There were postdocs and faculty and graduate students live.

1:00:00.500 --> 1:00:02.460
 And so, so I met him, you know,

1:00:02.460 --> 1:00:06.340
 and I had a very short conversation, you know.

1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:10.380
 But so I started, you know, reading about Dendral

1:00:10.380 --> 1:00:12.660
 and I was amazed, you know, it's,

1:00:12.660 --> 1:00:16.100
 we're talking about 1960, right?

1:00:16.100 --> 1:00:19.260
 The ideas were so profound.

1:00:19.260 --> 1:00:21.100
 Well, what's the fundamental ideas of it?

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:25.020
 The reason to make this is even crazier.

1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:29.860
 So, so, so Lederberg wanted to make a system

1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:36.860
 that would help him study the extraterrestrial molecules, right?

1:00:38.740 --> 1:00:40.940
 So, so the idea was that, you know,

1:00:40.940 --> 1:00:43.380
 the way you study the extraterrestrial molecules

1:00:43.380 --> 1:00:46.780
 is you do the mass spec analysis, right?

1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:49.700
 And so the mass spec gives you sort of bits,

1:00:49.700 --> 1:00:52.620
 numbers about essentially gives you the ideas

1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:56.620
 about the possible fragments or, you know, atoms,

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:59.820
 and, you know, and maybe a little fragments,

1:00:59.820 --> 1:01:03.620
 pieces of this molecule that make up the molecule, right?

1:01:03.620 --> 1:01:08.620
 So now you need to sort of to decompose this information

1:01:09.220 --> 1:01:12.460
 and to figure out what was the whole

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:17.460
 before, you know, it became fragments, bits and pieces, right?

1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:22.660
 So, so in order to make this, you know, to have this tool,

1:01:22.660 --> 1:01:27.660
 the idea of Lederberg was to connect chemistry,

1:01:29.780 --> 1:01:34.780
 computer science, and to design this so called expert system

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:38.180
 that looks, that takes into account,

1:01:38.180 --> 1:01:42.180
 that takes as an input the mass spec data,

1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:47.180
 the possible, the database of possible molecules,

1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:51.860
 and essentially try to sort of induce

1:01:51.860 --> 1:01:55.580
 the molecule that would correspond to this spectra,

1:01:55.580 --> 1:02:00.580
 or, you know, essentially what this project ended up being

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:07.060
 was that, you know, it would provide a list of candidates

1:02:07.060 --> 1:02:11.940
 that then a chemist would look at and make final decision.

1:02:11.940 --> 1:02:12.780
 So.

1:02:12.780 --> 1:02:15.060
 But the original idea is supposed to solve the entirety

1:02:15.060 --> 1:02:16.820
 of this problem automatically.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:17.660
 Yes, yes.

1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:22.660
 No, so he, you know, so he, back then he approached,

1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:28.940
 yes, believe that, you know, it's amazing.

1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:32.220
 I mean, it still blows my mind, you know, that it's,

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:37.220
 that's, and this was essentially the origin

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:41.140
 of the modern bioinformatics, cheminformatics,

1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:42.780
 you know, back in the 60s.

1:02:42.780 --> 1:02:47.100
 So that's, you know, so every time you deal

1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:50.020
 with projects like this, with the, you know,

1:02:50.020 --> 1:02:52.580
 research like this, you just, you know,

1:02:52.580 --> 1:02:57.020
 so the power of the, you know, intelligence

1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:01.740
 of these people is just, you know, overwhelming.

1:03:01.740 --> 1:03:04.180
 Do you think about expert systems?

1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:09.180
 Is there, and why they kind of didn't become successful,

1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:12.500
 especially in the space of bioinformatics,

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:15.380
 where it does seem like there is a lot of expertise

1:03:15.380 --> 1:03:20.100
 in humans and, you know, it's possible to see

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:23.620
 that a system like this could be made very useful.

1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:24.460
 Right.

1:03:24.460 --> 1:03:26.940
 So it's actually, it's a great question.

1:03:26.940 --> 1:03:30.500
 And this is something so, you know, so, you know,

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:33.940
 at my university, I teach artificial intelligence

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:38.020
 and, you know, we start the, my first two lectures

1:03:38.020 --> 1:03:40.180
 are on the history of AI.

1:03:40.180 --> 1:03:44.420
 And there we, you know, we try to, you know,

1:03:44.420 --> 1:03:46.980
 go through the main stages of AI.

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:51.980
 And so, you know, the question of why expert systems failed

1:03:53.100 --> 1:03:57.300
 or became obsolete is actually a very interesting one.

1:03:57.300 --> 1:04:00.700
 And there are, you know, if you try to read the, you know,

1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:03.540
 the historical perspectives, there are actually two lines

1:04:03.540 --> 1:04:04.420
 of thoughts.

1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:09.420
 One is that they were essentially not up to the expectations

1:04:09.420 --> 1:04:12.460
 and so therefore they were replaced, you know,

1:04:12.460 --> 1:04:14.860
 by, by other things.

1:04:14.860 --> 1:04:15.700
 Right.

1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:20.180
 The other one was that completely opposite one

1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:22.580
 that they were too good.

1:04:22.580 --> 1:04:26.780
 And as a result, they essentially became sort of

1:04:26.780 --> 1:04:31.780
 a household name and then essentially they got transformed.

1:04:31.820 --> 1:04:33.860
 I mean, they, in both cases,

1:04:33.860 --> 1:04:37.140
 sort of they were replaced by other things, right.

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:40.020
 I mean, they, in both cases, sort of the outcome

1:04:40.020 --> 1:04:42.380
 was the same, they evolved into something.

1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:43.300
 Yeah.

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:44.140
 Right.

1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:47.700
 And that's what I, you know, if, if I look at this, right.

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:50.180
 So the modern machine learning, right.

1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:51.020
 So.

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:53.220
 So there's echoes in the modern machine learning.

1:04:53.220 --> 1:04:54.140
 I think so.

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:54.980
 I think so.

1:04:54.980 --> 1:04:57.180
 Because, you know, if, if you think about this, you know,

1:04:57.180 --> 1:05:02.180
 and how we design, you know, the most successful algorithms

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:04.100
 including alpha fold, right.

1:05:04.100 --> 1:05:09.100
 You built in the knowledge about the domain that you study.

1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:10.500
 Right.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:12.860
 So, so you built in your expertise.

1:05:12.860 --> 1:05:14.420
 So speaking of alpha fold,

1:05:14.420 --> 1:05:18.900
 so DeepMind's alpha fold two recently was announced to have

1:05:18.900 --> 1:05:21.340
 quote unquote, solved protein folding.

1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:24.180
 How exciting is this to you?

1:05:24.180 --> 1:05:28.260
 It seems to be one of the, one of the exciting things

1:05:28.260 --> 1:05:29.620
 that have happened in 2020.

1:05:29.620 --> 1:05:32.300
 It's incredible accomplishment from the looks of it.

1:05:32.300 --> 1:05:33.820
 What part of it is amazing to you?

1:05:33.820 --> 1:05:38.820
 What part would you say is overhyped or maybe misunderstood?

1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:41.860
 It's definitely a very exciting achievement

1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:43.740
 to give you a little bit of perspective, right.

1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:48.740
 So, so in bioinformatics, we have several competitions.

1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:54.940
 And so the way, you know, you often hear how those competitions

1:05:55.340 --> 1:05:59.260
 have been explained to sort of to non bioinformaticians

1:05:59.260 --> 1:06:01.900
 as they, you know, they call it bioinformatics Olympic games.

1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:03.620
 And there are several disciplines, right.

1:06:03.620 --> 1:06:07.060
 So, so the, the, the historical one of the first one

1:06:07.060 --> 1:06:10.340
 was the discipline in predicting the protein structure,

1:06:10.340 --> 1:06:12.620
 predicting the 3D coordinates of the protein,

1:06:12.620 --> 1:06:13.620
 but there are some others.

1:06:13.620 --> 1:06:16.780
 So the predicting protein functions,

1:06:16.780 --> 1:06:21.500
 predicting effects of mutations on protein functions,

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.940
 then predicting a protein, protein interactions.

1:06:24.940 --> 1:06:28.140
 So, so the original one was a CASP

1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:31.540
 or a critical assessment of, of protein structure.

1:06:31.540 --> 1:06:36.540
 And the, you know, typically what happens

1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:43.980
 during these competitions is, you know, scientists,

1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:48.380
 experimental scientists solve the, the structures,

1:06:48.380 --> 1:06:51.700
 but don't put them into the protein data bank,

1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:53.700
 which is the centralized database

1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:57.260
 that contains all the 3D coordinates.

1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:02.260
 Instead, they hold it and release protein sequences.

1:07:02.300 --> 1:07:05.420
 And now the challenge of the community

1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:10.140
 is to predict the 3D structures of these proteins

1:07:10.140 --> 1:07:12.940
 and then use the experimentary solve structures

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:16.620
 to assess which one is the closest one, right.

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:17.740
 And this competition, by the way,

1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:19.500
 just a bunch of different tangents.

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:22.860
 So maybe you can also say what is protein folding

1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:25.740
 then this competition CASP competition is,

1:07:25.740 --> 1:07:27.420
 has become the gold standard

1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:29.500
 and that's what was used to say

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:32.420
 that protein folding was solved.

1:07:32.420 --> 1:07:35.300
 So I just added a little, just a bunch.

1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:37.660
 So if you can, whenever you say stuff,

1:07:37.660 --> 1:07:39.940
 maybe throw in some of the basics for the folks

1:07:39.940 --> 1:07:41.540
 that might be outside of the field.

1:07:41.540 --> 1:07:42.380
 Anyway, sorry.

1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:45.900
 So, yeah, so, you know, so the reason it's, you know,

1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:50.260
 it's relevant to our understanding of protein folding

1:07:50.260 --> 1:07:54.140
 is because, you know, we, we've yet to learn

1:07:54.140 --> 1:07:58.140
 how the folding mechanistically works, right.

1:07:58.140 --> 1:08:00.740
 So there are different hypotheses

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:02.780
 what happens to this fold.

1:08:02.780 --> 1:08:05.940
 For example, there is a hypothesis

1:08:05.940 --> 1:08:09.780
 that the folding happens by, you know,

1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:12.660
 also in the modular fashion, right.

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:16.220
 So that, you know, we have protein domains

1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:17.940
 that get folded independently

1:08:17.940 --> 1:08:19.700
 because the structure is stable

1:08:19.700 --> 1:08:23.380
 and then the whole protein structure gets formed.

1:08:23.380 --> 1:08:25.380
 But, you know, within those domains,

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:27.460
 we also have so called secondary structure,

1:08:27.460 --> 1:08:29.820
 the small alpha helices, beta sheets.

1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:34.300
 So these are, you know, elements that are structurally stable.

1:08:34.300 --> 1:08:37.780
 And so, and the question is, you know,

1:08:37.780 --> 1:08:40.300
 when they, when do they get formed?

1:08:40.300 --> 1:08:42.580
 Because some of the secondary structure elements,

1:08:42.580 --> 1:08:46.460
 you have to have, you know, a fragment in the beginning

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:49.420
 and say the fragment in the middle, right.

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:54.420
 So you cannot potentially start having the full fold

1:08:54.820 --> 1:08:57.140
 from the get go, right.

1:08:57.140 --> 1:09:00.340
 So it's still, you know, it's still a big enigma.

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:04.300
 What happens, we know that it's an extremely efficient

1:09:04.300 --> 1:09:05.700
 and stable process, right.

1:09:05.700 --> 1:09:07.700
 So there's this long sequence

1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:09.540
 and the fold happens really quickly.

1:09:09.540 --> 1:09:10.380
 Exactly.

1:09:10.380 --> 1:09:11.700
 So that's really weird, right.

1:09:11.700 --> 1:09:15.260
 And it happens like the same way almost every time.

1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:16.580
 Exactly, exactly.

1:09:16.580 --> 1:09:17.900
 That's really weird.

1:09:17.900 --> 1:09:19.100
 That's freaking weird.

1:09:19.100 --> 1:09:22.900
 It's, yeah, that's why it's such an amazing thing.

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:24.980
 But most importantly, right, so it's, you know,

1:09:24.980 --> 1:09:29.260
 so when you see the, you know, the translation process, right.

1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:34.260
 So when you don't have the whole protein translated,

1:09:36.100 --> 1:09:39.220
 right, it's still being translated, you know,

1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:41.180
 getting out from the ribosome,

1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:45.780
 you already see some structural, you know, fragmentation.

1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:49.340
 So, so folding starts happening

1:09:49.340 --> 1:09:53.100
 before the whole protein gets produced, right.

1:09:53.100 --> 1:09:55.100
 And so this is, this is obviously, you know,

1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:59.260
 one of the biggest questions in, you know,

1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:01.020
 in modern molecular biologies.

1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:04.180
 Not, not like maybe what happens.

1:10:04.180 --> 1:10:07.900
 Like that's not, that's bigger than the question of folding.

1:10:07.900 --> 1:10:09.580
 That's the question of like,

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:12.460
 so like deeper fundamental idea of folding.

1:10:12.460 --> 1:10:13.300
 Yes.

1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:14.140
 Behind folding.

1:10:14.140 --> 1:10:14.980
 Exactly.

1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:19.980
 You know, so obviously if we are able to predict

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:24.020
 the end product of protein folding,

1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:27.620
 we are one step closer to understanding

1:10:27.620 --> 1:10:30.180
 sort of the mechanisms of the protein folding.

1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:34.660
 Because we can then potentially look and start probing

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:38.220
 what are the critical parts of this process

1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:41.220
 and what are not so critical parts of this process.

1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:44.380
 So we can start decomposing this, you know,

1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:49.380
 so in a way this protein structure prediction algorithm

1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:53.740
 can be used as a tool, right.

1:10:53.740 --> 1:10:58.740
 So you change the, you know, you modify the protein,

1:10:59.260 --> 1:11:02.420
 you get back to this tool, it predicts,

1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:04.980
 okay, it's completely unstable.

1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:07.820
 Yeah, which aspects of the input

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:09.900
 will have a big impact on the output.

1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:11.180
 Exactly, exactly.

1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:14.460
 So what happens is, you know, we typically have

1:11:14.460 --> 1:11:18.700
 some sort of incremental advancement.

1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:22.580
 You know, each stage of this CASP competition,

1:11:22.580 --> 1:11:25.340
 you have groups with incremental advancement.

1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:29.860
 And, you know, historically the top performing groups

1:11:29.860 --> 1:11:34.420
 were, you know, they were not using machine learning.

1:11:34.420 --> 1:11:37.700
 They were using very advanced biophysics

1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:39.580
 combined with bioinformatics,

1:11:39.580 --> 1:11:43.220
 combined with, you know, the data mining.

1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:47.340
 And that was, you know, that would enable them

1:11:47.340 --> 1:11:52.340
 to obtain protein structures of those proteins

1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:57.540
 that don't have any structurally solved relatives.

1:11:57.540 --> 1:12:01.860
 Because, you know, if we have another protein,

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:05.620
 say the same protein, but coming from a different species,

1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:10.500
 we could potentially derive some ideas,

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:13.260
 and that's so called homology or comparative modeling,

1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:15.300
 where we'll derive some ideas

1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:17.580
 from the previously known structures.

1:12:17.580 --> 1:12:21.460
 And that would help us tremendously in, you know,

1:12:21.460 --> 1:12:25.420
 in reconstructing the 3D structure overall.

1:12:25.420 --> 1:12:27.940
 But what happens when we don't have these relatives?

1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:31.260
 This is when it becomes really, really hard, right?

1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:35.220
 So that's so called the NOVO, you know,

1:12:35.220 --> 1:12:37.620
 the NOVO protein structure prediction.

1:12:37.620 --> 1:12:42.620
 And in this case, those methods were traditionally very good.

1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:46.300
 But what happened in the last year,

1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:49.540
 the original alpha fold came into,

1:12:50.660 --> 1:12:55.660
 and over sudden it's much better than everyone else.

1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:57.900
 This is 2018.

1:12:57.900 --> 1:12:58.740
 Yeah.

1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:02.140
 Oh, the competition is only every two years, I think.

1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:06.580
 And then, so, you know, it was sort of

1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:10.180
 kind of over shockwave to the bioinformatics community

1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:13.340
 that, you know, we have like a state of the art

1:13:13.340 --> 1:13:17.180
 machine learning system that does, you know,

1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:18.460
 structure prediction.

1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:20.780
 And essentially what it does, you know,

1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:23.620
 so, you know, if you look at this,

1:13:23.620 --> 1:13:26.140
 it actually predicts the context.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:29.460
 So, you know, so the process of reconstructing

1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:34.460
 the 3D structure starts by predicting the context

1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:38.860
 between the different parts of the protein.

1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:40.980
 And the context essentially is the parts of the proteins

1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:43.220
 that are in a close proximity to each other.

1:13:43.220 --> 1:13:44.060
 Right.

1:13:44.060 --> 1:13:47.020
 So actually the machine learning part seems to be

1:13:47.020 --> 1:13:51.060
 estimating, you can correct me if I'm wrong here,

1:13:51.060 --> 1:13:53.180
 but it seems to be estimating the distance matrix,

1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:55.900
 which is like the distance between the different parts.

1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:56.740
 Yeah.

1:13:56.740 --> 1:13:58.060
 So we call the contact map.

1:13:58.060 --> 1:13:58.900
 Contact map.

1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:00.580
 So once you have the contact map,

1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:03.900
 the reconstruction is becoming more straightforward.

1:14:03.900 --> 1:14:04.740
 Yeah.

1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:05.580
 Right.

1:14:05.580 --> 1:14:06.780
 But so the contact map is the key.

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:11.260
 And so, you know, so that's what happened.

1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:15.980
 And now we started seeing in this current stage, right?

1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:18.500
 Well, in the most recent one,

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:22.020
 we started seeing the emergence of these ideas

1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:25.060
 in others people works, right?

1:14:25.060 --> 1:14:29.500
 But yet here's, you know, Alpha Fold 2

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:33.380
 that again outperforms everyone else.

1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:35.780
 And also by introducing yet another wave

1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:38.660
 of the machine learning ideas.

1:14:38.660 --> 1:14:39.500
 Yeah.

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:41.260
 There doesn't seem to be also an incorporation.

1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:43.020
 First of all, the paper is not out yet,

1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:44.860
 but there's a bunch of ideas already out.

1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:48.100
 There does seem to be an incorporation of this other thing.

1:14:48.100 --> 1:14:50.180
 I don't know if it's something that you could speak to,

1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:55.180
 which is like the incorporation of like other structures,

1:14:58.180 --> 1:15:02.300
 like evolutionary similar structures that are used

1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:03.820
 to kind of give you hints.

1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:04.660
 Yes.

1:15:04.660 --> 1:15:08.380
 So evolutionary similarity is something

1:15:08.380 --> 1:15:10.740
 that we can detect at different levels, right?

1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:15.740
 So we know, for example, that the structure of proteins

1:15:15.740 --> 1:15:20.380
 is more conserved than the sequence.

1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:22.180
 The sequence could be very different,

1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:26.140
 but the structural shape is actually still very conserved.

1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:28.060
 So that's sort of the intrinsic property

1:15:28.060 --> 1:15:30.980
 that, you know, in a way related to protein folds,

1:15:30.980 --> 1:15:33.980
 you know, to the evolution of the, you know,

1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:37.660
 of the protein of proteins and protein domains, et cetera.

1:15:37.660 --> 1:15:38.500
 But we know that.

1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:40.900
 I mean, we've been multiple studies.

1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:45.180
 And, you know, ideally if you have structures,

1:15:45.180 --> 1:15:48.580
 you know, you should use that information.

1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:51.180
 However, sometimes we don't have this information.

1:15:51.180 --> 1:15:53.180
 Instead, we have a bunch of sequences.

1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:54.860
 Sequences we have a lot, right?

1:15:54.860 --> 1:15:59.860
 So we have, you know, hundreds, thousands of,

1:16:01.180 --> 1:16:04.260
 you know, different organisms sequence, right?

1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:07.820
 And by taking the same protein,

1:16:07.820 --> 1:16:11.580
 but in different organisms and aligning it,

1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:15.940
 so making it, you know, making the corresponding positions

1:16:15.940 --> 1:16:20.940
 aligned, we can actually say a lot about sort of

1:16:22.180 --> 1:16:24.140
 what is conserved in this protein.

1:16:24.140 --> 1:16:26.860
 And therefore, you know, structurally more stable,

1:16:26.860 --> 1:16:28.860
 what is diverse in this protein.

1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:32.340
 So on top of that, we could provide sort of the information

1:16:32.340 --> 1:16:35.060
 about the sort of the secondary structure

1:16:35.060 --> 1:16:36.380
 of this protein, et cetera, et cetera.

1:16:36.380 --> 1:16:38.980
 So this information is extremely useful.

1:16:39.900 --> 1:16:41.260
 And it's already there.

1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:44.180
 So while it's tempting to, you know,

1:16:44.180 --> 1:16:46.060
 to do a complete ab initio,

1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:49.540
 so you just have a protein sequence and nothing else,

1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:54.220
 the reality is such that we are overwhelmed with this data.

1:16:54.220 --> 1:16:55.500
 So why not use it?

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:59.220
 And so yeah, so I'm looking forward

1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:01.460
 to reading this paper.

1:17:01.460 --> 1:17:03.420
 It does seem to, like they've,

1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:05.100
 in the previous version of Alpha Fold,

1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:09.780
 they didn't, for this evolutionary similarity thing,

1:17:09.780 --> 1:17:12.020
 they didn't use machine learning for that.

1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:15.620
 Or they, rather they used it as like the input

1:17:15.620 --> 1:17:17.900
 to the entirety of the neural net,

1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:22.020
 like the features derived from the similarity.

1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:24.660
 It seems like there's some kind of quote, unquote,

1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:29.660
 iterative thing where it seems to be part of the,

1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:32.580
 part of the learning process is the incorporation

1:17:32.580 --> 1:17:34.260
 of this evolutionary similarity.

1:17:34.260 --> 1:17:36.940
 Yeah, I don't think there is a bio archive paper, right?

1:17:36.940 --> 1:17:37.780
 There's nothing.

1:17:37.780 --> 1:17:38.620
 There's nothing.

1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:40.700
 There's a blog post that's written

1:17:40.700 --> 1:17:42.620
 by a marketing team essentially,

1:17:42.620 --> 1:17:46.620
 which, you know, it has some scientific similarity

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:51.820
 probably to the actual methodology used,

1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:55.260
 but it could be, it's like interpreting scripture.

1:17:55.260 --> 1:17:58.820
 It could be, it could be just poetic interpretations

1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:00.060
 of the actual work as opposed

1:18:00.060 --> 1:18:01.940
 to direct connection to the work.

1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:04.300
 So now speaking about protein folding, right?

1:18:04.300 --> 1:18:06.860
 So, so, so, you know, in order to answer the question,

1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:09.460
 whether or not we have solved this, right?

1:18:09.460 --> 1:18:11.780
 So we need to go back to the beginning

1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:13.580
 of our conversation, you know,

1:18:13.580 --> 1:18:15.020
 with the realization that, you know,

1:18:15.020 --> 1:18:20.020
 an average protein is that typically what the CASP

1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:24.100
 has been focusing on is the, you know,

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:27.260
 the, this competition has been focusing on the single,

1:18:27.260 --> 1:18:31.060
 maybe two domain proteins that are still very compact.

1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:35.380
 And even those ones are extremely challenging to solve, right?

1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:37.620
 But now we talk about, you know,

1:18:37.620 --> 1:18:42.380
 an average protein that has two, three protein domains.

1:18:42.380 --> 1:18:46.900
 If you look at the proteins that are in charge

1:18:46.900 --> 1:18:51.900
 of the, you know, of the process with the neural system, right?

1:18:52.740 --> 1:18:57.740
 Perhaps one of the most recently evolved sort of systems

1:19:00.220 --> 1:19:04.140
 in the organism, right?

1:19:04.140 --> 1:19:06.380
 All of them, well, the majority of them

1:19:06.380 --> 1:19:09.020
 are highly multi domain proteins.

1:19:09.020 --> 1:19:13.540
 So they are, you know, some of them have five, six, seven,

1:19:13.540 --> 1:19:16.860
 you know, and more domains, right?

1:19:16.860 --> 1:19:20.020
 And, you know, we are very far away

1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:22.460
 from understanding how these proteins are folded.

1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:24.500
 So the complexity of the protein matters here,

1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:27.980
 the complexity of the protein modules

1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:30.260
 or the protein domains.

1:19:30.260 --> 1:19:34.260
 So you're saying solved.

1:19:34.260 --> 1:19:35.980
 So the definition of solved here

1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:38.620
 is particularly the cast competition,

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.740
 achieving human level, not human level,

1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:45.620
 achieving experimental level performance

1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:48.540
 on these particular sets of proteins

1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:50.300
 that have been used in these competitions.

1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:54.700
 Well, I mean, you know, I do think that, you know,

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:57.780
 especially with regards to the alpha fold, you know,

1:19:57.780 --> 1:20:02.780
 it is able to, you know, to solve, you know,

1:20:04.060 --> 1:20:07.380
 at the near experimental level,

1:20:09.020 --> 1:20:14.020
 pretty big majority of the more compact proteins,

1:20:14.980 --> 1:20:17.460
 like or protein domains, because again,

1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:21.220
 in order to understand how the overall protein,

1:20:22.300 --> 1:20:24.660
 you know, multi domain protein fold,

1:20:24.660 --> 1:20:26.820
 we do need to understand the structure

1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:28.780
 of its individual domains.

1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:32.980
 I mean, unlike if you look at alpha zero or like even mu zero,

1:20:35.180 --> 1:20:37.980
 if you look at that work, you know, it's nice,

1:20:37.980 --> 1:20:41.140
 reinforcement learning, self playing mechanisms are nice

1:20:41.140 --> 1:20:42.420
 because it's all in simulation.

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:45.940
 So you can learn from just huge amounts,

1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:49.780
 like you don't need data with like the problem with proteins,

1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:54.780
 like the size, I forget how many 3D structures have been mapped,

1:20:54.780 --> 1:20:57.380
 but the training data is very small, no matter what.

1:20:57.380 --> 1:21:00.060
 It's like millions, maybe a one or two millions,

1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:01.180
 something like that.

1:21:01.180 --> 1:21:02.700
 But some very small number,

1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:05.740
 but like it doesn't seem like that's scalable.

1:21:06.580 --> 1:21:09.140
 There has to be, I don't know,

1:21:09.140 --> 1:21:12.860
 it feels like you want to somehow 10x the data

1:21:12.860 --> 1:21:15.460
 or 100x the data somehow.

1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:20.460
 Yes, but we also can take advantage of homology models,

1:21:20.460 --> 1:21:24.460
 right, so the models that are of very good quality

1:21:24.460 --> 1:21:28.460
 because they are essentially obtained

1:21:28.460 --> 1:21:31.220
 based on the evolutionary information.

1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:36.220
 So there is a potential to enhance this information

1:21:36.220 --> 1:21:41.220
 and use it again to empower the training set.

1:21:41.220 --> 1:21:46.220
 And it's, I think, I am actually very optimistic.

1:21:46.220 --> 1:21:51.220
 I think it's been one of these sort of, you know,

1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:59.500
 churning events where you have a system

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:03.500
 that is, you know, a machine learning system

1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:08.500
 that is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

1:22:08.500 --> 1:22:11.300
 you know, a machine learning system

1:22:11.300 --> 1:22:15.740
 that is truly better than the sort of the more conventional

1:22:15.740 --> 1:22:17.940
 biophysics based methods.

1:22:17.940 --> 1:22:19.380
 That's a huge leap.

1:22:19.380 --> 1:22:21.260
 This is one of those fun questions,

1:22:21.260 --> 1:22:26.260
 but where would you put it in the ranking

1:22:26.740 --> 1:22:29.740
 of the greatest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence

1:22:29.740 --> 1:22:30.580
 history?

1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:34.940
 So like, okay, so let's see who's in the running.

1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:35.860
 Maybe you can correct me.

1:22:35.860 --> 1:22:40.860
 So you got like AlphaZero and AlphaGo beating, you know,

1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:44.540
 beating the world champion at the game of Go.

1:22:44.540 --> 1:22:48.260
 Thought to be impossible like 20 years ago,

1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:51.380
 or at least the AI community was highly skeptical.

1:22:51.380 --> 1:22:55.100
 Then you got like also DBlue original Kasparov.

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:56.300
 You have deep learning itself,

1:22:56.300 --> 1:22:58.340
 like the, maybe what would you say,

1:22:58.340 --> 1:23:00.980
 the AlexNet image net moment.

1:23:00.980 --> 1:23:04.820
 So the first network achieving human level performance,

1:23:04.820 --> 1:23:07.900
 super not, that's not true.

1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:11.020
 Achieving like a big leap in performance

1:23:11.020 --> 1:23:12.780
 on the computer vision problem.

1:23:14.460 --> 1:23:19.020
 There is open AI, the whole like GPT three,

1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:23.060
 that whole space of transformers and language models,

1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:27.140
 just achieving this incredible performance

1:23:27.140 --> 1:23:30.240
 of application of neural networks to language models.

1:23:31.820 --> 1:23:33.580
 Boston Dynamics, pretty cool.

1:23:33.580 --> 1:23:38.220
 Like robotics, even though people are like, there's no AI.

1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:41.560
 No, no, there's no machine learning currently,

1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:44.020
 but AI is much bigger than machine learning.

1:23:44.020 --> 1:23:45.340
 Yes.

1:23:45.340 --> 1:23:48.900
 So that just the engineering aspect,

1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:50.820
 I would say it's one of the greatest accomplishments

1:23:50.820 --> 1:23:52.900
 in engineering side.

1:23:52.900 --> 1:23:56.220
 Engineering meaning like mechanical engineering

1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:58.020
 of robotics ever.

1:23:58.020 --> 1:23:59.540
 Then of course, autonomous vehicles,

1:23:59.540 --> 1:24:01.340
 you can argue for Waymo,

1:24:01.340 --> 1:24:03.620
 which is like the Google self driving car,

1:24:03.620 --> 1:24:05.500
 or you can argue for Tesla,

1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:07.900
 which is like actually being used

1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:09.900
 by hundreds of thousands of people

1:24:09.900 --> 1:24:12.060
 on the road to day machine learning system.

1:24:13.740 --> 1:24:17.580
 And I don't know if you can, what else is there?

1:24:17.580 --> 1:24:18.420
 But I think that's it.

1:24:18.420 --> 1:24:20.020
 So, and then out for full,

1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:23.340
 many people are saying as up there, potentially number one,

1:24:23.340 --> 1:24:24.860
 would you put them at number one?

1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:29.860
 Well, in terms of the impact on the science

1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:31.900
 and on the society beyond,

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:36.500
 it's definitely to me would be one of the, you know.

1:24:37.460 --> 1:24:39.420
 Top three, what do you want?

1:24:39.420 --> 1:24:43.060
 Maybe, I mean, I'm probably not the best person

1:24:43.060 --> 1:24:48.060
 to answer that, but I do have,

1:24:48.060 --> 1:24:53.060
 I remember my, you know, back in, I think, 1997,

1:24:54.540 --> 1:24:58.220
 when Deep Blue, that Kasparov,

1:24:58.220 --> 1:25:01.900
 it was, I mean, it was a shock.

1:25:01.900 --> 1:25:05.620
 I mean, it was, and I think for the, you know,

1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:12.980
 for the pre substantial part of the world,

1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:19.140
 that especially people who have some, you know,

1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:21.780
 some experience with chess, right?

1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:25.660
 And realizing how incredibly human this game,

1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:29.620
 how, you know, how much of a brainpower you need,

1:25:29.620 --> 1:25:32.740
 you know, to reach those, you know,

1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:35.980
 those levels of grandmasters, right, level.

1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:37.940
 Yeah, I mean, it's probably one of the first time,

1:25:37.940 --> 1:25:39.580
 and how good Kasparov was.

1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:42.660
 And again, yeah, so Kasparov is actually one

1:25:42.660 --> 1:25:45.580
 of the best ever, right?

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:48.100
 And you get a machine that beats him, right?

1:25:48.100 --> 1:25:48.940
 So it's, you know.

1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:52.060
 First time a machine probably beat a human at that scale

1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:53.740
 of a thing, of anything.

1:25:53.740 --> 1:25:54.580
 Yes.

1:25:54.580 --> 1:25:57.220
 Yes, so that was, to me, that was like, you know,

1:25:57.220 --> 1:26:00.580
 one of the groundbreaking events in the history of FAYA.

1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:01.900
 Yeah, that's probably number one.

1:26:01.900 --> 1:26:05.420
 I probably, like, we don't, it's hard to remember.

1:26:05.420 --> 1:26:08.140
 It's like Muhammad Ali versus, I don't know,

1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:09.860
 any other Mike Tyson, something like that.

1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:11.940
 It's like, nah, you got to put Muhammad Ali

1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:15.300
 at number one, same with Deep Blue,

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:17.980
 even though it's not machine learning based.

1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:21.540
 Still, it uses advanced search,

1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:24.060
 and search is the integral part of FAYA, right?

1:26:24.060 --> 1:26:25.380
 So, as you said, it's...

1:26:25.380 --> 1:26:27.660
 People don't think of it that way at this moment.

1:26:27.660 --> 1:26:30.900
 In Vogue currently, search is not seen

1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:34.220
 as a fundamental aspect of intelligence,

1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:37.700
 but it very well, and you very likely is.

1:26:37.700 --> 1:26:39.860
 In fact, I mean, that's what neural networks are.

1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:42.900
 They're just performing search on the space of parameters.

1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:43.980
 And it's all search.

1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:47.740
 All of intelligence is some form of search,

1:26:47.740 --> 1:26:49.660
 and you just have to become clever and clever

1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:50.900
 at that search problem.

1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:53.980
 And I also have another one that you didn't mention

1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:58.260
 that's one of my favorite ones is...

1:26:58.260 --> 1:26:59.860
 So, you probably heard of this.

1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:03.420
 It's, I think it's called Deep Rembrandt.

1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:06.780
 It's the project where they trained...

1:27:06.780 --> 1:27:11.580
 I think there was a collaboration between the experts

1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:15.500
 in Rembrandt painting in Netherlands,

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:18.300
 and a group, an artificial intelligence group,

1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:22.140
 where they train an algorithm to replicate the style

1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:26.980
 of the Rembrandt, and they actually printed a portrait

1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:31.020
 that never existed before in the style of Rembrandt.

1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:36.020
 They, I think they printed it only sort of on the canvas

1:27:37.540 --> 1:27:41.420
 that using pretty much same types of paints

1:27:41.420 --> 1:27:44.020
 and stuff, to me, it was mind blowing.

1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:46.900
 Yeah, and the space of art, that's interesting.

1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:50.060
 There hasn't been, maybe that's it,

1:27:50.060 --> 1:27:54.540
 but I think there hasn't been an image in that moment yet

1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:55.780
 in the space of art.

1:27:56.740 --> 1:27:58.580
 You haven't been able to achieve

1:27:58.580 --> 1:28:01.380
 super human level performance in the space of art,

1:28:01.380 --> 1:28:04.620
 even though there was a big famous thing

1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:07.620
 where there was a piece of art was purchased,

1:28:07.620 --> 1:28:08.660
 I guess, for a lot of money.

1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:09.740
 Yes. Yeah.

1:28:09.740 --> 1:28:13.260
 But it's still, people are like in the space of music,

1:28:13.260 --> 1:28:18.260
 at least, it's clear that human created pieces

1:28:18.260 --> 1:28:21.740
 are much more popular.

1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:24.420
 So there hasn't been a moment where it's like,

1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:28.820
 oh, this is, where now, I would say in the space of music,

1:28:28.820 --> 1:28:30.180
 what makes a lot of money?

1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:32.140
 We're talking about serious money.

1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:35.340
 It's music and movies, or like shows and so on,

1:28:35.340 --> 1:28:36.660
 and entertainment.

1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:40.100
 There hasn't been a moment where AI created,

1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:44.500
 AI was able to create a piece of music,

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:49.500
 or a piece of cinema, or like Netflix show,

1:28:49.860 --> 1:28:54.860
 that is sufficiently popular to make a ton of money.

1:28:55.740 --> 1:28:58.980
 And that moment would be very, very powerful,

1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:02.060
 because that's an AI system being used

1:29:02.060 --> 1:29:03.060
 to make a lot of money.

1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:05.500
 And like direct, of course, AI tools,

1:29:05.500 --> 1:29:07.980
 like even premiere, audio editing, all the editing,

1:29:07.980 --> 1:29:09.820
 everything I do, to edit this podcast,

1:29:09.820 --> 1:29:11.380
 there's a lot of AI involved.

1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:13.300
 I won't, actually, this is a program,

1:29:13.300 --> 1:29:14.500
 I wanna talk to those folks just

1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:16.740
 because I wanna nerd out, it's called Isotope,

1:29:16.740 --> 1:29:18.100
 I don't know if you're familiar with it.

1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:20.220
 They have a bunch of tools of audio processing,

1:29:20.220 --> 1:29:23.100
 and they have, I think they're Boston based.

1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:26.420
 Just, it's so exciting to be, to use it,

1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:28.260
 like on the audio here,

1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:30.420
 because it's all machine learning.

1:29:30.420 --> 1:29:35.420
 It's not, because most audio production stuff

1:29:35.820 --> 1:29:37.580
 is like any kind of processing you do,

1:29:37.580 --> 1:29:39.540
 it's very basic signal processing.

1:29:39.540 --> 1:29:42.020
 And you're tuning knobs and so on.

1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:43.620
 They have all of that, of course,

1:29:43.620 --> 1:29:46.060
 but they also have all of this machine learning stuff,

1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:48.580
 like where you actually give it training data,

1:29:48.580 --> 1:29:51.780
 you select parts of the audio you train on,

1:29:51.780 --> 1:29:56.780
 you train on it, and it figures stuff out, it's great.

1:29:56.860 --> 1:30:00.660
 It's able to detect, like the ability of it

1:30:00.660 --> 1:30:04.860
 to be able to separate voice and music, for example,

1:30:04.860 --> 1:30:07.260
 or voice and anything is incredible.

1:30:07.260 --> 1:30:11.180
 Like it just, it's clearly exceptionally good

1:30:11.180 --> 1:30:14.980
 at applying these different neural networks models

1:30:14.980 --> 1:30:18.980
 to separate the different kinds of signals from the audio.

1:30:20.700 --> 1:30:22.300
 Okay, so that's really exciting.

1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:24.620
 Photoshop, Adobe, people also use it,

1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:28.340
 but to generate a piece of music

1:30:28.340 --> 1:30:32.020
 that will sell millions, a piece of art, yeah.

1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:37.020
 No, I agree, and that's, as I mentioned,

1:30:37.020 --> 1:30:42.020
 I offer my AI class and an integral part of this

1:30:43.620 --> 1:30:44.620
 is a project, right?

1:30:44.620 --> 1:30:47.300
 So it's my favorite, ultimate favorite part

1:30:47.300 --> 1:30:51.340
 because typically we have this project presentations

1:30:51.340 --> 1:30:53.660
 the last two weeks of the classes,

1:30:53.660 --> 1:30:56.140
 right before the Christmas break,

1:30:56.140 --> 1:31:00.260
 and it adds this cool excitement.

1:31:00.260 --> 1:31:05.260
 And every time, I'm amazed with some projects

1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:08.420
 that people come up with.

1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:12.780
 And so, and quite a few of them are actually,

1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:17.780
 they have some link to arts.

1:31:17.780 --> 1:31:21.900
 I mean, I think last year, we had a group

1:31:21.900 --> 1:31:26.900
 who designed an AI producing Hokus, Japanese poems.

1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:29.500
 Oh, wow.

1:31:29.500 --> 1:31:33.260
 So, and some of them, so it got trained

1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:37.260
 on the English place, Hokus, Hokus, right there.

1:31:37.260 --> 1:31:42.260
 So, and some of them, they get to present

1:31:42.340 --> 1:31:45.140
 like the top selection, they were pretty good.

1:31:45.140 --> 1:31:47.780
 I mean, of course, I'm not a specialist,

1:31:47.780 --> 1:31:50.340
 but you read them and you see it.

1:31:50.340 --> 1:31:51.420
 It seems profound.

1:31:51.420 --> 1:31:53.540
 Yes, yeah, it seems reasonable.

1:31:53.540 --> 1:31:54.860
 So it's kinda cool.

1:31:55.820 --> 1:31:57.820
 We also had a couple of projects

1:31:57.820 --> 1:32:00.740
 where people tried to teach AI

1:32:00.740 --> 1:32:05.740
 how to play rock music, classical music,

1:32:05.780 --> 1:32:08.380
 I think, and popular music.

1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:14.260
 Interestingly enough, classical music

1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:17.100
 was among the most difficult ones.

1:32:17.100 --> 1:32:22.100
 And of course, if you look at the grandmasters of music,

1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:27.100
 like Bach, right, so there's a lot of almost math.

1:32:28.100 --> 1:32:29.940
 Yeah, well, he's very mathematical, right?

1:32:29.940 --> 1:32:30.780
 Yeah, exactly.

1:32:30.780 --> 1:32:34.780
 So this is, I would imagine that at least some style

1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:37.100
 of this music could be picked up,

1:32:37.100 --> 1:32:40.100
 but then you have completely different spectrum

1:32:40.100 --> 1:32:42.460
 of classical composers.

1:32:42.460 --> 1:32:45.780
 And so, you know, and you know,

1:32:45.780 --> 1:32:49.060
 I think it's a little bit of a challenge

1:32:49.060 --> 1:32:54.060
 and so it's almost like you don't have to sort of

1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:57.980
 look at the data, you just listen to it

1:32:57.980 --> 1:33:00.620
 and say, nah, that's not it.

1:33:00.620 --> 1:33:01.460
 Not yet.

1:33:01.460 --> 1:33:02.300
 That's not it.

1:33:02.300 --> 1:33:03.340
 Yeah, that's how I feel too.

1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:05.820
 There's open AI as I think open muse

1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.540
 or something like that, the system.

1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:09.740
 It's cool, but it's like, yeah,

1:33:09.740 --> 1:33:12.060
 it's not compelling for some reason.

1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.180
 It could be a psychological reason too.

1:33:14.180 --> 1:33:17.540
 Maybe we need to have a human being,

1:33:17.540 --> 1:33:19.620
 a tortured soul behind the music.

1:33:19.620 --> 1:33:20.660
 I don't know.

1:33:20.660 --> 1:33:23.900
 Yeah, no, absolutely, I completely agree.

1:33:23.900 --> 1:33:26.540
 But yeah, whether or not we'll have,

1:33:26.540 --> 1:33:29.140
 one day we'll have, you know,

1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:33.340
 a song written by an AI engine

1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:36.060
 to be in like in top charts.

1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:36.900
 Yeah.

1:33:36.900 --> 1:33:37.900
 Musical charts.

1:33:37.900 --> 1:33:39.260
 I wouldn't be surprised.

1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:41.660
 I wouldn't be surprised.

1:33:43.340 --> 1:33:44.740
 I wonder if we already have one.

1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:46.420
 It just hasn't been announced.

1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:49.980
 We would know.

1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:53.900
 How hard is the multi protein folding problem?

1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:57.060
 Is that kind of something you've already mentioned,

1:33:57.060 --> 1:33:58.660
 which is baked into this idea

1:33:58.660 --> 1:34:01.140
 of greater and greater complexity of proteins?

1:34:01.140 --> 1:34:03.260
 Like multi domain proteins,

1:34:03.260 --> 1:34:08.260
 is that basically become multi protein complexes?

1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:10.580
 Yes, you got it right.

1:34:10.580 --> 1:34:16.580
 So it's sort of, it has the components of both,

1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:21.580
 of protein folding and protein, protein interactions.

1:34:21.860 --> 1:34:24.420
 Because in order for these domains,

1:34:24.420 --> 1:34:27.260
 I mean, many of these proteins actually,

1:34:27.260 --> 1:34:30.100
 they never form a stable structure.

1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:32.980
 One of my favorite proteins,

1:34:32.980 --> 1:34:37.700
 and pretty much everyone who works in the,

1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:41.740
 I know, who I know who works with proteins,

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:44.860
 they always have their favorite proteins, right?

1:34:44.860 --> 1:34:47.660
 So one of my favorite proteins,

1:34:47.660 --> 1:34:49.140
 probably my favorite protein,

1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:51.420
 the one that I worked when I was a postdoc,

1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:56.180
 is so called post synaptic density 95, PSD95 protein.

1:34:56.180 --> 1:35:00.500
 So it's one of the key actors

1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:03.780
 in the majority of neurological processes

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:04.700
 at the molecular level.

1:35:04.700 --> 1:35:09.700
 So it's essentially, it's a key player

1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:13.500
 in the post synaptic density.

1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:17.220
 So this is the crucial part of the synapse,

1:35:17.220 --> 1:35:22.220
 where a lot of these chemical processes are happening.

1:35:22.460 --> 1:35:26.260
 So it has five domains, right?

1:35:26.260 --> 1:35:30.860
 So five protein domains, pretty large proteins,

1:35:30.860 --> 1:35:35.860
 I think 600 something, I mean, I said, but, you know,

1:35:37.220 --> 1:35:41.300
 the way it's organized itself, it's flexible, right?

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:43.860
 So it acts as a scaffold.

1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:48.860
 So it is used to bring in other proteins.

1:35:49.300 --> 1:35:54.300
 So they start acting in the orchestrated manner, right?

1:35:54.300 --> 1:35:58.820
 So, and the type of the shape of this protein,

1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:02.540
 it's in a way, there are some stable parts of this protein,

1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:04.500
 but there are some flexible.

1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:08.580
 And this flexibility is built in into the protein

1:36:08.580 --> 1:36:13.140
 in order to become sort of this multifunctional machine.

1:36:13.140 --> 1:36:16.500
 So do you think that kind of thing is also learnable

1:36:16.500 --> 1:36:19.380
 through the alpha fold to kind of approach?

1:36:19.380 --> 1:36:22.420
 I mean, the time will tell.

1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:24.460
 Is it another level of complexity?

1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.340
 Is it like, how big of a jump in complexity

1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:28.180
 is that whole thing?

1:36:28.180 --> 1:36:31.380
 To me, it's yet another level of complexity

1:36:31.380 --> 1:36:35.180
 because when we talk about protein, protein interactions,

1:36:35.180 --> 1:36:38.860
 and there is actually a different challenge for this

1:36:38.860 --> 1:36:40.020
 called capri.

1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:43.460
 And so this, that is focused specifically

1:36:43.460 --> 1:36:45.700
 on macromolecular interactions,

1:36:45.700 --> 1:36:48.580
 protein, protein, protein, DNA, et cetera.

1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:53.580
 So, but it's, you know, there are different mechanisms

1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:58.580
 that govern molecular interactions

1:36:58.780 --> 1:37:00.780
 and that need to be picked up,

1:37:00.780 --> 1:37:03.700
 say by a machine learning algorithm.

1:37:03.700 --> 1:37:06.580
 Interestingly enough, we actually,

1:37:06.580 --> 1:37:11.580
 we participated for a few years in this competition.

1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:14.980
 We typically don't participate in competitions,

1:37:14.980 --> 1:37:19.860
 I don't know, don't have enough time, you know,

1:37:19.860 --> 1:37:23.740
 because it's very intensive process.

1:37:23.740 --> 1:37:28.220
 But we participated back in, you know,

1:37:28.220 --> 1:37:30.620
 about 10 years ago or so.

1:37:30.620 --> 1:37:32.700
 And the way we enter this competition,

1:37:32.700 --> 1:37:35.460
 so we design a scoring function, right?

1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:38.140
 So the function that evaluates whether or not

1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:40.580
 your protein, protein interaction

1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:43.380
 is supposed to look like experimentally solved, right?

1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:45.940
 So the scoring function is very critical part

1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:49.840
 of the model prediction.

1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:52.740
 So we designed it to be a machine learning one.

1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:56.660
 And so it was one of the first machine learning

1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:00.020
 based scoring function used in capri.

1:38:00.020 --> 1:38:03.980
 And, you know, we essentially, you know,

1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:06.620
 learned what should contribute,

1:38:06.620 --> 1:38:08.900
 what are the critical components contributing

1:38:08.900 --> 1:38:10.660
 into the protein, protein interactions.

1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:13.380
 So this could be converted into learning problem

1:38:13.380 --> 1:38:15.660
 and thereby it could be learned.

1:38:15.660 --> 1:38:17.060
 I believe so, yes.

1:38:17.060 --> 1:38:20.500
 Do you think Alpha Fold 2 or something similar to it

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:24.340
 from DeepMind or somebody else will be,

1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:28.700
 will result in a Nobel Prize or multiple Nobel Prizes?

1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:33.340
 So like, you know, obviously, maybe not so obviously,

1:38:33.340 --> 1:38:38.060
 you can't give a Nobel Prize to a computer program.

1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:41.020
 You, at least for now, give it to the designers

1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:42.180
 of that program.

1:38:42.180 --> 1:38:46.100
 But is, do you see one or multiple Nobel Prizes

1:38:46.100 --> 1:38:51.100
 where Alpha Fold 2 is like a large percentage

1:38:51.740 --> 1:38:54.900
 of what that prize is given for?

1:38:54.900 --> 1:38:58.980
 Would it lead to discoveries at the level of Nobel Prizes?

1:39:00.540 --> 1:39:05.420
 I mean, I think we are definitely destined

1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:08.740
 to see the Nobel Prize becoming sort of,

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:12.340
 to be evolving with the evolution of science.

1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:14.540
 And the evolution of science is such

1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:17.860
 that it now becomes like really multifaceted, right?

1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:21.340
 So where you don't really have like a unique discipline,

1:39:21.340 --> 1:39:25.680
 you have sort of the, a lot of cross disciplinary talks

1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:28.500
 in order to achieve sort of, you know,

1:39:28.500 --> 1:39:32.420
 really big advancements, you know.

1:39:32.420 --> 1:39:37.420
 So I think, you know, the computational methods

1:39:39.220 --> 1:39:42.540
 will be acknowledged in one way or another.

1:39:42.540 --> 1:39:46.900
 And as a matter of fact, you know,

1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:50.620
 they were first acknowledged back in 2013, right?

1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:55.620
 Where, you know, the first three people were,

1:39:56.060 --> 1:39:59.740
 you know, awarded the Nobel Prize for studying

1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:01.540
 the protein folding, right, the principle.

1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:03.860
 And, you know, I think all three of them

1:40:03.860 --> 1:40:06.940
 are computational biophysicists, right?

1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:11.940
 So, you know, that I think is, is unavoidable, you know.

1:40:14.580 --> 1:40:16.600
 It will come with a time.

1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:21.980
 The fact that, you know, alpha fold

1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:24.540
 and, you know, similar approaches,

1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:26.380
 because again, it's a matter of time

1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:31.380
 that people will embrace the, this, you know, principle

1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:34.980
 and we'll see more and more such, you know,

1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:36.980
 such tools coming into play.

1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:41.980
 But, you know, these methods will be critical

1:40:42.420 --> 1:40:47.420
 in a scientific discovery, no, no doubts about it.

1:40:47.700 --> 1:40:51.500
 On the engineering side, maybe a dark question,

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:53.420
 but do you think it's possible

1:40:53.420 --> 1:40:55.180
 to use these machine learning methods

1:40:55.180 --> 1:40:59.020
 to start to engineer proteins?

1:40:59.020 --> 1:41:03.180
 And the next question is something,

1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:06.100
 quite a few biologists are against summer four

1:41:06.100 --> 1:41:09.660
 for study purposes is to engineer viruses.

1:41:09.660 --> 1:41:12.660
 Do you think machine learning, like something like alpha fold

1:41:12.660 --> 1:41:14.820
 could be used to engineer viruses?

1:41:14.820 --> 1:41:17.020
 So, to answer the first question, you know,

1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:21.700
 it has been, you know, a part of the research

1:41:21.700 --> 1:41:24.540
 in the protein science, the protein design

1:41:24.540 --> 1:41:29.180
 is, you know, is a very prominent areas of research.

1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:31.060
 Of course, you know, one of the pioneers

1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:33.660
 is David Baker and Rosetta algorithm

1:41:33.660 --> 1:41:38.220
 that essentially was doing the, the, the nova design

1:41:38.220 --> 1:41:41.500
 and was used to design new proteins, you know.

1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:44.220
 And design of proteins means design of functions.

1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:47.340
 So like when you design a protein, you can control,

1:41:47.340 --> 1:41:49.100
 I mean, the whole point of a protein

1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180
 with the protein structure comes a function

1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:53.700
 like it's doing something.

1:41:53.700 --> 1:41:54.540
 Correct.

1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:56.060
 So you can design different things.

1:41:56.060 --> 1:41:58.740
 So you can, yeah, so you can, well, you can look

1:41:58.740 --> 1:42:00.700
 at the proteins from the functional perspective.

1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:02.740
 You can also look at the proteins

1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:04.220
 from the structural perspective, right?

1:42:04.220 --> 1:42:05.740
 So the structural building blocks.

1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:08.900
 So if you want to have a building block of a certain shape,

1:42:08.900 --> 1:42:11.220
 you can try to achieve it by, you know,

1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:13.180
 introducing a new protein sequence

1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:17.300
 and predicting, you know, how it will fold.

1:42:17.300 --> 1:42:22.060
 So, so with that, I mean, it's, it's a natural,

1:42:22.060 --> 1:42:25.860
 one of the, you know, natural applications

1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:28.260
 of these algorithms.

1:42:28.260 --> 1:42:32.500
 Now talking about engineering a virus.

1:42:34.180 --> 1:42:35.220
 With machine learning.

1:42:35.220 --> 1:42:36.420
 With machine learning, right?

1:42:36.420 --> 1:42:41.420
 So, so, well, you know, so luckily for us,

1:42:41.740 --> 1:42:46.740
 I mean, we don't have that much data, right?

1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:50.180
 We actually, right now, one of the projects

1:42:50.180 --> 1:42:53.020
 that we are carrying on in the lab

1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:57.020
 is we're trying to develop a machine learning algorithm

1:42:57.020 --> 1:43:00.060
 that determines the, whether or not

1:43:00.060 --> 1:43:02.740
 the current strain is pathogenic.

1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:04.620
 And the current strain of the coronavirus.

1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:06.140
 Of the virus.

1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:09.020
 I mean, so, so there are applications to coronaviruses

1:43:09.020 --> 1:43:13.020
 because we have strains of SARS CoV2, also SARS CoV,

1:43:13.020 --> 1:43:16.340
 MERS that are pathogenic, but we also have strains

1:43:16.340 --> 1:43:20.220
 of other coronaviruses that are, you know, not pathogenic.

1:43:20.220 --> 1:43:23.620
 I mean, the common cold viruses and, you know,

1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:25.620
 and some other ones, right?

1:43:25.620 --> 1:43:29.020
 So, so, pathogenic, meaning spreading.

1:43:29.020 --> 1:43:33.020
 Pathogenic means actually inflicting damage, correct.

1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:39.180
 There are also some, you know, seasonal versus pandemic

1:43:39.180 --> 1:43:41.820
 strains of influenza, right?

1:43:41.820 --> 1:43:45.540
 And to determining what are the molecular determinant, right?

1:43:45.540 --> 1:43:48.340
 So that are built in into the protein sequence,

1:43:48.340 --> 1:43:50.740
 into the gene sequence, right?

1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:55.020
 So, and whether or not the machine learning can determine

1:43:55.020 --> 1:43:58.460
 those components, right?

1:43:58.460 --> 1:43:59.300
 Oh, interesting.

1:43:59.300 --> 1:44:00.700
 So like using machine learning to,

1:44:00.700 --> 1:44:03.980
 that's really interesting to, to, to, to given,

1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:07.420
 give the input is like what the entire,

1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:09.780
 the protein sequence, and then determine

1:44:09.780 --> 1:44:12.380
 if this thing is going to be able to do damage

1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:14.660
 to, to a biological system.

1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:15.980
 Yeah.

1:44:15.980 --> 1:44:16.820
 So, so, I mean, so.

1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:17.660
 It's a good machine learning part.

1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:19.420
 You're saying we don't have enough data for that?

1:44:19.420 --> 1:44:22.660
 We, I mean, for, for this specific one we do,

1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:25.540
 we might actually, you know, have to back up on this.

1:44:25.540 --> 1:44:27.260
 Cause we, we're still in the process.

1:44:27.260 --> 1:44:31.660
 There was one work that appeared in bio archive

1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:34.900
 by Eugene Kunin, who is one of these, you know,

1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:39.020
 pioneers in, in, in evolutionary genomics.

1:44:39.020 --> 1:44:42.820
 And they tried to look at this, but, you know,

1:44:42.820 --> 1:44:46.060
 the methods were sort of standard, you know,

1:44:46.060 --> 1:44:48.620
 supervised learning methods.

1:44:48.620 --> 1:44:51.300
 And now the question is, you know,

1:44:51.300 --> 1:44:56.300
 can you advance it further by, by using, you know,

1:44:56.620 --> 1:44:58.580
 not so standard methods, you know,

1:44:58.580 --> 1:45:02.700
 so there's obviously a lot of hope in, in transfer learning

1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:06.220
 where you can actually try to transfer the information

1:45:06.220 --> 1:45:07.700
 that the machine learning learns

1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:11.340
 about the proper protein sequences, right?

1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:16.140
 And, you know, so, so there is some promise

1:45:16.140 --> 1:45:17.260
 in going this direction.

1:45:17.260 --> 1:45:20.460
 But if we have this, it would be extremely useful

1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:22.940
 because then we could essentially forecast

1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:24.860
 the potential mutations that would make

1:45:24.860 --> 1:45:27.940
 the current strain more or less pathogenic, right?

1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:31.140
 Anticipate, anticipate them from a vaccine development

1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:34.540
 for the treatment, anti, anti viral drug development.

1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:36.820
 That would be a very crucial task.

1:45:36.820 --> 1:45:41.820
 But you could also use that system to then say,

1:45:42.140 --> 1:45:45.220
 how would we potentially modify this virus

1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:47.140
 to make it more pathogenic?

1:45:48.780 --> 1:45:49.620
 That's true.

1:45:49.620 --> 1:45:50.460
 That's true.

1:45:50.460 --> 1:45:55.460
 I mean, you know, the, again, the hope is,

1:45:57.900 --> 1:45:59.660
 well, several things, right?

1:45:59.660 --> 1:46:02.140
 So one is that, you know, it's,

1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:06.780
 even if you design a, you know, a sequence, right?

1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:11.780
 So to carry out the actual experimental biology

1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:16.820
 to ensure that all the components working, you know,

1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:19.780
 is a completely different method.

1:46:19.780 --> 1:46:20.860
 Yes.

1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:24.380
 Then the, you know, we've seen in the past,

1:46:24.380 --> 1:46:27.660
 there could be some regulation of the moment

1:46:27.660 --> 1:46:30.420
 the scientific community recognizes

1:46:30.420 --> 1:46:34.620
 that it's now becoming no longer a sort of a fun puzzle

1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.660
 to, you know, for machine learning.

1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:37.860
 Could be a weapon.

1:46:37.860 --> 1:46:40.420
 Yes. So then there might be some regulation.

1:46:40.420 --> 1:46:45.420
 So I think back in what, 2015, there was, you know,

1:46:45.420 --> 1:46:49.500
 there was an issue on regulating the research

1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.460
 on influenza strains, right?

1:46:52.460 --> 1:46:55.540
 That there were several groups, you know,

1:46:55.540 --> 1:46:59.660
 use sort of the mutation analysis to determine

1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:01.780
 whether or not this strain will jump

1:47:01.780 --> 1:47:03.260
 from one species to another.

1:47:03.260 --> 1:47:06.500
 And I think there was like a half a year moratorium

1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:09.700
 on the research, on the paper published

1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:13.540
 until, you know, scientists, you know, analyzed it

1:47:13.540 --> 1:47:16.420
 and decided that it's actually safe.

1:47:16.420 --> 1:47:17.620
 I forgot what that's called.

1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:20.060
 Something a function, test a function.

1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:20.900
 Gain a function.

1:47:20.900 --> 1:47:21.980
 Gain a function.

1:47:21.980 --> 1:47:23.620
 Yeah, gain a function, loss of function.

1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:24.460
 That's right.

1:47:24.460 --> 1:47:25.300
 Sorry.

1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:29.620
 It's like, let's watch this thing mutate for a while

1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:33.740
 to see like, to see what kind of things we can observe.

1:47:33.740 --> 1:47:37.260
 I guess I'm not so much worried about that kind of research

1:47:37.260 --> 1:47:38.580
 if there's a lot of regulation

1:47:38.580 --> 1:47:42.740
 and if it's done very well and with competence and seriously.

1:47:42.740 --> 1:47:46.980
 I am more worried about kind of this, you know,

1:47:46.980 --> 1:47:49.580
 the underlying aspect of this question

1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:51.260
 is more like 50 years from now.

1:47:52.900 --> 1:47:54.900
 Speaking to the Drake equation,

1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:57.260
 one of the parameters in the Drake equation

1:47:57.260 --> 1:47:59.780
 is how long civilizations last.

1:47:59.780 --> 1:48:03.820
 And that seems to be the most important value actually

1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:06.660
 for calculating if there's other alien intelligence

1:48:06.660 --> 1:48:08.020
 civilizations out there.

1:48:08.020 --> 1:48:10.940
 That's where there's most variability,

1:48:10.940 --> 1:48:15.060
 assuming like if life, if that percentage

1:48:15.060 --> 1:48:19.380
 that life can emerge is like not zero,

1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:21.260
 like if we're super unique,

1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:23.620
 then it's the how long we last

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:26.180
 is basically the most important thing.

1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:28.980
 So from a selfish perspective,

1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:32.020
 but also from a Drake equation perspective,

1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:35.020
 I'm worried about our civilization lasting.

1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:37.620
 And you kind of think about all the ways

1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:39.100
 in which machine learning can be used

1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:44.100
 to design greater weapons of destruction, right?

1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:48.580
 And I mean, one way to ask that,

1:48:48.580 --> 1:48:50.540
 if you look sort of 50 years from now,

1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:51.660
 100 years from now,

1:48:52.620 --> 1:48:55.780
 would you be more worried about natural pandemics

1:48:55.780 --> 1:48:57.540
 or engineered pandemics?

1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:02.620
 Like who's the better designer of viruses,

1:49:02.620 --> 1:49:05.980
 nature or humans if we look down the line?

1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:10.140
 I think in my view, I would still be worried

1:49:10.140 --> 1:49:13.660
 about the natural pandemics simply because,

1:49:13.660 --> 1:49:18.660
 I mean, the capacity of the nature producing this.

1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:22.700
 It does pretty good job, right?

1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:23.540
 Yes.

1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.260
 And the motivation for using virus,

1:49:25.260 --> 1:49:29.020
 engineering viruses as a weapon is a weird one

1:49:29.020 --> 1:49:31.460
 because maybe you can correct me on this,

1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:35.620
 but it seems very difficult to target a virus, right?

1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:38.420
 The whole point of a weapon, the way a rocket works,

1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:40.140
 if a starting point, you have an end point

1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:42.380
 and you're trying to hit a target,

1:49:42.380 --> 1:49:44.700
 to hit a target with a virus is very difficult.

1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:47.100
 It's basically just, right?

1:49:47.100 --> 1:49:50.100
 It's, the target would be the human species.

1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:54.820
 Man, yeah, I have a hope in us,

1:49:54.820 --> 1:49:58.300
 I'm forever optimistic that we will not,

1:49:58.300 --> 1:50:01.620
 there's no, there's insufficient evil in the world

1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:04.580
 to lead that to that kind of destruction.

1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:07.780
 Well, I also hope that, I mean, that's what we see.

1:50:07.780 --> 1:50:11.780
 I mean, with the way we are getting connected,

1:50:11.780 --> 1:50:14.460
 the world is getting connected.

1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:19.460
 I think it helps for the world to become more transparent.

1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:22.540
 Yeah.

1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:27.100
 So the information spread is,

1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:31.660
 I think it's one of the key things for the society

1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:36.500
 to become more balanced one way or another.

1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:38.380
 This is something that people disagree with me on,

1:50:38.380 --> 1:50:41.940
 but I do think that the kind of secrecy

1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:43.500
 that governments have,

1:50:43.500 --> 1:50:47.100
 so you're kind of speaking more to the other aspects,

1:50:47.100 --> 1:50:49.740
 like research community being more open,

1:50:49.740 --> 1:50:52.180
 companies are being more open,

1:50:52.180 --> 1:50:53.940
 government is still like,

1:50:55.940 --> 1:50:57.900
 we're talking about like military secrets.

1:50:57.900 --> 1:51:01.420
 I think military secrets of the kind

1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:03.740
 that could destroy the world

1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:07.340
 will become also a thing of the 20th century.

1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:09.340
 It'll become more and more open.

1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:12.260
 Like I think nations will lose power

1:51:12.260 --> 1:51:13.220
 in the 21st century,

1:51:13.220 --> 1:51:15.980
 like lose sufficient power to our secrecy.

1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:18.900
 Transparency is more beneficial than secrecy,

1:51:18.900 --> 1:51:21.180
 but of course that's not obvious.

1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:22.220
 Let's hope so.

1:51:22.220 --> 1:51:27.220
 Let's hope so that the governments will become

1:51:27.220 --> 1:51:30.300
 more transparent.

1:51:32.140 --> 1:51:35.300
 So we last talked I think in March or April,

1:51:35.300 --> 1:51:36.780
 what have you learned?

1:51:36.780 --> 1:51:40.500
 How is your philosophical, psychological,

1:51:40.500 --> 1:51:43.860
 biological worldview changed since then?

1:51:43.860 --> 1:51:46.140
 Or you've been studying it nonstop

1:51:46.140 --> 1:51:48.940
 from a computational biology perspective.

1:51:48.940 --> 1:51:50.460
 How is your understanding and thoughts

1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:53.060
 about this virus changed over those months

1:51:53.060 --> 1:51:54.500
 from the beginning to today?

1:51:54.500 --> 1:51:58.140
 One thing that I was really amazed

1:51:58.140 --> 1:52:03.140
 at how efficient the scientific community was.

1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:08.140
 I mean, and even just judging on this very narrow domain

1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:13.980
 of protein structure, understanding the structural

1:52:15.740 --> 1:52:17.580
 characterization of this virus

1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:19.900
 from the components point of view,

1:52:19.900 --> 1:52:21.460
 whole virus point of view.

1:52:21.460 --> 1:52:26.060
 If you look at SARS, right?

1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:31.060
 The something that happened less than 20,

1:52:31.060 --> 1:52:34.060
 but close enough 20 years ago,

1:52:35.020 --> 1:52:38.540
 and you see what, when it happened,

1:52:38.540 --> 1:52:42.500
 what was sort of the response by the scientific community,

1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:47.140
 you see that the structure characterizations did occur,

1:52:47.140 --> 1:52:51.660
 but it took several years, right?

1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:54.940
 Now the things that took several years,

1:52:54.940 --> 1:52:56.900
 it's a matter of months, right?

1:52:56.900 --> 1:53:01.620
 So we see that the research pop up.

1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:03.980
 We are at the unprecedented level

1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:06.020
 in terms of the sequencing, right?

1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:11.020
 Never before we had a single virus

1:53:11.580 --> 1:53:14.820
 sequenced so many times, you know?

1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:19.820
 So which allows us to actually, to trace very precisely

1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:24.940
 the sort of the evolutionary nature of this virus,

1:53:24.940 --> 1:53:29.940
 what happens, and it's not just this virus independently

1:53:31.020 --> 1:53:35.820
 of everything, it's the sequence of this virus

1:53:35.820 --> 1:53:39.940
 linked anchor to the specific geographic place

1:53:39.940 --> 1:53:44.940
 to specific people because our genotype influences

1:53:46.100 --> 1:53:48.900
 also the evolution of this.

1:53:48.900 --> 1:53:53.900
 It's always a host pathogen evolution that occurs.

1:53:55.420 --> 1:53:58.020
 It'd be cool if we also had a lot more data

1:53:58.020 --> 1:54:02.540
 about the spread of this virus, not maybe,

1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:05.100
 well, it'd be nice if we had it

1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:08.100
 for like contact tracing purposes for this virus,

1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:10.420
 but it'd be also nice if we had it for the study

1:54:10.420 --> 1:54:13.540
 for future viruses to be able to respond and so on.

1:54:13.540 --> 1:54:15.980
 But it's already nice that we have geographical data

1:54:15.980 --> 1:54:18.420
 and the basic data from individual humans, yeah.

1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:22.820
 Exactly, no, I think contact tracing is obviously

1:54:22.820 --> 1:54:27.820
 a key component in understanding the spread of this virus.

1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:31.700
 There is also, there is a number of challenges, right?

1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:36.700
 So XPRIZE is one of them we just recently

1:54:36.700 --> 1:54:40.900
 took a part of this competition.

1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:45.900
 It's the prediction of the number of infections

1:54:46.740 --> 1:54:51.740
 in different regions, so obviously the AI

1:54:52.660 --> 1:54:56.300
 is the main topic in those predictions.

1:54:56.300 --> 1:55:00.340
 Yeah, but it's still the data, I mean, that's a competition,

1:55:00.340 --> 1:55:05.340
 but the data is weak on the training.

1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:09.340
 It's great, it's much more than probably before,

1:55:09.340 --> 1:55:12.900
 but it would be nice if it was really rich.

1:55:12.900 --> 1:55:16.780
 I talked to Michael Mina from Harvard,

1:55:16.780 --> 1:55:19.020
 I mean, he dreams that the community comes together

1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:22.900
 with a weather map to wear of viruses,

1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:27.900
 like really high resolution sensors on how,

1:55:27.900 --> 1:55:29.900
 from person to person, the viruses that travel,

1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:32.020
 all the different kinds of viruses,

1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:34.660
 because there's a ton of them,

1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:36.820
 and then you'll be able to tell the story

1:55:36.820 --> 1:55:41.100
 that you've spoken about of the evolution of this virus.

1:55:41.100 --> 1:55:44.820
 It's like day to day mutations that are occurring.

1:55:44.820 --> 1:55:46.100
 I mean, that would be fascinating,

1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:48.700
 just from a perspective of study,

1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:50.220
 and from the perspective of being able

1:55:50.220 --> 1:55:51.660
 to respond to future pandemics.

1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:53.980
 That's ultimately what I'm worried about.

1:55:54.980 --> 1:55:56.460
 People love books.

1:55:56.460 --> 1:56:01.180
 Is there some three or whatever number of books,

1:56:01.180 --> 1:56:06.180
 technical fiction, philosophical, that brought you joy in life,

1:56:06.260 --> 1:56:07.780
 had an impact on your life,

1:56:07.780 --> 1:56:11.340
 and maybe some that you would recommend others?

1:56:11.340 --> 1:56:13.620
 So I'll give you three very different books,

1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:17.180
 and I also have a special runner up, and a...

1:56:17.180 --> 1:56:18.500
 Honorable matching.

1:56:18.500 --> 1:56:21.980
 Yeah, I mean, it's an audiobook,

1:56:21.980 --> 1:56:25.500
 and there's some specific reason behind it.

1:56:25.500 --> 1:56:32.460
 So the first book is something that impacted my earlier stage of life,

1:56:32.460 --> 1:56:36.220
 and I'm probably not going to be very original here.

1:56:36.220 --> 1:56:39.140
 It's Bulgakov's Master and Margarita.

1:56:39.140 --> 1:56:41.300
 So that's probably...

1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:43.860
 Well, not for a Russian, maybe, it's not super original,

1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:47.660
 but it's a really powerful book, even in English.

1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:49.180
 So I read it in English.

1:56:49.180 --> 1:56:55.180
 It is incredibly powerful, and I mean, it's the way it ends,

1:56:55.180 --> 1:57:01.500
 right, so I still have goosebumps when I read the very last sort of...

1:57:01.500 --> 1:57:05.780
 It's called Prologue, where it's just so powerful.

1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:07.900
 What impact did it have on you? What ideas?

1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:09.300
 What insights did you get from it?

1:57:09.300 --> 1:57:21.180
 I was just taken by the fact that you have those parallel lives

1:57:21.180 --> 1:57:23.420
 apart from many centuries, right?

1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:30.340
 And somehow they got sort of intertwined into one story.

1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:33.860
 And that, to me, was fascinating.

1:57:33.860 --> 1:57:41.740
 And of course, the romantic part of this book is not just romance,

1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:46.860
 it's like the romance empowered by sort of magic, right?

1:57:46.860 --> 1:57:51.580
 And maybe on top of that, you have some irony,

1:57:51.580 --> 1:57:56.420
 which is unavoidable, right, because it was that Soviet time.

1:57:56.420 --> 1:58:02.860
 But it's very deeply Russian, so that's the wit, the humor, the pain,

1:58:02.860 --> 1:58:08.060
 the love, all of that is one of the books that kind of captures something

1:58:08.060 --> 1:58:12.540
 about Russian culture that people outside of Russia should probably read.

1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:13.140
 I agree.

1:58:13.140 --> 1:58:14.220
 What's the second one?

1:58:14.220 --> 1:58:19.620
 So the second one is, again, another one that it happened...

1:58:19.620 --> 1:58:21.860
 I read it later in my life.

1:58:21.860 --> 1:58:27.740
 I think I read it first time when I was a graduate student.

1:58:27.740 --> 1:58:31.820
 And that's the Solzhenitsyn Cancer Award.

1:58:31.820 --> 1:58:36.340
 That is an amazingly powerful book.

1:58:36.340 --> 1:58:37.620
 What is it about?

1:58:37.620 --> 1:58:41.620
 It's about, I mean, essentially based on...

1:58:41.620 --> 1:58:46.820
 Solzhenitsyn was diagnosed with cancer when he was reasonably young

1:58:46.820 --> 1:58:54.540
 and he made a full recovery, but so this is about a person

1:58:54.540 --> 1:59:00.580
 who was sentenced for life in one of these camps.

1:59:00.580 --> 1:59:06.820
 And he had some cancer, so he was transported back

1:59:06.820 --> 1:59:13.460
 to one of these Soviet republics, I think, South Asian republics.

1:59:13.460 --> 1:59:24.820
 And the book is about his experience being a prisoner,

1:59:24.820 --> 1:59:31.300
 being a patient in the cancer clinic in a cancer ward

1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:36.540
 surrounded by people, many of which die, right?

1:59:36.540 --> 1:59:42.540
 But in the way it reads, I mean, first of all,

1:59:42.540 --> 1:59:47.620
 later on I read the accounts of the doctors

1:59:47.620 --> 1:59:55.180
 who describe the experiences in the book

1:59:55.180 --> 1:59:59.380
 by the patient as incredibly accurate.

1:59:59.380 --> 2:00:04.220
 So I read that there was some doctors saying that

2:00:04.220 --> 2:00:07.060
 every single doctor should read this book

2:00:07.060 --> 2:00:10.620
 to understand what the patient feels.

2:00:10.620 --> 2:00:16.980
 But again, as many of the Solzhenitsyn's books,

2:00:16.980 --> 2:00:19.700
 it has multiple levels of complexity.

2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:26.380
 And obviously, if you look above the cancer and the patient,

2:00:26.380 --> 2:00:32.460
 I mean, the tumor that was growing and then disappeared

2:00:32.460 --> 2:00:37.660
 in his body with some consequences.

2:00:37.660 --> 2:00:44.860
 I mean, this is allegorically the Soviet...

2:00:44.860 --> 2:00:50.540
 And he actually, when he was asked, he said that

2:00:50.540 --> 2:00:56.100
 this is what made him think about this, how to combine these experiences.

2:00:56.100 --> 2:01:01.020
 Him being a part of the Soviet regime,

2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:07.900
 also being a part of someone sent to Gulag camp, right?

2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:13.100
 And also someone who experienced cancer in his life.

2:01:13.100 --> 2:01:16.540
 The Gulag archipelago and this book,

2:01:16.540 --> 2:01:22.740
 these are the works that actually made him receive a Nobel Prize.

2:01:22.740 --> 2:01:31.380
 But to me, I've read other books by Solzhenitsyn.

2:01:31.380 --> 2:01:34.700
 This one, to me, is the most powerful one.

2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:38.620
 And by the way, both this one and the previous one you read in Russian?

2:01:38.620 --> 2:01:40.220
 Yes.

2:01:40.220 --> 2:01:45.660
 So now the third book is an English book and it's completely different.

2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:48.540
 So we're switching the gears completely.

2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:52.220
 So this is the book, it's not even a book.

2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:59.580
 It's an essay by Jonathan Neumann called The Computer and the Brain.

2:01:59.580 --> 2:02:03.940
 And that was the book he was writing,

2:02:03.940 --> 2:02:07.700
 knowing that he was dying of cancer.

2:02:07.700 --> 2:02:12.260
 So the book was released back, it's a very thin book, right?

2:02:12.260 --> 2:02:21.220
 But the power, the intellectual power in this book, in this essay is incredible.

2:02:21.220 --> 2:02:28.340
 I mean, you probably know that von Neumann is considered to be one of the biggest thinkers,

2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:29.340
 right?

2:02:29.340 --> 2:02:32.740
 So his intellectual power was incredible, right?

2:02:32.740 --> 2:02:38.420
 And you can actually feel this power in this book where the person is writing, knowing

2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:41.380
 that he will die.

2:02:41.380 --> 2:02:46.300
 The book actually got published only after his death, back in 1958.

2:02:46.300 --> 2:02:48.740
 He died in 1957.

2:02:48.740 --> 2:02:59.860
 But so he tried to put as many ideas that he still hadn't realized.

2:02:59.860 --> 2:03:10.260
 And so this book is very difficult to read because every single paragraph is just compact,

2:03:10.260 --> 2:03:17.740
 is filled with these ideas and the ideas are incredible.

2:03:17.740 --> 2:03:25.660
 So nowadays, so he tried to put the parallels between the brain computing power, the neural

2:03:25.660 --> 2:03:29.500
 system and the computers as they were.

2:03:29.500 --> 2:03:33.820
 That whole year he was working on, it's like a approximately 57.

2:03:33.820 --> 2:03:39.740
 So that was right during his, when he was diagnosed with cancer and he was essentially...

2:03:39.740 --> 2:03:43.580
 Yeah, he's one of those, there's a few folks people mentioned.

2:03:43.580 --> 2:03:50.660
 I think Ed Whitton is another, that everyone that meets them, they say he's just an intellectual

2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:51.660
 powerhouse.

2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:52.660
 Yes.

2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.500
 Okay, so who's the honorable mention runner up?

2:03:55.500 --> 2:04:00.340
 And this is, I mean, the reason I put it sort of in a separate section because this

2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:08.260
 is a book that I reasonably recently listened to, so it's an audio book.

2:04:08.260 --> 2:04:12.700
 And this is a book called Lab Girl by Hope Jaren.

2:04:12.700 --> 2:04:23.860
 So Hope Jaren, she is a scientist, she's a geochemist that essentially studies the fossil

2:04:23.860 --> 2:04:26.660
 plants.

2:04:26.660 --> 2:04:35.020
 And so she uses this fossil, the chemical analysis to understand what was the climate

2:04:35.020 --> 2:04:40.580
 back in a thousand years, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

2:04:40.580 --> 2:04:49.020
 And so something that incredibly touched me by this book, it was narrated by the author.

2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:54.220
 And it's an incredibly personal story, incredibly.

2:04:54.220 --> 2:05:01.380
 So certain parts of the book, you could actually hear the author crying.

2:05:01.380 --> 2:05:05.460
 And that to me, I mean, I never experienced anything like this, you know, reading the

2:05:05.460 --> 2:05:12.940
 book, but it was like, you know, the connection between you and the author.

2:05:12.940 --> 2:05:20.620
 And I think this is, you know, this is really a must read, but even better, a must listen

2:05:20.620 --> 2:05:29.220
 to audio book for anyone who wants to learn about sort of, you know, academia, science,

2:05:29.220 --> 2:05:38.140
 and research in general, because it's a very personal account about her becoming a scientist.

2:05:38.140 --> 2:05:46.500
 So we're just before New Year's, you know, we talked a lot about some difficult topics

2:05:46.500 --> 2:05:47.860
 of viruses and so on.

2:05:47.860 --> 2:05:54.460
 Do you have some exciting things you're looking forward to in 2021?

2:05:54.460 --> 2:06:03.260
 Some New Year's resolutions, maybe silly or fun, or something very important and fundamental

2:06:03.260 --> 2:06:06.980
 to the world of science or something completely unimportant?

2:06:06.980 --> 2:06:14.780
 Well, well, I'm definitely looking forward to towards, you know, things becoming normal.

2:06:14.780 --> 2:06:15.780
 Right.

2:06:15.780 --> 2:06:21.220
 So, yes, so I really miss traveling.

2:06:21.220 --> 2:06:28.580
 Every summer, I go to a international summer school, it's called the School for Molecular

2:06:28.580 --> 2:06:34.580
 and Theoretical Biology, it's held in Europe, it's organized by very good friends of mine,

2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:40.740
 and this is the school for gifted kids from all over the world, and they're incredibly

2:06:40.740 --> 2:06:41.740
 bright.

2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:47.180
 It's like every time I go there, it's like, you know, it's a highlight of the year.

2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:55.780
 And we couldn't make it this August, so we did this school remotely, but it's different.

2:06:55.780 --> 2:07:01.100
 So I am definitely looking forward to next August coming there.

2:07:01.100 --> 2:07:07.620
 I also mean, you know, one of my, you know, personal resolutions, I realized that, you

2:07:07.620 --> 2:07:18.460
 know, being in house and working from home, you know, I realized that actually I apparently

2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:26.340
 missed a lot, you know, spending time with my family, believe it or not, so you typically,

2:07:26.340 --> 2:07:33.820
 you know, with all the research and, you know, and teaching and everything related to the

2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:38.420
 academic life, I mean, you get distracted.

2:07:38.420 --> 2:07:45.300
 And so, so, you know, you don't feel that, you know, the fact that you are away from

2:07:45.300 --> 2:07:51.140
 your family doesn't affect you because you're, you know, naturally distracted by other things.

2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:58.460
 And you know, this time, I realized that, you know, that that's so important, right?

2:07:58.460 --> 2:08:05.340
 Spending your time with the family, with your kids, and so that would be my new year resolution

2:08:05.340 --> 2:08:09.700
 in actually trying to spend as much time as possible.

2:08:09.700 --> 2:08:15.580
 Even when the world opens up, yeah, that's a beautiful message, that's a beautiful reminder.

2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:22.060
 I asked you if there's a Russian poem you could read that I could force you to read,

2:08:22.060 --> 2:08:26.420
 and you said, okay, fine, sure.

2:08:26.420 --> 2:08:27.420
 Do you mind reading?

2:08:27.420 --> 2:08:28.420
 Sure.

2:08:28.420 --> 2:08:30.860
 I mean, you said that no paper needed, so.

2:08:30.860 --> 2:08:31.860
 Nope.

2:08:31.860 --> 2:08:40.180
 So, yeah, so this poem was written by my namesake, another Dmitry, Dmitry Kemerfeldt, and is

2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:51.100
 a, you know, it's a recent poem, and it's called Sorceress, Viedma, in Russian, or actually

2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:58.460
 Kaldunia, so that's sort of another sort of connotation of Sorceress or witch.

2:08:58.460 --> 2:09:05.460
 And I really like it, and it's one of just a handful poems I actually can recall by heart.

2:09:05.460 --> 2:09:13.380
 I also have a very strong association when I read this poem with master Margarita, the

2:09:13.380 --> 2:09:18.380
 main female character, Margarita.

2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:23.700
 And also it's, you know, it's about, you know, it's happening about the same time we're talking

2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:29.820
 now, so around New Year, around Christmas.

2:09:29.820 --> 2:09:32.980
 Do you mind reading it in Russian?

2:09:32.980 --> 2:09:34.980
 I'll give it a try.

2:09:34.980 --> 2:09:58.980
 And then I'll come back.

2:09:58.980 --> 2:10:00.980
 and twisted the world.

2:10:00.980 --> 2:10:04.980
 So you took the eyes of your hero,

2:10:04.980 --> 2:10:07.980
 that anyone who came down to bless

2:10:07.980 --> 2:10:10.980
 was ready to give the devil the devil's soul

2:10:10.980 --> 2:10:13.980
 without looking at this witch's connection.

2:10:13.980 --> 2:10:16.980
 There was a thief hanging around in the bushes,

2:10:16.980 --> 2:10:19.980
 but I, without any prejudices and rags,

2:10:19.980 --> 2:10:24.980
 ran out to feel your exhaled breath on my lips,

2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:28.980
 so that the skin, with the tongue, with the ribs,

2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:32.980
 would be on the other side of the earth,

2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:35.980
 like you flew over the earth,

2:10:35.980 --> 2:10:49.980
 in Belayv Yugi, Belayzibi, Belangliya.

2:10:49.980 --> 2:10:54.980
 To me, it has a lot of meaning about this,

2:10:54.980 --> 2:10:59.980
 something that is happening, something that is far away,

2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:01.980
 but still very close to you.

2:11:01.980 --> 2:11:05.980
 And, yes, it's the winter.

2:11:05.980 --> 2:11:07.980
 There's something magical about winter, isn't there?

2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:08.980
 Yes.

2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:09.980
 What is the...

2:11:09.980 --> 2:11:10.980
 Well, I don't know.

2:11:10.980 --> 2:11:11.980
 I don't know how to translate it,

2:11:11.980 --> 2:11:15.980
 but a kiss in winter is interesting.

2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:17.980
 Lips in winter and all that kind of stuff.

2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:18.980
 It's beautifully...

2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:20.980
 I mean, Russian as a way.

2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:22.980
 As a reason, Russian poetry is just...

2:11:22.980 --> 2:11:24.980
 I'm a fan of poetry in both languages,

2:11:24.980 --> 2:11:27.980
 but English doesn't capture some of the magic

2:11:27.980 --> 2:11:30.980
 that Russian seems to, so thank you for doing that.

2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:31.980
 That was awesome.

2:11:31.980 --> 2:11:34.980
 Dimitri, it's great to talk to you again.

2:11:34.980 --> 2:11:35.980
 You're...

2:11:35.980 --> 2:11:38.980
 It's contagious how much you love what you do,

2:11:38.980 --> 2:11:39.980
 how much you love life,

2:11:39.980 --> 2:11:42.980
 so I really appreciate you taking the time to talk today.

2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:44.980
 And thank you for having me.
