 The following is a conversation with Sergey Nazarov, CEO of Chainlink, which is a decentralized

00:06.480 --> 00:10.280
 Oracle network that provides data to smart contracts.

00:10.280 --> 00:15.520
 He and his team have done seminal research and engineering in the space of smart contracts.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.240
 Check out the Chainlink 2.0 white paper that I found to be a great overview of their technology

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
 and vision.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.880
 It's 136 pages, but very accessible.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.880
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.240
 Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed, and BetterHelp.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.520
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.720
 As a side note, let me say that externally connected smart contracts that combine the

00:40.720 --> 00:45.840
 ocean of data out there with the security of the blockchain are fascinating to me, both

00:45.840 --> 00:48.560
 technically and philosophically.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.960
 Data is knowledge, and knowledge is power.

00:51.960 --> 00:58.280
 I think the more reliable data sources we integrate into our decision making, especially

00:58.280 --> 01:03.320
 when those decisions are executed by programs, the more efficient and productive our decisions

01:03.320 --> 01:04.680
 become.

01:04.680 --> 01:11.360
 There are interactions between humans that should not be formalized digitally, like love,

01:11.360 --> 01:16.520
 for example, but for all the others, there's no reason for smart contracts not to automate

01:16.520 --> 01:19.120
 away the menial parts of life.

01:19.120 --> 01:25.200
 Making more room for good conversation over brisket and maybe some vodka with old and

01:25.200 --> 01:26.920
 new friends.

01:26.920 --> 01:33.000
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Sergey Nazarov.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.480
 Is that Yosek there?

01:35.480 --> 01:41.120
 So I gave away everything I own a few times in my life, and he accidentally survived,

01:41.120 --> 01:42.800
 and I don't like stuffed animals.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.840
 What I really liked about, I got them in a thrift store, what I liked about them is

01:45.840 --> 01:50.840
 because I'd never seen a stuffed animal that looks pissed off at life.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.120
 They're usually smiling in the dumbest of ways, and this guy was just pissed.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.960
 Yeah, I gotta tell you, that's actually pretty funny.

01:58.960 --> 01:59.960
 I like this guy.

01:59.960 --> 02:06.240
 If you had to live only in the digital world or the physical world, which would you choose?

02:06.240 --> 02:10.960
 So I think this is actually a question more about what the fidelity of the digital world

02:10.960 --> 02:13.280
 would be versus the physical world.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.160
 I think this type of question and this whole simulation thing actually comes from papers

02:18.160 --> 02:23.080
 about 20, 30 years ago in the philosophical world, where people tried to make this thought

02:23.080 --> 02:27.640
 experiment of, would you be comfortable if everything that was happening to you happened

02:27.640 --> 02:28.640
 in a simulation?

02:28.640 --> 02:34.000
 What they were trying to do is they were intuitively trying to understand, is there some kind of

02:34.000 --> 02:40.440
 intuitive personal connection we have to something being the real world, right?

02:40.440 --> 02:45.520
 And then the Matrix movie actually came out of these papers, and then these ideas made

02:45.520 --> 02:47.920
 their way into the public consciousness.

02:47.920 --> 02:53.040
 I personally think that if I had the choice to be in the digital world at the same fidelity

02:53.040 --> 02:57.800
 as the real world with immortality, I would absolutely go with the digital world.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.800
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.560
 How'd you add the immortality part?

03:00.560 --> 03:01.560
 That's a...

03:01.560 --> 03:02.760
 Don't get immortality.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.480
 If you think about how we would go into the digital world, our brain patterns would be

03:06.480 --> 03:11.120
 mapped onto some kind of probably virtual machine, right?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.160
 And that would mean immortality, right?

03:13.160 --> 03:16.160
 Because the virtual machine has no limit to how long it can exist.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.720
 Well, don't you think there would be a versioning system?

03:20.720 --> 03:23.880
 This is a soft fork versus hard fork question.

03:23.880 --> 03:30.400
 Whether Sergey version 2.0 would be different from Sergey version 1.0, there would be an

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
 upgrade.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
 So that's immortality.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.120
 Sergey 1.0 would die in the digital world.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.280
 You get a software update, and then that's it.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.480
 Well, yeah.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.560
 When people go into the Star Trek transporter, are they killed or are they transported?

03:43.560 --> 03:45.000
 I don't really know.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.480
 I haven't read any papers on this.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.000
 I haven't really thought about it too much.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.360
 There's no white paper on the transporter.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.360
 Not at this point.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.800
 What does fidelity mean exactly to you?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.680
 Is it strictly...

03:55.680 --> 04:03.160
 So the fidelity of the physical world is maybe now questions of physics, quantum mechanics.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.360
 What is at the bottom of it all?

04:05.360 --> 04:07.680
 Or do you mean the fidelity of the actual experience?

04:07.680 --> 04:09.480
 It's just perception.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.480
 It's just perception.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.360
 But that's limited by human cognitive capabilities.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.120
 It is, but I don't really have anything else.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.280
 I think all of these papers that brought up these questions of assimilation, they were

04:19.280 --> 04:21.720
 like in epistemology and metaphysics.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.160
 And what they were trying to do, I think, was they were trying to put people through

04:25.160 --> 04:30.840
 a thought experiment where they would come out on the other end and say the reality of

04:30.840 --> 04:33.320
 life is really worth something.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.920
 And I don't, you know, ignorance isn't bliss, which is that consistent statement in the

04:37.920 --> 04:38.920
 matrix, right?

04:38.920 --> 04:39.920
 Ignorance is bliss.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.800
 That's what one of the guys says when he's like, you know, doing something wrong and

04:42.800 --> 04:44.880
 trying to get back into the matrix.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.840
 And the question is, is ignorance bliss?

04:47.840 --> 04:49.800
 And it's like a different version of that.

04:49.800 --> 04:55.720
 I think from a perceptual point of view, if my perceptions aren't in any way different,

04:55.720 --> 04:59.480
 so fidelity is very good, it doesn't matter.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.040
 I don't know, right?

05:01.040 --> 05:04.920
 So if I don't know something, it doesn't really exist.

05:04.920 --> 05:10.160
 And if it doesn't exist in my perception or my consciousness, then it doesn't exist.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.800
 Period for me, at least.

05:11.800 --> 05:17.080
 And then whether it exists in some, you know, more metaphysical version of things, I personally

05:17.080 --> 05:23.080
 never really got into the metaphysics stuff because I could never really, I couldn't understand

05:23.080 --> 05:25.920
 what the point of it was, right?

05:25.920 --> 05:31.880
 It's one of these things where I couldn't really get what the practical application

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
 of it was.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.320
 And this is from those realm of questions, right?

05:35.320 --> 05:39.960
 If there was something about the world, but you didn't have a capacity to perceive it,

05:39.960 --> 05:41.840
 would it matter to you?

05:41.840 --> 05:42.840
 To me, it wouldn't matter.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.840
 Right.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.880
 To me, by the way, the simulation thing is a really interesting engineering question,

05:47.880 --> 05:54.720
 which is how difficult is it to engineer a virtual reality, a digital world that is

05:54.720 --> 05:59.040
 sufficiently of high fidelity where you would want to live in it?

05:59.040 --> 06:02.960
 I think that's a really testable and a fascinating engineering question.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.680
 Because my intuition says like it's not as difficult as we think.

06:06.680 --> 06:11.800
 It's not nearly as difficult as having to create a quantum mechanical simulation that's

06:11.800 --> 06:14.640
 large enough to capture the full human experience.

06:14.640 --> 06:19.840
 It might be just as simple as just a really nice quake game.

06:19.840 --> 06:25.200
 Like with a nice engine that's just creating all the basic visual elements that trick our

06:25.200 --> 06:31.960
 cognizance, our visual cortex into believing that we're actually in the physical environment.

06:31.960 --> 06:37.960
 And I think that if that's true, then that's quite, you know, that a high fidelity digital

06:37.960 --> 06:43.000
 world is actually achievable within a century.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.520
 And that changes things.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.520
 Yeah, yeah.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.000
 Maybe in our lifetime.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
 I'm really hoping for that.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.280
 I'm hoping somebody can copy my brainwaves onto a virtual machine and allow that consciousness

06:54.280 --> 06:59.200
 to continue to exist, whether that's death or not, I don't know.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.400
 But I think it's actually going to require some serious leaps.

07:03.400 --> 07:10.000
 Like even the VR headsets, they don't work if they go below 90 frame rates.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.240
 People start getting freaked out.

07:11.240 --> 07:17.800
 So you have to go from one gaming screen of, you know, 60 frames per second to two screens

07:17.800 --> 07:19.400
 of 90 frames per second.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.320
 And so the people's hardware today can't even handle that.

07:22.320 --> 07:27.720
 And that's for these two little screens by your eyeballs, what it's going to take to

07:27.720 --> 07:32.080
 like, you know, completely trick my consciousness into not knowing the difference in terms of

07:32.080 --> 07:35.920
 like, you know, all the sensory inputs.

07:35.920 --> 07:41.480
 I'm keeping my fingers crossed, whoever does that and is close to doing that, they should

07:41.480 --> 07:42.640
 contact me.

07:42.640 --> 07:47.040
 I want to have my brainwaves turned into a virtual machine.

07:47.040 --> 07:52.440
 Would you in that context, if Morpheus came to you, would you take the blue pill or the

07:52.440 --> 08:00.120
 red pill, meaning would you be happy just living in that world and not knowing that you're

08:00.120 --> 08:05.160
 living inside that virtual world that's running a computer, or would you want to know the

08:05.160 --> 08:06.160
 truth of it?

08:06.160 --> 08:10.120
 Well, actually, I think that's a very different question, right?

08:10.120 --> 08:14.600
 There's actually a moral ethical question there about whether you should allow a bunch

08:14.600 --> 08:18.480
 of people to get, you know, manipulated and killed and enslaved, because in the matrix

08:18.480 --> 08:26.840
 they're all enslaved and as like a AAA battery to turn a human being into the battery, right?

08:26.840 --> 08:32.680
 So I think the moral and ethical question of that, fascinating enough, isn't actually

08:32.680 --> 08:38.200
 different than the moral ethical questions we face today in modern daily life, but I

08:38.200 --> 08:43.440
 probably have given the choice of just completely going along or going against it.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.240
 I would probably go against it if I had to make this kind of binary choice.

08:48.240 --> 08:55.800
 Because going along with it, I think at that scale of scary, you know, stuff happening

08:55.800 --> 09:00.120
 to people is probably something really, really, really difficult.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.320
 But for your individual life, it's way more fun to go along with it.

09:03.320 --> 09:11.720
 So you're saying you value the opposing a system that includes the suffering of others

09:11.720 --> 09:15.440
 versus just for yourself enjoying the ride.

09:15.440 --> 09:21.880
 I mean, what's, if there is such a binary choice, why choose the opposing system?

09:21.880 --> 09:26.160
 I think it's the nature of kind of the ethical dilemma that you face in that situation.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.880
 There's kind of some, you know, this is obviously not something that's happening now, right?

09:29.880 --> 09:30.880
 We don't know this, right?

09:30.880 --> 09:40.880
 At the end of the day, at that scale of something like that happening, yeah, that scale of people

09:40.880 --> 09:47.080
 being manipulated and harmed, then I think pretty much almost all people have an obligation

09:47.080 --> 09:50.600
 to go against it.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.760
 Probably that's what that looks like, in my opinion.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.800
 So you've talked about the concept of definitive truth.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.800
 What is it?

09:58.800 --> 10:02.040
 In general, what is the nature of truth in human civilization?

10:02.040 --> 10:09.480
 And just talking about the digital age, the nature of truth in the digital age.

10:09.480 --> 10:14.880
 So the interesting thing about definitive truth is that it actually exists on this,

10:14.880 --> 10:20.440
 at least in my mind, on this spectrum between objective truth and just, you know, somebody

10:20.440 --> 10:22.960
 made something up and nobody else agrees.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.280
 So what I think definitive truth is, is it somewhere in the middle on that spectrum,

10:27.280 --> 10:33.240
 where if you and me define what truth is, right, like if you and me have an agreement

10:33.240 --> 10:40.000
 of some kind, and we say, as long as the weather is sunny, or the weather isn't, there is no

10:40.000 --> 10:44.600
 rain on that day, then there will be an insurance policy that results.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.760
 And you and me both agree that as long as three sensors, three monitoring weather monitoring

10:49.760 --> 10:56.240
 stations all say that, then the definitive truth for us and for that agreement is the

10:56.240 --> 11:01.920
 result of those systems coming to consensus about what happened out in the real world.

11:01.920 --> 11:08.880
 I think the objective truth definition from kind of the philosophical world is really,

11:08.880 --> 11:12.280
 really stringent and very, very hard to attain.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.960
 And that's not what this is.

11:13.960 --> 11:19.040
 And that's actually not what commerce or the ability for people to interact about contracts

11:19.040 --> 11:20.280
 needs.

11:20.280 --> 11:26.680
 But I think the world of commerce needs is an upgrade from someone can you'd and laterally

11:26.680 --> 11:34.880
 decide what the truth is to there can be a preagreed set of conditions where we define

11:34.880 --> 11:38.000
 what the truth is under those conditions.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.600
 And then, you know, you and me basically say, if these 20 nodes are of these 30 data sources

11:43.600 --> 11:48.480
 come to consensus within, you know, this method of consensus with this threshold of agreement,

11:48.480 --> 11:53.400
 then definitive truth has been achieved for you and me in our relationship for this specific

11:53.400 --> 12:00.640
 agreement and the specificity and our shared agreement to that kind of truth or that definitive

12:00.640 --> 12:08.320
 truth being acceptable to both of us is probably what's kind of necessary and sufficient for

12:08.320 --> 12:10.800
 everything to move forward in a better way.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.760
 In any case, much better than, you know, I'm a bank or an insurance company, I'm going

12:14.760 --> 12:17.200
 to unilaterally decide what happens.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.840
 It's definitely an upgrade from that.

12:18.840 --> 12:23.440
 Do you think it's possible to define formally in this way a definitive truth for many things

12:23.440 --> 12:24.440
 in this world?

12:24.440 --> 12:29.240
 Like you talked about whether it's basically defining that if three sensors of whether

12:29.240 --> 12:34.960
 agree, then that we're going to agree that that is a definitive, useful truth for us

12:34.960 --> 12:36.780
 to operate under.

12:36.780 --> 12:41.760
 So how many things in this world can be formalized in this way, do you think?

12:41.760 --> 12:48.720
 A huge amount, so there's actually two things going on here.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.040
 One thing is the amount of data that already exists, right?

12:52.040 --> 12:58.320
 And the pieces of data coming off of, you know, markets, IoT, shipment of goods, any

12:58.320 --> 12:59.320
 number of other things.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.760
 Like even your YouTube channel has a certain amount of likes or a certain amount of clicks

13:03.760 --> 13:06.640
 or a certain amount of views and even that's quantifiable, right?

13:06.640 --> 13:11.680
 So even to a certain degree, what we do here today, you and me right now can be quantified

13:11.680 --> 13:14.840
 as far as the amount of views, the amount of clicks, the amount of any number of other

13:14.840 --> 13:15.840
 things.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.800
 Yeah, you, the viewer have power of data in your hands by clicking like or dislike right

13:19.800 --> 13:25.080
 now or the subscribe button or the unsubscribe button, which I encourage you to do.

13:25.080 --> 13:29.440
 Anyway, okay, so there's data flowing into all interactions in this world.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
 There's data.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.720
 There's more and more data, right?

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
 More and more data.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.720
 More and more data.

13:33.720 --> 13:38.400
 That data is more and more accessible to everybody and that accessibility and the fact that

13:38.400 --> 13:42.900
 there's more of it means we can form more definitive truth proofs.

13:42.900 --> 13:47.440
 We can form more and more proofs and as we form those proofs, well, we can provide them

13:47.440 --> 13:51.880
 to these blockchains and smart contract systems that consume them and then they're tamper

13:51.880 --> 13:52.880
 proof, right?

13:52.880 --> 13:54.400
 So they can't be manipulated.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.480
 And so now we've combined a system that can prove things with a system that guarantees

13:58.480 --> 14:05.320
 a certain outcomes and we have a better system of contracts, which is actually an unbelievably

14:05.320 --> 14:08.640
 powerful tool that has never existed before.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.400
 Can we talk about the world of commerce and finance, decentralized finance?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.320
 What is it?

14:15.320 --> 14:20.720
 What's its promise from both the philosophical and technical perspective, if we just zoom

14:20.720 --> 14:23.680
 in on that particular space of the digital world?

14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
 Sure.

14:24.680 --> 14:30.920
 So the decentralized finance is the instantiation of a specific type of contract, smart contract,

14:30.920 --> 14:31.920
 right?

14:31.920 --> 14:35.720
 They're called hybrid smart contracts, which are these contracts that combine the on chain

14:35.720 --> 14:40.120
 code together with the off chain proofs that something happened.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.880
 That's they're called a hybrid because they basically use both of these systems, right?

14:43.880 --> 14:47.240
 The blockchain and the proofs about what happened.

14:47.240 --> 14:55.920
 And what DeFi is is one specific type of hybrid smart contract that is taking on the contractual

14:55.920 --> 15:01.720
 agreements you traditionally find in the financial global financial system, right?

15:01.720 --> 15:06.240
 And that's basically the world of lending, the world of yield generation for people

15:06.240 --> 15:11.720
 giving me or giving whoever their money and somebody giving back them yield back to them,

15:11.720 --> 15:15.120
 which is what bonds do and what treasury is doing, what a lot of the global financial

15:15.120 --> 15:21.500
 markets do, as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection from different types

15:21.500 --> 15:23.200
 of events and risks.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.120
 That's a lot of what derivatives do, right?

15:25.120 --> 15:28.640
 Derivatives allow us to say, hey, something's going to happen and I'm either going to protect

15:28.640 --> 15:34.160
 myself by getting paid if it happens or I'm going to benefit from it happening by basically

15:34.160 --> 15:37.080
 saying it's going to happen, putting money down on that and that prediction will get

15:37.080 --> 15:38.960
 me a return.

15:38.960 --> 15:44.200
 Now that's a very large part of the global financial system, excluding all the stuff

15:44.200 --> 15:48.200
 for global trade and letters of credit and all the stuff that facilitates international

15:48.200 --> 15:49.200
 trade.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.060
 So excluding that at least for now.

15:51.060 --> 15:55.600
 So if we look at what decentralized finance does, it takes all of those agreements about

15:55.600 --> 15:59.760
 generating yield, lending, and all of these types of things you find in global finance

15:59.760 --> 16:04.160
 and the world of derivatives and a few other types of financial products.

16:04.160 --> 16:08.080
 And it basically puts them into a different format, right?

16:08.080 --> 16:13.520
 So the format you have for centralized financial agreements is that you go to a bank, even

16:13.520 --> 16:17.560
 if you're a hedge fund, even if you're like the richest people, you go to a bank, they

16:17.560 --> 16:21.880
 make a product for you and you hope that they honor the product that they made for you.

16:21.880 --> 16:26.720
 Or you do a deal with another hedge fund or whoever, some counterparty and you hope that

16:26.720 --> 16:29.320
 that deal is honored.

16:29.320 --> 16:33.920
 And then a number of very freaky things start to take place.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.920
 One of them is people don't have clarity about what the agreement is, right?

16:38.920 --> 16:45.120
 So a lot of people don't know exactly what the agreement is between those parties because

16:45.120 --> 16:47.160
 they can't actually see it.

16:47.160 --> 16:50.920
 Sometimes agreements are kept very private or parts of them are kept private and that

16:50.920 --> 16:54.760
 keeps other counterparties, other people in the system from understanding what's going

16:54.760 --> 16:55.760
 on.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.240
 This is actually partly what happened with the mortgage crisis.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.560
 The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically, there were a lot of agreements, there were

17:01.560 --> 17:06.360
 a lot of assets, but because the centralized financial system worked in such an opaque

17:06.360 --> 17:11.240
 way, it was so unbelievably difficult to understand what was going on, right?

17:11.240 --> 17:14.480
 And so that lack of understanding for the global financial system basically led to a

17:14.480 --> 17:20.280
 big boom and then correspondingly, very, very big bust, which amazingly enough had a huge

17:20.280 --> 17:25.920
 impact on everybody even though they didn't participate in the boom part of the equation.

17:25.920 --> 17:31.520
 In any case, what decentralized finance does is it takes these financial contracts that

17:31.520 --> 17:36.360
 power the global financial system, it puts them in this new blockchain based format that

17:36.360 --> 17:39.920
 basically at this point provides three very powerful things.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.040
 The first thing that it provides is complete transparency over what's going on with your

17:44.040 --> 17:45.400
 financial product.

17:45.400 --> 17:49.840
 So this means when you use a financial product in the DeFi format, you and you as a technical

17:49.840 --> 17:55.240
 person actually can drill down very, very, very deeply and you can understand where the

17:55.240 --> 17:58.480
 collateral is, you can understand how much collateral there is, you can understand what

17:58.480 --> 18:02.840
 format it's in, you can understand how it's changing, you can understand this on a second

18:02.840 --> 18:05.320
 to second or block to block basis, right?

18:05.320 --> 18:11.320
 So you have complete transparency into what's going on in the financial protocol that you

18:11.320 --> 18:16.520
 have your assets in, which is because blockchains and infrastructure, all of these things are

18:16.520 --> 18:19.880
 built on, force that transparency, right?

18:19.880 --> 18:23.560
 Whereas the centralized financial system is very, very good at hiding it.

18:23.560 --> 18:28.880
 It's very good at hiding it and packaging things in a glossy wrapper, creating a boom

18:28.880 --> 18:30.360
 then a bust.

18:30.360 --> 18:35.160
 The centralized finance is built on infrastructure that forces transparency such that everyone

18:35.160 --> 18:39.440
 can understand what the financial product does from day one and in fact escaping that

18:39.440 --> 18:44.240
 property is practically impossible or if someone tries to escape it, it becomes immediately

18:44.240 --> 18:47.040
 obvious and people don't use their financial product.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.840
 So that's number one.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.760
 Number two is control.

18:50.760 --> 18:55.120
 So if you look at what happened with Robinhood, everybody thought the system worked a certain

18:55.120 --> 18:56.120
 way, right?

18:56.120 --> 19:00.680
 Everybody thought I have a brokerage account, I can trade things under a certain set of

19:00.680 --> 19:07.120
 market conditions and then the market conditions changed within the band of what people thought

19:07.120 --> 19:11.960
 they could do and everybody was fascinated to find out that, oh my God, I thought my

19:11.960 --> 19:17.880
 band of market conditions in which I can control my assets is X but it is actually Y, is actually

19:17.880 --> 19:24.440
 much, much smaller band and the reason it is a much, much smaller group of market conditions

19:24.440 --> 19:28.280
 is that the system doesn't work the way people think it works.

19:28.280 --> 19:32.280
 The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper and given to them to get them to participate

19:32.280 --> 19:36.000
 in the system because the system requires and needs their participation.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.440
 But if you actually look at how the system works underneath, you will see that it does

19:40.440 --> 19:43.360
 not work the way people think that it works.

19:43.360 --> 19:48.160
 And this is actually another reason that DeFi is so powerful because DeFi actually and these

19:48.160 --> 19:54.160
 blockchain contracts give people the version of the world they think they already have,

19:54.160 --> 19:56.600
 which is why they don't beg for it, right?

19:56.600 --> 20:00.600
 So everybody thinks they're in a certain version of the world that works in this reliable,

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
 transparent way.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
 They're not.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.080
 They don't realize it.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.040
 And so they're confused when you tell them, I'm going to make the world work this way

20:07.040 --> 20:08.720
 because they think they're already in that world.

20:08.720 --> 20:13.680
 But then things like Robinhood make it immediately painfully clear that that's not how the world

20:13.680 --> 20:19.080
 works so that the second real property of DeFi is control, which means that you control

20:19.080 --> 20:25.040
 your assets, not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you, you control your bitcoins,

20:25.040 --> 20:27.440
 you control your tokens and the finance protocol.

20:27.440 --> 20:31.200
 If you don't like how something's going in that protocol, you can remove it.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.000
 You can send it to another protocol or you can use a feature of the protocol to do something

20:35.000 --> 20:36.160
 it's supposed to do.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.160
 And guess what?

20:37.160 --> 20:40.840
 You just say, oops, you know, that feature, that isn't so good for my friends over here.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.120
 You know, that feature is actually, you know, we're just going to pause that feature in

20:44.120 --> 20:49.560
 the critical moment when you need it to, to, to, to execute your, you know, your strategy,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.360
 which is why you took all the risk to begin with.

20:52.360 --> 20:57.520
 And then the final reason, you know, the final thing to know about DeFi is that DeFi is

20:57.520 --> 21:03.040
 inherently global and actually right now provides better yield globally.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.920
 So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar, you get 1% or less.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.880
 If you go to DeFi with the US dollar, you get 7% or 8%.

21:12.880 --> 21:18.160
 So if we think about that in a world where there's a lot of inflation coming down the

21:18.160 --> 21:26.080
 road and we think about, well, you know, a lot more systems might be failing soon and

21:26.080 --> 21:31.280
 they might be highlighting this types of problems that were there for, or as a result of the

21:31.280 --> 21:35.040
 type of control that you see in, in, in Robinhood.

21:35.040 --> 21:40.160
 And people are more and more concerned about both transparency and control and they're

21:40.160 --> 21:43.040
 looking for yield to combat inflation.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.880
 I think that's what DeFi is about in a practical sense.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.960
 It is this clarity about your risk.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.680
 It is control over your assets.

21:51.680 --> 21:56.960
 And amazingly at the same time as having those two unbelievably useful properties, it is

21:56.960 --> 22:02.960
 actually superior yield, which, which, which, which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion

22:02.960 --> 22:08.400
 that the only reason DeFi is more used is because more people don't know about it.

22:08.400 --> 22:13.760
 And by virtue of this long kind of, you know, explanation here and here and elsewhere, more

22:13.760 --> 22:15.160
 people will know about it.

22:15.160 --> 22:19.660
 And it's just such an obviously superior solution that I haven't heard a single explanation

22:19.660 --> 22:25.680
 as to why, no, no, don't earn 8% and take less risk and have more transparency with

22:25.680 --> 22:32.080
 your assets, earn 7% less, take more risk and give people the ability to change the

22:32.080 --> 22:34.440
 rules on you at their discretion.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.440
 Go do that.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.360
 Who's going to do that?

22:37.360 --> 22:42.200
 And in general, on the first two of transparency and control, first of all, I do think maybe

22:42.200 --> 22:47.760
 you can correct me, but from my perspective, they're, they're like deeply tied together

22:47.760 --> 22:51.280
 in the sense that transparency gives control.

22:51.280 --> 22:56.000
 It creates accountability and, and there's this kind of game being played game, game

22:56.000 --> 23:00.760
 theoretic game where if I know, if you know, I'm going to discover your deviation, you're

23:00.760 --> 23:02.120
 not going to deviate.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.360
 Yes.

23:03.360 --> 23:07.720
 This could be a whole nother conversation, but just as a small aside on the social network

23:07.720 --> 23:14.080
 side of things, which I've been thinking deeply about in the past year or so of how to do

23:14.080 --> 23:18.480
 it right there, how to fix our social media.

23:18.480 --> 23:25.600
 And I tend to believe that human beings, if they're given clear transparency about which

23:25.600 --> 23:31.240
 data is being stored, how it's being used, where it's being moved about, just all a clear

23:31.240 --> 23:39.760
 simple transparency of how their data is being used and them having the control at the very

23:39.760 --> 23:45.340
 minimal level of being able to participate or to walk away and walk away means delete

23:45.340 --> 23:48.280
 everything you ever known about me.

23:48.280 --> 23:53.640
 And that will create a much, much better world that currently there's a complete lack of

23:53.640 --> 23:57.320
 transparency in social media, how the data is being used for your own protection.

23:57.320 --> 24:02.120
 I mean, there's a lot of parallels to the central bank situation and there's not a control

24:02.120 --> 24:04.120
 element of being able to walk away.

24:04.120 --> 24:09.440
 Like being able to delete all your data, delete your account on Facebook is very difficult.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.880
 It doesn't take a single click, which I think is what it should take.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.800
 There should be a big red button that says delete everything you've ever known about

24:16.800 --> 24:19.320
 me or like, forget me.

24:19.320 --> 24:24.080
 So I think that couple together can create a very different kind of world and create

24:24.080 --> 24:31.400
 an incentivization that will lead to like progress and innovation and just like a much

24:31.400 --> 24:37.880
 better social network and a really good business for the future social networks.

24:37.880 --> 24:47.720
 But so I tend to see like control as naturally being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency.

24:47.720 --> 24:53.920
 It should all start at the transparency, which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating

24:53.920 --> 25:00.720
 because like you're formalizing in a simple, clear way any agreements that you're participating

25:00.720 --> 25:01.720
 in.

25:01.720 --> 25:07.200
 And as a side comment also, what's really inspiring to me is that I think there's a

25:07.200 --> 25:11.320
 greater, I don't know if this is always the case, but it seems like from having talked

25:11.320 --> 25:22.040
 to people on the psychological element, there's a hunger amongst people for transparency and

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
 for control.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.280
 Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity.

25:26.280 --> 25:32.120
 If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now, they want to know the reality

25:32.120 --> 25:33.880
 of who you are as an individual.

25:33.880 --> 25:39.960
 So that means you can create businesses, you can create tools that are built on authenticity

25:39.960 --> 25:41.460
 or transparency.

25:41.460 --> 25:46.960
 And then the same I'm inspired by the intelligence of people.

25:46.960 --> 25:52.920
 If you give them control, if you give them power that they would make good choices.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
 That's really exciting.

25:53.920 --> 26:01.760
 Of course, not everybody, but that means that decentralized power can create effective systems.

26:01.760 --> 26:05.440
 So a couple of that, there's a hunger for transparency, so we can move to a world where

26:05.440 --> 26:11.360
 everyone's being just like real, conveying their genuine human nature.

26:11.360 --> 26:17.480
 And people are sufficiently intelligent that if they're given power in a distributed mass

26:17.480 --> 26:23.480
 scale sense that we're going to build a better world to that as opposed to centralized, supervised

26:23.480 --> 26:27.880
 control or only a small percent of the population know what the hell they're doing.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.960
 Everybody else is clueless sheep.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.600
 So those two coupled together is really to me inspiring.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.600
 Just a really quickly comment on the stuff that you just said, which I think is super,

26:38.600 --> 26:40.400
 super, super fascinating.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.720
 I think that's all exactly right.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.800
 I think everything that you said is right.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.520
 And I think it's actually going to be the same for social media and banking and every

26:47.520 --> 26:53.360
 other type of contract is that all of those systems that house people's value for them

26:53.360 --> 26:58.560
 and take control of either their social media value or their financial value or whatever

26:58.560 --> 27:03.680
 for them, all of that is going to be made available to people in like this autonomous

27:03.680 --> 27:08.920
 piece of code that does the same thing that the centralized entity used to do.

27:08.920 --> 27:14.720
 So they get all the features, but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability to have

27:14.720 --> 27:18.120
 control while getting all the features, right?

27:18.120 --> 27:23.080
 So banks give you features, social media sites give you features, you know, whatever other

27:23.080 --> 27:25.680
 system that you use online gives you features.

27:25.680 --> 27:30.560
 And then it takes your data and it takes control of your assets from you in return for those

27:30.560 --> 27:32.240
 features, right?

27:32.240 --> 27:36.200
 I think the whole big difference here partly in line with, you know, the definition of

27:36.200 --> 27:42.320
 smart contracts and its evolution is that there's this autonomous piece of code that's

27:42.320 --> 27:49.640
 giving you all those features without requiring the ownership and lock in and control and

27:49.640 --> 27:57.160
 unilateral kind of ownership of your data or your value or whatever it is that you're

27:57.160 --> 27:58.960
 giving it, right?

27:58.960 --> 28:05.080
 And I think what this will lead to fundamentally is just more of a free market dynamic among

28:05.080 --> 28:11.000
 how people make, I think with the social media folks, you should just make some kind of law

28:11.000 --> 28:14.640
 or something where you can just export all your data from them.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.840
 Everyone should be able to get their data exported by another application.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.720
 And then the network effect of all these social media sites will kind of crumble because people

28:22.720 --> 28:27.280
 will just combine your Twitter data with your Facebook data with everything else into an

28:27.280 --> 28:29.160
 application that you control.

28:29.160 --> 28:33.160
 And there will just be thousands of different interfaces competing for how to consume all

28:33.160 --> 28:38.520
 the social media data because it isn't locked in in one centralized actor's control.

28:38.520 --> 28:42.920
 And so this is just the recurring pattern of what I think all of this will do is it'll

28:42.920 --> 28:46.040
 give people a better deal, right?

28:46.040 --> 28:51.800
 It gives them features without ownership of data, without ownership of value, and that's

28:51.800 --> 28:53.720
 really the difference.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.680
 So I think this is a good place to talk about smart contracts then.

28:56.680 --> 29:01.720
 Can you tell me the history of smart contracts and the basic sort of definitions of what

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
 is it?

29:02.720 --> 29:03.720
 Sure.

29:03.720 --> 29:08.160
 So I think smart contracts as a definition has actually gone through some kind of changes

29:08.160 --> 29:09.840
 or a small evolution.

29:09.840 --> 29:14.840
 Initially, I think it was actually a conception of a digital agreement that was tamper proof

29:14.840 --> 29:17.180
 and could know things about the world, right?

29:17.180 --> 29:21.560
 So it could get proof and it could define that something happened and it could conclude

29:21.560 --> 29:24.280
 an outcome and release payment or do something else.

29:24.280 --> 29:28.360
 That's actually the definition of smart contracts that I began working in this industry with

29:28.360 --> 29:31.640
 seven or eight years ago when I started making smart contracts.

29:31.640 --> 29:35.320
 That is the conception that I had of a smart contract.

29:35.320 --> 29:39.160
 Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?

29:39.160 --> 29:42.680
 Building that type of tamper proof digital agreement that could also know things about

29:42.680 --> 29:48.000
 the real world and release payments back to people about those events that were codified

29:48.000 --> 29:52.440
 in this tamper proof format was actually a very tall order, turns out it's consistent

29:52.440 --> 29:53.440
 of three parts.

29:53.440 --> 29:58.520
 It's consisting of the contract, the proof about what happened, and the release of value.

29:58.520 --> 30:04.600
 The way things have evolved so far is that the definition has now come to mean on chain

30:04.600 --> 30:05.600
 code, right?

30:05.600 --> 30:11.720
 So it's come to mean the codification of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?

30:11.720 --> 30:17.680
 So there's some code somewhere on some blockchain that defines what the agreement is.

30:17.680 --> 30:22.280
 Now that eliminates the part of the definition that's related to knowing things about the

30:22.280 --> 30:26.960
 world and it partly eliminates the definition about payments and stuff like that.

30:26.960 --> 30:30.680
 But basically it's on chain code, right?

30:30.680 --> 30:36.040
 We in our recent work on a second white paper have actually put out a different definition

30:36.040 --> 30:41.400
 that we call hybrid smart contracts that actually tries to go back to the initial definition

30:41.400 --> 30:46.400
 that I started with seven or eight years ago, which basically says that there's some proof

30:46.400 --> 30:50.480
 somewhere that's proven to the contract and the contract can know that and the contract

30:50.480 --> 30:51.980
 can gain proof.

30:51.980 --> 30:57.640
 Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement that's codified on a blockchain.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.480
 So you both need a mechanism to provide proof.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.360
 You need a mechanism to codify the contract in a tamper proof way on something like a

31:04.360 --> 31:05.600
 blockchain.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.360
 And then as with all contracts, there's a presumption that there's some kind of release

31:08.360 --> 31:09.600
 of value.

31:09.600 --> 31:15.600
 So I think a smart contract in our industry right now means on chain code, which limits

31:15.600 --> 31:19.160
 it to whatever can be done on chain only.

31:19.160 --> 31:24.840
 And then in our internal definition for us and for us a chain link and for me, it's

31:24.840 --> 31:29.160
 hybrid smart contracts, which is actually the original definition.

31:29.160 --> 31:35.800
 It's the idea that a contract can both know what happened and automatically resolve to

31:35.800 --> 31:38.120
 the proper outcome based on what happened.

31:38.120 --> 31:44.160
 So you're referring to the chain link 2.0 white paper, which is a paper that I recommend

31:44.160 --> 31:49.080
 people look as a very easy read and very well structured and very thorough.

31:49.080 --> 31:53.120
 So I really enjoyed it very recently released, I guess.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
 Can you dig in deeper?

31:54.120 --> 31:57.200
 What is a hybrid smart contract?

31:57.200 --> 32:04.840
 You mentioned sort of this idea of data or knowing about the world and on chain and off

32:04.840 --> 32:06.000
 chain.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.760
 So what are the different roles in this?

32:07.760 --> 32:14.920
 So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact that it's on chain and off chain contracts.

32:14.920 --> 32:20.160
 So maybe digging deeper of what the heck is it and what does it mean to know stuff about

32:20.160 --> 32:21.160
 the world?

32:21.160 --> 32:23.560
 Like, how do you actually achieve that?

32:23.560 --> 32:26.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.800
 So the on chain part is where the agreement itself is.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.080
 That's the smart contract itself.

32:33.080 --> 32:38.560
 And that's where you codify certain conditions such as the conditions under which an interest

32:38.560 --> 32:42.440
 payment is made or the conditions under which the contract pays out the full amount that

32:42.440 --> 32:47.200
 it holds to someone based on a derivative outcome or something like that.

32:47.200 --> 32:51.600
 Now what the on chain code is very good at is creating transparency about what the core

32:51.600 --> 32:54.080
 conditions of the contract are.

32:54.080 --> 32:59.000
 It's very good at taking in money from other private keys that send it tokens and send

32:59.000 --> 33:00.960
 it value to hold.

33:00.960 --> 33:06.400
 And then it's also very good at returning money or returning value back to other addresses

33:06.400 --> 33:08.080
 or other private keys.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.600
 It can also be involved in governance, it can be involved in a few other private key signature

33:11.600 --> 33:18.440
 based operations, but primarily the on chain part of a hybrid smart contract from what

33:18.440 --> 33:24.360
 I've seen so far defines the agreement takes in value and returns value based upon the

33:24.360 --> 33:27.600
 conditions codified in the agreement on a blockchain.

33:27.600 --> 33:33.960
 The second and equally important off chain part is where the term oracle and oracle comes

33:33.960 --> 33:39.520
 in or an oracle mechanism or a decentralized oracle network as we describe it in the paper.

33:39.520 --> 33:46.200
 And this is another decentralized computational system that has a different goal.

33:46.200 --> 33:51.520
 So blockchains have the goal of packaging transactions into blocks and connecting them

33:51.520 --> 33:57.640
 in a cryptographically unique way to create security and assurance about that chain of

33:57.640 --> 34:04.760
 transactions oracles and decentralized oracle networks achieve consensus and they achieve

34:04.760 --> 34:09.080
 decentralization about the topic of what happened.

34:09.080 --> 34:14.240
 So blockchains structure transactions, some of those transactions might be the state changes

34:14.240 --> 34:23.240
 in different pieces of on chain code and then those on chain pieces of code require input.

34:23.240 --> 34:27.800
 I think the thing that people get kind of a little bit thrown by is despite being called

34:27.800 --> 34:35.640
 smart contracts, the on chain code on a blockchain cannot actually speak to any other system.

34:35.640 --> 34:40.880
 So blockchains are valuable and useful as far as their tamper proof and secure and to

34:40.880 --> 34:45.840
 be tamper proof and secure, they're made this kind of walled garden that is able to know

34:45.840 --> 34:52.040
 and interact only with the highly reliable information that's within that system, which

34:52.040 --> 34:56.400
 is basically tokens and private key signatures.

34:56.400 --> 35:02.760
 All the other worlds information is not available in a blockchain inherently and a smart contract

35:02.760 --> 35:06.760
 or a piece of on chain code can't just say, Hey, I'm going to go get some data from over

35:06.760 --> 35:11.680
 here because the API they would get it from creates a whole bunch of security concerns

35:11.680 --> 35:16.440
 for the blockchain itself and a whole bunch of consensus issues about how to agree on

35:16.440 --> 35:19.400
 what that API said or what the truth of the world is, right?

35:19.400 --> 35:22.480
 Because it's not even agreeing on what one API said.

35:22.480 --> 35:28.360
 It's more so creating a reliable form of decentralized computation that can give you a definitive

35:28.360 --> 35:31.840
 proof of what happened and not just what one API said.

35:31.840 --> 35:36.040
 So for example, some of our most widely used networks have well over 30 nodes and well over

35:36.040 --> 35:40.760
 10 data sources that are all providing information about the same type of data.

35:40.760 --> 35:45.480
 And then there's consensus on that one piece of data, which is then written in and essentially

35:45.480 --> 35:50.720
 given back into the on chain code to tell it what happened because you can't really

35:50.720 --> 35:54.280
 make an agreement unless you know what happened, right?

35:54.280 --> 35:58.240
 If you and me were to make an agreement and set some contractual conditions, but our agreement

35:58.240 --> 36:00.280
 could never know what happened.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.320
 It would be completely useless.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.920
 However, if you and me made an agreement and there was another system called an Oracle

36:05.920 --> 36:10.720
 mechanism or decentralized Oracle network that proved what happened definitively and

36:10.720 --> 36:15.960
 you and me preagreed that whatever this mechanism says is what happened, then we can achieve

36:15.960 --> 36:18.800
 an entirely new level of automation, right?

36:18.800 --> 36:23.580
 We can suddenly say there's this piece of on chain code that's highly reliable.

36:23.580 --> 36:28.960
 We can give it millions, billions, eventually trillions of dollars in value and it is controlled

36:28.960 --> 36:33.760
 by this other system over here that's also highly reliable under this configurable set

36:33.760 --> 36:38.640
 of definitive truth and decentralization conditions, which we all agree are sufficiently

36:38.640 --> 36:41.480
 stringent to control that much value.

36:41.480 --> 36:46.200
 And therefore the combination of this tamper proof on chain representation of a contract

36:46.200 --> 36:54.840
 and this mutually agreed upon definition of a trigger or a proof system combined is a

36:54.840 --> 37:01.560
 hybrid smart contract, which as you can see probably already does a lot more than just

37:01.560 --> 37:04.000
 a contract on chain, right?

37:04.000 --> 37:07.680
 Can you talk about this consensus mechanism, which by the way is just fascinating.

37:07.680 --> 37:14.840
 So there is the on chain consensus mechanism of proof of work and proof of stake.

37:14.840 --> 37:24.080
 And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism of what is true.

37:24.080 --> 37:28.920
 So how do you, can you compare the two, like how do you achieve that kind of consensus?

37:28.920 --> 37:37.840
 How do you achieve security in integrating data about the world in a way that's definitively

37:37.840 --> 37:44.400
 true in a way that is usefully true such that we can rely on it in making major agreements

37:44.400 --> 37:48.760
 that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars, right?

37:48.760 --> 37:51.960
 So this is the challenging, this is the challenging question, right?

37:51.960 --> 37:58.720
 This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks, oracles, we had chain link that

37:58.720 --> 38:04.200
 we work on in order to create this definitive truth to trigger and create hyper automation

38:04.200 --> 38:09.560
 in this more advanced form, more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts.

38:09.560 --> 38:16.680
 The reality I think of this problem is that it is very specific to each use case.

38:16.680 --> 38:23.080
 And this is actually how we've architected our system is in a very flexible way.

38:23.080 --> 38:28.720
 So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network to grow in the amount of nodes

38:28.720 --> 38:33.240
 that it has relative to the value it secures, right?

38:33.240 --> 38:40.360
 So if you have an Oracle network that secures $100,000 in like a beta of a financial product,

38:40.360 --> 38:44.600
 maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes and only two or three data sources, right?

38:44.600 --> 38:51.040
 Because the risk to that Oracle network is relatively low based on the value it secures.

38:51.040 --> 38:58.480
 So the first question is actually how do you scale security relative to value secured by

38:58.480 --> 39:03.160
 that Oracle network, because it wouldn't be very efficient to have a thousand nodes securing

39:03.160 --> 39:06.640
 $100,000 worth of value.

39:06.640 --> 39:11.160
 So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale and how do we compose ensembles

39:11.160 --> 39:17.320
 of nodes in a decentralized way where we can know that, okay, we're going from seven nodes

39:17.320 --> 39:24.240
 in a network to 15, to 31, to 57, to 105, to a thousand, right?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.480
 So that's one dimension of the problem.

39:26.480 --> 39:32.360
 So you have to be scaling the number of nodes relative to the value that's derived from

39:32.360 --> 39:34.640
 the truth integrated into those nodes.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.800
 Well, that's not the only problem, right?

39:36.800 --> 39:41.680
 The other side of this is that you're trying to create a deterministic result, a deterministic

39:41.680 --> 39:47.200
 output from a set of non deterministic disparate systems, data sources, or places that prove

39:47.200 --> 39:48.200
 things.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.680
 Can you also just as a side, what is an Oracle node?

39:51.680 --> 39:53.560
 What is the role of an Oracle node?

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
 Sure.

39:54.560 --> 39:58.680
 So an Oracle node essentially exists in both places.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.680
 It exists in both worlds.

40:00.680 --> 40:07.560
 It exists as an on chain contract that represents either an Oracle network or an Oracle node.

40:07.560 --> 40:13.400
 So there's an on chain interface in the form of a contract that says, I exist to give you

40:13.400 --> 40:15.160
 this list of inputs.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.960
 You can request weather data from me.

40:16.960 --> 40:19.020
 You can request price data from me.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.480
 You can ask me to send a payment somewhere.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.480
 It's like an API.

40:21.480 --> 40:29.360
 So it's a pointer to API that provides truth about this world, by its data.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.360
 It's an interface.

40:30.360 --> 40:35.920
 It's like an API is an interface for web 2.0 engineers.

40:35.920 --> 40:42.440
 Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them or individual nodes are the interface

40:42.440 --> 40:45.680
 of web 3.0's use of services.

40:45.680 --> 40:52.960
 And services includes all services, data, payment systems, messaging systems, whatever

40:52.960 --> 40:59.480
 web 2.0 or any kind of computing service that you can conceptualize, needs an interface

40:59.480 --> 41:04.920
 on chain in the form of a contract that says, here are the services I can provide for you.

41:04.920 --> 41:09.680
 Here are the transactions you need to send me to get back this data or that computation

41:09.680 --> 41:11.320
 or this result.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.360
 And then what you actually see is that decentralized Oracle networks, because they're uniquely capable

41:15.360 --> 41:20.640
 of generating their own computations in a decentralized way around the data that they

41:20.640 --> 41:26.040
 have access to, you actually see decentralized Oracle networks generating a lot of these

41:26.040 --> 41:27.040
 services.

41:27.040 --> 41:32.760
 So we have a randomness service, a verifiable randomness function service that basically

41:32.760 --> 41:38.720
 provides randomness on chain, and that randomness is then used in lotteries and various other

41:38.720 --> 41:40.360
 contracts that need randomness.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.720
 But that randomness, it's not a piece of data that comes from somewhere else.

41:43.720 --> 41:46.680
 We don't go to another data source and get it.

41:46.680 --> 41:52.120
 We generate it within an Oracle node that then provides it over into Oracle node or

41:52.120 --> 41:55.240
 Oracle nodes that provided into the contracts themselves.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.320
 So what do you say Oracle nodes are not deterministic?

41:58.320 --> 42:05.440
 Well, they are as far as they come to consensus, but there's this kind of different problem

42:05.440 --> 42:06.440
 here, right?

42:06.440 --> 42:12.200
 The blockchains are very focused on generating blocks of transactions within a smaller universe

42:12.200 --> 42:17.360
 of transaction types, a certain block size and a certain set of conditions.

42:17.360 --> 42:22.320
 And then they have an economic system that says, I will perpetually generate blocks

42:22.320 --> 42:26.960
 of this size with these transaction types in this kind of limited set of transaction

42:26.960 --> 42:33.360
 types, whether those are UTXO transactions or scripted, Solidity or whatever it is.

42:33.360 --> 42:36.920
 Oracles and Oracle networks, we don't have a blockchain, for example.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.840
 There is no chain link blockchain.

42:38.840 --> 42:44.360
 Our goal is not to generate a certain set of very clearly predetermined transaction

42:44.360 --> 42:49.640
 types into a set of transactions that are put into blocks and will infinitely be done

42:49.640 --> 42:50.880
 that way.

42:50.880 --> 42:57.200
 Our goal is actually to create what we call a meta layer, a decentralized meta layer between

42:57.200 --> 43:05.760
 the nondeterministic, highly unreliable world and the highly hyperreliable world of blockchains

43:05.760 --> 43:09.960
 so that the unreliable world can be passed through this decentralized meta layer.

43:09.960 --> 43:14.120
 And it can coexist with the reliable chain, the on chain world.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
 Exactly.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.920
 It can coexist and in some cases the meta layer might generate it.

43:17.920 --> 43:22.360
 So the problem in giving you this straight answer is that there's just such a wide array

43:22.360 --> 43:24.280
 of services.

43:24.280 --> 43:28.600
 If you were to say, well, Sergey, how do we generate randomness from a data source?

43:28.600 --> 43:31.480
 Well, we don't use a data source to generate the randomness.

43:31.480 --> 43:35.360
 That's the type of service that can be generated in an Oracle network itself.

43:35.360 --> 43:40.240
 And so there will be certain computations that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves

43:40.240 --> 43:43.160
 to augment and improve blockchains.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.800
 And it is actually the goal of Oracles to consistently do that.

43:45.800 --> 43:51.480
 So if you were to think about the stack in a very generic high level, you would see blockchains

43:51.480 --> 43:52.480
 or databases.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.600
 They're basically the data structures that retain a lot of information in this transparent,

43:56.600 --> 43:58.720
 highly reliable form.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.920
 Smart contract code is the application logic.

44:01.920 --> 44:07.720
 It is the logic under which all of this kind of activity occurs, storing data in the data

44:07.720 --> 44:13.800
 structure in the blockchain as a database in a certain conceptualization of it.

44:13.800 --> 44:21.120
 And then Oracles and Oracle networks are all the services that are used by the application

44:21.120 --> 44:22.120
 code.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.320
 So by analogy, let's take Uber.

44:24.320 --> 44:30.120
 Uber, initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API from Google Maps about the user's

44:30.120 --> 44:35.840
 location, sends a message to the user through Twilio, pays the driver through Stripe.

44:35.840 --> 44:39.600
 If those services weren't available to the people who made Uber, they wouldn't have

44:39.600 --> 44:40.840
 made Uber, right?

44:40.840 --> 44:43.600
 Because they would have written their core code on some database and then they would

44:43.600 --> 44:48.400
 have had to make a geolocation company, a telecom messaging company, and the global

44:48.400 --> 44:49.400
 payments company.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.800
 And they wouldn't have done that because it's too hard.

44:51.800 --> 44:55.560
 And that's the weird scenario that a lot of people in our industry are in.

44:55.560 --> 45:00.680
 And that's the problem that Oracles and Oracle networks fix is they provide these decentralized

45:00.680 --> 45:07.120
 services to take this developer ecosystem, the blockchain and smart contract developer

45:07.120 --> 45:13.000
 ecosystem from, hey, I can have a database and write some application logic about tokenization

45:13.000 --> 45:18.320
 and voting and private key signing, all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation.

45:18.320 --> 45:23.000
 But now, if you just layer on all the world services, whether that's market data, weather

45:23.000 --> 45:28.520
 data, randomness, suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud proof gaming, fraud proof global

45:28.520 --> 45:31.560
 trade, fraud proof ad networks.

45:31.560 --> 45:36.240
 And that's why this world of decentralized services and decentralized Oracle networks

45:36.240 --> 45:39.640
 is particularly, in my opinion, important to our industry.

45:39.640 --> 45:40.640
 Yeah, it's funny.

45:40.640 --> 45:45.920
 You talk about that the current sort of decentralized world of DeFi, but decentralized services world

45:45.920 --> 45:52.240
 is primarily just tokens and it's basically just financial transactions.

45:52.240 --> 45:56.240
 And the kind of thing, the reason why it's super exciting, the kind of thing you do with

45:56.240 --> 46:02.960
 Chainlink and Oracle networks is that you can basically open up the whole world of services

46:02.960 --> 46:09.360
 to this kind of decentralized smart contract world.

46:09.360 --> 46:16.160
 I mean, you're talking about just orders of magnitude, greater impact financially and

46:16.160 --> 46:21.680
 just socially and philosophically.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.640
 Are there interesting near term and long term applications that excite you?

46:25.640 --> 46:29.520
 Yeah, there's a lot that excites me and that is how I think about it, that it's not just

46:29.520 --> 46:32.000
 about we made a decentralized Oracle network.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.960
 It's about we made a decentralized service or collection of services that's going from

46:35.960 --> 46:40.520
 hundreds to thousands and then people are able to build the hybrid smart contracts,

46:40.520 --> 46:43.360
 which I think will redefine what our industry is about.

46:43.360 --> 46:46.720
 Because for example, for the people that only learned about blockchains through the lens

46:46.720 --> 46:53.320
 of NFTs, they understand blockchains through NFTs, not through speculative tokens or bitcoins.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.760
 And I think that will continue.

46:55.760 --> 47:02.440
 I think the use cases that excite me, they vary between the developed world's economies

47:02.440 --> 47:04.440
 and emerging markets.

47:04.440 --> 47:11.480
 I think in the developed world, what you will see is that transparency, creating a new level

47:11.480 --> 47:18.280
 of information for how markets work and the risk that is in markets and kind of the dynamics

47:18.280 --> 47:23.760
 that put the global financial system at systemic financial risk like 2008.

47:23.760 --> 47:30.480
 And my hope is that all of this infrastructure will soften the boom and bust cycles by making

47:30.480 --> 47:35.040
 information immediately available to all market participants, which is by the way, what all

47:35.040 --> 47:39.880
 market participants want, except for the very, very, very small minority that are able to

47:39.880 --> 47:44.080
 game the system and their benefit and benefit from booms but avoid busts because of their

47:44.080 --> 47:48.800
 asymmetric access to information, which really everybody should have and which this technically

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
 solves.

47:49.800 --> 47:54.440
 I think in the process of doing that, and which is happening, I think right about now,

47:54.440 --> 47:58.880
 you see a polishing of the technology such that it can be made available to emerging

47:58.880 --> 48:04.720
 markets. And on a personal level, I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more

48:04.720 --> 48:09.400
 from this technology, just like the emerging markets benefit much more from the internet

48:09.400 --> 48:15.880
 or from those $50 Android phones that people can have because it's such a massive shift

48:15.880 --> 48:17.880
 in how people's lives work.

48:17.880 --> 48:23.360
 I have always had access to books and a library, which has been fantastic and very important.

48:23.360 --> 48:27.600
 But there are places in the world where people don't have libraries, but now they have the

48:27.600 --> 48:32.240
 internet and a $50 Android phone and they can watch the same Stanford lecture that I

48:32.240 --> 48:33.240
 watch.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.240
 I mean, that's kind of mind blowing realistically, right?

48:36.240 --> 48:40.280
 They just went from zero to one in a very, very dramatic way.

48:40.280 --> 48:46.120
 I think all of these smart contracts and in my case, I think the one that I seem to keep

48:46.120 --> 48:51.120
 coming back to is crop insurance, partly because it doesn't have a tokenization component,

48:51.120 --> 48:56.080
 partly because it's actually much more important than it might seem.

48:56.080 --> 48:58.040
 What is crop insurance?

48:58.040 --> 49:04.520
 Right. So this is the nature of why it's sometimes hard to see the full value of what

49:04.520 --> 49:08.280
 our industry does because it solves all these kinds of back end problems that we don't have,

49:08.280 --> 49:09.280
 right?

49:09.280 --> 49:14.360
 So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn't rain, I get an insurance payout,

49:14.360 --> 49:16.600
 so I don't need to close down my farm.

49:16.600 --> 49:19.760
 Because if it didn't rain, I don't have crops, right?

49:19.760 --> 49:25.520
 So people in the developed world can get crop insurance and there's all kinds of systems

49:25.520 --> 49:29.680
 that basically pay them out and then they can argue with the insurance company if they

49:29.680 --> 49:32.080
 don't get paid out properly and whatever.

49:32.080 --> 49:36.120
 And this allows people to smooth out risk.

49:36.120 --> 49:40.320
 In fact, a lot of the global options markets were about this, right?

49:40.320 --> 49:45.720
 They were initially about people selling their produce or their crops ahead of time so that

49:45.720 --> 49:49.800
 if there was a risk of drought, they weren't impacted by it, right?

49:49.800 --> 49:54.000
 And that's where a lot of options trading and all this kind of stuff came from, even

49:54.000 --> 49:57.320
 though it's now turned into this kind of global casino.

49:57.320 --> 50:03.160
 But in the emerging market, there are literally people that if they don't have rain for two

50:03.160 --> 50:07.680
 seasons, they need to close down their farm and become a migrant worker of some kind.

50:07.680 --> 50:13.000
 And now they have a $50 Android phone where they can read Wikipedia, but they're still

50:13.000 --> 50:18.360
 decades away from an insurance company coming to their geography and offering them insurance

50:18.360 --> 50:22.240
 because their local legal system simply doesn't allow that type of thing to exist.

50:22.240 --> 50:26.040
 No insurance company is going to go and create an insurance entity and offer them insurance

50:26.040 --> 50:29.800
 because the levels of fraud and the ability to resolve that fraud through courts would

50:29.800 --> 50:31.480
 just not exist.

50:31.480 --> 50:36.440
 So now these people have to wait for decades to have this very basic form of financial

50:36.440 --> 50:39.920
 protection or something like a bank account even.

50:39.920 --> 50:42.160
 And with this technology, they don't, right?

50:42.160 --> 50:48.280
 So with this technology, if I have a $50 Android phone and the smart contract has data from

50:48.280 --> 50:52.600
 satellites or weather stations about the weather conditions in the geography that my farm

50:52.600 --> 50:59.400
 is in, I can put value into the smart contract and the smart contract will automatically

50:59.400 --> 51:03.160
 pay me back out at my Android phone.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.160
 And guess what?

51:04.160 --> 51:10.760
 I just leapfrogged past my corrupt government not being able to provide a legal infrastructure

51:10.760 --> 51:12.280
 to create insurance.

51:12.280 --> 51:16.960
 I just leapfrogged past dealing with insurance companies that will probably price gouge me

51:16.960 --> 51:19.720
 and often not pay out.

51:19.720 --> 51:27.040
 And I leapfrogged into the world of hyper reliable kind of guaranteed smart contract

51:27.040 --> 51:31.440
 outcomes that are as good or in many cases better than what farmers in all other parts

51:31.440 --> 51:32.920
 of the world have.

51:32.920 --> 51:37.240
 And this type of dynamic for the emerging markets of creating a way for people to control

51:37.240 --> 51:41.320
 and manage risk in their economic life, I think extends way past insurance.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.520
 It extends to them having bank accounts to combat local inflation.

51:44.520 --> 51:48.200
 It extends to them being able to sell their goods on the global free market of global

51:48.200 --> 51:49.640
 trade without middleman.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.360
 It extends to all these things that we don't really care about, right?

51:53.360 --> 51:58.960
 Because we're not farmers, but are unbelievably impactful for people that don't have a bank

51:58.960 --> 52:04.720
 account and their inflation rate in their country is double digits or their farm completely

52:04.720 --> 52:10.360
 depends on rain or their livelihood completely depends on their ability to sell goods.

52:10.360 --> 52:14.240
 And they can't sell those goods because there's a middleman who essentially controls all

52:14.240 --> 52:16.320
 the trust relationships.

52:16.320 --> 52:20.040
 But now now we have the Internet and smart contracts and that might not have to be the

52:20.040 --> 52:22.560
 case in the next five or 10 years.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.560
 Yes.

52:23.560 --> 52:27.240
 So that definitely has a quality of life impact on the particular farmer's life.

52:27.240 --> 52:33.920
 But I suspect it has a huge like down the line ripple effect on the whole supply chain.

52:33.920 --> 52:42.120
 So if you think about farmers, but any other people that produce things that are part of

52:42.120 --> 52:53.040
 a large logistics network, like supply chain network, that means when you increase reliability,

52:53.040 --> 53:00.680
 you sort of increase transparency and control, but where anyone know in that supply chain

53:00.680 --> 53:09.000
 network can formalize the way it operates in its agreements with others, then you could

53:09.000 --> 53:19.600
 just have a very like at scale, transformative effect on how people that down the line use

53:19.600 --> 53:23.360
 the services that you provide, the products that you create operate.

53:23.360 --> 53:30.840
 So like it's almost hard to imagine the possible ways it might transform the world.

53:30.840 --> 53:36.160
 I wonder how much friction there is in the system, I guess, currently that smart contracts

53:36.160 --> 53:38.160
 might remove.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.800
 That's almost unknown.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.800
 You can sort of hypothesize and stuff.

53:42.800 --> 53:49.640
 But I wonder, I've seen enough bureaucracy in my life to know that smart contracts in

53:49.640 --> 53:52.920
 many cases would remove bureaucracy.

53:52.920 --> 53:58.560
 And I wonder how the world will be once you remove much of the bureaucracy.

53:58.560 --> 54:07.480
 Coming from the Soviet Union, where I just have seen the life sucked out of the innovative

54:07.480 --> 54:14.360
 spirit of human nature by bureaucracy, I wonder the kind of amazing world that could

54:14.360 --> 54:17.920
 be created once bureaucracy is removed.

54:17.920 --> 54:22.280
 Yeah, I think it's fascinating how the world can evolve.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.840
 I think this extends a lot further than people think into many, many different parts of the

54:26.840 --> 54:28.160
 global economy.

54:28.160 --> 54:34.600
 It might start with NFTs for art, or it might start with DeFi, or it might start with fraud

54:34.600 --> 54:36.880
 proof ad networks next.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.440
 We don't know what it's going to go to next.

54:39.440 --> 54:46.320
 But I think the implication of people being in a system of contracts that holds them accountable

54:46.320 --> 54:51.800
 and guarantees contractual outcomes, regardless of a local legal system, is something that

54:51.800 --> 54:54.020
 I think extends to the supply chain.

54:54.020 --> 54:58.600
 You can prove that goods were sourced in an ethical way, and you can prove that in

54:58.600 --> 55:00.360
 a way that can't be gained.

55:00.360 --> 55:05.600
 That'll change buying power and supplier power and how people produce goods that we all

55:05.600 --> 55:06.840
 consume.

55:06.840 --> 55:12.000
 And then on the political level, I personally think that in a number of decades, we could

55:12.000 --> 55:18.240
 literally be in a place where politicians can commit to a certain set of smart contract

55:18.240 --> 55:22.320
 kind of budget, definitional kind of results.

55:22.320 --> 55:26.720
 For example, we discovered oil, I promised as a politician, I'm going to take the oil

55:26.720 --> 55:29.080
 and I'm going to redistribute it to all of you.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.560
 Well, that's wonderful.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.920
 That's a great idea.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.360
 Sounds very nice when you're running for office.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.880
 Why don't we codify that in a smart contract?

55:36.880 --> 55:40.840
 And why don't we put those conditions very solidly on a blockchain?

55:40.840 --> 55:47.200
 And then once you've been elected, we'll just turn that one on, and it'll distribute the

55:47.200 --> 55:50.480
 money just like you said, and everything will be fine.

55:50.480 --> 55:56.360
 I personally think that this new level of systems that allows trustworthy collaboration

55:56.360 --> 56:01.920
 between everybody, between supply chain partners, ad network users, the financial system, insurance

56:01.920 --> 56:09.640
 companies and farmers, all of these are just interactions that require a trusted entity,

56:09.640 --> 56:15.860
 or in this case, a trusted piece of code to orchestrate the interaction in the way that

56:15.860 --> 56:16.860
 everyone agrees.

56:16.860 --> 56:17.860
 Yeah.

56:17.860 --> 56:18.860
 Yeah.

56:18.860 --> 56:23.280
 One of the things that makes the United States fascinating is the founding documents.

56:23.280 --> 56:28.740
 And it's fascinating to think of us moving into the new in the 21st century to a digital

56:28.740 --> 56:30.360
 version of that.

56:30.360 --> 56:37.320
 To the constitution, a smart constitution, no offense to the paper constitution.

56:37.320 --> 56:43.840
 And that would have transformative effects on politicians and governments holding people

56:43.840 --> 56:44.840
 accountable.

56:44.840 --> 56:58.640
 Oh man, that's so exciting to think that we might enforce accountability through the

56:58.640 --> 57:01.120
 smart contract process.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.120
 Exactly.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
 Why can't that happen?

57:03.120 --> 57:07.160
 Anything that we could codify into a smart contract, and anything that we all agree

57:07.160 --> 57:09.280
 is the way the world should work.

57:09.280 --> 57:14.560
 And then anything that we can get proof about, anything that a system somewhere could tell

57:14.560 --> 57:19.160
 us happened, those are the pieces of the puzzle.

57:19.160 --> 57:21.240
 We need a trusted piece of code.

57:21.240 --> 57:25.400
 We need to have agreement that that's how the world should work, and we need a system

57:25.400 --> 57:28.560
 that'll tell that trusted piece of code what happened.

57:28.560 --> 57:35.280
 As long as we have those three things, we can theoretically codify any set of agreements

57:35.280 --> 57:39.800
 about anything where those three properties take hold.

57:39.800 --> 57:44.320
 I wonder if you can apply that to like military conflict and so on.

57:44.320 --> 57:51.360
 Recently, the Biden announced that we're going to pull off from Afghanistan after 20 years

57:51.360 --> 57:52.360
 in the war.

57:52.360 --> 57:59.960
 I wonder, there's a lot of debacles around war in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq,

57:59.960 --> 58:00.960
 all those kinds of things.

58:00.960 --> 58:07.920
 I wonder if that was instead formulated as a smart contract.

58:07.920 --> 58:13.080
 That might have actually huge impact on the way we do conflict.

58:13.080 --> 58:19.320
 You think of a smart contract as a kind of win, win situation where you're doing financial

58:19.320 --> 58:25.280
 transactions or something like that, but you could see that also about military conflict

58:25.280 --> 58:32.080
 or whenever two nations are at tension with each other, different scales of conflict that

58:32.080 --> 58:37.200
 you could have conflict codified.

58:37.200 --> 58:42.720
 That would potentially resolve conflict much faster because there's honest transparency

58:42.720 --> 58:46.440
 and control within that conflict because there's conflict in this world.

58:46.440 --> 58:55.320
 Again, very inspiring to think about the kind of effects you might have on the negative

58:55.320 --> 58:59.560
 kinds of contracts, on the tense, painful kinds of contracts.

58:59.560 --> 59:03.680
 I haven't thought about that as much as actually kind of scary the stuff you're thinking through

59:03.680 --> 59:06.440
 now with like the war contracts or something.

59:06.440 --> 59:07.440
 That's not in the white paper.

59:07.440 --> 59:09.680
 We don't have anything about war contracts or anything.

59:09.680 --> 59:14.760
 Again, this is the Russian, we're both Russian, but I'm a little more Russian in the suffering

59:14.760 --> 59:21.920
 side, maybe I read way too much Dostoevsky and military kind of ideas, but anyway, holding

59:21.920 --> 59:26.240
 politicians accountable in all forms, I think is really powerful.

59:26.240 --> 59:32.600
 Is there something you could say as a small aside on how smart contracts actually work

59:32.600 --> 59:33.600
 if we look at the code?

59:33.600 --> 59:39.120
 Is there some nice way to say technically, what is a smart contract?

59:39.120 --> 59:43.240
 What does it mean to codify these agreements, the actual process for people who might not

59:43.240 --> 59:47.000
 at all be familiar?

59:47.000 --> 59:53.160
 I think you just write it into code that operates in this kind of decentralized infrastructure.

59:53.160 --> 59:56.200
 You usually write code that runs in a central server somewhere.

59:56.200 --> 1:00:00.560
 Now you write code that runs across a lot of different machines in this decentralized

1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:01.720
 way.

1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:05.560
 Then after you write it, you need services, and that's where oracles come in.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.560
 They provide all the services.

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:11.440
 Just like you would be writing code in Web 2.0 land, running it on a server somewhere

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:12.960
 and using an API.

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:17.600
 Here you'd be writing code, putting it on a decentralized infrastructure like a blockchain

1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:22.600
 or a smart contract platform like Ethereum, and then you would be using various services

1:00:22.600 --> 1:00:23.800
 in the form of oracles.

1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:28.080
 They'll just be called oracles or decentralized services instead of APIs.

1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:33.200
 You're basically composing the same type of architecture, except it's hyper reliable.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.400
 At the moment, it's a little bit less efficient because there's an early stage to our industry,

1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:46.240
 but it provides this extreme level of reliability and transparency, which for certain use cases

1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:51.360
 is an absolute critical component and is completely reinventing how they work.

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:55.240
 I think people should look at what are the use cases where that trust dynamic can be

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:59.720
 so heavily improved, and that's probably the ones where this is maybe initially useful.

1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:05.040
 But I mean, just to emphasize, I don't think people realize when you say code that we're

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:12.120
 talking about non obfuscated actual program, you can read it, you can understand it.

1:01:12.120 --> 1:01:18.160
 And there's something about, maybe this is my computer science perspective, like software

1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:23.400
 engineering perspective, but there's something about the formalism of programming languages

1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:28.200
 which enforces simplicity and clarity and transparency.

1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.280
 And because it's seen to everybody, I mean, simplicity is enforced.

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:39.560
 There's something about natural language, like language, as written in the Constitution,

1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:44.560
 for example, where there's so many interpretations.

1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:51.000
 With the nice thing about programs, there's not going to be a huge number of books written

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:57.000
 about what was meant by this particular line, because it's pretty clear.

1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.920
 Programming languages have a clarity to them that natural language does not.

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:07.840
 They don't have ambiguity, which I think it's important to pause on because it's really

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:08.840
 powerful.

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:09.840
 It's really difficult to think about.

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:14.280
 I think we live in a world where all the philosophers and legal minds don't know how

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:15.440
 to program.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:18.720
 So I think not all, most don't.

1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:25.120
 And so we don't often see the philosophical impact of this kind of idea that the agreements

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:30.160
 between humans can be written in a programming language.

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:33.240
 That's a really transformative idea.

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:39.680
 That I mean, yeah, it's an idea that's not just technical, it's not just financial,

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:46.920
 it's philosophical, it's rethinking human nature from a digital perspective.

1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:48.200
 What is human civilization?

1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:51.400
 It's interaction between humans.

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:57.200
 And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction that is managed by programming

1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:03.440
 languages, by programs, by code, I mean, that's fascinating.

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:10.040
 That we'll look back at this time potentially as one where us little descendants of apes

1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:16.840
 did not realize how important this moment in history is.

1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:24.400
 Human beings might be totally different a century from now because we codified the interaction

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:25.960
 between humans.

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:30.440
 We might have more of an impact than anything else we do today.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:34.200
 You think about the impact of the internet, one of the cool things is digitization of

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:42.440
 data, but we have not yet integrated the tools, the mechanisms fully that use that data and

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:43.960
 interact with humans yet.

1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:45.840
 And that's what smart contracts do.

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:51.840
 I wonder if you think about the role of artificial intelligence in all of this because your smart

1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:59.160
 contracts are kind of agreements, maybe you disagree with this, but at least the way I'm

1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:04.360
 thinking about it is the agreements between humans or groups of humans.

1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:10.580
 But it seems like because everything's operating in the digital space that you can integrate

1:04:10.580 --> 1:04:18.080
 nonhumans into this or AI systems that help out humans, managed by humans, like what do

1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:31.400
 you think about a world of hybrid smart contracts codifying agreements between hybrid intelligent

1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:35.160
 being networks of humans and AI systems?

1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:36.160
 Yeah.

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:37.160
 Yeah.

1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:39.360
 I think that makes perfect sense.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:42.360
 In terms of AI, I'm not an expert, right?

1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:48.320
 So it might be a bit simplistic or naive my ideas in this field.

1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:52.120
 I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?

1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:56.440
 Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the 90s and it was like, this is really

1:04:56.440 --> 1:04:57.440
 scary.

1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:02.080
 I personally think AI is amazing and makes perfect sense.

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:08.240
 I think it will evolve to a place where people have, just to understand, I work in the world

1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:09.360
 of trust issues, right?

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:15.120
 I work in the world of how can technology solve trust and collaboration issues using

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:19.640
 encryption, using cryptographically guaranteed systems, using decentralized infrastructure,

1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:20.640
 right?

1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:25.760
 So that's the world that I've been inhabiting for many, many years now, building smart contracts

1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:28.200
 for seven or eight, doing stuff before that.

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:29.400
 It's kind of what I'm focused on.

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:35.040
 So I view AI through that same lens and my brain naturally asks, well, what is the trust

1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:41.360
 issue that people might have with AI and my natural kind of response as well?

1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:44.960
 Let's say AI continues to be built and improve.

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:48.360
 At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now.

1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:51.040
 I've seen different ideas that were very far from this.

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.920
 I've seen other ideas very close to this.

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:57.800
 At a certain point, we'd arrive at a place with AI where we would be a little bit worried

1:05:57.800 --> 1:05:59.640
 about just how much it could do, right?

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:05.160
 We might be worried that AI could do things we don't want it to do, but we still want

1:06:05.160 --> 1:06:08.640
 to give AI a level of control over our lives, right?

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:11.840
 So in my world, that's a trust issue.

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:16.720
 And the way that that trust issue would be solved with blockchains is actually very straightforward

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:20.560
 and I think in its simplicity, quite powerful.

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:27.600
 You could have an AI that has an ability to do and control key parts of your and our lives,

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:28.800
 right?

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:35.760
 But then you could limit it with private keys and blockchains and create certain guardrails

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:45.640
 and firm kind of walls and limits to what the AI could never go past, assuming that

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:49.080
 encryption, right, that encryption continues to work, right?

1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:55.320
 And assuming that if it's not that AI's specialization to break encryption, that it wouldn't be able

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:56.320
 to do that, right?

1:06:56.320 --> 1:07:02.680
 So if you have an AI that controls something very important, whatever it is, shipping or

1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:08.000
 something in defense or something in the financial system, whatever it is, but you're sitting

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.320
 there and you're kind of worried, hey, this thing is unbelievable, it's coming up with

1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:18.040
 things we wouldn't have thought of in 100 years, but maybe it's a little too unbelievable.

1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:19.440
 How do you limit it?

1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:27.160
 Well, if you bake in private keys and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations,

1:07:27.160 --> 1:07:31.800
 you can create the conditions beyond which an AI could never act.

1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:36.880
 And those could once again be codified in the very specific unambiguous terms in which

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:43.240
 you described, which once again in my trust issue focused world would solve the trust

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:49.400
 issue for users and make them comfortable with using the AI or ceding control to the

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:55.920
 AI, which I think in more advanced versions of AI will continue to be a concern, right?

1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:57.200
 This is fascinating.

1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:02.840
 So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism for human supervision of AI systems.

1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:04.640
 With encryption, very encryption heavy.

1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:07.480
 So it's not about like, is it smarter than us?

1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:10.840
 It's about, will the encryption hold up?

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:14.960
 So that's based on the assumption that the encryption holds up.

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:18.240
 I think that's a safe assumption we can get into that whole discussion.

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:22.080
 But from quantum computing, but cracking encryption is very difficult.

1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:23.640
 That's a whole other discussion.

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:33.640
 I think we're safe on the safe ground for quite a long time, assuming encryption holds.

1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:40.800
 There's a space that is at the cutting edge of general intelligence research in the AI

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:47.440
 community, which is the space of program synthesis or AI generating programs.

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:56.280
 That's different than what you're referring to is AI being able to generate smart contracts.

1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:04.080
 And that to me is kind of fascinating to think of, especially two AI systems between each

1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:12.000
 other generating contracts, sort of almost creating a world where most of the contracts

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.520
 are between non human beings.

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:19.360
 I think an AI system, as I think about it, and once again, this is not my field.

1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:22.480
 This is something I might watch a YouTube video on or just see something interesting

1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:25.080
 about at some point.

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:30.840
 I think if I were to just reason through it even now, I think the highly deterministic

1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:39.240
 and guaranteed nature of smart contracts would probably be preferable to an AI because I'm

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:43.880
 guessing an AI would have a lot of problems with dealing with the human element of how

1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:45.680
 contracts work today.

1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:53.320
 So an AI, for example, couldn't pick up the phone and call Dave at a bank to do a derivative

1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:58.800
 and discuss with Dave and have a call with him and have a conversation and get him comfortable

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:04.040
 and tell him it's going to be fine and smooth out all the weird social cues that have to

1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:06.160
 do with making certain derivatives.

1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:15.680
 I'm assuming that that's a pretty complicated neural map AI kind of problem.

1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:23.040
 So if I think about it, the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts and assuming

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:28.880
 they're accessible to AIs could actually, interestingly enough, be the format that they

1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:37.320
 prefer to codify their relationship with non AI systems and very possibly other AI systems

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:47.280
 because it's pretty guaranteed, all the other types of contracts that an AI could go out

1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:56.440
 there and seek to do would require some language processing around the law.

1:10:56.440 --> 1:11:02.000
 And I think, I don't know if this is a term, probably not a smart AI or a good AI or whatever

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:09.120
 the term is for a high quality AI would probably realize some of the limitations and the risks.

1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:10.120
 Yeah.

1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:11.120
 Yeah.

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:17.480
 AI definitely dislikes ambiguity and would prefer the deterministic nature of smart contracts.

1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:22.840
 I do wonder about this particular problem and maybe you could speak to it of how smart

1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:30.360
 contracts can take over certain industries in a sense or how certain industries can convert

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:36.000
 their sets of agreements into smart contracts, which is, you mentioned that we're talking

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:43.280
 today from the bank, you know, many of our laws, many of our agreements are currently

1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:47.040
 through natural language, through words.

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:53.160
 And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur in order to convert the legal

1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:59.760
 agreements, legal contracts of today to smart contracts that, by the way, AI may be able

1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:08.120
 to help with, but as a by way of question, how do you think we convert the legal contracts

1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:14.240
 on which many industries currently function today or not even legal contracts, but ambiguous

1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:21.440
 kind of agreements, maybe they're loose sometimes into more formal deterministic agreements

1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:25.120
 that are represented by smart contracts?

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:30.280
 So I think there's two, maybe two sides to this.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:34.160
 I think the first one is actually not a huge problem where you have things like that is

1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:38.600
 the master agreement for derivatives or you have these agreements that basically already

1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:41.160
 reference a system somewhere, right?

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:45.160
 Like for example, many legal agreements already accept e signature.

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:49.320
 And so they're saying, Hey, I'm going to use this computing system over here around signatures

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:53.200
 and I'm going to consider and there's laws around that and there's clauses that say signatures

1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:55.080
 good enough for this agreement.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.720
 I actually don't think this is a big problem for the vast majority of legal agreements

1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:02.100
 that use systems already, right?

1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:07.600
 So what you'll do is you'll swap out one repository or one or one set of contract system

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:11.760
 of contract settlement and you'll just say, Hey, this blockchain system over here is my

1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:17.120
 new system of contract settlement, whatever it says is the state of the agreement instead

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:20.560
 of the centralized system over there, right?

1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:24.920
 And so there's actually a huge amount of agreements that are already able to do that.

1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:26.680
 And I think we'll do that.

1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:32.840
 I think there's another side to your question, which is the amount of agreements that are

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.240
 very ambiguous, that can be turned into smart contracts.

1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:39.560
 And I think the limitation there is twofold.

1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:45.760
 First of all, like you said earlier, the highly reliable smart contract and the lack of opaqueness

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:53.840
 and the clarity of smart contracts is very high and very powerful and very clear.

1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:58.720
 And it's, in my opinion, going to be much, much easier to take a smart contract and turn

1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:04.000
 it into a set of natural language explanations and just say, Hey, you know, this is what

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.760
 this does, right?

1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:11.120
 So I think that many contracts are, and even now in decentralized finance and DeFi and

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:15.640
 in decentralized insurance, they're basically being rebuilt in this format.

1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:19.600
 And that rebuilding will make them clearer, like you said, and then restating those in

1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:22.760
 natural language and explaining to people, well, you know, if the weather does this,

1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:26.400
 I think it'll actually be a lot simpler to explain to people what the contract is about.

1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.120
 Especially mapping smart contracts, it's a natural language, I didn't even think about

1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:31.120
 that.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:36.280
 You're saying that's doable and natural and easy to do.

1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:37.800
 Because there's so much clear, right?

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:40.280
 There's that forced clarity that you talked about.

1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:45.880
 I think the second aspect of this problem is the nuance around what contracts can be

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:47.800
 made unambiguous.

1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:52.400
 And I think that comes down to, often comes down to proving what happened, which is where

1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:56.400
 Oracle Networks and decentralized Oracle Networks and Chainlink would come in.

1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:00.400
 And our experience there is quite extensive over the many years that we've worked on many

1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:02.280
 different contract types.

1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:07.760
 I think what it fundamentally comes down to is whether there is data.

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:12.640
 So we're not going to be able to make a hybrid smart contract about whether somebody painted

1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:15.160
 your house the right color blue.

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:18.640
 We're just not going to be doing that because there's no data feed that tells us that your

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.920
 house was painted blue or that it was the right color of blue, you know, unless somebody

1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:28.360
 sets up a drone with a color analysis tool and they generate that data.

1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:31.040
 Which by the way, it could be possible, right?

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:35.480
 If there's enough demand, then the service would be created that has drones flying around

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:39.000
 that's telling you about the colors of, you know, all this kind of stuff.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.880
 So if there's actual demand that that would be created.

1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:46.960
 And because there'd be value to connect that data feed to the smart contracts and so on.

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:51.120
 I think you have it unbelievably right because there are already insurance companies that

1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:55.960
 use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead and see how many people are wearing

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:57.200
 hard hats.

1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:01.200
 And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats isn't sufficiently high, then, you know,

1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:02.800
 the policy is voided.

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:07.080
 And so in that case, there is a data source and that data source can be put into a hybrid

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.400
 smart contract.

1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:13.240
 So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is, is there a data source or a set of data

1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:19.080
 sources to create definitive truth, to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity.

1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:25.040
 And then as you said, I think as people realize that smart contracts are a format in which

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.360
 they can form agreement about things like that insurance product around, you know, how

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:31.320
 many people are wearing hard hats.

1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:35.600
 If I'm the construction site owner, well, you know, I would really like a guarantee

1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:41.080
 that your insurance policy is going to pay me out if everyone is wearing hard hats.

1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:46.640
 And in that case, there is demand for the data and people will generate the data.

1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:50.280
 And I actually think the insurance industry is interestingly a precursor of this because

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:51.760
 they're so data driven.

1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:57.880
 You already see insurance companies paying IOT companies to put data into their customers

1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:03.000
 infrastructure at the cost of the insurance company to generate the data that the insurance

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.880
 company uses to make a policy for the customer.

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:12.400
 So you basically already have people who really want to price data into their agreements when

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:19.040
 they're sufficiently high value paying for their own customers to get data sensors into

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:20.720
 their infrastructure.

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:26.760
 And I think as smart contracts become more of a requested format or data driven contracts

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:33.280
 become more of a format, there will be a growing demand about proving what happened through

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:34.280
 data.

1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:36.920
 So it'll be motivating totally new data fees being created.

1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:42.760
 By the way, the insurance industry broadly, the revolutions there will be huge.

1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.760
 I've worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles, semi autonomous and just vehicles in general.

1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:53.400
 The insurance industry that by the way makes a huge amount of money but is using very crappy

1:17:53.400 --> 1:18:02.520
 data fees revolutionizing how like not by crap, I mean very crude, like literally the

1:18:02.520 --> 1:18:09.520
 insurance is based on things like age, gender, like basic demographic information as opposed

1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:16.120
 to really high resolution information about you as an individual, which you may or may

1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:18.240
 not want to provide.

1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:28.240
 So you can choose from an individual perspective to provide a data feed and there like the power

1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:37.440
 of insurance to enable the individual to empower the individual could be huge because ultimately

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:43.880
 smart contracts motivate the use of data, the creation of new data feeds, but leveraging

1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:51.920
 the whatever service it provides in truth as opposed to some kind of very loose notion

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:52.920
 of who you are.

1:18:52.920 --> 1:19:01.520
 So I'm not again not sure how that would change things in terms of the fundamental experience

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:08.320
 of life because I think we all rely on insurance not just in business but in life and grounding

1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:14.400
 that insurance and more and more accurate representation of reality might just have transformative

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:16.160
 effects in society.

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.560
 Well just to mention one quick thing that you said where I noticed another trust issue

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:23.840
 you said the user might not want to share their data.

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:27.800
 So what you could actually do and what we've already worked on is you can have a smart

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:34.040
 contract that holds the data and evaluates the data of the user without sharing it with

1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:35.640
 the insurance company.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:39.440
 And the insurance company knows that the smart contract will evaluate it according to the

1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:45.920
 policy they don't need the data and the user can provide the data knowing it will never

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:50.000
 touch the insurance company because it's only provided to the smart contract.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:55.200
 And suddenly you've solved another trust issue because an autonomous piece of code can evaluate

1:19:55.200 --> 1:20:00.480
 information separately from the interests of both of the counterparties.

1:20:00.480 --> 1:20:04.200
 And so this is the recurring theme I think you're seeing this recurring theme where there's

1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:09.200
 a trust issue people can't use a system they can't collaborate they can't share information

1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:13.800
 that would make a better agreement for both of them they can't you know solve a risk in

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.640
 their daily life they can't participate in a market they can't have a bank account because

1:20:17.640 --> 1:20:22.360
 nobody will give it to them because you know they can't give it to them in that legal system.

1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:28.120
 And once you have an autonomous piece of code that can also know what's going on thanks

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:32.240
 to Oracle Networks and that combination of the code and the Oracle Network for the hybrid

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:38.800
 smart contract the same pattern just recurs it's it's really the same pattern and and

1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.200
 this is why I keep saying trust issues it's because I basically almost every contractual

1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:49.720
 trust issue that I see where there is a piece of data to prove and settle the trust issue

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.440
 in a way that works for both parties.

1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:59.560
 There is no reason not to use an autonomous highly reliable contract and piece of code

1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:06.080
 and I have to tell you I've seen this in a lot of different industries I've seen it insurance

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.920
 ad networks global finance global trade those are all multi trillion dollar industries and

1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:16.200
 then there are there are other smaller industries like even even one of the first smart contracts

1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:21.280
 we worked on many years ago was for search engine optimization firms where they would

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:25.840
 tell you hey I'm going to raise your search engine ranking give me the money and people

1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:29.720
 wouldn't want to give them the money because they never knew if they were going to do it

1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:32.440
 and then the search engine firm doesn't want to do any work thinking they'll never get

1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:33.680
 any money.

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:37.480
 So we just came initially even came up with a system where you could put Bitcoin into

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:43.440
 a smart contract and it would be released based on whether the search rank of a website

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:47.160
 got to a certain level on Google for a certain keyword right.

1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:51.200
 And so the trust problem was solved but it's just the same story right it's kind of like

1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.360
 trust issues around AI trust issues around financial products trust issues around insurance

1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:03.440
 trust issues around social media whatever it is I think that's what people looking at

1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:08.160
 this industry really need to understand and once they do understand they realize what

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:15.880
 this is all about this is about redefining how everyone collaborates with everyone about

1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:20.120
 everything where we can prove something through data.

1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:25.440
 You've mentioned confidentiality and privacy that you don't the parties don't need to

1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:31.000
 necessarily know private data in this interaction you talk about confidentiality in the in the

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:38.040
 white paper for Chainlink 2.0 can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality

1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:40.120
 in this process.

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:46.000
 Sure absolutely so I think you once again need to think of the contract as existing

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.760
 in two parts right you have the on chain code and then you have this off chain system

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:52.840
 called the centralized Oracle network.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:58.680
 So the question is really what portion of the contract should live in what part of these

1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:00.800
 two systems right.

1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:07.200
 So if you want to create transparency you should put more information on chain because

1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:13.560
 that's what blockchains are very good at their public transparent but they don't necessarily

1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:15.120
 have privacy.

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:20.080
 Well those you can see how those two things are a little bit completely diametrically

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:21.600
 opposed right.

1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:28.760
 So I do I do think and I do see blockchains working on on chain encrypted smart contracts

1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:34.280
 that's very inefficient it has a lot of nuances around it that I think will appear at some

1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:41.520
 point I think until it appears you have an option of taking a part of the computation

1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:45.000
 and putting it into the centralized Oracle network.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:50.120
 We actually did an entire paper about this that we presented at Stanford in February

1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:55.640
 of last year something called Mixacles which basically talks about how you can take an

1:23:55.640 --> 1:24:01.000
 Oracle network and you can put a portion of the computation into the Oracle network

1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.240
 assuming that you're comfortable with that limited set of nodes knowing what the computation

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:10.960
 is and you can actually provide additional confidentiality through special hard work

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:15.200
 called trusted execution environments that you that all those nodes are forced to run

1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:17.960
 so they won't even know what they're operating.

1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:23.360
 And so at the end of the day if you look at a hybrid smart contract as gaining functionality

1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:28.480
 from its on chain code and gaining other functionality from its off chain decentralized

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:33.320
 Oracle network component you can place the part of the computation that you would like

1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:40.200
 to be private in the decentralized Oracle network because you can control the set of

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:45.120
 nodes you can control the committee of nodes and you can require that they run certain

1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:48.040
 hardware to keep the information private.

1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:52.760
 So you could basically make a derivative that or a binary option is the example used in

1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:59.160
 the Mixacles paper where the payout happened on chain but it was actually impossible to

1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:02.520
 tell what the outcome of the contract was.

1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:06.880
 So the outcome of the contract was computed in the centralized Oracle network and then

1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:12.720
 there was a switch that triggered who received the payment but from who from from the point

1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:20.040
 of view of analyzing the on chain transactions and seeing who received the payment or what

1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:24.600
 the outcome of the contract was you couldn't you couldn't derive that you couldn't backward

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:31.880
 engineer what that was but the users of that hybrid smart contract still had on chain code

1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:37.760
 that guaranteed them that as long as the decentralized Oracle network found a certain outcome right

1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:43.400
 determine the certain outcome that the relevant user would get paid and there was still a place

1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:45.720
 to put value right.

1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:52.440
 So there there there is this kind of fundamental tension between confidentiality privacy which

1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:56.880
 is very important for many contracts which is critical to many contracts and the public

1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:01.920
 and transparent nature of blockchains which I think eventually will be solved through

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:06.840
 encrypted on chain smart contracts that'll take some time I think that'll take years

1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:12.960
 in my opinion and before we arrive there I think people will put the private portion

1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:15.400
 into the centralized Oracle network.

1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:20.360
 Once again going back to what the decentralized Oracle networks do they seek to provide these

1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:26.280
 services right so the ability to do a privacy preserving computation is perhaps a service

1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:32.120
 without which a certain type of contract might never come into existence in the form of an

1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:37.400
 on chain hybrid smart contract and so this is once again what we see the centralized

1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:41.680
 Oracle networks and decentralized services doing is providing people these tools and

1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:47.880
 building blocks to compose you know like I'm I'm great at making these derivatives contracts

1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:54.680
 but I can't make them until unless I can retain the privacy of them and our goal is to provide

1:26:54.680 --> 1:27:00.860
 the infrastructure that gives you as a developer and as a creator of smart contracts that capability

1:27:00.860 --> 1:27:05.280
 and what we've seen is that as we provide that capability people create more which is

1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:09.160
 also really the story of the internet right the story of the internet is it was really

1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:14.640
 tough to do ecommerce while everything was an HTTP and credit cards were transmitted

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:18.800
 publicly and so ecommerce was kind of tough because how am I going to send my credit card

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:23.920
 over public unencrypted channels right but the second HTTPS appears ecommerce becomes

1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:28.200
 a lot easier because I can put in my credit card number and it can be sent over an encrypted

1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:32.120
 channel and you know it's not at risk and so I can participate in ecommerce as long

1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:37.080
 as I have a credit card I think those types and I'm sure that was unexpected right I'm

1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:42.800
 sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome from from that technology and so I think this

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:48.720
 is why we sometimes have this focus on privacy because in our work with contracts and their

1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:54.480
 transition into this hybrid smart contract form we see a substantial amount of need for

1:27:54.480 --> 1:28:01.760
 privacy as an inherent property of these contracts and it'll take a while before that's possible

1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:05.920
 to create the kind of technology innovation required to do that on chain I know there's

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:10.720
 a few ideas that are being floating about but so the currently distributed oracle networks

1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:16.120
 provide that feature which is essential to many contracts what what brings to mind in

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:22.400
 this whole space again it might be outside of your expertise but within the world which

1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:29.880
 I'm passionate about which is machine learning and it seems like very naturally because current

1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:38.040
 machine learning systems are very data hungry and much of the value mined by companies in

1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:45.280
 the digital space are from data they often want their data to maintain privacy so you

1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:50.760
 think about an autonomous vehicle space Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data Waymo is

1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:55.720
 collecting a huge amount of data it seems like it'll be very beneficial to form contracts

1:28:55.720 --> 1:29:00.800
 where one could use the data from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way but

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:08.440
 also where all the uses of data are codified and you can exchange value cleanly you know

1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:16.040
 basically contracts over data over machine learning systems use of different data I don't

1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:21.360
 know do you do you talk to machine learning folks that you use ideas of smart contracts

1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:26.600
 or is that from outside your interest because it seems like exceptionally applicable set

1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:33.280
 of when we talk about different services that might be created and revolutionized by smart

1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:39.040
 especially hybrid smart contracts I think machine learning systems comes to mind to

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:45.120
 me in all industries I don't know if you've gotten a chest interact with those folks with

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:49.520
 those services I think I think what you're talking about is more data marketplaces in

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:55.400
 the data marketplace side of things well this is actually once again very applicable because

1:29:55.400 --> 1:30:00.520
 there's a trust issue at the end of the day let's say I'm trying to sell you some data

1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:04.680
 you don't know the quality of the data so you don't know what you want to pay for it

1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:08.800
 and I can't give you the data for you to determine the quality because I've given you the data

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:16.600
 right guess what we need an autonomous impartial agent we need an impartial computational kind

1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:23.200
 of agent an on chain smart contract with an Oracle network to assess my data to write

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:30.080
 to to to basically take random cross section samples of the data assess it for quality assess

1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:35.400
 it for signal from the algorithm you have which you don't want to share with me because you

1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:39.240
 don't want to know the algorithm you're working on right you don't want me to know what you

1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:44.920
 want the data for so now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm keeping it private for

1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:50.120
 me and takes my data keeping it private from you assesses it on a random cross section

1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:57.400
 sampling for quality of data returns the scoring back to you allows you to determine a price

1:30:57.400 --> 1:31:02.360
 and now you and now both you and me know that we've arrived at a fair price for the quality

1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:10.000
 of my data for what you want to do with it and that's once again from what I've seen

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:15.120
 in the in the data marketplaces which are full of people who want that data for these

1:31:15.120 --> 1:31:21.160
 learning models often for financial markets often for other reasons this is their fundamental

1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:28.000
 rock problem which basically enough there's a trust issue that is is is getting solved

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:34.600
 and I think you can see even on the face of it once that trust issue is solved those markets

1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:38.640
 can work a lot better right I don't need to know your algorithm you don't need to know

1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:43.920
 my data we both know that the autonomous agent is not under either of our control and gave

1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:49.320
 us a fair assessment and a fair price and and that's it and we're all very comfortable

1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:55.360
 with with that we I could even make conditions that your algorithm isn't analyzing the data

1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:59.240
 for something I don't want you to analyze it for or you could make conditions that the

1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:04.560
 data has to have you know any number of properties and once again you haven't leaked any signal

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:10.520
 to me and I haven't leaked any see any data to you which is once again just another type

1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:14.960
 of trust issue that that all of this saw so it's the same pattern if you work in this

1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:18.920
 industry long enough or if you really look at these use cases long enough you'll simply

1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:24.760
 come to the question and this is the useful question what is the trust issue this is solving

1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:29.480
 and then if you can get an answer to that question on a case by case basis that's when

1:32:29.480 --> 1:32:33.960
 you'll understand why blockchains are relevant and then once you do that with enough use

1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:40.040
 cases it becomes you know it becomes a little bit mind blank you've mentioned trust quite

1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:49.600
 a bit you also mentioned trust minimization in the chain link white paper can we dig into

1:32:49.600 --> 1:32:56.080
 trust a little bit more what is the nature of trust that you think about any smart contracts

1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:03.520
 what is trust minimization how do we accomplish achieve trust minimization sure sure I think

1:33:03.520 --> 1:33:09.120
 it's important maybe to have a conception of what the alternative is right what is

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:14.200
 the reliable trust minimized off chain and on chain computation and alternative to so

1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:19.120
 this is this is just kind of how I how I see the world in these two in these two camps

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:25.720
 one camp is the traditional what I call brand based or paper guarantee camp and this is the

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:30.440
 world as as pretty much most or all people know it today this is the world where there

1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:35.320
 is a bank logo or insurance company logo or some kind of logo there's a very big building

1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:39.680
 with marble arches and columns you know it's the biggest building in the town is bigger

1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:43.960
 than the church and everybody feels very good everybody is that such a nice logo it's such

1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:49.320
 a big building why don't I give them my my money why don't I interact with them on the

1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:54.720
 basis of any kind of agreement and that's good and that that is definitely better than

1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:59.160
 that not being there and that is definitely a huge improvement for how people you know

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:04.800
 conduct commerce you know letters of credit from from branded entities are very important

1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:12.360
 for global trade to take place in in the early stages of global trade so that's good but

1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:18.480
 it is fundamentally just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it and if the

1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:24.120
 paper agreement you have would say Robin Hood or somebody else suddenly has to change well

1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:28.240
 it changes and you can't really do anything about it you won't be able to change anything

1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:33.000
 about what happened there there's some long terms of service there's some other agreements

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.760
 around all this stuff at at the end of the day that's the brand based and paper guarantee

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:44.280
 world where it's all very vague and opaque and you're kind of hoping for the best because

1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:49.880
 there's a nice logo it's been around a hundred years a lot of marble put a lot of big building

1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:54.280
 lots of marbles this is this is why banks have such nice buildings right it's not because

1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:59.920
 they want to spend money on buildings it's to create confidence in in them as an entity

1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:05.600
 in order for people to transact through them right this is why all these kind of go go

1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:11.520
 to cities that had gold rushes go to cities that needed banking as as a service in certain

1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:16.440
 time periods they're the most beautiful buildings at least in the United States so this is the

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:21.760
 brand based paper guarantee model for which up until now there has never been an alternative

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:26.600
 right so up until now if you had a bad experience with a bank or insurance company or some from

1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:32.080
 some logo somewhere you would only have one option your option would be to go across the

1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:38.680
 road and down the block to another building with another color of marble and another set

1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:43.960
 of agreements that are fundamentally still paper brand agreements right now for the first

1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:51.560
 time you have mathematical agreements you have mad at mathematically guaranteed encryption

1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:59.480
 secured decentralized infrastructure powered agreements right this is really the shift

1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:04.840
 this is really the comparison and the alternative through which people should view all of this

1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:09.560
 in my opinion because there's once again this conception that everything is fine everything

1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:15.040
 works very well well it does it works fine and very well as long as nothing goes wrong

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.240
 and then in the cases when things go wrong which they pretty much invariably at some

1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:24.200
 point do then you find out that well you know turns out they don't have to pay me or turns

1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:29.480
 out I can't trade or turns out the ATMs can be locked up and only give me 66 euros per

1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:33.880
 day whether I'm a business or an individual like what happened in Greece a few years ago

1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:42.800
 right and the the reality is that once that becomes a strong enough kind of realization

1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:47.720
 for people I think they will all just migrate to mathematically guaranteed contracts because

1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:53.480
 why why wouldn't you so in in the world of mathematically guaranteed contracts kind of

1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:58.120
 how do we and cryptographically secured and decentralized infrastructure powered how do

1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:05.000
 we how do we evolve into that world well at the end of the day it comes down to consensus

1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:10.840
 right it comes down to an in a collection of independent nodes a collection of provably

1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:17.880
 independent computing systems arriving at the same conclusion impartially that conclusion

1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:26.000
 might be the transaction is valid between address a and address b address a has one

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.200
 bitcoin wants to send it to address b now address b has one bitcoin right so that's

1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:35.480
 one degree of validation it has certain cryptographic primitives that are used certain levels of

1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:41.160
 cryptography encryption and other and other methods that basically provide clarity and

1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:46.440
 and those guarantees but fundamentally it's this level of consensus that multiple independent

1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:52.040
 computing systems came to the same conclusion verified that conclusion and created a sense

1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:59.240
 of finality created a final state that is globally considered to be the state of a transaction

1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:07.240
 and that is how it's achieved right so it's is achieved by users looking at these mathematical

1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:14.280
 contract systems and saying you know if I have money in a bank there's one single person who

1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:18.200
 controls that money that's the bank they could choose to give me my money or choose not to give

1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:23.240
 you my money and that's great but maybe there's a percentage of what I own that I want to put

1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:28.040
 into another system where there's thousands of independent computing systems that are

1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:34.200
 promising me you know with the help of cryptographic primitives that I will be able to always have

1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:41.800
 access to this whatever this is whatever this you know token is I will at least or the very

1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:48.040
 least I will always have unfettered complete control and access to it so you know that's

1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:52.680
 one example another example is hey we have a hybrid smart contract for something like

1:38:52.680 --> 1:38:59.000
 crop insurance I as the user evaluate where this smart contract runs oh wow the smart contract

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:06.280
 runs on ethereum great thousands of nodes lots of computational security hash power so on and so

1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:11.400
 on then I look at oh well what triggers the contract oh there's this oracle network okay it's

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:17.480
 composed of 25 nodes or 15 nodes gets data from five different weather stations you know I'm

1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:22.920
 comfortable with that I have a certain level of comfort with that hybrid smart contract and its

1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:28.920
 ability to provide me consensus about the transaction once the contract knows what's

1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:34.920
 happened and I'm comfortable with the consensus around the event that controls the contract

1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:40.200
 right because once again that event is what determines what happens with the contract

1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:45.080
 and if the contract is super well written it doesn't matter if the event isn't reliable

1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:49.800
 right so now I've made this determination I've gotten all this clear transparent information

1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:56.360
 about this system that combines the contract code with a decentralized oracle network and

1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.480
 I've made my decision to participate in this decentralized insurance kind of crop insurance

1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:07.480
 policy I've sent the bitcoin or the stablecoin or whatever I have on my on my android phone

1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:13.880
 and then time goes by and let's say it doesn't rain lo and behold the smart contract returned

1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:20.600
 the the relevant amount from the policy back to me I continue my life as as as a farmer

1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:26.520
 and by the way the fact that that happened contributes reputation and contributes proof

1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:32.120
 back to both the contract as something that it can prove to other people that it has settled

1:40:32.840 --> 1:40:37.960
 and the oracle network as something that can prove that it has properly assessed reality

1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:42.680
 or properly triggered a contract and this is where there's you know one of many network

1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:49.000
 effects where the more that smart contracts and oracle networks are used they they themselves

1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:57.400
 generate this immutable on chain data that proves their value and reliability and improving

1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:04.120
 more and more of that in more and more kind of use cases and more and more variants of

1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:11.160
 the same contract they arrive at a greater body of proof that they like I am the decentralized

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:17.800
 cropping the decentralized insurance contract for crop insurance used by a million users

1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:25.080
 and my failure rate is non existent or really low and here's my oracle network and by the way

1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:32.280
 it's also settled a million of these and so it's not the logo right it's not hey what nice what a

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:39.800
 nice logo you have on top of a building above above a train terminal or something it's much more

1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:46.040
 it's much more hey there's a million people there's a million separate contracts that got settled

1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:51.800
 correctly I have all the proof that I could ever need about that and it's it's not something

1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:56.280
 that's very easy to game right because real value was at stake real value was was moved around

1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.720
 and so I I think once again the transparency aspect comes in where you're able to prove

1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:10.840
 that the cryptographically enforced contracts are better that said you can still integrate the

1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:16.760
 traditional banks as long as you create a data feed on the amount of marble that's that's included

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:21.080
 so if that's valuable to you in terms of reputation you can still integrate the marble the amount of

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:29.320
 marble that and the the size of the logo we can still keep the banks around I think we will I

1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:32.920
 I think what'll happen with the banks and all the insurance companies by the way is not that

1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:37.000
 they'll all just die or something I think it'll be just like the internet there'll be some of

1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.480
 them that adopt this yeah and some of them that don't and some of them to do it faster some of

1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:46.040
 them to do it slower and and that's an economic decision that they'll make I think their whole

1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:51.160
 question is is this a foregone conclusion I mean I think you know my answer my answer is yes this

1:42:51.160 --> 1:42:55.640
 is definitely going to be happening I think they still have a question of you know is this going

1:42:55.640 --> 1:43:03.720
 to change my industry but I'm seeing a definite shift in in people's understanding and I think

1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:08.920
 that shift is going to accelerate rapidly as one or two of them of their competitors through their

1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:15.960
 hat in the smart contract ring and say well I have I have smart contracts I guarantee my

1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:23.080
 outcomes to you what do they do for you you know it's risky just use mine and the second some of

1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:27.800
 them start losing business because of that they're gonna they're gonna move very quickly because

1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:31.960
 that's what all of their compensation structures and their all their goal planning structures are

1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:37.080
 based around they're based around what is losing us business or getting us business yeah it's

1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:42.680
 fascinating organizationally though to think about banks they're very old school and their ability

1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:51.720
 to move quickly is questionable to me I just look at basic uh online banking like how good banks

1:43:51.720 --> 1:44:00.040
 are creating a a frictionless online experience and I think they're not very good and so that speaks

1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:05.560
 to the kind of people who are in leadership positions at banks the kind of people they hire

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:13.480
 the kind of culture there is so I do wonder if banks will from inside revolutionize themselves

1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:19.400
 to include smart contracts or whether totally new competitors will have to emerge that basically

1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:28.120
 create new kinds of banks whether what is the company square I think it's a it comes up out of

1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:32.760
 nowhere really with cash app and they have bitcoin on cash app whether they will start

1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:40.120
 incorporating smart contracts and they will revolutionize the the whole banking industry

1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:47.000
 or whether Bank of America will revolutionize themselves from within I'm skeptical on Bank

1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:54.040
 of America but you never know it's in general I'm fascinated by how big organizations whether it's

1:44:54.040 --> 1:45:01.160
 Google and Microsoft or Bank of America pivot hard in a world that's quickly changing I think that

1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:08.600
 takes bold leadership and a lot of firing and a lot of pain and a lot of meetings where the one

1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:14.600
 asshole brings up the from first principles idea that you know what the ways we've been doing stuff

1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:20.600
 in the past require you know we need to throw that out and do stuff totally differently I

1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:25.880
 I know a lot of those assholes in in a lot of these different industries first of all I think

1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:31.800
 they're getting listened to more and second of all I think all of these places as I look at it more

1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:37.320
 and more I think they have a fundamental line of business that they try to protect and then

1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:41.800
 everybody's compensation and everybody's metrics and goals is focused around that line of business

1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:51.880
 so the second that things begin to impact that then everybody will be in a senior meeting

1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:57.000
 and and that asshole will be quite listened to because he will have the only thoughtful

1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:01.960
 explanation as to why this is happening how how things will evolve from there I actually

1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:07.880
 don't know because I you know that hasn't been the case yet but my my thinking is that there

1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:12.520
 will be people who don't want to cannibalize certain parts of their business or don't want to

1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:17.320
 change certain parts of their business and then there will be people who say look I think this

1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:25.160
 is how the world is going to work we're going to make a very very heavy kind of set of commitments

1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:31.080
 to put resources towards this I already see that but with with a few banks working working on various

1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:36.680
 blockchain based systems but granted they've been working on those for years so I I I think all of

1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:42.120
 this comes down to these these kind of quarterly earnings calls where somebody asks them hey you

1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:47.720
 know I saw that bank over there once the blockchain bond or or a smart contract derivative platform

1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:52.520
 and I also saw that they made you know ten billion dollars in revenues or or ten billion

1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:57.400
 dollars in volume or whatever it is from from that what's your plan right on the earnings call

1:46:58.040 --> 1:47:03.240
 and I promise you by the next earnings call there's a plan and then the question on the next one

1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:08.360
 is but when's the plan going to happen and then by the next earnings call it's a plan is happening

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:12.760
 and and that's that's that's what these people are sensitive to that's what these organizations are

1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:18.280
 structured around it's not completely economically like disconnected right they have this core business

1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:26.120
 they want to protect it I understand that that idea but I think the the problem with that is

1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:33.800
 sometimes it requires it requires this myopic focus right and and that's what all all the innovation

1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.440
 stuff is about every time somebody at a corporate entity is about innovation they're they're trying

1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:44.040
 to sidestep this but but once again the incentives to maintain whatever the core business is is so

1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:52.360
 strong that the innovation people even even though they they are there um you know they get I think

1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:57.720
 they get a phone call and go like what are we doing for this and and and the ones that actually

1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:02.920
 did good work and got ready to do something for this have have done their you know their employer

1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:08.760
 and their organization a very positive service whereas the ones that aren't ready I mean you know

1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:12.120
 they'll make up something and you know maybe they're really smart and they'll get it together I don't

1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:19.080
 I don't know can we talk about tokens a little bit generally speaking there's been a meteoric

1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:23.560
 rise of a bunch of different tokens we could just talk about bitcoin and ethereum as examples

1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:31.240
 bitcoin I think crossed $60,000 in value what are your thoughts in general on this rise what's

1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:38.680
 the future of bitcoin what's the future of ethereum there's there's the total value locked metric

1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:44.840
 that I think generalizes the different kind of value of these of these tokens

1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:53.240
 means what is the future value and impact of cryptocurrency look like if we look through

1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:59.480
 the lens of these tokens I think valuing all these tokens and and determining that isn't

1:48:59.480 --> 1:49:03.320
 something I'm particularly great at I haven't spent a lot of time on that I've spent the

1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:08.040
 majority vast majority of my time on building these systems and architecting them and getting

1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:12.280
 them to fruition and getting them to a place where they operate properly on both the technical

1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:17.560
 and the crypto economic and in every other in in every other sense I think with bitcoin there is

1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:26.360
 a certain conception of non governmental fiat money that bitcoin is really the first

1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:32.520
 creator of right so there's this very powerful idea called fiat money it's basically

1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:39.080
 more or less a kind of 40 year experiment I think on august 15th of this year is is maybe

1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:42.840
 I think given the 40th anniversary you know a government can say hey I have a currency

1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:50.520
 and it's worth something and and here it is in terms of the way that governments have stopped

1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:54.520
 that in the past is if anyone tries to make another fiat currency in their country they

1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:59.400
 immediately shut it down right they immediately say hey this is really bad you've done something

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:05.080
 really bad it's time for you to stop don't do it anymore and it stops right that's been the history

1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:11.320
 of non governmental fiat currency bitcoin is really due to its decentralized nature

1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:16.840
 the first um and possibly in some cases in many people's minds they still the only

1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:23.480
 true non governmental fiat currency now how powerful is non governmental fiat currency

1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:32.680
 I have no idea right this is why so it's really as powerful as the ideas that people ascribe to it

1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:38.600
 it are right so let's say people start saying like right now people are saying hey it's internet

1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:44.440
 money it's the money of the internet okay great what's that worth I don't know it's probably worth

1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:50.520
 a lot I have no idea what it's worth but it's worth as an idea as a concept to underpin the fiat

1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:58.440
 money the let there be aspect of fiat and of bitcoin you basically look at it and you say

1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:05.560
 yeah internet money okay that could be worth whatever you know 60,000 600,000 great question

1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:12.360
 right there are other versions of the world right where people say you know um there are

1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:17.880
 countries that don't have a good fiat currency and I see a lot of people using bitcoin so bitcoin

1:51:17.880 --> 1:51:25.000
 isn't internet money it's um countries without a good currency money so all the countries without

1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:32.200
 a good currency now use bitcoin and you know let there be bitcoin as this right as this

1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:36.440
 conception of bitcoin what's the value of that I don't know that's a great question probably

1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:43.560
 probably huge amount of value um then there's then there's a further conception of bitcoin as some

1:51:43.560 --> 1:51:48.840
 you know digital gold there's a scarcity dynamic there's there's all these other kinds of dynamics

1:51:48.840 --> 1:51:57.880
 what is a portable version of digital gold with some kind of built in built in scarcity

1:51:57.880 --> 1:52:05.000
 worth you know kind of artificially created scarcity what's that worth I don't know that's

1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:11.320
 that's a great question I haven't done the analysis on that is the point might be worth a lot what is

1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:18.360
 it all worth if all three of these things you know flow into the same fiat kind of let there be

1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:23.720
 bitcoin as these three things conception of bitcoin I don't know what that's worth I also

1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:29.240
 know what that's worth but could be worth a huge amount so I think what it's it's not I don't think

1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:33.720
 it's I personally don't think it's super important what I think it's worth or what many other people

1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:38.120
 think it's worth I don't think that's that's really that important I think what's probably important

1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:47.800
 is understanding what the societal conception of bitcoin is and how does that societal conception

1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:56.360
 evolve over time and that interestingly enough doesn't just depend on you know you or me or the

1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:01.480
 people who made bitcoin or anything else it actually depends on current events so for example if

1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:07.320
 people suddenly say I'm more and more worried about fiat currency I'm more and more worried

1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:13.480
 that governmental fiat even if it's the most reliable version of that is not as good as I

1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:20.120
 thought it was maybe I should go on the PayPal app maybe I should get some bitcoin just in case

1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:28.040
 what's the world where bitcoin is a certain percentage of everyone's ownership as a hedge

1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:34.920
 against governmental fiat money not being so good having done the analysis but another example

1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:40.600
 right here's this conception that's that's the conception so when I look at bitcoin what I see

1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:46.920
 is a lot of these fascinating conceptions of of what the fiat let there be value of bitcoin is

1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:53.240
 by the way all of them could be true maybe some of them are true maybe some of them aren't true

1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:57.960
 and and the fascinating thing is is that I've seen this conception change right so when I started

1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:04.040
 in the bitcoin space the conception was micropayments the the the the cost of bitcoin is low we'll

1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:10.200
 have micropayments micropayments are wonderful for machine to machine transactions micropayments

1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:15.640
 are wonderful the emerging market and that's fine right and and and that was one conception of bitcoin

1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:21.720
 as let there be bitcoin as micropayments platform right but then the value rose and things changed

1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:27.160
 there was enough expansion in certain ways and and now the conception has evolved into this other

1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:34.680
 conception but but at the end of the day I think governments have a very clear set of steps for

1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:42.360
 directing the public's conception of their fiat right they say our fiat is worth this for these

1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:49.080
 these these reasons bitcoin doesn't have that bitcoin doesn't have an official bitcoin spokesperson

1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:54.120
 that goes out and says the non governmental money called bitcoin the non governmental fiat

1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:58.920
 money called bitcoin has value on the basis of this this this and this here's our fiscal budget

1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:03.960
 here's our future plans you know our money will continue to be safe and secure and reliable

1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:10.120
 and so it's what would that hole creates is a is a hole that we all fill right we all basically

1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:17.400
 come to some vague kind of group understanding that you know bitcoin is worth is worth this because

1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:27.640
 it is tied let it is tied to um you know let's say all non governmental fiat money comes into

1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:34.760
 question everybody doubts it possibly due to inflation and everybody says you know this is

1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:42.440
 nice but i'd like to keep 10 20 percent of my of my wealth in non governmental fiat just in case

1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:50.200
 um you know what what are those numbers i mean if that happens you know i'm guessing you can add

1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:56.840
 a few zeros i like how you say i haven't done the analysis as if i'm sure a lot of people have done

1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:02.520
 quote unquote analysis but it's not it's still speculation nobody can predict the future especially

1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:10.040
 when so much of it has to do with a large number of people holding an idea in their mind as to the

1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:15.240
 importance of a particular technology like bitcoin there's a lot of excitement by its possibilities

1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:21.240
 but the number of zeros you add is uh is an open question and nobody can do a perfect analysis

1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:33.000
 except uh whoever created this simulation let me ask you this question who is Satoshi Nakamoto

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:46.040
 there's quite a few people who suggest that person is you so is it you no who do you think it could

1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:52.200
 be i don't know who it is i i think if i had to guess it's probably a group of people some of

1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:58.280
 which might not even be around anymore um you know obviously i'm very grateful to if this is a singular

1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:01.960
 or a group of people for kicking off this entire industry and making this amazing change in the

1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:07.240
 world that you know i have the the privilege and luxury of of being part of an in some small way

1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:14.280
 in the work that i do um i think also this kind of focus on who is satoshi or who isn't satoshi

1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:21.400
 shouldn't in my opinion matter so much because regardless of who it is that in my opinion should

1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:29.800
 have no substantial significant effect or bearing on the functioning or the value or the use or the

1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:36.520
 or the security of of the bitcoin system right so i i think whoever it is they're probably better

1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:43.000
 off not not not making that public and i think beyond that um whoever it turned out to be shouldn't

1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:49.960
 matter because it has nothing to do with how the system is made useful or secure or anything else

1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:56.440
 and so i think that's the um you know that's the point of view that i have now if you were satoshi

1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:04.280
 nakamoto would you tell me because you said they shouldn't whoever satoshi is you should keep that

1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:11.400
 private so would you tell it to me or no we're in some kind of weird like a thought experiment here

1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:19.240
 here if if i was this guy um let me think about this which i'm not by the way i am not yeah but

1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:31.480
 if you were would you say it um i think probably not i don't see the i i i think that they would

1:58:31.480 --> 1:58:37.240
 cause a lot of distraction and a lot of weird stuff and so realistically i don't think it would help

1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:43.160
 anybody or even the person who who discloses it but just to be clear i am not and whoever it is

1:58:43.720 --> 1:58:47.240
 i think they haven't said anything because they don't want the attention and they don't want the

1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:51.480
 distraction and they don't want all the problems from this and that's that makes sense to me

1:58:51.480 --> 1:58:57.320
 conceptually it's fascinating to think if they're still out there and part of the the bitcoin the

1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:07.080
 cryptocurrency community and um it is inspiring to think that if they're out there that they're not

1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:12.440
 revealing their identity because it would be a distraction that's kind of inspiring that people

1:59:12.440 --> 1:59:18.200
 are like that just like george washington a relinquishing powers inspiring because it's

1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:23.640
 ultimately about the progress of the community now some kind of ego driven attention scheme

1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:30.680
 again very inspiring the humans that they're best are inspiring what do you think about the

1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:36.280
 certainty that people in the bitcoin maximus community have about this particular piece

1:59:36.280 --> 1:59:42.120
 of technology bitcoin is there something interesting that you think that you might want

1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:50.680
 to say about this community or is it just is what it is i think at the end of the day results speak

1:59:50.680 --> 1:59:57.400
 for themselves and bitcoin has had an amazing impact on our industry and had has had an amazing

1:59:57.400 --> 2:00:03.400
 impact on the world and i think you know the result is still that bitcoin is very widely adopted

2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:08.520
 and driving um the adoption of our industry in many ways so i think it's very difficult for people

2:00:08.520 --> 2:00:14.200
 to say that you know bitcoin maximus don't have something that they can latch on to and say hey

2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:19.960
 there's something very real here i i think there's been decisions made by the bitcoin community and

2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:27.000
 the people who made the bitcoin protocol to focus it on bitcoin and to focus in on the

2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:32.040
 kind of storing of the ledger of bitcoin and the information about bitcoin and the transaction of

2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:37.560
 bitcoin and to focus on securing that and i you know i understand why that decision was made to

2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:43.000
 a certain degree right it was about focus it is it was about getting something worthwhile right

2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:49.160
 without adding additional features and additional risk and you know that decision is is a decision

2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:56.840
 that was made and has kind of the benefits of focus and the benefits of a certain amount of

2:00:56.840 --> 2:01:03.240
 security and a certain amount of guarantees around bitcoin and and what that is and and the

2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:10.760
 value of that and then it has certain limitations you know as a consequence of of of doing less

2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:14.840
 or having the system hold data that isn't related to bitcoin or not having the system

2:01:14.840 --> 2:01:21.160
 hold contracts contractual outcomes or smart contract code so i i think it's just kind of

2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:25.960
 a decision right and and i i i understand why they're excited and i'm very excited i started

2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:31.880
 in this industry going to bitcoin meetups and i met a lot of fantastic people libertarian people

2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:36.280
 that wanted to see the world work differently and shared a lot of my beliefs and a lot of my

2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:42.360
 points of view and so you know anyone who's been in the industry as long as i have um

2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:48.200
 has had to come um from the bitcoin ecosystem by virtue of kind of starting out that early

2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:55.080
 so i have an unbelievable amount of respect and um admiration and gratitude for for bitcoin and

2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:58.840
 that it exists and everything that it's done and that it birthed this industry there's absolutely

2:01:58.840 --> 2:02:04.760
 no doubt about that you know at the same time whatever design decisions people make are the

2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:09.960
 design decisions they make right and so they if you've made a design decision that this ledger

2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:15.480
 and this thing will be about bitcoin it won't be about colored coins it won't be about op return at

2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:22.840
 80 bytes it won't be about these other kind of um nuances that you don't want this to be about

2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:27.000
 then that's fine that's that's fine and that's that's that's a logical decision that's and it's

2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:33.000
 called focus and focus has a lot of value um and a lot of great um technology products have

2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:39.160
 focused on something and and and done that and then there's a lot of smart people around bitcoin

2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:44.440
 building um kind of additional systems that anchor their security within bitcoin and i

2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:49.640
 think that's an interesting approach that could that could bear fruit i think it'll eventually

2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:55.160
 require an interaction with a bitcoin protocol in more advanced ways and then there will be another

2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:00.760
 question of you know what is the design decision for bitcoin is it that bitcoin will be just about

2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:09.320
 the bitcoin ledger or does bitcoin want to evolve into um you know an anchor for all these other

2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:15.720
 other systems and and maybe create additional data you know kind of more data on chain on the

2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:21.800
 bitcoin blockchain related to that so i i'm excited to see how that evolves but until then

2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:26.440
 kind of results speak for themselves and the results that bitcoin has achieved for our industry

2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:31.560
 and for itself as you know kind of the dominant cryptocurrency and and the conception of our

2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:37.320
 industry that people interact with first is obviously very important and something that um

2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:41.560
 i think really everybody in our industry is grateful for right because without bitcoin

2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:46.200
 where where where would our industry be and that's obviously something that we we can't forget

2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:54.120
 what are your thoughts about ethereum in this in the chain link distributed oracle network world

2:03:54.120 --> 2:04:02.680
 world is a competition is a collaboration is a complementary technology what do you think about

2:04:02.680 --> 2:04:08.520
 ethereum how much do you think about ethereum what role does it have yeah i i think about a lot i

2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:13.880
 think it's complete we're completely complementary so there's no competitive dynamics in my opinion

2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:19.160
 we are completely collaborative and complementary with ethereum and all other blockchains and all

2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:26.440
 other layer twos that operate a contract right so we do not seek to operate a smart contract we

2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:34.200
 seek to augment and enable smart contracts to go further in what they're able to do in fact oracle

2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:38.840
 networks have some value but they don't have nearly as much value in what they do if there

2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:43.800
 isn't a mission critical system like a smart contract that needs their data right so we've

2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:50.520
 made our own explicit design decisions in our own and created our own focus around guaranteeing that

2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:56.680
 smart contracts can go further we've already done that right decentralized finance the the

2:04:56.680 --> 2:05:00.280
 rate at which we put data is to a degree the rate at which certain decentralized financial

2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:05.320
 markets grow and as we put more data we see more financial products go live gaming we

2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:10.600
 provide vrf so we have this kind of focus and it's a very useful useful and valuable kind of

2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:18.440
 valuable for our industry focus at at the end of the day i think that smart contract platforms

2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:24.520
 like ethereum made a different set of design decisions from bitcoin and others and they focused

2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:31.640
 on creating the smart contract capability and and and and they kind of wanted that functionality

2:05:31.640 --> 2:05:35.560
 to exist and i think since then there's been a number of people that try to improve on that or

2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:41.800
 try to you know make variants of that from our point of view we want to support smart contracts

2:05:41.800 --> 2:05:47.960
 in all of their variations and in all of their use cases so one of the things that i personally

2:05:47.960 --> 2:05:53.800
 like about chainlink is their ability or chainlink's ability the chainlink network's ability to be

2:05:53.800 --> 2:05:59.640
 useful to many different chains and across many different use cases i'm personally you know a

2:05:59.640 --> 2:06:04.280
 fan of ethereum ethereum has done a huge amount for our industry as well ethereum took us from a

2:06:04.280 --> 2:06:09.640
 world where it literally took months to make a new smart contract by being forced to code it into

2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:15.800
 a protocol you had to go to the protocol developers and you had to say hey i need a dex or i need

2:06:15.800 --> 2:06:22.200
 some kind of smart contract put it in the protocol itself put it in the actual blockchain mining and

2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:26.680
 kind of block generation transaction generation protocol that would take months or sometimes

2:06:26.680 --> 2:06:30.840
 even over a year that was a horrible experience and and and obviously very few people wanted to

2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:35.160
 participate in that and so very few people made smart contracts which i was not a fan of right

2:06:35.800 --> 2:06:41.240
 and then ethereum came along and really did a lot of innovative things and introduced this

2:06:41.240 --> 2:06:46.040
 approach to scriptable smart contracts where you could script all of these different conditions

2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:52.120
 and i i i found that fascinating before ethereum i found that fascinating once ethereum arrived

2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:56.600
 i found it fascinating after ethereum launched and i still find it fascinating and i'm i'm i'm

2:06:56.600 --> 2:07:01.320
 also very grateful to the italic and the ethereum community and and all the core developers there

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:06.600
 for taking our industry a step further so i think they absolutely deserve a huge amount of credit

2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:13.000
 for taking our industry from it takes months to make a really small smart contract to it takes

2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:18.280
 you know weeks to make a relatively secure relatively advanced piece of on chain code

2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:24.040
 that anybody can script and people can do audits on and you know that's that's an unbelievable

2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:29.640
 leap forward for our industry and i'm i'm i'm genuinely grateful to them for that i think the

2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:37.960
 next step in line with our body of work is how does that scriptable on chain code become more

2:07:37.960 --> 2:07:45.080
 advanced in its interaction with all of the systems and events in the real world which is in my

2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:50.520
 opinion the final missing piece of the puzzle right so my body of work the body of work that i'm

2:07:50.520 --> 2:07:55.160
 involved in would not be where it is right now without bitcoin by any measure it wouldn't even

2:07:55.160 --> 2:08:00.520
 be where it is now without ethereum and the growth in smart contract development that they've created

2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:06.120
 and now what what i think is going to happen next is there will be a lot of different smart

2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:11.080
 contract platforms a lot of different layer twos some of them will be private for enterprise some

2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:16.520
 of them will be public there will be some public winners in certain geographies for maybe regulation

2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:22.120
 reasons maybe other reasons there will be other public winners you know the larger internet and

2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:25.320
 there will be a number of different people building smart contracts in different languages

2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:31.960
 we are excited and you know i am excited and the chain link community is excited and and

2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:38.920
 basically there's a lot of i mean for lack of a better word excitement in seeing our industry

2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:47.880
 graduate to providing more use cases more usable hybrid smart contracts right because once again

2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:52.520
 it's absolutely amazing that bitcoin created non governmental fiat money it's an unbelievable

2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:57.400
 innovation and invented the centralized infrastructure and and and birth our industry

2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:02.680
 it's an unbelievably great achievement an amazing achievement that we now have scriptable smart

2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:08.840
 contracts through something like ethereum once again monumental achievement in my opinion once

2:09:08.840 --> 2:09:14.280
 again we still need to look to the future we need to look to how do we take the decentralized

2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:19.960
 infrastructure concepts that bitcoin initially put forward that ethereum then improved upon and

2:09:19.960 --> 2:09:25.960
 created into these scriptable smart contract formats and how do we expand that into the world

2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:31.240
 of real world outcomes to change the global financial industry the global trade industry

2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:36.120
 the global data marketplace industry you know the and and and many other global industries

2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:41.320
 you mentioned results speak for themselves and how design decisions have consequences

2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:49.240
 you've the chain link community have come up with a lot of brilliant designs so how do you think

2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:55.960
 through the design choices that you're facing where you can't predict the future but you're

2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:05.080
 trying to create a better future is there something low level introspective advice

2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:10.360
 that you can give or describe as to how you think through those decisions or high level

2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:16.680
 how you think about those decisions sure absolutely um i think i think that's a great

2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:21.240
 question and i think that actually gets to the core of what the chain link network is

2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:29.160
 supposed to achieve we are supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system so once again this

2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:33.640
 is the big difference between chain link and oracle networks in general and blockchains in my

2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:39.080
 opinion blockchains do not seek to be maximally flexible right they say here's my block size

2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:45.320
 here's the transaction types you can you you can put in those blocks here's the contract language

2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:51.240
 i have here's here's kind of my blockchain system right here's the here's the fee structure for those

2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:55.720
 blocks they're going to keep getting you know kind of composed transactions are going to get

2:10:55.720 --> 2:10:59.400
 put into blocks blocks will get connected and and it'll continue right and that's a very focused

2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:04.280
 type of system and that's great and that makes sense because it's focused on creating security

2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:10.200
 for that category of on chain activity which is once again a critical critical part of building

2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:14.680
 a highly transparent system and something that chain link enables and you know doesn't compete

2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:22.440
 with and just enables to do more oracle networks conversely have to interact with all the world's

2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:28.360
 data and provide all the services that blockchains don't provide right so there's kind of a spectrum

2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:33.560
 on one end of the spectrum you have blockchains that are highly secure highly reliable highly

2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:39.800
 tamper proof highly transparent but are not very feature rich for example they cannot talk to an

2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:45.160
 api many of them can't generate randomness they cannot do some kind of privacy preserving

2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:50.920
 computation so they're very secure and they're these kind of data structures and smart contract

2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:58.680
 platforms to hold on chain code that can define conditions receive value pay value back out under

2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:03.800
 conditions and create transparency around all that which makes perfect sense and then there's

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:09.960
 oracles and oracle networks that is all the world's data right we're talking about taking

2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:15.800
 all the world's data and making it consumable for all the world's use cases that have trust issues

2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:21.720
 so the amount of variability there is absolutely massive right it's like the the decentralized

2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:25.960
 oracle network and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network needs to meet

2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:33.320
 is going to vary very widely from an insurance contract to a lending contract to an ad network

2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:39.960
 contract to the data sales contract that that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts

2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:47.720
 so really the ability of a decentralized oracle network to flexibly address all of those requirements

2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:54.440
 is what's necessary so flexibility is the goal whereas with on chain like bitcoin

2:12:54.440 --> 2:13:03.960
 flexibility is the enemy in a sense that you want security you want the focus there and

2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:09.080
 in that kind of world design decisions have huge consequences and then if you look at the

2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:16.280
 distributed oracle network side you want to remove the restrictions of design choices you

2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:23.640
 want to provide maximum flexibility then so it's a completely separate kind of design framework

2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:27.240
 it's a slightly different problem right because we're not trying to define

2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:32.040
 transaction types fitting into blocks on a certain timeline of those blocks being generated

2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:36.600
 we're trying to say hey there's this world of services or this world of data that's not very

2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:41.320
 deterministic but it's unbelievably useful to these smart contracts over here and actually

2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:45.640
 they need it to even exist and we really want them to exist because once they exist it's going to

2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:50.680
 completely redefine what our whole industry is known for right and defined NFTs are not even the

2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:56.040
 tip of the iceberg they're like like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg and so our

2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:04.200
 goal is to create a framework and an infrastructure and a software that allows people to compose

2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:09.880
 decentralized oracle networks right so initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network

2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:15.160
 of seven nodes that goes to three data sources to trigger your contract worth a million dollars

2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:19.000
 and that's where you could start and then let's say your smart contract your DeFi smart contract

2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.320
 goes to a billion dollars well then you need to make some changes right you need to go from seven

2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:29.960
 nodes to 15 or maybe 31 nodes and you need to go from three data sources to five or seven

2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:36.760
 and you maybe need to create some some kind of what we call circuit breakers and some other checks

2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:41.080
 and you need to make sure that the decentralized oracle network comes to consensus around those

2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:44.600
 checks because now the decentralized oracle network isn't controlling a million dollars it's

2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:49.160
 controlling a billion dollars and we have decentralized oracle networks that control well over a billion

2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:53.720
 dollars multiple billions of dollars and we see them growing and getting more advanced data sources

2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:58.520
 and more advanced features and then if somebody else comes and says well you know I don't really

2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:02.840
 want to make a DeFi product I want to make crop insurance and I have a completely different set

2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:08.040
 of conditions I want this method of consensus and I want data to be aggregated in this way but not

2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:11.720
 the way that you do for decentralized financial products I mean what are we supposed to tell

2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:16.440
 them we're supposed to tell them no you know our decentralized oracle network can't let you do that

2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:21.880
 and you're you know you can go and and wait another five years until until somebody builds it for you

2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:29.320
 that's not what we want to do right what we want to do is be able to say absolutely here's an example

2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:36.280
 of how somebody else made a decentralized oracle network for for weather insurance right here's

2:15:36.280 --> 2:15:42.920
 a template change that template evolve it to meet your needs and then someone else comes and says hey

2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:49.080
 I have some some other use case in gaming right I want to make NFTs related to real world sports

2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:55.000
 events or I want to do whatever I want to do with with some kind of sports related data wonderful

2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:00.760
 here's the framework here are your risk dynamics here's a collection of node operators here's a

2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:08.360
 set of pre preintegrated data sources here's a reputation system to assess the quality of your

2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:13.560
 ensemble of nodes here's a way to scale that up as the as the value in your contract scales

2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:20.760
 here's all the tools that you need to build this contract and and what we actually see now as we as

2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:25.480
 there are multiple types of computations and data's data sources that are provided by different

2:16:25.480 --> 2:16:32.280
 decentralized oracle networks of which there are now hundreds we now see that a single hybrid

2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:37.560
 smart contract might use multiple decentralized oracle networks so there might be a hybrid smart

2:16:37.560 --> 2:16:43.160
 contract that uses a price data decentralized oracle network a proof of reserve oracle network

2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:49.160
 a randomness oracle network and I think we're going to continue to see this dynamic that more

2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:55.960
 and more advanced contracts compose various decentralized oracle networks into more advanced

2:16:55.960 --> 2:17:03.400
 use cases and this is this is the dynamic that you know we're focused on enabling and I think

2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:08.520
 it's actually a very virtuous cycle for everybody because the more of these hybrid smart contracts

2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:15.480
 we enable on ethereum and and other blockchains the more our industry provides real world outcomes

2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:21.080
 to the larger world which is at the end of the day what I think everybody in our industry wants

2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:27.720
 everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts to become the way that global finance

2:17:27.720 --> 2:17:33.480
 works global trade works global insurance products work because they will inherently need both a

2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:39.560
 blockchain on which on which the contract itself lives and an oracle network that powers all of

2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:45.720
 the other interactions right as a developer how would you recommend somebody listening to this

2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:55.800
 but also me to get started with smart contracts and to get started with hybrid smart contracts

2:17:57.160 --> 2:18:01.720
 well well for hybrid smart contracts i'm going to have to do some kind of shameless promotion

2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:09.480
 please where let me twist your arm thank you um i i think you can go to our youtube we we have a

2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:14.200
 number of developer tutorials chain link youtube yeah chain link you i think you just started

2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:19.880
 chain link on youtube you should you should find it um beyond that we recently had a hackathon we

2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:25.880
 we had a huge amount of very very kind of advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built to elaborate

2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:31.560
 on that you had a hackathon is that something that people can follow along like a video or

2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:38.120
 there's web page traces of what happened or is there a future actual hackathons that people

2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:42.680
 could literally participate there's plenty of more hackathons coming up we want to enable as many

2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:47.400
 developers in web three and web two to build hybrid smart contracts as a way to redefine our

2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:53.000
 industry and and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life um there are definitely

2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:57.400
 going to be more hackathons so people should go and and pre register register on a list to get

2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:01.160
 involved in that that's a great resource where we have a lot of speakers and a lot of educational

2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:06.840
 tools they happen over a course of weeks not days so there's a long time for people to work on these

2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:11.480
 things at the speed that they that they find comfortable two questions one is there a kind

2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:19.480
 of hello world entry point for uh hybrid smart contracts and two on the hackathon side like

2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:24.680
 what kind of stuff do you see people building at first just kind of getting their feet wet

2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:29.560
 like why in terms of the kind of applications that could be enabled i mean there's there's

2:19:29.560 --> 2:19:35.240
 unbelievable things that that that we see people building i think how to get your feedback i think

2:19:35.240 --> 2:19:39.480
 the hello world is probably defy because it's pretty straightforward and there's a large amount of

2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:43.880
 data sources that we already have putting data on chain on testnet which is the test environment

2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:48.360
 in which people would build so i think defy is probably to a certain degree the most exciting

2:19:48.360 --> 2:19:54.600
 for certain people and pretty pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials and the amount of

2:19:54.600 --> 2:19:59.400
 contracts to see how people have already built it um i think beyond that we see people building

2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:04.600
 amazing things at these hackathons in the previous hackathon we saw somebody build a smart contract

2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:13.080
 that allows the rental someone to rent out their tesla right so it allows the tesla api to give

2:20:13.080 --> 2:20:18.840
 someone else access and rent out someone's tesla on the basis of a smart contract kind of coordinating

2:20:18.840 --> 2:20:24.120
 payment which was you know which was kind of amazing the the more recent hackathon we saw

2:20:24.120 --> 2:20:28.680
 something called d bridge which is a cross chain solution that loses oracle networks to confirm

2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:36.120
 data on different chains so i i think the things that people build will will just become expansive

2:20:36.120 --> 2:20:42.760
 and varied in ways that i can't can't even imagine um but i i think this recent hackathon saw

2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:48.120
 a huge huge list of different um different kind of winners in different categories and there's

2:20:48.120 --> 2:20:52.600
 so many different categories we even have a gov tech category and a whole a whole a whole bunch

2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:56.440
 of things if people want to see what's possible they can go look at the winners i think that's

2:20:56.440 --> 2:21:02.280
 that's probably a good idea at yeah that's that'll be on the side of the hackathon there's a blog

2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:08.360
 related to that and we're going to have more of these and what once again our our explicit goal

2:21:08.360 --> 2:21:14.280
 is to take our industry into this world of hybrid smart contracts which which just benefits

2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:20.520
 everybody it makes more on chain activity it it helps provide real world value to the average

2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:26.600
 person from all of this infrastructure period and at the end of the day i think that it just

2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:32.520
 redefines what our industry is about through use cases right because if you only learn through our

2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:37.560
 industry from the point of view of a single use case like the nft use case or some other use case

2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:43.000
 that's what our industry is about and the more of these use cases that people can make available

2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:48.680
 to the average person or to the fintech world or to the insurance world or wherever the faster

2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:55.080
 our industry will not just be about bitcoins or tokens it will be about changing global finance

2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:59.640
 changing global insurance changing global trade and and that's the change in the world

2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:05.400
 that i and a lot of other people in this industry i think got got into this for now it's funny you've

2:22:05.400 --> 2:22:11.720
 mentioned about uh you've had a lot of kind words to say about bitcoin and ethereum as important

2:22:11.720 --> 2:22:17.320
 technology that paved the way for the future and you somehow did not mention one of the most

2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:23.000
 profound pieces of technology which is dogecoin uh what are your thoughts about this particular uh

2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:28.840
 revolutionary technology and what are your thoughts about dogecoin going to the moon

2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:35.240
 to mars and outside of the solar system i think dogecoin is um is a very interesting

2:22:35.240 --> 2:22:41.320
 kind of uh probably closer to a social experiment than than anything else isn't everything a social

2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:48.040
 experiment yeah i i guess that's fair to to a degree um i think it's fascinating how how that's

2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:53.320
 evolved um i think the people that made it made it with certain you know goals in mind and then

2:22:53.320 --> 2:22:58.600
 it's kind of taken on a life of its own i don't fully understand exactly why it's taken on a

2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:04.120
 life of of its own at this point um i once again i don't spend too much time thinking about you know

2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:09.720
 different tokens and and and how they're evolving i'm much more focused on on the launching and um

2:23:09.720 --> 2:23:17.000
 the technology around trust and all those kinds of ideas but you know i think one of the fascinating

2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:26.520
 things about dogecoin is the how technology that is that leverages social dynamics that

2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:34.760
 technology's ability to utilize fun and memes to spread i think it's really interesting i i

2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:40.120
 don't think it should be discounted as a as a i think i tweeted today something about like the

2:23:40.120 --> 2:23:48.840
 fundamental force field of fun uh that fun has an effect on the spacetime so general relativity

2:23:49.640 --> 2:23:57.640
 describes how mass and energy can curve spacetime and i was just giving an example that when life

2:23:57.640 --> 2:24:03.400
 is fun it seems short when life is not fun it seems very long so fun has a very similar effect on

2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:09.080
 spacetime like in curved spacetime in that same sense there there is a power to the meme

2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:15.480
 and i think dogecoin illustrates that i think elon is an example of somebody that uses dogecoin

2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:21.400
 i don't know his philosophy but in particular in this aspect but he does use it effectively

2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:27.720
 to excite the world in a fun way about the possibilities of future technologies like

2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:34.520
 cryptocurrency i think the bitcoin world is very serious right now and we've spoken to

2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:41.960
 about bitcoin maxim list there is very little space for fun and joking in the bitcoin world

2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:49.800
 but there's still a little bit of fun and humor left in the dogecoin world in that sense i think

2:24:49.800 --> 2:24:57.720
 it's exceptionally powerful to inspire to excite to uh to be able to talk about stuff without

2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:08.200
 without the seriousness of financial impact that now certain cryptocurrencies have like bitcoin

2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:14.840
 so i keep an eye on that i've previously mentioned that dogecoin i think is a fascinating piece of

2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:22.120
 technology because i do think cryptocurrency is much bigger than uh the the technology like

2:25:22.120 --> 2:25:28.760
 they that you focus on there is also a social element that you also spoke to that's uh i think

2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:35.640
 not quite yet understood and it's fascinating to watch especially as it co evolves with the

2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:41.560
 different tools on the internet different social networks social network mechanisms on the internet

2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:50.840
 so i'm a huge supporter of dogecoin because i'm a huge supporter of fun i'm i'm fascinated to see

2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:57.640
 how how to work out you think i'll go to the moon you think it'll be the first cryptocurrency to

2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:04.680
 land on the moon i i couldn't say i haven't i haven't done the analysis as i said before i haven't

2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:12.440
 done the analysis well yeah no matter what i do hope we uh we'll get humans back on the moon

2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:17.720
 and uh hopefully get humans on mars soon doge doge dogecoin bitcoin

2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:27.720
 or not let me ask you about books and movies what books and movies in your life

2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:37.320
 life long ago when you were a baby surge or today had an impact on you maybe you would

2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:45.400
 recommend to others and and maybe what ideas you took away from those books movies coloring books

2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:53.080
 children's books blogs whatever yeah yeah sure um so i i think one of the things that had a

2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:59.000
 very big impact on me were playdoh's dialogues and particularly protagonist and gorgeous as as

2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:06.280
 as some of the two initial ones i i think what playdoh's dialogues do very well is they give

2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:13.000
 people a clear picture of what dialogue looks like and what the assessment of information um

2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:20.280
 probably should look like right and how the dissection and analysis of an idea is very important

2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:23.640
 and how it can actually be taken in either direction but at the end of the day

2:27:24.440 --> 2:27:32.200
 that the process of eliminating um kind of this fuzzy thinking and arriving at whether it's an

2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:37.480
 external dialogue or an internal dialogue about an accurate picture of reality is actually very

2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:43.400
 important and so i i think i'm very lucky to have read um the dialogues when i was uh in my

2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:48.680
 early teenage years and it had a very large impact on me because it kind of showed me that you know

2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:55.400
 nobody knows what they're talking about i would i would uh play out dialogues in my mind and i would

2:27:55.400 --> 2:28:00.360
 engage in certain dialogues with with um with different people and what you know the platonic

2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:07.000
 dialogue showed me was kind of how to tell when someone has no clue and a lot of people are very

2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:14.360
 good at um kind of say they have a clue right saying like here's how the world works here's

2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:17.080
 what you should do with your life here's what you should do with your time here's what you

2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:20.120
 should do with your money here's what you should do with your attention here's what you

2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:26.920
 should do with all these things and i think the ability to evaluate information generally

2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:33.720
 is something that is surprisingly under taught i i don't actually understand why there isn't a course

2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:39.560
 in like high schools or universities that's just like here is how you evaluate information here's

2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:45.560
 how you engage in external dialogue and internal dialogue to arrive at an accurate picture of reality

2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:49.720
 rather than the picture of reality that other people want you to have for their benefit most often

2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:56.040
 right and at the end of the day um i think that put me down a path to really try and understand

2:28:57.080 --> 2:29:04.600
 beyond that um i think biographies have had a very large impact on me um you know plutarchs

2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:09.480
 greek and roman lives after i read plato i started reading a bunch of stuff greek stuff i was just like

2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:14.280
 these greek guys they really know how it is you know they did this 2000 years ago and they still

2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:19.800
 got it right there's something here it's kind of this like theory of time around them the value

2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:25.320
 of intellectual ideas right if an intellectual idea has survived the test of time it's much more

2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:29.720
 valuable than the intellectual idea that i just came up with 10 minutes ago haven't told anybody

2:29:29.720 --> 2:29:37.960
 and hasn't gone up against you know the all of the kind of rebuttals so what's your favorite what

2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:44.200
 would you say would be a most impactful biography that you've come across i don't think it was those

2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:53.480
 greek or roman biographies because they were very far away i think that um probably one of the most

2:29:53.480 --> 2:30:01.160
 impactful ones that i can remember recently is around uh vanderbilt and so vanderbilt was these

2:30:01.160 --> 2:30:08.600
 was this guy who basically without that much of an education he would invent or work with people

2:30:08.600 --> 2:30:14.440
 to make these steamboats and then he had a lot of acumen around creating certain monopolies

2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:23.240
 regardless of you know what was um right or wasn't right and then fascinating enough it all

2:30:23.240 --> 2:30:29.720
 hinged on like a supreme court case that decided if monopolies were acceptable um in in the form

2:30:29.720 --> 2:30:36.200
 of state created monopolies or not and if they were you know if it was deemed that state created

2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:40.440
 monopolies were acceptable he would have had a huge problem this guy but it was deemed that

2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:48.920
 state created monopolies through these licenses for steamboat roots was not acceptable and that

2:30:48.920 --> 2:30:55.480
 did two interesting things that unseated um some kind of old time landed gentry in the americas

2:30:55.480 --> 2:31:01.720
 in like the 1830s and 40s and it um you know basically made him right and he saw it before

2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:08.840
 other people so i i think this i think vanderbilt was a very interesting um personality first of all

2:31:08.840 --> 2:31:14.200
 of all the of all the biographies that i read is um is somebody who really took um

2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:21.960
 took the situation in hand and kind of took action to achieve an outcome which i i think

2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:28.440
 was uh was an amazing amazing result that the fascinating thing by the way is a amazing way

2:31:28.440 --> 2:31:33.240
 of looking at things the fascinating thing by the way is that the ferries now in new york harbour

2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:40.280
 are all um run as a public good so the fascinating thing is that the guy he he focused on an industry

2:31:40.280 --> 2:31:46.360
 and he worked on something that was so important that it ended up becoming a public good and i i

2:31:46.360 --> 2:31:52.440
 think that that that's an interesting conception of of how to look at this industry um i think there's

2:31:52.440 --> 2:31:57.000
 um a lot of economics dynamics around this industry but i i think i might have sent this i

2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:02.040
 might have said this somewhere else before but really the success of someone in this industry

2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:12.760
 is whether they're able to make a linux or http or an https like system that lives on for a very

2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:19.960
 long time and is essentially a kind of public good the success of an idea even if that idea is

2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:25.800
 originally sort of a capitalist idea above and that's grounded in financial benefit success of

2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:32.120
 it is if it becomes a public good it is so universal it is it is so fundamental to the

2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:38.040
 quality of life that it's a public good that is deemed to be so valuable that it should be a public

2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:43.800
 good yeah i think so i think that's a pretty uh a pretty good definition of success that you

2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:50.360
 you work on a body of work and that body of work isn't just some commercial enterprise it's um it's

2:32:50.360 --> 2:32:56.680
 a body of work that whatever commercial aspects or economic incentive aspects it might have it

2:32:56.680 --> 2:33:03.400
 eventually is so important that it becomes um critical to how society functions uh i'm personally

2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:09.880
 quite um you know lucky and grateful to be in my opinion working on something like that with

2:33:09.880 --> 2:33:16.200
 an amazing team and an amazing community that seems to really very much care about this hybrid

2:33:16.200 --> 2:33:23.480
 smart contract transparent world that you know a lot of people in our industry realistically i think

2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:28.840
 this is why a lot of them signed up you know this is why i came into our industry it wasn't because

2:33:28.840 --> 2:33:36.040
 bitcoin it was it was because bitcoin was a picture of how the world could work in so many

2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:42.360
 other ways and that picture of how the world could work in so many other ways um attracted me a very

2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:51.480
 long time ago and i think that all of this stuff will eventually become a public good i i think

2:33:51.480 --> 2:33:56.760
 it'll become so critical to how societies function internally and internationally that just like

2:33:56.760 --> 2:34:01.720
 there are systems you know like the federal reserve like global payment systems like all these types

2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:06.600
 of things i think eventually all of the all of this technology will be baked into these

2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:12.760
 society societally critical systems and if i in our community and the people i work with and the

2:34:12.760 --> 2:34:19.880
 body of work that we're working on can make some kind of contribution to that shift um towards

2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:27.080
 uh fair economically fair transparent society uh from my point of view it's a very very worthwhile

2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:32.920
 body of work in in terms of the show you you also mentioned mentioned the show you know one of the

2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:37.960
 you know one of the shows that i really um seemed to like more and more for some reason is uh star

2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:42.680
 track not the old star track i don't really get the old star track the special effects aren't good

2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:49.640
 enough star track like the next generation and voyager and um deep space nine and all those

2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:56.840
 i i think whenever i happen to watch a star trek show again i have a very simple conception in

2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:02.280
 my mind that i really didn't have whenever i saw it way back when it's that this is what the world

2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:08.920
 looks like if technology takes us towards a utopia right so i think there's this fascinating thing

2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:16.280
 where technology can take us towards a utopia or towards a dystopia and in my mind those kind of

2:35:16.280 --> 2:35:24.280
 three star trek shows are a picture of what human civilization looks like if everybody's

2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:29.480
 technological ambitions successfully take us towards a utopia right because in the star

2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:36.520
 trek universe you're not seeking money or you're not seeking safety or you're not seeking you're

2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:42.040
 not really seeking anything for yourself everybody you know within maslow's hierarchy of needs

2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:48.360
 has has gotten so many things for themselves that their that their goal is learning and discovering

2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:54.680
 and or helping and i i think there is this conception of human life once the baser needs

2:35:54.680 --> 2:36:01.960
 are satisfied and at the at the end of the day i think that's what technology generally can elevate

2:36:02.680 --> 2:36:09.880
 all of human civilization to right it can elevate us to star trek world where if people want to

2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:14.520
 invent they can do that all day and nothing else if people want to explore the stars they can explore

2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:19.880
 the stars and and they don't have to worry about economics care city or any number of these other

2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:25.400
 conceptions so i i don't know what the most impactful on me shows have been but for some

2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:32.120
 reason recently star trek in this in the newer variant not the most new new star trek shows

2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:37.160
 those shows are a little strange the the kind of middle star trek universe where where everybody

2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:42.200
 is doing something with like a very important purpose and and nobody's thinking about like

2:36:42.200 --> 2:36:47.640
 where's my paycheck or where's my you know where's my whatever they're all kind of like we have to

2:36:47.640 --> 2:36:53.720
 discover the formula to this to save the planet over there and literally every episode you're

2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:58.520
 discovering a formula to save a planet right of some kind or a universe or ecosystem or whatever

2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:02.760
 and it's and you're looking at you're like you know this this this is this is like this is a pretty

2:37:02.760 --> 2:37:07.320
 good place to end up this is where we might want to end up so it gives you hope and it's funny that

2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:17.000
 we don't we don't often think about the i think it's very useful to think about positive visions

2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:24.280
 of the future when we're trying to design technology there's a lot of sort of in public discourse

2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:30.120
 a lot of people are thinking about kind of how everything goes wrong it's important to

2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:35.800
 think about that sometimes but in moderation i think because you there's not enough the in my

2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:42.840
 little corner of artificial intelligence world people are very kind of fear monger centered

2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:48.600
 there's a lot of discussions about how everything goes wrong important to do but it's also really

2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:56.120
 important to talk about how things can go right because we ultimately want to guide the design

2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:03.800
 of the systems to create to make things right and i think with hope and optimism not naiveness but

2:38:04.680 --> 2:38:10.360
 optimism you can actually create a better world like you have to think about a positive

2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:19.320
 a better world as you create because then you can actually create it um yeah i'm one of the people

2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:26.680
 who thinks that um having an optimistic view of the world is better for design and creativity

2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:34.280
 than having a pessimistic one it's hard to design when you're in fear uh do you have advice

2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:40.680
 for young people speaking of being excited about and hopeful about the future world do you have

2:38:40.680 --> 2:38:47.080
 uh advice for young people today in uh computer science world and software engineering world

2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:55.000
 and crypto world but maybe in any world whatsoever um for life how to pick a career or how to live

2:38:55.000 --> 2:39:02.600
 life in general i think the thing that that that young people should do is is not anyone's

2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:09.080
 specific thing for any anyone's specific young person i think what they should do is what they

2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:16.120
 won't be able to do in the later stages of their life yeah and the way in my opinion from a framework

2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:23.800
 point of view to think about that is that the amount of obligations and the amount of time

2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:31.080
 that a person has seems to just diminish over time right so the amount of free time they have

2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:35.640
 right so you start your job you get a bunch of responsibilities something with your partner

2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:42.040
 spouse more responsibilities kids probably even more responsibilities and soon enough the time

2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:50.040
 that you have to educate yourself to travel to you know experience the world however create

2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:56.680
 whatever creative endeavor you're interested in um slowly but surely disappears i think this is

2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:02.600
 something that you know young people don't fully realize they they assume that the world as it is

2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:10.600
 now and the amount of free time that they have to travel to educate themselves to make new friends

2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:17.800
 to do all these things will somehow maybe diminish by 10 percent it won't diminish by 10 percent

2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:23.880
 it'll diminish by 90 percent yeah and the 10 percent that you have you'll be resting to get

2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:30.440
 to get back to work and get things done so yeah what i think young people should do and this is

2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:34.600
 why it's very different for each of them right i can't tell young people hey you should study

2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:39.640
 philosophy travel and start your own enterprise to achieve something worthwhile in the world right

2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:45.960
 that might be something that's good for me with my values and my kind of worldview but for other

2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:55.000
 people might be something else i i think the way that they should conceptualize it is imagine if over

2:40:55.000 --> 2:41:03.400
 the next um 10 12 years the amount of choice that you had about what you could do was cut down by 90

2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:09.400
 percent what would you and this is you know copying from this kind of just Jeff Bezos regret

2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:16.440
 minimization framework in that framework it's like what would i regret not doing at 80 and that's

2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:22.680
 kind of meant to create this long term view and make these decisions now that'll get you to a

2:41:22.680 --> 2:41:28.120
 long term future that you can look back on and be proud of your life right what i think young

2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:33.000
 people should do is they is they they should say to themselves look if i never get the chance to

2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:42.040
 travel for as long as i live assuming that after 25 after 27 after 29 that's the case how will i

2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:49.000
 feel about that if i never get to start a company after 25 after i get married after i have kids

2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:53.960
 how will i feel about that and whatever they feel the worst about is what they should do

2:41:54.760 --> 2:42:00.440
 whatever they feel like when they say to themselves you know if i don't travel now i will never travel

2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:06.440
 travel and they feel horrible about that they just have an overwhelming fear and disgust at

2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:14.440
 themselves in that type of state at 25 27 29 that's what they should do and they shouldn't

2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:22.440
 listen to anybody else um i i i let me put it to you this way if you're really smart you're

2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:26.440
 going to make it anyway there's a lot of people putting a lot of pressure on you because they're

2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:31.240
 afraid whether you're going to make it if you're really smart you're going to make it anyway if

2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:38.520
 you're not really smart you're screwed anyway so either way just relax with it and use your time

2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:45.080
 well to do the the things you would most regret not doing that's really fascinating i wouldn't

2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:51.640
 i wouldn't say relax i would say very much cherish the free time yeah the discretionary time that

2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:59.000
 you have from the age of 18 to maybe 25 yeah because at 25 everyone's going to start looking

2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:04.360
 at each other and asking what have what have i like my friends have achieved i haven't achieved

2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:09.080
 and then by the time you get to 30 you're going to look at each other again and go well my friends

2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:15.960
 have a family or a company or a phd or or whatever what do i have and the pressure will just increase

2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:22.680
 and it'll increase so much that even if you want to go and do the fun thing it will not be fun

2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:29.320
 because the pressure yeah of comparing yourself to your friends at 25 or your peers at 30 will

2:43:29.320 --> 2:43:36.040
 be so great that you will no longer it will no longer be normal for you to be in a hostel at 30

2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:42.360
 you know kind of like living it up right if if and and and this is why i also can't tell you

2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:47.000
 specifically what it is for me it was getting an education in philosophy that was rigorous and in

2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:51.800
 depth it was traveling and it was starting an enterprise that i thought that was worthwhile

2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:56.440
 that i directed that i could make into something great that's what it was for me for other people

2:43:56.440 --> 2:44:01.480
 it might be something with a band it might be something with painting it might be an education

2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.480
 you by the way should also should not assume that your ability to get an education will

2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:14.760
 will improve all of those responsibilities will take away your ability to get an education

2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:21.960
 so if you value having an education if you value being a deeply educated well rounded person

2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:28.840
 with a wide array of knowledge on a wide array of topics capitalism will force you to specialize

2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:33.320
 that's what it's good at it's going to take you it's going to fashion you into a very specific

2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:39.640
 tool for a very most people into a very specific set of tasks if you want to have an education

2:44:39.640 --> 2:44:44.920
 in something get it now if you want to travel somewhere travel there now if you want to you

2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:49.560
 know do some kind of creative endeavor that you doubt whether you'll have time for in the future

2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:55.160
 do it now you won't have time for it in the future you won't have time to read philosophy books all

2:44:55.160 --> 2:45:01.800
 day unfortunately you won't have time to fly to you know italy and kind of hang out with people

2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:06.440
 if you're serious about your life you're going to get more responsibilities you're going to get

2:45:06.440 --> 2:45:15.000
 more stuff to do and so my advice to you is do not piss away this rare unique discretionary time

2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:22.120
 and if your friends are get new friends get smarter friends get people who are using the

2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:28.600
 limited time they have better yeah um that's my advice so it's just a quickly comment it's brilliant

2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:36.040
 you know to reframe high school and undergraduate college education sometimes people want to quickly

2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:45.720
 get it over with but one thing I remember thinking and it's very true about high school is one of

2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:51.800
 the only times in in your life you'll get a chance to truly get a broad education you don't often

2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:58.040
 think of it that way but it's a chance to really enjoy learning things that are outside of the

2:45:58.040 --> 2:46:03.240
 specialty that you'll eventually end up with and that's how college education is and a more fun

2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:11.480
 side I played music I I did martial arts and we offline mentioned played video games I find it

2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:17.960
 fascinating and brilliant what you said which is the world will will not give you a chance to truly

2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:24.600
 enjoy many of these things and truly get value from many of those things uh once you get older

2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:30.120
 I find it exceptionally difficult to enjoy video games now there's so much stuff to do

2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:38.840
 there's so much responsibility and I at the time when I played elder scrolls and Baldur's Gate and

2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:48.920
 Diablo 2 and at the time I thought maybe that was a waste of time but now looking back I realize

2:46:48.920 --> 2:46:53.400
 because I always thought you know let me get the career first and then I'll have a chance to play

2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:58.840
 video games that's the way I was thinking you know it was a waste of time because I should really

2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:05.080
 progress on the career and then I'll have time to play video games no the reality is that was

2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:12.280
 really fulfilling those are some of the happiest travel experiences of my life is me traveling to

2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:17.240
 those virtual worlds and spending time in them and it was really fulfilling and they stayed

2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:22.760
 with me for the rest of my life and I get to experience echoes of that when I play video games

2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:28.600
 these days for an hour here an hour there like one hour a month or something like that but even

2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:34.680
 those experiences as silly as they are they seem like a waste of time at the time enjoying them fully

2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:42.920
 unapologetically and you know in a framework exactly as you said would I regret being the

2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:49.240
 kind of person who've never played those video games and I can for myself honestly say that yes

2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:58.520
 look when I'm on my deathbed I'm glad at Bouldersgate I build Bouldersgate too and and all those

2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:09.000
 arena dagger fall moral wind and all the Elder Scroll games and yeah the things that don't necessarily

2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:15.800
 fit into this kind of storyline of what a career is supposed to be a travel and all those experiences

2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:22.520
 they might I think I just like to say one one one final quick thing on this I think this extends

2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:26.760
 to really hard things as well it extends to the things you want to do but one of the best pieces

2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:33.800
 advice one of my mentors gave me early on in in my career around this time is that it will actually

2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:40.360
 become harder to start a company as you get older yes once again because you have more

2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:45.080
 responsibilities you're responsible to your partner for some kind of income to create a life

2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:50.200
 together once you have kids you're responsible for an even greater income to create a life for kids

2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:55.880
 and startups do not generate income right they take many many years before anything happens

2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:01.000
 people are getting evicted people are eating ramen noodles that is a thing that happens that that

2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:07.560
 that will happen so I'm not saying that you should do the fun things or the enjoyable things I'm

2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:16.040
 saying the things that you would regret not doing that you can uniquely do in the time span from 18

2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:24.760
 to 25 which one of which is if you plan to have a family and start a family when you're 25 you

2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:30.120
 should start a company now you should not wait until a bunch of people depend on you for income to

2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:36.360
 eat to start a company the amount of pressure that will be on you at that point will be monumental

2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:41.800
 you should start a company when nobody depends on you and you can sleep on the floor eating ramen

2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:49.480
 noodles and still have a great time and show up with a lot of enthusiasm and be excited so I just

2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:56.600
 mean whatever you want to really devote yourself to and and really do don't put it off don't go to

2:49:56.600 --> 2:50:00.680
 consulting or banking or any other industry and say I'm going to do this for three years and I'll

2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:06.120
 get experience the only way you get experience is by doing something you go you do it you fail

2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:09.880
 you do it again and again and again and again and again and then you have experience and then you

2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:14.600
 can do it right that's the only way experience happens there is no other way short of mentorship

2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:19.800
 if you're lucky to get mentorship 99% of people don't get mentorship and even though we're talking

2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:24.680
 about young people I feel like you're speaking to me as somebody who's who spent the last two weeks

2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:28.920
 sleeping on the floor because there's no mattress and somebody who is single and somebody who's

2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:34.520
 thinking about doing a startup I felt like you're speaking to me as a as a fellow young person

2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:43.000
 and let me ask you about this whole life of ours to zoom out on the big philosophical question

2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:48.920
 the ridiculous question what do you think is the meaning of it all do you think about this kind of

2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:55.000
 stuff as you're creating all the technology as you're thinking about this future you ever zoom

2:50:55.000 --> 2:51:02.520
 out and think like why why why are you surrogate striving why are we the human species striving

2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:09.960
 for the stars so I think it comes down to you know whether people want to live in society

2:51:11.160 --> 2:51:16.280
 so if if people decide to be part of society they have a certain

2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:24.840
 set of conditions that they decide to take part in right so I think what this what this

2:51:24.840 --> 2:51:31.320
 comes down to is a lot of really involved conversations but if we assume people have

2:51:31.320 --> 2:51:37.160
 free will and choice we just kind of make that blanket assumption then the question starts to

2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:43.240
 become well what choices do we make and how do we live with those choices and I think probably the

2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:49.960
 most fundamental choice is whether we exist in a society or we choose to leave society and there

2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:53.080
 are people that do this there are people that go live in the woods there are people that immigrate

2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:59.000
 to other societies and they make a choice right and as they enter those other societies or they

2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:05.640
 choose to leave society leave society and go live in the woods they adopt a certain set of values

2:52:05.640 --> 2:52:09.720
 right they adopt values that the society prescribes they compromise their own values they

2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:17.160
 define their own values and they create a set of values for themselves right I think at the end

2:52:17.160 --> 2:52:24.520
 of the day if you're going to choose to live in society in addition to all the minimums of you

2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:29.240
 know not throwing garbage on the floor and you know doing doing nice things for people that need

2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:35.080
 help and and doing any number of things to just be a normal human being within society you you

2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:41.960
 have to ask yourself what am I doing as part of society right you can always say hey I'm going to

2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:45.960
 leave society I'm going to live in the woods I did that right I went and I lived in the woods

2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:50.840
 and I gave it a shot realized a ton of stuff huge amount of clarity from that but when you

2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:58.200
 decide to live in society you you take on first of all certain minimal agreements you you you

2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:03.240
 mold your values a little bit to that society that's another choice that people inherently make

2:53:03.880 --> 2:53:10.680
 and then there's a question of well what am I doing here right what am I doing in society

2:53:10.680 --> 2:53:14.680
 right so when people say the meaning of life I don't know what the meaning of life is the meaning

2:53:14.680 --> 2:53:19.640
 of life in society right what what's the meaning of life for the choice that you've made within

2:53:19.640 --> 2:53:23.960
 society right because that's maybe the first fundamental choice you made you made a choice

2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:31.080
 and you continue to make a choice to be part of society and a specific society right so you've

2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:40.120
 made this choice you're part of a society and now you kind of have a life and you have people around

2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:47.160
 you and then the question is in my in my opinion the question is what is the body of work that you

2:53:47.160 --> 2:53:56.280
 want to make right I think personally that life is kind of so short and the ability to get enough

2:53:56.280 --> 2:54:01.800
 resources for yourself in at least the developed markets where we're like lucky to be in is so

2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:09.960
 relatively abundant that we you and me have the luxury you know by your pursuit of a phd you know

2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:15.960
 you've had this luxury I've had this luxury um through the work that I've been doing to pursue

2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:25.640
 something that makes society better so this is kind of the um question I would say the question is

2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:31.240
 am I going to live in society yes or no yes okay most people choose yes I I understand why to a

2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:35.960
 degree I understand why some people choose no and then um what is the and I'm going to be in

2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:39.320
 society I'm going to go if you choose to be in society you're you're just choosing to abide by

2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:44.280
 the rules you're choosing to just do the minimum right that's what being part of society means

2:54:44.280 --> 2:54:47.880
 people that choose to be part of society but don't want to do this it's it's very confusing

2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:51.880
 they should just leave they should just go look I don't like this deal I'm going to go somewhere

2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:55.960
 else I'm going to live in Tibet I'm going to live in the woods I'm going to live wherever

2:54:55.960 --> 2:55:03.160
 where the rules are to my liking right um you you've chosen to be in society next question

2:55:03.160 --> 2:55:07.880
 kind of final question is what is the body of work that I'm going to be involved in because in

2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:12.680
 looking at that Jeff Bezos kind of regret minimization framework thing I think that's what

2:55:12.680 --> 2:55:17.240
 a lot of it really comes down to is you kind of the framework is at 80 years old you look back

2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:23.320
 over your life what would you regret not doing what would you regret not not pursuing I think

2:55:23.320 --> 2:55:28.840
 there there are a number of things on a personal level each person has but I think at least for

2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:34.600
 me and and probably for many of the other people I know there's a question of what is the body of

2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:40.840
 work that I was involved in what did I do what what happened right what was I involved in

2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:49.560
 and in my opinion you you should have a good answer to that and you mentioned the body work in

2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:57.400
 relation to whether it helped make a better world and the fundamental question there is

2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:04.760
 what does better mean so it's our striving to understand what is better what kind of world

2:56:04.760 --> 2:56:12.360
 would we love to exist after we're gone and I think that's another thing almost unanswerable

2:56:12.360 --> 2:56:20.040
 question but it's one we can strive towards is what is what is a better world right I think

2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:23.880
 that's all that's that's once again a very that's a very personal question I'm not sure if there's

2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:28.840
 an objective moral truth that's going to suddenly give us all an answer I think it's actually quite

2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:32.920
 fascinating to me when people feel they have this objective moral truth they're so sure in their

2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:38.760
 opinions you know this is what we do we should go you know hurt them or help them or kill them or

2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:43.640
 or or rescue them or whatever right there's this there's all these kind of very situational specific

2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:48.840
 kind of like this is the right thing to do the objective moral truth told me that this is it

2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:56.040
 but maybe there's a definitive truth that we can arrive towards a sort of a consensus of what

2:56:56.040 --> 2:57:02.280
 that is within the little local pocket of society that you're in yeah that's the point that's what

2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:06.600
 that's what happens people just then mislabel it and they go like objective moral truth yeah this

2:57:06.600 --> 2:57:11.480
 is this is not my this is not our idea you know this is coming up from on high here this is this

2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:17.320
 is the this is the the objective moral truth that you know I I think exists in some metaphysical

2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:22.680
 form somewhere and then you build a building with marble and as big and usually what happens

2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:26.280
 and then you convince yourself that that building represents I think those people actually under

2:57:26.280 --> 2:57:30.120
 the people build those buildings under probably understand that there is no metaphysical object

2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:33.560
 they're just like we're all just coming to consensus I'm gonna build the biggest building

2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:36.840
 and you're like me and that's what we're gonna do right like they just they just look at it

2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:43.320
 that way probably I I think I think what ends up happening with with all these values is yeah

2:57:43.320 --> 2:57:47.160
 people should determine that for themselves I I agree that there's a second order question here

2:57:47.160 --> 2:57:54.120
 of what is the best the the best body of work to work on personally I think that's probably a mix of

2:57:54.120 --> 2:57:59.240
 what could you realistically achieve you know is that gonna have an impact on society that you

2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:05.000
 feel good about yeah right so these these are probably the two aspects of this question and

2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:09.400
 is this gonna have a good impact on society that you feel good about obviously very subjective

2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:15.800
 right some people save animals some people save forests we and and I are creating this

2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:21.800
 system of economic fairness and transparency I feel that I'm in a good position to enable that

2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:27.560
 I feel that I have a good chance of succeeding at that and I think that the impact will be

2:58:27.560 --> 2:58:34.040
 quite quite meaningful for a large number of people and so I'm completely happy to look back

2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:38.680
 once I'm 80 and see a body of work that achieve that and be very proud of that right because

2:58:38.680 --> 2:58:44.120
 I think that's what I'll be doing when I'm looking back so well I agree with you the the scale of

2:58:44.120 --> 2:58:51.960
 impact as a but smart hybrid smart contracts this whole idea that you're working on has a potential

2:58:51.960 --> 2:59:02.760
 to transform the world for the better at a scale that that I can't even imagine so speaking of which

2:59:02.760 --> 2:59:08.040
 means even more that you would waste so many hours of that exciting life with me thank you so much
