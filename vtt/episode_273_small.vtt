00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 What are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.320
 How do you analyze it within your framework about war?

00:06.320 --> 00:08.680
 How far would they go to hang onto power

00:09.680 --> 00:11.240
 when push came to shove?

00:12.160 --> 00:15.200
 Is I think the thing that worries me the most

00:15.200 --> 00:17.480
 and is plainly what worries most people

00:17.480 --> 00:19.120
 about the risk of nuclear war?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.720
 Like at what point does that unchecked leadership

00:22.640 --> 00:24.880
 decide that this is worth it?

00:24.880 --> 00:29.880
 Especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.360
 The following is a conversation with Chris Blatman,

00:34.360 --> 00:36.360
 professor at the University of Chicago

00:36.360 --> 00:41.080
 studying the causes and consequences of violence and war.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.640
 This he explores in his new book called Why We Fight,

00:45.640 --> 00:48.880
 The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.200
 The book comes out on April 19th,

00:51.200 --> 00:54.840
 so you should preorder it to support Chris and his work.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.840
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.840
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:58.840 --> 00:59.920
 in the description.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.800
 And now, dear friends, here's Chris Blatman.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.440
 In your new book titled Why We Fight,

01:07.440 --> 01:10.280
 The Roots of War and the Paths for Peace,

01:10.280 --> 01:13.400
 you write, quote, let me be clear

01:13.400 --> 01:15.800
 what I mean when I say war.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.480
 I don't just mean countries duking it out.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.000
 I mean any kind of prolonged violence

01:21.000 --> 01:22.600
 struggle between groups.

01:22.600 --> 01:26.000
 That includes villages, clans, gangs, ethnic groups,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.640
 religious sects, political factions, and nations.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.880
 Wildly different as these may be,

01:31.880 --> 01:34.800
 their origins have much in common.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.600
 We'll see that the Northern Irish zealots,

01:37.600 --> 01:40.400
 Colombian cartels, European tyrants,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.240
 Liberian rebels, Greek oligarchs,

01:43.240 --> 01:46.880
 Chicago gangs, Indian mobs, Rwandan jenna,

01:46.880 --> 01:50.360
 Sydares, and you word I learned, thank you to you.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.360
 Those are people who administer genocide.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.960
 English soccer hooligans and American invaders.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.840
 So first, let me ask, what is war?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.560
 In saying that war is a prolonged violence struggle

02:07.560 --> 02:10.440
 between groups, what do the words prolonged

02:10.440 --> 02:12.600
 groups and violent mean?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.520
 I sit at the sort of intersection of economics

02:14.520 --> 02:15.480
 and political science.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.600
 And I also dwell a little bit in psychology,

02:18.600 --> 02:21.480
 but that's partly because I'm married to a psychologist,

02:21.480 --> 02:23.680
 sometimes do research with her.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.720
 All these things are really different.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.680
 So if you're a political scientist,

02:25.680 --> 02:27.400
 you spend a lot of time just classifying

02:27.400 --> 02:30.600
 a really narrow kind of conflict and studying that.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.160
 And that's an important way to make progress

02:33.160 --> 02:35.480
 as a social scientist, but I'm not trying to make progress.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.360
 I'm trying to sort of help everybody step back and say,

02:38.360 --> 02:39.880
 you know what, there's like some common things

02:39.880 --> 02:42.680
 that we know from these disciplines

02:42.680 --> 02:46.320
 that relate to a really wide range of phenomenon.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.720
 Basically, we can talk about them in a very similar way

02:48.720 --> 02:49.920
 and we can get really similar insights.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.360
 So I wanted to actually bring them together,

02:54.360 --> 02:56.880
 but I still had to like say,

02:56.880 --> 02:58.640
 let's hold out individual violence,

02:58.640 --> 03:00.040
 which has a lot in common,

03:00.040 --> 03:04.400
 but individuals choose to engage in violence

03:04.400 --> 03:06.760
 for more and sometimes different reasons.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.600
 So let's just put that aside so that we can focus a bit.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.840
 And let's really put aside short incidents of violence

03:13.840 --> 03:16.520
 because those might have the same kind

03:16.520 --> 03:18.040
 of things explaining them,

03:18.040 --> 03:19.520
 but actually there's a lot of other things

03:19.520 --> 03:20.760
 that can explain short violence.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.040
 Short violence can be really demonstrative.

03:25.040 --> 03:25.880
 Like you can just,

03:25.880 --> 03:28.000
 I can use it to communicate information.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.640
 The thing that all of it has in common

03:29.640 --> 03:31.400
 is that it doesn't generally make sense.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.080
 It's not your best option most of the time.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.640
 And so I wanted to say,

03:35.640 --> 03:37.960
 let's take this thing that should be puzzling.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.560
 We kind of think it's normal.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.280
 We kind of think this is what all humans do,

03:42.280 --> 03:44.200
 but let's point out that it's not normal

03:45.680 --> 03:47.400
 and then figure out why and let's talk about why.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.400
 And so that's, so I was trying to throw out the short violence.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.160
 I was trying to throw out the individual violence.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.560
 I was also trying to throw out all the competition

03:56.560 --> 03:57.760
 that happens that's not violent.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.480
 That's the normal competition.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.440
 I was trying to say, let's talk about violent competition

04:01.440 --> 04:03.920
 because that's kind of the puzzle.

04:03.920 --> 04:04.960
 So that's really interesting.

04:04.960 --> 04:09.480
 So you said usually people try to find a narrow definition

04:09.480 --> 04:10.880
 and you said progress.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.760
 So you make progress by finding a narrow definition,

04:13.760 --> 04:18.560
 for example, of military conflict in a particular context.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.760
 And progress means, all right,

04:20.760 --> 04:23.000
 well, how do we prevent this particular kind

04:23.000 --> 04:24.440
 of military conflict?

04:24.440 --> 04:26.240
 Or maybe if it's already happening,

04:26.240 --> 04:29.920
 how do we deescalate it and how do we solve it?

04:29.920 --> 04:31.720
 So from a geopolitics perspective,

04:31.720 --> 04:33.600
 from an economics perspective,

04:33.600 --> 04:36.320
 and you're looking for a definition of war

04:36.320 --> 04:38.760
 that is as broad as possible,

04:38.760 --> 04:42.480
 but not so broad that you cannot achieve a deep level

04:42.480 --> 04:45.200
 of understanding of why it happens

04:45.200 --> 04:46.760
 and how it can be avoided.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.480
 Right, and a comment, basically like recognize

04:49.480 --> 04:52.920
 that common principles govern some kinds of behavior

04:52.920 --> 04:54.520
 that look pretty different.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.320
 Like an Indian ethnic riot is obviously pretty different

04:59.320 --> 05:01.600
 than invading a neighboring country, right?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.560
 But, and that's pretty different than two villages

05:04.560 --> 05:05.400
 or two gangs.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.680
 A lot of what I work on is studying organized criminals

05:07.680 --> 05:08.520
 and gangs.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.600
 You know, where you think is really different.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.400
 And of course it is, but there are some common principles.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.400
 You can just think about conflict and the use of violence

05:16.400 --> 05:19.720
 and not learn everything, but just get a lot.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.720
 Just get really, really far by sort of seeing

05:21.720 --> 05:23.440
 the commonalities rather than just focusing

05:23.440 --> 05:24.360
 on the differences.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.680
 So again, those words are prolonged groups and violent.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.000
 Can you maybe linger in each of those words?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.600
 What does prolonged mean?

05:32.600 --> 05:36.240
 Where's the line between short and long?

05:36.240 --> 05:39.080
 What does groups mean and what does violent mean?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.680
 So let me, you know, I have a friend who,

05:42.600 --> 05:44.320
 someone who's become a friend through the process

05:44.320 --> 05:47.200
 of my work and writing this book also,

05:47.200 --> 05:52.200
 who was 20, 30 years ago was a, was gang leader in Chicago.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.560
 So this guy named Napoleon English or Knapp.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.320
 And I remember one time he was saying,

05:57.320 --> 05:59.440
 well, you know, when I was young, I used to,

05:59.440 --> 06:03.120
 I was just 15, 16 and he'd go to the neighboring

06:03.120 --> 06:03.960
 gang's territory.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.120
 He says, I'd go gang banging.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.520
 And I said, well, I didn't know what that meant.

06:06.520 --> 06:07.480
 I said, what does that mean?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.760
 And he said, oh, that's just meant I'd shoot him up.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.360
 Like I'd shoot at buildings, I might shoot at people.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.320
 I wasn't trying to kill the, he wasn't trying to kill them.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.000
 He was just trying to sort of send a signal

06:18.000 --> 06:20.760
 that he was a tough guy and he was fearless

06:20.760 --> 06:24.720
 and he was someone who they should be careful with.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.280
 And so I didn't want to call that war, right?

06:27.280 --> 06:30.760
 That was, that was, that's something different.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.160
 That was, it was short, it was kind of sporadic

06:33.160 --> 06:36.040
 and he wasn't, and he was, he was basically

06:36.040 --> 06:37.520
 trying to send them information.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.160
 And this is what countries do all the time, right?

06:40.160 --> 06:44.400
 We have military parades and we,

06:44.400 --> 06:48.240
 we might have border skirmishes and,

06:48.240 --> 06:49.880
 and I wanted to sort of, so is it,

06:49.880 --> 06:53.200
 what's short is a three month border skirmish, a war?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.760
 I mean, I don't, I don't try to get into those things.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.240
 I don't want to, but I want to point out that like,

06:59.240 --> 07:01.960
 these long grueling months and years of violence

07:01.960 --> 07:04.760
 are like, are the problem in the puzzle.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.720
 And I just, I didn't want to spend a lot of time talking

07:07.720 --> 07:12.240
 about the international version of gang banging.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.440
 It's a different phenomenon.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.480
 So what is it about Napoleon that doesn't nap,

07:16.480 --> 07:19.200
 let's call him, not to add confusion,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.800
 that doesn't qualify for war?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.840
 Is it the individual aspect?

07:23.840 --> 07:28.520
 Is it that violence is not the thing that is sought,

07:28.520 --> 07:33.520
 but the communication of information is what is sought?

07:34.960 --> 07:36.680
 Or is it the shortness of it?

07:37.560 --> 07:39.240
 Is it all of those?

07:39.240 --> 07:41.680
 It's a little bit, I mean, he was the head of a group

07:41.680 --> 07:44.280
 where he's becoming the head of a group at that point.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.360
 And that group eventually did go to war

07:47.360 --> 07:48.400
 with those neighboring gangs,

07:48.400 --> 07:51.920
 which is to say it was just long drawn out conflict

07:51.920 --> 07:53.800
 over months and months and months.

07:53.800 --> 07:58.360
 But I think one of the big insights from my fields

07:58.360 --> 08:02.840
 is that you're constantly negotiating over something, right?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.320
 Whether you're officially negotiating

08:04.320 --> 08:07.720
 or you're all posturing, like you're bargaining over something

08:07.720 --> 08:12.720
 and you should be able to figure out a way to split that pie

08:12.720 --> 08:14.480
 and you could use violence,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.080
 but violence is everybody's miserable.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.160
 Like if you're napped, like if you start a war,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.960
 one, there's lots of risks, you can get killed,

08:20.960 --> 08:22.520
 that's not good.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.000
 You could kill somebody else and go to jail,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.520
 which is what happened to him, that's not good.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.520
 Your soldiers get killed,

08:27.520 --> 08:30.120
 no one's buying your drugs in the middle of the confight,

08:30.120 --> 08:31.120
 so it interrupts your business.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.880
 And so on and on, it's like, it's really miserable.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.800
 This is what we're seeing right now,

08:34.800 --> 08:37.760
 as we're recording, the Russian invasion of Ukraine

08:37.760 --> 08:40.000
 is now at fourth or fifth week.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.880
 Everybody's, if it didn't dawn on them before,

08:42.880 --> 08:47.120
 it's dawned on them now just how brutal and costly this is.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.360
 As you described for everybody,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.640
 so everybody is losing in this war.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.160
 Yeah, I mean, that's maybe the insight.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.040
 Everybody loses something from war

08:56.040 --> 08:58.880
 and there was usually, not always,

08:58.880 --> 09:01.200
 but the point is there was usually a way

09:01.200 --> 09:04.120
 to get what you wanted or be better off

09:04.120 --> 09:05.800
 without having to fight over it.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.040
 So there's this, it's just,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.920
 fighting is just politics by other means

09:09.920 --> 09:14.440
 and it's just inefficient, costly, brutal, devastating means.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.920
 And so that's like the deep insight.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.800
 And so I kind of wanted to say,

09:18.520 --> 09:20.680
 so I guess like what's not war?

09:20.680 --> 09:23.760
 And I mean, I don't try to belabor the definitions

09:23.760 --> 09:26.800
 because some, you know, there's reams and reams

09:26.800 --> 09:29.000
 of political science papers written on like,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.560
 what's a war, what's not a war, people disagree.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.400
 The, I just wanted to say,

09:36.400 --> 09:38.040
 where's the thing that we shouldn't be doing?

09:38.040 --> 09:40.960
 Or where's the violence that doesn't make sense?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.400
 There's a whole bunch of other violence,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.880
 including gang banging and skirmishes

09:44.880 --> 09:46.960
 and things that might make sense,

09:46.960 --> 09:49.640
 precisely because they're cheap ways of communicating

09:49.640 --> 09:53.720
 or they're not particularly costly.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.200
 Where's the thing that's just so costly

09:55.200 --> 09:56.080
 we should be trying to avoid?

09:56.080 --> 09:58.120
 It's maybe like the meta way I think about it.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.200
 All right.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.680
 Nevertheless, definitions are interesting.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.400
 So outside of the academic bickering,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.360
 every time you try to define something,

10:08.360 --> 10:13.520
 I'm a big fan of it, the process illuminates.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.080
 So the destination doesn't matter

10:15.080 --> 10:17.320
 because the moment you arrive at the definition,

10:17.320 --> 10:19.560
 you lose the power.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.760
 Yeah, one of the interesting things,

10:21.760 --> 10:24.240
 I mean, so people, if you wanna do,

10:24.240 --> 10:26.240
 some of what I do is just quantitative analysis

10:26.240 --> 10:29.040
 of conflict and if you wanna do that,

10:29.040 --> 10:31.200
 if you wanna sort of run statistics on war,

10:31.200 --> 10:32.600
 then you have to code it all up.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.280
 And then lots of people have done that.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.400
 There's four or five major data sets

10:36.400 --> 10:39.480
 where people or teams of people have over time said,

10:39.480 --> 10:42.440
 we're gonna code years of war between these groups

10:42.440 --> 10:43.920
 or within a country.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.280
 And what's interesting is how difficult

10:46.280 --> 10:48.080
 these data sets don't often agree.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.600
 You have to make all of these,

10:49.600 --> 10:51.840
 the decision gets really complicated.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.680
 Like when does the war begin, right?

10:53.680 --> 10:57.080
 Does it begin when a certain number of people

10:57.080 --> 10:58.040
 have been killed?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.760
 Did it begin?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.960
 Did it, what if there's like lots of skirmishing

11:01.960 --> 11:03.800
 and sort of little terror attacks

11:03.800 --> 11:05.840
 or a couple bombs lobbed

11:05.840 --> 11:08.120
 and then eventually turns into war?

11:08.120 --> 11:10.800
 Do we call that, do we backdate it

11:10.800 --> 11:13.480
 to like when the first act of violence started?

11:13.480 --> 11:15.320
 And then what do we do with all the times

11:15.320 --> 11:17.360
 when there was like that low scale,

11:17.360 --> 11:19.880
 low intensity violence or bombs lobbed?

11:19.880 --> 11:23.240
 And do we call those wars or maybe only

11:23.240 --> 11:24.280
 if they eventually get worse?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.880
 Like so it actually is really tricky.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.680
 And the defensive and the offensive aspect.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.840
 So everybody, Hitler in World War II,

11:32.840 --> 11:34.960
 it seems like he never attacked anybody.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.600
 He's always defending against the unjust attack

11:38.600 --> 11:41.240
 of everybody else as he's taken over the world.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.520
 So that's like information propaganda that every side

11:45.520 --> 11:48.040
 is trying to communicate to the world.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.640
 So you can't listen to necessarily information

11:50.640 --> 11:52.240
 like self report data.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.040
 You have to kind of look past that somehow.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.160
 Maybe look, especially in the modern world

11:57.160 --> 11:58.880
 as much as possible at the data.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.320
 How many bombs dropped?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.240
 How many people killed?

12:03.240 --> 12:06.200
 How the number of, the estimates of the number of troops

12:06.200 --> 12:09.080
 moved from one location to another and that kind of thing.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.840
 And the other interesting thing is there's

12:11.840 --> 12:13.920
 quantitative analysis of war.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.240
 So for example, I was looking at just war index

12:17.240 --> 12:21.760
 or people trying to measure, trying to put a number

12:21.760 --> 12:24.880
 on what wars are seen as just and not.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.360
 Oh really, I've never seen that.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.680
 It's, there's numbers behind it.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.520
 It's great.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.800
 So it's great because again,

12:32.800 --> 12:37.800
 as you do an extensive quantification of justice,

12:37.800 --> 12:42.800
 you start to think what actually contributes to our thought

12:43.880 --> 12:46.600
 that for example, World War II is a just war

12:46.600 --> 12:48.000
 and other wars are not.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.760
 A lot of it is about intent.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.240
 And some of the other factors like that you look at

12:54.240 --> 12:56.840
 which is prolonged, the degree of violence

12:56.840 --> 13:00.200
 that is necessary versus not necessary

13:00.200 --> 13:03.720
 given the greater good, some measure of the greater good

13:03.720 --> 13:05.600
 of people, all those kinds of things.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.600
 And then there's reasons for war, looking to free people

13:10.720 --> 13:15.720
 or to stop a genocide versus conquering land,

13:16.360 --> 13:17.240
 all those kinds of things.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.320
 And people try to put a number behind it.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.160
 And a lot of...

13:20.160 --> 13:23.040
 And it's based on, I mean, what I'm trying to imagine is,

13:23.040 --> 13:26.160
 I mean, suppose I wake up and, or whatever my,

13:26.160 --> 13:28.360
 suppose I think my God tells me to do something

13:29.400 --> 13:33.960
 or my God thinks that, or my moral sense thinks

13:33.960 --> 13:36.760
 that something that another group is doing is repugnant.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.480
 I'm curious, are they evaluating like the validity

13:41.480 --> 13:43.160
 of that claim or just the idea that like,

13:43.160 --> 13:44.360
 while you said it was repugnant,

13:44.360 --> 13:46.760
 you deeply believe that, therefore it's just.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.080
 I think not to be corrected on a lot of this,

13:50.080 --> 13:52.560
 but I think this is always looking at wars

13:52.560 --> 13:54.200
 after they happened.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.920
 So it's, and trying to take a global perspective

13:56.920 --> 14:00.720
 from all sort of a general survey of how people perceive.

14:00.720 --> 14:04.240
 So you're not weighing disproportionately the opinions

14:04.240 --> 14:05.720
 of the people who waged the war.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.560
 Yeah.

14:06.560 --> 14:11.160
 I mean, I kind of ended up dodging that because,

14:11.160 --> 14:14.840
 I mean, one is to just point out that wars,

14:14.840 --> 14:16.880
 actually most wars aren't necessary.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.600
 And so in the sense that there's another way

14:19.600 --> 14:21.440
 to get what you wanted.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.600
 And so on one level, there's no just war.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.760
 Now that's not true because take an example

14:28.760 --> 14:31.000
 like the US invasion of Afghanistan.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.800
 The United States has been attacked.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.280
 There's a couple bull agent, reliable evidence

14:37.280 --> 14:39.200
 that this is al Qaeda.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.320
 They're being sheltered in Afghanistan by the Taliban.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.600
 And then the Taliban, this is a bit murky.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.160
 It seems that there was an attempt to say hand him over

14:50.160 --> 14:53.200
 or else and they said, no way.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.880
 Now you can make an argument that invading

14:56.880 --> 14:59.440
 and attacking is strategically the right thing to do

14:59.440 --> 15:02.720
 in terms of sending signals to your future enemies.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.440
 Or you just, if you think it's important

15:04.440 --> 15:07.000
 to bring someone to justice, in this case al Qaeda,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.080
 then maybe that's just war or that's a just invasion.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.760
 But it hinges on the fact that the other side

15:14.760 --> 15:17.680
 just didn't do the seemingly sensible thing,

15:17.680 --> 15:20.960
 which is say, okay, we'll give them up.

15:20.960 --> 15:25.960
 And so it was completely avoidable in one sense.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.040
 But if you believe, and I think it's probably true,

15:28.040 --> 15:31.440
 if you believe that for their own ideological

15:31.440 --> 15:34.640
 and other reasons, you know,

15:34.640 --> 15:37.560
 Mullah Omar in particular and Taliban in general

15:37.560 --> 15:39.560
 decided we're not going to do this,

15:40.880 --> 15:44.520
 then now you're not left with very many good choices.

15:45.560 --> 15:49.440
 And now I didn't want to talk about is that a just war

15:49.440 --> 15:51.080
 or is that what's justice or not?

15:51.080 --> 15:55.120
 I just wanted to point out that like one side's

15:55.120 --> 15:57.160
 intransigence, if that's indeed what happened,

15:57.160 --> 16:00.640
 one side's intransigence sort of maybe compels you

16:00.640 --> 16:04.080
 to basically eliminates all of the reasonable bargains

16:04.080 --> 16:05.440
 that you could be satisfied with.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.520
 And now you're left with really no other strategic option

16:07.520 --> 16:08.600
 but to invade.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.320
 I think that's a slight oversimplification,

16:10.320 --> 16:14.520
 but I think that's like one way to describe what happened.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.680
 So your book is fascinating,

16:15.680 --> 16:18.360
 and your perspective on this is fascinating.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.000
 I'll try to sort of play devil's advocate at times

16:21.000 --> 16:22.880
 to try to get a clarity.

16:22.880 --> 16:27.760
 But the thesis is that war is costly,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.280
 usually costly for everybody.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.880
 So that's what you mean when you say nobody wants war

16:33.880 --> 16:35.480
 because you're going to,

16:35.480 --> 16:40.480
 from a game theoretical perspective, nobody wins.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.760
 And so war is essentially a breakdown of reason,

16:47.040 --> 16:50.760
 a breakdown of negotiation, of healthy communication

16:50.760 --> 16:53.080
 or healthy operation of the world.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.640
 Some kind of breakdown,

16:54.640 --> 16:58.720
 you list all kinds of ways in which it breaks down.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.520
 But there's also human beings in this mix.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.160
 And there is ideas of justice.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.480
 So for example, I don't want to,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.240
 my memory doesn't serve me well

17:11.240 --> 17:13.200
 on which wars were seen as justice

17:13.200 --> 17:15.600
 very, very few in the 20th century

17:15.600 --> 17:17.840
 of the many that have been there.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.600
 The wars that were seen as just,

17:19.600 --> 17:22.480
 first of all, the most just war is seen as World War II,

17:22.480 --> 17:23.320
 by far.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.200
 It's actually the only one that goes above a threshold

17:28.200 --> 17:30.520
 as seen as just, everything is seen as unjust.

17:30.520 --> 17:35.520
 It's less, it's like degrees of unjustness.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.360
 And I think the ones that are seen as more just

17:39.360 --> 17:40.760
 are the ones that are fast.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.120
 That you have a very specific purpose,

17:44.120 --> 17:46.560
 you communicate that purpose honestly

17:46.560 --> 17:48.280
 with the global community,

17:48.280 --> 17:51.560
 and you strike hard, fast, and you pull out.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.880
 To do sort of, it's like a rescue missions.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.600
 It's almost like policing work.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.960
 If there's somebody suffering,

17:58.960 --> 18:02.760
 you go in and stop that suffering directly, that's it.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.120
 I think World War II is seen in that way.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.640
 That there's an obvious aggressor

18:09.640 --> 18:11.680
 that is causing a lot of suffering in the world

18:11.680 --> 18:15.000
 and looking to expand the scale of that suffering.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.040
 And so you strike, I mean, given the scale,

18:19.040 --> 18:22.560
 you strike hard as hard and as fast as possible

18:22.560 --> 18:25.960
 to stop the expansion of the suffering.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.240
 And so that's kind of how they see.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.520
 I don't know if you can kind of look with this framework

18:32.520 --> 18:36.280
 that you've presented and look at Hitler and think,

18:36.280 --> 18:41.280
 well, it's not in his interest to attack Czechoslovakia,

18:41.280 --> 18:46.280
 Czechoslovakia, Poland, Britain, France,

18:49.400 --> 18:54.280
 Russia, the Soviet Union, America,

18:54.280 --> 18:59.000
 the United States of America, same with Japan.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.440
 Is it in their long term interest?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
 I don't know.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.720
 So for me, who cares about alleviating human suffering

19:08.720 --> 19:13.720
 in the world, yes, it seems like almost no war is just.

19:16.560 --> 19:21.560
 But it also seems somehow deeply human to fight.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.320
 And I think your book makes the case, no, it's not.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.160
 Can you try to like get at that?

19:28.160 --> 19:31.200
 Cause it seems that war, there is some,

19:31.200 --> 19:35.840
 that like drum of war seems to beat in all human hearts.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.560
 Like it's in there somewhere.

19:37.560 --> 19:41.200
 Maybe it's, maybe there's like a relic of the past

19:41.200 --> 19:42.480
 that we need to get rid of it.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.720
 It's deeply irrational.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.160
 Okay, so obviously we go to war

19:46.160 --> 19:47.520
 and obviously there's a lot of violence.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.800
 And so we have to explain something

19:49.800 --> 19:52.640
 and some of that's going to be aspects of our humanness.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.880
 So I guess what I wanted us to sort of start with,

19:56.880 --> 19:59.320
 I think it was just useful to sort of start and point out,

19:59.320 --> 20:02.200
 actually, there's really, really, really, really strong

20:02.200 --> 20:03.520
 incentives not to go to war

20:03.520 --> 20:04.880
 because it's going to be really costly.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.080
 And so all of these other human or strategic things,

20:08.080 --> 20:10.560
 all these things, the circumstantial things

20:10.560 --> 20:13.080
 that will eventually lead us to go to war

20:13.080 --> 20:16.720
 have to be pretty powerful before we go there.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.400
 And most of the time.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.520
 Sorry to interrupt.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.560
 And that's why you also describe very importantly

20:22.560 --> 20:25.640
 that war throughout human history is actually rare.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.800
 We usually avoid it.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.280
 You know, most people don't know about

20:30.280 --> 20:32.920
 the US invasion of Haiti in 1994.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.120
 I mean, a lot of people know about it,

20:34.120 --> 20:35.760
 but people just don't pay attention to it.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.520
 We're going to, you know, the history books

20:38.520 --> 20:39.920
 and school kids are going to learn about

20:39.920 --> 20:43.640
 the invasion of Afghanistan for decades and decades.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.560
 And nobody is going to put this one in the history books.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.480
 And it's because it didn't actually happen

20:50.480 --> 20:54.600
 because before the troops could land,

20:54.600 --> 20:59.000
 the person who'd taken power in a coup basically said, fine.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.280
 There's this famous story where Colin Powell goes to Haiti

21:03.280 --> 21:06.440
 to this new dictator who's refused to let a democratic

21:06.440 --> 21:10.720
 president take power and tries to convince him

21:10.720 --> 21:11.880
 to step down or else.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.800
 And he says, no, no, no, and then he shows him a video

21:14.800 --> 21:16.840
 and it's basically troop planes

21:16.840 --> 21:19.000
 and all these things taking off.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.280
 And he's like, this is not live.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.600
 This is two hours ago.

21:21.600 --> 21:26.600
 So it's a, and basically, he basically gives up right there.

21:26.760 --> 21:27.600
 So that was.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.080
 That's a powerful move.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.320
 Yeah.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.040
 I think Powell might have been one of his teachers

21:33.040 --> 21:34.480
 in like a US military college

21:34.480 --> 21:36.640
 because a lot of these military dictator trained

21:36.640 --> 21:37.480
 at some point.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.480
 So they had some, there was some personal relationships

21:39.480 --> 21:40.720
 at least between people in the US government

21:40.720 --> 21:42.840
 and this guy that they were trying to use.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.760
 The point is, and that's like what should have happened.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.800
 Like that makes sense, right?

21:46.800 --> 21:51.440
 Like, yeah, maybe I can mount an insurgency and yeah,

21:51.440 --> 21:52.720
 I'm not going to bear a lot of the costs of work

21:52.720 --> 21:54.520
 because I'm the dictator and maybe he's human

21:54.520 --> 21:56.280
 and he just wants to fight or gets angry

21:56.280 --> 21:58.200
 or it's just in his mind, whatever he's doing.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.160
 But at the end of the day, he's like,

21:59.160 --> 22:00.400
 this does not make sense.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.640
 And that's what happens most of the time

22:04.640 --> 22:06.760
 but we don't write so many books about it.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.720
 And now some political scientists go

22:10.720 --> 22:13.080
 and they count up all of the nations that could fight

22:13.080 --> 22:14.120
 because they have some dispute

22:14.120 --> 22:15.960
 and they're right next to one another, one another

22:15.960 --> 22:17.520
 or they look at the ethnic groups

22:17.520 --> 22:18.600
 that could fight with one another

22:18.600 --> 22:19.840
 because they have, there's some tension

22:19.840 --> 22:21.320
 and they're right next to one another

22:21.320 --> 22:25.840
 and then whatever, some number like 999 out of 1000

22:25.840 --> 22:29.920
 don't fight because they just find some other way.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.240
 They don't like each other

22:31.240 --> 22:32.800
 but they just loathe in peace

22:32.800 --> 22:35.040
 because that's the sensible thing to do.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.440
 And that's what we all do, we loathe in peace.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.320
 And we loathe the Soviet Union in relative peace

22:40.320 --> 22:44.360
 for decades and India loathes Pakistan in peace.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.800
 I mean, two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.840
 again, it was in the newspapers

22:48.840 --> 22:51.480
 but most people didn't, I think, take note,

22:51.480 --> 22:55.720
 India accidentally launched a cruise missile at Pakistan

22:55.720 --> 22:57.680
 and common suit.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.440
 So they were like, yeah, this is,

22:59.440 --> 23:00.680
 we do not wanna go to war.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.600
 This will be bad.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.920
 We'll be angry but we'll accept your explanation

23:05.920 --> 23:07.200
 that this was an accident.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.800
 And so these things find to the radar.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.440
 And so we overestimate, I think,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.680
 how likely it is the sides are gonna fight.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.000
 But then of course, things do happen.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.440
 Like Russia did invade the Ukraine

23:19.440 --> 23:22.680
 and didn't find some negotiated deal.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.840
 And so then the book is sort of about,

23:25.840 --> 23:28.600
 half the book is just sort of laying out,

23:28.600 --> 23:31.120
 actually, there's just different ways this breaks down.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.640
 And some of them are human.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.160
 Some of them are this.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.240
 I actually don't think war beats in our heart.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.880
 It does a little bit, but we're actually very cooperative.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.040
 As a species, we're deeply, deeply cooperative.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.160
 We're really, really good.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.840
 So the thing we're not, we're okay at violence

23:47.840 --> 23:50.120
 and we're okay at getting angry and vengeance

23:50.120 --> 23:53.400
 and we have principles that will sometimes lead us.

23:53.400 --> 23:57.040
 But we're actually really, really, really good at cooperation.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.800
 And so that's again, I'm not trying to write

23:59.800 --> 24:02.240
 some big optimistic book where everything's gonna be great

24:02.240 --> 24:03.760
 and we're all happy and we don't really fight.

24:03.760 --> 24:07.400
 It's more just to say, let's start, let's be like a doctor.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.200
 As a doctor, we're gonna focus on the sick, right?

24:10.200 --> 24:12.120
 I'm gonna try, I know there's sick people,

24:12.120 --> 24:14.680
 but I'm gonna recognize that the normal state is health

24:14.680 --> 24:16.320
 and that most people are healthy.

24:16.320 --> 24:17.960
 And that's gonna make me a better doctor.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.280
 And that's, I'm kind of saying the same thing.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.080
 Let's be better doctors of politics in the world

24:22.080 --> 24:25.160
 by recognizing that like the normal state is health.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.320
 And then we're gonna identify like,

24:27.320 --> 24:30.360
 what are the diseases that are causing this warfare?

24:30.360 --> 24:33.160
 So yeah, the natural state of the human body

24:33.160 --> 24:35.360
 with the immune system and all the different parts

24:36.760 --> 24:40.520
 wants to be healthy and is really damn good at being healthy.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.840
 But sometimes it breaks down.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.360
 Let's understand how it breaks down.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.200
 Yeah, exactly.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.040
 So what are the five ways that you list

24:47.040 --> 24:48.840
 that are the roots of war?

24:48.840 --> 24:50.400
 Yeah, so I mean, they're kind of like buckets.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.600
 Like there's sort of things that rhyme, right?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.240
 You know, because it's not all the same.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.760
 There's like lots of reasons to go to where there's this

24:55.760 --> 24:58.040
 great line, you know, there's a reason for every war

24:58.040 --> 24:59.560
 and a war for every reason.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.720
 And that's true.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.680
 And it's kind of overwhelming, right?

25:02.680 --> 25:04.400
 And it's overwhelming for a lot of people.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.880
 It was overwhelming for me for a lot of time.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.280
 And I think, I think one of the gifts of this,

25:08.280 --> 25:10.280
 of social science is actually people have started

25:10.280 --> 25:11.400
 to organize this for us.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.240
 And I just tried to organize it like a tiny bit better.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.280
 Buckets that rhyme.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.120
 Buckets.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.680
 Yeah, the terrible metaphor, right?

25:18.680 --> 25:19.920
 I had it metaphors.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.520
 So the idea was that like that basic instead of like

25:22.520 --> 25:24.000
 something overrides these incentives.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.360
 And I guess I was saying there's five ways

25:26.360 --> 25:27.960
 that they get overrided.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.120
 And three are, I'd call strategic.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.320
 Like they're kind of logical.

25:31.320 --> 25:35.440
 There's circumstances that, and this is,

25:35.440 --> 25:37.560
 they're sort of where strategic is strategy

25:37.560 --> 25:41.080
 is like the game theory is you could use those two things

25:41.080 --> 25:43.480
 interchangeably, but game theory is sort of making it

25:43.480 --> 25:45.040
 sound more complicated, I think than it is.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.280
 It's basically saying that there's times when this is

25:47.280 --> 25:51.160
 like the optimal choice because of circumstances.

25:51.160 --> 25:55.000
 And one of them is when the people who are deciding

25:55.000 --> 25:56.960
 don't bear those costs.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.800
 So that's, or maybe even have a private incentive

25:59.800 --> 26:02.560
 that's gonna, that's, if they don't,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.400
 if they're ignoring the cost, then maybe the costs

26:04.400 --> 26:06.680
 of war are not so material.

26:06.680 --> 26:07.960
 That's a contributing factor.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.680
 And others just, there's uncertainty and we can talk

26:10.680 --> 26:13.520
 about that, but there's just the absence of information

26:13.520 --> 26:15.360
 means that it actually, there's circumstances

26:15.360 --> 26:17.760
 where it's your best choice to attack.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.760
 There's this thing that political economists call

26:19.760 --> 26:21.840
 commitment problems, which are basically saying

26:21.840 --> 26:23.800
 there's some big power shift that you can avoid

26:23.800 --> 26:24.640
 by attacking now.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.920
 So it's like a dynamic incentive.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.120
 It's sort of saying, well, in order to keep something

26:28.120 --> 26:30.760
 from happening in the future, I can attack now.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.000
 And because of the structure of incentives,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.120
 it actually makes sense for me.

26:34.120 --> 26:38.440
 Even the words in theory, really costly,

26:38.440 --> 26:40.720
 or it is really costly nonetheless.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.840
 And then there's these sort of human things.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.200
 One's a little bit like just war.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.760
 One's sort of saying there's like ideologies

26:45.760 --> 26:49.400
 or principles or things we value that weigh against

26:49.400 --> 26:50.960
 those costs.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.080
 Like exterminating the heretical idea

26:54.080 --> 26:58.000
 or standing up for a principle might be so valuable

26:58.000 --> 27:00.480
 to me that I'm willing to use violence,

27:00.480 --> 27:01.920
 even if it's costly.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.040
 And there's nothing irrational about that.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.960
 And then the fifth bucket is all of the irrationalities,

27:08.960 --> 27:11.240
 all the passions and all of the most importantly,

27:11.240 --> 27:13.200
 I think like misperceptions, the way we get,

27:13.200 --> 27:15.840
 like we basically make wrong calculations

27:15.840 --> 27:18.400
 about whether or not war is the right decision we get.

27:18.400 --> 27:21.840
 Or we misunderstand or misjudge our enemy

27:21.840 --> 27:23.160
 or misjudge ourselves.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.200
 So if you put all those things into buckets,

27:25.200 --> 27:29.920
 how much can it be modeled in a simple game theoretic way?

27:29.920 --> 27:32.080
 And how much of it is a giant human mess?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.520
 So four of those five are really,

27:35.520 --> 27:38.520
 on some level, easy to think strategically

27:38.520 --> 27:41.840
 and model in a simple way in the sense

27:41.840 --> 27:43.080
 that any of us can do it.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.360
 We do this all the time.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.920
 You know, think of like bargaining in a market

27:48.920 --> 27:52.720
 for a carpet or something or whatever you bargained for.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.120
 You're thinking a few steps ahead

27:56.120 --> 27:58.960
 about what your opponent's going to do.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.720
 And you stake out a high, like a low price

28:01.720 --> 28:04.600
 and the seller stakes out a high price.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.800
 And you might both say, oh, I refuse to like,

28:06.800 --> 28:07.920
 I could never accept that.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.920
 And there's all this sort of cheap talk.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.400
 But you kind of understand where you're going

28:13.400 --> 28:15.960
 and it's efficient to like find a deal

28:15.960 --> 28:18.680
 and by the market, by the carpet eventually.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.080
 So we all understand this,

28:21.080 --> 28:23.840
 like game theory and the strategy, I think intuitively.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.720
 Or maybe even a closer example is like, suppose,

28:28.080 --> 28:30.200
 I don't know, you have a tenant you need to evict

28:30.200 --> 28:33.040
 or anyone normal like kind of legal,

28:33.040 --> 28:34.480
 it's not yet a legal dispute, right?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.120
 Like we just have a dispute with a neighbor

28:36.120 --> 28:37.280
 or somebody else.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.760
 Most of us don't end up going to court.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.040
 Going to court is like the war option.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.560
 It's the costly thing that just ought to be able to avoid.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.400
 We ought to be able to find something between ourselves

28:47.400 --> 28:51.160
 that doesn't require this hiring lawyers

28:51.160 --> 28:53.360
 and a long drawn out trial.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.400
 And most of the time we do, right?

28:55.400 --> 28:58.000
 And so we all understand that incentive.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.040
 And then for those five buckets,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.880
 so everything except all the irrational

29:02.880 --> 29:05.400
 and the misperceptions are really easy to model.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.720
 Then from a technical standpoint,

29:06.720 --> 29:10.040
 it's actually pretty tricky to model the misperceptions.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.560
 And I'm not a game theorist.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.440
 And so I'm more channeling my colleagues

29:13.440 --> 29:15.040
 who do this and what I know.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.120
 But it's not rocket science.

29:18.120 --> 29:22.040
 I mean, I think that's what I try to lay out in the book

29:22.040 --> 29:24.520
 is like there's all these ideas out there

29:24.520 --> 29:27.560
 that can actually help us just make sense of all these wars

29:28.640 --> 29:33.280
 and just bring some order to the more ass of reasons.

29:33.280 --> 29:37.160
 Well, to push back a lot of things in one sentence.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.720
 So first of all, rocket science is actually pretty simple.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.800
 People, I think.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.520
 I'll defer to you actually.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.080
 Well, I think it's cause unfortunately it's very,

29:46.080 --> 29:49.000
 like engineering, it's very well defined.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.160
 The problem is well defined.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.680
 The problem with humanity is it's actually complicated.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.600
 So it is true, it's not rocket science,

29:55.600 --> 29:56.480
 but it is not true.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.600
 It's easy because it's not rocket science.

29:58.600 --> 30:03.600
 But the problem, the downside of game theory

30:04.840 --> 30:08.440
 is not that it helps us make sense of the world.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.240
 It projects a simple model of the world

30:11.240 --> 30:15.280
 that brings this comfort in thinking we understand.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.960
 And sometimes that simplification

30:17.960 --> 30:20.840
 is actually getting it to core

30:20.840 --> 30:23.480
 first principles on understanding of something.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.040
 And sometimes it fools us into thinking we understand.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.400
 So for example, I mean,

30:29.400 --> 30:32.080
 mutually assured destruction is a very simple model.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.760
 And people argue all the time,

30:33.760 --> 30:35.880
 whether that's actually a good model or not.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.760
 But there's empirical fact that we're still alive

30:38.760 --> 30:40.240
 as a human civilization.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.080
 And also in the game theoretic sense,

30:43.080 --> 30:47.160
 do we model individual leaders and their relationships?

30:47.160 --> 30:50.960
 Do we, the staff, the generals,

30:50.960 --> 30:55.960
 or do we also have to model the culture, the people,

30:55.960 --> 31:00.440
 the suffering of the people, the economic frustration,

31:00.440 --> 31:02.560
 or the anger, the distrust?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.120
 Do you have to model all those things?

31:04.120 --> 31:05.720
 Do they come into play?

31:05.720 --> 31:07.800
 And sometimes, I mean, again,

31:07.800 --> 31:10.680
 we could be romanticizing those things

31:10.680 --> 31:12.040
 from a historical perspective.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.240
 But when you look at history

31:13.240 --> 31:15.760
 and you look at the way wars start,

31:15.760 --> 31:20.200
 it sometimes feels like a little bit of a misunderstanding

31:20.200 --> 31:23.960
 escalates, escalates, escalates,

31:23.960 --> 31:28.240
 and just builds on top of itself.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.320
 And all of a sudden it's an all out war.

31:30.320 --> 31:35.200
 It's the escalation with nobody hitting the brakes.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.960
 So, I mean, you're absolutely right in the sense

31:38.960 --> 31:42.040
 that it's totally possible to oversimplify these things

31:42.040 --> 31:44.160
 and take the game theory too seriously.

31:44.160 --> 31:49.240
 And some, and people who study those things

31:49.240 --> 31:52.360
 and write those models and people like me who use them,

31:52.360 --> 31:54.200
 because sometimes they make that mistake,

31:54.200 --> 31:55.440
 I think that's not the mistake

31:55.440 --> 31:58.360
 that most people make most often.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.680
 And what's actually true is I think

31:59.680 --> 32:01.720
 most people, we're actually really quick,

32:01.720 --> 32:05.080
 whether it's the US invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq,

32:05.080 --> 32:07.080
 we're really quick to blame that

32:07.080 --> 32:10.280
 on the humanness and the culture and that.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.880
 So we're really quick to say, oh, this was George W. Bush's

32:14.880 --> 32:17.200
 either desire for revenge and vengeance

32:17.200 --> 32:20.800
 or some private agenda or blood for oil.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.600
 So we're really quick to blame it on these things.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.760
 And then we're really, we tend to overlook

32:26.760 --> 32:30.280
 the strategic incentives to attack,

32:30.280 --> 32:31.640
 which I think were probably dominant.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.880
 I think those things might have been true to a degree,

32:33.880 --> 32:36.880
 but I don't think they were enough to ever bring

32:36.880 --> 32:37.720
 those wars about.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.400
 Just like, I think people are very quick

32:39.400 --> 32:41.480
 to sort of in this current invasion

32:41.480 --> 32:46.480
 to sort of talk about Putin's grand visions

32:48.240 --> 32:50.320
 of being the next Catherine the Great

32:50.320 --> 32:55.320
 or nationalist ideals and the mistakes

32:55.320 --> 32:56.960
 and the miscalculations were really quick

32:56.960 --> 32:58.280
 to sort of say, oh, that must be,

32:58.280 --> 32:59.960
 and then kind of pause or not pause,

32:59.960 --> 33:02.560
 maybe even stop there and not see

33:02.560 --> 33:05.040
 some of the strategic incentives.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.960
 And so, I guess we have to do both.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.800
 But the strategic, I guess I would say

33:10.800 --> 33:13.640
 like the war is just such a big problem

33:13.640 --> 33:18.560
 and it's just so costly that the strategic incentives

33:18.560 --> 33:21.160
 and the things that game theory has given us

33:21.160 --> 33:23.680
 are like really important in understanding

33:23.680 --> 33:27.480
 why there was so little room for negotiation and a bargain

33:27.480 --> 33:31.280
 that things like a leader's mistakes start to matter

33:31.280 --> 33:35.360
 or a leader's nationalist ideals or delusions

33:35.360 --> 33:37.120
 or vengeance actually matters,

33:37.120 --> 33:38.360
 because those do matter,

33:38.360 --> 33:42.080
 but they only matter when the capacity to find a deal

33:42.080 --> 33:45.160
 is so narrow because of the circumstances.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.640
 And so, it's sort of like saying,

33:48.640 --> 33:52.880
 like an elderly person who dies of pneumonia, right?

33:52.880 --> 33:55.600
 Pneumonia killed them, obviously,

33:55.600 --> 33:58.760
 but that's not the reason pneumonia was able to kill them.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.280
 All of the fundamentals and the circumstances

34:01.280 --> 34:02.840
 were like made them very fragile.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.320
 And that's how I think all the strategic forces

34:05.320 --> 34:09.880
 make that situation fragile and then the miscalculations

34:09.880 --> 34:11.560
 and all of these things you just said,

34:11.560 --> 34:13.760
 which are so important are kind of like the pneumonia.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.400
 And let's sort of, let's pay attention to both.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.280
 And you're saying that people don't,

34:18.280 --> 34:20.440
 disproportionately pay attention to the...

34:20.440 --> 34:21.280
 It's hard.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.120
 I mean, it wasn't...

34:22.120 --> 34:26.800
 It took me a long time to learn to recognize them.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.640
 And it takes many people, you know,

34:28.640 --> 34:31.640
 it took, and it took generations of social scientists

34:33.080 --> 34:35.800
 years and years to figure some of this out

34:35.800 --> 34:37.640
 and to sort of help people understand it

34:37.640 --> 34:39.000
 and clarify concepts.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.280
 So it's not, it's just not that easy.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.120
 No, it's not hard.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.360
 I think it's possible to,

34:43.360 --> 34:45.640
 just as I was taught a lot of the stuff I write in the book

34:45.640 --> 34:47.320
 in graduate school or from reading,

34:47.320 --> 34:49.840
 and it's possible to communicate and learn this stuff,

34:49.840 --> 34:51.040
 but it's still really hard.

34:51.040 --> 34:55.200
 And so that's kind of what I was trying to do

34:55.200 --> 34:57.520
 is like close that gap and just make it,

34:57.520 --> 35:02.080
 help people recognize these things in the wild.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.480
 Before we zoom back out,

35:03.480 --> 35:06.560
 let me at a high level first ask,

35:06.560 --> 35:09.560
 what are your thoughts on the ongoing war in Ukraine?

35:09.560 --> 35:12.640
 How do you analyze it within your framework about war?

35:12.640 --> 35:14.080
 A Russian colleague of mine,

35:14.080 --> 35:15.600
 Konstantin Sonin tells this story

35:15.600 --> 35:18.280
 about a visiting Ukrainian professor

35:18.280 --> 35:19.120
 who's at the university

35:19.120 --> 35:21.320
 and one night he's walking down the street

35:21.320 --> 35:25.080
 and he's talking on two cell phones at once for some reason

35:25.080 --> 35:29.320
 and a mugger stops him and demands the phones.

35:29.320 --> 35:32.240
 And it's sort of like dead panway Konstantin says,

35:32.240 --> 35:34.800
 and because he was Ukrainian, he decided to fight.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.840
 And I think that's a little bit like what happened.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.160
 Most of us in that situation

35:41.160 --> 35:43.240
 would hand over our cell phones.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.240
 And so in this situation, Putin's like the mugger

35:47.240 --> 35:50.720
 and the Ukrainian people are being asked to hand over this thing

35:50.720 --> 35:54.120
 and they're saying, no, we're not gonna hand this over.

35:54.120 --> 35:59.120
 And the fact is, most people do.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.720
 Most people faced with a superpower or a tyrant

36:02.720 --> 36:06.080
 or an autocrat or a murderous warlord

36:06.080 --> 36:09.400
 who says hand this over, they hand it over.

36:09.400 --> 36:14.320
 And that's why there are so many unequal

36:14.320 --> 36:16.120
 imperial relationships in the world.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.040
 That's what empire is.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.520
 Empire is successive people saying, fine,

36:20.520 --> 36:22.960
 we'll give up some degree of freedom or sovereignty

36:22.960 --> 36:24.360
 because you're too powerful.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.400
 And the Ukrainians said, no way.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.880
 This is just too precious.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.080
 And so I said one of those buckets

36:30.080 --> 36:32.240
 where there's a set of values.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.320
 There's something that we value

36:35.240 --> 36:37.280
 that is so valuable to us and important.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.960
 Sometimes it's terrible.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.960
 Sometimes it's the extermination of another people,

36:41.960 --> 36:43.640
 but sometimes it's something noble,

36:43.640 --> 36:46.840
 like liberty or refusal to part with sovereignty.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.960
 And in those circumstances, people will decide,

36:49.960 --> 36:52.280
 I will endure the costs.

36:52.280 --> 36:55.400
 They probably, I mean, I think they knew

36:55.400 --> 36:57.000
 what they were probably risking.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.760
 And so to me, that's not to blame the Ukrainians

37:00.760 --> 37:03.240
 any more than I would blame Americans

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
 for the American Revolution.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.920
 It's actually a very similar story.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.320
 You had a tyrannical, militarily superior,

37:11.720 --> 37:15.560
 pretty non democratic entity come and say,

37:15.560 --> 37:17.360
 you're gonna have partial sovereignty.

37:18.440 --> 37:23.160
 And Americans for ideological reasons said, no way.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.520
 And that, people like Bernard Bale and other historians,

37:25.520 --> 37:27.520
 that's like the dominant story of the American Revolution.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.160
 It wasn't the ideological origins

37:29.160 --> 37:30.600
 just attachment to this idea of liberty.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.160
 And so I start, now there's lots of other reasons

37:33.160 --> 37:35.360
 I think why this happened.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.920
 But I think for me, it starts with

37:37.920 --> 37:42.520
 Ukrainians failing to make that sensible, quote unquote,

37:42.520 --> 37:46.120
 rational deal that says we should relinquish

37:46.120 --> 37:47.720
 some of our sovereignty because Russia

37:47.720 --> 37:49.040
 is more powerful than we are.

37:50.880 --> 37:55.720
 So there's a very clinical look at the war.

37:56.840 --> 38:01.000
 Meaning there is a man in a country,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
 Vladimir Putin, that makes a claim on a land,

38:07.080 --> 38:09.800
 builds up troops and invades.

38:09.800 --> 38:10.960
 Yeah.

38:10.960 --> 38:15.440
 The way to avoid suffering there

38:15.440 --> 38:19.360
 and the way to avoid death and the way to avoid war

38:19.360 --> 38:24.360
 is to back down and basically let,

38:26.360 --> 38:28.280
 there's a list of interests he provides

38:28.280 --> 38:30.080
 and you go along with that.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.760
 That's when the goal is to avoid war.

38:35.760 --> 38:40.400
 Now let's do some other calculus.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.160
 Let's think about Britain.

38:43.160 --> 38:48.160
 So France fought Hitler, but did not fight very hard.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.320
 Portugal, there's a lot of stories of countries like this.

38:52.320 --> 38:57.320
 And there is Winston motherfucking Churchill.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.800
 He's one of the rare humans in history

39:00.800 --> 39:03.960
 who had that we shall fight on the beaches.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.880
 It made no sense.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.720
 Hitler did not say he's going to destroy Britain.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.840
 He seemed to show respect for Britain.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.480
 He wanted to keep the British Empire.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.400
 It made total sense, it was obvious

39:17.400 --> 39:18.600
 that Britain was going to lose

39:18.600 --> 39:20.200
 if Hitler goes all in on Britain

39:20.200 --> 39:22.120
 as it seemed like he was going to.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.160
 And yet Winston Churchill said a big FU.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.240
 Yeah.

39:27.240 --> 39:31.160
 Similar thing, Zelensky and the Ukrainian people

39:31.160 --> 39:33.680
 said FU in the same kind of way.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.000
 So I think we're saying the same things.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.640
 I'm being more clinical about it.

39:38.640 --> 39:43.000
 Well, I'm trying to understand, and we won't know this,

39:43.920 --> 39:48.760
 but which path minimizes human suffering in the long term?

39:49.840 --> 39:51.680
 Well, on the eve of the war,

39:51.680 --> 39:53.960
 Ukraine was poor in a per person term

39:53.960 --> 39:55.480
 since it was in 1990.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.320
 The economy is just completely stagnated.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.920
 In Russia, meanwhile, like many other parts of the region,

40:00.920 --> 40:03.240
 it sort of has boomed to a degree.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.680
 I mean, certainly because of oil and gas,

40:04.680 --> 40:07.440
 but also for a variety of other reasons,

40:07.440 --> 40:09.880
 and Putin's consolidated political control.

40:09.880 --> 40:14.680
 And from a very cold, blooded and calculated point of view,

40:14.680 --> 40:17.720
 I think one way Putin and Russia could look at this,

40:17.720 --> 40:19.480
 it says, look, we were temporarily weak

40:19.480 --> 40:22.600
 after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

40:22.600 --> 40:25.760
 And the rest in the West basically took advantage of that,

40:25.760 --> 40:27.600
 like Bravo, you pulled it off,

40:27.600 --> 40:30.120
 you basically crept democracy and capitalism,

40:30.120 --> 40:32.560
 all these things right up to our border.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.480
 And now we have regained some of our strength.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.240
 We've consolidated political control,

40:37.240 --> 40:40.880
 we've caled our people, we have a stronger economy,

40:40.880 --> 40:44.440
 and we somehow got Germany and other European nations

40:44.440 --> 40:46.280
 to give up energy independence,

40:46.280 --> 40:48.160
 and actually just we've got an enormous amount

40:48.160 --> 40:49.080
 of leverage over you.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.600
 And now we wanna roll back some of your success

40:52.600 --> 40:55.800
 because we were powerful enough to demand it.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.400
 And you've been taking advantage of the situation,

40:59.400 --> 41:04.120
 which is maybe a fair impartial analysis.

41:04.120 --> 41:08.320
 And in the West, but more specifically Ukraine said,

41:08.320 --> 41:11.360
 but that's a price too high, which I totally respect.

41:11.360 --> 41:15.360
 I would maybe I'd like to think I'd make that same decision,

41:15.360 --> 41:17.600
 but that's the answer.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.200
 If the answer is why would they fight if it's so costly?

41:20.200 --> 41:21.400
 Why not find a deal?

41:21.400 --> 41:24.320
 It's because they weren't willing to give Russia

41:24.320 --> 41:28.320
 the thing that their power said they quote unquote deserve.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.440
 Just like Americans said to the Britain,

41:30.440 --> 41:34.160
 yeah, of course we ought to accept semi sovereignty,

41:35.960 --> 41:40.960
 but we refuse and we'd rather injure a bloody fight

41:42.040 --> 41:45.080
 that we might lose than take this.

41:45.080 --> 41:49.080
 And so you need some of these other five buckets.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.840
 You need them to understand the situation.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.040
 You need to sort of, there are other things going on,

41:54.040 --> 41:55.800
 but I do think it's fundamental

41:55.800 --> 42:00.800
 that this noble intransigence is a big part of it.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.280
 Well, let me just say a few things if it's okay.

42:06.280 --> 42:11.280
 So your analysis is clear and objective.

42:12.840 --> 42:16.960
 My analysis isn't either clear nor objective.

42:18.680 --> 42:22.600
 First, I've been going through a lot.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.720
 I'm a different man over the past four or five weeks

42:25.720 --> 42:26.840
 than I was before.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.760
 I in general have come to,

42:33.360 --> 42:37.120
 there's anger, I've come to despise leaders in general

42:38.960 --> 42:40.560
 because leaders wage war

42:40.560 --> 42:42.680
 and the people pay the price for that war.

42:44.120 --> 42:47.520
 Let me just say on this point of standing up

42:47.520 --> 42:52.520
 to an invader that I am half Ukrainian, half Russian,

42:52.520 --> 42:55.320
 that I'm proud of the Ukrainian people.

42:56.760 --> 43:00.360
 Whatever the sacrifices, whatever the scale of pain,

43:00.360 --> 43:03.720
 standing up, there's something in me that's proud.

43:03.720 --> 43:08.720
 Maybe that's, maybe that's whatever the fuck that is.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.680
 Maybe that blood runs in me.

43:12.320 --> 43:15.640
 I love the Ukrainian people, love the Russian people.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.000
 And whatever that fight is,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.400
 whatever that suffering is, the millions of refugees,

43:20.400 --> 43:24.480
 whatever this war is, the dictators come to power

43:24.480 --> 43:26.180
 and their power falls.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.760
 I just love that that spirit burns bright still.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.200
 And I do, maybe I'm wrong in this,

43:34.200 --> 43:37.880
 do see Ukrainian and Russian people as one people

43:37.880 --> 43:41.400
 in a way that's not just cultural, geopolitical,

43:41.400 --> 43:43.280
 but just given the history.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.800
 I think about the same kind of fighting

43:46.800 --> 43:50.560
 when Hitler with all of his forces chose

43:50.560 --> 43:53.840
 to invade the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.560
 When he went and that Russian winter,

43:58.560 --> 44:02.240
 and a lot of people, and that pisses me off

44:02.240 --> 44:05.120
 because if you know your history,

44:05.120 --> 44:08.120
 it's not the winter that stopped Hitler,

44:08.120 --> 44:10.560
 it's the Red Army, it's the people

44:10.560 --> 44:14.840
 that refused to back down, they fought proudly.

44:14.840 --> 44:18.120
 That pride, that's something.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.160
 That's the human spirit.

44:20.160 --> 44:23.640
 That's in war, war is hell,

44:23.640 --> 44:28.440
 but it really pushes people to stand

44:28.440 --> 44:30.280
 for the things they believe in.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.280
 It's the William Wallace speech from Braveheart.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.040
 I think about this a lot.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
 That does not fit into your framework.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.560
 No, no, no, I'm gonna disagree.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.680
 I think it totally fits in and it's this,

44:41.680 --> 44:45.120
 there's nothing irrational about what we believe,

44:45.120 --> 44:50.120
 especially those principles which we hold the most dear.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.480
 I'm merely trying to say that there's a calculus,

44:53.480 --> 44:56.720
 there's one calculus over here that says,

44:56.720 --> 45:00.000
 Russia's more powerful than it was 20 years ago

45:00.000 --> 45:02.920
 and even 10 years ago and Ukraine is not,

45:02.920 --> 45:05.200
 and it's asking for something,

45:05.200 --> 45:08.040
 and there's an incentive to give that up.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.640
 That's obvious, there's an incentive to comply.

45:10.640 --> 45:14.680
 But my understanding is many of these post Soviet republics

45:14.680 --> 45:17.640
 have appeased, which is what we call compromise

45:17.640 --> 45:19.080
 when we disagree with it.

45:19.080 --> 45:21.800
 They've, all of these other peoples

45:21.800 --> 45:25.680
 in the Russian sphere of influence have not stood up.

45:26.840 --> 45:29.720
 And Russians, many Russians have tried to stand up

45:29.720 --> 45:31.720
 and they've been beaten down.

45:31.720 --> 45:35.320
 And now people have, we'll see,

45:35.320 --> 45:38.000
 but people have not been standing up very much.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.200
 And so lots of people are cowed and lots of people

45:41.200 --> 45:43.920
 have appeased and lots of people hear that speech

45:43.920 --> 45:47.240
 and think I would like to do that, but don't.

45:47.240 --> 45:50.920
 And so, and my point is that, sadly,

45:50.920 --> 45:52.800
 we live in a world where a lot of people

45:54.080 --> 45:58.240
 get stepped on by tyrants and empire and whatnot

45:58.240 --> 45:59.240
 and don't rise up.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.600
 And so, I think we could admire,

46:01.600 --> 46:04.760
 especially when they stand up for these reasons.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.680
 And I think we can admire Churchill for that reason.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.720
 I think we could, that's why we admire

46:08.720 --> 46:11.000
 the leaders of the American revolution and so on.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.120
 But it doesn't always happen.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.840
 And I don't actually know why,

46:13.840 --> 46:15.080
 but I don't think it's irrational.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.400
 I think it's just, it's something, it's about

46:17.400 --> 46:20.080
 a set of values and it's hard to predict.

46:20.080 --> 46:21.120
 And it was hard for,

46:23.040 --> 46:24.920
 Putin might not have been out of line

46:24.920 --> 46:27.320
 and thinking just like everybody else

46:27.320 --> 46:30.040
 in my sphere of influence, they're gonna roll over too.

46:31.320 --> 46:34.680
 And I should mention, because we haven't,

46:34.680 --> 46:37.480
 that a lot of this calculation,

46:37.480 --> 46:39.520
 from an objective point of view,

46:39.520 --> 46:42.920
 you have to include United States and NATO

46:42.920 --> 46:45.360
 into the pressure they apply into the region.

46:46.360 --> 46:50.480
 That said, I care little about leaders

46:50.480 --> 46:54.040
 that do cruel things onto the world.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.560
 They lead to a lot of suffering,

46:55.560 --> 46:57.760
 but I still believe that the Russian people

46:57.760 --> 47:00.680
 and the Ukrainian people are great people that stand up

47:00.680 --> 47:03.120
 and I admire people that stand up

47:03.120 --> 47:05.360
 and are willing to give their life.

47:05.360 --> 47:10.360
 And I think Russian people are very much that too,

47:11.560 --> 47:16.280
 especially when the enemy is coming for your home

47:16.280 --> 47:17.640
 over the hill.

47:17.640 --> 47:21.400
 Sometimes standing up to an authoritarian regime

47:21.400 --> 47:24.160
 is difficult because you don't know,

47:25.400 --> 47:30.400
 it's not a monster that's attacking your home directly.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.120
 It's kind of like the boiling of a lobster

47:33.120 --> 47:34.520
 or something like that.

47:34.520 --> 47:39.280
 It's a slow control of your mind and the population.

47:39.280 --> 47:42.200
 And our minds get controlled even in the West

47:42.200 --> 47:44.520
 by the media, by the narratives.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.200
 It's very difficult to wake up one day

47:47.200 --> 47:52.200
 and to realize sort of what people call red pilled,

47:53.200 --> 47:55.280
 is to see that they're,

47:55.280 --> 47:57.800
 maybe the thing I've been told all my life is not true.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.000
 And at every level,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.680
 it's a thing very difficult to do in North Korea.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.040
 The more authoritarian the regime,

48:04.040 --> 48:06.440
 the more difficult it is to see.

48:06.440 --> 48:09.440
 Maybe this idea that I believe

48:09.440 --> 48:11.520
 that I was willing to die for is actually evil.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.240
 It's very difficult to do for Americans,

48:14.240 --> 48:17.000
 for Russians, for Ukrainians, for Chinese,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.520
 for Indians, for Pakistanis, for everybody.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.280
 I think thinking about this Ukrainian,

48:23.280 --> 48:24.480
 whether you want to call it nobility

48:24.480 --> 48:27.440
 or in transigence or whatever is key.

48:27.440 --> 48:32.240
 I think the authoritarianness of Russia

48:32.240 --> 48:34.480
 and Putin's control or the control of his cabal

48:34.480 --> 48:37.320
 is the other thing I would really point to

48:37.320 --> 48:38.440
 is what's going on here.

48:38.440 --> 48:41.240
 And if you ask me like big picture,

48:41.240 --> 48:42.720
 what do I think is the fundamental cause

48:42.720 --> 48:43.840
 of most violence in the world?

48:43.840 --> 48:45.560
 I think it's unaccountable power.

48:45.560 --> 48:46.960
 I think, in fact, for me,

48:46.960 --> 48:49.280
 an unaccountable power is the source of underdevelopment.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.800
 It's the source of pain and suffering.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.960
 It's the source of warfare.

48:53.960 --> 48:57.200
 It's basically the root source of most of our problems.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.640
 And in this particular case,

48:59.640 --> 49:01.120
 it's also one of our buckets

49:01.120 --> 49:04.280
 in the sense that like why, what is it

49:04.280 --> 49:07.160
 that why did Russia ask these things?

49:07.160 --> 49:11.800
 Like, well, it was democracy in Ukraine

49:11.800 --> 49:13.640
 a threat to an average Russian?

49:13.640 --> 49:17.640
 No, was capitalism, is NATO, is whatever,

49:17.640 --> 49:19.600
 is this a threat to average Russians?

49:19.600 --> 49:23.360
 No, it's a threat to the apparatus

49:23.360 --> 49:26.120
 of political control and economic control

49:26.120 --> 49:29.400
 that Putin and Kronys and this sort of group of people

49:29.400 --> 49:34.400
 that rule this elite in Russia, it was a threat to them.

49:34.640 --> 49:38.320
 And so they had to ask the Ukraine to be neutral

49:38.320 --> 49:41.560
 or to give up NATO or to have a puppet government

49:41.560 --> 49:43.800
 or whatever they were seeking to achieve

49:43.800 --> 49:45.680
 and have been trying to achieve through other means

49:45.680 --> 49:47.280
 for decades, right?

49:47.280 --> 49:49.640
 They've been trying to undermine these things

49:49.640 --> 49:52.600
 without invasion.

49:52.600 --> 49:53.880
 And they've been doing that

49:53.880 --> 49:55.480
 because it threatens their interests.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.280
 And that's like one of these other logics of war.

49:57.280 --> 49:58.440
 It's not just that there's something

49:58.440 --> 49:59.280
 that I value so much

49:59.280 --> 50:00.560
 that I'm willing to injure the cost.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.800
 It's that there are people,

50:02.800 --> 50:05.080
 not only does this oligarchy

50:05.080 --> 50:07.800
 or whatever elite group that you wanna talk about in Russia,

50:07.800 --> 50:10.000
 not, first of all, they're not bearing some,

50:10.000 --> 50:11.400
 they're bearing some costs of war, right?

50:11.400 --> 50:13.200
 They're very, and they're certainly bearing costs

50:13.200 --> 50:16.680
 of sanctions, but they are,

50:16.680 --> 50:18.520
 they don't bear all the costs of war, obviously.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.240
 And so they're more, they're quick to use it.

50:20.240 --> 50:24.000
 But more importantly, like in some sense,

50:24.000 --> 50:25.600
 I think there's a strong argument

50:25.600 --> 50:28.640
 that they had a political incentive to invade

50:28.640 --> 50:31.520
 or at least to ask Ukraine this sort of impossible

50:31.520 --> 50:32.520
 to give up thing.

50:32.520 --> 50:36.080
 And then invade despite Ukrainian

50:36.080 --> 50:38.240
 nobility and transigence,

50:38.240 --> 50:39.760
 because they were threatened.

50:41.160 --> 50:45.120
 And so that's extremely important, I think.

50:45.120 --> 50:48.960
 And so that's, those two things in concert

50:48.960 --> 50:50.920
 make this a very fragile situation.

50:50.920 --> 50:52.360
 That's, I think, why we ended up

50:52.360 --> 50:57.040
 is go not all the way, but a long way to understanding.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.000
 Now you could layer on to that

50:59.000 --> 51:00.320
 these intangible incentives,

51:00.320 --> 51:03.280
 these other things that are valued on Putin's side.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.800
 Maybe there's a nationalist ideal.

51:04.800 --> 51:08.160
 Maybe he seeks status and glory.

51:08.160 --> 51:09.320
 Like maybe those things are all true,

51:09.320 --> 51:11.880
 and I'm sure they're true to an extent.

51:11.880 --> 51:14.560
 And that'll weigh against his costs of war as well.

51:14.560 --> 51:17.520
 But fundamentally, I think he just saw his regime

51:17.520 --> 51:18.560
 as threatened.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.120
 That's what he cares about.

51:20.120 --> 51:25.120
 And so he asked, he made this cruel list of demands.

51:25.520 --> 51:28.600
 I mean, I would say I'm just one human who the hell am I,

51:28.600 --> 51:30.840
 but I just have a lot of anger

51:31.920 --> 51:34.480
 towards the elites in general,

51:34.480 --> 51:38.760
 towards leaders in general that fail the people.

51:38.760 --> 51:43.760
 I would love to hear and to celebrate

51:44.040 --> 51:47.760
 the beautiful Russian people, the Ukrainian people,

51:47.760 --> 51:52.400
 and anyone who silences that beautiful voice of the people,

51:52.400 --> 51:54.000
 anyone in the world,

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
 is destroying the thing that I value most about humanity.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.040
 Leaders don't matter.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.440
 They're supposed to serve the people.

52:02.440 --> 52:07.040
 This nationalist idea of a people, of a country,

52:07.040 --> 52:10.240
 is only makes any sense when you celebrate,

52:10.240 --> 52:15.240
 when you give people the freedom to show themselves,

52:15.240 --> 52:17.960
 to show themselves, to celebrate themselves.

52:17.960 --> 52:21.760
 And the thing I care most about is science

52:21.760 --> 52:26.760
 and the silencing of voices in the scientific community,

52:26.920 --> 52:28.860
 the silencing of voices period.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.840
 Fuck any leader that silences that human spirit.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.160
 There's something about this.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.160
 It's like, whenever I look at World War II,

52:42.160 --> 52:45.920
 whenever I look at wars, it does seem very irrational

52:45.920 --> 52:50.920
 to fight, but man, does it seem somehow deeply human

52:52.680 --> 52:54.960
 when the people stand up and fight?

52:54.960 --> 52:58.920
 There's something that, if, you know,

52:58.920 --> 53:00.800
 we talked about progress,

53:00.800 --> 53:03.920
 that feels like how progress is made,

53:03.920 --> 53:05.320
 the people that stand and fight.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.280
 So let me read the Churchill speech.

53:07.280 --> 53:12.280
 It's such, it's so proud that we humans can stand up

53:13.200 --> 53:14.920
 to evil when the time is right.

53:14.920 --> 53:16.720
 I guess here's the thing though,

53:16.720 --> 53:18.520
 think of what's happening in Xinjiang and China.

53:18.520 --> 53:21.560
 We have appeased China.

53:21.560 --> 53:26.000
 We've basically said you can just do really, really,

53:26.000 --> 53:27.920
 really horrible things in this region.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.680
 And we're, you're too powerful for us

53:29.680 --> 53:32.080
 to do anything about it and it's not worth it.

53:32.080 --> 53:35.800
 And there's nobody standing up and making a Churchill speech

53:35.800 --> 53:38.960
 or the Braveheart speech about standing up for people

53:38.960 --> 53:43.360
 of Xinjiang when what's happening is on, you know,

53:43.360 --> 53:47.520
 in that realm of what was happening in Europe.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.240
 And that's happening in a lot of places.

53:50.240 --> 53:53.680
 And then when we, when there is a willingness to stand up,

53:55.560 --> 53:58.960
 people, there's a lot of opposition to those, you know,

53:58.960 --> 54:01.760
 so there were a lot of reasons for the invasion of Iraq.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.360
 For some, it was humanitarian thing,

54:04.360 --> 54:08.480
 like Saddam Hussein was one of the worst tyrants

54:08.480 --> 54:10.600
 of the 20th century.

54:10.600 --> 54:14.240
 He was just doing some really horrible things.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.880
 You know, he'd invaded Kuwait.

54:15.880 --> 54:18.680
 He'd, you know, committed domestic,

54:18.680 --> 54:21.880
 attempted domestic genocide and all sorts of repression.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.000
 And it was probably a mistake to invade in spite.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.360
 So it's important not just to select on the cases

54:27.360 --> 54:29.640
 where we stood up and to select on the cases

54:29.640 --> 54:34.640
 where that ended up working out in the sense of victory, right?

54:35.760 --> 54:39.000
 It's important to sort of try to judge, not judge,

54:39.000 --> 54:40.720
 but just try to understand these things

54:40.720 --> 54:45.160
 in the context of all the times we didn't give that speech

54:45.160 --> 54:48.080
 or when we did and then it just went sideways.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.560
 Well, that's why it's powerful

54:50.560 --> 54:52.880
 when you're willing to give your life for your principles

54:52.880 --> 54:57.480
 because most of the time you get neither the principles

54:57.480 --> 55:02.320
 nor the life, you die, but that's why it's powerful.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.560
 We shall go on to the end.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.360
 We shall fight in France.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.840
 We shall fight on the seas and the oceans.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.800
 We shall fight with growing confidence

55:10.800 --> 55:12.600
 and growing strength in the air.

55:12.600 --> 55:16.160
 We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.000
 We shall fight on the beaches.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.320
 We shall fight on the landing grounds.

55:20.320 --> 55:23.480
 We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.320
 We shall fight in the hills.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.200
 We shall never surrender.

55:27.200 --> 55:32.200
 This is before Hitler had any major loss to anybody.

55:33.040 --> 55:36.240
 That was a terrifying armada coming your way.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.880
 We shall never surrender.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.320
 I just want to give props.

55:40.320 --> 55:44.680
 I want to give my respect as a human being to Churchill,

55:44.680 --> 55:46.720
 to the British people for standing up,

55:48.120 --> 55:50.320
 to the Ukrainian people for standing up,

55:51.120 --> 55:53.920
 and to the Russian people.

55:53.920 --> 55:57.680
 These are great people that throughout history

55:57.680 --> 55:59.720
 have stood up to evil.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.640
 Let me ask you this, because you quote Sun Tzu

56:03.640 --> 56:05.440
 in the art of war.

56:05.440 --> 56:07.840
 There's no instance of a country having benefited

56:07.840 --> 56:09.480
 from prolonged warfare.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.840
 This is the main thesis.

56:12.840 --> 56:14.840
 Can we just linger on this?

56:14.840 --> 56:18.320
 Since leaders wage war and people pay the price,

56:18.320 --> 56:22.720
 when we say that there's no reason to do prolonged war,

56:22.720 --> 56:25.080
 is it possible to have a reason for the leaders

56:25.080 --> 56:27.000
 if they disregard the price?

56:30.120 --> 56:32.080
 If they have a different objective function

56:32.080 --> 56:34.080
 or utility function that measures the price

56:34.080 --> 56:37.920
 that's paid for war, is that one explanation

56:37.920 --> 56:39.560
 of why war happens?

56:39.560 --> 56:41.520
 Is the leaders just have a different calculus

56:41.520 --> 56:43.120
 than other humans?

56:43.120 --> 56:44.320
 I mean, I think this links us back

56:44.320 --> 56:46.360
 to what we were talking about earlier about just war.

56:46.360 --> 56:49.640
 Is in some sense, just war is saying

56:49.640 --> 56:54.640
 that in spite of the costs, our enemy has done something.

56:54.800 --> 56:58.120
 Our opponent has refused to compromise

56:58.120 --> 57:00.600
 on something that we find essential,

57:00.600 --> 57:03.360
 and is demanding that we compromise

57:03.360 --> 57:05.480
 in a way that's completely repugnant.

57:06.640 --> 57:09.280
 And therefore, we're going to go to war

57:09.280 --> 57:13.440
 despite these material costs and these human costs.

57:13.440 --> 57:17.800
 So that, and then that principle that you go to war on

57:17.800 --> 57:18.880
 is in the eye of the holder.

57:18.880 --> 57:22.040
 And I mean, I think liberty and sovereignty,

57:22.040 --> 57:23.800
 I think we can understand and sympathize with,

57:23.800 --> 57:25.520
 and maybe that's just a universe,

57:25.520 --> 57:27.560
 maybe that's the greatest cause of just war,

57:27.560 --> 57:30.840
 but other people make that could go to war

57:30.840 --> 57:32.160
 for something considerably less,

57:32.160 --> 57:34.640
 a principle that's considerably less noble, right?

57:34.640 --> 57:36.200
 Which is what Hitler was doing.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.400
 That's an explanation.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.760
 So that's a whole class of explanations

57:41.760 --> 57:44.000
 that helps us understand that the compromise

57:44.000 --> 57:46.320
 that was on the table, given the relative balance of power,

57:46.320 --> 57:48.520
 was just repugnant at least to one side,

57:48.520 --> 57:50.240
 if not that there's something they're unwilling to part with.

57:50.240 --> 57:53.240
 That's, and then you get to the leaders.

57:53.240 --> 57:56.280
 Well, what happens when what the leaders want,

57:57.440 --> 57:59.000
 what happens when the leaders are detached

57:59.000 --> 58:00.200
 from the interests of their groups,

58:00.200 --> 58:02.320
 which has been true for basically most of human history.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.600
 There's a narrow slice of societies

58:04.600 --> 58:06.560
 in the big scheme of things

58:06.560 --> 58:07.960
 that have been accountable to their people.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.400
 A lot of them exist today,

58:11.720 --> 58:12.680
 where to some degree,

58:12.680 --> 58:15.520
 they're channeling the interests of their group, right?

58:15.520 --> 58:18.920
 So the Ukrainian politicians didn't concede

58:18.920 --> 58:21.040
 to these cool Russian demands,

58:21.040 --> 58:22.120
 because even if they had,

58:22.120 --> 58:23.440
 it would have been political suicide,

58:23.440 --> 58:25.320
 because it seemed, or I think I don't,

58:25.320 --> 58:28.200
 it seems that the Ukrainians would have just rejected this.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.360
 So they were in some sense channeling

58:30.360 --> 58:33.160
 the values of the broader population,

58:33.160 --> 58:35.200
 even if they, I don't know what was going on,

58:35.200 --> 58:38.280
 even if they didn't share those principles,

58:38.280 --> 58:40.920
 they self interestedly followed them.

58:40.920 --> 58:41.880
 Probably they shared them,

58:41.880 --> 58:44.120
 but I'm just saying that even if they didn't,

58:44.120 --> 58:45.520
 they wouldn't compromise.

58:46.600 --> 58:47.720
 Occasionally get the reverse,

58:47.720 --> 58:50.320
 which is where the leaders are not accountable.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.160
 And now they have some value, which could be glory.

58:55.200 --> 58:56.680
 I mean, this is the story of the kings

58:56.680 --> 58:59.200
 and to some lesser extent, the queens of Europe

58:59.200 --> 59:00.400
 for hundreds of years,

59:00.400 --> 59:02.240
 was it was basically a contest

59:02.240 --> 59:04.200
 and it was the, more was the sport of kings.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.200
 And to some extent,

59:05.200 --> 59:08.600
 they were just seeking status through violent competition.

59:08.600 --> 59:11.520
 And they paid a lot, a big price out of the royal purse,

59:11.520 --> 59:15.400
 but they didn't pay most of the suffering.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.800
 And so they were too quick to go to war.

59:19.800 --> 59:24.800
 And so that's, I think that detachment of leaders,

59:26.480 --> 59:29.200
 combined with, you know, you mingle it with this,

59:29.200 --> 59:32.240
 that one bucket, that uncheckedness,

59:32.240 --> 59:33.520
 and you mingle that with the fact

59:33.520 --> 59:36.120
 that leaders might have one of these values,

59:36.120 --> 59:39.160
 noble or otherwise, that carry them to war,

59:39.160 --> 59:43.560
 combined to explain a good number of conflicts as well.

59:43.560 --> 59:44.760
 And that's a good illustration

59:44.760 --> 59:49.760
 of why I think like autocracy and unaccountable power

59:49.800 --> 59:53.360
 is I could make that story for all of the things,

59:53.360 --> 59:54.840
 all five buckets, they're all,

59:54.840 --> 59:56.960
 we're all more susceptible to these things,

59:56.960 --> 59:58.080
 to all five of these things

59:58.080 --> 1:00:01.640
 when leaders are not accountable to the people

1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:02.680
 and their group.

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:05.920
 And that's what makes it like the meta,

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:10.120
 for me, the meta cause of conflict in all of human history

1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:11.200
 and sadly today.

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:16.280
 Does the will to power play into this, the desire for power?

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:20.520
 Like that's a human thing again in the calculation

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.720
 that shall we put that in the misperceptions bucket?

1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:27.800
 Or is it, is misperceptions essentially

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:31.080
 about interaction between humans

1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:35.240
 and power is more about the thing you feel in your heart

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:37.880
 when you're alone as a leader?

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.480
 You know, I said there were three strategic reasons

1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:41.600
 like the unchecked leaders,

1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:43.200
 the commitment problems, uncertainty.

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:45.320
 There are two sort of more psychological

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.440
 and I called them intangible incentives and misperceptions.

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:48.720
 The way that like a game theorist

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:50.800
 or the way that behavioral economists would think

1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:53.920
 about those two was just to say preferences.

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:57.360
 And then erroneous beliefs and mistakes is like,

1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:00.280
 so the preferences are our preferences, right?

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:03.000
 And so utility functions, whatever we want to call it,

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.720
 like there's not, that's why I wouldn't call them

1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:07.640
 a misperception or rationality.

1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:09.720
 We want, we like what we like.

1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:12.800
 If we like power, if we like relative status,

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:17.800
 if we like, if we like our racial purity,

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.240
 if we like our liberty, if we like whatever it is

1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:23.000
 that we have convinced ourselves we value.

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.560
 Maybe you fell in love with the rival queen, a king.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:26.400
 Exactly.

1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:29.320
 When I said it was a big bucket full of stuff that rhymes,

1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:31.440
 like that's a pretty messy bucket.

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.080
 Like there's a lot of different stuff in there.

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.520
 And I'm just trying to say like, let's be clear

1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:40.000
 that just about the shared logic of these things

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.840
 is maybe just, you know, they're really dissimilar,

1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:44.160
 but let's be clear about the shared logic.

1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:46.760
 And if it were true that deep down

1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:49.080
 we were aggressive people who just liked violence

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:52.640
 and enjoyed the blood or some percentage of us do,

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:53.800
 that would be there too.

1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:58.120
 And so I just want to say that's,

1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:02.480
 but you know, we're really quick to recognize those, right?

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:05.560
 When we diagnose a war as an armchair analyst

1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:09.640
 or as a journalist or something, we really jump to those.

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:13.160
 We don't need a lot of help to like see those happening.

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:17.080
 So we probably put a little bit too much emphasis on them.

1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:19.360
 It's maybe the only thing that I would caution

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:21.000
 because the others are more subtle

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.920
 and they're often there and they contribute.

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:28.080
 So just to link on something you said before,

1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:31.680
 would it be accurate to say when the leaders become detached

1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:35.760
 from the opinion of the people,

1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:38.720
 is that's more likely to lead to war?

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:40.080
 So.

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:43.320
 And mechanically, it's just they're gonna bear fewer costs.

1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:47.400
 So it's gonna basically narrow the set of deals

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:50.320
 that they're gonna be willing to accept instead of violence.

1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:53.880
 At the same time, most of the time it's not enough

1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:56.360
 because the leaders still bear a lot of costs of war.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:59.000
 You could be deposed, you could be killed,

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.720
 you could be tried, and the public purse

1:03:01.720 --> 1:03:02.560
 is going to be empty.

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:04.560
 I mean, that's like the one story throughout history

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:06.000
 is that at the end of the day,

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.680
 your regime is broke as a result of war.

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.320
 And so you still internalize that a little bit.

1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:16.480
 If I had to say like, you know, in my three buckets

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:17.560
 or through my buckets so far,

1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:20.880
 I sort of started with like Ukrainian and Transigence.

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:22.760
 And then I jumped and then I said the essential,

1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:25.320
 then you really have to understand Russian autocracy

1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:29.320
 just to understand why they would ask something so cool.

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.400
 But I mean, I think the uncertainty

1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.120
 is really important here as well.

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.800
 Like if you think of it, like think of all of the things,

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.400
 the way this has played out,

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:41.800
 and just in some ways how many ways we've been surprised.

1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:44.280
 We've been surprised by the unity

1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:46.600
 and the coherence of the West and the sanctions.

1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:48.560
 That sort of, what's happened is it was

1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:49.760
 in the realm of possibility,

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:51.760
 but it was sort of like the best case scenario

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.840
 from the perspective of the West

1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:56.120
 and the worst case scenario for the Russians.

1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.160
 The second thing is just the pluckiness

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:01.600
 and the effectiveness and the intransigence

1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:03.960
 and the nobility of this Ukrainian resistance.

1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:06.920
 That's again, was within the realm of possibility,

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:09.040
 but wasn't necessarily the likely thing, right?

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:11.480
 It was again, maybe the worst realization for Russia,

1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:14.400
 the best realization in some sense for,

1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:16.800
 in terms of revealed strength and resolve.

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:20.240
 And then the other thing that's been revealed

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:24.200
 is just how, like the corruption and ineptitude

1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:26.760
 and problems on the Russian military side.

1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:28.920
 Again, within the realm of possibility,

1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:30.760
 maybe people who really knew the Russian military

1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:32.600
 are less surprised than the rest of us,

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:36.520
 but also one of the worst possible draws to Russia.

1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:41.400
 And so, Putin asking this terrible price

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:45.080
 and expecting Ukraine to roll over,

1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:47.440
 or the West to roll over at least to a degree,

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:52.440
 was based on like a different set of probability.

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.000
 It was based on just expecting something

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.760
 in the middle of the probability distribution

1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:59.160
 and not all these different tail events.

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:00.920
 And so the fact that the world's so uncertain

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:02.120
 and the fact that Putin can come

1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:04.200
 with a different set of expectations

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:05.720
 than the Ukrainians and the West

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:10.000
 and all these players can just have a hard time agreeing

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:11.720
 on just what the facts are,

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:12.960
 because we live in an uncertain world.

1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:14.760
 Everyone's quick to say, oh, we miscalculated.

1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:17.080
 Well, I'm not, I don't know if you miscalculated.

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.800
 I think he just, he got a really bad draw

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:23.280
 on in terms of what the realized outcomes are here.

1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:27.240
 And so, I mean, good for everybody else in some sense,

1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:29.600
 except the fact that it's involving a lot of violence

1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:30.440
 is the tragedy.

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:32.680
 Well, there's also economic pain,

1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:35.160
 not just for the Russian people and the Ukrainian people,

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:37.280
 but for the whole world.

1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:42.280
 So, you could talk about things that we are surprised

1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:46.280
 from an analysis perspective of small victories here or there,

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:48.280
 but I think it's universally true

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:52.280
 that everybody loses once again in this war.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:55.480
 Right, and so the question is just like, when does it,

1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:57.680
 why did Russia choose to invade

1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.280
 when Ukraine didn't give this up?

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:02.280
 Well, Russia anticipated that it would be able to seize

1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:07.280
 what it wanted, the available bargain that it deserved

1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:09.280
 quote unquote, based on its power.

1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:12.280
 In the world, it wasn't getting.

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:14.280
 And so, it thought it could take that.

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:17.280
 And the uncertainty around that made it potentially

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:19.280
 more likely that he would choose to do this.

1:06:19.280 --> 1:06:22.280
 But in particular, one of the other things that I think

1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:24.280
 is probably less important in this context,

1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:28.280
 but still plays a role, but less important than many wars,

1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:31.280
 is the fact that it's really hard to resolve that uncertainty.

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:34.280
 Right, in theory, Ukraine should be able to say,

1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:39.280
 look, this is exactly how resolved we are, we're super resolved.

1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:42.280
 And your military is not as strong as you think it is.

1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:44.280
 You mean before the conflict begins?

1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:45.280
 Before the conflict begins.

1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:46.280
 Everybody should be like, you know what?

1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:47.280
 You lay on the table, here's my cards.

1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:48.280
 No one wants, yeah.

1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:49.280
 Here's your cards.

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:52.280
 Exactly, like that's, as a competitor in this,

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.280
 you can use that uncertainty or to your advantage.

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.280
 I can try to convince you, I can bluff.

1:06:56.280 --> 1:06:57.280
 Yeah.

1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:59.280
 Right, and so anyone who's ever played poker

1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:01.280
 and bluffed or called a bluff,

1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:04.280
 that's the analogy in some ways toward,

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:05.280
 it's not the perfect analogy.

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:07.280
 But the uncertainty in the circumstance,

1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:08.280
 you don't have to miscalculate.

1:07:08.280 --> 1:07:11.280
 The fact that if you bluff and lose,

1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:13.280
 it wasn't that you miscalculated,

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.280
 you made an optimal choice,

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.280
 given the uncertainty of the situation to take a gamble.

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:19.280
 And that was a wiser thing for you to do

1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:21.280
 than to not bluff.

1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:25.280
 And just to fold or to just not pay in that round.

1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:27.280
 And so the uncertainty of the situation

1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:32.280
 gives both sides incentives to bluff,

1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:35.280
 gives neither side an incentive to try to reveal the truth.

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:37.280
 And then at some point, the other side says,

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:39.280
 you know what, you say you're resolved.

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:40.280
 You say you're not going to,

1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:41.280
 you're going to mount an uncertainty.

1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:43.280
 Well, guess what?

1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:45.280
 Every other, you know,

1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:48.280
 people on my border has folded

1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:50.280
 and you're going to fold too,

1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:52.280
 the minute the tanks roll in

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:53.280
 and the minute the Air Force comes in,

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:56.280
 I'm gambling that you're bluffing.

1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:01.280
 And so that inherent uncertainty of the situation

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:06.280
 just causes a lot of short wars, actually,

1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:11.280
 because it's the sort of bluff and call dynamic that goes on.

1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:13.280
 And, you know, the thing that's worth thinking

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:17.280
 is we might end up at a place in a few months

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:21.280
 where the thing that Ukraine concedes

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:25.280
 is not so far from what Russia demanded in the first place.

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:28.280
 Russia's on it, I want a neutral,

1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:29.280
 I mean, who knows how,

1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:32.280
 it's not the ambitious thing the Russians wanted,

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:34.280
 but if we end up in a place

1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:37.280
 where Ukraine is effectively neutral,

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.280
 never joins NATO,

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:43.280
 is not being militarily supplied by the West

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:48.280
 and where Russia has de facto control over the East

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:50.280
 in Crimea, if not fully recognized,

1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:53.280
 probably, who knows if they'll get ever internationally

1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:55.280
 if the Ukrainian recognized,

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:58.280
 but effectively controls,

1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:02.280
 Russia will have accomplished

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:05.280
 what it asked for in the first place

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:08.280
 and both parties had to get there

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.280
 through violence rather than through negotiation.

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:14.280
 And you wouldn't need misperceptions and mistakes

1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:19.280
 and you wouldn't need Putin's delusions of glory

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:20.280
 or whatever to get there,

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:22.280
 you would just need the ingredients I've given so far,

1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:26.280
 which is like an unwillingness to do that without fighting

1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:28.280
 on the part of the Ukrainians,

1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:31.280
 an autocratic leadership in Russia

1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:32.280
 who would make those demands

1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:34.280
 because it's in their self interest

1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:38.280
 and then uncertainty leading them to fight.

1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:42.280
 And that, sadly, is like the best case,

1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:44.280
 that feels like the best case scenario right now,

1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:51.280
 which is the war's just five months and not five years.

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:53.280
 Given the current situation.

1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:55.280
 Given the current situation.

1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:58.280
 Because the suffering has already happened.

1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:02.280
 It lost homes, people moving,

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:08.280
 you know, having to see their home

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:11.280
 and rubble and millions of people,

1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:16.280
 refugees having to escape the country

1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:21.280
 and hate flourishes versus the common humanity

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:23.280
 as it does with war.

1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:26.280
 And on top of all of that,

1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:29.280
 if we talk from a geopolitical perspective,

1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:36.280
 the warmongers all over the world are sort of drooling.

1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:38.280
 They now have got narratives

1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:41.280
 and they got that whatever narratives,

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:43.280
 you can go shopping for the narratives.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:45.280
 The United States has its narratives

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:47.280
 for whatever geopolitical thing you want to do

1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:49.280
 in that part of the world.

1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:53.280
 That's another little malevolent interaction

1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:54.280
 between two of these buckets,

1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:55.280
 like those unchecked leaders

1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:58.280
 and those intangible incentives, those preferences,

1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:02.280
 is that unchecked leaders spend,

1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:03.280
 autocrats, whatever,

1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:05.280
 spend enormous amounts of time

1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:08.280
 trying to manipulate the values and beliefs

1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:11.280
 of their population, of their group.

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:14.280
 And now, sometimes they do it nobly,

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:16.280
 but Winston Churchill there was trying to,

1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:19.280
 it's not clear that Britons were ready to stand up.

1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:20.280
 There were a lot of Americans and a lot of Britons

1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:22.280
 who were like, you know what?

1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:24.280
 Hitler, not such a bad guy.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:25.280
 His idea is not so terrible.

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:27.280
 I never liked those Jews anyways.

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.280
 Many were thinking.

1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:30.280
 We had political leaders in the US

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:33.280
 who were basically not pro Nazi,

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.280
 but were just not anti Nazi.

1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:38.280
 And Churchill was just trying to instill

1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:40.280
 a different resolve.

1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:42.280
 He was trying to create that thing.

1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:43.280
 He was trying to create that value.

1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:45.280
 And in the American revolution it was as well.

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:47.280
 The founding fathers, the leaders of the revolution,

1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:50.280
 it's not that everybody just woke up one morning

1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:51.280
 in the United States

1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:53.280
 and had this ideology of liberty and freedom.

1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:54.280
 Some of that was true.

1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:55.280
 It was out there in the ether,

1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:58.280
 but they had to manufacture and create it.

1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:01.280
 In a way that I think they believed and was noble,

1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:03.280
 but there's a lot of manufacturing

1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:05.280
 and creation of these values and principles

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.280
 that is not noble,

1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.280
 and that is exactly what Hitler did so well.

1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:13.280
 The anti extremism was present throughout the world,

1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:17.280
 but the more subtle thing that I feel like

1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.280
 maybe more generally applicable

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.280
 is this kind of pacifism.

1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:28.280
 But I think people in the United States

1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:30.280
 felt like it's not my conflict.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.280
 Why do I need to get involved with it?

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:37.280
 And I think Churchill was fighting that.

1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:40.280
 The general apathy.

1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:47.280
 It's the apathy of rational calculus.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:51.280
 What are we going to gain if we fight back?

1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:54.280
 Hitler seems to be pretty reasonable.

1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:57.280
 He's not going to stop the bombing.

1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:01.280
 You're still going to maintain your sovereignty

1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:04.280
 as the great people of Britain.

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:06.280
 Why are we fighting again?

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:08.280
 And that's the thing that's hard to break

1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:10.280
 because you have to say,

1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:13.280
 well, you have to speak the principle.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:16.280
 You have to speak at some greater sort of

1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:19.280
 long term vision of history.

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.280
 So it's like, yes, now it may seem like

1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:25.280
 it's a way to avoid the fight,

1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:29.280
 but you're actually just sort of putting shackles on yourself.

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:33.280
 You're destroying the very greatness of our people

1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:35.280
 if we don't fight back.

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:38.280
 And to think about this with the current case with Russia,

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:41.280
 some people look at Putin's speeches

1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:45.280
 and papers he's written on Ukraine

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:47.280
 historically being a part of Russia

1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:49.280
 and trying to deny the,

1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:51.280
 basically create all these nationalist narratives

1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:53.280
 and they think, well, Putin really believes,

1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:55.280
 and he might, Putin really believes this

1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:57.280
 and that's why he's invading.

1:13:57.280 --> 1:13:59.280
 And that might also be true

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:01.280
 and that would contribute to

1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:04.280
 just make a peaceful bargain even harder to find.

1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:07.280
 But I suspect what's at least a minimum true

1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:10.280
 is Putin's trying to manufacture support

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:14.280
 for an invasion in the population through propaganda.

1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:19.280
 And so he's doing on some level

1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:21.280
 the same thing that Winston Churchill was doing

1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:23.280
 in mechanical terms,

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:26.280
 which is to try to manipulate people's references

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:31.280
 but doing it in a sinister, malevolent, evil,

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:33.280
 self serving way because it's really in his interest,

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:37.280
 whereas this was anything but, right,

1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:38.280
 in the Churchill example.

1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:41.280
 The dark human thing is like,

1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:44.280
 there's moments in World War II

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:46.280
 where Hitler's propaganda,

1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.280
 he began to believe his own propaganda.

1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:50.280
 It's like,

1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:51.280
 I think he probably always believed,

1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:53.280
 I think he was a sincere believer.

1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.280
 Well, no, no, there's,

1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:58.280
 but there's a lot of places

1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:01.280
 where there was uncertainty

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:03.280
 and they decided to do propaganda

1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:07.280
 and that propaganda resolved the uncertainty in his own mind.

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:09.280
 Like, so for example,

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:11.280
 he believed until very late

1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:15.280
 that America is a weakling militarily

1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:18.280
 as an economic power and just the spirit of the people.

1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:21.280
 And like, that was part of the propaganda they're producing

1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:23.280
 and because of that propaganda,

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:25.280
 when he became the head of the army,

1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.280
 he was making military actions.

1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:30.280
 He like, nonchalantly started war with America.

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:32.280
 Well, the United States of America,

1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:34.280
 where he didn't need to at all.

1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:36.280
 He could have avoided that completely,

1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:38.280
 but he thought, eh, whatever,

1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:39.280
 they're easy.

1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:42.280
 So that's, I think that propaganda first believes second

1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:46.280
 and I think as a human being, as a dictator,

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:48.280
 when you start to believe the lies

1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:51.280
 with which you're controlling the populace,

1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:54.280
 you become detached from this person

1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:58.280
 that's able to resolve in a very human way

1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.280
 the conflict in the world.

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:02.280
 I mean, when I said the meta,

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:04.280
 the big common factor that causes war

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.280
 and over and over and over again is unaccountable power.

1:16:06.280 --> 1:16:08.280
 It's not just because it's mechanically,

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.280
 like one of my five explanations is saying,

1:16:10.280 --> 1:16:12.280
 well, if you're unaccountable, you don't bear the cost of war.

1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:14.280
 You might have private incentives.

1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:16.280
 So yes, bargains are harder to find,

1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:18.280
 but it leads to all these nasty interactions.

1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:20.280
 So earlier I said there's this interaction

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:22.280
 between the values and the unchecked leaders

1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:25.280
 because those idiosyncratic values of your leader

1:16:25.280 --> 1:16:27.280
 become more important when they're unchecked.

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:30.280
 But the uncertainty point you just made is like a deep point.

1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:34.280
 It's to say actually that like the fundamental problem

1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:37.280
 that all autocrats have is an information problem

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:40.280
 because nobody wants to give them the right information.

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:44.280
 And they have very few ways to aggregate information

1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:46.280
 if they're not popular, right?

1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:49.280
 And so there's a whole cottage industry of political science

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:54.280
 sort of talking about why autocrats love fixed elections

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:57.280
 and why they love Twitter and why they actually like it

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:58.280
 in the controlled ways.

1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:00.280
 It solves an information problem.

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:01.280
 Like that's your cru...

1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:04.280
 If you're like Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin,

1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:06.280
 you need to solve an information problem

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:08.280
 just to avoid having a rebellion on your hands

1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:11.280
 in your own country every day because uncertainty

1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:14.280
 kind of gets magnified and you get all this distorted information

1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:16.280
 in this apparatus of control.

1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:18.280
 And so that's like another nasty interaction

1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:22.280
 between uncertainty and unchecked leaders

1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:25.280
 is you end up in this situation

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.280
 where you're getting bad information

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:28.280
 and it's not that you don't...

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:30.280
 You believe your own lies.

1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:31.280
 It's just that you never...

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:32.280
 You sort of believe...

1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:35.280
 You're sort of averaging what you believe

1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:36.280
 over the available information

1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:39.280
 and you don't realize that it's such a distorted

1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:42.280
 and biased information source.

1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:45.280
 One of the other things about this time,

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:47.280
 that was a surprise to me,

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:50.280
 in the fog of uncertainty,

1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:59.280
 how sort of seemingly likely nuclear war became.

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:02.280
 Not likely, but how it...

1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:03.280
 Less unlikely than before.

1:18:03.280 --> 1:18:04.280
 Exactly.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:05.280
 That's a better way to say it.

1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:09.280
 It started to take a random stroll away

1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:11.280
 from zero percent probability

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:14.280
 into this kind of land of maybe like...

1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:16.280
 It's hard to know, but it's like,

1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:19.280
 oh, wow, we're actually normally talking about this

1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:21.280
 as if this is part of the calculus,

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.280
 part of the options.

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:24.280
 But before we talk about nuclear war,

1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:27.280
 because I'm going to need a drink,

1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:28.280
 do you need to go to the bathroom?

1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:30.280
 Sure, I'll take a break.

1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.280
 So back to nuclear war.

1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:34.280
 What do you think about this,

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:38.280
 that people were nonchalantly speaking about nuclear wars

1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:41.280
 if it doesn't lead to the potential annihilation

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:45.280
 of the human species?

1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:47.280
 What are the chances that our world

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:50.280
 sends it to nuclear war within your framework?

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:52.280
 You wore many hats.

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:57.280
 One is sort of the...

1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:59.280
 Analyst, right?

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.280
 And then one is a human.

1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:02.280
 What do you think are the chances

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.280
 we get to see nuclear war in the century?

1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:06.280
 Well, you know, the doomsday,

1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:09.280
 the official doomsday clock for nuclear warfare

1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:11.280
 sits in the lobby of my building.

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:12.280
 The bulletin of atomic scientists

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.280
 sort of shares a building with us.

1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:16.280
 So it's always there every day.

1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:18.280
 Can you describe what the doomsday clock is?

1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:20.280
 The bulletin of atomic scientists.

1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:22.280
 It's something that this group of physicists

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:23.280
 sort of said to sort of mark

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:25.280
 just how close we are to nuclear catastrophe,

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:27.280
 and they started it decades ago.

1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:28.280
 And it's a clock,

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:30.280
 and it's sort of how close are we to midnight,

1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:32.280
 where midnight is nuclear armageddon

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:34.280
 or the destruction of humanity.

1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:35.280
 And it's been sitting...

1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:36.280
 I mean, it's actually...

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:38.280
 It hasn't moved as close to...

1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:42.280
 It hasn't moved as close to midnight

1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:44.280
 in the last few weeks as it probably should have,

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:47.280
 because it was already so close.

1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:49.280
 There's actually limited room for it to move

1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:50.280
 for a bunch of other reasons.

1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:51.280
 I think it's...

1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:52.280
 There's a whole political thing that once...

1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:53.280
 It's really hard.

1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:55.280
 It's really easy to move it closer.

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:57.280
 And it's really hard if you're the person

1:19:57.280 --> 1:19:59.280
 in charge of that clock to move it away,

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:01.280
 because that's always very controversial.

1:20:01.280 --> 1:20:02.280
 So it always sits there,

1:20:02.280 --> 1:20:04.280
 but it forces you to think about it

1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:07.280
 a little bit every day.

1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:12.280
 And I admit I was nonchalant about it

1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:17.280
 until recently in a way that many other people were.

1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:20.280
 I still think the risk is very low,

1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:24.280
 but kind of for the reasons we've talked to,

1:20:24.280 --> 1:20:27.280
 it's just so unimaginably costly

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.280
 that nobody wants to go that route.

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:33.280
 So it's like the extreme version of my whole argument

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:35.280
 was why we most of the time don't fight

1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:37.280
 is because it's just so damn costly.

1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:38.280
 And so this is...

1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:40.280
 That's the incentive not to use this.

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:42.280
 And if they do use it,

1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:46.280
 that's the incentive to use it in a very restrained way.

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:48.280
 But that's not a lot of...

1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:50.280
 But because we know we do go to war

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:52.280
 and there's all these things that interfere with it,

1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:55.280
 including miscalculation and all of these human foibles.

1:20:55.280 --> 1:20:58.280
 And several of those nuclear powers

1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:00.280
 are not accountable leaders.

1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:02.280
 I think we have to be a lot more worried

1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:04.280
 than many of us were very recently.

1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:05.280
 I pointed out earlier,

1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:07.280
 the whole reason we're in this mess is

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:09.280
 because the only people who have this private interest

1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:11.280
 in having Ukraine give up its freedom

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:17.280
 is this Russian cabal and elite that gets their power

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:22.280
 and is preserved and is threatened by Ukrainian democracy.

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:26.280
 How far would they go to hang onto power

1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:28.280
 when push came to shove

1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:32.280
 is I think the thing that worries me the most

1:21:32.280 --> 1:21:34.280
 and is plainly what worries most people

1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:36.280
 about the risk of nuclear war.

1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:39.280
 I think at what point does that unchecked leadership

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:41.280
 decide that this is worth it,

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:46.280
 especially if they can emerge from the rubble still on top?

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:48.280
 I don't know.

1:21:48.280 --> 1:21:51.280
 And I don't know that any of us

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:54.280
 have really fully thought through all of that calculus

1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:56.280
 and what's going on.

1:21:56.280 --> 1:21:58.280
 Very recently, around the anniversary of January 6th,

1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:00.280
 there were a lot of questions about,

1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:02.280
 was the United States going to have another civil war?

1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:05.280
 On the one hand, I think it's almost unimaginable.

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:08.280
 Sort of like in the same way I think that a nuclear war

1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:11.280
 and complete Armageddon is unimaginable.

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:15.280
 But I remember something that...

1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:17.280
 When both of those questions get asked,

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:20.280
 I remember something I was in the audience

1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:23.280
 of listening to some great economists speak about

1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:26.280
 20 years ago about the risk of an Argentina style

1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:28.280
 financial meltdown of the United States.

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:30.280
 What's the total financial collapse?

1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:34.280
 And they said, you know what, the risk is vanishingly small.

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:38.280
 But that's terrifying because until recently,

1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:40.280
 the answer was zero.

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:42.280
 And so the fact that it's not zero

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:44.280
 should deeply, deeply scare us all.

1:22:44.280 --> 1:22:48.280
 And we should devote a lot of energy to making it zero again.

1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:50.280
 And that's how I feel about the risk of a civil war in the US.

1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:53.280
 And that's how I feel about the risk of nuclear war.

1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:55.280
 It's higher than it used to be,

1:22:55.280 --> 1:22:57.280
 and that should terrify us all.

1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:59.280
 To me what terrifies me is that all this kind of stuff

1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:03.280
 seems to happen overnight, like super quick

1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:06.280
 and it escalates super quick when it happens.

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:09.280
 So it's not like...

1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:11.280
 I don't know what I imagined,

1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:15.280
 but it just happens like if a nuclear war happened,

1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:19.280
 it would be something like a plane,

1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:21.280
 like in this case with Ukraine,

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:27.280
 a NATO plane shut down over some piece of land

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:29.280
 by the Russian forces,

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:31.280
 or so the narrative would go,

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:33.280
 but it doesn't even matter what's true or not

1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:38.280
 in order to spark the first moment of escalation.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:40.280
 And then it just goes, goes, goes.

1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:42.280
 Well, I think that happens sometimes.

1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:45.280
 I mean, again, it's this thing that, you know,

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:48.280
 social scientists call it selection on the dependent variable.

1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:50.280
 There's all these times when that didn't happen,

1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:54.280
 when it escalated one step and then people paused,

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.280
 or escalated two steps and people said,

1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:58.280
 whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:01.280
 And so we remember the times when it went boom, boom, boom,

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:02.280
 boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:04.280
 and then the really terrible thing happened.

1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:06.280
 But that, fortunately, that's not, you know,

1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:08.280
 I start off the book with an example of a gang war

1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:10.280
 that didn't happen in Medellin, Colombia,

1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:13.280
 which is my day job is actually studying conflict

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:17.280
 and gangs and violence of these other kinds of groups,

1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:19.280
 also very sinister.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:23.280
 And most of the time they don't fight

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:25.280
 and that escalation doesn't happen.

1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:27.280
 So the escalation does happen quickly sometimes,

1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:29.280
 except when it doesn't.

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:31.280
 So we remember the ones when it does.

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:33.280
 It's really important to think about all that.

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:39.280
 I remember talking to, I think Elon Musk on his podcast,

1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:44.280
 I was sort of like talking about the horrors of war and so on.

1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:49.280
 And then he said, well, you know, like most of human history,

1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:53.280
 because I think I said like most of human history is,

1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:58.280
 had been defined by these horrible wars.

1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:01.280
 He's like, no, most of human history is just peaceful,

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:03.280
 like farming life.

1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:06.280
 Like war, we kind of remember the wars,

1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:09.280
 but most of human history is, you know, is life.

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:14.280
 Yeah, and most of the competition between nations was like blood,

1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.280
 I would say blood thirsty without drinking that blood

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:22.280
 in the sense that it was intense, it would loathe some.

1:25:22.280 --> 1:25:26.280
 And so a lot of the rivalry and a lot of the competition,

1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:30.280
 which is also can be problematic in its own ways, is not violent.

1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:36.280
 And most of human history is about the oppression of the majority by a few.

1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:40.280
 And their moments when they rise up and revolt,

1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:42.280
 and there's a revolution, we remember those,

1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:44.280
 but most of the time they don't.

1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:49.280
 And the story of political change and transformation and freedom

1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:51.280
 is there's a few revolutions that are violent,

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:54.280
 but most of it is actually revolutions

1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:57.280
 without that kind of violent revolt.

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:01.280
 Most of it is just the peaceful concession of power by elites

1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:03.280
 to a wider and wider group of people

1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:06.280
 in response to their increased economic bargaining power,

1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:08.280
 their threat that they're going to march.

1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:12.280
 So even if we want to understand something like the march of freedom

1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:16.280
 over human history, I think we can draw this same insight

1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:20.280
 that actually we don't, most of the time we don't fight,

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:23.280
 we actually concede power.

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:27.280
 No, you don't, the elite doesn't sort of give power to the masses right away.

1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:31.280
 They just coopt the few merchants who could threaten the whole thing

1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:33.280
 and bring them into the circle.

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:36.280
 And then the circle gets a little bit wider and a little bit wider

1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:38.280
 until the circle is ever wide,

1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:41.280
 and maybe not ever, but in clumpuses most, if not all.

1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:46.280
 And that's like a hopeful and optimistic trend.

1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:50.280
 Yeah, if you look at the plot, if you guys could pull it up of the war throughout history,

1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:55.280
 so the rate of war throughout history does seem to be decreasing significantly

1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:00.280
 with a few spikes, and the sort of the expansion,

1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:04.280
 it's like half the world is under authoritarian regimes,

1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:07.280
 but that's been shrinking and shrinking and shrinking.

1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:12.280
 Stephen Pinker's one person, one famous scholar who brings up this hypothesis.

1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:15.280
 I mean, there's sort of two ways, there's actually two separate kinds of violence

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:17.280
 that one where I think he's completely right,

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:20.280
 and one where I think we're not sure, probably maybe not.

1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:23.280
 Where he's completely right, it's sort of interpersonal violence,

1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:27.280
 homicides, everyday violence has been going down, down, down, down, down, down.

1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:32.280
 That's just unambiguously, and it's mostly because we've created cultures and states

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:35.280
 and rules and things that control that violence.

1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:40.280
 Now, the warfare between groups is that less frequent.

1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:44.280
 Well, you know, it's not clear that he's right, that there's fewer wars.

1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:50.280
 You might say that wars are more rare because they're more costly,

1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:52.280
 because our weapons are so brutal.

1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:56.280
 The cost of war go up, as the cost of war go up, not entirely,

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:59.280
 but for the most part, that gives us an incentive not to have them.

1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:03.280
 But then when they do happen, they're doozies.

1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:05.280
 So, is Pinker right?

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:08.280
 I hope he's right, but I don't think that officially that trend is there.

1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:16.280
 I think that we might have the same kind of levels of intergroup violence

1:28:16.280 --> 1:28:22.280
 because maybe those five fundamentals that lead to war have not fundamentally changed

1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:27.280
 and thus made us, given us a more peaceful world now than a couple hundred years ago.

1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:29.280
 That's something to think about.

1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:33.280
 So, obviously, looking at his hypothesis, looking at his data, and others like him.

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:37.280
 But I have noticed one thing, which is the amount of pushback he gets.

1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.280
 That this is speaking to the general point that you made,

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:50.280
 which is like we overemphasize the anecdotal and don't look objectively at the aggregate data as much.

1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:55.280
 There's a general cynicism about the world, and I don't even mean cynicism.

1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:58.280
 It's almost like cynicism porn or something like that,

1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:03.280
 where people just get, for some reason, they get a little bit excited

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:09.280
 to talk about the destruction of human civilization in a weird way.

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:12.280
 They don't really mean it, I think.

1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:17.280
 If I were to psychoanalyze their geopolitical analysis,

1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:26.280
 I think it's a kind of, I don't know, maybe relieves the mind to think about death at a global scale somehow,

1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:30.280
 and then you can go have lunch with your kids afterwards and feel a little better about the world.

1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:33.280
 I don't know what it is, but it's not very scientific.

1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:36.280
 It's very kind of personal, emotional.

1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:40.280
 So we should be careful to look at the world in that way,

1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:45.280
 because if you look broadly, there is just like you highlight,

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:50.280
 there's a will for peace among people.

1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:52.280
 You mentioned Medellin.

1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:54.280
 By the way, how do you pronounce it, Medellin or Medellin?

1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:55.280
 Both are fine.

1:29:55.280 --> 1:30:01.280
 I think there they say Medellin, because that's kind of the accent on the double L.

1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:05.280
 But Medellin would be totally fine as well.

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:11.280
 What lessons do you draw from the Medellin cartel, from the different gang wars in Colombia, Medellin?

1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:16.280
 What's the economics of peace and war between drug cartels?

1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:18.280
 Here's what was really insightful for me.

1:30:18.280 --> 1:30:24.280
 So I live in Chicago, and people are aware that there's a violence problem in Chicago.

1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:27.280
 It's actually not the worst American city by any stretch of the imagination for shootings,

1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:29.280
 but it's pretty bad.

1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:38.280
 And Medellin has these better, much many more and probably many better organized gangs than Chicago.

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:43.280
 And yet the homicide rate is maybe half.

1:30:43.280 --> 1:30:50.280
 And now, I mean, there have been moments when these gangs go to war in the last 30 years,

1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:53.280
 when Medellin has become the most violent place on the planet.

1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:55.280
 But for the most part, right now, they're peaceful.

1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:58.280
 And so what's going on there?

1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:05.280
 I mean, one thing that is there's a hierarchy of organizations, so that above these recently well organized neighborhood gangs,

1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:09.280
 there's a set of more shadowy organizations that have different names.

1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:10.280
 Some people call them razones.

1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:13.280
 Some people would call them bandas, criminalis, criminal bands.

1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:16.280
 You might just call them mafias.

1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:20.280
 And there's about 17 of them, depending on how you want to count.

1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:25.280
 And they themselves have a little operating board called,

1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:30.280
 sometimes they call it the office, La Fesina, sometimes they call it La Mesa, the table.

1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:32.280
 Well, each individual one or as a group?

1:31:32.280 --> 1:31:33.280
 As a group.

1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:34.280
 As a group.

1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:37.280
 So they meet and they don't meet personally all the time.

1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:39.280
 Sometimes they meet, but they consult.

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:42.280
 A lot of the leaders of these groups are actually in prison.

1:31:42.280 --> 1:31:44.280
 And so, and they're in the same wings in prison.

1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:45.280
 They have represented.

1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:46.280
 Oh, they meet in prison.

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:51.280
 Well, whatever, if I'm on a cell block with you, I'd be to you anyways, right?

1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:56.280
 So actually imprisoning leaders and putting them in the same cell block, but not putting them,

1:31:56.280 --> 1:31:59.280
 you know, if you get arrested here in the United States and you're a criminal leader,

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:02.280
 and you get put in a super max prison, you cannot run your criminal empire.

1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:03.280
 It's just too difficult.

1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:04.280
 It's impossible.

1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:05.280
 There, it's possible.

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:08.280
 And you might think, and they do, they still run their empire.

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:14.280
 And you might think that's a bad idea, but actually cutting off the head of a criminal organization,

1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:17.280
 leading it to a bunch, leaving it to a bunch of like hotheaded young guys who are disorganized,

1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:19.280
 is not always the path to peace.

1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:29.280
 So having these guys all in the same prison patios is actually, it reduces imperfect information and uncertainty, right?

1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:31.280
 It provides a place for them to bargain.

1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:32.280
 They can talk.

1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:34.280
 And so Laofacina is like a lot of these informal meetings.

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:41.280
 And so, you know, and they have these tools that they use to control the street gangs.

1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:48.280
 So instead of there being like 400 gangs, all sort of in this anarchic situation of competing for territory and constantly at war,

1:32:48.280 --> 1:32:54.280
 the Risones are keeping them in line and they will use sanctions.

1:32:54.280 --> 1:33:00.280
 They will, where the sanction might be, I will put a bullet in your head if you, if you don't.

1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:03.280
 It's a little more honest than the sanctions between nations.

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:04.280
 Exactly.

1:33:04.280 --> 1:33:06.280
 But they will, but they, they will sit them down.

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:08.280
 They'll, they'll provide, they'll help them negotiate.

1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:12.280
 They will provide commitment, I said there are these things called commitment problems where like there's some,

1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:16.280
 I have some incentive to like exterminate you, but that's going to be costly for everybody.

1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:18.280
 So I'm going to, what's the solution?

1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:19.280
 Well, I'm going to provide commitment.

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:21.280
 I'm going to like enforce this deal.

1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:26.280
 And yeah, you don't like this deal now because you could take advantage of your situation and wage war,

1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:28.280
 but I'm going to give you a counter incentive.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:31.280
 And, and, and so they keep the peace.

1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:37.280
 And so, and it's a little bit, so they're a little bit like the UN Security Council and peacekeeping forces and sanctions regimes.

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:42.280
 It's like the same kinds of tools, the same parallels and, and they're imperfect.

1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:45.280
 They don't always work that well and they're unequal, right?

1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:50.280
 Cause it's not like they're pursuing this in the interests of like democratic blah, blah, blah.

1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:55.280
 But it kind of works until it doesn't.

1:33:55.280 --> 1:34:00.280
 And, and 10 years ago in, you know, in the mid 1990s, there were wars and this breaks down.

1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:06.280
 And I, it kind of gave me this perspective on the international institutions and all the tools we've built that we do the same things, right?

1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:14.280
 Sanctions are designed to make unchecked leaders face the cost of war.

1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:18.280
 It's a solution to one of the five problems, right?

1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:27.280
 And mediators are a solution to uncertainty and international institutions that can enforce a peace and agreement are a solution to commitment problems.

1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:35.280
 And all of these things can be solutions to these intangible incentives, like these preferences for whatever you value and miscalculations

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:41.280
 because they will punish you for your miscalculation or they will get a mediator to sort of help you realize why you're miscalculating.

1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:49.280
 So, so they're doing all these things and it made me realize that the comparison to the UN Security Council and all our tools is actually a pretty good one

1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:51.280
 because those are pretty unequal too.

1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:53.280
 And those are pretty imperfect.

1:34:53.280 --> 1:35:00.280
 Like that's, you know, it's, there's these, we have five nations with a veto on the Security Council and a lot of unequal power

1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:06.280
 and they're manipulating this in their own self interest or their group's interests.

1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:17.280
 So, so anyway, so it's actually the some of the things that work in Medellin and why they work help give me a lot of perspective on what works in the international arena

1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:19.280
 and why we have some of the problems we have is like.

1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:27.280
 So there's not in some deep way, there's not a fundamental difference between those 17 mafia groups and the UN Security Council.

1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:31.280
 The UN Security Council.

1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:33.280
 We're such a funny descendant of apes.

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:35.280
 Put on suits.

1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:39.280
 I'm sure there were different, they have different cultural garbs that they wear.

1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:40.280
 What are your thoughts?

1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:49.280
 I mean, that's the sense I got from Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa who founded the Medellin cartel is like having spoken with people.

1:35:49.280 --> 1:36:03.280
 And as podcast, Dr. Roger Reeves, who was a drug transporter, it seems like there, it seems like it was, I don't know the right term, but it was very kind of professional and calm.

1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:05.280
 It didn't have a sense of danger to it.

1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:06.280
 Like it's negotiating.

1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:14.280
 So like the danger is always on the table as a threat as part of the calculation, but you're using that threat in order to deescalate in order to have peace.

1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:17.280
 Everybody is interested in peace.

1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:22.280
 So something that happened last year, we were a little bit able to watch in real time because we had a few contacts.

1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:27.280
 We've been meeting and talking to a lot of these leaders in prison and a bit outside of prison.

1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:29.280
 Many of them will talk to us.

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:34.280
 And so they're the homicide rate.

1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:39.280
 I mentioned homicide rate and medicines, maybe a two thirds or half of the Chicago level.

1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:41.280
 It had been climbing.

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:46.280
 Some of these street level gangs were starting to fight.

1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:55.280
 Maybe at sort of the, on some level, it seems that like maybe some of those prison leaders were like saying, well, you know, we're actually not sure how strong these guys are.

1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:57.280
 Let's let them fight just to test it out.

1:36:57.280 --> 1:36:58.280
 Let's have these skirmishes, right?

1:36:58.280 --> 1:36:59.280
 It wasn't prolonged warfare.

1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:06.280
 It was like, let's just sort of feel out how strong everybody is because then we'll be able to reapportion the drug corners and stuff accordingly.

1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:14.280
 So they're kind of feeling each other out through fighting and the homicide rate doubled and then it increased by the same amount again.

1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:19.280
 So it was approaching something that might get out of control, which wasn't in anybody's interest.

1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:20.280
 It wasn't in the government's interest.

1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:21.280
 It wasn't in their interest.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:31.280
 And so then magically all of these leaders in these patios, right, different prisons, they're spread out around a bunch of prisons.

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:40.280
 Everybody gets transferred to a new prison on the same day, which means they all get to be in the same holding area for three days before they're all moved elsewhere.

1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:42.280
 So the government had a role in this.

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:48.280
 And then somebody who's like a trusted mediator on the criminal side gets himself arrested.

1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:51.280
 It happens to be put in the same spot.

1:37:51.280 --> 1:38:01.280
 And a week later, the homicide rate is 30% of what it was is back to its normal model.

1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:03.280
 Unfortunately, not zero, right?

1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:09.280
 But it's back to where it was because it didn't make sense to have a war.

1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:18.280
 And everybody, government, mafia leaders, everybody sort of like, they figured out a way to sort of bargain their way to peace.

1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:27.280
 Can I say this almost like a tangent, but you mentioned you got a chance potentially to talk to a few folks, someone in prison, someone or not.

1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:30.280
 Is it productive?

1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:32.280
 Is it interesting?

1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:38.280
 Maybe by way of advice, do you have ideas about talking to people who are actively criminals?

1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.280
 Yeah, it really depends on the situation.

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:49.280
 So like the first time I worked in a conflicted place was in northern Uganda in the maybe the last couple years of a long running war.

1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:51.280
 So this would have been 2004, 2005.

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:53.280
 This is a small East African country.

1:38:53.280 --> 1:39:06.280
 And the north of the country had been engulfed in, think of it as like a 20 year low level insurgency run by a self proclaimed messiah

1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:09.280
 who wasn't that popular and no one joined his movement.

1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:11.280
 So he would kidnap kids.

1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:18.280
 And so the, I never, I could talk to people who are, who'd come back from being there.

1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:26.280
 I never once, if I'd wanted to, and I was writing about that armed group, I never talked to anybody who was an active member of that armed group was quite rare.

1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:30.280
 It wouldn't have been easier safe.

1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.280
 And that's sometimes true.

1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:36.280
 I'm starting to do some work in Mexico, probably, and I'm not going to be talking to any criminal.

1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:37.280
 They'll kill people.

1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:42.280
 And you say you're not going to talk to them and they'll kill people?

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.280
 Which people?

1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:49.280
 So, I mean, journalists are routinely killed for knowing too much in Mexico.

1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.280
 There's no, there's no compunctions about killing them and there's no consequences.

1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:56.280
 Who do you, who kills a journalist?

1:39:56.280 --> 1:40:00.280
 It's not the main people that you spoke with.

1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:02.280
 It's there.

1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:05.280
 Is it their lackeys or is it rival?

1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:07.280
 No, so, so, so, um, gangs.

1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:11.280
 This is true of a Chicago gang and this is true of a Medellin gang.

1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:15.280
 It's probably true of a Mexico gang is like, you might have your group of 30 people.

1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:17.280
 One or two of them might be shooters.

1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:19.280
 Most people don't shoot.

1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:21.280
 Most people don't like to do that.

1:40:21.280 --> 1:40:25.280
 Or you don't even have any of those people in your group because you're trying to run a business.

1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:26.280
 You don't need any shooters.

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:30.280
 You can just hire a killer when you need them on contract.

1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:36.280
 And so, if somebody's asking questions and you don't want them to ask questions

1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:39.280
 or you think they know too much in a way that threatens you

1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:44.280
 and it's cheap for you and you have no personal compunctions

1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:49.280
 and you can, then you can put a contract out on them and they'll be killed.

1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:54.280
 That doesn't happen in Colombia.

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.280
 It doesn't happen in Chicago.

1:40:58.280 --> 1:40:59.280
 I don't know.

1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:00.280
 There's lots of reasons for that.

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:01.280
 I can't say exactly why.

1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:06.280
 I think one reason is like, they know what'll happen is that there'll be consequences

1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:11.280
 that the government will crack down and make them pay and so they don't do it.

1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:15.280
 And that is not what happened in Mexico.

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:16.280
 They won't kill like a deagent.

1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:18.280
 They know that the US has made it clear.

1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:21.280
 You kill one of our agents, we will make you pay.

1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:25.280
 And so, they're very careful to minimize death of an American,

1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:29.280
 but you kill journalists and nobody comes after them or is able to come after them.

1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:31.280
 And so, they've realized they can get away with this

1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:33.280
 and that seems to be the equilibrium there.

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:36.280
 That's my initial sense from...

1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:40.280
 But we spent a lot of time before we started talking to criminals.

1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:44.280
 We spent a year trying to figure out what was safe before we actually...

1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:45.280
 And failing.

1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:46.280
 We kept...

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:47.280
 There were lots of safe things to do.

1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:50.280
 It was also really hard to figure out how to talk to people in these organizations

1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:55.280
 and we failed 40 times before we figured out a way to actually access people.

1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.280
 Is it worth it talking to them if you figure out...

1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:00.280
 Because it's not never going to be safe.

1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:05.280
 It's going to be when you estimate that there's some low level of risk.

1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:11.280
 What's the benefit as a researcher, as a scholar of humans?

1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:12.280
 Yeah.

1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:14.280
 So, I actually don't think...

1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:15.280
 Let's compare it to something...

1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:18.280
 Okay, I'm in Austin for the first time and I'm walking around

1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:23.280
 and there's all these people buzzing around on these scooters without helmets.

1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:26.280
 We need to definitely interview them and say what the hell is wrong with you.

1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:32.280
 So, nothing I have ever done in my entire career is as risky as that.

1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:36.280
 That's a nice way to compare journalism in a war zone.

1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:39.280
 Yeah, there are some war zones.

1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:43.280
 I worked in Northern Uganda and I worked in Liberia and I work now in Medellin

1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:45.280
 and I'm starting to work in Mexico.

1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:49.280
 Both those particular places and then the things I did in those places

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:54.280
 where I spent a lot of time making sure that what I was doing was not unduly risky.

1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:59.280
 Todd, could you pull up a picture of a person on a scooter in Austin

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:04.280
 so we can just compare this absurd situation where I doubt it's the riskiest thing

1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:06.280
 because now we have to look at the data.

1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:08.280
 I understand the point you're making, but...

1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:09.280
 Well...

1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:11.280
 So, I'm not trying to say there's zero risk.

1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:13.280
 I think there's like a calculated risk

1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:16.280
 and I think you become good at...

1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:20.280
 You work at becoming good at being able to assess these risks

1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:22.280
 and know who can help you assess these risks.

1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:27.280
 Yeah, I think there's another aspect to it too.

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:34.280
 When you're riding a scooter, once you're done with the scooter, the risk has disappeared.

1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:38.280
 There's something lingering when you have to look over your shoulder,

1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:42.280
 potential for the rest of your life as you accumulate all these conversations.

1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:45.280
 Yeah, I've chosen, but I've also advised my students

1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:52.280
 and I wouldn't go and do this with an armed group that would think I knew too much and therefore...

1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:53.280
 Some people do that.

1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:56.280
 Some journalists, I think, are very brave and take risks and do that

1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:58.280
 and good for them and I'm happy they do that.

1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:02.280
 I don't personally do that.

1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:04.280
 So, these guys are very...

1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:06.280
 I mean, in Medellin, it's a business.

1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:09.280
 They're selling local drugs

1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:12.280
 and they are laundering money for the big cartels

1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:19.280
 and they are shaking down businesses for money or selling services in some cases

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:21.280
 and they make a lot of money.

1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:25.280
 It's a business and they're in prison.

1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:29.280
 So, they can talk about most of what they want to talk about

1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:30.280
 because there's no double jeopardy.

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:36.280
 They've been incarcerated for it and you're just talking shop

1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:41.280
 and they're just... So, it's worth it, I think, because the risk is very low

1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:44.280
 but if you actually want to weaken these organizations

1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:48.280
 and they're extremely powerful, they're extremely big facet of life in a lot of cities

1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:53.280
 in the Americas in particular, including in some American cities,

1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:58.280
 if you want to understand how to weaken these groups over time,

1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:00.280
 you have to understand how their business works

1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:08.280
 and imagine you were made like whatever the oils are of the United States

1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:10.280
 or maybe you're in charge of the finance industry.

1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:15.280
 You're the regulator for oil and energy or for finance

1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:18.280
 and then you get in the job and someone says...

1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:20.280
 and then you're like, well, how many firms are there

1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:22.280
 and what do they sell and what are the prices?

1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:24.280
 And then we're just like, well, we don't really know.

1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:27.280
 You would not be a very good regulator.

1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:31.280
 And if you're a policeman or you're someone who's in charge of counter organized crime,

1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:32.280
 you're just a regulator.

1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:34.280
 You're trying to regulate an illicit industry.

1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.280
 You're regulating an industry that happens to be illicit

1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:39.280
 and you have no information.

1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:42.280
 And so that's kind of what we do.

1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:44.280
 We figure out how the system works

1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:47.280
 and what are the economic incentives and what are the political incentives?

1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:50.280
 Any interviews and conversations help with that?

1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:51.280
 They help a lot, yeah, yeah.

1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:52.280
 We do that.

1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:57.280
 I mean, I do some of those, but on the side, my Spanish is okay.

1:45:57.280 --> 1:45:59.280
 It's not great.

1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:02.280
 Do you have a translator usually if you ever go directly?

1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:05.280
 Well, if only because I can't understand the street vernacular.

1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:07.280
 I'm just totally hopeless.

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:10.280
 Nor could many people who speak Spanish as a second language.

1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:11.280
 It's totally...

1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:12.280
 You go to prison and you talk to these guys

1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:16.280
 and they're speaking in the local dialect and it's tough.

1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:19.280
 But more importantly, I just don't need to be there

1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:20.280
 and that's not my...

1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:22.280
 I'm a quantitative scholar.

1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:24.280
 I'm the guy who collects the data.

1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:28.280
 So we have people on our team and colleagues and employees

1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.280
 who are doing full time interviews.

1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:33.280
 And then I just sometimes go with them.

1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:34.280
 What about if we...

1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:35.280
 You mentioned Uganda.

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:36.280
 Yeah.

1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:39.280
 Yeah, Joseph Coney, the Ugandan warlord.

1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:45.280
 I'm seeing here he kidnapped 591 children in three years between 2000.

1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:47.280
 They must have kidnapped.

1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:50.280
 They probably kidnapped for at least a short time,

1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:54.280
 like a few hours to a day, more than 50,000 kids.

1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:56.280
 As a terror tactic?

1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:57.280
 A little bit.

1:46:57.280 --> 1:46:59.280
 I mean, you know, most of those people,

1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:01.280
 they just let go after they carried goods.

1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:03.280
 They tried to hold onto thousands.

1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:06.280
 The short story, listen, if you're not popular,

1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:10.280
 if you're running in our movement and you need troops,

1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:11.280
 you can...

1:47:11.280 --> 1:47:13.280
 And nobody wants to fight for you.

1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:15.280
 You can either give up

1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:18.280
 or you can have a small clandestine terror organization

1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:19.280
 that tries to...

1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:20.280
 A different set of tactics.

1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:23.280
 But if you want a conventional army and you don't want to give up,

1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:25.280
 then you have to conscript.

1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:27.280
 And if you want to conscript and you don't...

1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:29.280
 You know, here we conscript and then we say,

1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:31.280
 if you run away, we'll shoot you.

1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:33.280
 And we control the whole territory.

1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:34.280
 So we'll...

1:47:34.280 --> 1:47:36.280
 That's a credible promise.

1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:39.280
 If you're a small insurgency organization,

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:42.280
 people can run away and then you can't promise to shoot them very easily

1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:44.280
 because you don't control all the territory.

1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:47.280
 And what these movements do is they try to brainwash you.

1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:50.280
 And I think what they figured out after years of abducting children,

1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:52.280
 you know, you talk about evil,

1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:55.280
 they figured out that, you know, we have to...

1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:57.280
 Maybe like, I don't know,

1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:00.280
 but say like maybe one in a hundred will like buy the rhetoric.

1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:04.280
 So we just have to conscript or abduct a large number of kids

1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:06.280
 and then some small number of them will not run away.

1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:09.280
 And those will be our committed cadres.

1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:11.280
 And those people can become commanders.

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:15.280
 And because they'll buy the propaganda and they'll buy the messianic messages.

1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:18.280
 But because most people wise up, we have...

1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:20.280
 Especially as they get older,

1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:23.280
 we just have to abduct vast numbers of kids in order to have a committed cadre.

1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:28.280
 And so it has the other benefit of sort of being terrifying for the population

1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:30.280
 and being a weapon in itself.

1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:36.280
 But I think for them it was just primarily a way to solve a recruitment problem

1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:46.280
 when you're a totally like hopeless and ideologically empty rebel movement.

1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:48.280
 So in some sense it's...

1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:52.280
 Yeah, so that's maybe the short story. It was a real tragedy.

1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:56.280
 I heard one interview of a dictator

1:48:56.280 --> 1:49:00.280
 where the journalist was basically telling them like,

1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:06.280
 how could you be doing this basically calling out all the atrocities

1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:11.280
 the person's committing and the dictator was kind of laughing it off and walked away.

1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:13.280
 And like he cut off the interview.

1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:16.280
 That feel like a very unproductive thing to be doing.

1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:20.280
 You're basically stating the thing that everyone knows to his face.

1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:25.280
 Maybe that's pleasant to somebody, but that feels unproductive.

1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:29.280
 It feels like the goal should be some level of understanding.

1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:31.280
 Yeah.

1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:34.280
 He's been super lucive.

1:49:34.280 --> 1:49:39.280
 I mean, why he's fought this... I don't even know.

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:43.280
 You know, it's not a great example of...

1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:49.280
 The way I look at that situation is...

1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:52.280
 It's a little bit particular the way Uganda works,

1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:57.280
 but most of the political leadership for most of its post independence history

1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.280
 came from the north of the country.

1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:02.280
 That was like the power base.

1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:05.280
 And that was dictatorial and they were...

1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:07.280
 So you've heard of like people like Idi Amin,

1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:09.280
 but people have heard of like Milton Abote,

1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:12.280
 and all these people were all from the north.

1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:15.280
 And then you get the current president who came power in 1986.

1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:17.280
 So he's been around a long time.

1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:21.280
 He was from the south.

1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:25.280
 And he was fighting against these dictators,

1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:27.280
 and he was fighting for a freer and better Uganda.

1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:28.280
 And in many ways...

1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:30.280
 I mean, he's still a dictator himself,

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:33.280
 but he did create a freer and better Uganda.

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:35.280
 So he's better than these...

1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:38.280
 He's a thug, but he was better than thugs before him.

1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:41.280
 And he came to power and he was like...

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:43.280
 And these...

1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:44.280
 Some of the northerners were like,

1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:46.280
 we want to keep up the fight.

1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:48.280
 And he was like, you know what, you guys,

1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:50.280
 I'm strong enough to continue to the north.

1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:53.280
 You guys go, you want to have a crazy insurgency up there

1:50:53.280 --> 1:50:58.280
 and some kook believes he's like speaking,

1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:01.280
 you know, through the Holy Spirit,

1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:02.280
 you know, speaking through him

1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:05.280
 and he's going to totally disrupt the north.

1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:06.280
 I don't care.

1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:07.280
 That's great.

1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:10.280
 You guys just fester and fight,

1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:13.280
 and that's going to totally destabilize this power,

1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:15.280
 this traditional power base,

1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:17.280
 and then that's just going to help me consolidate control.

1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:18.280
 So he was not a crowd.

1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:22.280
 He was an unchecked leader who allowed a lunatic

1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:26.280
 to run around and cause mayhem

1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:30.280
 because it was in his political interest to do so.

1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:34.280
 And there is no puzzle.

1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:39.280
 It's in some ways, it's that simple and kind of tragic.

1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:41.280
 There's little to understand.

1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:42.280
 Yeah, it took me a lot.

1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:43.280
 Well, you know what?

1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:44.280
 It's not so easy.

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:46.280
 In the middle of it, I didn't understand that.

1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:48.280
 I don't think a lot of people did.

1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:49.280
 And I'm not...

1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:53.280
 I think I could persuade most people who study or work there now

1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:54.280
 to like see it that way.

1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:56.280
 I think people that would make sense to people,

1:51:56.280 --> 1:51:58.280
 but it didn't make sense in the moment.

1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:00.280
 You know, in the moment this is happening,

1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:02.280
 it's terrible and you kind of, you know,

1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:05.280
 you don't realize how avoidable it was.

1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:08.280
 Basically, it was the absence of effective police actions

1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:12.280
 that kept the lunatic from being contained.

1:52:12.280 --> 1:52:15.280
 And that lunatic would never, you know,

1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:17.280
 it's not that skillful of our movement, right?

1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:19.280
 They could have been shut down

1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:22.280
 and there was just never any political will to shut it down.

1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:23.280
 The opposite.

1:52:23.280 --> 1:52:24.280
 That's what I meant.

1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:25.280
 Like that unchecked leader,

1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:26.280
 not only do you not bear the cost,

1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:28.280
 but you might have a private incentive as an autocrat

1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:30.280
 to like see that violence happen.

1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:33.280
 And in this case, it was just keeping a troublesome part

1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:35.280
 of the country busy.

1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:38.280
 If it's okay to look at a few other wars.

1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:42.280
 So we talked about drug wars and Medellin.

1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:45.280
 Are there other wars to stand out to you as full of lessons?

1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:46.280
 We can jump around a little bit.

1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:49.280
 Maybe if we can return briefly at World War II

1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:52.280
 from your framework,

1:52:52.280 --> 1:52:55.280
 could World War II have been avoided?

1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:00.280
 This is one of the most traumatic wars, global wars.

1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:07.280
 I mean, one obvious driver of that war was these,

1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:13.280
 the things that Hitler valued and then was able

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:17.280
 to use his autocratic power to either convince other people

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:21.280
 or to suppress them.

1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:24.280
 And so some people stopped there and say that.

1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:27.280
 And then in the West basically,

1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:29.280
 and then of course they were able,

1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:32.280
 because they were such an economic and political powerhouse,

1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:35.280
 they were able to sort of make demands of the rest of Europe

1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:38.280
 that you can kind of see the fold,

1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:41.280
 letting Nazis march into Denmark without a fight

1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:43.280
 or France folding very quickly.

1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:45.280
 You can kind of see as like an appeasement

1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:49.280
 or an acknowledgement of their superiority

1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:52.280
 and their ability to bargain without much of a fight.

1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:55.280
 And then you can see the Western response

1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:56.280
 as a principled stand.

1:53:56.280 --> 1:53:58.280
 I think that's, and there's a lot of truth to that.

1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:01.280
 You know, in terms of the strategic forces,

1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:03.280
 a lot of political scientists see a version

1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:07.280
 of a commitment problem basically where Germany says,

1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:11.280
 you know what, we're strong now, we're temporarily strong,

1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:14.280
 we're not going to be this strong forever.

1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:17.280
 If we can get this terrible bargain

1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:21.280
 and get everyone to capitulate through violence,

1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:25.280
 if we strike now and then solidify our power

1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:28.280
 and keep these, in World War I,

1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:31.280
 it was prevent the rise of Russia

1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:36.280
 and prevent the strengthening of Russian alliance

1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:37.280
 as well.

1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:41.280
 And so we have an incentive to strike now

1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:43.280
 and there's a window of opportunity that's closing

1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:46.280
 and that they thought was closing as soon as 1917

1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:47.280
 in World War I.

1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:50.280
 And I don't know that that story is as persuasive

1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:51.280
 in World War II.

1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:53.280
 I think there was an element of a closing window.

1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:55.280
 They kept talking about a closing window.

1:54:55.280 --> 1:54:57.280
 They really thought there's a closing window.

1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:00.280
 I think it was a nature that windows different

1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:04.280
 in that there was kind of pacifism

1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:09.280
 and it seems like if war broke out,

1:55:09.280 --> 1:55:13.280
 most nations in the vicinity would not be ready.

1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:17.280
 By the people, the leaders that are in power,

1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:20.280
 they weren't ready so the timing is really right now.

1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:22.280
 But I wonder how often that is the case

1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:25.280
 with leaders in war that feels like the timing is now.

1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:27.280
 The other commitment problem,

1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:30.280
 the other shift that was happening that he wanted to avert

1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.280
 that is kind of wrapped up with his ideology

1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:37.280
 is this idea of a cultural and a demographic window of opportunity

1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:42.280
 that if conditional on having these views

1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:46.280
 of a Germanic people and a pure race,

1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:51.280
 he had to strike now before any opportunity

1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:54.280
 to sort of establish that was possible.

1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.280
 I think that's one...

1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:59.280
 It's an incentive that requires his ideology as well.

1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:03.280
 How do we avoid it within this framework?

1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:07.280
 Would you say is there...

1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:11.280
 You kind of provide an explanation,

1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:13.280
 but is there a way to avoid it?

1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:15.280
 Is violence the way to avoid it?

1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:17.280
 Because people kind of tried rational,

1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:22.280
 peaceful kind of usual negotiation

1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:23.280
 and that led to this war.

1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:26.280
 Is that unique to this particular war?

1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:28.280
 Let's say World War I or World War II.

1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:31.280
 So there's an extra pressure from Germany

1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:33.280
 and both wars to act.

1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:34.280
 So we've highlighted that.

1:56:34.280 --> 1:56:37.280
 Is there a way to alleviate that extra pressure to act?

1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:39.280
 Let me use World War I as an example.

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.280
 Suppose, as many German generals said at that time,

1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:47.280
 we have a window of opportunity before Russia,

1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:49.280
 where we might not win a war with Russia.

1:56:49.280 --> 1:56:52.280
 So the probability that we can win a war

1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:55.280
 is going to change a lot in the next decade or two,

1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:57.280
 maybe even in the next few years.

1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:00.280
 If we were in a much better bargaining position now,

1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:02.280
 both to not use violence,

1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:04.280
 but to if necessarily use violence.

1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:07.280
 Because otherwise, Russia's going to be extremely powerful

1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:09.280
 in the future and they'll be able to use that power

1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:12.280
 to change the bargaining with us

1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:14.280
 and to keep us down.

1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:17.280
 And the thing is, in principle,

1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:19.280
 Russia could say, look,

1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:22.280
 we don't want to get invaded right now.

1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:24.280
 We know you could invade us.

1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:25.280
 We know we're weak.

1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:26.280
 We know we'll be strong in the future.

1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:32.280
 We promise to not wield our and abuse our

1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:35.280
 or just merely just sort of take what we can get

1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:37.280
 in the future when we're strong.

1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:39.280
 We're going to restrain ourselves in the future.

1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:41.280
 Or we're going to hand over something that makes us powerful

1:57:41.280 --> 1:57:44.280
 because that's the bargain that would make us all better off.

1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:48.280
 And the reason political economists call it a commitment problem

1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:50.280
 is because that's a commitment that would solve the problem.

1:57:50.280 --> 1:57:52.280
 And they can't make that commitment

1:57:52.280 --> 1:57:54.280
 because there's nobody who will hold them accountable.

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:58.280
 So anything, any international legal architecture,

1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:01.280
 any set of enforceable agreements,

1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:04.280
 any UN Security Council, any world government,

1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:07.280
 anything that would help you make that commitment

1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:11.280
 is a solution, all right, if that's the core problem.

1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:15.280
 And so that's why, you know, in Medellin,

1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:19.280
 you know, the La Fousina can do that.

1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:22.280
 They can say, listen, yes, combo that's strong today

1:58:22.280 --> 1:58:24.280
 is going to be weak tomorrow.

1:58:24.280 --> 1:58:27.280
 You have an incentive to eliminate this combo over here

1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:29.280
 because they're going to be strong.

1:58:29.280 --> 1:58:31.280
 But guess what? You're not going to do that.

1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:33.280
 And we're going to make sure, we're going to promise

1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:35.280
 that when these guys do get strong,

1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:37.280
 we're going to restrain what they can do.

1:58:37.280 --> 1:58:40.280
 Most of our constitutions in most stable countries

1:58:40.280 --> 1:58:42.280
 have done precisely that, right?

1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:44.280
 There's a lot of complaining right now in the United States

1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:47.280
 about the way that the Constitution is a portion power

1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:49.280
 between states.

1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:52.280
 That was a deal, that was a commitment.

1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:54.280
 The Constitution was, in the United States,

1:58:54.280 --> 1:58:56.280
 was a deal made to a bunch of states

1:58:56.280 --> 1:58:58.280
 that knew they were going to be weak in future

1:58:58.280 --> 1:59:01.280
 because of economic and demographic trends,

1:59:01.280 --> 1:59:03.280
 or guess they might be, and it said, listen,

1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:07.280
 you cooperate and will, and will commit

1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:10.280
 not to basically ignore your interests over the long run.

1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:14.280
 And now, you know, 250 years later,

1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:18.280
 we're still honoring those commitments.

1:59:18.280 --> 1:59:21.280
 It was part of the deal that meant

1:59:21.280 --> 1:59:23.280
 that there actually would be a union.

1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:25.280
 And so, we do this all the time.

1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:28.280
 So, Constitution is a good example of how

1:59:28.280 --> 1:59:31.280
 every country's Constitution,

1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:34.280
 especially a country who's writing a Constitution after a war,

1:59:34.280 --> 1:59:37.280
 that Constitution and all of the other institutions

1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:39.280
 that are building are in an attempt to, like,

1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:41.280
 provide commitment to groups who are worried

1:59:41.280 --> 1:59:43.280
 about future shifts in power.

1:59:43.280 --> 1:59:46.280
 And does that help with avoid civil war?

1:59:46.280 --> 1:59:50.280
 Could you speak to lessons you learned from civil wars,

1:59:50.280 --> 1:59:53.280
 perhaps the American Civil War and the others?

1:59:53.280 --> 1:59:58.280
 So, Lebanon, one of the ways Lebanon had tried

1:59:58.280 --> 2:00:02.280
 for a long time to preserve the interests

2:00:02.280 --> 2:00:05.280
 of minority groups, powerful minority groups

2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:08.280
 who were powerful at the time and knew

2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:10.280
 that the demographics were working against them

2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:14.280
 was to guarantee, you know, this ethnic religious group

2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:17.280
 gets the presidency and this ethnic religious group

2:00:17.280 --> 2:00:19.280
 gets the prime ministership and this ethnic,

2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:23.280
 and a lot of countries will apportion seats

2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:26.280
 in the parliament to ethnic religious groups.

2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:29.280
 And that's an attempt to, like,

2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:34.280
 give a group that's temporarily powerful

2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:36.280
 some assurances that they're,

2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:38.280
 when they're weak in the future,

2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:40.280
 that they'll still have a say, right?

2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:42.280
 Just like we portion seats in the Senate

2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:45.280
 in a way that's not demographically representative

2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:47.280
 but is like unequal, quote, unquote,

2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:49.280
 in a sense to help people be confident

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:51.280
 that there won't be a tyranny of the majority.

2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:53.280
 And now that just happens to have been,

2:00:53.280 --> 2:00:55.280
 like, a really unstable arrangement in Lebanon

2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:59.280
 because eventually, like, the de facto power on the ground

2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:03.280
 just gets so out of line with this really rigid system

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:06.280
 of the presidency goes to this ethnic religious group

2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:08.280
 and this prime ministership goes,

2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:10.280
 that it didn't last, right?

2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:14.280
 But you can think of every post conflict agreement

2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:16.280
 and every constitution is like a little bit

2:01:16.280 --> 2:01:23.280
 of humans best effort to find an agreement

2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:27.280
 that's going to protect the interests of a group

2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:31.280
 that's temporarily has an interest in violence

2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:35.280
 in order to not be violent.

2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:38.280
 And so there's a lot of ingenuity

2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:40.280
 and it doesn't always work, right?

2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:43.280
 Which, actually, from a perspective of the group,

2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:46.280
 threatening violence or actually doing violence

2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:48.280
 is one way to make progress for your group.

2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:51.280
 We're talking about groups bargaining over stuff, right?

2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:53.280
 We're talking about Russians versus Ukraine

2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:55.280
 or Russians versus in the West

2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:57.280
 or maybe it's Medizhin gains versus one another.

2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:00.280
 Like, a lot of their bargaining power

2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:03.280
 comes from their ability to burn the house down, right?

2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:05.280
 And so if I want to have more bargaining power,

2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:08.280
 I can just arm a lot and I can threaten violence.

2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:12.280
 And so the strategically wise thing to do,

2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:14.280
 I mean, it's terrible, it's a terrible equilibrium

2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:16.280
 for us to be forced into,

2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:18.280
 but the strategically wise thing to do

2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:20.280
 is to build up lots of arms to threaten to use them,

2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:22.280
 to credibly threaten to use them,

2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:24.280
 but then trust or hope that, like,

2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:26.280
 your enemy is going to see reason

2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:31.280
 and avoid this really terrible inefficient thing

2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:33.280
 which is fighting.

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:35.280
 But the thing that's going on the whole time

2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:37.280
 is both of you arming and spending, like,

2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:39.280
 20% of GDP or whatever on arms,

2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:41.280
 that's pretty inefficient.

2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:43.280
 That's the tragedy.

2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:46.280
 We don't have war and that's good,

2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:48.280
 but we have really limited abilities

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:51.280
 to incentivize our enemies not to arm

2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:53.280
 and to keep ourselves from arming.

2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:55.280
 We'd love to agree to just, like, both disarm,

2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:57.280
 but we can't.

2:02:57.280 --> 2:02:59.280
 And so the masses that we have to arm

2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:01.280
 and then we have to threaten all the time.

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:03.280
 Yeah, so the threat of violence

2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:05.280
 is costing, nevertheless.

2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:07.280
 You've actually pulled up

2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:09.280
 that now disappeared a paper that said

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:11.280
 the big title called Civil War

2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:13.280
 and your name is on it.

2:03:13.280 --> 2:03:15.280
 What's that about?

2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:17.280
 Well, that was, I mean,

2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:19.280
 when I was finishing graduate school

2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:21.280
 and this was a paper with my advisor at Ted Miguel,

2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:23.280
 at Berkeley.

2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:25.280
 Most nations the paper opens

2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:27.280
 have experienced an internal armed conflict

2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:29.280
 since 1960,

2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:31.280
 yet while were you still in grad school on this or no?

2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:33.280
 Maybe last year

2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:35.280
 or just graduated, I think.

2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:37.280
 I wish I was in a discipline

2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:39.280
 that wrote papers like this. This is pretty badass.

2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:41.280
 Yet while Civil War

2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:43.280
 is central to many nations development,

2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:45.280
 it has stood

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:47.280
 at the periphery

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:49.280
 of economic research

2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:51.280
 and teaching, so on and so forth.

2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:53.280
 And this is looking at Civil War broadly

2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:55.280
 throughout history or is it just particular Civil Wars?

2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.280
 You were mostly looking at, like, the late 20th century.

2:03:57.280 --> 2:03:59.280
 I mean, I was trained

2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:01.280
 as a development economist,

2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:03.280
 which is somebody who studies why some places are poor

2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:05.280
 and why some countries are rich.

2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:07.280
 And

2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:09.280
 I, like, a number of people

2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:11.280
 around that time stumbled into

2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:13.280
 violence. I mean, people have been studying

2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:15.280
 the wealth and poverty of nations basically

2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:17.280
 since the invention of economics.

2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:19.280
 But there was

2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:21.280
 a big blind spot

2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:23.280
 for violence.

2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:25.280
 Now, there isn't any more.

2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:27.280
 There's a flourishing area of study

2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.280
 but in economics. But at the time

2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:31.280
 it wasn't. And so there were people like

2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:33.280
 me and Ted who

2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.280
 were sort of part political scientists

2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:37.280
 because political scientists obviously had been

2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:39.280
 sitting this for a long time, who started bringing

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:41.280
 economic tools and expertise

2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:43.280
 and, like, partnerships with

2:04:43.280 --> 2:04:45.280
 political scientists and adding to it.

2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:47.280
 And so we wrote this.

2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:49.280
 So after, like, people had been doing this for 5 or 10 years

2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:51.280
 in our field, we wrote, like, a review

2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:53.280
 article telling economists, like,

2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:55.280
 what was going on. And so this was, like, a summary

2:04:55.280 --> 2:04:57.280
 for economists. So the book in some ways is

2:04:57.280 --> 2:04:59.280
 a lot in the same spirit of this article.

2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:01.280
 This article, I mean, it's

2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:03.280
 designed to be not

2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:05.280
 written as, like, a boring laundry list of studies,

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.280
 which is what, that's the purpose this article

2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:09.280
 was. It was for graduate students and professors

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:11.280
 who wanted to think about what to work on

2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:13.280
 and what we knew.

2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:15.280
 This book is, like, now trying to, like, not

2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:17.280
 just say what economists are doing, but sort of say

2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:19.280
 what economists, political scientists,

2:05:19.280 --> 2:05:21.280
 psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, like,

2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:23.280
 once, how do we bring

2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:25.280
 some sense to this big project? And policymakers,

2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:27.280
 like, what do we know?

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:29.280
 And what do we know about building peace?

2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:31.280
 Given, you know, because

2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:33.280
 if you don't know what the reason for

2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:35.280
 wars are, you're probably not going to design

2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:37.280
 the right cure.

2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:39.280
 And so anyway, so that was

2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:41.280
 the, but I started off studying Civil Wars

2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:43.280
 and I, because I stumbled into

2:05:43.280 --> 2:05:45.280
 this place in northern Uganda basically

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.280
 by accident. It was a, never, no

2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:49.280
 intention of working in Civil Wars. I'd never

2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:51.280
 thought about it. And then,

2:05:51.280 --> 2:05:53.280
 you know,

2:05:53.280 --> 2:05:55.280
 basically, I

2:05:55.280 --> 2:05:57.280
 followed a woman there.

2:05:57.280 --> 2:05:59.280
 Oh, we'll talk about that.

2:05:59.280 --> 2:06:01.280
 I had to ask you first. And for people who are

2:06:01.280 --> 2:06:03.280
 just watching, where

2:06:03.280 --> 2:06:05.280
 we have an amazing team of folks helping out

2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:07.280
 pulling pictures and articles

2:06:07.280 --> 2:06:09.280
 and so on, mostly so that I can

2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:11.280
 pull up pictures on Instagram of animals fighting,

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:13.280
 which is what I do on my own time.

2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:15.280
 And then we could discuss, analyze

2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:17.280
 maybe with George St. Pierre. That's what all he

2:06:17.280 --> 2:06:19.280
 sends me for people who are curious.

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:21.280
 But let me ask you, one of the most

2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:23.280
 difficult things going on in the world today,

2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:25.280
 Israel Palestine,

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:27.280
 will we ever see peace

2:06:27.280 --> 2:06:29.280
 in this part of the world? And

2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:31.280
 sort of your book

2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:33.280
 title is

2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:35.280
 The Roots of War and the Paths for Peace,

2:06:35.280 --> 2:06:37.280
 or the subtitle, Why We Fight.

2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:41.280
 What's the path for peace?

2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:43.280
 Will we ever see peace? Yeah.

2:06:43.280 --> 2:06:45.280
 If we think about this

2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:47.280
 conflict

2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:49.280
 in the sense of like this dispute,

2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:51.280
 this sort of contest,

2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:53.280
 this contest that's been going on between Israelis

2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:55.280
 and Palestinians, it's been going on for a century.

2:06:55.280 --> 2:06:57.280
 And

2:06:57.280 --> 2:06:59.280
 there are really

2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:01.280
 just 10 or 15 years

2:07:01.280 --> 2:07:03.280
 of pretty serious

2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:05.280
 violence in that span

2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:07.280
 of time, most of it from 2000

2:07:07.280 --> 2:07:09.280
 to 2009 and stretching up to like

2:07:09.280 --> 2:07:11.280
 2014. They're like sporadic

2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:13.280
 incidents which are really terrible. I'm not trying

2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:15.280
 to diminish the human cost of these, by the way.

2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:17.280
 Like I'm just trying to point out that whatever's

2:07:17.280 --> 2:07:19.280
 happening, as

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:21.280
 unpleasant and challenging and difficult as it is,

2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:23.280
 it's actually not war. And so it is that peace.

2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:25.280
 There's sort of an uneasy stalemate. The Israelis

2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:27.280
 and Palestinians are actually pretty good at just sort of

2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:29.280
 keeping this at a relatively low scale of violence.

2:07:29.280 --> 2:07:31.280
 There's a whole bunch of like low scale

2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:33.280
 sporadic

2:07:33.280 --> 2:07:35.280
 violence that can be

2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:37.280
 repression of civilians.

2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:39.280
 It can be

2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:41.280
 terror bombings and terror actions.

2:07:41.280 --> 2:07:43.280
 It can be terror

2:07:43.280 --> 2:07:45.280
 violence. It can be mass

2:07:45.280 --> 2:07:47.280
 arrests. It can be repression. It can be denying

2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:49.280
 people the vote. It can be

2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:51.280
 rattling sabers. All these

2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:53.280
 things that are happening, right?

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:55.280
 And it can be sporadic

2:07:55.280 --> 2:07:57.280
 three week wars or sporadic,

2:07:57.280 --> 2:07:59.280
 you know, very brief

2:07:59.280 --> 2:08:01.280
 episodes of intense violence before

2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:03.280
 everybody sees sense and then

2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:05.280
 settles down to this uneasy.

2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:07.280
 That's not like, we're

2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:09.280
 right now to think of that as like a peace and there's certainly

2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:11.280
 a stable agreement, right?

2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:13.280
 So a stable agreement

2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:15.280
 and amity and any

2:08:15.280 --> 2:08:17.280
 ability to move on from

2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:19.280
 this extreme hostility, we're not there yet

2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:21.280
 and that's maybe

2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:23.280
 very far away.

2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:25.280
 But this is a good example

2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:27.280
 of two rivals who most

2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:29.280
 of the time have avoided really intense

2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:31.280
 violence.

2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:33.280
 You talked about this, like most

2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:35.280
 of the time,

2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:37.280
 rivals just like

2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:39.280
 avoiding violence and hating each other

2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:41.280
 in peace.

2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:43.280
 So is this what peace

2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:45.280
 does answer my question? Yeah, sometimes.

2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:47.280
 Is this what peace looks like? Not always.

2:08:47.280 --> 2:08:49.280
 But I mean, it's

2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:51.280
 kind of my worry

2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:53.280
 to go back to like the Russia Ukraine

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:55.280
 example. Like I kind of, it's really hard.

2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:57.280
 It's going to be really hard to find

2:08:57.280 --> 2:08:59.280
 an agreement

2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:01.280
 that both sides can feel they can

2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:03.280
 honor, that they can be explicit about,

2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:05.280
 that they'll hold to, that will enable them

2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:07.280
 to move on. Yeah.

2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:09.280
 Feels like a first step in a long journey

2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:11.280
 towards a greatness for both nations

2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:13.280
 in a peaceful time,

2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:15.280
 flourishing, that kind of thing.

2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:17.280
 I mean, you can think of like

2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:19.280
 what's going on in Israel,

2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:21.280
 Palestine, there's a stalemate.

2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:23.280
 Both,

2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:25.280
 both of them are exhausted from the violence

2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:27.280
 that has occurred. Neither one of them

2:09:27.280 --> 2:09:29.280
 is quite willing to, for various reasons

2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:31.280
 to create this sort of stable agreement.

2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:33.280
 There's a lot of really difficult issues

2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:35.280
 right now.

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:37.280
 And

2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:39.280
 maybe the sad thing, maybe we'll

2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:41.280
 end up in the same situation with Russia Ukraine.

2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:43.280
 This is where, you know, if every, if they

2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:45.280
 stop fighting one another, but Russia

2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:47.280
 holds the east of the country and

2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:49.280
 Crimea and nobody really acknowledges

2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:51.280
 their right to that,

2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:53.280
 that might within there just going to be a

2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:55.280
 lot of tension and skirmishing and violence.

2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:57.280
 But that never really progresses to war

2:09:57.280 --> 2:09:59.280
 for 30 years. That would be a sad

2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:01.280
 but maybe possible

2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:03.280
 outcome.

2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:05.280
 So that's kind of where Israel Palestine

2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:07.280
 looks to me. And so someone,

2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:09.280
 if we're going to talk about why we fight, then

2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:11.280
 the question we have to ask is like why

2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:13.280
 you know, like the second

2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:15.280
 Intifada, like that was the most violent episode.

2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:17.280
 Like why did that happen? And why did that

2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:19.280
 and why did that last several years?

2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:21.280
 That would be like, we could analyze

2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:23.280
 that and we could say, what was it about

2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:25.280
 these periods of violence that led

2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:27.280
 there to be prolonged intense violence, because

2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:29.280
 there was nobody's interest that didn't need to happen.

2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:31.280
 And partly don't talk about that in the book.

2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:33.280
 I wanted to avoid

2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:35.280
 really contemporary conflicts

2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:37.280
 for two reasons. One is

2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:39.280
 I, things could change really

2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:41.280
 quickly. I didn't want the book to be dated.

2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:43.280
 I wanted this to be a book that had like longevity

2:10:43.280 --> 2:10:45.280
 and that that would

2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:47.280
 be relevant still in 10 years or 20 years

2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:49.280
 maybe before someone writes a better one

2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:51.280
 or an update. Before the human civilization ends.

2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:53.280
 Exactly.

2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:55.280
 And circumstances can change really quickly. So I

2:10:55.280 --> 2:10:57.280
 wanted it to be enduring and meant

2:10:57.280 --> 2:10:59.280
 partly just avoiding changing things

2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:01.280
 and changing these and avoiding these controversial

2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:03.280
 ones. But of course I think about them and so

2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:05.280
 like a lot of my time, I decided

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:07.280
 actually last year to teach a class where I

2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:09.280
 take all these contemporary conflicts that

2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:11.280
 wasn't working on the

2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:13.280
 book and where I wasn't really an expert, whether it's

2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:15.280
 India Pakistan, China Taiwan,

2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:17.280
 Israel Palestine,

2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:19.280
 Mexican cartel state drug wars

2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:21.280
 and

2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:23.280
 a few others and then teach a class

2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:25.280
 on them with students and we'd work through it.

2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:27.280
 We'd read the book and then we'd say, all right,

2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:29.280
 none of us are experts. How do we make sense of these places?

2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:31.280
 And we focus in the

2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:33.280
 Israel Palestine case of mostly trying to understand

2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:35.280
 why it got so violent and then

2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:37.280
 spend a little bit of time on

2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:39.280
 what the prospects are for

2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:41.280
 something that's more enduring.

2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:43.280
 It's hard to know that stuff now. I mean

2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:45.280
 it's easier to do the full analysis

2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:47.280
 when it's over when it's over.

2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:49.280
 Well, Israel

2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:51.280
 is in like a tough place. They have this

2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:53.280
 attachment to being part of the West. They have these

2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:55.280
 attachment to liberal ideals. They have an attachment

2:11:55.280 --> 2:11:57.280
 to democracy and they have

2:11:57.280 --> 2:11:59.280
 an attachment to a Jewish state

2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:01.280
 and that those things

2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:03.280
 are not so easily compatible

2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:05.280
 because

2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:07.280
 to recognize

2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:09.280
 the rights of

2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:11.280
 non Jewish citizens

2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:13.280
 right or to

2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:15.280
 or to create or to have a one state

2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:17.280
 solution to the current conflict

2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:19.280
 undermines the

2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:23.280
 long term ability to have a Jewish state.

2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:25.280
 And to do anything else

2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:27.280
 and to deny that

2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:29.280
 denies

2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:31.280
 their liberal

2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:33.280
 democratic

2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:35.280
 ideals and

2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:37.280
 and that's a really hard

2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:39.280
 contest of

2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:41.280
 priorities for

2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:43.280
 to sort out. Yeah, it's complicated. Of course

2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:45.280
 everything you just said probably has multiple

2:12:45.280 --> 2:12:47.280
 perspectives on it from other

2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:49.280
 that would phrase all the same

2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:51.280
 things but using different words.

2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:53.280
 Well, I try to analyze these things

2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:55.280
 in like a dispassionate way.

2:12:55.280 --> 2:12:57.280
 But unfortunately just having enough conversations

2:12:57.280 --> 2:12:59.280
 even your dispassionate

2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:01.280
 description

2:13:01.280 --> 2:13:03.280
 would be seen as

2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:05.280
 one that's already picked a side.

2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:07.280
 And I'll say this

2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:09.280
 because there's holding these ideals.

2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:11.280
 I'll give you another example.

2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:13.280
 United States

2:13:13.280 --> 2:13:15.280
 also has ideals of freedom

2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:17.280
 and

2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:19.280
 and other like human rights.

2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:21.280
 So it has those ideals

2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:23.280
 and it also sees itself as a

2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:25.280
 superpower and as a

2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:27.280
 deployer of those

2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:29.280
 enforcer of those ideas in the world.

2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:31.280
 And so the kind of actions

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:33.280
 from a perspective of a lot of people

2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:35.280
 in that world from children

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:37.280
 they get to see drones draw bombs

2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:39.280
 on their house where

2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:41.280
 their father is now mother

2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:43.280
 or dead. They have a very different

2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:45.280
 view of this.

2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:47.280
 You're beginning to see why I didn't.

2:13:47.280 --> 2:13:49.280
 I wanted to write about those things

2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:51.280
 and think about those things

2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:53.280
 but I wanted this book

2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:55.280
 to do something different.

2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:57.280
 I didn't want it to fall along one of these polarizations.

2:13:57.280 --> 2:13:59.280
 On a personal level because I think

2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:01.280
 I'm kind of a liberal democratic

2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:03.280
 person at heart

2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:05.280
 my sympathies in that sense lie

2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:07.280
 in many ways with the Palestinians

2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:09.280
 despite the way I

2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:11.280
 just the fact that people

2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:13.280
 presented and they

2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:15.280
 and they got

2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:17.280
 a very raw, real politic kind

2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:19.280
 of feel like most people in history have gotten

2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:21.280
 like this raw, real politic kind of deal

2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:23.280
 in their past, right? Where somebody took some

2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:25.280
 history by the way.

2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:27.280
 History is just full of raw deals

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:29.280
 for regular people.

2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:31.280
 And

2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:33.280
 in both sides

2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:35.280
 are in a principled way

2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:37.280
 refusing to make a compromise

2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:39.280
 and that's not like a both

2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:41.280
 sides a right kind of argument.

2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:43.280
 I'm just sort of saying

2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:45.280
 it's a factual statement

2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:47.280
 that like neither one wants to compromise

2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:49.280
 on certain principles

2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:51.280
 and they're both

2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:53.280
 they both can construct and in some ways

2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:55.280
 have very reasonable

2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:57.280
 have self justifications for those principles

2:14:57.280 --> 2:14:59.280
 and that's why I'm not very hopeful

2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:01.280
 as I don't see a way

2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:03.280
 and to

2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:05.280
 for them to resolve those things.

2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:07.280
 Speaking of compromise and war

2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:09.280
 maybe about one last one

2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:11.280
 which may be in the future

2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:13.280
 China and the United States

2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:15.280
 how do we avoid

2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:17.280
 an all out hot war

2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:19.280
 with this other superpower

2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:21.280
 in the next decade

2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:23.280
 50 years, 100 years

2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:25.280
 because

2:15:25.280 --> 2:15:27.280
 sometimes when it's quiet at night

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:29.280
 I can hear in the long distance

2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:31.280
 the drums of war beating.

2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:33.280
 Yeah.

2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:35.280
 You know in the second part of the book I talk about

2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:37.280
 there's been like these persistent like paths to peace

2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:39.280
 and one of them is increasing interdependence

2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:41.280
 and interrelationships and another one

2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:43.280
 is more checks and balances on power.

2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:45.280
 I think

2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:47.280
 there's more but those are two that are really fundamental

2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:49.280
 here because I think those two things

2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:51.280
 reduce the incentives

2:15:51.280 --> 2:15:53.280
 of war in two ways. One is like

2:15:53.280 --> 2:15:55.280
 remember when we were talking about this really simple

2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:57.280
 strategic game where

2:15:57.280 --> 2:15:59.280
 whether Russia and Ukraine or whatever

2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:01.280
 any two rivals

2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:03.280
 I want more of the pie than

2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:05.280
 you get and

2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:07.280
 the costs of war are deterrents

2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:09.280
 but only the cost

2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:11.280
 of war that I feel

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:13.280
 right? I don't care. I do not

2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:15.280
 care about the cost of war to your side

2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:17.280
 my rival side. I'm not even thinking of that

2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:19.280
 that's just worth zero to me. I just don't care

2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:21.280
 in that simple game. Now in reality

2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:23.280
 many

2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:25.280
 groups do care about the well being of the other group

2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:27.280
 at least a little bit right?

2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:29.280
 We're in some sense to the degree we

2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:31.280
 first of all if our interests are intertwined

2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:33.280
 like our economies are intertwined

2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:35.280
 that

2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:37.280
 that's not a surefire

2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:39.280
 way for peace

2:16:39.280 --> 2:16:41.280
 and we shouldn't get complacent because we have

2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:43.280
 a globally integrated world but that's going to be a disincentive

2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:45.280
 and if we're socially entwined

2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:47.280
 because we have great social relationships

2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:49.280
 and linkages and family or

2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:51.280
 we're intermarriage or whatever this is all these

2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:53.280
 things will

2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:55.280
 help and then if we're ideologically

2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:57.280
 intertwined maybe we share a

2:16:57.280 --> 2:16:59.280
 notions of liberty or maybe we just share

2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:01.280
 a common notion of humanity so I think

2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:03.280
 the fact that we're more integrated than we've ever

2:17:03.280 --> 2:17:05.280
 been on all three fronts in the world

2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:07.280
 but with China is

2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:09.280
 providing some insulation which is good

2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:11.280
 so I would be more

2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:13.280
 worried if we started to shed

2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:15.280
 some of that insulation which I think

2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:17.280
 has been happening a little bit

2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:19.280
 US economic nationalism

2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:23.280
 whatever could be the fallout

2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:25.280
 of these sanctions or a closer Chinese

2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:27.280
 alliance with Russia all those things

2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:29.280
 could happen those would make me more

2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:31.280
 worried because I think we've got a lot of cushion

2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:33.280
 that comes from all of this

2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:35.280
 economics, social, cultural

2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:37.280
 interdependence

2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:39.280
 Social one with the internet is a big one so

2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:41.280
 basically make friends

2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:43.280
 with the people from different nations

2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:45.280
 fall in love

2:17:45.280 --> 2:17:47.280
 or you don't have to fall in love you can just

2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:49.280
 have lots of sex with people from different

2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:51.280
 nations but also fall in love

2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:53.280
 the thing that also should comforts me about

2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:55.280
 China is that they

2:17:55.280 --> 2:17:57.280
 China is not as centralized

2:17:57.280 --> 2:17:59.280
 or as personalized

2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:01.280
 regime as Russia for example

2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:03.280
 and neither one of them is as centralized

2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:05.280
 as like a some tin pot

2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:07.280
 purely personalized dictatorship

2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:09.280
 like you get in some countries

2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:11.280
 the fact that China

2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:13.280
 the power is much more widely shared

2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:15.280
 is

2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:17.280
 a big insulation I think against this war

2:18:17.280 --> 2:18:19.280
 the future war

2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:21.280
 the

2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:23.280
 the attempts

2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:25.280
 by Xi Jinping to personalize

2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:27.280
 power over time and to make

2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:29.280
 China a more centralized and

2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:31.280
 personal ruled place which

2:18:31.280 --> 2:18:33.280
 is he's successfully

2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:35.280
 moved in that direction also worries me

2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:37.280
 so anything that

2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:39.280
 moves China in the other direction not

2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:41.280
 necessarily being democratic but just like a

2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:43.280
 wider and wider group of people

2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:45.280
 holding power like all of

2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:47.280
 the business leaders and all the things that

2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:49.280
 happened in the last few centuries have actually

2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:51.280
 widened power but anything that's moving

2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:53.280
 in the other direction does worry me

2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:55.280
 because it's going to accentuate all these

2:18:55.280 --> 2:18:57.280
 five risks. I am worried about the

2:18:57.280 --> 2:18:59.280
 little bit of the demonization so

2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:01.280
 one of the things

2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:03.280
 I see with China

2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:05.280
 as a problem for Americans

2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:07.280
 maybe I'm projecting

2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:09.280
 maybe it's just my own problem but you know

2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:11.280
 there seems to be a bigger cultural gap

2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:13.280
 than there is with other superpowers throughout history

2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:15.280
 where it's like

2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:17.280
 it's almost like this own world

2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:19.280
 happening in China it's own world in the United States

2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:21.280
 and there's this gap of total cultural understanding

2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:23.280
 like it's not that

2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:27.280
 like we're not

2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:29.280
 competing superpowers they're almost like doing

2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:31.280
 their own thing there's that

2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:33.280
 feeling and I think that means there's

2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:35.280
 a lack of understanding of culture of people

2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:37.280
 and we need to kind of bridge that understanding

2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:39.280
 I mean you know the language barrier

2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:41.280
 but also cultural understanding making

2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:43.280
 movies that's

2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:45.280
 that you use

2:19:45.280 --> 2:19:47.280
 both and explore both cultures and

2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:49.280
 all that kind of stuff to where like it's

2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:51.280
 okay to compete you know like Rocky

2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:53.280
 where

2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:55.280
 Rocky Balboa fought the Russian

2:19:55.280 --> 2:19:57.280
 fact you know

2:19:57.280 --> 2:19:59.280
 historically inaccurate because obviously the Russian

2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:01.280
 win but you know we have to

2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:03.280
 I'm just getting as an affiliate person

2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:05.280
 I was of course reading for Rocky but the thing is

2:20:05.280 --> 2:20:07.280
 those two superpowers are in the movies

2:20:07.280 --> 2:20:09.280
 China is like its own

2:20:09.280 --> 2:20:11.280
 out there thing

2:20:11.280 --> 2:20:13.280
 we need more Rocky 7

2:20:13.280 --> 2:20:15.280
 I do think there's a certain

2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:17.280
 inscrutability to the politics there and an

2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:19.280
 insularity to the politics such that it's

2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:21.280
 harder for Westerners even if they

2:20:21.280 --> 2:20:23.280
 know even just to learn about it and

2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:25.280
 understand what's going on that I think that's a problem

2:20:25.280 --> 2:20:27.280
 and vice versa

2:20:27.280 --> 2:20:29.280
 so I think that's

2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:31.280
 true but I at the same time

2:20:31.280 --> 2:20:33.280
 we could point to all sorts of things on the other side of the ledger

2:20:33.280 --> 2:20:35.280
 like the massive amounts of

2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:37.280
 Chinese immigration into the

2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:39.280
 United States and the massive number of

2:20:39.280 --> 2:20:41.280
 people who are now like how many

2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:43.280
 so many more Americans business

2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:45.280
 people politicians understand

2:20:45.280 --> 2:20:47.280
 so much more about China now

2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:49.280
 than they did 30 40 years ago because

2:20:49.280 --> 2:20:51.280
 we're so intertwined so so I don't know

2:20:51.280 --> 2:20:53.280
 where where it balances out I think it balances

2:20:53.280 --> 2:20:55.280
 out on better understanding than ever before

2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:57.280
 but you're right

2:20:57.280 --> 2:20:59.280
 there was like a big gulf there

2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:01.280
 that we haven't totally bridged

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:03.280
 yeah and

2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:05.280
 like I said lots of

2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:07.280
 inter Chinese and United

2:21:07.280 --> 2:21:09.280
 States sexual intercourse

2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:11.280
 no and love and marriage and all

2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:13.280
 that kind of social social cohesion

2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:15.280
 so once again returning

2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:17.280
 to love I read

2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:19.280
 in your acknowledgement and as

2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:21.280
 you mentioned earlier the acknowledgement

2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:23.280
 reads quote

2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:25.280
 I dedicate this book to a

2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:27.280
 slow and all defunct internet

2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:29.280
 cafe in Nairobi

2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:31.280
 because it set me on the path to meet

2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:33.280
 work with and

2:21:33.280 --> 2:21:35.280
 most importantly Mary

2:21:35.280 --> 2:21:37.280
 Jenny

2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:39.280
 and on

2:21:39.280 --> 2:21:41.280
 and there's a lot

2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:43.280
 a lot of beautiful letters in this beautiful

2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:45.280
 name this book have been

2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:47.280
 impossible without her

2:21:47.280 --> 2:21:49.280
 and that chance encounter

2:21:49.280 --> 2:21:51.280
 what's okay tell me

2:21:51.280 --> 2:21:53.280
 tell me Chris how you

2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:55.280
 fell in love and how that changed the

2:21:55.280 --> 2:21:57.280
 direction of your life I was in that

2:21:57.280 --> 2:21:59.280
 internet cafe I think it was 2004

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:01.280
 I'd

2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:03.280
 I was I didn't know what I wanted to do

2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:05.280
 I thought I might I thought you know

2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:07.280
 I was a good development economist I cared

2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:09.280
 about growth economic growth

2:22:09.280 --> 2:22:11.280
 and I thought firm like industrialization

2:22:11.280 --> 2:22:13.280
 is like the solution to

2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:15.280
 poverty in Africa which is I think

2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:17.280
 still still true

2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:19.280
 and therefore I need to go study firms

2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:21.280
 and industry in Africa

2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:23.280
 and so I went and I ended one of the most dynamic

2:22:23.280 --> 2:22:25.280
 place for firms and industry at the time

2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:27.280
 still to some extent now is was Kenya

2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:29.280
 and the all these firms around Nairobi

2:22:29.280 --> 2:22:31.280
 and so I went and I got a

2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:33.280
 job with the World Bank who's running a

2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:35.280
 they're running a firm survey and I convinced

2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:37.280
 them to like let me help run the firm

2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:39.280
 survey because and so now I'm in Nairobi

2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:41.280
 and I'm wearing my like suit and with the

2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:43.280
 World Bank for the summer

2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:45.280
 and my laptop

2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:47.280
 gets stolen by two enterprising

2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:49.280
 con artists very charming

2:22:49.280 --> 2:22:51.280
 and so I find myself in

2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:53.280
 a cafe with

2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:55.280
 no laptop with no laptop and

2:22:55.280 --> 2:22:57.280
 just like you know this can you

2:22:57.280 --> 2:22:59.280
 didn't exactly can you didn't get connected

2:22:59.280 --> 2:23:01.280
 to the

2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:03.280
 the sort of the big internet

2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:05.280
 cables until maybe 10 years later

2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:07.280
 and so it was just glacially slow so it would take

2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:09.280
 10 minutes for every email to load and so

2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:11.280
 there's this whole customer norm if you just chat

2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:13.280
 to the next person

2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:15.280
 in beside you all the time it was

2:23:15.280 --> 2:23:17.280
 it was true all over anywhere

2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:19.280
 I'd worked on the continent and

2:23:19.280 --> 2:23:21.280
 and I so I strategically

2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:23.280
 sat next to the attractive looking woman that

2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:25.280
 when I came in and

2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:27.280
 and it turned out she was a

2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:29.280
 psychologist I've been a PhD student

2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:31.280
 but she was a humanitarian worker and

2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:33.280
 she'd been working in South Sudan and northern

2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:35.280
 Uganda and this

2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:37.280
 kids affected by this war all these kids who are

2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:39.280
 being conscripted we're coming back

2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:41.280
 because they're all running away after

2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:43.280
 a day or 10 years and

2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:45.280
 needed help or to get back into school

2:23:45.280 --> 2:23:47.280
 she was working on things like that

2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:49.280
 and and I think

2:23:49.280 --> 2:23:51.280
 she talked to me in spite of the fact that I was wearing a suit

2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:53.280
 maybe because I knew a little bit about the war

2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:55.280
 which most people didn't most people were totally ignorant

2:23:55.280 --> 2:23:57.280
 and we we had a fling for that

2:23:57.280 --> 2:23:59.280
 week and then we

2:23:59.280 --> 2:24:01.280
 didn't really we actually then we met up

2:24:01.280 --> 2:24:03.280
 a little short while later and then it was

2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:05.280
 kind of then we kind of drifted apart she was

2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:07.280
 studying in Indiana and spending a lot of time

2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:09.280
 in Uganda

2:24:09.280 --> 2:24:11.280
 and then one day

2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:13.280
 I was chatting

2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:15.280
 with someone I knew who worked on this

2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:17.280
 young professor who was friend

2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:19.280
 of mine but and I said oh you know

2:24:19.280 --> 2:24:21.280
 you work on similar issues you should meet this

2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:23.280
 woman I talked to the

2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:25.280
 she like you guys would have like you know professional

2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:27.280
 research interests overlap there's so few

2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:29.280
 sort of people looking at armed groups

2:24:29.280 --> 2:24:31.280
 in African civil wars at least at the time

2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:33.280
 and he said wow that's a fascinating

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:35.280
 research

2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:37.280
 question and I thought and I walked out of the

2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:39.280
 building and I thought

2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:41.280
 is a fascinating research question and I

2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:43.280
 phoned Jeannie and I

2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:45.280
 and I said remember me and you know tell me

2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:47.280
 more I was just talking to someone with this tell me more

2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:49.280
 like I started asking her more questions

2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:51.280
 but we ended up talking for two or three hours

2:24:51.280 --> 2:24:53.280
 and over

2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:55.280
 the course of those three hours we hatched

2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:57.280
 a very

2:24:57.280 --> 2:24:59.280
 ambitious kind of crazy

2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:01.280
 and like

2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:03.280
 plan we basically what it was

2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:05.280
 we were going to like find

2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:07.280
 the names and all the kids were born

2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:09.280
 like 20 or 30 years ago

2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:11.280
 in the region and we were going to

2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:13.280
 track a thousand of them that we're going to

2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:15.280
 randomly sample them and then we're going to find them today

2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:17.280
 and we're going to track them and then we were going

2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:19.280
 to use like some variation

2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:21.280
 exposure to violence and where the rebel group was

2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:23.280
 to actually like show what happens

2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:25.280
 to people when they're exposed to violence and conscription

2:25:25.280 --> 2:25:27.280
 we were going to like tell you know psychologically

2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:29.280
 economically we're going to like answer questions

2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:31.280
 and that which would help you design better

2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:33.280
 programs right and so we hatched this plan

2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:35.280
 which is totally cockamamie

2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:37.280
 so cockamamie that when

2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:39.280
 I pulled my previous

2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:41.280
 dissertation proposal from

2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:43.280
 my committee like the next week and gave them

2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:45.280
 a new one

2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:47.280
 they unanimously met without

2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:49.280
 me to decide that this was totally

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:51.280
 bonkers

2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:53.280
 and to advise me not to go

2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:55.280
 and they coordinated to read my old proposal so that

2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:57.280
 when I showed up for my defense they said you actually

2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:59.280
 think you're defending but we were actually we want

2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:01.280
 you to only talk about this other thing you were going to do

2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:03.280
 because this is like you should not go

2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:05.280
 oh wow

2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:07.280
 and I mean it is incredibly ambitious super

2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:09.280
 interesting though it actually worked exactly

2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:11.280
 according to plants the first and last time

2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:13.280
 in my entire career you actually pulled off

2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:15.280
 an ambition like a gigantically crazy

2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:17.280
 well all of my work that's my

2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:19.280
 stick like my day to day research job is not

2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:21.280
 writing books but why we fight my thing

2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:23.280
 is like I go I collect

2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:25.280
 data on things that nobody else thought you could

2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:27.280
 collect data on and so I always

2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:29.280
 do pull it off but it never turns out

2:26:29.280 --> 2:26:31.280
 like I thought it was going to like

2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:33.280
 it's always there's so many twists and turns and always

2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:35.280
 goes sideways in an interesting

2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:37.280
 way and it works but it's all but this one

2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:39.280
 actually we pulled off in spite of

2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:41.280
 ourselves and as

2:26:41.280 --> 2:26:43.280
 planned and

2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:45.280
 and so Ted Miguel who I wrote that paper with was actually

2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:47.280
 the one person of my

2:26:47.280 --> 2:26:49.280
 advisor who was like well

2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:51.280
 you know what he's he was sympathetic to this he was like

2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:53.280
 yeah why don't you just go for a couple

2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:55.280
 months and like check it out and then come back

2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:57.280
 and work on the other thing and that's and so

2:26:57.280 --> 2:26:59.280
 I followed Jeannie there and went there and then

2:26:59.280 --> 2:27:01.280
 she but and

2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:03.280
 I don't know what's this I always remember

2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:05.280
 you know this movie Speed the

2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:07.280
 Ken Reeves and

2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:09.280
 and Sandra whatever these people are and

2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:11.280
 they have this relationship in these intense

2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:13.280
 circumstances and they're like well and I think

2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:15.280
 at the end of the movie they're sort of like this will never

2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:17.280
 work because these relationships in intense

2:27:17.280 --> 2:27:19.280
 circumstances never matter which is what we assumed

2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:21.280
 and that

2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:23.280
 does not be true so we've been married

2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:25.280
 15 years and with two kids

2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:27.280
 and yeah and that's when you fell in love

2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:29.280
 with psychology and don't appreciate

2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:31.280
 the power of psychology exactly

2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:33.280
 that's the psychology in the book as well because

2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:35.280
 I and so we ended up we were for most of

2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:37.280
 our work for the first five or ten years was together

2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:39.280
 actually what's the hardest

2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:41.280
 piece of data

2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:43.280
 that you've been

2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:45.280
 chasing that you've chased in your life

2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:47.280
 like what are some interesting things because

2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:49.280
 you mentioned like one of the things you

2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:51.280
 kind of want to go somewhere in the world

2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:53.280
 and find evidence

2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:55.280
 and data for things that people just

2:27:55.280 --> 2:27:57.280
 haven't really looked to get

2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:59.280
 gain an understanding of human nature maybe from

2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:01.280
 an economics perspective what's

2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:03.280
 what what kind of stuff either

2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:05.280
 in your past or in your future you've

2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:07.280
 been thinking about well I mean the hardest

2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:09.280
 the hardest

2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:11.280
 the hardest emotionally was

2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:13.280
 interviewing all those kids in northern Uganda

2:28:13.280 --> 2:28:15.280
 that was just like a gut punch

2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:17.280
 every day

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:19.280
 and just hearing the stories like that

2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:21.280
 was the hardest but it

2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:23.280
 wasn't hard because it was you could the kids

2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:25.280
 were everywhere and everybody would talk to you about it

2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:27.280
 and they could talk about it you could

2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:29.280
 no one had gone and interviewed

2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:31.280
 kids that had gone through war

2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:33.280
 in the middle of an active war zone nobody was going to

2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:35.280
 displace all the things we did no one had done that before

2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:37.280
 so now lots of people do it

2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:39.280
 could you actually speak to their

2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:43.280
 their stories what what's

2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:45.280
 like the shape of their suffering

2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:47.280
 what

2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:49.280
 what were common themes

2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:51.280
 what how did that those

2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:53.280
 stories change you

2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:55.280
 I remember I said you can give you like your

2:28:55.280 --> 2:28:57.280
 dispassion itself and your

2:28:57.280 --> 2:28:59.280
 passion itself I think

2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:01.280
 I had to learn to create the dispassion itself

2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:03.280
 I mean we all have that capacity when we analyze

2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:05.280
 something that's far away and happens to people

2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:07.280
 different than us but you have to

2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:09.280
 I think I

2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:11.280
 discovered and developed

2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:13.280
 an ability to like

2:29:13.280 --> 2:29:15.280
 put those aside in order to be able to study this

2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:17.280
 so you get

2:29:17.280 --> 2:29:19.280
 maybe harder in a way that you have to

2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:21.280
 be guard against so you have to

2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:23.280
 try to remember to put your human head on

2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:25.280
 it's really horrible like if I

2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:27.280
 want to conscript you

2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:29.280
 and I don't want you to run away

2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:31.280
 then I want to make you think you can never go

2:29:31.280 --> 2:29:33.280
 back to your village

2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:35.280
 and the best way for me to do that

2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:37.280
 is for to make you force you to do something

2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:39.280
 really really really

2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:41.280
 really horrible that you could you almost

2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:43.280
 incredibly believe you can never really go

2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:45.280
 back and it might be like killing

2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:47.280
 a loved one and so

2:29:47.280 --> 2:29:49.280
 and just having hearing people

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:51.280
 tell you that story

2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:53.280
 in all the different shapes

2:29:53.280 --> 2:29:55.280
 and forms to point what was

2:29:55.280 --> 2:29:57.280
 horrible about it is they did this so routinely

2:29:57.280 --> 2:29:59.280
 that you'd be sitting there in an interview

2:29:59.280 --> 2:30:01.280
 with somebody and they'd be telling

2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:03.280
 you the story and it's like the most horrible

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:05.280
 thing that could happen to you or anyone else

2:30:05.280 --> 2:30:07.280
 and but there's some

2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:09.280
 voice in the back of your mind saying okay

2:30:09.280 --> 2:30:11.280
 we

2:30:11.280 --> 2:30:13.280
 really need to get to the other thing

2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:15.280
 you know we know that I know how this goes

2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:17.280
 like I've heard you know there's this thing like okay okay

2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:19.280
 I'm not learning anything new here

2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:21.280
 like there's some part you know

2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:23.280
 deep evil terrible part of you that's like yeah yeah

2:30:23.280 --> 2:30:25.280
 yeah like but let's get

2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:27.280
 on to the other thing but I know I have to go through this

2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:29.280
 but every day you have to go through that to get to the

2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:31.280
 because you're trying to actually understand how to help

2:30:31.280 --> 2:30:33.280
 people you're trying to understand how that trauma

2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:35.280
 has manifested how they either some people get stronger

2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:37.280
 as a result of that some people get weaker

2:30:37.280 --> 2:30:39.280
 and if you want to know how to help people

2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:41.280
 then you need to get to that I wasn't trying

2:30:41.280 --> 2:30:43.280
 to get to something for my selfish purposes really

2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:45.280
 I was trying to figure out okay we need to know

2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:47.280
 what your symptoms are now it's a dark

2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:49.280
 thing about us

2:30:49.280 --> 2:30:51.280
 so if you're surrounded by trauma

2:30:53.280 --> 2:30:55.280
 God that voice in the back of your

2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:57.280
 head that you just go yeah I know exactly

2:30:57.280 --> 2:30:59.280
 how this conversation goes let's skip ahead

2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:01.280
 to the to the solutions

2:31:01.280 --> 2:31:03.280
 to the next yeah

2:31:03.280 --> 2:31:05.280
 and that was that was yeah so that was

2:31:05.280 --> 2:31:07.280
 because you then have to deal with yourself so it's very

2:31:07.280 --> 2:31:09.280
 helpful if you like come home every night to

2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:11.280
 someone who's a gone through the same thing and be

2:31:11.280 --> 2:31:13.280
 as a professional and very very very

2:31:13.280 --> 2:31:15.280
 very good counseling psychologist

2:31:17.280 --> 2:31:19.280
 the

2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:21.280
 the hardest thing I mean this the

2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:23.280
 organized crime stuff has been the hardest

2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:25.280
 just figuring out how to get that information

2:31:25.280 --> 2:31:27.280
 took us years of just trial

2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:29.280
 and error mostly error of like just how

2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:31.280
 to get people to talk to us

2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:33.280
 or how to collect data in a

2:31:33.280 --> 2:31:35.280
 way that's safe for me and safe

2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:37.280
 for my team and safe

2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:39.280
 for people to answer a survey like how do you

2:31:39.280 --> 2:31:41.280
 get how do you get

2:31:41.280 --> 2:31:43.280
 the information on

2:31:43.280 --> 2:31:45.280
 what gangs are doing in the

2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:47.280
 community or how it's hurting or

2:31:47.280 --> 2:31:49.280
 helping people like you've got to run surveys

2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:51.280
 and you've got to talk to gang members all these things

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:53.280
 that nobody knows how to do that

2:31:53.280 --> 2:31:55.280
 and so we had to sort of really slowly

2:31:55.280 --> 2:31:57.280
 not nobody there's a few other think there's

2:31:57.280 --> 2:31:59.280
 other academics like me who are doing this

2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:01.280
 but there's a pretty small group

2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:03.280
 that's trying to like collect

2:32:03.280 --> 2:32:05.280
 systematic data and then there's

2:32:05.280 --> 2:32:07.280
 a slightly bigger and much

2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:09.280
 more experienced group that's been talking to

2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:11.280
 different armed groups but every

2:32:11.280 --> 2:32:13.280
 time you go to a new city and there weren't that many

2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:15.280
 people working on this in Medellin there were a few

2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:17.280
 you have to like discover a new

2:32:17.280 --> 2:32:19.280
 like it's really going to unique to that city

2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:21.280
 in place so there's not

2:32:21.280 --> 2:32:23.280
 there's not like a website for

2:32:23.280 --> 2:32:25.280
 each of the 17 mafia groups

2:32:25.280 --> 2:32:27.280
 there's no Facebook group in Indiana

2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:29.280
 well there is now we have a we've created like our own

2:32:29.280 --> 2:32:31.280
 we have a private wiki where

2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:33.280
 we document everything and it's a collaborative enterprise

2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:35.280
 between lots of researchers and journalists

2:32:35.280 --> 2:32:37.280
 and things so they now they can't see you can't go

2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:39.280
 online and see this and that's that's individual

2:32:39.280 --> 2:32:41.280
 researchers it's not I mean they're

2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:43.280
 yeah hiding by design some of them

2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:45.280
 have Facebook pages and things of this nature

2:32:45.280 --> 2:32:47.280
 so they do have public profiles a little bit but not

2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:49.280
 not not so explicitly

2:32:49.280 --> 2:32:51.280
 no so they're clandestine here's an example

2:32:51.280 --> 2:32:53.280
 so one of the things that's really endemic in

2:32:53.280 --> 2:32:55.280
 Medellin it's true in a lot of cities

2:32:55.280 --> 2:32:57.280
 it's true in American prisons is gangs

2:32:57.280 --> 2:32:59.280
 govern everybody's everyday life

2:32:59.280 --> 2:33:01.280
 so if you have a

2:33:01.280 --> 2:33:03.280
 in an American prison particularly

2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:05.280
 Illinois or California Texas is another big one

2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:07.280
 but also

2:33:07.280 --> 2:33:09.280
 in a city in Medellin if you have

2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:11.280
 a problem

2:33:11.280 --> 2:33:13.280
 a debt to collect or dispute with a neighbor

2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:15.280
 or something you could go to the government

2:33:15.280 --> 2:33:17.280
 and they do and they can help you

2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:19.280
 solve it or you go to the police or you can go to the gang

2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:21.280
 and so

2:33:21.280 --> 2:33:23.280
 and that's like a really everyday phenomenon

2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:25.280
 but then then there's a question like how do you actually

2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:27.280
 how do you actually

2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:29.280
 figure out how what services they're offering

2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:31.280
 and how much they pay for them and do you actually

2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:33.280
 like those services and how do they how do you

2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:35.280
 comparison shop between

2:33:35.280 --> 2:33:37.280
 the police and the gang

2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:39.280
 and what would get you to go from

2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:41.280
 the gang to the police and then how's the gang

2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:43.280
 strategically going to respond to that

2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:45.280
 and what was the impact of previous policies

2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:47.280
 to like make

2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:49.280
 state governing better and how did the gangs react

2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:51.280
 and so that's we had to sort of figure that out

2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:53.280
 and that that was

2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:55.280
 so that was just hard in a different way but I don't do the

2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:57.280
 most they're mostly punishing stuff I couldn't do any longer

2:33:57.280 --> 2:33:59.280
 so that's much easier

2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:01.280
 in that sense

2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:03.280
 by the way and

2:34:03.280 --> 2:34:05.280
 you know Jorge Cho as some of these

2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:07.280
 folks are out of prison yeah have you got a chance

2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:09.280
 to talk nobody

2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:11.280
 one of my collaborators on this guy named

2:34:11.280 --> 2:34:13.280
 Gustavo Duncan who's

2:34:13.280 --> 2:34:15.280
 spent a lot of time interviewing

2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:17.280
 pair militaries has written a book he's

2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:19.280
 talked to more of these people than I

2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:21.280
 have I haven't talked to

2:34:21.280 --> 2:34:23.280
 those

2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:25.280
 we haven't been talking to them about this

2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:27.280
 but also they were they were there in a different

2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:29.280
 era yeah so it doesn't the system

2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:31.280
 was totally different that's super interesting maybe one

2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:33.280
 day we'll do that we're trying to industry yeah

2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:35.280
 if that was 30 years ago

2:34:35.280 --> 2:34:37.280
 yeah and the system over

2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:39.280
 I mean La Oficina Pablo Escobar

2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:41.280
 created La Oficina he integrated

2:34:41.280 --> 2:34:43.280
 what's what the all these 17

2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:45.280
 the Rosones and all these street gangs are the

2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:47.280
 fragmented former remnants of his more

2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:49.280
 unified empire which he gave

2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:51.280
 the name La Oficina I mean the

2:34:51.280 --> 2:34:53.280
 I think you know it's a little bit apocryphal

2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:55.280
 but it the idea is you know I think he said

2:34:55.280 --> 2:34:57.280
 every doctor has an office

2:34:57.280 --> 2:34:59.280
 so should we

2:34:59.280 --> 2:35:01.280
 I still can

2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:03.280
 I still love that there's parallels

2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:05.280
 between these

2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:07.280
 mafia groups and the United Nations

2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:09.280
 yeah Security Council

2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:11.280
 this is just wonderful so so

2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:13.280
 so deeply human

2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:15.280
 let me ask you about yourself so

2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:17.280
 you've been thinking about war

2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:19.280
 here in part dispassionately

2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:21.280
 just analyze

2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:23.280
 war and try to understand

2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:25.280
 the path for peace but you as a single individual

2:35:27.280 --> 2:35:29.280
 that's going to die one day

2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:31.280
 maybe talking to

2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:35.280
 the people that have gone through suffering what

2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:37.280
 do you think about your own mortality

2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:41.280
 how has your view of

2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:43.280
 your own finiteness changed

2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:45.280
 haven't thought about war

2:35:45.280 --> 2:35:47.280
 maybe the reason I can do this work is because

2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:49.280
 I don't think about it a lot

2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:51.280
 your own mortality or even like

2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:53.280
 mortality

2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:55.280
 yeah I mean well I have to think about death a lot

2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:57.280
 so

2:35:57.280 --> 2:35:59.280
 but there's a way to think about death like

2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:01.280
 numbers in a calculation

2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:03.280
 when you're doing geopolitical negotiations

2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:05.280
 and then there's like

2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:07.280
 a dying child

2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:09.280
 or a dying mother

2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:11.280
 yeah I guess I know

2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:13.280
 I'm in a place where there's risk and so I

2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:15.280
 think a lot about

2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:17.280
 minimizing

2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:19.280
 any risk such that I

2:36:19.280 --> 2:36:21.280
 I think I think about mortality enough that I

2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:23.280
 just

2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:25.280
 because I'm kind of an anxious person

2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:27.280
 and so like I'm kind of a worry ward

2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:29.280
 like in a way

2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:31.280
 and so I'm really

2:36:31.280 --> 2:36:33.280
 obsessive about

2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:35.280
 making sure anything that I do is low

2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:37.280
 risk you know

2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:39.280
 that gives you something to focus on

2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:41.280
 a number is the risk and you're trying

2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:43.280
 to minimize it

2:36:43.280 --> 2:36:45.280
 and yet there's still the existential dread

2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:47.280
 your risk

2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:49.280
 minimization doesn't matter

2:36:49.280 --> 2:36:51.280
 yeah I've never been in a life

2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:53.280
 threatening situation

2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:57.280
 that's somebody who you know what you sound like

2:36:57.280 --> 2:36:59.280
 that's Alex Honnold that does the

2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:01.280
 free climbing

2:37:01.280 --> 2:37:03.280
 he doesn't see that as like

2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:05.280
 sounds exactly the same

2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:07.280
 because you just said I've never done anything

2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:09.280
 as dangerous as those people right

2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:11.280
 right so I've actually been

2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:13.280
 a rock climber for like 25 years with

2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:15.280
 a long break in the between

2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:17.280
 but I'm the same way you know actually

2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:19.280
 rock climbing is an extremely safe sport

2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:21.280
 if you're very careful

2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:23.280
 but he's free climbing is the opposite of that

2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:25.280
 but I mean like if you're like you've got a

2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:27.280
 rope that's attached to you that goes

2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:29.280
 up is like attached to 18 trees

2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:31.280
 and comes back down

2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:33.280
 you're you're fine like this you know

2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:35.280
 anywhere helmet you're good

2:37:35.280 --> 2:37:37.280
 you're totally fine yeah but

2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:39.280
 this is super safe too because

2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:41.280
 don't free climbing no no no we're watching

2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:43.280
 free climbing I mean

2:37:43.280 --> 2:37:45.280
 because you're only going to put your hands

2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:47.280
 and feet on sturdy rock and

2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:49.280
 and then you know the path and

2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:51.280
 no no no no

2:37:51.280 --> 2:37:53.280
 I know I know some

2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:55.280
 I have some friends in college

2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:57.280
 known people who do some of these

2:37:57.280 --> 2:37:59.280
 totally wacky extreme sports and have paid

2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:01.280
 the price so

2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:03.280
 I think it's totally

2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:05.280
 totally different I think

2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:07.280
 so even in that

2:38:07.280 --> 2:38:09.280
 by the way this I can't even watch those movies

2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:11.280
 because those freak me out too much because it's just too risky

2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:13.280
 like I can't I don't even

2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:15.280
 yeah so those things I've never

2:38:15.280 --> 2:38:17.280
 watched like free solo or anything there's just

2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:19.280
 too much still not as

2:38:19.280 --> 2:38:21.280
 dangerous as riding a scooter and all

2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:23.280
 I'm not gonna let that go

2:38:23.280 --> 2:38:25.280
 so but even in that

2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:27.280
 it's just a risk minimization

2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:29.280
 in the work that you do versus

2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:31.280
 the sort of philosophical

2:38:31.280 --> 2:38:33.280
 existentialist

2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:35.280
 view of your mortality you know this

2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:37.280
 like this thing just ends

2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:39.280
 like what the hell is that about

2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:41.280
 yeah I have this amazing capacity

2:38:41.280 --> 2:38:43.280
 not to think about it which might just be a self defense mechanism

2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:45.280
 you know my father in law

2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:47.280
 Genie's father is an evangelical

2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:49.280
 pastor actually he's now retired but

2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:51.280
 um and

2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:53.280
 this he would we would talk about

2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:55.280
 when we're getting married they weren't terribly thrilled

2:38:55.280 --> 2:38:57.280
 that she was

2:38:57.280 --> 2:38:59.280
 uh marrying a agnostic

2:38:59.280 --> 2:39:01.280
 atheist or something we love each other

2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:03.280
 very much it's fine now but

2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:05.280
 I only started discussing this and some of the

2:39:05.280 --> 2:39:07.280
 because that was one of his questions for me

2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:09.280
 like well how can you possibly believe

2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:11.280
 that there's nothing afterwards

2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:13.280
 because that's just like too horrible

2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:15.280
 to imagine and we

2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:17.280
 we really never saw eye to eye on this and my

2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:19.280
 view was like listen like

2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:21.280
 I can't convince myself I believe what I'd like

2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:23.280
 I can't convince myself otherwise anything else seems

2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:25.280
 completely implausal to me

2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:27.280
 and for some reason I can't understand

2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:29.280
 I'm at peace with that like it's never bothered

2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:31.280
 me that one day it's over

2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:33.280
 and and I understood the fact

2:39:33.280 --> 2:39:35.280
 that people have angst about

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:37.280
 that and that they would seek answers

2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:39.280
 makes total sense to me

2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:41.280
 and and I can't explain why

2:39:41.280 --> 2:39:43.280
 that doesn't consume me

2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:45.280
 or doesn't bother me

2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:47.280
 um but and yet

2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:49.280
 you are at peace

2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:51.280
 yep maybe if I was worried

2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:53.280
 but if I was more worried about it maybe I wouldn't be able to do

2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:55.280
 I don't know I don't know but I then again

2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:57.280
 I don't take the risk I'm still like I don't know

2:39:57.280 --> 2:39:59.280
 but I minimize all sorts of risks I'm like

2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:01.280
 I

2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:03.280
 yeah I minimize

2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:05.280
 you know I try to optimize

2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:07.280
 like groceries in the fridge too like I mean

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:09.280
 I put very

2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:11.280
 way to live I would say

2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:13.280
 that's probably why you're good at that might be true

2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:15.280
 that might be there's some selection and economics

2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:17.280
 of these cold calculators

2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:19.280
 chicken or the egg we'll never know

2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:21.280
 do you have advice for young people

2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:23.280
 that want to do as ambitious

2:40:23.280 --> 2:40:25.280
 as crazy as

2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:27.280
 amazing of work as you have done

2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:29.280
 in life so somebody who's in

2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:31.280
 high school and college

2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:33.280
 either career advice

2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:35.280
 on what to choose how to

2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:37.280
 execute on it or just life advice

2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:39.280
 how to meet

2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:41.280
 some random stranger or maybe a dating advice

2:40:41.280 --> 2:40:43.280
 how to

2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:45.280
 that part's easy you have to fly coach

2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:47.280
 and go to the internet cafes

2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:49.280
 you can't like yeah all the development

2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:51.280
 workers that I know that fly business class

2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:53.280
 and like you'll never meet somebody

2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:55.280
 no the you know I

2:40:55.280 --> 2:40:57.280
 actually spent a lot of time writing advice on my

2:40:57.280 --> 2:40:59.280
 blog and I've got like pages and pages of

2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:01.280
 advice and one of the reasons is because I

2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:03.280
 never got that like when I grew up I went to

2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:05.280
 like a really good state school in

2:41:05.280 --> 2:41:07.280
 Canada called Waterloo I loved

2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:09.280
 it but people didn't go on the trajectory

2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:11.280
 that I went on from there and

2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:13.280
 I had some good advisors there but

2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:15.280
 but I never got the kind of advice I needed

2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:17.280
 to like pursue this career so I

2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:19.280
 it's very

2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:21.280
 concentrated in elite colleges I think

2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:23.280
 sometimes in elite high schools so I

2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:25.280
 tried to democratize that that's like a that

2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:27.280
 was one reason I started the blog

2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:29.280
 but a lot of that's really particular because I every week

2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:31.280
 like I have students coming in my office wanting to

2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:33.280
 know how to do international development work and I just spent a lot of time

2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:35.280
 giving them advice and I think that's what a

2:41:35.280 --> 2:41:37.280
 lot of the posts are about they have every specific

2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:39.280
 questions like what is it that country by

2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:41.280
 country kind of specific questions or what

2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:43.280
 the thing that they're all trying to do that I think is the right I don't

2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:45.280
 have to give them a really basic piece of advice because

2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:47.280
 they're already doing it like they're trying to

2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:49.280
 find a vocation they they they're

2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:51.280
 really interested and what I mean by that

2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:53.280
 is it's like a career where they find meaning

2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:55.280
 where the work is almost

2:41:55.280 --> 2:41:57.280
 like superfluous because that they just

2:41:57.280 --> 2:41:59.280
 and they would do it for free

2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:01.280
 and they're passionate about and they really find meaning

2:42:01.280 --> 2:42:03.280
 in the work and and

2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:05.280
 and then it becomes a little bit all consuming so

2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:07.280
 scientists do that in their own way I think

2:42:07.280 --> 2:42:09.280
 international development humanitarian workers people

2:42:09.280 --> 2:42:11.280
 who are doctors and nurses like we all

2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:13.280
 do our careers for other reasons right but

2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:15.280
 but they they find like

2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:17.280
 meaning in their career and so the thing

2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:19.280
 so I don't have to tell them

2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:21.280
 whatever you do find meaning

2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:23.280
 and try to make it a vocation

2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:25.280
 something that you would do for free

2:42:25.280 --> 2:42:27.280
 amongst all of these many many many options

2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:29.280
 that's

2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:31.280
 what I would tell but that's what I would tell

2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.280
 high school students and young

2:42:33.280 --> 2:42:35.280
 people in college

2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:37.280
 sometimes it's hard to find

2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:39.280
 a thing and hold on to it

2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:41.280
 well that's the other thing it took me a

2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:43.280
 long time so I actually started off as

2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:45.280
 an accountant I was an accountant with Deloitte and Touche

2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:47.280
 for a few years so I

2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:49.280
 I did not that

2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:51.280
 did you wake up in the morning excited

2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:53.280
 to be alive I was miserable

2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:55.280
 I got I found it by accident

2:42:55.280 --> 2:42:57.280
 which is another different story but I

2:42:57.280 --> 2:42:59.280
 landed in this job and a degree

2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:01.280
 where I study accounting and I was miserable

2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:03.280
 I was totally miserable

2:43:03.280 --> 2:43:05.280
 and I hated it and it was becoming a miserable

2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:07.280
 person

2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:09.280
 and so I eventually just quit

2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:11.280
 and I did something new but I was

2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:13.280
 still you know but then I was working in

2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:15.280
 the private sector and I actually just need

2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:17.280
 trial and error I actually had to try on like three

2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:19.280
 or four or five careers before I found like

2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:21.280
 this mixture of academia and activism

2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:23.280
 and research and international development

2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:25.280
 and so did you know that this

2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:27.280
 was love when you

2:43:27.280 --> 2:43:29.280
 when you found this kind of international development

2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:31.280
 that this was the academic

2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:33.280
 context too the key lesson

2:43:33.280 --> 2:43:35.280
 was just trial and error which we all have to engage in

2:43:35.280 --> 2:43:37.280
 until it feels right it's okay

2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:39.280
 all right step one is trial and error but until it

2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:41.280
 feels right because like

2:43:41.280 --> 2:43:43.280
 it often feels right but not

2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:45.280
 perfect yeah it's true

2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:47.280
 right enough I mean I was really

2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:49.280
 intellectually engaged like I just loved

2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:51.280
 learning about it I wanted to read more like it

2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:53.280
 in some sense like

2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:55.280
 like I was doing I was an accountant but I was reading

2:43:55.280 --> 2:43:57.280
 about like ruled

2:43:57.280 --> 2:43:59.280
 history and international development and poor countries in my spare time

2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:01.280
 right and so it was

2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:03.280
 like this hobby and I was like wait a second I could

2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:05.280
 actually do that like just

2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:07.280
 I could like research just didn't even write

2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:09.280
 the neck those books and that's kind of what I did

2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:11.280
 like 25 years later

2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:13.280
 that didn't occur to me right away I didn't even know it was

2:44:13.280 --> 2:44:15.280
 possible this is the other thing people do

2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:17.280
 people do their 9 to 5 job

2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:19.280
 and then they find meeting and everything else they do

2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:21.280
 they're volunteering and their family and their hobbies

2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:23.280
 and things and that was my social media

2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:25.280
 and and and that's a great

2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:27.280
 path to like I mean that's because not all of us

2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:29.280
 can just have a vocation or you don't find it I think

2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:31.280
 and then you just circumscribe what you do in your

2:44:31.280 --> 2:44:33.280
 work and then you go find

2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:35.280
 um and that's not entirely true because

2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.280
 everyone in my family does like their job

2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:39.280
 and get a lot of fulfillment out of it but

2:44:39.280 --> 2:44:41.280
 um but I think it's not

2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:43.280
 it's that's that's a

2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:45.280
 different path in some ways so it's good to

2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:47.280
 take the leap and keep trying stuff even

2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:49.280
 when you found like a little local

2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:51.280
 local minima yeah

2:44:51.280 --> 2:44:53.280
 the hardest part was

2:44:53.280 --> 2:44:55.280
 it got easy after a while

2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:57.280
 it was was quitting

2:44:57.280 --> 2:44:59.280
 but but now I take this to a lot of you know and

2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:01.280
 one of the people I think

2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:03.280
 one of the reasons I discovered your podcast or maybe

2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:05.280
 Tyler Cowan yeah he's amazing

2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:07.280
 Tyler takes this approach to everything

2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:09.280
 he takes this approach to movie

2:45:09.280 --> 2:45:11.280
 he's like walk to the movie theater

2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:13.280
 after half an hour if you don't like the movie

2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:15.280
 and um

2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:17.280
 you know what kind of person he probably is

2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:19.280
 I don't know but now that you say this

2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:21.280
 he's probably somebody that goes to a restaurant

2:45:21.280 --> 2:45:23.280
 if the if the meals is not good

2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:25.280
 I could see him just walking yeah like

2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:27.280
 paying for and just walking away yeah meal

2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:29.280
 and go eat something better that's exactly

2:45:29.280 --> 2:45:31.280
 right and I thought that was kind of crazy

2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:33.280
 and I'd never I was the person I would never

2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:35.280
 just put a book down halfway and I would

2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:37.280
 never um

2:45:37.280 --> 2:45:39.280
 stop watching a movie but then I and I

2:45:39.280 --> 2:45:41.280
 convinced my wife we lived in New York when we were

2:45:41.280 --> 2:45:43.280
 when we when we're single initially

2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:45.280
 sorry number when we were childless

2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:47.280
 uh and we lived in New York

2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:49.280
 there's all this culture and

2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:51.280
 theater and stuff and I just said let's go to

2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:53.280
 more plays but let's just walk out

2:45:53.280 --> 2:45:55.280
 after the first act if we don't like it and she

2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:57.280
 thought that was a bit crazy and I was like no no no here's

2:45:57.280 --> 2:45:59.280
 the logic here's what Tyler says and then

2:45:59.280 --> 2:46:01.280
 we started doing it and it was so freeing and glorious

2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:03.280
 we just go we take so many more chances on things

2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:05.280
 yeah and we would and if we

2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:07.280
 didn't like it we and we were walking out of stuff all the

2:46:07.280 --> 2:46:09.280
 time um and so

2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:11.280
 I I think I did that we're

2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:13.280
 realizing that that's how I like took I just

2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:15.280
 kept quitting my jobs yeah

2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:17.280
 and trying to find something else that like some risk

2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:19.280
 because that's how war start without the commitment

2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:21.280
 I go

2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:23.280
 time back you need

2:46:23.280 --> 2:46:25.280
 the commitment otherwise

2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:27.280
 uh no that's a different kind of commitment

2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:29.280
 problem that's a different different commitment

2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:31.280
 problem so some of it that I'm sure there's a

2:46:31.280 --> 2:46:33.280
 balance because I mean the same thing is happening

2:46:33.280 --> 2:46:35.280
 with dating and marriage and all those kinds of things

2:46:35.280 --> 2:46:37.280
 and there's some value to sticking

2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:39.280
 it out because some of

2:46:39.280 --> 2:46:41.280
 the like maybe

2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:43.280
 you know don't leave after the first act

2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:45.280
 because the good stuff might be coming

2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:47.280
 yeah that's a good point I mean that's

2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:49.280
 yeah well

2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:51.280
 I don't know so when I met

2:46:51.280 --> 2:46:53.280
 she was very wary of a relationship

2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:55.280
 with me because I explained to her

2:46:55.280 --> 2:46:57.280
 um I hadn't had a relationship

2:46:57.280 --> 2:46:59.280
 longer than two or three months and 11 years

2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:01.280
 and so she thought this person

2:47:01.280 --> 2:47:03.280
 thought serious and what I said to her

2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:05.280
 she tells the story this is how she tells the story she says I

2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:07.280
 didn't believe him when he said that I just after

2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:09.280
 two or three months you kind of have a good sense

2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:11.280
 but whether this is going somewhere and I would

2:47:11.280 --> 2:47:13.280
 just decide if it was over so and I walk

2:47:13.280 --> 2:47:15.280
 away so I took this approach to dating like as soon as I

2:47:15.280 --> 2:47:17.280
 thought it wasn't going to go somewhere

2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:19.280
 and and then I have and then I decided

2:47:19.280 --> 2:47:21.280
 with her that this was it this was going to work

2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:23.280
 and then I like and then never and

2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:25.280
 she didn't believe now she believes me

2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:27.280
 haha

2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:29.280
 finally got to be right

2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:31.280
 okay so this is an incredible conversation

2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:33.280
 your work is so fascinating just in this

2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:35.280
 um

2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:37.280
 big picture way looking at human conflict

2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:39.280
 and how we can achieve peace

2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:41.280
 especially in this time

2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:43.280
 of the Ukraine war I really

2:47:43.280 --> 2:47:45.280
 really appreciate that you

2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:47.280
 calmly speak to me about some of these difficult

2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:49.280
 ideas and explain them and

2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:51.280
 you sit down with me and have this amazing

2:47:51.280 --> 2:47:53.280

2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:05.280
 simple words from Albert Einstein

2:48:05.280 --> 2:48:07.280
 I know not

2:48:07.280 --> 2:48:09.280
 with what weapons world war three will be fought

2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.280
 but world war

2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:13.280
