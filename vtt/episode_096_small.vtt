00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
 The following is a conversation with Steven Schwartzman, CEO and cofounder of Blackstone,

00:05.920 --> 00:13.120
 one of the world's leading investment firms with over $530 billion of assets under management.

00:13.120 --> 00:17.920
 He's one of the most successful business leaders in history.

00:17.920 --> 00:22.720
 I recommend his recent book called What It Takes that tells stories and lessons from

00:22.720 --> 00:24.560
 his personal journey.

00:24.560 --> 00:29.840
 Steven is a philanthropist and one of the wealthiest people in the world, recently signing

00:29.840 --> 00:35.120
 the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to philanthropic causes.

00:35.920 --> 00:43.680
 As an example, in 2018, he donated $350 million to MIT to help establish its new college of

00:43.680 --> 00:49.440
 computing, the mission of which promotes interdisciplinary, big, bold research in

00:49.440 --> 00:50.720
 artificial intelligence.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.560
 For those of you who know me, know that MIT is near and dear to my heart and always will be.

00:56.560 --> 01:02.720
 It was and is a place where I believe big, bold, revolutionary ideas have a home,

01:02.720 --> 01:07.440
 and that is what has needed in artificial intelligence research in the coming decades.

01:08.240 --> 01:14.320
 Yes, there's institutional challenges, but also there's power in the passion of individual

01:14.320 --> 01:19.600
 researchers, from undergrad to PhD, from young scientists to senior faculty.

01:19.600 --> 01:26.080
 I believe the dream to build intelligence systems burns brighter than ever in the halls of MIT.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.600
 This conversation was recorded recently, but before the outbreak of the pandemic.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.040
 For everyone feeling the burden of this crisis, I'm sending love your way.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.720
 Stay strong.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.760

04:12.960 --> 04:16.400
 And now here's my conversation with Steven Schwarzman.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.880
 Let's start with a tough question.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.080
 What idea do you believe whether grounded in data or intuition

04:24.640 --> 04:27.200
 that many people you respect disagree with you on?

04:27.200 --> 04:33.840
 Well, there isn't all that much anymore since the world's so transparent.

04:34.720 --> 04:42.240
 But one of the things I believe in and put it in the book, what it takes is,

04:42.240 --> 04:45.440
 if you're going to do something very consequential,

04:46.240 --> 04:50.080
 do something that's quite large, if you can, that's unique.

04:50.080 --> 04:56.720
 Because if you operate in that kind of space, when you're successful, it's a huge impact.

04:57.600 --> 05:03.600
 The prospect of success enables you to recruit people who want to be part of that.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.560
 And those type of large opportunities are pretty easily described.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.400
 And so not everybody likes to operate at scale.

05:14.400 --> 05:20.240
 Some people like to do small things because it is meaningful for them emotionally.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.200
 And so occasionally you get a disagreement on that.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.840
 But those are life choices rather than commercial choices.

05:29.840 --> 05:33.840
 That's interesting. What good and bad comes with going big?

05:34.640 --> 05:40.320
 See, we often in America think big is good.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.040
 What's the benefit? What's the cost? In terms of just bigger than business,

05:45.040 --> 05:48.240
 but life, happiness, the pursuit of happiness?

05:48.240 --> 05:52.160
 Well, you do things to make you happy. It's not mandated.

05:52.720 --> 06:01.440
 And everybody's different. And some people, if they have talent like playing pro football,

06:01.440 --> 06:07.920
 other people just like throwing the ball around, not even being on a team.

06:07.920 --> 06:13.680
 What's better depends what your objectives are. It depends what your talent is.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.800
 It depends what gives you joy.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.600
 So in terms of going big, is it both for impact on the world

06:24.160 --> 06:26.560
 and because you personally gives you joy?

06:27.440 --> 06:33.360
 Well, it makes it easier to succeed, actually, because if you catch something,

06:33.360 --> 06:39.040
 for example, that's cyclical, that's a huge opportunity,

06:40.000 --> 06:45.920
 then you usually can find some place within that huge opportunity where you can make it work.

06:46.880 --> 06:52.240
 If you're prosecuting a really small thing and you're wrong,

06:53.280 --> 07:00.000
 you don't have many places to go. So I've always found that the easy place to be

07:00.000 --> 07:07.600
 and the ability where you can concentrate human resources,

07:07.600 --> 07:12.240
 get people excited about doing really impactful big things,

07:13.200 --> 07:21.120
 and you can afford to pay them, actually, because the bigger thing can generate much more in the way

07:21.120 --> 07:28.160
 of financial resources. So that brings people out of talent to help you.

07:28.160 --> 07:33.280
 And so altogether, it's a virtuous circle, I think.

07:33.280 --> 07:39.360
 How do you know an opportunity when you see one in terms of the one you want to go big on?

07:40.080 --> 07:48.640
 Is it intuition? Is it facts? Is it back and forth deliberation with people you trust?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.680
 What's the process? Is it art? Is it science?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.840
 Well, it's pattern recognition.

07:53.840 --> 07:58.320
 And how do you get to pattern recognition? First, you need to understand the patterns

07:58.960 --> 08:07.440
 and the changes that are happening. And that's either it's observational on some level.

08:07.440 --> 08:16.400
 You can call it data or you can just call it listening to unusual things that people are

08:16.400 --> 08:23.760
 saying that they haven't said before. And I've always tried to describe this.

08:23.760 --> 08:28.320
 It's like seeing a piece of white lint on a black dress.

08:28.320 --> 08:33.520
 But most people disregard that piece of lint. They just see the dress.

08:33.520 --> 08:42.080
 I always see the lint. And I'm fascinated by how did something get some place it's not supposed to be.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.760
 So it doesn't even need to be a big discrepancy. But if something shouldn't be some place

08:48.480 --> 08:59.360
 in a constellation of facts that made sense in a traditional way, I've learned that if you focus

08:59.920 --> 09:07.760
 on why one discordant note is there, that's usually a key to something important.

09:07.760 --> 09:16.960
 And if you can find two of those discordant notes, that's usually a straight line to someplace.

09:17.520 --> 09:23.440
 And that someplace is not where you've been. And usually when you figure out that things

09:23.440 --> 09:29.680
 are changing or have changed and you describe them, which you have to be able to do because it's not

09:29.680 --> 09:38.240
 some odd intuition. It's just focusing on facts. It's almost like a scientific discovery, if you

09:38.240 --> 09:44.400
 will. When you describe it to other people in the real world, they tend to do absolutely nothing

09:45.200 --> 09:55.360
 about it. And that's because humans are comfortable in their own reality. And if there's no particular

09:55.360 --> 10:02.880
 reason at that moment to shake them out of their reality, they'll stay in it even if they're

10:02.880 --> 10:10.240
 ultimately completely wrong. And I've always been stunned that when I explain where we're going,

10:10.240 --> 10:19.520
 what we're doing, and why almost everyone just says, that's interesting. And they continue doing

10:19.520 --> 10:28.240
 what they're doing. And so I think it's pretty easy to do that. But what you need is a huge

10:28.240 --> 10:36.080
 data set. So before AI and people's focus on data, I've sort of been doing this mostly my whole life.

10:36.080 --> 10:42.880
 I'm not a scientist. I'm not alone a computer scientist. And you can just hear what people are

10:42.880 --> 10:47.680
 saying when somebody says something or you observe something that simply doesn't make sense.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.080
 That's when you really go to work. The rest of it's just processing.

10:52.080 --> 10:57.600
 So you know, on a quick tangent, pattern recognition is a term often used throughout

10:57.600 --> 11:03.360
 the history of AI. That's the goal of artificial intelligence is pattern recognition, right?

11:03.360 --> 11:11.440
 But there's, I would say, various flavors of that. So usually, pattern recognition refers to the

11:11.440 --> 11:19.920
 process of the, we said, dress and the lint on the dress pattern recognition is very good identifying

11:19.920 --> 11:27.040
 the dress is looking at the right the pattern that's always there that's very common and so on.

11:27.040 --> 11:33.920
 You almost refer to a pattern that's like an what's called outlier detection in computer science,

11:33.920 --> 11:44.800
 right? The rare thing, the small thing. Now, AI is not often good at that. Do you just almost

11:44.800 --> 11:51.280
 philosophically the kind of decisions you made in your life based scientifically almost on data?

11:52.160 --> 11:57.600
 Do you think AI in the future will be able to do? Is it something that could be put down

11:57.600 --> 12:04.640
 down into code? Or is it still deeply human? It's tough for me to say since I don't have

12:05.440 --> 12:17.840
 domain knowledge in AI to know everything that could or might occur. I know sort of,

12:17.840 --> 12:25.120
 in my own case, that most people don't see any of that. I just assumed it was motivational.

12:25.120 --> 12:36.320
 But it's also sort of, it's hard wiring. What are you wired or programmed to be finding

12:37.040 --> 12:44.880
 or looking for? It's not what happens every day. That's not interesting, frankly. I mean,

12:44.880 --> 12:51.920
 that's what people mostly do. I do a bunch of that too, because that's what you do in normal life.

12:51.920 --> 13:01.360
 But I've always been completely fascinated by the stuff that doesn't fit. Or the other way of

13:01.360 --> 13:13.200
 thinking about it, it's determining what people want without them saying it. That's a different

13:13.200 --> 13:18.800
 kind of pattern. You can see everything they're doing. There's a missing piece. They don't know

13:18.800 --> 13:26.960
 it's missing. You think it's missing, given the other facts you know about them. You deliver that

13:26.960 --> 13:35.120
 and then that becomes sort of very easy to sell to them. To link on this point a little bit,

13:35.120 --> 13:40.000
 you've mentioned that in your family, when you were growing up, nobody raised their voice

13:40.000 --> 13:45.280
 in anger otherwise. You said that this allowed you to learn to listen and hear some interesting

13:45.280 --> 13:52.400
 things. Can you elaborate as you have been on that idea? What do you hear about the world if you

13:52.400 --> 14:01.600
 listen? Well, you have to listen really intensely to understand what people are saying as well as

14:01.600 --> 14:10.960
 what people are intending, because it's not necessarily the same thing. People mostly

14:10.960 --> 14:18.880
 give themselves away, no matter how clever they think they are. Particularly if you

14:19.680 --> 14:25.760
 have the full array of inputs. In other words, if you look at their face, you look at their eyes,

14:26.320 --> 14:32.560
 which are the window on the soul, it's very difficult to conceal what you're thinking.

14:32.560 --> 14:41.680
 You look at facial expressions and posture. You listen to their voice, which changes.

14:42.800 --> 14:47.600
 When you're talking about something you're comfortable with or not, or you're speaking

14:47.600 --> 14:54.560
 faster, is the amplitude of what you're saying higher. Most people just give away what's really

14:54.560 --> 15:00.640
 on their mind. They're not that clever. They're busy spending their time thinking about what

15:00.640 --> 15:08.240
 they're in the process of saying. If you just observe that, not in a hostile way, but just

15:08.880 --> 15:14.560
 in an evocative way and just let them talk for a while, they'll more or less tell you almost

15:14.560 --> 15:22.960
 completely what they're thinking, even the stuff they don't want you to know. Once you know that,

15:22.960 --> 15:31.600
 of course, it's easy to play that kind of game, because they've already told you everything you

15:31.600 --> 15:40.320
 need to know. It's easy to get to a conclusion if there's meant to be an area of common interest,

15:40.320 --> 15:48.880
 since you know almost exactly what's on their mind. That's an enormous advantage, as opposed to just

15:48.880 --> 15:55.280
 walking in in some place and somebody telling you something and you believing what they're saying.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.520
 There are so many different levels of communication.

16:00.880 --> 16:06.560
 So a powerful approach to life you discuss in the book on the topic of listening and really

16:06.560 --> 16:11.600
 hearing people, is figuring out what the biggest problem, bothering a particular individual or

16:11.600 --> 16:20.080
 group is and coming up with a solution to that problem and presenting them with a solution. In

16:20.080 --> 16:26.400
 fact, you brilliantly describe a lot of simple things that most people just don't do. It's

16:26.400 --> 16:32.960
 kind of obvious, find the problem that's bothering somebody deeply. And as you said, I think you've

16:32.960 --> 16:39.200
 implied that they will usually tell you what the problem is. But can you talk about this process

16:39.200 --> 16:46.080
 of seeing what the biggest problem for a person is, trying to solve it, and maybe a particularly

16:46.080 --> 16:52.960
 memorable example? Sure. If you know you're going to meet somebody, there are two types of

16:52.960 --> 16:59.680
 situations. Chance meetings, and the second is you know you're going to meet somebody. So

16:59.680 --> 17:03.120
 let's take the easiest one, which is you know you're going to meet somebody.

17:03.120 --> 17:12.400
 And you start trying to make pretend you're them. It's really easy. What's on their mind?

17:13.840 --> 17:19.520
 What are they thinking about in their daily life? What are the big problems they're facing? So if

17:19.520 --> 17:26.160
 they're, you know, to make it a really easy example, you know, and make pretend, you know,

17:26.160 --> 17:30.160
 they're like president of the United States. It doesn't have to be this president,

17:30.160 --> 17:34.960
 could be any president. So you sort of know what's more or less on their mind, because

17:34.960 --> 17:42.640
 the press keeps reporting it. And you see it on television, you hear it, people discuss it. So you

17:42.640 --> 17:48.320
 know if you're going to be running into somebody in that kind of position, you sort of know what

17:48.320 --> 17:56.240
 they look like already. You know what they sound like, you know what their voice is like, and you

17:56.240 --> 18:02.720
 know what they're focused on. And so if you're going to meet somebody like that, what you should

18:02.720 --> 18:10.400
 do is take the biggest unresolved issue that they're facing and come up with a few interesting

18:10.400 --> 18:18.240
 solutions that basically haven't been out there, or that you haven't heard anybody else

18:18.960 --> 18:24.320
 I was thinking about. So just to give you an example, I was sort of in the early 1990s and

18:24.320 --> 18:29.200
 I was invited to something at the White House, which was a big deal for me, because I was like,

18:29.200 --> 18:34.240
 you know, a person from no place. And you know, I had met the president once before,

18:35.360 --> 18:41.600
 because it was President Bush, because his son was in my dormitory. So I had met him at

18:41.600 --> 18:47.680
 parents day. I mean, it's just like the oddity of things. So I knew I was going to see him,

18:47.680 --> 18:53.920
 because you know, that's where the invitation came from. And so there was something going on,

18:53.920 --> 19:02.560
 and I just thought about, you know, two or three ways to approach that issue. And you know, at that

19:02.560 --> 19:12.720
 point, I was separated. And so I had brought a date to the White House. And so I saw the president,

19:12.720 --> 19:18.320
 we sort of went over in a corner for about 10 minutes and discussed whatever this issue was.

19:18.320 --> 19:23.920
 And I later, you know, went back to my data, it was a little rude, but it was meant to be

19:23.920 --> 19:30.720
 confidential conversation. And I barely knew her. And you know, she said, what were you talking about

19:30.720 --> 19:36.000
 all that time? I said, well, you know, there's something going on in the world. And I've thought

19:36.000 --> 19:42.800
 about different ways of perhaps approaching that. And he was interested. And the answer is, of course,

19:42.800 --> 19:48.160
 he was interested. Why wouldn't he be interested? There didn't seem to be an easy outcome. And

19:48.160 --> 19:53.920
 so, you know, conversations of that type, once somebody knows you're really thinking about

19:53.920 --> 20:02.560
 what's good for them, and good for the situation, it has nothing to do with me. I mean, it's really

20:02.560 --> 20:10.800
 about being in service, you know, to the situation, that then people trust you. And they'll tell you

20:10.800 --> 20:19.200
 other things, because they know your motives are basically very pure. You're just trying to resolve

20:19.200 --> 20:25.520
 a difficult situation and help somebody do it. So these types of things, you know, that's a plan

20:25.520 --> 20:31.680
 situation. That's easy. Sometimes you just come upon somebody and they start talking. And, you

20:31.680 --> 20:38.160
 know, that requires, you know, like different skills, you know, you can ask them what you've

20:38.160 --> 20:44.240
 been working on lately. What are you thinking about? You can ask them, you know, has anything been

20:44.240 --> 20:51.280
 particularly difficult? And you know, you can ask them, most people, if they trust you for some reason,

20:53.840 --> 21:02.000
 they'll tell you. And then you have to instantly go to work on it. And, you know, that's not as good

21:02.000 --> 21:09.680
 as having some advanced planning. But, you know, almost everything going on is like out there.

21:10.800 --> 21:20.800
 And people who are involved with interesting situations, they're playing in the same ecosystem.

21:20.800 --> 21:29.680
 They just have different roles in the ecosystem. And, you know, you can do that with somebody who

21:29.680 --> 21:38.480
 owns a pro football team that loses all the time. We specialize in those in New York. And, you know,

21:38.480 --> 21:46.160
 you already have analyzed why they're losing, right? Inevitably, it's because they don't have a

21:46.160 --> 21:52.480
 great quarterback. They don't have a great coach. And they don't have a great general manager who

21:52.480 --> 21:59.360
 knows how to hire the best talent. Those are the three reasons why a team fails, right? Because

21:59.360 --> 22:04.960
 they're salary caps. So, every team pays this amount of money for all their players. So, it's

22:04.960 --> 22:10.160
 got to be those three positions. So, if you're talking with somebody like that, inevitably,

22:11.040 --> 22:17.360
 even though it's not structured, you'll know how their team's doing and you'll know

22:18.080 --> 22:24.320
 pretty much why. And if you start asking questions about that, they're typically very happy to talk

22:24.320 --> 22:29.440
 about it because they haven't solved that problem. In some case, they don't even know that's the problem.

22:29.440 --> 22:38.240
 It's pretty easy to see it. So, you know, I do stuff like that, which I find is intuitive as a

22:38.240 --> 22:46.240
 process, but, you know, leads to really good results. Well, the funny thing is when you're smart,

22:48.160 --> 22:53.360
 for smart people, it's hard to escape their own ego and the space of their own problems,

22:53.360 --> 23:00.400
 which is what's required to think about other people's problems. It requires for you to let go

23:00.400 --> 23:05.920
 of the fact that your own problems are all important. And then to talk about your, I think,

23:07.200 --> 23:14.480
 while it seems obvious, and I think quite brilliant, it's a difficult leap for many people,

23:14.480 --> 23:19.760
 especially smart people, to empathize with, truly empathize with the problems of others.

23:19.760 --> 23:27.360
 Well, I have a competitive advantage, which is, I don't think I'm so smart.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.680
 You know, it's not a problem for me.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.600
 Well, the truly smartest people I know say that exact same thing. Yeah, being humble

23:36.880 --> 23:43.440
 is really useful, competitive advantage, as you said. How do you stay humble?

23:43.440 --> 23:54.720
 Well, I haven't changed much since I was in my mid teens, you know, I was raised partly in the city

23:54.720 --> 24:04.640
 and partly in the suburbs. And, you know, whatever the values I had at that time, those are still

24:04.640 --> 24:13.760
 my values. I call them like middle class values, that's how I was raised. And I've never changed,

24:13.760 --> 24:22.160
 why would I? That's who I am. And so the accoutrement of, you know, the rest of your life

24:22.880 --> 24:28.880
 has got to be put on the same, you know, like solid foundation of who you are. Because if you

24:28.880 --> 24:37.040
 start losing who you really are, who are you? So I've never had the desire to be somebody else.

24:37.040 --> 24:43.840
 I just do other things now that I wouldn't do as a, you know, sort of as a middle class kid

24:43.840 --> 24:49.680
 from Philadelphia. I mean, my life has morphed on a certain level. But part of the strength

24:49.680 --> 25:01.760
 of having integrity, of personality, is that you can remain in touch with everybody who's

25:01.760 --> 25:08.000
 comes from that kind of background. And, you know, even though I do some things that aren't like that,

25:08.560 --> 25:13.280
 you know, in terms of people I'd meet or situations I'm in, I always look at it through

25:13.280 --> 25:21.120
 the same lens. And that's very psychologically comfortable. And doesn't require me to make

25:21.120 --> 25:24.880
 any real adjustments in my life. And I just keep plowing ahead.

25:26.320 --> 25:30.960
 There's a lot of activity and progress in recent years around effective altruism.

25:32.080 --> 25:36.640
 It's, I wanted to bring this topic with you, because it's an interesting one from your perspective.

25:36.640 --> 25:43.280
 You can put it in any kind of terms, but it's philanthropy that focuses on maximizing impact.

25:44.160 --> 25:50.240
 How do you see the goal of philanthropy, both from a personal motivation perspective and the

25:50.240 --> 25:56.000
 societal big picture impact perspective? Yeah, I don't think about philanthropy the

25:56.000 --> 26:04.960
 way you would expect me to. Okay, I look at, you know, sort of solving big issues, addressing

26:04.960 --> 26:12.400
 big issues, starting new organizations to do it, much like we do in our business. You know,

26:12.400 --> 26:16.960
 we keep growing our business, not by taking the original thing and making it larger,

26:17.520 --> 26:24.480
 but continually seeing new things and building those and, you know, sort of marshaling

26:25.040 --> 26:31.680
 financial resources, human resources. And in our case, because we're in the investment

26:31.680 --> 26:36.640
 business, we find something new that looks like it's going to be terrific. And we do that,

26:36.640 --> 26:43.600
 and it works out really well. All I do in what you would call philanthropy is look at

26:45.040 --> 26:53.520
 other opportunities to help society. And I end up starting something new,

26:54.240 --> 27:00.640
 marshaling people, marshaling a lot of money. And then at the end of that kind of creative process

27:00.640 --> 27:07.520
 says somebody typically asks me to write a check. I don't wake up and say, how can I, like, give

27:07.520 --> 27:15.520
 large amounts of money away? I look at issues that are important for people. In some cases,

27:15.520 --> 27:22.640
 I do smaller things, because it's important to a person. And, you know, I have, you know,

27:22.640 --> 27:28.400
 sort of, I can relate to that person, there's some unfairness that's happened to them. And so,

27:28.400 --> 27:37.440
 in situations like that, I'd give money anonymously and help them out. And, you know, it's like a

27:37.440 --> 27:45.520
 miniature version of addressing something really big. So, you know, at MIT, I've done a big thing,

27:46.480 --> 27:51.840
 you know, helping to start this new school of computing. And I did that because, you know,

27:51.840 --> 27:59.760
 I saw that, you know, there's sort of like a global race on AI, quantum and other major

27:59.760 --> 28:09.600
 technologies. And I thought that the US could use more enhancement from a competitive perspective.

28:09.600 --> 28:15.680
 And I also, because I get to China a lot, and I travel around a lot compared to a regular person,

28:15.680 --> 28:23.600
 you know, I can see the need to have control of these types of technologies. So, when they're

28:23.600 --> 28:29.840
 introduced, we don't create a mess like we did with the internet, and with social media,

28:30.640 --> 28:37.120
 unintended consequence, you know, that's creating all kinds of issues and freedom of speech and the

28:37.120 --> 28:42.800
 functioning of liberal democracies. So, with AI, it was pretty clear that there was enormous

28:42.800 --> 28:49.360
 difference of views around the world by the relatively few practitioners in the world who

28:49.360 --> 28:56.560
 really knew what was going on. And by accident, I knew a bunch of these people, you know, who were

28:56.560 --> 29:03.920
 like big famous people, and I could talk to them and say, why do you think this is a force for bad?

29:04.960 --> 29:11.760
 And someone else, why do you feel this is a force for good? And how do we move forward with the

29:11.760 --> 29:20.800
 technology by the same time, make sure that whatever is potentially, you know, sort of on the bad

29:20.800 --> 29:27.040
 side of this technology with, you know, for example, disruption of workforces and things like that,

29:27.840 --> 29:33.600
 that could happen much faster than the industrial revolution? What do we do about that? And how

29:33.600 --> 29:40.080
 do we keep that under control so that the really good things about these technologies, which will

29:40.080 --> 29:49.360
 be great things, not good things, are allowed to happen? So, to me, you know, this was one of the

29:49.360 --> 29:56.640
 great issues facing society. The number of people who were aware of it were very small.

29:57.280 --> 30:04.640
 I just accidentally got sucked into it. And as soon as I saw it, I went, oh my god, this is mega.

30:04.640 --> 30:11.680
 Yeah. Yeah. Both on a competitive basis globally, but also in terms of protecting

30:12.480 --> 30:18.880
 society and benefiting society. So, that's how I got involved. And at the end, you know,

30:18.880 --> 30:24.960
 sort of the right thing that we figured out was, you know, sort of double MIT's computer

30:24.960 --> 30:31.360
 science faculty and basically create the first AI enabled university in the world.

30:31.360 --> 30:38.160
 And, you know, in effect, be an example, a beacon to the rest of the research community around the

30:38.160 --> 30:49.760
 world academically, and create, you know, a much more robust US situation, competitive situation

30:49.760 --> 30:56.800
 among the universities. Because if MIT was going to raise a lot of money and double its faculty,

30:56.800 --> 31:03.040
 where you could bet that, you know, in a number of other universities, we're going to do the same

31:03.040 --> 31:09.520
 thing. At the end of it, it would be great for knowledge creation, you know, great for the

31:09.520 --> 31:18.160
 United States, great for the world. And so, I like to do things that I think are really positive

31:19.440 --> 31:26.160
 things that other people aren't acting on, that I see for whatever the reason. First,

31:26.160 --> 31:32.800
 it's just people I meet and what they say. And I can recognize when something really profound

31:32.800 --> 31:39.920
 is about to happen or needs to. And I do it at the end of the situation. Somebody says,

31:39.920 --> 31:46.400
 can you write a check to help us? And then the answer is sure. I mean, because if I don't,

31:46.400 --> 31:53.280
 the vision won't happen. But it's the vision of whatever I do that is compelling.

31:53.280 --> 32:01.840
 And essentially, I love that idea of whether it's small at the individual level or really big,

32:01.840 --> 32:09.360
 like the gift to MIT to launch the College of Computing. It starts with the vision and

32:11.120 --> 32:17.040
 you see philanthropy as the biggest impact you can have is by launching something new,

32:17.040 --> 32:24.480
 especially on an issue that others aren't really addressing. And I also love the notion,

32:24.480 --> 32:27.040
 and you're absolutely right, that there's other universities,

32:29.520 --> 32:34.640
 Stanford, CMU, I'm looking at you, that would essentially your, the seed will

32:36.640 --> 32:42.320
 create other, it'll have a ripple effect that potentially might help US be a leader

32:42.320 --> 32:49.920
 or continue to be a leader in AI, this potentially very transformative research direction.

32:49.920 --> 32:53.520
 Just to linger on that point a little bit, what is your hope long term

32:54.960 --> 33:01.120
 for the impact the college here at MIT might have in the next 5, 10, even 20,

33:01.120 --> 33:06.000
 or let's get crazy 30, 50 years? Well, it's very difficult to predict the future

33:06.000 --> 33:14.960
 when you're dealing with knowledge production and creativity. MIT has obviously some unique aspects.

33:16.160 --> 33:26.160
 Globally, there's four big academic surveys. I forget whether it was QS, there's the Times

33:27.200 --> 33:34.800
 in London, the US News and whatever. And one of these recently, MIT was ranked number one

33:34.800 --> 33:40.400
 in the world. So, leave aside whether you're number three somewhere else,

33:41.360 --> 33:48.160
 in the great sweep of humanity, this is pretty amazing. So, you have a really

33:49.280 --> 33:58.800
 remarkable aggregation of human talent here. And where it goes, it's hard to tell, you have to be

33:58.800 --> 34:08.480
 a scientist to have the right feel. But what's important is you have a critical mass of people.

34:08.480 --> 34:17.360
 And I think it breaks into two buckets. One is scientific advancement. And if the new college

34:17.360 --> 34:30.080
 can help either serve as a convening force within the university or help coordination

34:30.080 --> 34:37.360
 and communication among people, that's a good thing. Absolute good thing. The second thing

34:37.360 --> 34:51.440
 is in the AI ethics area, which is in a way equally important because if the science side

34:52.240 --> 35:05.040
 creates blowback, so that science is a bit crippled in terms of going forward because

35:05.040 --> 35:13.600
 society's reaction to knowledge advancement in this field becomes really hostile, then

35:13.600 --> 35:19.760
 you've sort of lost the game in terms of scientific progress and innovation. And so,

35:19.760 --> 35:30.400
 the AI ethics piece is super important because in a perfect world, MIT would serve as a global

35:30.400 --> 35:39.680
 convener because what you need is you need the research universities. You need the companies

35:40.640 --> 35:50.640
 that are driving AI and quantum work. You need governments who will ultimately be regulating

35:50.640 --> 35:58.800
 certain elements of this. And you also need the media to be knowledgeable and trained.

35:58.800 --> 36:09.440
 And so, we don't get sort of overreactions to one situation, which then goes viral.

36:10.480 --> 36:18.640
 And it ends up shutting down avenues that are perfectly fine to be walking down or running

36:18.640 --> 36:30.240
 down that avenue. But if enough discordant information, not even correct necessarily,

36:32.240 --> 36:38.720
 sort of gets pushed around society, then you can end up with a really hostile regulatory

36:38.720 --> 36:48.960
 environment and other things. So, you have four drivers that have to be sort of integrated.

36:50.240 --> 36:57.520
 And so, if the new school of computing can be really helpful in that regard,

36:58.480 --> 37:07.920
 then that's a real service to science and it's a serviced MIT. So, that's why I wanted to get

37:07.920 --> 37:15.200
 involved for both areas. And the hope is for me, for others, for everyone, for the world is for

37:15.200 --> 37:22.880
 this particular college of computing to be a beacon and a connector for these ideas.

37:22.880 --> 37:31.040
 Yeah, that's right. I mean, I think MIT is perfectly positioned to do that.

37:31.040 --> 37:38.320
 All right. So, you've mentioned the media, social media, the internet as this complex

37:38.960 --> 37:43.600
 network of communication with with flaws, perhaps, perhaps you can speak to them.

37:44.080 --> 37:52.080
 But it, you know, I personally think that science and technology has its flaws,

37:52.080 --> 38:01.200
 but ultimately is one, sexy, exciting. It's the way for us to explore and understand the

38:01.200 --> 38:08.240
 mysteries of our world. And two, most perhaps more importantly for some people, it's a huge

38:08.240 --> 38:12.960
 way to a really powerful way to grow the economy to improve the quality of life for everyone.

38:13.600 --> 38:20.960
 So, how do we get, how do you see the media, social media, the internet as a society

38:20.960 --> 38:30.160
 having, you know, a healthy discourse about science, first of all, one that's factual,

38:30.160 --> 38:36.480
 and two, one that's finds science exciting, that invests in science, that pushes it forward,

38:36.480 --> 38:42.720
 especially in this science fiction, fear filled field of artificial intelligence.

38:43.360 --> 38:49.200
 Well, I think that's a little above my pay grade, because, you know, trying to control

38:49.200 --> 38:56.080
 social media to make it do what you want to do, appears to be beyond almost anybody's control.

38:56.640 --> 39:03.040
 And the technology is being used to create what I call the tyranny of the minorities.

39:03.680 --> 39:09.200
 Okay, a minority is defined as, you know, two or three people on a street corner.

39:09.200 --> 39:14.240
 Doesn't matter what they look like. It doesn't matter where they came from. They're united

39:14.240 --> 39:24.160
 by that one issue that they care about. And their job is to enforce their views

39:25.440 --> 39:31.840
 on the world. And, you know, in the political world, people just are manufacturing

39:32.720 --> 39:41.360
 truth. And they throw it all over. And it affects all of us. And, you know, sometimes

39:41.360 --> 39:48.640
 people are just hired to do that. I mean, it's amazing. And you think it's one person,

39:48.640 --> 39:54.320
 it's really, you know, just sort of a front, you know, for a particular point of view.

39:55.200 --> 40:03.840
 And this has become exceptionally disruptive for society. And it's dangerous. And it's

40:03.840 --> 40:09.920
 undercutting, you know, the ability of liberal democracies to function. And I don't know how

40:09.920 --> 40:17.200
 to get a grip on this. And I was really surprised when we, you know, was up here for the announcement

40:18.080 --> 40:26.880
 last spring of the College of Computing. And they had all these famous scientists,

40:26.880 --> 40:34.560
 some of whom were involved with the invention of the internet. And almost every one of them

40:34.560 --> 40:42.960
 got up and said, I think I made a mistake. And as a non scientist, I never thought I'd hear anyone

40:42.960 --> 40:50.160
 say that. And what they said is, more or less, to make it simple, we thought this would be really

40:50.160 --> 40:56.160
 cool, inventing the internet. We could connect everyone in the world. We can move knowledge

40:56.160 --> 41:03.280
 around. It was instantaneous. It's a really amazing thing. He said, I don't know that there was

41:03.280 --> 41:09.600
 anyone who ever thought about social media coming out of that and the actual consequences

41:09.600 --> 41:18.560
 for people's lives. You know, there's always some, some younger person, I just saw one of these

41:18.560 --> 41:24.560
 yesterday, he's reported on the national news, he killed himself when people use social media

41:24.560 --> 41:33.920
 to basically, you know, sort of ridicule him or something of that type. This is dead. This is

41:33.920 --> 41:44.720
 dangerous. And, you know, so I don't have a solution for that other than going forward.

41:45.360 --> 41:52.720
 You can't end up with this type of outcome using AI to make this kind of mistake twice

41:52.720 --> 42:02.720
 is unforgivable. So interestingly, at least in the West, and parts of China, people are quite

42:02.720 --> 42:11.440
 sympathetic to, you know, sort of the whole concept of AI ethics and what gets introduced when,

42:11.440 --> 42:20.000
 and cooperation within your own country, within your own industry, as well as globally to make

42:20.000 --> 42:27.040
 sure that the technology is a force for good. On that really interesting topic, since 2007,

42:27.040 --> 42:31.360
 you've had a relationship with senior leadership, with a lot of people in China,

42:32.800 --> 42:37.200
 and an interest in understanding modern China, their culture, their world.

42:38.320 --> 42:44.880
 Much like with Russia, I'm from Russia originally, Americans are told a very narrow one sided story

42:44.880 --> 42:52.560
 about China, that I'm sure misses a lot of fascinating complexity, both positive and negative.

42:53.200 --> 42:58.640
 What lessons about Chinese culture, its ideas as a nation, its future, do you think Americans should

42:59.520 --> 43:06.400
 know about, deliberate on, think about? Well, it's sort of a wide question that you're

43:06.400 --> 43:14.960
 you're asking about. You know, China is a pretty unusual place. First, it's huge. You know, you

43:14.960 --> 43:22.480
 got, it's physically huge. It's got a billion three people. And the character of the people

43:22.480 --> 43:32.160
 isn't as well understood in the United States. Chinese people are amazingly energetic.

43:32.160 --> 43:39.440
 If you're one of a billion three people, one of the things you've got to be focused on

43:40.000 --> 43:50.800
 is how do you make your way, you know, through a crowd of a billion 2.99999 other people.

43:50.800 --> 43:57.040
 Another word for that is competitive. Yes, they are individually highly energetic,

43:57.040 --> 44:06.560
 highly focused, always looking for some opportunity for themselves, because they need to,

44:07.840 --> 44:14.240
 because there's an enormous amount of just literally people around. And so, you know,

44:14.240 --> 44:23.200
 what I've found is they'll try and find a way to win for themselves. And their country is

44:23.200 --> 44:30.160
 complicated, because it basically doesn't have the same kind of functional laws that we do

44:30.880 --> 44:41.120
 in the United States in the West. And the country is controlled really through a web of

44:41.120 --> 44:47.360
 relationships you have with other people, and the relationships that those other people have

44:47.360 --> 44:56.800
 with other people. So it's an incredibly dynamic culture where if somebody knocks somebody up

44:56.800 --> 45:03.360
 on the top, who's three levels above you and is in effect protecting you, then, you know, you're

45:03.360 --> 45:10.560
 like a, you know, sort of a floating molecule there, you know, without tethering, except the

45:10.560 --> 45:16.000
 one or two layers above you, but that's going to get affected. So it's a very dynamic system and

45:16.000 --> 45:22.800
 getting people to change is not that easy, because if there aren't really functioning laws,

45:23.600 --> 45:29.840
 it's only the relationships that everybody has. And so when you decide to make a major change

45:30.720 --> 45:38.160
 and you sign up for it, something is changing in your life. There won't necessarily be all the

45:38.160 --> 45:46.160
 same people on your team. And that's a very high risk enterprise. So when you're dealing with China,

45:46.160 --> 45:53.200
 it's important to know almost what everybody's relationship is with somebody. So when you

45:53.200 --> 46:01.840
 suggest doing something differently, you line up these forces in the West, it's usually you

46:01.840 --> 46:07.760
 talk to a person and they figure out what's good for them. It's a lot easier. And in that sense,

46:07.760 --> 46:13.360
 in a funny way, it's easier to make change in the West, just the opposite of what people think.

46:14.720 --> 46:20.800
 But once the Chinese system adjusts to something that's new, everybody's on the team.

46:22.320 --> 46:28.560
 It's hard to change them, but once they're changed, they are incredibly focused in a way

46:28.560 --> 46:36.320
 that it's hard for the West to do in a more individualistic culture. So there are all kinds of

46:36.320 --> 46:45.680
 fascinating things. One thing that might interest the people who are listening

46:46.640 --> 46:52.720
 were more technologically based than some other group. I was with one of the top people in

46:53.760 --> 47:04.080
 the government a few weeks ago and he was telling me that every school child in China is going to be

47:04.080 --> 47:19.040
 taught computer science. Now imagine 100% of these children. This is such a large number of human

47:19.040 --> 47:26.000
 beings. Now, that doesn't mean that every one of them will be good at computer science, but if it's

47:26.000 --> 47:32.400
 sort of like in the West, if it's like math or English, everybody's going to take it.

47:32.400 --> 47:37.600
 Yes. Not everybody's great at English. They don't write books. They don't write poetry.

47:38.800 --> 47:44.640
 Not everybody's good at math. Somebody like myself, I sort of evolved to the third grade

47:44.640 --> 47:50.880
 and I'm still doing flashcards. I didn't make it further in math, but imagine

47:51.840 --> 47:57.360
 everybody in their society is going to be involved with computer science.

47:57.360 --> 48:06.640
 I just even pause on that. I think computer science involves at the basic beginner level

48:06.640 --> 48:13.280
 programming and the idea that everybody in the society would have some ability to program a

48:13.280 --> 48:22.560
 computer is incredible. For me, it's incredibly exciting and I think that should give United

48:22.560 --> 48:31.120
 States pause and consider what, talking about sort of philanthropy and launching things.

48:31.120 --> 48:37.040
 There's nothing like launching, sort of investing in young youth, the education

48:37.600 --> 48:42.800
 system because that's where everything launches. Yes. Well, we've got a complicated system because

48:42.800 --> 48:49.600
 we have over 3,000 school districts around the country. China doesn't worry about that as a

48:49.600 --> 48:56.400
 concept. They make a decision at the very top of the government that that's what they want to have

48:56.400 --> 49:05.840
 happen and that is what will happen. We're really handicapped by this distributed power.

49:06.880 --> 49:12.640
 In the education area, although some people involved with that area will think it's great,

49:12.640 --> 49:22.080
 but you would know better than I do what percent of American children have computer science exposure.

49:23.120 --> 49:32.160
 My guess, no knowledge would be 5% or less. If we're going to be going into a world

49:33.040 --> 49:41.920
 where the other major economic power, sort of like ourselves, is got like 100% and we got 5

49:41.920 --> 49:50.320
 and the whole computer science area is the future, then we're purposely,

49:50.960 --> 49:57.200
 we're accidentally actually handicapping ourselves and our system doesn't allow us

49:57.760 --> 50:08.320
 to adjust quickly to that. The issues like this, I find fascinating and if you're lucky enough to

50:08.320 --> 50:17.680
 go to other countries, which I do and you learn what they're thinking, then it informs what we

50:17.680 --> 50:25.520
 ought to be doing in the United States. The current administration, Donald Trump,

50:25.520 --> 50:30.720
 has released an executive order on artificial intelligence. I'm not sure if you're familiar

50:30.720 --> 50:40.800
 with it in 2019. Looking several years ahead, how does America, we've mentioned in terms of the big

50:40.800 --> 50:49.280
 impact, we hope your investment in MIT will have a ripple effect, but from a federal perspective,

50:49.280 --> 50:56.240
 from a government perspective, how does America establish with respect to China leadership in

50:56.240 --> 51:03.440
 the world at the top for research and development in AI? I think that you have to get the federal

51:03.440 --> 51:14.080
 government in the game in a big way and that this leap forward technologically, which is going to

51:14.080 --> 51:22.320
 happen with or without us, really should be with us and it's an opportunity, in effect,

51:22.320 --> 51:34.000
 for another moonshot kind of mobilization by the United States. I think the appetite actually is

51:34.000 --> 51:43.520
 there to do that. At the moment, what's getting in the way is the kind of poisonous politics we

51:43.520 --> 51:57.680
 have, but if you go below the lack of cooperation, which is almost the defining element of American

51:57.680 --> 52:04.800
 democracy right now in the Congress, if you talk to individual members, they get it and

52:05.600 --> 52:10.800
 they would like to do something. Another part of the issue is we're running huge deficits.

52:10.800 --> 52:18.480
 We're running trillion dollar plus deficits. How much money do you need for this initiative?

52:19.520 --> 52:26.320
 Where does it come from? Who's prepared to stand up for it? Because if it involves taking away

52:26.320 --> 52:35.840
 resources from another area, our political system is not real flexible to do that. If you're creating

52:35.840 --> 52:46.720
 this kind of initiative, which we need, where does the money come from? Trying to get money

52:47.280 --> 52:51.680
 when you've got trillion dollar deficits in a way could be easy. What's the difference of a

52:51.680 --> 53:00.400
 trillion and a trillion a little more? It's hard with the mechanisms of Congress, but what's really

53:00.400 --> 53:11.360
 important is this is not an issue that is unknown and it's viewed as a very important issue.

53:12.960 --> 53:18.080
 There's almost no one in the Congress when you sit down and explain what's going on

53:18.720 --> 53:26.400
 who doesn't say, we've got to do something. Let me ask the impossible question. You didn't

53:26.400 --> 53:31.840
 endorse Donald Trump, but after he was elected, you have given him advice,

53:35.440 --> 53:43.440
 which seems to me a great thing to do, no matter who the president is, to positively

53:43.440 --> 53:49.520
 contribute to this nation by giving advice. Yet, you've received a lot of criticism for this.

53:49.520 --> 53:58.000
 On the previous topic of science and technology and government, how do we have healthy discourse,

53:59.600 --> 54:06.960
 give advice, get excited conversation with the government about science and technology

54:06.960 --> 54:13.760
 without it becoming politicized? It's very interesting. When I was young,

54:13.760 --> 54:22.480
 before there was a moonshot, we had a president named John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts here.

54:23.520 --> 54:30.400
 In his inaugural address as president, he asked, not what your country can do for you,

54:31.600 --> 54:39.680
 but what you can do for your country. We had a generation of people, my age, basically people,

54:39.680 --> 54:51.280
 who grew up with that credo. Sometimes you don't need to innovate. You can go back to basic

54:51.280 --> 55:00.400
 principles, and that's a good basic principle. What can we do? Americans have GDP per capita

55:00.400 --> 55:13.120
 of around $60,000. It's not equally distributed, but it's big. People have, I think, an obligation

55:14.480 --> 55:26.640
 to help their country. I do that. Apparently, I take some grief from some people who

55:26.640 --> 55:38.560
 project on me things I don't even vaguely believe, but I'm quite simple. I tried to help

55:38.560 --> 55:44.320
 the previous president, President Obama. He was a good guy, and he was a different party,

55:44.320 --> 55:53.680
 and I tried to help President Bush, and he's a different party. I sort of don't care that much

55:53.680 --> 56:01.280
 about what the parties are. I care about, even though I'm a big donor for the Republicans,

56:01.280 --> 56:12.080
 but what motivates me is, what are the problems we're facing? Can I help people get to a good

56:12.080 --> 56:25.840
 outcome that'll stand any test? We live in a world now where the filters and the hostility is so

56:26.960 --> 56:35.040
 unbelievable. In the 1960s, when I went to school, in university, I went to Yale,

56:35.040 --> 56:46.320
 and we had so much stuff going on. We had a war called the Vietnam War. We had black power

56:46.320 --> 56:59.600
 starting, and we had a sexual revolution with the birth control pill. It was one other major

56:59.600 --> 57:08.880
 thing going on, and the drug revolution. There hasn't been a generation that had more stuff

57:09.920 --> 57:20.240
 going on in a four year period than my era. Yet, there wasn't this kind of

57:20.240 --> 57:30.160
 instant hostility if you believed something different. Everybody lived together and respected

57:31.120 --> 57:38.640
 the other person. I think that this type of change needs to happen, and it's got to happen

57:38.640 --> 57:49.280
 from the leadership of our major institutions. I don't think that leaders can be bullied

57:50.720 --> 57:59.600
 by people who are against the classical version of free speech and letting open expression and

57:59.600 --> 58:13.360
 inquiry. That's what universities are for, among other things, socratic methods. In the midst of

58:13.360 --> 58:24.240
 this onslaught of oddness, I believe in still the basic principles, and we're going to have to find a

58:24.240 --> 58:32.400
 way to get back to that. That doesn't start with the people in the middle to the bottom who are

58:33.040 --> 58:41.120
 using these kinds of screens to shout people down and create an uncooperative environment.

58:41.120 --> 58:49.920
 It's got to be done at the top with core principles that are articulated. Ironically,

58:49.920 --> 58:56.960
 if people don't sign on to these kind of core principles where people are equal and

58:58.640 --> 59:05.200
 speech can be heard and you don't have these enormous shout down biases subtly or

59:06.240 --> 59:10.880
 out loud, then they don't belong at those institutions. They're violating the core

59:10.880 --> 59:19.920
 principles. That's how you end up making change, but you have to have courageous people

59:21.040 --> 59:27.120
 who are willing to lay that out for the benefit of not just their institutions,

59:27.680 --> 59:33.680
 but for society as a whole. I believe that will happen,

59:33.680 --> 59:42.480
 but it needs the commitment of senior people to make it happen.

59:42.480 --> 59:48.640
 Courage. I think for such great leaders, great universities, there's a huge hunger

59:48.640 --> 59:55.120
 for it. I'm too very optimistic that it will come. I'm now personally taking a step into

59:55.120 --> 1:00:01.760
 building a startup first time, hoping to change the world, of course. There are thousands,

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:06.640
 maybe more, maybe millions of other first time entrepreneurs like me. What advice

1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:13.920
 you've gone through this process? You've talked about the suffering, the emotional turmoil,

1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:18.400
 and all my intel. What advice do you have for those people taking that step?

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:30.800
 I'd say it's a rough ride and you have to be psychologically prepared for things going wrong

1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:39.040
 with frequency. You have to be prepared to be put in situations where you're being asked to

1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:44.800
 solve problems you didn't even know those problems existed. For example, renting space.

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:50.400
 It's not really a problem unless you've never done it. You have no idea what a lease looks like.

1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:58.960
 You don't even know the relevant rent in a market, so everything is new. Everything

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:05.120
 has to be learned. What you realize is that it's good to have other people with you

1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:10.320
 who've had some experience in areas where you don't know what you're doing. Unfortunately,

1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:16.960
 an entrepreneur starting doesn't know much of anything, so everything is something new.

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:26.880
 Yeah. I think it's important not to be alone because it's overwhelming

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:35.440
 and you need somebody to talk to other than a spouse or a loved one because even they get

1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:45.120
 bored with your problems. Getting a group, if you look at Alibaba, Jack Ma was telling me

1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:55.040
 that they basically were at financial death's door at least twice. The fact that it wasn't

1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:01.520
 just Jack, people think it is because he became the public face and the driver,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:12.720
 but a group of people who can give advice, share situations to talk about, that's really important.

1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:16.800
 And that's not just referring to the small details like renting space.

1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:25.200
 It's also the psychological burden. Because most entrepreneurs at some point question what

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:29.760
 they're doing because it's not going so well or they're screwing it up and they don't know how to

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:37.440
 unscrew it up because we're all learning and it's hard to be learning when there are like

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:42.960
 25 variables going on. If you're missing four big ones, you can really make a mess.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:53.200
 And so the ability to in effect have either an outsider who's really smart that you can rely on

1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:59.040
 for certain type of things or other people who are working with you on a daily basis.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:08.800
 It's in most people who haven't had experience believe in the myth of the one person, one great

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:16.080
 person, you know, makes outcomes, creates outcomes that are positive. Most of us,

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:23.360
 it's not like that. If you look back over a lot of the big successful tech companies,

1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:31.120
 it's not typically one person. And you will know these stories better than I do. Because it's

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.720
 your world, not mine. But even I know that almost everyone of them had two people. I mean,

1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:43.520
 if you look at Google, that's what they had. And that was the same at Microsoft at the beginning.

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:51.600
 And it was the same at Apple. People have different skills and they need to play off of

1:03:51.600 --> 1:04:01.840
 other people. So, you know, the advice that I would give you is make sure you understand that so

1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:09.280
 you don't head off in some direction as a lone wolf and find that either you can invent all the

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:18.640
 solutions, or you make bad decisions on certain types of things. This is a team sport. Entrepreneur

1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:25.360
 means you're alone, in effect. And that's the myth. But it's mostly a myth.

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:31.200
 Yeah, I think, and you talk about this in your book, and I could talk to you about it forever,

1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:38.480
 the harshly self critical aspect to your personality, and to mine as well in the face

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:46.880
 of failure. It's a powerful tool, but it's also a burden that's very interesting, very interesting

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:53.920
 to walk that line. But let me ask in terms of people around you, in terms of friends,

1:04:55.200 --> 1:05:01.760
 in the bigger picture of your own life, what do you put the value of love, family, friendship

1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:09.440
 in the big picture journey of your life? Well, ultimately, all journeys are alone.

1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:24.640
 It's great to have support. And when you go forward and say, your job is to make something

1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:31.280
 work, and that's your number one priority, and you're going to work at it to make it work,

1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:38.960
 it's like superhuman effort. People don't become successful as part time workers. It doesn't work

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:49.680
 that way. And if you're prepared to make that 100 to 120% effort, you're going to need support,

1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:56.240
 and you're going to have to have people involved with your life who understand that that's really

1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:04.640
 part of your life. Sometimes you're involved with somebody, and they don't really understand that,

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:11.120
 and that's a source of conflict and difficulty. But if you're involved with the right people,

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:24.960
 whether it's a dating relationship or a spousal relationship, you have to involve them

1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:37.440
 in your life, but not burden them with every sort of minor triumph or mistake. They actually get

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:46.720
 bored with it after a while, and so you have to set up different types of ecosystems. You have your

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:54.640
 home life, you have your love life, you have children, and that's like the enduring part of

1:06:54.640 --> 1:07:06.000
 what you do. And then on the other side, you've got the sort of unpredictable nature of this type

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:14.000
 of work. What I say to people at my firm who are younger, usually, well, everybody's younger,

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.880
 but people who are of an age where they're just having their first child,

1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:31.440
 or maybe they have two children, that it's important to make sure they go away with their

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:40.080
 spouse at least once every two months. It's just some lovely place where there are no children,

1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:47.280
 no issues, sometimes once a month, if they're sort of energetic and clever.

1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:56.800
 Escape the craziness of it all? Yeah, and reaffirm your values as a couple,

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:05.520
 and you have to have fun. If you don't have fun with the person you're with and all you're doing

1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:13.040
 is dealing with issues, then that gets pretty old. And so you have to protect the fun element

1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:18.080
 of your life together. And the way to do that isn't by hanging around the house

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:26.560
 and dealing with more problems. You have to get away and reinforce and reinvigorate

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:32.480
 your relationship. And whenever I tell one of our younger people about that, they sort of look at

1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:37.760
 me and it's like the scales are falling off of their eyes and they're saying, jeez, I hadn't

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:43.440
 thought about that. I'm so enmeshed in all these things, but that's a great idea. And that's something

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:51.440
 as an entrepreneur, you also have to do. You just can't let relationships slip because you're half

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:58.160
 overwhelmed. Beautifully put, and I think there's no better place to end it. Steve, thank you so

1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:03.760
 much. I really appreciate it. It was an honor to talk to you. My pleasure. Thanks for listening to

1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:42.240
 Schwarzman's book, What It Takes. It's as hard to start and run a small business as it is to start

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:48.560
 a big one. You'll suffer the same toll financially and psychologically as you bludgeon it into

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:54.640
 existence. It's hard to raise the money and to find the right people. So if you're going to dedicate

1:09:54.640 --> 1:10:00.800
 your life to a business, which is the only way it will ever work, you should choose one with

1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:25.600
 the potential to be huge. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
