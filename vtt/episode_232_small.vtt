00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
 The following is a conversation with Brian Greene, theoretical physicist at Columbia

00:04.840 --> 00:11.560
 and author of many amazing books on physics, including his latest, Until the End of Time,

00:11.560 --> 00:17.080
 Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.160
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:22.520 --> 00:27.320
 And now, here's my conversation with Brian Greene.

00:27.320 --> 00:32.080
 In your most recent book, Until the End of Time, you quote Bertrand Russell from a debate

00:32.080 --> 00:35.080
 he had about God in 1948.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.440
 He says, quote,

00:36.440 --> 00:43.440
 So far, scientific evidence goes, the universe has crawled by slow stages to a somewhat pitiful

00:43.440 --> 00:49.760
 result on this Earth, and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages to a condition

00:49.760 --> 00:52.600
 of universal death.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.840
 If this is to be taken as evidence of purpose, I can only say that the purpose is one that

00:57.840 --> 00:59.560
 does not appeal to me.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.880
 I see no reason therefore to believe in any sort of God.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.120
 That's quite a depressing statement.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.520
 As you say, this is a bleak outlook on our universe and the emergence of human consciousness.

01:12.520 --> 01:17.280
 So let me ask, what is the more hopeful perspective to take on this story?

01:17.280 --> 01:25.760
 Well, I think the more hopeful perspective is to more fully understand what was driving

01:25.760 --> 01:33.120
 Bertrand Russell to this perspective, and then to see it within a broader context.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.840
 And really, that's in some sense what my book, Until the End of Time, is all about.

01:37.840 --> 01:43.520
 But in brief, I would say that there's a lot of truth to what Bertrand Russell was saying

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
 there.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.800
 Second law of thermodynamics, which is the underlying scientific idea that's driving

01:48.800 --> 01:53.320
 this notion that everything's going to wither, decay, fall apart.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.520
 Yeah, that's true.

01:55.520 --> 02:01.600
 Second law of thermodynamics establishes that disorder, entropy, and aggregate is always

02:01.600 --> 02:08.120
 on the rise, and that is indeed interpretable as disintegration and destruction over sufficiently

02:08.120 --> 02:09.640
 long time scales.

02:09.640 --> 02:17.200
 But my view is, when you recognize how special that makes us, that we are these exquisitely

02:17.200 --> 02:23.440
 ordered configurations of particles that only will last for a blink of an eye in cosmological

02:23.440 --> 02:29.960
 time like terms, the fact that we're here and we can do what we do, to me, that's just

02:29.960 --> 02:38.560
 really something that inspires gratitude and wonder and a sense of deep purpose by virtue

02:38.560 --> 02:44.840
 of being these unique collections of entities that happen to rise up, look around, and try

02:44.840 --> 02:48.680
 to figure out where we are and what the heck we should do with our time.

02:48.680 --> 02:56.160
 So it's not that I would disagree with Bertrand Russell in terms of the basic physics and

02:56.160 --> 03:01.680
 the basic unfolding, but I think it's really a matter of the slant that you take on what

03:01.680 --> 03:04.520
 it means for us.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.960
 So maybe we'll skip around a bit, but let me ask the biggest possible question, then

03:08.960 --> 03:13.240
 you said purpose, so what's the meaning of it all then?

03:13.240 --> 03:18.240
 Is there a meaning to life that we can take from this?

03:18.240 --> 03:25.360
 From this brief emergence of complexity that arises from simple things and then goes into

03:25.360 --> 03:30.920
 a heat death that is, once again, returns to simple things as the march of the second

03:30.920 --> 03:33.000
 law of thermodynamics goes on.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.760
 I think there is, but I don't think it's a universal answer.

03:36.760 --> 03:45.360
 And so I think throughout the ages, there has been a kind of quest for some final way

03:45.360 --> 03:50.960
 of articulating meaning and purpose, whether it's God, whether it's love, whether it's

03:50.960 --> 03:51.960
 companionship.

03:51.960 --> 03:56.960
 I mean, many people put forward different ways of taking this question on.

03:56.960 --> 04:04.040
 And there is no one right answer when you recognize deeply that the universe doesn't

04:04.040 --> 04:05.160
 care.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.960
 There is nothing out there that is the final answer.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.640
 It's not as though we need a more powerful telescope and somehow if we can look deeply

04:13.640 --> 04:16.840
 into the universe, all will become clear.

04:16.840 --> 04:22.440
 In fact, the deeper we've looked, but literally and metaphorically, into the universe and

04:22.440 --> 04:29.680
 into the structure of reality, the more it's become clear that we are just a momentary

04:29.680 --> 04:36.240
 byproduct of laws of physics that don't have any emotional content.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.840
 They don't have any intrinsic sense of meaning or purpose.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.320
 And when you recognize that, you realize that searching for the universal for this kind

04:44.320 --> 04:48.000
 of a question is a fool's errand.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.960
 Every individual has the capacity to make their own meaning, to set their own purpose.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.040
 And that's not some platitude.

04:56.040 --> 04:59.840
 That is what we are, because there is no fundamental answer.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.200
 It's what you make of it.

05:01.200 --> 05:08.600
 And however much that may sound like a hallmark card, this really is the deep lesson of physics

05:08.600 --> 05:11.080
 and science more generally over the past few hundred years.

05:11.080 --> 05:16.320
 Well, there's some level where you can objectively say that whatever we've got going on here

05:16.320 --> 05:18.120
 is kind of peculiar.

05:18.120 --> 05:23.560
 It's kind of special in terms of complexity.

05:23.560 --> 05:30.080
 And maybe you can even begin to measure it and come up with metrics where whatever we

05:30.080 --> 05:38.080
 got going on on Earth, these interesting hierarchical complexities that form more and more sophisticated

05:38.080 --> 05:45.560
 biological system, that seems kind of unique when you look at the entire universe.

05:45.560 --> 05:49.480
 The observable part that we can see with our tools.

05:49.480 --> 05:55.080
 So I have to ask, as you described in your book once again, Schrodinger wrote the book

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
 What is Life?

05:56.080 --> 05:59.320
 Based on a few lectures he gave in 1944.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.920
 So let me ask the fundamental question here.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.640
 What is life?

06:04.640 --> 06:08.880
 This particular thing we got going on here, this pocket of complexity that emerged from

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
 such simple things.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.600
 Yeah, it's a tough question.

06:11.600 --> 06:18.440
 I asked that question even to Richard Dawkins once and I already have my preconceived notion,

06:18.440 --> 06:24.840
 which he pretty much confirmed, which is if one could give an answer to that question

06:24.840 --> 06:30.720
 that allows you to sort of draw a line in the sand between the not living and the living,

06:30.720 --> 06:35.480
 then perhaps we would have the insight that we yearn for in trying to say what is so special

06:35.480 --> 06:36.480
 about life.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.360
 But the fact of the matter is it's a continuum.

06:39.360 --> 06:44.080
 There's a continuum from the things that we would typically call non living inanimate

06:44.080 --> 06:50.440
 to the things that we obviously call animate and full of the currents of life.

06:50.440 --> 06:56.080
 Somewhere in there, it is a question of the complexity of the structure, the ability of

06:56.080 --> 07:04.000
 the structure to take in raw material from the environment and process it through a metabolism

07:04.000 --> 07:11.640
 that allows the structure to extract energy and to release entropy to the wider environment.

07:11.640 --> 07:18.880
 Somewhere in those collections of biological processes is the necessity or the necessary

07:18.880 --> 07:24.560
 ingredients and processes for life, but drawing that line in the sand is not something that

07:24.560 --> 07:27.640
 we're able to do, but I would agree with you.

07:27.640 --> 07:35.080
 It's deeply peculiar, it may in fact be unique, but it may not.

07:35.080 --> 07:43.240
 It could be that the universe is such that under fairly typical conditions, a star that's

07:43.240 --> 07:50.080
 a well ordered source of low entropy energy, that's what the sun is, together with a planet

07:50.080 --> 07:57.160
 being bathed by that low entropy energy, together with a surface that has enough of the raw

07:57.160 --> 08:03.080
 constituents that we recognize are fairly commonplace result of supernova explosions

08:03.080 --> 08:09.320
 where star spews forth the result of the nuclear furnace that is the core of a star.

08:09.320 --> 08:16.880
 It could be that all you need are those fairly commonplace conditions and maybe life naturally

08:16.880 --> 08:17.880
 forms.

08:17.880 --> 08:23.040
 Look, the James Webb Space Telescope is going up hopefully in December and one of the goals

08:23.040 --> 08:27.640
 of that mission is to look at atmospheres around distant planets and perhaps come to

08:27.640 --> 08:36.160
 some sense of how special or not life or life as we know it is in the universe.

08:36.160 --> 08:42.240
 Which part of the story of life, let's stick to earth for a second, do you think is the

08:42.240 --> 08:43.240
 hardest?

08:43.240 --> 08:48.480
 If you were like a betting man, which part is the hardest to make happen?

08:48.480 --> 08:54.120
 Is it the origin of life, again we haven't drawn the line of word, as you say, the line

08:54.120 --> 08:58.120
 between a rock and a rabbit?

08:58.120 --> 09:03.360
 That part, is it complex organisms like multi cellular organisms?

09:03.360 --> 09:09.520
 Is it crawling out of the ocean where the fish somehow figured out how to crawl around?

09:09.520 --> 09:17.480
 Is it then the us Homo sapiens as we like to think of ourselves special and intelligent?

09:17.480 --> 09:23.840
 Or is it somewhere in between as you also talk about, again, very hard to know at which

09:23.840 --> 09:29.080
 point this consciousness emerge?

09:29.080 --> 09:35.320
 If you were to sort of took a survey and made bets about other earth like planets in the

09:35.320 --> 09:38.520
 universe, where do you think they get stuck the most?

09:38.520 --> 09:41.800
 Well, I would certainly see if we're going to go all the way to conscious beings like

09:41.800 --> 09:47.440
 ourselves, I would put it at the onset of consciousness, which again, I think is a continuum

09:47.440 --> 09:51.760
 I don't think it is something that you can draw the line in the sand.

09:51.760 --> 09:56.120
 But there are obvious circumstances, there are obvious creatures such as ourselves where

09:56.120 --> 10:02.160
 we do recognize a certain kind of self reflective conscious awareness.

10:02.160 --> 10:10.960
 And if we think about what it would require for a system of living beings to acquire consciousness,

10:10.960 --> 10:16.920
 I think that's probably the hardest part because look, take Earth and recognize that

10:16.920 --> 10:24.280
 weren't for some singular event 65 million years ago where this large rock slams into

10:24.280 --> 10:31.360
 planet Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs, maybe the dinosaurs would still rule the planet

10:31.360 --> 10:39.080
 and they may well have not developed the kind of conscious awareness that we have.

10:39.080 --> 10:44.920
 So for billions of years on this planet, there was life that didn't have the kind of conscious

10:44.920 --> 10:47.280
 awareness that we have.

10:47.280 --> 10:55.760
 And it was an accidental event in astrophysical history that allowed a mammalian species like

10:55.760 --> 10:58.400
 us to ultimately be the end product.

10:58.400 --> 11:03.720
 And so yeah, I could imagine there's a lot of life out there, but perhaps none of it's

11:03.720 --> 11:08.920
 wondering what's the meaning of life or trying to make sense of it.

11:08.920 --> 11:13.720
 Just going about its business of survival, which of course is the dominant activity that

11:13.720 --> 11:15.680
 life on this planet has practiced.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.640
 We are a rare exception to that.

11:17.640 --> 11:22.640
 And I really appreciate that you lean into some of these unanswerable questions today.

11:22.640 --> 11:28.440
 But so you think about consciousness, not as like a phase shift, the binary zero one.

11:28.440 --> 11:35.480
 You think of it as a continuum that humans somehow are maybe some of the most conscious

11:35.480 --> 11:38.120
 beings on Earth.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.760
 So I mean, people will dispute that.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
 Yes.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.960
 And it's a very hard argument.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.240
 People will dispute that.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.480
 Rocks probably will stay quiet on the matter.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
 Maybe not.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
 Right.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.680
 For the moment, they're waiting for their opportunity.

11:52.680 --> 12:01.600
 But I agree that, look, even when you and I look at each other, I am not fully convinced

12:01.600 --> 12:03.080
 that you're a conscious being.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.080
 Right?

12:04.080 --> 12:05.080
 I mean, I think that you are.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.080
 It's not to me.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.400
 I mean, your behavior is such that that's the best explanation for what's going on.

12:09.400 --> 12:14.920
 But of course, we're all in the position of only having direct awareness of our own conscious

12:14.920 --> 12:16.640
 being.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.000
 And therefore, when it comes to other creatures in the world, we're in a similar state of

12:21.000 --> 12:26.720
 ignorance regarding what's actually happening inside of their head if they have a head.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.440
 And so it's hard to know how singular we are.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.720
 But I would say, based on the best available data and the best explanations that we can

12:34.720 --> 12:36.560
 make, yeah, there is something special about us.

12:36.560 --> 12:43.200
 I don't think that there are fish walking around and coming up with existentialism.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.600
 I don't know that there are dogs walking around who've developed an understanding of the general

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
 theory of relativity.

12:49.600 --> 12:54.280
 I mean, maybe we're wrong, but that seems the best explanation.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.920
 What do you think is more special intelligence or consciousness?

12:57.920 --> 12:59.480
 I think consciousness.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.640
 And I think that there's a deep connection between these ideas.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.800
 They are distinct, but they're deeply connected.

13:06.800 --> 13:11.080
 But look, I mean, to me and to, of course, many philosophers actually coined a name for

13:11.080 --> 13:15.560
 this, the hard problem of consciousness, David Chalmers and others.

13:15.560 --> 13:23.040
 As a physicist, I look out at the world and I see its particles governed by physical law.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
 We can name them.

13:24.040 --> 13:29.960
 You know, we've got electrons, we've got quarks that come in various flavors and so forth.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.560
 We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed.

13:33.560 --> 13:37.920
 And we have a list of laws that seemingly govern those ingredients.

13:37.920 --> 13:43.720
 And nowhere in there is there even a hint that when you put those particles together

13:43.720 --> 13:48.320
 in the right way, an inner world should turn on.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.960
 And it's not only that there's no hint.

13:50.960 --> 13:51.960
 It's insane.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.840
 I mean, it's ridiculous.

13:53.840 --> 14:01.280
 How could it be that a thoughtless, passionless, emotionless particle, when grouped together

14:01.280 --> 14:08.560
 with compatriots, somehow can yield something so deeply foreign to the nature of the ingredients

14:08.560 --> 14:09.560
 themselves?

14:09.560 --> 14:16.440
 So, so answering that question, I think is among the deepest and most difficult questions

14:16.440 --> 14:17.960
 that we face.

14:17.960 --> 14:26.400
 Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem or is it possible?

14:26.400 --> 14:30.080
 I think you mentioned in your book that it's just like almost like a side effect.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.280
 It's an emergent thing that's like, oh, it's nice.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.840
 It's like a nice little feature.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
 Yeah.

14:35.840 --> 14:40.320
 Well, I mean, when people use the phrase hard problem, I mean, they mean in a somewhat technical

14:40.320 --> 14:48.800
 sense that it's trying to explain something that seems fundamentally unavailable to third

14:48.800 --> 14:53.120
 party objective analysis, right?

14:53.120 --> 14:57.640
 I'm the only one that can get inside my head and I can tell you a lot about what's happening

14:57.640 --> 15:02.080
 inside my head right now is reflected in what I'm saying and you can try to deduce things

15:02.080 --> 15:05.400
 about what's going on inside my head, but you don't have access to it in the way that

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
 I do.

15:06.400 --> 15:11.360
 And so it seems like a fundamentally different kind of problem from the ones that we have

15:11.360 --> 15:15.040
 successfully dealt with over the course of centuries in science where we look at the

15:15.040 --> 15:18.360
 motion of the moon, everybody can look, everybody can measure it.

15:18.360 --> 15:23.840
 We look at, you know, the properties of hydrogen when you shine lasers on everybody can look

15:23.840 --> 15:26.040
 at the data and understand it.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.920
 And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem in that sense.

15:29.920 --> 15:33.840
 It seems like it is hard relative to the others.

15:33.840 --> 15:40.520
 But I do think ultimately that the explanation will be, as you recount, I think that a hundred

15:40.520 --> 15:45.680
 years from now, or maybe it's a thousand, it's hard to predict the time scale for developments,

15:45.680 --> 15:51.560
 but I think we'll get to a place where we'll look back and kind of smile at those folks

15:51.560 --> 15:57.160
 in the 20th century and before 21st century and before who thought consciousness was so

15:57.160 --> 16:04.000
 incredibly mysterious when the reality of it is, eh, it's just a thing that happens when

16:04.000 --> 16:06.240
 particles come together.

16:06.240 --> 16:12.040
 And however mysterious that feels right now, I think, for instance, when we start to build

16:12.040 --> 16:16.320
 conscious systems, you know, things that you're more familiar with than I am, when we start

16:16.320 --> 16:23.200
 to build these artificial systems and those systems report to us, I'm feeling sad, you

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
 know, I'm feeling anxious.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.640
 Yeah, there's a world going on inside here.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.560
 I think the mystery of consciousness will just begin to evaporate.

16:30.560 --> 16:35.840
 Well, first of all, beautifully put, and I agree with you completely, just the way you

16:35.840 --> 16:38.440
 said it, it'll begin to evaporate.

16:38.440 --> 16:48.040
 I have built quite a few robots and have had them do emotional type things, and it's immediate

16:48.040 --> 16:52.880
 that exactly what you're saying, this kind of mystery of consciousness starts to evaporate,

16:52.880 --> 16:59.320
 that the kind of need to truly understand, to solve the hard problem of consciousness

16:59.320 --> 17:05.920
 like disappears because, well, I don't really care if I understand or can solve the hard

17:05.920 --> 17:07.560
 problem of consciousness.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.240
 That thing sure as heck looks conscious, you know, I feel like that way when I interact

17:11.240 --> 17:19.840
 with a dog, I don't need to solve the problem of consciousness to be able to interact and

17:19.840 --> 17:25.400
 richly enjoy the experience with this other living being, obviously the same thing with

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
 other humans.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.280
 I don't need to fully understand it.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.080
 And there's some aspect, maybe this is a little bit too engineering focused, but there's some

17:33.080 --> 17:40.240
 aspect in which it feels like consciousness is just a nice trick to help us communicate

17:40.240 --> 17:41.800
 with each other.

17:41.800 --> 17:51.200
 It sounds ridiculous to say, but sort of the ability to experience the world is very useful

17:51.200 --> 17:57.440
 in a subjective sense, is very useful to put yourself in that world and to be able to describe

17:57.440 --> 17:58.920
 the experience to others.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
 Yeah.

17:59.920 --> 18:05.560
 It's a social and the merge, obviously animals, the sort of more primitive animals might experience

18:05.560 --> 18:12.200
 consciousness in some more primitive way, but this kind of rich subjective experience

18:12.200 --> 18:16.600
 that we think about as humans, I think it's probably deeply coupled with like language

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
 and poetry.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
 Yeah.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.640
 That resonates with my view as well.

18:20.640 --> 18:25.360
 I mean, there's a scientist, maybe you've spoken to Michael Graziano from Princeton.

18:25.360 --> 18:31.720
 He's developed ideas of consciousness that look, I don't think they solve the problem,

18:31.720 --> 18:39.600
 but I think they do illuminate it in an interesting way where basically we are not aware of all

18:39.600 --> 18:46.520
 the underlying physiochemical processes that make our brains and our inner worlds tick

18:46.520 --> 18:48.160
 the way they do.

18:48.160 --> 18:54.960
 And because of that dissociation between sensation and the physics of it and the chemistry of

18:54.960 --> 19:01.080
 it and the biology of it, it feels like our minds and our inner worlds are just untethered,

19:01.080 --> 19:06.760
 like floating somewhere in this gray matter inside of our heads.

19:06.760 --> 19:14.760
 And the way I like to think of it is like, look, if you were in a dark room and I had

19:14.760 --> 19:20.560
 blown the dark paint on my fingers, so all you saw was my fingers dancing around, there

19:20.560 --> 19:22.480
 would be something mysterious.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.480
 How could those fingers be doing that?

19:24.480 --> 19:28.080
 And then you turn on light and realize, oh, there's this arm underlying it, and that's

19:28.080 --> 19:30.960
 the deep physical connection explains it all.

19:30.960 --> 19:35.720
 And I think that's what we're missing, the deep physical connection between what's happening

19:35.720 --> 19:41.640
 up here and what is responsible for it in a physical, chemical, biological way.

19:41.640 --> 19:45.520
 And so to me, that at least gives me some understanding of why consciousness feels so

19:45.520 --> 19:52.440
 mysterious because we are suppressing all of the underlying science that ultimately

19:52.440 --> 19:53.600
 is responsible for it.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.640
 And one day we will reveal that more fully, and I think that will help us tether this

19:58.640 --> 20:01.560
 experience to something quite tangible in the world.

20:01.560 --> 20:10.320
 I wonder if the mystery is an important component of enjoying something.

20:10.320 --> 20:19.400
 So once we know how this thing works, maybe we will no longer enjoy this conversation.

20:19.400 --> 20:25.360
 We'll seek other sources of enjoyment, but this is again from an engineering perspective.

20:25.360 --> 20:29.200
 I wonder if the mystery is an important component.

20:29.200 --> 20:38.440
 Well, have you ever seen this beautiful interview that Richard Feynman did, great Nobel Laureate

20:38.440 --> 20:42.640
 physicist responsible for a lot of our understanding of quantum mechanics, quantum fielding and

20:42.640 --> 20:43.640
 so forth?

20:43.640 --> 20:48.720
 And he was in a conversation with an interviewer where he noted that some people feel like

20:48.720 --> 20:57.400
 once the mystery is gone, once science explains something, the beauty goes away.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.400
 The wonder of it goes away.

20:58.400 --> 21:04.320
 And he was emphasizing in his response to that, he was like, no, that's not the right

21:04.320 --> 21:05.320
 way of thinking about it.

21:05.320 --> 21:11.560
 He says, look, when I look at a rose, he says, yeah, I can still deeply enjoy the aroma,

21:11.560 --> 21:14.000
 the color, the texture.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.880
 He says, but what I can do that you can't, if you're not a physicist, I can look more

21:17.880 --> 21:21.720
 deeply and understand where the red comes from, where the aroma comes from, where the

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
 structure comes from.

21:22.720 --> 21:28.040
 He says, that only augments my wonder.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.920
 It only augments my experience.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.680
 It doesn't flatten it or take away from it.

21:32.680 --> 21:41.720
 So I sort of take that as a bit of a motto in some sense, that there is a wonder that

21:41.720 --> 21:46.040
 comes from a kind of ignorance, and I don't mean that in a derogatory sense, but just

21:46.040 --> 21:47.040
 from not knowing.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.840
 So there is a wonder that comes from mystery.

21:49.840 --> 21:56.000
 There's another kind of wonder that comes from knowing and deep knowing.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
 And I think that kind of wonder has its own special character that in some ways can be

22:02.000 --> 22:04.640
 more gratifying.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.080
 I hope he's right.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.600
 I hope you're right.

22:07.600 --> 22:13.680
 But there's also, I remember he said something about like sizes and onion or something like

22:13.680 --> 22:14.680
 that.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.680
 You can peel back.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.680
 You can keep peeling back.

22:16.680 --> 22:21.200
 I mean, there is also, when you understand something, there's always a sense that there's

22:21.200 --> 22:23.720
 more mystery to understand.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.800
 You never get to the bottom of the mystery.

22:25.800 --> 22:32.920
 But I think it's also different than, I don't think you can analogize, I say, to a magician.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.400
 A magician does some trick.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.400
 You learn how it's done.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.920
 It's like, oh my God, that's ridiculous when you find.

22:39.920 --> 22:45.480
 But nature is perhaps the best magician if you want to try to make the analogy there.

22:45.480 --> 22:50.760
 Because when you peel things back and you understand how it is that things have color

22:50.760 --> 22:58.520
 and you have electrons dancing from one orbital to another, emitting photons at very particular

22:58.520 --> 23:03.680
 wavelengths that are described by these beautiful equations of quantum electrodynamics, part

23:03.680 --> 23:10.480
 of which that Feynman developed, it gives you a greater sense of awe when the curtain

23:10.480 --> 23:16.040
 is pulled back than what happens in other circumstances where it does flatten it completely.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.040
 Yeah.

23:17.040 --> 23:22.120
 It's very possible then, say in physics, that we arrive at a theory of everything that unifies

23:22.120 --> 23:26.760
 the laws of physics and has a very strong understanding of the fabric of reality.

23:26.760 --> 23:33.560
 Even like from the Big Bang to today, it's possible that that understanding is only going

23:33.560 --> 23:37.200
 to elevate our appreciation of this whole thing.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.200
 Yeah.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
 I think it will.

23:39.200 --> 23:45.480
 Because it has so far, but the other side of it which you emphasize is, it's not like

23:45.480 --> 23:49.480
 science somehow reaches an end.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.960
 There are certain categories of questions that do reach an end.

23:52.960 --> 23:58.040
 I think we one day will close the book on nature's ingredients and the fundamental laws.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.880
 Now, we can't prove that.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.600
 Maybe it goes on forever, smaller and smaller.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.960
 Maybe they're deeper and deeper laws.

24:03.960 --> 24:04.960
 But I don't think so.

24:04.960 --> 24:09.480
 I think that there's going to be a collection of ingredients and a collection of basic laws.

24:09.480 --> 24:13.720
 That chapter will close, but it's one chapter.

24:13.720 --> 24:18.560
 Now, we take that knowledge and we try to understand how the world builds the structures

24:18.560 --> 24:25.520
 that it does from planets to people to black holes to the possibility of other universes

24:25.520 --> 24:30.560
 and every step of the way, the collection of questions that we don't know the answer

24:30.560 --> 24:32.520
 to only blossoms.

24:32.520 --> 24:39.360
 So there's a deep sense of gratification from understanding certain qualities of the world.

24:39.360 --> 24:45.640
 But I would say that if you take a ratio of what we understand to the things that we know

24:45.640 --> 24:50.560
 that we don't yet understand, that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller because the things

24:50.560 --> 24:54.680
 that we know that we don't understand grows larger and larger.

24:54.680 --> 25:00.400
 Do you have a hope that we solve that theory of everything puzzle in the next few decades?

25:00.400 --> 25:05.840
 So there's been a bunch of attempts from string theory to all kinds of attempts at trying

25:05.840 --> 25:10.480
 to solve quantum gravity or basically come up with a theory for quantum gravity.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.600
 There's a lot of complexities to this.

25:13.600 --> 25:18.560
 One for experimental validation, you have to observe effects that are very difficult

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
 to measure.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.840
 So you have to build, like that's like an engineering challenge.

25:23.840 --> 25:28.840
 And then there's the theory challenge, which is like, it seems very difficult to connect

25:28.840 --> 25:31.880
 to the laws of gravity to quantum mechanics.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.440
 Do you have a hope or are we hopelessly stuck?

25:35.440 --> 25:37.640
 Well, I have to have a hope.

25:37.640 --> 25:43.560
 I mean, it's in some sense, but I devote at least part of my professional life toward

25:43.560 --> 25:45.000
 trying to make progress on.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.520
 I'm glad you use the phrase quantum gravity.

25:47.520 --> 25:52.880
 I'm not a great fan of the theory of everything phrase because it does make other scientists

25:52.880 --> 25:55.720
 feel like if they're not working on this, what are they working on?

25:55.720 --> 25:59.000
 And it's like, you know, there's not much left when you're talking about theory of everything.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.400
 Phyology is just a small detail to figure out.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.480
 So it is really trying to put gravity and quantum mechanics together.

26:06.480 --> 26:13.640
 And since I was a college kid, I was deeply fascinated with gravity.

26:13.640 --> 26:19.520
 And as I learned quantum mechanics, the notion of physicists being stumped and trying to

26:19.520 --> 26:24.680
 blend them together, how could one not get fired up about maybe contributing something

26:24.680 --> 26:26.080
 to that journey?

26:26.080 --> 26:30.120
 And so we've been on this, you know, I've been on this for 30 years since I was a student.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.880
 We have made progress.

26:31.880 --> 26:32.880
 We do have ideas.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.400
 You mentioned string theory is one possible scenario.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.800
 It's not stuck.

26:37.800 --> 26:43.920
 String theory is a vibrant field of research that is making incredible progress.

26:43.920 --> 26:49.600
 But we've not made progress on this issue of experimental verification validation, which

26:49.600 --> 26:54.080
 as you know, it is a vital part of the story.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.760
 So I would have hoped that by now we would have made contact with observation if you

26:58.760 --> 27:04.440
 would have interviewed me back in the 80s when I was, you know, a wild, bright eyed

27:04.440 --> 27:07.880
 kid trying to make headway, working 18 hours a day and this sort of stuff.

27:07.880 --> 27:12.160
 I would have said, yeah, by 2021, yeah, we're going to know whether it's right or wrong.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.560
 We'll have made contact.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.880
 I would have said, look, there may be certain mathematical puzzles that we've got to work

27:16.880 --> 27:21.640
 out, but we'll know enough to make contact with experiment that has not happened.

27:21.640 --> 27:26.160
 On the other hand, if you would have interviewed me back then and asked me, will we be able

27:26.160 --> 27:34.120
 to talk about detailed qualities of black holes and understand them at the level of

27:34.120 --> 27:39.000
 detail that we actually, I would have said, no, I don't think that we're going to be

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
 able to do that.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.680
 Will we have an exact formulation of string theory in certain circumstances?

27:43.680 --> 27:46.720
 No, I don't think we're going to have that and yet we do.

27:46.720 --> 27:52.040
 So it's just to say you don't know where the progress is going to happen, but yes, I do

27:52.040 --> 27:58.200
 hold out hope that maybe before I move on to wherever, I don't think there is an after,

27:58.200 --> 28:04.400
 but I would love before I leave this earth to know the answer.

28:04.400 --> 28:10.520
 But you know, science and the universe, it's not about pleasing any individual.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.680
 It is what it is.

28:11.680 --> 28:15.120
 And so we just press onward and we'll see where it goes.

28:15.120 --> 28:20.560
 So in terms of string theory, if I just look from an outsider's perspective currently at

28:20.560 --> 28:25.920
 the theoretical physics community, string theory is the theory was as a theory has been very

28:25.920 --> 28:31.440
 popular for a few decades, but it has recently fallen out of favor, or at least there's been

28:31.440 --> 28:37.640
 like, you know, it became more popular to kind of ask the question, is string theory

28:37.640 --> 28:39.520
 really the answer?

28:39.520 --> 28:41.040
 Where do you fall on this?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.320
 Like how do you make sense of this puzzle?

28:43.320 --> 28:45.440
 Why do you think it has fallen out of favor?

28:45.440 --> 28:50.240
 Yeah, so I would actually challenge the statement that's fallen out of favor.

28:50.240 --> 28:58.560
 I would say that any field of research when it's new and it's the bright, shiny bicycle

28:58.560 --> 29:04.440
 that no one has yet seen on that block, yeah, it's going to attract attention and the news

29:04.440 --> 29:09.280
 outlets are going to cover it and students are going to flock to it, sure.

29:09.280 --> 29:16.520
 But as a field matures, it does shed those qualities because it's no longer as novel

29:16.520 --> 29:21.480
 as it was when it was first introduced 30, 40 years ago, but you need to judge it by

29:21.480 --> 29:22.480
 a different standard.

29:22.480 --> 29:29.280
 You need to judge it by, is it making progress on foundational issues deepening our understanding

29:29.280 --> 29:30.280
 of the subject?

29:30.280 --> 29:36.680
 And by that measure, string theory is scoring very high.

29:36.680 --> 29:41.200
 Now at the same time, you also need to judge whether it makes contact with experiment,

29:41.200 --> 29:46.000
 as we discussed before too, and on that measure, we're still challenged.

29:46.000 --> 29:55.360
 So I would say that many string theories, myself included, are very sober about the theory.

29:55.360 --> 30:00.800
 It has the tremendous progress that it had 30, 40 years ago that hasn't gone away, but

30:00.800 --> 30:07.560
 we've become better equipped at assessing the long journey ahead.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.440
 And that was something that we weren't particularly good at back, say, in the 80s.

30:11.440 --> 30:17.400
 Look, when I was just starting out in the field, there was a sense of physics is about

30:17.400 --> 30:19.280
 to end.

30:19.280 --> 30:25.120
 String theory is about to be the be all and end all final unified theory, and that will

30:25.120 --> 30:27.880
 bring this chapter to a close.

30:27.880 --> 30:32.040
 Now I have to say, I think it was more the younger physicists who were saying that.

30:32.040 --> 30:36.080
 Some of them were seasoned, even if they were pro string theory at the time, I don't know

30:36.080 --> 30:41.760
 if they were rolling their eyes, but they knew that was going to be a long, long journey.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.920
 I think people like John Schwartz, one of the founders of string theory, Michael Green,

30:45.920 --> 30:51.480
 no relation to me, founders of the theory, Edward Whitten, one of the main people driving

30:51.480 --> 30:59.320
 the theory back then and today, I think they knew that we were in for a long haul.

30:59.320 --> 31:06.320
 And that's the nature of science, quick hits that resolve everything, few and far between.

31:06.320 --> 31:14.040
 And so if you were in for the quick solution to the big questions of the world, then you

31:14.040 --> 31:15.160
 would have been disappointed.

31:15.160 --> 31:19.880
 And I think there were people who were disappointed and moved on and work on other subjects.

31:19.880 --> 31:25.920
 If we were in in the way that Einstein was in, for a lifetime of investigation to try

31:25.920 --> 31:32.240
 to see what the answers to the deep questions would be, then I think string theory has been

31:32.240 --> 31:40.560
 a rich source of material that has kept so many people deeply engaged in moving the frontier

31:40.560 --> 31:41.560
 forward.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.400
 There's a few qualities about string theory, which are weird.

31:44.400 --> 31:49.040
 I mean, a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.200
 So let me ask the question, what do you as most beautiful boss string theory?

31:53.200 --> 32:00.040
 Well, what attracted me to the theory at the outset, beyond its putting gravity and quantum

32:00.040 --> 32:05.360
 mechanics together, which I think is its true claim to fame, at least on paper, it's able

32:05.360 --> 32:06.880
 to do that.

32:06.880 --> 32:11.280
 What attracted me to here was the fact that it requires extra dimensions of space.

32:11.280 --> 32:19.000
 And this was an idea that intrigued me in a very deep way, even before I really understood

32:19.000 --> 32:20.560
 what it meant.

32:20.560 --> 32:25.720
 I somehow had, I mean, talk about sort of the emotional part of consciousness and the

32:25.720 --> 32:31.880
 cognitive part in some, perhaps you call it strange and some strange emotional way.

32:31.880 --> 32:38.120
 I was enamored with Einstein's general relativity, the idea of curved space and time before I

32:38.120 --> 32:39.520
 really knew what it meant.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.160
 It just spoke to me.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.400
 I don't know how else to say it.

32:43.400 --> 32:49.200
 And then when I subsequently learned that people had thought about more dimensions of

32:49.200 --> 32:55.000
 space than we can see and how those extra dimensions would be vital to a deep understanding

32:55.000 --> 32:59.640
 of the things that we do see in this world, four or five, six dimensions might explain

32:59.640 --> 33:03.400
 why there are certain forces and particles and how they behave.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.480
 To me, this was like amazing, utterly amazing.

33:06.480 --> 33:11.560
 And then when I learned that string theory embraced all these ideas, embraced the general

33:11.560 --> 33:17.400
 theory of relativity, embraced quantum mechanics, embraced the possibility of extra dimensions,

33:17.400 --> 33:19.200
 then I was hooked.

33:19.200 --> 33:24.760
 And so when I was a graduate student, we would just spend hours, we, I mean, a couple of

33:24.760 --> 33:29.480
 other graduate students and myself who had sort of worked really well together, was at

33:29.480 --> 33:31.000
 Oxford in England.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.400
 We would work these enormous numbers of hours a day trying to understand the shapes of these

33:35.400 --> 33:40.640
 extra dimensions, the geometry of them, what those geometrical shapes for the extra dimensions

33:40.640 --> 33:43.800
 would imply for things that we see in the world around us.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.040
 And it was a, it was a heady, heady time.

33:47.040 --> 33:52.760
 And that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through over the decades, but I'd say that's

33:52.760 --> 34:00.280
 really the, the part of the theory that I think really hooked me most strongly.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.760
 How are we supposed to think about those extra dimensions?

34:02.760 --> 34:08.440
 I was supposed to imagine actual physical reality or is this more in the space of mathematics

34:08.440 --> 34:14.680
 that allows you to sort of come up with tricks to describe the four dimensional reality that

34:14.680 --> 34:17.480
 we more directly perceive?

34:17.480 --> 34:22.480
 No one really knows the answer, of course, but if I take the most straightforward approach

34:22.480 --> 34:28.120
 to string theory, you really are imagining that these dimensions are there.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.120
 They're real.

34:29.120 --> 34:33.560
 I mean, just as you would say that the three space dimensions around us, you know, left,

34:33.560 --> 34:37.960
 right, back, forth, up, down, yeah, we, they're real, they're here.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.440
 We are immersed within those dimensions.

34:40.440 --> 34:46.240
 These other dimensions are as real as these with the one difference being their shape

34:46.240 --> 34:51.560
 and their size differs from the shape and size of the dimensions that we have direct

34:51.560 --> 34:54.920
 access to through, through human experience.

34:54.920 --> 35:01.280
 And one approach imagines that these extra dimensions are tightly coiled up, curled up,

35:01.280 --> 35:08.960
 crushed together, if you will, into a beautiful geometrical form that's all around us, but

35:08.960 --> 35:14.000
 just too small for us to detect with our eyes, too small for us to detect even with the most

35:14.000 --> 35:16.360
 powerful equipment that we have.

35:16.360 --> 35:21.560
 Nevertheless, according to the mathematics, the size and the shape of those extra dimensions

35:21.560 --> 35:25.040
 leaves an imprint in the world that we do have access to.

35:25.040 --> 35:31.400
 So one of the ways that we have hoped yet to achieve to make contact with experimental

35:31.400 --> 35:36.040
 physics is to see a signature of those extra dimensions in places like the Large Hadron

35:36.040 --> 35:38.640
 Collider in Geneva, Switzerland.

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
 And it hasn't happened yet.

35:39.640 --> 35:45.200
 It doesn't mean it won't happen, but that would be a stunning moment in the history

35:45.200 --> 35:52.200
 of the species if data that we acquired in these dimensions gives us kind of incontrovertible

35:52.200 --> 35:55.720
 evidence that these dimensions are not the only dimensions.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.320
 I mean, how mind blowing would that be?

35:59.320 --> 36:03.200
 So with the Large Hadron Collider, it would be something in the movement of the particles

36:03.200 --> 36:09.500
 or also the gravitational waves potentially be a place where you can detect signs of multiple

36:09.500 --> 36:12.560
 dimensions like with something like LIGO, but much more accurate.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.640
 In principle, all of these can work.

36:14.640 --> 36:19.920
 So one of the experiments that we had high hopes for, but by high hopes, I'm actually

36:19.920 --> 36:21.160
 exaggerating.

36:21.160 --> 36:27.200
 One of the experiments that we imagined might in the best of all circumstances yield some

36:27.200 --> 36:28.200
 insight.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.120
 We weren't with baited breath waiting for the result.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.720
 We knew it was a long shot.

36:31.720 --> 36:36.200
 When you slam protons together at very high speed of the Large Hadron Collider, if there

36:36.200 --> 36:41.720
 are these extra dimensions and if they have the right form, and that's a hypothesis that

36:41.720 --> 36:43.320
 may not be correct.

36:43.320 --> 36:49.200
 But when the protons collide, they can create debris, energetic debris that can in some sense

36:49.200 --> 36:53.920
 leave our dimensions and insert itself into the other dimensions.

36:53.920 --> 36:59.080
 And the way you'd recognize that is there'd be more energy before the collision than after

36:59.080 --> 37:04.120
 the collision because the debris would have taken energy away from the place where our

37:04.120 --> 37:06.600
 detectors can detect it.

37:06.600 --> 37:12.120
 So that's one real concrete way that you could find evidence for extra dimensions.

37:12.120 --> 37:19.400
 But yeah, since extra dimensions are of space and gravity is something that exists within,

37:19.400 --> 37:26.480
 in fact, is associated with the shape of space, gravitational waves in principle can provide

37:26.480 --> 37:35.400
 a kind of cat scan of the extra dimensions if you had sufficient control over those processes.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.760
 We don't yet, or perhaps one day we will.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.640
 Does it make you sad a little bit?

37:41.640 --> 37:46.320
 Are you looking out into the future, you mentioned Ed Whitton, that no Nobel Prizes have been

37:46.320 --> 37:48.960
 given yet related to string theory?

37:48.960 --> 37:50.360
 Do you think they will be?

37:50.360 --> 37:55.200
 Do you think you have to have experimental validation or can a Nobel Prize be given?

37:55.200 --> 38:01.360
 Which I don't think has been given for quite a long time for purely sort of theoretical

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
 contributions.

38:02.360 --> 38:07.520
 Yeah, it certainly, as a matter of historical precedent, has been the case that those who

38:07.520 --> 38:17.480
 win the prize have established, investigated, illuminated a demonstrably real quality of

38:17.480 --> 38:18.800
 the world.

38:18.800 --> 38:26.160
 So gravitational waves, the prize was awarded after they were detected, not the mathematics

38:26.160 --> 38:31.160
 of it, but the actual detection of it, you know, the Higgs particle, you know, it was

38:31.160 --> 38:39.840
 an idea that came from the 1960s, Peter Higgs and others, in fact, and it wasn't until 2012,

38:39.840 --> 38:44.480
 on July 4th, when the announcement came that this particle had been detected, the Large

38:44.480 --> 38:49.160
 Hadron Collider, that people viewed it as eligible for the Nobel Prize.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.000
 The idea was there, the math was there, but you needed to confirm it.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.040
 Indeed, the prize ultimately was awarded, so I'm not surprised.

38:57.040 --> 39:03.000
 In fact, I would have been surprised if a Nobel Prize had been awarded in the arena

39:03.000 --> 39:09.120
 of string theory, because it's far too speculative right now, it's far too hypothetical.

39:09.120 --> 39:16.000
 In fact, I am sympathetic to the view that it really shouldn't be called string theory.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.880
 It degrades the word theory, because theory in science, of course, means the best available

39:22.880 --> 39:27.960
 explanation for the things that we observe in the world, the things that we measure in

39:27.960 --> 39:34.360
 experiments about the world, and string theory does not do that, at least not yet.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.720
 So it really should be the string hypothesis, right?

39:37.720 --> 39:42.920
 We're at an earlier stage of development, and that's not the kind of thing that Nobel

39:42.920 --> 39:45.760
 Prizes should be awarded for.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.880
 What do you think about the critics out there?

39:47.880 --> 39:53.600
 Peter White, he's from Columbia too, I think, Sabine Havenstader.

39:53.600 --> 39:58.440
 Is that a healthy thing, or should we sort of focus on sort of the optimism of these

39:58.440 --> 39:59.440
 hypotheses?

39:59.440 --> 40:10.760
 Yeah, it's actually a good way that you frame it, because I'm always somewhat repelled by

40:10.760 --> 40:18.680
 views of the world that start from the negative, try to cut down an idea, try to say that's

40:18.680 --> 40:22.320
 the wrong way of thinking about things, and so on.

40:22.320 --> 40:28.280
 I'm much more drawn, maybe because I'm an optimist, I'm much more drawn to those who

40:28.280 --> 40:35.920
 go out into the world with new ideas, and don't try to cut down one idea, but rather

40:35.920 --> 40:38.960
 present another one that might be better.

40:38.960 --> 40:44.440
 And so you make the first idea, maybe string the irrelevant, because you've come up with

40:44.440 --> 40:47.680
 the better approach to the world.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.240
 So do I think it's healthy look?

40:49.240 --> 40:56.560
 I think having a wide range of views and perspectives is generally a healthy thing.

40:56.560 --> 41:02.800
 I think it's good to have arguments within a subject in order that you stay fresh and

41:02.800 --> 41:06.560
 you stay focused on the things that matter.

41:06.560 --> 41:12.680
 But at the end of the day, I think it's a more vital contribution to give us something

41:12.680 --> 41:15.360
 new rather than to criticize something that's there.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.160
 Yeah, I'm totally with you.

41:17.160 --> 41:24.840
 But it could be just the nature of being an optimist, and also just a love of engineering.

41:24.840 --> 41:32.920
 It helps nobody by criticizing the rocket that somebody else built, just build a bigger,

41:32.920 --> 41:34.920
 cheaper, better rocket.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.760
 Exactly.

41:36.760 --> 41:42.200
 And that seems to be how human civilization can progress effectively.

41:42.200 --> 41:49.600
 We've mentioned the second law of thermodynamics, I got to ask you about time, and do you think

41:49.600 --> 41:53.680
 of time as emergent or fundamental to our universe?

41:53.680 --> 41:56.060
 I like to think of it as emergent.

41:56.060 --> 42:00.920
 I don't have a solid reason for that perspective.

42:00.920 --> 42:05.320
 I have a lot of hints of reasons that some of which come out of string theory and quantum

42:05.320 --> 42:09.480
 gravity that perhaps would be worth talking about.

42:09.480 --> 42:17.680
 But what I would say is time is the most familiar quality of experience because there's nothing

42:17.680 --> 42:22.320
 that takes place, that doesn't take place within an interval of time.

42:22.320 --> 42:28.480
 And yet at the same time, it is perhaps the most mysterious quality of the world.

42:28.480 --> 42:34.840
 So it's a wonderful confluence of the familiar and the deeply mysterious, all in one little

42:34.840 --> 42:36.080
 package.

42:36.080 --> 42:41.000
 If you were to ask me, what is time, I don't really know, I don't think anybody does.

42:41.000 --> 42:48.800
 I can say what time gives us, it allows us the language for talking about change, it

42:48.800 --> 42:55.760
 allows us to envision the events of the universe being spread out in this temporal timeline

42:55.760 --> 43:01.680
 and in that way allows us to see the patterns that unfold within time.

43:01.680 --> 43:07.200
 I mean, time allows us the structure and the organization to think about things in that

43:07.200 --> 43:09.080
 kind of a progression.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.360
 But what actually is it?

43:11.360 --> 43:12.760
 I don't really know.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.840
 And that's so strange because we can measure it.

43:15.840 --> 43:22.320
 I mean, there are laboratories in the world that measure this thing called time to spectacular

43:22.320 --> 43:24.360
 precision.

43:24.360 --> 43:32.320
 But if you go up to the folks and say, what is it that you're actually measuring, I don't

43:32.320 --> 43:37.600
 know that they can really articulate the kind of answer that you would expect from those

43:37.600 --> 43:43.240
 who are engineering a device that can measure something called time to that level of precision.

43:43.240 --> 43:47.200
 So it's a very curious combination.

43:47.200 --> 43:51.440
 What do you make of the one way feeling of causality?

43:51.440 --> 43:59.720
 Is causality a thing or is that too just a human story that we put on top of this emergent

43:59.720 --> 44:00.720
 phenomenon of time?

44:00.720 --> 44:01.720
 I don't know.

44:01.720 --> 44:05.920
 I can give you my guess and my intuition about it.

44:05.920 --> 44:10.880
 I do think that at the macroscopic level, if we're talking about sort of the human experience

44:10.880 --> 44:17.040
 of time, I do think at the macroscopic level, there is a fundamental notion of causality

44:17.040 --> 44:21.840
 that does emerge from a starting point that may not have causality built in.

44:21.840 --> 44:27.280
 So I certainly would allow that at the deepest description of reality when we finally have

44:27.280 --> 44:33.640
 that on the table, we may not see causality directly at that fundamental level.

44:33.640 --> 44:39.520
 But I do believe that we will understand how to go from that fundamental level to a world

44:39.520 --> 44:46.440
 where at the macroscopic level, there is this notion of A causes B, a notion that Einstein

44:46.440 --> 44:52.000
 deeply embraced in his special theory of relativity, where he showed that time has qualities that

44:52.000 --> 44:54.440
 we wouldn't expect based on experience.

44:54.440 --> 44:59.800
 You and I, if we move relative to each other, our clocks tick off time at different rate.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.600
 And our clocks is just a means of measuring this thing called time.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.120
 So this is really time that we're talking about.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.320
 Time for you and time for me are different if we're in relative motion.

45:09.320 --> 45:15.280
 He then shows in the general theory of relativity that if we're experiencing different gravity,

45:15.280 --> 45:19.600
 different gravitational fields are actually more precisely different gravitational potentials.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.800
 Time will elapse for us at different rates.

45:21.800 --> 45:29.080
 These are things that are astoundingly strange that give rise to a scientific notion of time

45:29.080 --> 45:30.080
 travel.

45:30.080 --> 45:38.200
 So this is how far Einstein took us in wiping away the old understanding of time and injecting

45:38.200 --> 45:41.160
 a new understanding of its quality.

45:41.160 --> 45:46.720
 So there's so much about time that's counterintuitive, but I do not think that we're ever going

45:46.720 --> 45:50.400
 to wipe away causality at the macroscopic level.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.480
 At the macroscopic level, I mean, there's so many interesting things at the macroscopic

45:53.480 --> 45:56.880
 level that may only exist at the macroscopic level.

45:56.880 --> 46:01.160
 Like we already talked about consciousness that very well could be one of the things.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.360
 You mentioned time travel.

46:02.360 --> 46:12.580
 So I mean, according to Einstein and in general, what types of travel do you think our physical

46:12.580 --> 46:14.080
 universe allows?

46:14.080 --> 46:17.160
 Well, certainly allows time travel to the future.

46:17.160 --> 46:21.360
 And I'm not talking about the silly thing that you and I are now going into the future

46:21.360 --> 46:22.360
 second by second by second.

46:22.360 --> 46:27.880
 I'm talking about really the version that you see in Hollywood, at least in terms of

46:27.880 --> 46:39.240
 its net effect whereby an individual can follow an Einsteinian strategy and propel themselves

46:39.240 --> 46:42.360
 into the future in some sense more quickly.

46:42.360 --> 46:48.920
 So if I wanted to see what's happening on planet Earth one million years from now, Einstein

46:48.920 --> 46:53.280
 tells me how to get one million years from now, build a ship.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.320
 I got to turn to guys who know how to build stuff.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.600
 I can't do it like you build a ship that can go out into the universe near the speed of

47:00.600 --> 47:02.840
 light, turn around and come back.

47:02.840 --> 47:06.200
 Let's say it's a six month journey out a six month journey back.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.880
 And Einstein tells me how fast I need to travel, how close to the speed of light I need to

47:10.880 --> 47:16.920
 go so that when I step out of my ship, it will now be one million years into the future

47:16.920 --> 47:20.360
 on planet Earth.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.360
 And this is not a controversial statement, right?

47:23.360 --> 47:28.520
 This is not something where there's differences of opinion in the scientific community.

47:28.520 --> 47:34.840
 Any scientist who knows anything about what Einstein taught us agrees with what I just

47:34.840 --> 47:35.840
 said.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.000
 It's commonplace, it's bread and butter physics.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.240
 And so that kind of travel to the future is absolutely allowed by the laws of physics.

47:44.240 --> 47:47.800
 There are engineering challenges, there are technological challenges.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.760
 They're close to the speed of light part, yeah.

47:49.760 --> 47:52.800
 Yeah, and there are even biological challenges, right?

47:52.800 --> 47:57.320
 There are G forces that you're going to experience, you know, so there's all sorts of stuff embedded

47:57.320 --> 47:58.320
 in this.

47:58.320 --> 48:01.120
 But those, I will call the details.

48:01.120 --> 48:07.840
 And those details notwithstanding, the universe allows this kind of travel to the future.

48:07.840 --> 48:13.760
 And if I could pause real quick, you can also, at the macro level, with biology extend the

48:13.760 --> 48:19.760
 human lifespan to do a kind of travel forward in time.

48:19.760 --> 48:25.680
 If you expand how long we live, that's a way to, from a perspective of an observer, a conscious

48:25.680 --> 48:30.600
 observer that as a human being, you're essentially traveling forward in time by allowing yourself

48:30.600 --> 48:32.840
 to live long enough to see the thing.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.280
 So that's in the space of biology.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.200
 What about traveling back in time?

48:37.200 --> 48:44.560
 Yeah, that's the, that is a natural next question, especially if you're doing, if you're going

48:44.560 --> 48:49.360
 on one of these journeys, is it a one way journey or can you come back?

48:49.360 --> 48:55.280
 And the physics community doesn't speak with a unified voice on this as yet.

48:55.280 --> 49:00.000
 But I would say that the dominant perspective is that you cannot get back.

49:00.000 --> 49:07.280
 Now, having said that, there are proposals that serious people have written papers on

49:07.280 --> 49:11.080
 regarding hypothetical ways in which you could travel to the past.

49:11.080 --> 49:17.440
 And we've seen some of these, again, Hollywood loves to take the most sexy ideas of physics

49:17.440 --> 49:20.160
 and build narratives around them.

49:20.160 --> 49:25.640
 This idea of a wormhole, like Jodie Foster in contact went through a wormhole, a deep

49:25.640 --> 49:29.200
 space nine star, I'm sure there are many other examples where these ideas that I've probably

49:29.200 --> 49:30.720
 never even seen.

49:30.720 --> 49:37.160
 But with wormholes, there's at least a proposal of how you could take a wormhole tunnel through

49:37.160 --> 49:42.520
 space time, manipulate the openings of the wormhole in such a way that the openings are

49:42.520 --> 49:44.200
 no longer synchronous.

49:44.200 --> 49:49.080
 They are out of sync relative to each other, which would mean one's ahead and one's behind,

49:49.080 --> 49:51.720
 which means if you go through one direction, you travel to the future.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.520
 If you go back, you travel to the past.

49:54.520 --> 49:57.920
 Now, we don't know if there are wormholes in the world.

49:57.920 --> 49:59.920
 But they're possible according to Einstein, correct?

49:59.920 --> 50:01.880
 They are possible according to Einstein.

50:01.880 --> 50:07.480
 But even Einstein was very quick to say, just because my math allows for something, doesn't

50:07.480 --> 50:08.480
 mean it's real.

50:08.480 --> 50:11.040
 I mean, he famously didn't even believe in black holes.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.040
 Didn't believe in the Big Bang, right?

50:13.040 --> 50:17.200
 And yet the black hole issue has really been settled now.

50:17.200 --> 50:24.640
 We have radio telescopic photographs of the black hole in M87, it was in newspapers around

50:24.640 --> 50:27.280
 the world just a couple of years ago.

50:27.280 --> 50:32.240
 So it's just to say that just because it's in Einstein's math, it doesn't mean it's real.

50:32.240 --> 50:38.240
 But yes, it is the case that wormholes are allowed by Einstein's equations and in principle,

50:38.240 --> 50:42.600
 you can imagine putting electric charges on the openings of the wormhole, allowing you

50:42.600 --> 50:48.320
 to tow them around in a manner that could yield this temporal asymmetry between them.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.800
 Maybe you tow one of the mouths to the edge of a black hole.

50:51.800 --> 50:56.560
 In principle, you can do this, slowing down the passage of time near that black hole.

50:56.560 --> 51:02.200
 And then when you bring it back, it will be well out of sync with the other opening and

51:02.200 --> 51:07.240
 therefore it could be a significant temporal gap between one and the other.

51:07.240 --> 51:12.560
 But people who studied this in more detail question, could you ever keep a wormhole open

51:12.560 --> 51:14.840
 assuming it does exist?

51:14.840 --> 51:20.040
 Could you ever travel through a wormhole or would there be a requirement of some kind

51:20.040 --> 51:24.440
 of exotic matter to prop it open that perhaps doesn't exist?

51:24.440 --> 51:28.120
 So there are many, many issues that people have raised.

51:28.120 --> 51:34.640
 And I would say that the general sentiment is that it's unlikely that this kind of scenario

51:34.640 --> 51:39.240
 is going to survive our deeper understanding of physics when we finally have it.

51:39.240 --> 51:41.360
 But that doesn't mean that the door is closed.

51:41.360 --> 51:45.960
 So maybe there's a small possibility that this could one day be realized.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.600
 That's such an interesting way to put it.

51:48.600 --> 51:53.640
 This kind of scenario will not survive deeper understanding of physics.

51:53.640 --> 51:59.680
 It's an interesting way to put it because it makes you wonder what kind of scenarios

51:59.680 --> 52:04.400
 will be created by our deeper understanding of physics.

52:04.400 --> 52:08.480
 Maybe, sorry to go crazy for a second.

52:08.480 --> 52:14.440
 But if you have the panpsychism idea that consciousness permeates all matter, maybe

52:14.440 --> 52:19.680
 traveling in that, whatever laws of physics the consciousness operates under, something

52:19.680 --> 52:24.360
 like that, in that view of the universe, if we somehow are able to understand that part,

52:24.360 --> 52:28.560
 maybe traveling is super easy.

52:28.560 --> 52:32.160
 It does not follow the constraints of the speed of light.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.160
 Something like this.

52:33.160 --> 52:41.960
 So look, I have a definite degree of sympathy with the possibility that consciousness might

52:41.960 --> 52:48.200
 be more than what we described earlier as just the byproduct of mindless particles.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.480
 You just made the rock happy.

52:50.480 --> 52:51.980
 Exactly.

52:51.980 --> 52:59.720
 So it isn't the approach that feels to me the most likely, but I see the logic.

52:59.720 --> 53:05.680
 If you've got the puzzle, how to mindless particles build mind, one resolution might

53:05.680 --> 53:08.360
 be the particles are not mindless.

53:08.360 --> 53:11.040
 The particles have some kind of proto conscious quality.

53:11.040 --> 53:16.320
 So there's something appealing about that straightforward solution to the puzzle.

53:16.320 --> 53:21.420
 And if that's the case, if we do live in a panpsychist world where there's a degree

53:21.420 --> 53:25.600
 of consciousness residing in everything in the world around us, then yes, I do think

53:25.600 --> 53:32.480
 some interesting possibilities might emerge where maybe there's a way of communing with

53:32.480 --> 53:36.880
 physical reality in a deeper way than we have so far.

53:36.880 --> 53:43.280
 I mean, we as human beings, a vital part of our existence as human to human communication,

53:43.280 --> 53:45.320
 contact, we live in social groups.

53:45.320 --> 53:49.480
 And that's what it's allowed us to get to the place where we've gotten.

53:49.480 --> 53:55.400
 Imagine that we have long missed that there's other consciousness out there and some kind

53:55.400 --> 54:00.960
 of relationship or communion with that larger conscious possibility would take us to a different

54:00.960 --> 54:01.960
 place.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.840
 Now, do I, do I buy into this yet?

54:03.840 --> 54:04.840
 I don't.

54:04.840 --> 54:10.440
 I don't see any evidence for it, but do I have an open mind and allow for the possibility

54:10.440 --> 54:11.440
 in the future?

54:11.440 --> 54:13.600
 Yeah, I do.

54:13.600 --> 54:20.720
 So if that's not the case, and you have these simple particles that at the macro level emerges

54:20.720 --> 54:23.200
 some interesting stuff like consciousness.

54:23.200 --> 54:29.160
 Another thing you write about in the, until the end of time book is the thing that it

54:29.160 --> 54:35.200
 seems to emerge at the macro level is the feeling like there's a free will, like we

54:35.200 --> 54:36.600
 decide to do stuff.

54:36.600 --> 54:43.200
 And you have a really interesting take here, which is, no, there's not a free will.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.040
 I'm just going to speak for you and then you can correct me.

54:46.040 --> 54:51.440
 No, there's not a free will, but there is an experience of freedom.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.440
 Yeah.

54:52.440 --> 54:56.160
 Which I really love.

54:56.160 --> 55:01.760
 So where does the experience, where does freedom come from if we don't have any kind of physics

55:01.760 --> 55:02.760
 based free will?

55:02.760 --> 55:03.760
 Yeah.

55:03.760 --> 55:08.840
 And so the idea follows naturally from all that we've been talking about, let's make

55:08.840 --> 55:15.440
 the assumption that all there is in the physical universe is stuff governed by laws.

55:15.440 --> 55:20.520
 We may not have those laws, may not know what the fundamental stuff is yet, but everything

55:20.520 --> 55:26.680
 we know in science points in the direction that it's physical stuff governed by universal

55:26.680 --> 55:28.160
 laws.

55:28.160 --> 55:33.080
 And that being the case or that being the assumption, then you come to a particular

55:33.080 --> 55:36.160
 collection of those ingredients called the human being.

55:36.160 --> 55:41.920
 And that human being has particles that are fully governed by physical law.

55:41.920 --> 55:46.440
 And when you then recognize it, every thought that we have, every action that we undertake

55:46.440 --> 55:49.480
 is just the motion of particles.

55:49.480 --> 55:54.840
 And I'm thinking thoughts right now, of course, at this level of description, it is the motion

55:54.840 --> 55:59.960
 of particles cascading down various neurons inside of my head and so on.

55:59.960 --> 56:07.600
 And every single one of those motions collectively and individually is fully governed by these

56:07.600 --> 56:12.200
 laws that we perhaps don't have yet, but we imagine one day we will.

56:12.200 --> 56:17.880
 That leaves no opportunity for any kind of freedom to break free from the constraint

56:17.880 --> 56:19.720
 of physical law.

56:19.720 --> 56:21.760
 And that is the end of the story.

56:21.760 --> 56:25.960
 So the traditional intuitive notion of free will that we're the ultimate authors of our

56:25.960 --> 56:31.880
 actions, that we were the buckstops, that there is no antecedent, that is the cause

56:31.880 --> 56:39.120
 for our decided to go left or right, choose vanilla or chocolate, live or die, that intuitive

56:39.120 --> 56:43.880
 sensation does not have a basis in our understanding of the physical world.

56:43.880 --> 56:49.200
 So that's the end of the free will of the traditional sort, but then your question is,

56:49.200 --> 56:52.160
 what about this other kind of freedom I talk about?

56:52.160 --> 56:59.080
 And the other kind of freedom, if you focus on it intently, I think is actually the true

56:59.080 --> 57:02.280
 version of freedom that we feel.

57:02.280 --> 57:09.080
 And that freedom is this, you look at inanimate objects in the world, rocks, bottles of water,

57:09.080 --> 57:13.440
 whatever, they have a very limited behavioral repertoire.

57:13.440 --> 57:14.440
 Why?

57:14.440 --> 57:18.880
 Their internal organization is too coarse for them to do very much, right?

57:18.880 --> 57:24.080
 You have to, you try to have a conversation with a glass of water, you send sound waves,

57:24.080 --> 57:25.080
 it doesn't do much.

57:25.080 --> 57:30.240
 You may vibrate a little bit, but the repertoire of responses are incredibly limited.

57:30.240 --> 57:35.120
 The difference between us and Iraq or a bottle of water is that our inner organization by

57:35.120 --> 57:42.800
 virtue of eons of evolution by natural selection is so refined, so spectacularly ordered that

57:42.800 --> 57:50.520
 we have a huge repertoire of behaviors that are finally attuned to stimuli from the external

57:50.520 --> 57:51.520
 world.

57:51.520 --> 57:55.680
 You ask me a question, that's a stimulus, and all of a sudden these particle processes

57:55.680 --> 58:00.160
 go into action and this is the result, this answer that I'm giving you.

58:00.160 --> 58:05.640
 So the freedom that we have is not from the control of physical law.

58:05.640 --> 58:10.440
 The freedom that we have is from the constrained behavior that has long since governed inanimate

58:10.440 --> 58:11.440
 objects.

58:11.440 --> 58:17.280
 We are liberated from the limited behavioral repertoire of rocks and bottles of water to

58:17.280 --> 58:20.080
 have this broad spectrum of responses.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.080
 Do we pick them?

58:21.080 --> 58:22.080
 We do not.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.080
 Do we freely choose them?

58:23.080 --> 58:30.720
 We do not, but yet we have them and we can marvel at those behaviors and that's the freedom

58:30.720 --> 58:31.720
 that we have.

58:31.720 --> 58:36.800
 The complexity and the breadth of that repertoire is where the freedom emerges.

58:36.800 --> 58:40.280
 Is there something to be said about emergence?

58:40.280 --> 58:46.320
 I don't know if you know, I've looked at much about objects that I seem to love way

58:46.320 --> 58:51.840
 more than anyone else, which is cellular top, like game of life type of stuff.

58:51.840 --> 58:59.080
 From simple things emerges beautiful complexity, and so that's that repertoire.

58:59.080 --> 59:07.680
 It seems if you have enough stuff, just beautiful complexity emerges that sure as heck to our

59:07.680 --> 59:13.600
 human eyes looks like there's consciousness there, there's free will, there's little objects

59:13.600 --> 59:15.960
 moving about and making decisions.

59:15.960 --> 59:23.280
 All of that, you can say it's anthropomorphization, but it sure as heck feels like there are organisms

59:23.280 --> 59:26.080
 making decisions.

59:26.080 --> 59:27.960
 What is that emergence thing?

59:27.960 --> 59:31.280
 Is that within the realm of physics to understand?

59:31.280 --> 59:36.320
 Is it within the realm of poetry?

59:36.320 --> 59:37.320
 What is that?

59:37.320 --> 59:41.680
 Will that ever be understood by science?

59:41.680 --> 59:44.080
 So here's the way that I think about it.

59:44.080 --> 59:51.320
 So there are clearly qualities of the world that emerge on macroscopic scales, our sense

59:51.320 --> 59:56.040
 of beauty, wonder, consciousness, all these kinds of qualities.

59:56.040 --> 1:00:01.160
 Do I feel that they ultimately are explainable from the laws of physics?

1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:02.640
 I do.

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:08.840
 There is nothing that's not ultimately explainable with the laws of physics from this physicalist

1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:11.000
 perspective, which is what I take.

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:18.160
 So you got the particles, you got the laws, and you have things that emerge from the choreographed

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:20.920
 motions of those particles.

1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:26.520
 But is that the best language for talking about these emergent qualities?

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:27.640
 Usually not.

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:33.240
 If I was to take something even more mundane, like a baseball flying through the air, if

1:00:33.240 --> 1:00:38.120
 I was to describe it in terms of the quarks and the electrons, I'd give you this mountain

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:45.560
 of data with 10 to the 28 particles and all of their coordinates in space as a function

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:46.560
 of time.

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:49.320
 I hand you this mountain of data, and you're like, I don't know what this is.

1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:55.160
 And then if you really were clevering, looking, oh, it's a baseball just described in the least

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:57.160
 economical way possible.

1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:02.280
 It is much more useful and insightful to talk about the baseball flying through the air.

1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:08.240
 Similarly, there are things at the macroscopic level, like human experience and human emotion

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:15.200
 and human action and the sensation of free will that we undeniably all have, even if

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.640
 it itself doesn't have a basis in our understanding of the physical world.

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:24.520
 It's useful to talk about things in this very human language.

1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:29.580
 And so yes, it's vital to talk about things in the poetic language of human experience,

1:01:29.580 --> 1:01:31.080
 but do not lose sight of the fact.

1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:32.080
 And some people do.

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:34.120
 They say, oh, it's just an emergent phenomenon.

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:39.760
 Don't lose sight of the fact that emergent phenomena are emerging from this deeper understanding

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:42.960
 that comes from the reductionist account of physical law.

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.400
 And there's a lot of insight to come from that, such as the freedom that you thought

1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:50.480
 that you had, the freedom of will that you thought you had.

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:55.120
 It doesn't have a basis in that reductionist account, so it's not real.

1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:01.200
 So speaking of the poetry of human experience, you mentioned the images of the black holes.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.760
 How does it make you feel a few years ago when that first image came out?

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:12.720
 It's truly amazing, a sense of, well, I guess the feeling was both amazing and there was

1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:19.080
 a little sense of jealousy is not quite the right word, but a sense of longing.

1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:25.440
 Yeah, I think that's a better word because here's a subject that started with Einstein

1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:30.840
 back in 1915, writes down the equations of the general theory of relativity.

1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:36.720
 And then there are scores of individuals over the decades, starting with people like Carl

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:40.520
 Schwartzschild who analyze the equation and see the possibility of black holes.

1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:44.280
 People develop these ideas, John Wheeler, all these greats of physics.

1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:46.560
 It's still a hypothetical subject.

1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:51.360
 It gets closer to reality through observations of the center of our galaxy, stars whipping

1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:55.960
 around in a manner that could only really be explained by there being a black hole in

1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:01.760
 the center of our galaxy, but it was still indirect to actually have a direct image that

1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.680
 you can look at.

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:10.320
 What a beautiful arc, narrative arc from the theoretical to the absolutely established.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:13.680
 And that's what we hope will happen with other areas.

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:18.520
 For instance, string theory, right, I mean, wholly mathematical subject at the outset

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:25.880
 and still pretty much a wholly mathematical subject today, yeah, do we long for that image

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:32.280
 where we can look at it and say, string, it's real, maybe, you know, I mean, how thrilling,

1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:37.040
 how thrilling to be part of that journey, to be part of that step that moves things

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:39.400
 from the abstract to the concrete.

1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:46.120
 Yeah, so like the image of the DNA, the early images of the DNA, for example, but there

1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:47.640
 is something special.

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:54.360
 So the problem with strings is they're tiny, so it's harder to take a picture in the following

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:55.360
 sense.

1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:59.600
 When you think of a black hole, I mean, you have a swirl of, I guess, what is, I don't

1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:02.480
 even know, it's dust, whatever, light.

1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:04.720
 A creating onto the event horizon.

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:09.080
 And then there's darkness, yeah, center, and you just imagine, so that picture in

1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:16.360
 particular, I guess, is of a gigantic black hole, so you just, I mean, it's terrifying.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:17.760
 Billions of times the mass of the sun.

1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:19.840
 Yeah, so it's both exciting and terrifying.

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:22.000
 I mean, I don't know where you fall in the spectrum.

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.240
 I think it's exciting at first, like the longer I think about it, every time I think about

1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:29.360
 it, the more terrifying it becomes.

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:32.880
 So it always starts exciting, and then it goes to terrifying.

1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:38.480
 And both are feelings, very human feelings that I appreciate.

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:42.520
 It's like terrified awe, how it's still beautiful.

1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:43.920
 That's a good way of saying it.

1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:48.640
 And I think I kind of share that reaction, because there is a way in which when you work

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:54.280
 on this subject, like all the time, I teach it, I teach about black holes, write the equations

1:04:54.280 --> 1:05:05.720
 on the blackboard, the ideas reside in a very cognitive, I don't know, mathematical portion

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:08.400
 of the brain, or at least for me.

1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:13.160
 And it's only when you sit down, and it's quiet, and you start to contemplate, wait,

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:17.280
 wait, wait, this isn't just like a mathematical game.

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:19.520
 There are these monsters out there.

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:26.720
 Now I don't, not in a sense of I fear for my life, but it's a sense of how extraordinary

1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:28.480
 is this universe.

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.520
 And so it is breathtaking.

1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:32.040
 How powerful nature is.

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:37.400
 Yeah, how stupendously powerful nature is.

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:44.960
 And so there is a deep sense of humility that I think this instills if you really allow

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:48.400
 the ideas to sink in.

1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:53.760
 Well I have to ask about the most stupendously powerful thing to have ever happened in our

1:05:53.760 --> 1:05:56.680
 universe, which is the Big Bang.

1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:58.960
 What's up with the Big Bang?

1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:04.560
 So we can, I mean, with gravitational waves, the hope is, you have more and more accurate

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:07.840
 measurements of the gravitational waves, you can crawl back further and further back in

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:09.600
 time towards the Big Bang.

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:18.280
 Do you have a hope that we'll be able to understand the early spark that created our universe?

1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:19.280
 Yeah.

1:06:19.280 --> 1:06:25.320
 You know, that and the deep interior of a black hole are I think the biggest mysteries

1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:32.720
 that we hope the melding of quantum mechanics and gravity will reveal, will illuminate.

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:38.960
 And you know, what question could be more captivating than why is there something rather

1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:40.080
 than nothing, right?

1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:43.640
 Why is there a universe at all?

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:48.480
 And will the theories that we're developing take us to an answer to that?

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:49.960
 I don't know.

1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:53.640
 Even if we truly knew what the Big Bang is, and that's a big question of its own, right,

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:59.080
 one would still be left with the question, well, okay, so you've explained the process

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:07.280
 by which a tiny nugget of a universe, a kind of nugget of space time can undergo some kind

1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:10.240
 of growth to yield the world around us.

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:16.320
 But presumably in that explanation, you're going to involve mathematics and some ingredients

1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:22.040
 like quantum fields or matter or energy or something.

1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:24.240
 Where did that stuff come from?

1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:26.920
 You know, can we get to that level of explanation?

1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:34.280
 I don't know, but it is remarkable that if you ask what happened a millionth of a second

1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:40.480
 after the Big Bang, it's not really that controversial any longer, right?

1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:45.080
 Even though there's a lot of argument in the field, and it's very heated right now, I should

1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:50.040
 say, regarding what is the right theory of the Big Bang?

1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:54.960
 What is the right theory of early universe cosmology, where I mean early, much earlier

1:07:54.960 --> 1:08:01.800
 than a millionth of a second, a lot of dissent, a lot of heated arguments about that.

1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:02.800
 No pun intended.

1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:05.080
 Yeah, right, exactly.

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:10.200
 But you go like a millionth of a second after that, and we're a pretty firm ground.

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:12.240
 Isn't that amazing, right?

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:18.280
 To understand what happened from that point forward, but to go back is controversial.

1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:22.680
 So there is this theory called inflationary cosmology, which I would say has been the

1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:27.240
 dominant paradigm since early 1980s.

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:28.240
 So what does that mean?

1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:32.360
 Roughly 40 years now, it's been the dominant cosmological paradigm, and it makes use of

1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:37.360
 a curious feature of Einstein's general theory of relativity, his theory of gravity, where

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:41.880
 Einstein shows us mathematically that gravity can not only be attractive, you know, the

1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:47.720
 kind of gravity that we're used to, things pulled together, but it can also be repulsive.

1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:54.800
 And that fact is then leveraged by people like Alan Gooth and Andre Linday, and at

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.640
 the time Paul Steinhard and Andreas Halbrecht and others, to say, okay, if we had a little

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:04.680
 nugget in the earlier universe, which was filled with the stuff that yields this repulsive

1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:09.640
 gravity, well, that would have blown everything apart, it would cause everything to swell.

1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:13.160
 Beautiful explanation for what the bang in the big bang was.

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:18.960
 And then people mathematically analyze the consequences of this idea, and they make predictions

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:24.880
 for tiny temperature differences across the night sky that in principle could be measured.

1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:30.640
 You send up balloons, you send up satellites with very refined thermometers, and they measured

1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:35.360
 the temperature of the night sky, and the statistical distribution of the temperature

1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:39.880
 differences agrees with the mathematical predictions.

1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:43.040
 I mean, you just sort of have to stand in awe.

1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:44.640
 Of this insight.

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:48.600
 So you think, aha, the theory has been established.

1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:54.400
 But scientists are an incredibly skeptical bunch.

1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:57.840
 And some scientists, including one of the people who helped develop the theory at the

1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:03.040
 outset, Paul Steinhard, comes along and says, well, yeah, it's done, this theory's done

1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:08.280
 pretty well so far, but there are aspects of this theory that are making me lose confidence.

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:13.560
 For instance, this theory seems to suggest that there might be other universes.

1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:18.040
 Like how do you make sense of a theory that suggests other universes, or there are others

1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:24.880
 who come along and say this theory seems to talk about length scales that are minuscule

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:29.560
 even by the so called Planck length, the sort of shortest length that we can imagine making

1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:32.000
 sense of in a theory of quantum gravity.

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.560
 How do you make sense of that?

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:38.480
 And so on and so forth, they develop a list of things that they consider to be chinks

1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:42.760
 in the inflationary cosmological theories armor.

1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:48.120
 And they develop other ideas, which they claim yield the same predictions as inflationary

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:52.120
 cosmology for those temperature differences across space, but don't suffer from these

1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:53.120
 problems.

1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:58.680
 And then the inflationary cosmology folks say, no, no, no, hang on, your theory suffers from

1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:00.040
 different problems.

1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:02.760
 And so the arguments goes, it's a healthy debate.

1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:05.240
 Talk about real debates in science.

1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:10.080
 So when you ask what's up with the big bang, I don't know right now.

1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:14.960
 If you would have asked me five years ago, maybe even less than that three or four years

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:19.280
 ago, I've said, look, inflationary cosmology has some issues.

1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:23.680
 But the package of explanations it provides is so potent.

1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:30.320
 And the issues that beset it are seemingly solvable to me that I would imagine it's going

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.880
 to, in the end, win out.

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:35.880
 I would still say that today, but I wouldn't say it as loudly.

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:38.760
 I wouldn't say it as confidently.

1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:42.240
 I think it's worth thinking about alternate ideas.

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:47.120
 And it could be the case that the paradigm at some point shifts.

1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:52.600
 Does dark matter and dark energy fit into the shifting of the explanations for those?

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:53.600
 Yeah, certainly.

1:11:53.600 --> 1:12:00.400
 And so dark energy in the inflationary theory is kind of a big mystery.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:07.920
 So dark energy is the observational realization in the last 20 years that not only is the

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:11.880
 universe expanding, it's expanding ever more quickly.

1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:15.200
 Something is still pushing things outward.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:19.400
 And the explanation is that there's like a residual version of the repulsive gravity

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:20.680
 from the early universe.

1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:23.080
 But it's such a strange number.

1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:28.240
 When you write that amount of dark energy using the relevant units in a theory of quantum

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:34.760
 gravity, it's a decimal point followed by like 120 zeros and then a one.

1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:38.000
 We're not used to those kinds of numbers in physics.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:45.120
 We're used to a half, one, pi, E squared to two.

1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:50.080
 Those are the kinds of fundamental numbers that emerge in our explanations of the world.

1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.400
 And we look at this bizarre number, decimal point, all these zeros and one, we say, something's

1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:56.400
 wrong there.

1:12:56.400 --> 1:12:59.480
 Like where would that number have come from?

1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:01.800
 And now there are people who suggest resolution to it.

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.840
 So it's not like we're totally in the dark on it.

1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:10.520
 But those people like Paul Steinhard who have alternate cosmological theories, cyclic cosmologies,

1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.960
 as they call it, claim that they have a more natural explanation of the dark energy that

1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:22.840
 it naturally feeds into a cyclical process that is their cosmological paradigm.

1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:29.680
 So yeah, if the cosmology should change, it's conceivable our view of dark energy may change

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:34.320
 from deeply mysterious to deeply integrated into a different paradigm.

1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:35.320
 That is possible.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:40.040
 I think it's Roger Peneros that think that information can bleed through from before

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.440
 the Big Bang to after the Big Bang.

1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:48.040
 Is the Big Bang like a full erasure of the hard drive or is there some information that

1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:49.040
 could bleed through?

1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:50.040
 Yeah.

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:57.120
 I mean, so Roger is among the most creative thinkers of the last 100 years, rightly won

1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:05.320
 the Nobel Prize for his insights into singularities in space time that we know to afflict our

1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:11.400
 mathematical solutions of black holes in the Big Bang and so forth and he has an enormously

1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:17.200
 fertile imagination and I mean that in the most positive sense.

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:23.320
 So he has put forward this idea, this conformal cyclic cosmology, I think is the official

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:26.240
 title although I could be getting that wrong.

1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:27.880
 I can't say that I've studied it.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:30.200
 I have seen lectures on it.

1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:33.280
 I don't find it convincing as yet.

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:40.320
 It feels like it's being built to find a solution as opposed to sort of more naturally

1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:47.840
 emerging, maybe Roger would say otherwise and I don't mean to in any way cast aspersions

1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:48.840
 on the work.

1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.320
 It's vital and interesting and people are thinking about it.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:57.960
 I don't consider it as close a competitor to say the inflationary theory as for instance

1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:04.040
 the stuff that Paul Steinhardt has put forward but again, you've got to keep an open mind

1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:07.360
 in this business when there's so much that we don't yet understand.

1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:12.080
 I mean it is wild to think that information could survive something like that just like

1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:17.240
 it is wild to imagine that information could escape a black hole for example or it just

1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:23.880
 seems like by construction these things are supposed to not bleed out anything.

1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:27.920
 But one of the challenges in all these theories is when we talk about a singularity, has this

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:36.600
 real sexy term the singularity, but a singularity is in more ordinary language, a physical system

1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:43.120
 where the mathematics breaks down, it's nonsensical, it's like taking one divided by zero you put

1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:48.560
 that into a calculator and it says E error, it does not make sense, doesn't compute and

1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:56.400
 so it's very hard to make definitive statements about things like the Big Bang or about black

1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:02.480
 holes until we cure the mathematical singularities and there are some who claim that in certain

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:08.960
 regimes the singularities have been cured, I don't by any mean think that there's consensus

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.120
 on these ideas.

1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.160
 So when one talks about information sort of bleeding through the Big Bang, you've really

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:17.120
 got to make sure that the equations have no singularity.

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:20.760
 You talk about cyclic cosmology, you've got to make sure that the equations don't have

1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:24.240
 any singularities as you go from say one cycle to the next.

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.000
 Now some of the proponents of these theories claim that they have resolved these issues.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.560
 I don't think that there's a general sense that that is the case as yet, but it could

1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:38.100
 be that look I, life is so short that I haven't had the time to deeply delve into all the

1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:41.760
 mathematical intricacies of all the ideas that have moved forward, but did that I'd

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:43.320
 never do anything else.

1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:44.560
 But that's what the issue is.

1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:46.480
 And of course it's just math.

1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:54.640
 There may be holes, there may be gaps in our understanding in the way we're modeling physical

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:55.640
 reality.

1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:59.280
 And in fact, when you said I was about to jump in and say modeling, but you got there first

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:04.720
 and it's exactly the right point, we're talking about the universe here, right?

1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.560
 And how do you talk about the universe with a straight face mathematically?

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:14.600
 And the way you do it is you simplify, you throw away those characteristics of the universe

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:18.640
 that you don't think are vital to a full understanding.

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:22.840
 And so we're going to get to a point and people are starting to where we've got to go beyond

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:24.920
 those simplifications.

1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:32.000
 And so cosmology has for a long time modeled the universe in the most simplest terms, homogeneous,

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.480
 isotropic.

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:37.840
 It has just a few parameters that describe it, the average density of mass and energy

1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:38.840
 and so forth.

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:42.560
 We have to go beyond those simplifications and that will require putting these things

1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:43.560
 on computers.

1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:45.320
 We're not going to be able to do calculations there.

1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:51.080
 So much as astrophysics has gone beyond many simplifications to now give really detailed

1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:56.320
 simulations of star systems and galaxies and so forth, we're going to have to do that with

1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:58.560
 cosmology and people are starting to do that today.

1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:04.720
 Yeah, I've seen some interesting work on simulation, most simulation cosmology by the

1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:10.120
 way is just awesome, but just like simulation of the early formation of our solar system

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:16.720
 to understand how the like the or cloud and just, I don't know, the whole of it, how

1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:26.120
 earth came to be, how Jupiter just protects us and then there's like weird like moons

1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:34.440
 and volcanoes and like modeling all of that, the formation of all of that is fascinating

1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:41.280
 because that naturally leads the question of how does life emerge on these kinds of rocks?

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:44.960
 How does a rock become a rabbit?

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:50.880
 But speaking of models, there's an equation called the Drake equation, we were talking

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:58.160
 about life, have to ask when you're at the highest level first, when you look out there,

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:01.360
 how many alien civilizations do you think are out there?

1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:04.840
 Well, it was zero, one or many.

1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:15.160
 So if you say civilization, I would bring my number way down, it could be zero.

1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:20.640
 If you talk about life, I think it could be many.

1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:26.560
 As we were saying before, I think the move from life to consciousness, the kinds of beings

1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:32.800
 that would build what we would recognize as a civilization, that may be extraordinarily

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:34.200
 rare.

1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:36.480
 I hope it's not.

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:42.240
 As a kid, I love Star Trek, I just love the idea that we would be part of some universal

1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:48.080
 community where look, experience on planet earth suggests it doesn't always go so well

1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:53.960
 when groups who are separated try to come together and live in some larger collective,

1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:59.080
 but again as an optimist, how amazing would it be to converse with an alien civilization

1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:06.240
 and learn what they've figured out about physics and cosmology and compare notes and learn

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:09.800
 from each other in some wonderful way.

1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:16.640
 I love that idea, but if you ask me the likelihood of it, I would err on saying it may be so

1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:24.600
 improbable that the conditions conspire to allow life to move to this place of consciousness

1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:27.200
 and it might be rare.

1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:32.520
 It might be oversimplifying things, but just observing the power of the evolutionary process,

1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:43.320
 I tend to believe and you read different theories of how we went, how homo sapiens evolved.

1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:51.520
 It seems like the evolutionary process naturally leads to homo sapiens or creatures like that

1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:53.600
 or much better than that.

1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:59.640
 To me, there's several scary scenarios.

1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:06.040
 The positive scenario is life itself is really difficult, so that origin of life is difficult.

1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:12.680
 That's exciting for many reasons because we might be able to prove that wrong easily in

1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:16.080
 the near term by finding life elsewhere.

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:26.120
 The scary thing to me is if life is easy and there's plenty of conscious intelligent civilizations

1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:33.240
 out there and we have not obviously made contact, which means with intelligence and consciousness

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:40.720
 comes responsibility and ultimately destruction.

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:45.000
 With power comes great responsibility and then we end up destroying ourselves.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.160
 That's the scariest.

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:57.600
 The positive version is that maybe we're being watched, there's a transition to where you

1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:03.320
 don't want to ruin the primitive villages out there and so there's a protective layer

1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:07.840
 around us that they're watching.

1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:11.640
 Where do you, in these possible explanations to the Fermi paradox, why haven't we contacted

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:12.640
 aliens?

1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:14.640
 Do you land on?

1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:21.320
 I think the most straightforward explanation is that there aren't any.

1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:24.040
 There are many other explanations too.

1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:30.400
 You can't be dogmatic about things that are just sort of gut feel, but one of my favorite

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:36.720
 Twilight Zone episodes on it is one where this alien civilization finally comes to planet

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:43.120
 Earth and gives us this book that they really want us to have and to hold and it's in this

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:48.800
 foreign language, you don't understand, the cryptographers, they desperately try to decipher

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:53.000
 it as humans are going to visit this other alien planet and they're all sending back

1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.600
 postcards, how wonderful it is and so forth and they finally decipher the title, it's

1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:03.640
 to serve man and everyone's so thrilled that they're here to serve us, it all makes sense

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:09.800
 and then just as one of the final cryptographers is going on to the alien ship, his helper

1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:17.920
 runs and says, I've deciphered the rest of the book, to serve man, it's a cookbook.

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.720
 So yeah, it's out of possibility, sure.

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:27.240
 And so could they be watching us and just sort of waiting for us to get to a mature

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:32.680
 enough level, I don't know, it strikes me, well, I think it'd be better to have this

1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:38.560
 conversation after the James Webb telescope, I mean, I do think that if we look at the

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:44.000
 atmospheres of many planets, I mean, there's now an estimate now that there's on order

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:51.120
 of one planet per star on average, so we've long known that, you know, the galaxy hundreds

1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:54.920
 of billions of stars, numbers of galaxies, hundreds of billions of galaxies that we're

1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:59.120
 talking about, hundreds of billions of hundreds of billions of planets, oh my, you know, and

1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:03.840
 if we start to survey some of these planets and one after the other after the other, we

1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:11.520
 just sort of find no evidence for any of the biological markers, it could be, of course,

1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:15.560
 maybe life takes a radically different form, it'd be hard to know that.

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:19.400
 But I think, you know, that would at least give us some insight on the life question,

1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:25.000
 but I just don't see how we get insight on the civilization or consciousness question

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.800
 without, you know, the direct connection.

1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:34.200
 And it strikes me that if consciousness is ubiquitous, let's say life is, I'm willing

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:35.200
 to grant that.

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:41.560
 If consciousness is also ubiquitous, then I don't understand why they haven't been here

1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:47.440
 or why there hasn't been such a decision because presumably they should be much further ahead

1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:48.440
 of us.

1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:52.160
 How unlikely would it be that we're like, of all consciousness in the universe, we're

1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:53.160
 the most advanced.

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:58.880
 That would be such a special place for human beings that it's hard for me to grant that

1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:02.800
 as a likely possibility, rather, I think we're kind of running the mill.

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:06.120
 And there are many who are far more advanced than us.

1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:10.280
 And I don't think that they would expend the energy to hide themselves.

1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:13.160
 I don't think they care enough.

1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:19.080
 And so, you see, that's actually what I believe that there's a very large number of civilizations

1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:21.680
 that are far more advanced than us.

1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:27.720
 But my sense is that humans are exceptionally limited, both in our direct sensory capabilities

1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:33.640
 and our physics, our tools of sensing, that just like with the string theory and the multiple

1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:39.080
 dimensions, we're just not, like, it's like, I honestly believe there could be stuff in

1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:49.400
 front of our nose that we're just not seeing, because we're too dumb, too, too much hubris,

1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:56.400
 and a bunch of stuff, and too ignorant to the fabric of reality, all of those things.

1:25:56.400 --> 1:25:59.400
 We're young in terms of intelligence.

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:04.240
 But I guess what I'd say is, like, I'm on board with all of that as a real possibility,

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:12.520
 but then it does strike me that we are sufficiently able to observe the, look, we can look back

1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:20.560
 to a fraction of the duration from here to there, just a fraction is left that we are

1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:22.840
 unable to see.

1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:29.400
 So however young we are, we have been able to sort of pierce the universe, and it just

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:36.240
 strikes me that there would be some signature, but maybe that's coming, but look, having

1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:44.160
 said that I do, look, I certainly note the fact that it's rare that I stoop down while

1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:49.800
 walking in Manhattan and sort of dig up some ants in the bushes on the side of the street

1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:53.000
 and talk to the ants, right, because it's just not interesting to me.

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.280
 So if we're like the ants on the cosmological landscape, then yeah, I can imagine that the

1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:03.800
 super advanced aliens would be like, like, whoever, you know, but I feel like we're sufficiently

1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:08.280
 advanced that there should be some signal signature of that, but maybe it's coming.

1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:12.160
 I think the deeper fundamental problem between us and the ants is that we don't have a common

1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:13.160
 language.

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:14.720
 It's not, it's not the interest.

1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:17.400
 It's that we don't even have a common language.

1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:23.800
 And so the alien civilizations don't even know how to, like we humans have convinced

1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:27.280
 ourselves or especially because we developed the language and you talked about, you talk

1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:33.160
 about the importance of language to the intelligence, but it makes you wonder like how very niche

1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:39.600
 is that fan, like club that we've, like tribe we've created of language and linguistic type

1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:43.560
 of systems that are very specific to our particular kinds of brains and we share ideas

1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:44.560
 together.

1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:47.360
 We're all super excited that we can understand the universe because we came up with some

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:49.280
 notation and math.

1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:53.680
 I wonder if there's some totally other kinds of language that communicates on a different

1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:58.280
 time scale with different, very different mechanisms in the space of information that's

1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:01.720
 just, there's not everything.

1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:03.320
 Everything is lost in translation.

1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:04.320
 Yeah.

1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:05.320
 And it could well be as a look.

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:13.200
 I mean, I think part of the reason I go toward the possibility of the soul intelligence is

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:20.120
 there's a certain kind of romantic appeal to looking out in the cosmos and it's just

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:22.560
 quiet and it's just eternal silence.

1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:28.040
 There's some, there's something that appeals to me at an emotional level that way.

1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:32.080
 But yeah, I mean, nobody, nobody knows.

1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:39.560
 And it's certainly conceivable that there's just a radical mismatch between the kinds

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:46.440
 of things that we are able to observe insensitive to versus the kinds of structures that permeate

1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:50.520
 the universe in a manner that simply we're unable to detect.

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:59.160
 So if we are alone, that is exciting and one of the ways it's exciting is that it's up

1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:07.880
 to us to become, to expand out into the universe, to permeate consciousness out into the universe.

1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:10.040
 So that's where space exploration comes in.

1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:15.620
 Let me ask you, as somebody who's a screen theorist, a physicist, do you think space

1:29:15.620 --> 1:29:21.480
 exploration, colonizing space, is a physics or an engineering problem?

1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:22.480
 What would you say?

1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:30.720
 Yeah, I think it's fundamentally an engineering problem if we're not trying to do things like

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:36.720
 build wormholes the way they did, say an interstellar to get to a different place or trying to travel

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:41.080
 near the speed of light so that we would actually be able to traverse interstellar distances.

1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:49.200
 I mean, without that, our colonization will happen at a very, very slow rate, right?

1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:53.800
 But one of the beauties of relativity is if you do travel near the speed of light, you

1:29:53.800 --> 1:29:56.880
 can actually go arbitrarily far in a human lifetime.

1:29:56.880 --> 1:29:58.160
 People say, how's that possible?

1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:00.160
 You can't go billions of light years.

1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:04.320
 Well, you can actually because as you can do the speed of light, the way in which space

1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:09.080
 and time change allows you to go, in principle, arbitrarily far.

1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:10.080
 That's very exciting.

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:15.200
 But if we put that physics side of the issue in the manipulation space and time to the

1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:18.480
 side, yeah, I think it's a deep engineering problem.

1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:22.840
 How do you terraform other planets?

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:30.520
 How do you go beyond our local neighborhood, say, without using the ideas of relativity?

1:30:30.520 --> 1:30:35.660
 So I think it's all quite exciting, and I think the idea is using solar sales that people

1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:42.760
 have developed and trying to take that first step to Mars, I think that's a vital and valuable

1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:43.760
 step to take.

1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:46.440
 But yeah, I think these are fundamentally engineering challenges.

1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:53.440
 Or extending the human lifespan through biology research or maybe reducing what it means to

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:58.720
 be a human being into information and uploading certain parts of it, maybe not all the full

1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:04.160
 resolution of a human life, but maybe the essential things like the DNA and be able

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:08.120
 to reconstruct that human being.

1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:11.680
 But I have to ask about Mars.

1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:20.360
 Do you find the dream of human stepping on Mars, stepping foot first, but also colonizing

1:31:20.360 --> 1:31:24.960
 Mars, one that's worth us fighting for?

1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:25.960
 Yeah, hugely so.

1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:34.080
 I mean, I think what we have long been, not always in the best way, is a species of explorers

1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:40.120
 in the literal sense of traveling from one part of the world to another, or in the more

1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:45.600
 metaphorical sense of trying to travel through our minds to the quantum realm or back to

1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:47.800
 the big banger to the center of black holes.

1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:51.560
 So I think that's fundamentally part of the human spirit.

1:31:51.560 --> 1:32:01.160
 So I do think that's a vital part of our heritage brought forward into its next incarnation.

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.840
 That's who we are.

1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:11.600
 Do you think there'll be a day in the future where a human being is born on Mars and has

1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:17.680
 to learn about his or her human origins on Earth?

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:19.560
 Like they'll have to read in the book?

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.840
 Yeah, I don't think it'll be a book at that stage.

1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:26.840
 It'll probably just be uploaded into the head or something, or imprinted into the DNA and

1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:28.560
 then they just sort of sense it.

1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:33.720
 But yeah, I think there's, well, look, the issue you raised before is the vital one

1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:34.720
 thing.

1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:39.080
 Is it the case that any sufficiently advanced civilization destroys itself?

1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:41.240
 Is that sort of a commonplace quality?

1:32:41.240 --> 1:32:44.920
 I mean, that's the other potential answer to the Fermi paradox.

1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:46.040
 Why aren't they here?

1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:49.640
 Because by the time they got to the technological development where they could travel here,

1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:50.840
 they blew themselves up.

1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:52.120
 They destroyed themselves.

1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:59.640
 And that's an unfortunate but not a hard to imagine possibility based on things that

1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:04.520
 have happened here on planet Earth, but putting that to the side.

1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:09.960
 I think that's the big obstacle, but putting that to the side, we will resolve the engineering

1:33:09.960 --> 1:33:10.960
 challenges.

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:14.800
 And I should probably modify my answer from before.

1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:18.880
 When you said is it engineering or physics, it's really both, right?

1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:23.640
 So we will surmount the engineering challenges, and that will then make the physics challenges

1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:24.640
 relevant.

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:28.000
 It'll make it relevant to figure out how to travel near this beat of light.

1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:34.160
 It'll make it relevant to learn how to manipulate the shape of space time and so forth.

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:39.520
 So I think it's a multi stage process where it is engineering and ultimately physics.

1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:43.080
 And if we stick around long enough, those are the kinds of challenges I think that we're

1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:44.840
 ultimately going to surmount.

1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:48.640
 And then the physics side is figuring out how to harness energy enough to travel outside

1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:53.360
 the solar system, which seems like a heck of a difficult journey, but even Mars itself

1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:03.280
 of, I don't know, maybe because I was born in the Soviet Union and was born with the,

1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:07.800
 you know, looking up at the stars and that dream of like the highest of human achievement

1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:12.000
 is ability to fly out there to, you know, to join the stars.

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:17.480
 I really liked the idea of going to Mars and not just stepping foot on Mars.

1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:27.000
 It wasn't until maybe I'm misinformed, but for me personally, it wasn't until Elon Musk

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:33.920
 started talking about the colonization of Mars, did I realize like we humans can actually

1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:34.920
 do that?

1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:41.600
 And the first of all, the importance of somebody saying that we can do these seemingly impossible

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:49.960
 things is immeasurable because, you know, the fact that he placed that into my mind

1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:53.920
 and into the minds of millions of others, maybe hundreds of millions, maybe billions

1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:58.640
 of others, young kids today, I mean, that that's going to make it a reality.

1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:06.240
 I for some reason am deeply excited, even though my work in AI that echoes all of this,

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:12.560
 I'm excited by the idea that somebody would be born as what we're saying on Mars and sort

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:19.320
 of look up and be able to see with a telescope Earth and say, that's where I came from.

1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:25.800
 I don't know that that idea scale to other planets, to other solar systems, yeah, that's

1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:26.800
 really exciting.

1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:27.800
 It's hugely exciting.

1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:29.280
 I think I'm absolutely right.

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:33.800
 I mean, the vital thing is to dream, right?

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:42.720
 I mean, and it sounds hackneyed, but it is so important for young kids for the next generation

1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:45.440
 to think about the things that are seemingly impossible.

1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:47.280
 I mean, that's what makes them possible.

1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:50.280
 And this is one which is concrete enough.

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:55.000
 I mean, this is something that's going to happen soon in terms of actually going to Mars.

1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:02.120
 And then the next step of establishing some presence, some semi permanent or permanent

1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:03.120
 presence.

1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:06.400
 I mean, this is not something that's going to wait till the 25th century.

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:09.320
 I mean, this is something that's going to happen relatively soon.

1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:13.560
 So I mean, it could well be in your lifetime, unlikely mine, but possibly in your lifetime

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:18.360
 that that kid will be born and have the experience that you described.

1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:21.760
 So yeah, it's spectacularly exciting.

1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:26.000
 And I actually, I would love to go on Mars and one of the early.

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000
 You would?

1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.000
 Yeah.

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000
 It would have been one way.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000
 I'm happy to do one.

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000
 Really?

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:32.000
 Wow.

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.240
 There are so many stories out there that want to start that family.

1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:36.240
 Let's go out to Mars.

1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:37.240
 No, I think...

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:38.520
 See, I have to tell you something.

1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:42.760
 You talk about terror, thinking about like black holes.

1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:49.920
 If I actually think about going to Mars and being on Mars and put myself in there fully,

1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:51.800
 that's terror inducing.

1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:58.480
 The idea of to be in this foreign world where you can't come back, where you've made this

1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:01.800
 choice that can't be reversed, you know, at some point it may be.

1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:08.560
 But in that guys, that to me carries a deep sense of terror.

1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:12.800
 You know, I feel that sense of terror every time Kerak, Jack Kerak talked about this on

1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:20.760
 the road is, you know, when you leave a place, if you're honest about it, like life is short.

1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:24.520
 And when you leave a place, you move to a new place and you think of all the friends,

1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:29.560
 maybe family, you're leaving behind as you drive over the hill.

1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:30.560
 That really is goodbye.

1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:34.560
 Like we sometimes don't think of it that way when we're moving.

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:39.000
 But that really is goodbye to that life, to the person you were, to the all the people.

1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:43.120
 Maybe if it's close friends, you'll see that maybe 10, 15 more times in your life and that's

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:44.120
 it.

1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:46.240
 And you're saying goodbye to all of that.

1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:52.040
 And so in the same way, I see it as way more dramatic when you're flying away from Earth

1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:58.440
 and it's like, it's goodbye to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks and it's goodbye to whatever

1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:04.080
 I don't know why I picked those, but some, all the things that are special to Earth,

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:05.080
 it's goodbye.

1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:06.880
 But that's life.

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:13.840
 I suppose more what excites me about that kind of journey is it's a distinct contemplation

1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:16.760
 of your mortality, acceptance of your mortality.

1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:23.240
 You're saying just like when you take on any difficult journey, it's accepting that you're

1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:28.680
 going to die one day and might as well do something truly exciting.

1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:29.680
 Yes.

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:31.560
 I mean, I will, you know, I'm with you on that.

1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:39.480
 I'm a strong believer that deep underneath human motivation is this, this terror of our

1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:40.480
 own mortality.

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:41.480
 Yeah.

1:38:41.480 --> 1:38:45.920
 There's this wonderful book that had a great influence on me called The Denial of Death

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:55.360
 by Ernest Becker and when you are aware of the ways in which our mortality influences

1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:01.920
 our behaviors, it really does add a different slant, a different kind of color to the interpretation

1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:03.200
 of human behavior.

1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:04.200
 Yeah.

1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:05.720
 It's funny.

1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:08.440
 That book had a big influence on me as well.

1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:10.640
 Oh, is that right?

1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:16.200
 And a terror management theory and I, again, from an engineering perspective, I don't know

1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:22.120
 how many people that book influenced because I talk to people about the fear of death and

1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:26.840
 it doesn't seem to be that fundamental to their experience.

1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:30.720
 And I don't think on the surface it's fundamental to my experience, but it seems like an awfully,

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:35.840
 in terms of talking about models and string theory and theories, in terms of theories

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:41.280
 of this macro experience of human life, it seems like a heck of a good theory that the

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:44.840
 fear of death is the kind of, is the warm at the core.

1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:45.840
 Yeah.

1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:50.600
 Well, I mean, and the terror management theories that you make reference to, I mean, the, this

1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:57.600
 is a group of psychologists, social psychologists who devise these very clever experiments,

1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:04.040
 real world experiments with real people, where you can directly measure the hidden influence

1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:07.120
 of the recognition of our own mortality.

1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:11.400
 I mean, they've done these experiments where they have group of people, a group of people,

1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:15.440
 B, and the only difference between the two groups is that group B, they somehow reminded

1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:18.440
 them in some subtle way of their own mortality.

1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.800
 Sometimes it's nothing more than interviewing them with a funeral home across the street,

1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:25.920
 you know, an influence that's there, but it's, but it's subtle.

1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:32.200
 You don't even think you take note of, and they can find measurable effects that differentiate

1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:38.160
 the two groups to a high degree of statistical significance and how they respond to certain

1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:44.920
 challenges or certain kinds of questions that shows a direct influence of the reminder of

1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:46.080
 their own mortality.

1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:51.800
 And I've read a number of these studies and they are really convincing.

1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:57.480
 And so, yeah, I would say that the reason why so many people would say that, yeah, fear

1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:00.400
 of mortality, it's not front and center in my worldview.

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:03.360
 Yeah, I don't really think about it much, doesn't really matter too much.

1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:08.480
 The reason why they're able to say that is because this thing called culture has emerged

1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:10.880
 over the course of the last 10,000 years.

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:16.440
 And part of the role of culture is to give us a means of not thinking about our mortality

1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:21.880
 all the time, of not living in terror of the inevitable end, which faces us all.

1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:26.360
 So it's completely understandable that that's the response because that's what culture

1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:27.920
 is at least in part four.

1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:35.200
 It's at least possible that the fear of death, the terror of your mortality is the creative

1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:41.840
 force that created all of the things around us at this human civilization.

1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:49.400
 And I think about from an engineering perspective, this is where I lose all of my robotics colleagues,

1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:57.600
 is I feel like if you want to create intelligence, you have to also engineer in some kind of

1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:04.600
 echoes of this kind of fear of, you know, fear is such a complicated word, but it's

1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:11.440
 kind of like a scarcity, a scarcity of time, a scarcity of resources that creates a kind

1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:15.720
 of anxiety, like deadlines get you to do stuff.

1:42:15.720 --> 1:42:20.840
 And there's something almost fundamental to that in terms of human experience.

1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:22.760
 Yeah, well, that's an interesting thought.

1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:34.440
 So you're basically in order to create a kind of structure that mirrors what we call consciousness.

1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:42.600
 You better have that structure confront the same kinds of issues and terrors that we do.

1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:45.720
 Consciousness and suffering only make sense in the context of death.

1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:52.240
 If you want to, I feel like, if you want to fit into human society, if you're a robot

1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:59.200
 and you want to fit into human society, you better have the same kind of existential dread,

1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:06.280
 the same kind of fear of mortality, otherwise you're not going to fit in.

1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:12.520
 It might be wild, but it's at least like we're talking about all the theories that are at

1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:13.720
 least worth consideration.

1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:21.720
 I think that's a really powerful one and definitely one has resonated with me and definitely

1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:31.480
 seems to capture something beautifully real about the human condition.

1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:40.520
 And I wonder, of course, it sucks to think that we need death to appreciate life.

1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:43.120
 But that just may be the way it is.

1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:48.720
 Well, it's interesting if this robotic or artificially intelligent system understands

1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:54.280
 the world and understands the second law of thermodynamics and entropy, even an artificial

1:43:54.280 --> 1:44:00.360
 intelligence will realize that even if its parts are really robust, ultimately it will

1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:01.360
 disintegrate.

1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:06.640
 I mean, so the time scales may be different, but in a way when you think about it, it doesn't

1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:07.640
 matter.

1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:12.320
 Once you know that you are mortal in the sense that you are not eternal, the time scale hardly

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:19.920
 matters because it's either the whole thing or not because on the scales of eternity,

1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:25.720
 any finite duration, however large is effectively zero on the scales of eternity.

1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:32.920
 And so maybe it won't be so hard for an artificial system to feel that sense of mortality because

1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:38.800
 it will recognize the underlying physical laws and recognize its own finitude.

1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:48.800
 And then it'll be us and robots drinking beers, looking up at the stars and just having a

1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:53.080
 good laugh in awe of the whole thing.

1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:57.360
 I think that's a pretty good way to end it, talking about the fear of death.

1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:01.160
 We started talking about the meaning of life and ended on the fear of death.

1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:02.160
 Brian, this was an incredible conversation.

1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:03.160
 My pleasure.

1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:04.160
 Thank you.

1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:05.160
 I enjoyed it.

1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:06.160
 I really, really enjoyed it.

1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:09.880
 Thanks for the time coming, I'm a huge fan of your work, a huge fan of your writing.

1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:10.880
 Thanks for talking to me, Brian.

1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:11.880
 Thank you.

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:14.840
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Green.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson.

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:28.040
 Physics is really nothing more than a search for ultimate simplicity.

1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:33.320
 But so far, all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.

1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:35.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
