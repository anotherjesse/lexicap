00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
 I hate affirmative action.

00:02.320 --> 00:03.480
 I don't just disagree with it.

00:03.480 --> 00:06.360
 I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.920
 I hate it.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.880
 The hatred comes from an understanding

00:09.880 --> 00:12.400
 that it is a mandate, that it is a substitute

00:12.400 --> 00:14.760
 for the actual development of our capacities,

00:14.760 --> 00:16.520
 of our people to compete.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.000
 They want to tell African Americans

00:18.000 --> 00:19.400
 to pat us on the head.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.200
 We're going to have a separate program for you.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.480
 We're going to give you a side door

00:23.480 --> 00:25.000
 that you can come into.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.280
 That doesn't make us any smarter.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.240
 It doesn't make us any more creative,

00:30.240 --> 00:34.040
 and it doesn't make us any more fit

00:34.040 --> 00:37.320
 for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.120
 The following is a conversation with Glenn Lowry,

00:42.120 --> 00:44.200
 professor of economics and social sciences

00:44.200 --> 00:45.480
 at Brown University.

00:45.480 --> 00:49.560
 He is one of the great minds and communicators of our time,

00:49.560 --> 00:53.480
 writing and speaking about race and inequality.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.880
 I highly encourage you to listen to his show on YouTube

00:56.880 --> 01:00.120
 and Substack, simply called The Glenn Show.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:04.960 --> 01:06.080
 in the description.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.400
 And now, dear friends, here's Glenn Lowry.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.960
 Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech,

01:12.960 --> 01:15.480
 I think is the greatest speech in American history.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.800
 If I may, I'd like to read a few words of it.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.640
 Sure.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.160
 And ask you a question about this dream.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.280
 I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up

01:26.280 --> 01:29.000
 and live out the true meaning of its creed.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.640
 We hold these truths to be self evident

01:31.640 --> 01:33.480
 that all men are created equal.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.920
 I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,

01:38.920 --> 01:40.720
 the sons of former slaves

01:40.720 --> 01:43.040
 and the sons of former slave owners

01:43.040 --> 01:44.600
 will be able to sit down together

01:44.600 --> 01:45.960
 at the table of brotherhood.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.840
 I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi,

01:50.840 --> 01:54.160
 a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.600
 sweltering with the heat of oppression

01:56.600 --> 02:00.840
 will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.320
 I have a dream that my four little children

02:04.320 --> 02:06.520
 will one day live in a nation

02:06.520 --> 02:09.800
 where they will not be judged by the color of their skin,

02:09.800 --> 02:12.560
 but by the content of their character.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.720
 I have a dream today.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.360
 First of all, damn.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.560
 I mentioned to you offline, I immigrated to America

02:19.560 --> 02:20.920
 and this is why I love this country.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.280
 This is one of the great speeches

02:22.280 --> 02:25.040
 that represents what this country is about.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.160
 So what is this ideal of equality

02:29.160 --> 02:31.320
 that we should strive for as a nation?

02:31.320 --> 02:33.440
 That all men are created equal.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.720
 What does that mean to you, this equality?

02:37.400 --> 02:41.800
 Well, if we put this in historical context,

02:43.080 --> 02:47.280
 King is speaking in 1963 when he gives that speech.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.280
 It's exactly 100 years after Abraham Lincoln

02:52.480 --> 02:55.600
 signs the Emancipation Proclamation

02:55.600 --> 03:00.600
 declaring the enslaved people to be free.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.960
 They're not yet citizens in 1863,

03:07.040 --> 03:09.680
 but the end of slavery has become

03:09.680 --> 03:11.640
 the position of the federal government

03:11.640 --> 03:17.520
 when Lincoln issues that Emancipation Proclamation.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.920
 So putting it in context,

03:20.920 --> 03:24.120
 enslaved people, four million or so,

03:24.120 --> 03:27.280
 African descended enslaved people.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.160
 How do they become citizens?

03:31.160 --> 03:36.160
 How do they become in this status of subjugation

03:36.160 --> 03:40.920
 and domination and stigma and exclusion?

03:40.920 --> 03:42.880
 How do they become citizens?

03:42.880 --> 03:47.880
 It seems to me that that's the heart of it.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.880
 The equality that King is talking about

03:51.880 --> 03:56.880
 is an equality of status as members of the nation

03:57.840 --> 04:02.840
 as free and equal citizens within the republic.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.840
 Now, I think it's really important to understand

04:05.840 --> 04:10.840
 that slavery was not merely a legal order,

04:12.200 --> 04:16.680
 but it was also a social system

04:16.680 --> 04:21.200
 that had the symbolism attached to it.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.240
 They had a big journey to make

04:24.240 --> 04:27.920
 from their subjugated status as serfs,

04:27.920 --> 04:30.520
 as landless people, as uneducated,

04:30.520 --> 04:34.400
 unfit for citizenship really in the minds of many.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.400
 So I think that's what in 1963, 100 years later,

04:40.640 --> 04:43.760
 that King is appealing to this idea

04:43.760 --> 04:47.000
 that when Thomas Jefferson

04:47.000 --> 04:50.800
 in the Declaration of Independence writes these words,

04:50.800 --> 04:54.800
 all men are created equal and endowed by their creator

04:54.800 --> 04:57.720
 with certain inalienable rights.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.720
 He didn't, Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner didn't have in mind

05:03.040 --> 05:06.480
 when he wrote those words, the people who were slaves.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.880
 But by the time you get to 1963,

05:10.880 --> 05:15.880
 King is invoking this idea, all men,

05:16.640 --> 05:18.200
 and of course he means all persons,

05:18.200 --> 05:20.520
 he doesn't only mean men,

05:20.520 --> 05:23.160
 he means men and women are created equal.

05:23.160 --> 05:27.160
 He wants this idea to be embraced by the country

05:27.160 --> 05:31.160
 in reference to the descendants of the African slaves.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.400
 That's his dream, that's his idea.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.400
 The legacy of slavery would be erased

05:37.400 --> 05:41.400
 that the position of African Americans

05:41.400 --> 05:45.400
 would be equalized within the political community,

05:45.400 --> 05:48.160
 which is the United States of America.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.160
 That's my sense of it in any way.

05:50.160 --> 05:55.160
 So on a very basic level, the worth of a human being

05:55.160 --> 05:59.160
 is equal, it's just literally the worth of a human being.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.160
 So I mentioned to you offline

06:00.160 --> 06:03.160
 that I came from the Soviet Union,

06:03.160 --> 06:07.160
 my grandfather fought in World War II,

06:07.160 --> 06:12.160
 and for Hitler, the worth of a Slavic person

06:14.160 --> 06:17.160
 as they were captured, there's different ways

06:17.160 --> 06:21.160
 as they were captured, there's different numbers,

06:21.160 --> 06:24.160
 but it's in the hundreds to one German,

06:24.160 --> 06:29.160
 in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
 So he wanted Germany to expand

06:32.160 --> 06:34.160
 and conquer a large part of the world,

06:34.160 --> 06:37.160
 and within that future world, that Third Reich,

06:37.160 --> 06:42.160
 the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person

06:42.160 --> 06:46.160
 is 100 or 1000s of a German person,

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
 a pure German person.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.160
 So that has to do with not some kind of public policy

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
 or politics or all that kind of stuff,

06:53.160 --> 06:56.160
 it has to do with the basic worth of a human being.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.160
 And that's what Dr. King is speaking to,

06:58.160 --> 07:03.160
 that all people on some kind of deep level

07:03.160 --> 07:06.160
 are worth the same.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.160
 If you're somehow weighing the value of a person,

07:10.160 --> 07:14.160
 we're equal in that basic fundamental worth.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.160
 Yeah, I think that's correct.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.160
 I think that's very well said.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.160
 I don't know that he had in mind the position

07:20.160 --> 07:23.160
 of Slavic people in Central Europe

07:23.160 --> 07:25.160
 in the middle of the 20th century

07:25.160 --> 07:27.160
 or the first part of the 20th century, King.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.160
 I don't know that he had that in mind.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.160
 He might well have done,

07:31.160 --> 07:33.160
 but certainly that's the idea.

07:33.160 --> 07:37.160
 So you don't think he was really thinking about

07:37.160 --> 07:40.160
 this particular civil rights struggle

07:40.160 --> 07:44.160
 in the particular struggle

07:44.160 --> 07:48.160
 against the backdrop of the history of slavery in America

07:48.160 --> 07:50.160
 and thinking about African Americans.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.160
 He wasn't thinking about the basic,

07:52.160 --> 07:55.160
 he wasn't speaking to the basic worth of all human beings.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.160
 No, I don't mean to say that.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.160
 The speech in Washington.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.160
 The dream.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.160
 In 1963 at that march

08:05.160 --> 08:08.160
 was within the context of the United States

08:08.160 --> 08:12.160
 and it was within the context of the civil rights movement.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.160
 There was a movement that was going on.

08:15.160 --> 08:21.160
 He was an actor in a political drama that was American

08:21.160 --> 08:26.160
 that had to do with the fight over equal rights

08:26.160 --> 08:30.160
 for voting, for housing, for employment,

08:30.160 --> 08:34.160
 for citizenship of blacks in America.

08:34.160 --> 08:38.160
 But King was informed, I think,

08:38.160 --> 08:41.160
 by a much broader Christian ethic

08:41.160 --> 08:44.160
 of the equality of all persons.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.160
 I mean, he gets killed in 1968.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.160
 The five years after that speech in Washington,

08:51.160 --> 08:57.160
 he spends developing his worldview

08:57.160 --> 09:00.160
 and the things that he had to say,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.160
 for example, about the war in Southeast Asia

09:03.160 --> 09:05.160
 that was going on at that time,

09:05.160 --> 09:11.160
 made appeals to universal principles of equality.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.160
 He was a pacifist to some degree.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.160
 He was against war.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.160
 He was a socialist to some degree.

09:18.160 --> 09:21.160
 He might not have worn that label publicly,

09:21.160 --> 09:24.160
 but he believed in a decent society

09:24.160 --> 09:27.160
 where the poor would not go untended,

09:27.160 --> 09:29.160
 where healthcare would be available

09:29.160 --> 09:32.160
 to people who needed it and this kind of thing.

09:32.160 --> 09:37.160
 A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life

09:37.160 --> 09:40.160
 was not dependent upon the color of the skin,

09:40.160 --> 09:44.160
 upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken,

09:44.160 --> 09:48.160
 upon whether male or female.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.160
 All persons are created equal.

09:50.160 --> 09:55.160
 This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King

09:55.160 --> 09:57.160
 on my understanding.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.160
 Broadly speaking,

09:59.160 --> 10:02.160
 what do you learn about human nature

10:02.160 --> 10:07.160
 by looking at the history of slavery in America?

10:07.160 --> 10:10.160
 So what does that tell you about people?

10:10.160 --> 10:15.160
 Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head.

10:15.160 --> 10:22.160
 One is about the capacity of people

10:22.160 --> 10:31.160
 for looking the other way in the face of unethical

10:31.160 --> 10:38.160
 and morally profoundly problematic practice.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.160
 So I mean, slavery was controversial.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.160
 It was controversial going all the way back

10:43.160 --> 10:45.160
 to the founding of the United States of America.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.160
 The country was founded on a compromise

10:48.160 --> 10:51.160
 where half of the country

10:51.160 --> 10:54.160
 thought that slavery was abhorrent

10:54.160 --> 10:59.160
 and would not have had a countenance in the Constitution.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.160
 The other half of the country were steeped

11:02.160 --> 11:06.160
 in the dependence on the labor of these African captives

11:06.160 --> 11:08.160
 and their descendants.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.160
 The economy depended upon it.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.160
 They owned them as property.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.160
 That was their wealth.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.160
 Their wealth was invested to some degree

11:14.160 --> 11:17.160
 in the value of these human beings.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.160
 And in order for the United States to come together

11:20.160 --> 11:24.160
 as a confederation of the several colonies,

11:24.160 --> 11:26.160
 there had to be a compromise made.

11:26.160 --> 11:31.160
 And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist.

11:31.160 --> 11:35.160
 And the people who were against it

11:35.160 --> 11:38.160
 or who thought it morally problematic

11:38.160 --> 11:42.160
 were able to countenance the practice

11:42.160 --> 11:45.160
 in the southern states where slavery flourished.

11:45.160 --> 11:49.160
 And that went on for 75 years after the founding of the country

11:49.160 --> 11:53.160
 until the crisis of the late 1850s

11:53.160 --> 11:55.160
 that led to the Civil War

11:55.160 --> 11:57.160
 and ultimately to the Emancipation.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.160
 So one thing I think about human nature

12:00.160 --> 12:05.160
 from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people

12:05.160 --> 12:11.160
 to live with terrible, morally questionable practices

12:11.160 --> 12:14.160
 and have that as a part of their institutions,

12:14.160 --> 12:18.160
 it took a movement, a massive movement

12:18.160 --> 12:22.160
 of abolitionists struggling against slavery

12:22.160 --> 12:25.160
 for the better part of a century

12:25.160 --> 12:30.160
 before that practice could be eradicated.

12:30.160 --> 12:34.160
 But the other thing about human nature that I see

12:34.160 --> 12:39.160
 is the ability of people to sustain their humanity

12:39.160 --> 12:44.160
 under the most awful, oppressive conditions.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.160
 The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children,

12:49.160 --> 12:51.160
 I mean, they were chattel.

12:51.160 --> 12:55.160
 They were button sold like horses or cattle.

12:55.160 --> 13:01.160
 And yet their humanity was not destroyed by that.

13:01.160 --> 13:08.160
 And they were able to sustain their dignity to some degree

13:08.160 --> 13:12.160
 in such a manner that once emancipation finally did arrive,

13:12.160 --> 13:17.160
 the freedmen and women, the persons who had been enslaved

13:17.160 --> 13:22.160
 and who were set free, were able to,

13:22.160 --> 13:27.160
 over the following decades,

13:27.160 --> 13:32.160
 build a foundation for the development of African Americans

13:32.160 --> 13:35.160
 within the context of American society

13:35.160 --> 13:39.160
 that eventually culminated in the civil rights movement

13:39.160 --> 13:41.160
 of the middle of the 20th century.

13:41.160 --> 13:45.160
 And has led us into the present day.

13:45.160 --> 13:52.160
 So, you know, human nature can countenance awful evil,

13:52.160 --> 13:57.160
 but human nature can also survive in the face of terrible evil.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.160
 That's what I take from slavery.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.160
 That survival, that flame can burn

14:03.160 --> 14:07.160
 even when the world around it tries to put it out.

14:07.160 --> 14:11.160
 There's still a little flame of human consciousness,

14:11.160 --> 14:16.160
 of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is

14:16.160 --> 14:19.160
 that makes humans flourish and makes humans beautiful,

14:19.160 --> 14:20.160
 that lives on.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
 That's what everyone said.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.160
 Yeah, I think you put it very well.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.160
 There's got to be some poetic way of expressing that.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.160
 Leave it to the poets.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.160
 What about the people that look the other way?

14:34.160 --> 14:37.160
 How many people do you think just regular people

14:37.160 --> 14:40.160
 knew that something is, this is wrong?

14:40.160 --> 14:44.160
 Or do people through generations convince themselves,

14:44.160 --> 14:46.160
 most people, most regular people,

14:46.160 --> 14:51.160
 convince themselves that there's nothing wrong?

14:51.160 --> 14:55.160
 Yeah, I asked this question because I wonder

14:55.160 --> 14:59.160
 what we're looking the other way on today also.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.160
 Because you have to kind of,

15:02.160 --> 15:05.160
 you have to ask yourself these difficult questions

15:05.160 --> 15:09.160
 of assuming we're the same people we were.

15:09.160 --> 15:14.160
 Back then, we can be flawed in that same kind of way.

15:14.160 --> 15:19.160
 We can look the other way just as others have in history.

15:19.160 --> 15:24.160
 Yeah, you spoke of the European context

15:24.160 --> 15:28.160
 and of the Nazis and certainly a lot of people

15:28.160 --> 15:30.160
 had to be looking the other way

15:30.160 --> 15:33.160
 when the massive crimes that were committed

15:33.160 --> 15:36.160
 by that regime were being undertaken.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.160
 Railroad cars full of human beings

15:39.160 --> 15:41.160
 being taken off to be slaughtered

15:41.160 --> 15:45.160
 or to be worked to death and labor camps

15:45.160 --> 15:48.160
 or to be gassed, et cetera.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.160
 A lot of people had to know about what was going on

15:51.160 --> 15:54.160
 and look the other way

15:54.160 --> 15:58.160
 or enthusiastically supported the persecution of the Jews

15:58.160 --> 16:01.160
 and the Gypsies and so on.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.160
 And I don't know, I wasn't around in 1840.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.160
 My sense of the matter is that

16:08.160 --> 16:11.160
 like many practices that are unjust,

16:11.160 --> 16:14.160
 most people thought that's just the way it is.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.160
 I mean, that's the world that they inherited.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.160
 They were not moralists.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.160
 They were not revolutionaries.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.160
 They just wanted to go along.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.160
 Some people might have been troubled by it

16:24.160 --> 16:26.160
 but thought there's nothing that can be done.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.160
 Some people might have thought,

16:28.160 --> 16:30.160
 well, they're these black Africans,

16:30.160 --> 16:32.160
 they're not really like us

16:32.160 --> 16:35.160
 and they are lucky to be here.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.160
 If they were in Africa, they'd be worse off still.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.160
 Some people might have thought that.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.160
 Some people might have been disturbed

16:42.160 --> 16:44.160
 but not been able to see what it is

16:44.160 --> 16:47.160
 that they could do about it.

16:47.160 --> 16:51.160
 They might have thought, oh, this is disgusting.

16:51.160 --> 16:55.160
 This is not something I wouldn't want to have anything

16:55.160 --> 16:58.160
 to do with but not knowing

16:58.160 --> 17:02.160
 whether there's any practical way of opposing it.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.160
 That's why you need a movement.

17:05.160 --> 17:10.160
 You need for the people who are troubled by the practice

17:10.160 --> 17:12.160
 to know that there are others like themselves

17:12.160 --> 17:16.160
 equally troubled and as they gather together,

17:16.160 --> 17:20.160
 collectively they can exert their influence.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.160
 I mean, it debates about the wrongness of slavery

17:24.160 --> 17:28.160
 as I say, go all the way back to the founding of the country.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.160
 There were abolitionists

17:30.160 --> 17:33.160
 and there were people who opposed the compromise

17:33.160 --> 17:37.160
 that led to the framing documents

17:37.160 --> 17:40.160
 and institutions that created the United States of America,

17:40.160 --> 17:47.160
 opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation.

17:47.160 --> 17:52.160
 But it took a while before that could come to a head

17:52.160 --> 17:55.160
 and produce the crisis

17:55.160 --> 17:59.160
 which ultimately led to the eradication of slavery.

17:59.160 --> 18:05.160
 I would note that slavery is not unique to the United States.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.160
 It's not unique to the Western Hemisphere

18:08.160 --> 18:14.160
 that enslavement of people, the trafficking in human chattel

18:14.160 --> 18:18.160
 is something that one sees on a global basis.

18:18.160 --> 18:22.160
 One sees it going all the way back to antiquity

18:22.160 --> 18:26.160
 so we might ask how is it that people finally came

18:26.160 --> 18:30.160
 to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?

18:30.160 --> 18:34.160
 That might be the thing worth really trying to understand

18:34.160 --> 18:37.160
 because the practice itself is, you know,

18:37.160 --> 18:42.160
 there's a wonderful book by the sociologist Orlando Patterson

18:42.160 --> 18:46.160
 called Slavery and Social Death

18:46.160 --> 18:49.160
 that was published in 1982

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
 which is a comprehensive history and social analysis

18:53.160 --> 18:59.160
 of the institution of slavery over 2,500 years

18:59.160 --> 19:04.160
 going back to the classical Greek and Roman civilizations,

19:04.160 --> 19:08.160
 finding slavery in Africa amongst Africans,

19:08.160 --> 19:10.160
 finding slavery in the Middle East,

19:10.160 --> 19:12.160
 finding slavery in the Far East,

19:12.160 --> 19:14.160
 finding slavery in South Asia,

19:14.160 --> 19:16.160
 the enslavement of people,

19:16.160 --> 19:19.160
 the practice of taking someone as a captive in war

19:19.160 --> 19:22.160
 and then instead of killing them what you could do,

19:22.160 --> 19:25.160
 making them into your property

19:25.160 --> 19:30.160
 was a very, very widespread in human culture.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.160
 So, I mean, I like to make this point sometimes

19:33.160 --> 19:36.160
 when people are talking about how wrong slavery was

19:36.160 --> 19:39.160
 and I agree without any question

19:39.160 --> 19:46.160
 that the practice was profoundly morally problematic

19:46.160 --> 19:48.160
 but I like to make the point that,

19:48.160 --> 19:50.160
 given how wrong it was,

19:50.160 --> 19:55.160
 think about how impressive was the accomplishment

19:55.160 --> 19:58.160
 of the eradication of slavery.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.160
 That was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead

20:01.160 --> 20:06.160
 in the war between the states, 1861 to 1865

20:06.160 --> 20:08.160
 in a country of 30 million people.

20:08.160 --> 20:14.160
 That's a lot of dead people who gave their lives

20:14.160 --> 20:17.160
 not to eradicate slavery in every instance.

20:17.160 --> 20:21.160
 Probably most of them were just fighting for,

20:21.160 --> 20:25.160
 they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces

20:25.160 --> 20:27.160
 and they fought and they died

20:27.160 --> 20:30.160
 but the net effect of their having fought and died

20:30.160 --> 20:33.160
 was to push along a process

20:33.160 --> 20:35.160
 that led to the eradication of slavery.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.160
 That's an amazing achievement.

20:37.160 --> 20:43.160
 The slaves themselves were largely uneducated

20:43.160 --> 20:46.160
 and, you know, backward in there.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.160
 Of course, what else could they have been?

20:48.160 --> 20:50.160
 They were kept in captivity.

20:50.160 --> 20:54.160
 They were prevented from developing their human potential

20:54.160 --> 20:58.160
 and yet, after the end of slavery,

20:58.160 --> 21:03.160
 that population, that 4 million plus African descended people

21:03.160 --> 21:08.160
 became the foundation for what a century later

21:08.160 --> 21:12.160
 leads to Martin Luther King standing in the Washington Mall

21:12.160 --> 21:14.160
 and giving that great speech.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.160
 And now here we are 150 years down the road

21:18.160 --> 21:21.160
 and Barack Obama is president of the United States.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.160
 Now, he did not descend from slaves.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.160
 I think we must not lose track of that.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.160
 But he identified as an African American

21:29.160 --> 21:34.160
 and was a part of the population that consisted largely

21:34.160 --> 21:36.160
 of people who descended from slaves.

21:36.160 --> 21:40.160
 And we are, we African Americans are,

21:40.160 --> 21:45.160
 for all practical purposes, fully equal citizens

21:45.160 --> 21:47.160
 of this great republic.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.160
 That has happened within a century and a half

21:49.160 --> 21:52.160
 and I don't know that you can find any parallel

21:52.160 --> 21:56.160
 to that kind of transformation in the status of people

21:56.160 --> 22:01.160
 from human chattel to full citizens of the republic.

22:01.160 --> 22:06.160
 Anywhere in human history, it's certainly worth celebrating

22:06.160 --> 22:09.160
 the achievement of the eradication of slavery, I would say.

22:09.160 --> 22:14.160
 And it probably started with a few people

22:14.160 --> 22:18.160
 that inside their mind dared to rebel.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.160
 You know, it's interesting to think about how it all started.

22:22.160 --> 22:26.160
 How in the state of injustice,

22:26.160 --> 22:32.160
 the revolution percolates, like where it starts.

22:32.160 --> 22:36.160
 You said people that see something is wrong find each other.

22:36.160 --> 22:42.160
 It's, you know, it's in the ideas of charismatic individuals

22:42.160 --> 22:44.160
 that not only know that something is wrong,

22:44.160 --> 22:51.160
 but are able to tell others about it and be convincing.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.160
 And then together gather and rise up.

22:54.160 --> 22:58.160
 It's interesting to make this kind of incredible progress

22:58.160 --> 23:01.160
 from slavery to where we are today to live out the ideal

23:01.160 --> 23:05.160
 of this all men created equal.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.160
 Yeah, the power of individual,

23:07.160 --> 23:10.160
 because I don't know what you think about it,

23:10.160 --> 23:14.160
 but I tend to think that a few small individuals

23:14.160 --> 23:16.160
 probably originated this.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.160
 It's the power of the individual.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.160
 Because sometimes we think there's injustice in the world,

23:20.160 --> 23:22.160
 what can I possibly do?

23:22.160 --> 23:26.160
 I tend to think one person can be the seed

23:26.160 --> 23:29.160
 of starting to fix the injustice.

23:29.160 --> 23:34.160
 Sure, one person here, one person there.

23:34.160 --> 23:39.160
 Yeah, one thinks, of course, of Frederick Douglass,

23:39.160 --> 23:46.160
 the massively significant figure who was born in slavery,

23:46.160 --> 23:49.160
 who stole his freedom.

23:49.160 --> 23:53.160
 And because he was property and he decided

23:53.160 --> 23:55.160
 he was not going to be property anymore,

23:55.160 --> 23:59.160
 and he took it unto himself to emancipate himself personally

23:59.160 --> 24:05.160
 and who became an educated, powerfully articulate,

24:05.160 --> 24:09.160
 massively influential person in the United States

24:09.160 --> 24:15.160
 and in England going around presenting himself

24:15.160 --> 24:19.160
 as an embodiment of human dignity

24:19.160 --> 24:25.160
 and commitment to ideals of equality.

24:25.160 --> 24:30.160
 I mean, he's just one person, but there were others.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.160
 Just one person.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.160
 All it takes is just one person.

24:34.160 --> 24:43.160
 So here we are on this topic of equality in the 21st century.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.160
 What does equality mean today?

24:45.160 --> 24:53.160
 If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome

24:53.160 --> 24:56.160
 or the injustice of inequality,

24:56.160 --> 25:01.160
 at which point does equality of outcome is just?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.160
 At which point is it unjust?

25:03.160 --> 25:08.160
 Sort of looking at our world today and looking at inequality.

25:08.160 --> 25:14.160
 How do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice

25:14.160 --> 25:16.160
 and some is the way of life?

25:16.160 --> 25:19.160
 So what does equality mean when we look at the world today?

25:19.160 --> 25:23.160
 Different from Dr. King's speech of the basic humanity.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.160
 I don't think King's speech,

25:26.160 --> 25:30.160
 I have a dream that one day my four little children will be judged

25:30.160 --> 25:34.160
 not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character,

25:34.160 --> 25:40.160
 that requires equality of outcome.

25:40.160 --> 25:44.160
 He says his children will be judged by the content of their character.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.160
 That's a conditional statement.

25:46.160 --> 25:52.160
 That is, the judgment will depend upon the content of their character,

25:52.160 --> 25:54.160
 not the color of their skin,

25:54.160 --> 25:58.160
 but it doesn't follow from that that the outcomes,

25:58.160 --> 26:04.160
 whatever outcomes we consider wealth and economic power,

26:04.160 --> 26:10.160
 position within the society, representation in the various professions,

26:10.160 --> 26:13.160
 the various measures of social achievement,

26:13.160 --> 26:17.160
 doesn't follow from judging by the content of character

26:17.160 --> 26:19.160
 and that color of skin,

26:19.160 --> 26:22.160
 that when we look at the end of the day at the social outcomes,

26:22.160 --> 26:26.160
 that they will be equal across the different groups.

26:26.160 --> 26:29.160
 In fact, I think there's a contradiction in the idea

26:29.160 --> 26:34.160
 that groups will be equal in all the various social outcomes,

26:34.160 --> 26:37.160
 that they will be equally successful in business,

26:37.160 --> 26:42.160
 that they will be proportionately represented in the various professions,

26:42.160 --> 26:46.160
 that they will have the same educational achievement,

26:46.160 --> 26:51.160
 that the occupational profiles will look the same.

26:51.160 --> 26:59.160
 If they are, in fact, distinct groups with their own cultural traditions and practices,

26:59.160 --> 27:06.160
 with their own ideals and norms, various immigrant populations,

27:06.160 --> 27:11.160
 people coming to the United States of America from all corners of the world,

27:11.160 --> 27:17.160
 the descendants of the African slaves, the black Americans here today,

27:17.160 --> 27:22.160
 who are ourselves various with different origins and so on,

27:22.160 --> 27:32.160
 the different religious practices and commitments that Jewish or Mormon or Christian or whatever,

27:32.160 --> 27:39.160
 however we parcel up the total population into the various groups,

27:39.160 --> 27:43.160
 these groups are themselves different from one another.

27:43.160 --> 27:48.160
 They have different norms within their own cultural practice.

27:48.160 --> 27:54.160
 How would we expect, if in fact we recognize that the groups are different from one another,

27:54.160 --> 28:01.160
 that in a world that is fair, they would all come out equally represented in every undertaking.

28:01.160 --> 28:09.160
 They're not equally represented and that fact, I'm arguing, is in and of itself insufficient

28:09.160 --> 28:15.160
 to justify the conclusion that they're not somehow being fairly treated.

28:15.160 --> 28:21.160
 Fair treatment doesn't imply equal outcomes in a world in which the populations in question

28:21.160 --> 28:27.160
 are themselves different with respect to their culture, their practices, their norms, their traditions,

28:27.160 --> 28:31.160
 their beliefs, their ideals and so on.

28:31.160 --> 28:37.160
 The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs, cultural orientations and ideals

28:37.160 --> 28:44.160
 will have consequences in terms of their different social outcomes.

28:44.160 --> 28:53.160
 So I just think it's a mistake that people are making when they think fairness of treatment

28:53.160 --> 28:57.160
 implies equality of outcomes, it does not.

28:57.160 --> 29:07.160
 Is the process by which we're speaking now in the midst of the National Basketball Association's playoffs?

29:07.160 --> 29:10.160
 I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan.

29:10.160 --> 29:15.160
 I mean, I'm just, it's a very good team and I'm excited about my Celtics.

29:15.160 --> 29:22.160
 We defeated the Brooklyn Nets.

29:22.160 --> 29:31.160
 I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and Company in a playoff series.

29:31.160 --> 29:40.160
 We whipped them and we're on our way to the Eastern Conference finals and we're on our way to the NBA finals

29:40.160 --> 29:47.160
 and if I were a betting man, I'd put down a few bucks that the Boston Celtics, underrated as we are,

29:47.160 --> 29:50.160
 have a very good chance of winning the NBA finals.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.160
 Okay, so that's the NBA, that's the National Basketball Association.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.160
 I'm a sports fan, I like basketball.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.160
 Slightly biased prediction, but yes.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.160
 Yeah, it is somewhat biased.

29:59.160 --> 30:06.160
 All I'm saying is if you take a look at who the star players are in the National Basketball Association,

30:06.160 --> 30:09.160
 you're going to find that there's some Eastern Europeans.

30:09.160 --> 30:16.160
 You know, there's some really good basketball players coming out of Eastern Europe and more power to them.

30:16.160 --> 30:19.160
 And there are a lot of African Americans.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.160
 We're overrepresented.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.160
 They're not that many Jews, as far as I know.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.160
 No offense intended there, Lex.

30:26.160 --> 30:37.160
 But I mean, the NBA is not equally representative of all of the different populations in the United States.

30:37.160 --> 30:44.160
 Now, we could go into the reasons why, but I'm just saying the process by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.160
 If you can play, you can get on the court.

30:47.160 --> 30:51.160
 All they're looking for is people who can play.

30:51.160 --> 30:56.160
 I think something like that is true in many different venues.

30:56.160 --> 31:04.160
 I expect if you're a really good technical engineer, companies are going to employ you.

31:04.160 --> 31:12.160
 And if you can make money, they're going to advance you and you will be able to rise to the top of that profession.

31:12.160 --> 31:21.160
 And I expect that the people who are engaged in financial transactions, who are actually making bets on the market by and large,

31:21.160 --> 31:24.160
 are the people who are good at that activity.

31:24.160 --> 31:33.160
 And if you're good at that activity in this world, in this modern world, you're going to rise to the top.

31:33.160 --> 31:37.160
 I'm not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination.

31:37.160 --> 31:40.160
 Of course, there are of many different sorts.

31:40.160 --> 31:46.160
 But I'm saying that to expect that there would be, okay, I mean, let's look at who's actually writing code.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.160
 Let's look at who's actually trading bonds.

31:48.160 --> 31:54.160
 Let's look at who's actually starting businesses and so on.

31:54.160 --> 32:02.160
 To say that in a fair world, I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population, they'd be 10% of every one of those things,

32:02.160 --> 32:11.160
 is to ignore the reality that the differences in the culture and practices and norms of the various population groups

32:11.160 --> 32:20.160
 will lead to differences in their representation amongst people who are outstanding performers in one or another activity.

32:20.160 --> 32:35.160
 How do you know if the difference in culture accounts for the difference in outcomes or it's the existence of barriers, especially barriers early on in life of discrimination that are racially based.

32:35.160 --> 32:50.160
 So if you think about affirmative action, in which ways is affirmative action empowering, in which ways is it limiting for these early development of the different groups.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.160
 But let's just speak to African Americans.

32:52.160 --> 33:00.160
 We should say that you went to some no name Northwestern University at first, but then you ended up with a great university of MIT.

33:00.160 --> 33:06.160
 So that's your not early but middle development.

33:06.160 --> 33:12.160
 So speaking of the development, the opportunities, the equality of opportunity.

33:12.160 --> 33:16.160
 How do we know we got that equality right?

33:16.160 --> 33:19.160
 Yeah, I'm glad you put it like that.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.160
 We were talking about results.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.160
 Now we're talking about opportunity.

33:22.160 --> 33:37.160
 I was taking a position that when King says, I have a dream and he envisions a world where his children will not be barred from the good things in life because of the color of their skin.

33:37.160 --> 33:50.160
 We're talking about opportunity, not about results, but opportunity is not just something that depends upon what the law is and what public policies are.

33:50.160 --> 33:58.160
 Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions in which people are raised, the social and economic conditions.

33:58.160 --> 34:11.160
 So the child of a poor family that has no resources, it doesn't have the same opportunity as a child of a wealthy family to realize their full human potential.

34:11.160 --> 34:26.160
 You asked me how can we tell whether or not a difference in outcomes is a reflection of unequal opportunity or it's a reflection of differences in culture and interest and practice.

34:26.160 --> 34:33.160
 And I don't know that there's a single answer to that question, but I think one wants to look at the data.

34:33.160 --> 34:48.160
 One wants to try to measure, as a social scientist, I would say what you want to do is you want to estimate the significance of various factors for determining the outcome.

34:48.160 --> 34:58.160
 If the outcome is how much money does a person make when they work in the labor market so you look at their wages and you think, well, that depends upon a number of things.

34:58.160 --> 35:06.160
 It depends upon how educated they are, what kind of skills they have, what kind of work experience they have, and so on.

35:06.160 --> 35:15.160
 And those things are all legitimate factors that might determine how much they end up making in the labor market.

35:15.160 --> 35:33.160
 But you also want to perhaps controlling for those things, see whether or not the fact that they are black or they are Latino or whatever, fact that they are male or that they are female, the fact that they do or do not speak English as their native language,

35:33.160 --> 35:42.160
 this kind of thing, whether those factors also are implicated in determining how successful they are in the labor market.

35:42.160 --> 35:58.160
 And if you find that after you have controlled for the things that are legitimately determining success and failure in the labor market, like skills and education and experience, having controlled for those things,

35:58.160 --> 36:18.160
 the fact that a person is black or is a woman or is an immigrant or is of Latino background also affects their earnings, then you might conclude that to that extent, they are not getting equal opportunity in the labor market, that kind of idea.

36:18.160 --> 36:36.160
 But I want to focus a little bit more here on what we mean by opportunity because it's not just whether employers treat the worker on a fair and even basis, irregardless of the workers racial or ethnic background.

36:36.160 --> 36:50.160
 That's one opportunity issue, but that's at the end of the development process. They are now presenting themselves to the market, trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage.

36:50.160 --> 36:58.160
 That's the end of the line. What about the developmental opportunity, the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place.

36:58.160 --> 37:10.160
 That goes all the way back. That goes all the way back to birth. It even goes back to before birth. The mother carrying the infant in the womb.

37:10.160 --> 37:28.160
 She has certain nutritional practices and she might be smoking or drinking alcohol or something like that. I'm not saying she is. I'm not saying she isn't. I'm just saying whether she is and it will affect the development of the fetus, the newborn.

37:28.160 --> 37:44.160
 Now there's a question of environment. There's a question of the development of their neurological potential. Do they learn how to read? Are they stimulated verbally? How many words have they heard spoken?

37:44.160 --> 37:55.160
 Are they being nurtured in a home environment so as to maximize the possibility of them achieving their human potential?

37:55.160 --> 38:05.160
 What about the peer group influences? What about the values and norms of the surrounding human communities in which they're embedded?

38:05.160 --> 38:18.160
 Do they encourage the young person to apply themselves in a systematic way to their studies and to their focus on their acquisition of language command

38:18.160 --> 38:29.160
 and of their educational potential? Development is not only something that is controlled by the society's practices.

38:29.160 --> 38:39.160
 It's also something that is influenced by the cultural background of the individual. Those things are not equal.

38:39.160 --> 38:52.160
 Those things vary across groups in a very significant way and that too will be a factor determining disparities of outcome.

38:52.160 --> 39:00.160
 So when I see outcomes that are different, I see wealth holding that's different. I see educational achievement that's different.

39:00.160 --> 39:06.160
 I see representation in the professional schools and law school and medical school that's different between groups.

39:06.160 --> 39:11.160
 One question is, are the institutions treating people fairly?

39:11.160 --> 39:20.160
 But another question is, do the background in social and cultural influences equip people in the same way?

39:20.160 --> 39:25.160
 And we know that the answer to that, not in every instance, do they equip people in the same way?

39:25.160 --> 39:36.160
 And so it makes the judgment, the moral judgment that we make when we see inequality of outcome complicated.

39:36.160 --> 39:44.160
 Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree, but it is also a cultural factor to some degree, I want to say.

39:44.160 --> 39:51.160
 And that's controversial. I know a lot of people, they think of themselves as being progressive.

39:51.160 --> 39:57.160
 They want to point a finger at society whenever they see a disparity.

39:57.160 --> 40:05.160
 But I think that that's a mistake. I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem.

40:05.160 --> 40:13.160
 You think that if you get the right law, if you have the right public policy, if the right politicians are elected to office,

40:13.160 --> 40:22.160
 suddenly those disparities will go away. And I'm here to tell you that that's a false hope.

40:22.160 --> 40:27.160
 And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal.

40:27.160 --> 40:33.160
 But I mean, we could go into that. You were talking about affirmative action, which is something else altogether.

40:33.160 --> 40:39.160
 And you were talking about me and my education, which is also something that's a little bit different.

40:39.160 --> 40:44.160
 And I'm happy to talk about those things. Northwestern University, by the way, was a great university.

40:44.160 --> 40:48.160
 I'm just joking. It's one of the great universities of the world, yes.

40:48.160 --> 40:54.160
 And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University, which is how I ended up at MIT in the first place.

40:54.160 --> 41:00.160
 And I got a very good technical training in mathematics when I was at Northwestern.

41:00.160 --> 41:11.160
 You love both mathematics and human nature, which is why you ended up going into economics at one of the great economics programs in the world at MIT

41:11.160 --> 41:16.160
 and getting your PhD there. So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist,

41:16.160 --> 41:24.160
 which allows you to think systematically and rigorously about the way the world and the way humans work at scale,

41:24.160 --> 41:33.160
 trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans, like a psychology perspective economics allows you to do.

41:33.160 --> 41:39.160
 Well, economics is one of the social sciences. I think there's value in psychology and in sociology.

41:39.160 --> 41:43.160
 There's a lot to know that doesn't come up within the study of economics.

41:43.160 --> 41:54.160
 We study markets and dynamics of economic development and trade and so on.

41:54.160 --> 42:01.160
 But yeah, speaking personally, as I was coming along, I was fascinated by mathematics.

42:01.160 --> 42:12.160
 I was good at it and ended up at Northwestern and took a lot of courses there and functional analysis and logic and mathematics

42:12.160 --> 42:20.160
 and dynamical systems and stuff that I ended up employing in my graduate studies in economics.

42:20.160 --> 42:27.160
 But you're right, I was not satisfied simply to be proving theorems.

42:27.160 --> 42:33.160
 I wanted to be addressing issues of social significance and economics.

42:33.160 --> 42:45.160
 I discovered, to my delight, was a field of study that allowed me both to develop rigorous analytical frameworks,

42:45.160 --> 42:54.160
 modeling and precision of logical deduction and inference.

42:54.160 --> 43:00.160
 On the one hand, satisfying my mathematical interests,

43:00.160 --> 43:07.160
 but on the other hand, could address questions of social significance like why does racial inequality persist?

43:07.160 --> 43:12.160
 Why are some countries prospering and growing and others less so?

43:12.160 --> 43:19.160
 Why do the prices of raw materials fluctuate in the way that they do over time and so on and so forth?

43:19.160 --> 43:29.160
 And I ended up falling in love with the application of mathematical analysis to the study of social issues.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.160
 What do you use beautiful about?

43:31.160 --> 43:37.160
 Mathematics, about mathematical puzzles, about logic, all those kinds of things.

43:37.160 --> 43:41.160
 It's still there, the love for math is still there for you.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.160
 So is there something you could speak to?

43:43.160 --> 43:47.160
 What is the kernel, the flame of that love?

43:47.160 --> 43:49.160
 It's like magic.

43:49.160 --> 44:00.160
 Being able to prove something, I think of offhand, there's no largest prime number.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.160
 How would somebody know that?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.160
 Okay, what's a prime number?

44:03.160 --> 44:08.160
 So a prime number is a whole number that has no divisor other than one.

44:08.160 --> 44:17.160
 There are no divisors of the number that makes it a prime number, like 13 or 19 or 37, whatever.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.160
 So they're prime numbers.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.160
 There's no largest prime number.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.160
 They're infinite number of prime numbers.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.160
 There's no largest prime number.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.160
 Okay, that's an idea.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.160
 You can get your mind around it in an instant.

44:26.160 --> 44:31.160
 It doesn't take a whole lot of depth to see the question.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.160
 There's no largest prime number.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.160
 I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics.

44:35.160 --> 44:39.160
 Oh, they don't show up in economics, except cryptography.

44:39.160 --> 44:44.160
 I understand that's important for coding stuff.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.160
 And that shows up in economics.

44:46.160 --> 44:50.160
 In terms of models, probably not.

44:50.160 --> 44:59.160
 So prime numbers are little abstract algebra.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.160
 They show up in all these places.

45:01.160 --> 45:06.160
 They're just beautiful mathematical puzzles that don't immediately have an application,

45:06.160 --> 45:12.160
 but somehow maybe challenge you and as a result, push mathematics forward.

45:12.160 --> 45:18.160
 That's the last theorem, as far as I know, no obvious real world application,

45:18.160 --> 45:21.160
 but it has challenged mathematicians throughout the centuries.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.160
 Indeed.

45:22.160 --> 45:28.160
 And somehow indirectly progressed the field.

45:28.160 --> 45:32.160
 The rational numbers are countable.

45:32.160 --> 45:37.160
 They can be put in one to one relationship with the integers.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.160
 But that the real numbers are not countable.

45:39.160 --> 45:41.160
 There's a lot more, quote unquote, more real numbers.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.160
 These are orders of infinity.

45:43.160 --> 45:48.160
 This is Cantor, Georg Cantor, and all that kind of stuff.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.160
 Or Gertl's theorem.

45:50.160 --> 45:54.160
 I studied this as an undergraduate, the incompleteness theorem.

45:54.160 --> 46:02.160
 There are propositions within any logical system that's rich enough to accommodate arithmetic.

46:02.160 --> 46:06.160
 There are going to be propositions that you can formulate that are true,

46:06.160 --> 46:10.160
 but that you cannot prove to be true.

46:10.160 --> 46:18.160
 So the idea that you could systematically develop a logical framework for mathematical inquiry

46:18.160 --> 46:27.160
 that could demonstrate the truth or falsity of any proposition is not a feasible goal.

46:27.160 --> 46:35.160
 This was Hilbert's project, as I understand it, and Gertl showed that there was no hope ever

46:35.160 --> 46:44.160
 of being able to demonstrate the closure of logical systems that were rich enough to accommodate the real numbers.

46:44.160 --> 46:51.160
 They gave an existential crisis to all mathematicians and scientists alike, and humans,

46:51.160 --> 46:53.160
 because maybe you can't prove everything.

46:53.160 --> 47:00.160
 I remember when I was a junior college, a community college student before I transferred to Northwestern,

47:00.160 --> 47:05.160
 and I took a calculus course, and it was a lot of fun.

47:05.160 --> 47:13.160
 It was differentiating algebraic expressions and integrating and using trigonometric substitutions.

47:13.160 --> 47:16.160
 It was a lot of simple problem solving.

47:16.160 --> 47:20.160
 I get to Northwestern, I take a course in differential equations.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.160
 Again, it was a lot of formulaic applying.

47:23.160 --> 47:29.160
 If you get a differential equation of this structure, like if it's linear, you got exponentials, etc., you can solve it.

47:29.160 --> 47:38.160
 Then I took a course that showed where the question was not how to solve any particular functional expression,

47:38.160 --> 47:46.160
 but it was proving the existence of a solution to a differential equation where it was like x dot equals f of x and t,

47:46.160 --> 47:49.160
 and f is just some arbitrary function.

47:49.160 --> 47:56.160
 What do I have to assume about the function f in order to know that there exists a solution to the differential equation,

47:56.160 --> 48:00.160
 dx dt equals f of x and t?

48:00.160 --> 48:03.160
 They called it a Lipschitz condition.

48:03.160 --> 48:11.160
 It's a condition about the bounding of the slope of the function f as a function of x

48:11.160 --> 48:17.160
 that you can uniformly bound the slope on that function,

48:17.160 --> 48:27.160
 and then you can use an iterative process to show that the sequence of partial solutions to the thing converges to something that's a solution to the real thing.

48:27.160 --> 48:32.160
 Again, I'm not going to bore you or pretend that I'm a mathematician.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.160
 I'm not.

48:33.160 --> 48:42.160
 But what I'm saying is the difference between a specific algebraic formula that you can manipulate and solve on the one hand,

48:42.160 --> 48:53.160
 and the abstract question of whether there exists a solution in the general case was like a huge step for me in my study of mathematics,

48:53.160 --> 49:02.160
 and the techniques that you have to employ to address these larger questions and so on.

49:02.160 --> 49:15.160
 When I was an undergraduate, I took the first year PhD sequence in math analysis at Northwestern from a brilliant mathematician named Avner Friedman

49:15.160 --> 49:25.160
 and learned about measure theory and learned about some early functional analysis ideas.

49:25.160 --> 49:32.160
 And when I saw that those ideas were being applied by advanced study in economics, I was delighted.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.160
 I found an intellectual home.

49:34.160 --> 49:45.160
 So one of the fascinating challenges in mathematics is to think which echoes the challenge of economics.

49:45.160 --> 49:53.160
 What are the properties of an equation that allow you to say something profound and say it simply?

49:53.160 --> 50:03.160
 And so the question of economics is how do you construct a model where you can generalize nicely and say something profound and say it simply?

50:03.160 --> 50:16.160
 So one of the challenges of economics is macro versus microeconomics is the world is made up of individuals.

50:16.160 --> 50:24.160
 So there's a connection to our discussion of race and discrimination and outcomes and all those kinds of things.

50:24.160 --> 50:36.160
 The world is made up of individuals, but in order to say something general, we have to construct groups in order to analyze the data.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.160
 We have to aggregate that data somehow.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.160
 We have to make an average over some set of people.

50:41.160 --> 50:53.160
 So what are the pros and cons of looking at things like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome based on groups versus based on individuals?

50:53.160 --> 51:02.160
 And what are the groups if there's any pros to looking at groups that we should be looking at?

51:02.160 --> 51:04.160
 Okay, those are big questions.

51:04.160 --> 51:14.160
 I mean, in economics, you're right, I mean, micro, you have an account of how individuals make decisions about spending their money on this consumption side

51:14.160 --> 51:24.160
 and about how enterprises make decisions about what to produce, how much of it, what inputs to use, what techniques of production and so on.

51:24.160 --> 51:37.160
 Individual firms, individual consumers, and then you want to aggregate, so there's a theory of so called theory of general equilibrium where, you know, you think supply and demand and a bunch of markets,

51:37.160 --> 51:46.160
 you think prices that move to equilibrate, but you recognize that the price in one market affects people's behavior in another, the markets interacting with each other.

51:46.160 --> 51:59.160
 You realize that the behavior one individual affects the supplies and available resources and for other individuals, so they're knitted together in some kind of systematic way.

51:59.160 --> 52:15.160
 And you want to try to demonstrate the fact that notwithstanding all these interdependencies, there exists a solution to the system of equations that equates demand and supply across all the different markets.

52:15.160 --> 52:18.160
 This is the existence of general equilibrium.

52:18.160 --> 52:24.160
 Then you want to try to say something about the properties of an equilibrium if it exists.

52:24.160 --> 52:27.160
 Is it efficient? Well, what do you mean by efficiency?

52:27.160 --> 52:35.160
 Well, the idea of so called Pareto efficient outcomes, these are outcomes that cannot be uniformly improved upon.

52:35.160 --> 52:38.160
 Everybody can't be made better off by an alternative outcome.

52:38.160 --> 52:43.160
 You want to demonstrate the efficiency of competitive equilibrium.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.160
 What do you mean by competition?

52:45.160 --> 52:51.160
 You mean that people take their actions to do the best for themselves that they can.

52:51.160 --> 52:58.160
 Profits of firms, well being of consumers, they try to do the best for themselves that they can.

52:58.160 --> 53:03.160
 But they do so in reference to a set of prices that they believe they cannot control.

53:03.160 --> 53:08.160
 That's the criterion of competitive market circumstance.

53:08.160 --> 53:11.160
 So does a competitive equilibrium exist?

53:11.160 --> 53:20.160
 Do there exist a set of prices which if everybody recognizes them as given and responds to those prices on behalf of their own interests,

53:20.160 --> 53:27.160
 the outcome will be supply, equaling demand in all the markets where people are interacting with one another.

53:27.160 --> 53:35.160
 That requires the use of some concepts in topology, fixed point theorems and whatnot that are familiar to mathematics.

53:35.160 --> 53:41.160
 Not very deep mathematical results, but important to economics.

53:41.160 --> 53:43.160
 That's all about general equilibrium and whatnot.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.160
 But you ask about groups.

53:45.160 --> 53:50.160
 By the way, amazing world win summary of all of economics, but yes, go ahead.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.160
 That was great.

53:52.160 --> 53:59.160
 Markets of competition, of Pareto efficiency, anyway, but yes, groups.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
 And prices.

54:01.160 --> 54:10.160
 And by the way, there are some very beautiful formalizations of everything that I'm saying here.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.160
 You end up in vector spaces.

54:12.160 --> 54:16.160
 You end up with sets of bundles of consumption and production.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.160
 You end up with convexity.

54:18.160 --> 54:30.160
 You end up with hyperplanes, which are in this finite dimensional vector space, which are all of the bundles that have the same value at a certain price.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.160
 You end up with inner products.

54:32.160 --> 54:36.160
 And it's just very pretty.

54:36.160 --> 54:46.160
 Yeah, but you almost forget that it's just a bunch of humans transacting with each other, that markets are made up of individuals.

54:46.160 --> 54:49.160
 Markets are made up of individuals.

54:49.160 --> 54:54.160
 And in order to carry out this formalization, you have to make assumptions about the individuals.

54:54.160 --> 55:07.160
 And the end result is true in a formal sense, but may not be true as a representation of the reality, because it depends upon assumptions that themselves may not hold.

55:07.160 --> 55:18.160
 But at least you know what it is that has to be true in order for your formal framework to be relevant, which is already a step in the right direction, I think.

55:18.160 --> 55:32.160
 I mean, the formalization is better than the intuition, the armchair intuition, where we sit back and we don't really know exactly what we're talking about because we haven't pinned it down in a precise way.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.160
 I'm in favor of the formalization.

55:34.160 --> 55:38.160
 People, they think, what is mathematics and the social sciences?

55:38.160 --> 55:40.160
 After all, we're dealing with people.

55:40.160 --> 55:41.160
 People are not automata.

55:41.160 --> 55:43.160
 I agree with that.

55:43.160 --> 56:00.160
 But the analysis of the interaction of people, I think, to be rigorous, requires us to be specific about what we're talking about, about markets, about consumers, about firms, about profits, about technology, about preferences.

56:00.160 --> 56:05.160
 And that's the language of economics.

56:05.160 --> 56:14.160
 But people's behavior depends upon what they seek in life, depends upon their goals and their objectives.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.160
 Those things are at play.

56:17.160 --> 56:20.160
 They can be pushed this way or that.

56:20.160 --> 56:37.160
 So I mean, nationalism, fighting and dying for your country, religion, sacrificing on behalf of some abstract ideal of the good or of what is the human situation and what is the meaning of life.

56:37.160 --> 56:48.160
 Economists have to assume that these things are some particular thing before they can turn the crank on their machine to analyze the outcomes of human interaction.

56:48.160 --> 57:06.160
 And yet these things, belief in my identity, but the things that I'm willing to sacrifice and die for, purposes of life that I affirm and pass on to my children, are important preconditions for actually carrying out any economic analysis.

57:06.160 --> 57:10.160
 And they are subject to manipulation and to change over time.

57:10.160 --> 57:15.160
 And that's not something that economics has a whole lot to say about.

57:15.160 --> 57:22.160
 Well, is there some general things that are really powerful in terms of you said nation, religion?

57:22.160 --> 57:24.160
 Those are groups.

57:24.160 --> 57:29.160
 Can you group people nicely in helping you understand human nature?

57:29.160 --> 57:34.160
 So group them into nations based on their citizenry.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.160
 That's geography, right?

57:36.160 --> 57:48.160
 The geographic location of your birth or your long term residence or maybe religious belief, what religion you believe over time.

57:48.160 --> 57:52.160
 Is there groups like that and then race?

57:52.160 --> 57:55.160
 Is that useful?

57:55.160 --> 58:02.160
 What are the pros and cons of looking at outcomes based on these kinds of groups?

58:02.160 --> 58:05.160
 Race in particular.

58:05.160 --> 58:09.160
 I think they're pros and I think they're cons.

58:09.160 --> 58:14.160
 I mean, I am myself. Glenn Lowry sits before you right now.

58:14.160 --> 58:21.160
 A black American, an African American, I quote, unquote, I identify as, you know, that's the way they talk about it nowadays.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.160
 I identify as a black American.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.160
 My skin is brown.

58:24.160 --> 58:26.160
 My hair is coarse.

58:26.160 --> 58:30.160
 My nose is broad relative to the way other people's noses look.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.160
 My lips are thicker.

58:32.160 --> 58:46.160
 That's a consequence of my ancestral descent from the human population resident in the African continent in millennia past.

58:46.160 --> 58:49.160
 My race.

58:49.160 --> 58:59.160
 Here in the United States, we have various quote unquote races defined crudely in the way that I just tried to define myself.

58:59.160 --> 59:07.160
 You could say, and I think there is a very powerful argument that these are superficial differences.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.160
 I mean, really?

59:09.160 --> 59:19.160
 Why should it matter that your eye color or your hair color or the shape of the bones in your face or the color, the tone of your skin,

59:19.160 --> 59:26.160
 the amount of melanin, how it is that you react to ultraviolet radiation in terms of your skin?

59:26.160 --> 59:30.160
 What is that to be the basis of anything?

59:30.160 --> 59:32.160
 I mean, that's arbitrary.

59:32.160 --> 59:33.160
 That's not meaningful.

59:33.160 --> 59:38.160
 Could there really be meaning in these superficial differences among human beings?

59:38.160 --> 59:47.160
 Isn't that a archaic or barbaric way of thinking about ourselves to look at each other's skin color or hair texture and then to decide,

59:47.160 --> 59:57.160
 that's a black or that's a white or that's a Latin or that's an Asian or that's a whatever, that's something that we should outgrow.

59:57.160 --> 1:00:15.160
 A person might say, that's a relic of a kind of tribal society, of a kind of pre modern society where we built real structure on the basis of such superficial difference.

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:17.160
 I could say that.

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:20.160
 On the other hand, I am a black American.

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:23.160
 I mean, that's part of my identity.

1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:25.160
 That's part of my heritage.

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:32.160
 It's part of the stories that I tell myself about who my people are.

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:34.160
 Why do I need a people?

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:44.160
 Why do I need a narrative of descent in which I affiliate with a racially defined people?

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:46.160
 Do I really need that?

1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:48.160
 I mean, I think that's an important question.

1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:51.160
 In fact, this is a confession.

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:53.160
 Think of myself as black.

1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:55.160
 I could think of myself as simply human.

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.160
 I could not identify specifically as black.

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.160
 I could say, my eyes are brown too.

1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:03.160
 So what?

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.160
 I'm a brown eye.

1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:08.160
 I'm going to invent a group based on my eye color.

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:10.160
 I weigh 290 pounds.

1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:12.160
 I'm going to have a body size group.

1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:17.160
 I'm a plus 200, and that's quote, who I am, close quote.

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:18.160
 I don't do that.

1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:20.160
 I came from Chicago.

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:23.160
 Yes, I do have a certain sense of affinity with my hometown.

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:30.160
 I'm a Chicago born person, but frankly, I haven't lived in Chicago since 1979.

1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:32.160
 That's a long time.

1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:37.160
 I wear my Chicago origins very, very lightly.

1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:46.160
 I would not go to war with someone from Cleveland or St. Louis and fight to the death with that St. Louis person or that Cleveland person.

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.160
 Based upon the fact that we come from different cities.

1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:53.160
 And you have even abandoned in your heart the Chicago Bulls?

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:57.160
 There's some Chicago that's still in me, I suppose, but it's not very deep.

1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:00.160
 It's not quote, who I am anymore.

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:02.160
 And I'm wondering, I hear I'm trying to pose a question.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:06.160
 Why is it that being a descendant of African slaves should be who I am?

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.160
 So there's some answers.

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:16.160
 One answer is people will look at me and deal with me differently based upon what they see.

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.160
 I don't have control over that.

1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:27.160
 I'm going to be perceived as a member of a group, whether or not I elect to affiliate myself with that group or not.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:44.160
 Therefore, I need to be mindful of the fact that regardless of what my internal orientation is, the world will perceive me in a particular way and will perceive me differently based upon the color of my skin.

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:59.160
 So a police officer who stops me at two o clock in the morning because my tail light is out and ask me for my automobile registration and I reach quickly to the glove compartment to get my registration.

1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:02.160
 And the police officer says, show me your hands.

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:15.160
 I don't quite hear what he says or I ignore what he says as I'm getting my document out of my glove compartment, but the police officer thinks because I have not responded to his demand to show my hands that I might be reaching for a weapon.

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:31.160
 And the police officer sees that I'm black and fears that the likelihood that I might have a weapon is higher because in that town at that time, a lot of the people who get stopped with weapons in their car happen to be black and male and so on.

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:37.160
 And he pulls his weapon and he discharges it and I'm bleeding out there and I'm dead now.

1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:54.160
 And all of that is a possibility that's very real and is based upon the color of my skin and therefore when he stops me, I keep my hands on the steering wheel and I don't go to the glove compartment and I'm fearful of the fact that he might mistake me for a criminal, etc.

1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:02.160
 Or I walk into a high end store clothing store. I see you nicely dressed there legs. I'm not, but that's okay.

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:06.160
 I do have some good clothes at home. I just didn't wear them here today.

1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:19.160
 But you know what I mean and the clothing, the salesman in the clothing store either treats me like, you know, an old friend and is warm and welcoming and what can I do for you, sir?

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:27.160
 And let me show you this and that and what are you looking for and what because he thinks I'm going to spend $1,000 there that day and he's going to get a 5% commission or whatever it is.

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:40.160
 And, you know, he either does that or he ignores me and looks at me with suspicion and thinks I might be trying to shoplift something or thinks I'm only going to spend $50 and not $500 and therefore I'm not worth his time.

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:54.160
 And I'm aware of the fact that when I go into the clothing store, especially the high end places where I can buy some buy a good suit or, you know, buy some really good dress shirts or slacks that fit me well and so on.

1:04:54.160 --> 1:05:09.160
 I'm aware of the fact that I may not be taken seriously by the salesman based upon the fact that he's looking at me and he sees a black person and therefore I dress up before I go to go out to buy clothes to get, you know,

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:23.160
 because I want to present myself as not someone who just walked in off the street but as one of those black people who is really prepared to spend some money in the store so that I can be treated with respect and I have to carry the burden, such as it is,

1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:39.160
 of knowing that I need to earn the being taken seriously by overcoming the suppositions that people may have about me based upon the color of my skin, something like that.

1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:52.160
 Or I ask myself, what am I going to teach my children about who they are and where they come from what stories am I going to tell them about their ancestors who are their ancestors.

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:59.160
 Every African American has European ancestors, every black person in the United States of America.

1:05:59.160 --> 1:06:02.160
 I think that I can say that almost without exception.

1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:05.160
 We could go to 23 and me and look at the DNA.

1:06:05.160 --> 1:06:09.160
 They have European ancestors, they're not purely African.

1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:18.160
 That's a fact and that's a consequence of the experience of African descended people because it's a mixed population.

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:31.160
 My name is Lowry, spelled L O U R Y but pronounced as if it were L O W E R Y and I gather if you trace the history of that name that it's Scottish.

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:35.160
 So somewhere she could identify as a Scott.

1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:40.160
 Well, I could claim some Scottish descent, but I don't.

1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:47.160
 I don't know who those ancestors are and frankly, I don't know who my enslaved ancestors are.

1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:54.160
 I can't trace my family history back very far into the 19th century.

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:59.160
 But so what what stories do I tell my children about who we are about who their ancestors are.

1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:08.160
 I mean, I want to tell my children some story and that story is going to be colored quote unquote by my race.

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:18.160
 So even though it is superficial and in an ideal world, you might think, why would human beings, I mean, I read science fiction.

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:21.160
 So there's this Chinese writer Chicks and Lou is his name.

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:23.160
 I might not pronounce it exactly right.

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:27.160
 C I X I N L I U Chicks and Lou.

1:07:27.160 --> 1:07:31.160
 He has a trilogy of the three body problem.

1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:50.160
 The Dark Forest and Death's End. Those are the three books of Chicks and Lou's trilogy about how tri solaris, which is another star system within a few light light years of the solar system and Earth get into a conflict.

1:07:50.160 --> 1:08:09.160
 And when the tri solaris come down to dominate Earth, suddenly all of these differences between the Chinese and the North Americans and the Europeans and the Africans and the South Asians become kind of insignificant because after all the tri solaris

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:24.160
 with their advanced civilization, whose star system is dying, have their eyes on the solar system, which has a planet the third rock from the sun that is pretty habitable and, you know, the difference between us become pretty insignificant.

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:43.160
 So we shouldn't need for an invasion by extraterrestrial beings to have to happen before we would recognize the common humanity that we all share that is profound and is deep.

1:08:43.160 --> 1:09:02.160
 We all descend in effect from the same ancestral population of homo sapiens who walked out of East Africa eons ago and have survived amongst all of the different possible, you know, variations of species and whatnot of humanoid population homo sapiens have

1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:19.160
 died out of the same solaris, the others have died out. And here we are. And, you know, we can just look at the genetic endowment said characterize our biological essence and we can see that we are quote unquote the same beneath the skin and yet we end up

1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:39.160
 freighting so much weight onto these superficial differences so I can I can see both sides of the issue is what I'm saying, I can see the argument races and the relevancy, because at the end of the day, deep down, it is, but I can also see the argument that I hold on to racial identity

1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:51.160
 because a my racial presentation colors how other people deal with me, but B, because everybody needs a story.

1:09:51.160 --> 1:10:05.160
 You know, everybody needs an account you tell me you're Jewish I mean I don't know how deep that is I don't know how genetically profound that is I do know that it's a culturally profound identity for a lot of people.

1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:16.160
 Based upon maybe some of the same kind of forces that I'm talking about a they won't let you not be Jewish. You could say you're not Jewish but when Hitler is rounding people up.

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:24.160
 What you say doesn't have a whole lot of do with what the Gestapo was about. And B, you need to tell your children a story.

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:43.160
 Yeah, that's the fascinating thing about this tribalism that you spoke about that we form tribes as humans throughout human history form tribes and have directed hate toward other tribes and sometimes violence and destruction.

1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:57.160
 And yet, tribalism allows you to tell a story to your children allows you to grow a culture. There's something about defining yourself within particular tribe that allows you to have a tradition.

1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:04.160
 Yeah, you have an article that you wrote called the case for black patriotism.

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:20.160
 Oh, yeah. So I should also say it's so interesting because for me personally, I feel identify as believe I am an American.

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:38.160
 And yet within the American umbrella, it feels that there's a longing for other tribes. You mentioned Jewish, but what I honestly feel is I mean a lot of it is humor and culture and so on is Russian and Ukrainian because that's that's where I come from.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:57.160
 That's where my family is from. You know, there's like stereotypical things that are funny humorous type of thing about Russians showing no emotion, good at chess and math, into wrestling, drinking vodka.

1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:05.160
 I mean, there's literally every single stereotype I'm in the embodiment of that. So there's a you celebrate that in certain kinds of ways. There's a tradition there.

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:22.160
 And within the American umbrella and some of it is humor. Some of it is little quirks of culture, but now with the war in Russian Ukraine, interestingly enough, even that little thing becomes also a source of negative tribalism.

1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:31.160
 But anyway, that context aside, what is black patriotism? And why do you feel?

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:40.160
 I mean, I'm speaking in an article called the case for black patriotism in a particular context.

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:48.160
 And what I'm saying basically is very simple. I'm saying we are African Americans.

1:12:48.160 --> 1:13:02.160
 And the emphasis should be on the American. I actually don't even much care for the framing African American, but I'm not going to fight with people about it.

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:10.160
 It's, you know, I don't think it's worth fighting about. That's not how I would just say we're Americans. Or if you want, we're black Americans.

1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:25.160
 We're certainly not African. That is, the African American population is a population of people who come into existence here in North America through the cauldron of slavery.

1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:40.160
 There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa, immigrants from West Africa, immigrants from Southern Africa, immigrants from the Caribbean, who descend from an ancestral population, which is African.

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:53.160
 We, you know, the history of the world since 1500 is a history in which people of African descent are scattered because of slavery throughout the Western hemisphere.

1:13:53.160 --> 1:14:06.160
 And so here we are. But the institution of slavery ended in 1863 in the United States.

1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:19.160
 The struggle that we started out talking about, which gave rise to Martin Luther King giving that speech that you say is the greatest speech in American history, and I'm not going to argue with you about that.

1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:28.160
 It happened right here in the United States. We are, what is the United States? The United States is a nation of immigrants.

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:46.160
 The population of the North American continent was sparsely populated by an indigenous population, which was destroyed in conquest by a European population that settled here in North America and appropriated the land,

1:14:46.160 --> 1:15:07.160
 and have built a civilization here, which has been people by large influx of individuals from Europe, and Irish, and Italian, and Greek, and Slavic, and Jewish, Russian Jews coming in large numbers and so on and wave after wave after wave of immigration.

1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:17.160
 Asian, Latin American population of people have come to reside here in the United States, and we black Americans who descend from slaves.

1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:36.160
 We African Americans who descend from slaves. So here we are. This is a great nation. I mean, this is a monumentally significant political force, which is the United States of America founded in 1776, 1787.

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:53.160
 It fought a war of independence from the British established a republic, which is a confederation of these independent colonies, which has grown into now the 50 States of the United States of America continental nation.

1:15:53.160 --> 1:16:11.160
 The richest and most powerful nation on the planet with massive influence throughout the world at for good and for ill. That's who we are. I want to say to black people, there is no other home for us.

1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:30.160
 This fantasy of we being a people apart. Back in the day when I was coming along in the 1960s, there was something called the Republic of New Africa movement, and they wanted some states in the south, given over to black people and we were going to have our own country.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:51.160
 And that's a, that's a joke. It's a fantasy. It's, it's, it's, it's a mythic, unbalanced, unrealistic, fanciful politics. It's not a serious politics. We're Americans. We're not going anywhere here.

1:16:51.160 --> 1:17:02.160
 The idea that, and I want to say this in a number of different registers, I want to say, first of all, we need to make peace with the fact that that's who we are and that's where we are.

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:16.160
 So, nobody is coming. The world court is not going to litigate our disputes. The United Nations is not going to set up a desk for people of African descent who reside in North America.

1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:26.160
 We have to work out whatever our concerns are with our fellow Americans right here within the context of American politics. That means compromise.

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:37.160
 That means looking for frame, a framework for political expression, which is broader than our racial identity, etc. So I want to say that.

1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:46.160
 But I also want to say there's no reason to apologize for this. There's something positive to affirm. I take on this question about slavery in, in brief, in brief.

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:59.160
 Because in fact, slavery was awful and it was wrong and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans and it had consequences that endured, that have endured long after the termination of the thing.

1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:18.160
 But I also want to say, look at what has happened in the last 150 years for African Americans. And I want to say, look at the vitality of the institutions here in the United States of America, of the Democratic Republic of the United States of America.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:32.160
 Again, not perfect, which are, which are malleable enough, these institutions to allow for the transformation of the status of African Americans such as has occurred since the end of slavery.

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:38.160
 And I want to say there's a lot to celebrate in that. So this is our country.

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:52.160
 We are full members of the polity. We have burdens and responsibilities, as well as privileges that are associated with our membership in this Republic.

1:18:52.160 --> 1:19:01.160
 That does not mean that we should not fight for what we believe to be right, although we are not one voice here, we black Americans.

1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:17.160
 It does not mean that we should not protest things that we think are deserving of protest. But I want to say, it does mean that we should not reject the framework that we're operating in because we basically don't have any alternative.

1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:38.160
 And because when viewed in full context, a noble and profoundly significant achievement, the United States of America, and a beacon to the rest of the world, I don't want to, you know, go off in some starry eyed kind of jingoistic celebration of America as the greatest civilization, etc, etc.

1:19:38.160 --> 1:20:00.160
 But this great nation is our nation. And I think we do best by beginning, we black Americans do best by beginning, this is my argument in the piece, by beginning from a framework which accepts that fact and then builds on it.

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:16.160
 So black patriotism is not exactly the same. Rhymes echoes American patriotism. So a black American is first and foremost an American.

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:24.160
 Yeah. A black American is first and foremost an American. And it's a good thing, too.

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:37.160
 Let me return to the question of Dr. King and another powerful impact from individual Malcolm X to ask you the question.

1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:52.160
 Well, first, people often perhaps inaccurately portray them as representing two different ideals approaches to the fight for civil rights.

1:20:52.160 --> 1:21:03.160
 So Martin Luther King for the nonviolent approach, the peacemaker and Malcolm X is the by any means necessary.

1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:15.160
 What do you think about this distinction and broadly speaking in black patriotism in the future of black Americans in the 21st century, what is the role of anger?

1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:31.160
 What is the role of protests? Even violence encompasses a lot of things, but just aggression and the, you know, fuck the man, we're going to have to make change, force change.

1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:41.160
 Okay, I think you put your finger on something really important in the context of we were just discussing my black patriotism essay.

1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:55.160
 It's not the only, it's not the only story. There is another story and Malcolm X is someone you identify and his memory lives on and is powerfully influential.

1:21:55.160 --> 1:22:11.160
 And I think you see it in Black Lives Matter and I think you see it in the protest and rioting and so forth that has broken out periodically going all the way back to the 1960s and before but especially since the 1960s.

1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:33.160
 You saw it in Los Angeles in 1992, the Rodney King civil disturbances that broke out there. And the bald up fist, the radical, afro centric rejection of the American story that Martin Luther King he believed in he believed in a magnificent

1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:43.160
 promissory note. And a lot of people are rolling their eyes, you know, and saying, you know, as you say, fuck the man magnificent promissory note.

1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:57.160
 I mean, just get your knee off my neck. You can that's what you can do for me. Don't ask me to believe in your BS about some magnificent promissory note some founding fathers who were all slave owners anyway, I mean just get your knee off my neck.

1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:09.160
 Now, I can relate to that. As I mentioned, I grew up in Chicago in the 1950s and the 1960s. I remember Malcolm X. I mean, literally in real time.

1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:21.160
 I remember when he was murdered in 1965 in the Audubon ballroom in Harlem in Manhattan in New York City.

1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:40.160
 I remember my uncle, I was raised in a house where my aunt and uncle were the master of the house and my mother and my sister and I lived in a small apartment upstairs in the back of this of this big house that my successful aunt and uncle owned.

1:23:40.160 --> 1:24:01.160
 And my uncle was a small businessman, a barber and a tradesman. He was he was a hustler. I mean, legally, I mean, he did what he had to do to make money. He was very enterprising, not especially well educated, but a very intelligent and disciplined and resourceful provider for his family,

1:24:01.160 --> 1:24:14.160
 which included myself, my sister and my mother in their household. And we called him Uncle Mooney because he had moon shaped eyes that protruded and were round Uncle Mooney.

1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:26.160
 James Ellis was his name Uncle Mooney. James Ellis Lee was my uncle Mooney. But I'm saying all that to say this. He admired the nation of Islam.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:34.160
 I mean, King and Malcolm X, Martin King and Malcolm X differed along a number of different dimensions. Malcolm X was a Muslim.

1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.160
 And Martin Luther King, Jr. was a Christian minister.

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:56.160
 My uncle Mooney didn't have any time for these Christian ministers. He thought that was the white man's religion. He, you know, and back in that day, you go into a black church and you'd see a portrait of Jesus. And he'd be a blonde hair blue wide.

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:08.160
 He didn't even look like a Mediterranean. I mean, he didn't look like somebody who came from Palestine. I mean, he looked like somebody who came from Northern Europe or something like that. The picture of Jesus.

1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:19.160
 And my uncle Mooney rejected that whole thing. He would be damned if he was going to bend his knee to some white Jesus. But he was not a Muslim either.

1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:40.160
 But he respected the Muslims. He brought home their newspaper. It was called Mohammed Speaks. This is the nation of Islam, which is the black Muslim movement founded in American cities in Detroit and then Chicago, going back to the early middle 20th century,

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:59.160
 and growing into a very significant movement that had a lot of influence. Louis Farrakhan, a controversial figure, descends from this movement. It has fractured now and has the major part of the legacy of the black Muslims.

1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:18.160
 It has assimilated itself into Islam proper. Malcolm X made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and came back with a very different vision about what it meant to be a Muslim and understood himself to be a part of the large tradition and religious

1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:35.160
 culture of Islam that has a global reach. And he had a different vision when he came back from that. Some people say that's why he was killed and so on. I don't know. I certainly find that to be plausible that he became the constitutive threat to the sect, which was the

1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:55.160
 the black Muslims and had to be dealt with. I don't know if we'll ever know the full story on that. But anyway, what I'm trying to say is the black Muslims were there. Malcolm X was there. And in my experience, they constituted a counterpoint to the position of

1:26:55.160 --> 1:27:14.160
 the king, which depended on a kind of respect for the best of the tradition of American democracy, appealing to the better nature of our oppressors, live up to the full meaning of our creed.

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:31.160
 These are words that he would use. A magnificent promissory note is what he would think of as the Declaration of Independence and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, an unfulfilled ideal. And the black Muslims were like, fuck that.

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:46.160
 We're going to take care of our own. We're going to build our own schools. We're going to build our own businesses. We're not waiting for the white man to do anything. Get your knee off my neck and get out of my way and let me take care of my own.

1:27:46.160 --> 1:28:02.160
 And my uncle respected that. He respected the straight back, the stand up straight with your shoulders back. That's a Jordan Peterson. But I mean, that was the way before Jordan Peterson, but that was his philosophy. Stand up straight with your, raise your children. Don't be depending upon welfare.

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:17.160
 You're taking welfare from the white man. You need to get busy. You need to educate yourself. You need to clean up your act. Put down the fried chicken because it's going to kill you. My uncle Mooney loved this book that Elijah Muhammad.

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:32.160
 They called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad. He was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam. He had a book and all the books said was be smart, eat green vegetables, don't eat fried food, don't eat pork.

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:43.160
 They're Muslims. Don't eat pork and take responsibility for your diet and be healthy. And, you know, don't be putting a whole lot of pills into your body.

1:28:43.160 --> 1:29:03.160
 You don't need to do that if you just get control of your diet and you eat properly. And my uncle loved this idea of responsibility for self and determination to build, you know, he respected that in the Muslims, even if he didn't buy the religious part of it.

1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:26.160
 And so, and by the way, when my uncle died in 1983, he left me a bequest. It wasn't money, unfortunately. It was his complete collection of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.

1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:38.160
 And I have, I have these albums. These are 33 and a third LPs. There's six of them. And I have a complete collection as best as my uncle could assemble the recorded speeches of Malcolm X. Now, why did he do that?

1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:51.160
 He did that because he did not want me to forget. Don't be dependent upon the white man. Build your own stand up straight with your shoulders back. Proud black man, take care of your business.

1:29:51.160 --> 1:30:02.160
 Take care of your children. Pick up the trash in front of your house. Get busy. This was this philosophy.

1:30:02.160 --> 1:30:24.160
 So violence now. That's another story. I mean, Malcolm X would say, you know, we're going to defend ourselves. Are you going to mess with us? You know, you racist, Ku Klux Klan or whatever. We're going to arm ourselves. And we're going to fight you back. You racist police who are oppressing and persecuting and abusing our people.

1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:41.160
 Well, you better be ready because we're going to fight you back. And that too was the spirit that my uncle, that was a kind of attitude, a kind of posture. My uncle was not a radical. He was, he was a businessman, but he respected this idea.

1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:48.160
 You take your life in your own hands when you mess with us because we're prepared to defend ourselves.

1:30:48.160 --> 1:31:05.160
 So that blood runs in you too. That threat is when you write about black patriotism, that threat is there too. It's like you embody both the ideal that we're all American, but also that there is this oppressive history.

1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:28.160
 There is the powerful that are manipulating you, that are oppressing you, and you can't just wait around for things to fix themselves. You have to take action. You have to take things into your own hands. And sometimes that means being angry. Sometimes that means being violent. That's there too.

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:46.160
 Yeah, it's there, but here in the bud is I don't meet today Glenn Lowry in 2022 think that that is the answer. I don't think that violent rebellion gets us anywhere at the end of the day.

1:31:46.160 --> 1:32:09.160
 I think we're past that there aren't Knight Rider Ku Klux Klan people breaking down your door and dragging you away. There are not nooses thrown over a tree limb where you hang somebody from the tree because they whistled at a white woman or they got too much property in your community and you became, you know, they were

1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:30.160
 uppity Negroes and whatnot like that that is a thing of the past in America that the situation is no longer the one that requires that kind of violent reaction and that there there is if we look at the net effect of the so called rebellions

1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:51.160
 in American cities, they're negative. The George Floyd protests which became violent and arsonists in the aftermath of civil disturbance and whatnot in the summer of 2020, I think set back the program for African Americans.

1:32:51.160 --> 1:33:12.160
 I think it advanced it. I think there are things to be concerned about schools that are not working police that are not not respecting citizens and so forth but I think that those are things that affect white Americans as well and that the way to ultimately correct

1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:38.160
 those things is to make alliance and associate oneself with Americans who are concerned to change these things and I don't think it's properly framed as a racial as a racial problem and I certainly don't think that, you know, violent rebellion gets us anywhere.

1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:55.160
 You know, I get the historical salience of that posture, and it made a lot of sense in the early in the mid 20th century. I don't think it makes very much sense at all in the early 21st century.

1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:13.160
 Well, thank you for allowing me for a brief moment to try to channel your uncle Mooney and maybe Malcolm X in this conversation as we as we look forward to the 21st century. You mentioned that in part you're troubled by the term African American.

1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:27.160
 So words are funny things until they're not. So let me ask you about what I think is one of the most powerful and controversial words in the English language, the N word.

1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:53.160
 So this is a word that I can't say that only certain people have the right to say. I have a friend Joe Rogan, who has, what would you say, there was mass pushback or highlighting of the fact that he didn't just say N word but said the full word many times throughout his conversations

1:34:53.160 --> 1:35:06.160
 when referring to in a meta way about the power of words, especially when related to certain comedians using those words.

1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:16.160
 Yeah, what do you think about this word? Is it empowering? Is it destructive?

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:35.160
 What is it? What does it mean for race in America? What does it mean that people like Joe Rogan were essentially there's an attack to cancel him for using the word just as a scholar of human nature? What do you think about this whole thing?

1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:47.160
 This is a phenomenon that interests me. The N word, nigger, I can say it because I'm black. But I mean I can also say it because I like hip hop.

1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:55.160
 And when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time, these niggaz ain't dead. You ain't watch out for these, etc.

1:35:55.160 --> 1:36:06.160
 I heard the word constantly as I was growing up as a boy and a young man in Chicago. Niggaz ain't shit. That was it.

1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:14.160
 And that could be a reflection of some kind of pathology within the African American community of self hatred and so forth.

1:36:14.160 --> 1:36:28.160
 It could be or it could just be a colloquial linguistic way. I mean, I assume other groups also have their various, I don't know how the Irish talk about their Irish brothers and whatever.

1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:40.160
 And I don't know how the Jews talk about the Jewish brothers and whatever. But black people when talking about other black people use the N word all the time.

1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:49.160
 My nigger, NIGGA, you know, my nigger, that is a term of endearment.

1:36:49.160 --> 1:37:00.160
 My friend Randall Kennedy, the law professor at Harvard University has a book called Nigger and he uses the word in the title of the book.

1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:11.160
 The history of a strange history of a provocative word is something like there's a subtitle, but the title of the book is NIGGR colon.

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:15.160
 And then he has a subtitle.

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:32.160
 I think, of course, the use of the word as a slur and an insult, which is a part of the history of black people in the United States, the use of the word by the southern racist segregationist.

1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:38.160
 We don't want no niggaz up in here. Niggaz have no place in my restaurant in my store, etc.

1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:45.160
 That's meant to be an insult. It's an insult to people that's a fighting word. It's a way that you say that to somebody.

1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:49.160
 It's an invitation for conflict.

1:37:49.160 --> 1:38:04.160
 That said, what is it that about this particular word and also the asymmetry of it that do you think it's empowering to the black community to own a word?

1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:13.160
 My honest answer to you is I don't know. I don't fully understand it. It has become symbolic in a way and the policing of the use of the word.

1:38:13.160 --> 1:38:19.160
 I can say it, but white people can't say it. I can say it. I'm not a racist. I'm not a self hating black.

1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:29.160
 I'm just speaking the language of colloquial English that has emerged amongst African Americans in which that word plays a big role.

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:38.160
 But the prohibition on its use by others. And of course, in the Joe Rogan case, it wasn't as if he was calling anybody an inward.

1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:45.160
 He was simply pointing out that people had said stuff in which the inward was a part of what they said.

1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:54.160
 Now, he did make this statement about how did he put it, the planet of the apes that one of the offensive things that he said had, you know, he walked into a room.

1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:57.160
 There's a bunch of black guys standing around. He says, like, planet of the apes.

1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:00.160
 He said it's like Africa planet of the apes.

1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:03.160
 He should have been a little bit more careful.

1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:13.160
 That was an insult. That was, you know, something that, you know, if you say that and people are offended, they have a right to be offended.

1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:21.160
 And if you didn't mean to offend them, you can apologize. And he did apologize. I accept his apology. Joe's okay with me as far as that goes.

1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:29.160
 In fact, McWhorter and I, John McWhorter and I at the podcast that I do, the Glenn show, I had a conversation, part of which touched on the Joe Rogan phenomenon.

1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:38.160
 And we concluded he didn't really do anything wrong. I mean, I mean, you can like RML, you can hate him or whatever, but the idea that he's a racist is kind of ridiculous.

1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:50.160
 Frankly, I mean, Joe, you know, if that's your test of what constitutes a racist, the utterance of the word, then, you know, it's kind of a,

1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:53.160
 it's kind of silly as far as I'm concerned.

1:39:53.160 --> 1:40:00.160
 What do you think about the rigorous testing of people to the degree they're racist or not?

1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:10.160
 The accusation of racism being a way to attack, to bully, to divide.

1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:20.160
 So what are the pros and cons of that once again? Because it does reveal the assholes and the racists, but it can hurt people who are not.

1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:33.160
 Well, I think we have a history here in the United States of blatant racism that goes back a long way and that has present day echoes.

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:40.160
 So there are racists. I mean, there are people who will look and see all those black people, they're patronizing this business.

1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:42.160
 I don't want to patronize this business anymore.

1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:48.160
 Who, if the daughter of their son is dating somebody that is black, they will say, I really wish you wouldn't do that.

1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:52.160
 I mean, why are you hanging out with those people? Don't you know who they are?

1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.160
 There are people, there are racists. Okay.

1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:56.160
 There are black racists.

1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:11.160
 That is black people who see somebody who's white and who then invoke a whole lot of stereotypes or whatever or have a, you know, visceral dislike based upon nothing other than the color of the person's skin.

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:15.160
 Such people exist. Racism is a real thing, etc.

1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:25.160
 On the other hand, I think this throwing around, you know, the accusation of racism, a college professor is teaching a course.

1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:44.160
 He says, in the context of teaching the course, that the under representation of blacks in physics program at this university is because they scroll lower on the test than other groups, and they're not qualified.

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:54.160
 So say the professor gives a lecture, and he says, we don't have more blacks in the physics department at this university because they're not enough qualified blacks.

1:41:54.160 --> 1:42:03.160
 Somebody in the classroom who hears that a black student objects, he's a racist. Okay.

1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:05.160
 That's a power move.

1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:10.160
 It's a move to try to control the conversation.

1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:14.160
 It's not an argument. It's an epithet.

1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:25.160
 I said that a person who has a particular idea that you don't like, maybe that idea is I'm against affirmative action. I think it's unfair. I was just with Dorian Abbott.

1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:43.160
 Dorian Abbott is a scientist at the University of Chicago, who published a piece in Newsweek magazine, in which he said that he thought affirmative action and racial balancing was unethical.

1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:54.160
 He invited to give a lecture at MIT, a very distinguished lecture in his field based on planetary science. I don't know exactly what it is. I'm not a scientist.

1:42:54.160 --> 1:43:03.160
 But in any case, because he had said that he didn't like affirmative action and he thought affirmative action was racist, that's basically what he said.

1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:09.160
 Why are we looking at people based upon their race and decide we should just do it on the merit? That was his position.

1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:21.160
 Now, people protesting at the university where he was invited, MIT, saying that he's a racist because he had that opinion. He gets disinvited.

1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:41.160
 Charles Murray is a popular social science writer who is famous for his book about IQ, The Bell Curve, one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences between black and white in performance on mental ability tests

1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:50.160
 and speculates about the extent to which such differences may be connected with the genetic inheritance of these racially distinct populations.

1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:54.160
 Now, he could be wrong about everything that he's saying.

1:43:54.160 --> 1:44:12.160
 The Southern Poverty Law Center calls him a white supremacist because he observes that there are racial differences in measured intellectual ability amongst Americans of different racial descent.

1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:20.160
 He could be wrong. Let me stipulate that he is wrong. I mean, I don't want to argue about whether he's right or about whether he's wrong.

1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:35.160
 He's addressing himself to a factual issue and now the issue becomes, instead of grappling with the factual questions at hand and demonstrating his rightness or wrongness about those questions, the issue becomes his character.

1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:44.160
 He's a racist. That's in my mind a lot like calling him a witch.

1:44:44.160 --> 1:45:00.160
 The use of that word now, I think, has parallels to accusing people of witchcraft because they have views about substantive questions that bear on racial inequality or racial difference

1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:08.160
 that a person finds unacceptable or that a person disagrees with and you think you can shut somebody up.

1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:21.160
 Crime in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington DC is out of control, some person might say.

1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:24.160
 Murder rate is high. Who's committing those crimes?

1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:33.160
 They're mostly black young men who are doing the carjackings and who are doing the shootings. They're killing each other. They're making our city unlivable.

1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:44.160
 Now, that's a hypothetical statement that I offer. It might be correct. It might be incorrect. It might be appropriate. It might be inappropriate.

1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:52.160
 It may be true, but something that we would be better off if people didn't focus on. I don't know.

1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:58.160
 I'm responding to someone making that statement. Have you seen what has happened to my city?

1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:06.160
 It used to be that you could go to North Michigan Avenue and you could find one after another after another high end shop. This is in Chicago, my hometown.

1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:13.160
 And tourists would come and they'd go to the theater and there were restaurants and they'd go out. They don't do it anymore.

1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:16.160
 You know what? Half of those stores are boarded up now. You know why?

1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:25.160
 When George Floyd was killed, black people mobbed in the city and they burnt and they rioted and they looted and it hasn't been the same ever since.

1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:31.160
 And I'm moving to the suburbs. I'll be damned if I'm going to send my children to those schools. A person could say that.

1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:39.160
 They might be right. They might be wrong to say it. Calling them a racist isn't exactly not a rebuttal of what they said.

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:50.160
 It's a move. It's a move to try to take control of the conversation by accusing someone of having bad character because they said something that made you uncomfortable, which you can't deal with.

1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:55.160
 So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist. You might as well be calling them a witch.

1:46:55.160 --> 1:47:04.160
 You might as well be calling for their head on a platter because they believe that Satan is Lord because that's the kind of quote argument.

1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:12.160
 Close quote, which is precisely not an argument that people who invoke that term are using. And here's what I have to say about that.

1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:18.160
 It's a fool's errand to try to refute somebody by calling them a witch.

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:33.160
 Likewise, it's a fool's errand to try to rebut the contrary forces in American politics that are a reaction often to real things that are going on on the ground in black communities in the cities across this country

1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:39.160
 by calling people a racist. You may shut them up, but you won't change their minds.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.160
 And you know what? At the end of the day, they're going to go to the ballot box and they're going to vote.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:49.160
 They're going to pick up their store and they're going to move it to the other side of town or to another town altogether.

1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:55.160
 They're going to keep their children away from places where they think the influences are harmful to those children.

1:47:55.160 --> 1:48:02.160
 They may not even talk about it in public. You can believe that in private that they're talking about it with each other.

1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:11.160
 You had better find a more effective way of dealing with the conflicts in this country that fall along racial fault lines than calling people witches.

1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:23.160
 Which is what this, you know, anti racist, you're a racist because you think that the out of wed like birth rate amongst black Americans is seven babies out of 10 are born to a woman without a husband.

1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:29.160
 Their families are falling apart. Now, no one says that in public because they'd be called a racist if they said it in public.

1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:36.160
 But as a matter of fact, the families are falling apart. You didn't change that in the least by telling people to shut up about it.

1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:45.160
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan is called a racist in the 1960s. The late Senator, the New York Senator, who was a federal employee and an intellectual writing reports.

1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:49.160
 And he writes a report about the Negro family. He called it in those years.

1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:54.160
 If I use the word Negro, now they're going to call me a racist if I'm a white person. I can't even use the word Negro,

1:48:54.160 --> 1:49:06.160
 which is a historically legitimate reference to the descendants of the slaves in slave people, which we were as black Americans proud to use until yesterday.

1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:12.160
 So all of this linguistic policing is a sign of weakness.

1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:15.160
 It's false black power.

1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:21.160
 People will seed you the ground. Okay, you don't want me to use that word. I won't use that word anymore. Okay, you don't want me to talk about that in public.

1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:26.160
 All right, I won't talk about it in public anymore. I don't want to be called a racist. Okay, so I won't express my opinion.

1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:30.160
 You haven't changed anybody's mind.

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:31.160
 You know, so.

1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:46.160
 And you've also mentioned that for that, you haven't changed anybody's mind, but also for things like in universities and institutions, there's diversity, inclusion, and equity kind of meetings and education and so on.

1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:54.160
 And I believe I read somewhere I've been, like I mentioned to you offline, big fan of your Glenn show, people should listen to it.

1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:56.160
 It's amazing.

1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:59.160
 There's also just interviews of you that I've listened to.

1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:05.160
 I believe you mentioned somewhere that even those kinds of meetings, people might sit through and not along.

1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:11.160
 But that doesn't necessarily mean that's making progress that they may not.

1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:31.160
 They may actually be bottling up a frustration. That's the fear is that that's going to result in a pendulum pendulum sort of push back towards this idea of forced appreciation, like forced anti racism kind of thing.

1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:40.160
 I talk about this often in my pockets. That's the Glenn show, you know, and you can find the Glenn show, my YouTube channel and also at sub stack.

1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:46.160
 Yeah, you have a great sub stack. You're in your friend to Q&A's and all that kind of stuff on Patreon.

1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:47.160
 Yeah.

1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:49.160
 So yeah, so people should definitely follow you.

1:50:49.160 --> 1:50:51.160
 Check us out.

1:50:51.160 --> 1:51:07.160
 But yeah, I mean, one concern is that the policing of the superficial policing, this is a part of political correctness, you know, the insistence that you only use certain words that you only talk in a certain way is a phony kind of power because it doesn't

1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:15.160
 actually persuade people about the issues that are at hand. Instead, it forces them underground in their talk about these issues.

1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:30.160
 And that's problematic, much better that we have overt and explicit and honest disagreement to the extent that there are disagreement about things that are going on.

1:51:30.160 --> 1:51:51.160
 And then that we have a superficial kind of, you know, conversation that is perished of any real biting, you know, discomforting confrontation with with the realities of the situation at hand and for black Americans,

1:51:51.160 --> 1:52:04.160
 one big part of the reality of the situation at hand is violent crime, violent crime, you know, a police officer is afraid when he stops the car because it's an 18 year old driver in the vehicle.

1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:09.160
 He's got dreadlocks. He's a black person. The car doesn't have the right license plate.

1:52:09.160 --> 1:52:18.160
 He's afraid to deal with that person. And one of the reasons he's afraid to deal with them is because a few who look like him are behaving violently.

1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:23.160
 Their violence is usually perpetrated against others who look like themselves, but not always.

1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:36.160
 And that reality doesn't get changed by, you know, telling a newspaper writer who writes about it that they are racist or enforcing within a newsroom.

1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:58.160
 You can't cover that story in that way because to do so would be racist. I think it's a monumental mistake to enforce a closure on public discussion based upon a calculation that if we allow people with Twitter allows this kind of post.

1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:20.160
 If the Washington Post runs this kind of story, et cetera, you end up with a superficial politeness, but a subterranean seething resentment that only makes matters worse.

1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:30.160
 If I can get your comment, maybe you have ideas because it does seem that this kind of attack works.

1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:44.160
 Of being called a racist, being called maybe not sexist, but somebody, you know, like they were going through a Johnny Depp trial now, right?

1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:56.160
 It's a defamation trial and the reason it's a defamation trial is because all it took is a single accusation of Johnny Depp being somebody who sexually and physically abused Amber Heard.

1:53:56.160 --> 1:54:06.160
 And all it took is just a single article. No proof was given except the accusation itself and the world believed it.

1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:16.160
 So it's effective. So how do you fight back if it's so damn effective that you can just call anybody racist and it works?

1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:18.160
 It's hard to wash off.

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:36.160
 You know, you're not proven in the court of law or anything like that, but we get those articles, get that label, and then the world moves on and just assumes that person is racist.

1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:40.160
 So how do you, do you have any ideas how to fight back?

1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:42.160
 No, I don't frankly.

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:54.160
 Just highlight Roseanne Barr, who made this statement about Valerie Jarrett, she made some kind of ape like reference to the whatever and her show got canceled and she's a racist.

1:54:54.160 --> 1:55:02.160
 So first of all, pointing it out, I suppose is one of the most powerful things that this, the, the hypocrisy of it.

1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:08.160
 You say it works. I guess you're right. It used to be the calling someone a communist.

1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:18.160
 Yeah, work. I mean, going back to the late forties, early fifties, red scare, McCarthyism and whatnot.

1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:25.160
 And the person might have belonged to a club that was pro Soviet Union in the 1930s when they were in college.

1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:31.160
 They might have voted for the socialist candidate Henry Wallace in the presidential election of 1948.

1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.160
 They might belong to the Communist Party.

1:55:33.160 --> 1:55:39.160
 They might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot of stuff about capitalism and whatnot.

1:55:39.160 --> 1:55:46.160
 And they got called a communist or a Marxist and it could have ruined their career, could have ruined their lives.

1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:52.160
 You know, and a lot of people shut up about it and it took and it went on for a long time.

1:55:52.160 --> 1:56:04.160
 And in a way, in a way, it kind of still is going on. I mean, you call somebody a Marxist. If you can make that stick, they're certainly not going to get elected president of the United States.

1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:16.160
 But I don't know about this. I think, you know, I once read this book by a German political scientist called Elizabeth Neula Neumann.

1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:25.160
 That was the writer's name, Elizabeth Neula Neumann. The book was called The Spiral of Silence.

1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:38.160
 And the argument was there can be some views, some issues in society that get defined in such a way that it's inappropriate to hold those views.

1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:46.160
 And as a result, people who don't want to be shamed, who don't want to be ostracized, don't express those views.

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:54.160
 And when they don't express them, anybody holding the view because they don't hear it said by others, think that they're the only one or one of the few who hold the view.

1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:59.160
 And so they don't want to be the only one out there saying something. So they keep it to themselves.

1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:13.160
 So now this view, this attitude in society could be held by a large number of people. But because of the fear that if they were to express it, they'd be ostracized.

1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:23.160
 No one says it. And since no one is saying it, the others who hold the view don't know that they're not alone, that they are not the only ones who hold the view.

1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:31.160
 And hence they keep silent. That could be an equilibrium. It could be a relatively stable situation in which the emperor has no clothes.

1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:35.160
 Everybody can see that this dude is naked.

1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:47.160
 Okay, but everybody thinks that, you know, I don't want to be the only one to say it. And so we all kind of collaborate in this charade of keeping the view to ourselves.

1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:59.160
 Then along comes an event that somebody decides to defy the consensus and the speak out.

1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:07.160
 It could be a little kid who in the story about the emperor has no clothes doesn't realize that he's not supposed to say that the emperor is naked.

1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:13.160
 The thing about the kid in the story who says that the emperor is naked is not that he's saying it.

1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:21.160
 It's not even that other people hear him saying it. It's that everybody knows that everybody else heard him say it.

1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:31.160
 Okay, the kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes creates a circumstance in which it's common knowledge that the emperor has no clothes.

1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:41.160
 Now common knowledge does not just mean knowledge. It does not even mean widespread knowledge. It means comprehensive knowledge of other person's knowledge of the thing.

1:58:41.160 --> 1:58:59.160
 Okay, so the spiral of silence is an equilibrium that is susceptible to being undermined by a process of a kind of cumulative process, a snowballing process of revelation that you're not the only one who thinks this way.

1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:09.160
 Okay, it's fascinating to think that there's an ocean of common knowledge that we're waiting for the little kid to wake us up to different little parts of it.

1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:15.160
 That's correct. And the little kid, by the way, could be somebody like Donald Trump, only more effective than Donald Trump.

1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:21.160
 Somebody who is smarter than Donald Trump. Somebody who is shrewder than Donald Trump.

1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:29.160
 Somebody who figures out that when Colin Kaepernick takes a knee at a football game and says,

1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:39.160
 I'm not going to stand for this presidential allegiance that a vast number of people are very unhappy about that.

1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:50.160
 Somebody who understands that when a Black Lives Matter activist stands up with his ball fists and says burn this bitch down about a city in the United States of America.

1:59:50.160 --> 2:00:09.160
 A lot of people are upset about that. A lot of them. A person, a shrewd politician, a shrewd manager of a public image could build on and create a circumstance in which more and more people will feel safe to express that view.

2:00:09.160 --> 2:00:15.160
 And the more who express it, the safer those who have yet to express it, but who hold it will feel in expressing it.

2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:22.160
 To the extent that the view is very widespread, but is kept under wraps and explosion could happen.

2:00:22.160 --> 2:00:37.160
 And you can look up at tomorrow and have a very different country than you had today because the conspiracy of silence, the spiral of silence ends up getting unraveled by somebody who steps out away from the consensus,

2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:46.160
 and dares to take the slings and arrows of exposing themselves as a naysayer, but taps into a sentiment that's very widespread.

2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:57.160
 And I fear that with respect to many racial issues, this is the situation that we actually confront, that it could unravel in a very ugly way.

2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:16.160
 But it could also unravel in a beautiful way, so it's depending. There is a spiral of silence you're saying, and it could be, because speaking of children, charismatic children, there's a guy named Elon Musk who might be a candidate for such an unraveling.

2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:28.160
 Right, you mentioned the person that speaks out could be Donald Trump, but in this current situation that we live in like as this week, Elon has purchased Twitter.

2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:29.160
 That's what I hear.

2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:49.160
 And is pushing for, in all kinds of ways, the increase of free speech on Twitter, and speaking about some of the issues that we've been speaking about here with you, but maybe in broader strokes about just the fact that you have to,

2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:59.160
 it's okay to point out that the emperor wears an old clothes and to do so from all sides in a way that everybody's a little bit pissed off, but not too much.

2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:05.160
 What do you think about this whole effort of free speech in these public platforms?

2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:18.160
 Elon in particular, Twitter, your avid Twitter user, but just public platforms for discourse for us as a civilization to figure stuff out.

2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:36.160
 Yeah, well, the people on the left are very upset about the possibility that Elon Musk and Twitter will be open to more open to provocative public speech that has here to fore been banned or suppressed.

2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:42.160
 And I think they might be right to be concerned that that could happen.

2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:50.160
 I don't know enough about the technology and about the market to really social media and whatnot.

2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:58.160
 It seems like it's a complicated system of interactions between people and who the users are and so forth and so on.

2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:14.160
 I do know that that New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop was real news and could have affected the outcome of the election and it was suppressed and that Twitter had a role in suppressing it.

2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:32.160
 I do know that the question of where the COVID 19 virus originated in the role that a lab leak account could have played in the public processing of that event was real news and that it was suppressed by people who were trying to control misinformation,

2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:38.160
 disinformation, Russian disinformation campaigns and whatnot.

2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:54.160
 So Twitter has users I'm one of them and it has a lot of users it's not as big as Facebook I gather it's not, but it's important the ability to construct counter platforms, people moving around and whatnot.

2:03:54.160 --> 2:04:00.160
 It's a kind of network dynamic that maybe I should understand it better than I do being a social scientist but

2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:12.160
 I don't think anyone understands it even people include inside Twitter, which is fascinating. It's a monster because of just the bandwidth messaging and you don't know who is a bot and who is a human.

2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:31.160
 That's a fascinating dynamic and the viral nature of negativity that all of those dynamics of course you are probably the right person to understand it from a social scientist perspective from an economics perspective, but nobody really understands.

2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:43.160
 And it's fascinating within that domain. How do you allow for free speech not allow for free speech encourage free speech defend free speech.

2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:56.160
 And at the same time, manage millions of ongoing conversations from just becoming in insanely chaotic.

2:04:56.160 --> 2:05:05.160
 Sort of from a from Twitter perspective they want people to be happy to grow to actually have difficult critical conversations.

2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:18.160
 And they, you know, the problem with humans is they think they know what that is, and they think they can label things as misinformation as as counterproductive for healthy conversations in quotes.

2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:27.160
 And the problem is, as we are learning humans are not able to do that effectively. First of all, power corrupts.

2:05:27.160 --> 2:05:37.160
 There's something delicious about having the power to label something as misinformation. You do that once for something that might be obviously misinformation.

2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:48.160
 And then you start getting greedy. You start getting excited. It feels good. It feels good to label something as misinformation and disinformation that you just don't like.

2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:58.160
 And over time, especially if there's a culture inside of a company that leans a certain political direction or leans in all the groups that we talked about leans a certain way.

2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:07.160
 They'll start to labels misinformation, things they just don't like. And there's that power is delicious and it corrupts.

2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:17.160
 You have to construct mechanisms like the founding fathers did for somehow preventing you from allowing that power to get too delicious.

2:06:17.160 --> 2:06:19.160
 At least that's my perspective on what's going on.

2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:28.160
 Well, I'll just tell you personally, I'm excited about the prospect. I'm glad to see Musk making the move that he's making and we'll see what happens at Twitter and so forth.

2:06:28.160 --> 2:06:42.160
 You're looking forward for the, what did he say? Let's make Twitter more fun. I'm looking forward to the fun. You've talked about you are at a prestigious university.

2:06:42.160 --> 2:06:44.160
 Brown University.

2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:59.160
 And you've mentioned that universities might be in trouble. I think it's with Jordan, but everywhere else that barbarians are at the gate or the barbarians at the gate of the university.

2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:11.160
 So first of all, what is to you beautiful about the ideal of the university in America of academia? And what is at threat?

2:07:11.160 --> 2:07:36.160
 Well, you know, a university is dedicated to the pursuit of truth and to the education and nurturing of young people as they enter into the pursuit of truth to doing research and to teaching in a environment of free inquiry and civil discourse.

2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:51.160
 So free inquiry means you go wherever the evidence and your imagination may lead you and civil discourse means that you exchange arguments with people when you don't agree with them on behalf of trying to get to the bottom of things.

2:07:51.160 --> 2:08:10.160
 I think the university is a magnificent institution. It is a relatively modern institution. I mean, last 500 years or so. I mean, there are universities that are older than that, but the great research universities of the world, and not only here in the United States,

2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:27.160
 are places where human ingenuity is nurtured, where new lot knowledge is created, and where young people are equipped to answer questions that are open questions about our existence in the world that we live in.

2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:48.160
 You can trace to the university much if not most of the advances in technology and resourcefulness and our understanding of the origins of the species of the nature of the universe, cosmology, et cetera, science of the pursuit of humanistic understanding, the nurturing of traditions of inquisive.

2:08:48.160 --> 2:09:06.160
 So that's the university. Barbarians at the gates. The people who are trying to shut down open inquiry at the university on behalf of their particular view about things are a threat to what the university stands for, and they should be resisted.

2:09:06.160 --> 2:09:23.160
 So if I'm inquiring about the nature of human intelligence, and I want to study differences between human populations and their acquisition of or their expression of cognitive ability, that's fair game.

2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:38.160
 It's an open question. If I want to know something about the nature of gender affiliation identity and gender dysphoria and whatnot, that's fair game to study in the university. You can't shut that down.

2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:50.160
 You shouldn't be able to by saying, I have a particular position here. I'm a member of a particular identity group. Suppose I want to study the history of colonialism.

2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:58.160
 And there's a narrative on the progressive side, which is colonialism is about Europeans dominating and stealing or whatever, whatever.

2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:11.160
 And I happen to think, well, there's another aspect to the story about colonialism to which is that it's a mechanism for the diffusion of the best in human civilization to populations that were significantly lagging behind with respect to that.

2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:22.160
 And they brought literacy to the southern hemispheric populations that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing. It's complicated. I'm not taking that position, by the way.

2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:35.160
 I'm just saying somebody at a university should be able to take it up and pursue it and engage in argument with people about it. I'm talking about race and ethnicity, but this extends to a wide range of things.

2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:46.160
 I'm talking about climate. And one person says the earth is endangered because carbon in global warming, etc., etc. And another person says, no, wait, no, wait.

2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:54.160
 Look at where we stand in the 21st century. We're vastly richer than our ancestors just 250 years ago. We have much more knowledge about that and so forth and so on.

2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:09.160
 For 250 years from now, human ingenuity will have devised in ways that we cannot even begin to anticipate all manner of technological means for managing the problem.

2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:27.160
 There's no reason that we should shut down industrial civilization today because we fear the consequences of it when, in fact, we are vastly richer than our ancestors and those who come out two centuries after us will be vastly more effective at dealing with problems than we are now.

2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:44.160
 I'm not actually making that argument. I'm just saying the tendency to try to say, oh, no, that person is a climate denier. They can't pursue that area of inquiry is against the spirit of the university.

2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:56.160
 I think the barbarians at the gates has to do with the people who think they know what the right side of history is and try to make the university stand on the right side of history.

2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:07.160
 My position is you don't know what the right side of history is. And the purpose of a university is to equip you to be able to think about what is the right side of history.

2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:18.160
 What is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us as human beings living on this planet with the billions that we are in the condition that we are.

2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:31.160
 So the identitarians, the ones who want to make the university kowtow to their particular understandings about their own identity.

2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:40.160
 We now have at Brown University and various other places. We don't do Columbus Day anymore. We do Indigenous People's Day.

2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:48.160
 When that day comes up in October, we don't talk about Columbus. They're taking down statues of Columbus all across the country and so forth and so on.

2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:57.160
 I'm not arguing anything here other than that the latter day position,

2:12:57.160 --> 2:13:11.160
 BIPOCS, Black, Indigenous and other people of cover, the latter day position that the university has to reflect a particular sensibility about these identity questions.

2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:14.160
 I think it's a threat to the integrity of the enterprise.

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:25.160
 I don't think you're overstating it. I tend to be just for my limited knowledge of MIT, but perhaps it applies broadly.

2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:33.160
 I think the beauty of the university, broadly speaking, is the faculty and the students,

2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:46.160
 and the problem arises from the overreach of an overgrowing administration

2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:56.160
 that gives, again, things that it knows enough to make rules and conclusions based on a set of beliefs,

2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:07.160
 and then based on that empowers a certain small selection of students to be the sort of voices of activism, of a particular idea.

2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:14.160
 And not, I think, activism is beautiful, but not just activism, but anybody that disagrees is shut down.

2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:20.160
 And that, I think, the blame lies with the administration.

2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:27.160
 So I think the solution is in lessening, just like the solution with too big of a government, too big of a bureaucracy,

2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:34.160
 is there needs to be a redistribution of power to what makes universities beautiful,

2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:42.160
 which is the old students and the young students, old students being professors.

2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:51.160
 So the scholars, the curious minds, the people that are in this whole thing to explore the world, to be curious about it,

2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:57.160
 on a salary that's probably way too low for the thing they're doing, that's the whole point.

2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:05.160
 And then the administration just gets in the way and is the source of this kind of...

2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:12.160
 I would say in your beautiful phrasing, I would say the administration is the barbarians at the gate.

2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:16.160
 So the solution is smaller bureaucracy, smaller administrations.

2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:25.160
 I have to, on this point, you had this conversation, you put on your self stack with Jordan Peterson about cognitive inequality.

2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:29.160
 I think it's titled, Wrestling with Cognitive Inequality.

2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:40.160
 This particular topic of just IQ differences between groups, why is this so dangerous to talk about?

2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:42.160
 Why this particular topic?

2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:47.160
 Well, it's like you're calling black people inferior. It's like you're saying they're genetically inferior.

2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:56.160
 That's what people are saying. It's like you're rationalizing the disparity of outcomes by reference to the intrinsic inferiority of black people.

2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:03.160
 If you say cognitive ability matters for social outcomes, if you say cognitive ability exists,

2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:07.160
 people really are different in terms of their intellectual functioning.

2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:15.160
 And if you say cognitive ability differences are substantial between racially defined populations,

2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:19.160
 the sum of that, there is cognitive ability, it matters, and the difference by race,

2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:28.160
 is the conclusion that outcome differences by race are in part due to natural differences between the populations.

2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:32.160
 People find that to be completely offensive and unacceptable.

2:16:32.160 --> 2:16:35.160
 So that's what I think is going on.

2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:41.160
 Can you still man that case that we should be careful doing that kind of research?

2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:53.160
 So this has to do with research. It's like the Nazis used Nietzsche in their propaganda.

2:16:53.160 --> 2:17:04.160
 White supremacists could use conclusions, cherry pick conclusions of studies to push their agenda.

2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:07.160
 Can you still man the case that we should be careful?

2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:11.160
 I can do it at three levels. One is what do we mean by cognitive ability?

2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:15.160
 So there's many different kinds of intelligence a person might say.

2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:24.160
 How good are IQ tests at measuring other kinds of human capacities that are pertinent to success in life,

2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:27.160
 like temperament, like emotional intelligence, and so on.

2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:32.160
 So intelligence is not a one dimensional thing measured by G.

2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:41.160
 The cognitive psychologists talk about G, the general intelligence factor, which is a statistical construction.

2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:49.160
 It's a factor analytic resolution of the correlation across individuals in their performance on a battery,

2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:56.160
 a different kind of test, and they use that to define a general factor of intelligence.

2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:04.160
 A person could say that is a very narrow view of what human mental capacities actually are,

2:18:04.160 --> 2:18:12.160
 and that it's much better to think about multi dimensional measures of human mental functioning

2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:20.160
 rather than a single cognitive ability measure, a so called IQ, which is a narrow construction

2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:28.160
 that doesn't capture all of the subtle nuance of human difference in functioning.

2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:34.160
 Functioning is not just the ability to recite backwards a sequence of numbers.

2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:39.160
 I say eight, seven, nine, five, three, two, you say two, three, five, seven, eight, nine.

2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:48.160
 It's not just that intelligence is a complex management of many different dimensions

2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:54.160
 of human performance, including things like being able to stick with a task

2:18:54.160 --> 2:19:00.160
 and not give up things like being able to discipline and control your impulses

2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:03.160
 so as to remain focused and so forth.

2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:04.160
 That could be one dimension.

2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:10.160
 I could start by questioning the very foundation of the argument for racial differences

2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:18.160
 in cognitive ability by saying that your measure of cognitive ability is flawed.

2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:20.160
 I could go to a higher level.

2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:27.160
 I could say what we're really interested in is social outcomes and the question of

2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:34.160
 what factors influence social outcomes extends well beyond mental ability to many other things.

2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:40.160
 Here's an example, visual acuity.

2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:42.160
 How well do you see?

2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:43.160
 You're not wearing glasses.

2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:45.160
 I am.

2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:49.160
 Visual acuity varies between human beings.

2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:52.160
 Some people see better than other people do.

2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:54.160
 Visual acuity can be measured.

2:19:54.160 --> 2:20:00.160
 I can put you at the chart and you can identify and read that bottom line in small print or not.

2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:03.160
 So we can measure visual acuity and it varies between human beings.

2:20:03.160 --> 2:20:07.160
 Visual acuity is partly genetic.

2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:09.160
 I think that's undoubtedly true.

2:20:09.160 --> 2:20:15.160
 We inherit genes that influence whether or not we are near sighted or far sighted or astigmatic or whatever.

2:20:15.160 --> 2:20:23.160
 So visual acuity differs between people and can be measured and is under genetic control.

2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:29.160
 On the other hand, corrective lenses allow for us to level the playing field between people

2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:33.160
 who are differently endowed in terms of visual acuity.

2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:41.160
 Likewise, social outcomes are what we're really interested in, employment, earnings, whether or not they're law abiding.

2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:45.160
 How do they conduct themselves and their families and so forth amongst individuals?

2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:49.160
 Yes, social outcomes are influenced by so called cognitive ability,

2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:52.160
 but they're influenced by many other things as well.

2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:58.160
 If there are interventions that can be undertaken in society that level the playing field

2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:02.160
 between people who have different natural endowments of cognitive ability,

2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.160
 the fact that people or groups differ in cognitive ability becomes less significant.

2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:12.160
 Just like it's less significant that people differ with respect to how well they see

2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:17.160
 when corrective lenses allow for the leveling of that playing field.

2:21:17.160 --> 2:21:22.160
 There are in fact interventions, educational interventions, early childhood interventions

2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:27.160
 that have been shown to level the playing field to create better life outcomes for people

2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:31.160
 even if they happen to be in doubt with low intelligence.

2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:38.160
 A second level of arguing against this whole program of research on human differences in intelligence

2:21:38.160 --> 2:21:44.160
 is to observe that yes, human beings and perhaps racially defined groups may differ on the average

2:21:44.160 --> 2:21:50.160
 in intellectual endowment, but there well may be social interventions that level the playing field,

2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:56.160
 whether it's in education or in other kinds of programmatic interventions, especially for the poor.

2:21:56.160 --> 2:22:01.160
 A final level of argument is the one that you alluded to which is that if you talk like this,

2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:09.160
 you're going to encourage a kind of politics which is very ugly and it's best to frame the discussion

2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:16.160
 in ways that don't put emphasis on racially defined natural differences between populations.

2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:23.160
 That's an argument that I am myself personally conflicted about.

2:22:23.160 --> 2:22:31.160
 On the one hand, I think those people are just stupid. It is racist.

2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:37.160
 On the other hand, I think the calculation, we shouldn't do this kind of research.

2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:42.160
 Suppose I'm at the National Science Foundation. Research team submits a proposal.

2:22:42.160 --> 2:22:44.160
 The proposal proposes to undertake a study.

2:22:44.160 --> 2:22:52.160
 The study would explore the extent to which people and racial groups differ with respect to their intellectual performance

2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:56.160
 and how that's influenced by their genetic and environmental interaction.

2:22:56.160 --> 2:23:04.160
 I decide not to fund the study based on a political calculation that the subject is too sensitive.

2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:08.160
 If you explore that subject, you might get the wrong answer.

2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:12.160
 If you get the wrong answer, the white supremacist will be encouraged.

2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:19.160
 That is presuming before the research is done that I know the outcome of the research

2:23:19.160 --> 2:23:25.160
 and that I can calculate what the political consequence of the research outcome is going to be.

2:23:25.160 --> 2:23:29.160
 That's assuming the thing before you even know what the thing actually is.

2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:35.160
 It's a kind of omniscience. It presumes that you as the master of the universe

2:23:35.160 --> 2:23:39.160
 can tell people what it is that people are being treated like children.

2:23:39.160 --> 2:23:44.160
 What it is that they're capable of knowing and what it is that they're not capable of knowing.

2:23:44.160 --> 2:23:50.160
 It would be like someone saying to Einstein, I don't know about that special relativity theory.

2:23:50.160 --> 2:23:54.160
 It could well lead to the development of technologies that would allow nuclear weapons.

2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:59.160
 There's someone saying that Oppenheimer, who is a physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project

2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:04.160
 where the US developed the nuclear weapons capacity, don't carry out that project

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:10.160
 because the results of acquiring that knowledge may be more than we can deal with.

2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:19.160
 There's someone saying to someone doing biomedical research who's interested in exploring the nature of the human genome.

2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:26.160
 Don't carry out that experiment, that cloning undertaking, whatever, because the consequences could be deleterious.

2:24:26.160 --> 2:24:30.160
 Well, the consequences could be deleterious. The consequences could also be the cure of cancer.

2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:36.160
 The consequences could also be being able to generate electric power without producing carbon effluent.

2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:44.160
 So, who are you to tell me who you being the person in the political position to control the research?

2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:46.160
 What the consequence of doing the research is?

2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:56.160
 I think I don't want to cede that kind of power to politicians over the course of human inquiry.

2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:10.160
 So, yes, I would want there to be regulations governing the use of biologically sensitive and potentially dangerous pathogens in a lab in Wuhan or any place else.

2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:13.160
 I would not want to simply leave that to laissez faire.

2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:29.160
 On the other hand, I think that the tendency to try to shut down inquiry on behalf of supposed adverse political consequences is the role to ignorance and impoverishment at the end of the day for humankind,

2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:33.160
 denying ourselves the potential benefits of that kind of inquiry.

2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:37.160
 I think we need to take our chances with inquiry rather than to try to control it.

2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:42.160
 And I feel that way about the exploration of human intelligence as much as anything else.

2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:50.160
 So, you've asked me to steel man the case against research on IQ of the sort that Charles Murray is famous for popularizing.

2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:57.160
 And I've said, A, your measure of intelligence is single dimensional and it ought to be multi dimensional.

2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:05.160
 I've said B, the consequences of people's differing in intelligence depends not only on the natural endowments of the people,

2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:14.160
 but also on the environment and the potential for intervening in that environment, environment through one or another kind of instrument,

2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:24.160
 as the metaphorical example of the use of corrective lenses to level the playing field between people with different visual acuity indicates.

2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:37.160
 But finally, I've said, yes, research on racial differences in IQ can foster political beliefs that we would regard to be noxious.

2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:48.160
 On the other hand, to presume that what we don't know yet and might find out from the research is going to be harmful is to assume a kind of presumption

2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:55.160
 or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be, which we ought to be very slow to embrace.

2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:59.160
 Because if we had done so in the past, we wouldn't have nuclear power.

2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:01.160
 There's a lot of things that we wouldn't know.

2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:07.160
 I mean, what were people saying about Darwin and exploration of the evolution and origin of the species?

2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:17.160
 They were afraid that it was going to, in effect, disprove the religious based accounts of, you know, what were they saying about Copernicus and etc.

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:19.160
 So, you know...

2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:26.160
 That was a masterful layering of, quote, wrestling with the cognitive inequality.

2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:36.160
 You dragged in nuclear research, Copernicus, Darwin, biomedical research with genetics, even COVID and the lab leak.

2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:39.160
 I mean, that was just fun to listen to.

2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:44.160
 Okay. Let me ask you about your politics.

2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:48.160
 So, you recently said that you're a conservative leaning.

2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:50.160
 Maybe that's a day to day thing.

2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:52.160
 Maybe you can push back.

2:27:52.160 --> 2:28:01.160
 So, you have somebody like your friend, John McWhorter, who we could say is on your left to the left of you.

2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:09.160
 And then you have somebody like Thomas Sowell, who maybe is on to the right of you.

2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:10.160
 Yeah, probably.

2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:13.160
 And yet there's a lot of overlap between the three of you.

2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:14.160
 Right.

2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:28.160
 So, to what degree does politics affect your view on race in America and maybe to what degree does your view on race affect your politics?

2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:29.160
 Okay.

2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:33.160
 And that, for people who don't know, has shifted over time.

2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:40.160
 You've been on quite a roller coaster as anybody who thinks about the world should be.

2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:52.160
 Well, let's begin with the fact that I was trained as an economist in a tradition of what many people would call neoliberalism.

2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:59.160
 I was trained at MIT, which was not a right wing place by any means.

2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:12.160
 But it was a place where you learned about markets and about the benefits of capitalism as a way of organizing society.

2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:15.160
 The virtues of free enterprise.

2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:24.160
 The fact that the pursuit of profit was not necessarily a bad thing, but it well might be the road to prosperity and to economic growth.

2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:35.160
 The idea that private property and individuals seeking to acquire and succeeding in acquiring wealth did create inequality, but it also created opportunity.

2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:44.160
 And it also expanded our knowledge and our control over the physical environment in which we're embedded in, et cetera.

2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:48.160
 So we were not Marxist at MIT, although we did read Marx.

2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:51.160
 I mean, those of us who were intellectually curious, you read Marx.

2:29:51.160 --> 2:29:54.160
 It was an important figure in the history of the West.

2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:59.160
 And I think Marx should be read in capital three volumes, et cetera.

2:29:59.160 --> 2:30:02.160
 Alienation of labor and whatnot.

2:30:02.160 --> 2:30:09.160
 The implications of modernization of the advent of industrial capitalism, et cetera.

2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:16.160
 That kind of dynamic deserves to be studied and to come at it in a critical way.

2:30:16.160 --> 2:30:21.160
 Informed by the intellectual inheritance of Marx and Marxism.

2:30:21.160 --> 2:30:32.160
 I think that's a part of a full education in social philosophy and economic analysis that open minded person ought to acquaint themselves with.

2:30:32.160 --> 2:30:41.160
 But at the end of the day, I think that the free marketeers have the better of it.

2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:48.160
 I think the story of the 20th century, as far as economic development is concerned, reflects that.

2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:57.160
 I think that the experiments where centralized control over economic decisions was the order of the day failed.

2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:07.160
 I think that the fact of the 21st century rise of China as a force has a lot to do with the spread of, in effect,

2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:15.160
 socialist oriented modes of economic exchange, freeing up prices, markets, property, and so forth.

2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:19.160
 Although, obviously, it's a complicated political economic system.

2:31:19.160 --> 2:31:21.160
 I'm talking about China.

2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:36.160
 But I think that the story of the 20th century and the hope for the 21st century is that prosperity is enhanced through the free exchange of goods

2:31:36.160 --> 2:31:47.160
 and the pursuit and acquisition of property by people in a more or less capitalist oriented system.

2:31:47.160 --> 2:31:50.160
 That's the view that I hold.

2:31:50.160 --> 2:31:52.160
 I guess that makes me a conservative. I don't know.

2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:58.160
 I want to say that's not to the exclusion of a social safety net.

2:31:58.160 --> 2:32:07.160
 I'm not saying that old people in an ideal social system would be left to their own devices, regardless of whether or not they had saved for their retirement.

2:32:07.160 --> 2:32:18.160
 I'm not saying that the ideal of extending decent access to health care to all people, regardless of whether or not they can afford it,

2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:25.160
 decent access to education to people, regardless of whether or not they can afford it, is standing in the way of prosperity.

2:32:25.160 --> 2:32:27.160
 I don't believe that.

2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:40.160
 I think the mixed economies that we see in Northern Europe and in North America are a balancing of the virtues of free enterprise property and the pursuit of wealth on the one hand,

2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:51.160
 against the needs to have a decent society in which people who fall between the cracks nevertheless are bolstered through a sense of social solidarity

2:32:51.160 --> 2:32:59.160
 that is accommodated by our common membership within a single nation state, which is why I think nationalism is important.

2:32:59.160 --> 2:33:17.160
 It's why I think borders are important because without a coherent polity who can see themselves as in a common situation and agree through their politics to support each other to some extent,

2:33:17.160 --> 2:33:23.160
 you can't sustain a safety net, you cannot have a social safety net for a global population.

2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:33.160
 You can only have a social safety net for a bounded population who have a sense of common membership in an ongoing political enterprise,

2:33:33.160 --> 2:33:37.160
 which they pay their dues through their taxes in order to sustain it.

2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:39.160
 There's a balancing that has to go on.

2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:42.160
 So that's the first thing that I would say about my politics.

2:33:42.160 --> 2:33:48.160
 I'm a neoliberal economist, I believe in markets, I believe in prices, I believe in profit.

2:33:48.160 --> 2:33:51.160
 Corporations are not an incarnation of evil.

2:33:51.160 --> 2:34:00.160
 Corporations are a legal nexus through which production gets organized in which you solicit the cooperation of workers,

2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:07.160
 of people who provide capital, of people who provide raw materials and input of customers and so on.

2:34:07.160 --> 2:34:18.160
 That functionality allows for the production of goods and their distribution and their earning of income and its distribution,

2:34:18.160 --> 2:34:22.160
 which at the end of the day is the foundation of our prosperity.

2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:23.160
 Corporations are people too.

2:34:23.160 --> 2:34:26.160
 Mitt Romney got in trouble for saying that in 2012.

2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.160
 But corporations are nothing but a legal fiction.

2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:40.160
 The corporation is not a person as such, but the nexus of contracts and relationships amongst the stakeholders who intersect in the context of the corporation

2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:50.160
 is the way in which we organize the massively complex set of activities that are necessary in order to produce economic benefits

2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:54.160
 in order to feed people, in order to have everybody with a cell phone in their pocket,

2:34:54.160 --> 2:35:01.160
 in order to be able to travel from one side of a continent to another on a device that is with almost absolute certainty

2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:07.160
 going to safely take off inland in order to be able to build cities and etc.

2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:14.160
 But do the markets, the ideal of the market collide with the ideal of all men are created equal?

2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:23.160
 The identity, the struggle that we've been talking about of what it means to sort of empower humans that make up this great country.

2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:26.160
 Do they collide or where do they collide?

2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:29.160
 Well, markets are going to produce inequality.

2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:34.160
 And all men being equal is a statement about the intrinsic worth of people,

2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:39.160
 not about the situation that will come about when people interact with each other through markets,

2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:41.160
 because people are actually different.

2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:49.160
 And because there are factors that are beyond anybody's control called luck and chance that, you know, you and I both invest.

2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:53.160
 It looked our priority like your investment and my investment were equally likely to succeed.

2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:58.160
 But as a matter of fact, ex post facto, your investment succeeds, my investment doesn't succeed.

2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:00.160
 I don't have wealth and you have wealth.

2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:07.160
 That is an inevitable consequence of an environment in which both of us are free to make our investment choices

2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:14.160
 and where the consequences of investment depend in part upon random circumstances of which no one has control.

2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:19.160
 But you asked me about my politics and I was just trying to lay down a foundation by saying,

2:36:19.160 --> 2:36:27.160
 I begin as an economist in the tradition of liberalism, Adam Smith and so forth.

2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:34.160
 John Maynard Keynes for that matter and so forth, that Milton Friedman and so forth,

2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:47.160
 that Paul Samuels and Bob Solo, James Tobin and so forth, Thomas Sowell, yes, that appreciates property,

2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:56.160
 the virtues of free enterprise, the set of institutions that allow for security of contract,

2:36:56.160 --> 2:36:59.160
 a rule of law, things of this kind.

2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:02.160
 So that's one thing to say about my politics.

2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:06.160
 Another thing to say about my politics and you're right, I've moved around.

2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:13.160
 Is that, you know, I began outside of Chicago, black kid, I was a liberal Democrat.

2:37:13.160 --> 2:37:23.160
 I encountered the economics curriculum at the MIT and I became trained in economics in the tradition that I've just described.

2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:27.160
 And I encountered also the Reagan Revolution.

2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:30.160
 This is the late 70s and early 80s.

2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:35.160
 These are big debates about economic policy and so on.

2:37:35.160 --> 2:37:42.160
 And I found a lot to admire in the supply ciders.

2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:45.160
 The people were saying, you know, let's get the government out of the way.

2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:50.160
 The people who are worried about national debt, which is a lot more now than it was then.

2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:53.160
 The people who were worried that the welfare state could be too big,

2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:57.160
 that the incentives of transfer programs could be counterproductive,

2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:01.160
 that you had a war on poverty and we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.

2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:11.160
 And there's a lot of evidence that the war on poverty was lost by the people who were trying to quote unquote eradicate poverty in our time.

2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:17.160
 That incentives really do matter and that the state, which is driven by politics,

2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:21.160
 is often unresponsive to the dictates of incentives,

2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:27.160
 that the markets eliminate people who are inefficient and who are not cognizant of the consequences of incentives

2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:32.160
 because they can't cover their bottom line and they won't persist for very long if they can't cover their bottom line.

2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:37.160
 They're forced to respond to the realities of differences and costs and benefits and so forth

2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:41.160
 in a way that governments can cover because they have their hand in our pocket.

2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:46.160
 They can cover their losses and they can make accounts balanced,

2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:52.160
 notwithstanding their mistakes because they can take my property by fiat by the power of the state.

2:38:52.160 --> 2:38:59.160
 The tax collector comes if I don't pay, he seizes my holdings and they can carry on in that way.

2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:05.160
 They need the corrective influence of markets in order to be responsive to the realities of life.

2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:13.160
 I mean, I may not like it that prices are telling me that something that I want to do is infeasible.

2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:18.160
 I may not like it, but what the prices are telling me is that the costs of doing it

2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:23.160
 exceed the benefits to be derived from doing it and if I persist in doing it,

2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:27.160
 notwithstanding that I'm going to run losses and those losses will accumulate

2:39:27.160 --> 2:39:32.160
 and the net effect of that over an entire society is stagnation

2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:37.160
 and ultimate attenuation of the economic benefits that might be available to people.

2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:44.160
 Again, I think if you look at the developing world in the postcolonial period, the second half of the 20th century,

2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:48.160
 that's exactly what you see. Planning doesn't work.

2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:51.160
 Centralized control over resource allocation doesn't work.

2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:59.160
 I became more conservative in that respect, but I also, and this has to do with race,

2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:08.160
 lost faith in the posture that what became of the civil rights movement.

2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:15.160
 I mean, the civil rights movement, you quote King 1963, the civil rights movement starts out as

2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:28.160
 we want equal membership in the polity, but it becomes a systematized cover.

2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:37.160
 I'm going to argue for deficiencies that are discernible within black American society,

2:40:37.160 --> 2:40:41.160
 which only we could correct. That's a very controversial statement.

2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:50.160
 I make it with trepidation. I don't take any pleasure in saying it, but here's what I'm talking about.

2:40:50.160 --> 2:41:01.160
 So I'm talking about the family. So the family is a matter internal to the community about how men and women

2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:09.160
 relate to each other and engage in social reproduction, childbearing, the standing up of households,

2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:14.160
 the context within which children are mature and so forth and so on.

2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:22.160
 So the African American family is in trouble. I think I can demonstrate that by reference to high rates of

2:41:22.160 --> 2:41:30.160
 marital dissolution by high rates of birth to out of wedlock and so forth.

2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:34.160
 You can't even say that the African American family is in trouble.

2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:42.160
 Violence, homicide is the order of magnitude more prevalent amongst African Americans that it is in the society as a whole.

2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:47.160
 This is behavior. It's behavior of our people. I speak of black people.

2:41:47.160 --> 2:41:51.160
 Of course, we're not the only people in society for whom violence is an issue.

2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:56.160
 It's an order of magnitude more prevalent in our communities.

2:41:56.160 --> 2:41:59.160
 I'm talking about schooling and school failure.

2:41:59.160 --> 2:42:02.160
 So we have affirmative action as a cover.

2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:07.160
 It's a bandaid on differences in the development of intellectual performance,

2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:16.160
 which is only partly a consequence of the natural intelligence of people and largely a consequence of how people spend their time,

2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:23.160
 what they value, how they discipline themselves, what they do with their opportunities,

2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:28.160
 how parents raise their children, what peer groups value, and things of this kind.

2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:35.160
 The Asian students who are scoring off the charts on these exams are doing it not because they're intrinsically more intelligent

2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:43.160
 than other people, but because they work harder, because their parents are more insistent on focusing on their intellectual performance,

2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:52.160
 because they're disciplined, because of the way that they devote their time and their resources to equipping their children to function in the 21st century.

2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:56.160
 This is what I believe. I think it's demonstrably the case.

2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:00.160
 And it is a factor in racial disparity.

2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:10.160
 The way that the civil rights movement has evolved under the wing of the Democratic Party into an organized apologia

2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:17.160
 for the failures of African Americans to seize the opportunities that exist for us now in the 21st century,

2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:21.160
 but did not exist in the first half of the 20th century.

2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:29.160
 The way in which the civil rights movement has become an avoidance mechanism for us not taking we African Americans responsible.

2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:32.160
 This is Glenn Lowry. Not everybody's going to agree with it.

2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:36.160
 It's part of what makes me a conservative.

2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:41.160
 I am tired of the belly aching. I'm tired of the excuse me. Why supremacy?

2:43:41.160 --> 2:43:45.160
 It is in my mind a joke.

2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:58.160
 I limit the fact that that kind of rhetoric is so seductively attractive to African Americans and so widely adopted by others.

2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:04.160
 And as I am fond of saying, at the end of the day, nobody is coming to save us.

2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:13.160
 I mean, higher education, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, where the future is happening.

2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:22.160
 That is about mastery over the achievements of human civilization, such as they manifest themselves in the 21st century.

2:44:22.160 --> 2:44:27.160
 There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery over the material.

2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:34.160
 There's no substitute for that to be patronized, to have the standards lowered.

2:44:34.160 --> 2:44:36.160
 They want to get rid of the test.

2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:40.160
 They want to tell African Americans the pat us on the head.

2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:42.160
 We're going to have a separate program for you.

2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:47.160
 We're going to give you a side door that you can come into that doesn't make us any smarter.

2:44:47.160 --> 2:44:50.160
 It doesn't make us any more creative.

2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:58.160
 And it doesn't make us any more fit for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.

2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:04.160
 Now, you want to be 10% of the population that's carried along for the next 100 years.

2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:09.160
 You want to be a ward of the state in the late 21st century.

2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:12.160
 You go ahead because the Chinese are coming.

2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:14.160
 You're not going to hold them back.

2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:19.160
 The world is being remade every decade by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing.

2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:26.160
 If you don't get on board with the dynamic advancement of the civilization in which we are embedded,

2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:31.160
 you're going to end up being dependent on other people to look kindly upon you.

2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:40.160
 In this story that you've got, this belly ache, this excuse, my ancestors were slaves,

2:45:40.160 --> 2:45:45.160
 is only going to work for so long.

2:45:45.160 --> 2:45:49.160
 So that makes me, I suppose, a kind of conservative.

2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:51.160
 I hate affirmative action.

2:45:51.160 --> 2:45:52.160
 I don't just disagree with it.

2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:55.160
 I don't just think it's against the 14th Amendment.

2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:56.160
 I hate it.

2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:00.160
 The hatred comes from an understanding that it is a mandate,

2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:05.160
 that it is a substitute for the actual development of our capacities of our people to compete.

2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:14.160
 I'd much rather be in the position of having them try to keep me out because I'm so damn good like they're doing with the Asians.

2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:21.160
 Then having them have to beg the Supreme Court to allow for a special dispensation on my behalf

2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:25.160
 because they need diversity and inclusion and belonging.

2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:27.160
 It's not just diversity.

2:46:27.160 --> 2:46:28.160
 It's not just diversity and inclusion.

2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:31.160
 There's diversity and inclusion and belonging.

2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:35.160
 I'm whining because I feel like I don't belong.

2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:37.160
 That's a position of weakness.

2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:39.160
 It's pathetic.

2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:44.160
 And it's the only political correctness that keeps people who can see this,

2:46:44.160 --> 2:46:49.160
 and believe me, a lot of people can see it from saying so out loud.

2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:54.160
 So you want the black American community to represent strength?

2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:55.160
 Correct.

2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:58.160
 And I want us to deal with what it is that we have to deal with

2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:05.160
 in order to be able to project strength in an increasingly competitive world.

2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:08.160
 Let me ask you.

2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:14.160
 I know you said you're angry or dislike affirmative action.

2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:20.160
 Let me ask you about something that even to my ear cut wrong.

2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:23.160
 Now I'm relatively apolitical.

2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:27.160
 So President Biden, when he was running for president,

2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:34.160
 gave a campaign promise that he will nominate a black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court saying,

2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:39.160
 the person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications,

2:47:39.160 --> 2:47:44.160
 character, experience, and integrity, first sentence, second sentence.

2:47:44.160 --> 2:47:50.160
 And that person will be the first black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.

2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:55.160
 Do you wish he only said the first sentence and not the second?

2:47:55.160 --> 2:47:58.160
 Yes, I wish that he had only said the first sentence,

2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:03.160
 even if his intention was to do what he said he was going to do in the second sentence.

2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:06.160
 In other words, I wish that he had simply said,

2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:09.160
 if I have the opportunity to nominate someone to the Supreme Court,

2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:13.160
 it's going to be a superbly qualified person to carry out that position.

2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:19.160
 And he might have kept to himself his intention to name an African American woman to that position

2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:22.160
 and then going ahead and named an African American woman to that position.

2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:25.160
 And I'm sure that Katanji Brown Jackson.

2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:27.160
 I don't doubt that she's exceptionally qualified.

2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:29.160
 She has a distinguished career.

2:48:29.160 --> 2:48:32.160
 She serves as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:33.160
 She's a graduate at Harvard Law School.

2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:35.160
 She has a background.

2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:41.160
 You do not have to be a world class constitutional legal scholar

2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:43.160
 to get onto the United States Supreme Court.

2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:48.160
 A lot of members of the United States Supreme Court have had different kinds of legal careers

2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:51.160
 before they were elevated to that position.

2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:58.160
 Earl Warren of the famed Warren Court of the 1950s and 60s was a politician,

2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:01.160
 as well as a leading jurist and whatnot.

2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:03.160
 I mean, many kinds of people in the U.S. Supreme Court.

2:49:03.160 --> 2:49:10.160
 I have no doubt that Judge Katanji Brown Jackson is a qualified member to be on the Supreme Court.

2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:13.160
 I wish that Biden had not done what he did.

2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:19.160
 He could have just appointed a black woman by saying that he was limiting his considerations to black women.

2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:24.160
 And what are black women as a percentage of all potential appointees to the Supreme Court?

2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:26.160
 Three percent?

2:49:26.160 --> 2:49:27.160
 Four percent?

2:49:27.160 --> 2:49:28.160
 I don't know.

2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:30.160
 We could look the number up.

2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:35.160
 By saying that he puts an asterisk on the appointment, but it's worse than that.

2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:42.160
 Because she will live down the asterisk if a person is inclined to do that.

2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:47.160
 She will have the opportunity to show through her performance exactly what kind of jurist she is.

2:49:47.160 --> 2:49:51.160
 Just as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown through his performance

2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:57.160
 that he was qualified and more than qualified to be on the United States Supreme Court,

2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:01.160
 what I dislike was the pandering.

2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:06.160
 He was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us.

2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:09.160
 And he's treating us like children.

2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:14.160
 Why should I care what color the person is who's on the United States Supreme Court?

2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:20.160
 What I should care about is what kind of opinions they're going to write when they're on the United States.

2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:24.160
 Do I suppose that being a black woman means that you're going to write different kind of opinions from others?

2:50:24.160 --> 2:50:34.160
 Well, perhaps, perhaps that kind of identity politics at the highest level of American legal establishment

2:50:34.160 --> 2:50:38.160
 is something that rubs me very much the wrong way.

2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:43.160
 What I should care about is the nature and the future of the law.

2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:50.160
 I'm actually struck by this because the court is conservative.

2:50:50.160 --> 2:50:58.160
 It has six conservative members on it and it has three liberal members on it.

2:50:58.160 --> 2:51:07.160
 And if I were, and I'm not a liberal Democrat, the highest concern that I would have about an appointment to the Supreme Court is,

2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:16.160
 is this a person who is going to be effective in advocating my liberal views within the highest counsel of American law?

2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:29.160
 Now, the fact that that person is a woman or is a black person is way down the list of the things that I would think are important to the kinds of opinions that they're going to write.

2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:46.160
 So, I mean, I think Joe Biden, this is just a piece of a larger political strategy to cobble together a coalition that will be successful at the polls in sustaining Democrats.

2:51:46.160 --> 2:51:59.160
 Jim Crow 2.0, this whole characterization of the conflict in the States about election security and voting rights is another part of that strategy.

2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:02.160
 He is pandering to black voters.

2:52:02.160 --> 2:52:09.160
 He is trying to frighten us thinking that if the Republicans win, our rights will be taken away.

2:52:09.160 --> 2:52:16.160
 And I think it is a infantilization of African American politics.

2:52:16.160 --> 2:52:32.160
 I think black people are not to be as concerned about the color of the skin of a person who is serving in government as they are about the content of their character and the focus of their political and ideological orientation,

2:52:32.160 --> 2:52:38.160
 which for me would be center or even center right, but that's me.

2:52:38.160 --> 2:52:41.160
 And it should not have a significant impact.

2:52:41.160 --> 2:52:51.160
 Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterisks, but to me, it was deeply disrespectful that anyone would give an extra asterisk stuff to overcome.

2:52:51.160 --> 2:52:57.160
 He didn't have to say it. All he had to do was do it. If he wanted to put a black woman on the court, he could go ahead and done it.

2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:01.160
 The reason he said it is because he wanted black people to vote for him by saying it.

2:53:01.160 --> 2:53:03.160
 And I'm saying that treats us like we're children.

2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:11.160
 It's not a political statement. I just thought as a leader that was kind of disgusting.

2:53:11.160 --> 2:53:22.160
 Let me ask you about Thomas Sowell. You mentioned him. He's a colleague and somebody who was an influence in the space of ideas.

2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:34.160
 So what broadly, what impact has he had on your ideas and how do you think he shaped the landscape of ideas in our culture in general?

2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:39.160
 I think Thomas Sowell is in his nineties now. He's been around for a long time.

2:53:39.160 --> 2:53:41.160
 He's still got it. He's still going at it.

2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:44.160
 He's still going at it. Books continue to come out. I think he's a great man.

2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:57.160
 I think Thomas Sowell, regardless of his race, he's black, is one of the 100 most significant economists of the 20th century.

2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:09.160
 He has chosen as his subject, a substantial part of his subject, subject to investigate the deep causes and consequences of racial disparity of one kind or another.

2:54:09.160 --> 2:54:20.160
 He's written fundamental books about that, many of them. He's a social philosopher. He is an economic historian.

2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:33.160
 He is a combatant in the conflict of ideas around how to think about society and this beyond racial differences, although race has been a big part of what he's written about.

2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:42.160
 He's been critical of affirmative action and he didn't just stand back and wag his finger. He got busy looking at the consequences of affirmative action in societies all around the world.

2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:50.160
 And he's written books about that. He's been critical of the narrative about civil rights and racial inequality.

2:54:50.160 --> 2:55:00.160
 He believes in small government. He doesn't think that efforts to redistribute income have proved to be the solution to the problem of racial disparity.

2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:09.160
 Tom has not been honored by the committee that hands out Nobel recognition in economic science and probably won't be because he's controversial.

2:55:09.160 --> 2:55:26.160
 And I reckon that that committee would be low to encourage the blowback that they would be sure to receive if they were to take a controversial and politically focused and expressive black conservative and honor in that way.

2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:34.160
 So I think another reason is that Tom, as a methodological methodological matter, is not especially quantitative.

2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:39.160
 He pays attention to data, but he doesn't do statistical analysis and he doesn't do modeling.

2:55:39.160 --> 2:55:51.160
 So from a methodological point of view, he's not a cutting edge, kind of mathematically sophisticated, kind of quantitatively, statistically oriented.

2:55:51.160 --> 2:56:03.160
 He does descriptive stuff. He writes in a style that is much more like a social historian than it is like a mathematically trained analytical economist.

2:56:03.160 --> 2:56:20.160
 On the other hand, he is an economist in the Chicago School with Milton Friedman and George Stickler prominent amongst his teachers who takes price theory, which is the analysis of the interplay of market forces.

2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:31.160
 Mindful of incentives and so on to implement the basic insights from economic science.

2:56:31.160 --> 2:56:39.160
 There is no free lunch. I mean, there's always going to be a cost anything that you do and so on. People respond to incentives, demand curve slope downward.

2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:44.160
 Competition tends to work best when people are free to enter and not and so on.

2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:55.160
 I mean, that kind of thing. But Tom is also a social historian and a philosopher in the tradition of Friedrich von Hayek.

2:56:55.160 --> 2:57:08.160
 One of Tom's books I deeply admire, Knowledge and Decisions, is an extension of the Hayekian arguments about the limits of central planning and whatnot.

2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:28.160
 So I think Tom Sol, Thomas Sol, African American, born as I understand it in Louisiana, raised in New York City, a graduate of Harvard College, a military veteran, a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago,

2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:34.160
 a black conservative social scientist of very high status. I think he's a great man.

2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:42.160
 And one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century. And you're saying implicitly deserves a Nobel Prize.

2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:49.160
 Yeah, I do think so. I mean, Hayek was awarded by the committee.

2:57:49.160 --> 2:58:06.160
 Gunnar Meridal, the Swedish economist, wrote about economic development, wrote a famous two volume work, An American Dilemma about the status of blacks. I mean, I think Tom could be, you know, put in that company very easily, but not any difficult.

2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:10.160
 I agree. Daniel Kahneman, them, so it doesn't have to be new.

2:58:10.160 --> 2:58:26.160
 He's a biologist, he's not an economist. Eleanor Ostrom, the political scientist who was honored in a joint prize given to her and Oliver Williamson 15 years ago or so. He could be put in that company really quite easily.

2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:42.160
 Let me ask you, you mentioned Obama in this, in the very beginning that we were talking about. How do they feel that seems like forever ago, then 2008 Barack Obama became president.

2:58:42.160 --> 2:59:03.160
 At this time, perhaps you identify as conservative already. But how did, so politics aside, just in general, how did it feel that in 150 years where this country has come along?

2:59:03.160 --> 2:59:19.160
 Well, yeah, I didn't identify in 2008 as a conservative to the same extent I do today. I was, I was kind of in transition yet again. I was excited by the Obama candidacy.

2:59:19.160 --> 2:59:34.160
 At first I was skeptical, because after all he's not black. The man's father is a Kenyan and the man's mother is a white American, and he identifies as black.

2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:49.160
 I find it interesting that the first black president of the United States, and I could have put inverted commas around black, and the first black vice president in the United States, neither of them descend from American slaves.

2:59:49.160 --> 3:00:12.160
 Kamala Harris's father is of African ancestry in part. He's a Jamaican immigrant and her mother is an Indian immigrant. She was Kamala Harris raised up largely in Canada, though born in the United States.

3:00:12.160 --> 3:00:31.160
 Barack Obama is, as I've said, of mixed ancestry and neither of his parents are the descendants of American descendants of African slaves. But blackness is flexible.

3:00:31.160 --> 3:00:41.160
 It's something that you can put on or you can take off to a certain degree for some people and so be it.

3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:57.160
 I was excited. Our time has come. Hope and change. We are the ones we've been waiting for. These are slogans from 2008. I can't believe I bought that crap.

3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:26.160
 Interesting. Let me push back here. To me, a Jew is a Jew. Skin color is skin color. Barack Obama is black when it matters. When you're talking to a white supremacist, when you're a slave owner, he's black.

3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:35.160
 Just like you said, when Hitler comes around, a Jew is a Jew. It doesn't matter how you identify. It doesn't matter what.

3:01:35.160 --> 3:01:48.160
 So in that sense, don't you think that Barack Obama is black in the most powerful of ways, which is designating how far the MLK, the Dr. King vision.

3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:52.160
 Oh, sure. And look, I said it a little bit tongue in chief.

3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:53.160
 Yes, yes, of course.

3:01:53.160 --> 3:02:08.160
 But I think Obama has been very careful about manufacturing a kind of public persona that is intended to position him in the most effective way.

3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:10.160
 You mean like every politician?

3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:24.160
 Yeah, like every politician, sure. And that the racial identity piece is an aspect of that. I mean, anything I say here would only be speculation because I have no facts about the personal history of Barack Obama.

3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:43.160
 And I accept Barack Hussein Obama. As Hillary Clinton was said, I take him at his word about whatever she was talking about. Well, was he a Christian? I think is what the question was. And, you know, there was some right wing attack on Obama for, you know, having been raised

3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:57.160
 and for some years in the Philippines and all of that or Indonesia, I beg your pardon, in Indonesia and his stepfather and all of that. But she took him at his word and I take him at his word about his racial identity.

3:02:57.160 --> 3:02:58.160
 No.

3:02:58.160 --> 3:03:04.160
 But you were captivated by the power of his words and you regret to the degree you were captivated.

3:03:04.160 --> 3:03:15.160
 Well, I mean, I think in retrospect that whole campaign looks like pie in the sky kind of fairytale. We are the ones we've been waiting for.

3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:23.160
 I can't quote exactly that speech that he gave in Grant Park in Chicago when he was announced as the winner of the election.

3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:36.160
 But today is the day that the rise of the ocean stop words to this effect. I mean, those who doubted that we could do it that tonight is your answer. This was going to be a new day. It was going to be a new regime.

3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:49.160
 Well, it wasn't a new day and it wasn't a new regime. It was American politics, more or less as usual. Barack Obama turns out not to be the Messiah. Maybe there should be no surprise in that.

3:03:49.160 --> 3:04:05.160
 Race relations got set back during Obama's tenure. My beef with Obama is that you okay, you're black. You say you're black, you're black. You got elected. Now we have a black president, a black president.

3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:09.160
 You can do stuff that nobody else could do.

3:04:09.160 --> 3:04:20.160
 You're a black president. You could tell the people burning down the city to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it.

3:04:20.160 --> 3:04:40.160
 You could tell the race hustlers. They all shocked into the world. Not only has our time come for those who supported my my campaign, your time is over for those who want to carry on a advocacy rooted in racial grievance.

3:04:40.160 --> 3:04:50.160
 The election of myself to this highest office proves that the institution of this state are legitimate and open to all comers.

3:04:50.160 --> 3:04:56.160
 I think Barack Obama, when the sh it hit the fan.

3:04:56.160 --> 3:05:15.160
 If I had a son, he looked like Trayvon. I deeply regret that he said that he's president of the United States, the color of his skin and the color of Trayvon skin, the correlation between those two things. If I had a son, he looked like Trayvon. Now he says when he said it, he only meant to sympathize with the parents.

3:05:15.160 --> 3:05:24.160
 But in fact, when he said it from the highest office in the land, and then sent his attorney general Eric Holder out to enforce this narrative.

3:05:24.160 --> 3:05:29.160
 He doubled down on a racial narrative that I think is actually false.

3:05:29.160 --> 3:05:42.160
 I think the story that systemic racism in America as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people because of the color of the skin is demonstrably false.

3:05:42.160 --> 3:05:54.160
 I think that the central threat to black lives is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people against other black people.

3:05:54.160 --> 3:06:06.160
 I think there is such a thing as police brutality and I think there are reasons to have regulations of police, but I think it is a second order issue in terms of the quality of life of African Americans.

3:06:06.160 --> 3:06:20.160
 I think Obama could have told the people who after Freddie Gray died in police custody in a van in Baltimore and who undertook to burn that city down to get their asses off the street and go back to their apartments and stop it.

3:06:20.160 --> 3:06:33.160
 I think he could have said in the aftermath of Michael Brown being shot dead by Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and there was a grand jury deliberation that elected not to indict Officer Wilson.

3:06:33.160 --> 3:06:39.160
 People took the streets in that city and stood on top of vehicles and so forth and so on.

3:06:39.160 --> 3:06:49.160
 He could have told them we don't mob around courthouses in this country, we respect the rule of law, get your butts off the streets and back into your apartments.

3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:51.160
 He didn't do that.

3:06:51.160 --> 3:06:54.160
 To push back a little bit.

3:06:54.160 --> 3:06:56.160
 Yeah, good. Push back.

3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:09.160
 I think you're asking Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States to do the thing that I think should be done by the second black president of the United States.

3:07:09.160 --> 3:07:17.160
 I think his very example, given the color of his skin, was the most powerful thing.

3:07:17.160 --> 3:07:31.160
 And actually doing some of these hard, Thomas Sowell type of Glenn Lowry type of strong words about race, it may be too much to ask, given the nature of modern day politics.

3:07:31.160 --> 3:07:33.160
 He is a politician.

3:07:33.160 --> 3:07:34.160
 He is a politician.

3:07:34.160 --> 3:07:35.160
 He needed to get elected.

3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:36.160
 He needed to get reelected.

3:07:36.160 --> 3:07:38.160
 Yeah.

3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:48.160
 It was in his second term where most of what I'm talking about happened, so he wasn't facing further election, but Obama was what, 46 or 47 when he was inaugurated.

3:07:48.160 --> 3:07:51.160
 He served for eight years, so he's in his mid fifties.

3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:56.160
 He's got another half century or 40 years of life, God willing.

3:07:56.160 --> 3:08:05.160
 His post presidency, I think, was what was primarily on his mind, not getting elected to anything, but being enshrined in a certain way.

3:08:05.160 --> 3:08:29.160
 And the persona that he is now embodying, which depends upon a racial narrative that I and Thomas Sowell and others object to, I think was very much in the forefront of his mind when he made decisions as the chief executive officer of the country that we've all now have to live with.

3:08:29.160 --> 3:08:30.160
 Yeah.

3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:53.160
 The fact is, he opened the door in a way that hasn't been done in the history of this, the United States, that I don't see there being even a significant discussion when an African American, a black man or a black woman runs for president.

3:08:53.160 --> 3:08:57.160
 Maybe a black man, let's say, because there still hasn't been a woman president.

3:08:57.160 --> 3:09:01.160
 I just see that that broke open the possibility of that.

3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:03.160
 That's not even a discussion.

3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:05.160
 And that example by itself.

3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:10.160
 I mean, to me, the role of the president isn't just policy, it's to inspire.

3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:17.160
 It's to do the Dr. King thing, which is I have a dream.

3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:21.160
 And Barack Obama is an example of somebody that could give one hell of a speech.

3:09:21.160 --> 3:09:24.160
 It got you to believe.

3:09:24.160 --> 3:09:26.160
 Obama is a smooth operator without any question.

3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:28.160
 He's a master of his craft.

3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:30.160
 He, you know, he did the impossible.

3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:38.160
 I mean, he beat Hillary Clinton in that primary fight and he beat John McCain in that general election and hats off to him.

3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:43.160
 And moreover, he remains an iconic figure in American culture.

3:09:43.160 --> 3:09:45.160
 I don't think there's any doubt about that.

3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:50.160
 Let me just mention, Clarence Thomas is also black.

3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:55.160
 Clarence Thomas has a story that is vivid and inspiring.

3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:59.160
 Just like Obama's story, he overcome obstacles just like Obama did.

3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:02.160
 I mean, extreme poverty and so forth and so on.

3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:09.160
 Clarence Thomas has served longer than any other member of the United States Supreme Court.

3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:15.160
 He is one of nine justices and it's three equal branches of government.

3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:24.160
 So Clarence Thomas, by my arithmetic, personifies 127th of the American state.

3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:28.160
 He is an iconic figure.

3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:36.160
 His example should be an inspiration to Americans of all races, but especially a black American youngsters.

3:10:36.160 --> 3:10:38.160
 He happens to be conservative.

3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:41.160
 He's very conservative.

3:10:41.160 --> 3:10:43.160
 So fucking what?

3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:46.160
 He too deserves to be in that pantheon.

3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:55.160
 He is not by the custodians of American education, Clarence Thomas's name is not on that many schools, Barack Obama's name will be on many of them.

3:10:55.160 --> 3:10:56.160
 I'm not equating them.

3:10:56.160 --> 3:10:57.160
 They're different people.

3:10:57.160 --> 3:10:59.160
 The offices are very different.

3:10:59.160 --> 3:11:11.160
 But the same logic that you just used to extol the significance of Barack Obama's ascendancy could and should be applied to Clarence Thomas, in my opinion.

3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:25.160
 Yes, but you know, it's the office, but also there is a resume and there's accomplishments, but then there is oratory and charisma and a number of Twitter followers.

3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:30.160
 So there's ability to captivate a large number of people.

3:11:30.160 --> 3:11:32.160
 And that's a skill.

3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:40.160
 That's a skill that correlates but is not directly connected to with how impressive your resume is.

3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:41.160
 I agree.

3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:48.160
 And moreover, the judicial function, the judge doesn't go out and give speeches of that sort because it's exactly antithetical to what he's doing.

3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:54.160
 He's a custodian of the law, not a popular figure in American policy.

3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:57.160
 He doesn't stand for election and it's a good thing too.

3:11:57.160 --> 3:11:59.160
 So I take that point.

3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:02.160
 Here, I want to say something else, though, that's provocative.

3:12:02.160 --> 3:12:06.160
 The next black president, you say the first black president shouldn't have been the one to do that.

3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:10.160
 The second one should is more likely to not going to be a Republican.

3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:12.160
 I don't have a particular person in mind.

3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:13.160
 I'm just saying.

3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:14.160
 I agree.

3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:15.160
 I agree.

3:12:15.160 --> 3:12:17.160
 I agree.

3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:20.160
 And that's why it's going to be super fun.

3:12:20.160 --> 3:12:27.160
 Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat and give advice to young people.

3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:40.160
 So if you're talking to somebody who's in high school in college, what advice would you give them about their career, about life in general, how to live a life they can be proud of?

3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:44.160
 Well, I'd say the world is your oyster.

3:12:44.160 --> 3:12:46.160
 I mean, first order business, you're not a victim.

3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:47.160
 I don't care what color you are.

3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:49.160
 I don't care you male, female, you gay, straight, whatever.

3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:51.160
 The world is your oyster.

3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:52.160
 You are so privileged.

3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:56.160
 You sit here in the United States of America, a free country, a rich country, everything is possible for you.

3:12:56.160 --> 3:12:58.160
 Believe me, you can do anything.

3:12:58.160 --> 3:13:00.160
 Okay.

3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:11.160
 Secondly, I would say mastery over the medium in which we're embedded is the key to the future.

3:13:11.160 --> 3:13:25.160
 So get educated, focus, work hard, you know, invest in your future by acquiring the skills that you need to be able to navigate the 21st century.

3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:30.160
 I would say the Chinese are coming and I don't mean anything against China.

3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:34.160
 I just mean to say the world's a small place and it's getting smaller.

3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:43.160
 And, you know, you better get moving and you better get moving quickly.

3:13:43.160 --> 3:14:01.160
 I'd say your identity, your coloration, your orientation, your category is not the most important thing about you that, you know, so the temptation to limit yourself.

3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:03.160
 I give this speech to my kids.

3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:22.160
 I would say, I quote James Joyce, he has a passage in Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man in which he says, do you know what Ireland is?

3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:27.160
 Ireland is an old sow that eats her feral.

3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:29.160
 This is Joyce.

3:14:29.160 --> 3:14:35.160
 He says, Stephen Dedalus is the character that he has in mind in this chronicle.

3:14:35.160 --> 3:14:46.160
 He says, your ethnic inheritance, he's talking about Irish nationalism, are like nets holding you back.

3:14:46.160 --> 3:14:58.160
 That your challenge is to learn how to turn those nets into wings and thereby to fly, okay, flying into the open skies of modern society.

3:14:58.160 --> 3:15:00.160
 Don't be your grandfather.

3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:02.160
 Don't be your father.

3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:08.160
 Don't wear your things so heavily that it keeps you from being open to everything that's new in the world.

3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:10.160
 Wear it lightly.

3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:15.160
 Yes, everybody comes from somewhere, but it doesn't have to be where you end up.

3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:19.160
 So you're not your father, you're not your grandfather.

3:15:19.160 --> 3:15:29.160
 You are this wonderfully blessed human being in the middle of going into the middle of the 21st century.

3:15:29.160 --> 3:15:32.160
 And don't miss it.

3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:35.160
 Don't live blinkerately.

3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:37.160
 Don't live small.

3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:41.160
 Live big.

3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:48.160
 Live big and wear your history lightly.

3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:57.160
 Everybody's got a mother tongue, everybody's got a story, everybody has a people, but the world is a small place.

3:15:57.160 --> 3:16:03.160
 I love that you're quoting an Irishman.

3:16:03.160 --> 3:16:09.160
 One of the greatest writers of the 20th century, a profound one, but an Irishman nevertheless.

3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:14.160
 The levels of humor within that is not lost on me.

3:16:14.160 --> 3:16:22.160
 Let me just mention the great Ralph Ellison, the African American writer, invisible man is his masterpiece,

3:16:22.160 --> 3:16:24.160
 embodied this spirit.

3:16:24.160 --> 3:16:30.160
 Okay, we black Americans, we do come from somewhere that come in from somewhere is from slavery in America.

3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:35.160
 That's our ancestral heritage, but that's not what we are.

3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:40.160
 Skin and bone, these are superficial things, the spirit.

3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:45.160
 And if I were a more religious person, I could give a whole disposition about that, but it's the spirit.

3:16:45.160 --> 3:16:46.160
 It's that light that's inside.

3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:47.160
 That's who we are.

3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:53.160
 And our challenge is to live in the fullness of it as opposed to this blinker thing.

3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:55.160
 When we don't look left, we don't look right.

3:16:55.160 --> 3:16:59.160
 We're just fitting within this template that we inherit.

3:16:59.160 --> 3:17:03.160
 That is a travesty, really.

3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:06.160
 Glenn, you've lived an incredible life.

3:17:06.160 --> 3:17:14.160
 A productive one, but just representing some powerful ideas, some powerful ideals.

3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:17.160
 But life comes to an end.

3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:18.160
 Yeah.

3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:20.160
 Do you think about your death?

3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:24.160
 Are you afraid of it?

3:17:24.160 --> 3:17:33.160
 Well, it is a really interesting coincidence that you posed me that question.

3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:37.160
 Because I'm coming from a funeral.

3:17:37.160 --> 3:17:44.160
 Today is Sunday on the preceding Tuesday, five days ago.

3:17:44.160 --> 3:17:51.160
 I was at the funeral of Eugene Wesley Smith, who was my brother in law.

3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:55.160
 He was my sister's husband.

3:17:55.160 --> 3:18:01.160
 My sister, Leonette, passed away in August of 2021.

3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:09.160
 Her husband has died at the age of 68 in April of 2022.

3:18:09.160 --> 3:18:12.160
 And I was at his funeral.

3:18:12.160 --> 3:18:15.160
 He died suddenly of a heart attack that came completely out of the blue.

3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:18.160
 He seemed to be in perfect health.

3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:20.160
 He was a magnificent human being.

3:18:20.160 --> 3:18:24.160
 I could go into the details, but, you know, take my word for it.

3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:28.160
 He was a businessman, a steel trader, a metals trader.

3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:30.160
 He would buy and sell.

3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:32.160
 He worked mostly from his home office.

3:18:32.160 --> 3:18:39.160
 He had clients, counterparties, people he did business with all over the world.

3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:45.160
 He had three sons, one of whom is in his early 30s, two of whom are in their late 30s.

3:18:45.160 --> 3:18:47.160
 These are my sister's children.

3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:48.160
 She's deceased.

3:18:48.160 --> 3:18:50.160
 Now he's deceased.

3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:54.160
 The older two sons are severely, developmentally disabled.

3:18:54.160 --> 3:18:59.160
 And although they're in their late 30s, they're not independently viable.

3:18:59.160 --> 3:19:01.160
 They don't function effectively.

3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:03.160
 They have to be cared for.

3:19:03.160 --> 3:19:14.160
 That responsibility has now fallen to the family, but mainly to the surviving son who lives with his wife and his two young children.

3:19:14.160 --> 3:19:17.160
 And as assumed the responsibility, they've cared at home.

3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:24.160
 My sister and her husband, Wesley Eugene Wesley Smith cared for their disabled sons at home.

3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:26.160
 They didn't want to see them institutionalized.

3:19:26.160 --> 3:19:30.160
 They had some help from programs at the state and social worker and so on.

3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:34.160
 But they mainly took on the burden of caring for them at home.

3:19:34.160 --> 3:19:39.160
 Anyway, I go on at length here and, you know, I don't know how much of this you will choose to make use of.

3:19:39.160 --> 3:19:41.160
 And it doesn't matter really.

3:19:41.160 --> 3:19:43.160
 I'm just trying to respond to your question.

3:19:43.160 --> 3:19:49.160
 I was asked to offer some remarks at the funeral.

3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:51.160
 And I offered them.

3:19:51.160 --> 3:19:56.160
 And I, you know, I spoke well of this great man.

3:19:56.160 --> 3:19:57.160
 He was a great man.

3:19:57.160 --> 3:19:59.160
 He had a straight back.

3:19:59.160 --> 3:20:01.160
 He was a standup guy he could be counted on.

3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:03.160
 His word was his bond.

3:20:03.160 --> 3:20:04.160
 He had broad shoulders.

3:20:04.160 --> 3:20:10.160
 He carried a lot of people with him, business associates, family members, and so forth and so on.

3:20:10.160 --> 3:20:12.160
 He had a huge heart.

3:20:12.160 --> 3:20:14.160
 He was a giving and kind person.

3:20:14.160 --> 3:20:15.160
 He had a great mind.

3:20:15.160 --> 3:20:32.160
 He was an intellectual, even though as a businessman, much of his day was taken up with, you know, minutia of contracts and, you know, the details of the order being delivered and not being delivered of the quality of the product of the financing and so forth and so forth.

3:20:32.160 --> 3:20:34.160
 There was still a powerful mind there.

3:20:34.160 --> 3:20:36.160
 Yeah, he was a powerful mind and he studied.

3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:37.160
 He read books.

3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:39.160
 He was interested in music and art.

3:20:39.160 --> 3:20:46.160
 He's a spiritual seeker had been ordained as a child minister in his youth.

3:20:46.160 --> 3:21:08.160
 And while he remained a master of the Christian canon, he also explored Eastern religion and other spiritual paths and kind of stood above any particular tradition as a man who believed in God but thought that God manifest himself in many ways to human beings and that there was much to learn.

3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:11.160
 From other religious traditions as well.

3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:12.160
 This is Wesley.

3:21:12.160 --> 3:21:17.160
 We call him Wesley by his middle name Eugene Wesley Smith may rest in peace.

3:21:17.160 --> 3:21:18.160
 68.

3:21:18.160 --> 3:21:20.160
 That's five years younger than I am right now.

3:21:20.160 --> 3:21:22.160
 He dropped dead without any warning.

3:21:22.160 --> 3:21:24.160
 I could too.

3:21:24.160 --> 3:21:28.160
 So how did that make you feel?

3:21:28.160 --> 3:21:34.160
 What were the thoughts in your mind leading up to it having to give that speech in the days that followed?

3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:43.160
 Well, first of all, I wonder what would I say? What would I say? And, you know, there was no way to prepare and I decided, you know, I rehearsed in my mind this, you know, straight back at broad shoulders.

3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:44.160
 He had a big heart.

3:21:44.160 --> 3:21:45.160
 He had a great mind.

3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:49.160
 You know, he had a capacious spirit and whatnot.

3:21:49.160 --> 3:21:52.160
 And I use that as a template for making my remarks.

3:21:52.160 --> 3:21:57.160
 But my main thought was my God life is precious and life is fleeting.

3:21:57.160 --> 3:22:00.160
 And death is a part of life.

3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:04.160
 My death is a part of my life.

3:22:04.160 --> 3:22:09.160
 And I thought, you know, well, I want to take better care of myself than I do, you know, et cetera, et cetera.

3:22:09.160 --> 3:22:13.160
 But I also thought a lot of this is not in my hands at all.

3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:16.160
 I thought one should have his affairs in order.

3:22:16.160 --> 3:22:22.160
 My brother did not have all of his affairs in order in the sense that there is a lot of, you know, things are going to probate.

3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:23.160
 There was no will.

3:22:23.160 --> 3:22:26.160
 There's, you know, this is kind of unsettled.

3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:30.160
 I don't want that to happen to my surviving family members.

3:22:30.160 --> 3:22:38.160
 I want to have my affairs such that should heaven forbid I fall over one day and don't get up again.

3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:43.160
 People don't have to scramble about how to take care of things from that point forward.

3:22:43.160 --> 3:22:47.160
 But as a human, are you afraid?

3:22:47.160 --> 3:22:48.160
 I'm afraid.

3:22:48.160 --> 3:22:52.160
 Now, I read this wonderful book called The Swerve.

3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:54.160
 It's about Lucretius.

3:22:54.160 --> 3:23:03.160
 It's about the nature of things, which is this great classical work from the Roman period by this guy, Lucretius.

3:23:03.160 --> 3:23:06.160
 And I'm trying to think of the name of the author, but you could look it up.

3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:08.160
 The Swerve is the book.

3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:10.160
 And one like a National Book Award or a Pulitzer Prize.

3:23:10.160 --> 3:23:23.160
 And it's the history of the recovery of this book by one of these Italian Renaissance Italian people who would go into the monasteries in Central Europe.

3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:31.160
 And look through the scrolls and they discovered these classical works from antiquity, which had been lost through the Dark Ages.

3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:36.160
 And they republish and read these works.

3:23:36.160 --> 3:23:44.160
 And Lucretius's great work on the nature of things was one of these books, Poggio Baccholini.

3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:48.160
 I don't remember the Italian guy's name, but this all could be looked up.

3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:52.160
 Yeah, Poggio Baccholini, 15th century.

3:23:52.160 --> 3:23:59.160
 And the name of the author is Stephen Greenblatt.

3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:04.160
 Yeah, Stephen Greenblatt, a magnificent book and a terrific story.

3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:09.160
 Anyway, one of Lucretius's points, he was an atheist.

3:24:09.160 --> 3:24:11.160
 I mean, he was a Roman.

3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:14.160
 I mean, he didn't believe in mysticism.

3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:19.160
 And he argued it's irrational to be afraid of death.

3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:21.160
 Why should I fear death?

3:24:21.160 --> 3:24:24.160
 Death is coming to all of us.

3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:25.160
 The point of being afraid.

3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:30.160
 I mean, I'm wasting my time fearing something that I have no ultimate control over.

3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:34.160
 It's irrational to be afraid of death.

3:24:34.160 --> 3:24:38.160
 Yeah, because you can't predict when it happens.

3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:41.160
 You only know that it happens.

3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:43.160
 So why be afraid?

3:24:43.160 --> 3:24:50.160
 And therefore live every day fully, live every day purposefully, you know, and so on.

3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:54.160
 But these are all just words, you know, I don't want to die.

3:24:54.160 --> 3:24:56.160
 I want to live forever.

3:24:56.160 --> 3:24:57.160
 I'm not going to live forever.

3:24:57.160 --> 3:24:59.160
 I don't want to, I don't want to suffer.

3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:01.160
 I see people suffering.

3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:08.160
 I saw my late wife, Linda Datcher Lowry, Dr. Linda Datcher Lowry, professor of economics

3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:12.160
 at Tufts University, whom I met in graduate school at MIT.

3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:14.160
 Black woman from Baltimore.

3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:15.160
 We married.

3:25:15.160 --> 3:25:17.160
 We raised two sons together.

3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:22.160
 She died at the age of 59 from metastatic breast cancer.

3:25:22.160 --> 3:25:24.160
 And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.

3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:27.160
 And it took a while.

3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:30.160
 And we care for her at home right up until the very end.

3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:35.160
 She died in our bed with our sons on either side of her.

3:25:35.160 --> 3:25:41.160
 And the dog curled up by the door, the porch door in the bedroom.

3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:43.160
 And she expired.

3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:46.160
 And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.

3:25:46.160 --> 3:25:47.160
 I don't want to suffer.

3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:48.160
 Who does?

3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:50.160
 I don't want to die.

3:25:50.160 --> 3:25:54.160
 I am likely to suffer before I die.

3:25:54.160 --> 3:26:00.160
 I am likely to see my death coming and to lament it.

3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:07.160
 There's a book by Richard John Newhouse, the theologian, called As I Lay Dying.

3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:12.160
 As I Lay Dying, Richard John Newhouse.

3:26:12.160 --> 3:26:18.160
 He had stomach cancer and he thought he was dying and he wrote this book as he lay dying.

3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:20.160
 And then he recovered.

3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:24.160
 He went into remission and he had another couple of years.

3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:27.160
 He thought he was dying and he had another couple of years.

3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:34.160
 And I can remember meeting him at a bookstore in suburban Boston when he was on a tour.

3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:39.160
 He was just a friend of mine, a theologian and a public intellectual.

3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:45.160
 He founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life in New York City, which still exists,

3:26:45.160 --> 3:26:47.160
 Richard John Newhouse.

3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:51.160
 And he's contemplating his own death from the point of view of a Christian minister.

3:26:51.160 --> 3:26:57.160
 He was first a Lutheran pastor and then he converted to Catholicism or as he would have put it,

3:26:57.160 --> 3:27:01.160
 I returned to the church because he thought the Renaissance was over.

3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:03.160
 I mean, I'm sorry, the Reformation.

3:27:03.160 --> 3:27:11.160
 Richard thought it was over since there's only one church, et cetera, getting into theology stuff here.

3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:18.160
 But I'm saying all that to say, I read that book aloud to my wife, Linda, as she lay dying in that bed.

3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:22.160
 I read that book and it was filled with hope.

3:27:22.160 --> 3:27:26.160
 I mean, it first acknowledged the dread.

3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:28.160
 I lie dying.

3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:29.160
 I don't want to die.

3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:31.160
 I'm a Christian minister.

3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:32.160
 Christ was raised from the dead.

3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:34.160
 I'm supposed to believe in everlasting life.

3:27:34.160 --> 3:27:37.160
 But the fact of the matter is this is me and I'm lying here and I'm dying.

3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:39.160
 This is the end of me.

3:27:39.160 --> 3:27:43.160
 How are you going to do anything other than dread the end of me?

3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:45.160
 So let's acknowledge that I don't want to die.

3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:47.160
 Okay, I'm just going to tell you that up front.

3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:55.160
 But that is not the end of my death is not the end of life.

3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:57.160
 I have lived well and fully.

3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:01.160
 I will go and do my best right up until the end.

3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:08.160
 I will accept what is inevitable and I will hold out this belief and he's a Christian minister.

3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:11.160
 So he holds out this belief and he knows that the belief is not rational.

3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:16.160
 It's not a reasoned deductive scientific conclusion.

3:28:16.160 --> 3:28:20.160
 It's spiritual in the most fundamental way.

3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:26.160
 It is something that people hold on to and they have hope and he had hope.

3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:29.160
 I don't know if I have that hope.

3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:39.160
 I used to be, but I'm no longer a Christian and I'm no longer a theist really.

3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:42.160
 I'm with Lucretius there.

3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:46.160
 I mean, there's no magic that's going on here.

3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:50.160
 There's no unseen hand behind the scene that's arranging things.

3:28:50.160 --> 3:28:56.160
 What I believe is that when I look at the natural world, I see the evolution of the species.

3:28:56.160 --> 3:28:59.160
 I see the organic development of the of the planets.

3:28:59.160 --> 3:29:04.160
 I mean, the earth is going to not exist in a finite number of years.

3:29:04.160 --> 3:29:08.160
 I think with our very high probability, the sun is going to die.

3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:10.160
 It's going to, you know, implode.

3:29:10.160 --> 3:29:17.160
 It's going to go supernova, whatever is going to happen and there's not going to be any there there.

3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:19.160
 What's the meaning of life, Glen Laurie?

3:29:19.160 --> 3:29:21.160
 That's the meaning of life.

3:29:21.160 --> 3:29:22.160
 Yeah.

3:29:22.160 --> 3:29:23.160
 Let's go.

3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:24.160
 Let's go.

3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:26.160
 What's the why?

3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:33.160
 Or is that something economists and social scientists and mathematicians are not equipped to answer?

3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:34.160
 Surely.

3:29:34.160 --> 3:29:39.160
 You know, I think we live, we try to live well and meaningfully within our time.

3:29:39.160 --> 3:29:48.160
 We bond, we reproduce, we try to pass on and we accept our limitations and our mortality.

3:29:48.160 --> 3:30:00.160
 We try to contribute and that's through our children and through our work.

3:30:00.160 --> 3:30:02.160
 And we're in this together.

3:30:02.160 --> 3:30:04.160
 We're not in this alone.

3:30:04.160 --> 3:30:08.160
 We are connected to other people.

3:30:08.160 --> 3:30:11.160
 I get a lot of gratitude out of teaching.

3:30:11.160 --> 3:30:13.160
 I'm a teacher.

3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:16.160
 My students are going to outlive me.

3:30:16.160 --> 3:30:18.160
 They're going to have students.

3:30:18.160 --> 3:30:19.160
 I'm a writer.

3:30:19.160 --> 3:30:21.160
 My writing is going to outlive me.

3:30:21.160 --> 3:30:25.160
 I don't want to be, you know, self important or pretentious here.

3:30:25.160 --> 3:30:29.160
 I doubt that I'm going to be the James Joyce of the 21st century.

3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:38.160
 They may not be reading my stuff in 100 years as people will certainly be reading Ulysses in 100 years.

3:30:38.160 --> 3:30:47.160
 But I try to have an impact on the world that I'm a part of and try to leave a legacy that's dignified.

3:30:47.160 --> 3:30:49.160
 You know, I mean, I could give some flowery words.

3:30:49.160 --> 3:30:51.160
 Truth seeking and whatnot.

3:30:51.160 --> 3:30:52.160
 What about love?

3:30:52.160 --> 3:30:54.160
 Love.

3:30:54.160 --> 3:30:59.160
 What role does love play in this light thing?

3:30:59.160 --> 3:31:01.160
 Love makes the world go round.

3:31:01.160 --> 3:31:03.160
 Without love, what have we got?

3:31:03.160 --> 3:31:18.160
 I mean, we don't have family and, you know, we certainly have missed out if love is not a central part of our existence.

3:31:18.160 --> 3:31:22.160
 But stop asking me questions like that.

3:31:22.160 --> 3:31:29.160
 Glenn, thank you for doing everything you do, for thinking the way you do, for being fearless and bold.

3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:35.160
 And in the Glenn show and your writing and in your work and just being who you are, thank you for being you.

3:31:35.160 --> 3:31:40.160
 And thank you for giving me the huge honor of spending your extremely valuable time with me today.

3:31:40.160 --> 3:31:41.160
 This was awesome.

3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:42.160
 It's been my pleasure, Lex.

3:31:42.160 --> 3:31:43.160
 I mean, really.

3:31:43.160 --> 3:31:45.160
 And it has been like four hours, man.

3:31:45.160 --> 3:31:47.160
 You're wearing me out for me.

3:31:47.160 --> 3:31:49.160
 I love it.

3:31:49.160 --> 3:31:52.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Glenn Lowry.

 Now, let me leave you with some words from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

3:32:00.160 --> 3:32:02.160
 If you can't fly, then run.

3:32:02.160 --> 3:32:05.160
 If you can't run, then walk.

3:32:05.160 --> 3:32:07.160
 If you can't walk, then crawl.

3:32:07.160 --> 3:32:12.160
 But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.

3:32:12.160 --> 3:32:27.160
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
