 The following is a conversation with Joe Bowler,

00:02.720 --> 00:04.840
 a mathematics educator at Stanford

00:04.840 --> 00:08.080
 and cofounder of ucubed.org

00:08.080 --> 00:10.080
 that seeks to inspire young minds

00:10.080 --> 00:12.520
 with the beauty of mathematics.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.040

00:17.140 --> 00:19.360
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

00:19.360 --> 00:22.420
 and here is my conversation with Joe Bowler.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.200
 What to you is beautiful about mathematics?

00:27.200 --> 00:30.400
 I love a mathematics that some people

00:30.400 --> 00:32.720
 don't even think of as mathematics,

00:32.720 --> 00:37.640
 which is beautiful creative mathematics

00:37.640 --> 00:39.520
 where we look at maths in different ways.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.240
 We visualize it.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.680
 We think about different solutions to problems.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.120
 A lot of people think of maths

00:46.120 --> 00:49.560
 as you have one method and one answer.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.160
 And what I love about maths

00:51.160 --> 00:54.000
 is the multiple different ways you can see things.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.760
 Different methods, different ways of seeing, different.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.160
 In some cases, different solutions.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.120
 So that is what is beautiful to me about mathematics

01:02.120 --> 01:05.800
 that you can see and solve it in many different ways.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.960
 And also the sad part that many people think

01:09.960 --> 01:13.800
 that maths is just one answer and one method.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.320
 So to you, the beauty emerges

01:16.320 --> 01:18.520
 when you have a problem with a solution

01:18.520 --> 01:21.080
 and you start adding other solutions.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.680
 Simpler solutions, weirder solutions,

01:24.680 --> 01:26.520
 more interesting, some of their visuals,

01:26.520 --> 01:29.160
 some of their algebraic geometry,

01:29.160 --> 01:30.120
 all that kind of stuff.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.040
 Yeah, I always say that you can take any maths area

01:34.040 --> 01:35.400
 and make it visual.

01:35.400 --> 01:39.920
 And we say to teachers, give us your most dry, boring maths

01:39.920 --> 01:43.240
 and we'll make it a visual, interesting, creative problem.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.920
 And turns out you can do that with any area of maths.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.640
 And I think we've given,

01:49.640 --> 01:51.720
 it's been a great disservice to kids and others

01:51.720 --> 01:56.160
 that it's always been numbers, lots and lots of numbers,

01:56.160 --> 01:57.080
 numbers can be great,

01:57.080 --> 02:01.040
 but you can think about maths in other ways besides numbers.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.080
 Do you find that most people are better visual learners

02:05.080 --> 02:08.360
 or is this just something that's complementary?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.040
 What's the kind of the full spectrum of students

02:11.040 --> 02:13.400
 in the way they like to explore math, would you say?

02:13.400 --> 02:17.520
 There's definitely people who come into the classes I do

02:17.520 --> 02:19.760
 who are more interested in visual thinking

02:19.760 --> 02:21.960
 and like visual approaches.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.680
 But it turns out what the neuroscience is telling us

02:24.680 --> 02:26.680
 is that when we think about maths,

02:26.680 --> 02:29.120
 there are two visual pathways in the brain

02:29.120 --> 02:32.760
 and we should all be thinking about it visually.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.400
 Some approaches have been to say,

02:34.400 --> 02:35.960
 well, you're a visual learner,

02:35.960 --> 02:40.600
 so we'll give you visuals and you're not a visual learner.

02:40.600 --> 02:45.080
 But actually, if you think you're not a visual learner,

02:45.080 --> 02:48.840
 it's probably more important that you have a visual approach.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.520
 So you can develop that part of your brain.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.880
 So you were saying that there's some kind

02:52.880 --> 02:54.480
 of interconnected aspect to it.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.680
 So the visual connects with the non visual.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.840
 Yeah, so this is what the neuroscience has shown us,

02:59.840 --> 03:01.160
 that when you work on a maths problem,

03:01.160 --> 03:03.480
 there are five different brain pathways

03:03.480 --> 03:06.720
 and that the most high achieving people in the world

03:06.720 --> 03:08.440
 are people who have more connections

03:08.440 --> 03:10.440
 between these pathways.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.840
 So if you see a maths problem with numbers,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.880
 but you also see it visually,

03:15.880 --> 03:18.000
 that will cause a connection to happen in your brain

03:18.000 --> 03:19.840
 between these pathways.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.080
 And if you maybe write about it with words,

03:22.080 --> 03:23.360
 that would cause another connection

03:23.360 --> 03:26.440
 or maybe you build it with something physical

03:26.440 --> 03:28.360
 that would cause a different connection.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.040
 And what we want for kids is,

03:31.040 --> 03:33.640
 we call it a multi dimensional experience of maths,

03:33.640 --> 03:35.480
 seeing it in different ways,

03:35.480 --> 03:37.840
 experiencing it in different ways.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.600
 That will cause that great connected brain.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.280
 You know, there's these stories of physicists doing the same.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.200
 I find physicists are often better at building

03:46.200 --> 03:49.000
 that part of their brain of using visualization

03:49.000 --> 03:50.600
 for intuition building,

03:50.600 --> 03:54.240
 because you ultimately want to understand

03:54.240 --> 03:57.040
 the deepest secret underneath this problem.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.760
 And for that, you have to sit into it your way there.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.720
 And you mentioned offline that one of the ways

04:02.720 --> 04:03.720
 you might approach a problem

04:03.720 --> 04:05.840
 is to try to tell a story about it.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.760
 And some of it is like legend,

04:07.760 --> 04:10.520
 but I'm sure it's not always,

04:10.520 --> 04:15.320
 is you have Einstein thinking about a train,

04:15.320 --> 04:16.680
 and the speed of light,

04:16.680 --> 04:20.000
 and that kind of intuition is useful.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
 You start to imagine a physical world.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.280
 Like how does this idea manifest itself in the physical world,

04:26.280 --> 04:28.880
 and then start playing in your mind with that physical world,

04:28.880 --> 04:30.240
 and think, is this going to be true?

04:30.240 --> 04:31.560
 Is this going to be true?

04:31.560 --> 04:35.840
 Right, Einstein is well known for thinking visually.

04:35.840 --> 04:40.920
 And people talk about how he really didn't want to go anywhere

04:40.920 --> 04:43.280
 with problems without thinking about them visually.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.400
 But the other thing you mentioned that sparked something for me

04:46.400 --> 04:48.800
 is thinking with intuition,

04:48.800 --> 04:51.400
 like having intuition about math problems.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.080
 That's another thing that's often absent in math class,

04:54.080 --> 04:55.840
 the idea that you might think about a problem

04:55.840 --> 05:00.760
 and use your intuition, but so important.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.840
 And when mathematicians are interviewed,

05:02.840 --> 05:05.160
 they will very frequently talk about the role of intuition

05:05.160 --> 05:07.200
 in solving problems,

05:07.200 --> 05:12.200
 but not commonly acknowledged or brought into education.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.680
 Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.

05:14.680 --> 05:19.480
 Like if you task yourself with building an intuition

05:19.480 --> 05:23.720
 about a problem, that's where you start to pull in,

05:23.720 --> 05:27.160
 like what is the pattern I'm seeing?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.600
 And in order to understand the pattern,

05:28.600 --> 05:31.760
 you might want to then start utilizing visualization.

05:31.760 --> 05:37.240
 But ultimately, that's all in service of like solving the puzzle,

05:37.240 --> 05:40.400
 like cracking it open to get the simple explanation

05:40.400 --> 05:43.760
 of why things are the way they are,

05:43.760 --> 05:46.160
 as opposed to, like you said,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.640
 having a particular algorithm

05:47.640 --> 05:50.160
 that you can then execute to solve the problem.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.160
 Yeah, but it's hard.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.000
 It's hard.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.560
 Like reasoning is really hard.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.160
 Yeah, it's hard.

05:55.160 --> 05:58.840
 I mean, I love to value what's hard in maths

05:58.840 --> 06:00.600
 instead of being afraid of it.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.480
 We know that when you struggle,

06:02.480 --> 06:04.520
 that's actually a really good time for your brain.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.280
 You want to be struggling when you're thinking about things.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.080
 So if it's hard to think intuitively about something,

06:10.080 --> 06:13.640
 that's probably a really good time for your brain.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.720
 I used to work with somebody called Sebastian Thrun,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.560
 who's a great sort of mathematician,

06:19.560 --> 06:21.240
 you might think of him as AI person.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.760
 And I remember in one interview I did with him,

06:23.760 --> 06:25.800
 he talked about how they'd built robots,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.600
 I think for the Smithsonian,

06:27.600 --> 06:29.360
 and how they were having this trouble

06:29.360 --> 06:32.360
 with them picking up white noise.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.560
 And he said they had to solve it.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.440
 They had to work out what's going on

06:36.440 --> 06:41.320
 and how he intuitively worked out what the problem was.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.600
 But then it took him three weeks to show it mathematically.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.040
 I thought that was really interesting

06:47.040 --> 06:49.640
 that how you can have this intuition

06:49.640 --> 06:51.800
 and know something works,

06:51.800 --> 06:53.400
 it's kind of different from going through

06:53.400 --> 06:57.040
 that long mathematical process of proving it.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.280
 But so important.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.640
 Yeah, I think probably our brains are evolved

07:01.640 --> 07:03.960
 as like intuition machines.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.920
 And the math of like showing it like formally

07:08.920 --> 07:12.120
 is probably an extra thing that we're not designed for.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.920
 You see that with Feynman and his,

07:14.920 --> 07:16.960
 I mean, just all of these physicists,

07:16.960 --> 07:21.120
 definitely you see starting with intuition,

07:21.120 --> 07:23.480
 sometimes starting with an experiment,

07:24.480 --> 07:27.920
 and then the experiment inspires intuition.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.320
 But you can think of an experiment

07:29.320 --> 07:31.080
 as a kind of visualization.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.280
 Just like let's take whatever the heck we're looking at

07:34.280 --> 07:38.640
 and draw it and draw like the pattern as it evolves

07:38.640 --> 07:41.960
 as the thing grows for n equals one, for n equals two,

07:41.960 --> 07:44.800
 n equals three, you start to play with it.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.680
 And then in the modern day, which I loved doing

07:48.680 --> 07:52.440
 is you can write a program that then visualizes it for you.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.480
 And then you can start exploring it programmatically.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.160
 And then you can do so interactively too.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.560
 I tend to not like interactive

08:03.560 --> 08:05.680
 because it takes too much work.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.120
 You have to click and move and stuff.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.880
 I love to interact through writing programs.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.480
 That's my particular brain, software engineer.

08:12.480 --> 08:17.160
 So like you can do all these kinds of visualizations.

08:17.160 --> 08:21.040
 And then there's the tools of visualization like color,

08:21.040 --> 08:24.200
 all of those kinds of things that you're absolutely right.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.160
 They're actually not taught very much.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.760
 Like the art of visualization.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.000
 Not taught.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.680
 And we love as well color coding.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.440
 Like when you represent something mathematically,

08:36.440 --> 08:40.960
 you can show color to show the growth and kind of code that.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.240
 So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern,

08:44.240 --> 08:46.640
 maybe I show the X with a certain color,

08:46.640 --> 08:47.920
 but I also write in that color

08:47.920 --> 08:51.320
 so you can see the relationship.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.240
 Very cool.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.760
 And yeah, particularly in our work with elementary teachers,

08:56.760 --> 08:58.680
 many of them come to our workshops

08:58.680 --> 09:00.680
 and they're literally in tears

09:00.680 --> 09:03.800
 when they see things making sense visually

09:03.800 --> 09:05.840
 because they've spent their whole lives

09:05.840 --> 09:09.240
 and not realizing you can really understand things

09:09.240 --> 09:10.920
 with these visuals.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.720
 It's quite powerful.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.120
 You say that there's something about,

09:15.120 --> 09:17.840
 there's something valuable to learning

09:17.840 --> 09:21.640
 when the thing that you're doing is challenging, is difficult.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.000
 So a lot of people say, you know, math is hard

09:24.000 --> 09:28.080
 or math is too hard or too hard for me.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.400
 Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?

09:32.400 --> 09:36.160
 I think it's great when things are challenging,

09:36.160 --> 09:38.400
 but there's something that's really key

09:38.400 --> 09:42.040
 to being able to deal with challenging math

09:42.040 --> 09:46.000
 and that is knowing that you can do it.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.840
 And I think the problem in education

09:47.840 --> 09:50.240
 is a lot of people have got this idea

09:50.240 --> 09:53.120
 that you're either born with a math's brain or you're not.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.440
 So when they start to struggle, they think,

09:55.440 --> 09:57.600
 oh, I don't have that math's brain.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.800
 And then they will literally sort of switch off in their brain

10:00.800 --> 10:03.400
 and things will go downhill from that point.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.560
 So struggle becomes a lot easier

10:05.560 --> 10:10.400
 and you're able to struggle if you don't have that idea.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.800
 But you know that you can do it.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.360
 You have to go through this struggle to get there,

10:15.360 --> 10:18.160
 but you're able to do that.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.160
 And so we're hampered in being able to struggle

10:21.160 --> 10:24.600
 with these ideas we've been given about what we can do.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.360
 That's a difficult question here.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.200
 Yeah.

10:27.200 --> 10:32.000
 So there's kind of, I don't know what the right term is,

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
 but some people struggle with learning in different ways.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.480
 Like their brain is constructed in different ways.

10:42.480 --> 10:47.040
 And how much should, as educators,

10:47.040 --> 10:49.320
 should we make room for that?

10:49.320 --> 10:52.400
 So how do you know the difference between this is hard

10:52.400 --> 10:54.480
 and I don't like doing hard things

10:54.480 --> 10:57.120
 versus my brain is wired in a way

10:57.120 --> 10:59.080
 where I need to learn in very different ways.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.680
 I can't learn it this way.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.360
 How do you find that line?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.040
 How do you operate in that gray area?

11:04.040 --> 11:07.400
 So this is why being a teacher is so hard.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
 And people really don't appreciate

11:09.400 --> 11:12.320
 how difficult teaching is when you're faced with,

11:12.320 --> 11:14.800
 I don't know, 30 students who think in different ways.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.520
 But this is also why I believe it's so important

11:19.520 --> 11:22.000
 to have this multi dimensional approach to maths.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.720
 We've really offered it in one way,

11:24.720 --> 11:27.400
 which is here's some numbers in a method,

11:27.400 --> 11:31.240
 you follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.880
 And so there are some kids who like doing that

11:33.880 --> 11:34.920
 and they do well.

11:34.920 --> 11:39.160
 And a lot of kids who don't like doing it and don't do well.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.800
 But when you open up maths and you give,

11:42.800 --> 11:44.680
 you let kids experience it in different ways,

11:44.680 --> 11:47.720
 maybe visually with numbers, with words,

11:47.720 --> 11:50.000
 what happens is kids,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.480
 there are many more kids who can access it.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.200
 So those different brain wirings you're talking about,

11:56.200 --> 11:58.880
 where some people are just more able to do something

11:58.880 --> 12:00.280
 in a particular way,

12:00.280 --> 12:01.920
 that's why we want to,

12:01.920 --> 12:04.720
 that's one of the reasons we want to open it up.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.440
 So that there are different ways of accessing it.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.200
 And then that's not really a problem.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.480
 So I grew up in the Soviet Union

12:14.480 --> 12:17.440
 and fell in love with math early.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.840
 I was forced into math early

12:19.840 --> 12:22.400
 and fell in love through force.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.240
 That's good.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.840
 Well, you fell in love without the force.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.400
 Well, but there's something we talked about a little bit

12:28.400 --> 12:33.400
 is there is such a value for excellence.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.960
 It's competitive and it's also everybody kind of looks up.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.960
 The definition of success is being in a particular class

12:44.480 --> 12:46.360
 is being really good at it.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.960
 And it's not improving, it's like being really good.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.800
 I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.880
 We're not, it's like it's understood,

12:56.880 --> 12:59.760
 you're going to star on the basketball team.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.400
 If you're gonna start on the basketball team,

13:02.400 --> 13:05.120
 if you're going to be better than the other guys,

13:05.120 --> 13:06.520
 the other girls on the team.

13:07.640 --> 13:12.200
 So that coupled with the belief,

13:12.200 --> 13:14.680
 this could be partially a communist belief, I don't know,

13:14.680 --> 13:19.200
 but the belief that everybody is capable of being great.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.240
 But if you're not great, that's your fault.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.440
 And you need to work harder.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.960
 And I remember I had a sense that probably delusional,

13:27.960 --> 13:29.640
 but I could win a Nobel Prize.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.440
 I don't even know what that entails.

13:33.080 --> 13:38.080
 But I thought like my dad early on told me just off hand

13:39.560 --> 13:42.520
 and it always stuck with me that if you can figure out

13:42.520 --> 13:46.120
 how to build a time machine, how to travel back in time,

13:46.120 --> 13:48.400
 it will probably give you a Nobel Prize.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.400
 And I remember early in my life thinking,

13:50.400 --> 13:52.520
 I'm going to invent the time machine.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.720
 And like the tools of mathematics were in service

13:56.720 --> 14:00.040
 of that dream of winning the Nobel Prize.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.160
 It's silly.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.520
 I didn't really think in those concrete terms,

14:03.520 --> 14:06.800
 but I just thought I could be great, that feeling.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
 And then when you struggle,

14:08.680 --> 14:13.160
 the belief that you could be great is like struggle is good.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.560
 Right, pushes you on, yeah.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.440
 And so the other thing about the Soviet system

14:17.440 --> 14:20.520
 that might love to hear your comments about

14:20.520 --> 14:23.840
 is just the sheer like hours of math.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.720
 Like the number of courses you're talking about,

14:26.720 --> 14:29.280
 a lot of geometry, a lot more.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.640
 I think in the American system,

14:30.640 --> 14:33.080
 you take maybe one year of geometry.

14:33.080 --> 14:33.920
 In high school, yeah.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.240
 In high school.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.440
 First of all, geometry is beautiful, it's visual.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.080
 And then you get to reason through proofs

14:39.080 --> 14:40.160
 and stuff like that.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.400
 In Russia, I remember just being nailed over and over

14:43.400 --> 14:45.560
 with John, it was just nonstop.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.200
 And then of course, there's different perspectives

14:48.200 --> 14:50.360
 on calculus and just the whole,

14:50.360 --> 14:55.360
 the sense was that math is like fundamental

14:56.040 --> 14:58.640
 to the development of the human mind.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.440
 So math, but also science and literature, by the way,

15:02.440 --> 15:04.640
 was also hit very hard.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.240
 Like we read a lot of serious adult stuff.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.960
 America does that a little bit too.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.640
 They challenge young adults with good literature,

15:12.640 --> 15:16.160
 but they don't challenge adults very much with math.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.880
 So those two things, valuing excellence

15:20.880 --> 15:23.720
 and just a lot of math in the curriculum.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.920
 Do you think, do you find that interesting?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.560
 Because it seems to have been successful.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.200
 Yeah, I think that's very interesting.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.720
 And there is a lot of success

15:32.720 --> 15:34.120
 of people coming through the Soviet system.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.360
 I think something that's very different to the US

15:37.360 --> 15:39.480
 and other countries in the world

15:39.480 --> 15:41.960
 is that idea that excellence is important

15:41.960 --> 15:45.000
 and you can get there if you work hard.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.760
 In the US, there's an idea that excellence is important,

15:48.760 --> 15:52.200
 but then kids are given the idea in many ways

15:52.200 --> 15:53.800
 that you can either do it

15:53.800 --> 15:56.200
 or you're one of the people who can't.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.520
 So many students in the school system

15:58.520 --> 15:59.760
 think they're one of the kids who can't.

15:59.760 --> 16:02.360
 So there's no point in trying hard

16:02.360 --> 16:04.760
 because you're never going to get there.

16:04.760 --> 16:09.680
 So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.200
 And it seems from what you've said

16:11.200 --> 16:16.200
 in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.000
 Now, the downside of that idea

16:18.000 --> 16:21.680
 that anybody can get there if you work hard

16:21.680 --> 16:25.040
 is that thought that if you're not getting there,

16:25.040 --> 16:26.520
 it's your fault.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.680
 And I would add something into that.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.720
 I would say that anybody can get there,

16:31.800 --> 16:35.120
 but they need to work hard and they also need good teaching

16:35.120 --> 16:37.960
 because there are some people who really can't get there

16:37.960 --> 16:41.280
 because they're not given access to that good teaching.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.600
 So, but that would be huge, that change.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.480
 As to doing lots of maths,

16:46.480 --> 16:50.960
 if maths was interesting and open and creative

16:50.960 --> 16:53.760
 and multi dimensional, I would be all for it.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.040
 We actually run summer camps at Stanford

16:56.040 --> 16:59.080
 where we invite kids in and we give them this maths

16:59.080 --> 17:00.680
 that I love.

17:00.680 --> 17:05.320
 And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.440
 And when we were planning, the teachers were like three hours.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.480
 Are we gonna be able to keep the kids excited for three hours?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.960
 Turned out they didn't want to go to break or lunch.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.440
 They'd be so into these mathematical patterns.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.080
 We couldn't stop them.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.800
 It was amazing.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.200
 So yeah, if maths was more like that,

17:25.200 --> 17:29.040
 then I think having more of it would be a really good thing.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.000
 So what age are you talking about?

17:31.000 --> 17:35.520
 Is there, could you comment on what age is like

17:35.520 --> 17:39.160
 the most important when people quit math

17:39.160 --> 17:42.840
 or give up on themselves or on math in general?

17:42.840 --> 17:45.600
 And perhaps that age or something earlier

17:45.600 --> 17:48.640
 is really an important moment for them to discover,

17:48.640 --> 17:51.480
 to be inspired to discover the magic of math.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.440
 I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves

17:54.440 --> 17:59.240
 and maths around from about fifth grade.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.400
 And then those middle school years are really important.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.560
 And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids

18:04.560 --> 18:07.960
 just because they're allowed to explore

18:07.960 --> 18:11.480
 and think in good ways in the early grades

18:11.480 --> 18:12.320
 of elementary school.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.520
 But fifth grade teachers are often like,

18:13.520 --> 18:15.480
 okay, we're gonna prepare you now for middle school

18:15.480 --> 18:18.200
 and we're gonna give you grades and lots of tests.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.760
 And that's when kids start to feel really badly

18:21.760 --> 18:22.600
 about themselves.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.440
 And so middle school years,

18:24.440 --> 18:27.040
 we, our camps are middle school students.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.200
 We think of those years as really pivotal.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.640
 Many kids in those years are deciding,

18:31.640 --> 18:35.640
 yes, I'm gonna keep going with STEM subjects.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.320
 Or no, I'm not, that this isn't for me.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.800
 So, I mean, all years are important.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.120
 And in all years, you can kind of switch kids

18:43.120 --> 18:45.600
 and get them on a different pathway.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.400
 But I think those middle school years are really important.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.840
 So what's the role of the teacher in this?

18:50.840 --> 18:53.080
 So one is the explanation of the subject,

18:53.080 --> 18:58.080
 but do you think teachers should almost do like one on one,

18:58.080 --> 19:01.800
 you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?

19:01.800 --> 19:03.840
 Like that energy of like.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.360
 Turns out it's really important.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.480
 There's a study that was done,

19:07.480 --> 19:10.400
 it was actually done in high school English classrooms

19:10.400 --> 19:14.080
 where all kids wrote an essay for their teacher.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.040
 And this was done as an experiment.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.880
 Half of the kids got feedback from their teacher,

19:18.880 --> 19:21.080
 diagnostic feedback, which is great.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.360
 But for half of the kids, it said an extra sentence

19:23.360 --> 19:26.280
 at the bottom that the researchers had put on.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.040
 And the kids who read that extra sentence

19:30.040 --> 19:33.520
 did significantly better in English a whole year later.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.720
 The only change was this one sentence.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.680
 What did the sentence say?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.760
 So what did the sentence say?

19:39.760 --> 19:42.880
 The sentence said, I'm giving you this feedback

19:42.880 --> 19:44.160
 because I believe in you.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.680
 And the kids who read that did better a year later.

19:48.680 --> 19:49.520
 Yeah.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.360
 So when I share this with teachers,

19:52.360 --> 19:54.320
 I say, you know, I'm not suggesting you put on

19:54.320 --> 19:57.040
 the bottom of all kids work and giving this feedback.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.440
 So I believe in you.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.760
 One of the teachers said to me, we don't put it on a stamp.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.560
 I said, no, don't put it on a stamp.

20:03.560 --> 20:08.000
 It's, but your words are really important.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.120
 And kids are sitting in classrooms all the time

20:11.120 --> 20:13.920
 thinking, what does my teacher think of me?

20:13.920 --> 20:15.920
 Does my teacher think I can do this?

20:17.280 --> 20:20.520
 So it turns out it is really important to be saying to kids,

20:20.520 --> 20:22.600
 I know you can do this.

20:22.600 --> 20:27.600
 And those messages are not given enough by teachers.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.000
 And really believe it.

20:29.000 --> 20:29.840
 And believe it.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.680
 Yeah.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.520
 You can't just say it.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.840
 You have to believe it.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.400
 I sometimes, cause it's like,

20:36.560 --> 20:39.600
 it's such a funny dance cause I'm such a perfectionist.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.360
 I'm extremely self critical.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.640
 And I have one of the students come up to me

20:43.640 --> 20:48.640
 and it's clear to me that they're not even close to good.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.320
 And it's tempting for me to be like,

20:52.320 --> 20:54.360
 to sort of give up on them mentally.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.880
 But the reality is like,

20:55.880 --> 20:58.960
 if you look at many great people throughout history,

20:58.960 --> 21:00.360
 they sucked at some point.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.200
 Yeah, exactly.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.240
 And some of the greatest took nonlinear paths

21:04.240 --> 21:08.800
 to where they sucked for long into later life.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.440
 And so always kind of believing

21:10.440 --> 21:13.280
 that this person can be great.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.520
 Exactly.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.840
 You have to communicate that

21:15.840 --> 21:17.640
 plus the fact that they have to work hard.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.460
 That's it.

21:18.460 --> 21:19.300
 Yeah.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.140
 And you're right.

21:20.140 --> 21:21.480
 Silicon Valley, where I live,

21:21.480 --> 21:24.560
 is filled with people who are dropouts at school

21:24.560 --> 21:28.800
 or who had special needs, who didn't succeed.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.320
 It's very interesting that have gone on to do amazing work

21:32.320 --> 21:34.240
 in creative ways.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.640
 I mean, I do think our school system is set up

21:36.640 --> 21:41.640
 to value good memorizers who can reproduce

21:42.720 --> 21:44.760
 what a teacher is showing them

21:44.760 --> 21:49.200
 and push away those creative deep thinkers.

21:49.200 --> 21:53.640
 Often slower thinkers, they think slowly and deeply.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.380
 And they often get the idea early on

21:55.380 --> 21:59.040
 that they can't be good at maths or other subjects.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.360
 So yeah, I think many of those subject people

22:02.360 --> 22:05.200
 are the ones who go on and do amazing things.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.280
 So there's a guy named Eric Weinstein.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.840
 I know many mathematicians like this,

22:09.840 --> 22:14.840
 but he talks a lot about having a nonstandard way

22:16.080 --> 22:17.720
 of learning.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.760
 I mean, a lot of great mathematicians,

22:19.760 --> 22:22.160
 a lot of great physicists are like that.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.720
 And he felt like he became quickly,

22:24.720 --> 22:26.440
 he got his PhD at Harvard,

22:26.440 --> 22:28.640
 he became quickly an outcast of the system.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.280
 Like the education, especially early education system

22:32.280 --> 22:33.220
 didn't help him.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.920
 Is there a ways for an education system

22:37.920 --> 22:40.360
 to support people like that?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.480
 Is it this kind of multi dimensional learning

22:42.480 --> 22:43.320
 that you're mentioning?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.360
 Absolutely, absolutely.

22:44.360 --> 22:48.120
 I mean, I think education system still uses an approach

22:48.120 --> 22:50.400
 that was in classrooms hundreds of years ago.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.800
 The textbooks have a lot to answer for

22:53.800 --> 22:57.560
 in producing this very uninspiring mathematics.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.800
 But yeah, if you open up the subject

23:00.800 --> 23:03.040
 and have people see and solve it in different ways

23:03.040 --> 23:05.400
 and value those different ways,

23:05.400 --> 23:08.160
 somebody I appreciated a lot is a mathematician

23:08.160 --> 23:10.640
 called Marion Mizakani, I don't know if you've heard of her.

23:10.640 --> 23:14.560
 She won the Fields Medal, she was from Iran.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.640
 First woman in the world to win the Fields Medal

23:16.640 --> 23:19.560
 in mathematics, she died when she was 40,

23:19.560 --> 23:21.320
 she was at Stanford.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.920
 But her work was entirely visual.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.880
 And she talked about how her daughter thought

23:27.880 --> 23:30.760
 she was an artist because she was always visualizing.

23:30.760 --> 23:35.760
 And I attended, she asked me to chair the PhD defense

23:35.880 --> 23:37.520
 for one of her students.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.360
 And I went to the defense in the math department

23:40.360 --> 23:43.560
 and it was so interesting because this young woman

23:43.560 --> 23:46.840
 spent like two hours sharing her work,

23:46.840 --> 23:47.880
 all of it was visual.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.560
 In fact, I don't think I saw any numbers at all.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.400
 That's awesome.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.080
 And I remember that day thinking, wow,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.000
 I could have brought her like 13 year old

23:56.000 --> 24:00.360
 into this PhD defense, they would not recognize this as maths.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.800
 But when Marion Mizakani won the Fields Medal,

24:03.800 --> 24:05.720
 all these other mathematicians were saying

24:05.720 --> 24:08.000
 that her work had connected

24:08.000 --> 24:11.280
 all these previously unconnected areas of maths.

24:11.280 --> 24:15.080
 And so, but when she was, she also shared

24:15.080 --> 24:17.720
 that when she was in school, when she was about 13,

24:17.720 --> 24:21.120
 she was told that she couldn't do maths.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.760
 She was told that by her teacher.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.120
 And this is Iran, and she grew up in Iran.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.400
 So I love that, to be told you can't be good at maths

24:29.400 --> 24:33.920
 and then go on and win the Fields Medal is cool.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.200
 I've been told by a lot of people in my life

24:37.200 --> 24:38.280
 that I can't do something.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.880
 I'm very definitely nonstandard.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.440
 But all it takes, that's why people talk about

24:44.440 --> 24:46.400
 like the one teacher that changed everything.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.240
 That's right.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.080
 All it takes is one teacher.

24:48.080 --> 24:48.920
 That's right.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.480
 That's the power of that.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.880
 So that should be inspiring to teachers.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.640
 I think it is.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.040
 You as a single person, given the education system,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.720
 given the incentives, you have the power

25:01.720 --> 25:03.280
 to truly change lives.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.960
 In like 20 years from now,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.920
 I feel as a medalist will walk up to you and say thank you.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.400
 So you did that for me.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.360
 Yeah, absolutely.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.160
 And I share that with teachers

25:12.160 --> 25:15.560
 that even in this broken system

25:15.560 --> 25:19.800
 of what they have to do for districts and textbooks,

25:19.800 --> 25:22.920
 a single teacher can change kids maths relationship

25:22.920 --> 25:26.480
 or other subjects and forever.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.600
 What's the role of the parents in this picture?

25:29.600 --> 25:31.640
 Let's go to another difficult subject.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.120
 Yeah, that is a difficult subject.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.120
 One study found that

25:38.440 --> 25:42.760
 the amount of maths anxiety parents had

25:42.760 --> 25:45.400
 predicted their child's achievement in school,

25:46.680 --> 25:50.400
 but only if they helped with homework.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.120
 So...

25:54.120 --> 25:55.280
 Oh, that's so funny.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.120
 Yeah.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.080
 There were some interesting implications for this.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.480
 I mean, you can see how it works.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.720
 If you have maths anxiety

26:01.720 --> 26:03.120
 and you're helping your kids with homework,

26:03.120 --> 26:05.480
 you're probably communicating things like,

26:05.480 --> 26:07.360
 I was terrible at this at school

26:08.360 --> 26:11.640
 and that's how it gets passed on to kids.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.760
 So one implication is if you have a really bad relationship,

26:15.760 --> 26:18.080
 maths, you hate maths, you have maths anxiety,

26:18.080 --> 26:22.360
 and maths anxiety just don't do maths homework with your kids.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.920
 But we have a, on our website,

26:25.920 --> 26:28.560
 we have a little sheet for parents

26:28.560 --> 26:32.640
 of ways to interact around maths with your kids.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.800
 And...

26:33.800 --> 26:36.640
 That's ucubed.org.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.360
 That's ucubed.org, yes.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.000
 So one of the things I say to parents

26:41.000 --> 26:43.040
 from when I do parent presentations is,

26:43.040 --> 26:44.720
 even if you hate maths,

26:44.720 --> 26:46.800
 you need to just fake it with your kids.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.000
 You should be always endlessly optimistic

26:50.000 --> 26:52.240
 and happy about doing maths.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.080
 And...

26:54.080 --> 26:55.480
 I'm always curious about this.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.880
 So I, you know, I hope to have kids one day.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.280
 I don't have kids currently.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.120
 Are parents okay with like sucking at math

27:04.120 --> 27:07.000
 and then trying to get their kid to be better

27:07.000 --> 27:07.880
 than them, essentially?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.040
 Like, is that difficult thing for a lot of parents?

27:10.040 --> 27:10.920
 It is difficult.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.840
 To have like, it's almost like an ego thing.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.160
 Like, I never got good at this

27:15.160 --> 27:16.880
 and I probably should have.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.880
 And yeah, I mean, to me that you want to celebrate that,

27:20.880 --> 27:23.880
 but I know a lot of people struggle with that.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.000
 Like coaches in sports,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.720
 to make an athlete become better than them,

27:29.720 --> 27:31.840
 it can be hard on the ego.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.760
 Yeah.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.760
 So is that, do you experience the same with parents too?

27:35.760 --> 27:38.080
 I think, I mean, I haven't experienced parents

27:38.080 --> 27:40.840
 worrying that their kids will be better than them.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.880
 I have experienced,

27:42.880 --> 27:45.640
 I have experienced parents

27:45.640 --> 27:48.000
 just having a really bad relationship with maths

27:48.000 --> 27:50.360
 and, you know, not wanting to help,

27:50.360 --> 27:54.080
 not knowing how to help, saying things.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.040
 Like another study showed that when mothers say

27:57.040 --> 28:00.160
 to their daughters, I was bad at maths in school,

28:00.160 --> 28:02.520
 their daughters achievement goes down.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.360
 So we know that kids pick up on these messages

28:05.360 --> 28:08.480
 and which is why I say you should fake it.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.640
 But also I know that lots of people have just had

28:10.640 --> 28:12.400
 a really bad relationship with maths,

28:12.400 --> 28:15.160
 even successful people.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.560
 The undergrads I teach at Stanford

28:17.560 --> 28:20.120
 have pretty much always done well in maths,

28:21.080 --> 28:24.080
 but they come to Stanford thinking maths

28:24.080 --> 28:27.040
 is a set of methods to memorize.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.480
 And so, so do many parents believe that.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.400
 There's one method that you memorize

28:34.400 --> 28:36.920
 and then you reproduce it.

28:36.920 --> 28:40.160
 So until people have really had an experience

28:40.160 --> 28:42.320
 of what I think of as the other maths,

28:42.320 --> 28:43.800
 but until they've really seen

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
 that it's a really different subject,

28:48.680 --> 28:51.320
 it's hard for them to be able to shift their kids

28:51.320 --> 28:52.680
 to see it differently.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.160
 Is there for a teacher, if we're to like systematize it,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.840
 is there something teachers can do

28:59.840 --> 29:01.480
 to do this more effectively?

29:01.480 --> 29:04.160
 So you mentioned the textbook.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.800
 So what are the additional things you can add

29:07.800 --> 29:10.680
 on top of this whole old school traditional way

29:10.680 --> 29:14.720
 of teaching that can improve the process?

29:14.720 --> 29:17.560
 So I do think there's a way of teaching maths

29:17.560 --> 29:21.680
 that changes everything for kids and teachers.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.480
 So I'm one of five writers of a new framework

29:25.480 --> 29:27.560
 for the State of California new maths framework.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.240
 It's coming out next year.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.280
 And we are recommending through this maths framework

29:32.280 --> 29:33.880
 that people teach in this way.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.520
 It's called teaching to big ideas.

29:37.520 --> 29:42.520
 So at the moment, people have standards

29:42.520 --> 29:43.480
 that have been written.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.800
 And then textbooks have taken these standards

29:45.800 --> 29:48.880
 and made not very good questions.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.520
 And if you look at the standards,

29:50.520 --> 29:53.040
 like I have some written down here,

29:53.040 --> 29:54.560
 just reading the standards,

29:54.560 --> 29:57.800
 it makes maths seem really boring and uninspiring.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.960
 What are the kind of, can you give a few examples?

30:00.960 --> 30:03.200
 So this is an interesting example.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.200
 In third grade, there are three different standards

30:06.200 --> 30:07.680
 about unit squares.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.680
 Okay.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.640
 So this is one of them.

30:12.640 --> 30:16.160
 A square with side length one unit called a unit square

30:16.160 --> 30:18.840
 is said to have one square unit of area

30:18.840 --> 30:20.600
 and can be used to measure area.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.440
 And that's something you're expected to learn.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.600
 That is something, so that's a standard.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.920
 The textbook authors say,

30:26.920 --> 30:28.440
 oh, I'm gonna make a question about that.

30:28.440 --> 30:32.200
 And they translate the standards into narrow questions.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.320
 And then you measure success

30:33.320 --> 30:36.920
 by your ability to deliver on these standards.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.120
 So the standards themselves,

30:39.120 --> 30:41.840
 I think of maths and many people think maths in this way

30:41.840 --> 30:44.800
 as a subject of like a few big ideas

30:44.800 --> 30:47.120
 and really important connections between them.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.440
 So like, you could think of it as like a network map

30:50.440 --> 30:52.640
 of ideas and connections.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.840
 And what standards do is they take that beautiful map

30:55.840 --> 30:57.520
 and they chop it up like this

30:57.520 --> 30:58.760
 into lots of little pieces

30:58.760 --> 31:01.040
 and they deliver the pieces to schools.

31:01.040 --> 31:05.320
 And so teachers don't see the connections between ideas

31:05.320 --> 31:06.480
 nor do the kids.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.440
 So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying

31:08.440 --> 31:11.920
 that what we've done in this new initiative

31:11.920 --> 31:16.160
 is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas

31:16.160 --> 31:17.560
 and connections between them.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.920
 So this is a grade three.

31:20.920 --> 31:25.200
 So instead of there being 60 standards,

31:25.200 --> 31:29.720
 we've said, well, you can pull these different standards

31:29.720 --> 31:32.240
 to get in with each other

31:32.240 --> 31:37.240
 and also value the ways these are connected.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.880
 And by the way, for people who are just listening,

31:39.880 --> 31:44.040
 we're looking at a small number of like big concepts

31:44.040 --> 31:46.440
 within mathematics, square towels,

31:46.440 --> 31:49.080
 measuring fraction, shape and time

31:49.080 --> 31:51.560
 and then how they're interconnected.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.040
 And so the goal is for, this is for grade three,

31:54.040 --> 31:55.080
 for example.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.000
 Yeah, and so we've set out for the state of California,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.560
 the whole of mathematics K10

32:02.560 --> 32:05.160
 as a set of big ideas and connections.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.520
 So we know that teachers, it works really well

32:08.520 --> 32:13.520
 if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.200
 And instead of reading five procedural statements

32:19.200 --> 32:20.840
 that involve measuring,

32:20.840 --> 32:22.600
 they think, okay, measuring is a big idea.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.400
 What rich deep activity can I use

32:25.400 --> 32:27.920
 that teaches measuring to kids?

32:27.920 --> 32:30.480
 And as kids work on these deep rich activities,

32:30.480 --> 32:32.640
 maybe over a few days,

32:32.640 --> 32:34.960
 turns out a lot of maths comes into it.

32:35.840 --> 32:40.120
 So we're recommending that let's not teach maths

32:40.120 --> 32:43.440
 according to all these multiple, multiple statements

32:43.440 --> 32:45.600
 and lots and lots of short questions.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.120
 Instead, let's teach maths by thinking about

32:48.120 --> 32:49.280
 what are the big ideas

32:49.280 --> 32:52.280
 and what are really rich deep activities

32:52.280 --> 32:53.760
 that teach those big ideas.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.920
 So that's the like how you teach it

32:55.920 --> 32:57.640
 and maximize learning.

32:57.640 --> 33:01.480
 What about like from a school district perspective,

33:01.480 --> 33:04.280
 like measuring how well you're doing,

33:04.280 --> 33:07.040
 you know, grades and tests and stuff like that.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.080
 Do you throw those out or is it possible?

33:09.080 --> 33:13.520
 I am not a fan of grades and tests myself.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.960
 I think grades are fine

33:15.960 --> 33:19.040
 if they're used at the end of a course.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.840
 So at the end of my maths course, I might get a grade

33:21.840 --> 33:24.400
 because a grade is meant to be a summative measure.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.720
 It kind of describes your summative achievement.

33:27.720 --> 33:31.360
 But the problem we have in maths classrooms across the US

33:31.360 --> 33:34.400
 is people use grades all the time, every week

33:34.400 --> 33:36.400
 or every day even.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.600
 My own kids, when they went through high school,

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
 technology has not helped with this.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.840
 When they went through high school,

33:41.840 --> 33:42.920
 they knew they were being graded

33:42.920 --> 33:45.960
 for everything they did, everything.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.200
 And not only were they being graded for everything,

33:48.200 --> 33:50.440
 but they could see it in the grade book online

33:50.440 --> 33:52.960
 and it would alter every class they went into.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.640
 So this is the ultimate what I think of

33:55.640 --> 33:57.520
 as a performance culture.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.120
 You're there to perform, somebody's measuring you,

34:00.120 --> 34:01.880
 you see your score.

34:03.760 --> 34:08.600
 So I think that's not conducive for deep learning.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.960
 And yes, have a grade at the end of the year,

34:10.960 --> 34:12.440
 but during the year,

34:12.440 --> 34:14.640
 you can assess kids in much better ways.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.720
 Like teachers can, a great way of assessing kids

34:18.720 --> 34:22.120
 is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines

34:22.120 --> 34:24.080
 what they're learning over the course of a unit

34:24.080 --> 34:25.840
 or a few weeks.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.840
 So kids can actually see the journey they're on.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.200
 Like this is what we're doing mathematically.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.440
 Sometimes they self assess on those units.

34:34.440 --> 34:39.440
 And then teachers will show what the kids can do

34:40.080 --> 34:42.240
 with a rubric and also write notes.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.640
 Like in the next few weeks,

34:43.640 --> 34:45.840
 you might like to learn to do this.

34:45.840 --> 34:50.600
 So instead of kids just thinking about I'm an A kid

34:50.600 --> 34:53.280
 or a B kid or I have this letter attached to me,

34:53.280 --> 34:57.000
 they're actually seeing mathematically what's important.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.680
 And they're involved in the process

34:58.680 --> 35:02.400
 of knowing where they are mathematically.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.880
 At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade,

35:04.880 --> 35:06.320
 but during the year,

35:06.320 --> 35:09.280
 they get these much more informative measures.

35:10.240 --> 35:14.840
 I do think this might be more for college,

35:14.840 --> 35:16.400
 but maybe not.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.720
 Some of the best classes I've had

35:18.720 --> 35:23.720
 is when I got a special set aside,

35:23.800 --> 35:27.920
 like the professor clearly saw that I was interested

35:27.920 --> 35:29.960
 in some aspect of a thing.

35:29.960 --> 35:34.960
 And then a few in mind and one in particular,

35:35.000 --> 35:38.160
 he said that he kind of challenged me.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.440
 So this is outside of grades and all that kind of stuff

35:41.440 --> 35:45.000
 that basically it's like reverse psychology.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.320
 I don't think this can be done.

35:47.320 --> 35:51.040
 And so I gave everything to do that particular thing.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.440
 So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.680
 But I think that like special treatment

35:57.680 --> 36:01.960
 of taking students who are especially like excellent

36:01.960 --> 36:03.560
 at a particular little aspect

36:03.560 --> 36:06.200
 that you see their eyes light up.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.560
 I often think like maybe it's tempting for a teacher

36:09.560 --> 36:11.760
 to think you've already succeeded there,

36:11.760 --> 36:13.480
 but they're actually signaling to you

36:13.480 --> 36:17.280
 that like you could really launch them on their way.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.640
 Yeah.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.960
 And I don't know,

36:19.960 --> 36:21.680
 that's too much to expect from teachers,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.960
 I think to pay attention to all of that

36:24.960 --> 36:26.000
 because it's really difficult.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.080
 But I just kind of remember who are the biggest,

36:30.080 --> 36:32.400
 the most important people in the history

36:32.400 --> 36:34.920
 of my life of education.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.120
 And it's those people that who really didn't just like

36:38.120 --> 36:40.440
 inspire me with their awesomeness, which they did,

36:40.440 --> 36:42.720
 but also just they pushed me a little,

36:42.720 --> 36:45.240
 like they gave me a little push.

36:45.240 --> 36:47.480
 And that requires focusing on the quote unquote,

36:47.480 --> 36:50.520
 excellent students in the class.

36:50.520 --> 36:51.360
 Yeah.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.840
 I think what's important though is teachers

36:53.840 --> 36:56.040
 to have the perspective that they don't know

36:56.040 --> 36:58.480
 who's gonna be excellent at something

36:58.480 --> 37:00.320
 before they give out the activity.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.160
 Exactly.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.760
 And in our camp classes that we ran,

37:05.720 --> 37:10.440
 sometimes students would finish ahead of other students.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.560
 And we would say to them,

37:12.560 --> 37:16.880
 can you write a question that's like this, but different?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.440
 Oh, and over time,

37:20.440 --> 37:24.800
 we encourage them to like extend things further.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
 I remember we were doing one activity

37:26.800 --> 37:30.160
 where kids were working out the borders of a square

37:30.160 --> 37:33.560
 and how big this border would be in different case sizes.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.280
 And one of the boys came up at the end of the class

37:36.280 --> 37:38.240
 and said, I've been thinking about

37:38.240 --> 37:40.440
 how you do this with a Pentagon.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.200
 And I said, that's fantastic.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.040
 How do you,

37:43.040 --> 37:44.400
 what does it look like with Pentagon?

37:44.400 --> 37:47.200
 Go find out, see if you can discover.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.720
 So I didn't know he was gonna come up and say that.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.720
 And I didn't have in my head,

37:52.720 --> 37:55.600
 like this is the kid who could have this extension task,

37:55.600 --> 37:58.720
 but you can still do that as a teacher

37:59.720 --> 38:01.320
 when kids get excited about something

38:01.320 --> 38:03.160
 or they're doing well in something,

38:03.160 --> 38:06.200
 have them extend it, go further.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.040
 It's great.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.480
 And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach,

38:10.480 --> 38:13.920
 you could say it in different ways to different students.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.280
 Like for me, the right thing to say is,

38:17.120 --> 38:20.280
 almost to say, I don't think you could do this.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.320
 This is too hard.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.080
 Like that's what I need to hear.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.360
 It's like, no, I, you know, there's immediate push,

38:26.360 --> 38:29.200
 but with some people, if they're a little bit more,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.200
 I mean, it's all has to do with upbringing,

38:31.200 --> 38:33.200
 how your genetics is.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.360
 They might be much more, that might break them.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.680
 Yeah, that might break them.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.360
 And so you have to be also sensitive to that.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.680
 I mean, teaching is really difficult.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.200
 It is really difficult.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.280
 For this very reason.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.280
 It is.

38:43.280 --> 38:47.800
 So what is the best way to teach math,

38:47.800 --> 38:50.840
 to learn math at those early few days

38:50.840 --> 38:52.640
 when you just want to capture them?

38:53.760 --> 38:54.880
 I do something.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.280
 Actually, there's a video of me doing this on our website

38:58.280 --> 39:03.240
 that I love when I first meet students.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.360
 And this is what I do.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.080
 I show them a picture.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.320
 This is the picture I show them.

39:08.320 --> 39:11.040
 And it's a picture of seven dots like this.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.800
 And I show it for just a few seconds and I say to them,

39:15.800 --> 39:17.720
 I'd like you to tell me how many dots there are,

39:17.720 --> 39:19.200
 but I don't need to count them.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.880
 I want to group the dots.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.200
 And I show it them and then I take it away

39:24.200 --> 39:27.160
 before they've even had enough time to count them.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.800
 And then I ask them, so how did you see it?

39:29.800 --> 39:34.800
 And I go around the room and amazingly enough,

39:34.800 --> 39:39.000
 there's probably 18 different ways of seeing these seven dots.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.040
 And so I ask people, tell me how you grouped it.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.120
 And some people see it as like an outside hole

39:44.120 --> 39:45.520
 with a center dot.

39:45.520 --> 39:49.040
 Some people see like stripes of lines.

39:49.040 --> 39:51.560
 Some people see segments.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.600
 And I collect them all and I put them on the board.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.240
 And at the end I say, look at this,

39:55.240 --> 39:58.240
 we are a class of 30 kids and we saw these seven dots

39:58.240 --> 40:00.040
 in 18 different ways.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.680
 There's actually a mathematical term for this.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.600
 It's called groupitizing.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.760
 Groupitizing?

40:04.760 --> 40:05.600
 Yeah.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.720
 I like it.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.560
 It's kind of cool.

40:07.560 --> 40:12.560
 So turns out though, that how well you groupitize predicts

40:13.480 --> 40:15.520
 how well you do in maths.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.960
 Is it a raw talent or is it just something

40:18.960 --> 40:19.800
 that you can develop?

40:19.800 --> 40:20.640
 I don't think it's wrong.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.640
 I don't think you're born groupitizing, I think.

40:22.640 --> 40:27.280
 But some kids have developed that ability, if you like.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.960
 And you can learn it.

40:28.960 --> 40:33.960
 So this to me is part of how wrong we have maths

40:34.120 --> 40:36.600
 that we think to tell whether a kid's good at maths,

40:36.600 --> 40:40.640
 we're gonna give them a speed test on multiples.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.880
 But actually seeing how kids group dots

40:43.880 --> 40:46.120
 could be a more important assessment

40:46.120 --> 40:48.200
 of how well they're gonna do in maths.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.600
 Anyway, I diverge.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.280
 What I like to do though when I start off with kids

40:52.280 --> 40:53.280
 is show them.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.560
 I'm gonna give you maths problems.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.080
 I'm gonna value the different ways you see them.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.880
 And turns out you can do this kind of problem

40:59.880 --> 41:03.040
 asking people how they group dots with young children

41:03.040 --> 41:05.440
 or with graduate students.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.180
 And it's engaging for all of them.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.120
 Is a, you talk about creativity a little bit

41:12.120 --> 41:15.160
 and flexibility in your book limitless.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.720
 What's the role of that?

41:16.720 --> 41:19.720
 So it sounds like there's a bit of that kind of thing

41:19.720 --> 41:22.640
 involved in groupitizing.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.640
 Yeah, I love this term.

41:25.640 --> 41:28.520
 So what would you say is the role of creativity

41:28.520 --> 41:31.280
 and flexibility in the learning of math?

41:31.280 --> 41:34.040
 I think what we know now is that

41:34.040 --> 41:37.760
 what we need for this 21st century world we live in

41:39.080 --> 41:40.520
 is a flexible mind.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.400
 Schools should not really be about teaching kids

41:44.400 --> 41:47.000
 particular methods, but teaching them to

41:47.000 --> 41:49.480
 approach problems with flexibility.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.840
 Being creative, thinking creatively is really important.

41:52.840 --> 41:56.960
 So people don't think the words maths and creativity

41:56.960 --> 42:00.240
 come together, but that's what I love about maths

42:00.240 --> 42:02.880
 is the creative different ways you can see it.

42:02.880 --> 42:06.120
 And so helping our kids.

42:06.120 --> 42:10.960
 There's a book I like a lot by, been by physicists.

42:10.960 --> 42:13.920
 You probably know this book called Elastic.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.800
 You might know it.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.440
 And it's about how we want elastic minds,

42:18.440 --> 42:21.440
 same kind of thing, flexible creative minds.

42:21.440 --> 42:26.440
 And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind.

42:26.800 --> 42:31.720
 They do a lot of developing the kind of mind

42:31.720 --> 42:35.280
 that a computer now does for us.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.520
 Memorization.

42:36.520 --> 42:40.440
 Memorization, doing procedures,

42:40.440 --> 42:45.320
 a lot of things that we spend a lot of time in school on

42:45.320 --> 42:47.520
 in the world when kids leave school,

42:47.520 --> 42:49.560
 a computer will do that.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.560
 And better than they will.

42:52.560 --> 42:54.880
 But that creative, flexible thinking,

42:54.880 --> 42:57.160
 we're kind of at ground zero at computers

42:57.160 --> 42:59.520
 being able to engage in that thinking.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.920
 Maybe we're a little above ground zero,

43:00.920 --> 43:05.800
 but the human brain is perfectly suited

43:05.800 --> 43:07.560
 for that creative, flexible thinking.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.880
 That's what humans are so great at.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.080
 So I would like to balance the shift in schools.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.160
 Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking,

43:15.160 --> 43:17.160
 but there should be a lot more of that

43:17.160 --> 43:20.120
 creative, flexible thinking.

43:20.120 --> 43:23.960
 And what's the role of other humans in this picture?

43:23.960 --> 43:27.320
 So collaborative learning.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.360
 So brainstorming together.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.600
 So creativity as it emerges

43:31.600 --> 43:34.440
 from the collective intelligence of multiple humans.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.480
 Yeah, super important.

43:36.480 --> 43:40.560
 And we know that also helps develop your brain,

43:40.560 --> 43:42.320
 that social side of thinking.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.880
 And I love mathematics collaboration

43:44.880 --> 43:47.520
 where people build on each other's ideas

43:47.520 --> 43:49.760
 and they come up with amazing things.

43:49.760 --> 43:54.040
 I actually taught a hundred students calculus

43:54.040 --> 43:56.840
 at Stanford recently, undergrads.

43:56.840 --> 43:59.400
 And we taught them to collaborate.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.240
 So these students came in Stanford

44:01.240 --> 44:04.600
 and most of them were against collaboration in maths.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.200
 This is before COVID in person?

44:06.200 --> 44:08.280
 Yeah, it was just before COVID hit.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.200
 It was 2019.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.040
 And the summer.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.760
 Sorry, you said they're against.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.720
 Yeah, so it's really interesting.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.920
 So they'd only experienced maths individually

44:19.920 --> 44:22.040
 in a kind of competitive individual way.

44:22.040 --> 44:24.600
 And if they had experienced it as group work,

44:24.600 --> 44:26.520
 it had been a bad experience.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.800
 Like maybe they were the one who did it all

44:28.800 --> 44:31.440
 and the others didn't do much.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.080
 So they were kind of against collaboration.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.000
 They didn't see any role for it in maths.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.360
 And we taught them to collaborate.

44:38.360 --> 44:42.080
 And it was hard work because as well as the fact

44:42.080 --> 44:43.480
 that they were kind of against collaboration,

44:43.480 --> 44:48.440
 they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.400
 So I'm in this room with other Stanford undergrads

44:51.400 --> 44:53.480
 and they're better than me.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.720
 So when we sent them to work on a maths problem together,

44:55.720 --> 44:57.160
 the first one was kind of a disaster

44:57.160 --> 44:59.200
 because they put all like, they're better than me,

44:59.200 --> 45:00.440
 they're faster than me.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.560
 They came up with something I didn't come up with.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.920
 So we taught them to let go of that thinking

45:05.920 --> 45:08.520
 and to work well together.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.760
 And one of the things we did, we decided,

45:10.760 --> 45:12.480
 we wanted to do a pre and post test

45:12.480 --> 45:15.680
 at the end of this teaching, it was only four weeks long.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.120
 But we knew, we didn't want to give them

45:17.120 --> 45:19.240
 like a time test of individual work.

45:19.240 --> 45:23.640
 So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.160
 And we gave them to do pairs together.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.520
 And we gave each of them a different colored pen

45:28.520 --> 45:30.960
 and said, work on this activity together

45:30.960 --> 45:32.960
 and keep using that pen.

45:32.960 --> 45:35.120
 So then we had all these pieces of student work

45:35.120 --> 45:37.520
 and what we saw was they just worked

45:37.520 --> 45:39.120
 on separate parts of the paper.

45:39.120 --> 45:42.000
 So there's a little like red pen section

45:42.000 --> 45:43.680
 and a green pen section.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.880
 And they didn't do that well on it.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.040
 Even though it was a problem

45:48.040 --> 45:49.760
 that middle or high school kids could do,

45:49.760 --> 45:52.680
 but it was like a problem solving kind of problem.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.000
 And then we gave them the same one to do at the end,

45:55.000 --> 45:56.160
 gave them the same colors

45:56.160 --> 45:59.160
 and it actually they had learned to collaborate.

45:59.160 --> 46:01.760
 And not only were they collaborating the second time

46:01.760 --> 46:04.000
 around, but that boosted their achievement.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.840
 And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.240
 Collaboration is important having people

46:10.240 --> 46:12.520
 and what was so eye opening for these undergrads

46:12.520 --> 46:15.360
 and they talked about it in lovely ways

46:15.360 --> 46:19.960
 was I learned to value other people's thinking on a problem.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.720
 And I learned to value that other people saw it

46:22.720 --> 46:24.320
 in different ways.

46:24.320 --> 46:29.320
 And it was quite a big experience for them

46:29.480 --> 46:31.320
 that they came out thinking,

46:31.320 --> 46:33.600
 I can do maths with other people,

46:33.600 --> 46:34.800
 people can see it differently,

46:34.800 --> 46:38.280
 we can build on each other's ways of thinking.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.480
 I got a chance to,

46:39.480 --> 46:42.000
 I don't know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.080
 got a chance to interact with him.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.360
 And like the first,

46:45.360 --> 46:49.520
 cause he had a few but one famous collaboration

46:49.520 --> 46:52.920
 throughout his life with Tversky.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.920
 And just like, you know,

46:55.920 --> 46:58.520
 he hasn't met me before in person,

46:58.520 --> 47:01.240
 but just the number of questions he was asking

47:01.240 --> 47:03.120
 and just the curiosity.

47:03.120 --> 47:05.400
 So I think one of the skills,

47:05.400 --> 47:07.960
 the collaboration itself is a skill.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.760
 And I remember my experience with him was like,

47:10.760 --> 47:14.000
 okay, I get why you're so good at collaboration

47:14.000 --> 47:17.440
 because he was just extremely good at listening

47:17.440 --> 47:21.400
 and genuine curiosity about how the other person

47:21.400 --> 47:23.320
 thinks about the world, sees the world.

47:23.320 --> 47:27.400
 And then together he pulled me in in that particular case.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.560
 He doesn't know in particular like

47:29.560 --> 47:31.160
 that much about autonomous vehicles,

47:31.160 --> 47:34.520
 but he kept like asking all of these questions.

47:34.520 --> 47:36.400
 And then like 10 minutes in,

47:36.400 --> 47:38.120
 we're together trying to solve the problem

47:38.120 --> 47:39.920
 of autonomous driving.

47:39.920 --> 47:41.680
 And like, and that,

47:41.680 --> 47:43.080
 I mean, that's really fulfilling,

47:43.080 --> 47:43.920
 that's really enriching,

47:43.920 --> 47:46.680
 but it also in that moment made me realize

47:46.680 --> 47:48.200
 it's kind of a skill.

47:48.200 --> 47:50.760
 Is you have to kind of put your ego aside,

47:50.760 --> 47:52.480
 put your view of the world aside

47:52.480 --> 47:55.800
 and try to learn how the other person sees it.

47:55.800 --> 47:57.600
 And the other thing you have to put aside

47:57.600 --> 48:00.760
 is this social comparison thinking.

48:00.760 --> 48:03.240
 If you are sitting there thinking,

48:03.240 --> 48:04.800
 wow, that was an amazing idea.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.600
 He's so much better than I am.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.960
 That's really gonna stop you taking on

48:09.960 --> 48:12.160
 the value of that idea.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.240
 And so there's a lot of that going on

48:14.240 --> 48:16.520
 between these Stanford students when they came.

48:17.400 --> 48:21.880
 And trying to help them let go of that.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.240
 One of the things I've discovered

48:24.240 --> 48:27.320
 just because being a little bit more in the public eye,

48:27.320 --> 48:30.680
 how rewarding it is to celebrate others.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.520
 Yeah.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.360
 And how much it's going to actually pay off

48:34.360 --> 48:35.760
 in the long term.

48:35.760 --> 48:38.160
 So this kind of silo thinking of like,

48:38.160 --> 48:41.200
 I want to prove to a small set of people around me

48:41.200 --> 48:45.280
 that I'm really smart and do so

48:45.280 --> 48:48.800
 by basically not celebrating how smart the other people are.

48:48.800 --> 48:51.480
 That's actually maybe short term,

48:51.480 --> 48:54.520
 it seems like a good strategy, but long term it's not.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.440
 And I think if you practice at the student level

48:56.440 --> 48:58.840
 and then at the career at every single stage,

48:58.840 --> 49:00.480
 I think that's ultimately.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.320
 I agree with you.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.440
 I think that's a really good way of thinking about it.

49:04.440 --> 49:08.280
 You mentioned textbooks and you didn't say it.

49:11.280 --> 49:15.400
 Maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to teach mathematics,

49:15.400 --> 49:16.960
 but I love textbooks.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.440
 They're like pretty pictures and they smell nice

49:19.440 --> 49:21.680
 and they open, I mean, I talk about like physical.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.360
 Some of them my greatest experiences

49:23.360 --> 49:25.440
 have been just like,

49:25.440 --> 49:27.320
 because they're really well done

49:27.320 --> 49:30.480
 when we're talking about basic like high school,

49:30.480 --> 49:34.160
 calculus, biology, chemistry.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.880
 Those are like, those are incredible.

49:36.880 --> 49:40.360
 It's like Wikipedia, but with color and nice little stuff.

49:40.360 --> 49:41.960
 You must have seen some good textbooks

49:41.960 --> 49:44.560
 if they had pretty pictures in color.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.240
 Yeah, I mean, I remember,

49:46.240 --> 49:49.200
 I guess it was very, very standard,

49:49.200 --> 49:53.520
 like AP calculus, AP biology, AP chemistry.

49:53.520 --> 49:56.120
 I felt those are like some of the happiest days of my life

49:56.120 --> 49:58.040
 in terms of learning was high school

49:58.040 --> 50:00.760
 because it was very easy, honestly.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.280
 It felt hard at the time,

50:03.280 --> 50:07.120
 but you're basically doing a whirlwind tour

50:07.120 --> 50:08.440
 of all of science.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.440
 Yeah, yeah.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.200
 Without having to pick.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.880
 You do literature, you do like Shakespeare,

50:13.880 --> 50:18.560
 your calculus, biology, physics, chemistry,

50:18.560 --> 50:23.560
 what else, anatomy, physiology, computer science.

50:23.560 --> 50:26.000
 Without like, nobody's telling you what to do.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.040
 Your life, you're just doing all of those things.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.640
 That's a good thing, you're right.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.400
 But I remember the textbooks weren't,

50:32.400 --> 50:35.360
 I mean, maybe I'm romanticizing the past,

50:35.360 --> 50:38.600
 but I remember they weren't, they're pretty good.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.960
 But so you think, what role do you think they play still?

50:41.960 --> 50:45.440
 And like in this more modern digital age,

50:45.440 --> 50:47.680
 what's the best materials

50:47.680 --> 50:50.040
 with which to do these kinds of educations?

50:50.040 --> 50:52.800
 Well, I'm intrigued that you had such a good experience

50:52.800 --> 50:53.640
 with textbooks.

50:53.640 --> 50:56.800
 I mean, I can remember loving some textbooks

50:56.800 --> 50:59.520
 I had when I was learning and I love books.

50:59.520 --> 51:03.120
 I love to pick up books and look through them.

51:03.120 --> 51:06.560
 But a lot of maths textbooks

51:06.560 --> 51:08.800
 are not good experiences for kids.

51:08.800 --> 51:12.920
 They, we have a video on our website

51:12.920 --> 51:14.120
 of the kids who came to our camp

51:14.120 --> 51:15.680
 and one of the students says,

51:16.520 --> 51:18.840
 in maths, you have to follow the textbook.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.560
 The textbook's kind of like the Bible.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.480
 You have to follow it.

51:22.480 --> 51:25.960
 And every day it's slightly different.

51:25.960 --> 51:28.840
 Like on Monday you do 2.3.2

51:28.840 --> 51:32.560
 and on Tuesday you do 2.3.3 and on Wednesday.

51:32.560 --> 51:35.160
 And you never go off that.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.920
 That's like every single day.

51:37.920 --> 51:42.560
 And that's not inspiring for a lot of the kids.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.480
 So one of the things they loved about our camp

51:45.480 --> 51:46.880
 was just that there were no books.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.720
 Even though we gave them sheets of paper instead,

51:50.720 --> 51:53.080
 they still felt more free

51:53.080 --> 51:56.640
 because they weren't just like trotting through exercises,

51:56.640 --> 51:58.120
 exercises.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.560
 So...

51:59.560 --> 52:02.120
 Like what a textbook allows you is like,

52:02.120 --> 52:06.680
 you're, the very thing you said they might not like

52:06.680 --> 52:11.160
 the 2.3, 2.3, it feels like you're making progress

52:11.160 --> 52:12.760
 and like it's little celebrations

52:12.760 --> 52:16.240
 because you do the problem and it seems really hard

52:16.240 --> 52:17.320
 and you don't know how to do it.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.640
 And then you try and try

52:19.640 --> 52:20.960
 and then eventually succeed

52:20.960 --> 52:23.680
 and then you make that little step and further progress

52:23.680 --> 52:26.200
 and then you get to the end of a chapter

52:26.200 --> 52:28.040
 and you get to like, it's closure.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.880
 You're like, all right, I got that figured out

52:29.880 --> 52:31.360
 and then you go on to the next chapter.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.320
 I can see that.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.960
 I mean, I think it could be in a textbook.

52:34.960 --> 52:39.000
 You can have a good experience with a textbook.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.240
 But what's really important is what is in that textbook.

52:43.240 --> 52:45.320
 What are you doing inside it?

52:45.320 --> 52:47.960
 And I mean, I grew up in England

52:47.960 --> 52:50.480
 and in England, we learn maths.

52:50.480 --> 52:54.440
 We don't have this separation of algebra and geometry.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.160
 And I don't think any other country

52:56.160 --> 52:58.240
 apart from the US has that.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.240
 But I look at kids in algebra classes

53:01.240 --> 53:02.800
 where they're doing algebra for a year

53:02.800 --> 53:05.880
 and I think I would have been pretty bored doing that.

53:08.440 --> 53:13.080
 By the way, can we analyze your upbringing real quick?

53:13.080 --> 53:18.080
 Why do British folks call mathematics maths?

53:19.960 --> 53:21.120
 Why is it the plural?

53:21.120 --> 53:23.120
 Is it because of everything you're saying

53:23.120 --> 53:25.160
 or is it a bunch of sub disciplines?

53:25.160 --> 53:30.160
 Yeah, I mean, mathematics is supposed to be the different maths

53:33.640 --> 53:35.080
 that you look at.

53:35.080 --> 53:38.760
 Whether you think of that as topics like geometry

53:38.760 --> 53:43.760
 and probability or I think of it as maths.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.720
 It's just multidimensional, lots of ways.

53:45.720 --> 53:48.640
 But that's why it was called mathematics

53:48.640 --> 53:50.440
 and then it was shortened to maths.

53:50.440 --> 53:53.280
 And then for some reason it was just math in the US.

53:53.280 --> 53:58.280
 But to me, math has that more singular feel to it.

53:58.400 --> 54:02.960
 And there's an expression here which is do the math,

54:02.960 --> 54:05.200
 which basically means do a calculation.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.440
 That's what people mean by do the math.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.320
 So I don't like that expression

54:09.320 --> 54:11.200
 because no math could be anything.

54:11.200 --> 54:13.440
 It doesn't have to be a calculation.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.560
 So yeah, I like maths

54:14.560 --> 54:17.240
 because it has more of that broad feel to it.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.080
 Yeah, I love that.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.960
 Maths kind of emphasize the multidimensional,

54:19.960 --> 54:22.840
 like the variety of different disciplines,

54:22.840 --> 54:24.360
 different approaches, yeah.

54:27.360 --> 54:28.640
 But outside of the textbook,

54:28.640 --> 54:33.640
 what do you see broadly being used?

54:33.640 --> 54:36.800
 You mentioned Sebastian Thrun and Moocs,

54:36.800 --> 54:37.880
 online education.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.480
 Do you think that's an effective set?

54:39.480 --> 54:40.920
 Can be.

54:40.920 --> 54:45.040
 I mean, online, having great teachers online

54:45.040 --> 54:48.080
 obviously extends those teachers to many more people

54:48.080 --> 54:49.760
 and that's a wonderful thing.

54:51.440 --> 54:54.240
 I have quite a few online courses myself.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.240
 I got the bug working with Sebastian

54:56.240 --> 54:59.760
 when he had released his first Mooc.

54:59.760 --> 55:03.440
 And I thought, maybe I could do one in maths education

55:03.440 --> 55:06.400
 and I didn't know if anybody would take it.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.440
 I remember releasing it that first summer

55:08.440 --> 55:09.920
 and it was a free online class

55:09.920 --> 55:13.800
 and 30,000 maths teachers took it that first summer

55:13.800 --> 55:16.040
 and they were all talking about it with each other

55:16.040 --> 55:18.040
 and sharing it and it was like took off.

55:18.040 --> 55:23.040
 In fact, it was that Mooc that got me to create Ucubed

55:24.440 --> 55:26.960
 with Kathy Williams, who's the cofounder

55:27.880 --> 55:30.200
 because people took the Mooc and then they said,

55:30.200 --> 55:32.280
 okay, what now?

55:32.280 --> 55:34.720
 Like I finished, what can I have next?

55:34.720 --> 55:36.880
 And so that was where we made our website,

55:36.880 --> 55:40.640
 but so yeah, I think online education can be great.

55:40.640 --> 55:45.480
 I do think a lot of the Moocs don't have great pedagogy.

55:45.480 --> 55:47.560
 They're just a talking head

55:47.560 --> 55:52.560
 and you can actually engage people in more active ways

55:52.680 --> 55:54.880
 even in online learning.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.760
 So I learned from the Udacity principle

55:57.760 --> 55:59.160
 when I was working at Udacity,

55:59.160 --> 56:02.120
 never to talk more than like five minutes.

56:02.120 --> 56:05.760
 And then to ask people to do something.

56:05.760 --> 56:09.760
 So that's the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have.

56:09.760 --> 56:12.440
 There's a little bit of presenting something

56:12.440 --> 56:15.120
 and then people do something and there's a little bit more

56:15.120 --> 56:17.160
 because I think if you have a half hour video,

56:17.160 --> 56:20.920
 you just switch off and start doing other things.

56:20.920 --> 56:24.760
 So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute

56:24.760 --> 56:29.680
 like bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps

56:29.680 --> 56:31.080
 and then there's like a quiz almost.

56:31.080 --> 56:32.440
 Then you answer a question, yeah.

56:32.440 --> 56:35.960
 Yeah, that's really effective.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.040
 You mentioned Ucubed.

56:37.040 --> 56:37.960
 So what's the mission?

56:37.960 --> 56:38.800
 What's the goal?

56:38.800 --> 56:40.280
 You mentioned how it started,

56:40.280 --> 56:45.280
 but where are you at now and what's your dream with it

56:46.600 --> 56:48.240
 or what are the kind of things

56:48.240 --> 56:50.480
 that people should go and check out on there?

56:50.480 --> 56:52.400
 Yeah, we started Ucubed,

56:52.400 --> 56:54.160
 I guess it was about five years ago now

56:54.160 --> 56:57.320
 and we've had over 52 million visitors to the site.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.440
 So I'm very happy about that.

56:59.440 --> 57:03.840
 And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching

57:03.840 --> 57:08.040
 with teachers, students, parents in maths

57:08.040 --> 57:10.680
 and to help, we have a sort of sub goal

57:10.680 --> 57:13.240
 of a raising maths anxiety, that's important to us,

57:13.240 --> 57:17.880
 but also to share maths as this beautiful creative subject.

57:17.880 --> 57:21.400
 And it's been really great.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.840
 We have lessons on the site,

57:23.840 --> 57:26.960
 but one of the reasons I thought this was needed

57:26.960 --> 57:29.640
 is there's a lot of knowledge in the academy

57:29.640 --> 57:30.720
 about how to teach maths.

57:30.720 --> 57:34.480
 Well, loads and loads of research and journals

57:34.480 --> 57:36.520
 and lots of things written up,

57:36.520 --> 57:38.400
 but teachers don't read it.

57:38.400 --> 57:41.120
 They don't have access to it.

57:41.120 --> 57:43.240
 They're often behind pay walls.

57:43.240 --> 57:46.480
 They're written in really inaccessible ways,

57:46.480 --> 57:49.280
 so people wouldn't want to read them or understand them.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.160
 So this I see is a big problem.

57:51.160 --> 57:53.760
 You have this whole industry of people

57:53.760 --> 57:55.720
 finding out how to teach well,

57:55.720 --> 57:58.800
 not sharing it with the people who are teaching.

57:58.800 --> 58:01.400
 So that's where we made U cubed.

58:01.400 --> 58:03.360
 And instead of just putting articles up,

58:03.360 --> 58:05.800
 saying here's some things to read about how to teach well,

58:05.800 --> 58:08.240
 we translated what was coming from research

58:08.240 --> 58:10.520
 into things that teacher could use.

58:10.520 --> 58:13.600
 So lessons, there were videos to show kids

58:13.600 --> 58:16.400
 and there were tips for parents.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.960
 There were all sorts of things on the site.

58:17.960 --> 58:22.960
 And it's been amazing as we took inspiration

58:22.960 --> 58:27.760
 from the week of code, which got teachers

58:27.760 --> 58:29.480
 to focus on coding for a week.

58:29.480 --> 58:33.840
 And we have this thing called the week of inspirational maths.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.760
 And we say, just try it for a week.

58:35.760 --> 58:39.320
 Just give us one week and try it and see what happens.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.600
 And so it's been downloaded millions of times.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.520
 Teachers use it every year.

58:44.520 --> 58:46.480
 They start the school year with it.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.600
 And what they tell us is it was amazing.

58:49.600 --> 58:50.680
 The kids lights were on.

58:50.680 --> 58:51.720
 They were excited.

58:51.720 --> 58:52.960
 They loved it.

58:52.960 --> 58:56.000
 And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
 and the lights went out and they were not interested.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.960
 Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful.

59:03.960 --> 59:04.800
 It is.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.680
 I wish, I mean, my, what I would love

59:07.680 --> 59:11.640
 is if we could actually extend that for the whole year.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.960
 We're a small team at Stanford

59:13.960 --> 59:17.000
 and we're trying to keep up with great things

59:17.000 --> 59:18.260
 to put on the site.

59:18.260 --> 59:23.780
 We have the capacity to produce these creative visual maths

59:23.780 --> 59:25.820
 tasks for every year group for every day.

59:25.820 --> 59:27.100
 But I would love to do that.

59:27.100 --> 59:28.540
 How difficult is it to do?

59:28.540 --> 59:34.620
 I mean, it's to come up with visual formulations

59:34.620 --> 59:39.060
 of these big important topics you need to think about

59:39.060 --> 59:43.340
 in a way that you could teach.

59:43.340 --> 59:44.740
 I mean, we can do it.

59:44.740 --> 59:47.420
 We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths

59:47.420 --> 59:51.980
 and we made K8 maths books with exactly that.

59:51.980 --> 59:54.940
 Big ideas, rich activities, visuals.

59:54.940 --> 59:56.580
 We just finished the last one.

59:56.580 --> 59:58.980
 We've been doing it for five years

59:58.980 --> 1:00:01.660
 and it's been exhausting and we just finished.

1:00:01.660 --> 1:00:05.580
 So now there's a whole K8 set of books

1:00:05.580 --> 1:00:07.140
 and they're organized in that way.

1:00:07.140 --> 1:00:10.260
 These are the big ideas here are rich deep activities.

1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:16.060
 They're not though what you can do every day for a year.

1:00:16.060 --> 1:00:19.020
 So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement

1:00:19.020 --> 1:00:21.020
 to their boring textbook.

1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:24.420
 And some people have said, okay, this is the year.

1:00:24.420 --> 1:00:26.500
 This book tells us what the year is

1:00:26.500 --> 1:00:29.140
 and then we'll supplement these big activities with.

1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:34.420
 So they're being used and teachers really like them

1:00:34.420 --> 1:00:36.220
 and are really happy about them.

1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:37.460
 I just always want more.

1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:40.260
 And I guess one of the things I would like for Ucubed,

1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:43.620
 one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths

1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:45.500
 knows about Ucubed.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:47.140
 At the moment,

1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:49.100
 lots of teachers who come to us are really happy

1:00:49.100 --> 1:00:51.220
 they found it, but there's a lot of other teachers

1:00:51.220 --> 1:00:53.660
 who don't know that it exists.

1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:54.940
 I hope this helps.

1:00:54.940 --> 1:00:55.980
 Yeah.

1:00:55.980 --> 1:00:57.980
 From a student perspective

1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:01.540
 and not in the classroom, but at home studying.

1:01:03.860 --> 1:01:07.380
 Is there some advice you can give

1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:09.820
 on how to best study mathematics?

1:01:09.820 --> 1:01:12.660
 So what's the role of the student outside the classroom?

1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:15.700
 Yeah, I think one thing we know is

1:01:15.700 --> 1:01:18.620
 a lot of people, when they review material,

1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:20.340
 whether it's maths or anything else,

1:01:20.340 --> 1:01:22.540
 don't do it in the best way.

1:01:22.540 --> 1:01:26.140
 I think a problem a lot of people have is they read through

1:01:26.140 --> 1:01:30.260
 maybe a teacher's explanation or a way of doing maths

1:01:30.260 --> 1:01:31.740
 and it makes sense.

1:01:31.740 --> 1:01:34.380
 And they think, oh yeah, I've got that and they move on.

1:01:35.380 --> 1:01:38.780
 But then it's not until you come to try and work on something

1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:40.300
 and do a problem that you actually realize

1:01:40.300 --> 1:01:41.700
 you didn't really understand it,

1:01:41.700 --> 1:01:43.300
 it just seemed to make sense.

1:01:44.180 --> 1:01:47.820
 So I would say this is also something

1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:49.980
 that neuroscience does talk about,

1:01:49.980 --> 1:01:52.820
 to keep giving yourself questions

1:01:52.820 --> 1:01:55.980
 is a really good way to study

1:01:55.980 --> 1:01:58.820
 rather than looking through lots of material.

1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:01.900
 It's always like giving yourself lots of tests

1:02:01.900 --> 1:02:04.820
 is a good way to actually deeply understand things

1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:07.020
 and know what you do and you don't understand.

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:10.900
 So would the questions be in the form of

1:02:10.900 --> 1:02:14.540
 the material you're reviewing is the answer to that question

1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:16.100
 or is it almost like beyond,

1:02:16.100 --> 1:02:18.980
 it's the polygon thing they mentioned from a square,

1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:22.860
 is it almost like I wonder what is the bigger picture

1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:26.260
 I was kind of asking of like how is this extended and so on?

1:02:26.260 --> 1:02:28.740
 Yeah, that would be great.

1:02:28.740 --> 1:02:31.540
 And it's a similar, I mean, a question I get asked a lot

1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:33.340
 is about homework, what is a good thing

1:02:33.340 --> 1:02:35.020
 for kids to do for homework.

1:02:35.020 --> 1:02:37.980
 And one of the recommendations I give is

1:02:37.980 --> 1:02:42.860
 to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework,

1:02:42.860 --> 1:02:46.140
 but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned,

1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:49.780
 like what was the big idea you learned today?

1:02:49.780 --> 1:02:51.980
 Or what did you find difficult?

1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:53.540
 What did you struggle with?

1:02:53.540 --> 1:02:56.500
 What was something that was exciting?

1:02:58.220 --> 1:03:01.140
 Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect

1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:02.500
 in a deeper way.

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:04.540
 A lot of times, I don't know if you have this experience

1:03:04.540 --> 1:03:06.700
 as a math student, lots of people do.

1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:08.820
 Kids are going through math's questions,

1:03:08.820 --> 1:03:10.940
 they're successful, they get them right,

1:03:10.940 --> 1:03:13.980
 but they don't even really know what they're about.

1:03:13.980 --> 1:03:17.220
 And a lot of kids go through many years of math like that,

1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:19.380
 doing lots of questions, but really knowing

1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:23.500
 what even the topic is or what it's about,

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:24.460
 what it's important for.

1:03:24.460 --> 1:03:28.780
 So having students go back and think at the end of a day,

1:03:28.780 --> 1:03:31.700
 what was the big idea from this math lesson?

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.380
 Why is it important?

1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:36.060
 Where would I find that in real life?

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:37.940
 Those are really good questions

1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:39.980
 for kids to be thinking about.

1:03:39.980 --> 1:03:42.420
 It's probably for everybody to be thinking about.

1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.380
 I think most of us go through life

1:03:44.380 --> 1:03:48.220
 never asking the bigger question,

1:03:48.220 --> 1:03:51.620
 almost like those layers of why questions

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:53.980
 that kids ask when they're very young,

1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:56.020
 we need to keep doing that.

1:03:56.020 --> 1:03:56.860
 We do.

1:03:56.860 --> 1:03:59.700
 Like that's the, whatever the term is,

1:03:59.700 --> 1:04:01.460
 you call first principles thinking,

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:03.380
 some people call it that,

1:04:03.380 --> 1:04:08.380
 which is like, why are we doing it this way?

1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:11.820
 So one nice thing is to do that

1:04:11.820 --> 1:04:13.140
 because there's usually a good answer.

1:04:13.140 --> 1:04:15.420
 Like the reason we did it this way

1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:17.820
 is because it works for this reason.

1:04:17.820 --> 1:04:20.660
 But then if you want to do something totally novel,

1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:24.220
 is you'll say, well, we've been doing it this way

1:04:26.380 --> 1:04:28.660
 because of historical reasons,

1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:30.580
 but really this is not the best way to do it.

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:32.260
 There might be other ways.

1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:34.460
 And that's how invention happens.

1:04:34.460 --> 1:04:35.540
 And then you get, you know,

1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:38.340
 that's really useful in every aspect of life,

1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:42.420
 like choosing your career, choosing your,

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:44.820
 I don't know, where you live,

1:04:44.820 --> 1:04:47.780
 who you're like romantic partner is like everything.

1:04:47.780 --> 1:04:48.980
 Everything, yeah.

1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:53.220
 And I think it probably starts doing that in math class.

1:04:54.260 --> 1:04:56.340
 That would be good if we started doing that.

1:04:56.340 --> 1:05:00.980
 I mean, I wonder, I probably didn't do very much of that

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:03.740
 for most of my education, asking why,

1:05:03.740 --> 1:05:08.140
 except for later, much later in the subjects

1:05:08.140 --> 1:05:12.220
 on like grad school when you're doing research on them.

1:05:12.220 --> 1:05:16.620
 When your first task of doing something novel using this

1:05:16.620 --> 1:05:19.980
 or solving a problem really outside the classroom,

1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:20.820
 they have to publish on it.

1:05:20.820 --> 1:05:23.220
 It's the first time you think, wait,

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:27.020
 why are these things interesting, useful,

1:05:27.020 --> 1:05:29.420
 which are the things that are useful?

1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:31.620
 And yeah, I guess that would be nice

1:05:31.620 --> 1:05:35.220
 if we did that much earlier, that the quest of invention.

1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:36.940
 Yeah, yeah.

1:05:36.940 --> 1:05:39.660
 I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data

1:05:39.660 --> 1:05:42.580
 I think about is the questions kids ask

1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:48.740
 in school goes down like in a linear, you know,

1:05:49.020 --> 1:05:51.380
 progression from in the early years,

1:05:51.380 --> 1:05:53.780
 you can't stop kids asking those questions,

1:05:53.780 --> 1:05:56.700
 but they learn not to ask the questions.

1:05:56.700 --> 1:06:00.020
 I think you told somewhere about an early memory

1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:04.700
 you had in your own education where you asked the question,

1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:06.300
 or maybe that was an example you gave,

1:06:06.300 --> 1:06:07.420
 but it was shut down.

1:06:07.420 --> 1:06:10.900
 Oh yeah, you've listened to something I said, yeah.

1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:15.180
 I don't remember where it was, but it caught me.

1:06:15.180 --> 1:06:17.660
 Yeah, I remember it really vividly.

1:06:17.660 --> 1:06:19.820
 Well, can you tell the memory?

1:06:19.820 --> 1:06:21.780
 Yeah, it's funny, I can remember.

1:06:21.780 --> 1:06:23.940
 It must have really impacted me in that moment

1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:26.260
 because you know, how there's lots of hours of school,

1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:29.060
 we don't remember at all, but anyway,

1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:30.780
 I can remember where I was sitting and everything.

1:06:30.780 --> 1:06:33.420
 I was in high school maths class,

1:06:33.420 --> 1:06:35.340
 although they don't call it that in England,

1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:39.100
 and the teacher said,

1:06:39.100 --> 1:06:42.020
 and it was like the first class of this teacher's class,

1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:44.420
 and he said, ask if you have any questions.

1:06:44.420 --> 1:06:46.540
 So at one point I put my hand up,

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:48.260
 and I said, I have a question,

1:06:48.260 --> 1:06:50.660
 and he said something like, that's your question.

1:06:50.660 --> 1:06:55.660
 And I was like, okay, I'm not asking any more questions

1:06:56.860 --> 1:06:57.700
 in this class.

1:06:57.700 --> 1:06:59.980
 And it hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna,

1:06:59.980 --> 1:07:02.060
 the lesson you learn from that, I'm not gonna ask.

1:07:02.060 --> 1:07:04.020
 Yeah, that was absolutely the lesson I asked.

1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:06.340
 That's the last question I'm asking.

1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:11.340
 And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department,

1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:13.740
 I remember that really well.

1:07:13.740 --> 1:07:18.100
 So maybe because of that experience,

1:07:18.100 --> 1:07:20.460
 one of the things we encourage when we teach kids

1:07:20.460 --> 1:07:21.580
 is asking questions.

1:07:21.580 --> 1:07:23.100
 And we value it when they ask questions,

1:07:23.100 --> 1:07:25.740
 and we put them up on walls and celebrate.

1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:31.460
 It's funny, because I wish there was a feedback signal,

1:07:31.460 --> 1:07:35.140
 because he probably, to put a positive spin on it,

1:07:35.140 --> 1:07:37.500
 he probably didn't realize the negative impact

1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:38.820
 he's had in that moment, right?

1:07:38.820 --> 1:07:40.340
 If he only knew.

1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:42.540
 See, this is probably when you're more mature

1:07:42.540 --> 1:07:44.220
 in grad school.

1:07:44.220 --> 1:07:47.060
 I had an amazing professor named Alisha Kafande

1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:48.740
 in computer science,

1:07:48.740 --> 1:07:51.300
 and he would encourage questions,

1:07:51.300 --> 1:07:52.500
 but then he would tell everybody

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:54.300
 how dumb their questions are.

1:07:54.300 --> 1:07:59.220
 But it was done, I guess, if you say it with love

1:07:59.220 --> 1:08:00.780
 and respect behind it,

1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:03.740
 then it's more like a friendly, humorous encouragement

1:08:03.740 --> 1:08:05.340
 for more questions.

1:08:05.340 --> 1:08:06.340
 It's an art, right?

1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:09.140
 Yeah, that's what teaching is very hard.

1:08:09.140 --> 1:08:12.380
 You have to time it right, because that kind of humor

1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:15.500
 is probably better for when you're in grad school,

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:18.020
 versus when you're in the early education.

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:18.860
 Right.

1:08:18.860 --> 1:08:22.340
 Well, and I guess kids or young people get

1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:26.140
 whether somebody's doing it to be funny,

1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:31.140
 or has it, I mean, this is why teachers so hard.

1:08:31.180 --> 1:08:35.180
 Even your tone can be impactful.

1:08:35.180 --> 1:08:39.700
 It's so sad, because for that particular human,

1:08:39.700 --> 1:08:42.820
 the teacher, you could have just had a bad day,

1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:45.900
 and one statement can have a profound negative impact.

1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:48.780
 I know, sadly, that math,

1:08:48.780 --> 1:08:50.100
 there's a lot of math teachers

1:08:50.100 --> 1:08:51.940
 who have that kind of approach,

1:08:51.940 --> 1:08:55.980
 and they, I think they're suffering from the fact

1:08:55.980 --> 1:08:58.180
 that they think people are math people, not math people,

1:08:58.180 --> 1:09:01.020
 and that comes across in their teaching.

1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:03.420
 But on the flip side, one positive statement.

1:09:03.420 --> 1:09:04.260
 Yeah.

1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:05.100
 Keep them going.

1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:07.220
 That's right, that is the flip side of that.

1:09:07.220 --> 1:09:11.300
 And I myself had one teacher who was really amazing

1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:14.820
 for me in maths, and she kept me in the subject.

1:09:14.820 --> 1:09:16.300
 I probably wouldn't have left it.

1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:17.140
 Who was she?

1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:20.860
 She was, her name was Mrs. Marshall.

1:09:24.860 --> 1:09:27.620
 She was my A level maths teacher.

1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:31.980
 So I was in England, you do lots of subjects to your 16,

1:09:31.980 --> 1:09:35.260
 and then you choose like three or four subjects.

1:09:35.260 --> 1:09:40.260
 So I had chosen maths, and you go to higher levels.

1:09:41.380 --> 1:09:44.580
 Probably equivalent more to a master's degree in the US,

1:09:44.580 --> 1:09:46.140
 because you're more specialised.

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:48.660
 But anyways, she was my teacher,

1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:52.660
 and for the first time in my whole career in maths,

1:09:52.660 --> 1:09:55.420
 she would give us problems and tell us

1:09:55.420 --> 1:09:57.940
 to talk about them with each other.

1:09:57.940 --> 1:10:00.940
 And so here I was sitting there at like 17,

1:10:00.940 --> 1:10:03.940
 talking with friends about how to solve a math problem.

1:10:03.940 --> 1:10:04.780
 And that was it.

1:10:04.780 --> 1:10:07.740
 That was the change that she made,

1:10:07.740 --> 1:10:09.980
 but it was profound for me,

1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:13.340
 because like those calculus students,

1:10:13.340 --> 1:10:16.140
 I started to hear other people's ways of thinking

1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:17.900
 and seeing it, we would talk together

1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:19.820
 and come up with solutions.

1:10:19.820 --> 1:10:22.780
 And I was like, that was it, that changed maths for me.

1:10:22.780 --> 1:10:25.500
 So it wasn't some kind of personal interaction with her.

1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:29.180
 It was more like she was a catalyst

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:31.980
 for that collaborative experience.

1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:34.940
 I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids.

1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:36.900
 I mean, sometimes it's a personal message,

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:39.820
 but it can be your teaching approach

1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:42.380
 that changes maths for kids.

1:10:42.380 --> 1:10:47.380
 You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work,

1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:49.780
 and he's a mathematician,

1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:51.420
 he's a theoretical computer scientist,

1:10:51.420 --> 1:10:55.660
 and he talks about the kind of the focus required

1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:57.100
 to do that kind of work.

1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:01.700
 Is there something you can comment on?

1:11:01.700 --> 1:11:04.900
 You know, we live in a world full of distractions.

1:11:04.900 --> 1:11:08.340
 That seems like one of the elements that makes studying,

1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:10.220
 and especially the studying of subjects

1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:14.420
 that require thinking like maths does, difficult.

1:11:14.420 --> 1:11:17.340
 Is there something from a student perspective,

1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:20.580
 from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work

1:11:20.580 --> 1:11:21.420
 that you can comment on?

1:11:21.420 --> 1:11:26.420
 Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems,

1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:31.420
 and we have some on our website,

1:11:31.420 --> 1:11:33.900
 is a really important experience for them.

1:11:34.980 --> 1:11:38.140
 Even if they only do it occasionally,

1:11:38.140 --> 1:11:40.020
 but it's really important.

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:41.940
 They actually realize,

1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:45.380
 I give a problem out often when I'm working with teachers,

1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:46.980
 and I say to them,

1:11:46.980 --> 1:11:49.740
 all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour.

1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:51.460
 And they were like, an hour?

1:11:51.460 --> 1:11:53.460
 They think it's shocking.

1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:55.340
 And then they work on this problem,

1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:57.860
 and after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?

1:11:57.860 --> 1:12:01.860
 They're like, an hour's gone by, how is this possible?

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:06.860
 And so everybody needs those rich, deep problems.

1:12:06.860 --> 1:12:10.860
 Most kids go through their whole maths experience

1:12:10.860 --> 1:12:14.860
 of however many years, never once working on a problem

1:12:14.860 --> 1:12:16.860
 in that kind of deep way.

1:12:16.860 --> 1:12:21.860
 So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that.

1:12:21.860 --> 1:12:24.860
 We work on these deep problems every session.

1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:26.860
 And the students come away going,

1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:29.860
 okay, I never want to go back to that maths relationship

1:12:29.860 --> 1:12:31.860
 I had where it was just all about quick answers.

1:12:31.860 --> 1:12:34.860
 I just don't want to go back to that.

1:12:34.860 --> 1:12:39.860
 And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate

1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:42.860
 those problems in their classrooms.

1:12:42.860 --> 1:12:43.860
 Maybe they don't do them every day,

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:46.860
 but they at least give kids some experience

1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:50.860
 of being able to work slowly and deeply

1:12:50.860 --> 1:12:52.860
 and to go to deeper places

1:12:52.860 --> 1:12:57.860
 and not be told they've got five minutes

1:12:57.860 --> 1:12:59.860
 to finish 20 questions.

1:12:59.860 --> 1:13:03.860
 But part of it is also just the exercise

1:13:03.860 --> 1:13:05.860
 of sitting there maintaining focus

1:13:05.860 --> 1:13:07.860
 of prolonged periods of time.

1:13:07.860 --> 1:13:11.860
 That's not often, I mean, that's a skill.

1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:15.860
 It's a skill that also could be discouraging.

1:13:15.860 --> 1:13:17.860
 Like if you don't practice it,

1:13:17.860 --> 1:13:20.860
 just sitting down for 10 minutes straight

1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:23.860
 and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging.

1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:26.860
 Like if you're really thinking about a problem.

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:29.860
 And I think it's really important to realize

1:13:29.860 --> 1:13:31.860
 that that's a skill that you can, just like a muscle,

1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:33.860
 you can build, you can start with five minutes

1:13:33.860 --> 1:13:35.860
 and goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour.

1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:38.860
 And to be successful, I think in certain subjects

1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:42.860
 like mathematics, you want to be able to develop that skill.

1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:48.860
 Otherwise, you're not going to get to the really rewarding

1:13:48.860 --> 1:13:51.860
 experience of solving these problems.

1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:52.860
 Definitely.

1:13:52.860 --> 1:13:55.860
 There was a survey done of kids in school

1:13:55.860 --> 1:13:56.860
 where they were asked,

1:13:56.860 --> 1:13:57.860
 how long will you work on a maths problem

1:13:57.860 --> 1:14:00.860
 before you give up and decide it's not possible to solve it?

1:14:00.860 --> 1:14:01.860
 Good question.

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:06.860
 And the result, on average, across the kids was two minutes.

1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:11.860
 Yeah.

1:14:11.860 --> 1:14:14.860
 That's a bad sign, but that was a powerful sign

1:14:14.860 --> 1:14:18.860
 that they need to learn to not give up so quickly.

1:14:18.860 --> 1:14:19.860
 Yeah.

1:14:19.860 --> 1:14:21.860
 We mentioned offline,

1:14:21.860 --> 1:14:25.860
 because we've been talking so much about visualization.

1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:28.860
 Grant Sanderson, three little one brown.

1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:31.860
 So he's inspired millions of people

1:14:31.860 --> 1:14:34.860
 with exactly the kind of way of thinking

1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:36.860
 that you've been talking about.

1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:38.860
 Yeah, I love his work.

1:14:38.860 --> 1:14:45.860
 Converting sort of mathematical concepts into visual,

1:14:45.860 --> 1:14:47.860
 visually representing them,

1:14:47.860 --> 1:14:52.860
 exploring them in ways that help you illuminate the concepts.

1:14:52.860 --> 1:14:54.860
 What do you think is the role of that?

1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:57.860
 So he uses mostly programmatic visualizations.

1:14:57.860 --> 1:15:00.860
 So it's the thing I mentioned where there's like animations

1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:04.860
 created by writing computer programs.

1:15:04.860 --> 1:15:06.860
 Like what do you think?

1:15:06.860 --> 1:15:07.860
 How scalable is that approach?

1:15:07.860 --> 1:15:09.860
 But in general, what do you think about his approach?

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:11.860
 Yeah, I think it's amazing.

1:15:11.860 --> 1:15:13.860
 I should work with him.

1:15:13.860 --> 1:15:16.860
 I can share some of our visuals

1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:20.860
 and he can make them in that amazing way.

1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:22.860
 So part of his storytelling,

1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:25.860
 part of his like is creating the visuals

1:15:25.860 --> 1:15:28.860
 and then weaving a story with those visuals

1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:30.860
 that kind of builds.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:34.860
 There's also drama in it.

1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:36.860
 You start with a small example

1:15:36.860 --> 1:15:39.860
 and then all of a sudden there's a surprise.

1:15:39.860 --> 1:15:44.860
 And it really, it makes you fall in love with the concept.

1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:47.860
 He does talk about that.

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:50.860
 His sense is like some of the stuff,

1:15:50.860 --> 1:15:54.860
 he doesn't feel like he's teaching.

1:15:54.860 --> 1:15:56.860
 Like the core curriculum,

1:15:56.860 --> 1:15:58.860
 which is something, you know,

1:15:58.860 --> 1:16:02.860
 he sees himself as an inspirational figure.

1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:05.860
 But because I think it's too difficult

1:16:05.860 --> 1:16:07.860
 to kind of convert all of the curriculum

1:16:07.860 --> 1:16:08.860
 into those elements.

1:16:08.860 --> 1:16:10.860
 Right. And probably you don't need to.

1:16:10.860 --> 1:16:14.860
 I mean, you, if people get to experience

1:16:14.860 --> 1:16:17.860
 mathematical ideas in the way that he shares them,

1:16:17.860 --> 1:16:19.860
 that will change them

1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:20.860
 and it will change the way they think.

1:16:20.860 --> 1:16:22.860
 And maybe they could go on

1:16:22.860 --> 1:16:24.860
 to take some other mathematical idea

1:16:24.860 --> 1:16:25.860
 and make it that beautiful.

1:16:25.860 --> 1:16:27.860
 Well, he does that.

1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:30.860
 There's a, he created a library called Manum

1:16:30.860 --> 1:16:32.860
 and he open sourced it.

1:16:32.860 --> 1:16:34.860
 And that library is the,

1:16:34.860 --> 1:16:36.860
 people should check it out.

1:16:36.860 --> 1:16:38.860
 It's written in Python

1:16:38.860 --> 1:16:41.860
 and uses some of those same elements.

1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:43.860
 Like it allows you to animate equations

1:16:43.860 --> 1:16:45.860
 and animate little shapes.

1:16:45.860 --> 1:16:47.860
 Like people that, you know,

1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:49.860
 he has a very distinct style in his videos

1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:51.860
 and what that resulted in,

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:53.860
 even though from a software engineer perspective,

1:16:53.860 --> 1:16:55.860
 the code he released is not like

1:16:55.860 --> 1:16:58.860
 super well documented or perfect,

1:16:58.860 --> 1:17:01.860
 but him releasing that,

1:17:01.860 --> 1:17:03.860
 now there's all of these people

1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:04.860
 educating it.

1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:06.860
 And the, to me personally,

1:17:06.860 --> 1:17:09.860
 the coolest thing is to see like

1:17:09.860 --> 1:17:11.860
 people they're not, you know,

1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:14.860
 don't have like a million subscribers or something.

1:17:14.860 --> 1:17:17.860
 They have just a few views in the video,

1:17:17.860 --> 1:17:20.860
 but it just seems like the process of them

1:17:20.860 --> 1:17:23.860
 creating a video where they teach

1:17:23.860 --> 1:17:25.860
 is like transformative to them

1:17:25.860 --> 1:17:26.860
 from a student perspective.

1:17:26.860 --> 1:17:27.860
 It's the old Feynman thing,

1:17:27.860 --> 1:17:29.860
 the best way to learn is to teach.

1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:32.860
 And then him releasing that into the wild is,

1:17:32.860 --> 1:17:35.860
 it shows that, that impact.

1:17:35.860 --> 1:17:36.860
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:39.860
 I think just giving people that idea

1:17:39.860 --> 1:17:41.860
 that you can do that with maths

1:17:41.860 --> 1:17:42.860
 and other subjects,

1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:45.860
 there's bound to be people all around

1:17:45.860 --> 1:17:48.860
 who can create more, which is cool.

1:17:48.860 --> 1:17:50.860
 Yeah, definitely.

1:17:50.860 --> 1:17:52.860
 So I recommend people do like JavaScript or Python.

1:17:52.860 --> 1:17:54.860
 You can, you can build like visualizations

1:17:54.860 --> 1:17:57.860
 of most concepts in high school math.

1:17:57.860 --> 1:17:59.860
 You can do a lot of kinds of visualizations

1:17:59.860 --> 1:18:00.860
 and doing that yourself.

1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:02.860
 Plus, if you do that yourself,

1:18:02.860 --> 1:18:03.860
 people will really love it.

1:18:03.860 --> 1:18:05.860
 People actually,

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:08.860
 people love visualizations of math.

1:18:08.860 --> 1:18:09.860
 Yeah.

1:18:09.860 --> 1:18:11.860
 Because they, I mean, it's something in us

1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:12.860
 that loves patterns,

1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:14.860
 loves figuring out difficult things

1:18:14.860 --> 1:18:16.860
 and the patterns in there

1:18:16.860 --> 1:18:18.860
 that are unexpected in some way.

1:18:18.860 --> 1:18:19.860
 Yeah.

1:18:19.860 --> 1:18:21.860
 Have you ever noticed that hotels

1:18:21.860 --> 1:18:23.860
 are always filled with patterns?

1:18:23.860 --> 1:18:25.860
 I was just noticing at the hotel.

1:18:25.860 --> 1:18:28.860
 I mean, now all of their carpets are pattern carpets

1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:30.860
 and then they have patterns on the walls.

1:18:30.860 --> 1:18:31.860
 Yeah.

1:18:31.860 --> 1:18:32.860
 So, yeah.

1:18:32.860 --> 1:18:35.860
 We humans love the symmetry in patterns,

1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:38.860
 the breaking of symmetry in patterns.

1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:39.860
 Yeah.

1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:42.860
 And it's funny that we don't see mathematics

1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:44.860
 as somehow intricately connected to that,

1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:45.860
 but it is, right?

1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:48.860
 I mean, that's one of the perspectives I love students to take,

1:18:48.860 --> 1:18:50.860
 is to be a pattern seeker.

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:51.860
 In everything.

1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:52.860
 Yeah.

1:18:52.860 --> 1:18:53.860
 Certainly in all of maths.

1:18:53.860 --> 1:18:55.860
 I mean, you can think of all of maths

1:18:55.860 --> 1:18:57.860
 as a kind of subject of patterns

1:18:57.860 --> 1:18:59.860
 and not just visual patterns,

1:18:59.860 --> 1:19:05.860
 but when you think about multiplying by five

1:19:05.860 --> 1:19:07.860
 and the fact you can,

1:19:07.860 --> 1:19:10.860
 if you're multiplying 18 times five,

1:19:10.860 --> 1:19:14.860
 you can instead think of nine times 10.

1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:16.860
 That's a pattern that always works in mathematics.

1:19:16.860 --> 1:19:18.860
 You can halve a number and double a number.

1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:20.860
 And so, yeah, I just think there are patterns everywhere

1:19:20.860 --> 1:19:24.860
 and if kids are thinking their role is to see patterns

1:19:24.860 --> 1:19:27.860
 and find patterns, it's really exciting.

1:19:27.860 --> 1:19:31.860
 What do you think about, like, MIT OpenCourseWare

1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:35.860
 and the release of lectures by universities?

1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:37.860
 I think it's good.

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:38.860
 I think it's good.

1:19:38.860 --> 1:19:43.860
 I think that is what started the MOOC I did,

1:19:43.860 --> 1:19:45.860
 was using that platform.

1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:48.860
 See, you ultimately think, like, the Udacity models

1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:50.860
 is a little bit more effective

1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:52.860
 than just a plane to our lecture.

1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:55.860
 I think there's definitely you can bring in good pedagogy

1:19:55.860 --> 1:19:56.860
 into online learning.

1:19:56.860 --> 1:19:59.860
 And I think the idea of putting things online

1:19:59.860 --> 1:20:02.860
 so that people all over the world can access them is great.

1:20:02.860 --> 1:20:05.860
 I don't think the initial excitement around MOOCs,

1:20:05.860 --> 1:20:10.860
 sort of democratizing education and making it more equal,

1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:13.860
 came about because they found that the people taking MOOCs

1:20:13.860 --> 1:20:16.860
 tended to be the more privileged people.

1:20:16.860 --> 1:20:20.860
 So that was, I think, there's still something to be found

1:20:20.860 --> 1:20:22.860
 in that there's still more to be done

1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:27.860
 to help that online learning reach those principles.

1:20:27.860 --> 1:20:31.860
 But definitely, I think it's a good invention

1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:34.860
 and I have an online class that's for kids,

1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:36.860
 that's a little free class that gives them...

1:20:36.860 --> 1:20:37.860
 What's the topic?

1:20:37.860 --> 1:20:39.860
 It's called How to Learn Maths.

1:20:39.860 --> 1:20:40.860
 How to Learn Maths?

1:20:40.860 --> 1:20:43.860
 It shows maths as this visual creative subject

1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:46.860
 and it shares mindset and some brain science.

1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:50.860
 And kids who take it do better in maths class.

1:20:50.860 --> 1:20:53.860
 We've studied it with, like, randomized controlled trials

1:20:53.860 --> 1:20:56.860
 and given it to middle school kids

1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:59.860
 and other middle school kids who don't take it

1:20:59.860 --> 1:21:00.860
 but are taught by the same teachers,

1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:02.860
 so their teachers are the same.

1:21:02.860 --> 1:21:04.860
 And the kids who take the online class

1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:08.860
 end up 68% more engaged in their maths class

1:21:08.860 --> 1:21:10.860
 and do better at the end of the year.

1:21:10.860 --> 1:21:14.860
 So that's a little six session, 15 minute class

1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:18.860
 and it changes kids maths relationship.

1:21:18.860 --> 1:21:23.860
 So it is true that we can do that with some words

1:21:23.860 --> 1:21:27.860
 that aren't, you know, it's not a huge change

1:21:27.860 --> 1:21:29.860
 to the education system.

1:21:29.860 --> 1:21:32.860
 Do you have advice for young people?

1:21:32.860 --> 1:21:35.860
 We've been talking about mathematics quite a bit,

1:21:35.860 --> 1:21:38.860
 but in terms of their journey through education,

1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:41.860
 through their career choices, through life,

1:21:41.860 --> 1:21:45.860
 maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students,

1:21:45.860 --> 1:21:49.860
 how to live a life that they can be proud of.

1:21:49.860 --> 1:21:53.860
 I think if I were to give advice to people,

1:21:53.860 --> 1:21:55.860
 especially young people,

1:21:55.860 --> 1:22:00.860
 my advice would be to always, it sounds really corny,

1:22:00.860 --> 1:22:04.860
 but always believe in yourself and know that you can achieve

1:22:04.860 --> 1:22:07.860
 because although that sounds like obvious,

1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:09.860
 of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things.

1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:13.860
 I know that millions of kids who are in the school system

1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:16.860
 have been given the message they cannot do things.

1:22:16.860 --> 1:22:19.860
 And adults too, they have the idea,

1:22:19.860 --> 1:22:22.860
 oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job

1:22:22.860 --> 1:22:25.860
 because those other things I could never have done okay in.

1:22:25.860 --> 1:22:27.860
 So actually when they hear,

1:22:27.860 --> 1:22:30.860
 hey, maybe you could do those other things.

1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:34.860
 Even adults think, maybe I can.

1:22:34.860 --> 1:22:37.860
 And they go back and they encounter this knowledge

1:22:37.860 --> 1:22:40.860
 and they relearn things and they change careers

1:22:40.860 --> 1:22:42.860
 and amazing things happen.

1:22:42.860 --> 1:22:45.860
 So for me, I think that message is really important.

1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:46.860
 You can learn anything.

1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.860
 Scientists try and find a limit.

1:22:49.860 --> 1:22:50.860
 They're always trying to find a limit.

1:22:50.860 --> 1:22:51.860
 Like how much can you really learn?

1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:53.860
 What's the limit to how much you can learn?

1:22:53.860 --> 1:22:55.860
 And they always come away not being able to find it.

1:22:55.860 --> 1:22:58.860
 People can just go further and further and further.

1:22:58.860 --> 1:23:02.860
 And that is true of people born with brain,

1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:05.860
 areas of their brain that aren't functioning well

1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:07.860
 that have what we call special needs.

1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:10.860
 Some of those people also go on to develop

1:23:10.860 --> 1:23:12.860
 and do amazing things.

1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:16.860
 So I think that really experiencing that,

1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:18.860
 knowing that feeling, not just saying it,

1:23:18.860 --> 1:23:21.860
 but knowing it deeply.

1:23:21.860 --> 1:23:27.860
 You can learn anything is something I wish all people would have.

1:23:27.860 --> 1:23:31.860
 It actually also applies when you've achieved some level of success too.

1:23:31.860 --> 1:23:35.860
 What I find in my life with people that love me,

1:23:35.860 --> 1:23:39.860
 when you achieve success, they keep celebrating your success

1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:44.860
 and they want you to keep doing the thing that you were successful at

1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:48.860
 as opposed to believing in that you can do something else.

1:23:48.860 --> 1:23:50.860
 Whatever your heart says to do.

1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:56.860
 And one of the things that I realized the value of this,

1:23:56.860 --> 1:23:59.860
 quite recently, which is sad to say,

1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:02.860
 is how important it is to seek out,

1:24:02.860 --> 1:24:04.860
 when you're younger to seek out mentors,

1:24:04.860 --> 1:24:06.860
 to seek out the people,

1:24:06.860 --> 1:24:09.860
 surround yourself with people that will believe in you.

1:24:09.860 --> 1:24:12.860
 It's like a little bit is on you.

1:24:12.860 --> 1:24:19.860
 It's like you don't get that sometimes if you go to like grad school,

1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:21.860
 you think you kind of land on a mentor,

1:24:21.860 --> 1:24:24.860
 maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic they're interested in.

1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:27.860
 But the reality is the people you surround yourself with,

1:24:27.860 --> 1:24:31.860
 they're going to define your life trajectory.

1:24:31.860 --> 1:24:33.860
 So select people that...

1:24:33.860 --> 1:24:34.860
 That's really true.

1:24:34.860 --> 1:24:37.860
 And get away from people who don't believe in you.

1:24:37.860 --> 1:24:39.860
 Sometimes parents can be that.

1:24:39.860 --> 1:24:43.860
 They love you deeply, but they set...

1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:45.860
 It's the math thing we mentioned.

1:24:45.860 --> 1:24:50.860
 They might set certain constraints on the beliefs that you have.

1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:54.860
 And in that, if you're interested in mathematics,

1:24:54.860 --> 1:24:56.860
 your parents are not that interested in it,

1:24:56.860 --> 1:24:58.860
 don't listen to your parents on that one dimension.

1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:00.860
 Exactly.

1:25:00.860 --> 1:25:02.860
 And if people tell you you can't do things,

1:25:02.860 --> 1:25:06.860
 you have to hear from other people who believe in you.

1:25:06.860 --> 1:25:08.860
 I think you're absolutely right about that.

1:25:08.860 --> 1:25:13.860
 It's so sad the number of people who've had those negative messages from parents.

1:25:13.860 --> 1:25:15.860
 In my limitless mind book,

1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:18.860
 I interviewed quite a few people who'd been told they couldn't do math,

1:25:18.860 --> 1:25:21.860
 sometimes by parents, sometimes by teachers.

1:25:21.860 --> 1:25:25.860
 And fortunately, they had got other ideas at some point in their life

1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:31.860
 and realized there was this whole world of mathematical thinking that was open to them.

1:25:31.860 --> 1:25:38.860
 So it's really important that people do connect with people who believe in them.

1:25:38.860 --> 1:25:41.860
 However hard that might be to find those people.

1:25:41.860 --> 1:25:44.860
 What do you hope the education system,

1:25:44.860 --> 1:25:48.860
 education in general looks like 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now?

1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:50.860
 Are you optimistic about this future?

1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:52.860
 Yeah, I definitely have hope.

1:25:52.860 --> 1:25:55.860
 There is change can happen in the education system.

1:25:55.860 --> 1:26:00.860
 In recent years, it's been microscopically slow.

1:26:00.860 --> 1:26:06.860
 But I do actually see change happening.

1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:10.860
 We were talking earlier that data science is now,

1:26:10.860 --> 1:26:13.860
 of course, you can take in high school instead of Algebra II.

1:26:13.860 --> 1:26:19.860
 And that's pretty amazing because that content was set out in 1892

1:26:19.860 --> 1:26:21.860
 and hasn't changed since then.

1:26:21.860 --> 1:26:26.860
 And so now we're actually seeing a change in the content of high school.

1:26:26.860 --> 1:26:30.860
 So I'm amazed that that's happening and very happy it's happening.

1:26:30.860 --> 1:26:33.860
 But so change is very slow in education usually.

1:26:33.860 --> 1:26:39.860
 But when you look ahead and think about all that we know

1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:43.860
 and all that we can offer kids in terms of technology,

1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:47.860
 you've got to think that 100 years from now,

1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:51.860
 education will be totally different to the way it is now.

1:26:51.860 --> 1:26:55.860
 Maybe we won't have subject boundaries anymore

1:26:55.860 --> 1:26:58.860
 because those don't really make much sense.

1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:03.860
 It's interesting to think how certain tools like programming,

1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:05.860
 maybe they'll be deeply integrated in everything we do.

1:27:05.860 --> 1:27:11.860
 You would think that all kids are growing up learning to program and create.

1:27:11.860 --> 1:27:16.860
 So I just think the system of schooling we have now,

1:27:16.860 --> 1:27:18.860
 people call it a factory model,

1:27:18.860 --> 1:27:23.860
 it's not designed to inspire creativity.

1:27:23.860 --> 1:27:26.860
 And I feel like that will also change.

1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:30.860
 People might look back on these days and think they were hilarious,

1:27:30.860 --> 1:27:34.860
 but maybe in the future kids will be doing their own programming

1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:37.860
 and they'll be able to learn things and find out things

1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:39.860
 and create things even as they're learning.

1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:45.860
 And maybe the individual subject boundaries will go.

1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:48.860
 Data science itself coming into the education system

1:27:48.860 --> 1:27:51.860
 kind of illustrates that because people realize

1:27:51.860 --> 1:27:55.860
 it doesn't really fit inside any of the subjects.

1:27:55.860 --> 1:27:57.860
 So what do we do with it?

1:27:57.860 --> 1:27:58.860
 Where does it go?

1:27:58.860 --> 1:28:00.860
 And who teaches it?

1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:04.860
 So it's already raising those kind of questions

1:28:04.860 --> 1:28:08.860
 and questioning how we have these different subject boundaries.

1:28:08.860 --> 1:28:11.860
 So you've seen data science be integrated into the curriculum?

1:28:11.860 --> 1:28:12.860
 Yes.

1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:15.860
 It's happening across the United States as we speak.

1:28:15.860 --> 1:28:16.860
 I wonder how they got initiated.

1:28:16.860 --> 1:28:19.860
 Like how does change happen in the education system?

1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:21.860
 Is it just a few revolutionary leaders?

1:28:21.860 --> 1:28:22.860
 It does.

1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:23.860
 I think so.

1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:24.860
 I think so.

1:28:24.860 --> 1:28:27.860
 It's been an interesting journey seeing data science take off actually.

1:28:27.860 --> 1:28:34.860
 There was a course that was developed in 2014

1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:36.860
 by some people who thought data science

1:28:36.860 --> 1:28:38.860
 was a good idea for high schoolers.

1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:41.860
 And then after some kids took the course

1:28:41.860 --> 1:28:43.860
 and nothing bad happened to them,

1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:48.860
 they went to college and people started to accept it more.

1:28:48.860 --> 1:28:51.860
 And then this was a big piece of the change in California.

1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:54.860
 The UC system communicated.

1:28:54.860 --> 1:28:57.860
 They sent out an email last year to 50,000 high schools

1:28:57.860 --> 1:28:59.860
 saying we now accept data science.

1:28:59.860 --> 1:29:01.860
 Kids can take it instead of Algebra II.

1:29:01.860 --> 1:29:04.860
 That's a perfectly legitimate college pathway.

1:29:04.860 --> 1:29:07.860
 So that was like a big green light for a lot of schools

1:29:07.860 --> 1:29:10.860
 who were like wondering about whether they could teach it.

1:29:10.860 --> 1:29:14.860
 So I think it happens in small spaces and expands.

1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:15.860
 It goes viral.

1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:16.860
 Yeah.

1:29:16.860 --> 1:29:17.860
 And it's a lot of age.

1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:18.860
 Then it goes viral.

1:29:18.860 --> 1:29:23.860
 California is ahead, I think, in creating courses

1:29:23.860 --> 1:29:25.860
 and having kids go through it.

1:29:25.860 --> 1:29:28.860
 But suddenly when I last looked,

1:29:28.860 --> 1:29:31.860
 there were 12 states that were allowing data science

1:29:31.860 --> 1:29:32.860
 as a high school course.

1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:37.860
 And I think by next year, that will have doubled or more.

1:29:37.860 --> 1:29:40.860
 So a change is happening.

1:29:40.860 --> 1:29:47.860
 Joe, as I said, I think mathematics is truly a beautiful subject.

1:29:47.860 --> 1:29:51.860
 And you having an impact on millions of people's lives

1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:55.860
 by educating them, by inspiring teachers to educate

1:29:55.860 --> 1:29:57.860
 in the ways that you've talked about,

1:29:57.860 --> 1:30:00.860
 in multidimensional ways, in visual ways,

1:30:00.860 --> 1:30:02.860
 I think is incredible.

1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:05.860
 You're spreading beauty into the world.

1:30:05.860 --> 1:30:07.860
 So I really, really appreciate that you

1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:09.860
 have spent your valuable time with me today.

1:30:09.860 --> 1:30:10.860
 Thank you for talking.

1:30:10.860 --> 1:30:11.860
 Thank you.

1:30:11.860 --> 1:30:12.860
 It was really good to talk to you.

1:30:12.860 --> 1:30:14.860
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Bowler.

 Now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

1:30:23.860 --> 1:30:28.860
 Pure mathematics is the poetry of logical ideas.

1:30:28.860 --> 1:30:50.860
 Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
