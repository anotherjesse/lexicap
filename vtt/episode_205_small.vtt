 The following is a conversation with Zach Bitter, ultra marathon runner and coach who held multiple

00:05.600 --> 00:12.000
 world records in the 100 mile run and other ultra endurance events. He is currently training for

00:12.000 --> 00:18.400
 a run across America, which for now is planned for September this year. Like many of the things

00:18.400 --> 00:24.960
 Zach has done in the past, this is a big, fascinating challenge. Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:24.960 --> 00:31.520
 Ladder, Velcampo, Noom and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.480
 As a side note, let me say that Zach has been advising and coaching me on my own

00:36.480 --> 00:41.200
 running journey. I want to mention that Zach sent me some running shoes from Ultra,

00:41.200 --> 00:46.160
 which I think is a company that sponsors him. When I put those shoes on, I feel like Zach is

00:46.160 --> 00:52.320
 watching me and I get that extra motivation to make him proud. And by that, I mean I want to put

00:52.320 --> 00:57.120
 a lot of miles on those shoes. Running is something that has always been difficult for me,

00:57.120 --> 01:03.120
 but I love it because it is difficult. The hardest part is I'm left alone with my thoughts

01:03.120 --> 01:09.680
 for one or two hours. Some thoughts are dark, like thinking about mortality, my own and that of

01:09.680 --> 01:16.960
 others. Some are self critical, like personal weaknesses or dreams not realized. Some are simply

01:16.960 --> 01:23.760
 human feelings of loneliness, personal and existential. And yet, there are the moments

01:23.760 --> 01:30.240
 during a run when all that fades and I'm left empty of negative thoughts and full of appreciation

01:30.240 --> 01:36.640
 for the beauty of experience, of nature, life, the whole thing. This is why I return to running,

01:37.440 --> 01:43.360
 not to get in shape, but to face myself and to run through it. That's why I'm inspired by people

01:43.360 --> 01:50.160
 like Zach and by David Goggins and others like them who seek to find the limits of their body

01:50.160 --> 01:56.800
 and mind. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Zach Bitter.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.440
 Where does your mind go when you're running an ultramarathon? Are there a lot of positive

02:03.440 --> 02:08.560
 thoughts, negative thoughts, demons, inspirational things, maybe no thoughts at all?

02:08.560 --> 02:12.240
 Yeah, that's the really interesting part of the sport, I think, because you can,

02:12.240 --> 02:15.920
 essentially what it is when we're looking at like the 100 mile distance or anything that's

02:15.920 --> 02:21.760
 like all day long is you're going to have the full range of the full spectrum of emotions

02:21.760 --> 02:26.800
 of mental processes, both kind of positive, negative and in between. So it almost feels like

02:27.440 --> 02:34.320
 you've lived multiple, multiple lives or full life maybe is his way to say it in that one time

02:34.320 --> 02:38.400
 period. So it's like a, it's almost like a simulation of what you may experience in a

02:38.400 --> 02:42.880
 long period of time in a very condensed period of time. And I think that's just a weird mental

02:42.880 --> 02:48.080
 process to reflect upon and that's what kind of draws people back to it. But I mean, it's a battle

02:48.080 --> 02:52.480
 too, because if you're looking at it from a performance standpoint versus an experience,

02:52.480 --> 02:56.640
 you obviously want to minimize the negative mindset stuff. You want to try to keep those

02:56.640 --> 03:03.680
 emotions and those thought processes at a low. And I think when you can keep yourself from

03:03.680 --> 03:09.760
 letting those thoughts creep in, they, you end up having better races and it's, it can spiral in

03:09.760 --> 03:14.080
 either direction. Like I noticed like there's, there's kind of like this scenario that occurs

03:14.080 --> 03:18.000
 where in the beginning, like a negative thing creeps in your mind, it's like super easy just

03:18.000 --> 03:21.920
 to slap it down and say like, get out of here. You know, I've did the training, I'm fit, I'm

03:21.920 --> 03:26.960
 feeling fresh still, you know, everything's going well at this point in time. You get a little

03:26.960 --> 03:31.760
 further along in the race and you're starting to feel a bit of the fatigue, maybe a little bit

03:31.760 --> 03:35.440
 of self doubt creeps in, you start asking yourself, well, you know, maybe I should have done one more

03:35.440 --> 03:40.160
 long run or did I, did I not quite taper long enough? And those things can kind of spiral

03:40.160 --> 03:45.440
 into a negative way. And if, if you let it keep going, it keeps going all the way to like,

03:46.080 --> 03:52.320
 why am I here? Why am I doing this? This is stupid. All the way to like, there's another

03:52.320 --> 03:55.360
 one of these two weeks from now, I'm going to drop out of this one and sign up for that one

03:55.360 --> 03:59.440
 instead. And then you just find yourself in the exact same situation. So you kind of have to

03:59.440 --> 04:05.680
 go through the process, I think it's why I think the there's kind of a, I wouldn't say it's a rule

04:05.680 --> 04:10.880
 of thumb necessarily, but something I think is fairly valuable. If you do a hundred mile

04:10.880 --> 04:17.520
 of the first time, make sure you get it done. Even if it means like, you know, death marching is

04:17.520 --> 04:22.080
 what they'll call it in the alternate community to end of the race. Just to say like, you got

04:22.080 --> 04:26.560
 that full experience, you experienced the highs, the lows, the full thing, the starting, the crossing,

04:26.560 --> 04:32.080
 the finish line, that release of emotion when you're done and all that stuff. So that when you

04:32.080 --> 04:37.200
 go back to do it again, you have like a template to build off of, and you know, or you just have

04:37.200 --> 04:40.960
 some data to pull from about how your mind is going to work as well as your body so that you

04:40.960 --> 04:45.040
 can start practicing, well, what do I have to do to kind of keep my mind from spiraling in a negative

04:45.040 --> 04:50.720
 direction? Or how do I catch some positive momentum and kind of keep sending it that way and things

04:50.720 --> 04:57.120
 like that. And that just I think you just add to that over a career of running them or a series of

04:57.120 --> 05:01.760
 running them. And it sharpens. It's kind of like any sport with that where, you know, you always

05:01.760 --> 05:06.720
 have this balance between the youthfulness that you may have earlier in your career versus the

05:06.720 --> 05:10.800
 wise intelligence that you have maybe near the end of your career. So in terms of wisdom,

05:11.520 --> 05:18.160
 is there mechanisms by which you kind of observe the negative thoughts and let them go? So you have

05:18.160 --> 05:25.280
 people like the David Goggins is who kind of, he seems to almost like separate his mind into

05:26.320 --> 05:33.200
 there's the weak David that he hates. And then there's this strong one. I mean, there's like a

05:33.200 --> 05:39.680
 very contentious relationship there. So he basically says like, I refuse to be that person. And he's

05:39.680 --> 05:44.320
 almost like angry at that person. He's almost like sometimes literally yelling at that person,

05:44.320 --> 05:49.200
 the weak version of themselves. And then there's another more sort of Sam Heresy approach,

05:50.480 --> 05:58.240
 which is like, just observe the thought and let it go. Maybe knowing that this two shall pass,

05:58.240 --> 06:03.680
 like no matter what, this moment will not last forever and kind of sort of accepting the natural

06:03.680 --> 06:08.880
 flow of things and taking one step at a time and allowing whatever the negativity, whatever the

06:08.880 --> 06:15.360
 pain you're experiencing, just to pass, even if it means a death march, which one is more effective

06:15.360 --> 06:20.000
 for you? Which one, like, would you say generally speaking to the population is more effective?

06:20.640 --> 06:25.200
 Yeah, that's a really good question. It's probably unique to the individual. I wouldn't

06:25.200 --> 06:32.400
 argue that, you know, David is finding success with his approach. Some may argue it's an extreme

06:32.400 --> 06:38.960
 version. You know, Sam has obviously thought about these things and really probably, you know, I see

06:38.960 --> 06:44.640
 those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum in just the way that they kind of come across in

06:44.640 --> 06:50.000
 general, where like David's like really actually a kind of high energy and Sam's kind of this calming,

06:50.000 --> 06:55.280
 soft presence, and he's just going to slowly methodically lay it all out there. And I think

06:55.280 --> 07:00.240
 there's value in both of those. I think most people are probably going to get a benefit from

07:00.240 --> 07:06.160
 pulling some from each. I mean, there's times where I need a kick in the ass and then it's like

07:06.160 --> 07:11.200
 have the Strong's Act, tell the Weeks Act to get moving. But there's also times where, you know,

07:11.200 --> 07:15.840
 it's just like, you know, a subtle voice entering my head about, you know, I don't know if I feel

07:15.840 --> 07:22.080
 quite right now, should I maybe pull back on the pace? And I think that little subtle voice

07:22.480 --> 07:26.800
 is best approached with a subtle positive voice where it's more like, okay, well, let's think

07:26.800 --> 07:32.400
 this through here for a second. You're 40 miles into a 100 mile race, you spent four months

07:32.400 --> 07:38.000
 preparing for it. You know from the workouts you did that you're ready for this, there really isn't

07:38.000 --> 07:44.960
 any real reason for you to slow down or to fall off your goal or your pace or, you know, reassess

07:44.960 --> 07:50.960
 what you're doing. Let's just give this another mile or two. And then we can reassess if we need

07:50.960 --> 07:56.000
 to in order to kind of figure out if I'm doing the right things or not. And I think like in that

07:56.000 --> 08:01.200
 situation, you definitely probably want to lean more towards the Sam Harris approach with that

08:01.200 --> 08:04.720
 because there's really no reason to, it's almost like the same thing you see with like

08:05.520 --> 08:11.040
 just training and even nutrition to a degree where like some folks, they just want to be like,

08:11.040 --> 08:16.240
 kind of like drilled. They want to be like yell that and said like, get going, get doing this.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.640
 And that helps and that motivates and that helps them stay accountable. Other people need some

08:20.640 --> 08:26.080
 softer love with it where it's like, you know, this isn't necessarily your fault. You were put

08:26.080 --> 08:31.120
 in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy and maybe poor nutritional

08:31.120 --> 08:38.240
 choices and things like that. And so, but it's correctable. So we need to step away from that

08:38.240 --> 08:41.280
 and we need to kind of start heading in the direction that we know is going to bear fruit

08:41.280 --> 08:47.440
 down the road. And that person may respond better to that. So I think both those guys have great

08:47.440 --> 08:52.400
 value with their approaches. They're just probably polar ends of the spectrum and I think most people

08:52.400 --> 08:56.000
 are probably going to benefit like anything, right? You get the polarizing ones and those

08:56.000 --> 08:59.200
 are going to work great for the polarizing people, but then most people are going to fit somewhere

08:59.200 --> 09:03.440
 in the middle. So they're probably going to be able to kind of pull from both of those if they're

09:03.440 --> 09:07.600
 able to sit down and kind of like assess which one's going to work better in which situation.

09:07.600 --> 09:12.800
 So the quitting thing that you mentioned, the like the final stage, which actually I get to

09:12.800 --> 09:18.400
 much quicker than you seem to, which is like, why am I doing this? I get there with basically

09:18.400 --> 09:24.880
 anything I do. It's like, this is probably the stupidest thing I've ever done is the feeling

09:24.880 --> 09:30.320
 I get often. And then immediately you have these excuses that are like, there's all these other

09:30.320 --> 09:35.520
 better things you should be doing. Or the other alternative of that, like you said,

09:36.320 --> 09:41.440
 I'm not prepared enough for this moment. I'll be much more prepared in two weeks for the next

09:41.440 --> 09:46.720
 event. So like, why, let's try this again. Let's start over. Let's start over in two weeks.

09:47.600 --> 09:55.760
 How do you deal with that quit? Like, so maybe do you still go through that process and by way

09:55.760 --> 10:01.840
 of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like me? How to deal with that quitting

10:01.840 --> 10:08.640
 voice? I think a lot of times when the quitting voice kind of comes in, it what it does is it

10:08.640 --> 10:15.280
 kind of just it comes in with the added disadvantage, I guess, in this situation of being kind of a

10:15.280 --> 10:21.840
 narrow scoped view where you're looking at like, what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're

10:21.840 --> 10:27.760
 feeling in the moment versus how are you feeling about the whole process. So one thing that I

10:27.760 --> 10:36.240
 started doing in 2019, and I think I don't think it's necessarily, I think, I think, I think this

10:36.240 --> 10:40.960
 was a big reason why I had one of my best racing seasons in 2019 that I had had to that date.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.960
 It was part of it was I started, I think, putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus

10:47.600 --> 10:55.360
 putting emphasis on like, this is one opportunity or one day of work. And this is one, one emotional

10:55.360 --> 11:01.760
 kind of flare up. But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture? So when I

11:01.760 --> 11:07.520
 decide to do a race or an event or something like that, it's often four or six months out ahead of

11:07.520 --> 11:12.400
 time, you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're

11:12.400 --> 11:16.080
 going through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day and

11:16.080 --> 11:21.760
 all that stuff. And then you get to the race itself or the event itself. And it's very easy to look

11:21.760 --> 11:27.360
 at that and think that's an isolation, like I'm going to run 12 hours today, or I'm going to run

11:27.360 --> 11:33.760
 100 miles today or whatever it ends up being. And it's a lot easier to quit when you think to

11:33.760 --> 11:40.320
 yourself, I'm 40 miles into 100 mile race, you know, that's just a 40 mile run, which sounds kind

11:40.320 --> 11:44.640
 of silly to most people. But in perspective, and we're talking about the ultra marathon running

11:44.640 --> 11:48.560
 community, you know, it's a lot easier just to say like, well, you know, I'll scrap this 40 miles

11:48.560 --> 11:54.800
 and try again. It's a lot harder to say, I'm going to scrap the entire last four months, the entire

11:54.800 --> 11:59.920
 reason why I was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there. So I think I just try to reposition

11:59.920 --> 12:05.840
 it of like, I'm in a bad place right now, maybe in my head or I'm hitting a low point here. But

12:05.840 --> 12:11.280
 I'm 99% of the way towards the goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did

12:11.280 --> 12:18.400
 leading up to that. So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because I mean, there are times

12:18.400 --> 12:22.240
 when you're doing something and you ask yourself why and you don't have a good reason. And then

12:22.240 --> 12:27.360
 maybe it is advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something

12:27.360 --> 12:32.160
 I actually want to invest time and energy into? Because, you know, someone like yourself who

12:32.160 --> 12:40.000
 is very much into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get,

12:40.000 --> 12:44.160
 I mean, I'm a very curious person. So there's like 100 things I would love to do if I wasn't

12:44.160 --> 12:49.280
 doing what I'm doing. And I know how to enjoy all of them. So at a certain point, though,

12:49.280 --> 12:53.600
 you have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me? And if the answer keeps

12:53.600 --> 12:57.760
 coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that 100 things that

12:57.760 --> 13:02.640
 I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason. And then I just need

13:02.640 --> 13:07.520
 to identify some of those things like, well, why did this one take the top spot out of the 100

13:07.520 --> 13:12.480
 things that I could have picked from? And keeping like a list of those in your head so that when

13:12.480 --> 13:17.120
 you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this? Why am I here? You just have

13:17.120 --> 13:21.120
 those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on that before

13:21.120 --> 13:25.040
 I started this. And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's early, middle,

13:25.040 --> 13:29.120
 or late. And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you had a little

13:29.120 --> 13:32.560
 more of a level head. Well, there's something about the thing you mentioned when you mentioned

13:32.560 --> 13:40.000
 the death march, it seems extremely valuable to just never quitting. Like in the moment,

13:40.000 --> 13:47.280
 if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if you do go through the process and realize

13:47.280 --> 13:52.480
 that it's not, it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your life.

13:52.480 --> 13:59.280
 Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having

13:59.280 --> 14:05.520
 that escape clause from other things in your life. So I've quit on a few things in my life.

14:05.520 --> 14:13.120
 And I think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door. It's almost like a muscle.

14:13.120 --> 14:20.000
 I don't know. So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter.

14:20.000 --> 14:28.880
 You know what I mean? Like, I'm really good at coming up with reasons to quit. My mind is really

14:28.880 --> 14:35.760
 good at that. And I, it feels like I have to come up with like really work hard to make sure

14:35.760 --> 14:41.680
 that there's no quit that never allow myself to quit no matter how stupid the thing I'm doing is.

14:41.680 --> 14:46.800
 I don't know if any of that makes sense, but it just, maybe to rephrase this whole thing.

14:47.360 --> 14:53.360
 Do you think it's good to live life by the ethos of never quit?

14:53.360 --> 14:57.840
 Yeah, that's a really interesting thing. And I think it actually resonates with a lot of

14:57.840 --> 15:03.280
 ultra marathon runners because there seems to be a trend when you have someone who's

15:03.280 --> 15:07.840
 been in the sport for a long time where there's a point where they start the sport, right?

15:07.840 --> 15:13.600
 And they're like, super excited about everything. Everything's new. It's very easy not to quit

15:13.600 --> 15:16.480
 because you're like, Oh, this is the first time I've ever run a 50 case, the first time I've

15:16.480 --> 15:19.840
 ever run a 50 miles, the first time I've ever run a 100 case, the first time I've ever run 100

15:19.840 --> 15:25.040
 case, the first time I've ever run a 100 miles and so on and so forth. And when you're doing

15:25.040 --> 15:30.160
 that for the first time, I think there's a heightened motivation to not quit because you

15:30.160 --> 15:37.280
 don't want your first attempt to be a failure. And then you get a little further along and you

15:37.280 --> 15:41.040
 start reflecting on the landscape and all the opportunities that are out there and you find

15:41.040 --> 15:47.200
 yourself quitting on an event. And there does seem to be a trend where once you do that once,

15:47.200 --> 15:53.600
 now all of a sudden, like you described perfectly, that quit pops up in your head maybe a little

15:53.600 --> 15:57.920
 sooner the next time or maybe a little bit before. And I've certainly had these experiences in my

15:57.920 --> 16:04.160
 career as well. And what happens, I think, if you stick with it, again, I think it is important

16:04.160 --> 16:09.280
 to assess whether you really want to be doing what you're doing. But if you start recognizing

16:09.280 --> 16:12.640
 that about yourself in a certain activity where it's like, I think I might be pulling the plug

16:12.640 --> 16:18.640
 early on some of this stuff. I think you just need to kind of get into a position where you just,

16:18.640 --> 16:22.320
 at that point, you need to make a decision, do I want to keep doing this? If the answer is yes,

16:22.880 --> 16:27.280
 you hold yourself accountable to not quitting. And eventually what will happen is you'll find

16:27.280 --> 16:31.440
 yourself in a position where I'll use ultramarathon, for example, where you're just clicking on all

16:31.440 --> 16:36.720
 cylinders for that day. And you still get those scenarios where doubt creeps in your mind, you

16:36.720 --> 16:41.680
 have these low points. But for whatever reason, when those low points come, you're able to push

16:41.680 --> 16:45.520
 through them better than you would have in the past. And then you push through maybe two or three

16:45.520 --> 16:51.200
 more than you did after you had quit the time before. Then it's accountability time, right?

16:51.200 --> 16:56.320
 Because then you have to look back at that and say, well, why did this time was I able to be

16:56.320 --> 17:03.600
 mentally more strong and kind of push through those extra opportunities to quit when I wasn't

17:03.600 --> 17:09.840
 before? And it can be easy to look back and say and live kind of retroactively in the sense where

17:09.840 --> 17:13.840
 you're like regretting, well, why did I drop out of those races? Why did I do this wrong there?

17:13.840 --> 17:18.480
 And I just think that's where you have to kind of catch yourself and say, no, those things happen

17:18.480 --> 17:22.880
 to me in order to put me in a position where I decided, well, this time I'm not going to quit,

17:22.880 --> 17:29.200
 no matter what, minus my leg falling off, I'm not going to quit. And then you put yourself in position

17:29.200 --> 17:32.800
 to have that day where you push through more times than you ever have before and you just

17:32.800 --> 17:37.120
 redefine what you're capable of. And then once I think you do that, you start looking at those

17:37.120 --> 17:45.040
 earlier lessons as lessons. Were they failures on paper at the time? Probably. But can you pull

17:45.040 --> 17:49.200
 things from them to learn as to like, well, where is your actual threshold? Where is the limit

17:49.200 --> 17:56.400
 actually for you? And then kind of start redefining that stuff. So I think the never quit

17:56.400 --> 18:01.760
 mentality can be good in certain situations, but I don't think it's necessarily like a

18:01.760 --> 18:06.800
 holistic thing where you need to be in something where it's never quit, always do more, because

18:06.800 --> 18:10.480
 then you end up in a situation where you find this like margin of diminishing returns, especially

18:10.480 --> 18:14.480
 when it comes to training and workouts and things like that, where there are times where,

18:14.480 --> 18:18.560
 often there are times where you want to actually quit a little bit before you would have to,

18:18.560 --> 18:23.600
 because the stress that was required to elicit a growth response has already occurred. And

18:23.600 --> 18:27.200
 then just to do more is just going to require more recovery time to get back and do it again.

18:27.200 --> 18:32.480
 Yeah, this is the tricky trade off. Living by the never quit mentality, you're not going to achieve

18:32.480 --> 18:41.280
 optimal performance. In your head, you might. It seems like when you look at the full arc of human

18:41.280 --> 18:51.120
 history, the people who do great things are more leaning towards the never quit. Like, I feel like

18:51.120 --> 18:58.560
 at any one moment, you're more in danger of quitting than you are of being suboptimal.

18:59.760 --> 19:07.440
 So like, in terms of advice, it just feels like never quitting is always the right advice,

19:08.480 --> 19:14.240
 unless you deeply know the person. Maybe this is like wrestling mentality. I've seen too many,

19:14.240 --> 19:18.720
 and because I'm annoyed with the current culture telling me to relax and have a

19:18.720 --> 19:26.160
 work life balance and all those kinds of things, which all have a deep, deep truth to them.

19:26.160 --> 19:32.240
 But the reality is like, there's not enough people that walk out to me and like slap me and say,

19:32.240 --> 19:38.480
 get your shit together. Like, don't quit. Work harder. I think we need to hear that more.

19:39.680 --> 19:47.280
 And I remember that from the wrestling rooms, like that when you're pushed that way, when you're

19:47.280 --> 19:51.520
 forced to the very limit and you don't quit, that makes better humans.

19:51.520 --> 19:57.200
 I think people need to get that in their life. I think they need to have situations where

19:57.840 --> 20:03.040
 that becomes kind of the reality for them so they can see that avenue, experience that avenue,

20:03.760 --> 20:10.240
 where I think it's maybe to the extreme as if it becomes like your entire life philosophy,

20:10.240 --> 20:13.200
 where like every little thing you do is never quit.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.880
 But life is short, Zach. Like why? I mean, this is the problem I have. This is probably the

20:18.880 --> 20:26.000
 programming thing too, is over optimization is dangerous. It's like every once in a while,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.400
 I mean, you're, you do this kind of stuff. You're not, for example, with a hundred mile run,

20:30.880 --> 20:34.960
 I mean, you could just be doing that for the rest of your life and do like the most optimal

20:34.960 --> 20:40.640
 hundred mile run ever. But you keep taking on like new challenges. And there's a lot more chaos

20:40.640 --> 20:45.680
 than that. And there it feels like the muscle of never quit will be much more important than

20:45.680 --> 20:50.080
 the optimality of your training. Yeah. So there's probably a couple sides to me

20:50.720 --> 20:56.400
 with that kind of a thing where for one, I think when we talked about the why. So like,

20:56.400 --> 21:01.840
 I think the why can kind of shift a bit and it probably will if you do something long enough

21:02.480 --> 21:09.840
 or evolve, maybe is a better way to put it. And for me, like one of my big drives and one of my

21:09.840 --> 21:16.560
 big passions within ultra running is to first of all find an event that I really, really love to

21:16.560 --> 21:20.800
 train for and participate in. So for me, I feel like I've kind of identified that to a degree.

21:20.800 --> 21:27.360
 And that's kind of runnable hundred milers. So once I found that it became more of a driver for

21:27.360 --> 21:32.880
 me to see like, well, how fast can I run a hundred miles in a very controlled environment. So let's

21:32.880 --> 21:38.800
 eliminate weather, let's eliminate, you know, elevation, let's eliminate like having to wait

21:38.800 --> 21:42.800
 extra long to get crew or support and that sort of thing. And that's how you find yourself on a

21:42.800 --> 21:48.560
 400 meter track running a hundred miles. But for me, like that the important part of that is that

21:48.560 --> 21:54.560
 I can control the environment enough where if I come back year after year, I can retest myself

21:54.560 --> 21:59.920
 and have a decent ability to kind of say I improved or I regressed or I stayed stagnant. And I think

21:59.920 --> 22:07.200
 that's a big driver for me. But one thing I've recognized within that is if you just keep doing

22:07.200 --> 22:13.200
 that, like if I could probably pick three flat runnable hundred milers a year and optimally

22:13.200 --> 22:20.080
 prepare, race, recover and repeat without like burning myself out. But one thing I think I learned

22:20.640 --> 22:28.240
 also in 2019 was that sometimes you kind of need to step away from some of these really, really kind

22:28.240 --> 22:33.920
 of important markers in your like your performance or in whatever you're trying to do and take a

22:33.920 --> 22:39.040
 step away from it and try to do something a little different in order to kind of hit the reset button

22:39.040 --> 22:44.400
 on just like what I would call just like your mental energy to be able to continue to do it

22:44.400 --> 22:49.360
 at a high level. So almost like happiness. Exactly. Well, and here's the example. Like,

22:49.360 --> 22:53.360
 I mean, I love running in trails too. Most people would consider me a flat road track

22:53.360 --> 22:59.680
 runner, runnable ultra runner. But I like to do trailer runs too. So and at the end of 2018,

22:59.680 --> 23:07.120
 I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying to run fast hundred

23:07.120 --> 23:11.920
 milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like, okay, I did one. Now

23:11.920 --> 23:15.680
 I'm going to, you know, take a brief off season, but then I'm going to ultimately build up in peak

23:15.680 --> 23:19.760
 for another one. I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're going to be B

23:19.760 --> 23:23.520
 races are going to be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are going to kind of mimic

23:23.520 --> 23:28.960
 like a long run essentially. And but the main focus they always in the back of my mind was like

23:28.960 --> 23:33.440
 getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run 100 miles. And that just kind of that

23:33.440 --> 23:38.800
 energy that it takes to continually think by that, that I think the motivation to keep that

23:38.800 --> 23:43.920
 stoke high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from

23:43.920 --> 23:49.680
 it for a little bit. So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided

23:49.680 --> 23:54.720
 I'm going to prepare for the San Diego 100 mile, which is like a much more elevation

23:54.720 --> 24:01.360
 in a technical trail type of an event. Is that a trail run or no? Yeah. It's a trail 100

24:01.360 --> 24:08.240
 miler actually just kind of just outside of San Diego. And yeah, it goes through it goes over

24:08.240 --> 24:12.160
 part of the Pacific crash trail and stuff. So it's very different than running on a runnable

24:12.160 --> 24:18.000
 surface. So to give you some context, like I ran was it I think just under 17 hours for that race,

24:18.000 --> 24:23.040
 whereas on a flat surface, I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes. So just the environment alone

24:23.040 --> 24:29.360
 added an extra, you know, five plus hours to the day. So it's just a different experience,

24:29.360 --> 24:35.440
 different skill set. And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on

24:35.440 --> 24:41.760
 like splits on a track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat

24:41.760 --> 24:46.080
 environment and start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical

24:46.080 --> 24:52.080
 running skill sets and things like that. And the cool part about it was, first of all, you know,

24:52.080 --> 24:55.280
 when you step away from something and enter something a lot different, I mean, it's still

24:55.280 --> 24:59.520
 running. There's still a huge advantage I had from the running I had done in the past that was

24:59.520 --> 25:05.600
 going to put me in a good position to be successful. But there was a much higher or much

25:05.600 --> 25:10.800
 bigger range of potential improvement for me. So through the like, you know, four plus months

25:10.800 --> 25:15.680
 I spent preparing for that race, you know, I noticed, oh, wow, I'm getting faster on this climb,

25:15.680 --> 25:19.920
 or I'm getting better at descending this technical trail. It was one of the most fun races I've run

25:19.920 --> 25:25.600
 actually. So it was kind of a cool experience. I ended up taking the lead at like 93 miles.

25:25.600 --> 25:29.360
 So you were racing, racing, like you were trying to get first. So still a race.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.080
 Yeah. So what was the enjoyable aspect of it?

25:32.080 --> 25:36.560
 I don't think I recognized it so much while I was doing it, actually, it surfaced afterwards.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.680
 I mean, the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're

25:39.680 --> 25:44.000
 sitting in basically second place all day long, and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was

25:44.000 --> 25:48.480
 like 91 or 92 miles. It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race.

25:48.480 --> 25:55.040
 But afterwards, I recognized a few things just about kind of pacing and, you know,

25:55.040 --> 26:01.600
 how to maybe pace the first half of 100 miler versus the second half. I also recognized shortly

26:01.600 --> 26:06.560
 thereafter, once I finished, recovered and decided my next event was going to be a flat

26:06.560 --> 26:12.800
 runnable race that, wow, I really was way more excited to do the workouts that I needed to do

26:12.800 --> 26:16.880
 to get ready to run a fast flat 100 miler. And I don't think that would have been the case had

26:16.880 --> 26:23.200
 I just tried to do another flat, fast 100 miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation

26:23.200 --> 26:31.600
 where I maybe had normalized a suboptimal outlook on something that I had just done so many times

26:31.600 --> 26:37.360
 already. And I recognized that just every workout I did, I was like, I did this workout a year ago

26:37.360 --> 26:42.640
 and it was not nearly this much fun. And then the interesting thing about these track hundreds too

26:42.640 --> 26:47.040
 is like, you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where you're running your long runs, which

26:47.040 --> 26:51.200
 for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so, and I'll do them back to back days.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.800
 And, you know, I try to replicate the environment I'm going to race on. So I'm

26:54.800 --> 26:59.920
 finding myself on a 400 meter track. And it's like, when I started doing that again, I just felt

26:59.920 --> 27:03.040
 like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those back to back

27:03.040 --> 27:07.440
 long runs and see the progress and then head on again the next week and do it again. So

27:07.440 --> 27:10.720
 I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific

27:10.720 --> 27:15.680
 to race day environment that I had in quite some time. And I think that was really beneficial

27:15.680 --> 27:19.200
 and kind of putting me in a right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day

27:19.200 --> 27:23.120
 and put me in a position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood,

27:23.680 --> 27:26.640
 given the enjoyment I had in the months leading into the race itself.

27:26.640 --> 27:31.280
 Yeah, even the thought of quitting. Yeah. So you mentioned the track,

27:31.280 --> 27:37.920
 you've also ran 100 miles in the treadmill and the trail 100 mile. Broadly, if we zoom out,

27:37.920 --> 27:45.680
 what does it take to run 100 miles? For most of the world, that seems like a crazy distance to run.

27:46.480 --> 27:50.560
 So maybe it's interesting to ask not only is just setting the world record, but

27:51.200 --> 27:55.280
 purely running, what does it take to run that far?

27:55.280 --> 28:00.320
 Yeah, I mean, I think people probably overestimate what it takes in terms of just getting it done.

28:00.320 --> 28:06.160
 I think this is consistent in just running in general. I think the marathon was always a big

28:06.160 --> 28:11.120
 one with that where people thought like, well, you have to do this training or you just literally

28:11.120 --> 28:15.840
 won't physically be able to complete a marathon. And then we got into an era of kind of like

28:15.840 --> 28:20.080
 running as more of an enjoyment thing versus a performance thing. And then you'd have people

28:20.080 --> 28:24.400
 running granted much slower. I think if you look at the Boston marathon, average finishing times,

28:24.400 --> 28:27.920
 it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the Boston marathon, I might have just been marathons in

28:27.920 --> 28:32.480
 general went from like three hours to five hours or something like that. So it's like,

28:32.480 --> 28:37.760
 people I think got past the fact that you can only do it if you're optimally prepared to, well,

28:37.760 --> 28:42.640
 I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm going to like not do much training,

28:42.640 --> 28:48.080
 which I wouldn't necessarily advise. But I mean, I've talked to people who basically run 100 miles,

28:48.080 --> 28:52.640
 sometimes almost off the couch. And it's like, it's, to me, what that says is just the human

28:52.640 --> 28:56.320
 body is incredible and what it can tolerate above and beyond what it's been exposed to,

28:56.320 --> 28:58.400
 if it has to, or if it feels like it has to.

28:58.400 --> 29:04.080
 So that's the basic sort of getting from point A from the start to the finish. It's the human

29:04.080 --> 29:09.440
 body and the human mind is capable of doing it without much preparation. But then you start to

29:09.440 --> 29:16.160
 increase the goal of performance and you try to get to actually a good like the most out of your

29:16.160 --> 29:21.920
 body that you can. How does that start to change then? Going from fun to performance?

29:21.920 --> 29:26.560
 Yeah, I think once you start putting marks or goals on outside of just finishing,

29:26.560 --> 29:30.080
 that's where it starts getting interesting because now you can maybe go on with multiple goals where

29:30.080 --> 29:34.480
 like if one falls off due to something that you didn't expect, then you have another one to target.

29:34.480 --> 29:38.400
 But you can always build those up and try to think like, well, I want to run faster than last

29:38.400 --> 29:43.040
 time or I want to break a course record or an age group record or something like that.

29:43.760 --> 29:48.960
 And that I think is just going to be a little bit of a different mindset because now you're

29:48.960 --> 29:54.560
 looking at every little thing from what do I need to do to prepare as well as what do I need to do

29:54.560 --> 29:59.280
 to be efficient on the day itself? So like transitioning aid stations and things like that or

29:59.920 --> 30:05.840
 do I want to pacer or not? Or does this race allow someone to like hand me a bottle at a

30:05.840 --> 30:10.640
 certain spot or do I have to be in specific areas to get that type of stuff? And what it ends up

30:10.640 --> 30:16.560
 doing is it ends up bringing a lot more variables to the table. And I think it's interesting because

30:16.560 --> 30:23.360
 there's always going to be more variables on the day than you are able to account for. So at a

30:23.360 --> 30:27.040
 certain degree, you have to kind of find yourself in a position where I'm going to make sure I take

30:27.040 --> 30:32.000
 care of the big ones or the ones that are like, obviously, I need to be ready for like my fueling

30:32.000 --> 30:37.120
 strategy, my hydration strategy, my pacing strategy, what workouts are going to put me in a position

30:37.120 --> 30:42.720
 to physiologically have this process go as well as possible. How am I going to like, you know,

30:42.720 --> 30:47.680
 hold myself accountable in aid station transition? So I'm not like having a ton of non moving time

30:47.680 --> 30:53.120
 versus moving time and things like that. So there's these like, big variables that you're aware of

30:53.120 --> 30:57.440
 and you're trying to optimize over the space of variables. So you get to start to play with that

30:58.000 --> 31:01.760
 when you're looking for performance. It's almost like moving from checkers to chess, right? You

31:01.760 --> 31:07.120
 have like, or maybe even like connect four or something like that, where it goes from just

31:07.120 --> 31:10.320
 kind of like, well, one foot in front of the other. And when I get to the next aid station,

31:10.320 --> 31:13.760
 I'll just eat whatever looks good, drink whatever, you know, quenches my thirst and then move on to

31:13.760 --> 31:18.800
 the next one to like, well, which one of these food products is actually going to make me move

31:18.800 --> 31:23.680
 a little faster to the next aid station or, you know, which one of these pacing strategies is

31:23.680 --> 31:29.360
 going to get me to the finish line faster than the other one and that sort of stuff. So it gets

31:29.360 --> 31:34.960
 more complicated, more interesting. And in my opinion, anyway, also there, I mean, but there's

31:34.960 --> 31:39.200
 a breaking point with that too, because like I said, there's an endless number of variables you

31:39.200 --> 31:44.880
 could account for. And as a distance gets longer, that list gets longer too. So you find yourself

31:44.880 --> 31:49.200
 in this position where, where you have to at some point say, okay, I've accounted for everything I

31:49.200 --> 31:54.080
 can reasonably account for. Now I need to be in a mental space where when something happens that

31:54.080 --> 31:59.120
 I wasn't able to account for, I'm able to respond to it with the right decision and keep going and

31:59.120 --> 32:02.320
 not dwell on it. Because that's another thing. I mean, you're running slow enough when you're

32:02.320 --> 32:07.520
 doing 100 miles, where if you make a mistake, you can sit there and just fixate on that mistake

32:07.520 --> 32:11.440
 and say, why did I do that? That cost me 10 minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah. When in reality,

32:11.440 --> 32:14.560
 what you need to do is that happened. Everyone else out here is going to have a situation like

32:14.560 --> 32:20.560
 that at some point. Mine happened now. I need to figure out how I can move forward at the fastest

32:20.560 --> 32:24.880
 sustainable pace and not think about what happened back there. And that's where I think it gets

32:24.880 --> 32:31.200
 really interesting. What would you say it takes to set a world record in the 100 mile?

32:32.240 --> 32:35.520
 First of all, I think you probably have to focus on that specific event.

32:35.520 --> 32:41.280
 I mean, there's the interesting about ultra running where it maybe deviates a bit from just

32:41.280 --> 32:45.600
 other endurance sports is there's such a wide range. I mean, we talked about a little bit when

32:45.600 --> 32:50.560
 I talked with the San Diego 100 versus kind of the flat, runnable stuff. So can you maybe paint

32:50.560 --> 32:54.800
 a picture of what are, there's a huge range of different kinds of ultra marathon events.

32:55.360 --> 33:00.960
 What are like the big ones in your mind? So marathon, we know the distance for a marathon.

33:00.960 --> 33:06.240
 There's the 50k. What are different kinds? There's a 100 mile that in your mind,

33:06.240 --> 33:10.400
 like kind of these islands where people gather off.

33:10.400 --> 33:15.680
 Yeah. So there's a few that really stand out. I would say the three biggest ultra marathons

33:15.680 --> 33:19.280
 right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a historical standpoint, but

33:20.560 --> 33:24.880
 in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100. That's the biggest,

33:24.880 --> 33:30.400
 most competitive 100 miler. It's on the trail side of things in the United States. Then there's

33:30.400 --> 33:34.240
 Ultra Trail Mountain Blanc, which is probably the most competitive 100 miler on the planet right

33:34.240 --> 33:38.080
 now. In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or Ultra Trail Mountain

33:38.080 --> 33:41.840
 Blanc is more competitive. I think in the most recent few years, you're just seeing a lot more

33:42.640 --> 33:46.880
 of the bulk of international talent on the trail side of the sport heading over that way.

33:47.440 --> 33:52.080
 And then you have the road running side of things where the comrades marathon,

33:52.080 --> 33:55.360
 which is technically 56 miles, but they call it the comrades marathon,

33:55.360 --> 34:01.840
 is going to generally be the most competitive ultra marathon. The weird thing is the distance

34:01.840 --> 34:04.400
 thing, right? Because most people in the think of endurance sports, they're thinking about

34:04.400 --> 34:08.800
 precise distances like five kilometers, 10 kilometers and all that stuff. And then you get

34:08.800 --> 34:12.400
 into the ultra running world and it's like, sometimes it's the event. So like the Western

34:12.400 --> 34:16.480
 States itself is much more important than the distance. Right. Yeah. So the Western States 100

34:16.480 --> 34:20.800
 is actually 100.2 miles, which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it, especially

34:20.800 --> 34:24.080
 when you figure like tangents are going to probably account for more than 0.2 miles on a

34:24.080 --> 34:29.360
 100 mile race. But the ultra trail mountain Blanc, you know, that's listed as a 100 miler,

34:29.360 --> 34:34.880
 but it's actually I think like 104, 105 miles. So, you know, it's more, there's different cultures

34:34.880 --> 34:39.760
 too. So the United States is definitely more motivated, I think, to try to get as close to the

34:39.760 --> 34:42.400
 exact distance. You're going to hear maybe a little more grumbling if someone says,

34:42.400 --> 34:47.760
 I signed up for this 100 miler and it turned out to be 103 miles versus like over in Europe,

34:47.760 --> 34:51.200
 they don't really care too much about the distance. They're more interested in like a specific route

34:51.200 --> 34:56.480
 or a loop. It's consistency important in terms of the exact length of the of the route. So like

34:56.480 --> 35:00.720
 you can compare performances from previous years, or are they a little bit more flexible?

35:00.720 --> 35:05.440
 Like they redefine the trail from year to year. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely hard to compare.

35:05.440 --> 35:12.800
 I mean, there's events that take, for example, I would say the best ultra marathoner in the

35:12.800 --> 35:17.760
 world today on the men's side is Jim Wolmsley. The reason I think Jim Wolmsley is the best is

35:17.760 --> 35:24.400
 because he is the most versatile and not only the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at

35:24.400 --> 35:29.840
 almost everything up to 100 miles. So there's a race called the Angeles Crest 100 miler.

35:29.840 --> 35:35.200
 They, the trail has drastically changed from when they originally had that event. And it's a different

35:35.200 --> 35:41.440
 time a year. So it's much warmer on that course. And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back

35:41.440 --> 35:45.440
 and say like, I can't chase that record. But I think Angela Crest, when he looks at the segments

35:45.440 --> 35:50.080
 and the pacing for that one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.840
 So you have that, you have some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like

35:54.400 --> 35:58.400
 preserved, I guess you would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side. I mean,

35:58.400 --> 36:02.320
 comrades is going to be very comparable from one year to the next, because that's a road race.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.640
 And that's where you get, you maybe get like the split in the sport from people who really want

36:06.640 --> 36:13.120
 that kind of like, I want to compare myself to someone who ran this course in 1970 versus like

36:13.120 --> 36:19.040
 someone who just says, I want to be competitive today. And, you know, maybe the weather is going

36:19.040 --> 36:22.720
 to be 30 degrees different from one year to the next on this course. But if I beat everyone on

36:22.720 --> 36:26.640
 this day, then I'm the champion of that big name race, like ultra trail Mont Blanc or Western States

36:26.640 --> 36:31.520
 100. And my legacy will be cemented because I won that big race. And it doesn't matter when or how

36:31.520 --> 36:36.000
 the course was or what the time even was to some degree. When you were optimizing for trying to

36:36.000 --> 36:44.400
 set the world record in the 100 miler, were you doing like analysis of maybe like what were the

36:44.400 --> 36:51.760
 variables you were looking at? Is it more in the realm of the actual race day, the track, what it

36:51.760 --> 36:58.320
 looks like versus like the variables of the training leading up to the, to the race? I mean,

36:58.320 --> 37:04.160
 it evolved a bit. Like I think the, as I learned more about just like what is required to kind of

37:04.160 --> 37:09.040
 really do that stuff. So there's some variables you can control for, you know, I try to control

37:09.040 --> 37:13.200
 for as many as I can. The big one that kind of stands out that you can't necessarily control for

37:13.200 --> 37:17.680
 is it's pretty rare where you get an event where they're just doing 100 miles on a track. It's

37:17.680 --> 37:23.440
 usually like, like an event of like a series of different events where they might be like,

37:23.440 --> 37:27.680
 some people out there doing 50k, some people out there doing 24, someday, like the event I did

37:27.680 --> 37:30.400
 that there's six day folks out there, they're trying to see how far they can get in six days.

37:30.400 --> 37:37.280
 So you have like this much wider range of pacing just due to like the distance. So, you know,

37:37.280 --> 37:43.360
 track protocol is always like you pass on the outside. So if you're running one of the faster

37:43.360 --> 37:49.200
 paces of the day, which when you go on up to six days, you're going to, and you're doing 100 miles,

37:49.200 --> 37:52.480
 you're probably going to be running faster than most people out there. Then, you know,

37:52.480 --> 37:56.320
 you just end up running more because you end up running in lane two around the turns and sometimes

37:56.320 --> 38:00.560
 lane three around the turn. So it's down to those little details that have a big impact. Yeah. So

38:00.560 --> 38:04.000
 I had to build that into my pacing strategy. I also have to build into the pacing strategy,

38:04.000 --> 38:10.800
 like relative non moving time. You know, I did a race just recently as the US track and field

38:10.800 --> 38:15.440
 100 mile road championships and I did not stop once other than like, I guess I technically stopped

38:15.440 --> 38:20.320
 to like in the aid station for like few seconds to like grab bottles and get myself wet because

38:20.320 --> 38:26.640
 it was like 94 degrees that day. But I didn't like stop at all during that race from like what I would

38:26.640 --> 38:31.920
 say is like a long period of time where we're getting up to like a minute, but that's pretty rare

38:31.920 --> 38:37.520
 even on the track. Like when I ran 11 hours and 19 minutes, I think I stopped three times for maybe

38:37.520 --> 38:40.800
 a total of like, I believe I have to look back for sure, but I think it was like three to four

38:40.800 --> 38:44.880
 minutes or something like that. So you got to, you got to figure that into your pacing strategy,

38:44.880 --> 38:49.360
 especially if you're chasing a specific time, because you know, if I'm pacing for, you know,

38:49.360 --> 38:56.880
 at the time, the world record was 1128. So if I'm pacing for say 1127 30 or something like that,

38:56.880 --> 39:01.440
 and I don't account for that three minutes of stoppage, then I might run the exact pace I had

39:01.440 --> 39:07.120
 planned on, but then I'm a minute off of the world record. So 1128, we're talking about 11 hours,

39:07.120 --> 39:12.960
 we're talking about 100 miles. Can you mention what the world record was? What kind of world

39:12.960 --> 39:17.920
 record you set? Can you tell your own story here of what you were able to accomplish?

39:17.920 --> 39:23.680
 That world record that I broke, actually, just recently got rebroke by a guy over in Lithuania,

39:24.640 --> 39:30.240
 Alex Sorkin, phenomenal race. I mean, he's won the 24 All World Championships. He's won the

39:30.240 --> 39:34.480
 Spartathlon, which is another big historic ultramarathon. It's 153 miles, so it's getting

39:34.480 --> 39:40.160
 a little more lengthy than some of the stuff that I've traditionally done. He ran 1114,

39:40.160 --> 39:47.200
 I believe it was 56 or 57. So his pace was 645 per mile. Mine was 647 and a half in terms of

39:47.200 --> 39:55.280
 just like the pacing strategy. It's just really cool because for me, the motivation with chasing

39:55.280 --> 40:00.160
 the world record was, it was multifaceted. I think there was, as I kind of moved through,

40:00.160 --> 40:04.400
 because I mean, it took me almost six years from the day I decided I want to chase that time

40:05.120 --> 40:12.320
 to the day I actually did it. And through that five to six years, I think I merged from just like

40:12.320 --> 40:18.400
 my number one goal was to try to break the world record to my number one goal is how fast can I

40:18.400 --> 40:24.000
 run this thing? And then ultimately, what needs to be done for a human to break 11 hours in 100

40:24.000 --> 40:29.760
 miles? Because I think that's going to happen soon. I think it's going to happen in the next few years.

40:29.760 --> 40:35.920
 What pace would that be? Sub 11 would be, I think it's like 635 right about per mile.

40:35.920 --> 40:42.800
 You're moving quick, but not so quick that like your void of being able to think about

40:42.800 --> 40:47.840
 everything as it's happening. So what's the pace in terms of if you look for each of the

40:48.640 --> 40:56.160
 one mile segments for the 100 miles? Is it pretty steady? Like in order to break 11 hours,

40:56.160 --> 41:02.320
 would it be pretty steady 635? Does it go up and down? Do you speed up at the very end?

41:02.320 --> 41:07.520
 Like what's the pacing? If you were to, maybe how much variability is there in the pacing

41:07.520 --> 41:11.360
 for an optimal performance here? Yeah. So if you're talking about someone, let's say that

41:11.360 --> 41:14.320
 there's someone, well, let's just take me for example, let's say that we could just like,

41:14.960 --> 41:20.320
 we had this infinite knowledge and we knew for a fact, a perfect performance for me would produce

41:20.320 --> 41:25.680
 a 1059, but I'm not going a second faster. And I need to do everything right in order to run a 1059.

41:25.680 --> 41:33.600
 I would definitely want to either have a slight negative or a slight positive split.

41:33.600 --> 41:39.440
 So when, and I think there's, I think there's a, there's a range in there where like,

41:39.440 --> 41:43.440
 being a little bit faster, the first half and the second half isn't going to necessarily

41:44.160 --> 41:49.520
 change your outcome or being a little bit slower, the first half and a little bit faster,

41:49.520 --> 41:53.600
 the second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome. So that's what you're referring

41:53.600 --> 41:57.600
 to the split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and the second 50 miles. And you can break

41:57.600 --> 42:02.240
 it down as, as tiny as you want. Like I think when you take out the outlier laps where I stopped to

42:02.240 --> 42:06.080
 use the bathroom, which would have been that like three to four minute non moving time that I talked

42:06.080 --> 42:12.560
 about before, my splits were really tight. I had a couple that were, it was weird because that,

42:12.560 --> 42:18.400
 that track that I did that on was actually like 400 and some weird number like 400 and like 38

42:18.400 --> 42:22.720
 meters or something like that. So I actually like ran like my numbers based on that. So they're,

42:22.720 --> 42:26.720
 they're normally I'm dealing with 400 meters. And then it's a little more like clean as to

42:26.720 --> 42:30.720
 like what my lap splits are going to range from one event to the next. So we're talking about

42:30.720 --> 42:37.440
 running 100 miles on a track. Yeah. And so then you can be really scientific about getting the,

42:37.440 --> 42:44.320
 the, the, the, the pacing right. And you're, you're running on the inside lane or is there

42:44.320 --> 42:50.640
 some kind of tricks to this? Like, are you alternating directions? Yeah, they'll switch

42:50.640 --> 42:55.760
 directions at most events every four hours. So you'll do four hours one way and then they usually

42:55.760 --> 43:01.840
 put a cone out. And once it hits like, like, let's say it hits four hours, you finish the lap

43:01.840 --> 43:05.440
 you're on and then you do a loop around and then you start the next, your next lap. Would you say

43:05.440 --> 43:10.800
 you take the exact same number of steps? Like when you're really in the groove, when you're taking

43:10.800 --> 43:15.520
 the pacing, are we talking about that level of precision or is it a little bit more feel?

43:15.520 --> 43:21.840
 You mean like footstrike frequency? Yeah. Like frequency then over the distance to the lap,

43:21.840 --> 43:25.920
 would you say it's so precise that you're like, you get in this groove where it's like perfect?

43:25.920 --> 43:29.360
 Yeah. Gosh, you're making me wish I would have strapped more like a foot pod to my,

43:31.040 --> 43:34.640
 but like, yeah. So I think like my guess is it's pretty precise. Like it's,

43:34.640 --> 43:38.320
 Is there a video of this? Sorry, I keep interrupting. Is there a video of this? Cause I,

43:38.320 --> 43:45.280
 I've actually, this is now three years ago, build a computer vision algorithm that counts footstrikes.

43:45.280 --> 43:51.280
 Oh really? Yeah, for fun. Yeah. I was trying to understand, we'll talk about that. We have the

43:51.280 --> 43:56.720
 same definition of fun when I've got my, find myself on a track for all day and you find yourself

43:56.720 --> 44:02.720
 counting footstrikes. I was trying to understand if, if there's how much variability there's in

44:02.720 --> 44:09.840
 extreme like elite performers within a particular race, but also across races. It was just interesting

44:09.840 --> 44:16.160
 to me from a robotics perspective, if like how much variability there is in the human body

44:17.040 --> 44:23.120
 in the way they use legs to move quickly. I think my guess would be that at the individual level,

44:23.120 --> 44:27.360
 it's going to be pretty precise, assuming the pacing is consistent. So you get, so

44:28.240 --> 44:33.600
 my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster, the second 50 miles and I did the first 50 miles.

44:33.600 --> 44:37.840
 So my splits were very even most of the day. I actually ran so my fastest miles at the end.

44:37.840 --> 44:43.280
 So there's going to be probably a slight variance from my fastest miles to my slowest

44:43.280 --> 44:48.800
 mile in like your cadence or your foot strike, but probably not by a huge margin, but you might

44:48.800 --> 44:53.680
 have a pretty big variance from one person to the next. So you get someone whose gait is just a

44:53.680 --> 44:58.800
 little bit different. So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down on the outside of

44:58.800 --> 45:03.840
 my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid four foot striker. So that's going to kind of impact my cadence

45:03.840 --> 45:10.080
 to a degree, whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to rear their foot or heel

45:10.080 --> 45:14.400
 striker and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in. So that person may have a little

45:14.400 --> 45:19.360
 bit of a different cadence as well. So you get someone, and I think you see this in elite

45:19.360 --> 45:24.720
 marathoning too, which is going to probably just be a much larger data pool, much, much more

45:24.720 --> 45:29.920
 probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this. And I think even

45:29.920 --> 45:36.000
 their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but to the degree of like

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from one person to the next.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.520
 But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is going to be,

45:43.520 --> 45:46.960
 the slower they go, the lower their cadence is going to be. But there's going to be probably a

45:46.960 --> 45:54.000
 range of optimal lowness and I don't know, probably optimal highness too than that.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.920
 If you can just linger on the 11 hours, the person, first of all, would you like to be the person that

45:59.920 --> 46:06.240
 breaks 11 hours? And second of all, the person that does break 11 hours, like what would it take?

46:07.120 --> 46:10.720
 And third question, is it even possible in your engine?

46:10.720 --> 46:14.880
 Yeah, I mean, I would definitely, I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want to be the first

46:14.880 --> 46:20.880
 person to break 11 hours and 100 miles. I think that'll be, would be a cool like barrier to be

46:20.880 --> 46:26.400
 the one to usher that in. But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing it done

46:27.200 --> 46:33.600
 from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that

46:33.600 --> 46:37.600
 is inevitable that it's going to get broken. So I mean, we were talking about happiness before

46:37.600 --> 46:43.280
 this, right? So I've contemplated this in the past, where I was thinking to myself like,

46:44.480 --> 46:49.040
 if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record,

46:49.040 --> 46:56.000
 and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do

46:56.720 --> 47:01.840
 an assessment of what I'm kind of where my mind is at and where my focus is at.

47:03.520 --> 47:09.920
 And just reflect on how I'm behaving in life, because it's going to get broken, right? I mean,

47:09.920 --> 47:17.680
 I could run 1050 tomorrow. And in 10 years, chances are that's no longer going to be my

47:17.680 --> 47:23.280
 world record anymore. Someone's going to run faster than that. So if you're living to hold

47:23.280 --> 47:28.960
 on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward, which anytime you break a world

47:28.960 --> 47:33.840
 record, you're moving the sport forward, then you have to look at that as like that was my

47:33.840 --> 47:40.240
 contribution. And whether I contribute again or not is kind of besides the point. What you want

47:40.240 --> 47:45.280
 is that your performance, your contribution brings new people into the sport who are excited,

47:45.280 --> 47:50.000
 motivated, and they can make their contribution. And then we can ultimately see, well, how fast

47:50.000 --> 47:54.560
 can someone run a controlled environment 100 miler? And that's what I really want to see,

47:55.200 --> 47:58.480
 because I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport. I mean, I've gotten so much

47:58.480 --> 48:03.520
 enjoyment from the sport, I mean, I'll turn it into a career. And I think there's other people

48:03.520 --> 48:07.680
 who can do the same thing, and it's not necessarily going to come at the expense of my career,

48:08.640 --> 48:11.680
 but it's going to bring more attention to the sport. It's going to bring more interest in the

48:11.680 --> 48:14.800
 sport. It's going to open the sport up to people who maybe otherwise would have never thought about

48:14.800 --> 48:22.320
 it, seen it, considered it. And to me, I think that's like a much more rewarding goal than saying,

48:22.320 --> 48:26.960
 I want to break this record and I want to hold it for decades or I want to die with this record.

48:26.960 --> 48:31.280
 So I never have to see someone go faster than me. Well, that's the progress of human civilization

48:31.280 --> 48:35.760
 was down on the shoulders of giants and we keep creating cool stuff. Well, and it's the other

48:35.760 --> 48:39.600
 thing is just like, if you're honest with yourself too, it's, I mean, we're seeing this right now

48:39.600 --> 48:43.760
 in the running world where, you know, new innovations come in, new technologies come in,

48:43.760 --> 48:48.960
 new nutritional approaches come in. And then we see like the new crop of folks have advantages

48:48.960 --> 48:53.120
 that the old crop didn't have. And it can be easy to look back on that and say, like, hey, well,

48:54.240 --> 48:57.600
 you know, if I would have had that product or if I would have done that, I would have run this.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.680
 But then you're getting into that negative, you know, thought process again, which I

49:01.680 --> 49:06.400
 generally try to stay out of. I think that came in, if I had fire, I would have done

49:06.400 --> 49:10.480
 way better with this. Look at these idiots up there with their cars. If I would have had a car

49:10.480 --> 49:18.640
 back then, I would have been ruled the world. Let me just zoom up briefly and ask you about kind of

49:19.680 --> 49:24.960
 beauty and love. What's the most beautiful thing about running to you? Why do you love it?

49:24.960 --> 49:30.080
 I think there's kind of a couple of directions to look at it through or lenses look at it through.

49:30.080 --> 49:33.360
 There's like the in the moment, right? There's always going to be that run where

49:34.320 --> 49:39.440
 you're clicking along and things just feel great. You get some endorphins and you get the, you know,

49:39.440 --> 49:43.760
 the, the quote unquote, runner's high and that sort of stuff. And that's like just like this

49:43.760 --> 49:49.280
 great feeling that you can kind of tap into on the like the real like, like in the moment type of

49:49.280 --> 49:54.320
 level. You know, you've my wife and I talk about this because she's a competitive ultra runner as

49:54.320 --> 50:01.040
 well. And you will have a day where, you know, we'll take a forced day off or something like that.

50:01.040 --> 50:06.880
 And it's necessary, right? It's going to allow the enjoyment to continue. But you get into this

50:06.880 --> 50:10.720
 like routine of I wake up in the morning, I do this run and that kind of gets my day started.

50:10.720 --> 50:15.680
 That gets my, my energy's up. I get that runner's high afterwards. You remove that from the equation

50:15.680 --> 50:20.240
 for a rest day. And you just sort of like, Oh, man, I don't feel like I never got started today.

50:20.240 --> 50:24.480
 Like, you know, it's just this weird thing. It's almost, I think it's, it's funny because

50:24.480 --> 50:28.800
 non runners don't always like necessarily recognize it because for them, it's the complete opposite.

50:28.800 --> 50:32.480
 They're like, if I can get away from not having to run today, that's going to be a good day versus

50:32.480 --> 50:37.520
 Yeah. But it's one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it. So

50:38.640 --> 50:43.920
 that's purely from the running perspective. There's this joy of the runners high of the post

50:43.920 --> 50:48.080
 after the run, you feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing. Yes. And I think that's

50:48.080 --> 50:54.000
 one of the drivers from just a quality of life standpoint, just a, you know, and in the moment,

50:54.000 --> 50:58.080
 immediate gratification standpoint, but then there's like, I think the bigger picture stuff

50:58.080 --> 51:04.880
 or the longer term stuff. And for me, that enjoyment is like, just the process, like of,

51:05.600 --> 51:11.600
 okay, I'm starting at this fitness level. And I'm going to do these workouts. And by doing these

51:11.600 --> 51:15.600
 workouts, I'm going to see incremental progress from them. And then that's another kind of like,

51:15.600 --> 51:18.960
 kind of short term gratification that's maybe a little longer than the day to day, but

51:20.160 --> 51:24.880
 still like shorter than like a career or a, or a buildup for a particular race,

51:24.880 --> 51:28.320
 where you're saying, you're seeing yourself like, okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals

51:28.320 --> 51:33.920
 right now. And on week one, I covered this much distance in three minutes, but by week four,

51:33.920 --> 51:39.440
 I'm covering this much distance. And you can just see that progress is almost like in elementary

51:39.440 --> 51:42.880
 school, when you get the gold star for reading a book, it's like, did that gold start really mean

51:42.880 --> 51:48.080
 anything? I don't know, but I felt great when they gave it to me. Yeah. Something about just

51:48.080 --> 51:53.680
 finding improvement. And people love to see improvement, I think. So that's where I think

51:53.680 --> 51:58.640
 you can also get some value. And it was saying like, I started here and I got there. And then

51:58.640 --> 52:04.000
 I think there's also just like, I would call this maybe more the cherry on top, which is like,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.680
 where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's going to be kind of the

52:07.680 --> 52:13.680
 thing that kind of like, shows up on the end result and where it kind of identifies whether

52:13.680 --> 52:18.160
 you did things right or wrong. Yeah. So there's a sense which in which training is a kind of

52:18.160 --> 52:25.840
 a preparation towards race day and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist,

52:25.840 --> 52:31.520
 you get to create this, this piece of art and they might suck and might be beautiful. I mean,

52:31.520 --> 52:36.800
 I see in the grappling world, I see competition in that same way, when I feel the best about it,

52:37.440 --> 52:43.600
 which is like, sounds pretentious to say, but like, I'm trying to be the best version of myself in

52:43.600 --> 52:52.480
 this particular day of competition and to do something that I'll be proud of in an artist way,

52:52.480 --> 53:00.000
 not in a kind of, some kind of numerical way, but like as a holistic sense, like do something cool,

53:00.000 --> 53:06.720
 like in grappling, that means for me, that means like not stalling, like taking big risks and

53:06.720 --> 53:14.160
 trying to dominate another person in the context of grappling and do it, like push myself to

53:14.160 --> 53:19.920
 limit both cardio wise and technique wise and just play beautifully. I mean, you see this in

53:19.920 --> 53:25.200
 kind of chess, there's systematic chess players and there's people that allow themselves to have

53:25.200 --> 53:30.240
 those moments of genius, where they take the big risk that eventually pays off or doesn't.

53:30.240 --> 53:35.280
 And that to me is art. I mean, there's art within running, there's art within chess,

53:35.280 --> 53:40.960
 there's art within grappling and you got a chance, like all the training is more like science and

53:40.960 --> 53:47.200
 then it feels like the competition day's art. Yeah, I think that that's a really cool way to look at

53:47.200 --> 53:52.960
 and I think it's when you really open up the perspective of that too, it's like even obviously,

53:52.960 --> 53:56.320
 you know, having a great day, like winning the tournament or, you know, getting further than

53:56.320 --> 53:59.600
 you were expected to or beating someone who you've never beaten before or something like that,

54:00.240 --> 54:05.120
 or in the running perspective, like achieving that goal time, that sort of stuff. Obviously,

54:05.120 --> 54:09.040
 those are kind of like the ones you, when you're honest with yourself, you really want and you're

54:09.040 --> 54:13.680
 going to probably get the most satisfaction out of. But even when they don't go wrong, like maybe

54:13.680 --> 54:19.200
 like with your grappling tournament analogy, the, you know, maybe the guy you're grappling against

54:19.200 --> 54:23.360
 does a move on you and you're like, I was not prepared for that move. So now the enjoyment

54:23.360 --> 54:28.720
 becomes, okay, back to the drawing board. Now I need to find out what do I do when that happens

54:28.720 --> 54:33.280
 to me next time. And that's where the, I think the why comes in again. Same thing with running,

54:33.280 --> 54:39.840
 like maybe I make a mistake and, you know, like eat something I didn't really want to eat or thought

54:39.840 --> 54:43.600
 was going to work, but didn't work. And it costs me more time than I gained by having it or something

54:43.600 --> 54:47.520
 like that. And then I go back to the drawing board and say, okay, well, I can't do that,

54:47.520 --> 54:51.520
 that didn't work. Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to be able to do it.

54:51.520 --> 54:58.320
 And I love that part of the sport. Just the rearranging of things and adjusting and tinkering.

54:58.320 --> 55:03.440
 There's some sense in which the mistakes and like the flaws give us meaning. Because like, if, if

55:03.440 --> 55:11.600
 everything, if you weren't able to find mistakes and something you've done, it feels like the life

55:11.600 --> 55:19.520
 would be void of meaning. It's a lost opportunity too. Like if, I mean, like when I look at even

55:19.520 --> 55:25.840
 my 100 mile race of 1119, I can find spots in there where I was like, oh, you know what, I could

55:25.840 --> 55:30.720
 clean that up a little bit. Maybe if I do this differently. And I mean, that's going to get me,

55:30.720 --> 55:36.240
 you know, a little bit faster. If I sat back and said, hey, well, things went great that day.

55:36.240 --> 55:39.200
 Cool. Let's see if we can replicate it. Then, you know, I probably run 1119 again.

55:40.960 --> 55:46.560
 So can we talk about training a little bit? Yeah. What does your training look like year

55:46.560 --> 55:54.960
 round, day to day, hour to hour, like optimal, maybe, maybe you want to pick a race in the context

55:54.960 --> 55:58.640
 to which you want to discuss that. But, and also people should follow you on Instagram. You have

55:58.640 --> 56:06.640
 a lot of kind of interesting like little glances into your training process, into your training

56:06.640 --> 56:11.200
 thinking, which is quite fascinating. But if you look at an optimal training process, what does

56:11.200 --> 56:17.280
 that look like? Yeah. So I think the, if we were looking at it from like a philosophical level

56:17.280 --> 56:21.360
 or like an approach level, I think there's some things that carry over from regardless of the

56:21.360 --> 56:29.360
 distance. So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least specific to what you're

56:29.360 --> 56:34.240
 going to do on race day, but are still going to be important things in terms of improving your

56:34.240 --> 56:40.800
 ability to perform on race day or maximizing your potential with the things that are specific,

56:40.800 --> 56:47.440
 you do first. I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance sport. I think maybe even more

56:47.440 --> 56:52.080
 specifically with things like our ultra marathons or 100 milers where you want a really strong

56:52.080 --> 56:59.280
 aerobic foundation or like a base before you really start, I think, structuring things towards a

56:59.280 --> 57:06.480
 specific one. So for me, I think like a target for me is oftentimes like, you know, getting really

57:06.480 --> 57:11.760
 fit at like what my pace would be at like my aerobic threshold or what a lot of people maybe

57:11.760 --> 57:16.080
 call like a maximum aerobic function. I mean, the running world is kind of weird where we have

57:16.080 --> 57:19.520
 like these terminologies where there's sometimes multiple words that essentially mean the same

57:19.520 --> 57:24.320
 thing, but one is from like a just an actual physiological reaction and one is just like

57:24.320 --> 57:31.840
 a feeling and stuff like that. So you mentioned time versus time in optimal physiological state.

57:31.840 --> 57:37.920
 Like how important is it just to get like running done versus like running in a particular pace?

57:38.880 --> 57:42.160
 That would depend on the event, I would say to a degree. And there's

57:42.160 --> 57:47.440
 contradicting ideas about like kind of how to structure it. I think a lot of times like

57:48.640 --> 57:53.040
 you do want to like time on feet in most cases is just going to be like I'm running easy,

57:53.040 --> 57:57.200
 whatever feels easy that day. And that can be different from one day to the next. Like I might

57:57.200 --> 58:01.600
 feel great. And you know, that produces a much faster pace than if I, you know, feel really

58:01.600 --> 58:07.360
 miserable or something like that. So that's why I think a lot of times running, well, they'll do

58:07.360 --> 58:13.920
 the whole perceived perceived effort or perceived exertion. And there you're looking at kind of

58:13.920 --> 58:19.920
 understanding the response your body has to a certain effort level, and you're supposed to

58:19.920 --> 58:25.600
 target a certain effort level in order to like get a certain response. So to maybe simplify

58:25.600 --> 58:30.160
 that a little bit or make it a little clearer, like, I think I focus on essentially like short

58:30.160 --> 58:38.880
 intervals. I focus on longer intervals or tempo runs. I focus on like race, pace, intensity,

58:38.880 --> 58:43.920
 which is a lot of times what I'll build my long run around. But I'll also like those are kind of

58:43.920 --> 58:47.600
 like the small pieces to the puzzle. Those are the options you're working with.

58:47.600 --> 58:51.520
 Yeah, but I'm going to always try to work with those options on top of a massive

58:51.520 --> 58:54.320
 aerobic base, which is going to probably be like 80% of the work.

58:54.320 --> 58:57.840
 So how do you build that massive aerobic base? What are we talking about? Just distance?

58:57.840 --> 59:02.080
 Distance and essentially, so I like to call it micro stressing, because you're going to

59:02.080 --> 59:04.960
 always start at a different spot, depending on where your fitness level is at and depending

59:04.960 --> 59:09.040
 on where you're at as an individual, I'm going to be targeting my aerobic threshold. I'm going to

59:09.040 --> 59:14.960
 get right up to it, but not necessarily cross over it. It's, you know, it's, it's been popularized as

59:14.960 --> 59:20.400
 maximum aerobic function as kind of a training philosophy. That philosophy in itself, I think

59:20.400 --> 59:25.520
 maybe is a little more like holistic where they're saying, do this basically all the time.

59:25.520 --> 59:31.200
 And by doing so, you're going to like, you're going to raise your aerobic potential by so much

59:31.200 --> 59:35.680
 that, you know, you can kind of like race yourself in a shape at that point. And this would be maybe

59:35.680 --> 59:39.680
 more specific for like shorter distance or endurance runs where you're not going to race

59:39.680 --> 59:43.680
 yourself in the shape of 100 milers. But for five days, you might, you might do like a huge

59:43.680 --> 59:49.440
 base building phase where you're going up to that maximum aerobic function or that aerobic

59:49.440 --> 59:56.320
 threshold and you're watching your pace come down at that. So the rule there is basically like,

59:56.320 --> 1:00:00.320
 if you're seeing improvement, that's the sign you're looking for, or which would just be your

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:05.920
 pace dropping at that heart rate or at that intensity. And if you're seeing that continually

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:08.960
 go down, you're heading in the right direction. If you start seeing it go the opposite way,

1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:13.360
 you're, you're probably overreaching where you're trying to do too much of it. So that's kind of

1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:17.840
 dictates how much the dose, I guess you'd say. When we talk about maximum aerobic function,

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:22.720
 we're talking about heart rate as the ultimate, as the really important metric here. So maintaining

1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:28.160
 a particular heart rate during the run. Is that the measure that like, how do you know you're in

1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:30.720
 the right place? Yeah, yeah. And then that's where it gets a little tricky because like,

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:34.800
 unless you go into a lab and get your aerobic threshold tested, it's really hard to have like

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:40.080
 an exact number on it. You know, Dr. Phil Maffetone with the maximum function process,

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:44.560
 he'll say 180 minus your age is going to give you your. Yeah, that's the math 180 formula that I

1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:50.400
 thought was fascinating for it's like, uh, in the same way equals E equals MC squared is fascinating

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:55.120
 that there could be a formula that captures like optimal running. Yeah. So that for people who don't

1:00:55.120 --> 1:01:00.560
 know, that's 180 minus your age. If you train at that heart rate, if you run at that heart rate,

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:03.840
 you're going to progress a lot. And here's the advantage of that. I think like with any of

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:09.120
 these things, you want to look at it through where are the advantages here and I need to account for

1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:13.920
 those and then where are the potential disadvantages and then decide for me as an individual,

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:18.080
 do these advantages outweigh the disadvantages and what's the alternative approach and is that

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:23.200
 going to produce more advantages or less. So with, with maximum function, uh, here's some

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:30.880
 advantages. Like it is low enough intensity where you can train pretty consistently at a fairly high

1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:37.600
 volume with a very low injury risk with a very low like things that are going to maybe lower your

1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:42.720
 quality life, like muscle damage and things like that. Um, it's a more efficient way in the sense

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:47.520
 that you're going to be like prioritizing like fat metabolization, which, um, I mean, if you're

1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:52.800
 looking at like Jeff Follick and Dr. Jeff Follick and Dr. Dominic DiAgostino, some of their research

1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:56.880
 and things like that, like they're going to show that, you know, that's going to be a little cleaner

1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:01.680
 way to go about things from just a recovery standpoint, a breakdown standpoint. So they could

1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:08.160
 be like a, what they call like a fat adapted athlete. So you can go to your fat stores for energy

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:14.560
 if you're applying this map. What is it called by the math 180? Is that a good, what are your

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:20.240
 thoughts about in general for yourself and for the broader population? I think the math 180

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:26.560
 formula is about as good of a formula as you're going to find in terms of capturing as many people

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:31.120
 as you can get away with capturing with a kind of a universal thing, uh, like any of these things.

1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:37.200
 I mean, it's, it's more likely kind of on a bell curve where like the bulk of that 180 minus

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.400
 their age is probably going to be a pretty good, at least starting point to kind of figure out

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:45.360
 where that is. There's some other things you can like maybe use to kind of check it that I like to

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:50.240
 do. If I'm, let's say I just, I did 180 minus my age and I went out and I started running and it was

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:56.640
 like, I'm running along and I'm just like, my, my breathing is labored. I'm, you know, I'm struggling

1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:01.360
 to get a sentence out without gasping for breath. Well, that's my body telling me I'm probably not

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:06.960
 actually at my true like math number or my true like underneath my true aerobic threshold. Like

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.080
 aerobic threshold and maximum of function. You should be able to do that for hours and you

1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:15.360
 should be able to breathe pretty efficiently and talk. Yep. Carry a conversation. Other people

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:18.960
 will say like you, another way to kind of gauge it, if you can breathe in your nose and out your

1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.600
 mouth, that's not necessarily the best way to do on a, from a performance standpoint, but it can be

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:28.480
 a good kind of governor that will allow you to like, if you can, if you can no longer breathe

1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:31.760
 in your nose and out your mouth, you're probably going too fast to actually technically be at your

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:37.680
 math pace or under your math pace. Yeah. I had a, actually when I was in better shape, I had trouble

1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:44.480
 getting to that math number. I found myself like either I would be doing way too much work.

1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.280
 Like it was too hard to do it. It was too hard to get to that number. I was running a much lower

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:55.920
 heart rate, like 10 to 20, what do you call that beats lower? And that's, I was still for myself

1:03:55.920 --> 1:04:01.920
 happy with the pace. It was a good pace. And I was felt good. I was smiling and enjoying life. And

1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:09.920
 the moment I take myself to that level of like the math 180 level, that's like, that felt like a

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:16.080
 real work. And it felt like I can't do that for five, 10, 15 miles. Like I, I started feeling

1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:23.040
 it like this is a one or two mile thing. But I think his answer to that, I feel Mephidone's

1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:30.560
 answer is maybe you're supposed to like, what, maybe do some more sprints or something like that

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:37.920
 or build up your, maybe like I'm too weak. Yeah. You're wise to like, yeah, like that's a sign

1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:41.440
 that you need to work on some stuff. You can't just keep enjoying life. There's, there's two ways

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.880
 to look at that. I think, and I think you're, you're, you're right on. I think they would,

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:51.280
 what the advice from that, from that kind of a process would say is either you, you're doing

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:56.000
 too much of it. So it's getting too hard for where your skeletal muscle system is currently at

1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:00.320
 for that particular activity. So like, I mean, it can be different too. Like if you're cycling

1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:04.000
 versus running, you know, that's a little bit of different mechanic where it can be different,

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:09.680
 where you could take a super fit cyclist and then put them on, you know, the, the bono volume,

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:12.960
 they're going to be able to tolerate relative to what you're going to do when you remove like

1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:16.720
 impact forces and things like that is going to be lower if they haven't been practicing that

1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:21.760
 activity. So for you, like, you know, you're prioritizing like, you know, wrestling and

1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:25.680
 mixed martial art, not mixed martial arts, but jiu jitsu type stuff. So, you know,

1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:32.560
 running is maybe kind of that, that, that secondary activity versus the primary activity.

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:37.200
 But yeah, so what they would say is probably like maybe instead of doing that at, let's say you

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.200
 were doing that for like 30 miles a week or something like that, and it was getting too hard

1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:46.960
 to continue, they'd say, you know, come back to 20, get used to 20, get comfortable with 20,

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:50.480
 then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and kind of just like inch you along.

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:57.600
 One of the intuitions I had about the ways I was failing at running is the form was probably not

1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:05.520
 great. Like the way to get to those 30, 40 miles is to get the form right. Maybe I was doing too

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:11.360
 big of steps, not so like playing with a different gate, playing with a different kind of the form

1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:16.560
 of your form, the economy, the efficiency. Yeah. So that was the intuition, like I was doing

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:20.800
 something wrong. But I suppose that's the benefit of these kind of formulas. It challenges you to

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:26.480
 think like, how can I improve this kind of stuff? Well, and it also, it simplifies it so much that

1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:31.360
 you're forced to, right? You're forced to optimize within that real strict parameter versus,

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:37.200
 is am I doing my short intervals right, but my long runs wrong? Or am I doing my like long

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:40.800
 intervals right, but my short intervals? And then you just kind of complicates things when

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:44.240
 you start throwing a lot of stuff there. And for most people, especially when they're first

1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:49.200
 getting started, you know, you're, you can't overcomplicate it, or you're just going to like,

1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:53.520
 you're going to do like a bunch of half right, half wrong things, and then not really know where

1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:59.440
 your progress or your deficits are necessarily at. So I do think this is an amazing approach,

1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:03.360
 especially for people who are just getting into it and building that, that foundation,

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:08.480
 where, where I think maybe you want to deviate from that a little bit, especially when you

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:14.320
 start to get into these events that are operating well outside that intensity. So you take something

1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:19.840
 like, you know, let's say it's a race that takes you in the neighborhood of around like 12 minutes

1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:23.920
 or something like that, then you're going to be running significantly faster than your, your

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:29.680
 maximum or function pace. So most of the research is going to say at some point in time, you need

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:34.080
 to get around to practicing the pace at which you're going to perform at and really fine tuning

1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:40.880
 the mechanics, the efficiencies, how it feels, how to judge it, how to pace it at the pace

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:44.560
 you're going to try to compete at. So there's obviously like a large range of targets there

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:47.840
 when we're talking about the endurance world in general, where, you know, you have these shorter

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:51.760
 events like five kilometers, and then you also have 100 mile races, which are going to typically

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.840
 be quite a bit below your maximum aerobic function, especially on these trail races.

1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:00.480
 I need to admit something. So I don't measure the runs at all in terms of time.

1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:07.360
 I get competitive with myself. So I kind of decided that running for me is going to be this

1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:13.040
 thing where I just go by feel. Is it possible to be that kind of runner and, you know, still have

1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:17.680
 running as part of your life and be a good performer in running? I actually think that's,

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:22.800
 that's where you want to get to. The problem is most people have a hard time getting to that,

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:27.520
 because they'll go out and they'll run with a friend and match their pace, or they'll go out

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:32.000
 and they'll say, well, I want to run this pace, so they'll target that pace or target a specific

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:38.480
 heart rate, which is, you know, not necessarily how they maybe feel good doing it. So I think like

1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:43.280
 once you, I mean, obviously, I think when you put a race on the calendar, if your goal is

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.280
 performance, it's a little harder to just say like, well, I'm going to run where it feels good today,

1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:51.200
 because eventually you have to get around to doing what's specific. But from just a fitness

1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:56.080
 standpoint, health standpoint, enjoyment standpoint, I think it's totally fine to go out and say,

1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:59.360
 I'm going to run what feels good today. And, you know, maybe someday you will feel like at the end

1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:02.480
 of the run, I'm going to do a couple sprints just to get some, you know, that because it does,

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:06.880
 that one's a hard one to kind of jumpstart. But once you do it, and you realize how kind of good

1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:10.640
 it feels, maybe to throw in a few accelerations at the end of a run. And then you, you say, oh,

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:14.000
 wow, that feels pretty good to do that. I feel a little more accomplished. That's right. That's

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.400
 a forcing function. But I like to finish runs with sprints anyway, because you're already there

1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:24.800
 without right, you don't need to the timing. I'm afraid of the time becoming a drug. But the flip

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:29.840
 side of that is useful tool to get you to learn the right form, the right feel, like what it feels

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:34.560
 like to have to be in good shape. And then you could throw out the time. Well, I think too,

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:38.320
 with with feel running, and what I mean by that is X kind of back to that perceived effort thing

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.040
 where like, you do enough of it, and you start being able to recognize, like, I can go out. And

1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:50.240
 if you said, okay, run, you know, 60 minutes at your aerobic threshold, I could go, I could know

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:53.760
 where that is on my heart rate. And I could go up there and just say, like, okay, I know what

1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:58.800
 that feels like, and go and run that feel. And I'm going to hit that spot. Like, I bet you if we

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:01.840
 looked at my heart rate data after they'd be right in there. And I wouldn't have to look at some of

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:06.800
 that's just experience. Yeah, some of it's just understanding, like, when like, not noticing

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.480
 the physiological responses when you cross over versus step a little bit too below it.

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:14.240
 But you can get yourself daydreaming and forget I'll do this sometimes too, where I'll be tired,

1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:18.800
 because I'm kind of like you too, where when I'm getting really fit, especially with my foundation,

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:24.240
 like, I got a, you know, I'm moving pretty quick at my aerobic threshold. So like, if I start daydreaming

1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:26.960
 too much, I can notice, oh, I'm drifting back a little bit, I look down at my heart rate amount,

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:31.200
 oh, yeah, I'm 10 beats under. You know, so you do it, it does take a little bit of, I think, just

1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:37.840
 awareness. But it's also not necessarily something where you have to be so exact that you're hitting

1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:43.440
 an exact heart rate all the time. There's usually a range. And there's even like, some fluctuations

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:48.000
 where like, if you've been healthy for a year or two, without any injuries, and you've been fit,

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:52.000
 that you can probably add five beats to your maximum aerobic function. If you're using that as kind of

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.280
 your target from the 180 minus your age formula. So let's try this, lay this out for yourself. But

1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:03.920
 for others, you, you offer ready made plans for people, you know, depending on the, I think the

1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:10.800
 I think the key thing there is the distance, maybe you can elaborate. But what does that plan

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:17.760
 look like usually? What are the key options as you already kind of mentioned? And how does your

1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:23.680
 week look like? How do a lot of people's week look like in terms of splits? Are we talking about,

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:30.880
 you know, in terms of rest days, in terms of how often do you speed work versus longer distance,

1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:37.760
 you mentioned long runs? Like, is there something you could say that's generally applicable about the

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:43.840
 structure of these plans? The ready made plans, I definitely follow like a philosophy. And it's

1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:48.800
 going to be the kind of like lockstep in that. So for those, like there's always going to be a

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:52.480
 sacrifice when you do like a ready made plan, because there's you're removing the individual

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:56.480
 context there. So for folks who are like really want to get into the weeds, I usually do like a

1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:59.520
 personalized coaching plan with them, where we sit down, we actually look at their strengths,

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:06.720
 their weaknesses, and really kind of go in from that perspective and fine tune it. And it also like,

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:12.480
 it avoids a situation where, oh, my ready made plan says, I'm supposed to do this run today,

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:15.920
 but I don't feel great today. So what do I do? And some people are fine with that because they're

1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:21.840
 aware enough of like the process that they can adjust it themselves. Other folks just need a

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:26.160
 little more support. So that's kind of the difference there. But in terms of the structure

1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:31.440
 of it, it kind of goes with an approach where we're saying you build this foundation, you're

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:36.000
 going to spend, you know, usually anywhere between eight to 12 weeks just building up

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:39.760
 your your aerobic foundation, you're going to be doing a lot of stuff that are kind of at,

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.160
 I call them base runs, but they're basically your maximum aerobic function or you're up to your aerobic

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:48.320
 threshold type stuff. And they're really going to get really fit with that. And once they kind of

1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.400
 have that foundation laid, then it's time to get into the specifics of whatever distance they're

1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:57.760
 doing. So if it where it'll differ will be like if they're doing right now on those plans, I think

1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:04.240
 I've got 5k half marathon marathon 50k 80 to 100k and then 100 miles. So if they pick a 5k plan,

1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:07.840
 the order of operations is going to be different than if they pick the 100 mile plan, you're going

1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:13.120
 to see some of the same workouts show up in that plan and just going to be different areas of it.

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:19.840
 So once they're really fit at that, you know, that foundational level, then, you know, if they're

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:24.400
 doing say 100 mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals, which I would on my plans,

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:28.320
 I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes. It's kind of that short interval range.

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:33.360
 Can you describe what you mean by short interval is it's like a sprint and a rest?

1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:40.160
 Yeah. Yeah. So I'll use basically like I'll use like a basic a 12 minute time trial. And that's

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:43.840
 going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going to be for some

1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:49.120
 of those. When they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit. But usually when we're

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:54.000
 up to like above a minute and certainly up to four minutes that like whatever pace or intensity that

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.760
 they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial where they're just seeing how far they can go in

1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:03.360
 12 minutes is going to be kind of like about where they're going to target for those intervals. So

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.960
 then those intervals are going to be structured. Let's say they're doing two minute intervals,

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:11.360
 they're going to do two minutes at that intensity that they could do for 12 minutes at a time trial,

1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:15.360
 then they're going to do a two minute real easy job or maybe even walk just to kind of bounce back

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.520
 and they're going to repeat it. How do you figure out how far you can go in 12 minutes?

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:23.280
 Is that just trial and error? You build up to it, there's formulas, what?

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:27.680
 Yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less brutal.

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:34.560
 Where you kind of, I haven't really dove into these that in depth yet. I know like

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:40.640
 that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval and then a slightly

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:46.320
 longer one. And then like another one where like at the end one, that last one will kind of indicate

1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:50.560
 what it is. And so you're doing less of it to get the same answer to the question.

1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:56.800
 But sometimes I think when it's someone who's new, I'd rather them just do a 12 minute time trial

1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:02.160
 because it's easy for them to execute in the sense that it's pretty clear. You do a warm up,

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.560
 you do some strides, maybe some dynamic stretches and you just run as hard as you can for 12 minutes

1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:12.800
 as evenly paced as you can manage. And I mean, if it's going to produce the data I'm looking for.

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:17.600
 No matter what happens, they'll produce the data.

1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:22.400
 I mean, you can screw it up, I guess. You can go way too fast and then you have this scenario

1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:26.160
 where like, oh, it looks like your first two minutes were drastically faster than your last

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:31.200
 two. And then it's like, oh, we maybe screwed that one up. But I mean, really, you don't even

1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:36.960
 need to do the time trial technically. A lot of times you can go off of feel like what we

1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:48.320
 described with the threshold stuff. And it's a high enough intensity where your body's going

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:52.960
 to kind of limit you to a degree where if I said we didn't do the time trial and just started

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.320
 doing the intervals, we could figure out that if they're doing them right or not, if we see a

1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:02.080
 scenario where, oh, it looks like these first two intervals were significantly slower than the last

1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:06.400
 two, chances are we're still not quite dialed in in terms of what the intensity is that you

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:10.400
 should be targeting for those. And as you do a few, you just get to know the pacing of it a

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:14.240
 little better. And then you start seeing more even splits. So like, you know, their first two minute

1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:18.080
 intervals pretty close within a couple seconds of their second, or I guess we'd be looking at

1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:22.240
 distance if we're doing time. So like you went approximately the same distance on that last one

1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.560
 as you did the first one. And then we're just looking for improvement over time. So, you know,

1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:32.400
 we might spend four, six weeks kind of focusing on improving that we're going to still include

1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:36.400
 kind of foundational running volume where you're going to be running like an easy pace and enjoyable

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:40.160
 pace kind of in the interim. And then there's going to be some rest days. And that's going to

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:43.840
 be where the levels come in my like level one plans are going to be like four day a week training

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:48.320
 plans level two are going to be five day level three are going to be six day with one day off.

1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:52.960
 And you can obviously operate outside of those. Those those are just the ones that I put up for

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:56.160
 the ready made when I'm coaching people kind of personalized, we just we look at like what

1:16:56.160 --> 1:17:01.120
 their history is with running their schedule, all sorts of stuff. Because oftentimes people get

1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:03.920
 hung up on like, well, what are the elites doing? What are the professionals doing? What are the

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:08.000
 Olympians doing? It's like, well, it's like, what the Olympians are doing is they're waking up and

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.400
 they're living and breathing everything around this one race that they're going to do in four years.

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:16.480
 Or so it's like, we need to step away from that if you're working, you know, 10 hours a day,

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:21.520
 and you got kids and all this other stuff too. So there's a lot of variables that make it more

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:26.000
 interesting to coach someone who's actually like, not an elite athlete, or someone who's a

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:32.320
 professional athlete, I should say. But but yeah, so they're going to do that stuff, those shorter

1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:38.560
 intervals, for probably about like four to six weeks, if they're doing if they're doing a longer

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:42.720
 race, like 100 miles, if they were doing say a 5k, we'd start bringing those workouts in

1:17:42.720 --> 1:17:45.760
 near the end of their plan, because that's going to be specific to their race pace. That's going

1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:50.080
 to be the intensity that maybe they're doing for, you know, like a 3k or 5k or something like that.

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:54.480
 So it's going to be more relative to what they're going to use. So it follows that philosophy,

1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:59.360
 the plans follow that philosophy of weaknesses and least specific stuff early. And then we

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:05.520
 start phasing closer to most specific stuff and strengths as you get kind of near to the end

1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:10.080
 of the plan. And then the distance of the time that you're going to spend out doing whatever

1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:14.080
 event it is going to dictate how those kind of get ordered in there. I wonder if I could ask you

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:20.800
 for some sort of advice, maybe almost maybe look at me as a case study of a particular

1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:30.240
 runner and then see how we can plan stuff out. So which context to give? Okay, so I have been,

1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:34.480
 first let me say how much we're currently in Austin. I want to say how much I love Austin

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:41.760
 for many reasons. First and foremost, people are super kind and just like, there's so much love

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:46.640
 that I've experienced immediately when I came to the city versus many of the other cities I've been

1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:54.560
 in. It's not quite as welcoming and full of kindness immediately. I mean, I really love it here in

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:59.920
 Austin. And because I've been going through a bunch of stressful stuff, I just kind of gave myself

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:06.560
 a chance to say, okay, I'm going to stick to a diet of carnivore keto, but I'm going to eat as much

1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:15.040
 as I want. Because primarily because just barbecue was part of the love I was getting here. And I

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:19.280
 was like, either I resist or just give in and I decided to give in and actually use this as an

1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:25.280
 opportunity to relax and have fun for the past three, four months plus whiskey and so on. And then

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:29.680
 the training kind of all, I also let go of the training a little bit just to relax, to really

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:34.880
 focus on the work, focus on the love I've been getting, all those kinds of things. But now I

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:39.440
 just kind of want to set a goal for myself to get back into both competing and grappling,

1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:46.640
 but also doing a hanging out with David Goggins and doing a conversation with him. But almost,

1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.840
 this is my own personal kind of race that I'm looking forward to. And in terms of distance,

1:19:51.840 --> 1:20:01.040
 that means running with David, something like a marathon plus plus. It's like, it's unclear what

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:06.560
 plus. So my goal would be to continue eating carnivore, which is a whole other topic. I'd

1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:12.080
 love to talk to you about. I feel great psychologically, sort of in terms of mental performance in my

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:18.880
 work when I eat carnivore. And physically, I love it. I've never felt any kind of need for carbs

1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:25.360
 to improve performance in my running or anything else. Combine that with fasting, intermittent

1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:32.240
 fasting or eating once a day. I just, that's when I feel the best. What else? I also feel

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:37.680
 best. And this is something you can push back on. I feel best when I just run every day,

1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:47.600
 like no breaks ever, and usually the same way every day. So I know this is suboptimal. It'd

1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:53.680
 be interesting to hear your opinion of just how suboptimal that is. So I think that actually lays

1:20:53.680 --> 1:21:00.800
 out where my mind is. I'm happy eating carnivore once a day. I like running every day. The goal

1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:07.680
 is to run a marathon in two months ish, two months plus, and then about three months to do a bunch

1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:13.520
 of competitions and grappling. Okay. With those parameters, I think like you actually probably

1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:17.680
 would be a great candidate for maximum heroic function training strategy. Like you want that

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:22.880
 consistency where I'm going to do the same thing each day. You don't want to beat yourself up so

1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:26.640
 much any one day that you can't get out and do the next one. That's the sweet spot with maximum

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:34.320
 heroic function is the trademark there is that you can keep going and keep doing it again and

1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:38.880
 again and again because as long as you're not going out one day and trying to do twice as much

1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:42.320
 as what you're ready for for that one specific. So the key for you is going to be picking the

1:21:42.320 --> 1:21:48.400
 right starting point and then building from there on what that day kind of entails in terms of

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:54.800
 how much running you do. So where you could maybe get creative would be if you decided

1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:01.120
 that it's a hard fast rule that you run an hour every day, seven days a week. But we find out

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:06.400
 that to run your maximum heroic function means you probably are better off sticking to 30 minutes.

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:12.400
 Then what you would maybe do is you would run underneath your maximum heroic function

1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:16.800
 for the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes. Maybe throw some of those strides in there if

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:20.720
 you want to do that at the very end. And then that middle 30 minutes is going to be maximum

1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:26.880
 heroic function target. And then maybe after four weeks you start noticing, you know what,

1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:31.360
 this 30 minutes isn't wearing me out near as much as it used to. I feel like I could easily push

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:34.880
 past that. Well, let's up that to 40 minutes of that 60. You're always staying within that

1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:40.160
 60 minute parameter that keeps your schedule consistent, your routine consistent. I'm wearing

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:45.680
 a heart rate monitor to sort of as I run to monitor it. Sure. You could do that. You could go

1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:51.440
 perceived effort. I like to use them in tandem in the sense that early on I'll maybe look at

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:56.400
 my heart rate a little more often, especially for shorter length. Heart rate can get messy the

1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:02.800
 longer you go. So I end up kind of maybe stepping away from heart rate a little more than some will

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:07.520
 at a certain point because ultimately I'm going to be usually training or working with someone

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:12.160
 to run like a race that's really long and they get cardiac drift, dehydration, heat,

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:17.840
 things that are going to make the heart rate super messy. Yeah, but your probability to measure

1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:21.920
 perceived effort is exceptionally good. Mine is actually really weak. Okay. Heart rate then.

1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:25.600
 I need to do the still the work of connecting heart rate to the perceived effort.

1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:29.840
 Yep. And that's exactly what I would use heart rate for then. And you'll get to a point probably

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:35.280
 by like in the first couple of months where you can still lean on heart rate if you want,

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:38.320
 but it'll be kind of one of those things where you keep looking at it, you're like,

1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:42.240
 oh, wow, I can guess it. And you play a game with yourself too. And you say, well, how close can I

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:46.960
 guess? You'll get it. So like for me, what I'll do is I'll do the run and then I'll look at the

1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:50.720
 heart rate afterwards and be like, oh, cool. I was right there. Or I remember feeling like I

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:53.600
 was speeding up a little bit there and their show is right there on the heart rate. Or

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:59.360
 I also love sort of something we haven't talked about. I love pushups and pull ups of like body

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:04.880
 weight workouts. Again, it's mostly mental. I just enjoy the mental challenge of it. I also like

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:11.120
 it makes me feel like if all I'm doing is running, it makes me feel I'm not like

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:16.240
 one dimensional. Yeah, one dimensional. I mean, there's some aspect to running that's

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.600
 not to be like hippie about it, but like, you know, you're, you're with nature, you're running in

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:26.240
 the, it's like we're born to do this thing. And that same way, I feel like when I'm doing pushups

1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:31.840
 and pull ups, I feel like I was born to do that kind of stuff. Like it's like this body weight

1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:37.600
 exercises have that way about them. It doesn't have that dumbbell feel or doing bench press or

1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:44.080
 squats, squats with weight. When you're just doing squats, body weight, when you're doing pushups

1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:49.520
 and pull ups, body weight, and just basic abs stuff, core stuff, body weight. I don't know,

1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:53.360
 I just love the way I feel doing that. So it's usually, I forgot to mention that part,

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.120
 combine that with the running afterwards, doing some basic body weight stuff.

1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:02.160
 Yeah. And I think like you're going to get from, if we're not looking at it from like specifically

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:09.360
 like training at a pace in order to get both the skeletal muscle adaptations as well as the

1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:13.520
 cardiovascular benefits, you're probably tapping into some of the higher intensity stuff with that

1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:19.120
 body weight stuff. Unless you're doing, I guess, no rest. It's very quick. So is it,

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.280
 you're getting pretty high heart rate from that? Yeah, very hard. Okay. Higher than running. Yep.

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:29.760
 So you're checking that box there from just like a lifestyle, enjoyment, fitness, overall fitness

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:35.040
 standpoint. I think you want to keep your running more aerobic then because you're getting that,

1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:38.560
 and you're probably getting it from like your grappling workouts too, I would guess. So

1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:44.240
 there's just not as big of a need for you from a big picture standpoint to be

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:50.480
 doubling down on that stuff with your runs as well. And it sounds like you prefer not to.

1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:57.760
 That's right. So I mean, what about the distance of marathon versus 100 miles? Is that big

1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:04.240
 difference? What's a good goal to work towards? Is it marathon and the rest of it just takes

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:10.080
 care of itself? So you want to do a marathon and then ultimately do 100 mile after that? Is that

1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.640
 what you're saying? I have no idea what the guy wants to do. Oh, so he's going to tell you spot

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:18.960
 on what you're doing. So you have to be ready for anything. For anything. Right. My own personal

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:26.000
 goal is to feel somewhat challenged, but comfortable running a marathon. The longest I've ever run is

1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.880
 22 miles, but I, you know, there's been many stretches in my life where I would regularly

1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:36.880
 run like the long run would be close to 20 miles. So, you know, and then I was comfortably running

1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:44.800
 10 miles four months ago. It was like forever ago until I injured myself a little bit by running

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:49.680
 in the snow and stubbing my toe to where it was like, you don't realize how much you appreciate

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:56.240
 your toes until you stub them. That big toes where all that power comes off. And so it was

1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:02.320
 surprising how long it took to heal and how essential it was and how unpleasant running,

1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:07.120
 how much you're running with it. And then I kept like coming trying to get back out there

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:12.720
 to run to think, I think it's okay. And no, it's not okay. You really need to let it fully heal.

1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:16.880
 At least that was my experience. I couldn't like just suck it up. It was making it worse every

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:22.720
 time as one of those injuries that could really feel even though it's so small where it's essential.

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:28.320
 So is there any difference between the goal of marathon or 100 miles? Would you say should I be

1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.120
 prepping for 100 miles if that's at all a possibility? The big difference is going to be

1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:38.720
 like you're dropping intensity significantly by going up to 100 miles versus the marathon. So

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:42.400
 the maximum rolling function I think is actually going to feed into that maybe a little bit better.

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:47.840
 It's probably going to be a little closer. Depending on where I mean, it all varies a bit

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:52.320
 because like people will focus on specific distances and they'll get very efficient and very

1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:59.520
 adapted to that. So like the it kind of like it's what makes running kind of messy where like you'll

1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:05.200
 get for for example, like the average person can hit their like lactate threshold for probably

1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:08.640
 about like 60 minutes or something like that. Whereas you get these elite marathoners who've

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:13.520
 been basically spending their entire life preparing for a marathon race, they can push

1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:18.320
 almost up to their lactate threshold and at their lactate threshold for almost like two hours. So

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:24.080
 it gets a little messy when you start looking at it from that lens, but you don't really like to

1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:28.480
 worry about that too much because you're not really focusing on being the best possible 100

1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:33.040
 mile or the best possible marathon you could be. You want enough overall fitness that you can just

1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:40.080
 do either one of them without absolute misery because you did the couch to 100 mile. So I think

1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:44.480
 like for 100 miles the biggest difference I think given your context is just like the more

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:48.480
 physical things you are doing, the better prepared you're going to be for the 100 mile.

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:54.160
 So it's almost given your context. I wouldn't say irrelevant. You want to be doing running,

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.280
 but you're going to be doing that once you put it in your program. It sounds like it's going to be

1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:06.320
 pretty locked in. If you view it this way, it's probably going to be more mentally beneficial

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:12.000
 too where, hey, today I did my run. I did my body weight exercises. I did some grappling practice.

1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:18.320
 I spent three hours working out today. If you think of it like that, then you're moving your

1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:24.560
 body. You're doing things that are active for a good chunk of the day, especially relative to

1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:31.040
 most people. So that's going to actually be very helpful for you. The problem or the battle to get

1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:36.720
 over is going to just be like, you're going to break down physically running 100 miles.

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:42.240
 I mean, you're going to break down physically running a marathon too. So you might just have

1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:47.040
 to push through a little more discomfort from a physical standpoint compared to be a few decided,

1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:55.280
 I'm going to do everything I can in these next 24 weeks to be able to run a full 100 miler.

1:29:55.280 --> 1:30:01.520
 Would you say it's physical or is it mental discomfort? I mean, isn't everything physically

1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:08.800
 uncomfortable? What do you train for if you're training for the chaos of, so it's not necessarily

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:13.360
 100 miles. It's the chaos of the unexpected, which might include 100 miles, but it might also

1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:18.400
 include 1000 pushups in my case. You need a bit jack of all trades, which you need to be. Yeah,

1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:25.920
 but also building up the confidence or maybe not, I don't know, how do you survive 1000 pushups?

1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:31.040
 It's a combination of confidence that you have to know that you can do that kind of thing,

1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:40.320
 not necessarily the actual number, but doing crazy stuff. And the second is probably the base

1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:47.200
 strength and endurance and also just the practicing that process of not quitting.

1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:51.040
 I feel like that's one of the things I really need to do in the running space

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:56.640
 is like doing slightly unpleasant things where I'm practicing that like bringing my mind back and

1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:02.960
 saying, nope, I'm going to keep doing it. And part of the running every day has that benefit

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:07.120
 because some days you really don't want to, don't feel like running and doing that then you're

1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:13.760
 practicing that muscle of doing it anyway. I don't know if there's something you can say in

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:21.200
 terms of advice how to practice the like doing something unpleasant every day. Yeah, what I

1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:27.760
 would do with that is I would try to make the unpleasant thing be different from one day to

1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:34.560
 the next if you can. So the fear I would have with making running unpleasant every time would be

1:31:34.560 --> 1:31:41.200
 it becomes like a negative feedback loop in your physiologically potentially as well as mentally

1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:47.280
 where if the entire running process is miserable, you're going to be miserable when you step on

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:51.840
 that starting line, whether it's a marathon or 100 miles. So you've trained yourself that running

1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:56.160
 equals miserable. Well, and here's the thing, like, I mean, if you look at just like, here's where

1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:01.280
 the literature says on paper are like the, you know, dozen workouts you should do in a training

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:06.000
 plan. And this is how you should structure them right down to the minute. And you just say like,

1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:10.240
 I'm going to give everyone this schedule, and they're going to do this every time rinse and repeat.

1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:16.560
 My biggest concern with that approach is you are potentially putting them in a position where

1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:22.960
 the training is so boring and so monotonous, that like, if they hit a roadblock mentally,

1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:26.880
 they're going to fall apart very quick because they've already exhausted themselves mentally,

1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:31.840
 just trying to do the same old interval every time, doing the same old, you know, workout,

1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:37.040
 and it doesn't necessarily have to be like one specific plan in its entirety could just be like,

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:42.880
 like the mix of things within it. So like, rather than like, if I just said, well, we're going to do

1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:46.880
 three minute intervals to this entire short interval process or two minute intervals or

1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:52.240
 four minute intervals or 60 second intervals, you know, by that sixth week, they might be so sick

1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:55.920
 of that that they're not actually maximizing the potential within that because there's no flavor

1:32:55.920 --> 1:33:00.720
 there. And then they're also actually getting less out of themselves than they would if we just got

1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:06.000
 a little more creative and said, okay, let's mix this up and let's do, you know, four one minute

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:10.960
 intervals, then take a little bit of a break and then we'll do three minute intervals or at least

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:13.920
 changing it up from week to week so that they have something different showing up even though

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:20.240
 we're addressing the same kind of physiological adaptation. So like, I think what you want to do

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:24.080
 is you want to introduce the misery, you want to be able to test yourself to the degree where

1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:28.160
 like when you can recognize these points if I don't want to be here, but I can do it and push

1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:34.960
 through it, but recognize that like, there's not necessarily going to be one event that you want

1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:38.880
 to lean on to get that from because you won't want to make that one event so miserable that you

1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:43.680
 don't want to do it when it comes time for the challenge. So if you can possibly say like, okay,

1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:49.920
 on Tuesdays, the pushup workout, I'm going to go 10 pushups more than I want to I'm going to get to

1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:53.120
 that point where I'm like, there's no more and then I'm going to do 10 more. And you're going to

1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:59.040
 make that one miserable. And then maybe on, you know, Thursdays, you decide to do like some

1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:03.440
 of those sprints or something at the end where you do a few of them and you're like, okay,

1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:06.080
 this is where I'd be comfortable to stop. Like, well, I'm going to do two more of them because I

1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:10.400
 know I don't want to do two more of them, but mix that up. So you're not, so at least you're

1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:14.880
 getting enjoyment from some of it and not just getting complete disgust from the entire price.

1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:20.240
 Yeah, there's actually quite a lot of ways that I can introduce misery into the pushups and the

1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:25.040
 running get creative, including, you know, even just like stuff outside of the running, like

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.320
 taking a freezing cold shower or those kinds of things, just introducing random kind of chaos

1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:37.360
 into the system or having conversations with people as an introvert is terrifying. More podcasts.

1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:47.680
 So now starting the training and Zach, you've been kind enough to also kind of be willing to

1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:52.480
 help me out throughout this process. So I look forward to where that goes. It's kind of fascinating.

1:34:53.280 --> 1:35:01.200
 On the diet side, you're one of the many things that make you fascinating is you've played with

1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:06.640
 diet as well. And you're somewhat famous, I would say, if we're doing low carb or playing with low

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:12.000
 carb or meat based diets, can you describe the potential, like how you're thinking about that

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:18.400
 has evolved and the potential beneficial role of a carnivore diet or keto diet or a meat based

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:23.040
 diet in training as an ultra marathon runner? Yeah. And I think like where a lot of times

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:27.280
 things get confusing for people here is the context of it too, where it's like they want

1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:33.600
 an answer as to what do I eat for endurance sport? And it's like, well, endurance sport is quite wide

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:37.600
 ranging as we've talked about many times here. So there's going to be differences, I think,

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:43.600
 in just like what you want to maybe necessarily prioritize both for the event you're doing

1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:47.680
 and the intensity that's required for training that's required for that event. And then also

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.720
 the individual component to where I think this one often gets overlooked where we tend to say,

1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:58.720
 like, well, we've got all these Olympic medalists at the marathon and below distance who are,

1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:03.920
 you know, eating a moderate to high carbohydrate diet. So everyone needs to do that if they want

1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:10.480
 to reach their potential in, you know, say the 3k to the marathon. And, you know, in a perfect

1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:15.120
 world, maybe that would be true. But there's a lot of other variables that often get forgotten

1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:21.280
 then that could positively or negatively impact that decision choice. So I think Dr. Jeff Volk

1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:25.360
 has done a great job of kind of highlighting this in the sense that, you know, when he works with

1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:29.520
 people, he works with people in the health sphere as well as the performance sphere. And, you know,

1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:35.280
 he's one of the main guys at Virta Health who's they've got like a 60% success rate with working

1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:42.320
 with folks with type two diabetes to reverse their type two diabetes. And I mean, that's an

1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:47.200
 astounding when you think of just any nutritional protocol at success rate, they're all incredibly

1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:52.400
 low. They're very, very low. And the big difference with his is the coaching aspect of it. Like,

1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:55.920
 they give support. So these people like have someone to turn to when they make a mistake,

1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:58.720
 or if they're thinking about doing something differently, or they don't know what to do,

1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.240
 rather than just kind of throwing throwing it all up in the air and quitting, they have a resource

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:07.680
 there. And that's probably a big reason why that's the success rate that they have with that is

1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:13.280
 they put those support mechanisms in place. That picture needs to be carried into the performance

1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:20.640
 world or the running world to where, you know, we may have just been identifying that, you know,

1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:27.120
 Olympic distance athletes that can tolerate a very large portion of their diet coming from

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:33.040
 carbohydrate is going to just, it's going to filter those ones towards the Olympics filter

1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:39.440
 those towards the same. Yeah. And that doesn't mean that like, if we would have taken, say the

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:43.280
 gold medals in the five K and put them on a low carb diet, they'd run faster, they probably wouldn't

1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:46.400
 because we may have already selected that that person's thriving on carbohydrate.

1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.920
 What I would be interested in is like, you have, let's say we have someone with equal talent,

1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:57.360
 but got weeded out along the way, potentially because for whatever reason, they just weren't

1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:01.120
 able to tolerate like both the training and the nutrition requirements that they're being told

1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:05.040
 to do. So the coach is kind of, there's a culture where the coaches would really push a carb heavy

1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:12.720
 diet and that that would in itself would do the filtering process of people that are not, it would

1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:17.200
 filter out the people that are not able to tolerate carbs as part of their training. I mean, I might

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.880
 be an example of this actually where you take someone where they, for whatever reason, the carbs

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:26.640
 aren't working for them, like it's unsustainable for them to continue that path. Or if they do,

1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:29.600
 they might have a shortened career. So they might be able to eke out a few really good years,

1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:33.280
 but then they're not going to be the person that are like, wow, that person's 38 and they're still

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:40.800
 competing at the Olympics type of a person. And you put them on a low carb diet. If you can control

1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:47.200
 everything else, like their entire lifestyle is based around training and racing, then they may

1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:54.960
 still have better potential by introducing carbohydrates at a higher level. But if that's

1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:01.440
 not going to be sustainable for them as a person, then what's the point kind of at that?

1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:05.360
 Unless they want to be like a spark in the pan, so to speak.

1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:08.800
 I just feel good eating meat performance wise.

1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:12.400
 Well, I think there's that group too. They may just not be the Olympians.

1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:17.840
 Yeah. And so we're not talking, I guess this conversation has several layers. One is for

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:26.720
 the Olympics. And one is for like, what is it, active athletes, they're like amateurs,

1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:31.600
 whatever, whatever category I put myself into, like people that exercise regularly. And then

1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:39.280
 maybe people, and then there's people who like exercise rarely. So on all of those fronts,

1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:47.760
 I mean, do you think it's possible to live a happy, active life eating meat only or mostly meat?

1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:48.800
 Yeah.

1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:50.240
 What have you learned about this?

1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:54.960
 Yeah, I think so for some context, like I followed what I would call a low carbohydrate

1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:00.720
 diet for the last 10 years. And just like kind of the training, I periodize it to a degree where

1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:04.640
 there are parts of my training where I do bring back a little more carbohydrate. And there's

1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:07.680
 periods of my training, especially like the off season where I'm like very low. And I might be

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:13.200
 like kind of in that ballpark of like, you know, ketogenic, strict ketogenic or no carbohydrates

1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:14.400
 for periods of time.

1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:18.960
 And what kind of food are we talking about? What's a strict low carb diet?

1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.840
 I've ranged everywhere from like mostly plant based low carb keto to like mostly animal based.

1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:30.640
 I've very rarely gone much more than like two weeks strict where it's like I'm strict carnivore or

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.640
 strict plant based or anything like that. Like we're talking probably more like 95%

1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:43.520
 at the peak in terms of any type of like longer lasting from my personal experience of like being

1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:48.720
 like either in like the animal food camp or like the plant based camp kind of a process.

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:53.120
 So I've tried all of them things that stayed consistent over the 10 years as a kind of the

1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:55.840
 macro nutrient profile that I've done throughout the course.

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:59.120
 So one didn't win over the other until it was a meat based versus plant based?

1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:04.400
 Oh, for me, meat based, definitely. What was, I mean, I was my highest meat consumption in 2019

1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:05.840
 and that was by far my best racing season.

1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:10.080
 Yeah, we keep coming back to that year. That was a good year for many reasons,

1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:11.840
 philosophically and nutritionally.

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:14.560
 Yeah. Well, in 2020 happened and now I haven't had a really good chance to

1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:20.240
 We'll see. Hopefully I've got some more in the tank.

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:23.600
 That's strange is most athletes that competed at your level

1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:27.920
 have more carbs integrated into their diets.

1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:31.520
 So what have you learned about using meat in high performance?

1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:37.280
 I think it's maybe less about the meat and it's more about like what are you, what is it replacing?

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:44.720
 So if we go, if we step away from like me specifically and just like the people that,

1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:47.920
 because I mean, we're getting to the point where I get its anecdotes, but like,

1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:51.280
 like that's what we have at the moment because there's, I mean, there is actually a study being

1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:54.720
 done on like, I think, I guess they'd call it hyper carnivore where they're like,

1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:57.360
 I think above 80% of their intake from meat.

1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:00.720
 And they're looking at a few different things there.

1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:05.680
 But it's so weird and I keep interrupting, but so weird that it sounds unhealthy,

1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:09.440
 hyper carnivore, but it makes me feel really good.

1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:12.080
 So that's the individual thing, right?

1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:13.920
 Yeah, the individual thing.

1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:19.040
 There's countless people now who like, and I'm not saying that they could not have found

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:23.600
 another route, myself included, like in 2011, when I switched from moderate to high carbohydrate

1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:28.640
 to low carbohydrate and saw some very noticeable differences in the way I felt,

1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:33.600
 the way I performed and all this stuff, that doesn't mean that there wasn't another path.

1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:35.120
 I just did not find that path.

1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:42.000
 And the, the fact that I found a path that was producing the results I was looking for

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.600
 is really all that matters in my mind, you know, like, I don't really care if there was

1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:49.600
 a parallel path that works just as well or, you know, something like that.

1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:53.600
 Because ultimately we only have one shot at everything we're doing.

1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:56.800
 So like, it'd be great if I could go back and try four or five different things.

1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:00.960
 Well, the annoying thing is that the body adjusts to whatever the heck you're doing.

1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:03.520
 So you can't, it's hard to do good science even on yourself.

1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:06.320
 Yeah, I've referenced my 2019 racing season a few times.

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:10.480
 And it's like, it'd be silly for me to put all of the emphasis on my nutrition plan for that

1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:14.160
 because it's also comes with two decades of endurance training.

1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:18.400
 So it's possible and it's very likely that a huge portion of that success was just the

1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:21.440
 culmination of a lot of work over time from the training side of things.

1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:28.240
 I just think like anytime you hyper focus on one area or pick a couple variables and just target

1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:32.960
 those, you find yourself in a position where you are, you're putting other things in the most

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:34.320
 uncharitable light possible.

1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:40.160
 So, so then you have this situation where like, it's actually a combination of a variety of

1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:45.280
 different things. So where are the big movers? And, you know, for me, nutritional shift was

1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:48.080
 pretty clear that that improved my sleep and my recovery.

1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:53.920
 And I mean, people can say, well, there's the placebo effect, which is a very real concern.

1:43:53.920 --> 1:43:58.880
 But, you know, for me personally, a 10 year placebo effect would be a quite lengthy placebo

1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:03.920
 effect. And I do think it's individual though. I emphasize that a lot because I mean,

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:08.240
 I've worked with tons of people with this and I do see a range from person to person.

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:13.520
 I've worked with people who come to me and they're like strict keto and we raise up their

1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:18.080
 carbohydrates a bit and they're like, okay, I feel way better doing it this way. And I've

1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:22.000
 worked with people who they come to me moderate carbohydrate, but they're interested enough.

1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:28.080
 They want to try a lower carb. So we, you know, we titrate them down and I've had clients where

1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:31.680
 I'm like, okay, I'm going to give them this workout and they're going to wish they brought

1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:35.360
 back a little bit of carbohydrate and then they go and they nail the workout and I'm just like

1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:39.280
 baffled that because they're different from me. And every time, you know, when you have your

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:44.720
 own personal experience, the first kind of guttural response is, oh, if I had done it,

1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:48.320
 would have gone this way. Why did it go the opposite way for them? And you kind of have to

1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:52.720
 just kind of step out of your own perspective a bit and say like, okay, well, they're different,

1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:56.000
 you know, for whatever reason, they're getting, getting along like this.

1:44:56.560 --> 1:44:59.920
 I've had like several moments in my life where you kind of realize

1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:06.320
 that the body is weird and it's weirder than the average advice. Like one of them is how well

1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:14.000
 I perform for my own standards when I fast. First of all, intellectually, but that's more known

1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:20.080
 and understandable, but like physically, the fact that I could train like not eat 20 hours,

1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:29.280
 24 hours, and then do a hard like jujitsu session for like two hours, like hard. It's incredible

1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:34.720
 to me. Like this makes no sense because I used to eat like many times a day. Of course, you have

1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.720
 to eat like you don't want to eat too close to the training session was my thinking, but you

1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:43.120
 definitely need to load up on carbs like three hours before they can order to have enough energy.

1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:49.600
 The fact that I could not eat and have like incredible focus, but also athleticism, like both

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:55.760
 endurance and explosive. I mean, jujitsu is a special thing. It's like more like chess.

1:45:55.760 --> 1:46:01.440
 It's not like powerlifting. No, not powerlifting. Olympic lifting or it's like true explosiveness,

1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:08.080
 but that's fascinating. It makes me wonder like what other things are there to discover about

1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:14.400
 yourself? The annoying thing about food is it's delicious. And so it's hard to do good science

1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:22.720
 on yourself. Like to do for two weeks or a month to do like strict no carbs. And then maybe next

1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:28.640
 month you add 20 grams or 40 grams of carbs and see how you actually feel. Not like in that moment,

1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:34.480
 but over a period of several weeks. And then doing everything else right with based on best

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:39.520
 available science, like with electrolytes and the vitamins, but then also like remove all the

1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:44.640
 humans from your life that affect you positively or negatively because you might feel amazing

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:49.600
 because you're hanging out with cool people and then removing basically all the variables.

1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:55.040
 It's kind of fascinating and you kind of all of us land in a place where we find something that

1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:59.920
 worked for us and then we maybe use some of the placebo effect to help us out to stick in that

1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:06.560
 place. And then I suppose that's the way to live life. It's impossible to find the optimal for

1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:14.240
 any of us, but carnivore is an interesting new kind of caveat and new challenge to the

1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:19.760
 nutritional community because more and more people seem to be doing well under carnivore.

1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:24.720
 Yeah. Well, the nutrition community is probably we just got done like dealing with the vegans.

1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:29.280
 Now we got this opposite end of the spectrum coming at us. But I think, well, I mean, what this all

1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:39.760
 tells me is like there is for one like in our food environment, like the failure rate of any one

1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:44.480
 approach at a population level is going to be incredibly high. I mean, it's why we have what

1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:50.640
 is it like 88% of the population has some sort of metabolic syndrome. And it's because there's

1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:54.320
 an endless quantity of everything that you can get your hands on for relatively cheap.

1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:02.480
 And I think that presents a problem if your mindset is going to be we need this set of

1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:07.760
 parameters for nutrition and everyone needs to adhere to that or you're wrong. And it's like,

1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:13.280
 well, tell that to the person who like went carnivore and cleared up some like crazy skin

1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:18.080
 ailment or something like that. That's a weird one. Yeah. Like where the carnivore seems to treat

1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:25.120
 like like depression. It's like like mental stuff. It's fascinating. There's all these stories. Again,

1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:31.360
 it's anecdotes, but it's like the mental one, I think may I'm stepping out a bit on a limb here.

1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:37.360
 But I want to say like some of the research of Dominic DiAgostino and Jeff Valic was looking at

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:43.440
 the ketogenic diet, which a carnivore diet is basically going to be a part of a ketogenic.

1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:48.560
 I mean, you could always go like way too high on the protein, I guess, but most people that I see

1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:54.320
 doing carnivore, they're cognizant enough that at least if they're doing it for therapeutic reasons,

1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:00.400
 they're not going like, you know, 50% protein 50% they're more like 70, 30, 80, 20, something like

1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:08.560
 that. And I think like you do see some work with like the brain and so the mental stuff. I know

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:14.960
 some of the, I'm not sure if this was part of the DARPA funding that Dr. Dominic DiAgostino had,

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:19.200
 where they were looking at things like mental stuff, like post traumatic stress disorder and

1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:23.760
 that sort of stuff with like a strict ketogenic diet. So I wonder if some of that like the

1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:27.680
 depression related stuff has to do with that, where now like their body is just fueling their brain

1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:32.960
 differently than maybe they were in the past. But that's just, you know, wild guesses on my part.

1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:35.760
 And I'm deviating from the conversation. But like,

1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:41.920
 No, that's brilliant. In terms of your own story on food, can you say something? I think we're

1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:48.960
 kind of referring to diet broadly. Can you say something about how you like to fuel your, like,

1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:56.560
 whether it's race or great training sessions, like maybe the day before, let's go even that far,

1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:04.080
 during and maybe a few hours after. Okay. It'll be a little different for racing than it will be

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:07.840
 for like a big workout just because the interesting thing about ultra running is just like you never

1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:11.440
 do the race even like most endurance races, you're going to cover the distance, you're going to

1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:16.880
 replicate the race almost up to it in training, whereas with a hundred miles, you can't, you

1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:21.440
 might replicate a third of it. So, so I'll do, I'll walk you through kind of my approach for

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:24.960
 for like a hundred mile race. And I can tell you maybe what I would do differently on like a training

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:31.760
 day. But yeah, so for where the community is an agreement is that you do want to be

1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:36.720
 very good at burning fat for ultramarathons. I mean, there's just like the intensity is low.

1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:44.720
 If your, if your ratios are skewed very high towards carbohydrate metabolism, then you're

1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:51.280
 going to have to defend your muscle glycogen through tons of carbohydrate consumption. And

1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:55.200
 that's just going to be very hard to do over the course of an entire day, even at low intensities.

1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:59.680
 So it's a fuel tank thing. I mean, it's like your, your leanest endurance athletes have way more

1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:04.400
 fat than they do glycogen stores. When you're doing low intensity performance, you want to be

1:51:04.400 --> 1:51:10.480
 burning high levels of fat and sparing that muscle glycogen. What I tend to do is I want to

1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:14.800
 start the race burning really high levels of fat. So I'm going to, I'll maybe have some carbohydrate

1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.680
 the night before for dinner, but then I'm going to lean into the overnight fast breakfast, the morning

1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:24.560
 of, I'm going to stay away from carbohydrates for a hundred mile or anyway. And I'm going to have

1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:32.480
 something like something that's pretty like the high energy, low volume. So like I'll do like an

1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:38.800
 S fuels life bar. They've got like, what's in an S fuel life bar? Are we talking about carbs or

1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:44.480
 we're talking about protein? Fat protein, fat protein bar. And then they make some awesome.

1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:50.160
 Yeah. So it's not as low carb. Yep. Yeah, they make S fuels makes a whole product line that's

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:56.080
 like kind of positioned for a low carb athlete. So they have some products on their lineup that

1:51:56.080 --> 1:52:00.240
 offer some carbohydrate, which is perfect for me because I do introduce some carbohydrate on racing

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.840
 and some of my bigger training sessions and things. But the majority of their products are low carb.

1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:10.080
 So like they have like, you know, how you get like the powders that you put into like your

1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:14.480
 drinks that are like high carbohydrate, you know, sports products, they make a version of that,

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:20.080
 that's like fat based. Oh, cool. That you can mix in with water? Yep. Cool. Yeah. So they've got

1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:23.600
 like a creamer version and then a fruity flavor version. So you can like replicate the taste

1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:28.080
 and the feel of drinking like a, like, you know, a sports drink. That's awesome. I know it is.

1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:31.040
 Well, and that's so much of it too, because people are always like, I don't know, I just,

1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:35.280
 I just like to have my Gatorade or whatever. It's like, well, you can have it now. It just,

1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:39.360
 it won't have all. So you can bring that kind of thing with you. Yeah. So I'm leaning on a lot

1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:45.440
 of those like kind of liquid calories, like those low volume, high energy, fat protein stuff the

1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:49.360
 morning of so that when I start the race, my body is going to be encouraged to start out burning

1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:55.120
 high levels of fat. Once I get going, probably about 45 minutes in, I'll start introducing

1:52:55.120 --> 1:53:00.720
 small amounts of carbohydrate. So at that point, my body's revving pretty high fat metabolism.

1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:07.120
 And by introducing some carbohydrate in the context of the, you know, let's say my 100 mile

1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:13.440
 personnel record, you know, I'm, I'm running approximately nine miles every hour. So I'm

1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:18.560
 probably going through about a thousand calories in an hour's time. I'm going to start just like

1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:23.920
 defending muscle glycogen by burning super high levels of fat at the heart rate I would do for

1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:28.480
 that. I'm probably burning somewhere between 80, 90% fat, you know, 12 hours of that you

1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:33.280
 can chip away at your muscle glycogen to the point where you don't necessarily want to go zero

1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:38.480
 carb. So I'm basically just trying to defend what I know I'm going to be burning from the carbohydrate

1:53:38.480 --> 1:53:45.280
 side of that 80 to 90% fat, 10 to 20% carbohydrate by taking in like usually, you know, I've gone

1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:50.640
 as low as about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour and as high as 40 grams. And the reality is

1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.920
 somewhere in between is probably the sweet spot, but 40 I can get away without any digestion issues.

1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:01.120
 So I'm not really concerned pushing up to that during a race since I'm only concerned about

1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:06.240
 performance on that day. Is it the carbs that's the problem or is it fiber? Oh, from going about

1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:12.000
 40 grams? Or just because you mentioned digestion issues. Like one of the things for me, like one

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:17.440
 of the cool things about fatty protein, protein of fat is like my stomach just feels way better.

1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:23.920
 So like carbs introduce like bloating and just not feeling great. Yeah. And I think the funny

1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:28.320
 thing is like if you look at the position paper for ultramarathon single day events and it's,

1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:32.000
 you know, it's very limited in the sense that then it's not anyone's fault. It's just we don't have

1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.520
 a lot of great research on 100 mile races. It's really hard to study what's going on when someone's

1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:41.120
 running 100 miles. But they will say a moderate carbohydrate diet is recommended, but they'll

1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:45.360
 also say that it's like something like 60% of participants are going to report some sort of

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:49.760
 like digestion issue during the event. So then it kind of becomes an issue of do you want to flip

1:54:49.760 --> 1:54:55.920
 that coin? Do you want to flip that coin and be the 40% right? Exactly. So for me, what I found

1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:03.600
 is like I can push up to 40 grams without getting any digestion issues. Do I need 40 grams? Probably

1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:10.800
 not at least not based on kind of the numbers that would be like that I would see on like if I

1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:15.200
 went and actually got like a metabolic heart test or something like that. But it's possible. I mean,

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:20.240
 if I had a really good race that I would get close to burning that per hour. Most folks that

1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:24.240
 are following a moderate high carbohydrate diet are going to be recommended to like 50 to 70 grams

1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:29.440
 during a single day ultra marathon event. And you'll see some, you know, some recommendations

1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:34.960
 of up to like 100 grams, not so much for ultra marathons, but just in general for like a performance

1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:40.320
 standpoint, which I mean, it's one of those things where it's like application versus like what you

1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:44.160
 can do in a lab for one hour is going to be a lot different, especially when you're stretching out

1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:49.920
 distances well past that. And there's, there's, I'm diverting a little here, but I mean, there's

1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.880
 like an approach of like training your gut so you can like be able to tolerate that much carbohydrate,

1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:59.200
 which you can do and you may have to if you're going to follow a high carbohydrate diet. But again,

1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:05.040
 we go back to that practicality standpoint of if you're a professional Olympian who's living and

1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:10.640
 breathing performance and you're burning two to three times, you're messing, resting metabolic

1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:17.280
 rate on some days, like you, you may be able to actually consume 100 grams of carbohydrate per

1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:21.840
 hour during your training sessions and, and just, you know, barely stay on top of your nutritional

1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:26.320
 needs. Most people who are running ultra marathons aren't going to be, you know, probably training

1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:32.800
 much past 10 hours per week. And they're probably not going to have the, I'll call it they're a

1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:38.240
 dietary budget to tolerate 100 grams of carbohydrate consumption during their workouts and still be able

1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:45.280
 to stay healthy. And, you know, so I think that's kind of like a, a bit of a, of a non, a non starter

1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:50.560
 for the majority of people. Unless we want to talk about like a tiny percentage of the 1% of

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:54.560
 top performers. So maybe you can talk about the training, like feeling yourself during training

1:56:54.560 --> 1:57:03.440
 as well. Is there, and also as part of that, is it possible to train mostly fasted? Because as a

1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:10.960
 side comment, let me just say, I like, again, not anywhere, not even like one tenth of your level

1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:16.720
 of performance, but you know, I try to push myself and I just feel much better when I'm fasted. So

1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:22.880
 water and maybe some salt for longer runs for anything over like 10, 15 miles, but not no food.

1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:27.920
 Yeah, I think, I mean, I like to train on an empty stomach. I do most of my, my biggest training

1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:31.440
 sessions usually in the morning and it usually what'll determine whether I eat something or not

1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:34.640
 before that is like, how much do I need to eat that day in order to stay on top of it to be able

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:38.960
 to train again the next day. Gotcha. So I'll, I'll, I'll usually do something similar to what I

1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:42.880
 would do before a race if I need to kind of stay on top of calories for the day. So I'm not like at

1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:48.880
 noon with like no calorie intake and like 5,000 calories to try to consume before I go to bed

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:55.200
 that night and get out and do the same thing the next day. But yeah, I think if I were, if I were

1:57:55.200 --> 1:58:00.720
 doing what you're doing, like if that were my lifestyle, I think I would do almost all my runs

1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:06.560
 fasted. I don't see why I would be eating a lot before it because it's like, I'm just introducing

1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:12.560
 something that could, especially if you're noticing, like here's what I'd say. If I was doing that and

1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:16.400
 I was like, wow, this run sucks. And then I introduced something beforehand and now my run

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:19.840
 was feeling great and my progress was getting better. That's when I would maybe consider

1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:24.320
 having something before, but if you're running both of those, those like self experiments,

1:58:24.320 --> 1:58:28.720
 you're noticing, yeah, if I eat something before I go on this workout, the workouts less enjoyable,

1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:33.440
 I'm not noticing any, any increased improvements on it. Again, it's a little messy, like we said

1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:37.200
 before, it's hard to really, you can't go back and try it a different way on that specific day.

1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:43.120
 But I think, I think most people, if they're just like, they go at it with like no bias in the

1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:47.840
 sense that they're like trying to make one work versus the other, you can get at least a good

1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:54.320
 enough look at it. And if absolute peak performance in one activity, one very specific activity,

1:58:55.200 --> 1:59:00.480
 isn't your goal, then it's like, do you really care if one X has a 2% performance increase

1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:04.480
 that you won't even probably notice? Because there's other variables that will clearly overpower

1:59:04.480 --> 1:59:10.000
 that 2% one way or the other. And there's some benefit in terms of freedom and letting go of like

1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:16.160
 having to think about some of these variables. I see sort of fasting is even if it's like a hit on

1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:22.000
 the performance, it's worth it to just not think about it. There's some really nice aspect to just

1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:28.080
 putting on shoes, not carrying like what shorts you wear or like what you're outfit is like not

1:59:28.080 --> 1:59:34.080
 being optimal in every way and just not caring and just enjoying the purity of just running,

1:59:34.080 --> 1:59:39.680
 no matter what, just enjoying the natural aspect. There's a side to me that sometimes just like

1:59:39.680 --> 1:59:47.280
 craves a lifestyle where it's like, I have like such a small house and only what I need and just

1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:51.200
 like a handful of food products I know I enjoy and work well for me and I don't even have the

1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:55.520
 distraction of the other stuff. There's like a there's like a there's almost like a weight that

1:59:55.520 --> 1:59:59.280
 comes off your shoulders when you can when you think even just thinking about it like it's so

1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:04.480
 simple. So the reason I'm mostly a minimalist like that, the reason I have stuff is I realize like

2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:09.360
 you probably have to fit into society and if you want to have other people in your life,

2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:13.840
 you should probably get used to having stuff. Yeah. Because most people like stuff.

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:18.240
 Right. Well, yeah, there's that side of it too. And there's there's a whole,

2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:23.120
 you don't want to ostracize yourself too much. And I think anything you can kind of like,

2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:27.600
 you can manipulate that a little bit where there's things that are like not specific to,

2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:32.960
 you know, that's gonna negative impact the people around you or your experiences with them.

2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.120
 So there's a balance like everything, I guess. Yeah. I mean, that's why I drink,

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:44.480
 I think I mentioned you offline, drink vodka, whiskey, sort of alcohol, because I don't feel good

2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:50.560
 about it the day after or sometimes multiple days after. So I know it's not good for me.

2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:53.760
 So I do a lot of stuff that's good for me. Everything we talked about,

2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:57.680
 exercise and diet and all those kinds of things. But the alcohol almost symbolizes

2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:03.680
 embracing the chaos of life, the, the wild and the amazing things that could happen.

2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:08.320
 And I think that's really important because if you optimize everything about life,

2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:13.280
 then you're going to miss most of the fun stuff that happens in life. So it's not

2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:18.560
 all about the optimization. It's some of it, like everyone has different things

2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:23.920
 on what they, how they introduce that chaos in a controlled way. For me, alcohol is that because

2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:30.240
 I'm okay drinking not too much. So I can control that aspect. Even though it's unhealthy,

2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:35.280
 it introduces just the right amount of fun that I embrace it. Yeah. And I mean,

2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:39.360
 it is one of those things where it's like, I'm going to benefit now and pay later a little bit too,

2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:46.080
 where like, and hey, if you go and you, you go out with some friends and drink and you have

2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:50.240
 memories that last a lifetime from that experience and you paid for it for a couple of days after,

2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:54.080
 then maybe that's a fair trade off from life experience. And part of the vodka thing is,

2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:59.280
 I need to honor my ancestors. So it's like, you have to, you know, you can't,

2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:09.040
 you can't turn your back on your past. Let me ask about the 100 mile world record on the treadmill.

2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:16.240
 So for most people running on a treadmill is really boring. So that's kind of their experience

2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.000
 of it. That's probably the first thing that would say that seems like really boring to run 100 miles

2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:27.040
 in a treadmill. Would you say it's boring? Like, what were some places your mind went to make that

2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:33.600
 happen? So this one is interesting to me because I definitely recognized the boredom and the,

2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:38.480
 the difference. The thing that the question I can't quite answer, I think with it is like,

2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:44.000
 could I have remedied that with better preparation? Because the scenario that put me on a treadmill

2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:49.760
 for 100 miles was, you know, it was March, 2020, basically the cascade of every race

2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:54.560
 on the planet got canceled. And I was in a position where I was going to be doing a

2:02:54.560 --> 2:03:01.840
 runnable 100 miler on a track in mid to late April. So I had like the majority of my training

2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:05.760
 under my belt. So I was like, kind of putting the finishing touches on that. And I was like,

2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:11.200
 oh, great. Here we are. Like, you know, what do I do with this fitness? Do I just scale back and

2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:16.480
 hope the events come back in fall and then peak again? Or do I find something to use this fitness

2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:20.800
 for? And the treadmill was the closest thing to what I had been training for in terms of just

2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:27.360
 like a mechanical like flat running, essentially, that I could, that I could think of. And my thought

2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:33.040
 was, okay, well, I'll just live stream myself on a treadmill and see what happens. It ended up turning

2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.760
 into like a quite a big event. But so you don't usually incorporate treadmill running into your

2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:42.480
 running into your training? I don't not incorporate it. I just don't incorporate it in the way that

2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:48.160
 would be necessarily conducive to, you know, dealing with the mental aspects of being on a

2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:53.680
 treadmill for 100 miles. Was it that different than running on a track? It was from the sense

2:03:53.680 --> 2:03:57.280
 that here's the way I describe it is when I'm on a track, it's a controlled environment and

2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:03.760
 everything can be very uniform. But there are tiny, little micro adjustments in pace that

2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:09.440
 that I'm doing subconsciously that give me the sense of control, right? No, I might run the exact

2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:14.560
 same split, but there's like a fraction of a second or, you know, a fraction second faster than

2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:18.080
 a fraction seconds slower, that equals the same outcome. It gives you that sense of control,

2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:23.280
 you're determining how fast you're going on a treadmill, you're responding to the belt. So

2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:27.920
 the advantage is you can set a pace and know you're hitting it. The disadvantage is you're

2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:32.880
 being told what to do by that machine. And that gets very frustrating. I've felt like I wanted

2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:37.840
 to step off, like you get to like certain points where you're just like, like even stepping off

2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:41.280
 what I noticed, I learned this on the day of actually, I noticed there's something where it

2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:44.800
 didn't really matter how long I get off, like I get off to use the bathroom, and that was a little

2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:52.000
 bit of a longer break. Then I had, I had like a hiccup during my event where we ran so much power

2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:57.920
 through one end of the house that the screen on the treadmill was blacking out. So we ended up,

2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:00.960
 so I ended up jumping back and forth on treadmills for quite a bit in the beginning.

2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:04.720
 And I noticed even turning it off, stepping on the other end, starting the other one up,

2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:09.280
 gave me like, you know, a handful of seconds between, was enough of a mental break of just

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:14.560
 like that release of being told what to do to reset. So maybe if you were in the future, you would

2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:18.960
 figure out what exactly how much is needed to have them at the break. I never actually thought

2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:24.720
 about that. I mean, obviously for you, but also for people like me, like amateur runners, that

2:05:24.720 --> 2:05:30.080
 that's the source of frustration with the treadmill, that there's sometimes small adjustments in pace

2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:37.600
 that we do running, not on the treadmill, on the ground that feel like essential for that feel,

2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:42.880
 just like you said, that experience of control, like feeling like you're in control, somehow

2:05:42.880 --> 2:05:47.760
 that's really, I don't know, that's somehow liberating in the way that a treadmill can be just

2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:53.600
 the source of frustration. The funny thing though about the treadmill is I actually like to do

2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:58.800
 faster workouts on the treadmill, like long intervals or something like that or tempo runs,

2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:04.720
 because for that type of stuff, sometimes for those, I want to release the brain power required

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:09.040
 to hit that pace and say, you take care of that. And for that, it's fun, but those are over quick,

2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:13.920
 so you don't really run into the times. Yeah, that's fascinating. For like precise control

2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:19.280
 of pace. You've also, during that stream, got to interact with one of the greatest athletes of

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:23.440
 all time, birth pressure, what's your, he's actually doing, I don't know if you're paying

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:27.840
 attention to this, but I guess he has a goal of running 2000 miles this year. Yeah. I don't,

2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:34.480
 I've gotten, she has to talk to Joe Rogan yesterday about this, which is fascinating.

2:06:34.480 --> 2:06:40.960
 I think he's a little bit doubtful of, of Bert's ability to be the ultra performer that he so

2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:46.880
 naturally is. Yeah. What's your thoughts about Bert as a runner? What's your advice to him?

2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:51.200
 And what was your interaction like as part of this treadmill challenge with him?

2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:58.640
 I love Bert because he's such a nice person. I mean, as a guy who's just accelerated in popularity

2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:04.960
 over the last few years, like he is like super kind. So for folks who are curious, like, I've

2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:09.360
 met Bert a couple of years earlier, and I just randomly asked him like, Hey, I'm doing this

2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:12.960
 live stream thing. We're doing it for fight for the forgotten. We're trying to raise some funds

2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:17.680
 for them. Would you want to come on the live stream for a bit? And I thought maybe he'd come

2:07:17.680 --> 2:07:20.720
 off like five or 10 minutes. And I thought that would be amazing if he did that. He ended up

2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:24.880
 coming off like over an hour. He said, he went past his slot, sat in the next slot and just

2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:30.480
 started talking with some of the other guests. It's just, he's just, Bert is definitely like,

2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:35.520
 I feel like he's as unchanged from like his popularity as one can get away with.

2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:43.680
 And it's just like his, his lifestyle, I think is very unpredictable in the sense that like,

2:07:44.320 --> 2:07:50.480
 if he wants to run like X time for a specific race, that's going to pull away from his lifestyle

2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:55.600
 so much to focus on that. Luckily for him, he's actually a great athlete. Like it's,

2:07:55.600 --> 2:07:59.840
 it's under that layer of fat. Yeah. So people who are not familiar, Bert

2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:07.440
 Crash is a comedian who takes off his shirt often has, he's a elegant layer of fat around him.

2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:12.640
 He's also a party animal. So he's a weird balance of like healthy and unhealthy.

2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:19.760
 So he drinks a lot during, I think there's some debate about that, but certainly after

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:26.240
 his, his performances, but at the same time he's into kind of the running thing. And he does quite

2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:31.600
 a bit of treadmill running, I think. So, and like I said, has this challenge of running 2000 miles

2:08:31.600 --> 2:08:38.000
 this year. So it's fascinating to have somebody who so fully embraces life and the full joys of

2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:43.520
 life as represented by the huge amounts of drinking and partying and just being a wild man,

2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.480
 but also at the same time, like being at least curious about this challenging yourself in the

2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:55.840
 physical realm. It's kind of fascinating. It reminds me of one of my favorite comedians,

2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:02.800
 like Eddie Isard, who's been doing those challenges basically off the couch, just running a marathon,

2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:10.240
 a day kind of thing. It's fascinating to see the purity of those challenges when like exercise

2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:16.320
 hasn't necessarily been deeply ingrained in your life. And you kind of just embrace the challenge

2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:20.960
 anyway and take it on. And that's another way of looking at it. Because we've been talking about

2:09:20.960 --> 2:09:28.880
 running as a performance like optimization thing where training is such a huge part of this process.

2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:34.080
 Like race day is just the cherry on top. But there's for some people where the race is the cake.

2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:40.240
 It's like they just take it on as a pure challenge. As the thing you haven't really

2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:44.400
 trained for is the thing you haven't, you don't understand the intricacies of, but you take it

2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:49.520
 on anyway. And that reveals something about the human spirit as well. Yeah. And there's definitely

2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:53.920
 like a switch that flips when you in your mind decide, I'm going to do this, where then all

2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:57.680
 of a sudden it goes from like, you stop thinking about, oh, that's not possible. So like, well,

2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:02.160
 I'm just going to do it. And I think Bert highlights that perfectly in a lot of cases where like,

2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:06.320
 he's, he's maybe not even thinking it through enough to get to the point where it's like,

2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:09.680
 he gets the point where he thinks this is not possible, where most people would look at it

2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:14.080
 and think, huh, I don't know if I can actually physically accomplish that task. Bert's just like,

2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:18.400
 oh yeah, I'm going to do it. And my, my thing thought with Bert was the 2000 mile thing is

2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:22.720
 we're, are we going to find him at the end of the year with like 36 hours to go on 100 miles?

2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:28.720
 And that's right. That's right. That's what's going to happen. And it's going to be hilarious.

2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:35.920
 So speaking of things that are insane and like taking on challenges that don't seem like you

2:10:35.920 --> 2:10:44.480
 didn't, you didn't think through, you're thinking about running across the country in, in a challenge

2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:49.760
 you call the transcontinental run. Can you describe this challenge and what the heck you're thinking?

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:54.880
 Yeah. Yeah. So this is, uh, you know, one thing that is exciting about ultramarathons,

2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:58.960
 I think in a lot of places, especially early in someone's ultramarathon adventure, if they

2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:03.920
 decide to do that as a, you know, part of their life is you have like these early years where

2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:09.360
 you're doing things for the first time. And it's like so cool and scary at the same time to think

2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:13.280
 today I'm going to run 100 miles and the furthest I've ever run before is 50 or something like

2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:16.400
 that. And you just know you're going to do something that you've never done before. You're

2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:21.680
 going to experience things you would have never been able to predict. And it's like this really

2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:27.120
 interesting, unique like human experience, I think. So for me, I've spent most of my career at this

2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:31.440
 point like doing, I got through that phase in a lot of the events I'm really interested in.

2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:35.520
 And then it was like, now let's repeat it and see if we can do it better. And you get into that

2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:41.680
 mindset for a while, which is also a fun mindset. But there is that kind of like, uh, desire to

2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:46.880
 kind of have that human experience again of like, you know, not knowing what could happen or is this

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:51.040
 doable type of a thing, but still doing it and figuring it out along the way. So I would describe

2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:55.280
 the transcontinental project as something like that. It's not anything unique to me or anything new.

2:11:55.280 --> 2:11:59.200
 There's been a lot of people who've done it before. But essentially it's a route. There's

2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:03.280
 different routes. There's one kind of main one that's done for like the, that is used as the

2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:08.160
 record route more or less that you go from San Francisco to New York. And essentially you live

2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:12.880
 out of an RV while you're running. So you run as much as you can during the day, then you go to

2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:18.080
 bed at night and then you get up and do it again. And you're, you're handling all the logistics in

2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:23.360
 the process of trying to make sure you can get up the next day and do again, which did the day

2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:28.080
 before, which is going to be the biggest difference. So for me, I've done all single day ultra marathons

2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:34.080
 where you're going to ring yourself dry at knowing the next day or week or however long you need,

2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:37.040
 you're going to be able to just kind of like shut everything down and let them catch back up.

2:12:37.040 --> 2:12:41.600
 Whereas with this, like, you know, you're doing it again and again and again. And, you know,

2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:45.760
 the record is by a guy named Pete Costinick who average just over 72 miles a day, finished in

2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:51.520
 42 days, six hours and 30 minutes. And I mean, just like 72 miles, 73 miles. And then like

2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:56.160
 next day again, next day again, just knowing every day when you finish, you spend a whole day

2:12:56.160 --> 2:12:58.640
 running and then, okay, I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to wake up in the morning. I'm going to

2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:03.120
 have to do this again. And then, you know, have that happen for six weeks. And that's if it goes

2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:08.240
 very well. So luck I assume is a big part of this. Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's just so many

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:12.160
 variables that are uncontrollable on this type of an experience just because I mean, you go over

2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:17.040
 this year as maybe you hit a storm, you know, you try to time it. Most people do it in start

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:21.840
 in September. So you can get over the mountain passes without a big storm coming through.

2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:27.120
 But then also get to the East Coast before it's like the middle of winter. So like September,

2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:31.520
 early September start is kind of ideal. But you can, you know, I mean, Pete was very fortunate

2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:35.280
 from a weather standpoint. I think he made one big mistake. We had a little too aggressive

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.040
 in the beginning had to take a full day off. So he actually averaged from a moving day standpoint

2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:45.360
 closer to 75 miles per day. But yeah, I mean, there's going to be things that I can't prepare for

2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:49.760
 or won't know. It's going to happen. You know, a lot of that will get a lot of the logistical

2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:54.160
 stuff will get leaned on with the crew. So that's, I mean, that's the hardest part right now is just

2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:59.120
 like getting all that put together where it's like, okay, I need to have the RV ready. I need to have

2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:03.040
 all the stuff. I knew we need to have the places figured out where we're going to stop and the

2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:08.240
 people that can, you know, dedicate that much time to an activity like that. You know, there's

2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:11.040
 a lot of moving parts even before you start the adventure itself.

2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:14.000
 When you see you're taking the San Francisco to New York?

2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:14.640
 Yeah.

2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:16.640
 And when are you doing the run?

2:14:16.640 --> 2:14:20.720
 September 1st is when, you know, barring anything like catastrophic between now and then.

2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:24.720
 This is really exciting. But I mean, this is incredible. So you probably have a bunch of

2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:29.280
 people just randomly running with you. Are people going to be tracking where you're located?

2:14:29.280 --> 2:14:33.440
 Yeah. So I'll be documenting everything because I mean, my hope is that I'm doing it primarily to

2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:38.160
 raise awareness for Fight for the Forgotten Justin Reigns charity. But with that said,

2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:44.400
 I think I am capable of if I have a good experience, you know, chasing the record or going after the

2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:49.600
 record or at least getting close to it. So you're going to try to beat this record?

2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:54.720
 Yeah, I'm going to go out with it. I'm going to structure the process in a way that leaves

2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:58.720
 that door open is the way I would describe it. I'm going to try not to do anything that would

2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:04.320
 potentially put it in a situation where that becomes the primary goal just because I want to

2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:08.320
 make sure that the reason I decided to do the first place was for Fight for the Forgotten.

2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:12.720
 So I want to make sure that I don't end up two thirds way across the country with a broken leg

2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:19.600
 and I'm like, hey, guys, I guess the donation button's turned off. So focus on like, don't

2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:27.040
 sacrifice that goal. But also there's a community aspect to it that I feel like, are you going to

2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:32.720
 I mean, so you're going to document and post, but are you going to also,

2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:37.520
 is there a safety perspective here? It's like the Forrest Gump thing. You might have

2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:42.320
 large numbers of crowds that run along with you for a while. Are you worried about that kind of

2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:46.160
 thing? I wouldn't say I'm worried about it. I mean, I think there's probably, there's remote

2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:51.360
 enough spots along the way where you'll get some alone time more likely. I don't necessarily mind

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:56.080
 if people want to jump in, there'll be some people that will definitely want to do that and

2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:00.560
 they can come in. But the reality is like, it's probably not going to be a scenario where there's

2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:07.520
 40 people following me at all times. You say that now. Yeah, you never know. Wait for this podcast.

2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:13.280
 Yeah. And then if Joe finds out you're doing this, then we're really in trouble. All right. So

2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:19.120
 what are the things that you think will be the hardest for you? And also like, how do you train

2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:25.680
 for this kind of thing? And what are the hardest things you anticipate and how do you train for

2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.880
 them? Yeah. So the way I'm looking at this is it's much less about performance from the traditional

2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:37.920
 sense where I need to be able to be ex fit. I think I need to be injury proof. That's what's

2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:43.680
 going to be a detriment. If you think about it, like, if I managed to average nine minute mile

2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:51.520
 pace for a day, that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time frame. So I'll easily have 12 hours

2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:57.760
 of moving time per day. Nine minute pace, I think is slow enough that it's not an unreasonable clip.

2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:02.880
 So like when you, I mean, obviously there's things that slow you down or I'll probably take

2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:06.880
 walking breaks, you know, stopping breaks, you got to stay on top of nutrition. That's the other

2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:10.720
 big thing too. I mean, I'm probably eating like anywhere between 10 to 15,000 calories a day,

2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:14.240
 which is, you know, I can probably count on my hand a couple of occasions where I've eaten that

2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:18.800
 much in my life. So now I got to do that for six plus weeks in a row. And you don't want any,

2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:22.880
 having stomach problem or trying to minimize the amount of stomach problems. So would you

2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:29.040
 estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of running every day? Yeah, that's probably like from the

2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:34.080
 first step to the last step, it'll probably be somewhere around like say 14 hours, 13 hours

2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:38.800
 or something like that would be a pretty good estimate. And then getting rest. And so, and then

2:17:38.800 --> 2:17:44.080
 minimizing the risk of injury, which could be as small as like, like literally uneven services

2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:48.560
 resulting to like stepping the wrong way. I mean, that's going to be a lot of steps.

2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:53.040
 Yeah, yeah. So the probability of injury, are you worried about that kind of stuff?

2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:56.160
 Can you strengthen the ankles or those kinds of things that prevent

2:17:57.040 --> 2:18:00.560
 possibility of injury? And that's where I'm putting a lot of my focus in is,

2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:06.160
 I think like just being running fit is going to be like generally speaking is going to be

2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.080
 important. I'm going to, I think just from a lifetime of running is going to be a huge advantage.

2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:16.960
 A lot of these like kind of like mechanical movements are going to be very established.

2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:21.760
 It's just going to be about, can I tolerate that volume of it? I think that I'm doing more

2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.520
 strength work. I think this is something where it's like, you know, maybe adding five pounds of

2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:29.280
 lower body muscle is going to be an advantage versus a disadvantage when you're looking at

2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:34.720
 power weight ratio, because I just really don't, I never need to be running a 648 mile for this

2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:40.880
 adventure. And so I'm looking at that. I'm doing a lot more of that stuff, focusing on that.

2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:46.480
 The training is changing a fair bit where it's more polarizing versus kind of being,

2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:50.480
 I mean, I've always had some polarization in my training, but this is even to an extreme where

2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:55.920
 like I'm going to do some simulations where, you know, I go out and do two or three days where I

2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:00.560
 target the exact thing I will be doing on the Transcon. You were on Instagram posting about

2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:06.240
 these simulator runs, so you legitimately like trying to perfectly copy what would happen one,

2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:11.520
 two or three day segment on that run. Yeah. Just to kind of start to read out where are the

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:17.680
 potential problems. So let's say I do a two or three day simulation where I'm averaging 70 miles a

2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:23.200
 day, and I find out at the end of three days, there's a really weak spot here. I need to address

2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:26.960
 that or I need to find a way to make that not a weak spot. I think that's the only way to really

2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:31.680
 get as close as you can to avoiding injury. Have you done that yet? Have you done a two day

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:36.160
 Sony mount? Like even that's incredibly difficult. I haven't yet. I'm going to build up to it,

2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:39.040
 because that's the other thing too, is like, I don't think you want to be so aggressive with

2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:45.920
 that where you get injured trying to figure out how not to get injured. So what I'm going to start,

2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:50.960
 what I just started last week is I've, it looks really weird on my training schedule,

2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:55.040
 because like last week I ran almost 150 miles, but I took two days off. So it's like,

2:19:55.040 --> 2:19:59.280
 usually for me to get to 150 miles, that's a seven day training week. So that's the way I'm

2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:05.920
 doing it. Like I did, I did a day where I did, you know, two, like just over 20 milers separated

2:20:05.920 --> 2:20:10.320
 with by just a couple hours. And within that couple hours, I did like a three mile walk.

2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:14.640
 The following morning I woke up and ran, I think it was like just over 36 miles first thing in

2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:18.560
 the morning. Just to get an idea of just like, kind of like, what does it like to be, I mean,

2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:21.680
 this was in Phoenix too, so it was 100 degrees for the majority of that.

2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:25.920
 So to suffer, then rest, suffer again, how that feels.

2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:30.080
 There's enough precedent with this sort of an activity where like everyone I've talked to so

2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:35.120
 far has told me like there is going to be like this kind of like gradual decline in the early

2:20:35.120 --> 2:20:38.080
 stages where you're just like, okay, it's getting worse, it's getting worse, it's getting worse.

2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:43.200
 And you hit a point where you're just like, it hits kind of rock bottom. And then like,

2:20:43.200 --> 2:20:48.880
 it starts to kind of gradually improve. So you kind of have to let yourself get, it's weird. I think

2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:55.120
 I can maybe eliminate, I'm trying to find a way to eliminate some of that by doing the simulations.

2:20:55.120 --> 2:20:59.040
 Whereas I, from what I've seen, I haven't seen a lot of people do the simulation route yet.

2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:03.680
 I've seen people just do like a lot of training and then say like, okay, I'll spend the first

2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:08.880
 seven to 10 days adapting to this, and then I'll get comfortable within this environment and be

2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:13.840
 fine. Whereas I'm going to try to get to a point where like, some of that is already kind of cleared

2:21:13.840 --> 2:21:18.400
 up before I start, but not so much that I'm like adding like an extra essential week to the trip

2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:24.240
 with worth of running. What do you think would be the hardest simulator run leading up to like,

2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:27.280
 will you do three days? Yeah, I think I'll probably try to do three days

2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:31.360
 somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each will be kind of like the goal.

2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:35.840
 Will that be in August? Do you think how close to? Yeah, I would like it to be in August,

2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:39.040
 like early August would be ideal. I think like maybe the first week in August,

2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:41.920
 because that gives me kind of three weeks to let things kind of settle down from that.

2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:46.480
 But then it's crazy. This is incredible. It's actually interesting because like,

2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:52.080
 if I did, let's say I did the simulation now, the problem with that is like the adaptations

2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:56.160
 from just like the breakdown and the strengthening would likely be gone unless I did it again.

2:21:56.160 --> 2:22:02.800
 So I want to inch up to it so that like, and get close enough to the starting date so that I'm

2:22:02.800 --> 2:22:08.160
 still kind of like, you know, holding on to that adaptation when I started. So then those first

2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:14.000
 few days maybe aren't quite as miserable. And you said, if everything goes amazing and you're

2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:18.560
 challenging the record, it'll be like a 42 day run. Yeah. So that's what the record is almost

2:22:18.560 --> 2:22:23.520
 exactly six weeks. And that's at 72 and a half miles per day. So will you be posting online?

2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:28.960
 And yeah, Instagram is going to be a big one. I think I might do a few like YouTube stuff along

2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:35.440
 the way too. Yeah, I'm still iron out exactly how much I think at minimum I'll do. I'll do

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:38.800
 some Instagram stuff. I think I'll go live on Instagram a few times during the day when I

2:22:38.800 --> 2:22:44.240
 take like walking breaks, partly just to kind of, I think keeping people and I mean, it stays true

2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:51.760
 to the goal of raising awareness, but it also I find when you bring people in, there is an added

2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:56.800
 pressure to that. But there's also this sense that I've learned from the treadmill experience

2:22:56.800 --> 2:23:01.520
 since we had like a pretty big production for that in the sense that as much as you can turn on a

2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:07.440
 camera in your own house, but like the, I remember thinking we had like 30 people lined up to come

2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:11.840
 in and guest speak during that. And there's points of that where I was like, you know,

2:23:11.840 --> 2:23:14.880
 you get that voice we talked about at the beginning where it's like, you know, maybe you

2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:18.560
 could quit. Like, do you really need to run 100 miles on a treadmill? Is this really going to be

2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:23.200
 valuable for you? And then you think about, Oh, you know what, there's, you know, Courtney DeWalter,

2:23:23.200 --> 2:23:29.120
 one of the best female ultra runners to ever exist is taken in the 30 minutes to an hour out of her

2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:36.240
 day to come on in two hours to, you know, help me, you know, amplify this event. And do I really

2:23:36.240 --> 2:23:39.920
 want to be sending emails out to these people saying, Hey guys, I know you were gracious enough to

2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:43.280
 block out time of your day. You know, I think there's a little bit of that to do where you're

2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:47.200
 like, you're, you're, you're jumping in with the community that is following along and saying,

2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:50.480
 here's how things are going, show them the best, the worst and everything between.

2:23:51.040 --> 2:23:54.000
 And then ultimately have that hold you accountable a little bit too. It's like,

2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:55.920
 harder to get up in the morning and not go back out.

2:23:55.920 --> 2:24:01.040
 I don't know how you are, but I had to, uh, whenever I did any kind of physical stuff,

2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:06.640
 like the 48 hour challenge or just any kind of running, I hated turning on the camera.

2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:11.680
 I hated it. Like, because you have to like smile and be friendly and stuff.

2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:14.320
 Oh, I'm just going to be super miserable if I'm miserable.

2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:19.440
 Well, that's it. So like, exactly. I, in some sense, that's what people.

2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:22.720
 Are we going to get a happy Zach or an angry Zach?

2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:27.120
 Exactly. It's like you're making bets. And I'm sure there'll be some days,

2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:32.400
 maybe not many, maybe very few, where you're truly happy with yourself.

2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:38.800
 Like for some weird ecstatic reason, maybe if you get over the hump, whatever that you mentioned

2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:44.640
 that this dip, I mean, it's, it's fascinating how many, how much suffering this actually entails.

2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:45.440
 I wonder.

2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:49.520
 Well, and one thing I'm going to definitely try to leverage to my advantage,

2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:54.320
 and one of the reasons why I think fight for the forgotten was the charity that really triggered me

2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:59.200
 to decide to do this. The transcontinental route was something I learned about early

2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:02.160
 in my ultra running career. And I thought to myself, I want to do that someday.

2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:05.440
 But it was one of those kind of far off distance things that it never really like

2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:09.920
 actualizing your mind until you put a date down or, you know, mention it on the Joe Rogan experience

2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:13.920
 or something like that. And then it, then it's like people want to know, when is this happening?

2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:21.120
 And, you know, what, what I try to think about is, you know, the reason Justin identified the

2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:27.040
 pygmy tribe was because they were super forgotten where, you know, we think about just like some

2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:32.800
 of these third world countries where it's a scenario of like some people, it's easy for us

2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:36.960
 here in the US to think to ourselves, well, why don't they just industrialize? Why don't they just

2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:41.920
 like, you know, start to innovate a bit? Why are they so primitive? What's wrong with them?

2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:46.640
 And in reality, like when you take, when you scale things down to the degree where

2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:53.200
 you need the entire day because of the situation you're in, just to take care of your basic needs

2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:59.280
 of water and food, you never get the opportunity to even build a real like establishment or,

2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:04.160
 you know, build on that. Like you need, you need the free time or you need a portion of your

2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:09.200
 population to have the free time available to innovate. And the pygmy tribe just hadn't had

2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:12.960
 that historically. In fact, they weren't even considered humans by like the local government

2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:17.200
 for quite some time. And, you know, the people that really pay the price in some of these situations

2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:21.200
 are the women because they're the ones that get saddled with like the water gathering and things

2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:25.920
 like that. So the reason that Justin picked wells to build was because he thought to himself,

2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:31.680
 if we can get them wells, then now these women don't spend all day walking and carrying water.

2:26:31.680 --> 2:26:35.840
 Now they can just get that water. And now we have half the population freed up for other things.

2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:40.400
 Now maybe they can start farms. They can build some housing and stuff like that. And it just,

2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:44.880
 it exponentially improves once you take care of some of those big key early things.

2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:49.680
 So when I'm thinking about like, you know, do I really need to go out here and

2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:53.840
 travel another 12 hours a day? My mind is going to hopefully go to, well, if one of those women

2:26:53.840 --> 2:26:57.600
 woke up in the pygmy tribe, one morning decided, you know what, do I really need to go get water

2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:01.600
 today? It's like, well, yeah, you do. You really do have to. Yeah, you're running for that.

2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:08.080
 Yeah. And that will give you fuel, hopefully. But yeah, I mean, the reality is always there

2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:13.520
 where I don't have to do it. Like they do have to do it. So, you know, but I think just keeping

2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:20.960
 that perspective, it puts us back to the beginning where it's, this is one of those situations where

2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:27.280
 I think it's like a no quit situation. You have to put yourself in a no quit situation here because

2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:33.440
 it's, you know, it's just bigger than you. I can't wait to see like the dark places you go.

2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:39.440
 I mean, there's some, yeah, the quit situations. And hopefully we get to have a glimpse of those

2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:45.280
 because I think those are really inspiring when somebody is both gets broken by them because

2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:50.160
 you know how tough you are, but also is almost broken and overcomes it. I mean, that's just

2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:54.400
 fascinating stories. I can't wait. I know, does Joe know you're doing this, by the way?

2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:59.520
 Yeah, I sent him a note a while back because he was the first spot I mentioned it on. So,

2:27:59.520 --> 2:28:03.200
 I think he knows. I'm not sure if he's following about the exact starting date or not.

2:28:03.200 --> 2:28:10.240
 He will know. This is great. You'll probably think you're a crazy MF for doing this, but

2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:15.280
 I think you'll love it. And I think I love it. And I think the world will love it.

2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:20.880
 A ridiculous question. Who's the greatest endurance runner or endurance athlete of all time?

2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:29.120
 Oh, that's a good question. I think I'd probably go maybe two directions here.

2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:42.160
 I think, uh, Heli Geberlasi is one of the best, in my opinion, because just, I mean, 27 world

2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:48.320
 records, like not all the different distance, but like breaking and rebreaking and that sort of stuff.

2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:57.440
 I mean, he ran two, what was it, 20359 before the shoe technology came in that is estimated

2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:01.280
 at anywhere between a two to 8% performance advantage. I talked about a two hour marathon,

2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:06.800
 two, zero, three, two hour, three minutes. Yeah. So, he did that with the old shoe technology,

2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:13.440
 which essentially dates back to anything. If you were a Nike athlete, it could date back to as early

2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:19.600
 as, I think early 2016 is when the first prototype started showing up. So, if you were before that

2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:22.960
 in your career, you were using, you're guaranteed to be using the old shoe technology.

2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:30.320
 And I mean, just the range of it too. And yeah, it's hard. I mean, there's, it's a...

2:29:30.320 --> 2:29:34.160
 Is he a marathon runner purely? No, he did everything. That's why I picked him, I think,

2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:38.400
 because he went everywhere, everything from the 800 and is like at a national level.

2:29:38.400 --> 2:29:42.960
 800? Yeah. At a national level. I don't, he wasn't competing at like Olympics or anything

2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:50.400
 in the 800, but he was mostly like 5K to marathon. Yeah. Yeah. So, just incredible. I mean,

2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:54.720
 I could go a totally different direction too. I think like Steve Prefontaine stands out in,

2:29:54.720 --> 2:29:59.440
 as an American runner, just because if you look at it outside of just like performances

2:29:59.440 --> 2:30:09.040
 and stuff like that, I think he based, like you can't find an American male runner who

2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:14.720
 probably didn't get some motivation or some catalyst into their running journey from a

2:30:14.720 --> 2:30:19.760
 Prefontaine story or... What would you say is inspiring about Prefontaine? Like from the philosophy,

2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:25.200
 from the technique, from his story? I think there's a few things. I mean, there's a lot of things,

2:30:25.200 --> 2:30:30.560
 which is why he is who he is. It's a... One was just his attitude about it, where he wasn't like

2:30:30.560 --> 2:30:37.120
 this picture ask runner. I mean, he was obviously talented, but you have the perfect story of like

2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:42.720
 he wanted to be good at something. Like most American kids tried football. No hard work was

2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:48.400
 going to get Prefontaine starting in varsity for football. Starts running, fell in love with a mile.

2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:53.200
 His college coach told him, no, you're not going to be a miler, you're going to be a 5K guy,

2:30:53.200 --> 2:31:00.080
 and he popularized the 5K in the United States or three mile in some cases. And I mean, the way he

2:31:00.080 --> 2:31:05.440
 would race, I think, is what really made him interesting for folks, where he was just like

2:31:05.440 --> 2:31:11.040
 all guts runner, where he's like... I mean, one of his famous quotes was like, if you beat me,

2:31:11.040 --> 2:31:14.720
 you're going to have to bleed to do it because he's going to be in all guts race and in a sport

2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:19.200
 where it gets very tactical at times, especially at the national, or I shouldn't say national,

2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:24.480
 but at the like competition level, the championship level, where it's like kind of more of a sit and

2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:28.000
 kick approach a lot of times where everyone's kind of waiting for someone to make a move,

2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:32.400
 like Pre was going to make a move really early. Yeah. So this idea of leading from the front,

2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:39.600
 which I guess is tactically really a bad idea. Well, from a running a PR standpoint,

2:31:39.600 --> 2:31:45.520
 it's a bad idea in most cases. But so race, I guess, is not just about the PR.

2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:49.920
 What's about winning in a lot of cases, and that's what he thought was going to put him in

2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:53.360
 the best advantage to win, I think. It's just to run from the front. I mean, what do you...

2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:58.800
 Because you mentioned this, the 100 mile, you ran, you were in second place, and then in 90s,

2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:05.120
 you were able to get to the first place. How hard is it to run when you're in first place?

2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:10.240
 You know, I think this is really different. Some people thrive under it, where it's like for them,

2:32:10.800 --> 2:32:14.640
 like I talked about Jim Walms before, I think he loves being in the front. If he's in the front,

2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:18.880
 he loves it. That's where he's excited. That's where he knows he's doing what he's doing,

2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:23.360
 where he's pushing his limits and things like that. Pre was probably the same way.

2:32:23.360 --> 2:32:26.880
 And then I think there's other folks who are much more comfortable kind of saying,

2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:31.440
 let's let things settle down here a little bit, and then I'll make my move when it's time to make

2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:36.960
 my move. Or they think of it as... And this is a very important, I think lesson for the average

2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:42.080
 ultra runner is just like knowing what you're capable of is going to be an important piece

2:32:42.080 --> 2:32:49.440
 to the puzzle because you can try to say, I want to run faster than I'm capable of

2:32:50.080 --> 2:32:53.840
 in an early part of a 100 miler, but then you're going to pay for it at the end.

2:32:53.840 --> 2:32:57.440
 So really, unless you're trying to go for the win and that's a tactic that you think is going to

2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:02.000
 produce a win versus trying to run your fastest time, you got to run within yourself, within your

2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:06.320
 parameters. Obviously, there's a big question about where those parameters are in a lot of cases,

2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:10.400
 which makes ultramarathon even more interesting because it's like, there's so much unknown about

2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:13.440
 it. It's like, well, maybe you can go faster and we just don't know yet.

2:33:13.440 --> 2:33:17.760
 So there's in the face of that uncertainty, there's something admirable like it was with

2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:25.280
 prefrontain where you take the risk and run faster than you think you might be able to run

2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:31.040
 in terms of pace that you can hold. So push the pace that's possible.

2:33:31.040 --> 2:33:37.120
 Yeah. Explore the unknown. It's like a pioneer spirit, right? Next frontier kind of a thing.

2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:41.520
 But I mean, prefrontain also, there's other angles with him too, where he was like in the

2:33:41.520 --> 2:33:46.320
 amateur era where to be an Olympian, you couldn't be pro. So he's turning down, I mean, the guy was

2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:51.440
 on food stamps and living in a trailer because he wanted to run at the Olympics. And there was a lot

2:33:51.440 --> 2:33:55.920
 of like politics involved with not being able to take sponsorship money and things like that,

2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:01.520
 which has changed since then. But so he was huge in the movement for that to kind of like,

2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:07.840
 you know, have a situation where now, as an athlete, you can finish, in most cases, finish

2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:12.800
 college, sign a big contract with, you know, a sponsor, and then also still compete in the

2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:16.640
 Olympic games and go to the events that are actually ones that are going to likely catapult

2:34:16.640 --> 2:34:20.960
 your career in most of the Olympic distance endurance events. So he just revolutionized

2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:25.200
 the sport. And then to add even more flavor to the whole thing, I mean, he died a very premature

2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:31.760
 death. He got a car accident and died before he would have likely probably meddled at the Olympics.

2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:34.560
 So he and there is a tragedy that he didn't.

2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:41.280
 Yeah, well, he was fourth place at the Olympics, the prior his first go of it. And it was kind of

2:34:41.280 --> 2:34:44.640
 one of those things where it's like fourth place at the Olympics is the first man looking out of

2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:49.200
 the first woman looking out. And for a guy that had as much hype as him, I think like a medal was

2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:54.320
 something he really wanted to take home with him there. And especially how that race went. I mean,

2:34:54.320 --> 2:34:58.480
 yeah, I don't know, it's, it's, it's tragic the whole thing. But that's one of the things that

2:34:58.480 --> 2:35:04.560
 makes Olympics amazing is the tragedy of it. Like one race decides the story of a lifetime,

2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:10.480
 which is like, yeah, that's why it's, that's why it's amazing. Even if a lot of people get hurt

2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:19.680
 because of it. Tragedy makes the, the triumph special. Right. Yeah. I mean, it makes life

2:35:19.680 --> 2:35:24.320
 like a movie almost. Exactly. You know, if everything's all sunshine and rainbows, and it's not as

2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:28.560
 entertaining to watch, there's no adversity to overcome. You mentioned shoe technology.

2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:34.720
 How much has shoe technology advanced through the past few decades? How much has it changed

2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:40.880
 running generally, but also running like ultra marathon running? I would say in ultra running,

2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:47.680
 it's had much of a less of an impact because ultra running is still heavily skewed towards the

2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:53.280
 trails. So the technology, at least from what we know, isn't necessarily translating over to these

2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:57.280
 like massive, varied terrain, certainly not the technical terrain and things like that.

2:35:57.280 --> 2:36:02.640
 Now on road races, flat stuff, like the track stuff, the roads, the run, I guess you, a runnable

2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:07.760
 trail where it's just like basically crushed limestone, more or less. You definitely get an

2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:14.560
 advantage from it. It's, and essentially what, what happened is in, this probably dated back

2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:21.760
 actually before 2015, you know, Nike decided, well, their, their, their development team

2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:26.960
 was ahead of the curve. They developed this new foam, they call it like a Peabock foam,

2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:32.160
 and they, they realized that like when you step down into a shoe, the reason like

2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:37.280
 racers a lot of times would wear these flats because they're trying to take out any of that

2:36:37.280 --> 2:36:43.600
 lost energy into the foam in the shoe. Well, this foam that Nike came out with is so good that it

2:36:43.600 --> 2:36:49.120
 actually returns way more energy than the average foam did to the point where like when they test

2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:52.560
 these things on like force plate treadmills and things like that, it's like a, depending on the

2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:57.360
 person's gate and some of the things is like a two to 8% improvement in performance. I mean,

2:36:57.360 --> 2:37:02.560
 we've seen records just across the board get broken since this came out. All distances.

2:37:02.560 --> 2:37:08.800
 Basically, yeah. Yeah. I think from, at least from the 5k up through the marathon, and I mean,

2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:14.080
 we've seen some insane improvements in the marathon. I think like the women's marathon

2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:20.640
 went from what was considered a relatively untouchable like 216 to a 214. And I mean,

2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:26.640
 like it was like 218 was like just world class. Like if you could run a 218 marathon as a woman,

2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:30.640
 that was like, I mean, it still is to a degree, but then, you know, now you have someone run a 214.

2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:35.120
 Like that's a huge. And you attributed a lot of that to the, the shoe. Yeah.

2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:38.960
 Yeah. I think there's probably other things that come in mind too. Like now that people

2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:43.120
 know there's a performance advantage from a mechanical standpoint, it's also a confidence

2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:47.360
 thing where it's like, oh, now I can probably try going five seconds per mile faster and maybe

2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:50.880
 they could have anyway and they just now they think they can. So they are. So there's probably a

2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:55.120
 little bit of that that's just adding to it. Do you think there's a lot of extra innovation

2:37:55.120 --> 2:38:01.120
 that's still possible? Like what if you could do this kind of big leap with a little innovation

2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:05.440
 of foam? Is there other stuff that you can do or further innovation of materials that make up the

2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:11.280
 foam? Yeah. So they can definitely go much more advantage. They put a cap on it essentially. So

2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:15.360
 there was a, there's also a carbon plate element to this too, where they put like this carbon

2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:21.440
 plate in there in between the foam. So like, I believe when, when Kipchagi broke, well, when

2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:28.320
 they did that, that kind of the sub two hour project, he actually had on a shoe, if I'm not

2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:34.240
 mistaken, that never got to market because they put down some parameters on it after before it,

2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:38.800
 that one came to market where it was actually like stacked up to, I can't remember how many

2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:42.080
 millimeters, it was an insane amount. And then they had like, I think maybe even three layer

2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:46.080
 plates in there. And those are Nike shoe here as well. Yeah. Yeah. So what makes it kind of

2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:52.320
 controversial or difficult is Nike came out with these prototypes. So prototype for people

2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:55.840
 don't understand shoes, like these, these companies, they'll develop a shoe and it usually takes

2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:02.160
 like somewhere in the neighborhood of like probably 18 months to hit the market. So if you're like,

2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:06.080
 if sponsored athlete or work for the company, you can get your hands on these shoes before

2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:11.120
 they actually come to market. So we had an issue, I think this wasn't necessarily as big of an issue

2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:16.240
 in the ultra running community, but in the track and field, Olympic distance stuff was a big issue

2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:21.440
 because you had Nike athletes having these prototype shoes before anyone could get them.

2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:24.800
 And then you had athletes who were sponsored by these other brands who couldn't wear them,

2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:30.000
 even if, even when they did come to market. So then we had this like chase to catch up where

2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:34.800
 other companies are starting to make their own version of it. And now we're getting to a point

2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:41.600
 where most companies have a version of that shoe. But we had a huge transition phase

2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:46.880
 that impacted the Olympics big time. I mean, think of here, here's a, here's an example of it.

2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:53.920
 There was a, there was an athlete Kara Goucher. She was not, she wasn't like the athlete, wasn't

2:39:54.960 --> 2:40:01.360
 when they came out with this shoe. And she ran the Olympic trial marathon and got fourth place,

2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:07.280
 the first person out. And two of the people had ever had that shoe on. And she was maybe a minute

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:11.360
 or two, I'd have to look to see exactly, but it was within the performance advantage range.

2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:16.880
 And so you could argue that she was the first person in modern running to lose an Olympic spot

2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:22.000
 due to a technological disadvantage. Wow. And, and it's like, I mean, it's one of those.

2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:28.080
 It's kind of profound. Yeah. I mean, it's one of those things where like it's, it's a transition,

2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:31.280
 right? So there's going to be bumpy road and there's going to be people that get caught in

2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:37.200
 that transition that it's unfortunate for. But it's also like, you know, once everything

2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:41.840
 does catch up and every shoe company has a version of this, there's still problems. I mean,

2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:45.920
 these are incredibly expensive shoes. It's like a $250 shoe. So it's like, at what point do you

2:40:45.920 --> 2:40:51.920
 tell like a wealthy family with a high school kid that, you know, you can get that $250 shoe,

2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:56.240
 but then you go, this kid's family can barely afford a pair of shoes for them, much less a $250

2:40:56.240 --> 2:41:02.640
 pair of shoes. Like where do we draw that line? And that sort of stuff. Also just, here's the

2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:07.840
 other big one. Like let's, I mean, two to 8% is a massive range. What if you're on the 2% versus

2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:12.560
 someone's on the 8%? You know, chances are if you're, you know, blowing a record out of the water,

2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:16.880
 you're probably closer to that high end percentage versus someone who's maybe getting

2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:21.360
 incremental gains, you're probably closer to that lower end. So is it fair to have a piece of

2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:25.920
 equipment that has that big of a range when we're talking about less than a percent determining

2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:30.400
 these races when all is held constant? Those are fascinating, like philosophical questions that I

2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:36.160
 think it's nice to solve that for the shoe or to raise those questions for a shoe, because the more

2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.720
 complicated place where they will be raised is probably like genetics, genetic engineering,

2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:45.760
 all those kinds of things. Yeah, you'll get a lot more complicated. So it's nice when you have like

2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:50.160
 a particular piece of technology that's just like right there, it's a shoe, we can understand it,

2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:56.160
 we can study it. Right. And we may be coming on the precipice of like human powered sport

2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:02.160
 performance is no longer being something that we like look at as this like pinnacle of like,

2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:08.400
 I don't maybe entertainments the wrong word, but like, is that a pursuit? Do we end up just

2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:11.840
 going a different direction? I mean, I think it's like, it's so hard for us to think about that

2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:16.720
 right now because it's so part of like the culture and the lifestyle of the average person where

2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:23.680
 like sport is a hobby of theirs as well as a passion to follow. And it's like, how complicated

2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:28.400
 does it need to get before people lose that interest? And there could be a future where most

2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:33.280
 of the Olympics is esports. Somebody told me that esports is in the Olympics. I've been meaning

2:42:33.280 --> 2:42:39.120
 to look this up, which is, you know, like what video, so video games are in the Olympics. Yeah.

2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:47.440
 It could be as like a trial that they're doing. Yeah. If this is true, I'm trying to in real time

2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:54.640
 look it up. But if there's esports joining Olympics in 2024, wow. So that could be just a,

2:42:55.600 --> 2:43:00.720
 that could be a fun side thing, but it could be a first step into a complete transformation

2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:04.240
 what sports mean. Yeah. You can control video games better than you control

2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:10.080
 for genetics and humans. Well, and in reality, we've been dealing with this problem in other

2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:14.320
 areas just with the performance enhancing side of things with drugs and all that stuff too. And

2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:19.040
 anyway, that conversations flared back up with track and field too, where we are seeing a lot

2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:23.600
 of records get broken. A lot of it probably is to shoot technology, but, you know, in 2020 with

2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:28.320
 the COVID stuff, you have all these out of competition testing protocols that a lot of these

2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:34.960
 top tier Olympic athletes are getting to try to eliminate. Like if you just do intercompetition

2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:40.080
 testing, like there's potential for people to do things that are going to give them a

2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:44.960
 performance advantage, but not going to show up on that test on the day of or after their race,

2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:49.680
 where now you have these like limitations of being able to test. So do we have like a group

2:43:49.680 --> 2:43:54.400
 of athletes now who decide, oh, I'm not going to get tested in 2020, do the COVID restrictions?

2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:58.320
 This is the time to dope up and then, you know, hit some stride and some records and then,

2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:01.920
 you know, taper back off when they get this thing fired back up again. And so there may be

2:44:01.920 --> 2:44:05.520
 some of that as well. And I mean, that's always been an ongoing problem. And that's where the

2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:09.440
 boost you get from performance enhancing drugs could be tiny relative to the stuff we have in

2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:16.080
 the future. Right. Yeah. So you might be the last generation of like natural unmodified humans

2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:22.000
 that were running. And who knows, maybe that's already over. Who knows who's who's modified.

2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:27.920
 That's that's true. You might, we might be living through that transition to the new Nike shoe,

2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:34.320
 but broadly defined. Yeah. Yeah. So you'll be in some sense in the history books as

2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:40.960
 humans used to run without any modifications. Used to destroy their body and let it recover

2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:47.600
 and then do it again. And they used to be impressed with a within 11 hour, 100 mile

2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:54.720
 time when we could do it in under an hour now. Yeah. Yeah. So, but nevertheless, it is incredible.

2:44:54.720 --> 2:45:02.960
 The four mile, the four minute miles incredibly impressive. I really love the 11 hour mark

2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:10.400
 for the 100 miler and the two hour marathon by most people for the longest time was thought to be

2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:15.760
 impossible. You know, there's still people that think it's impossible with under certain constraints.

2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:26.480
 So, Elliot Kupchogi of Kenya, as you mentioned, ran a one hour 59 minute 40 second marathon,

2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:33.760
 but he had, like you said, the prototype shoes and he had the pace setters. Yeah. I don't know

2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:38.880
 how essential that is, but it seems quite essential. Do you think it's possible? First of all,

2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:44.160
 what do you think about that accomplishment? And he is one of the greatest, if not the greatest

2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:48.320
 marathon runners of all time. What do you think about that accomplishment? And do you think it's

2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:54.000
 possible to run a two hour marathon without any assistance? Yeah. I mean, I think there's no

2:45:54.000 --> 2:46:01.360
 question about it, regardless of technology, he's world class, if not the best. I think

2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:10.000
 he could go under two hour, someone equivalent to him could go under two hours with the shoe

2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:17.600
 technology. Probably, what it will take is it'll take a fast course, a course that has very few

2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:23.680
 tangents because turning on a course, they estimate it adds about a percent to the distance.

2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:28.560
 So, when we're talking about a marathon, you're getting up to like a quarter mile extra running,

2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:33.760
 that alone could potentially put you down near too flat based on what we're seeing because,

2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:41.360
 I mean, Kipchegi's got a, was it 20140, I believe, is his actual world record where it's actually

2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:47.840
 like certified. So, I mean, he's right on the door knocking on the door there. Yeah, the prototype

2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:52.720
 he had, since then they put in a regulation where you can't stack a shoe for the roads more than 40

2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:57.040
 millimeters. So, you can only have so much of that energy returning foam and you can only have,

2:46:57.040 --> 2:47:02.880
 I think, one carbon plate in there now. So, that puts a little bit of a ceiling on that

2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:09.520
 technological thing. But who knows what else will come out in that. And to be honest, who comes out

2:47:09.520 --> 2:47:14.720
 with it? Because the fact that Nike came out with this technology is the reason why it's being

2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:19.600
 allowed to be used, if it would have been like another running company that came out with it.

2:47:19.600 --> 2:47:24.080
 I'm sure the regulations would have been slapped down on it immediately and they would have probably

2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:29.920
 just thrown it out altogether would have been. Yeah, oh yeah. Well, I mean, it's, you can go,

2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:37.680
 you can go super negative with that and say like, hey, this is terrible or this is like

2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:44.000
 super nefarious. When in reality, it's like, you have a company that has billions of dollars

2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:48.160
 and is interested enough into the sport that otherwise doesn't generate a ton of revenue

2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:54.560
 to, you know, pick up a big tab and support like, you know, track and field and things like that.

2:47:54.560 --> 2:48:00.560
 But, you know, with that, you know, if you want to be the guy who says, yeah, thanks for the

2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:05.840
 millions and millions of dollars, but we're going to, all those years and money you spent on that

2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:10.400
 foam, you wasted it, we're not going to let you use it. But, you know, if you're another company who,

2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:16.400
 you know, revolutionized the sport in potentially a negative way, you know, maybe,

2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:20.800
 maybe you say no to them. So, it gets interesting. That's the way. That's how it always happens.

2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:25.200
 Yeah, yeah. There's really no way around. I think Phil Mephaton, I think it's him that he wrote a

2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:29.600
 book about a two hour marathon. What are the limits? How fast could we run? And I think he puts it

2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:34.320
 like an hour and 42 minutes, something like that, or 40 something minutes. It's kind of an interesting

2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:40.960
 question of what are the limits? Do you think, do you think we'll just keep pushing the limits of

2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:48.640
 what humans are capable of in the ultras, in the marathon? Is this just like the way of sport?

2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:55.200
 I think ultra for sure, because that is a fastly growing sport. And it's, there's

2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:04.560
 a lot of potential for a much bigger pool of talent to pull from that could really push the

2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:09.360
 needle down on some of these performances and things like that, especially as it becomes more

2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:14.880
 popular. If people start realizing, or I shouldn't say realizing, but if a scenario happens where

2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:18.720
 like, oh, I'm one of the best endurance athletes in the world, I make more money running ultra

2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:22.720
 marathons than I do running the marathon. Then, you know, all of a sudden we see every record

2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:29.440
 get broken in the matter of a couple of years. But the, for the marathon, I mean,

2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:35.920
 it's going to get faster, I think, but like to what degree is so hard to know. It's very hard to

2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:41.120
 know and the one hour and 40 minutes seems like that's pretty fast. That's very fast. I mean,

2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:46.480
 folks, for some perspective, they're the current world record is like in the four forties per

2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:51.840
 mile per mile. Like just to add a little flavor to that basically sprinting. Yeah. I mean, go out to

2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:59.360
 a track and run one lap as fast as you can. And then reflect on what time you get and realize

2:49:59.360 --> 2:50:07.440
 like the world record for the marathon is that is that lap at just over 70 seconds per lap.

2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:14.560
 So minute and 10, just over that, but you're doing it 26.2 miles. So over a hundred times,

2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:19.680
 it's mind boggling. But watching Elliot Chogie just first of all, he was like smiling at the end

2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:26.480
 of it. So the there's an extreme efficiency here too. So he's not, he's able to just find the right

2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:33.440
 way to maximize efficiency. It makes it look easy. I mean, that's true for basically every

2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:40.400
 Olympic athlete. When you watch gymnasts, they kind of make it look easy. But there's like tens,

2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:44.720
 if not hundreds of thousands of hours behind that training. Yeah. Just to be comfortable

2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:48.000
 enough to even attempt some of the moves they do in gymnastics is mind boggling.

2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:53.440
 Well, that one is super awesome because how tragic it is like one little slip up

2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:59.600
 four years of work and you're it's all gone. Not just four years of work for many of them.

2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:05.600
 A lifetime of work and their teenagers and their teenagers and the gay dedicated everything

2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:11.920
 to it. That's that's what makes the pursuits of humans so fascinating. We kind of talked about

2:51:11.920 --> 2:51:16.960
 this a little bit already. But is there something that stands out to you as one of the hardest

2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:23.040
 things you've had to overcome in all the either training or the competing that you've done? Has

2:51:23.040 --> 2:51:28.720
 there been moments that kind of stand out where you're proud of yourself that that you were truly

2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:34.960
 tested and you overcame it? I think I'd be more inclined just because it stands out to me much

2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:42.800
 bigger than any one like hard decision or outcome I had from a particular race is just like the

2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:48.240
 trajectory of like, you know, doing what I'm doing now is so much different from what I would have

2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:54.000
 ever expected. You know, I mean, I was a talented enough runner where I could make the state meet

2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:58.480
 by my senior year at a small division three school and, you know, compete at a division

2:51:58.480 --> 2:52:04.480
 three college and be pretty modest talent comparative to my to my peers at the top level

2:52:04.480 --> 2:52:10.160
 division three. To think that like I'd be doing anything that was revolved around running as

2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:16.240
 as an occupation is is I still second guess that that's actually occurring makes me wonder

2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:21.200
 about the whole simulation theory thing. It's like, who's got my joystick and what I do with it?

2:52:23.040 --> 2:52:27.040
 They got G codes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, because I mean, I went to school to be a teacher and I

2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:31.280
 really loved that profession I taught for about five years. And then I got to a point where,

2:52:31.280 --> 2:52:34.800
 you know, some of it's just perfect timing to like the sport gain enough popularity where there's

2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:38.800
 enough money in it where like, I could start a coaching business, I could get sponsorships and

2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:43.120
 things like that, and actually look at it and say financially, I can make a go of this or at least

2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:50.560
 risk it. But there's such a fine line between like deciding to do that or kind of staying comfortable

2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:55.600
 because I mean, I was at the perfect teaching spot for me. I was at this like project based

2:52:55.600 --> 2:53:00.320
 learning school and just outside of Madison, Wisconsin loved it. One of the hardest decision

2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:05.840
 my life to make was to step away from that to pursue running it more holistically. And I mean,

2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:10.640
 I almost didn't I had a co teacher who was I was thinking myself I knew that was like a decision

2:53:10.640 --> 2:53:13.600
 I was gonna have to make the next few years, but it was such an easy decision to say, well,

2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:17.920
 wait one more year. And he was just like, he was a little more of a free spirit than I was

2:53:17.920 --> 2:53:22.160
 certainly at the time he's like, dude, what are you waiting for? Just go. Why are you here?

2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:27.280
 After I told him that he like every time we I'd come into I'd come into school the next day

2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:32.160
 and he'd be like, why are you still here? But I mean, that was there's a tongue in cheek for sure.

2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:36.560
 But it's hard to know that you're going to be successful, right? And that kind of leap given

2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:43.600
 your like, you know, because it's easier when you're like an ultra performer early on. But

2:53:43.600 --> 2:53:48.880
 to have the faith that you can accomplish something. In some regards, it's a blessing in

2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:56.160
 the sense that like, you know, failing would have been fairly predictable. Whereas if like,

2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:00.160
 you know, I always wonder, I mean, I think of these like, especially the big sports like

2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:06.320
 baseball, football and basketball, and you get, you know, guys who guys and girls who are like,

2:54:06.320 --> 2:54:13.440
 identified in like early high school as being the next. And it's like, what kind of pressure is that

2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:18.640
 to think like, well, if I'm not like, literally one of the best players in the NBA in 10 years,

2:54:18.640 --> 2:54:23.920
 I failed. It's just mind boggling to think if I'm not one of the best at one of the most competitive

2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:29.600
 sports on the planet, in what is an athletic, I think an athletic state of an NBA basketball

2:54:29.600 --> 2:54:35.520
 player is probably one of the most athletic human beings on the planet. And to know like in a teenage

2:54:35.520 --> 2:54:41.520
 year that your, your, your success bar is being the best one of the best in the league or the best

2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:46.560
 ever. And that conversations floating around everywhere you look and see versus being able

2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:51.200
 to kind of quietly fail and go back to teaching. It makes it a little more digestible, I think.

2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:55.280
 You have a little bit more freedom to be great, right? Nobody's expecting you to be right.

2:54:55.280 --> 2:55:01.440
 Is there, from that, is there advice you can give to young people today, high schoolers,

2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:07.120
 college students, taking on, trying to figure out their career, trying to figure out their life,

2:55:08.400 --> 2:55:13.680
 advice on how to succeed in either? Yeah, I think, you know, one thing I was always interested

2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:18.560
 when I was teaching was like, you'd have these, you'd have students who had like interests,

2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:22.640
 they had what they were good at. And sometimes those ran in unison with one another,

2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:26.640
 other times they didn't. And it was always interesting to me when you'd have a student who's

2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:31.920
 like, I'm really into like, you know, guitar, or I'm really into skateboarding or something like

2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:37.840
 that where it's like, pretty small like success rate on that avenue versus what you could maybe

2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:43.040
 accomplish by focusing on just something that's a little more standard. And I think like, really,

2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:49.360
 like, besides the likelihood of it becoming something you can turn into a professional or

2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:54.880
 not, you should just ask yourself, like, is this something that I want to spend my free time doing?

2:55:56.160 --> 2:55:59.600
 And because if it is, then you want to keep that in your life, because that's something

2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:03.360
 that's rewarding, motivating, it might be the catalyst that gets you out of bed in the morning

2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:06.880
 and, you know, go to another job in order to go do that thing afterwards. And I think

2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:15.520
 nowadays, we're getting to a point where like, the, your reachability from even a really small,

2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:23.280
 like, unmonetized thing previously is now an option where if like, you live in a city where

2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:26.640
 there's only two other people interested in your topic of area, so you're not going to turn into

2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:31.840
 a job. Now, with the internet, you have the world at your disposal. So that two to three people in

2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:36.160
 every town can turn into thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds and millions of people. And

2:56:36.160 --> 2:56:40.400
 if you really focus your time and energy into that thing, then, you know, who knows where you

2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.240
 can go and how much more enjoyable your life can be if you're able to turn your career into a passion

2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:51.200
 of yours. So I think like, that is something I would tell, tell people, focus on that. See the

2:56:51.200 --> 2:56:58.240
 thing you're good at and you kind of sparks that flame and go with that, even if society doesn't

2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:05.280
 really want you to, like, it's non traditional. And the odds are low of like, traditionally

2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:10.400
 defined success. Just do that thing. I've struggled with that. It's like, it was always clear,

2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:15.600
 especially like in school, there's stuff I'm actually good at and stuff that the world wants

2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:18.880
 me to do. Right. Yeah. And I kept doing that. The world wanted me to be a plumber when I took

2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:24.960
 that test my sophomore year. But even like, like academically, just going to university and

2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:33.040
 academia, there are certain ways, even in, I would say, even in the thing you want to do,

2:57:33.040 --> 2:57:38.080
 the way you do that thing, the world will want you to do it a certain way. And even just like

2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:44.800
 finding your way of doing that thing is really powerful. Like for me, the way I do research,

2:57:45.520 --> 2:57:53.200
 the way I learn is different than colleagues of mine. And I've realized that, that I really like

2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:57.680
 to follow things I'm passionate about versus sort of the rigor of studying every of like the

2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:03.840
 fundamentals all across the board and building up in castle on the fundamentals like layer upon

2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:09.200
 layer. It's just, there's a bunch of details in the way I pursue the very thing that I currently do

2:58:09.200 --> 2:58:13.920
 that's different than others. And it took me quite a long time to accept like, you don't need to do

2:58:13.920 --> 2:58:18.000
 it the way everyone else is doing it. It doesn't, not everyone else, but majority of people are

2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:22.320
 telling you to do it. Because one is beneficial to do it different, because then you'll more

2:58:22.320 --> 2:58:27.440
 likely stand out. And two, like, why the hell are you doing it the way it's not working for you?

2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:33.760
 Yeah. Yeah. You know, I saw that all the time when I was teaching, I was dual certified. I was,

2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:40.000
 my, my certifications were in history and Broadfield social studies. So like econ, psychology,

2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:45.440
 history, all that stuff. And then I also had a certification of special education, which was,

2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:49.680
 you know, people think of special education a lot of times as like, Oh, it's the, you know,

2:58:49.680 --> 2:58:53.200
 the kid who is not smart enough to do the regular thing. When reality, it's like,

2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:58.240
 like, I mean, there is some, you know, there's obviously like, you know, like certain things

2:58:58.240 --> 2:59:03.120
 like Down syndrome and stuff like that. But like, there's also like a huge population of groups of

2:59:03.120 --> 2:59:08.080
 both like gifted and talented on one end of the spectrum where they're incredibly smart.

2:59:08.080 --> 2:59:12.960
 And they're like the geniuses, but for whatever reason, the standard method of learning does

2:59:12.960 --> 2:59:17.360
 not click with them, does not work with them. And then they just need a slightly different path

2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:22.000
 or maybe a drastically different path, and they're going to just flourish. And you have kids that

2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:26.960
 end up falling on the other end where, you know, maybe it's really difficult for them

2:59:26.960 --> 2:59:32.160
 to be able to read at the speed of other students. But if you give them this specific

2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:38.000
 direction, they can just thrive in a certain area. And just seeing that like the, you know,

2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:42.480
 like that there's multiple ways to do stuff. And there's not necessarily one path to the end

2:59:43.200 --> 2:59:46.640
 is I think such an eye opening thing to learn, especially if you learn, maybe that's what I

2:59:46.640 --> 2:59:50.720
 should answer the question that you asked me with is, you know, keep an open mind as to what

2:59:50.720 --> 2:59:56.320
 paths there are forward and know that, you know, maybe just because even if you look to your

2:59:56.320 --> 2:59:58.960
 left, you're just going to write and all your classmates are successful doing it one way,

2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:03.200
 it doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be the way for you. Yeah. So that could land you in

3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:09.920
 eating a meat based diet running across the country. Like the, the incredible madman that

3:00:09.920 --> 3:00:15.200
 you are, Zach, I'm a huge fan, as I told you many times, you're an inspiration to many. I'll be there

3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:19.840
 checking in every day. If you somehow make it out the starting line on September 1st,

3:00:19.840 --> 3:00:24.880
 I know, I know Joe Rogan and millions of others will be as well. So I'm excited to see

3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:27.920
 all the suffering that you're going to go through. I wish you the best of luck. And

3:00:27.920 --> 3:00:31.280
 thank you so much for talking today. I really, really appreciate it. Well, thanks a bunch,

3:00:31.280 --> 3:00:36.480
 Lex. It's been an honor to come on your podcast. I've been a fan of it for, for quite some time.

3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:41.360
 And I thought about wearing a white suit, but Michael Malist already took care of that one.

3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:47.360
 Well, and I think it would be really good for the ratings of this conversation,

3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:52.080
 if you end up dying during that run. So I'll do my best. So the, the, everything that could

3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:56.800
 happen, it'll be positive for, for the world. You're saying I should try to average 100 miles a

3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:02.560
 day. 100 miles. Well, I think you're going to push yourself to, again, it's not the main priority,

3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:07.440
 but it's trying to beat that record. That's probably going to take everything you have. And

3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:11.760
 then that, that's truly inspiring. I wish you the best of luck, man. Thanks a bunch.

3:01:11.760 --> 3:01:17.680
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Zach Bitter. And thank you to Ladder,

3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:23.440
 Bell Campo, Noom, and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:29.680
 And now let me leave you with some words from Steve Prefontein. I'm going to work so that it's

3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:36.560
 a pure Gus race at the end. And if it is, I'm the only one who can win it. Thank you for listening

3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:46.560
 and hope to see you next time.
