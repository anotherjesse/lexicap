00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
 Let me ask you to this question.

00:02.200 --> 00:06.240
 Well, there's bell curve or any research on race differences.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.080
 Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world?

00:13.520 --> 00:16.560
 Can that be used to increase the amount of hate in the world?

00:16.880 --> 00:27.200
 My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism that have

00:27.200 --> 00:33.280
 nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data that speak against that.

00:34.080 --> 00:41.760
 That, no, I don't want to give racist groups of veto power over what scientists study.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.720
 The following is a conversation with Richard Hire on the science of human intelligence.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.520
 This is a highly controversial topic, but a critically important one for understanding

00:53.520 --> 00:59.920
 the human mind. I hope you will join me in not shying away from difficult topics like this,

00:59.920 --> 01:05.520
 and instead, let us try to navigate it with empathy, rigor, and grace.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.800
 If you're watching this on video now, I should mention that I'm recording this introduction

01:11.360 --> 01:16.960
 in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world. I'm safe and happy, and life is beautiful.

01:16.960 --> 01:23.520
 This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description,

01:23.520 --> 01:26.640
 and now, dear friends, here's Richard Hire.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.800
 What are the measures of human intelligence, and how do we measure it?

01:31.520 --> 01:38.720
 Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence. In the vernacular, what I mean

01:38.720 --> 01:45.040
 by intelligence is just being smart. How well you reason, how well you figure things out,

01:45.040 --> 01:52.240
 what you do when you don't know what to do. Those are just kind of everyday common sense

01:53.120 --> 01:58.880
 definitions of how people use the word intelligence. If you want to do research on intelligence,

01:59.600 --> 02:04.720
 measuring something that you can study scientifically is a little trickier,

02:05.920 --> 02:13.520
 and what almost all researchers who study intelligence use is the concept called

02:13.520 --> 02:21.520
 the G factor, general intelligence. That is what is common. That is a mental ability

02:21.520 --> 02:26.000
 that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.160
 What's the origin of the term G factor, by the way? It's such a funny word for such a

02:30.160 --> 02:32.000
 fundamental human thing.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
 The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman, and he noticed, this is like,

02:38.000 --> 02:46.720
 boy, more than 100 years ago, he'd noticed that when you tested people with different tests,

02:47.680 --> 02:56.640
 all the tests were correlated positively. He was looking at student exams and things,

02:57.280 --> 03:05.280
 and he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially. When he used it to look at student

03:05.280 --> 03:11.840
 performance on various topics, he found that all the scores were correlated with each other,

03:11.840 --> 03:18.400
 and they were all positive correlations. He inferred from this that there must be some common

03:18.400 --> 03:23.200
 factor that was irrespective of the content of the test.

03:23.200 --> 03:29.600
 And positive correlation means if you do well on the first test, you're likely to do well in the

03:29.600 --> 03:37.360
 second test, and presumably that holds for tests across even disciplines, so not within

03:37.360 --> 03:44.320
 subject, but across subjects. That's where the general comes in. Something about general

03:44.320 --> 03:48.560
 intelligence. When you were talking about measuring intelligence and trying to figure out

03:49.120 --> 03:53.120
 something difficult about this world and how to solve the puzzles of this world,

03:53.120 --> 03:58.080
 that means generally speaking, not some specific test, but across all tests.

03:58.080 --> 04:04.720
 Absolutely right. And people get hung up on this because they said, well, what about the ability

04:04.720 --> 04:12.320
 to do X? Isn't that independent? And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this, but not

04:12.320 --> 04:19.040
 so good at this. This other thing. And so there are a lot of examples like that, but it's a general

04:19.040 --> 04:27.760
 tendency. So exceptions really don't disprove. Your everyday experience is not the same as

04:27.760 --> 04:33.440
 what the data actually show. And your everyday experience, when you say, oh, I know someone

04:33.440 --> 04:39.120
 who's good at X, but not so good at Y, that doesn't contradict the statement about it.

04:39.120 --> 04:45.680
 He's not so good, but he's not the opposite. It's not a negative correlation.

04:46.400 --> 04:54.960
 Okay. So our anecdotal data, I know a guy is really good at solving some kind of visual thing

04:54.960 --> 05:01.520
 that's not sufficient for us to understand actually the depths of that person's intelligence. So

05:02.160 --> 05:12.880
 how this idea of G factor, how much evidence is there, how strong, given across the decades

05:12.880 --> 05:17.680
 that this idea has been around, how much has it been held up that there is a universal

05:17.680 --> 05:25.600
 sort of horsepower of intelligence that's underneath all of it, all the different tests we do

05:25.600 --> 05:32.800
 to try to get to this thing in the depths of the human mind. That's a universal stable measure

05:32.800 --> 05:37.440
 of a person's intelligence. You use the couple of words in there. Stable.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.640
 We have to be precise with words. I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.

05:42.640 --> 05:48.720
 We can. There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research that is poetic.

05:49.600 --> 05:56.400
 Science has a phonetic aspect to it. Good scientists are very intuitive. They're not just,

05:57.120 --> 06:01.920
 hey, hey, these are the numbers. You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.

06:01.920 --> 06:09.200
 When it comes to intelligence research, you asked, how well has this general concept held up?

06:09.200 --> 06:15.440
 And I think I can say, without fear of being empirically contradicted,

06:16.080 --> 06:22.320
 that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology. Now, some cynics may say, well,

06:22.320 --> 06:26.560
 big deal, psychology. We all know there's a replication crisis in psychology and a lot of

06:26.560 --> 06:32.240
 this stuff doesn't replicate. That's all true. There is no replication crisis when it comes to

06:32.240 --> 06:39.120
 studying the existence of this general factor. Let me tell you some things about it. It is

06:39.120 --> 06:46.080
 it. It looks like it's universal in that you find it in all cultures. The way you find it,

06:46.080 --> 06:52.720
 step back one step, the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests. What battery

06:52.720 --> 06:59.840
 you choose, take a battery of any mental tests you want, give it to a large number of diverse

06:59.840 --> 07:07.760
 people, and you will be able to extract statistically the common, the commonality among

07:07.760 --> 07:15.760
 all those tests. It's done by a technique called factor analysis. People think that this may be

07:15.760 --> 07:20.640
 a statistical artifact of some kind. It is not a statistical artifact.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.560
 What is factor analysis?

07:22.560 --> 07:27.920
 Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data and look at the correlation among

07:27.920 --> 07:34.720
 the different test scores, and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together.

07:34.720 --> 07:40.960
 There are different factors. If you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor,

07:40.960 --> 07:47.200
 there may be a numerical factor, there may be a visual spatial factor, but those factors

07:47.200 --> 07:55.280
 have variants in common with each other. That's what's common among all the tests,

07:55.280 --> 08:01.360
 and that's what gets labeled the G factor. If you give a diverse battery of mental tests

08:01.360 --> 08:08.080
 and you extract a G factor from it, that factor usually accounts for around half of the variants.

08:08.080 --> 08:14.960
 It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor, but it is the most reliable,

08:14.960 --> 08:24.720
 it is the most stable, and it seems to be very much influenced by genetics. It's very hard to

08:24.720 --> 08:34.000
 change the G factor with training or drugs or anything else. We don't know how to increase

08:34.000 --> 08:34.880
 the G factor.

08:34.880 --> 08:40.800
 Okay. You said a lot of really interesting things there. First, just to get people used to it,

08:40.800 --> 08:47.440
 in case they're not familiar with this idea, G factor is what we mean. Often, there's this

08:47.440 --> 08:57.200
 term used IQ, which is the way IQ is used, they really mean G factor in regular conversation.

08:58.240 --> 09:04.320
 The way, because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence, and what we mean by intelligence,

09:04.320 --> 09:09.680
 we mean general intelligence, and general intelligence in the human mind from a psychology,

09:09.680 --> 09:15.600
 from a serious rigorous scientific perspective actually means G factor. G factor equals intelligence,

09:15.600 --> 09:22.080
 just in this conversation to define terms. Okay. There's this stable thing called G factor.

09:23.680 --> 09:33.440
 Now, factor, you said factor many times means a measure that's potentially could be reduced to

09:33.440 --> 09:41.280
 a single number across the different factors you mentioned. What you said, it accounts for half,

09:41.280 --> 09:52.720
 half ish. It accounts for half ish of what? Of variance across the different set of tests.

09:53.600 --> 10:01.680
 So, if you do for some reason, well on some set of tests, what does that mean? So, that means

10:01.680 --> 10:06.320
 there's some unique capabilities outside of G factor that might account for that. And what are

10:06.320 --> 10:12.480
 those? What else is there besides the raw horsepower of the engine inside your mind that generates

10:12.480 --> 10:21.760
 intelligence? There are test taking skills. There are specific abilities. Someone might be

10:21.760 --> 10:31.600
 particularly good at mathematical things, mathematical concepts, even simple arithmetic

10:31.600 --> 10:37.120
 people. Some people are much better than others. You might know people who can memorize and short

10:37.120 --> 10:46.720
 term memory is another component of this. Short term memory is one of the cognitive processes

10:46.720 --> 10:55.360
 that's most highly correlated with the G factor. So, all those things like memory,

10:55.360 --> 11:02.960
 test taking skills account for variability across the test performances. So, you can

11:03.840 --> 11:12.320
 run but you can't hide from the thing that God gave you, the genetics. So, that G factor,

11:12.960 --> 11:20.880
 science says that G factor is there. Each one of us has a G factor. Oh boy. Some have more than

11:20.880 --> 11:30.880
 others. I'm getting uncomfortable already. Well, IQ is a score. An IQ score is a very good estimate

11:30.880 --> 11:37.280
 of the G factor. You can't measure G directly. There's no direct measure. You estimate it from

11:37.280 --> 11:45.360
 these statistical techniques. But an IQ score is a good estimate. Why? Because a standard IQ test

11:45.360 --> 11:52.480
 is a battery of different mental abilities. You combine it into one score and that score

11:52.480 --> 12:00.080
 is highly correlated with the G factor, even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.

12:00.080 --> 12:06.080
 Because again, it's what's common to all these mental abilities. So, a good IQ test,

12:06.880 --> 12:13.760
 I'll ask you about that, but a good IQ test tries to compress down that battery of tests,

12:13.760 --> 12:20.560
 like tries to get a nice battery, the nice selection of variable tests into one test.

12:21.280 --> 12:26.400
 And so, in that way, it sneaks up to this G factor. And that's another interesting thing about

12:26.400 --> 12:33.520
 G factor. Now, you give, first of all, you have a great book on the neuroscience of

12:33.520 --> 12:39.040
 intelligence. You have a great course, which is when I first learned, you're a great teacher.

12:39.040 --> 12:45.680
 Let me just say. Thank you. Your course at the teaching company, I hope I'm saying that correctly.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.440
 The intelligent brain. The intelligent brain is when I first

12:50.080 --> 12:55.600
 heard about this G factor, this mysterious thing that lurks in the darkness that we cannot

12:55.600 --> 13:00.480
 quite shine a light on, we're trying to sneak up on. So, the fact that there's this measure,

13:00.480 --> 13:07.680
 stable measure of intelligence, we can't measure directly. But we can come up with a battery test

13:07.680 --> 13:19.040
 or one test that includes a battery of variable type of questions that can reliably or attempt to

13:19.040 --> 13:24.640
 estimate in a stable way that G factor. That's a fascinating idea. So, for me as an AI person,

13:24.640 --> 13:29.200
 it's fascinating. It's fascinating there's something stable like that about the human mind,

13:29.200 --> 13:37.520
 especially if it's grounded in genetics. It's both fascinating that as a researcher of the human

13:37.520 --> 13:46.800
 mind and all the human psychological, sociological, ethical questions that started rising, it makes

13:46.800 --> 13:54.800
 me uncomfortable. But truth can be uncomfortable. I get that a lot about being uncomfortable talking

13:54.800 --> 14:03.120
 about this. Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing. It doesn't matter

14:03.120 --> 14:12.240
 which battery of tests you use. So, there are countless tests. You can take any 12 of them

14:12.240 --> 14:19.840
 at random, extract a G factor and another 12 at random and extract a G factor and those G factors

14:19.840 --> 14:26.480
 will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other. So, it is a ubiquitous. It doesn't

14:26.480 --> 14:32.800
 depend on the content of the test is what I'm trying to say. It is general among all those tests

14:32.800 --> 14:41.600
 of mental ability. And tests of mental abilities include things like G's playing poker. Your

14:41.600 --> 14:50.560
 skill at poker is not unrelated to G. Your skill at anything that requires reasoning and thinking,

14:50.560 --> 15:01.200
 anything from spelling, arithmetic, more complex things. This concept is ubiquitous and when you

15:01.200 --> 15:07.200
 do batteries of tests in different cultures, you get the same thing. So, this says something

15:07.200 --> 15:13.840
 interesting about the human mind that is a computer is designed to be general. So, that means you can

15:15.200 --> 15:23.200
 so it's not easily made specialized. Meaning, if you're going to be good at one thing,

15:23.200 --> 15:31.920
 Miyamoto Masashi has this quote. He's an ancient warrior, famous for the book of Five Rings in

15:31.920 --> 15:37.600
 the martial arts world. And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly, you will see it in

15:37.600 --> 15:47.680
 everything. Meaning, if you do one thing, it's going to generalize to everything. And that's an

15:47.680 --> 15:56.480
 interesting thing about the human mind. So, that's what the G factor reveals. Okay. So, what's the

15:56.480 --> 16:01.760
 difference if you can elaborate a little bit further between IQ and G factor? Just because

16:01.760 --> 16:07.440
 it's a source of confusion for people. And IQ is a score. People use the word IQ to mean

16:07.440 --> 16:14.400
 intelligence. But IQ has a more technical meaning for people who work in the field. And it's an IQ

16:14.400 --> 16:22.240
 score, a score on a test that estimates the G factor. And the G factor is what's common among

16:22.240 --> 16:28.640
 all these tests of mental ability. So, if you think about, it's not a Venn diagram, but I guess

16:28.640 --> 16:34.960
 you could make a Venn diagram out of it. But the G factor would be really at the core, what's common

16:34.960 --> 16:44.880
 to everything. And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order of people on the score. And this is

16:44.880 --> 16:49.840
 what makes people uncomfortable. This is where there's a lot of controversy about whether IQ

16:49.840 --> 16:58.240
 tests are biased toward any one group or another. And a lot of the answers to these questions are

16:58.240 --> 17:04.000
 very clear, but they also have a technical aspect of it that's not so easy to explain.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.160
 Well, we'll talk about the fascinating and the difficult things about all of this. But

17:10.560 --> 17:15.360
 so, by the way, when you say rank order, that means you get a number and that means one person,

17:15.360 --> 17:22.000
 you can now compare. Like, you could say that this other person is more intelligent than me.

17:22.800 --> 17:29.920
 Well, what you can say is IQ scores are interpreted really as percentiles. So that

17:29.920 --> 17:37.840
 if you have an IQ of 140 and somebody else has 70, the metric is such that you cannot say the person

17:37.840 --> 17:47.520
 with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart as a person with an IQ of 70. That would require a ratio scale

17:47.520 --> 17:53.280
 with an absolute zero. Now, you may think you know people with zero intelligence, but in fact,

17:53.280 --> 18:02.720
 there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale. It's relative to other people. So relative to other

18:02.720 --> 18:11.920
 people, somebody with an IQ score of 140 is in the upper less than 1%, whereas somebody with an IQ

18:11.920 --> 18:18.000
 of 70 is two standard deviations below the mean. That's a different percentile.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.840
 So it's similar to like in chess, you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.

18:27.600 --> 18:33.360
 So you can't say it's twice. One person, if your ELO rating is twice another person,

18:33.360 --> 18:38.320
 I don't think you're twice as good at chess. It's not stable in that way, but because it's

18:38.320 --> 18:45.520
 very difficult to do these kinds of comparisons. But so what can we say about the number itself?

18:45.520 --> 18:50.000
 Is that stable across tests and so on and so forth?

18:50.000 --> 18:55.440
 There are a number of statistical properties of any test. They're called psychometric

18:55.440 --> 19:02.640
 properties. You have validity, you have reliability, there are many different kinds of reliability.

19:02.640 --> 19:09.680
 They all essentially measure stability and IQ tests are stable within an individual.

19:09.680 --> 19:16.160
 There are some longitudinal studies where children were measured at age 11. And again,

19:16.160 --> 19:22.000
 when they were 70 years old and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.520
 This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland. In the 1930s, some researchers

19:29.520 --> 19:36.800
 decided to get an IQ test on every single child age 11 in the whole country. And they did.

19:36.800 --> 19:45.520
 And those records were discovered in an old storeroom at the University of Edinburgh

19:46.320 --> 19:53.360
 by a friend of mine, Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them, and has done a lot of

19:53.360 --> 19:59.840
 research on the people who are still alive today from that original study, including brain imaging

19:59.840 --> 20:08.400
 research, by the way. Really, it's a fascinating group of people who are studied. Not to get

20:08.400 --> 20:14.560
 ahead of the story, but one of the most interesting things they found is a very strong relationship

20:14.560 --> 20:27.520
 between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality so that in the 70 years later,

20:27.520 --> 20:34.240
 they looked at the survival rates and they could get death records from everybody. And Scotland

20:34.240 --> 20:40.640
 has universal health care for everybody. And it turned out if you divide the people by their age

20:40.640 --> 20:48.320
 11 IQ score into quartiles and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,

20:49.440 --> 20:56.000
 the, I know this is in the book, I have the graph in the book, but there are essentially

20:56.000 --> 21:01.840
 twice as many people alive in the highest IQ quartile than in the lowest IQ quartile,

21:01.840 --> 21:10.000
 true in men and women. Interesting. So it makes a big difference. Now, why this is the case

21:10.640 --> 21:15.440
 is not so clear since everyone had access to health care.

21:15.440 --> 21:21.040
 Well, there's a lot and we'll talk about it, you know, just the sentences you used now

21:21.040 --> 21:28.320
 could be explained by nature or nurture. We don't know. Now, there's a lot of science that

21:28.320 --> 21:33.600
 starts to then dig in and investigate that question. But let me linger on the IQ test.

21:33.600 --> 21:39.840
 How are the IQ test design, how do they work? Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.

21:41.280 --> 21:47.920
 What makes a good IQ test question that sneaks up on this G factor measure?

21:47.920 --> 21:54.240
 Well, your question is interesting because you want me to give examples of items that make good

21:54.240 --> 22:01.520
 items. And what makes a good item is not so much its content, but its empirical relationship to

22:01.520 --> 22:11.280
 the total score that turns out to be valid by other means. So for example, let me give you

22:11.280 --> 22:18.960
 an odd example from personality testing. Nice. So there's a personality test called the Minnesota

22:18.960 --> 22:23.920
 Multiphazic Personality Inventory, MMPI, been around for decades.

22:23.920 --> 22:29.280
 I've heard about this test recently because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial. I don't

22:29.280 --> 22:33.360
 know if you've been paying attention to that. I have not been paying attention to it.

22:33.360 --> 22:38.560
 They had psychologists on the stand and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,

22:38.560 --> 22:45.520
 again, I'm learning so much from this trial. They did different battery of tests

22:46.960 --> 22:53.280
 to diagnose personality disorders. Apparently, there's that systematic way of doing so. And

22:53.280 --> 23:00.320
 the Minnesota one is one of the ones that there's the most science on. There's a lot of great papers

23:00.320 --> 23:05.840
 which were all continuously cited on the stand, which is fascinating to watch. Sorry, a little bit

23:05.840 --> 23:08.880
 of attention. It's okay. I mean, this is interesting because you're right. It's been around for

23:08.880 --> 23:14.800
 decades. There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test,

23:14.800 --> 23:21.600
 including what it predicts with respect to different categories of personality disorder.

23:22.160 --> 23:28.960
 But what I want to mention is the content of the items on that test. All of the items are

23:28.960 --> 23:38.080
 essentially true, false items. True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath. True or false,

23:38.880 --> 23:46.240
 I think Lincoln was a better president than Washington. What does that have to do?

23:47.680 --> 23:50.800
 And the point is the content of these items, nobody knows why

23:50.800 --> 23:59.440
 these items in aggregate predict anything, but empirically they do. It's a technique of

23:59.440 --> 24:07.280
 choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism. That the content doesn't matter,

24:07.280 --> 24:13.200
 but for some reason, when you get a criterion group of people with this disorder and you compare

24:13.200 --> 24:20.480
 them to people without that disorder, these are the items that distinguish. Irrespective of content,

24:20.480 --> 24:24.640
 it's a hard concept to grasp. Well, first of all, it's fascinating.

24:29.920 --> 24:36.480
 I consider myself part psychologist because I love human robot interaction and that's a problem.

24:36.480 --> 24:43.040
 Half of that problem is a psychology problem because there's a human. So designing these tests

24:43.040 --> 24:52.000
 to get at the questions is the fascinating part. Like, what does dust bowl empiricism refer to?

24:52.560 --> 25:02.160
 Does it refer to the final result? Yeah, so it's the test of dust bowl empiricism, but how do you

25:02.160 --> 25:08.800
 arrive at the battery of questions? I presume one of the things now, again, I'm going to the

25:08.800 --> 25:14.400
 excellent testimony in that trial. They explain it because they also, they explain the tests,

25:16.640 --> 25:23.280
 that a bunch of the questions are kind of make you forget that you're taking a test.

25:23.920 --> 25:31.520
 Like, it makes it very difficult for you to somehow figure out what you're supposed to answer.

25:31.520 --> 25:36.160
 Yes, it's called social desirability, but we're getting a little far afield because I only wanted

25:36.160 --> 25:43.120
 to give that example of dust bowl empiricism. When we talk about the items on an IQ test,

25:44.400 --> 25:53.440
 many of those items in the dust bowl empiricism method have no face validity. In other words,

25:53.440 --> 26:00.400
 they don't look like they measure anything. Whereas most intelligence tests, the items

26:00.400 --> 26:05.120
 actually look like they're measuring some mental ability. So here's one of the...

26:05.120 --> 26:08.240
 Oh, so you were bringing that up as an example as what it is not?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.360
 Yes. Got it.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.720
 Okay. So I don't want to go too far afield on it.

26:12.720 --> 26:18.960
 Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast. So I should mention that.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.840
 Far afield.

26:19.840 --> 26:27.440
 Far afield. Yeah, so anyway, sorry. So they feel the questions look like they pass the face validity

26:27.440 --> 26:32.000
 test. And some more than others. So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.

26:32.000 --> 26:41.600
 One of the subtests on a standard IQ test is general information. Let me just think a little

26:41.600 --> 26:49.200
 bit because I don't want to give you the actual item. But if I said how far is it between Washington,

26:49.200 --> 26:58.000
 D.C. and Miami, Florida, within 500 miles plus or minus? Well, you know, it's not a fact most

26:58.000 --> 27:04.320
 people memorize, but you know something about geography. You say, well, I flew there once.

27:04.320 --> 27:12.400
 I know planes fly 500 miles. You can kind of make an estimate. But it also seems like it would be

27:12.400 --> 27:22.000
 very cultural. So there's that kind of general information. Then there's vocabulary test.

27:22.000 --> 27:33.040
 What does regatta mean? And I choose that word because that word was removed from the IQ test

27:33.040 --> 27:39.520
 because people complained that disadvantaged people would not know that word just from their

27:39.520 --> 27:46.560
 everyday life. Okay, here's another example from a different kind of subtest.

27:46.560 --> 27:54.160
 What's regatta, by the way? Regatta is a sailing competition, a competition

27:54.160 --> 28:00.560
 with boats, not necessarily sailing, but the competition with boats. Yep, yep. I'm probably

28:00.560 --> 28:04.880
 disadvantaged in that way. Okay, excellent. So that was removed. You were saying.

28:04.880 --> 28:10.320
 Okay. So here's another subtest. I'm going to repeat a string of numbers. And when I'm done,

28:10.320 --> 28:20.800
 I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready? Okay, seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.960
 That's way too many. Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

28:24.960 --> 28:29.680
 Okay, you get the idea. Now the actual test starts with a smaller number,

28:30.400 --> 28:34.800
 you know, like two numbers. And then it is people get it right. You keep going,

28:34.800 --> 28:40.960
 adding to the string of numbers until they can't do it anymore. Okay, but now try this. I'm going to

28:42.080 --> 28:45.760
 say some numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them to me backwards.

28:46.480 --> 28:53.600
 I quit. Okay. Now, so I gave you some examples of the kind of items on an IQ test. Yes.

28:53.600 --> 29:00.880
 General information. I can't even remember all. General information, vocabulary,

29:00.880 --> 29:08.800
 digit span forward and digit span backward. Well, you said I can't even remember them.

29:08.800 --> 29:13.120
 That's a good question for me. What does memory have to do with you?

29:13.120 --> 29:19.840
 Okay, well, let's hold on. Let's just talk about these examples. Now,

29:19.840 --> 29:29.600
 some of those items seem very cultural and others seem less cultural.

29:31.920 --> 29:38.080
 Which ones do you think scores on which subtests are most highly correlated with the G factor?

29:39.440 --> 29:42.240
 Well, the two advances less cultural.

29:42.240 --> 29:52.400
 Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated. And it turns out that digit span

29:52.960 --> 29:58.560
 backwards is highly correlated. How do you figure?

29:58.560 --> 30:03.920
 Now you have decades of research to answer the question, how do you figure?

30:04.480 --> 30:10.720
 Right. So now there's like good research that gives you intuition about what kind of questions

30:10.720 --> 30:20.000
 you can get at it. Just like there's something I've done. I've actually used for research,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.160
 just send me a autonomous vehicle, like whether humans are paying attention,

30:24.160 --> 30:29.360
 there's a body of literature that does like end back tests. For example, we have to

30:33.360 --> 30:39.120
 put workload on the brain to do recall, memory recall. And that helps you kind of

30:39.120 --> 30:45.120
 put some work onto the brain while the person is doing some other task. And this does some

30:45.120 --> 30:50.320
 interesting research with that. But that's loading the memory. So there's like research around

30:50.960 --> 30:56.720
 stably what that means about the human mind. And here you're saying recall backwards

30:58.400 --> 31:03.680
 is a good predictor. The transformation. Yeah. So you have to do some,

31:03.680 --> 31:10.800
 some, like you have to load that into your brain and not just remember it, but do something with

31:10.800 --> 31:16.560
 it. Right. Here's another example of a different kind of test called the HIC paradigm. And it's

31:16.560 --> 31:24.560
 not verbal at all. It's a little box. And there are a series of lights arranged in a semi circle

31:25.120 --> 31:32.880
 at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights

31:32.880 --> 31:39.840
 goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights. You take your finger off the home button

31:39.840 --> 31:45.840
 and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction

31:45.840 --> 31:50.880
 time. Like goes on as quick as you can, you press the button and you get a reaction time from the

31:50.880 --> 31:57.520
 moment you lift your finger off the button that when you press the button with where the light is,

31:57.520 --> 32:06.800
 that reaction time doesn't really correlate with IQ very much. But if you change the instructions

32:07.520 --> 32:14.480
 and you say three lights are going to come on simultaneously, I want you to press the button

32:14.480 --> 32:21.600
 next to the light that's furthest from the other two. So maybe lights one and two go on and,

32:21.600 --> 32:26.480
 and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger off and you would press the

32:26.480 --> 32:35.520
 button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task. It's not really hard.

32:36.240 --> 32:42.400
 Almost everybody gets it all right. But your reaction time to that is highly correlated

32:42.400 --> 32:46.800
 with the G factor. This is fascinating. So reaction time. So there's a temporal

32:47.600 --> 32:52.880
 aspect to this. So what, what role does time... Speed of processing. It's the speed of processing.

32:52.880 --> 33:00.640
 Is this also true for ones that take longer like five, 10, 30 seconds? Is time part of the measure

33:00.640 --> 33:06.720
 with some of these ideas? Yes. And that is why some of the best IQ tests have a time limit.

33:07.760 --> 33:14.880
 Because if you have no time limit, people can do better. But it doesn't, it doesn't distinguish

33:14.880 --> 33:23.040
 among people that well. So that adding the time element is important. So speed of information

33:23.040 --> 33:29.760
 processing and reaction time is a measure of speed of information processing turns out to

33:29.760 --> 33:36.880
 be related to the G factor. But the G factor only accounts for maybe half or some amount on the test

33:36.880 --> 33:46.800
 performance. For example, I get pretty bad test anxiety. Like I was never, I mean, I just don't

33:46.800 --> 33:52.800
 enjoy tests. I enjoy going back into my cave and working. Like I've always enjoyed homework

33:53.440 --> 33:59.200
 way more than tests. No matter how hard the homework is, because I can go back to the cave

33:59.200 --> 34:04.240
 and hide away and think deeply. There's something about being watched and having a time limit

34:04.240 --> 34:10.080
 that really makes me anxious. And I could just see the mind not operating optimally at all.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.920
 But you're saying underneath there, there's still a G factor. There's still a question.

34:14.800 --> 34:20.720
 No question. Boy. And if you get anxious taking a test, many people say, oh, I didn't do well

34:20.720 --> 34:27.040
 because I'm anxious. Yeah. You know, I hear that a lot. Well, fine. If you're really anxious during

34:27.040 --> 34:33.200
 the test, the score will be a bad estimate of your G factor. Yeah. It doesn't mean the G factor

34:33.200 --> 34:41.440
 isn't there. That's right. And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT, they're essentially

34:41.440 --> 34:48.240
 intelligence tests. They are highly G loaded. Now, the people who make the SAT don't want to

34:48.240 --> 34:53.840
 mention that for obvious. They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing.

34:53.840 --> 34:59.600
 But to call it an intelligence test is really beyond the pale. But in fact, it's so highly

34:59.600 --> 35:06.000
 correlated because it's a reasoning test. The SAT is a reasoning test, a verbal reasoning,

35:06.000 --> 35:13.840
 mathematical reasoning. Yeah. And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to G.

35:13.840 --> 35:20.080
 But if people go in and take a standardized test, whether it's an IQ test or the SAT,

35:20.080 --> 35:27.680
 and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever, the score is not going to be a good

35:27.680 --> 35:34.800
 estimate of their G. If they retake the test when they're not anxious or less anxious or don't have

35:34.800 --> 35:42.320
 a fever, the score will go up and that will be a better estimate. But you can't say their G factor

35:42.320 --> 35:48.800
 increased between the two tests. Well, it's interesting. So the question is how wide of a

35:48.800 --> 35:54.640
 battery of tests is required to estimate the G factor? Well, because I'll give you as my personal

35:54.640 --> 36:01.760
 example, I took the SAT and I think it was called the ACT, where I was to also, I took SAT many

36:01.760 --> 36:09.120
 times. Every single time I got a perfect math and verbal, the time limit on the verbal made me

36:09.120 --> 36:15.280
 very anxious. I did not, I mean, part of it, I didn't speak English very well. But honestly,

36:15.280 --> 36:19.760
 it was like, you're supposed to remember stuff. And like, I was so anxious. And like, as I'm reading,

36:19.760 --> 36:27.040
 I'm sweating. I can't, you know, that like, that feeling you have when you're reading a book and

36:27.040 --> 36:32.480
 you, you just read a page and you know nothing about what you've read because you zoned out,

36:32.480 --> 36:39.520
 that's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to, you're like, no, read and understand. And

36:39.520 --> 36:46.960
 that anxiety is like, you start seeing like the typography versus the content of the words.

36:46.960 --> 36:55.600
 Like that was, I don't, it's interesting because I know that what they're measuring,

36:55.600 --> 37:02.480
 I could see being correlated with something. But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance,

37:04.720 --> 37:11.200
 sure plays a factor. And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way. I mean, this is a broader

37:11.200 --> 37:18.800
 discussion, but that's like standardized testing, how you sneak up, how you get at the fact that

37:18.800 --> 37:24.480
 I'm super anxious and still nevertheless measure some aspect of my intelligence. I wonder, I don't

37:24.480 --> 37:28.000
 know, I don't know if you can say it to that, that time limit sure is a pain.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.640
 Yeah. Well, let me say this, there are two ways to approach the very real problem that you say

37:34.640 --> 37:43.280
 that some people just get anxious or not good test takers. By the way, part of testing is,

37:44.240 --> 37:51.440
 you know the answer, you can figure out the answer, or you can't. If you don't know the answer,

37:51.440 --> 37:56.160
 there are many reasons you don't know the answer at that particular moment. You may have learned it

37:56.160 --> 38:02.000
 once and forgotten it. It may be on the tip of your tongue and you just can't get it because

38:02.000 --> 38:08.400
 you're anxious about the time limit. You may never have learned it. You may have been exposed to

38:08.400 --> 38:12.960
 it, but it was too complicated and you couldn't learn it. I mean, there are all kinds of reasons

38:12.960 --> 38:22.640
 here. But for an individual to interpret your scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting

38:22.640 --> 38:29.040
 the score has to take into account various things that would affect your individual score.

38:29.040 --> 38:36.800
 And that's why decisions about college admission or anything else where tests are used are hardly

38:36.800 --> 38:45.360
 ever the only criterion to make a decision. And I think people are, college admissions letting

38:45.360 --> 38:53.520
 go of that very much. Oh, yes. But what does that even mean? Because is it possible to design

38:53.520 --> 38:58.960
 standardized tests that are useful to college admissions? Well, they all

38:58.960 --> 39:05.120
 already exist. The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects of success at college.

39:05.120 --> 39:11.600
 Here's the problem. So maybe you could speak to this. The correlation across a population versus

39:11.600 --> 39:20.880
 individuals. So, you know, our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,

39:20.880 --> 39:29.520
 well, it's still, there's tragic cases where innocent people go to jail,

39:29.520 --> 39:37.120
 but you try to avoid that. In the same way with testing, it just, it would suck for an SAT to

39:37.120 --> 39:44.400
 miss genius. Yes. And it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely. Unlikely. So it really

39:44.400 --> 39:56.960
 comes down to do which piece of information maximizes your decision making ability.

39:58.640 --> 40:08.160
 So if you just use high school grades, it's okay. But you will miss some people who just don't do

40:08.160 --> 40:13.200
 well in high school, but who are actually pretty smart, smart enough to be bored silly in high

40:13.200 --> 40:18.720
 school, and they don't care, and their high school GPA isn't that good. So you will miss them

40:19.440 --> 40:26.400
 in the same sense that somebody who could be very able and ready for college just doesn't

40:26.400 --> 40:35.920
 do well on their SAT. This is why you make decisions with taking in a variety of information.

40:35.920 --> 40:43.840
 The other thing I wanted to say, I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,

40:43.840 --> 40:51.360
 statistically for groups, there are many people who have a disparity between their math score

40:51.360 --> 40:57.760
 and their verbal score. That disparity or the other way around, that disparity is called tilt.

40:58.480 --> 41:05.520
 The score is tilted one way or the other. And that tilt has been studied empirically to see what

41:05.520 --> 41:14.720
 that predicts. And in fact, you can't make predictions about college success based on tilt.

41:14.720 --> 41:20.160
 And mathematics is a good example. There are many people, especially non native speakers of

41:20.160 --> 41:25.760
 English who come to this country, take the SATs, do very well on the math and not so well on the

41:25.760 --> 41:33.120
 verbal. Well, if they're applying to a math program, the professors there who are making the

41:33.120 --> 41:40.400
 decision or the admissions officers don't wait so much the score on verbal, especially if it's

41:40.400 --> 41:46.800
 a non native speaker. Well, so yeah, you have to try to in the admission process bring in the context.

41:47.600 --> 41:52.560
 But non native isn't really the problem. I mean, that was part of the problem for me.

41:52.560 --> 42:03.680
 But it's the the anxiety was which it's interesting. It's interesting. Oh, boy,

42:03.680 --> 42:10.080
 reducing yourself down to numbers. But it's still true. It's still the truth. Well, it's a

42:10.080 --> 42:21.840
 painful that same anxiety that led me to be to struggle with the SAT verbal tests is still within

42:21.840 --> 42:29.280
 me in all ways of life. So maybe that's not anxiety. Maybe that's something, you know, like

42:29.280 --> 42:38.560
 personality is also pretty stable. Personality is stable. Personality does impact the way you

42:38.560 --> 42:45.600
 navigate life. Yeah, there's no question. Yeah. And we should say that the G factor in intelligence

42:45.600 --> 42:53.600
 is not just about some kind of number on a paper. It's also has to do with how you navigate life,

42:54.720 --> 43:02.720
 how easy life is for you in this very complicated world. So personality is all tied into that

43:02.720 --> 43:08.880
 in some in some in some deep fundamental way. But now you've hit the key point about why we even

43:08.880 --> 43:16.000
 want to study intelligence and personality, I think to a lesser extent, but that's my interest is

43:16.000 --> 43:21.680
 more on intelligence. I went to graduate school and wanted to study personality. But that's kind

43:21.680 --> 43:26.640
 of another story how I got kind of shifted from personality research over to intelligence research.

43:27.440 --> 43:34.640
 Because it's not just a number. Intelligence is not just an IQ score. It's not just an SAT score.

43:34.640 --> 43:44.000
 It's what those numbers reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life. It has been said

43:44.800 --> 43:57.280
 that life is one long intelligence test. And who can't relate to that? And if you doubt, see,

43:57.280 --> 44:02.000
 another problem here is a lot of critics of intelligence research, intelligence testing

44:02.000 --> 44:08.720
 testing tend to be academics who, by and large, are pretty smart people. And pretty smart people,

44:08.720 --> 44:14.480
 by and large, have enormous difficulty understanding what the world is like for people

44:14.480 --> 44:27.040
 with IQs of 80 or 75. It is a completely different everyday experience. Even IQ scores of 85, 90,

44:27.040 --> 44:33.600
 you know, there's a popular television program, Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with

44:34.240 --> 44:41.280
 everyday people with everyday problems. And you can see the full range of problem solving ability

44:41.280 --> 44:47.120
 demonstrated there. And sometimes she does it for laughs, but it really isn't funny because

44:47.120 --> 44:58.640
 there are people who are very limited in their life navigation, let alone success,

44:59.920 --> 45:08.240
 by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot be taught. We know this, by the way,

45:08.240 --> 45:12.800
 because there are many efforts. You know, the United States military, which excels at training

45:12.800 --> 45:18.480
 people. I mean, I don't know that there's a better organization in the world for training

45:18.480 --> 45:24.320
 diverse people. And they won't take people with IQs under, I think 83 is the cutoff.

45:25.200 --> 45:33.280
 Because they have found you, they are unable to train people with lower IQs to do jobs in

45:33.280 --> 45:37.520
 the military. So one of the things that gFactor has to do with is learning?

45:37.520 --> 45:45.280
 Absolutely. Some people learn faster than others. Some people learn more than others.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.760
 Now, faster, by the way, is not necessarily better,

45:49.280 --> 45:56.240
 as long as you get to the same place eventually. But, you know, there are professional schools

45:56.240 --> 46:03.760
 that want students who can learn the fastest because they can learn more or learn deeper or

46:03.760 --> 46:11.280
 all kinds of ideas about why you select people with the highest scores. And there's nothing funnier,

46:11.280 --> 46:17.520
 by the way, to listen to a bunch of academics complain about the concept of intelligence

46:17.520 --> 46:22.480
 and intelligence testing. And then you go to a faculty meeting where they're discussing

46:22.480 --> 46:26.880
 who to hire among the applicants. And all they talk about is how smart the person is.

46:28.240 --> 46:31.840
 We'll get to that. We'll sneak up to that in different ways. But there's something about

46:31.840 --> 46:37.200
 reducing a person to a number that in part is grounded to the person's genetics that makes

46:37.200 --> 46:42.640
 people very uncomfortable. But nobody does that. Nobody in the field actually does that.

46:43.760 --> 46:55.760
 That is a worry that is a worry like... Well, I don't want to call it a conspiracy theory.

46:55.760 --> 47:02.880
 I mean, it's a legitimate worry. But it just doesn't happen. Now, I had a professor in graduate

47:02.880 --> 47:11.120
 school who was the only person I ever knew who considered the students only by their test scores.

47:12.400 --> 47:17.440
 Yes. And later in his life, he kind of backed off that. But...

47:17.440 --> 47:25.120
 Well, let me ask you this. So we'll jump around. I'll come back to it. But I tend to...

47:25.120 --> 47:34.640
 I've had political discussions with people. And actually, my friend Michael Malis, he's

47:34.640 --> 47:44.000
 an anarchist. I disagree with him on basically everything except the fact that love is a beautiful

47:44.000 --> 47:51.120
 thing in this world. And he says this test about left versus right, whatever. It doesn't

47:51.120 --> 47:56.400
 matter what the test is. But he believes the question is, do you believe that some people

47:56.400 --> 48:05.440
 are better than others? The question is ambiguous. Do you believe some people are better than others?

48:05.440 --> 48:13.920
 And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no. It's a poetic question. It's an ambiguous question.

48:13.920 --> 48:22.160
 Right? Like, you know, people want to maybe the temptation to ask, but what? Better like sports

48:22.160 --> 48:29.840
 and so on? No. To me, I stand with the sort of the fondly documents of this country, which is all

48:29.840 --> 48:38.720
 men are created equal. There's a basic humanity. And there's something about tests of intelligence.

48:39.840 --> 48:45.280
 Just knowing that some people are different, like the science of intelligence that shows

48:45.280 --> 48:54.400
 that some people are genetically in some stable way across a lifetime, have a greater intelligence

48:54.400 --> 49:02.000
 than others, makes people feel like some people are better than others. And that makes them very

49:02.000 --> 49:08.960
 uncomfortable. And I maybe you can speak to that. The fact that some people are more intelligent than

49:08.960 --> 49:20.400
 others in a way that's cannot be compensated through education, through anything you do in life.

49:20.400 --> 49:28.880
 What do we do with that? Okay, there's a lot there. We haven't really talked about the genetics of

49:28.880 --> 49:37.760
 it yet. But you are correct in that it is my interpretation of the data that genetics has

49:37.760 --> 49:44.400
 a very important influence on the G factor. And this is controversial. We can talk about it.

49:44.400 --> 49:50.720
 But if you think that genetics, that genes are deterministic, are always deterministic,

49:50.720 --> 49:59.040
 that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed. But we know now in the 21st century that many

49:59.040 --> 50:08.560
 genes are not deterministic that are probabilistic, meaning their gene expression can be influenced.

50:08.560 --> 50:15.040
 Now, whether they're influenced only by other biological variables, or other genetic variables,

50:15.040 --> 50:22.320
 or environmental or cultural variables, that's where the controversy comes in. And we can come,

50:22.320 --> 50:29.120
 we can discuss that in more detail if you like. But to go to the question about better, people

50:29.120 --> 50:41.520
 are better. There's zero evidence that smart people are better with respect to important

50:41.520 --> 50:50.240
 aspects of life, like honesty, even likability. I'm sure you know many very intelligent people

50:50.240 --> 50:54.720
 who are not terribly likable, or terribly kind, or terribly honest.

50:54.720 --> 51:00.720
 Is there something to be said? So one of the things I've recently reread for the second time,

51:01.840 --> 51:08.160
 I guess that's what the word reread means. The rise and fall of the Third Reich,

51:08.800 --> 51:16.400
 which is, I think, the best telling of the rise and fall of Hitler. And one of the interesting

51:16.400 --> 51:32.240
 things about the people that, how should I say it, justified, or maybe propped up the ideas

51:32.240 --> 51:39.120
 that Hitler put forward is the fact that they were extremely intelligent. They were in the

51:39.120 --> 51:49.360
 intellectual class. It was obvious that they thought very deeply and rationally about the world.

51:49.360 --> 51:55.920
 So what I would like to say is one of the things that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities

51:55.920 --> 52:03.680
 in the history of humanity have been committed by very intelligent people. So that means that

52:03.680 --> 52:12.640
 intelligence doesn't make you a good person. I wonder if there's a g factor for intelligence.

52:12.640 --> 52:19.360
 I wonder if there's a g factor for goodness. The Nietzschean good and evil, of course,

52:19.360 --> 52:24.240
 that's probably harder to measure, because that's such a subjective thing, what it means to be good.

52:25.280 --> 52:30.320
 And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing, because how do we know?

52:30.320 --> 52:37.040
 But it's independent, whatever it is, it's independent of intelligence. I agree with you

52:37.040 --> 52:45.760
 about that. But let me say this, I have also asserted my belief that more intelligence is

52:45.760 --> 52:53.600
 better than less. It doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people,

52:54.240 --> 52:58.640
 but all things being equal, would you like to be smarter or less smart?

52:58.640 --> 53:03.200
 So if I had a pill, I have two pills, I said, this one will make you smarter, this one will

53:03.200 --> 53:08.640
 make you dumber. Which one would you like? Are there any circumstances under which you would

53:08.640 --> 53:13.600
 choose to be dumber? Well, let me ask you this. That's a very nuanced and interesting question.

53:15.360 --> 53:21.520
 You know, there's been books written about this, right? Now we'll return to the hard questions,

53:21.520 --> 53:26.800
 the interesting questions, but let me ask about human happiness. Does intelligence

53:26.800 --> 53:29.360
 lead to happiness? No.

53:31.760 --> 53:40.320
 So, okay, so back to the pill then. So why, when would you take the pill? So you said IQ 80,

53:41.600 --> 53:50.800
 90, 100, 110, you start going through the quartiles and is it obvious, isn't there

53:50.800 --> 53:56.160
 a diminishing returns and then it starts becoming negative?

53:57.200 --> 54:07.360
 This is an empirical question. And so that I have advocated in many forums more research

54:08.160 --> 54:15.200
 on enhancing the G factor. Right now, there's, there have been many claims about enhancing

54:15.200 --> 54:21.280
 intelligence with, you mentioned the NVAC training, it was a big deal a few years ago,

54:21.280 --> 54:24.480
 it doesn't work. Data is very clear, it does not work.

54:25.520 --> 54:31.040
 Or doing like memory tests, like training and so on. Yeah, it may give you a better memory

54:31.040 --> 54:40.400
 in the short run, but it doesn't impact your G factor. It was very popular a couple of decades

54:40.400 --> 54:47.280
 ago that the idea that listening to Mozart could make you more intelligent. There was a paper

54:47.280 --> 54:52.880
 published on this with somebody I knew published this paper, intelligence researchers never

54:52.880 --> 54:57.680
 believed it for a second. There have been hundreds of studies, all the meta analyses,

54:57.680 --> 55:03.600
 all the summaries and so on. There's nothing to it, nothing to it at all.

55:03.600 --> 55:14.080
 But wouldn't it be something, wouldn't it be world shaking if you could take the normal

55:14.080 --> 55:19.600
 distribution of intelligence, which we haven't really talked about yet, but IQ scores and the

55:19.600 --> 55:27.680
 G factor is thought to be a normal distribution and shift it to the right so that everybody

55:27.680 --> 55:36.400
 is smarter. Even a half a standard deviation would be world shaking because there are many

55:36.400 --> 55:44.880
 social problems, many, many social problems that are exacerbated by people with lower

55:45.920 --> 55:50.240
 ability to reason stuff out and navigate everyday life.

55:50.240 --> 55:58.480
 I wonder if there's a threshold. So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting

55:59.280 --> 56:06.240
 of the normal distribution may not be the optimal way of shifting. Maybe it's better to

56:07.120 --> 56:13.840
 whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions is like really pushing the lower up versus

56:13.840 --> 56:20.880
 trying to make the people at the average more intelligent. So you're saying that if in fact

56:20.880 --> 56:26.880
 there was some way to increase G, let's just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,

56:27.600 --> 56:35.120
 we should only give it to people at the lower end. No, it's just intuitively I can see that

56:35.120 --> 56:42.000
 life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased. It becomes less and less. It is

56:42.000 --> 56:48.240
 a empirical scientific question, but it becomes less and less obvious to me that more intelligence

56:49.200 --> 56:57.280
 is better. At the high end, not because it would make life easier, but it would make

56:57.840 --> 57:05.280
 whatever problems you're working on more solvable. And if you are working on artificial

57:05.280 --> 57:13.200
 intelligence, there's a tremendous potential for that to improve society.

57:13.200 --> 57:19.920
 I understand. So at whatever problems you're working on, yes, but there's also the problem

57:19.920 --> 57:27.760
 of the human condition. There's love, there's fear and all of those beautiful things that sometimes

57:27.760 --> 57:31.520
 if you're good at solving problems, you're going to create more problems for yourself.

57:31.520 --> 57:38.240
 I'm not exactly sure. So ignorance is bliss is a thing. So there might be a place,

57:38.240 --> 57:43.600
 there might be a sweet spot of intelligence given your environment, given your personality,

57:43.600 --> 57:48.000
 all of those kinds of things. And that becomes less beautifully complicated,

57:48.000 --> 57:53.040
 the more and more intelligent you become. But that's a question for literature,

57:53.040 --> 57:59.360
 not for science, perhaps. Well, imagine this. Imagine there was an IQ pill and it was developed

57:59.360 --> 58:07.840
 by a private company. And they are willing to sell it to you. And whatever price they put on it,

58:07.840 --> 58:13.280
 you are willing to pay it because you would like to be smarter. But just before they give you a

58:13.280 --> 58:24.080
 pill, they give you a disclaimer form to sign. Yes. Don't hold us. You understand that this pill

58:24.080 --> 58:30.720
 has no guarantee that your life is going to be better. And in fact, it could be worse. Well,

58:30.720 --> 58:34.320
 yes, that's how lawyers work. But I would love for science to answer the question,

58:35.040 --> 58:40.480
 to try to predict if your life is going to be better or worse, when you become more or less

58:40.480 --> 58:45.520
 intelligent. It's a fascinating question about what is the sweet spot for the human condition?

58:45.520 --> 58:54.560
 Some of the things we see as bugs might be actually features may be crucial to our

58:54.560 --> 58:59.920
 overall happinesses. Our limitations might lead to more happiness than less. But again,

58:59.920 --> 59:06.480
 more intelligence is better at the lower end. That's something that's less arguable and

59:07.760 --> 59:12.080
 fascinating if possible to increase. But you know, there's virtually no research

59:12.080 --> 59:18.960
 that's based on a neuroscience approach to solving that problem. All the solutions that

59:18.960 --> 59:26.720
 have been proposed to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem are essentially based

59:26.720 --> 59:35.360
 on the blank slate assumption that enriching the environment, removing barriers, all good things,

59:35.360 --> 59:39.920
 by the way. I'm not against any of those things. But there's no empirical evidence that they're

59:39.920 --> 59:47.120
 going to improve the general reasoning ability or make people more employable.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.240
 Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.320
 That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.

59:56.000 --> 1:00:03.520
 There are many profound aspects of that story. It was a film that was very good. The film was

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:10.080
 called Charlie for the younger people who are listening to this. You might be able to stream

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:19.280
 it on Netflix or something. But it was a story about a person with very low IQ who underwent a

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:26.960
 surgical procedure in the brain, and he slowly became a genius. And the tragedy of the story is

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:36.000
 the effect was temporary. It's a fascinating story, really. That goes in contrast to the basic human

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:43.680
 experience that each of us individually have, but it raises the question of the full range of

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:50.400
 people who might be able to be given different levels of intelligence. You've mentioned the

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:57.520
 normal distribution. Let's talk about it. There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994,

1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:03.520
 written by psychologist Richard Hernstein and political scientist Charles Murray.

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:11.760
 Why was this book so controversial? This is a fascinating book. I know Charles Murray.

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:20.160
 I've had many conversations with him. What is the book about? The book is about the importance

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:29.200
 of intelligence in everyday life. That's what the book is about. It's an empirical book.

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:38.560
 It has statistical analyses of very large databases that show that essentially IQ scores or their

1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:49.440
 equivalent are correlated to all kinds of social problems and social benefits. And that in itself

1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:56.160
 is not where the controversy about that book came. The controversy was about one chapter

1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:03.840
 in that book. And that is a chapter about the average difference in mean scores between

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:09.200
 black Americans and white Americans. And these are the terms that were used in the book at the

1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:22.000
 time and are still used to some extent. And historically, or really for decades, it has been

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:36.880
 observed that disadvantaged groups score on average lower than Caucasians on academic tests,

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:42.240
 tests of mental ability, and especially on IQ tests. And the difference is about a standard

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:49.520
 deviation, which is about 15 points, which is a substantial difference. In the book,

1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:57.920
 Hernstein and Murray in this one chapter assert clearly and unambiguously

1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:07.120
 that whether this average difference is due to genetics or not, they are agnostic. They

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:13.920
 don't know. Moreover, they assert they don't care because you wouldn't treat anybody differently

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:20.560
 knowing that if there was a genetic component or not, because that's a group average finding.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:26.000
 Every individual has to be treated as an individual. You can't make any assumption

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:33.120
 about what that person's intellectual ability might be from the fact of an average group difference.

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:42.640
 They're very clear about this. Nonetheless, people took away, I'm going to choose my words

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:48.160
 carefully because I have a feeling that many critics didn't actually read the book,

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:53.840
 they took away that Hernstein and Murray were saying that blacks are genetically inferior.

1:03:53.840 --> 1:04:00.320
 That was the take home message. And if they weren't saying it, they were implying it because they had

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:09.600
 a chapter that discussed this empirical observation of a difference. And isn't this horrible?

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:16.560
 And so the reaction to that book was incendiary.

1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:27.440
 What do we know about from that book and the research beyond about race differences

1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:35.680
 and intelligence? It's still the most incendiary topic in psychology. Nothing has changed that.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:43.520
 Anybody who even discusses it is easily called a racist just for discussing it. It's become

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:50.960
 fashionable to find racism in any discussion like this. It's unfortunate.

1:04:53.360 --> 1:05:00.880
 The short answer to your question is there's been very little actual research on this topic

1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:13.280
 since the Belcher even before. This really became incendiary in 1969 with an article

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:18.960
 published by an educational psychologist named Arthur Jensen. Let's just take a minute and go

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:24.240
 back to that to see the bell curve in a little bit more historical perspective.

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:30.480
 Arthur Jensen was an educational psychologist at UC Berkeley. I knew him as well.

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:42.960
 In 1969 or 1968, the Harvard Educational Review asked him to do a review article on the

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:53.280
 early childhood education programs that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.

1:05:53.280 --> 1:06:00.800
 This was before the federally funded Head Start program. Head Start had not really gotten under

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:07.440
 way at the time Jensen undertook his review of what were a number of demonstration programs.

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:16.560
 These demonstration programs were for young children around kindergarten age and they were

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:25.200
 specially designed to be cognitively stimulating to provide lunches, do all the things that people

1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:34.640
 thought would minimize this average gap of intelligence tests. There was a strong belief

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:41.840
 among virtually all psychologists that the cause of the gap was unequal opportunity due to racism,

1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:50.000
 due to all negative things in the society, and if you could compensate for this, the gap would

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.960
 go away. Early childhood education back then was called literally compensatory education.

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:03.600
 Jensen looked at these programs. He was an empirical guy. He understood psychometrics

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:13.120
 and he wrote a, it was over a hundred page article detailing these programs and the flaws

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:19.680
 in their research design. Some of the programs reported IQ gains on average five points,

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:27.040
 but a few reported 10, 20, and even 30 point gains. One was called the miracle in Milwaukee.

1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:34.720
 That investigator went to jail ultimately for fabricating data, but the point is that Jensen

1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:40.640
 wrote an article that said, look, the opening sentence of his article is classic. The opening

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:47.040
 sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right, but it's, we have tried compensatory education

1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:56.080
 and it has failed. He showed that these gains were essentially nothing. You couldn't really

1:07:56.080 --> 1:08:03.360
 document empirically any gains at all from these really earnest efforts to increase IQ,

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:12.320
 but he went a step further, a fateful step further. He said, not only have these efforts failed,

1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:18.320
 but because they have had essentially no impact, we have to reexamine our assumption

1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:24.320
 that these differences are caused by environmental things that we can address with education.

1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:31.440
 We need to consider a genetic influence, whether there's a genetic influence on this group

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:36.800
 difference. You said that this is one of the more controversial works. I think it's the most

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:46.320
 infamous paper in all of psychology, I would go on to say, because in 1969, the genetic data was

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.640
 very skimpy on this question, skimpy and controversial. It's always been controversial,

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:56.400
 but it was even skimpy and controversial. It's kind of a long story that I go into a little bit

1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:05.040
 in more detail in the book Neuroscience of Intelligence, but to say he was vilified is

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:10.400
 an understatement. I mean, he couldn't talk it at the American Psychological Association

1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:18.160
 without bomb threats clearing the lecture hall. Campus security watched him all the time. They

1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:28.640
 opened his mail. He had to retreat to a different address. This was one of the earliest kinds.

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:36.880
 This is before the internet and kind of internet social media mobs, but it was that intense.

1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:47.040
 I have written that overnight after the publication of this article, all intelligence

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:58.080
 research became radioactive. Nobody wanted to talk about it. Nobody was doing more research,

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:06.240
 and then the bell curve came along. The Jensen controversy was dying down. I have stories

1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:10.720
 that Jensen told me about his interaction with the Nixon White House on this issue.

1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:17.280
 I mean, this was like a really big deal. It was some unbelievable stories, but he told

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:25.440
 me this, so I kind of believe these stories. Nonetheless, 25 years later, all the silence

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:33.600
 basically saying that nobody wants to do this kind of research. There's so much pressure,

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:42.320
 so much attack against this kind of research, and here's sort of bold, stupid, crazy people that

1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:47.520
 decided to dive right back in. I wonder how much discussion that was. Do we include this chapter

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:54.400
 or not? Murray has said they discussed it and they felt they should include it,

1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:00.720
 and they were very careful in the way they wrote it, which did them no good.

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:09.120
 So, as a matter of fact, when the bell curve came out, it was so controversial. I got a call

1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:16.640
 from a television show called Nightline. It was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel.

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:21.840
 We had this evening show, I think it was on late at night, talked about news. It was a

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:28.720
 straight up news thing, and a producer called and asked if I would be on it to talk about

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:36.480
 the bell curve, and I said, you know, she asked me what I thought about the bell curve as a book,

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:42.000
 and I said, look, it's a very good book. It talks about the role of intelligence in society,

1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.160
 and she said, no, no, what do you think about the chapter on race? That's what we want you to

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:57.040
 talk about. I remember this conversation. I said, well, she said, what would you say if you were

1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:06.160
 on TV? And I said, well, what I would say is that it's not at all clear if there's any genetic

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:17.360
 component to intelligence, any differences, but if there were a strong genetic component,

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:24.400
 that would be a good thing. And, you know, complete silence on the other end of the phone.

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:31.440
 Yeah. And she said, well, what do you mean? And I said, well, if it's the more genetic any

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:39.120
 difference is, the more it's biological. And if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it.

1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:43.600
 I see. That's interesting. She said, would you say that on television?

1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:47.280
 Yes. I said, no. And so that was the end of that.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:13:00.560
 So that's for more like biology is within the reach of science. And the environment

1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:06.880
 is a public policy is social and all those kinds of things. From your perspective,

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:12.240
 whichever one you think is more amenable to solutions in the short term is the one that

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:23.600
 excites you. But you saying that it's good. The truth of genetic differences, no matter what,

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:35.120
 the between groups is a painful, harmful, potentially, potentially dangerous thing.

1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:41.840
 So let me ask you to this question. Well, there's bell curve or any research on race differences.

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:50.240
 Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world? Can that be used to

1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:54.240
 increase the amount of hate in the world? Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:58.160
 I've thought about this a lot, not as a scientist, but as a person.

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:13.200
 And my sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism that have nothing to do with

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:23.120
 scientific knowledge of the data that speak against that. That no, I don't want to give

1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:29.840
 racist groups of veto power over what scientists study. If you think that the differences,

1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:36.080
 and by the way, virtually no one disagrees that there are differences in scores. It's all about

1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:42.720
 what causes them and how to fix it. So if you think this is a cultural problem,

1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:49.200
 then you must ask the problem, what do you want to change anything about the culture?

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:54.000
 Or are you okay with the culture? Because you don't feel it's appropriate to change

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.600
 a person's culture. So are you okay with that? And the fact that that may lead to disadvantages

1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:06.400
 in school achievement? It's a question. If you think it's environmental, what are the

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:14.720
 environmental parameters that can be fixed? I'll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:22.960
 atmosphere, lead in paint, lead in water. That's an environmental toxin that society has the means

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:25.680
 to eliminate, and they should.

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:28.160
 Yeah, just to sort of trying to find some

1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:37.600
 insight and conclusion to this very difficult topic. Is there been research on environment

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:41.200
 versus genetics, nature versus nurture on this question of race differences?

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:48.400
 There is not, no one wants to do this research. First of all, it's hard research to do. Second

1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:54.000
 of all, it's a minefield. No one wants to spend their career on it. Tenured people don't want

1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:01.840
 to do it, let alone students. The way I talk about it, well, before I tell you the way I

1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:07.440
 talk about it, I want to say one more thing about Jensen. He was once asked by a journalist

1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:14.080
 straight out, are you a racist? His answer was very interesting. His answer was, I've thought

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:23.600
 about that a lot, and I've concluded it doesn't matter. Now, I know what he meant by this.

1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:25.760
 The guts to say that, wow.

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:30.400
 He was a very unusual person. I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome, to tell you the

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:34.000
 truth, because I saw him in many circumstances.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.600
 He would be canceled on Twitter immediately with that sentence.

1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:45.440
 What he meant was, he had a hypothesis. With respect to group differences, he called it

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:51.280
 the default hypothesis. He said, whatever factors affect individual intelligence are

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:56.320
 likely the same factors that affect group differences. It was the default, but it was a

1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:03.520
 hypothesis. It should be tested. If it turned out, empirical test didn't support the hypothesis.

1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:11.120
 He was happy to move on to something else. He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal.

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:18.640
 It's an empirical question. We should look at it, and let's see what happens.

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:24.480
 The scientific method cannot be racist from his perspective. It doesn't matter what the

1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:31.840
 scientists, if they follow the scientific method, it doesn't matter what they believe.

1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:38.560
 And if they are biased, and they consciously or unconsciously bias the data,

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:47.440
 other people will come along to replicate it, they will fail, and the process over time will work.

1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:55.920
 So let me push back on this idea, because psychology to me is full of gray areas.

1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:05.280
 And what I've observed about psychology, even replication crisis aside, is that something

1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:12.000
 about the media, something about journalism, something about the virality of ideas in the

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:21.440
 public sphere, they misinterpret. They take up things from studies willfully or from ignorance

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:29.680
 misinterpret findings, and tell narratives around that. I personally believe, for me,

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:35.760
 I'm not saying that broadly about science, but for me, it's my responsibility to anticipate

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:42.880
 the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted. So I've had, I thought about this a lot, because

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:53.840
 I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles, and those cars, people dying cars. There's people

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:58.800
 that have written me letters saying emails, nobody writes letters, I wish they did,

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:04.640
 that I have blood in my hands, because of things that I would say positive or negative,

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.480
 there's consequences. In the same way, when you're a researcher of intelligence,

1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:16.080
 I'm sure you might get emails, or at least people might believe that finding your study

1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:20.720
 is going to be used by a large number of people to increase the amount of hate in the world.

1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:28.000
 I think there's some responsibility on scientists. But for me, I think there's a great

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:36.560
 responsibility to anticipate the ways things will be misinterpreted. And there you have to,

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:42.160
 first of all, decide whether you want to say a thing at all, or do the study at all, publish

1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:50.240
 the study at all, and to the words with which you explain it. I find this on Twitter a lot,

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:59.120
 actually, which is when I write a tweet, and I'm usually just doing it so innocently, I'll write

1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:04.640
 it, it takes me like five seconds to write it, or whatever, 30 seconds to write it, and then I'll

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:11.360
 think, all right, I like close my eyes open, and try to see how will the world interpret this?

1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:15.840
 Like, what are the ways in which this will be misinterpreted? And I'll sometimes adjust that

1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:22.720
 tweet to see, like, yeah, so in my mind, it's clear, but that's because it's my mind from which

1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:29.120
 this tweet came. But you have to think in a fresh mind that sees this, and it's spread across

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:36.640
 a large number of other minds, how will the interpretation morph? I mean, for a tweet,

1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:44.480
 this is a silly thing, it doesn't matter. But for a scientific paper and study and finding,

1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:49.600
 I think it matters. So I don't know, well, I don't know what your thoughts about that,

1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:57.440
 because maybe for Jensen, the data is there, what do you want me to do? This is a scientific process

1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:03.600
 has been carried out. If you think the data was polluted by bias, do other studies that reveal

1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:14.400
 the bias? But the data is there. And like, I'm not a poet, I'm not a literary writer,

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:18.240
 like what do you want me to do? I'm just presenting you the data. What do you think on

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:24.400
 that spectrum? What's the role of a scientist? The reason I do podcasts, the reason I write

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:32.240
 books for the public is to explain what I think the data mean and what I think the data don't mean.

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:40.640
 I don't do very much on Twitter other than to retweet references to papers. I don't think it's

1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:50.080
 my role to explain these because they're complicated, they're nuanced. But when you decide not to do

1:21:50.080 --> 1:22:00.080
 a scientific study or not to publish a result because you're afraid the result could be harmful or

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:09.200
 insensitive, that's not an unreasonable thought. And people will make different conclusions and

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:16.880
 decisions about that. I wrote about this. I'm the editor of a journal called Intelligence,

1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:23.040
 which publishes scientific papers. Sometimes we publish papers on group differences.

1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:29.440
 Those papers sometimes are controversial. These papers are written for a scientific audience.

1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:35.200
 They're not written for the Twitter audience. I don't promote them very much on Twitter.

1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:45.760
 But in a scientific paper, you have to now choose your words carefully also because those papers

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:53.440
 are picked up by non scientists, by writers of various kinds. And you have to be available

1:22:53.440 --> 1:23:02.640
 to discuss what you're saying and what you're not saying. Sometimes you are successful at having

1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:10.480
 a good conversation like we are today that doesn't start out pejorative. Other times I've been asked

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:17.360
 to participate in debates where my role would be to justify race science. Well, you can see,

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:25.040
 just start out. And that was a BBC request that I received.

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:31.840
 I have so much, it's a love hate relationship, mostly hate with these shallow journalism

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:39.040
 organizations. So they would want to use you as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate

1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:44.960
 as to like, there is race differences between groups and make that into debate and put you in

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:50.960
 a role of... Justifying racism. That's what they're asking me to do.

1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:55.440
 Horses like educating about this field of the science of intelligence.

1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:02.800
 Yeah. I want to say one more thing before we get off the normal distribution. You also asked me,

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:09.440
 what is the science after the bell curve? And the short answer is there's not much new work,

1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:15.200
 but whatever work there is supports the idea that there still are group differences.

1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:23.600
 It's arguable whether those differences have diminished at all or not. And there is still

1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:32.400
 a major problem in underperformance for school achievement. For many disadvantaged and minority

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:39.040
 students. And there so far is no way to fix it. What do we do with this information?

1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:47.680
 Is this now a task now? We'll talk about the future on the neuroscience and the biology side,

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:53.360
 but in terms of this information as a society, in the public policy, in the political space,

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.840
 in the social space, what do we do with this information? I've thought a lot about this.

1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:06.240
 The first step is to have people interested in policy understand what the data actually show

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:14.480
 to pay attention to intelligence data. You can read policy papers about education and using

1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:20.160
 your word processor. You can search for the word intelligence. You can search a 20,000 word

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:27.840
 document in a second and find out the word intelligence does not appear anywhere in most

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:34.080
 discussions about what to do about achievement gaps. I'm not talking about test gaps. I'm talking

1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:41.040
 about actual achievement gaps in schools, which everyone agrees is a problem. The word intelligence

1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:48.160
 doesn't appear among educators. That's fascinating. As a matter of fact, in California, there has

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:53.680
 been tremendous controversy about recent attempts to revise the curriculum for math

1:25:54.400 --> 1:26:01.280
 in high schools. We had a Stanford professor of education who was running this review

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:10.400
 assert there's no such thing as talent, a mathematical talent. She wanted to get rid of

1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:16.480
 the advanced classes in math because not everyone could do that. Of course, this has been very

1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:22.240
 controversial. They've retreated somewhat. But the idea that a university professor was in charge

1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:33.520
 of this who believes that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist, this is rather shocking,

1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:39.280
 let alone the complete absence of intelligence data. By the way, let me tell you something about

1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:46.960
 what the intelligence data show. Let's take a race out of it. Even though the origins of these

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:55.280
 studies were a long time ago, I'm blocking on the name of the report, the Coleman report was a

1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:02.880
 famous report about education. They measured all kinds of variables about schools, about teachers,

1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:11.840
 and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome. They found the most predictive

1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:19.440
 variables of education outcome where the variables the student brought with him or her into the

1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:28.080
 school, essentially their ability. When you combine the school and the teacher variables

1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:33.520
 together, the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the teachers,

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:39.280
 their education, you put all the teacher and school variables together, it barely accounted for 10%

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:50.800
 of the variance. This has been replicated now. The best research we have shows that school

1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:57.920
 variables and teacher variables together account for about 10% of student academic achievement.

1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:05.840
 Now, you want to have some policy on improving academic achievement. How much money do you want

1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:12.960
 to put into teacher education? How much money do you want to put into the quality of the school

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:18.880
 administration? You know who you can ask? You can ask the Gates Foundation because they spend a

1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:25.040
 tremendous amount of money doing that. At the end of it, because they're measurement people,

1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:31.920
 they want to know the data, they found it had no impact at all. They've pulled out of that

1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:42.640
 kind of program. Let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's just the two of us.

1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:49.040
 Just the two of us, but I'm going to say some funny and ridiculous things. You're surely not

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:58.000
 approving of it. There's a movie called Clerks. I've seen it. There's a funny scene in there

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.040
 where a lovely couple are talking about the number of previous sexual partners they had.

1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:11.680
 The woman says that, I believe she just had a handful, like two or three or something like that,

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:19.520
 sexual partners, but then she also mentioned that she, what's that called, a fallacious? What's

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:29.600
 the scientific? She gave a blow job to 37 guys, I believe it is. That has to do with the truth.

1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:40.640
 Sometimes knowing the truth can get in the way of a successful relationship of love of some of

1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:48.480
 the human flourishing. That seems to me that's at the core here, that facing some kind of

1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:55.600
 truth that's not able to be changed, it makes it difficult to sort of,

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:04.880
 is limiting as opposed to empowering. That's the concern. If you sort of test for intelligence

1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:12.400
 and lay the data out, it feels like you will give up on certain people. You will sort of

1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:18.880
 start bidding people as like, well, this person is like, let's focus on the average people,

1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:24.640
 or let's focus on the very intelligent people. That's the concern. There's a kind of

1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:32.960
 intuition that if we just don't measure and we don't use that data, that we would treat everybody

1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:40.560
 equal and give everybody equal opportunity. If we have the data in front of us, we're likely to

1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:49.280
 misdistribute the amount of sort of attention we allocate, resources we allocate to people.

1:30:49.280 --> 1:30:57.040
 That's probably the concern. It's a realistic concern, but I think it's a misplaced concern

1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:02.800
 if you want to fix the problem. If you want to fix the problem, you have to know what the

1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:09.520
 problem is. Now, let me tell you this. Let's go back to the bell curve, not the bell curve,

1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:18.400
 but the normal distribution. 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,

1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:26.640
 which means they're very hard. If you have an IQ under 85, it's very hard to find gainful employment

1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:36.640
 at a salary that sustains you at least minimally in modern life. Not impossible, but it's very

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:45.840
 difficult. 16% of the population of the United States is about 51 or 52 million people with

1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:58.800
 IQs under 85. This is not a small issue. 14 million children have IQs under 85. Is this something we

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:08.480
 want to ignore? What is the Venn diagram between when you have people with IQs under 85 and you

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:17.920
 have achievement in school or achievement in life? There's a lot of overlap there. This is why,

1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:28.640
 to go back to the IQ pill, if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end, that

1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:36.000
 would have a big impact. If I could maybe before we talk about the impact on life and so on,

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:42.480
 some of the criticisms of the bell curve. Stephen Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:47.920
 rests on four incorrect assumptions. It would be just interesting to get your thoughts on the four

1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:53.360
 assumptions, which are intelligence must be reducible to a single number, intelligence must

1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:59.520
 be capable of rank ordering people in a linear order, intelligence must be primarily genetically

1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:06.800
 based and intelligence must be essentially immutable. Maybe not as criticisms, but as

1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:12.720
 thoughts about intelligence. We could spend a lot of time on him.

1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:24.960
 Stephen Jay Gould wrote that in what about 1985, 1984? His views were overtly political,

1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:30.560
 not scientific. He was a scientist, but his views on this were overtly political,

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:38.160
 and I would encourage people listening to this if they really want to understand his criticisms.

1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:48.880
 They should just Google what he had to say and Google the scientific reviews of his book,

1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:55.440
 The Mismeasure of Man, and they will take these statements apart. They were wrong,

1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:03.120
 not only were they wrong, but when he asserted in his first book that there was no biological

1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:11.520
 basis essentially to IQ. By the time the second edition came around, there were studies of MRIs

1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:17.680
 of showing that brain size, brain volume were correlated to IQ scores, which he declined to

1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:26.000
 put in his book. I'm learning a lot today. I didn't know the extent of his work. I was just

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:30.880
 using a few little snippets of criticism. That's interesting. There's a battle here. He wrote

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:36.240
 a book, Mismeasure of Man, that's missing a lot of these scientific groundings.

1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:42.000
 His book is highly popular in colleges today. You can find it in any college bookstore under

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:46.560
 assigned reading. It's highly popular. The Mismeasure of Man? Yes, highly influential.

1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.040
 Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man? I'm undereducated about this. So what is this the

1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:56.560
 book basically criticizing the ideas in the bulk of it? Yeah, where those four things came from.

1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:05.760
 And it is really a book that was really taken apart point by point by a number of people who

1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:11.280
 actually understood the data. And he didn't care. He didn't care. He didn't modify anything.

1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:17.920
 It's a politically, listen, because this is such a sensitive topic, like I said, I believe

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:29.600
 the impact of the work as it is misinterpreted has to be considered because it's not just

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:33.920
 going to be scientific discourse. It's going to be political discourse. There's going to be

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:40.400
 debates. There's going to be politically motivated people that will use messages in

1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:51.440
 each direction, make something like the bulk of the enemy or the support for one's racist beliefs.

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:59.440
 And so I think you have to consider that, but it's difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:09.040
 to justify a lot of his beliefs. And it's not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler or

1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:15.040
 how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil. But there's a balance there. So I

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.680
 understand. This is really interesting. I didn't know. Is there any criticism of the book you

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:24.240
 find compelling or interesting or challenging to use from a scientific perspective? There were

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:31.760
 factual criticisms about the nature of the statistics that were used, the statistical

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:37.360
 analyses. These are more technical criticisms. And they were addressed by Murray in a couple

1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:43.200
 of articles where he took all the criticisms and spoke to them. And people listening to this

1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:50.320
 podcast can certainly find all those online. And it's very interesting. But Murray went on

1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:57.200
 to write some additional books, two in the last couple of years, one about human diversity,

1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:05.440
 where he goes through the data refuting the idea that race is only a social construct

1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:11.120
 with no biological meaning. He discusses the data. It's a very good discussion. You don't

1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:18.560
 have to agree with it. But he presents data in a cogent way. And he talks about the critics of

1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:26.080
 that. And he talks about their data in a cogent, not personal way. It's a very informative

1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:31.280
 discussion. The book is called Human Diversity. He talks about race. And he talks about gender.

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:38.240
 Same thing, about sex differences. And more recently, he's written what might be his final

1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:48.560
 say on this, a book called Facing Reality, where he talks about this again. So he can certainly

1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:55.360
 defend himself. He doesn't need me to do that. But I would urge people who have heard about

1:37:55.360 --> 1:38:03.680
 him and the bell curve and who think they know what's in it. You are likely incorrect. And you

1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:12.480
 need to read it for yourself. But it is, scientifically, it's a serious subject. It's a

1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:18.720
 difficult subject. Ethically, it's a difficult subject. Everything you said here calmly and

1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:26.400
 thoughtfully is difficult. It's difficult for me to even consider that G factor exists. I

1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:32.400
 don't mean from like, that somehow G factors inherently racist or sexist or whatever. It's

1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:38.080
 just, it's difficult in the way that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult,

1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:47.760
 that we are limited by our biology is difficult. And it's at least from an American perspective,

1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:50.480
 you like to believe that everything is possible in this world.

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:57.920
 Well, that leads us to what I think we should do with this information.

1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:05.440
 And what I think we should do with this information is unusual.

1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:14.160
 Because I think what we need to do is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular biology

1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:24.240
 of learning and memory. Because one definition of intelligence is based on how much you can

1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:29.920
 learn and how much you can remember. And if you accept that definition of intelligence,

1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:40.720
 then there are molecular studies going on now. And Nobel Prize is being won on molecular biology

1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:48.480
 or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory. Now, the step those researchers,

1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:55.680
 those scientists need to take when it comes to intelligence, is to focus on the concept of

1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:05.360
 individual differences. Intelligence research has individual differences as its heart, because it

1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:13.520
 assumes that people differ on this variable. And those differences are meaningful and need

1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:21.680
 understanding. Cognitive psychologists who have morphed into molecular biologists studying

1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:28.320
 learning and memory hate the concept of individual differences historically. Some now are coming

1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:38.560
 around to it. I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner for his work on memory. And I asked him

1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:44.240
 about individual differences. And he said, don't go there. It'll set us back 50 years.

1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:52.400
 But I said, don't you think they're the key, though, to understand why can some people remember

1:40:52.400 --> 1:40:58.640
 more than others? He said, you don't want to go there. I think the 21st century will be remembered

1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:05.440
 by the technology and the science that goes to individual differences. Because we have now data,

1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:09.040
 we have now the tools to much, much better to start to measure, start to estimate,

1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:17.600
 not just on the sort of through tests and IQ test type of things, sort of outside the body

1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:21.520
 kind of things, but measuring all kinds of stuff about the body. So you had to truly go into the

1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:30.000
 molecular biology, to the neurobiology, to the neuroscience. Let me ask you about in this life.

1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:38.960
 How does intelligence correlate with or lead to or has anything to do with career success?

1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:44.640
 You've mentioned these kinds of things. And is there any data, you've had an excellent conversation

1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:52.640
 with Jordan Peterson, for example. Is there any data on what intelligence means for success in life?

1:41:53.360 --> 1:42:04.160
 Success in life. There is a tremendous amount of validity data that looked at intelligence test

1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:14.960
 scores and various measures of life success. Now, of course, life success is a pretty broad

1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:26.240
 topic. And not everybody agrees on what success means. But there's general agreement on certain

1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:35.040
 aspects of success that can be measured. Including life expectancy, like you said.

1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:46.320
 Life expectancy. Now, there's life success. Life expectancy. I mean, that is such an

1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:55.520
 interesting finding. But IQ scores are also correlated to things like income. Now, okay,

1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:03.600
 so who thinks income means you're successful? That's not the point. The point is that income is one

1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:10.800
 empirical measure in this culture that says something about your level of success.

1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:18.480
 You can define success in ways that have nothing to do with income. You can define success based

1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:29.680
 on your evolutionary natural selection success. But for variables, and even that, by the way,

1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:41.440
 is correlated to IQ in some studies. So however you want to define success, IQ is important.

1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:46.640
 It's not the only determinant. People get hung up on, well, what about personality?

1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:52.960
 What about so called emotional intelligence? Yes, all those things matter. The thing that matters

1:43:53.520 --> 1:44:00.240
 empirically, the single thing that matters the most is your general ability, your general mental

1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:08.240
 intellectual ability, your reasoning ability. And the more complex your vocation, the more complex

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:16.240
 your job, the more G matters. G doesn't matter and a lot of occupations don't require complex thinking.

1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:22.480
 And there are occupations like that and G doesn't matter. Within an occupation,

1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:32.720
 the G might not matter so much. So that if you look at all the professors at MIT

1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:42.240
 and had a way to rank order them, there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying.

1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:50.320
 When you get past a certain threshold, then there's impact on wealth, for example, or career

1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:56.160
 success, however that's defined in each individual discipline. But after a certain point, it doesn't

1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:03.040
 matter. Actually, it does matter in certain things. So for example, there is a very classic study

1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:09.680
 that was started at Johns Hopkins when I was a graduate student there. I actually worked on

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:14.320
 this study at the very beginning. It's the study of mathematically and scientifically precocious

1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:27.280
 youth. And they gave junior high school students, age 11 and 12, the standard SAT math exam. And

1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:35.120
 they found a very large number of students scored very high on this exam, not a large number. I

1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:41.520
 mean, they found many students when they cast the net, they're all a Baltimore, they found a number

1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:48.400
 of students who scored as high on the SAT math when they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins

1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:58.240
 freshmen. And they said, gee, now, this is interesting. What shall we do now? And on a

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:04.640
 case by case basis, they got some of those kids into their local community college math programs.

1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:13.440
 Many of those kids went on to be very successful. And now there's a 50 year follow up of those kids.

1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:23.520
 And it turns out, these kids were in the top 1%. Okay, so everybody in this study is in the top

1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:29.760
 1%. If you take that group, that rarefied group and divide them into quartiles,

1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:40.720
 so you have the top 25% of the top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%, you can find

1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:51.600
 on measurable variables of success, the top quartile does better than the bottom quartile.

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:58.000
 In the top 1%, they have more patents, they have more publications, they have more tenure

1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:04.880
 at universities. And this is based on their, you're dividing them based on their score at age 12.

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:13.280
 I wonder how much interesting data is in the variability in the differences. But that's

1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:21.840
 boy, that's very interesting, but it's also, I don't know, somehow painful. I don't know why it's

1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:30.960
 so painful that that's so that G factor, so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:36.560
 This is interesting that you find that painful. Do you find it painful that people with charisma

1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:42.880
 are very successful, can be very successful in life, even though having no other attributes other

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:50.240
 than their famous and people like them? Do you find that painful? Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.

1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:56.880
 So one of the things, again, this is like, I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial, but

1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:03.040
 one of the things the psychologist, the personality psychologist, he can maybe speak

1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:10.160
 to this because he had interest in this for time, is she was saying that personality,

1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:17.280
 technically speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime. It's the

1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:21.520
 the, it's the thing you're, I don't know if she was actually implying that you're born with it.

1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:28.000
 Well, it's a trait. It's a trait. It's a trait that's relatively stable over time. I think that's

1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:34.000
 generally correct. So to the degree your personality is stable over time, yes, that too

1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:43.280
 is painful. Because what's not painful is the thing, if I'm fat, not of shape, I can exercise

1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:51.520
 and, you know, become healthier in that way. If my diet is a giant mess and that's resulting in

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:57.040
 some kind of conditions that my body is experiencing, I can fix that by having a better diet.

1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:05.360
 That's sort of my actions, my willed actions can make a change. If charisma is part of the

1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:11.440
 personality, that's the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that is stable.

1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:18.480
 Well, yeah, yeah, that's painful too. Because it's like, oh, shit, I'm stuck with this. I'm

1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:24.880
 stuck with this. Well, I mean, and this pretty much generalizes to every aspect of your being.

1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:30.320
 This is who you are. You've got to deal with it. And what it undermines, of course, is a realistic

1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:41.040
 appreciation for this undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country, that if you

1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:47.760
 work hard, you can be anything you want to be, which has morphed from the original idea that if

1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:55.200
 you work hard, you can be successful. Those are two different things. And now we have,

1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:04.400
 if you work hard, you can be anything you want to be. This is completely unrealistic. I'm sorry,

1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:07.440
 it just is. Now you can work hard and be successful. There's no question.

1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:13.840
 But you know what? I could work very hard and I am not going to be a successful

1:50:14.960 --> 1:50:17.920
 theoretical physicist. I'm just not.

1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:24.000
 That said, I mean, we should, because we had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat.

1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:29.360
 The fact that you're not going to be a theoretical physicist,

1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.640
 it's not judgment on your basic humanity. Returning again to the all men,

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:40.960
 which means men and women are created equal. So again, some of the differences we're talking

1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:51.120
 about in quote unquote, success, wealth, number of, whether you win a Nobel Prize or not, that doesn't

1:50:53.040 --> 1:51:01.760
 put a measure on your basic humanity and basic value and even goodness of you as a human being.

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:10.560
 Because that, that your basic role and value in society is largely within your control.

1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:17.840
 It's some of these measures that we're talking about. It's good. It's good to remember this.

1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:26.160
 One question about the Flynn effect. What is it? Are humans getting smarter over the years,

1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:33.040
 over the decades, over the centuries? The Flynn effect is James Flynn, who passed away about

1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:43.360
 a year ago, published a set of analyses. According back a couple of decades,

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:52.800
 when he first noticed this, that IQ scores when you looked over the years seemed to be drifting up.

1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:59.280
 Now, this was not unknown to the people who make the test because they

1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:06.080
 renorm the test periodically and they have to renorm the test periodically because what

1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:16.080
 10 items correct meant relative to other people 50 years ago is not the same as what 10 items mean

1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:23.520
 relative today. People are getting more things correct. Now, the scores have been drifting up

1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:30.720
 about three points. IQ scores have been drifting up about three points per decade. This is not a

1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:36.560
 personal effect. This is a cohort effect. Well, it's not for an individual. But

1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:42.960
 the world, so what's the explanation? This has presented intelligence researchers with a great

1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:52.320
 mystery. Two questions. First, is it effect on the 50% of the variance that's the G factor

1:52:52.320 --> 1:53:01.600
 or on the other 50% and there's evidence that it is a G factor effect. Second, what on earth

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:08.960
 causes this and doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor cannot be genetic because the scale of

1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:17.040
 natural selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. And so it's been used

1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:23.120
 to try to undermine the idea that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence.

1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:30.720
 But certainly it can be the Flynn effect can affect the non genetic aspects of intelligence

1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:38.880
 because genes account for maybe 50% of the variance, maybe higher, it could be as high as 80%

1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:48.320
 for adults, but let's just say 50% for discussion. So the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery.

1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:55.440
 It's still a mystery. Although the evidence is coming out, I told you before I edited a

1:53:55.440 --> 1:54:01.440
 journal on intelligence and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn. So I'm starting

1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:08.880
 to see papers now and really the latest research on this. I think most people who specialize in

1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:15.840
 this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect are coming to the view based on data

1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:24.560
 that it has to do with advances in nutrition and healthcare. And there's also evidence

1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:29.440
 that the effect is slowing down and possibly reversing.

1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:40.000
 Oh boy. So how would nutrition, nutrition would still be connected to the G factor. So nutrition

1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:43.840
 as it relates to the G factor, so the biology that leads to the intelligence.

1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:52.080
 Yes. That would be the claim. The hypothesis being tested by the research.

1:54:52.080 --> 1:55:01.120
 Yes. And there's some evidence from infants that nutrition has made a difference. So it's not an

1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:07.680
 unreasonable connection, but does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence,

1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:15.040
 not logically at all. But it is very interesting so that if you take an IQ test today,

1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:23.920
 but you take the score and use the tables that were available in 1940,

1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:32.480
 you're going to wind up with a much higher IQ number. So are we really smarter than a couple

1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:39.440
 of generations ago? No, but we might be able to solve problems a little better

1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:47.840
 and make use of our G because of things like Sesame Street and other curricula in school.

1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:55.520
 More people are going to school. So there are a lot of factors here that disentangle.

1:55:55.520 --> 1:56:04.960
 It's fascinating that there's not clear answers yet that as a population we're getting smarter.

1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:08.240
 When you just zoom out, that's what it looks like as a population getting smarter. It's

1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:12.560
 interesting to see what the effects of that are. I mean, this raises the question. We've

1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:18.800
 mentioned it many times, but haven't clearly addressed it, which is nature versus nurture

1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:24.480
 question. So how much of intelligence is nature? How much of it is nurture? How much of it is

1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:31.360
 determined by genetics versus environment? All of it. All of it is genetics. No, all of it

1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:36.960
 is nature and nurture. Yes. Okay.

1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:45.840
 But how much of variance can you apportion to either? Yeah. Most of the people who work in

1:56:45.840 --> 1:56:55.200
 this field say that if the question is framed that way, it can't be answered because nature

1:56:55.200 --> 1:57:02.080
 and nurture are not too independent influences. They interact with each other and understanding

1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:12.480
 those interactions is so complex that many behavioral geneticists say it is today impossible

1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:20.240
 and always will be impossible to disentangle that no matter what kind of advances there are in DNA

1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:26.480
 technology and genomic informatics. But there's still to push back on that.

1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:33.680
 That same intuition from behavioral geneticists would lead me to believe that there cannot

1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:40.880
 possibly be a stable G factor because it's super complex. Many of them would assert that

1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:50.320
 that as a logical outcome. But because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources

1:57:50.320 --> 1:57:59.280
 of data, not just one study, but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the

1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:08.400
 idea that whatever interactions between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated,

1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:18.640
 they can be studied, and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of

1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:26.480
 intelligence. And we'll do this exact question because doesn't the stability of the G factor

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:33.760
 give you at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?

1:58:33.760 --> 1:58:42.800
 Yes, I think it's clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness

1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:55.360
 of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain, that identical

1:58:55.360 --> 1:59:05.680
 twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores. These are all important observations

1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:14.080
 that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that there's a biological basis. And does anyone

1:59:14.080 --> 1:59:20.080
 believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain? I mean, it's so obvious.

1:59:20.080 --> 1:59:26.720
 Well, indirectly definitely has to do with it. But the question is environment interacting with

1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:33.680
 the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?

1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:44.720
 Well, some would say that the raw hardware of the brain, as it develops from conception

1:59:44.720 --> 1:59:52.640
 through adulthood, or at least through the childhood, that that so called hardware that

1:59:52.640 --> 2:00:00.880
 you are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think,

2:00:00.880 --> 2:00:07.840
 that it is probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment

2:00:07.840 --> 2:00:18.960
 and other factors like that, including chance, that chance affects the way the neurons are

2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:30.400
 connecting during gestation. It's not, hey, it's pre programmed. So there is pushback on the concept

2:00:30.400 --> 2:00:38.880
 that genes provide a blueprint that is a lot more fluid. Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot,

2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:50.080
 a lot, a lot happens in the first few months of development. So for in nine months, inside the

2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:57.440
 mother's body and in the, you know, the months, the few months afterwards, there's a lot of

2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:02.640
 fascinating stuff, like including chance and luck, like you said, how things connect up.

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:08.400
 Man, the question is afterwards in your plasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is

2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:13.120
 relative to the environment, how much that affects the G factor, but that's where the

2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:19.440
 whole conclusions of the studies that we've been talking about is that seems to have less and less

2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:28.320
 and less of an effect is pretty quickly. Yes. And I do think there is more of a genetic, my view,

2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:34.320
 and I'm not an expert on this. I mean, genetics is a highly technical and complex subject. I am

2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:42.720
 not a geneticist, not a behavioral geneticist. But my reading of this, my interpretation of this,

2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:51.200
 is that there is a genetic blueprint more or less, and that has a profound influence on your

2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:59.760
 subsequent intellectual development, including the G factor. And that's not to say things can't happen

2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:08.640
 to, I mean, if you think of that genes provide a potential, fine, and that various variables

2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:15.920
 impact that potential. And every parent of a newborn implicitly or explicitly

2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:22.720
 wants to maximize that potential. This is why you buy educational toys. This is why you pay

2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:29.760
 it attention to organic baby food. This is why you do all these things because you want your

2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:35.200
 baby to be as healthy and as smart as possible. And every parent will say that.

2:02:35.200 --> 2:02:41.440
 Is there a case to be made? Can you steal me on the case that genetics

2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:49.360
 is a very tiny component of all of this, and the environment is essential?

2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:55.040
 I don't think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component. I think the data support the idea

2:02:55.040 --> 2:03:00.000
 that the genetics is a very important, and I don't say component, I say influence,

2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.800
 a very important influence. And the environment is a lot less than people believe.

2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:11.440
 Most people believe environment plays a big role. I'm not so sure.

2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:18.080
 I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where what you just said it might be wrong?

2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:24.960
 Can you imagine a world and what kind of evidence would you need to see

2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:31.120
 to say, you know what, the intuition, the study so far, like reversing the direction.

2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:36.400
 So one of the cool things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data, and the

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:44.240
 rate of the data is escalating because of the digital world. So when you start to look at a

2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:50.720
 very large scale of data, both from the biology side and the social side, we might be discovering

2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:57.920
 some very counterintuitive things about society. We might see the edge cases that reveal that if

2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:04.400
 we actually scale those edge cases and they become like the norm, that we'll have a complete shift

2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:14.640
 in our, like you'll see G factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens and later

2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:20.720
 life. So in any case you can make or for your current intuitions are wrong.

2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.560
 Yes, and it's a good question because I think everyone should always be asked

2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:30.960
 what evidence would change your mind. It's certainly not only a fair question, it is really

2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:39.760
 the key question for anybody working on any aspect of science. I think that if environment

2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:47.520
 was very important, we would have seen it clearly by now. It would have been obvious

2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:53.440
 that school interventions, compensatory education, early childhood education,

2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:59.360
 all these things that have been earnestly tried and well funded, well designed studies

2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:05.600
 would show some effect and they don't. They don't. What if the school, the way we've tried school,

2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:09.680
 compensatory school sucks and we need to do that. That's what everybody said at the beginning.

2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:16.240
 That's what everybody said to Jensen. He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier. Maybe we need

2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:23.200
 not do pre kindergarten, but pre pre kindergarten. It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't

2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:32.240
 get it right. But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something

2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:39.360
 would have worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability

2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:47.520
 level at 0.05 on some means. That's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.

2:05:48.560 --> 2:05:57.040
 Population level interventions like schooling that you would see like this actually has an

2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:05.120
 effect. When you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when those

2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:10.560
 adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their adoptive

2:06:10.560 --> 2:06:16.800
 parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents whom they've

2:06:16.800 --> 2:06:25.840
 never met. These are powerful observations. It would be convincing to you if the reverse

2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:31.360
 was true. Yes, that would be more. There is some data on adoption that indicates

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:38.880
 the adopted children are moving a little bit more toward their adoptive parents.

2:06:42.160 --> 2:06:46.480
 To me, the overwhelming, I have this concept called the weight of evidence

2:06:47.200 --> 2:06:53.280
 where I don't interpret any one study too much. The weight of evidence tells me genes are important.

2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:57.840
 But what does that mean? What does it mean that genes are important? Knowing that gene

2:06:57.840 --> 2:07:05.600
 expression, genes don't express themselves in a vacuum. They express themselves in an environment.

2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:11.920
 So the environment has to have something to do with it, especially if the best genetic estimates of

2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:18.400
 the amount of variance are around 50 or even if it's as high as 80 percent, it still leaves 20

2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:26.720
 percent of non genetic. Now, maybe that is all luck. Maybe that's all chance. I could believe that.

2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:36.080
 I could easily believe that. But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:42.560
 and nothing works, including memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing

2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:48.880
 computer games, none of that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:57.040
 Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?

2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:07.520
 Yes. And there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents IQ and the environment.

2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:17.120
 High IQ parents provide an enriched environment which then can impact the child in addition to

2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:21.840
 the genes. It's that environment. So there are all these interactions that,

2:08:23.680 --> 2:08:30.160
 but think about the number of books in a household. This was a variable that's

2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:39.520
 correlated with IQ. Well, why? Especially if the kid never reads any of the books.

2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:46.720
 It's because more intelligent people have more books in their house. And if you're more intelligent

2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:55.040
 and there's a genetic component to that, the child will get those genes or some of those genes,

2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:00.400
 as well as the environment. But it's not the number of books in the house that

2:09:01.040 --> 2:09:07.120
 actually directly impacts the child. So the two scenarios on this are you find that,

2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:15.200
 and this was used to get rid of the SAT test. Oh, the SAT scores highly correlated with the

2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:20.800
 social economic status of the parents. So all you're really measuring is how rich the parents are.

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:24.320
 Okay. Well, why are the parents rich?

2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:35.680
 Yes. And so you could, the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright

2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:44.320
 make more money. They can afford homes in better neighborhoods so their kids get better schools.

2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:53.120
 Now the kids grow up bright. Where in that chain of events does that come from? Well, unless you

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:59.600
 have a genetically informative research design where you look at siblings that have the same

2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:07.200
 biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that. Most studies of social

2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:15.440
 economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed design. So any conclusions

2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:21.920
 they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause of the IQ

2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:29.520
 is a stretch. And where you do find genetically informative designs,

2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:38.720
 you find most of the variance in your outcome measures are due to the genetic component,

2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:47.040
 and sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very much

2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:53.840
 variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance. So when you actually look at

2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:59.760
 it in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically informed designs,

2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:05.280
 but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:08.480
 Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between

2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:20.000
 fertility or the number of kids that you have and G factor? So the kind of conventional wisdom is

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:27.760
 people of maybe is it higher economic status or something like that or having fewer children?

2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.840
 I just loosely hear these kinds of things. Is there data that you're aware of in one direction

2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:38.640
 or another on this? Strange questions always get strange answers.

2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:44.560
 Yes. Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?

2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:51.600
 The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family,

2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:59.760
 the firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.

2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:07.680
 It's not clear that those studies hold up over time. And of course, what you see also

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:16.400
 is that families where there are multiple children, four, five, six, seven, really big families,

2:12:20.640 --> 2:12:26.400
 the social economic status of those families usually in the modern age is not that high.

2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:33.280
 Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids. I'm not sure exactly.

2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:41.200
 But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility.

2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:50.320
 But I'm not sure that the data are very strong, that the firstborn child is always the smartest.

2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:54.800
 It seems like there's some data to that, but I'm not current on that.

2:12:54.800 --> 2:12:57.920
 How would that be explained? That would be a nurture.

2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:03.280
 Well, it could be a nurture. It could be in uterine environment. I mean...

2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:05.920
 Boy, the biology is complicated.

2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:14.320
 And this is why this... Like many areas of science, you said earlier that there are a lot

2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:25.680
 of gray areas and no definitive answers. This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look

2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:34.720
 at a problem, the more questions you get, not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated.

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:43.600
 And the idea that we have people on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang,

2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:52.400
 that's pretty amazing. And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds

2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:58.160
 of the Big Bang, we can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.

2:13:58.800 --> 2:14:04.320
 I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.

2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:09.440
 It's unclear to me. I think we over emphasize...

2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:10.960
 Well, that's a very humbling statement.

2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:17.840
 Maybe it's very human centric, egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super complicated.

2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:24.960
 But biology is a trick you want to unravel consciousness. What is that?

2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:34.160
 I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real fundamental

2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:40.320
 problems of the human brain. And therefore, I think they must be related.

2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:48.880
 Part problems like walk together, holding hands, kind of idea.

2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:54.720
 You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain imaging,

2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:00.000
 trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off when someone loses

2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:06.240
 consciousness and is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is regained?

2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:11.600
 And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire. He was really brilliant at this.

2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:17.360
 These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography

2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:27.200
 long before fMRI. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain and

2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:32.080
 the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up. And then you could make a picture

2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:41.680
 of glucose use in the brain. And he was amazing. He managed to do this in normal volunteers he

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:50.080
 brought in and anesthetized as if they were going into surgery. He managed all the human

2:15:50.080 --> 2:16:00.960
 subjects requirements on this research. And he was brilliant at this. And what we did is we had

2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:07.840
 these normal volunteers come in on three occasions. On one occasion, he gave them enough anesthetic

2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:18.160
 drug so they were a little drowsy. And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anesthetized

2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:33.040
 them. And he would say, Mike, can you hear me? And the person would say, yeah. And then we would

2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:41.920
 scan people and under no anesthetic condition. So the same person. And we were looking to see if

2:16:41.920 --> 2:16:49.520
 we could see the part of the brain turn off. He subsequently tried to do this with fMRI which

2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:55.040
 has a faster time resolution. And you could do it in real time as the person went under

2:16:55.040 --> 2:17:02.080
 and then regain consciousness where you couldn't do that with PET yet. And the results were

2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:07.920
 absolutely fascinating. We did this with different anesthetic drugs. And different drugs impacted

2:17:07.920 --> 2:17:15.200
 different parts of the brain. So we were naturally looking for the common one. And it seemed to have

2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:22.400
 something to do with the thalamus and consciousness. This was actual data on consciousness.

2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:28.960
 Real consciousness, actual consciousness. What part of the brain turns on? What part of the brain

2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:36.560
 turns off? It's not so clear. But maybe has something to do with the thalamus. The sequence

2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:44.000
 of events seemed to have the thalamus in it. Now here's the question. Are some people more conscious

2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:50.720
 than others? Are there individual differences in consciousness? And I don't mean it in the

2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:56.480
 psychedelic sense. I don't mean it in the political consciousness sense. I just mean it in

2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:02.240
 everyday life. Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others? And are those

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:09.520
 the people we might actually label more intelligent? Now the other thing I was looking for is whether

2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:14.560
 the parts of the brain we were seeing in the anesthesia studies were the same parts of the

2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:22.400
 brain we were seeing in the intelligent studies. Now this was very complicated, expensive research.

2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:26.960
 We didn't really have funding to do this. We were trying to do it on the fly. I'm not sure

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:35.600
 anybody has pursued this. I'm retired now. He's gone on to other things. But I think it's an area

2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:42.320
 of research that would be fascinating to see the parts. There are a lot more imaging studies now

2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:48.000
 of consciousness. I'm just not up on them. But basically the question is which imaging,

2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:54.160
 so newer imaging studies, to see in high resolution, spatial and temporal way,

2:18:54.160 --> 2:19:01.120
 which part of the brain lights up when you're doing intelligence tasks? And which parts of the

2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:04.960
 brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and see the interplay between them?

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:10.880
 Try to infer. That's the challenge of neuroscience. Without understanding deeply,

2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:18.880
 looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole thing works.

2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:25.280
 Well, imagine this. Here's a simple question. Does it take more anesthetic drug

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:36.960
 to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is 140 than a person with an IQ of 70?

2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:46.880
 That's an interesting way to study it. If the answer to that is a stable yes,

2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:51.120
 that's very interesting. So I tried to find out and I went to some

2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:56.720
 anesthesiology textbooks about how you dose and they dose by weight.

2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:07.760
 And what I also learned, this is a little bit off subject, anesthesiologists are never sure

2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:14.240
 how deep you are. And they usually tell by poking you with a needle and if you don't jump,

2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:19.840
 they tell the surgeon to go ahead. I'm not sure that's literally true, but it's...

2:20:20.640 --> 2:20:27.440
 Well, it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are. It has to do with the same kind

2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:34.480
 of measurements that you were doing with the consciousness. It's difficult to know.

2:20:34.480 --> 2:20:39.360
 So I don't lose my train of thought. I couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by

2:20:39.360 --> 2:20:45.520
 intelligence. I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know.

2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:52.880
 I said, can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as a proxy

2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:58.560
 for IQ? Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make

2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:04.160
 some inference as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school. Can we do a chart review?

2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:12.000
 And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose. No, he said, no. So to this day,

2:21:13.760 --> 2:21:20.240
 the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high IQ

2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:27.520
 or less or less? It could go either way. Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of

2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:36.880
 intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic

2:21:36.880 --> 2:21:45.200
 rate and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was negatively

2:21:45.200 --> 2:21:50.960
 correlated to how well they did on the test, which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis,

2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:58.320
 which is still being studied today. And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain

2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:09.040
 information processing is more related to intelligence than just more activity.

2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:14.080
 Yeah, it would be interesting. Again, it's the total hypothesis of how much in the relationship

2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:19.520
 between intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those two, if there's correlation,

2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:32.640
 there could be inversely correlated. Wouldn't that be funny? The consciousness factor,

2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:41.360
 the C factor plus the G factor equals one. It's a nice tradeoff. You get a tradeoff,

2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:47.920
 how deeply you experience the world versus how deeply you're able to reason through the world.

2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:53.840
 What a great hypothesis. Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.

2:22:53.840 --> 2:23:00.240
 Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from an AI

2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:09.040
 perspective. I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but there's the famous touring

2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:17.920
 test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation of

2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:26.800
 intelligence that Alan Turing proposed. Basically conversation being if you can fool a human to

2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:36.320
 think that a machine is a human that passes the test. I suppose you could do a similar thing.

2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:45.600
 For humans, if I can fool you that I'm intelligent, then that's a good test of

2:23:45.600 --> 2:23:59.440
 intelligence. You're talking to two people and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.

2:23:59.440 --> 2:24:06.400
 It's an interesting test because maybe charisma can be very useful there,

2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:11.040
 and you're only allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.

2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:16.640
 Anyway, all that to say is what are good tests of intelligence for machines?

2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:22.480
 What do you think it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?

2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:29.840
 Well, I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things,

2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:40.080
 I rapidly reach the limits of my knowledge and imagination. When Alexa first came out,

2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:49.760
 and I think there was a competing one, well, there was Siri with Apple and Google had Alexa.

2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:52.240
 No, no. Amazon had Alexa.

2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:55.520
 Amazon had Alexa. Google has Google Home.

2:24:55.520 --> 2:25:01.840
 Something. I proposed to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each,

2:25:02.800 --> 2:25:05.840
 and then ask it questions from the IQ test.

2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:08.720
 Nice.

2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:16.320
 But it became apparent that they all searched the internet, so they all can find answers to

2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:22.480
 questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me.

2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:30.240
 Now, I don't know if you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers backwards to me.

2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:32.000
 I don't know what would happen. I've never done it.

2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:39.760
 One answer to your question is, you're going to try it right now. Let's try it.

2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:40.400
 No, no, no.

2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:40.960
 Yes, Siri.

2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:47.760
 So, it would actually probably go to Google search and it will be all confusing kind of stuff.

2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:50.080
 It would fail.

2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:53.600
 Well, then I guess there's a test that it would fail.

2:25:54.480 --> 2:26:03.520
 Well, but that has to do more with the language of communication versus the content.

2:26:03.520 --> 2:26:09.360
 So, if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English and the test was administered in

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:11.440
 English, that's not really the test of...

2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:15.040
 Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.

2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:22.480
 Yes, so that's because I happen to know how those are programmed. There's a very hard coded and

2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:31.280
 there's definitely a lack of intelligence there. There's something like IQ tests. There's a guy,

2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:38.720
 an artificial intelligence researcher, François Chollet. He's a Google. He's one of the

2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:45.920
 seminal people in machine learning. He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.

2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:48.800
 How? I haven't heard that. I'd just like to know about that.

2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:53.680
 I'll actually email you this because it'd be very interesting for you. It doesn't get

2:26:53.680 --> 2:27:00.720
 much attention because people don't know what to do with it, but it deserves a lot of attention,

2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:08.240
 which is it basically does a pattern type of tests where you have to do one standard one.

2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:14.960
 You're given three things and you have to do a fourth one, that kind of thing. You have to

2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:26.000
 understand the pattern here. And for that, it really simplifies to... So, the interesting thing is

2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:34.400
 he's trying not to achieve high IQ. He's trying to achieve a pretty low bar for IQ.

2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:41.760
 Things that are kind of trivial for humans and they're actually really tough for machines,

2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:49.360
 which is playing with these concepts of symmetry, of counting. If I give you

2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:55.600
 one object, two objects, three objects, you'll know the last one is four objects. You can count

2:27:55.600 --> 2:28:01.520
 them. You can cluster objects together. It's both visually and conceptually. We could do all

2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:09.120
 these things with our mind that would take for granted the objectness of things. We can figure

2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:18.880
 out what spatially is an object and isn't. And we can play with those ideas. And machines really

2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:24.640
 struggle with that. So, he really cleanly formulated these IQ tests. I wonder what that

2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:31.920
 would equate to for humans with IQ. But it'd be a very low IQ. But that's exactly the kind of

2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:36.400
 formulation like, okay, we want to be able to solve this. How do we solve this? And he does this

2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:42.880
 as a challenge and nobody's been able to... It's similar to the Alexa Prize, which is Amazon

2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:49.440
 is hosting a conversational challenge. Nobody's been able to do well on his. But that's an interesting...

2:28:49.440 --> 2:28:57.120
 Those kinds of tests are interesting because we take for granted all the ability of the human mind

2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:09.200
 to play with concepts and to formulate concepts out of novel things. So, things we've never seen

2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:17.040
 before. We were able to use that. I've talked to a few people that design IQ tests online.

2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:23.280
 They write IQ tests. And I was trying to get some questions from them. And they spoke to the fact

2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:30.960
 that we can't really share questions with you because part of the... First of all, it's really

2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:36.480
 hard work to come up with questions. It's really, really hard work. It takes a lot of research,

2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:43.520
 but it also takes a lot of novelty generating. You're constantly coming up with really new things.

2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:51.200
 And part of the point is that they're not supposed to be public. They're supposed to be

2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:56.720
 new to you when you look at them. It's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness

2:29:56.720 --> 2:30:02.720
 of the problem, at least a part of what makes the problem hard as you've never seen it before.

2:30:02.720 --> 2:30:08.640
 Right. That's called fluid intelligence as opposed to what's called crystallized intelligence,

2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:16.160
 which is your knowledge of facts. You know things, but can you use those things to solve

2:30:16.160 --> 2:30:22.800
 a problem? Those are two different things. Do you think we'll be able to... Because we spoke...

2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:27.200
 I don't want to miss opportunity to talk about this. We spoke about the neurobiology,

2:30:27.200 --> 2:30:33.360
 the molecular biology of intelligence. Do you think one day we'll be able to modify the biology

2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:43.840
 of the genetics of a person to modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence?

2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:48.080
 We started this conversation by talking about a pill you could take. Do you think such a pill

2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:56.640
 would exist? Metaphorically, I do. And I am supremely confident that it's possible because I

2:30:56.640 --> 2:31:04.880
 am supremely ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology. Ignorance is bliss.

2:31:04.880 --> 2:31:11.200
 Well, I have written that the nightmares of neurobiologists, understanding the complexities,

2:31:11.200 --> 2:31:22.080
 this cascade of events that happens at the synaptic level, that these nightmares are what

2:31:22.080 --> 2:31:30.160
 fuels some people to solve. So some people, you have to be undaunted. I mean, yeah, this is not

2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:37.600
 easy. Look, we're still trying to figure out cancer. It was only recently that they figured

2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:45.120
 out why aspirin works. These are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective

2:31:45.120 --> 2:31:56.320
 of the history of science is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.

2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:00.880
 And seem impossible at the time. And seem impossible at the time.

2:32:00.880 --> 2:32:06.480
 And so one of the things you look at at companies like Neuralink, you have brain,

2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:11.840
 computer interfaces, you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines,

2:32:11.840 --> 2:32:17.760
 measuring, but also sending signals to the human mind. You start to wonder what that has,

2:32:18.560 --> 2:32:25.920
 what impact that has on the g factor, modifying in small ways or in large ways, the functioning,

2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:33.360
 the mechanical electrical chemical functioning of the brain.

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:40.240
 I look at everything about the brain. There are different levels of explanation. On one hand,

2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:46.800
 you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry. And then you have

2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:56.480
 neurons. And then you have dendrites. And then you have synapses. And then you have

2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:04.560
 the neurotransmitters and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals.

2:33:04.560 --> 2:33:11.600
 And then you have all the things that influence neurotransmitters. And then you have

2:33:12.160 --> 2:33:22.000
 the individual differences among people. Yeah, it's complicated. But 51 million people in the

2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:35.600
 United States have IQs under 85 and struggle with everyday life. Shouldn't that motivate people to

2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:45.440
 take a look at this? Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that we have to remember

2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:53.520
 that the science of intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human

2:33:53.520 --> 2:33:58.480
 condition. The thing that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world

2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:07.680
 is perhaps loosely correlated, but is not dependent entirely on intelligence.

2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:15.440
 Absolutely. I certainly agree with that. And so for anyone sort of listening,

2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:24.320
 I'm still not convinced that more intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty in

2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:30.320
 this world. I don't know. Well, I didn't say more intelligence is always better if you want to

2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:37.440
 create beauty. I just said all things being equal, more is better than less. That's all I mean.

2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:46.960
 Yeah, but I just want to say because to me, one of the things that makes life great is the opportunity

2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:53.360
 to create beautiful things. And so I just want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what

2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:00.400
 some IQ test says. At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people.

2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:06.800
 And to also inspire us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.

2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:13.040
 Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college,

2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:20.480
 whether they're thinking about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of?

2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:28.720
 Is there advice you can give? Whether they're in the they want to pursue psychology or biology

2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:32.720
 or engineering or whether they want to be artists and musicians and poets?

2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:44.160
 I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is. But I can say if you're interested

2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:53.840
 in psychology, if you're interested in science and the science around the big questions of

2:35:53.840 --> 2:36:01.360
 consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness, we haven't really talked about

2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:09.360
 brain illnesses and what we might learn from. If you are trying to develop a drug to treat

2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:18.080
 Alzheimer's disease, you are trying to develop a drug to impact learning and memory, which are

2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:25.600
 core to intelligence. So it could well be that the so called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical

2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:30.320
 company trying to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease. Because that's exactly what you're

2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:36.480
 trying to do, right? Yeah. Well, what will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have

2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:43.040
 Alzheimer's disease? So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology,

2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:53.600
 who are interested in science, to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions.

2:36:56.800 --> 2:37:04.160
 The most important thing I can tell you, if you're going to be in kind of a research environment,

2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:08.880
 is you've got to follow the data where the data take you. You can't decide in advance where you

2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:13.840
 want the data to go. And if the data take you to places that you don't have the technical

2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:22.000
 expertise to follow, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I'm not going

2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:29.360
 to become a molecular biologist now, but I know people who are. And my job is to get them interested

2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:37.760
 to take their expertise into this direction. And it's not so easy. And if the data takes you to

2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:47.840
 a place that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in this world, no. I would say it's probably a

2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:56.240
 good idea to still push forward boldly, but to communicate the interpretation of the results

2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:05.120
 with skill, with compassion, with a greater breadth of understanding of humanity, not just

2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:12.240
 the science of the impact of the results. One famous psychologist wrote about this issue,

2:38:12.240 --> 2:38:19.840
 that somehow a balance has to be found between pursuing the science and communicating it

2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:26.160
 with respect to people's sensitivities, the legitimate sensitivities. Somehow. He didn't

2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:32.080
 say how. Somehow. Somehow. And this is. Every part of that sentence, somehow and balance

2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:40.080
 is left up to the interpretation of the reader. Let me ask you, you said big questions, the biggest

2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:46.720
 or one of the biggest. We already talked about consciousness and intelligence, one of the most

2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:52.160
 fascinating, one of the biggest questions, but let's talk about the why. Why are we here?

2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:56.080
 What's the meaning of life? Oh, I'm not going to tell you.

2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:02.480
 You know, you're not going to tell me. This is very, I'm going to have to wait for your next book.

2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:09.120
 The meaning of life. We do the best we can to get through the day.

2:39:12.160 --> 2:39:17.600
 And then there's just a finite number of the days. Are you afraid of the finiteness of it?

2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:25.920
 You think about it more and more as I get older. Yeah, I do. And it's one of these human things

2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:34.240
 that it is finite. We all know it. Most of us deny it and don't want to think about it.

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:40.880
 Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning. You try to do the rational thing.

2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:46.800
 Sometimes it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited

2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:53.920
 and you want to get things done. I don't know where I am on that. It is

2:39:56.080 --> 2:40:02.080
 just one of those things that's always in the back of my mind. And I don't think that's uncommon.

2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:10.160
 Well, it's just like G factor in intelligence. It's a hard truth that's there. And sometimes you

2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:18.480
 kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at it. But it's still there. Yeah. Yes, you can't

2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:26.640
 escape it. And think about the G factor in intelligence is everybody knows this is true

2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:33.280
 on a personal daily basis. Even if you think back to when you were in school,

2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:42.320
 you know who the smart kids were. When you are on the phone talking to a customer service

2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:49.360
 representative that in response to your detailed question is reading a script back to you and

2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:56.000
 you get furious at this. And have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person

2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:01.440
 a moron? You're not listening to me. Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people

2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:09.040
 who they think are not at their level. It's just common because that's the way human beings are.

2:41:09.040 --> 2:41:16.880
 That's the way life is. But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence. We have a

2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:23.680
 poor, and we're not always a great, our judgment of human character of other people is not as good

2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:34.720
 as a battery of tests. That's where bias comes in. That's where our history, our emotions,

2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:40.640
 all of that comes in. So people on the internet, there's such a thing as the internet. And people

2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:49.120
 on the internet will call each other dumb all the time. And that's the worry here is that

2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:57.200
 we give up on people. We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small number

2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:04.480
 of interactions as if that's it. They're hopeless. That's just in their genetics. But I think no matter

2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:11.680
 what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should not have compassion

2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:20.800
 for our fellow man. That's exactly what the science does say. It's not opposite of what

2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:26.880
 the science says. Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned about

2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:34.800
 intelligence, everything points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat people

2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:41.600
 as individuals respectfully and with compassion. Because through no fault of their own,

2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:49.200
 some people are not as capable as others. And you want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to come

2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:57.200
 up with theories about why that might be true. Fine. I would like to fix some of it as best I can.

2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:05.040
 And everybody is deserving of love. Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.

2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:11.920
 I'm just getting warmed up here. I know. I know you can go for another many hours. But

2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:17.040
 to respect your extremely valuable time, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you for

2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:24.320
 the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the neuroscience of intelligence,

2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:29.920
 just the work you're doing. It's a difficult topic. It's a topic that's controversial and

2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:36.000
 sensitive to people and to push forward boldly. And in that nuanced way, just thank you for

2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:42.000
 everything you do. And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence, of consciousness.

2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:46.320
 Well, thank you for asking me. I mean, there's nothing like good conversation on these topics.

2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:51.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Hire. To support this podcast,

2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:56.320
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

2:43:56.320 --> 2:44:02.960
 Albert Einstein. It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.

2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:20.960
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
