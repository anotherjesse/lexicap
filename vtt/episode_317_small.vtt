00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
 The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.240
 You can just have met the person

00:07.240 --> 00:09.400
 that is going to be the love of your life.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.960
 It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness

00:13.960 --> 00:18.160
 and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.360
 That's mortality.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.720
 Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

00:22.720 --> 00:27.720
 It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.720
 So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience

00:31.720 --> 00:35.720
 whenever all the projects and the plans you make

00:35.720 --> 00:39.720
 come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.720
 The following is a conversation with John Rovaki,

00:44.720 --> 00:48.720
 a psychologist and cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.720
 I highly recommend his lecture series called

00:51.720 --> 00:53.720
 Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,

00:53.720 --> 00:58.720
 which covers the history and future of humanity's search for meaning.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.720
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.720
 And now, dear friends, here's John Rovaki.

01:07.720 --> 01:13.720
 You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the Meaning Crisis.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.720
 And I think you describe in the modern times

01:16.720 --> 01:20.720
 an increase in depression, loneliness, cynicism,

01:20.720 --> 01:23.720
 and wait for it bullshit.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.720
 The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.720
 So let me ask, what is meaning?

01:30.720 --> 01:36.720
 What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning?

01:36.720 --> 01:37.720
 So when I'm talking about meaning,

01:37.720 --> 01:40.720
 I'm talking about what's called meaning in life,

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
 not the meaning of life.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.720
 That's some sort of metaphysical claim.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.720
 Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate

01:47.720 --> 01:50.720
 their lives as more meaningful, worth living, worth the suffering

01:50.720 --> 01:52.720
 that they have to endure.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.720
 And when you study that, what you see is,

01:56.720 --> 01:59.720
 it's a sense of connectedness.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.720
 Connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world,

02:03.720 --> 02:06.720
 and a particular kind of connectedness.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.720
 You want to be connected to things that have a value

02:10.720 --> 02:14.720
 and an existence independent of your egocentric,

02:14.720 --> 02:18.720
 sort of preferences and concerns.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.720
 This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful

02:21.720 --> 02:25.720
 because you're connecting to something that's going to have a life

02:25.720 --> 02:28.720
 and a value independent of you.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.720
 Now, the question that comes up for me,

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
 well, there's two questions.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.720
 One is, why is that at risk right now?

02:36.720 --> 02:40.720
 And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first,

02:40.720 --> 02:43.720
 which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?

02:43.720 --> 02:46.720
 Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings?

02:46.720 --> 02:50.720
 Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression,

02:50.720 --> 02:54.720
 potentially mental illness, addiction, self destructive behavior?

02:54.720 --> 02:58.720
 And so the first answer I give you is, well, it's that sense of connectedness.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.720
 And people often express it metaphorically.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.720
 They want to be connected to something larger than themselves.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.720
 They want to matter.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.720
 They don't mean it literally.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.720
 I mean, if I change you to a mountain, you wouldn't thereby say,

03:08.720 --> 03:11.720
 oh, now my life is so fulfilling, right?

03:11.720 --> 03:14.720
 So what they're trying to convey, they're using this metaphor to try and say,

03:14.720 --> 03:16.720
 they want to be connected.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.720
 They want to be connected to something real.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.720
 They want to make a difference and matter to it.

03:21.720 --> 03:26.720
 And one way of asking them, you know, what's meaningful is,

03:26.720 --> 03:31.720
 tell me what you would like to continue to exist even if you weren't around anymore.

03:31.720 --> 03:36.720
 And how are you connected to it and how do you matter to it?

03:36.720 --> 03:43.720
 That's one way of trying to get at what is the source of meaning for you,

03:43.720 --> 03:49.720
 is if you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.720
 That's not the only part of the definition probably,

03:52.720 --> 03:57.720
 because there's probably many things that aren't a source of meaning for me,

03:57.720 --> 04:02.720
 that maybe I find beautiful, that I would like to continue existing.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.720
 Yes. If it contributes to your life being meaningful,

04:06.720 --> 04:11.720
 you're connected to it in some way and it matters to you

04:11.720 --> 04:16.720
 and you matter to it in that you make some difference to it.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.720
 That's when it goes from being just sort of true, good and beautiful

04:19.720 --> 04:22.720
 to being a source of meaning for you in your life.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.720
 Is the meaning crisis a new thing or has it always been with us?

04:26.720 --> 04:29.720
 Is it part of the human condition in general?

04:29.720 --> 04:33.720
 That's an excellent question and part of the argument I made in Awakening

04:33.720 --> 04:36.720
 for the Meaning Crisis is there's two aspects to it.

04:36.720 --> 04:42.720
 One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.720
 And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.720
 The book of Ecclesiastes is it's all vanity, it's all meaningless.

04:51.720 --> 04:58.720
 But there's also historical forces that have made those perennial problems

04:58.720 --> 05:05.720
 more pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.720
 And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems,

05:10.720 --> 05:16.720
 finding existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety, feeling alienated,

05:16.720 --> 05:21.720
 and then pressing historical factors which have to do with the loss of the resources

05:21.720 --> 05:27.720
 that human beings have typically crossed historically and cross culturally made use of

05:27.720 --> 05:31.720
 in order to address these perennial problems.

05:31.720 --> 05:38.720
 Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning

05:38.720 --> 05:42.720
 that speaks to the fact that we're vulnerable to despair?

05:42.720 --> 05:47.720
 You know, Ernest Becker talked about in his book, The Now of Death,

05:47.720 --> 05:52.720
 about the fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.720
 As William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition.

05:56.720 --> 06:06.720
 Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen from the perspective

06:06.720 --> 06:14.720
 of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one's own mortality?

06:14.720 --> 06:18.720
 Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it.

06:18.720 --> 06:25.720
 There's been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.720
 Some of the work, not so good.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.720
 So which aspects do you find convincing?

06:30.720 --> 06:34.720
 Can you steelman that case and then can you argue against it?

06:34.720 --> 06:41.720
 So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite,

06:41.720 --> 06:48.720
 being inherently limited is very problematic for us.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.720
 Given the extensive use of the word problematic,

06:51.720 --> 06:56.720
 I like that you use that word to describe one's own mortality as problematic.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.720
 Because people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody.

07:01.720 --> 07:08.720
 But this to me seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human condition is that we die and it ends.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.720
 I think I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'm trying to get you to consider

07:13.720 --> 07:16.720
 that your mortality is not an event in the future.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.720
 It's a state you're in right now.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.720
 That's what I'm trying to shift.

07:22.720 --> 07:29.720
 So your mortality is just a, we talk about something that causes mortality fatal.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.720
 But what we actually mean is it's full of fate.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.720
 And I don't mean in the sense of things are prewritten.

07:35.720 --> 07:43.720
 What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.720
 You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

07:48.720 --> 07:53.720
 It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.720
 And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
 That's mortality.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.720
 Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

08:02.720 --> 08:08.720
 It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

08:08.720 --> 08:15.720
 So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects

08:15.720 --> 08:21.720
 and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.

08:21.720 --> 08:28.720
 The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.720
 And so in that sense, it is always here with us.

08:31.720 --> 08:37.720
 Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life.

08:37.720 --> 08:43.720
 Because it's interesting if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.720
 They often put public speaking as number one.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
 Yeah.

08:47.720 --> 08:53.720
 Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.720
 You can drive them into despair.

08:55.720 --> 09:02.720
 So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say that a self report

09:02.720 --> 09:08.720
 on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually at the core of the motivation of a human being.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.720
 That we could be terrified of death.

09:10.720 --> 09:18.720
 And from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends,

09:18.720 --> 09:22.720
 we've learned to really try to forget about it.

09:22.720 --> 09:29.720
 Try to construct illusions that allow us to escape momentarily or for prolonged periods of time.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.720
 The realization that we die.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.720
 Okay, so first I took it seriously.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.720
 But now I want to say why there's some empirical work that makes me want to reconsider.

09:39.720 --> 09:45.720
 So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.720
 And in those words, in those lists are words associated with death, cough and funeral.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.720
 And then you see what happens to people.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.720
 And generally they start to become more rigid in their thinking.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.720
 They tend to identify with their worldview.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.720
 They lose cognitive flexibility.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.720
 That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective.

10:04.720 --> 10:10.720
 But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they're dying

10:10.720 --> 10:17.720
 and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don't show those responses.

10:17.720 --> 10:22.720
 In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.720
 See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.720
 It might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that is present or absent in depth.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.720
 That is the crucial thing for us.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.720
 By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously.

10:36.720 --> 10:43.720
 I don't think you truly steelman the case because you're saying that death is always present with us.

10:43.720 --> 10:48.720
 Yes, but isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?

10:48.720 --> 10:53.720
 Nietzsche, Will to Power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.720
 All the different explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings.

10:57.720 --> 11:11.720
 Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good, if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?

11:11.720 --> 11:16.720
 I'm not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings,

11:16.720 --> 11:26.720
 but I'm proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths meaningful and certain deaths meaningless.

11:26.720 --> 11:35.720
 We have lots of evidence that people are willing to sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.720
 Are you personally afraid of your death? Do you think about it?

11:39.720 --> 11:49.720
 As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down, is a deep thinker, a admired thinker,

11:49.720 --> 11:57.720
 and as the years go on, become more and more admired, does it scare you that the ride ends?

11:57.720 --> 12:00.720
 No. I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.720
 I'm a biological organism, so if something's thrown at my head, I'll duck and things like that.

12:05.720 --> 12:12.720
 But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever? No.

12:12.720 --> 12:22.720
 In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you aware of simultaneously the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.

12:22.720 --> 12:28.720
 The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.720
 Are those the only two options?

12:30.720 --> 12:42.720
 Like, when you're sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or a book you really love, you don't want it to end.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.720
 You don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect.

12:46.720 --> 12:51.720
 The complete opposite of the thought experiment, what happens if the book lasts forever?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.720
 There's got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button.

12:54.720 --> 12:59.720
 Sure, you don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra 15 minutes.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.720
 There's surely some kind of balance.

13:02.720 --> 13:11.720
 That fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation of the moment in part.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.720
 That's what the Stoics talked about, to meditate on one's mortality.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
 Sure.

13:17.720 --> 13:28.720
 It seems to be a nice wake up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful and then you don't get an infinite number of them.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
 Right.

13:29.720 --> 13:46.720
 And the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of your life, but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that when death comes, it does not strike you as any kind of calamity.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.720
 Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?

13:50.720 --> 13:51.720
 I think so.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.720
 Do you think about your mortality?

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
 I used to.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.720
 I don't so much anymore.

13:57.720 --> 14:08.720
 Part of it as I'm older and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s, you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.720
 That's such a beautiful phrase.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.720
 The temporal horizon flips.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.720
 That's so true.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.720
 That's so true.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.720
 At what point is that?

14:17.720 --> 14:25.720
 The point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite before you.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.720
 Yeah, it's like Peter Pan.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.720
 There's all these golden possibilities and you fly around between them.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
 Yes, very much.

14:32.720 --> 14:37.720
 And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model.

14:37.720 --> 14:49.720
 The Socratic, the Stoic model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about, wait, when I look at my desires, I seem to have two meta desires.

14:49.720 --> 15:04.720
 In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be real and whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict, but bring something like peace of mind.

15:04.720 --> 15:18.720
 And so I'm more and more moved towards how can I live such that those two meta desires are a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.720
 What do you think happens after we die?

15:21.720 --> 15:27.720
 I think mind and life go away completely when we die.

15:27.720 --> 15:36.720
 And I think that's actually significantly important for the kind of beings that we are.

15:36.720 --> 15:47.720
 We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness and then we have a responsibility to decide how we're going to comport ourselves towards it.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.720
 Can you linger on what that means?

15:49.720 --> 15:51.720
 The mind goes away.

15:51.720 --> 15:59.720
 Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.720
 It doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.720
 It doesn't mean the song wasn't complex.

16:03.720 --> 16:10.720
 It doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value of the universe in its existence, but it came to an end.

16:10.720 --> 16:21.720
 Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human and remains after something like panpsychism?

16:21.720 --> 16:25.720
 Or is it too much for us, limited cognitive beings to understand?

16:25.720 --> 16:27.720
 Something like panpsychism.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.720
 I take it seriously.

16:29.720 --> 16:35.720
 I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that make me doubt it.

16:35.720 --> 16:45.720
 Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has, for me, just devastating problems.

16:45.720 --> 16:53.720
 Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose in order to support some kind of idea of immortality.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.720
 I find both very problematic.

16:55.720 --> 17:05.720
 The fact that we participate in distributed cognition, that most of our problem solving is not done as individuals, but in groups, this is something I work on.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.720
 I've published on that.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.720
 I think that's important.

17:08.720 --> 17:20.720
 But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while there's such a thing as collective intelligence, there's no good evidence that there's collective consciousness.

17:20.720 --> 17:25.720
 In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason.

17:25.720 --> 17:37.720
 And so while I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline and there's a collective intelligence that solves that problem, I do not think that collective intelligence supports any kind of consciousness.

17:37.720 --> 17:51.720
 And so therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate, which I regularly and reliably do in distributed cognition, gives me any reason to believe that that participation grounds some kind of consciousness.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
 Okay.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.720
 There's so many things to mention there.

17:54.720 --> 18:16.720
 If you think of all distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence, so that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines, and are somehow able to interact with a process of dialogue as you talk about to morph different ideas together.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.720
 Sure.

18:17.720 --> 18:34.720
 This idea landscape together is so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating distributed cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
 Yeah.

18:35.720 --> 18:43.720
 But isn't there a case if we just look at intelligence, if we look at us humans as a collection of smaller organisms.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.720
 Yes.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
 Which we are.

18:45.720 --> 19:05.720
 And so there's like a hierarchy of organisms, tiny ones work together to form tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual organisms that are then also forming bigger villages and interacting different ways and function becomes more and more complex.

19:05.720 --> 19:17.720
 And eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we're an individual, but really we're not. There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign.

19:17.720 --> 19:27.720
 So isn't that building up consciousnesses like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.720
 Why does it have to stop with us humans?

19:29.720 --> 19:46.720
 Are we the only, like is this the face transition when it becomes a zombie like giant hierarchical village that first like, there's like a singing angels and it's consciousness is born in just us humans.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.720
 Do bacteria have consciousness?

19:48.720 --> 19:56.720
 Not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does, but like the interesting complicated organisms that are within us have consciousness.

19:56.720 --> 20:09.720
 I think it's proper to argue and I have that like a paramecium or bacteria has a kind of agency and even a kind of intelligence kind of sense making ability.

20:09.720 --> 20:23.720
 But I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by consciousness, this kind of self awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera, to bacteria.

20:23.720 --> 20:30.720
 Now, the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness, I think is a little bit more tricky.

20:30.720 --> 20:41.720
 And I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a consciousness for distributed cognition, collective intelligence.

20:41.720 --> 20:57.720
 In fact, many, you know, philosophers would agree with me on that point. I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts, bandwidth, density of connections, speed of information transfer, et cetera.

20:57.720 --> 21:12.720
 It's conceivable that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked our brains and we had the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed that a group consciousness could take shape.

21:12.720 --> 21:24.720
 I don't have any argument in principle against that. I'm just saying those contingent facts do not yet exist and therefore it is implausible that consciousness exists at the level of collective intelligence.

21:24.720 --> 21:32.720
 You talk about consciousness quite a bit. So let's step back and try to sneak up to a definition. What is consciousness?

21:32.720 --> 21:45.720
 For me, there are two aspects to answering that question. One is what's the nature of consciousness? How does something like consciousness exist in an otherwise apparently nonconscious universe?

21:45.720 --> 21:51.720
 And then there's a function question, which is equally important, which is what does consciousness do?

21:51.720 --> 22:01.720
 The first one is obviously, you know, problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different from the rest of the nonconscious universe.

22:01.720 --> 22:14.720
 But I put it to you that the function question is also very hard because you are clearly capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without consciousness.

22:14.720 --> 22:25.720
 You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind and you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring.

22:25.720 --> 22:33.720
 So why do we have consciousness at all? Now, here's the thing. There's an extra question you need to ask.

22:33.720 --> 22:40.720
 Should we attempt to answer those questions separately or should we attempt to answer them in an integrated fashion?

22:40.720 --> 22:49.720
 I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion, what consciousness does and what it is.

22:49.720 --> 22:53.720
 We should be able to give a unified answer to both of those.

22:53.720 --> 23:04.720
 Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what it does, both of which are mysteries, as you say.

23:04.720 --> 23:13.720
 State versus action. Can you try to explain the difference that's interesting, that's useful, that's important to understand?

23:13.720 --> 23:21.720
 So that's putting me in a bit of a difficult position because I actually argue that trying to answer them separately is ultimately incoherent.

23:21.720 --> 23:30.720
 But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of these problems is addressed and the other is left unaddressed.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.720
 So people will try and explain what qualia are, how they potentially emerge.

23:34.720 --> 23:41.720
 Without saying, what do they do? What problems do they help to solve? How do they make the organism more adaptive?

23:41.720 --> 23:49.720
 And then you'll have other people will say, no, no, this is what the function of consciousness is, but I can't tell you, I can't solve the hard problem.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.720
 I don't know how qualia exists.

23:51.720 --> 24:01.720
 So what I'm saying is many people treat these problems separately, although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.720
 So the hard problem is focusing on what it is?

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
 Yes.

24:05.720 --> 24:14.720
 So the qualia, it feels like something to experience a thing, that's what consciousness is, and does is more about the functional usefulness of the thing.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.720
 Yes.

24:15.720 --> 24:22.720
 To the whole beautiful mix of cognition and just function in everyday life.

24:22.720 --> 24:33.720
 Okay. You've also said that you can do very intelligent things without consciousness.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.720
 Yes, clearly.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.720
 Is that obvious to you?

24:36.720 --> 24:44.720
 Yes. I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory. It just comes up.

24:44.720 --> 24:50.720
 And it comes up really intelligently.

24:50.720 --> 25:00.720
 But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with whatever is doing the memory access is doing the cognition.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.720
 Oh, I think so.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.720
 Yes.

25:02.720 --> 25:21.720
 So I guess what I'm trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a few times, which is whether we can build machines that are conscious or machines that are intelligent human level intelligence or beyond without building the consciousness.

25:21.720 --> 25:27.720
 I mean, ultimately, that's one of the ways to understand what consciousness is is to is to build the thing.

25:27.720 --> 25:39.720
 We can either sort of from the Chomsky way, try to construct models like he thinks about language in this way, try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing.

25:39.720 --> 25:56.720
 Exactly. And that's a methodological principle in cognitive science. In fact, one of the things that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing with the nature of cognition in the mind is that cognitive

25:56.720 --> 26:09.720
 science takes the design stance. It asks, well, could we build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomena?

26:09.720 --> 26:14.720
 Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?

26:14.720 --> 26:31.720
 In terms of how far we are, there's on the computational side of things, something called cognitive modeling, there's all these kinds of packages that you can construct simplified models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge.

26:31.720 --> 26:40.720
 Do you find any efforts in cognitive or what efforts in cognitive science do you find most inspiring and productive?

26:40.720 --> 26:52.720
 I think the project of trying to create AGI, artificial general intelligence, is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence being of scientific significance.

26:52.720 --> 26:59.720
 This is independent of technological socioeconomic significance, which is already well established.

26:59.720 --> 27:16.720
 But being able to say because of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence, perhaps consciousness. I think that's where I place my bets is in the current endeavors around artificial general intelligence.

27:16.720 --> 27:30.720
 And so tackling that problem head on, which has now become central, at least to a group of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done.

27:30.720 --> 27:36.720
 And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness?

27:36.720 --> 27:48.720
 Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence. So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.720
 You can solve a wide variety of problems and a wide variety of domains.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.720
 And some of our best machines have a little bit of transfer.

27:55.720 --> 28:02.720
 They can learn this game and play a few other well designed rule bound games, but they couldn't learn how to swim.

28:02.720 --> 28:10.720
 Right. Or et cetera, things like that. And so what's interesting is what seems to come up.

28:10.720 --> 28:21.720
 And this is some of my published work in all these different domains of cognition across all these different problem types is a central problem.

28:21.720 --> 28:29.720
 And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability that's a significant component of our intelligence,

28:29.720 --> 28:34.720
 I made an argument as to what I think that general ability is.

28:34.720 --> 28:39.720
 And so it's happening right now.

28:39.720 --> 28:45.720
 The amount of information in this room that you could actually pay attention to is combinatorial explosive.

28:45.720 --> 28:53.720
 The amount of information you have in your memory, long term memory and all the ways you could combine it, combinatorial explosive.

28:53.720 --> 28:57.720
 The number of possibilities you can consider also combinatorial explosive.

28:57.720 --> 29:02.720
 The sequences of behavior you can generate also combinatorial explosive.

29:02.720 --> 29:07.720
 And yet somehow you're zeroing in the right memories are coming up.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.720
 The right possibilities are opening up the right sequences of behavior.

29:10.720 --> 29:22.720
 You're paying attention to the right thing, not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably find obvious what you should interact with in order to solve the problem at hand.

29:22.720 --> 29:30.720
 That's an ability that is still not well understood within AGI.

29:30.720 --> 29:35.720
 So filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.720
 Right. It's almost like a Zen Cohen.

29:37.720 --> 29:51.720
 What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore so much information and do it in such a way that is somewhere between arbitrary guessing and algorithmic search.

29:51.720 --> 30:02.720
 And to a fault sometimes, of course, that you, based on the models you construct, you forget, you ignore things that you should probably not ignore.

30:02.720 --> 30:09.720
 And that, hopefully we can circle back to it, Lex, is related to the meaning issue.

30:09.720 --> 30:19.720
 Because the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible to self deceptive, self destructive behavior.

30:19.720 --> 30:24.720
 Because of the way we miss frame the environment in a fundamental ways.

30:24.720 --> 30:41.720
 So to you, meaning is also connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and understand and interact intellectually with the environment.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.720
 Yes.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.720
 So what is wisdom?

30:44.720 --> 30:46.720
 Why do we long for it?

30:46.720 --> 30:48.720
 How do we, and where do we find it?

30:48.720 --> 30:49.720
 What is it?

30:49.720 --> 30:54.720
 Intelligence is what you use to solve your problems, as I was just describing.

30:54.720 --> 31:03.720
 Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems of self deception that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.720
 So it's that matter problem.

31:05.720 --> 31:11.720
 And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing?

31:11.720 --> 31:17.720
 I think you have multiple ways of knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities.

31:17.720 --> 31:24.720
 And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and affording each other.

31:24.720 --> 31:30.720
 So in that way, wisdom is rationally self transcending rationality.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.720
 Right.

31:31.720 --> 31:43.720
 So life is a kind of process where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up a village of rationalities along the way that then turns into wisdom.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.720
 Yes, it's properly coordinated.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.720
 You mentioned framing.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
 Yes.

31:48.720 --> 31:52.720
 So what is framing?

31:52.720 --> 32:03.720
 Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in how you see the world, how you reason about the world, how you understand the world?

32:03.720 --> 32:05.720
 So it depends what you mean by assumptions.

32:05.720 --> 32:14.720
 If it by assumption you mean a proposition, representational or rule, I think that's much more downstream from relevance realization.

32:14.720 --> 32:24.720
 I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention.

32:24.720 --> 32:34.720
 And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing right now of salience landscaping.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.720
 What's salient to you?

32:36.720 --> 32:43.720
 And how is what salient constantly shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry?

32:43.720 --> 32:55.720
 And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salience landscaping is aspectualizing the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?

32:55.720 --> 33:01.720
 For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of belief we have.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.720
 And here's why.

33:03.720 --> 33:13.720
 If we mean by beliefs, you know, a representational proposition, then we're in this very problematic position.

33:13.720 --> 33:20.720
 Because then we're trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how we do relevance realization.

33:20.720 --> 33:26.720
 And that's problematic because representations presuppose relevance realization.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.720
 So I represent this as a cup.

33:29.720 --> 33:35.720
 The number of properties it actually has and that I even have epistemic access to is combinatorial explosive.

33:35.720 --> 33:42.720
 I select from those a subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar as they are relevant for me.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
 This doesn't have to be a cup.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.720
 I could be using it as a hat.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.720
 I can use it to stand for the letter V, all kinds of different things.

33:50.720 --> 33:55.720
 I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America, right?

33:55.720 --> 33:59.720
 Representations presuppose relevance realization.

33:59.720 --> 34:08.720
 They are, right, they are therefore dependent on it, which means relevance realization isn't bound to our representational structures.

34:08.720 --> 34:13.720
 It can be influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on relevance realization.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.720
 Let's define stuff.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.720
 Relevance realization.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
 Yes.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.720
 What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing?

34:20.720 --> 34:21.720
 What is it?

34:21.720 --> 34:23.720
 What are we talking about?

34:23.720 --> 34:31.720
 What we're talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution.

34:31.720 --> 34:41.720
 So if you think about that adaptivity isn't in the organism or in the environment, but in a dynamical relation, and then what does evolution do?

34:41.720 --> 34:44.720
 It creates variation and then it puts selective pressure.

34:44.720 --> 34:49.720
 And what that does is that changes the niche constructions that are available to a species.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.720
 It changes the morphology.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.720
 You also have a loop.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.720
 It's your sensory motor loop.

34:55.720 --> 35:04.720
 And what's constantly happening is there are processes within you that are opening up variation and also processes that are putting selection on it.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.720
 And you're constantly evolving that sensory motor loop.

35:07.720 --> 35:14.720
 So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you're framing the world is constantly evolving and changing.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.720
 I can give you two clear examples of that.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.720
 One, right?

35:18.720 --> 35:20.720
 Your autonomic nervous system.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.720
 Parasympathetic and sympathetic.

35:22.720 --> 35:29.720
 The sympathetic system is biased to trying to interpret as much of reality as threat or opportunity.

35:29.720 --> 35:37.720
 The parasympathetic is, right, is biased to trying to interpret as much of the environment as safe and relaxing.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.720
 And they are constantly doing opponent processing.

35:40.720 --> 35:46.720
 There's no little man in you calculating your level of arousal.

35:46.720 --> 35:52.720
 There's this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is constantly evolving your arousal.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.720
 Similarly, your attention.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.720
 You have the default mode network, task network.

35:56.720 --> 36:03.720
 The default mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind wander, to go off, to drift, right?

36:03.720 --> 36:10.720
 And then the task focus network is selecting out of those possibilities the ones that will survive and go into.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.720
 And so you're constantly evolving your attention.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.720
 Okay, so there's a natural selection of ideas that a bunch of systems within you are generating.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.720
 And then you use the natural selection.

36:21.720 --> 36:25.720
 What is the selector, the object that you're interacting with, the glass?

36:25.720 --> 36:27.720
 Relevance realization.

36:27.720 --> 36:30.720
 Once again, you just describe how it happens.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.720
 Yes.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.720
 You can describe what the hell it is.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.720
 So what's the goal?

36:35.720 --> 36:36.720
 What are we talking about?

36:36.720 --> 36:47.720
 So relevance realization is how you interact with things in the world to make sense of why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.720
 Yes, and notice the language you just used.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.720
 You're starting to use the meaning in life language.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.720
 Good or bad.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.720
 That's good.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
 Okay.

36:54.720 --> 36:55.720
 That's good.

36:55.720 --> 37:00.720
 So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?

37:00.720 --> 37:10.720
 It gives you, and here I'll use the term for Marla Ponty, it gives you an optimal grip on the world.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.720
 So let's use your visual attention again.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.720
 Okay, here's an object.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.720
 How close should I be to it?

37:19.720 --> 37:21.720
 Is there a right?

37:21.720 --> 37:22.720
 That's what you want to do with it.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.720
 Exactly, exactly.

37:24.720 --> 37:35.720
 So you have to evolve your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal grip that actually creates the affordance of you getting to a goal that you're trying to get to.

37:35.720 --> 37:40.720
 Yeah, but you're describing physical goals of manipulating objects.

37:40.720 --> 37:50.720
 So this applies, the task, the process of relevance realization is not just about getting a glass of water and taking a drink.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.720
 No.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.720
 It's about falling in love.

37:54.720 --> 37:55.720
 Yeah, of course.

37:55.720 --> 37:56.720
 What else is there?

37:56.720 --> 37:59.720
 Well, there's obvious.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.720
 Between those two options.

38:01.720 --> 38:06.720
 I can show you how you're optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.720
 Okay.

38:07.720 --> 38:12.720
 So a mammal goes by and most people will say, there's a dog.

38:12.720 --> 38:18.720
 Now, why don't they say, they might, but typically, you know, probabilistically, they'll say there's a dog.

38:18.720 --> 38:24.720
 They could say there's a German shepherd, there's a mammal, there's a living organism, there's a police dog.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.720
 Why that, why there?

38:26.720 --> 38:27.720
 Why do they stop?

38:27.720 --> 38:30.720
 Eleanor Rush called these basic level.

38:30.720 --> 38:40.720
 Well, what you find is that's an optimal grip because it's, it's getting you the best overall balance between similarity within your category and difference between the other categories.

38:40.720 --> 38:57.720
 It's allowing you to properly fit to that object insofar as you're setting yourself up to, well, I'm getting so, as many of the similarities and differences I can on balance because they're in a tradeoff relationship that I need in order to probably interact with this mammal.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.720
 That's optimal grip.

38:59.720 --> 39:00.720
 Not right.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.720
 It's at the level of your categorization.

39:03.720 --> 39:14.720
 You evolve these models of the world around you and on top of them, you do stuff like you build representations, like you said.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.720
 Yes.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.720
 What's the salience landscape?

39:17.720 --> 39:21.720
 Salience meaning attention landscape.

39:21.720 --> 39:29.720
 So salience is what grabs your attention or what results from you directing your attention.

39:29.720 --> 39:33.720
 So I clap my hands that salient, it grabs your attention.

39:33.720 --> 39:36.720
 Your attention is drawn to it as bottom up.

39:36.720 --> 39:42.720
 But I can also say you left big toe and now it's salient to you because you directed your attention towards it.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.720
 That's top down.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.720
 And again, opponent processing going on there.

39:46.720 --> 39:54.720
 So whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what arouses you, what triggers at least momentarily some affect towards it.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
 That's how things are salient.

39:56.720 --> 40:06.720
 What salience, I would argue is, is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization makes information relevant to working memory.

40:06.720 --> 40:13.720
 That's when it now becomes online for direct sensory motor interaction with the world.

40:13.720 --> 40:20.720
 So you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious mind?

40:20.720 --> 40:33.720
 I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively processed, relevance realization such that it passes through sort of this higher filter of working memory

40:33.720 --> 40:41.720
 and has these properties of being globally accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing we call salience.

40:41.720 --> 40:43.720
 Look, that's really good evidence.

40:43.720 --> 40:50.720
 There's really good evidence from my colleague at U of T, University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher, that that's what working memory is.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.720
 It's a higher order relevance filter.

40:52.720 --> 41:00.720
 That's why things like chunking will get way more information through working memory because it's basically making, it's basically

41:00.720 --> 41:05.720
 monitoring how much relevance realization has gone into this information.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.720
 Usually you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing.

41:08.720 --> 41:13.720
 And that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness?

41:13.720 --> 41:18.720
 When do you need that working memory and that salience landscaping?

41:18.720 --> 41:27.720
 It's when you're facing situations that are highly novel, highly complex and very ill defined that require you to engage working memory.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.720
 Okay, got it.

41:29.720 --> 41:35.720
 So relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that basic level thing of a dog.

41:35.720 --> 41:44.720
 When you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German Shepherd, not a mammal, not a biological meat bag, it's a dog.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.720
 Wisdom.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.720
 Yes.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.720
 So what is wisdom?

41:49.720 --> 41:54.720
 If we return, I think it's part of that we got to relevance realization.

41:54.720 --> 42:07.720
 And then wisdom is accumulation of rationalities. He described the rationality as a kind of starting from intelligence,

42:07.720 --> 42:12.720
 a bunch of puzzle solving, and then rationalities like the meta problem of puzzle solving.

42:12.720 --> 42:16.720
 And then what wisdom is the meta, meta problem of puzzle solving?

42:16.720 --> 42:25.720
 Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have when you're solving your puzzles is that you can often fall into self deception.

42:25.720 --> 42:26.720
 You can misfit.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
 Self deception, right.

42:27.720 --> 42:34.720
 So whereas knowledge overcomes ignorance, wisdom is about overcoming foolishness.

42:34.720 --> 42:42.720
 If what we mean by foolishness is self deceptive, self destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition of foolishness.

42:42.720 --> 42:49.720
 And so what you're doing is you're doing this recursive relevance realization.

42:49.720 --> 42:52.720
 You're using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence.

42:52.720 --> 42:56.720
 And then you're using your rationality to improve the use of your rationality.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.720
 That's that recursive relevance realization I was talking about a few minutes ago.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.720
 Think about a wise person.

43:02.720 --> 43:12.720
 They come into highly often messy, ill define, complex situations, usually where there's some significant novelty and what can they do?

43:12.720 --> 43:25.720
 They can zero in on what really matters, what's relevant, and then they can shape themselves, salience landscaping to intervene most appropriately to that situation as they have framed it.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.720
 That's what we mean by a wise person.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.720
 And that's how it follows out of the model I've been presenting to you.

43:31.720 --> 43:36.720
 So when you say self deception, I mean, part of that implies that it's intentional.

43:36.720 --> 43:44.720
 Part of the mechanism of cognition, you're modifying what you should know for some purpose.

43:44.720 --> 43:47.720
 Is that how you see the word self deception?

43:47.720 --> 43:57.720
 No, because I belong to a group of people that think the model of self deception as lying to oneself ultimately makes no sense.

43:57.720 --> 44:06.720
 Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you don't and I have to depend on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.720
 I don't think that's what we do to ourselves.

44:09.720 --> 44:14.720
 I think, and I'm going to use it in the technical term and thank you for making space for that earlier on.

44:14.720 --> 44:21.720
 I think we can bullshit ourselves, which is a very different thing than lying.

44:21.720 --> 44:26.720
 So what is bullshit and how do we bullshit ourselves technically speaking?

44:26.720 --> 44:32.720
 Yeah, Frankfurt and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people's work based on Frankfurt's work.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.720
 On bullshit.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.720
 Yeah, classic essay.

44:35.720 --> 44:36.720
 It's a pretty good title.

44:36.720 --> 44:38.720
 I think it's one of the best things he wrote.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.720
 He wrote a lot of good things.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.720
 The title or the essay?

44:41.720 --> 44:42.720
 The essay.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.720
 The title's good too.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.720
 It's always an icebreaker in certain academic settings.

44:47.720 --> 44:57.720
 So let's contrast the bullshit artists from the liar, the liar depends on your commitment to the truth.

44:57.720 --> 45:11.720
 The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you in depth indifferent to the question of truth and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so that they are catchy to you.

45:11.720 --> 45:20.720
 So, you know, a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial television commercial.

45:20.720 --> 45:33.720
 You watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of alcohol and they're gorgeous and they're laughing and they're smiling and they're clear died.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.720
 You know, that's not true.

45:35.720 --> 45:37.720
 And they know, you know, it's not true.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.720
 But here's the point.

45:39.720 --> 45:46.720
 You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling and they're happy and that's salient to you and that catches your attention.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.720
 And so, you know, go into a bar.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.720
 You know, that won't happen when you drink this alcohol.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.720
 You know it.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.720
 Yeah.

45:54.720 --> 45:58.720
 But you buy the product because it was made salient to you.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.720
 Now, you can't lie to yourself, Lex.

46:01.720 --> 46:05.720
 Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive salience.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.720
 So this is what I can do.

46:07.720 --> 46:15.720
 I can make something salient by paying attention to it and then that will tend to draw me back to it again.

46:15.720 --> 46:26.720
 Which, and you see what happens, which means it tends to catch my attention more so that when I go into the store, that bottle of liquor catches my attention and I buy it.

46:26.720 --> 46:30.720
 And that's, why is that bullshit?

46:30.720 --> 46:43.720
 Because what you're doing is being caught up in the salience of things, independent from whether or not that salience is tracking reality.

46:43.720 --> 46:47.720
 Is it independent or is it loosely connected?

46:47.720 --> 46:57.720
 Because it's not so obvious to me when I see happy people at a bar that I don't in part believe that, well, my experience has been maybe different.

46:57.720 --> 47:05.720
 Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there where it's all happy people dancing.

47:05.720 --> 47:10.720
 In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas is pretty, lots of happy people.

47:10.720 --> 47:16.720
 I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation, although I think it's very, the truth seeking in there.

47:16.720 --> 47:21.720
 Let's say the intent is at least to try and shut off your truth seeking.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.720
 It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent.

47:24.720 --> 47:33.720
 At times, it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much gibberish and you never let it will motivate your behavior.

47:33.720 --> 47:43.720
 There's an episode from the classic Simpsons, not the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons, where there's aliens and they're running for office in the United States.

47:43.720 --> 47:46.720
 Now, I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me, right?

47:46.720 --> 47:52.720
 And the speech goes like this, my fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being a baseball.

47:52.720 --> 47:58.720
 But we must move forward, not backward, upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards freedom.

47:58.720 --> 48:03.720
 And people go, there's a rush, there's nothing there.

48:03.720 --> 48:09.720
 And yet it's great satire because a lot of political speech is exactly like that.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.720
 There's nothing there, right?

48:11.720 --> 48:16.720
 Well, I'm not saying all political speech, I said a lot.

48:16.720 --> 48:22.720
 No, but there's a fundamental difference between, and this is so hilarious, I remember that episode.

48:22.720 --> 48:35.720
 There's a fundamental difference between that absurd sort of nonsecular speech and political speech because one of the things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.

48:35.720 --> 48:50.720
 So if that requires you talking about alternative facts and weird self destructive oxymoronic phrases, isn't that approaching pure bullshit?

48:50.720 --> 48:59.720
 No, I think pure bullshit, like the vacuum is very difficult to get to.

48:59.720 --> 49:08.720
 But I get the point. So what exactly is truth? Is it possible to know?

49:08.720 --> 49:15.720
 I think Spinoza's right about truth, that truth is only known by its own standard, which sounds circular.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.720
 There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.720
 And I think this is also converges with Plato.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.720
 These are two huge influences on me.

49:23.720 --> 49:40.720
 I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we go through some process of self transcendence, when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and the distortions of the earlier frame.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.720
 You have this when you have a moment of insight.

49:42.720 --> 49:54.720
 Insight is you doing, you are realising what is relevant. You go, oh, oh, I thought she was aggressive and angry.

49:54.720 --> 49:59.720
 She's actually really afraid. I was misframing this.

49:59.720 --> 50:04.720
 And you change what you find relevant. You have those aha moments.

50:04.720 --> 50:13.720
 So do you think it's possible to get a sense of objective reality?

50:13.720 --> 50:25.720
 So is it possible to have to get to the ground level of what something that you can call objective truth? Or is it, are we always on shaky ground?

50:25.720 --> 50:33.720
 I think those moments of transcendence can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere.

50:33.720 --> 50:37.720
 And so this is Drew Highland's notion of finite transcendence.

50:37.720 --> 50:48.720
 We are capable of self transcendence and therefore we are creatures who can actually raise the question of truth or goodness or beauty because I think they all share this feature.

50:48.720 --> 51:01.720
 But that doesn't mean we can transcend to a godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere that takes in all information and organizes it in a comprehensive whole.

51:01.720 --> 51:08.720
 But that doesn't mean that truth is thereby rendered valueless.

51:08.720 --> 51:17.720
 I think a better term is real and real and illusory are comparative terms.

51:17.720 --> 51:23.720
 You only know that something's an illusion by taking something else to be real.

51:23.720 --> 51:38.720
 And so we're always in a comparative task, but that doesn't mean that we can somehow jump outside of our framing in some final manner and say, this is how it is from a God's eye point of view.

51:38.720 --> 51:45.720
 So what do you think if I may ask of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism?

51:45.720 --> 51:54.720
 So where the core principle is that reality exists independently of consciousness and that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception.

51:54.720 --> 51:59.720
 So they have that you do have that ability to know reality.

51:59.720 --> 52:00.720
 There's two things.

52:00.720 --> 52:06.720
 Knowing that there's an independent reality is not knowing that independent reality.

52:06.720 --> 52:07.720
 Those are not the same thing.

52:07.720 --> 52:16.720
 Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is able to have contact with that.

52:16.720 --> 52:35.720
 Then I would respond and say, I believe in fact ultimately in a conformity theory of knowing that the deepest kind of knowing is when there's a contact, a conformity between the mind, with the embodied mind and reality.

52:35.720 --> 52:40.720
 But and here's where I guess I'd push back on Rand.

52:40.720 --> 52:49.720
 I would say you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge because if you don't, you're going to fall prey to Mino's paradox.

52:49.720 --> 52:53.720
 Mino's paradox is, you know, this is in Plato, right?

52:53.720 --> 52:59.720
 To know P. Well, if I don't know P, I'm going to go looking for it.

52:59.720 --> 53:03.720
 But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I found it?

53:03.720 --> 53:05.720
 I have no way of recognizing it.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.720
 I have no way of knowing that I've found it.

53:07.720 --> 53:12.720
 So I must know P, but if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.720
 I don't need to go searching.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.720
 So learning doesn't exist.

53:16.720 --> 53:18.720
 Knowledge is impossible.

53:18.720 --> 53:22.720
 The way you break out of that paradox is saying, no, no, no, it is partial.

53:22.720 --> 53:25.720
 It is possible to partially know something.

53:25.720 --> 53:32.720
 I can know it enough that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that's not the same as having a complete grasp of it.

53:32.720 --> 53:37.720
 Because I still have to search and find what I don't yet possess in my knowledge.

53:37.720 --> 53:42.720
 So partial knowledge has to be real knowledge.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.720
 Right. Partial knowledge is still knowledge.

53:44.720 --> 53:45.720
 Yes.

53:45.720 --> 53:51.720
 What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman, who thinks the reality is an illusion?

53:51.720 --> 53:59.720
 So complete illusion that we're given this actually really nice definition or idea that you talked about,

53:59.720 --> 54:04.720
 that there's a tension between the illusory and what is real.

54:04.720 --> 54:17.720
 He says that basically we take in that and we ran with the real to the point where the real is not at all connected to some kind of physical reality.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.720
 Well, I hope to talk to him at some point.

54:19.720 --> 54:24.720
 We were supposed to talk at one point, and so I have to talk in his absence.

54:24.720 --> 54:31.720
 I think that, first of all, I think saying that everything in his illusion is like saying everything is tall.

54:31.720 --> 54:32.720
 It doesn't make any sense.

54:32.720 --> 54:33.720
 It's a comparative term.

54:33.720 --> 54:41.720
 You have to say, against this standard of realness, this is an illusion.

54:41.720 --> 54:57.720
 And he uses arguments like from evolution, which are problematic to me because it's like, well, you seem to be saying that evolution is true, that it really exists.

54:57.720 --> 55:05.720
 And then some of our cognition and our perception has access to reality.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.720
 Math and presumably some science has access to reality.

55:09.720 --> 55:17.720
 And then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory.

55:17.720 --> 55:27.720
 But we do have some contact with reality whereby we can make the arguments as to why most of your experience, most of your everyday experience is an illusion.

55:27.720 --> 55:30.720
 But to me, that's not a novel thing.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.720
 That's Descartes.

55:32.720 --> 55:38.720
 That's the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy, but the math is what connects us to reality.

55:38.720 --> 55:41.720
 That's how he interpreted the Copernican Revolution.

55:41.720 --> 55:46.720
 Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over and set, and it's all an illusion.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.720
 But the math gets us to the reality.

55:49.720 --> 55:59.720
 Well, I think he makes a deeper point that most of cognition is just evolved and operates in the illusory world.

55:59.720 --> 56:03.720
 How does he know that things like cognition and evolution exist?

56:03.720 --> 56:09.720
 I think there's an important distinction between evolution and cognition.

56:09.720 --> 56:11.720
 That's not the point I'm making.

56:11.720 --> 56:16.720
 I'm making a point that he's claiming that there are two things that really exist.

56:16.720 --> 56:19.720
 Why are they privileged?

56:19.720 --> 56:25.720
 He basically says that, look, the process of evolution makes sense.

56:25.720 --> 56:31.720
 It makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple organisms through the natural selection process.

56:31.720 --> 56:35.720
 Here's how you get to transfer information from generation to generation.

56:35.720 --> 56:36.720
 It makes sense.

56:36.720 --> 56:48.720
 And then he says that there's no requirement for the cognition to evolve in a way that it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the physical reality.

56:48.720 --> 56:56.720
 Except that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of evolution, and you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing.

56:56.720 --> 57:04.720
 Evolution depends on Darwinian theory, genetics, it depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.720
 It depends on how chromosomes are structured.

57:07.720 --> 57:16.720
 Actually, that's an interesting question to him, where I don't know if he actually would push back on this, is how do you know evolution is real?

57:16.720 --> 57:18.720
 Yes.

57:18.720 --> 57:33.720
 I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we constructed, that in some sense it is connected to reality, but we don't have a clear picture of it.

57:33.720 --> 57:57.720
 I mean, that's an intellectually honest statement then, if most of our cognition as thinking beings is operating at every level in an illusory world, then it makes sense that one of the main theories of science that's evolution is also a complete part of this illusory world.

57:57.720 --> 57:58.720
 Right.

57:58.720 --> 58:04.720
 But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion that cognition is illusory?

58:04.720 --> 58:16.720
 I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an explanation of why the world is of our cognition operating in an illusory world, but that's just one of the explanations.

58:16.720 --> 58:24.720
 I think the deeper question is, why do we think we have contact with reality, with physical reality?

58:24.720 --> 58:47.720
 We could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by our minds in a way that makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it's somebody playing a video game, or we're trying to, through the process of distributed cognition, construct more and more complex objects.

58:47.720 --> 58:55.720
 Why does it have to be connected to physics and planets and all that kind of stuff?

58:55.720 --> 59:08.720
 Okay, so if we're going to say, we're now considering it as a possibility rather than it's a conclusion based on arguments, because the arguments, again, will always rely on stipulating that there is something that is known.

59:08.720 --> 59:10.720
 These are the features of cognition.

59:10.720 --> 59:12.720
 Cognition is capable of illusion.

59:12.720 --> 59:13.720
 That's a true statement.

59:13.720 --> 59:15.720
 You're somehow in contact with the mind.

59:15.720 --> 59:21.720
 Why does the mind have this privileged contact and other aspects like my body do not?

59:21.720 --> 59:25.720
 But let's put that aside, and now let's just consider it.

59:25.720 --> 59:29.720
 Now, when we put it that way, it's not an epistemic question anymore.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.720
 It's an existential question, and here's my reply to you.

59:31.720 --> 59:33.720
 There's two possibilities.

59:33.720 --> 59:42.720
 Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover, sort of, you know, the matrix on steroids or something.

59:42.720 --> 59:43.720
 There's no way.

59:43.720 --> 59:48.720
 What I do, I can't find out that it's an illusion.

59:48.720 --> 59:54.720
 Or it's an illusion, but I can find out that it's an illusion.

59:54.720 --> 59:56.720
 Those are the two possibilities.

59:56.720 --> 1:00:07.720
 Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities, because if I could not possibly find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention to that possibility.

1:00:07.720 --> 1:00:11.720
 So I could keep doing the science as I'm doing it.

1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:19.720
 If there's a way of finding out, science is my best bet, I believe, for finding out what's true and what's an illusion.

1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:21.720
 So I keep doing what I'm doing.

1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:26.720
 So it's an argument, if you move it to that, that makes no existential difference to me.

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:30.720
 Oh, man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument.

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:33.720
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:37.720
 Nobody's saying science doesn't work.

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:46.720
 It's an interesting question, just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a question, can we build a machine that makes us fly?

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:56.720
 In that same way, we're asking a question to which we don't know an answer, but we may know in the future how much of this whole thing is an illusion.

1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:00.720
 And I think in a second category, the first guy, I forgot which one.

1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:03.720
 Yes, science will be able to help us discover this.

1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:07.720
 Otherwise, yes, for sure, it doesn't matter.

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:12.720
 If we're living in a simulation and we can't find out at all, then it doesn't matter.

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:27.720
 But yes, the whole point is, as we get deeper and deeper understanding of our mind of cognition, we might be able to discover how much of this is a big charade constructed by our mind to keep us fed or something like that.

1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:35.720
 Some weird very simplistic explanation that it will ultimately, in its simplicity, be beautiful.

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:56.720
 Or as we try to build robots and instill them with consciousness, with ability to feel those kinds of things, we'll discover, well, let's just trick them into thinking they feel and have consciousness.

1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:57.720
 And they'll believe it.

1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:00.720
 And then they'll have a deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives.

1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:05.720
 And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way that will make our lives more meaningful.

1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:14.720
 And then all of a sudden, it's like at the end of Animal Farm, you look at pigs and humans, you look at robots and humans, you can't tell the difference between either.

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:21.720
 And we, in that way, start to understand that much of this existence could be an illusion.

1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:23.720
 Okay, well, I have two responses to that.

1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:43.720
 First is the progress that's being made on like AGI is about making whatever the system is that's going to be the source of intelligence more and more dynamically and recursively self correcting.

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.720
 That's part of what's happening.

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:56.720
 Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and better at self correcting, but that's exactly what I was describing before as the transformative theory of truth.

1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:08.720
 The other response to that is science, like people think of science just as, right, sort of end proposition.

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:15.720
 Let me just use the evolutionary example again, right?

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.720
 If I'm gathering the evidence, I need to know a lot of geology.

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:19.720
 I need to know plate tectonics.

1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:21.720
 I need to know about radioactive decay.

1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:23.720
 I need to know about genetics.

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:28.720
 And then in order to measure all those things, I need to know how microscopes work.

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:30.720
 I need to know how pencils and paper work.

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.720
 I need to know how rulers work.

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:38.720
 I need to know how English, like you can't isolate knowledge that way.

1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:47.720
 And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion, then you're in a weird position of saying somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim.

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:49.720
 I think it goes in reverse.

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:59.720
 If you think this is the truth claim, right, the measuring and all the things that scientists would do to gather on all the ways the theories are converging together.

1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:04.720
 That also has to be fundamentally right because it's not like Lego.

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:07.720
 It is an interwoven whole.

1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:13.720
 Yes, it definitely is interwoven, but I love how I play that I'm playing the devil advocate for the illusion world.

1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:22.720
 But there's a consistent, I mean, there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply consistent across an entire system.

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:27.720
 But inside a video game, that's some kind of, that's some same kind of consistency evolves.

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:34.720
 There's rules about interactions and game theoretic patterns about what's good and bad and so on.

1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:43.720
 And there's sources of joy and fear and anger and then understanding about a world, what happens in different dynamics of a video game, even simple video games.

1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:53.720
 So there's no, you know, even inside an illusion, you can have consistency and develop truths inside that illusion.

1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:58.720
 And iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion.

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.720
 Okay, but that comes back.

1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:07.720
 Is that process genuinely self correcting or are you in the simulation in which there is no possible doorway out?

1:05:07.720 --> 1:05:12.720
 Because if my argument is, if you find one or two doorways, that feeds back.

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:18.720
 In fact, you can't just say, this is the little tiny island where we have the truth. That's the point I'm making.

1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:23.720
 Right. But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that's the case.

1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:29.720
 And what if you find a doorway and you step out, but you're yet in another simulation?

1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:33.720
 I mean, that's the point. That's so self correcting.

1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:41.720
 When you fix the self deception, you don't know if there's other bigger self deceptions you're operating on.

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:43.720
 Of course, in one sense, that's right.

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:50.720
 But again, we're back to when I step into the second simulation, is it, can I get the doorway out of that?

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:57.720
 Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you basically said, I have a simulation that I can never get out of.

1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:01.720
 Yeah, I think there's always a bigger pile of bullshit is the claim I'm trying to make here.

1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:09.720
 Okay, let me dance around meaning once more.

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:21.720
 I often ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I talk to in a room when I'm all by myself, the question of the meaning of life.

1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:31.720
 Do you think this is a useful question? You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful question?

1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:36.720
 No, I think it's like the question, what's north of the North Pole or what time is it on the sun?

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:45.720
 It sounds like a question, but it's actually not really a question because it has a presupposition in it that I think is fundamentally flawed.

1:06:45.720 --> 1:07:01.720
 If I understand what people mean by it, and it's actually often not that clear, but when they talk about the meaning of life, they are talking about there are some feature of the universe in and of itself that I have to discover and enter into a relationship with.

1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:14.720
 And there's in that sense a plan for me or something. And so that's a property of the universe. That's a very deep serious metaphysical ontological claim.

1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:17.720
 You're claiming to know something fundamental about the structure of reality.

1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:27.720
 There were times when people thought they had a worldview that legitimated it like God is running the universe and therefore, and God cares about you and there's a plan, et cetera.

1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:36.720
 But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not, meaning is like the graspability.

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:46.720
 Remember I talked about optimal grip. It's like the graspability of that cup. Is that in me? No. Is it in the cup? No, because the fly can't grasp it.

1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:57.720
 Well, graspability is in my hand. Well, I can't grasp Africa. No, no. There is a real relation fittedness between me in this cup.

1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:03.720
 Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism. Is the adaptivity of a great white shark in the great white shark? Drop it in the sohara.

1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:16.720
 It dies. Meaning isn't in me. I think that's romantic bullshit. And it isn't in the universe. It is a proper relationship.

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:22.720
 I've coined the phrase transjective. It is the binding relationship between this objective and the objective.

1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:32.720
 And therefore, when you're asking the question about the meaning of life, you are, I think, misrepresenting the nature of meaning.

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:39.720
 Just like when you ask what time is it on the sun, you're misrepresenting how we derive clock time.

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:46.720
 At the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis, let me hard disagree.

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:51.720
 But I think we probably agree. But it's just like a dance, like any dialogue.

1:08:51.720 --> 1:09:11.720
 I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and the glass of water, between whatever the forces of the universe that created the planets, the proteins,

1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:23.720
 the multi cell organisms, the intelligent early humans, the beautiful human civilizations and the technologies that will overtake them.

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:41.720
 It's trying to understand the relevance realization of the big bang to the feeling of love you have for another human being.

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:49.720
 It's reaching for that even though it's hopeless to understand. The asking of the question is the reaching.

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:57.720
 Now, it is, in fact, romantic bullshit, technically speaking.

1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:09.720
 But it could be that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life and the source of its deepest meaning.

1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:16.720
 Well, I hope not. But technically speaking, romantic bullshit, meaning romantic.

1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:18.720
 In the philosophical sense, yes.

1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:27.720
 So, I mean, what is poetry? What is music? What is the magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music? What is that?

1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:35.720
 Oh, but that's exactly to my point. Is music inside you or is it outside you? It's both and neither.

1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:42.720
 And that's precisely why you find it so meaningful. In fact, it can be so meaningful you can regard it as sacred.

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:54.720
 What you said, I don't think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement, right? What you said is, no, no, no, there is, there's a way in which reality is realizing itself.

1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:06.720
 And I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship that the sort of meta optimal grip to what is most real.

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:15.720
 I totally agree. I totally think that's one of the things I said this earlier. One of our meta desires is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.

1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:24.720
 I do this with my students. I'll say, you know, because romantic relationships sort of take the role of God and religion and history and culture for us right now.

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:28.720
 We put everything on them and that's why they break. But, right?

1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:39.720
 Strong words. Got it. But I'll say to them, okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic relationships? Put up your hands and I'll say, okay, I'm not only talking to these people.

1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:48.720
 Of those people, how many of you would want to know your partner's cheating on you even if it means the destruction of the relationship? 95% of them put up their hands.

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:58.720
 And I say, but why? And here's my students who are usually all sort of bitten with cynicism and postmodernism and they'll just say spontaneously, well, because it's not real.

1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:12.720
 Because it's not real. Right. So I think what you're pointing to is actually, you're pointing not to an objective or a subjective thing.

1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:19.720
 Romanticism says it's subjective. There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean empiricism says it's objective.

1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:28.720
 But you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality realization. And can I get relevance realization to be optimally gripping in the best right relationship with it?

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:37.720
 And there's good reason you can because think about it. Your relevance realization isn't just representing properties of the world. It's instantiating it.

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:47.720
 There's something very similar to biological evolution, which is that the guts of life, if I'm right, running your cognition is not just that you all have ideas.

1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:54.720
 You actually instantiate. That's what I mean by conformity. The same principles, they're within and without. They don't belong to you subjectively.

1:12:54.720 --> 1:13:03.720
 They're not just out there. They're both at the same time. And they help to explain how you're actually bound to the evolutionary world.

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:11.720
 Yeah. So it comes from both inside and from the outside. But that's still the question of the meaning of life.

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:22.720
 First of all, the big benefit of that question is that it shakes you out of your hamster in a wheel that is daily life, the mundane process of daily life.

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:36.720
 Where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids, you have to take them to school, then you go to work and repeat over and over and over and over. And then you get increased salary and then you upgrade the home and that whole process.

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:57.720
 Meaning, asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit that if you just allow yourself to take it seriously for a second, it forces you to pause and think, like, what's going on here?

1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:15.720
 And then it ultimately, I think, does return to the question of meaning in those mundane things. What gives my life joy? What gives it lasting deliciousness? Where do I notice the magic and how can I have that magic return again and again?

1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:38.720
 Beauty. And that ultimately what it returns to. But it's the same thing you do when you look up to the sky. You spend most of your day hurrying around looking at things on the surface. But when you look up to the sky and you see the stars, it fills you with the feeling of awe that forces you to pause and think in full context of, like, what the hell is going on here?

1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:57.720
 That, but also I think there is a, when you think too much about the meaning of a glass and relevance realization of a glass, you don't necessarily get at the core of what makes music beautiful.

1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:19.720
 So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first. And I think meaning of life forces you to really go to the Big Bang and go to the universe and the whole thing, the origin of life. And I think sometimes you have to start there to discover the meaning in the day to day, I think.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:23.720
 But perhaps you would disagree.

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:39.720
 Insofar as the question makes you ask about the whole of your life and how much meaning is in the whole of your life. And insofar as it asks how much that is connected to reality, it's a good question.

1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:46.720
 But it's a bad question in that it also makes you look for the answers in the wrong way.

1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:59.720
 Now you said, and I agree with what you said, how we really answer this question is we come back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning in life is connected to reality. We pursue wisdom.

1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:07.720
 And so for me, I don't need that question in order to provoke me into that stance.

1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:10.720
 So let's return to the meaning crisis.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:19.720
 Yes. What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times? What's its origin? What's its explanation?

1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:32.720
 Well, remember what I said, what I argued, that the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent subject us to perennial problems of self deception, self destruction, creating bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that.

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:44.720
 And that can cause, you know, anxiety, existential anxiety, it can cause despair, it can cause a sense of absurdity.

1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:54.720
 These are perennial problems. And across cultures and across historical periods, human beings have come up with ecologies of practices.

1:16:54.720 --> 1:17:07.720
 There's no one practice. There's no panacea practice. They've come up with ecologies of practices for ameliorating that self deception and enhancing that fittedness, that connectedness that's at the core of meaning in life.

1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:12.720
 That's prototypically what we call wisdom.

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:21.720
 And here's how I can show you one clear instance of the meaning crisis is it's a wisdom famine.

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:25.720
 I can, I do this regularly with my students.

1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:30.720
 In the classroom, I'll say, where do you go for information? They hold up their phone.

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:36.720
 Where do you go for knowledge? They're a little bit slower and probably because they're in my class, they'll say, well, science, the university.

1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:43.720
 I'll say, where do you go for wisdom? There's a silence.

1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:51.720
 Wisdom isn't optional. That's why it is perennial, cross cultural, cross historical because of the perennial problems.

1:17:51.720 --> 1:18:02.720
 But we do not have homes for ecologies of practices that fit into our scientific technological worldview so that they are considered legitimate.

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:11.720
 The fastest growing demographic group are the nuns, NONESs. They have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic.

1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:20.720
 They most frequently describe themselves with this very, this has become almost everybody now described, I'm spiritual, but not religious,

1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:28.720
 which means they are trying to find a way of reducing the bullshit and enhancing the connectedness,

1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:35.720
 but they don't want to turn to any of the legacy established religions by and large.

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:44.720
 Well, isn't both religion and the nuns, isn't wisdom a process, not a destination?

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:52.720
 So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful religious person, you're also trying to find, right?

1:18:52.720 --> 1:19:03.720
 So just because you have a place where you're looking or a set of traditions around which you're constructing the search, it's nevertheless a search.

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:10.720
 So I guess, is there a case to be made that this is just the usual human condition?

1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:16.720
 How do you answer, if you asked five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom?

1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:24.720
 I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to answer while the Bible or a religious text.

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:31.720
 Right, and they had a worldview that was considered not just religious, but also rational.

1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:39.720
 So we now have these two things, orthogonal or often oppositional, spirituality and rationality.

1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:46.720
 But if you go before a particular historical period, you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition, like before the scientific revolution,

1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:49.720
 those two are not in opposition.

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:58.720
 They are deeply interwoven so that you can have a sense of legitimacy and deep realness and grounding in your practices.

1:19:58.720 --> 1:20:01.720
 We don't have that anymore and I'm not advocating for religion.

1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:03.720
 Neither am I an enemy of religion.

1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:05.720
 I'll strengthen your case, by the way.

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:13.720
 So one of my RAs did research and you get people who have committed themselves to cultivating wisdom

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:20.720
 and you can look at people within religious traditions and people who are doing it in a purely secular framework.

1:20:20.720 --> 1:20:31.720
 By many of the measures we use to study wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious paths do better than the secular.

1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:37.720
 But here's the important point, there's no significant difference between the religious paths.

1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:45.720
 So it's not like if you're following the path of Judaism, you're more likely to end up wiser than if you follow Buddhism.

1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:51.720
 By the way, I don't know if that's my case. I was making the case that you don't need to have a religious affiliation to search for wisdom.

1:20:51.720 --> 1:20:59.720
 It's that I thought along to the point you just made that it doesn't matter which religious affiliation or none.

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:01.720
 But that's what I'm saying.

1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:03.720
 Okay, so this is the tricky thing we're in.

1:21:03.720 --> 1:21:09.720
 It does matter if you're in one, but it doesn't matter sort of the propositional creeds of that.

1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:11.720
 There's something else at work.

1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:19.720
 If you allow me this, there's a functionality to religion that we lost when we rejected all the propositional dogma.

1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:24.720
 But there's a functionality there that we don't know how to recreate.

1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:30.720
 What is that? Can you try to speak to that? What is that functionality? What is that? Why is that so useful?

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:40.720
 A bunch of stories, a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are drenched in deep lessons about morality and all those kinds of things.

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:48.720
 What's the functional thing there that can't be replaced without a religious text by a nonreligious text?

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:52.720
 This is, for me, the golden question, so thank you.

1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:54.720
 Do you have an answer?

1:21:54.720 --> 1:22:01.720
 Yeah, I think I have a significant answer. I don't think it's complete, but I think it's important.

1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:10.720
 This is to step before the Cartesian revolution and think about many different kinds of knowing.

1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:17.720
 This is now something that is prominent within what's called 4e cognitive science, the kind of cognitive science I practice.

1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:21.720
 There's a lot of converging evidence for these different ways of knowing.

1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:24.720
 There's propositional knowing. This is what we are most familiar with.

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:29.720
 In fact, it almost has a tyrannical status.

1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:34.720
 This is knowing that something is the case, like the cats or mammals, and it's stored in semantic memory,

1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:39.720
 and we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction.

1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:44.720
 There's procedural knowing. This is knowing how to do something.

1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:49.720
 Skills are not theories. They're not beliefs. They're not true or false.

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:57.720
 They engage the world or they don't, and they are stored in a different kind of memory, procedural memory.

1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:01.720
 Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory.

1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:05.720
 That's why you have the prototypical story of somebody suffering Alzheimer's,

1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:10.720
 and they're losing all kinds of facts, but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly.

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:14.720
 Same kind of argument. There is perspectival knowing.

1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:19.720
 This is knowing what it's like to be you here now in this situation, in this state of mind,

1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:24.720
 the whole field of your salience landscaping, what it's like to be you here now,

1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:28.720
 and you have a specific kind of memory around that, episodic memory,

1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:32.720
 and you have a different sense, you have a different criterion of realness.

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:37.720
 So you can get this by, well, my friend Dan Ciapia and I,

1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:40.720
 we studied the scientists using moving the rovers around,

1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:42.720
 or you can take a look at people who are doing VR.

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:47.720
 People talk about, you know, they want to really be in the game.

1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:50.720
 That makes it real. They don't mean verisimilitude.

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:54.720
 You can get that, right, sense of being in the game with something like Tetris,

1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:58.720
 which doesn't look like the real world,

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.720
 and you can fail to have it in a video game that has a lot of verisimilitude.

1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:08.720
 It's about, again, this kind of connectedness that we're talking about.

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:12.720
 If I may interrupt, is that connected to the hard problem of consciousness,

1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:15.720
 the subject, the qualia, or is that a different,

1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:18.720
 that kind of knowing, is that different from the qualia of consciousness?

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:21.720
 I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the adjuctival

1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:24.720
 and the adverbial qualia, so I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia

1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:26.720
 much more than with the adjuctival.

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:31.720
 So the adjuctival qualia are like the greenness of green and the blueness of blue.

1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:39.720
 The adverbial qualia are the hereness, the nowness, the togetherness.

1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:44.720
 And I think the perspectival knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:47.720
 Adjuctival qualia and adverbial qualia.

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:49.720
 I'm learning so many new things today.

1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:53.720
 Okay, so that's another way of knowing.

1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:55.720
 Right, the perspectival, and then there's a deeper one.

1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:57.720
 And this is a philosophical point.

1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:03.720
 We can go through the argument, but you don't have to know that you know in order to know,

1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:06.720
 because if you start doing that, you get an infinite regress.

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:11.720
 There has to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean you know that you know that.

1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:13.720
 Yeah, of course.

1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:15.720
 Okay, great.

1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:18.720
 Well, there was a lot of ink spilled over that over a 40 year period.

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.720
 By philosophers, they spill.

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:21.720
 This is what they do.

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:22.720
 They spill ink.

1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:23.720
 Yeah, but I want to talk about...

1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:24.720
 They can pay for ink spillage.

1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:28.720
 So I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing.

1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:35.720
 This is the idea that you and the world are coparticipating in things and such that real

1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:37.720
 affordances exist between you.

1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.720
 So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity.

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.720
 So the affordance of walking becomes available to me.

1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:50.720
 Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped by my biology.

1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:54.720
 And so affordances for that are here.

1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:56.720
 Look at this cup.

1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:01.720
 Shared physics, shared sort of biological factors.

1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:02.720
 Look at my hand.

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:03.720
 I'm bipedal.

1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:06.720
 Also, culture is shaping me and shaping this.

1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:09.720
 I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup.

1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:14.720
 So this is an agent arena relationship, right?

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.720
 There's identities being created in your agency.

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:21.720
 Identities being created in the world as an arena.

1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:23.720
 So you and the world fit together.

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:29.720
 You know when that's missing, when you're really lonely or you're homesick or you're

1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:30.720
 suffering culture shock.

1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:33.720
 So this is participatory knowing.

1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:38.720
 And it comes with a sense of belonging.

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:39.720
 At every level.

1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:43.720
 So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing.

1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:44.720
 Yes.

1:26:44.720 --> 1:26:45.720
 Yes.

1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:51.720
 That there's a dance between the physics that enables this process and just participating

1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:54.720
 in the process is the act of knowing.

1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:55.720
 Right.

1:26:55.720 --> 1:26:59.720
 And there's a really weird form of memory you have for this kind of knowing.

1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:01.720
 It's called yourself.

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:02.720
 What?

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:03.720
 Can you elaborate?

1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:10.720
 So we talked about how all the different other kinds of knowing had specific kinds of memory,

1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:13.720
 semantic memory for propositional procedural, right?

1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:16.720
 Episodic for perspectival.

1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:22.720
 What's the kind of memory that is the coordinated storehouse of all of your agent arena relationships,

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:28.720
 all the roles you can take, all the identities you can assume, all the identities you can assign?

1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:29.720
 What's the self?

1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:31.720
 Do you mean like consciousness or like?

1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:33.720
 Do you mean your sense of self?

1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.720
 Sense of self in this world that's not consciousness.

1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:40.720
 That's like an agency or something.

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:41.720
 Right.

1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:42.720
 It's an agent arena relationship.

1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:49.720
 And so in an agent arena relationship, it's the sense of the agent.

1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:52.720
 And that the agent belongs in that arena.

1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:58.720
 Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is, because it's probably a bunch of different

1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:01.720
 framings of how you experience that.

1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:02.720
 Yeah.

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:03.720
 And you do.

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:09.720
 You have all, within your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles that are somehow contributing to that identity,

1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.720
 but are not equivalent to that identity.

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:13.720
 Yeah.

1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:21.720
 I wonder if like my two hands have different, because there's a different experience of me picking up something with my right hand

1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:23.720
 and then my left hand.

1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:24.720
 So.

1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:27.720
 Are those like?

1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:29.720
 That's a really cool question, Lex.

1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:34.720
 They certainly feel like their own things.

1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:39.720
 But that could be just anthropomorphization based on cultural narratives and so on.

1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:40.720
 It could.

1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:41.720
 It could.

1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:44.720
 But I think it's a legitimate empirical question because it also could be sort of Ian McGillchrist stuff.

1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:51.720
 It could be you're using different hemispheres and they sort of have different agent arena relationships to the environment.

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.720
 This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self.

1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:59.720
 Does that hemispheric difference mean you're multiple or you actually have a singular self?

1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:03.720
 Oh, so it's important to understand how many cells are there.

1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:04.720
 Yes, I think so.

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:07.720
 But that's just like a quirk of evolution.

1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:13.720
 It's not, surely it can be fundamental to cognition, having multiple cells or a singular self.

1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:22.720
 It depends, again, because we're getting far from the answer to the question you originally asked me.

1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:24.720
 Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one?

1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:25.720
 Which question?

1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:26.720
 I already forgot everything.

1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:28.720
 What's the functionality of religion?

1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:29.720
 Yes.

1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:30.720
 Okay.

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:33.720
 And then we can return to the self.

1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:34.720
 Okay.

1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:45.720
 So you said, you know, you have all these propositions and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ from the religions and they're not, they don't seem to be considered legitimate by many people.

1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:52.720
 But yet there's something functioning in the religions that is transforming people and making them wiser.

1:29:52.720 --> 1:30:03.720
 And I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring at those non propositional levels, the procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory.

1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:08.720
 And those are the ones, by the way, that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making.

1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:18.720
 Because remember, the propositions are representational and they're dependent on the non propositional, non representational processes of connectedness and relevance realization.

1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:21.720
 So religion goes down deep to the non propositional and works there.

1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:24.720
 That's the functionality we need to grasp.

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:30.720
 Well, you talk about tools, essentially, that humans are able to incorporate into their cognition.

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:39.720
 Psycho technologies, like language is one, I suppose, isn't religion then a psychotechnology?

1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:42.720
 It would be a, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies.

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:43.720
 Yes.

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:48.720
 And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead.

1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:51.720
 Do we have to invent the new thing?

1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:56.720
 Go from the old phone, create the iPhone, invent the new psychotechnology.

1:30:56.720 --> 1:30:58.720
 It takes place of religion.

1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:03.720
 And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text goes into the marketplace, who's he talking to?

1:31:03.720 --> 1:31:05.720
 He's not talking to the believers.

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:07.720
 He's talking to the atheists.

1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:10.720
 And he says, do you not realize what we have done?

1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:11.720
 Right?

1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:14.720
 We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.

1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:15.720
 We are now forever falling.

1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:17.720
 We are unchained from the sun.

1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:19.720
 We have to become worthy of this.

1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:20.720
 Yeah.

1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:22.720
 Well, Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit.

1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:23.720
 No, no, no, no.

1:31:23.720 --> 1:31:24.720
 But there's a point there.

1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:25.720
 Yes.

1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:27.720
 The point is, right?

1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:34.720
 The one thing to rejecting the proposition, there's another project of replacing the functionality

1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:37.720
 that we lost when we reject the religion.

1:31:37.720 --> 1:31:46.720
 So his worry that as nihilism takes hold, you don't ever replace the thing that religion,

1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:49.720
 the role that religion played in our world.

1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:53.720
 Maybe it's hard to tell what he actually, because he's so multivocal.

1:31:53.720 --> 1:31:56.720
 I'll speak for me, rather than for Nietzsche.

1:31:56.720 --> 1:32:03.720
 I think it is possible to using the best cognitive science and respectfully exapting what we

1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:09.720
 can from the best religion and philosophy, philosophical traditions, because there's

1:32:09.720 --> 1:32:13.720
 things like stoicism that are in the gray line between philosophy and religion.

1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:15.720
 Buddhism is the same.

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:23.720
 Doing that best cocci, that best exaptation, we can come up with that functionality without

1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:29.720
 having to buy into the particular propositional sets of the legacy religions.

1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:31.720
 That's my proposal.

1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:33.720
 I call that the religion that's not a religion.

1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:39.720
 So things like stoicism or modern stoicism, those things, don't you think in some sense

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:42.720
 they naturally emerge?

1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:45.720
 Don't you think there's a longing for meaning?

1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:53.720
 So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a significant meaning crisis in the

1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:59.720
 ancient world because of what had happened after the breakup of Alexander the Great's empire.

1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:07.720
 So if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after Alexander, so Aristotle grows up

1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:13.720
 in a place where everybody speaks the same language, has the same religion, his ancestors

1:33:13.720 --> 1:33:15.720
 have been there for years, he knows everybody.

1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:21.720
 After Alexander the Great's empire is broken up, people are now thousands of miles away

1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:23.720
 from the government.

1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:26.720
 They're surrounded by people because of the dysporas, right?

1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:28.720
 The diasporas, I should say.

1:33:28.720 --> 1:33:31.720
 They're surrounded by people that don't speak their language, don't share their religion.

1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:34.720
 That's why you get all these mother religions emerging, right?

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:37.720
 Universal mother religions like ISIS, etc.

1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:40.720
 So there is what's called domicite.

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:46.720
 There's the killing of home, there's a loss of a sense of home and belonging and fittedness

1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:52.720
 during the Hellenistic period and stoicism arose specifically to address that.

1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:58.720
 And because it was designed to address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence that it is coming back

1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:00.720
 into prominence right now.

1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:03.720
 Well, there could be a lot of other variations.

1:34:03.720 --> 1:34:04.720
 Oh, totally.

1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:10.720
 It feels like, I think when you speak of the meaning crisis, you're in part describing,

1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:14.720
 not prescribing, you're describing something that is happening.

1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:23.720
 But I would venture to say that if we just leave things be, the meaning crisis dissipates

1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:28.720
 because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas.

1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:33.720
 So this distributed cognition process that gives us meaning.

1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:39.720
 So if religion loses power, we'll find other institutions that are sources of meaning.

1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:40.720
 I don't.

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.720
 Is that your intuition as well?

1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:46.720
 I think we are already doing that.

1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:54.720
 I am involved with and do participant observation of many of these emerging communities

1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:00.720
 that are creating ecologies of practice that are specifically about trying to address the meaning crisis.

1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:06.720
 I just, in late July, I went to Washington state and did Rafe Kelly's Evolve Move Play,

1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:11.720
 Return to the Source, and one of the most challenging things I've ever done.

1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:13.720
 That guy is awesome, by the way.

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:15.720
 I've gotten to interact with him a long, long time ago.

1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:17.720
 He said to say hi to you, by the way.

1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:18.720
 Yeah.

1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:19.720
 It's from another world.

1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:25.720
 It feels like a different world because I interacted with him, not directly.

1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:33.720
 This is somebody, maybe you can speak to what he works on, but he makes movement and play.

1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:36.720
 He encourages people to make that a part of their life.

1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:41.720
 How you move about the world, whether that's as part of athletic endeavors

1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:45.720
 or actually just walking around a city.

1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:46.720
 Yeah.

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.720
 I think the reason I ran into him is because there was a lot of interest in that,

1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:55.720
 in the athletic world, in the grappling world, in the Brazilian jiu jitsu world.

1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:02.720
 People who study movement, who make movement part of their lives to see how can we integrate play and fun.

1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:08.720
 And just the basic humanness that's natural to our movement.

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:10.720
 How do we integrate that into our daily practice?

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:14.720
 So this is yet another way to find meaning.

1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:17.720
 I think it's actually an exemplar of what I was talking about

1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:25.720
 because what's going on with Rafe's integration of parkour in nature and martial arts

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:33.720
 and mindfulness practices and dialogical practices is exactly, and explicitly so, by the way.

1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:36.720
 He will tell you he's been very influenced by my work.

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:41.720
 He's trying to get at the non propositional kinds of knowing that make meaning

1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:46.720
 by evolving our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance realization

1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:50.720
 because that gives people profound improved sense of connectedness to themselves,

1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:52.720
 to each other and the world.

1:36:52.720 --> 1:37:00.720
 And I'll tell you, Alex, I don't want to say too specifically the final thing that people did

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.720
 because it's part of his secret sauce.

1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:07.720
 But what I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said,

1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:10.720
 as far as I can tell, none of you are religious, right?

1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:12.720
 And they go, yeah, yeah.

1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:15.720
 But what you just did was a religious act, wasn't it?

1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:17.720
 Yeah, it was.

1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:18.720
 Yeah.

1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:20.720
 So that same magic was there.

1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:22.720
 Yes.

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:23.720
 Bathroom break?

1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:24.720
 Sure.

1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:29.720
 What's your take on atheism in general?

1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:39.720
 Is it closer to truth than maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a person who believes in God?

1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:46.720
 So I'm a nontheist, which means I think the shared set of presuppositions between the theist and the atheist

1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:50.720
 are actually what needs to be rejected.

1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:52.720
 Can you explain that further?

1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:55.720
 Yes, I can.

1:37:55.720 --> 1:38:03.720
 And I want to point out, by the way, that there are lots of nontheistic religious traditions.

1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:08.720
 So I'm not coming up with a sort of airy fairy category.

1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:13.720
 What's the difference in nontheism, agnosticism, and atheism?

1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:21.720
 So nontheists think that the theist and the atheist share a bunch of presuppositions.

1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:32.720
 For example, it's that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a personal being that is in some sense the supreme being

1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:38.720
 and that the right relationship to that being is to have a correct set of beliefs.

1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:41.720
 I reject all of those claims.

1:38:41.720 --> 1:38:44.720
 So both the theist and the atheist see God?

1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:45.720
 In their modern version.

1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:46.720
 Yes.

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:47.720
 Yes.

1:38:47.720 --> 1:39:01.720
 In which do you reject it in the sense that you don't know or do you reject it in the sense that you believe that each one of those presuppositions is likely to be not true?

1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:02.720
 The latter.

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:10.720
 Both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and experience.

1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:15.720
 I've come to the conclusion that those shared propositions are probably not true.

1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:18.720
 Which one is the most troublesome to you?

1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:26.720
 The personal being, the kind of accumulation of everything into one being that ultimately created stuff.

1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:28.720
 So for me, there's two and they're interlocked together.

1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:30.720
 I'm not trying to dodge your question.

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:39.720
 It's that the idea that the ground of being is some kind of being, I think, is a fundamental mistake.

1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:41.720
 It's void of being?

1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:44.720
 No, no, no.

1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:46.720
 The ground of being is some kind of being.

1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:47.720
 No, no, no.

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:48.720
 It's hurdles all the way down.

1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:50.720
 The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.

1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:52.720
 Being is not a being.

1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:59.720
 It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being.

1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:01.720
 Are humans beings?

1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:02.720
 We are beings.

1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:03.720
 This glass is a being.

1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:05.720
 This table is a being.

1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:10.720
 But when I ask you, how are they all in being?

1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:15.720
 You don't say by being a glass or by being a table or by being a human.

1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:21.720
 You want to say, no, no, there's something underneath it all and then you realize it can't be anything.

1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:28.720
 This is why many mystical traditions converge on the idea that the ground of being is no thingness.

1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:32.720
 Which is, you know, which is normally pronounced as nothingness.

1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:37.720
 But if you put the hyphen back in, you get the original intent, no thingness.

1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:45.720
 And that is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship with.

1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:52.720
 So it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a supreme being, which is a category mistake to my mind.

1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:58.720
 And then my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief.

1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:07.720
 And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion that meaning is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions.

1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:17.720
 And so that is a misunderstanding of sacredness because I take sacredness to be that which is most meaningful and connected to what is most real.

1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:22.720
 And theists think of what? Of sacredness as what?

1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:39.720
 They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God, and that the way that is meaningful to them is by asserting a set of propositions or beliefs.

1:41:39.720 --> 1:41:45.720
 Now, I want to point out that this is what I would now call modern or common theism.

1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:55.720
 You go back into the classical periods of Christianity, you get a view that's really radically different from how most people understand theism today.

1:41:55.720 --> 1:42:13.720
 Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question that I usually think about in the form of mathematics, but so in that case, if meaning is sacred in your nontheist view, is meaning created or is it discovered?

1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:18.720
 There's a Latin word that doesn't separate them called inventio.

1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:26.720
 And I would say that and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance because you participate in it.

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:32.720
 You've experienced an insight, yes? Did you make it happen?

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:34.720
 The insight.

1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:41.720
 Did you make it happen or did you do, like, can you do that? I need an insight. This is what I do to make an insight.

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:45.720
 Oh, I see. Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere.

1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:51.720
 Right, but you didn't just passively receive it either. You're engaged and involved in it. That's why you get, right?

1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:55.720
 So that's what I mean by you participate in it. You participate in meaning.

1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:57.720
 So you do think that it's both.

1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:58.720
 Yes.

1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:05.720
 You do think it's both. I mean, that's not a trivial thing to understand.

1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:18.720
 Because a lot of time we think when you think about a search for meaning, you think it's like you're going through a big house and you open each door and look if it's there and so on.

1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:23.720
 As if there is going to be a glowing orb that you discover.

1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:39.720
 But at the same time, I'm somebody that based on the chemistry of my brain have been extremely fortunate to be able to discover beauty and everything in the most mundane and boring of things.

1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:44.720
 I am, as David Foster Wallace said, unboreable.

1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:51.720
 I could just sit in a room just like playing with a tennis ball or something and be excited.

1:43:51.720 --> 1:43:55.720
 Basically like a dog, I think, endlessly.

1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:04.720
 So to me, meaning is created because I could create meaning out of everything.

1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:07.720
 But of course, it doesn't require a partner.

1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:11.720
 It does require dance partners, whatever.

1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:13.720
 It does require the tennis ball.

1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:18.720
 But honestly, that's what a lot of people that I don't necessarily, we'll talk about it.

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:26.720
 I don't practice meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like the entire days for months kind of thing.

1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:34.720
 They talk about being able to discover meaning in just the wind or something.

1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:44.720
 The breath and everything, just subtle sensory experiences give you deep fulfillment.

1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:47.720
 So that's again, it's interaction.

1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:56.720
 Actually, I do want to say because the interesting difference that you've drawn between nontheism and atheism,

1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:01.720
 where's the agreement or disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson on this?

1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:06.720
 I just talked to Jordan about this because you're very clear.

1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:10.720
 It's kind of beautiful in the clarity in which you laid this out.

1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:14.720
 I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity.

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:21.720
 Have you been able to draw any kind of lines between the way the two of you see religion?

1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:22.720
 Yeah.

1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:29.720
 So there was a video released, I think, like two or three weeks ago with Jordan and myself and Jonathan Peugeot.

1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:30.720
 Oh, I haven't watched that one yet, yeah.

1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:32.720
 And it's around this question, Lex.

1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:38.720
 He's basically sort of making, he's putting together an argument for God.

1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:40.720
 I mean, I think that's a fair way.

1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:42.720
 I don't think he would object to me saying that.

1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:49.720
 And Jonathan Peugeot is also a, well, Jonathan is a Christian.

1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:51.720
 It's unclear what Jordan is.

1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:56.720
 And Jonathan's work is on symbolism and different mythologies and Christianity.

1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:01.720
 Yeah, especially Neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important.

1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:05.720
 I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a lot of respect for Jonathan.

1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:13.720
 But in my participation in that dialogue, you can see me, well, repeatedly.

1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:20.720
 But I think everybody, including Jordan, thought constructively challenging sort of the attempt to build a theistic model.

1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:23.720
 And I was challenging it from a nontheistic perspective.

1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:31.720
 So I think we don't agree on certain sets of propositions.

1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:36.720
 But there was a lot of, there was also a lot of acknowledgement.

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:42.720
 And I think genuine appreciation on his part and Jonathan's part of the arguments I was making.

1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:48.720
 So they believe in maybe the presupposition of like a supreme being.

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:57.720
 Not believe, but not believe, but they see the power of that particular presupposition in being a source of meaning.

1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:00.720
 I think that's relatively clear from you with Jordan.

1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:07.720
 Jordan's a really complex guy, so it's very hard to just like pin to my best sort of understanding.

1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:11.720
 Yes, I think that's clearly the case for Jordan.

1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:13.720
 It's not the case for Jonathan.

1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:17.720
 Jonathan is, remember I said, I was talking about modern atheism and theism.

1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:27.720
 Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon carving and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern Orthodoxy

1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:34.720
 and has come out of it the other end as a fifth century church father that is nevertheless being rightfully so,

1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:38.720
 found to be increasingly relevant to many people.

1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:40.720
 So he's deeply old school.

1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:47.720
 Yeah, I think he has, he and I, especially because Neoplatonism is a nontheistic philosophical spirituality

1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:49.720
 and it's a big part of Eastern Orthodoxy.

1:47:49.720 --> 1:47:55.720
 He and I, I think he would say things like God doesn't exist.

1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.720
 You're a Christian, right?

1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:03.720
 And he's being coy, but he'll say, well, God doesn't exist the way the cup exists or the table exists.

1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:05.720
 The same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago.

1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:07.720
 He'll say things like that.

1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:13.720
 He will emphasize the no thingness of ultimate reality, the no thingness of God,

1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:21.720
 because he's from that version of Christianity, what you might call classical theism.

1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:26.720
 The classical theism looks a lot more like nontheism than it looks like modern theism.

1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:28.720
 That's so interesting.

1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:30.720
 Yeah, that's really interesting.

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:41.720
 What about, is there a line to be drawn between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness in man's search for meaning?

1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:47.720
 So here's where Jordan and I are much more, actually all three of us are in significant agreement.

1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:51.720
 I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here.

1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:57.720
 Myths aren't stories about things that happened in the deep past that are largely irrelevant.

1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:05.720
 Myths are stories about perennial or pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness.

1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:11.720
 And they need to be brought into an awareness not just or primarily at the propositional level,

1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:13.720
 but at those non propositional levels.

1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:16.720
 And I think that is what good mythos does.

1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:25.720
 I prefer to use the Greek word because we've now turned the English word into a synonym for a widely believed falsehood.

1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:32.720
 And I don't think, again, if you go back even to the church fathers, I'm not a Christian, I'm not advocating for Christianity,

1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:36.720
 but neither am I here to attack it.

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:45.720
 But when they talk about reading these stories, they think the literal interpretation is the weakest

1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:46.720
 and the least important.

1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:53.720
 You move to the allegorical or the symbolic, to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical.

1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:55.720
 And that's where, right?

1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:04.720
 So they would say to you, oh, you know, but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you now?

1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:11.720
 And I don't mean true for you in that relativistic sense, I mean, how is it pointing to a pattern in your life right now?

1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:23.720
 So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos becomes real in connecting to the patterns that kind of captivate the public today.

1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:26.720
 So you just keep telling the story.

1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:34.720
 I mean, there's something about some of these stories that are just really good at being sticky to the patterns of each generation.

1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:37.720
 And they'll stick to different patterns throughout time.

1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:40.720
 They're just sticky in powerful ways.

1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:41.720
 Yes.

1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:45.720
 And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again.

1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:54.720
 And it's important to see that some of these stories are recursive.

1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:58.720
 They're myths about one particular set of patterns.

1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:03.720
 They're myths about not just the important pattern.

1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:15.720
 Like you get the, you know, Jordan stuff about there's heroes and myths are trying to make us understand the need for being heroic in our own lives.

1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:21.720
 One of the things I'd like to put in counterbalance that is the Greek also have myths of hubris, right?

1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:24.720
 The counterbalance, the heroic, right?

1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:36.720
 But then there are myths that are not about those deeply important patterns, but they're myths about religio itself.

1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:42.720
 That the way we're, religio means to bind, to connect, the way relevance realization connects us.

1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:46.720
 And so the point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that pattern and notice that pattern.

1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:56.720
 It's notice how all of these patterns are emerging and what does that say about us and reality?

1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:03.720
 And those myths, those myths, I think are genuinely profound.

1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:09.720
 And how much of the myths, how much of the power of those myths is about the dialogues?

1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:11.720
 You talk about this quite a bit.

1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:16.720
 I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys, I'm not sure you've gotten really into it.

1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:23.720
 You, you, you scratch the surface a little bit, but the role of, as you say, dialogue in distributed cognition.

1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:24.720
 Yes.

1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:25.720
 What is that?

1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:28.720
 The thing we're doing right now talking with our mouth holes.

1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:30.720
 What is that?

1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:32.720
 And actually, can I ask you this question?

1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:33.720
 Yep.

1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:46.720
 If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans, would they notice our distributed cognition first or our individual cognition first?

1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:49.720
 What is the most notable thing about us humans?

1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:53.720
 Is it our ability to individually do well in IQ tests or whatever?

1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:54.720
 Yeah.

1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:56.720
 Or puzzle solve?

1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:58.720
 Or is it this thing we're doing together?

1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:02.720
 I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition.

1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:05.720
 Like, look around.

1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:07.720
 You didn't make this equipment.

1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:08.720
 You didn't build this place.

1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:11.720
 You didn't invent this language that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera.

1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:18.720
 And now there's, there's more specific and precise experimental evidence coming out.

1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:23.720
 Let's take a standard task that people, reasoning tasks.

1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:24.720
 I wanted to do the details.

1:53:24.720 --> 1:53:26.720
 It's called the Waste and Selection Task.

1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:33.720
 And you give it to people, highly educated psychology students, premier universities across the world.

1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:35.720
 You've been, we've been doing it since the 60s.

1:53:35.720 --> 1:53:42.720
 It's replicates and replicates and only 10% of the people get it right.

1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:47.720
 You put them in a group of four and you allow them to talk to each other.

1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:49.720
 The success rate goes to 80%.

1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:54.720
 That's just one example of a phenomenon that's coming to the fore.

1:53:54.720 --> 1:54:00.720
 By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of engineering students for psychology students?

1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:03.720
 Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two?

1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:05.720
 Just kidding.

1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:07.720
 That's, let's move on.

1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:08.720
 All right.

1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:12.720
 So there is a lot of evidence that there's power to this distributed cognition.

1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:17.720
 Now, what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism of the ants interacting with each other?

1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:18.720
 The dialogue.

1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:23.720
 I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation.

1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:32.720
 But, and this is deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato, especially the platonic dialogues.

1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:34.720
 And I'm sure we've all had this.

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:37.720
 And so give me a moment because I want to build onto something here.

1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:48.720
 We've participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us both in directions we did not anticipate, afforded us insights that we could not have had on our own.

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:54.720
 And we don't have to have come to an agreement, but we were both moved and we both drawn into insight.

1:54:54.720 --> 1:55:16.720
 And we feel like, wow, that was one of the best moments of my life because we feel how that introduced us to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed cognition that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person and potentially with the world.

1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:18.720
 That's what I mean by the logos.

1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:26.720
 And so for me, I think the logos is more important.

1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:31.720
 Boy, I could just hear, I'm sorry, I can hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head right now.

1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:32.720
 But I think it's more.

1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:34.720
 I hear them all the time.

1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:38.720
 I just wish they would shut up in my head sometimes.

1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:41.720
 So what are they saying to you in your head?

1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:45.720
 What they're saying, well, see, that's what the most recent conversation was about.

1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:54.720
 I was trying to say that I don't think mythos is, I think mythos is really important.

1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:58.720
 I think these kinds of narratives are really important.

1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:11.720
 But I think this ability to connect together in distributed cognition, collective intelligence and cultivate a shared flow state within that collective intelligence.

1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:14.720
 So it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective wisdom.

1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:24.720
 I think that's more important because I think that's the basin within which the myths and the rituals are ultimately created and when they function.

1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:27.720
 Like a myth is like a public dream.

1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:35.720
 It depends on distributed cognition and it depends on people enacting it and getting into mutual flow states.

1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:46.720
 So the highest form of dialogue of conversation is this flow state and that it forms the foundation for myth building.

1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:47.720
 I think so.

1:56:47.720 --> 1:56:48.720
 I think so.

1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:54.720
 So that communitas, that's Victor Turner's phrase and he specifically linked it to flow and I study flow scientifically.

1:56:54.720 --> 1:57:05.720
 That within distributed cognition as the home, as the generator of mythos and ritual and those are bound together as well.

1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:07.720
 I think that's fundamentally correct.

1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:09.720
 You know what's the cool thing here?

1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:19.720
 Because I'm a huge fan of podcasts and audiobooks, but podcasts in particular is relevant here is there's a third person in this room listening now.

1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:22.720
 And they're also in the flow state.

1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:24.720
 Yes, yes.

1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:27.720
 Like I'm close friends with a lot of podcasts.

1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:29.720
 They don't know I exist.

1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:32.720
 I just listened to them because I've been in so many flow states with them.

1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:35.720
 I was like, yes, yes, this is good.

1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:39.720
 But they don't know I exist, but they are in conversation with me ultimately.

1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:42.720
 And think of what that's doing.

1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:46.720
 You've got dialogues and then you've got this meta dialogue like you're describing.

1:57:46.720 --> 1:57:57.720
 And think about how things like podcasts and YouTube, they break down old boundaries between the private and the public between writing and oral speech.

1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:03.720
 So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency of writing.

1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:17.720
 Like we're in the midst of creating a vehicle and a medium for distributed cognition that breaks down a lot of the categories by which we organized our cognition.

1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:26.720
 I mean, because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the network, the graph of how quickly the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful.

1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:34.720
 You just a huge amount of people have listened to your lectures. I've listened to your lectures, but I've experienced them at least in your style.

1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:39.720
 There's something about your style. It felt like a conversation.

1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:43.720
 It felt like at any point moment I could interrupt you and say something.

1:58:43.720 --> 1:58:45.720
 And I was just listening.

1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:53.720
 Thank you for saying that because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can when I'm doing this.

1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:57.720
 Yeah, there was that sense actually as I'm saying it now. Why was that?

1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:05.720
 It didn't feel like sometimes lectures are kind of, you know, you came, you come down with the commandments and you just want to listen.

1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:09.720
 But there was a sense like, I mean, I think it was the excitement that you have, like you have to understand.

1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:15.720
 And also the fact that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the top of your head sometimes.

1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:22.720
 There was a, you were interrupting yourself with thoughts, you're playing with thoughts, like you're reasoning through things often.

1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:30.720
 Like you had, you referenced a lot of books, so surely you were extremely well prepared and you were referencing a lot of ideas,

1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:33.720
 but then you were also struggling in the way to present those ideas.

1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:43.720
 Yes. And so the jazz, like the jazz and getting into the flow state and trying to share in a participatory and

1:59:43.720 --> 1:59:49.720
 perspective of fashion the learning with the people rather than just pronouncing at them. Yes.

1:59:49.720 --> 1:59:54.720
 What's mindfulness? So published on that as well.

1:59:54.720 --> 2:00:00.720
 And I practice, I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness and ecology of practices since 1991.

2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:05.720
 So I both have practitioners knowledge and I also study it scientifically.

2:00:05.720 --> 2:00:15.720
 I think I'm pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about mindfulness at the University of Toronto within a classroom setting, like lecturing on it.

2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:21.720
 So this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in, think about.

2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:26.720
 So from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is?

2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:35.720
 I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions being aware of the present moment without judgment because I think they're flawed.

2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:41.720
 And if you want to get into the detail of why we can, but this is how I want to explain it to you.

2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:46.720
 And it also points to the fact of why you need an ecology of mindfulness practices.

2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:50.720
 You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation. I think that's a primary mistake.

2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:55.720
 When you say ecology, what do you mean by the way? So lots of many different variants?

2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:58.720
 No, so what I mean by an ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology.

2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:02.720
 You have a dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each other.

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:05.720
 And I'll get to that with this about mindfulness.

2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:07.720
 So I'll make that connection if you allow me.

2:01:07.720 --> 2:01:11.720
 So we're always framing. We've been talking about that, right?

2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:21.720
 And for those of you who are not on YouTube, this podcast, I wear glasses and I'm now sort of putting my fingers and thumb around the frames of my glasses.

2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:32.720
 So this is my frame and my lenses, right? And that frame, the frame holds a lens and I'm seeing through it in both senses, beyond and by means of it.

2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:39.720
 So right now, my glasses are transparent to me. I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing.

2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:43.720
 Now, this is what you do in meditation, I would argue.

2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:48.720
 You step back from looking through your frame and you look at it.

2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:51.720
 I'm taking my glasses off right now and I'm looking at them.

2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:58.720
 Why might I do that? To see if there's something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to...

2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:07.720
 Now, if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I've actually corrected the change I made to my lenses?

2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:15.720
 What do I need to do? I need to put my glasses on and see if I can now see more clearly and deeply than I could before.

2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:19.720
 Meditation is this, stepping back and looking at.

2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:25.720
 Contemplation is that looking through and there are different kinds of practices.

2:02:25.720 --> 2:02:28.720
 The fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake.

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:33.720
 The word contemplation has temple in it in Latin. Contemplario means to look up to the sky.

2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:38.720
 It's a translation of the Greek word theoria, which we get our word theory from.

2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:40.720
 It's to look deeply into things.

2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:47.720
 Meditation is more about having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and looking at.

2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:49.720
 Mindfulness includes both.

2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:54.720
 It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame.

2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:58.720
 And the ability to make a new frame.

2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:00.720
 That's what actually happens in insight.

2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:07.720
 You have to both break an inappropriate frame and make see, realize a new frame.

2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:09.720
 This is why mindfulness enhances insight.

2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:15.720
 Both ways, by the way, meditative practices and also contemplative practices.

2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:27.720
 So mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your capacities for insight and self regulation.

2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:35.720
 Now, I am inexperienced with meditation, sort of the practice, the rigorous practice and the science of meditation.

2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:49.720
 But, you know, I've talked to people who seriously as a science studies psychedelics and they often talk about the really important thing is the sort of the integration back.

2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:51.720
 So the contemplation step.

2:03:51.720 --> 2:04:05.720
 So if you, it's not just the actual things you see on psychedelics or the actual journey of where your mind goes on psychedelics, it's also the integrating that into the new perspective that you take on life.

2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:06.720
 Exactly.

2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:22.720
 And you really nicely described, so meditation is the, in that metaphors is the psychedelic journey to a different mind state and then contemplation is the return back to reality, how you integrate that into a new world view and mindfulness is the whole process.

2:04:22.720 --> 2:04:23.720
 Right.

2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:30.720
 So if you, if you, if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from inflation and projective fantasy.

2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:36.720
 If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual bypassing, avoiding reality.

2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:38.720
 They act, they need, they need each other.

2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:40.720
 You have to cycle between them.

2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:48.720
 It's like what I talked about earlier, when I talked about the opponent processing within the autonomic nervous system or the opponent processing at work and attention.

2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:52.720
 And that's what I mean by an ecology of practices.

2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:53.720
 You need both.

2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:55.720
 Neither one is a panacea.

2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:59.720
 You need them in this opponent processing acting as checks and balance on each other.

2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:08.720
 Is there sort of practical advice you can give to people on how to meditate or how to be mindful in this full way?

2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:09.720
 Yes.

2:05:09.720 --> 2:05:12.720
 I would tell them to do at least three things.

2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:15.720
 And I was, I, I, I lucked into this.

2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:25.720
 When I started meditation, I went down the street and there was a place that taught the Pasna meditation, metacontemplation and Tai Chi Chuan for flow induction.

2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:29.720
 And you should get, you should have a meditative practice.

2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:40.720
 You should find a contemplative practice and you should find a moving mindfulness practice, especially one that is conducive to the flow state and practice them in an integrated fashion.

2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:44.720
 Can you elaborate what those practices might look like?

2:05:44.720 --> 2:05:45.720
 Right.

2:05:45.720 --> 2:05:47.720
 Generally speaking.

2:05:47.720 --> 2:05:50.720
 Meditative practice like the Pasna.

2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:56.720
 And so what, what, what's the primary thing I look through rather than look at?

2:05:56.720 --> 2:05:57.720
 It's my sensations.

2:05:57.720 --> 2:06:03.720
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my sensations rather than focusing on the world through my sensations.

2:06:03.720 --> 2:06:12.720
 So I'm going to follow, for example, the sensations in this area of my, my abdomen where my breathing is.

2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:20.720
 So I can feel as my abdomen is expanding, I can feel those sensations and then I can feel the sensations as it's contracting.

2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:28.720
 Now what will happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at the world again.

2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:29.720
 Right.

2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:31.720
 I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry or what was that noise?

2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:33.720
 And so what do I do?

2:06:33.720 --> 2:06:35.720
 I don't get involved with the content.

2:06:35.720 --> 2:06:45.720
 I step back and label the process with an ING word, listening, imagining, planning, and then I return my attention to the breath.

2:06:45.720 --> 2:06:48.720
 And I have to return my attention in the correct way.

2:06:48.720 --> 2:06:52.720
 The part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist tradition, this is called your monkey mind.

2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:54.720
 It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering.

2:06:54.720 --> 2:06:55.720
 Right.

2:06:55.720 --> 2:07:04.720
 If I was trying to train that, that monkey mind to stay or as Jack Hornfield say, train a puppy dog, you know, stay puppy dog.

2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:12.720
 And if it goes and I get really angry, and I bring it back and I'm yelling at it, I'm going to train it to fight and fear me.

2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:18.720
 But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its whims, oh, look, the puppy dog went there.

2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:19.720
 Oh, now it's there.

2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:21.720
 The puppy dog never learns to stay.

2:07:21.720 --> 2:07:22.720
 What do I need to do?

2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:25.720
 I have to neither fight it nor feed it.

2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:26.720
 I have to have this centered attitude.

2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:28.720
 I have to befriend it.

2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:36.720
 So you step back and look at your sensations, you step back and look at your distracting processes.

2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:40.720
 You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the right attitude.

2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:43.720
 That's the core of a good meditative practice.

2:07:43.720 --> 2:07:44.720
 Okay.

2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:46.720
 Then what's a good contemplative practice?

2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:59.720
 A good contemplative practice is to try and meta, it's actually apropos because we talked about that participatory knowing the way you're situated in the world.

2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:09.720
 So what, this is a long thing because there's different interpretations of meta and I go for what's called an existential interpretation over an emotional one.

2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:17.720
 But so what I'm doing in meta, right, is I'm trying to become, I'm trying to awaken in two ways.

2:08:17.720 --> 2:08:24.720
 I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an identity and assigning an identity.

2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:27.720
 So I'm looking at that.

2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:29.720
 I'm trying to awaken to that.

2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:35.720
 And then I'm trying to awake from the modal confusion that I can get into around that.

2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:47.720
 So I'm looking out onto the world and I'm trying to see you in a fundamentally different way than I have before.

2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:50.720
 You know, like you go to the gym and you do bicep curls.

2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:51.720
 Yes.

2:08:51.720 --> 2:08:52.720
 Yes.

2:08:52.720 --> 2:09:00.720
 Is it possible to reduce it to those things that, I mean, you don't need to speak to the specifics, but is there actual practice you can do or is it really personal?

2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:02.720
 No, I teach people how to do the meta practice.

2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:06.720
 I also teach them how to do a neoplatonic contemplated practice, how to do a stoic one.

2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:09.720
 Another one you can do is the view from above.

2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:10.720
 This is classic stoicism.

2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:21.720
 I get you to imagine that you're in this room and then imagine that you're floating above the room, then above Austin, then above Texas, then above the United States, then the earth.

2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:23.720
 And you have to really imagine it.

2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:25.720
 Don't just think it, but really imagine.

2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:36.720
 And then what you notice is as you're pulling out to a wider and wider, like contemplation of reality, your sense of self and what you find relevant and important also changes.

2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:40.720
 No, for all of these, there is a specific step by step methodology.

2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:45.720
 So like in that one, you could just literally imagine yourself floating farther and farther out.

2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:46.720
 But you have to go through the steps.

2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:47.720
 Yeah.

2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:49.720
 Because the stepping matters.

2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:51.720
 Because if you just jump, it doesn't work.

2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:54.720
 Do you have any of the stuff online, by the way?

2:09:54.720 --> 2:09:55.720
 I do.

2:09:55.720 --> 2:10:03.720
 Because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a daily course.

2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:05.720
 I taught meditating with John Rovaki.

2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:09.720
 I did all the way through meditation, contemplation, even some of the movement practices.

2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:10.720
 That's all there.

2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:11.720
 It's all available.

2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:14.720
 That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism.

2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:20.720
 And then I went into the Western tradition and went through things like stoicism and neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Rovaki.

2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:22.720
 That's all there.

2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:23.720
 All free.

2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:24.720
 On your website.

2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:25.720
 Yeah.

2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:26.720
 It's on my YouTube channel.

2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:27.720
 On your YouTube channel?

2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:28.720
 Okay.

2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:29.720
 That's exciting.

2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:33.720
 I mean, your meaning crisis lectures are just incredible.

2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:37.720
 Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people talk.

2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:44.720
 It created this tree of conversations that's really, really, really well done.

2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:46.720
 What about flow induction?

2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:48.720
 You want to flow wisely.

2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:56.720
 And first of all, you need to understand what flow is, and then you need to confront a particular issue, a practical problem around flow.

2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:01.720
 Let's go there because a lot of those words seem like synonyms to people sometimes.

2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:04.720
 So the state of flow.

2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:06.720
 What is it?

2:11:06.720 --> 2:11:07.720
 All right.

2:11:07.720 --> 2:11:10.720
 So, and he just died last year.

2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:12.720
 I admire him very much.

2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:20.720
 We've exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years, and he wanted to do the podcast several times.

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.720
 That would have been wonderful.

2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:26.720
 But he said he struggled with his health.

2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:41.720
 I never knew in those situations, I deeply regret several cases like this that I had with Conway, that I should have pushed him on it.

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:48.720
 Because, yeah, as you get later in life, things, the simple things become more difficult.

2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:53.720
 But a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard, is important to hear.

2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:56.720
 So anyway, I apologize.

2:11:56.720 --> 2:11:58.720
 No, no, I share that.

2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:06.720
 I mean, I can tell you that within my area, he is important, and he's famous in an academic sense.

2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:15.720
 So the flow state, two important sets of conditions, and very often people only talk about one, and that's a little bit of a misrepresentation.

2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:24.720
 So the flow state is in situations in which the demand of the situation is slightly beyond your skills.

2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:32.720
 So you both have to apply all the skills you can with as much sort of attention and concentration as you possibly can.

2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:36.720
 And you have to actually be stretching your skills.

2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:46.720
 Now, in this circumstance, people report optimal experience, optimal in two ways, optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I've had in my life.

2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:53.720
 It's distinct from pleasure, and yet it explains why people do very bizarre things like rock climbing because it's a good flow induction.

2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:57.720
 But they also mean optimal in a second sense, my best performance.

2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:02.720
 So it's both the best experience and the best performance.

2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:11.720
 So Chicksat Mahai also talked about the information flow conditions you need, right, in order for there to be this state of flow.

2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:13.720
 And then I'll talk about what it's like to be in flow in a sec.

2:13:13.720 --> 2:13:15.720
 What you need is three things.

2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:17.720
 You need the information that you're getting to be clear.

2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:19.720
 It can't be ambiguous or vague.

2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:21.720
 Think about a rock climber.

2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:22.720
 It's ambiguous and vague.

2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:25.720
 Oh, you're in trouble, right?

2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:30.720
 There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the environment responds.

2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:33.720
 So when you act, there's an immediate response.

2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:40.720
 There isn't a big time lag between your action and your ability to detect the response from the environment.

2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:42.720
 Third, failure has to matter.

2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:44.720
 Error really matters.

2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:47.720
 So there should be some anxiety about failure.

2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:49.720
 And failure matters.

2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:52.720
 Like to you, the person that presents it.

2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:54.720
 Yes, yes, yes.

2:13:54.720 --> 2:14:02.720
 Now, when you're in the flow state, notice how this sits on the boundary between the secular and the sacred.

2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:10.720
 When you're in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of at one mint with the environment.

2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:15.720
 They report a loss of a particular kind of self consciousness, that narrative,

2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:24.720
 noturing nanny in your head that, how do I look? Do people like me? How do I look? How's my hair? Do people like me? Should I have said that? That all goes away.

2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:26.720
 You're free from that.

2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:31.720
 You're free from the most sadistic, super ego self critic you could possibly have, at least for a while.

2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:33.720
 The world is vivid.

2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:35.720
 It's super salient to you.

2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:38.720
 There's an ongoing sense of discovery.

2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:46.720
 Although often you know you're exerting a lot of metabolical effort, it feels effortless.

2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:55.720
 So in the flow state, when you're sparring, your hand just goes up for the block and your strike just goes through the empty space.

2:14:55.720 --> 2:14:59.720
 Or if you're a goalie and hockey, I've got to mention hockey once I'm a Canadian.

2:14:59.720 --> 2:15:04.720
 You put out your glove hand and the pucks there.

2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:17.720
 So there's this tremendous sense of grace, atonement, super salience, discovery and realness.

2:15:17.720 --> 2:15:22.720
 People don't, well, people don't, when they're in the flow state, they don't go, I bet this is an illusion.

2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:38.720
 The interesting questions for me and my coauthors in the book, in the article we published in the Hanford, the Oxford Handbook, Spontaneous Thought with Aryan, Haribana and Leo Ferraro, is that's a descriptive account of flow.

2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:40.720
 We wanted an explanatory account.

2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:43.720
 One of the causal mechanisms at work in flow.

2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:50.720
 And so we actually proposed two interlocking cognitive processes.

2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:54.720
 The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow?

2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:56.720
 Well, think about it.

2:15:56.720 --> 2:15:58.720
 Think about the rock climber.

2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:05.720
 The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier, they're constantly restructuring how they're seeing the rock face.

2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:08.720
 They're constantly doing something like insight.

2:16:08.720 --> 2:16:13.720
 And if they fail to do it, they impasse and that starts to get dangerous.

2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:16.720
 So they got to do it in insight that primes in insight that primes in insight.

2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:25.720
 So imagine the aha experience, that flash and that moment and imagine it cascading so you're getting the extended aha.

2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:27.720
 That's why things are super salient.

2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:29.720
 There's a sense of discovery.

2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:33.720
 There's a sense of at one minute of deep participation of grace.

2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:36.720
 But there's something else going on too.

2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:39.720
 So there's a phenomena called implicit learning.

2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:41.720
 Also very well replicated.

2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:44.720
 Starts way back in the 60s with Reber.

2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:50.720
 You can give people complex patterns like number and letter strings, right?

2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:58.720
 And they can learn about those patterns outside of deliberate focal awareness.

2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:00.720
 That's what's called implicit learning.

2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:10.720
 And what's interesting is if you try and change that task into, you know, tell me the pattern, but explicitly try to figure it out.

2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:12.720
 The performance degrades.

2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:14.720
 So here's the idea.

2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:17.720
 You have this adaptive capacity for implicit learning.

2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:23.720
 And what it does is it results in you being able to track complex variables in a way.

2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:26.720
 But you don't know how you came up with that knowledge, right?

2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:30.720
 So you get, and this is Hogarth's proposal in educating intuition.

2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:32.720
 Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning.

2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:40.720
 So an example I use is how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral?

2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:42.720
 There's a lot of complex variables.

2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:49.720
 There's status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history, all kinds of stuff.

2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:51.720
 And yet you know how to do it.

2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:54.720
 And you didn't have to go to funeral school.

2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:56.720
 I'm just using that as an example.

2:17:56.720 --> 2:17:58.720
 So you have these powerful intuitions.

2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:01.720
 Now here's Hogarth's great point.

2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:07.720
 Implicit learning, and remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive make us subject to self deception.

2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:08.720
 Here's another example.

2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:15.720
 Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on complex patterns, but it doesn't care what kind of pattern it is.

2:18:15.720 --> 2:18:21.720
 It doesn't distinguish causal patterns from merely correlational patterns.

2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:23.720
 So when we like it, it's intuition.

2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:30.720
 When it's picking up on stuff that's bogus, we call it prejudice, or all kinds of other names for intuition that's going wrong.

2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:32.720
 Now, he said, okay, what do we do?

2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:33.720
 What do we do about this?

2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:35.720
 And this will get back to flow.

2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:36.720
 What do we do about this?

2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:42.720
 Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning with explicit learning because we'll lose all the adaptiveness to it.

2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:43.720
 So what can we do explicitly?

2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:49.720
 What we can do is take care of the environment in which we're doing the implicit learning.

2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:50.720
 How do we do that?

2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:57.720
 We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish causation from correlation.

2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:02.720
 What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing causation from correlation?

2:19:02.720 --> 2:19:04.720
 Experimental environments.

2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:06.720
 What do you do in an experiment?

2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:09.720
 You make sure that the variables are clear.

2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:11.720
 No confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness.

2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:18.720
 You make sure there's a tight coupling between the independent and the dependent variable, and your hypothesis can be falsified.

2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:19.720
 Error matters.

2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:20.720
 Now look at those three legs.

2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.720
 Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for flow.

2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:30.720
 Clear information, tightly coupled feedback, and error matters.

2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:36.720
 So, flow is not only an insight cascade improving your insight capacity.

2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:48.720
 It's also a marker that you're cultivating the best kind of intuitions, the ones that fit you best to the causal patterns in your environment.

2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:59.720
 But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment where there's a clear distinction between causality and correlation, and it has the rigor of a scientific...

2:19:59.720 --> 2:20:01.720
 Fair enough.

2:20:01.720 --> 2:20:07.720
 And I don't think Hogarth was saying it's going to be epistemically as rigorous as a scientific experiment.

2:20:07.720 --> 2:20:16.720
 But he's saying, if you structure that, it will tend to do what that scientific method does, which is, think of the rock climber.

2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:18.720
 All of those things are the case.

2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:19.720
 They need clear information.

2:20:19.720 --> 2:20:22.720
 It's tightly coupled, and error matters.

2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:36.720
 And they think what they're doing is very real because if they're not conforming to the real causal patterns of the rock face and the physiology of their body, they will fall.

2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:47.720
 Is there something to be said about the power of discovering meaning and having this deep relationship with the moment?

2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:55.720
 Is there something about flow that really forgets the past and the future and is really focused on the moment?

2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:57.720
 I think that's part of the phenomenology.

2:20:57.720 --> 2:21:11.720
 But I think the functionality has to do with the fact that what's happening in flow is that dynamic, non propositional connectedness that is so central to meaning is being optimized.

2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:25.720
 This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life, how much well being you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive and interrelated with how meaningful you find your life.

2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:35.720
 One of the things that you can do, but there's an important caveat, to increase your sense of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently.

2:21:35.720 --> 2:21:39.720
 That's why I said you want a moving practice that's conducive to the flow state.

2:21:39.720 --> 2:21:53.720
 But there's one important caveat, which is we of course have figured out and I'm playing with words here how to game this and how to hijack it by creating things like video games.

2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:58.720
 I'm not saying this is the case for all video games or this is the case for all people.

2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:13.720
 But the WHO now acknowledges this as a real thing that you can get into the flow state within the video game world to the detriment of your ability to get into the flow state in the real world.

2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:15.720
 What's the opposite of flow?

2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:16.720
 Depression.

2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:20.720
 In fact, depression has been called anti flow.

2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:31.720
 So you get these people that are flowing in this non real world and they can't transfer it to the real world and it's actually costing them flow in the real world.

2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:35.720
 So they tend to suffer depression and all kinds of things.

2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:53.720
 Your ability, your habit and just skill at attaining flow in the video game world basically makes you less effective or maybe shocks you at how difficult it is to achieve flow in the physical world.

2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:55.720
 Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

2:22:55.720 --> 2:23:08.720
 I don't want to push back against the implied challenge of transferability because I have a lot of friends that play video games.

2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:20.720
 A very large percent of young folks play video games and I'm hesitant to build up models of how that affects behavior.

2:23:20.720 --> 2:23:31.720
 My intuition is weak there. Oftentimes, people that have PhDs over a certain age that they came up when video games weren't a deep part of their life development.

2:23:31.720 --> 2:23:47.720
 I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games being a large part of that world are in some sense different humans and it's possible that they can transfer more effectively.

2:23:47.720 --> 2:23:55.720
 There are lessons, some of the ability to attain flow from the virtual world to the physical world.

2:23:55.720 --> 2:24:12.720
 There are also more, I would venture to say, resilient to the negative effects of, for example, social media or video games that have maybe the objectification or the over sexualized or violent aspect of video games.

2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:22.720
 It's possible to turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on when they're playing the video games probably more effectively than the old timers.

2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:29.720
 I just want to say that I'm not sure, it's a really interesting question, how transferable the flow state is.

2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:31.720
 I don't know if you want to comment on that.

2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:36.720
 I do. First of all, I did qualify and I'm saying it's not the case for all video games or for all people.

2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:47.720
 I'm holding out the possibility and I know this possibility because I've had students who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me.

2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:49.720
 The ability to achieve.

2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:53.720
 They couldn't transfer, yeah.

2:24:53.720 --> 2:25:01.720
 And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science and write about it and work on it.

2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:10.720
 Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim because there seems to be mounting evidence.

2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:24.720
 It's not consensus, but it's certainly not regarded as fringe that the increase in social media is pretty strongly correlated with increase in depression, self destructive behavior, things like this.

2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:26.720
 I would like to see that evidence.

2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:32.720
 No, no, no, no, let me.

2:25:32.720 --> 2:25:44.720
 I'm always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree with things that I want to agree with that there's a public perception.

2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:46.720
 Everyone seems to hate on social media.

2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:55.720
 I wonder, as always with these things, does it reveal depression or does it create depression?

2:25:55.720 --> 2:25:57.720
 This is always the question.

2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:05.720
 It's like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create hate or does it reveal hate?

2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:10.720
 And that's a good thing to ask and you should always challenge the things that you intuitively want to believe.

2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:12.720
 I agree with that.

2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:14.720
 Like aliens.

2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:28.720
 So one of the ways you address this, and it's not sufficient, and I did say the work is preliminary, but if I can give you a plausible mechanism that's new and then that lends credence.

2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.720
 And part of what happens is illusory social comparison.

2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:34.720
 Think of Instagram.

2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:39.720
 People are posting things that are not accurate representation of their life or life events.

2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:51.720
 In fact, they will stage things, but the people that are looking at these, they take it often as real and so they get downward social comparison.

2:26:51.720 --> 2:26:59.720
 And this is like compared to how you and I probably live where we may get one or two of those events a week.

2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:02.720
 They're getting them moment by moment.

2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:07.720
 And so it's a plausible mechanism that why it might be driving people into a more depressed state.

2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:19.720
 So the flip side of that is because there's a greater, greater gap going from real world to Instagram world, you start to be able to laugh at it and realize that it's artificial.

2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:30.720
 So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize like it's the same kind of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world.

2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:37.720
 In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things, grant that thought or you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want.

2:27:37.720 --> 2:27:45.720
 In the real world, you can't and you start to develop an understanding of how to have fun in the virtual world and in the physical world.

2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:47.720
 And I think it's just a pushback.

2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:49.720
 I'm not saying either is true though.

2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:50.720
 Those are very interesting claims.

2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:59.720
 The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram becomes the easier you can laugh it off potentially in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.

2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:06.720
 I'll respond to that, but at some point we should get back to flow as we engage in flow.

2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:14.720
 You laugh at the shampoo commercial and you buy the shampoo.

2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:15.720
 Yeah.

2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:28.720
 There's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines are designed to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking.

2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:41.720
 I'm thinking of common examples because sometimes you can laugh all the way to the bank.

2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:44.720
 So you can laugh and not buy the shampoo.

2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:45.720
 Right.

2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:46.720
 There's many cases.

2:28:46.720 --> 2:28:48.720
 So I think you have to laugh hard enough.

2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:50.720
 You do have to laugh hard enough.

2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:59.720
 The advertisers get millions of dollars precisely because for many, many people it does make you buy the shampoo and that's the concern.

2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:04.720
 And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.

2:29:04.720 --> 2:29:05.720
 Yes.

2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:17.720
 The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately right, the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing.

2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:22.720
 And I want to contrast that to an experience I had when I was in grad school.

2:29:22.720 --> 2:29:30.720
 I'd been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years very religiously in both senses of the word, like three or four hours a day and like reading all the literature.

2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:36.720
 And I was having all the weird experiences, you know, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that stuff.

2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:44.720
 But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what's going on?

2:29:44.720 --> 2:29:45.720
 You're different.

2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:47.720
 And I said, what do you mean?

2:29:47.720 --> 2:29:57.720
 And they said, well, you're a lot more balanced in your interactions and you're a lot more flowing and you're a lot more sort of flexible and you adjust more.

2:29:57.720 --> 2:30:09.720
 And I realized, oh, you know, and this was this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan that it actually transfers in ways that you might not expect.

2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:12.720
 You start to be able and I've now noticed that.

2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:19.720
 I now notice how how I'm doing Tai Chi, even in this interaction and how it can facilitate and afford.

2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:21.720
 And so there's a powerful transfer.

2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:41.720
 And that's what I meant by, you know, flow wisely, not only flow in a way that's right, making sure that your distinguishing causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate it, home it so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains of your life.

2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:53.720
 Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind?

2:30:53.720 --> 2:31:03.720
 Where does it, where does the mind go when it's on psychedelics?

2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:15.720
 I want to remind you of something you said, which is a gem. It's not so much the experience, but the degree to which it can be integrated back.

2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:17.720
 So here's a proposal.

2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:19.720
 It comes from Woodward and others.

2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:20.720
 A lot of converts.

2:31:20.720 --> 2:31:21.720
 It's around this card.

2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:26.720
 Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain, but I'm not going to talk first about psychedelics.

2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:31.720
 I'm going to talk about neural networks and I'm going to talk about a classic problem in neural networks.

2:31:31.720 --> 2:31:38.720
 So neural networks like us with intuition and implicit learning are fantastic at picking up on complex patterns.

2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:40.720
 Which neural networks are we talking about?

2:31:40.720 --> 2:31:43.720
 I'm talking about a general, just general part.

2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:44.720
 Both artificial and biological?

2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:46.720
 Yes, yes, yes.

2:31:46.720 --> 2:31:51.720
 I think at this point, there is no relevant difference.

2:31:51.720 --> 2:32:01.720
 So one of the classic problems because of their power is they suffer from overfitting to the data or for those of you are, you know, statistical orientation.

2:32:01.720 --> 2:32:08.720
 They pick up patterns in the sample that aren't actually present in the population, right?

2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:13.720
 And so what you do is there's various strategies.

2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:18.720
 You can do dropout where you do periodically turn off half of the nodes in a network.

2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:21.720
 You can drop noise into the network.

2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:31.720
 And what that does is it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to generalize more powerfully to the environment.

2:32:31.720 --> 2:32:37.720
 I proposed to you that that's basically what psychedelics do.

2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:39.720
 They do that.

2:32:39.720 --> 2:32:43.720
 They basically do significant constraint reduction.

2:32:43.720 --> 2:32:57.720
 And so you get areas of the brain talking to each other that don't normally talk to each other, areas that do talk to each other, not talking to each other, down regulation of areas that are very dominant, like the default mode network, etc.

2:32:57.720 --> 2:33:05.720
 And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous, sorry, to what's happening in dropout or putting noise into the data.

2:33:05.720 --> 2:33:06.720
 It opens up.

2:33:06.720 --> 2:33:19.720
 And by the way, if you give people, if you give human beings an insight problem that they're trying to solve and you throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight in them.

2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:23.720
 So like literally a very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system.

2:33:23.720 --> 2:33:24.720
 Right.

2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:27.720
 It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up.

2:33:27.720 --> 2:33:33.720
 Now, that means, though, that just doing that, right?

2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:46.720
 In and of itself is not the answer because you also have to make sure that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly.

2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:48.720
 This isn't a problem with neural networks.

2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:51.720
 You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks.

2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:54.720
 And now they explore the state space that they couldn't explore before.

2:33:54.720 --> 2:33:58.720
 Human beings are a little bit more messy around this.

2:33:58.720 --> 2:34:01.720
 And this is where the analogy does get a little bit strained.

2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:11.720
 So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new state space so they can properly integrate it.

2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:19.720
 So beyond Leary's state set and setting, I think you need another S.

2:34:19.720 --> 2:34:20.720
 I think you need sacred.

2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:37.720
 You need psychedelics need to be practiced within a sapiential framework, a framework in which people are independently and beforehand improving their abilities to deal with self deception and afford insight and self regulate.

2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:43.720
 This is, of course, prevent the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous cultures.

2:34:43.720 --> 2:34:56.720
 And I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people self transcending, cultivating, meaning and increasing wisdom.

2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:09.720
 But if I think we remove them out of that context and put them in the context of commodities taken just to have certain phenomenological changes, we run certain important risks.

2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:13.720
 So using the term of higher states of consciousness.

2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:14.720
 Yes.

2:35:14.720 --> 2:35:18.720
 Is consciousness an important part of that word?

2:35:18.720 --> 2:35:20.720
 Why higher?

2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:30.720
 Is it a higher state or is it a detour, a side road on the main road of consciousness?

2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:32.720
 Where did we go here?

2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:36.720
 I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum.

2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:44.720
 There's insight and then if flow is an insight cascade, there's flow and then you can have sort of psychedelic experiences, mind revealing experiences.

2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:50.720
 And then, but they overlap with mystical experiences and they aren't the same.

2:35:50.720 --> 2:36:05.720
 So for example, in the Griffith lab, they gave people psilocybin and they taught them ahead of time how like sort of the features of a mystical experience and only a certain proportion of the people that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic experience.

2:36:05.720 --> 2:36:07.720
 Went from a psychedelic into a mystical experience.

2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:16.720
 What was interesting is the people that had the mystical experience had measurable and longstanding change to one of the big five factors of personality.

2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:17.720
 They had increased openness.

2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:26.720
 Openness is supposed to actually go down over time and these traits aren't supposed to be that malleable and it was significantly like altered, right?

2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:32.720
 But imagine if you just created more openness in a person, right?

2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:38.720
 And they're now open to a lot more and they want to explore a lot more, but you don't give them the tools of discernment.

2:36:38.720 --> 2:36:42.720
 That could be problematic for them in important ways.

2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:43.720
 That could be very problematic.

2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:45.720
 Yes, I got it.

2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:57.720
 So you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow integrated back into your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception of that world.

2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:02.720
 And when people do that, that's when I call it a transformative experience.

2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:10.720
 Now, the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience.

2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:15.720
 Because what happens in these experiences is something really, really interesting.

2:37:15.720 --> 2:37:16.720
 They get to a state that's ineffable.

2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:17.720
 They can't put it into words.

2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:21.720
 They can't describe it, but they do this.

2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:25.720
 They're in this state temporarily and then they come back and they do this.

2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:27.720
 They say, that was really real.

2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:29.720
 And this in comparison is less real.

2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:32.720
 So I remember that platonic meta desire.

2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:37.720
 I want to change my life myself so that I'm more in conformity with that really real.

2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:49.720
 And that is really odd, Lex, because normally when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, when we come back from it, we say, that doesn't fit into everything.

2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:50.720
 Therefore, it's unreal.

2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:52.720
 They do the exact opposite.

2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:59.720
 They come out of these states and they say, that doesn't fit into this consensus intelligibility.

2:37:59.720 --> 2:38:00.720
 And that means this is less real.

2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:02.720
 They do the exact opposite.

2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:03.720
 And that fascinates me.

2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:11.720
 Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative states?

2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:20.720
 And the thing is, those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that ontonormativity, the realness that demands that you make a change in your life,

2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:26.720
 they serve to bridge between mystical experiences and genuine transformative experiences.

2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:30.720
 So you do think seeing those as more real is productive because then you reach for them.

2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:32.720
 So Jaden's done work on it.

2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:36.720
 Again, all of this stuff is recent.

2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:38.720
 So we have to take it with a grain of salt.

2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:49.720
 But by a lot of objective measure, people who do this, who have these higher states of consciousness and undertake the transformative process, their lives get better.

2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:55.720
 The relationships improve, their sense of self improves, their anxieties go down, depression.

2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:02.720
 Like all of these other measures, the needles are moved on these measures by people undergoing this transformative experience.

2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:10.720
 Their lives, by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to be good, get better.

2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:21.720
 I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that leads to mass formation of ideologies that have had an impact on our world.

2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:29.720
 So you spoke about the clash of the two great pseudo religious ideologies of Marxism and Nazism.

2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:30.720
 Yes.

2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:32.720
 Especially their clash on the Eastern Front.

2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:34.720
 Well, of course.

2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:46.720
 Can you explain the origin of each of these Marxism and Nazism in a kind of way that we have been talking about the formation of ideas?

2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:51.720
 Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism.

2:39:51.720 --> 2:40:06.720
 He was like the philosopher who took German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling and he built a philosophical system.

2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:08.720
 He explicitly said this, by the way.

2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:11.720
 He wanted to bridge between philosophy and religion.

2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:12.720
 He explicitly said that.

2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:14.720
 I'm not, I'm not foisting that on him.

2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:17.720
 He said it repeatedly in many different places.

2:40:17.720 --> 2:40:22.720
 So he's trying to create a philosophical system that gathered to it.

2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:38.720
 I think the core mythos of Christianity, core mythos of Christianity is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which progress is real in which our actions now can change the future.

2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:44.720
 We can co participate with God in the creation of the future and that future can be better.

2:40:44.720 --> 2:40:48.720
 We can reach something like a utopia or the promised land or whatever.

2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:51.720
 He created a philosophical system of brilliance, by the way.

2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:52.720
 He's a genius.

2:40:52.720 --> 2:41:02.720
 But basically what it did was it took that religious vision and gave it the air of philosophical intelligibility and respect.

2:41:02.720 --> 2:41:11.720
 And then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the narrative is working itself out that Hegel called dialectic.

2:41:11.720 --> 2:41:14.720
 I don't think it's primarily happening in ideas.

2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:20.720
 I think it's happening primarily in between classes within socioeconomic factors, but it's the same story.

2:41:20.720 --> 2:41:22.720
 Here's this mechanism of history.

2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:23.720
 It's teleological.

2:41:23.720 --> 2:41:25.720
 It's going to move this way.

2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:27.720
 It can move towards a utopia.

2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:36.720
 We can either participate in furthering it like participating in the work of God or we can thwart it and be against it.

2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:40.720
 And so you have a, you have a pseudo religious vision.

2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:42.720
 It's all encompassing.

2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:45.720
 Think about how Marxism is not just a philosophical position.

2:41:45.720 --> 2:41:47.720
 It's not just an economic position.

2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:57.720
 It's an entire worldview and an entire account of history and a demanding account of what human excellence is.

2:41:57.720 --> 2:42:03.720
 And it has all these things about participating, belonging, fitting to.

2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:18.720
 But it's very, in Marx's case, it's very pragmatic or directly applicable to society to where it leads to, it more naturally leads to political ideologies.

2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:19.720
 It does.

2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:25.720
 But I think Marx to a very significant degree inherits one of Hegel's main flaws.

2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:32.720
 Hegel is talking about all this and he's trying to fit it into post Kantian philosophy.

2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:37.720
 So for him, it's ultimately, you know, propositional conceptual.

2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:47.720
 He, like everybody after Descartes is very focused on the propositional level and he's not paying deep attention to the non propositional.

2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:59.720
 This is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, they're trying to put their finger on the non propositional, the non conceptual, the will to power or faith in Kierkegaard.

2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:03.720
 And they're trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing as being inadequate.

2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:10.720
 That's why Kierkegaard met when he said, Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside it, right?

2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:16.720
 And so Marxism is very much, it is activist.

2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:28.720
 It's about reorganizing society, but the transformation in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it's largely about these significant propositional changes

2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:30.720
 and adopting a set of beliefs.

2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:41.720
 When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union, why do you think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people?

2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:46.720
 Not Marxism, but implementation of Marxism in the name of communism.

2:43:46.720 --> 2:44:06.720
 Because it offered people something that typically only religions had offered and it offered people the hope of making a new man, a new kind of human being in a new world.

2:44:06.720 --> 2:44:31.720
 And when you've been living in Russia in which things seem to be locked in a system that is crushing most people, getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy that we can make new human beings and a new world and in which happiness will ensue.

2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:33.720
 That's an intoxicating proposal.

2:44:33.720 --> 2:44:48.720
 You get sort of, like I said, you get all of the intoxication of religious utopia, but you get all the seeming legitimacy of claiming that it's a scientific understanding of history and economics.

2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:52.720
 It's very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days.

2:44:52.720 --> 2:45:11.720
 And I often put myself in the place before any of the implementations came to be. I tried to think if I would be able to predict what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in in the 20th century.

2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:24.720
 And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction because at the core of the ideas are respecting, I mean, with Marx, it's very economics type theory.

2:45:24.720 --> 2:45:34.720
 So it's basically respecting the value of the worker and the regular man in society for making a contribution to that society.

2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:42.720
 And to me, that seems like a powerful idea and it's not clear to me how it goes wrong.

2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:51.720
 In fact, it's still not clear to me why the hell did this like with Stalin happen or Mao happen?

2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:59.720
 It's there's something very interesting and complex about human nature in hierarchies about distributed cognition that results in that.

2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:01.720
 And it's not trivial to understand.

2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:03.720
 No, no.

2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:08.720
 So I mean, I wonder if you can put a finger on it. Why like, why did it go so wrong?

2:46:08.720 --> 2:46:29.720
 So I think, you know, what Ohana talks about in the intellectual history of modernity talks about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal and think about how it's not so radical to us.

2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:37.720
 And in that sense, Marxism has succeeded the radical proposal that you see even in the French Revolution.

2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:45.720
 And don't forget the terror comes in the French Revolution to that we can make ourselves into God like beings.

2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:47.720
 Think of the hubris in that.

2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:48.720
 Right.

2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:56.720
 And think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand human nature and all of its complexities and human history.

2:46:56.720 --> 2:46:57.720
 Right.

2:46:57.720 --> 2:47:04.720
 And think of how religion functioned and every that we can just come in with a plan and make it run.

2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:11.720
 It's to my mind that Promethean spirit is part of why it's doomed to fail.

2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:25.720
 And it's doomed to fail in a kind of terrorizing way because the Promethean spirit really licenses you to do anything because the ends justify the means.

2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:35.720
 The ends justify the means really free you to do some of basically what commit atrocities at any scale.

2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:38.720
 Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Cameroosh.

2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:39.720
 Right.

2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:40.720
 Exactly.

2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:45.720
 And you can only believe in an ends that can justify any means.

2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:51.720
 If you believe in a utopia and you can only believe in the utopia if you really buy into the Promethean spirit.

2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:54.720
 So is that what explains Nazism?

2:47:54.720 --> 2:47:57.720
 So Nazism is part of that too.

2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:02.720
 The Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into Superman.

2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:03.720
 Ubermensch.

2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:04.720
 Right.

2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:19.720
 And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting sort of Gnostic themes that are very prevalent.

2:48:19.720 --> 2:48:26.720
 Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when people are experiencing an increased meaning crisis.

2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:32.720
 And don't forget the Weimar Republic is like a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels.

2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:34.720
 Everybody's suffering domicite.

2:48:34.720 --> 2:48:39.720
 Everybody's home and way of life and identity and culture and relationship to religion and science.

2:48:39.720 --> 2:48:40.720
 All of that.

2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:41.720
 Right.

2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:47.720
 And so Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism.

2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:49.720
 Again, twisted, perverted.

2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:54.720
 I'm not saying all not not not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis.

2:48:54.720 --> 2:49:00.720
 But there is this Gnostic mythology mythos and it comes to the fore.

2:49:00.720 --> 2:49:03.720
 I remember this stuck with me.

2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:04.720
 I undergrad.

2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:12.720
 I was taking political science and the professor extended lecture on this and it still rings true for me.

2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:17.720
 It says, if you understand Nazism as just a political movement, you have misunderstood it.

2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:23.720
 It is much more a religious phenomena in many ways.

2:49:23.720 --> 2:49:26.720
 Is it religious in that the loss of religion?

2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:38.720
 So is it a meaning crisis or is it out of a meaning crisis every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of...

2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:39.720
 I think it's the latter.

2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:42.720
 I think there's this vacuum created.

2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:47.720
 In that context is Hitler, the central religious figure.

2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:48.720
 Yes.

2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:55.720
 And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler or did Hitler create Nazi Germany?

2:49:55.720 --> 2:50:01.720
 So in this distributed cognition where everyone's having a dialogue, what's the role of a charismatic leader?

2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:09.720
 Is it an emergent phenomena or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace?

2:50:09.720 --> 2:50:12.720
 I hope it's not a necessary requirement.

2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:17.720
 I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha rather than a specific individual.

2:50:17.720 --> 2:50:28.720
 But I think in that situation, Hitler's charisma allowed him to take on a mythological in the proper sense archetypal.

2:50:28.720 --> 2:50:30.720
 He became deeply symbolic.

2:50:30.720 --> 2:50:37.720
 And he instituted all kinds of rituals, all kinds of rituals and all kinds of mythos.

2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:42.720
 There's all this mythos about the master race and there's all these rituals.

2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:46.720
 The swastika is of course itself a religious symbol.

2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:59.720
 There's all of this going on because he was tapping into the fact that when you put people into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity,

2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:10.720
 they will fall back on more and more mythological ways of thinking in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new meaning making.

2:51:10.720 --> 2:51:15.720
 I should say meaning participating behavior.

2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:18.720
 What is evil?

2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:20.720
 Is this a word you avoid?

2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:31.720
 No, I don't because I think part of what we're wrestling with here is resisting the Enlightenment.

2:51:31.720 --> 2:51:42.720
 I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced to immorality, individual human immorality.

2:51:42.720 --> 2:51:48.720
 I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin than just immoral.

2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:52.720
 I think sin is a much more comprehensive category.

2:51:52.720 --> 2:52:00.720
 I think sin is a failure to love wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry.

2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:04.720
 You take something as ultimate which is not.

2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:24.720
 That can tend to constolate these collective agents, I call them hyperagents with indistributed cognition that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due to a sum total of immoral decisions.

2:52:24.720 --> 2:52:35.720
 This goes to Hannah Arendt's thing and the banality of Eichmann.

2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:45.720
 Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral decisions but it doesn't seem to capture the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide and the warfare.

2:52:45.720 --> 2:52:55.720
 She's right because you're not going to get just the summation of a lot of individual rather banal immoral choices adding up to what was going on.

2:52:55.720 --> 2:53:09.720
 You're getting a comprehensive parasitic process within massive distributed cognition that has the power to confront the world and confront aspects of the world that individuals can't.

2:53:09.720 --> 2:53:13.720
 I think when we're talking about evil, that's what we're trying to point to.

2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:17.720
 This is a point of convergence between me and Jonathan Peugeot.

2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:18.720
 We've been talking about this.

2:53:18.720 --> 2:53:20.720
 So the word sin is interesting.

2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:21.720
 Yes.

2:53:21.720 --> 2:53:23.720
 Are you comfortable using the word sin?

2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:24.720
 I'm comfortable.

2:53:24.720 --> 2:53:26.720
 Because it's so deeply rooted in religious texts.

2:53:26.720 --> 2:53:27.720
 It is.

2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:28.720
 It is.

2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:37.720
 And I struggle around this because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian and so that is still there within me.

2:53:37.720 --> 2:53:39.720
 There's trauma associated with that.

2:53:39.720 --> 2:53:44.720
 Probably layers of self deception mechanisms.

2:53:44.720 --> 2:53:45.720
 No doubt.

2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:46.720
 No doubt.

2:53:46.720 --> 2:53:48.720
 You're slowly escaping.

2:53:48.720 --> 2:53:49.720
 Trying to.

2:53:49.720 --> 2:54:01.720
 And trying to come into a proper respectful relationship with Christianity via a detour through Buddhism, Taoism and pagan Neoplatonism.

2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:03.720
 Trying to find a way how to love wisely.

2:54:03.720 --> 2:54:04.720
 Yes, exactly.

2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:17.720
 And so I want to, I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something that we would prototypically call immoral.

2:54:17.720 --> 2:54:29.720
 But if they're failing to love wisely, they are disconnecting themselves in some important way from the structures of reality.

2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:34.720
 And I think it was you, I may be wrong.

2:54:34.720 --> 2:54:38.720
 You've said, you know, people don't do things because they think it's wrong.

2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:42.720
 They do a lesser good in place of a greater good.

2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:45.720
 And that's a different thing than being immoral.

2:54:45.720 --> 2:54:47.720
 I mean, moral we're saying, you know, you're doing something that's wrong.

2:54:47.720 --> 2:54:51.720
 It's like, well, no, no, you know, I'm loving my wife.

2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:52.720
 That's a great thing.

2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:53.720
 Isn't it?

2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:54.720
 Yeah.

2:54:54.720 --> 2:54:58.720
 But if you love your wife at the expense of your kids.

2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:00.720
 Wow, maybe something's going awry here.

2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:01.720
 Right.

2:55:01.720 --> 2:55:02.720
 Well, I love my country.

2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:03.720
 Great.

2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:09.720
 But should you love your country at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong to?

2:55:09.720 --> 2:55:12.720
 Like people should wrestle with these questions.

2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:17.720
 And I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions properly.

2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:18.720
 Yeah.

2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:21.720
 To be content with the choices you've made without considering.

2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:22.720
 Yeah.

2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:25.720
 Is there a greater good that could be done?

2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:26.720
 Yeah.

2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:36.720
 Your lecture series on the meaning crisis puts us in dialogue in the same way as with the podcast with a bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout history.

2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:37.720
 Yes.

2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:42.720
 Heidegger, Corbin, the man Carl Jung, Tillage Barfield.

2:55:42.720 --> 2:55:43.720
 Yes.

2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:52.720
 Is there, can you describe, this might be challenging, but one powerful idea from each that jumps to mind.

2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:53.720
 Yes.

2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:54.720
 Maybe Heidegger.

2:55:54.720 --> 2:56:01.720
 So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had a huge influence on me.

2:56:01.720 --> 2:56:03.720
 He's had a huge influence on me in many ways.

2:56:03.720 --> 2:56:06.720
 He's a big influence on what's called 4e cognitive science.

2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:13.720
 And this whole idea about the non propositional, that was deeply, you know, afforded by Heidegger and Marlo Ponti.

2:56:13.720 --> 2:56:23.720
 But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one, is his critique of ontotheology, his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a supreme being.

2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:32.720
 Something like that and how that gets us fundamentally messed up and we get disconnected from being because we are over focused on particular beings.

2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:34.720
 We're failing to love wisely.

2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:39.720
 We're loving the individual things and we're not loving the ground from which they spring.

2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:41.720
 Can you explain that a little more?

2:56:41.720 --> 2:56:45.720
 What's the difference between the being and the supreme being and why that gets us into trouble?

2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:46.720
 Okay.

2:56:46.720 --> 2:56:52.720
 So like, well, we talked about this before, the supreme being is a particular being, whereas being is no thing.

2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:54.720
 It's not any particular kind of thing.

2:56:54.720 --> 2:57:02.720
 And so if you're thinking of being as a being, you're thinking of it in a thingy way about something that is fundamentally no thingness.

2:57:02.720 --> 2:57:07.720
 And so then you're disconnecting yourself from presumably ultimate reality.

2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:09.720
 This takes me to Tillich.

2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:19.720
 Tillich's great idea is understanding faith as ultimate concern rather than a set of propositions that you're asserting.

2:57:19.720 --> 2:57:24.720
 So what are you ultimately concerned about?

2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:28.720
 What do you want to be in right relationship to?

2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:30.720
 Ratio relicchio?

2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:35.720
 And is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?

2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:38.720
 Are those two things in sync?

2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:43.720
 This has had a profound influence on me and I think it's a brilliant idea.

2:57:43.720 --> 2:57:48.720
 So some of the others, how do they integrate?

2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:52.720
 Maybe they're called young and Freud.

2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:54.720
 Which team are you on?

2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:56.720
 I'm on young.

2:57:56.720 --> 2:57:58.720
 Freud is the better writer.

2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:04.720
 But young has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer to where cognitive science is heading.

2:58:04.720 --> 2:58:06.720
 He's more prescient.

2:58:06.720 --> 2:58:08.720
 Which aspect of his model of the psyche?

2:58:08.720 --> 2:58:09.720
 Directly.

2:58:09.720 --> 2:58:11.720
 So Freud has a hydraulic model.

2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:12.720
 The psyche is like a steam engine.

2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:13.720
 Things are under pressure.

2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:15.720
 There's a fluid that's moving around.

2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:19.720
 Like this is a record note of this.

2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:21.720
 Young has an organic model.

2:58:21.720 --> 2:58:23.720
 The psyche is like a living being.

2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:25.720
 It's doing all this opponent processing.

2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:29.720
 It's doing all of this self transcending and growing.

2:58:29.720 --> 2:58:36.720
 And I think that's a much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model.

2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:40.720
 What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind?

2:58:40.720 --> 2:58:46.720
 What do you think their view and your own view of what's going on there in the shadow?

2:58:46.720 --> 2:58:50.720
 All that stuff, some good stuff.

2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:52.720
 Any stuff at all?

2:58:52.720 --> 2:58:59.720
 Well, I mean, both Freud and Young are only talking about the psychodynamic unconscious,

2:58:59.720 --> 2:59:01.720
 which is only a small part of the unconscious.

2:59:01.720 --> 2:59:03.720
 Can you elaborate?

2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:09.720
 They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do

2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:17.720
 with your sort of ego development and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.

2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:19.720
 Yeah, but what else is there?

2:59:19.720 --> 2:59:24.720
 There's the unconscious that allows you to turn the noise coming out of my face hole into ideas.

2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:30.720
 There's the unconscious that says, yeah, all that stuff, which is huge and powerful.

2:59:30.720 --> 2:59:32.720
 And they didn't think about that.

2:59:32.720 --> 2:59:38.720
 They're focused on the big romantic stuff that you have to deal with through psychotherapy, that kind of stuff.

2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:39.720
 It's relevant and important.

2:59:39.720 --> 2:59:40.720
 I'm not dismissing.

2:59:40.720 --> 2:59:43.720
 I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it's certainly not all of the unconscious.

2:59:43.720 --> 2:59:48.720
 A lot of work that's going on, my colleague and deep friend, Anderson Todd,

2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:52.720
 is about can we take the Jungian stuff and the cognitive science stuff

2:59:52.720 --> 2:59:54.720
 and can we integrate it together theoretically?

2:59:54.720 --> 2:59:58.720
 And so he's working on that, exactly that project.

2:59:58.720 --> 3:00:01.720
 But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.

3:00:01.720 --> 3:00:02.720
 Or at least an unconscious.

3:00:02.720 --> 3:00:04.720
 I like the term unconscious.

3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:08.720
 And Jung continually reminded people that the unconscious is unconscious,

3:00:08.720 --> 3:00:10.720
 that we're not conscious of it.

3:00:10.720 --> 3:00:12.720
 And that's its fundamental property.

3:00:12.720 --> 3:00:13.720
 Yeah.

3:00:13.720 --> 3:00:20.720
 And then isn't the task of therapy then to make the unconscious conscious?

3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:22.720
 Yeah, to a degree, right?

3:00:22.720 --> 3:00:29.720
 But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there was unconscious

3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:31.720
 is part of Jung's mythos.

3:00:31.720 --> 3:00:35.720
 But it's also not the thought that that can be completed.

3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:39.720
 Part of the why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind

3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:44.720
 is it so it can enter into more proper dialogical relationship

3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:48.720
 with the self organizing system of the unconscious mind.

3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:52.720
 What do they have to say about the motivations of humans?

3:00:52.720 --> 3:00:55.720
 So for Freud joking, I said, you know, sex,

3:00:55.720 --> 3:00:59.720
 there's so much of our mind is developing our young age,

3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:03.720
 sexual interactions with the world or whatever.

3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:07.720
 Hence the thing about the edible complex and all, you know,

3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:10.720
 wanting to have sex with your mother.

3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:15.720
 What do you think about their description about what motivates humans?

3:01:15.720 --> 3:01:21.720
 And what do you think about the will to power from Nietzsche?

3:01:21.720 --> 3:01:23.720
 Which camp are you in there?

3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:25.720
 What motivates humans?

3:01:25.720 --> 3:01:28.720
 Sex or power?

3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:30.720
 I think Plato is right.

3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:32.720
 And I think there's a connection for me.

3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:34.720
 Plato is my first philosopher.

3:01:34.720 --> 3:01:35.720
 Jung is my first psychologist.

3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:37.720
 And Jung is very much the Plato of the psyche.

3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:38.720
 You never forget your first.

3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:39.720
 Yeah, you never do.

3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:40.720
 You never do.

3:01:40.720 --> 3:01:46.720
 And I think we have, I reject the monological mind.

3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:49.720
 I reject the monophasic mind model.

3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:51.720
 I think we are multi centered.

3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:54.720
 I think we have different centers of motivation

3:01:54.720 --> 3:02:01.720
 to cooperate according to different principles, to satisfy different problems.

3:02:01.720 --> 3:02:07.720
 And that part of the task of our humanity is to get those different centers

3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:14.720
 into some internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating

3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:18.720
 rather than in conflict with each other.

3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:21.720
 What advice would you give to young people?

3:02:21.720 --> 3:02:25.720
 They're in high school trying to figure out what they're going to do with their life.

3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:27.720
 Maybe they're in college.

3:02:27.720 --> 3:02:31.720
 What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of

3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:37.720
 or how to have a life they can be proud of?

3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:44.720
 So the first thing is find an ecology of practices

3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:48.720
 and a community that supports them without involving you

3:02:48.720 --> 3:02:53.720
 in believing things that contravene our best understood science

3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:59.720
 so that wisdom and virtue, especially how they show up in relationships

3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:01.720
 are primary to you.

3:03:01.720 --> 3:03:07.720
 This will sound ridiculous, but if you take care of that,

3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:10.720
 the other things you want are more likely to occur

3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:15.720
 because what you most want is what you want

3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:21.720
 when you're approaching your death is what were the relationships

3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:25.720
 you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world,

3:03:25.720 --> 3:03:29.720
 and what did you do to improve the chance of them being deep

3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:32.720
 and profound relationships?

3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:35.720
 That's an interesting ecology of practice.

3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:39.720
 Finding a place where a lot of people are doing different things

3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:42.720
 that are interesting, interplay with each other,

3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:48.720
 but at the same time is not a cult where ideas can flourish.

3:03:48.720 --> 3:03:52.720
 Now, how the hell do you know?

3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:57.720
 Because in a place where people are really excited about doing stuff,

3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:00.720
 that's very ripe for cult formation.

3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:05.720
 Especially if they're a wash and a culture in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit.

3:04:05.720 --> 3:04:07.720
 Yes, precisely.

3:04:07.720 --> 3:04:10.720
 So try to keep away from the bullshit is the advice.

3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:13.720
 Yes. I mean, I take this very seriously.

3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:17.720
 And I was with a bunch of people in Vermont at the respond retreat.

3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:19.720
 People, Rafe Kelly was there.

3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:26.720
 A bunch of people who have set up ecologies of practices and created communities.

3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:31.720
 And I have good reason to find all of these people trustworthy.

3:04:31.720 --> 3:04:35.720
 And so we gather together to try and generate real deologos,

3:04:35.720 --> 3:04:40.720
 flow in distributed cognition, exercise the collective intelligence

3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:45.720
 and try and address that problem both in terms of, you know,

3:04:45.720 --> 3:04:51.720
 metacurriculum that we can offer emerging communities in terms of practices of vetting,

3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:57.720
 how we will self govern the federation we're forming so that we can resist gurification.

3:04:57.720 --> 3:04:59.720
 Gurification of people or ideas.

3:04:59.720 --> 3:05:00.720
 Both.

3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:01.720
 Both.

3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:02.720
 Some of us just get unlucky.

3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:08.720
 Some of us get unlucky and we, we all at respond,

3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:11.720
 we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around this,

3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:15.720
 but we were trying to balance it about not being premature,

3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:18.720
 but there it was going to, I mean, there's,

3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:21.720
 we're going to produce a metacurriculum that's coming in months.

3:05:21.720 --> 3:05:26.720
 There's going to be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on wisdom

3:05:26.720 --> 3:05:30.720
 with this practitioner based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom.

3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:38.720
 There's going to be projects about how we can create a self correcting vetted vetting system.

3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:42.720
 So we can say to people, we think this ecology is legit.

3:05:42.720 --> 3:05:46.720
 It's in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies.

3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:47.720
 We don't know about that one.

3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:49.720
 We're hesitant about that one.

3:05:49.720 --> 3:05:50.720
 It's not in good fellowship.

3:05:50.720 --> 3:05:51.720
 We have concerns.

3:05:51.720 --> 3:05:54.720
 Here's why we have our concerns, et cetera.

3:05:54.720 --> 3:05:56.720
 And you may say, well, who are you to do that?

3:05:56.720 --> 3:05:59.720
 It's like nobody, but somebody's got to do it.

3:05:59.720 --> 3:06:00.720
 Right?

3:06:00.720 --> 3:06:01.720
 And that's what it comes down to.

3:06:01.720 --> 3:06:03.720
 And so we're going to give it our best effort.

3:06:03.720 --> 3:06:05.720
 It's worth a try.

3:06:05.720 --> 3:06:11.720
 You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization,

3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:16.720
 but in your own personal life,

3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:19.720
 what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind?

3:06:19.720 --> 3:06:23.720
 Has there been difficult times in your life where you really struggled?

3:06:23.720 --> 3:06:25.720
 Yes.

3:06:25.720 --> 3:06:31.720
 So when I left fundamentalist Christianity,

3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:37.720
 and for a while I was just sort of a hard bitten atheist,

3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:43.720
 the problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn't deal with

3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:47.720
 all the non propositional things that had gotten into me,

3:06:47.720 --> 3:06:52.720
 all the procedures and habits and all the perspectives and all the identities

3:06:52.720 --> 3:06:55.720
 and the trauma associated with that.

3:06:55.720 --> 3:07:00.720
 So I required therapy, I required years of meditation and Tai Chi,

3:07:00.720 --> 3:07:02.720
 and I'm still wrestling with it.

3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:09.720
 But for the first four or five years, I would...

3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:11.720
 I described it like this.

3:07:11.720 --> 3:07:13.720
 I called it the black burning.

3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:17.720
 I felt like there was a blackness that was on fire inside of me,

3:07:17.720 --> 3:07:22.720
 precisely because the religion had left a taste for the transcendent in my mouth,

3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:26.720
 but the food it had given me, food in square quotes,

3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:28.720
 had soured in my stomach and made me nauseous.

3:07:28.720 --> 3:07:35.720
 And the juxtaposition of those seemed like an irresolvable problem for me.

3:07:35.720 --> 3:07:38.720
 That was a very, very dark time for me.

3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:41.720
 Did it feel lonely?

3:07:41.720 --> 3:07:44.720
 When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely.

3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:50.720
 And deeply alienating, the universe seemed absurd.

3:07:50.720 --> 3:07:53.720
 And there was also existential anxiety.

3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:55.720
 I talk about these things for a reason.

3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:57.720
 I don't just talk about them as things I'm pointing to.

3:07:57.720 --> 3:08:01.720
 I'm talking about them as seeing in myself and in people I care,

3:08:01.720 --> 3:08:09.720
 having undergone them and how they can bring you close to self destructive.

3:08:09.720 --> 3:08:13.720
 I started engaging in kinds of self destructive behavior.

3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:17.720
 Meaning crisis to you is not just the thing you look outside

3:08:17.720 --> 3:08:20.720
 and see many people struggling.

3:08:20.720 --> 3:08:22.720
 You yourself are struggling.

3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:26.720
 That's, in fact, the narrative is I struggled with it,

3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:30.720
 thinking it was a purely personal, idiosyncratic thing.

3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:32.720
 I started learning the kogsai.

3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:34.720
 I started doing the tai chi and the meditation.

3:08:34.720 --> 3:08:36.720
 I started doing all this, right?

3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:38.720
 Socratic philosophy.

3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:45.720
 And when I started to talk about these pieces, I saw my students eyes light up.

3:08:45.720 --> 3:08:52.720
 And I realized, oh wait, maybe this isn't just something I'm going through.

3:08:52.720 --> 3:08:56.720
 And then talking to them and then doing the research and expanding it out.

3:08:56.720 --> 3:09:01.720
 It's like, oh, many people in a shared fashion

3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:05.720
 and also in an individual lonely fashion are going through meaning crisis.

3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:08.720
 Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning.

3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:11.720
 And you said that the goal is to love wisely.

3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:13.720
 So let me ask about love.

3:09:13.720 --> 3:09:16.720
 What's the role of love in the human condition?

3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:18.720
 It's central.

3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:22.720
 I mean, it's even central to reason and rationality.

3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:28.720
 This is Plato, but Spinoza, the most logical of the rationalists.

3:09:28.720 --> 3:09:32.720
 You know, the ethics is written like Euclid's geometry,

3:09:32.720 --> 3:09:35.720
 but he calls it the ethics for a reason

3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:38.720
 because he wants to talk about the blessed life.

3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:39.720
 And what does he say?

3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:43.720
 He says that ultimately reason needs love

3:09:43.720 --> 3:09:51.720
 because love is what brings reason out of being entrapped in the gravity well of egocentrism.

3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:55.720
 And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really beautifully,

3:09:55.720 --> 3:10:00.720
 love is when you painfully realize that something other than yourself is real.

3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:05.720
 Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism.

3:10:05.720 --> 3:10:08.720
 Beautifully put, a beautiful way to end it, John.

3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:10.720
 You're a beautiful human being.

3:10:10.720 --> 3:10:15.720
 Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the search for meaning

3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:18.720
 and encouraging others to do the same.

3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:21.720
 And ultimately to learn how to love wisely.

3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:22.720
 Thank you so much for talking today.

3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:24.720
 It's been a great pleasure, Lex.

3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:25.720
 I really enjoyed it a lot.

3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:26.720
 Thank you so much.

3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:30.720
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Verveke.

3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:33.720
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:37.720
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Herman Hesse and Siddhartha.

3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:40.720
 I've always believed, and I still believe,

3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:43.720
 that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way,

3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:48.720
 we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.

3:10:48.720 --> 3:11:00.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
