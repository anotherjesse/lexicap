00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
 The following is a conversation with Matt Walker,

00:02.520 --> 00:04.840
 sleep scientist, professor of neuroscience

00:04.840 --> 00:08.720
 and psychology at Berkeley, author of Why We Sleep

00:08.720 --> 00:11.560
 and The Host of a new podcast

00:11.560 --> 00:14.280
 called The Matt Walker Podcast.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.160
 It's 10 minute episodes a couple of times a month

00:17.160 --> 00:20.800
 covering sleep and other health and science topics.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.600
 I love it and recommend it highly.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.440
 It's up there with the greats

00:24.440 --> 00:28.160
 like the Huberman Lab podcast with Andrew Huberman.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.640
 And I think Davis and Claire is putting out

00:30.640 --> 00:32.380
 an audio series soon too.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.800
 I can't wait to listen to it.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.840
 I'm really excited by the future of science

00:36.840 --> 00:38.720
 in the podcasting world.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.720

00:47.200 --> 00:49.880
 There are links are in the description.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.280
 As a side note, let me say that to me,

00:52.280 --> 00:55.160
 a healthy life is one in which you fall in love

00:55.160 --> 00:58.600
 with the world around you, with ideas, with people,

00:58.600 --> 01:02.040
 with small goals and big goals, no matter how difficult,

01:02.040 --> 01:05.840
 with dreams you hold onto and chase for years.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.900
 Life should be lived fully.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.960
 That to me is the priority.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.040
 That to me is a healthy life.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.160
 Second to that is the understanding

01:14.160 --> 01:16.880
 and the utilization of the best available science

01:16.880 --> 01:20.520
 on diet, exercise, supplements, sleep

01:20.520 --> 01:22.700
 and other lifestyle choices.

01:22.700 --> 01:26.480
 To me, science in the realm of health is a guide

01:26.480 --> 01:28.920
 for we should try not the absolute truth

01:28.920 --> 01:30.920
 of how to live life.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.000
 The goal is to learn to listen to your body

01:33.000 --> 01:35.760
 and figure out what works best for you.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.440
 All that said, a good night's sleep can be a great tool

01:39.440 --> 01:41.680
 in making life awesome and productive.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.920
 And Matt is a great advocate of the how

01:44.920 --> 01:46.920
 and the why of sleep.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.720
 We agree on some things and disagree on others,

01:49.720 --> 01:52.400
 but he's a great human being, a great scientist

01:52.400 --> 01:54.600
 and is a recently a friend,

01:54.600 --> 01:58.680
 with whom I enjoy having these wide ranging conversations.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.800
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

02:00.800 --> 02:04.160
 and here is my conversation with Matt Walker.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.880
 You should try these shades on and see what you look like.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.720
 So they are now your shades and that's not the question.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.680
 It's the same thing as Putin took the Super Bowl ring

02:17.680 --> 02:18.840
 and it's now his ring.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.840
 Yeah, one wonders if he was offered it, but they are yours.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.920
 When did you first fall in love

02:28.920 --> 02:32.880
 with the dream of understanding sleep?

02:32.880 --> 02:36.400
 Like where did the fascination with sleep begin?

02:38.480 --> 02:41.120
 So back in the United Kingdom,

02:41.120 --> 02:44.120
 you can sort of start doing medicine at age to 18

02:44.120 --> 02:46.080
 and it's a five year program.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.760
 And I was at the Queen's Medical Center in the UK

02:50.640 --> 02:52.760
 and I remember just being fascinated

02:52.760 --> 02:57.200
 by states of consciousness and particularly anesthesia.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.240
 I was thinking, isn't that within seconds

03:00.240 --> 03:03.320
 I can take a perfectly conscious human being

03:03.320 --> 03:07.560
 and I can remove all existence of the mentality

03:07.560 --> 03:09.840
 and their awareness within seconds.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.520
 And that stunned me.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.520
 So I started to get really interested in conscious states.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.960
 I even started to read a lot about hypnosis

03:19.720 --> 03:22.320
 and all of these things, hypnosis,

03:22.320 --> 03:24.360
 even sleep and dreams at the time,

03:24.360 --> 03:25.960
 they were very esoteric.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.760
 It was sort of charlatan science at that stage.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.240
 And I think almost all of my colleagues

03:33.240 --> 03:36.680
 and I are accidental sleep researchers.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.000
 No one as I recall in the classroom

03:39.000 --> 03:41.440
 when you're sort of five years old and the teacher says,

03:41.440 --> 03:44.040
 what would you like to be when you grow up?

03:44.040 --> 03:45.360
 No one's putting their hand up and saying,

03:45.360 --> 03:48.560
 I would love to be a sleep researcher.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.480
 And so when I was doing my PhD,

03:51.480 --> 03:55.080
 I was trying to identify different forms of dementia

03:55.080 --> 03:57.480
 very early on in the course.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.680
 And I was using electrical brainwave recordings to do that.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.640
 And I was failing miserably.

04:02.640 --> 04:07.240
 It was a disaster, just no result after no result.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.200
 And I used to go home to the doctor's residence

04:09.200 --> 04:11.240
 with this sort of little igloo of journals

04:11.240 --> 04:13.200
 that at the weekend I would sort of sit in

04:13.200 --> 04:16.960
 and read and which I'm now thinking,

04:16.960 --> 04:18.160
 do I really want to admit this?

04:18.160 --> 04:19.800
 Because it sounds like I had no social life,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.920
 which I didn't, I was social leper.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.280
 But and I started to realize that some parts of the brain

04:26.280 --> 04:29.040
 were sleep related areas.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.560
 And some dementias were eating away

04:31.560 --> 04:33.680
 those sleep related areas.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.760
 Other dementias would leave them untouched.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.080
 And I thought, well, I'm doing this all wrong.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.280
 I'm measuring my patients while they're awake.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.760
 Instead I should be measuring them

04:42.760 --> 04:44.000
 while they're asleep.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.760
 Started doing that, got some amazing results.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.720
 And then I wanted to ask the question,

04:49.720 --> 04:52.520
 is that sleep disruption

04:52.520 --> 04:54.080
 that my patients are experiencing

04:54.080 --> 04:55.680
 as they go into dementia?

04:55.680 --> 04:57.880
 Maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.960
 I wonder if it's a cause of the dementia.

05:01.960 --> 05:06.080
 And at that point, which was golf golf 20 years ago,

05:07.840 --> 05:11.080
 no one could answer a very simple fundamental question.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.920
 Why do we sleep?

05:12.920 --> 05:17.000
 And I at the time didn't realize

05:17.000 --> 05:18.680
 that some of the most brilliant minds

05:18.680 --> 05:21.320
 in scientific history had tried to answer that question

05:21.320 --> 05:22.560
 and failed.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.520
 And at that point, I just thought, well,

05:24.520 --> 05:27.640
 I'm going to go and do a couple of years of sleep research

05:27.640 --> 05:30.200
 and I'll figure out why we sleep.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.680
 And then I'll come back to my patients

05:31.680 --> 05:33.680
 in this question of dementia.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.360
 And as I said, that was 20 years ago.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.600
 And what I realized is that hard questions

05:38.600 --> 05:41.480
 care very little about who asks them.

05:41.480 --> 05:45.200
 They will meter out their lessons of difficulty all the same.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.880
 And I was schooled in the difficulty of the question,

05:48.880 --> 05:50.520
 why do we sleep?

05:50.520 --> 05:53.040
 But in truth, 20 years later,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.320
 we've had to upend the question

05:55.320 --> 05:57.240
 rather than saying, why do we sleep?

05:57.240 --> 06:00.000
 And by the way, the answer then was

06:00.000 --> 06:02.160
 that we sleep to cure sleepiness.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.080
 Which is like saying, we eat to cure hunger.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.400
 That tells you nothing about the physiological benefits

06:09.400 --> 06:11.640
 of food, same with sleep.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.360
 Now we've actually have to ask the question,

06:14.360 --> 06:17.160
 is there any physiological system in the body

06:17.160 --> 06:19.400
 or any major operation of the mind

06:19.400 --> 06:22.440
 that isn't wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep

06:22.440 --> 06:25.600
 or demonstrably impaired when we don't get enough?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.920
 And so far, for the most part, the answer seems to be no.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
 So far, the answer seems to be no.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
 So why does the body and the mind crave sleep then?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.240
 Why do we sleep?

06:41.240 --> 06:45.840
 How can we begin to answer that question then?

06:45.840 --> 06:49.120
 So I think one of the ways that I think about this all,

06:49.120 --> 06:53.120
 one of the answers that came to me is the following.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.520
 The reason that we implode so quickly

06:55.520 --> 06:58.720
 and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep

06:58.720 --> 07:01.880
 is because human beings seem to be one of the few species

07:01.880 --> 07:04.120
 that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep

07:04.120 --> 07:06.760
 for no apparent good reason, biological.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.280
 And what that led me then to was the following.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.320
 Mother nature as a consequence.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.520
 So no other species does what we do in that context.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.680
 There are a few species that do undergo sleep deprivation,

07:21.680 --> 07:25.200
 but for very obvious, clear biological reasons.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.320
 One is when they're in a condition of severe starvation.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.600
 The second is when they're caring for their newborn.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.840
 So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves.

07:34.840 --> 07:38.400
 The female will go away from the pod, give birth,

07:38.400 --> 07:40.440
 and then bring the calf back.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.840
 And during that time,

07:41.840 --> 07:44.560
 the mother will undergo sleep deprivation.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.160
 And then the third one is during migration

07:47.160 --> 07:51.960
 when birds are flying trans oceanographic to 3000 miles.

07:51.960 --> 07:52.920
 But for the most part,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.520
 it's never seen in the animal kingdom,

07:55.520 --> 07:57.680
 which brings me back to the point.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.480
 Therefore, mother nature in the course of evolution

08:01.480 --> 08:03.480
 has never had to face the challenge

08:03.480 --> 08:05.600
 of this thing called sleep deprivation.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.560
 And therefore she has never created a safety net in place

08:11.920 --> 08:15.920
 to circumnavigate this common influence.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.040
 And there is a good example where we have,

08:19.040 --> 08:22.880
 which is called the adipose cell, the fat cell.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.040
 Because during our evolutionary past,

08:25.040 --> 08:27.480
 we had famine and we had feast.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.720
 And mother nature came up with a very clever recipe,

08:29.720 --> 08:34.480
 which is how can I store caloric credit

08:34.480 --> 08:37.200
 so that I can spend it when I go into debt?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.640
 And the fat cell was born, brilliant idea.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.040
 Where is the fat cell for sleep?

08:42.040 --> 08:44.400
 Where is that sort of banking chip for sleep?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.560
 And unfortunately, we don't seem to have one

08:46.560 --> 08:49.400
 because she's never had to face that challenge.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.680
 So even if there's not some kind of physics

08:52.680 --> 08:55.280
 fundamental need for sleep

08:55.280 --> 08:58.800
 that physiologically or psychologically,

08:58.800 --> 09:03.680
 the fact is most organisms are built such that they need it.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.040
 And then mother nature never built an extra mechanism

09:08.040 --> 09:09.560
 for sleep deprivation.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.160
 So it's interesting that why we sleep

09:12.160 --> 09:13.560
 by not have a good answer,

09:14.920 --> 09:19.440
 but we need to sleep to be healthy is nevertheless true.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.720
 Yeah, and we have many answers right now.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.920
 In some ways, the question of why we sleep

09:23.920 --> 09:25.960
 was the wrong question too.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.240
 It's what are the pluripotent many reasons we sleep?

09:30.240 --> 09:32.520
 We don't just sleep for one reason

09:32.520 --> 09:35.800
 because from an evolutionary perspective,

09:35.800 --> 09:40.000
 it is the most idiotic thing that you could imagine.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
 When you're sleeping, you're not finding a mate,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.520
 you're not reproducing, you're not caring for your young,

09:45.520 --> 09:47.480
 you're not foraging for food.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.640
 And worse still, you're vulnerable to predation.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.720
 So on any one of those grounds,

09:52.720 --> 09:54.680
 especially as a collective,

09:54.680 --> 09:56.560
 sleep should have been strongly selected

09:56.560 --> 09:59.800
 against in the course of evolution.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.920
 But in every species that we've studied carefully to date,

10:03.920 --> 10:05.920
 sleep is present.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.040
 So it is important.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.000
 So like you're right.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.720
 I think I've heard arguments from an evolutionary biology

10:11.720 --> 10:15.800
 perspective that sleep is actually advantageous.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.600
 Maybe like some kind of predator, prey relationships.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.320
 But you're saying, and actually makes way more sense

10:21.320 --> 10:25.120
 what you're saying is it should have been selected against.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.280
 Like why close your eyes?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.120
 Yeah, why?

10:28.120 --> 10:32.360
 Because there was an energy conservation hypothesis for a while,

10:32.360 --> 10:36.160
 which is that we need to essentially go into low battery mode,

10:36.160 --> 10:38.840
 power down because it's unsustainable.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.880
 But in fact, that actually has been blasted out the water

10:41.880 --> 10:45.640
 because sleep is an incredibly active process.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.880
 In fact, the difference between you just lying on the couch

10:48.880 --> 10:51.800
 but remaining conscious versus you lying on the couch

10:51.800 --> 10:55.360
 and falling asleep, it's only a savings of about 140,

10:55.360 --> 10:56.600
 150 calories.

10:56.600 --> 11:00.040
 In other words, you just go out and club another baby seal

11:00.040 --> 11:02.360
 or whatever it was and you wouldn't worry.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.000
 So it has to be much more to it than energy conservation,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.760
 much more to it than sharing ecosystem space and time,

11:09.760 --> 11:13.600
 much more to it than simply predator prey relationships.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.240
 If sleep really did, and looking back,

11:17.240 --> 11:19.440
 even very old evolutionary organisms

11:19.440 --> 11:22.120
 like earthworms, millions of years old,

11:22.120 --> 11:24.720
 they have periods where they're active

11:24.720 --> 11:26.480
 and periods where they're passively asleep.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.720
 It's called lethargicus.

11:28.720 --> 11:32.200
 And so what that in some way suggested to me

11:32.200 --> 11:36.680
 was sleep evolved with life itself on this planet.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.680
 And then it has fought its way through heroically

11:39.680 --> 11:42.640
 every step along the evolutionary pathway,

11:42.640 --> 11:46.520
 which then leads to the sort of famous sleep statement

11:46.520 --> 11:48.840
 from a researcher that if sleep doesn't serve

11:48.840 --> 11:52.120
 an absolutely vital function or functions,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.240
 then it's the biggest mistake the evolutionary process

11:54.240 --> 11:55.680
 has ever made.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.240
 And we've now realized Mother Nature

11:57.240 --> 12:00.080
 didn't make a spectacular blender with sleep.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.120
 You've mentioned an idea of conscious states.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.440
 Do you think of sleep as a fundamentally different

12:06.440 --> 12:11.080
 conscious state than awakeness?

12:11.080 --> 12:13.280
 And how many conscious states are there

12:13.280 --> 12:16.160
 sort of when you're into it, your understanding

12:16.160 --> 12:17.360
 of what the mind can do?

12:17.360 --> 12:20.480
 Do you think awake state, sleep state,

12:20.480 --> 12:22.680
 or is there some kind of continuum?

12:22.680 --> 12:26.200
 There's a complicated state transition diagram.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.560
 Like how do you think about this whole space?

12:28.560 --> 12:32.040
 I think about it as a state space diagram.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.080
 And I think it's probably more of a continuum

12:34.080 --> 12:37.680
 than we have believed it to be or suggested it to be.

12:37.680 --> 12:41.400
 So we used to think absent of anesthesia

12:41.400 --> 12:44.520
 that there were already three main states of consciousness

12:44.520 --> 12:48.880
 that was being awake, being in non rapid eye movement sleep

12:48.880 --> 12:52.040
 or non dream sleep, and then being in rapid eye movement

12:52.040 --> 12:53.320
 sleep or dream sleep.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.400
 And those were the three states within which your brain

12:56.400 --> 13:00.360
 could percolate and be conscious.

13:00.360 --> 13:05.120
 Conscious during non REM sleep is maybe a stretch to say,

13:05.120 --> 13:08.520
 but I still believe there is plenty of consciousness there.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.480
 I don't believe that though anymore.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.960
 And the reason is because we can have daydreams

13:15.960 --> 13:20.200
 and we are in a very different wakeful state

13:20.200 --> 13:23.440
 in those daydreams than we are when we are, as we are now,

13:23.440 --> 13:27.240
 together present and extraceptively focused

13:27.240 --> 13:30.960
 rather than intraceptively focused.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.880
 And then we also know that as you

13:33.880 --> 13:37.520
 are sort of progressing into those different stages of sleep

13:37.520 --> 13:40.360
 during non REM sleep, you can also still dream.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.400
 It depends on your definition of dreaming,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.920
 but we seem to have some degree of dreaming

13:44.920 --> 13:48.600
 in almost all stages of sleep.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.000
 We've also then found that when you are sleep deprived,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.280
 there are even individual brain cells will fall asleep.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.120
 Despite the animal being, you know,

13:59.120 --> 14:02.480
 behaviorally from best we can tell awake,

14:02.480 --> 14:05.120
 individual brain cells and clusters of brain cells

14:05.120 --> 14:07.800
 will go into a sleep like state.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.000
 And humans do this too, when we are sleep deprived,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.600
 we have what are called microsleeps,

14:13.600 --> 14:17.200
 where the eyelid will partially close

14:17.200 --> 14:20.560
 and the brain essentially falls lapses

14:20.560 --> 14:23.080
 into a state of sleep,

14:23.080 --> 14:25.360
 but behaviorally you seem to be awake

14:25.360 --> 14:28.840
 and the danger here is road traffic accidents.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.680
 So these are what we call these sort of microsleep events

14:33.680 --> 14:34.800
 at the wheel.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.080
 Now, if you're traveling at 65 miles an hour

14:38.080 --> 14:40.720
 in a two ton vehicle, you know,

14:40.720 --> 14:42.760
 it takes probably around one second

14:42.760 --> 14:44.360
 to drift from one lane to the next

14:44.360 --> 14:48.160
 and it takes two seconds to go completely off the road.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.640
 So if you have one of these microsleeps at the wheel,

14:50.640 --> 14:52.600
 you know, it could be the last microsleep

14:52.600 --> 14:57.480
 that you ever have, but I don't now see it as a set of,

14:57.480 --> 15:00.440
 you know, very binary distinct, you know,

15:00.440 --> 15:04.480
 step function states, it's not a one or a zero.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.080
 I see it more of a, as a continuum.

15:07.080 --> 15:07.920
 Yeah.

15:07.920 --> 15:12.920
 So I've for five, six years at MIT

15:13.480 --> 15:17.720
 really focused on this human side of driving question.

15:17.720 --> 15:22.720
 And one of the big concerns is the microsleeps,

15:23.120 --> 15:25.320
 drowsiness, these kinds of ideas.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.080
 And one of the open questions was,

15:27.080 --> 15:29.920
 is it possible through computer vision to detect

15:29.920 --> 15:32.320
 or any kind of sensors?

15:32.320 --> 15:33.880
 The nice thing about computer vision

15:33.880 --> 15:36.880
 is you don't have to have direct contact to the person.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.760
 Is it possible to detect increases in drowsiness?

15:41.760 --> 15:44.160
 Is it possible to detect these kinds of microsleeps

15:44.160 --> 15:46.120
 or actually just sleep in general?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.280
 Among other things, like distraction,

15:49.280 --> 15:52.080
 these are all words that have so many meanings

15:52.080 --> 15:55.880
 and so many debates, like attention is a whole nother one,

15:55.880 --> 15:57.280
 just because you're looking at something

15:57.280 --> 16:00.160
 doesn't mean you're loading in the information.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.280
 Just because you're looking away

16:02.280 --> 16:04.360
 doesn't mean your peripheral vision can't pick up

16:04.360 --> 16:05.800
 the important information.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.880
 There's so many complicated vision science things there.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.960
 So I wonder if you could say something to,

16:13.160 --> 16:15.280
 they say the eyes are the windows to the soul.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.680
 Do you think the eyes can reveal something

16:19.680 --> 16:24.680
 about sleepiness through computer vision,

16:24.760 --> 16:27.600
 through just looking at the video of the face.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.240
 And Andrew Huberman and I, your friend,

16:30.240 --> 16:31.080
 have talked about this.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.520
 So we'd love to work on this together.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.360
 You should do.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.640
 It's a fascinating problem,

16:35.640 --> 16:37.200
 but drowsiness is a tricky one.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.320
 So there's what kind of information?

16:39.320 --> 16:42.680
 There's blinking and there's eye movement.

16:42.680 --> 16:46.000
 And those are the ones that can be picked up

16:46.000 --> 16:46.880
 with computer vision.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.960
 Do you think those are signals that can be used

16:48.960 --> 16:52.680
 to say something about where we are in this continuum?

16:52.680 --> 16:53.520
 Yeah, I do.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.600
 And I think there are a number of other features too.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.480
 I think aperture of eye,

16:59.480 --> 17:03.120
 so in other words, partial closures, full closures,

17:03.120 --> 17:04.760
 duration of those closures,

17:04.760 --> 17:08.080
 duration of those partial closures of the eyelid.

17:09.360 --> 17:13.360
 I think there may be some information in the pupil as well,

17:13.360 --> 17:16.400
 because as we're transitioning between those states,

17:16.400 --> 17:17.920
 there are changes in what's called

17:17.920 --> 17:19.280
 the automatic nervous system,

17:19.280 --> 17:22.800
 or technically it's called the autonomic nervous system,

17:22.800 --> 17:27.080
 part of which will control your pupillary size.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.880
 So I actually think that there is probably

17:29.880 --> 17:32.320
 a wealth of information.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.600
 When you combine that,

17:33.600 --> 17:38.600
 probably with aspects of steering angle, steering maneuver.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.520
 And if you can sense the pressure on the pedals as well,

17:44.520 --> 17:48.080
 my guess is that there is some combinatorial feature

17:48.080 --> 17:53.080
 that creates a phenotype of you are starting to fall asleep

17:53.080 --> 17:58.080
 and as the autonomous controls develop,

17:58.080 --> 18:00.480
 it's time for them to kick in.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.800
 Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers,

18:02.800 --> 18:05.680
 sort of have something beta version,

18:05.680 --> 18:07.920
 or maybe an alpha version of this,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.440
 already starting to come online

18:09.440 --> 18:11.960
 where they have a little camera in the wheel

18:11.960 --> 18:14.560
 that I think tries to look at some features.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.760
 Almost everybody doing this and it's very alpha.

18:17.760 --> 18:22.760
 So the thing that you currently have

18:23.200 --> 18:24.400
 and some people have that in their car,

18:24.400 --> 18:26.480
 there's a coffee cup or something that comes up

18:26.480 --> 18:28.000
 that you might be sleepy.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.560
 The primary signal that they're comfortable using

18:31.560 --> 18:33.400
 is steering wheel reversals.

18:33.400 --> 18:37.440
 So basically using your interaction with the steering wheel

18:37.440 --> 18:39.720
 and how much you're interacting with it

18:39.720 --> 18:40.920
 as a sign of sleepiness.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.600
 So if you have to constantly correct the car,

18:43.600 --> 18:47.360
 that's a sign of you starting to drift into microsleep.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.520
 I think that's a very, very crude signal.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.160
 It's probably a powerful one.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.760
 There's a whole nother component to this,

18:52.760 --> 18:56.760
 which is it seems like it's so driver and subject dependent.

18:59.240 --> 19:04.240
 How our behavior changes as we get sleepy and drowsy

19:04.240 --> 19:08.160
 seems to be different in complicated, fascinating ways

19:08.160 --> 19:09.800
 where you can't just use one signal.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.120
 It's kind of like what you're saying.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.560
 There has to be a lot of different signals

19:13.560 --> 19:15.400
 that you should then be able to combine.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.760
 The hope is the search is for universal signals

19:19.760 --> 19:23.560
 that are pretty damn good for 90% of people.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.240
 But I don't think we need to take necessarily

19:26.240 --> 19:27.240
 quite that approach.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.120
 I think what we could do in some clever fashion

19:31.120 --> 19:33.520
 is using the individual.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.640
 So what you and I are perhaps suggesting here

19:35.640 --> 19:39.440
 is that there is an array of features that we know

19:39.440 --> 19:42.080
 provide information that is sensitive

19:42.080 --> 19:44.560
 to whether or not you're falling asleep at the wheel.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.920
 Some of those, let's say that there are 10 of them.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.840
 For me, seven of them are the cardinal features.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.560
 For you, however, six of them,

19:54.560 --> 19:58.080
 and they're not all the same sort of overlapping,

19:58.080 --> 19:59.960
 are those for you.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.880
 I think what we need is algorithms

20:01.880 --> 20:04.480
 that can firstly understand when you are well slept.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.960
 So let's say that people have sleep trackers at night

20:06.960 --> 20:09.240
 and then your car integrates that information.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.640
 And it understands when you are well slept.

20:12.640 --> 20:16.640
 And then you've got the data of the individual behavior

20:16.640 --> 20:19.440
 unique to that individual snowflake like

20:20.320 --> 20:21.880
 when they are well slept.

20:21.880 --> 20:26.520
 This is the signature of well rested driving.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.200
 Then you can look at deviations from that

20:29.200 --> 20:32.200
 and pattern match it with the sleep history

20:32.200 --> 20:33.680
 of that individual.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.440
 And then I don't need to find the sort of,

20:37.440 --> 20:41.040
 the one size fits all approach for 99% of the people.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.400
 I can create a very bespoke, tailor like set of features

20:45.400 --> 20:49.760
 of a Savile Row suit of sleepiness features.

20:49.760 --> 20:50.600
 That would be my,

20:50.600 --> 20:53.520
 if you want to ask me about moonshots and crazy ideas,

20:53.520 --> 20:54.360
 that's where I go.

20:54.360 --> 20:58.160
 But to start with, I think your approach is a great one.

20:58.160 --> 21:02.080
 Let's find something that covers 99% of the people.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.720
 Because the worrying thing about microsleeps, of course,

21:04.720 --> 21:07.400
 unlike drugs or alcohol,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.320
 which certainly is a terrible thing

21:10.320 --> 21:11.920
 to be behind the wheel.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.920
 With those, often you react too late.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.160
 And that's the reason you get into an accident.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.800
 When you fall asleep behind the wheel,

21:22.800 --> 21:24.240
 you don't react at all.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.640
 At that point, there is a two ton missile

21:27.640 --> 21:29.920
 driving down the street and no one's in control.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.400
 That's why those accidents can often be more dangerous.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.320
 Yeah, and the fascinating thing is,

21:37.320 --> 21:39.400
 in the case of semi autonomous vehicles

21:39.400 --> 21:40.920
 like Tesla autopilot,

21:40.920 --> 21:44.680
 this is where I've had disagreements with Mr. Elon Musk.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.000
 And the human factors community,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.680
 which is this community that one of the big things they study

21:53.680 --> 21:56.760
 is human supervision over automation.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.640
 So you have like pilots supervising an airplane

22:00.640 --> 22:02.720
 that's mostly flying autonomously.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.720
 The question is, when we're actually doing the driving,

22:06.720 --> 22:09.880
 how do microsleeps are general?

22:09.880 --> 22:12.120
 How does drowsiness progress?

22:12.120 --> 22:14.040
 And how does it affect our driving?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.920
 That question becomes more fascinating,

22:15.920 --> 22:19.560
 more complicated when your task is not driving,

22:19.560 --> 22:21.640
 but supervising the driving.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.800
 So your task is to take over when stuff goes wrong.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.160
 And that is complicated,

22:27.160 --> 22:30.280
 but the basic conclusions from many decades

22:30.280 --> 22:34.320
 is that humans are really crappy at supervising

22:34.320 --> 22:39.320
 because they get drowsy and lose vigilance much, much faster.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.280
 The really surprising thing with Tesla autopilot,

22:42.280 --> 22:44.520
 it was surprising to me,

22:44.520 --> 22:47.040
 surprising to the human factors community,

22:47.040 --> 22:49.360
 and in fact, they still argue with me about it,

22:49.360 --> 22:54.360
 is it seems that humans in Teslas with autopilot

22:55.280 --> 22:58.800
 and other similar systems are not becoming less vigilant,

22:58.800 --> 23:01.640
 at least with the studies we've done.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.360
 So there's something about the urgency of driving.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.240
 I can't, I'm not sure the why,

23:07.240 --> 23:08.920
 but there's something about the risk.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.840
 I think the fact that you might die

23:11.880 --> 23:14.480
 is still keeping people awake.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.560
 The question is, as Tesla autopilot

23:16.560 --> 23:19.440
 or similar systems get better and better and better,

23:19.440 --> 23:21.720
 how does that affect increasing drowsiness?

23:21.720 --> 23:23.280
 And that's when you need to have,

23:23.280 --> 23:25.400
 that's where the big disagreement was,

23:25.400 --> 23:27.360
 you need to have driver sensing,

23:27.360 --> 23:32.040
 meaning driver facing camera that tracks

23:32.040 --> 23:33.720
 some kind of information about the face

23:33.720 --> 23:36.120
 that can tell you drowsiness.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.040
 So you can tell the car if you're drowsy

23:39.040 --> 23:40.280
 so that the car can be like,

23:40.280 --> 23:43.960
 you should be probably driving or pull to the side.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.480
 Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.560
 Yeah, so there needs to be that dance

23:49.560 --> 23:53.720
 of interaction of human and machine,

23:53.720 --> 23:56.880
 but currently it's mostly steering wheel based.

23:56.880 --> 24:01.880
 So, this idea that your hands should be on the steering wheel,

24:02.400 --> 24:05.840
 that's a sign that you're paying attention

24:05.840 --> 24:09.440
 is an outdated and a very crude metric.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.240
 I agree, yeah.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.360
 I think there are far more sophisticated ways

24:13.360 --> 24:17.200
 that we can solve that problem if we invest.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.600
 Can I ask you a big philosophical question

24:20.600 --> 24:23.000
 before we get into fun details?

24:23.000 --> 24:26.600
 On the topic of conscious states,

24:28.400 --> 24:31.240
 how fundamental do you think is consciousness

24:31.240 --> 24:33.400
 to the human mind?

24:33.400 --> 24:36.440
 I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.080
 So in your study of sleep,

24:39.080 --> 24:42.120
 do you think the hard question of consciousness,

24:42.120 --> 24:45.400
 that it feels like something to be us,

24:45.400 --> 24:46.920
 is that like a nice little feature,

24:46.920 --> 24:50.280
 like a quirk of our mind,

24:50.280 --> 24:52.040
 or is it some how fundamental?

24:52.040 --> 24:55.840
 Because sleep feels like we take a step out

24:55.840 --> 24:57.800
 of that consciousness a little bit.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.600
 So from all your study of sleep,

25:00.600 --> 25:04.320
 do you think consciousness is deeply part of who we are,

25:04.320 --> 25:05.880
 or is it just a nice trick?

25:06.960 --> 25:09.680
 I think it's a deeply embedded feature

25:09.680 --> 25:14.680
 that I can imagine has a whole panoply of biological benefits.

25:16.120 --> 25:17.760
 But to your point about sleep,

25:17.760 --> 25:20.960
 what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research

25:20.960 --> 25:25.960
 and we've done some, it's very, very rare at all,

25:27.280 --> 25:31.200
 in fact, for you to end up becoming someone

25:31.200 --> 25:33.440
 other than who you are in your dreams.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.960
 Now, you can have third person perspective dreams

25:35.960 --> 25:38.760
 where you can see yourself in the dream

25:38.760 --> 25:43.760
 as if you've risen above your physical being.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.280
 But for the most part, it's very rare

25:47.280 --> 25:51.400
 that we lose our sense of conscious self.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.720
 And maybe I'm sort of doing a sleight of hand

25:53.720 --> 25:55.600
 because it's really what I'm saying is it's very rare

25:55.600 --> 25:58.720
 that we lose our sense of who we are in dreams.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.960
 We never do.

25:59.960 --> 26:04.400
 Now, that's not to suggest that dreams aren't utterly bizarre.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.800
 And I mean, when you slept last night,

26:07.800 --> 26:12.080
 which I know may have been perhaps a little less than me,

26:12.080 --> 26:14.760
 but when you went into dreaming,

26:14.760 --> 26:18.240
 you became flagrantly psychotic

26:18.240 --> 26:20.480
 and there are five essentially good reasons.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.520
 Firstly, you started to see things which were not there.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.240
 So you were hallucinating.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.320
 Second, you believe things that couldn't possibly be true.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.200
 So you were delusional.

26:30.200 --> 26:35.200
 Third, you became confused about time and place and person.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.600
 So you're suffering from what we would call disorientation.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.680
 Fourth, you have wildly fluctuating emotions,

26:41.680 --> 26:46.480
 something that psychiatrists will call being affectively labile.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.560
 And then how wonderful you woke up this morning

26:48.560 --> 26:51.120
 and you forgot most if not all of that dream experience.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.840
 So you're suffering from amnesia.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.920
 If you had to experience any one of those five things

26:55.920 --> 26:57.000
 while you were awake,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.600
 you would probably be seeking psychological help.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.920
 But so I placed that as a backdrop

27:03.920 --> 27:06.160
 against your astute question

27:06.160 --> 27:11.080
 because despite all of that psychosis,

27:11.080 --> 27:16.080
 there is still a present self nested at the heart of it,

27:16.200 --> 27:19.800
 meaning that I think it's very difficult for us

27:19.800 --> 27:24.160
 to abandon our conscious sense of self.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.920
 And if it's that hard,

27:25.920 --> 27:27.200
 the old adage in some ways

27:27.200 --> 27:29.280
 that you can't outrun your shadow,

27:29.280 --> 27:31.440
 but here it's more of a philosophical question

27:31.440 --> 27:33.680
 which is about the conscious mind

27:33.680 --> 27:36.240
 and what the state of consciousness actually means

27:36.240 --> 27:38.120
 in a human being.

27:38.120 --> 27:43.120
 So I think that that to me, you become so dislocated

27:43.720 --> 27:47.880
 from so many other rational ways of waking consciousness.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.560
 But one thing that won't go away,

27:49.560 --> 27:54.560
 that won't get perturbed or sort of, you know,

27:54.680 --> 27:58.200
 manacled, is this your sense of conscious self?

27:58.200 --> 28:00.160
 Yeah, that's a strong sign that consciousness

28:00.160 --> 28:02.400
 is fundamental to the human mind.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.920
 Or we're just creatures of habit

28:04.920 --> 28:06.880
 who got used to having consciousness.

28:06.880 --> 28:11.120
 Maybe it just takes a lot of either chemical substances

28:11.120 --> 28:16.000
 or a lot of like mental work to escape that.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.360
 I mean, it's like trying to launch a rocket.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.120
 You know, the energy that has to be put in

28:22.120 --> 28:24.640
 to create escape velocity

28:24.640 --> 28:26.680
 from the gravitational pull of this thing

28:26.680 --> 28:29.120
 called planet Earth is immense.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.160
 Well, the same thing is true

28:31.160 --> 28:36.160
 for us to abandon our sense of conscious self.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.400
 Self, the amount of biological amount of substances,

28:39.400 --> 28:42.080
 the amount of wacky stuff that you have to do

28:42.080 --> 28:46.440
 to truly get escape velocity from your conscious self.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.440
 What does that tell us about then

28:48.440 --> 28:52.280
 the fundamental state of our conscious self?

28:52.280 --> 28:55.600
 Yeah, it also probably says that it's quite useful

28:55.600 --> 28:58.720
 to have consciousness for survival

28:58.720 --> 29:01.480
 and for just operation in this world.

29:01.480 --> 29:02.840
 And perhaps for intelligence.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.040
 I'm one of the, on the AI side,

29:05.040 --> 29:10.040
 people that think that intelligence requires consciousness.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.000
 So like high levels of general intelligence

29:13.000 --> 29:14.480
 requires consciousness.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.760
 Most people in the AI field think like consciousness

29:17.760 --> 29:19.640
 and intelligence are fundamentally different.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.160
 You could build a computer that's super intelligent.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.880
 It doesn't have to be conscious.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.680
 I think that if you define super intelligence

29:26.680 --> 29:28.640
 by being good at chess, yes.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.880
 But if you define super intelligence

29:30.880 --> 29:33.840
 as being able to operate in this living world

29:33.840 --> 29:36.320
 of humans and be able to perform

29:36.320 --> 29:39.240
 all kinds of different tasks, consciousness,

29:39.240 --> 29:41.800
 it seems to be some all fundamental

29:41.800 --> 29:46.800
 to richly integrate yourself into the human experience

29:46.840 --> 29:48.360
 into society.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.000
 It feels like you have to be a conscious being.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.480
 But then we don't even know what consciousness is.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.680
 And we certainly don't know how to engineer it

29:55.680 --> 29:56.720
 in our machines.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.160
 I love the fact that there are still questions

30:00.160 --> 30:02.120
 that are so embryonic

30:02.120 --> 30:05.640
 because I suspect it's the same with you.

30:05.640 --> 30:10.040
 Answers to me are simply ways to get to more questions.

30:10.040 --> 30:15.040
 It's questions where, questions turn me on, answers less so.

30:15.040 --> 30:18.880
 And I love the fact that we are still embryonic

30:18.880 --> 30:20.960
 in our sense of arguing about

30:20.960 --> 30:23.840
 even what the definition of consciousness is.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.400
 But I also find it fascinating.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.720
 I think it's thoroughly delightful

30:27.720 --> 30:30.160
 to absorb yourself in the thought.

30:30.160 --> 30:33.800
 Think about the brain and we can move back

30:33.800 --> 30:35.960
 across the complexity of phylogeny

30:35.960 --> 30:40.960
 from humans to mammals to birds to reptiles, amphibians, fish.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.920
 You can bacteria, whatever you want.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.080
 And you can go through this and say,

30:46.080 --> 30:47.960
 okay, where is the hard line

30:47.960 --> 30:51.240
 of what we would define as consciousness?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.800
 And I'm sure it's got something to do

30:52.800 --> 30:55.320
 with the complexity of the neural system.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.560
 Of that, I'm fairly certain.

30:57.560 --> 31:01.360
 But to me, it's always been fascinating.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.640
 So what is it then?

31:02.640 --> 31:06.080
 Is it that I just keep adding neurons to a Petri dish

31:06.080 --> 31:08.200
 and I just keep adding them and adding them and adding them.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.240
 At some point when I hit a critical mass

31:10.240 --> 31:11.840
 of interconnected neurons,

31:11.840 --> 31:15.160
 that is the mass of the interconnected human brain,

31:15.160 --> 31:16.200
 then bingo.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.760
 All of a sudden it kicks into gear

31:19.760 --> 31:21.320
 and we have consciousness.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.560
 Like a phase shift, phase transition of some kind.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.480
 Correct, yeah.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.240
 But there is something about the complexity

31:26.240 --> 31:28.640
 of the nervous system that I think is fundamental

31:28.640 --> 31:30.320
 to consciousness and the reason I bring that up

31:30.320 --> 31:32.480
 is because when we're trying to then think

31:32.480 --> 31:35.200
 about creating it in an artificial way,

31:35.200 --> 31:37.680
 does that inform us as to the complexity

31:37.680 --> 31:41.240
 that we should be looking at in terms of development?

31:41.240 --> 31:44.400
 I also think that it's a missed opportunity

31:44.400 --> 31:48.240
 in the sort of digital space

31:48.240 --> 31:51.320
 for us to try to recreate human consciousness.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.640
 We've already got human consciousness.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.480
 What if we were to think about

31:56.480 --> 31:58.720
 creating some other form of,

31:58.720 --> 32:01.560
 why do we have to think that the ultimate

32:01.560 --> 32:05.680
 in the creation of an artificial intelligence

32:05.680 --> 32:10.680
 is the replication of a human state of consciousness?

32:11.840 --> 32:16.600
 Can we not think outside of our own consciousness

32:16.600 --> 32:19.280
 and believe that there is something even more incredible

32:19.280 --> 32:22.320
 or more complimentary, more orthogonal?

32:22.320 --> 32:23.160
 Mm hmm.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.880
 So I'm sometimes perplexed

32:26.880 --> 32:30.560
 that people are trying to mimic human consciousness

32:30.560 --> 32:34.520
 rather than think about creating something that's different.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.600
 So yeah, I think of human consciousness

32:36.600 --> 32:38.880
 or consciousness in general as this magic

32:41.000 --> 32:44.760
 superpower that allows us to deeply experience the world.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.840
 And just as you're saying,

32:45.840 --> 32:47.720
 I don't think that superpower has to take

32:47.720 --> 32:49.800
 the exact flavor as humans have.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.880
 That's my love for robots.

32:51.880 --> 32:56.200
 I would love to add the ability to robots

32:56.200 --> 33:01.200
 that can experience the world and other humans deeply.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.040
 I'm humbled by the fact that that idea

33:04.040 --> 33:06.960
 does not necessarily need to look anything like

33:06.960 --> 33:09.320
 how humans experience the world.

33:09.320 --> 33:14.320
 But there's a dance of human to robot connection,

33:14.800 --> 33:18.520
 the same way human to dog or human to cat connection.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.880
 There's a magic there to that interaction.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.600
 And I'm not sure how to create that magic,

33:23.600 --> 33:25.120
 but it's a worthy effort.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.960
 I also love just exactly as you said,

33:27.960 --> 33:29.440
 on the question of consciousness

33:29.440 --> 33:31.080
 or engineering consciousness,

33:32.080 --> 33:34.000
 the fun thing about this problem

33:34.920 --> 33:38.800
 is it seems obvious to me that 100 years from now,

33:38.800 --> 33:41.280
 no matter what we do today,

33:41.280 --> 33:44.920
 people who are still here will laugh

33:44.920 --> 33:47.280
 at how silly our notions were.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.880
 So it's almost impossible for me to imagine

33:49.880 --> 33:54.880
 that we will truly solve this problem fully in my lifetime.

33:56.320 --> 34:00.080
 And more than that, everything we'll do

34:00.080 --> 34:02.600
 will be silly 100 years from now.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.600
 But that makes it fun to me

34:05.600 --> 34:07.920
 because it's like you have the full freedom

34:07.920 --> 34:12.920
 to not even be right, just to try, just to try as freedom.

34:12.920 --> 34:17.560
 And that's how I see it. Get me that T shirt, please.

34:17.560 --> 34:18.480
 I love that.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.880
 So, and, you know, human robot interaction is fascinating

34:21.880 --> 34:24.040
 because it's like watching dancing.

34:24.040 --> 34:28.160
 I've been dancing tango recently.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.920
 And just, it's like, there is no goal.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.640
 The goal is to create something magical.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.440
 And whether consciousness or emotion

34:37.440 --> 34:40.160
 or elegance of movement, all of those things

34:40.160 --> 34:43.400
 aid in the creation of the magic.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.080
 And it's a free, it's an art form to explore

34:46.080 --> 34:49.920
 how to make that, how to create that

34:49.920 --> 34:51.280
 in a way that's compelling.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.440
 Yeah, I love the line in Sense of a Woman with Al Pacino

34:54.440 --> 34:56.000
 where he's speaking about the tango

34:56.000 --> 34:57.720
 and he said, really, it's just freedom

34:57.720 --> 35:01.880
 that if you get tangled up, you just keep tangoing on.

35:01.880 --> 35:06.400
 I still to this day, I think first or second time

35:06.400 --> 35:08.880
 I talked to Joe Rogan on his podcast,

35:08.880 --> 35:11.520
 I said, we got into this heated argument

35:11.520 --> 35:14.640
 about whether Sense of a Woman is a better movie

35:14.640 --> 35:15.560
 than John Wick.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.320
 Because it's one of my favorite movies for many reasons.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.960
 One is Sense of a Woman.

35:21.960 --> 35:22.920
 Sense of a Woman.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.680
 Partially.

35:24.680 --> 35:25.520
 I didn't know that, by the way.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.800
 It was just, you just,

35:26.800 --> 35:28.960
 Yeah, I didn't know if you would actually know of the movie.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.800
 Awesome, awesome.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.920
 Yeah, yeah, I said, I love the tango scene.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.680
 I love Al Pacino's performance.

35:34.680 --> 35:35.840
 It's a wonderful movie.

35:35.840 --> 35:39.360
 Then Joe was saying, John Wick is better.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.440
 So we to this day argue about this.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.920
 I think it depends on what conscious state you're in

35:44.920 --> 35:46.960
 that you would be ready and receptive to.

35:46.960 --> 35:51.240
 But Sense of a Woman, I think it has one of the best monologues

35:51.240 --> 35:54.520
 at the end of the movie that has ever been written

35:54.520 --> 35:57.000
 or at least performed.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.920
 When Al Pacino defends the younger.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.880
 Yeah, I often think about that.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.080
 There's been times in my life,

36:08.080 --> 36:09.920
 I don't know about you,

36:09.920 --> 36:12.520
 where I wish I had an Al Pacino in my life.

36:12.520 --> 36:17.520
 Where integrity is really important in this life.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.040
 It is.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.720
 And sometimes you find yourself in places

36:20.720 --> 36:25.520
 where there's pressure to sacrifice that integrity.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.240
 And you want, what is it?

36:28.240 --> 36:33.240
 Lieutenant Colonel or whatever he was to come in on your side

36:34.760 --> 36:36.360
 and scream at everyone and say,

36:36.360 --> 36:38.480
 what the hell are we doing here?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.680
 Being, you know, unfortunately,

36:40.680 --> 36:44.320
 British instead of having that slightly awkward,

36:44.320 --> 36:45.360
 sort of huge grand gene,

36:45.360 --> 36:48.760
 it's very at the opposite end of the spectrum

36:48.760 --> 36:53.040
 of the remarkable feat of Al Pacino at the end of that scene.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.200
 But, and yeah, integrity is,

36:56.200 --> 37:00.320
 it's a challenging thing and I value it much.

37:00.320 --> 37:04.920
 And I think it can take 20 years to build a reputation

37:04.920 --> 37:06.600
 in two minutes to lose it.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.440
 And there is nothing more that I value than that integrity.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.560
 And, you know, if I'm ever wrong about anything,

37:13.560 --> 37:16.840
 I truly don't want to be wrong for any longer

37:16.840 --> 37:17.960
 than I have to be.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.680
 You know, that's what being in some ways a scientist is.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.440
 You're just driven by truth.

37:25.440 --> 37:29.200
 And the irony relative to something like mathematics

37:29.200 --> 37:31.880
 is that in science, you never find truth.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.880
 What all you do in science

37:33.880 --> 37:38.040
 is you discount the things that are likely to be untrue,

37:38.040 --> 37:42.240
 leaving only the possibility of what could be true.

37:42.240 --> 37:46.640
 But in math, you know, when you create, you know, a proof,

37:46.640 --> 37:51.640
 it's a proof for, you know, from that point forward,

37:51.800 --> 37:54.320
 there is truth in mathematics.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.000
 And I think there's a beauty in that.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.240
 But I kind of like the messiness of science

38:00.240 --> 38:04.600
 because again, to me, it's less about the truth of the answer

38:04.600 --> 38:07.240
 and it is more about the pursuit of questions.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.080
 But their integrity becomes more and more important

38:10.080 --> 38:11.800
 and it becomes more difficult.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.920
 There's a lot of pressure,

38:12.920 --> 38:14.080
 it's just like in the rest of the world,

38:14.080 --> 38:17.160
 but there's a lot of pressures on a scientist.

38:17.160 --> 38:19.440
 One is like funding sources.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.200
 I've noticed this that, you know, money affects

38:22.200 --> 38:24.560
 everyone's mind, I think.

38:24.560 --> 38:28.320
 I've been always somebody that I believe money can't,

38:28.320 --> 38:31.480
 you can't buy my opinion.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.360
 I don't care how much money, billions or trillions.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.000
 The, but that pressure is there

38:37.000 --> 38:38.760
 and you have to be very cognizant of it

38:38.760 --> 38:41.640
 and make sure that your opinion is not defined

38:41.640 --> 38:43.360
 by the funding sources.

38:43.360 --> 38:48.240
 And then the other is just your own success of, you know,

38:48.240 --> 38:53.880
 for a couple of decades publishing an idea

38:53.880 --> 38:55.440
 and then realizing at some point

38:55.440 --> 38:57.920
 that that idea was wrong all along.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.800
 And that's a tough thing for people to do.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.200
 But that's also integrity, is to walk away,

39:03.200 --> 39:06.320
 is to say that you were wrong.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.880
 That doesn't have to be in some big dramatic way.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.800
 It could be in a bunch of tiny ways along the way, right?

39:12.800 --> 39:15.480
 Like reconfigure your intuition

39:15.480 --> 39:18.800
 about a particular problem.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.520
 That's, and all of that is integrity.

39:20.520 --> 39:24.480
 When everybody in the room believes a certain thing,

39:24.480 --> 39:27.440
 everybody in the community believes a certain thing

39:27.440 --> 39:31.000
 to be able to still be open minded in the face of that.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.560
 Yeah, and I think it comes down

39:32.560 --> 39:35.360
 in some ways to the issue of ego,

39:35.360 --> 39:39.960
 that you bond your correctness or your rightness,

39:39.960 --> 39:45.840
 your scientific theory with your sense of ego.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.760
 You know, I've never found it that difficult

39:47.760 --> 39:52.800
 to let go of theories in the face of counter evidence,

39:52.800 --> 39:56.400
 in part because I have such low self esteem.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.680
 Well, I kind of like that.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.000
 I always liked that combination.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.600
 I have the same, I'm like very self critical,

40:01.600 --> 40:03.920
 imposter syndrome, all those things,

40:03.920 --> 40:05.760
 putting yourself below the podium,

40:05.760 --> 40:08.120
 but at the same time having the ego

40:08.120 --> 40:11.040
 that drives the ambition to work your ass off.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.520
 Like some kind of weird drive,

40:13.520 --> 40:16.760
 maybe like drive to be better.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.920
 Like thinking yourself is not that great

40:18.920 --> 40:20.960
 and always driving to be better.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.040
 And then at the same time,

40:22.040 --> 40:25.960
 because that can be paralyzing and exhausting and so on,

40:25.960 --> 40:28.360
 at the same time just being grateful to be alive.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.320
 But in the sciences, in the actual effort,

40:31.320 --> 40:33.960
 never be satisfied, never think of yourself highly.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.840
 That seems to be a nice combination.

40:35.840 --> 40:39.680
 I very much hope that that is part of who I am.

40:39.680 --> 40:44.400
 And I remain very quietly motivated and driven.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.960
 And I, like you, love the idea of perfection

40:47.960 --> 40:49.680
 and I know I will never achieve it,

40:49.680 --> 40:52.200
 but I will never stop trying to.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.480
 So similar to you, which sounds weird

40:55.480 --> 40:59.360
 because there's all these videos of me on the internet.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.360
 So I think I just naturally lean into the things

41:04.360 --> 41:07.200
 I'm afraid of and I'm uncomfortable doing.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.040
 Like I'm very afraid of talking to people

41:09.040 --> 41:12.640
 and just even before talking to you today,

41:12.640 --> 41:16.040
 just a lot of anxiety and all those kinds of things.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.480
 How about talking to me?

41:17.480 --> 41:18.320
 Yeah, yeah.

41:18.320 --> 41:22.480
 Oh, like nervousness, fear in some cases,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.480
 self doubt and all those kinds of things.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.920
 But I do it anyway.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.920
 So the reason I bring that up is you've launched a podcast.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.040
 I have. Allow me to say,

41:34.040 --> 41:36.200
 I think you're a great science communicator.

41:36.200 --> 41:43.200
 So this challenge of being afraid

41:43.200 --> 41:46.880
 or cautious of being in the public eye

41:46.880 --> 41:50.280
 and yet having a longing to communicate

41:50.280 --> 41:52.440
 some of the things you're excited about

41:52.440 --> 41:54.720
 in the space of sleep and beyond.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.960
 What's your vision with this project?

41:56.960 --> 42:01.960
 With this project, I think firstly to that question,

42:02.800 --> 42:07.800
 like you, I am always more afraid of not trying and trying.

42:07.960 --> 42:11.040
 Yeah, that to me frightens me more.

42:12.040 --> 42:16.000
 But with the podcast, I think really,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.640
 I have two very simple goals.

42:18.640 --> 42:23.000
 I want to try and democratize the science of sleep.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
 And in doing so, my goal would be to try

42:25.000 --> 42:27.080
 and reunite humanity with the sleep

42:27.080 --> 42:29.240
 that it is so desperately bereft of.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.840
 And if I can do that through a number of different means,

42:35.520 --> 42:38.520
 the podcast is a little bit different than this format.

42:38.520 --> 42:43.520
 It's going to be short form monologues from yours truly.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.800
 That will last usually less than just 10 minutes.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.440
 And I see it as simply a little slice of sleep goodness

42:51.440 --> 42:53.960
 that can accompany your waking day.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.400
 It's hard to know what is the right way

42:56.400 --> 42:58.440
 to do science communication.

42:58.440 --> 43:03.440
 Like your friend, mine, Andrew Huberman is does,

43:03.680 --> 43:05.480
 he's an incredible human being.

43:05.480 --> 43:06.320
 Oh gosh.

43:06.320 --> 43:09.440
 So he does like two hours of,

43:09.440 --> 43:10.680
 I wonder how many takes he does.

43:10.680 --> 43:12.840
 I don't know, but it looks like he doesn't do any.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.280
 Yeah, I suspect he's that magnificent of a human being.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.920
 When I talk to him in person,

43:18.920 --> 43:21.600
 he always generates intelligent words,

43:21.600 --> 43:24.200
 well cited nonstop for hours.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.720
 So I don't...

43:25.720 --> 43:29.040
 He's a Gatlin gun of information and it's pristine.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.720
 And passion and all those kinds of things.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.280
 So that's an interesting medium.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.760
 I wouldn't have, it's funny

43:35.760 --> 43:38.040
 because I wouldn't have done it the way he's doing it.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.360
 I wouldn't advise him to do it the way he's doing it.

43:40.360 --> 43:43.840
 Cause I thought there's no way you could do what you're doing.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.520
 Cause it's a lot of work,

43:45.520 --> 43:48.440
 but he is like doing an incredible job of it.

43:48.440 --> 43:51.080
 I just think it's the same with like Dan Carlin

43:51.080 --> 43:52.160
 in hardcore history.

43:52.160 --> 43:56.680
 I thought that the way Andrew is doing it

43:56.680 --> 44:00.840
 would crush him the way it crushes Dan Carlin.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.680
 So Dan has so much pressure on him to do a good job

44:04.680 --> 44:08.120
 that he ends up publishing like two episodes a year.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.080
 So that pressure can be paralyzing,

44:10.080 --> 44:13.560
 the pressure of like putting out like

44:13.560 --> 44:17.840
 strong scientific statements that that can be overwhelming.

44:17.840 --> 44:21.560
 Now Andrew seems to be just plowing through anyway.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.240
 If there's mistakes, he'll,

44:23.240 --> 44:25.240
 he'll say there's corrections and so on.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.240
 I just, I wonder,

44:26.240 --> 44:28.920
 I actually haven't talked too much about it like psychologically.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.000
 How difficult is it to put yourself out there

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
 for an hour to a week of just nonstop dropping knowledge.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.160
 Any one sentence of which could be totally wrong.

44:41.160 --> 44:42.240
 It could be a mistake.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.520
 And there will be mistakes, you know?

44:44.520 --> 44:47.440
 And I, you know, in the first edition of my book,

44:47.440 --> 44:49.360
 there were errors that, you know,

44:49.360 --> 44:51.480
 we corrected in the second edition too,

44:52.400 --> 44:55.840
 but there will be probabilistically, you know,

44:55.840 --> 44:59.080
 if you've got, you know, 10 facts per page of a book

44:59.080 --> 45:02.440
 and you've got 350 pages,

45:02.440 --> 45:05.240
 odds are it's probably not going to be

45:05.240 --> 45:07.400
 utter perfection out the gate.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.800
 And it will be the same way for Andrew too.

45:11.720 --> 45:15.600
 But having the, the reverence of

45:15.600 --> 45:19.400
 a humble mind

45:19.400 --> 45:22.000
 and simply accepting the things that are wrong

45:22.000 --> 45:23.920
 and correcting them and doing the right thing.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.640
 I know that that's his mentality.

45:26.640 --> 45:30.280
 I do want to say that I'm just kind of honored to be,

45:30.280 --> 45:34.800
 it's like, it's a cool group of like scientific people

45:34.800 --> 45:37.880
 that I'm fortunate enough to now be interacting with.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.200
 It's you and Andrew and David Sinclair

45:41.200 --> 45:43.120
 has been thinking about throwing his hat in the ring.

45:43.120 --> 45:43.960
 Oh, I hope so.

45:43.960 --> 45:47.320
 It is another one of those very special people in the world.

45:47.320 --> 45:51.080
 So it's cool because podcasts are, it's cool.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.440
 It's a, it's such a powerful medium of communication.

45:53.440 --> 45:56.520
 It's much freer than more constrained

45:56.520 --> 45:58.400
 like publications and so on.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.840
 Or it's much more accessible and inspiring than like,

46:01.840 --> 46:04.000
 I don't know, conference presentations or lectures.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.880
 And so it's a really exciting medium to me.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.840
 And it's cool that there's this like group of people

46:08.840 --> 46:12.720
 that are becoming friends and putting stuff out there

46:12.720 --> 46:13.640
 and supporting each other.

46:13.640 --> 46:16.800
 So it's fun to also watch

46:16.800 --> 46:18.960
 how that's going to evolve in your case.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.840
 Cause it will wonder, it'll be too among.

46:20.840 --> 46:24.960
 Oh, Dival, I think is the answer to that.

46:24.960 --> 46:27.720
 Well, I mean, some of it is persistence

46:27.720 --> 46:30.240
 through the challenges that we've been talking about,

46:30.240 --> 46:31.240
 which is like,

46:31.240 --> 46:32.440
 I think I've got a lot to learn.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.280
 Yeah.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.120
 But I will persist.

46:35.720 --> 46:38.080
 Can I ask you some detailed stuff you mentioned?

46:38.080 --> 46:41.600
 Oh my goodness, go anywhere you wish with sleep.

46:41.600 --> 46:45.280
 So I'm a big fan of coffee and caffeine.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.800
 And I've been, especially in the last few days,

46:47.800 --> 46:50.160
 consuming a very large amount.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.360
 And I'm cognizant of the fact that

46:54.280 --> 46:56.280
 my body is affected by caffeine

46:56.280 --> 46:59.000
 different than the anecdotal information

46:59.000 --> 47:00.760
 that other people tell me.

47:00.760 --> 47:03.920
 I seem to be not at all affected by it.

47:03.920 --> 47:04.760
 It's almost,

47:06.520 --> 47:09.280
 it feels like more like a ritual

47:09.280 --> 47:12.120
 than it is a chemical boost to my performance.

47:12.120 --> 47:15.400
 Like I can drink several cups of coffee right before bed

47:15.400 --> 47:17.720
 and just knock out anyway.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.200
 I'm not sure if it's biological chemical

47:20.200 --> 47:21.520
 or it has to do with just the fact

47:21.520 --> 47:24.320
 that I'm consuming huge amounts of caffeine.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.680
 All that to say,

47:28.160 --> 47:29.520
 what do you think is the relationship

47:29.520 --> 47:32.880
 between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.400
 If there's an interesting distinction there.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.640
 There is a distinction.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.560
 So I think the first thing to say,

47:37.560 --> 47:40.160
 which is going to sound strange coming from me

47:40.160 --> 47:41.600
 is drink coffee.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.440
 The health benefits associated with drinking coffee

47:46.440 --> 47:49.760
 are really quite well established now.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.160
 But I think that the counterpoint to that,

47:54.160 --> 47:57.840
 well firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison

47:57.840 --> 48:01.200
 and I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second.

48:01.200 --> 48:06.200
 But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine.

48:06.200 --> 48:09.360
 So a lot of people have asked me

48:09.360 --> 48:12.640
 about this rightful paradox between the fact that sleep

48:12.640 --> 48:15.360
 provides all of these incredible health benefits

48:15.360 --> 48:19.200
 and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact

48:19.200 --> 48:22.920
 on your sleep, has a whole collection of health benefits.

48:22.920 --> 48:25.760
 Many of them, Venn diagram overlapping with those

48:25.760 --> 48:30.000
 that sleep provides, how on earth can you reconcile those two?

48:30.000 --> 48:33.640
 And the answer is that, well, the answer is very simple.

48:33.640 --> 48:37.760
 The answer is very simple, it's called antioxidants.

48:37.760 --> 48:41.800
 That it turns out that for most people in Western civilization

48:41.800 --> 48:44.920
 because of diet not being quite what it should be,

48:45.800 --> 48:50.160
 the major source through which they obtain antioxidants

48:50.160 --> 48:51.280
 is the coffee bean.

48:51.280 --> 48:55.440
 So the humble coffee bean has now been asked to carry

48:55.440 --> 49:00.320
 the astronomical weight of serving up the large majority

49:00.320 --> 49:02.800
 of people's antioxidant needs.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.480
 And you can see this if, for example,

49:05.480 --> 49:09.080
 you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee,

49:09.080 --> 49:10.920
 it has a whole constellation

49:10.920 --> 49:12.840
 of really great health benefits too.

49:12.840 --> 49:15.080
 So it's not the caffeine, and that's why I liked

49:15.080 --> 49:17.880
 what you said, this sort of separation of church

49:17.880 --> 49:20.640
 and state between coffee and caffeine.

49:20.640 --> 49:24.080
 It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee bean itself

49:24.080 --> 49:25.600
 that provides those health benefits.

49:25.600 --> 49:30.320
 But coming back to how it impacts sleep,

49:30.320 --> 49:34.080
 it impacts sleeping probably at least three different ways.

49:34.080 --> 49:37.560
 The first is that for most people,

49:37.560 --> 49:39.960
 caffeine can make it obviously a little harder

49:39.960 --> 49:44.560
 to fall asleep, caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.600
 But let's say that you are one of those individuals

49:46.600 --> 49:48.560
 and I think you are, and you can say,

49:48.560 --> 49:51.240
 look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner

49:51.240 --> 49:52.800
 and I fall asleep just fine,

49:52.800 --> 49:55.000
 and I stay asleep soundly across the night,

49:55.000 --> 49:56.720
 so there's no problem.

49:56.720 --> 50:00.360
 The downside there is that even if that is true,

50:00.360 --> 50:02.680
 the amount of deep sleep that you get

50:02.680 --> 50:05.240
 will not be as deep, and so you will actually lose

50:05.240 --> 50:08.520
 somewhere between 10 to 30% of your deep sleep

50:08.520 --> 50:11.320
 if you drink caffeine in the evening.

50:11.320 --> 50:14.880
 So to give you some context to drop your deep sleep

50:14.880 --> 50:19.320
 by let's say 20%, I'd probably have to age you by 15 years,

50:19.320 --> 50:22.560
 or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.960
 I think the fourth component that is perhaps less well

50:25.960 --> 50:28.880
 understood about coffee is its timing,

50:28.880 --> 50:30.640
 and that's why I was saying the timing and the dose

50:30.640 --> 50:32.920
 make the poison, the dose, by the way,

50:32.920 --> 50:35.840
 once you get past about three cups of coffee a day,

50:35.840 --> 50:38.440
 the health benefits actually start to turn down

50:38.440 --> 50:40.240
 in the opposite direction.

50:40.240 --> 50:42.000
 So there is a U shaped function,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.240
 it's sort of the Goldilocks syndrome,

50:44.240 --> 50:47.240
 not too little, not too much, just the right amount.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.720
 The second component is the timing though.

50:50.720 --> 50:55.280
 Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours,

50:55.280 --> 50:57.840
 meaning that after five to six hours,

50:57.840 --> 51:01.200
 50% of that on average for the average adult

51:01.200 --> 51:02.520
 is still in the system,

51:02.520 --> 51:06.080
 which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.320
 So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon,

51:08.320 --> 51:10.600
 a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating

51:10.600 --> 51:12.640
 in your brain at midnight.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.800
 So having a cup of coffee at noon,

51:14.800 --> 51:16.240
 one could argue is the equivalent

51:16.240 --> 51:18.080
 of tucking yourself into bed at midnight,

51:18.080 --> 51:19.600
 and before you turn the light out,

51:19.600 --> 51:22.240
 you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee.

51:22.240 --> 51:24.360
 But that doesn't still answer your question

51:24.360 --> 51:26.240
 as to why are you so immune?

51:26.240 --> 51:28.200
 So I'm someone who is actually unfortunately

51:28.200 --> 51:29.560
 very sensitive to caffeine.

51:29.560 --> 51:33.200
 And if I have, you know, even two cups of coffee

51:33.200 --> 51:37.280
 in the morning, I don't sleep as well that night.

51:37.280 --> 51:40.720
 And I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee,

51:40.720 --> 51:43.600
 I love the routine, I love the ritual.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.280
 I think I would love to be invested in it.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.680
 It's just terrible for my sleep.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.480
 So I switched to decaf.

51:49.480 --> 51:52.680
 There is a difference from one individual to the next,

51:52.680 --> 51:56.680
 and it's controlled by a set of liver enzymes

51:56.680 --> 52:00.760
 called cytochrome P450 enzymes.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.080
 And there is a particular gene

52:03.080 --> 52:06.680
 that if you have a different sort of version of this gene,

52:06.680 --> 52:11.600
 it's called CYP1A2.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.760
 That gene will determine the speed

52:14.760 --> 52:18.120
 of the clearance of caffeine from your system.

52:18.120 --> 52:20.320
 Some people will have a version of that gene

52:20.320 --> 52:23.080
 that is very effective and efficient

52:23.080 --> 52:24.720
 at clearing that caffeine.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.480
 And so their half life could be as short as two hours

52:28.480 --> 52:30.960
 rather than five to six hours.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.120
 Other people, hands up Matt Walker,

52:34.120 --> 52:35.720
 have a version of that gene

52:35.720 --> 52:40.400
 that is not very effective at clearing out the caffeine.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.720
 And therefore their half life sort of sensitivity

52:43.720 --> 52:48.160
 could be somewhere between, you know, eight to nine hours.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.760
 So we understand that there are individual differences,

52:50.760 --> 52:55.760
 but overall I guess the top line here is drink coffee

52:56.600 --> 52:58.440
 and understand that it's not the caffeine,

52:58.440 --> 53:00.080
 it's the coffee that's the benefit

53:00.080 --> 53:01.320
 and the dose makes the poison.

53:01.320 --> 53:04.880
 Is there some aspect to it that it's like a muscle

53:04.880 --> 53:07.800
 in terms of all the combination of letters

53:07.800 --> 53:09.080
 and numbers that you just said?

53:09.080 --> 53:13.880
 Is there some aspect that if I can improve

53:13.880 --> 53:15.760
 the quarter life, the half life,

53:15.760 --> 53:19.120
 I could decrease that number if I just practice.

53:19.120 --> 53:22.680
 Like I drink a lot of coffee, it's just like habit,

53:22.680 --> 53:27.200
 it alters how your body's able to get rid of the caffeine.

53:27.200 --> 53:30.200
 Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine,

53:30.200 --> 53:34.560
 but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine.

53:34.560 --> 53:38.840
 And it's not at the level of the enzyme degrading the caffeine,

53:38.840 --> 53:41.560
 it's at the level of the receptors

53:41.560 --> 53:44.200
 that caffeine will act upon.

53:44.200 --> 53:47.040
 Now it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors

53:47.040 --> 53:49.160
 and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is

53:49.160 --> 53:51.240
 and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff.

53:51.240 --> 53:55.320
 But as you start to drink more and more coffee,

53:56.400 --> 53:59.040
 the body tries to fight back

53:59.040 --> 54:01.160
 and it happens with many different drugs by the way

54:01.160 --> 54:03.200
 and it's called tolerance.

54:03.200 --> 54:06.720
 And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant

54:06.720 --> 54:10.160
 to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to,

54:10.160 --> 54:11.440
 these sort of welcome sites,

54:11.440 --> 54:14.360
 these sort of picture mitts, as it were,

54:14.360 --> 54:16.360
 that receive the drug,

54:16.360 --> 54:21.360
 those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell.

54:21.680 --> 54:25.120
 And it's what we call receptor internalization.

54:25.120 --> 54:27.880
 So the cell starts to think, gee whiz,

54:27.880 --> 54:31.480
 there's a lot of stimulation going on, this is too much.

54:31.480 --> 54:33.040
 So I'm just going to,

54:33.040 --> 54:36.240
 when normally I would coat my cell with,

54:36.240 --> 54:40.680
 let's just say five of these receptors for argument's sake,

54:40.680 --> 54:43.320
 things are going a little bit too ballistic right now,

54:43.320 --> 54:46.120
 I'm going to take away at least two of those receptors

54:46.120 --> 54:49.160
 and downscale it to just having three of those.

54:49.160 --> 54:52.880
 And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect

54:52.880 --> 54:55.560
 that one cup of coffee got you before.

54:55.560 --> 55:00.560
 And that's why then when you go cold turkey on coffee,

55:01.040 --> 55:05.400
 all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself

55:05.400 --> 55:08.560
 to expecting X amount of stimulation.

55:08.560 --> 55:10.160
 And now all of that stimulation is gone.

55:10.160 --> 55:12.960
 So it's now got too few receptors

55:12.960 --> 55:15.680
 and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome.

55:15.680 --> 55:18.560
 And that's why, for example, with drugs of abuse,

55:18.560 --> 55:22.600
 things like heroin, when people go into abstinence,

55:23.720 --> 55:26.720
 as they're sort of moving into their addiction,

55:26.720 --> 55:30.680
 they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug.

55:30.680 --> 55:34.160
 So they need to take more of it to get the same high.

55:34.160 --> 55:38.200
 But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time,

55:38.200 --> 55:40.680
 the system goes back to being more sensitive again.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.440
 It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell

55:43.440 --> 55:44.680
 with these receptors.

55:44.680 --> 55:47.720
 But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon,

55:47.720 --> 55:49.480
 if they go back to the same dose

55:49.480 --> 55:53.120
 that they were using before 10 weeks ago

55:53.120 --> 55:54.760
 or three months ago,

55:54.760 --> 55:58.200
 that dose can kill them, they can have an overdose.

55:58.200 --> 56:00.360
 Even though they were using the same amount

56:00.360 --> 56:02.280
 at those two different times,

56:02.280 --> 56:05.840
 the difference is that it's not the dose of the drug,

56:05.840 --> 56:08.160
 it's the sensitivity of the system.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.040
 And that's the same thing that we see with caffeine.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.440
 In terms of training the muscle, as it were,

56:13.440 --> 56:16.600
 is the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate.

56:17.640 --> 56:22.640
 Is there a time, the number of hours before bed,

56:22.920 --> 56:27.520
 that's a safe bet to most people to recommend,

56:27.520 --> 56:31.240
 you shouldn't drink caffeine this many hours?

56:31.240 --> 56:33.480
 Like, is there an average half life

56:33.480 --> 56:35.480
 that you should be aiming at?

56:35.480 --> 56:38.080
 Or is this advice kind of impossible

56:38.080 --> 56:39.600
 because there's so much variability?

56:39.600 --> 56:41.280
 There is a huge variability.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.600
 And I think everyone themselves,

56:43.600 --> 56:45.320
 to a degree knows it,

56:45.320 --> 56:48.000
 although I'll put a caveat on that too,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.400
 because it's a slightly dangerous point.

56:50.400 --> 56:53.200
 So the recommendation for the average adult

56:53.200 --> 56:55.640
 and who, where is the average adult in society?

56:55.640 --> 56:56.480
 There is no such thing.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.440
 But for the average adult,

56:58.440 --> 57:00.320
 it would be probably cutting yourself off

57:00.320 --> 57:02.840
 maybe 10 hours before.

57:02.840 --> 57:06.200
 So assuming a normative bedtime in society,

57:06.200 --> 57:10.840
 I would say try to stop drinking caffeine before 2 p.m.

57:10.840 --> 57:13.080
 and just keep an eye out.

57:13.080 --> 57:14.440
 And if you're struggling with sleep,

57:14.440 --> 57:18.000
 dial down the caffeine and see if it makes a difference.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.440
 Can I ask you about sleep and learning?

57:22.440 --> 57:25.360
 So how does sleep affect learning?

57:25.360 --> 57:30.360
 Sleep before learning, sleep after learning,

57:30.400 --> 57:33.120
 which are both fascinating kind of dynamics

57:33.120 --> 57:36.160
 of the mind's interaction with this extra conscious state.

57:36.160 --> 57:41.160
 Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related

57:42.320 --> 57:45.720
 to your memory systems and your informational systems.

57:45.720 --> 57:50.720
 The first is you just mentioned is that sleep before learning

57:50.760 --> 57:53.440
 will essentially prepare your brain

57:53.440 --> 57:55.120
 almost like a dry sponge,

57:55.120 --> 57:59.200
 ready to sort of initially soak up new information.

57:59.200 --> 58:01.240
 In other words, you need sleep before learning

58:01.240 --> 58:04.960
 to effectively imprint information into the brain

58:04.960 --> 58:08.000
 to lay down fresh memory traces.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.080
 And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain,

58:11.080 --> 58:14.040
 and we know we've studied these memory circuits,

58:14.040 --> 58:17.080
 will essentially become waterlogged,

58:17.080 --> 58:18.560
 as it were for the sponge analogy,

58:18.560 --> 58:22.440
 and you can't absorb the information as effectively.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.400
 So you need sleep before learning,

58:26.400 --> 58:30.280
 but you also need sleep, unfortunately, after learning too,

58:30.280 --> 58:33.680
 to then take those freshly minted memories

58:33.680 --> 58:36.280
 and effectively hit the save button on them,

58:36.280 --> 58:38.800
 but it's nowhere near as quick as a digital system.

58:38.800 --> 58:42.200
 It takes hours because it's a physical biological change

58:42.200 --> 58:45.120
 that happens at the level of brain cells.

58:45.120 --> 58:49.600
 But sleep after learning will cement and solidify

58:49.600 --> 58:53.400
 that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain,

58:53.400 --> 58:57.000
 therefore making it less likely to be forgotten.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.360
 So I often think of sleep in that way as,

59:01.360 --> 59:06.360
 it's almost sort of future proofing information in your way.

59:07.040 --> 59:12.040
 Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance

59:13.160 --> 59:15.120
 to be remembered in the future,

59:15.120 --> 59:19.440
 rather than go through the sort of degradation

59:19.440 --> 59:21.320
 that we think of as forgetting.

59:22.240 --> 59:27.240
 So the brain has, in some ways, by default, there is forget.

59:28.040 --> 59:29.960
 And actually, I would love to,

59:29.960 --> 59:32.000
 I was going to say sleep is relevant for memory

59:32.000 --> 59:33.320
 in three different ways,

59:33.320 --> 59:36.920
 but I'm going to amend that and say there's four different ways,

59:36.920 --> 59:41.920
 which is learning, maintaining, memorizing,

59:43.040 --> 59:47.840
 abstraction, assimilation, association, then forgetting,

59:47.840 --> 59:50.520
 which the last one sounds oxymoronic

59:50.520 --> 59:53.560
 based on the form of three, but I'll see if I can explain.

59:53.560 --> 59:58.560
 So sleep after learning then sort of sets that information

59:58.560 --> 1:00:03.560
 like amber in solidification.

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:08.320
 The third benefit, however, is that sleep we've learned

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.320
 more recently is much more intelligent

1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:12.400
 than we ever gave it credit for.

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:16.080
 Sleep doesn't simply just take individual memories

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:17.640
 and strengthen them.

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:21.960
 Sleep will then intelligently integrate and crosslink

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:24.920
 and associate that information together.

1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:28.360
 And it's almost like informational alchemy

1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:30.880
 so that you wake up the next morning

1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:34.960
 with a revised, mind wide web of associations.

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:39.640
 And that's probably the reason that you've never been told

1:00:39.640 --> 1:00:41.000
 to stay awake on a problem.

1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:46.600
 And in every language that I've inquired about that phrase

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:49.680
 or something very similar seems to exist,

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:54.300
 which means to me that this creative associative benefit

1:00:54.300 --> 1:00:56.840
 of sleep transcends cultural boundaries.

1:00:56.840 --> 1:00:59.820
 It is a common experience across humanity.

1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:05.200
 Now I should note that I think the French translation

1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:07.400
 of that is much closer to you.

1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:10.280
 I think you sleep with a problem, whereas the British,

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.400
 you sleep on a problem.

1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:12.960
 The French, you sleep with a problem.

1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:15.120
 I think it says so much about the romantic difference

1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:18.760
 between the British and the French, but let's not go there.

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:20.480
 That's brilliant.

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.480
 So such a subtle, but such a fundamental difference.

1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:24.840
 Yeah, gorgeous.

1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:25.680
 Yeah, goodness me.

1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:27.240
 Sleep with the problem.

1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:28.440
 Yes, exactly.

1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:30.040
 It's right along on the French.

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:34.960
 So, and we can sort of double click on any one of these

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:38.660
 and go into detail, but the fourth,

1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:43.660
 I became really enchanted by about eight years ago

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:46.920
 in our research, which was this idea of forgetting.

1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:52.920
 And I started to think that forgetting may be the price

1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:54.600
 that we pay for remembering.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:01.480
 And in that sense, there is an enormous benefit

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:04.540
 to letting go.

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.440
 And you may be thinking, that sounds ridiculous.

1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:09.760
 I don't want to forget.

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:13.280
 In fact, my biggest problem is I keep forgetting things,

1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:18.280
 but the brain will we believe has a finite storage capacity.

1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:22.560
 We can't prove it yet, but my suspicion is

1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:23.520
 that that's probably true.

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:25.600
 It doesn't have an infinite storage capacity.

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:26.900
 It has constraints.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.600
 If that's the case, we can't simply go through life

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:36.520
 being constantly informational aggregators,

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.880
 unless we are programmed to say,

1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:43.200
 we've got a hard drive space of about 85 to 90 years

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:44.840
 and we're good and we can do that.

1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:46.000
 Maybe that's true.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000
 I don't think that's true.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.680
 I think forgetting is an incredibly good and useful thing.

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:54.280
 So for example, it's not beneficial

1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:57.160
 from an evolutionary perspective for me to remember

1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:59.420
 where I parked my car three years ago.

1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:04.840
 So it's important that I can remember today's parking spot,

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:08.200
 but I don't want to have the junk DNA

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:13.000
 from a memory perspective of where I parked my car

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:14.040
 two years ago.

1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:18.240
 Now, I actually have in some ways a problem with forgetting.

1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:20.560
 I'm, and again, I'm not trying to sort of be laudatory,

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:25.000
 but I tend not to forget too many things.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.240
 And I don't think that that's a good thing.

1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:31.560
 And there was a wonderful neurologist, Luria,

1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:35.480
 who wrote a book called The Mind of the Pneumonocyst.

1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:37.960
 And it was a brilliant book,

1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:40.720
 both because it was written exquisitely,

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:44.880
 but he was studying these sort of memory savants

1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:49.560
 who basically could remember everything that he gave them.

1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:53.680
 And he tried to find a chink in their armor.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.000
 And the first half of the book is essentially about him

1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.980
 seeing how far he can push them before they fail.

1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:03.880
 And he never found that place.

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:08.880
 He could never find a place where they stopped remembering.

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:10.920
 And then in his brilliance,

1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:13.200
 he turned the question on its head.

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:17.800
 He said, not what is the benefit of constantly remembering,

1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:22.320
 but instead what is the detriment to never forgetting?

1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:24.800
 And when you start to realize his descriptions

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:26.160
 of those individuals,

1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:28.360
 it's probably a life that you would not want.

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:32.000
 But it's as fascinating both from a human perspective,

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.560
 but also AI perspective.

1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:38.400
 There's a big challenge in the machine learning community

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:40.720
 of how to build systems that are able to remember

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:42.720
 for prolonged periods of time,

1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:45.000
 lifelong continuous learning.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.200
 So where you build up information over time.

1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:51.240
 So memory is one of the biggest open problems

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:54.680
 in AI and machine learning.

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:55.920
 But at the same time,

1:04:55.920 --> 1:05:00.240
 the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:03.520
 because you have to be exceptionally selective

1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:05.680
 at which kind of stuff you remember.

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:08.200
 And that's where the step of a simulation integration

1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:10.000
 that you're referring to is really important.

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.800
 I mean, we forget most of the things.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:16.760
 And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:20.480
 at the very edge of stuff that could be important

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:21.840
 or could not be.

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:24.240
 How do we remember or not those things?

1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:28.440
 Like for example, I've, you know, doing a podcast,

1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:32.480
 I've become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.240
 that's been problematic,

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:39.240
 which is I forget names and titles of books and so on.

1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:43.440
 So when I read, I remember ideas.

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.600
 I remember quotes.

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:47.640
 I remember statements and like,

1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:50.280
 that's the space in which I'm thinking.

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:52.960
 But when you communicate to others,

1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:56.560
 you have to say this person in this book said that.

1:05:56.560 --> 1:05:59.200
 So it's the same thing with like Andrew Huberman

1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:01.040
 is masterful at this.

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:02.400
 It's this important academia,

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:04.200
 remembering the authors of a paper

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:09.000
 and the title of the paper as part of remembering the idea.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.920
 And I've been feeling the cost of not being able

1:06:12.920 --> 1:06:15.440
 to naturally remember those things.

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:17.920
 And so that's something I need to sort of work on.

1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:20.040
 But that's an example with faces.

1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:21.480
 Yes, very good at faces.

1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:23.000
 But not good with names.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.080
 So I am exactly like you.

1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:27.400
 And there is, you know, an understanding of that

1:06:27.400 --> 1:06:28.840
 in the brain too.

1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:31.560
 We understand that there is partitioning of those

1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:33.200
 in terms of the territory of the brain

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:36.040
 that takes care of faces and facts and places

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:37.920
 and that they can be separate.

1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:40.520
 So I will never forget a face.

1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:44.400
 But, you know, and as I said, I usually forget very little.

1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:47.560
 But for some reason, names are a struggle.

1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:48.400
 I think in some ways

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:50.880
 because I'm probably just a slightly anxious person.

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:52.120
 So when you first meet someone,

1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:55.320
 which is usually the time when a name is introduced,

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:57.200
 you know, you were saying you were sort of anxious

1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:59.680
 maybe about sort of sitting down with me.

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:04.320
 But I find that a little bit, you know, activating.

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:07.240
 And so it's not as though there's anything wrong with my memory.

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:09.400
 It's just the emotional state I'm in

1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:10.680
 when I'm first meeting someone.

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:12.680
 You know, it's a little bit, it's hoping.

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:14.440
 But I will never forget the face.

1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:16.440
 But I completely relate to that

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:19.040
 because I almost don't hear people's names

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:21.320
 when they tell me because I'm so anxious.

1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:22.800
 Yeah, yeah.

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:27.200
 But I think there's certain quirks of social interaction

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:30.360
 that show that you care about the person,

1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:31.760
 that you remember that person,

1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:35.480
 that they matter to you, they had an impact on you.

1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:38.640
 And one of the ways to show that is you remember their name.

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:41.840
 And, but that's a quirk to me because there's,

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:46.080
 a lot of people I meet have a deep impact on me.

1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:50.640
 But they, I can't communicate that unless I know their name,

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:55.960
 unless I know some of the details that,

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:58.640
 that we humans seem to use to communicate

1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:00.120
 that we remember each other.

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:04.920
 What I remember well is the feeling we shared,

1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:07.440
 is the experience we shared.

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:10.440
 What I don't remember well is the detailed labels

1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:12.040
 of those experiences.

1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:14.040
 And I need to certainly work on that.

1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:15.000
 I don't know.

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.240
 I think it's, you know, just allowing yourself to be an eight

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:22.640
 and who you are is also a beautiful thing too.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:24.560
 I'm not suggesting it's not important

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:26.880
 to try and better oneself and,

1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:29.720
 but I also sometimes worry about the misery

1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:31.040
 that that puts us in.

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:35.920
 But like you, I will, I do struggle with them,

1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.760
 but I know for the first time when we met in the lobby,

1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:43.680
 I know exactly what you look like.

1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:45.240
 I know that you were wearing headphones.

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:47.600
 I know the shape and the size of those headphones.

1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:49.040
 You didn't have your black jacket on.

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:51.640
 I know exactly what the weave of your shirt looked like.

1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:53.640
 I know what your shoes look like.

1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:56.040
 And I knew exactly the height of your,

1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:59.520
 the end of your pants from the top of your shoes.

1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:02.360
 And so those things I don't forget, you know,

1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:04.720
 and I can remember when people,

1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:06.440
 I met people, you know, two years ago

1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:08.320
 and I'll say, oh, yes, we met there.

1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:12.280
 And I remember you had those fantastic, you know, boots on.

1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:15.000
 I thought they were pretty great pair of boots, you know,

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:15.920
 and they're like, how do you,

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:18.600
 I didn't even remember what I was wearing that day.

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:19.760
 It's fascinating.

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:21.080
 Yeah, I'm the exact the same way,

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:23.520
 but you can't, until we have neural link

1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:24.360
 or something like that,

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:26.320
 we can't communicate that you remember all those things.

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.120
 I know that's what I want to see.

1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:29.840
 You have to be able to use tricks

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:31.480
 of human communication for that.

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:33.800
 But so that, I mean, that's the,

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:35.800
 it ultimately is a trick of like,

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:37.440
 which to remember, which to forget.

1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:38.280
 Right.

1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:41.080
 And the forgetting is so, it's so fascinating to say this.

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:44.520
 I mean, it seems to be deeply connected

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.680
 to that assimilation process.

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:50.640
 So forgetting, you try to fit all the new stuff

1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:55.040
 into this big web of the old stuff

1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:58.280
 and the things that don't fit, you throw out.

1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:00.080
 I think the assimilation,

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.120
 the way I've been thinking about it with sleep,

1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:03.720
 and it's particularly sort of dream sleep

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:06.280
 that we think can help with this assimilation,

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:09.680
 is that during wake,

1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:13.600
 we have one version of associative processing.

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:14.880
 And what I mean by that is we see

1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:17.200
 the most obvious connections.

1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:22.200
 So I think of wakefulness as a Google search gone right.

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:27.200
 Whereas I see dream sleep as doing something very different.

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:28.520
 I think dream sleep is a little bit

1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:31.040
 like group therapy for memories,

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:33.440
 that everyone gets a name badge,

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:37.440
 and sleep gathers in all of the individual pieces of the day.

1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:41.240
 And it sort of starts to get you to forces you, in fact,

1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:43.160
 to speak to the people, not at the front of the room,

1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:45.560
 that you think you've got the most obvious connection with,

1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.200
 but to speak with the people all the way

1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:49.000
 at the back of the room, that at first you think,

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.080
 I've got no connection to sleep.

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:54.480
 You think I've got no obvious connection with them at all.

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:56.600
 But once you get chatting with them,

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:57.920
 you learn that you do have

1:10:57.920 --> 1:10:59.960
 a very distant, non obvious connection,

1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:02.720
 but it's still a connection non the same.

1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:05.280
 And it's almost as though you're doing a Google search

1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:08.640
 where I input Lex Friedman,

1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:12.120
 and it doesn't take me to the first page of your home site.

1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.840
 It takes me to page 20,

1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:16.920
 which is about some field hockey game at Utah.

1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:20.240
 It turns out that there actually is a link if I look at it.

1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:22.320
 It's a distant, non obvious one.

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:24.160
 And to me, I find that exciting

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:25.840
 because when you fuse things together

1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:27.760
 that shouldn't normally go together,

1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:30.080
 but when they do, they cause marked advances

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:31.600
 in evolutionary fitness,

1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:34.960
 it sounds like the biological basis of creativity.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:37.520
 And that's exactly what I think dream sleep

1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:40.600
 and the algorithm of dream sleep is designed to do.

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.600
 It's not a Boolean like system

1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:47.600
 where you have the sort of assumptions of true and false.

1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:50.680
 Maybe it's more fuzzy logic system.

1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:53.920
 And I think REM sleep is a perfect environment

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:57.760
 within which we do, it's almost like memory pinball.

1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:00.720
 You get the information that you've learned during the day

1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:02.080
 and then you pull the lever back

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.000
 and you shoot it up into the attic of your brain.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000
 This cortex filled with all of your past historical knowledge

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.400
 and you start to bounce it around

1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.400
 and see where one of those things lights up

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:14.760
 and you build a new connection there

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.240
 and you build another one there too.

1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:18.240
 You're developing schemas.

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:21.000
 And so in that way, I think you could argue,

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.240
 we dream, therefore we are.

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:30.240
 Yeah, so in terms of this line between learning

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:32.240
 and thinking through a new thing

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:35.240
 that seems to be deeply connected,

1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:40.240
 there's this legendary engineer named Jim Keller

1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:41.240
 who keeps yelling at me about this.

1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:43.240
 He says it's very effective.

1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:47.240
 He likes to, for difficult problems before bed,

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:49.240
 think about that difficult problem.

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.240
 We're not talking about like drama, work

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:52.240
 or all that kind of stuff.

1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:56.240
 No, like a scientific for him engineering problem.

1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:59.240
 He likes to like intensely think about it

1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:04.240
 and to prime his mind before sleep and then go to sleep.

1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:08.240
 And then he finds that the next day,

1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:10.240
 he's able to think much clearer

1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:13.240
 and there's new ideas that come, but also just,

1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.240
 I guess it's more well integrated.

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.240
 And sometimes during the process of like,

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:25.240
 he's able to like wake up and like seeing new insights.

1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:26.240
 That's right.

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:29.240
 If he's deeply sort of aggressively thinking through a problem.

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:34.240
 And there's many scientific demonstrations of this.

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:38.240
 The Mendelea with a periodic table of elements,

1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:41.240
 you know, he was trying for months to understand.

1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:47.240
 I mean, talk about a ecumenical problem of epic proportions.

1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:49.240
 Here's your question today.

1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:52.240
 You have to understand how all of the known elements

1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:55.240
 in the universe fit together in a logical way.

1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:56.240
 Good luck, take care.

1:13:56.240 --> 1:13:58.240
 It was non trivial at the time.

1:13:58.240 --> 1:13:59.240
 And he would try and try.

1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:01.240
 He was so obsessed with it.

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:05.240
 He created playing cards with all of the different elements on.

1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:09.240
 And then he would go on these long train journeys around Europe

1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:12.240
 and he would just sort of deal these cards in front of them

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:15.240
 and he would shuffle them shuffling and shuffling

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:19.240
 and he would just try to see if he could find what the answer was.

1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:23.240
 And then so the story goes, you know, he fell asleep

1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:24.240
 and he had a dream.

1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:27.240
 And in that dream, you know, all of these elements

1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:29.240
 started to dance and play around

1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:32.240
 and they snapped into a logical grid, you know,

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:35.240
 atomic weights, et cetera, et cetera.

1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:41.240
 And it wasn't his waking brain that solved the problem.

1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:44.240
 It was his sleeping brain that solved the impenetrable problem

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:46.240
 that his waking brain could not.

1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.240
 And there's been, you know, even in the arts and in music

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:52.240
 some wonderful dreams.

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:55.240
 You know, Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's epic Gothic novel

1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:59.240
 came to her in a dream at Lord Byron's home.

1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:05.240
 And then we've got, you know, Paul McCartney.

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:08.240
 Yesterday the song came to him in a dream.

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:12.240
 He was filming, gosh, what was the movie?

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:13.240
 I don't recall it.

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.240
 I should be shot because I'm from Liverpool myself.

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:21.240
 But he was on Wimpoll Street in London and filming

1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:26.240
 and he came up with that song, the melody in his sleep

1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:28.240
 not to be outdone by the Beatles

1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:33.240
 and by the way, Let It Be also came from a dream

1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:34.240
 that McCartney had.

1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.240
 People usually give it, you know, religious overtones.

1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:41.240
 You know, Mother Mary comes to me speaking words of wisdom,

1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:42.240
 Let It Be.

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:45.240
 If you've ever asked who Mother Mary is,

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:49.240
 it's not, you know, the biblical content.

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.240
 It's his mother.

1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:53.240
 It's Mary McCartney.

1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:57.240
 And she came to him in a dream and gifted him the song.

1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:02.240
 But the best story I've heard is not to be outdone

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:04.240
 by the Beatles, the Stones.

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:10.240
 Keith Richards, who I think once was suggested it.

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:11.240
 Who was it?

1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:15.240
 It was a comedian who was saying that in an interview

1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:18.240
 with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards suggested or inferred

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.240
 that young kids should not do drugs.

1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:26.240
 And they said, well, look, young kids can't do drugs

1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:29.240
 because you've done all of the drugs.

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:34.240
 But Keith Richards described he would always go to bed

1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:39.240
 with his guitar and a tape recorder.

1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:43.240
 And then probably he would have a whole set of other things

1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.240
 in the bed with him and who knows how many other people.

1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:49.240
 But anyway, and then he said in his autobiography,

1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:53.240
 and I'm paraphrasing here, but one morning I woke up

1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:58.240
 and I realized that the tape had recorded all the way to the end.

1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.240
 So I rewound the tape and I hit play.

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:05.240
 And there in some kind of ghostly form

1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:08.240
 were the opening chords to satisfaction.

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.240
 The most famous successful Rolling Stone song of all time.

1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:13.240
 Yeah.

1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:16.240
 Followed by then 43 minutes of snoring.

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:18.240
 That's awesome.

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:21.240
 But that riff came to him when one of the most famous riffs

1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:23.240
 in all of rock and roll came to him

1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.240
 by way of a dream inspired insight.

1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:30.240
 So I think there is too many of those anecdotes.

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:31.240
 And we've now got the science.

1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:33.240
 I don't rely on anecdotes as science.

1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:35.240
 We've now done the studies in the laboratory

1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:39.240
 and we can reliably demonstrate that sleep inspires creativity

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.240
 inspires problem solving capacity.

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:43.240
 Well, the interesting thing is is it possible

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:45.240
 to some of the ideas that you talk about

1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:48.240
 to turn them into a protocol that could be practiced rigorously.

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:53.240
 So what Jim Keller espouses is saying

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:58.240
 not just the fact that sleep helps you increase the creativity

1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:00.240
 but turn it into a process.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:03.240
 Like literally, like don't do it accidentally.

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:08.240
 You know, like an athlete does certain things

1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:10.240
 to optimize their performance.

1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:11.240
 They have a training routine.

1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:16.240
 They have a regimen of cycling and sprints

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:19.240
 and long distance stuff in the same way

1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:23.240
 thinking about your job as an idea generator

1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.240
 in the engineering space is like,

1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:27.240
 this is good for my performance.

1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:29.240
 So like for an hour before bed,

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.240
 think through a problem like every night

1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:36.240
 and then use sleep to work through that problem.

1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:38.240
 I mean, these the first person that I heard

1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:40.240
 like of the people I really respect

1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:42.240
 that do like what I do,

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:45.240
 which is like programming engineering type work

1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:50.240
 like using sleep, not accidentally, but with a purpose

1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:52.240
 like using sleep.

1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:54.240
 You know, that's just basically the difference

1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:57.240
 between, as you said, a passive approach to it

1:18:57.240 --> 1:19:01.240
 versus, you know, an active deterministic

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:03.240
 or hope for a deterministic approach to it.

1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:08.240
 In other words, that you are actually trying to harness

1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:11.240
 the power of sleep in a deliberate way

1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:13.240
 rather than an unthoughtful way.

1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:17.240
 I still think that, you know, mother nature through it,

1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.240
 you know, the 3.6 million years of evolution

1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:22.240
 has probably got it mostly figured out

1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:25.240
 in terms of what information should be uploaded

1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:27.240
 at night and worked through.

1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:31.240
 I think our algorithm is probably pretty good at this stage.

1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:33.240
 It's not to suggest though that, you know,

1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.240
 we can't try to tweak it and nudge it.

1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:37.240
 You know, it's a very light hand on the tiller

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:39.240
 is what he's doing.

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.240
 I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:43.240
 You know, just like, for example, for me,

1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:47.240
 fasting has improved my ability to focus deeply

1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:49.240
 and productivity significantly.

1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:53.240
 And in that same way, you know, it's possible

1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:56.240
 that playing with these ideas of thinking before bed

1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:58.240
 or some hours before bed or some,

1:19:58.240 --> 1:20:00.240
 playing with different protocols

1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:02.240
 will have a significant leap over

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:04.240
 what mother nature naturally does.

1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:06.240
 So if you let your body do what it naturally does,

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:09.240
 you may not achieve the same level of performance.

1:20:09.240 --> 1:20:13.240
 Because mother nature has not designed us

1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:16.240
 to think deeply about chip design

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:20.240
 or programming artificial intelligence systems.

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:23.240
 Well, she's gifted us the architecture

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:25.240
 and the capacity to do that.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:28.240
 What we do with that is, you know,

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.240
 is what life's experience dictates.

1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:34.240
 She gives us the blueprint to do many.

1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:37.240
 Well, if I were to sort of introspect

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:40.240
 and self analyze what mother nature wants me to do,

1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:42.240
 I think, given my current lifestyle,

1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:47.240
 that I have food in the fridge and a bed to sleep on,

1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:50.240
 I think what mother nature wants me to do is to be lazy.

1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:55.240
 And so I think I'm actually resisting mother nature.

1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:59.240
 And because so many of my needs are satisfied.

1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:04.240
 And so I have to resist some of the natural forces

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:07.240
 of the body and the mind when I do some of the things I do.

1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:10.240
 So there's that dance, you know,

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.240
 like I've been thinking about doing a startup

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:15.240
 and that's obviously going against everything

1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:18.240
 that my body and mind are telling me to do.

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:21.240
 Because it's going to be basically suffering.

1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:23.240
 But the only reason I want...

1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:26.240
 As you know it, we'll be over.

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:28.240
 Yes.

1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:31.240
 But nevertheless, there's some kind of inner drive

1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:32.240
 that wants me to do it.

1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:34.240
 When you start to ask a question,

1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:36.240
 well, how do you optimize the things you can't optimize,

1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:38.240
 like sleep, like diet,

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:40.240
 like the people that you surround yourself with,

1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:43.240
 in order to maximize happiness and performance

1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:45.240
 and all those kinds of things,

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:47.240
 without also over optimizing.

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:53.240
 And that's such an interesting idea from an engineer.

1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:55.240
 So as you may know,

1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:59.240
 you don't often get those kinds of ideas from engineers.

1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:03.240
 Engineers usually just don't read books about sleeping.

1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:05.240
 They're usually like...

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:10.240
 They're not the healthiest of people.

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:13.240
 I think that's changing over time,

1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:14.240
 especially Silicon Valley,

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:15.240
 especially the tech sector.

1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:18.240
 People are starting to understand what's a healthy lifestyle.

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:21.240
 But usually they're kind of on the insane side,

1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:22.240
 especially programmers.

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:27.240
 But it's nice to hear somebody like that use sleep

1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:30.240
 and use some of the things that you talk about strategically

1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:32.240
 on purpose.

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:36.240
 You know, to that idea of not just trying to use

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:38.240
 what Mother Nature gave,

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:45.240
 but seeing if you can do something more or different.

1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:48.240
 In a conservative mindset,

1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:52.240
 I would then pose the question at what cost?

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:55.240
 Because when you do something perhaps

1:22:55.240 --> 1:23:03.240
 that deviates from the typical preprogrammed Mother Nature's program,

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:07.240
 I suspect it usually comes at the cost of something else.

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:14.240
 So maybe he is able to direct and focus his sleeping cognition

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:16.240
 on those particular topics

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:20.240
 that will gain him better problematic resolution the next day

1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:21.240
 when he wakes up.

1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:23.240
 The question is, though,

1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:26.240
 at what cost of the other things that didn't make it

1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:31.240
 onto the menu of the finger buffet of sleep that night?

1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:36.240
 And is it that you don't process the emotional difficulties

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:40.240
 or events and therefore you are less emotionally resolved

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:41.240
 the next day,

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:45.240
 but you are more problem resolved the following day?

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:47.240
 And so I always try to think,

1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:52.240
 and I truly don't want to sound puritanical either about sleep.

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.240
 And I think I've come off that way many a times,

1:23:55.240 --> 1:23:58.240
 especially when I started out in the public.

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.240
 The tone of the book in some ways,

1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:05.240
 I look back and think, could I have been a little softer?

1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:10.240
 And the reason was I was that way back in,

1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:11.240
 when I started writing the book,

1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:16.240
 which was probably something like 2014 or 15,

1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:18.240
 sleep was the neglected stepsister

1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:21.240
 in the health conversation of the day.

1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:25.240
 And I was just so sad to see the amount of suffering

1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.240
 and disease and sickness that was caused by insufficient sleep.

1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:33.240
 And for years before I'd been doing public speaking

1:24:33.240 --> 1:24:35.240
 and I'd tell people about the great things

1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:36.240
 that happen when you get sleep,

1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:38.240
 people would say, that's fascinating.

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:39.240
 And then they would go back

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.240
 and keep doing the same thing about not sleeping enough.

1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:43.240
 And then I realized,

1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:45.240
 you can't really speak about the good things that happen.

1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:47.240
 It's like the news, what bleeds leads.

1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:50.240
 And if you speak about the alarmingly bad things that happen,

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:52.240
 people tend to have a behavioral change.

1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:55.240
 And so the book as a consequence,

1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:59.240
 I think probably came out a little bit on the strong side

1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:03.240
 of trying to convince people.

1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:05.240
 You were trying to help a lot of people

1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:07.240
 and that's a powerful way to help a lot of people.

1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:09.240
 I was genuinely trying to help people,

1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:13.240
 but certainly for some people for whom sleep does not come easy,

1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.240
 then it was probably a tricky book to read too.

1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:20.240
 And I think I feel more sensitive to those people now

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:23.240
 and empathetically connected to them.

1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:27.240
 So I think, again, the point was simply that

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:32.240
 I don't mean to sound too puritanical in all of this.

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:36.240
 And the same way with caffeine and coffee.

1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:38.240
 I am just a scientist

1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:41.240
 and I am not here to tell anyone how to live their life.

1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:43.240
 That is not my job at all.

1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:47.240
 And life is to be lived to a degree.

1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:51.240
 And life is to be lived if you want to do a startup.

1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:55.240
 All I want to do is empower people with the understanding

1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:57.240
 of the science of sleep.

1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:59.240
 And then you can make an informed choice

1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:01.240
 as to how you want to live your life.

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:05.240
 And I often no judgment on how anyone wishes to live their life.

1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:08.240
 I just want to try and see if the information

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:12.240
 that I have about sleep would alternatively change

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:14.240
 the way you would think about your life decisions.

1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.240
 And if it doesn't, no problem.

1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:19.240
 And if it does, I hope it's been of use.

1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:23.240
 Well, maybe this is me trying to justify my lifestyle to you.

1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:27.240
 But Dr. Seuss said,

1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:29.240
 you know you're in love when you can't fall asleep

1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:33.240
 because reality is finally better than your dreams.

1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:35.240
 I love that quote too.

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.240
 Okay.

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:41.240
 My sleeping schedule is complicated.

1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:47.240
 And it has to do primarily with the fact that I love

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:49.240
 basically everything that I do.

1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:53.240
 And that love takes a form that may not appear

1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:56.240
 to be love from the external observer perspective

1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:58.240
 because it often includes struggle.

1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:02.240
 It often includes something that looks like stress

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:03.240
 even though it's not stress.

1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:05.240
 It's like this excitement.

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:09.240
 It's this turmoil and chaos of passion

1:27:09.240 --> 1:27:14.240
 of struggling with a problem, of being sad and down

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:18.240
 to the point even depressed of how difficult the problem is,

1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:21.240
 the disappointment that the last few weeks and months

1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:25.240
 have been a failure and self doubt, all that mix.

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:27.240
 But I love it.

1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:30.240
 And a part of that is sometimes staying up all night

1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:33.240
 working on a thing I'm really passionate about.

1:27:33.240 --> 1:27:37.240
 And that means sleep schedules that are just like,

1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:40.240
 you know, sometimes sleeping during the day,

1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:43.240
 sometimes very often sleeping very little

1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.240
 but taking naps that are like an hour or two hours and so on.

1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:48.240
 That kind of weird chaos.

1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:54.240
 And now I'll also try to give myself back up.

1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:56.240
 I was trying to like research yesterday

1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:59.240
 is anybody else productive while like this.

1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:02.240
 And there's of course a lot of anecdotal evidence

1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:05.240
 and some of it could be just narratives

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:07.240
 that people have told to the public

1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:09.240
 when in reality they sleep way more.

1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:13.240
 But there's a bunch of people that, you know,

1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.240
 are famous for not sleeping much.

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:19.240
 So on the topic of naps,

1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:22.240
 I read this a long time ago and I checked

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:25.240
 is Churchill was big on big naps.

1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:28.240
 And is actually just reading more about

1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:32.240
 Winston Churchill's sleep schedule is very much like mine.

1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:36.240
 So I basically want to give myself the opportunity

1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:40.240
 to at night to stay up all night if I want to.

1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:44.240
 And a good nap is a big part of that in the late evening.

1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:47.240
 Like I'll often, that's just destroy social life completely.

1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:52.240
 But I'll often take a nap in the late afternoon or the evening.

1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.240
 And that sets me if I want to stay up all night.

1:28:55.240 --> 1:29:00.240
 And things like that, like I read that Nicola Tesla

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:04.240
 slept only two hours a night, Edison the same three hours.

1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:07.240
 But he actually did the polyphasic sleep

1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:09.240
 like where's just a bunch of naps.

1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:16.240
 What can you say about this madness of love and passion

1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:18.240
 of loving everything you do

1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:22.240
 and the chaos of sleep that might result in?

1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:25.240
 I love the Seuss quote.

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:28.240
 And I've had that experience too.

1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:32.240
 Like you, I adore what I do.

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:37.240
 You know, if someone gave you enough money

1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:39.240
 to live the rest of your life, you know,

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:42.240
 I've got a roof above my head, rice and beans on the table.

1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:44.240
 And they said, you don't have to work anymore.

1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:46.240
 I would do nothing different.

1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:51.240
 I would do exactly, you know, the sounds a little crass.

1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:53.240
 And I hope it doesn't sound this way.

1:29:53.240 --> 1:30:00.240
 But being a scientist is not what I do.

1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:02.240
 It's who I am.

1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:08.240
 And when that's the case, sleep, working out,

1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:12.240
 sharing and eating are the things that I do

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:16.240
 in between my love affair with sleep.

1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:17.240
 Yeah.

1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:19.240
 I fell for sleep like a blind roofer.

1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:28.240
 And it was a love affair that started 20 years ago

1:30:28.240 --> 1:30:33.240
 and I remain utterly besotted today.

1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:37.240
 It's the most beguiling thing in the world to me.

1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:39.240
 And I could easily, and I have, you know,

1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:41.240
 it's kept me up at night.

1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:44.240
 When my mind is fizzing with experimental ideas

1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:47.240
 or I think I've got a new hypothesis or theory,

1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:49.240
 I will struggle with sleep.

1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:50.240
 I really will.

1:30:50.240 --> 1:30:52.240
 It doesn't come easy to me

1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:56.240
 because my mind is just so on fire with those ideas.

1:30:56.240 --> 1:31:01.240
 So I understand the struggle.

1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:07.240
 But, you know, I couldn't advocate from a scientific perspective

1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:11.240
 the schedule because the science just doesn't, you know,

1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:15.240
 I would feel as though I'm doing you a disservice to say,

1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:17.240
 it's okay.

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:20.240
 You know, that won't come with some blast radius,

1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:22.240
 some, you know, health consequences.

1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:25.240
 You know, you can add Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan

1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:26.240
 to that list too.

1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:29.240
 Both of them were very, you know,

1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.240
 proud chest beaters of how little sleep that they get.

1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:35.240
 Thatcher said four hours, Reagan, something similar.

1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:38.240
 You know, and I, knowing the links that we now know

1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:40.240
 between sleep and Alzheimer's disease,

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:42.240
 I've often wondered whether it was coincidental then

1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:46.240
 that both of them died of the terrible disease of Alzheimer's,

1:31:46.240 --> 1:31:49.240
 meaning, you know, maybe it doesn't get you by way of,

1:31:49.240 --> 1:31:51.240
 you know, being popped out of the gene pool in a car accident

1:31:51.240 --> 1:31:54.240
 because you had a microsleep at the wheel at age 32,

1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:59.240
 or it doesn't get you at 42 with, you know, heart attack

1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:03.240
 or even 52 with cancer or a stroke.

1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:05.240
 Maybe it gets you in your 70s.

1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:07.240
 I think the elastic band of sleep deprivation

1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:10.240
 can stretch only so far before it snaps.

1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:13.240
 And it ultimately seems to snap.

1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:17.240
 You know, Nikol Tesla, I think he,

1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:22.240
 I think he died of a coronary thrombosis, I believe.

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:25.240
 And there was a wonderful study done out of Harvard

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:27.240
 where they took a group of people who had no signs

1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:29.240
 of cardiovascular disease.

1:32:29.240 --> 1:32:32.240
 And what they found is that when they tracked them

1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:36.240
 for years afterwards, they were completely healthy

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:37.240
 to begin with.

1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:40.240
 Those people who were getting less than six hours of sleep

1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:43.240
 ended up having a 300% increased risk

1:32:43.240 --> 1:32:46.240
 of developing calcification of the coronary artery,

1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:51.240
 which is the major sort of corridor of life for your heart.

1:32:51.240 --> 1:32:54.240
 When someone says, you know, he died of a massive coronary,

1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:58.240
 it's because of a blockade of the coronary artery.

1:32:58.240 --> 1:33:00.240
 You know, and Tesla, you know, passed away

1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:03.240
 from a coronary thrombosis.

1:33:03.240 --> 1:33:05.240
 We also know that insufficient sleep is linked

1:33:05.240 --> 1:33:07.240
 to numerous mental health issues.

1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:11.240
 We know that Churchill had a wicked battle with depression.

1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:13.240
 Gosh, my goodness, he used to call it black dog

1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:15.240
 that would come and visit him.

1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:18.240
 And I think many of his paintings, he was exquisite painter,

1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:20.240
 but some of them would depict his darkness

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:24.240
 with depression as well.

1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:26.240
 You know, Edison is interesting.

1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:28.240
 People have argued that he would short sleep

1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:30.240
 and he didn't put much value in sleep,

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:31.240
 whether or not that's true.

1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:32.240
 We don't know.

1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:34.240
 But he was a habitual napper, you're right, during the day.

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:36.240
 He had some great pictures of him on his inventor's bench

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:37.240
 taking a nap.

1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:40.240
 And in fact, I believe he set up nap cots around his house

1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:42.240
 so he could nap.

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:44.240
 But what we also know is that he, again,

1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:47.240
 coming out of Harvard just a couple of months ago,

1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:50.240
 demonstrated very clearly that polyphasic sleep

1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:52.240
 is associated with worse physical outcomes,

1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:54.240
 worse cognitive outcomes,

1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:57.240
 and especially worse mood outcomes.

1:33:57.240 --> 1:33:59.240
 So from that sense, you know, sleeping like a baby

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:02.240
 is not perfect for adults.

1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:05.240
 There's a fascinating dance here

1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:09.240
 of the mean and the extreme,

1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:13.240
 like the average and the high performers.

1:34:13.240 --> 1:34:20.240
 So I, this gets to like the meaning of life

1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:24.240
 kind of discussion, but let's go then.

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:26.240
 And also happiness.

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:29.240
 So when studying sleep and when studying anything,

1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:31.240
 like diet and exercise,

1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:35.240
 I think you have to really get a lot more data

1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:41.240
 about individuals to make a conclusive statement.

1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:43.240
 That's when people talk about, like,

1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:46.240
 is meat, red meat good for your bad for you, right?

1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:50.240
 It's just so often correlated with other life decisions

1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:52.240
 when you choose to eat meat or not.

1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:59.240
 My sense is that whatever life decisions you make,

1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:04.240
 if they reduce stress and lead to happiness,

1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.240
 that's also going to be a big boost.

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:09.240
 They need to be integrated into the plots in the science, right?

1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:12.240
 So I'll give you an example of somebody

1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:16.240
 who is unarguably seen as unhealthy.

1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:20.240
 My friend, Mr. David Goggins.

1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:26.240
 So he's clearly obviously almost on purpose destroying his body.

1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:30.240
 And to say that he's doing the wrong thing

1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:36.240
 or the unhealthy thing feels like, feels wrong.

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:41.240
 But I'm not sure exactly in which way he feels wrong.

1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:43.240
 One of the things I'm bothered by,

1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:47.240
 and again, I apologize for the therapy sessions,

1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:53.240
 a framework of this, but I'm bothered by the fact

1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:58.240
 that a lot of people tell me or David

1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:02.240
 that they're doing things wrong.

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:06.240
 A lot of people in my life when they see me not sleep,

1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:09.240
 they'll tell me to sleep more.

1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:11.240
 Now, they're correct,

1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:16.240
 but one fundamental aspect that I'd like to complain about

1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:20.240
 is not enough people, almost nobody,

1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:22.240
 especially people that care for me,

1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:25.240
 will come to me and say,

1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:30.240
 you have a dream, work harder.

1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:37.240
 Like, it's like the healthy thing

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.240
 should be a component of a life well lived,

1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:44.240
 but not everything.

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:46.240
 And I don't know what to do with that

1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:48.240
 because you certainly don't want to espouse.

1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:51.240
 And just like you said, when you were working in your book,

1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:54.240
 there is a belief that you don't sleep

1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:57.240
 as a secondary citizen in the full spectrum

1:36:57.240 --> 1:36:59.240
 of what's a healthy life,

1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.240
 but at the same time, I'm bothered by in Silicon Valley

1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:05.240
 and all these kinds of work environments

1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:07.240
 that I get to work with with engineers

1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:13.240
 is there's, to me, too much focus on work life balance.

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:16.240
 What that usually starts meaning is like,

1:37:16.240 --> 1:37:18.240
 yeah, of course, it's good to have a social life,

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:22.240
 it's good to have a family, it's good to eat well

1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:25.240
 and sleep well, but we should also discover our passion.

1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:29.240
 We should also give our chance to give ourselves

1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:33.240
 a chance to work our ass off towards a dream

1:37:33.240 --> 1:37:36.240
 and make mistakes and take big risks

1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:39.240
 that in the short term seem to sacrifice health.

1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:42.240
 And I think to come back to how you started

1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:45.240
 about David Goggins, who I've never met,

1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.240
 but who I admire incredibly

1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:51.240
 and have an immense reverence for the man,

1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:53.240
 you said two things.

1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:59.240
 Is it wrong to do those things to yourself?

1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:03.240
 And is it unhealthy to do those things to yourself?

1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:07.240
 I disagree with the former and I agree with the latter.

1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:11.240
 So from a health biological medicine perspective,

1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:14.240
 sleeping in the way that you've described

1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:16.240
 or that other people may be sleeping

1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:19.240
 in terms of insufficient amounts.

1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:24.240
 Now, to your point too about individual differences,

1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:27.240
 usually when I see a bar graph and a mean,

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:30.240
 I usually say, show me your variance.

1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:32.240
 I want to see your variance.

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.240
 In other words, show me the distribution of that effect.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:37.240
 How many people were below the mean?

1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:40.240
 Is it all tightly clustered around this one thing

1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:42.240
 so it's a very robust effect?

1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:45.240
 I'm a huge fan of effect where for some people,

1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:47.240
 there was no effect at all in other people.

1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:49.240
 There was a whopping effect in everything in between.

1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:54.240
 So I don't discount into individual variability.

1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:57.240
 But, and I will come back to those two points about,

1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:00.240
 is it wrong and is it unhealthy in just a second?

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:03.240
 When it comes to sleep, we have found huge amounts

1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:06.240
 of interindividual differences in your response

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:08.240
 to a lack of sleep.

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:10.240
 But one of the fascinating things,

1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:13.240
 that I take you on, we're going to measure your attention,

1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:16.240
 your emotion, your mood, your blood pressure,

1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:19.240
 your blood sugar glucose regulation,

1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:21.240
 your autonomic nervous system,

1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:23.240
 and your different gene expression.

1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:26.240
 Let's say I'm just going to measure a whole kaleidoscope

1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:28.240
 of different outcomes, brain and body.

1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:31.240
 And I find that on our measure of cognition

1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:33.240
 on your attentional ability to focus,

1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:35.240
 you are very resilient.

1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:37.240
 You just don't show any impermanence at all,

1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:40.240
 even after being awake for 36 hours straight.

1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:42.240
 Does that mean that you are resilient

1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:44.240
 in all of those other domains as well?

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:46.240
 The answer is no, you're not.

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:48.240
 So you can be resilient in one,

1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:51.240
 but very vulnerable in another.

1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:54.240
 And we've not found anyone

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:58.240
 who isn't at least vulnerable in one of those domains,

1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.240
 meaning that it's somewhat safe to say

1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:03.240
 that not getting sufficient sleep

1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:06.240
 will lead to some kind of impairment

1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:08.240
 in anyone given individual.

1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:10.240
 It may not be the same impairment,

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:12.240
 but it's likely to be an impairment.

1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.240
 But to come back to the question,

1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:16.240
 I think it's wrong to tell anyone

1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:19.240
 that it's wrong to do what they're doing,

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:21.240
 even if they are compromising their sleep,

1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.240
 even if they're compromising their mental health.

1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.240
 You know, as long as they're not hurting anyone else,

1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:32.240
 then I think the answer is that's that person's choice.

1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:34.240
 Yeah, but that's that person's life.

1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:36.240
 I'd like to push back further.

1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:39.240
 So, see, the way you kind of said it,

1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:41.240
 yes, you're absolutely right.

1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:45.240
 But I would like to say a stronger statement,

1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:49.240
 which is you should let go of that judgment

1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:51.240
 of somebody is wrong

1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:53.240
 and allow yourself to be inspired

1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:55.240
 by the great heights they have reached.

1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:58.240
 So take yourself out of the seat

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:01.240
 of being a judge of what is healthy and not,

1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:05.240
 and appreciate the greatness of a particular human.

1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:07.240
 You watch the Olympics,

1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:10.240
 the kind of things that some athletes do to reach

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:12.240
 the very heights.

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:15.240
 The Olympics are taking years off of their life.

1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:18.240
 They suffer depression after the Olympics often.

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:21.240
 The physiology is disastrous in everything.

1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:26.240
 Their personal life, their psychology, their physiology,

1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:29.240
 everything, it's a giant mess.

1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.240
 The question is about life.

1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:40.240
 Healthy now means longevity, quality of life

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:42.240
 over a prolonged period of time,

1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:46.240
 optimal performance over a prolonged period of time.

1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:52.240
 But to me, beauty is reaching great heights.

1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:54.240
 And there's a dance there

1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:56.240
 that sometimes reaching great heights

1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:58.240
 requires sacrifice of health

1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:01.240
 and not like a calculation

1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:03.240
 where you sat down on a sheet of paper and say,

1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:05.240
 I'm going to take seven years off my life

1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.240
 for an Olympic gold medal.

1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:10.240
 No, it requires more chaotic journey

1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:13.240
 that doesn't do that kind of calculus.

1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:15.240
 And I just want to kind of speak to the,

1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:19.240
 in the culture that struggles of what is healthy and not,

1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.240
 we want to be able to speak to what is healthy

1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:26.240
 and at the same time be inspired by the great heights

1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:29.240
 that humans reach no matter how healthy

1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:32.240
 or unhealthy they live.

1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:34.240
 Yeah, I agree with that.

1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:35.240
 I think if that's a flag you're hoisting,

1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:38.240
 I will definitely salute it because it really depends.

1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:41.240
 What are you trying to optimize for in your life?

1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:44.240
 And if you are, I think the only danger

1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:47.240
 potentially with that mindset is that

1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:51.240
 if you look at many of the studies of old age

1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:53.240
 and end of life,

1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:57.240
 most people say, I never look back on my life

1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:01.240
 and wish I worked harder.

1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:04.240
 I wish instead I'd spent more time

1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:08.240
 with family, friends, and engaged in that aspect.

1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:11.240
 Now, I'm not saying though, coming back to your point

1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:13.240
 that that is the standard rubric for everyone.

1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:15.240
 I don't believe it is too.

1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:17.240
 And there are many things that you and I

1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:19.240
 are both benefiting from today,

1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:22.240
 even in the field of medicine,

1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:26.240
 where people have sacrificed their own longevity

1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:30.240
 for the quest of solving a particular medical problem.

1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:37.240
 And they died quicker because of their commitment

1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:40.240
 because they wished to try and solve that problem

1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:42.240
 in their pursuit of greatness scientifically.

1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:44.240
 And I now benefit.

1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:46.240
 Am I grateful that they did that?

1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:48.240
 Incredibly grateful.

1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:51.240
 A simpler demonstration is this.

1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:54.240
 If tonight at 4 a.m. in the morning,

1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:57.240
 I have a ruptured appendix.

1:43:57.240 --> 1:43:59.240
 I have an appendicitis.

1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:04.240
 I am incredibly grateful that there is an emergency team

1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:07.240
 that will take me to the hospital at 4 a.m. in the morning.

1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:08.240
 They are awake.

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:09.240
 They're not sleeping.

1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:12.240
 And they save my life.

1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:17.240
 And that's part of what their life's mission and quest is.

1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:21.240
 And they saved another's life by, in some ways,

1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:24.240
 shaving a little of their own off.

1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:29.240
 So I have no umbrage with that mentality at all.

1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:31.240
 I think you just have to be very clear

1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.240
 about what you're optimizing for.

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:39.240
 And my worry is that most people fall into the rat race.

1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:41.240
 And they never actually ask the question,

1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:43.240
 why am I doing this?

1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:47.240
 If you're just working 9 to 5,

1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:51.240
 and you allow that 9 to 5 to stretch into much longer,

1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:54.240
 but it's nevertheless a job that's kind of like,

1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:56.240
 wears you down, that's one thing.

1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:02.240
 Another thing is when it's a dream.

1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:04.240
 It's a life mission to accomplish.

1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:08.240
 And for that, I think as long as you know

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:11.240
 what it is that you could be doing to yourself,

1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:14.240
 you are comfortable and AOK with that.

1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:17.240
 I have no problem with that at all.

1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:20.240
 Again, as I said, as a scientist,

1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:23.240
 I cannot, should not and will not tell anyone

1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:25.240
 what they should do with their life.

1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:27.240
 All I want you to be able to do is say,

1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:31.240
 okay, now I understand more about the,

1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.240
 previously these were the known unknowns

1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:38.240
 and these were the unknown unknowns.

1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:41.240
 And now I am slightly more cognizant.

1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:46.240
 I have more knowns than I had before

1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:48.240
 regarding my sleep and my health.

1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:51.240
 Knowing that information, do I still choose

1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:53.240
 to make this decision?

1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:57.240
 And if that's what I offered,

1:45:57.240 --> 1:45:59.240
 then I think I've done my job.

1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.240
 That's all I want to offer is just added information

1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:04.240
 into the decision algorithm.

1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:09.240
 And what you end up choosing as an output of that algorithm

1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:11.240
 has nothing to do with me.

1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:14.240
 It's not my business and I will never judge anyone for it.

1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:16.240
 And as I said, I'm immensely grateful

1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:19.240
 for people who have sacrificed much in their lives

1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:21.240
 to give me what I have.

1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.240
 So you're saying as long as the sacrifice

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:25.240
 sort of grounded in knowledge of, you know,

1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:28.240
 what the sacrifice is that sleep is important

1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:29.240
 and all those kinds of things.

1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:30.240
 And that you're comfortable with it.

1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:32.240
 That is, it is your conscious choice

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:34.240
 rather than feeling as though you're trapped

1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:38.240
 or that you are just, you haven't thought about it.

1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:41.240
 And, you know, you start that job at age 32

1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:44.240
 and then you wake up the next morning and you're 65

1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:46.240
 and you think, where did my life go?

1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:47.240
 What was I doing?

1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:49.240
 That to me, I would feel, I would want to hug you

1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:52.240
 and I would say I'm so, I'm just,

1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:54.240
 and I'm not sounding, I don't want to sound belittling

1:46:54.240 --> 1:46:56.240
 here at all.

1:46:56.240 --> 1:46:59.240
 I would just not wish that for you.

1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:03.240
 I would wish that you could have, you know,

1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:05.240
 thought about what it was that you're doing

1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:07.240
 and not have that regret.

1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:10.240
 Yeah, so I guess this is for you, the listener.

1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:12.240
 I'm coming out of the closet here a little bit.

1:47:12.240 --> 1:47:15.240
 The fact that I enjoy the madness I live in,

1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:18.240
 so please do not criticize me, embrace me.

1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:21.240
 I understand the sacrifices I'm making.

1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.240
 I enjoy sleeping on the floor when I'm

1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:25.240
 passionately programming all night

1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:28.240
 and just pass out on the carpet.

1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:30.240
 I love this life, okay?

1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:33.240
 So it's definitely something I think about

1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:37.240
 that there's a balance of strike.

1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:40.240
 I just want you to have as much of it though.

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:44.240
 Of life.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:49.240
 See, quality of life is important.

1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:51.240
 I should have said I want you to have as much

1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:55.240
 high quality life and if high quality of life

1:47:55.240 --> 1:48:01.240
 means I spend five decades on this planet,

1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:04.240
 but yet in that time I am thrilled every day.

1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:07.240
 I'm turned on every day by what I do

1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:14.240
 and I reveled in this thing called my life's work.

1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:17.240
 I think that that is a 50 year journey

1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:20.240
 of absolute delight and fulfillment

1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:24.240
 that you should take.

1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:26.240
 I think about my death all the time.

1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:28.240
 I meditate on death.

1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:31.240
 I'm okay to die today.

1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:37.240
 So to me longevity is not a significant goal.

1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.240
 I'm so happy to be alive.

1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:43.240
 I don't even think it would suck to die today.

1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:47.240
 I'm as afraid of it today as I will be in 50 years.

1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:51.240
 I don't want to die as much today as I will in 50 years.

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:56.240
 There's of course all these experiences I would like to have,

1:48:56.240 --> 1:48:59.240
 but everything is already amazing.

1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:01.240
 It's like that Lego movie.

1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:03.240
 So I don't know.

1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.240
 To me I just want to keep doing this.

1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:12.240
 And there's of course things that could affect,

1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:16.240
 like you mentioned dementia and these deterioration

1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:20.240
 of the mind or the body that can significantly affect

1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:23.240
 the quality of life.

1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:26.240
 Do you're aware of that?

1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:28.240
 And that's the price you pay for the entry

1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:32.240
 into this magical kingdom that you are experiencing,

1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:34.240
 which is a lovely thing.

1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:36.240
 I feel privileged too.

1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:38.240
 I can't believe the life that I live.

1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:41.240
 It's incredible.

1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:46.240
 And just like you, I think about mortality a great deal.

1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:48.240
 I think a lot about death,

1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:52.240
 but I don't worry about death.

1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:56.240
 I probably, with the exception of the potential pain

1:49:56.240 --> 1:49:58.240
 that comes before it that some people,

1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:02.240
 many people can suffer, that maybe concerns me.

1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:06.240
 But I actually think about mortality as a tool,

1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:12.240
 as I use it as a lens through which I can then retrospect.

1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:16.240
 And by placing myself at the point of future mortality,

1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:21.240
 I can then use it as a retrospective lens to focus

1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240
 and ask the following question.

1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:26.240
 Is there anything I feel I would regret

1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:31.240
 and therefore change in the life that I currently have now?

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:36.240
 That's the way I meditate and use mortality as a question,

1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:39.240
 is to try and course correct and focus my life.

1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:42.240
 I worry not about dying,

1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:47.240
 but I like to think about death as a way to prioritize my life.

1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:49.240
 If that makes sense, I don't know if that makes sense.

1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:55.240
 No, it makes total sense to decide how do you want to live today

1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:00.240
 so that in the future you do not regret the way you live today.

1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:04.240
 And to place yourself in the future at your point of mortality

1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:10.240
 is one way to, I think, as an exercise to retrospectively look back

1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:15.240
 and not lose out on informed choices that you could otherwise lose out on

1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:18.240
 if you weren't thinking about mortality.

1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:22.240
 Yeah, it clarifies your thinking.

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.240
 So I mentioned I sleep on the floor, take naps and power naps

1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:28.240
 and just kind of madness.

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:32.240
 Is there weirdnesses to your own sleep schedule as a scientist

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:38.240
 that does incredible work, has a lot of things going on,

1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:44.240
 has to lead research, has to write research, has to be a science communicator,

1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:47.240
 also have a social life, all those kinds of things.

1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:52.240
 Is there certain patterns to your own sleep that you regret

1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:59.240
 or you participate in that you find you enjoy?

1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:03.240
 Is there some personal stuff, quirks,

1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:07.240
 or things you're proud of that you do in terms of your sleep schedule?

1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:12.240
 The funny thing about being a sleep researcher is that it doesn't make you immune

1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:16.240
 to the ravages of a difficult night of sleep.

1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:24.240
 And I have battled my own periods of insomnia in my life too.

1:52:24.240 --> 1:52:28.240
 And I think I've been fortunate in ways because I know how sleep works

1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:30.240
 and I know how to combat insomnia.

1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:32.240
 I know how to get it under control.

1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:38.240
 Because insomnia in many ways is a condition where all of a sudden

1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:42.240
 your sleep controls you rather than you control your sleep.

1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:46.240
 Wow, yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it, yeah.

1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:54.240
 And I know when I'm starting to lose control and it's starting to take control.

1:52:54.240 --> 1:53:01.240
 I understand how to regain, but it doesn't happen overnight.

1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:03.240
 It takes a long time.

1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:06.240
 So you've struggled with insomnia in your life?

1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:08.240
 I have not all of my life.

1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:12.240
 I would say I've probably had three or four really severe bouts.

1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:18.240
 And all of them usually triggered by emotional circumstances by stress.

1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:24.240
 Stress that's connected to actual events in life or stress that's unexplainable?

1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:26.240
 All externally triggered.

1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:30.240
 Yeah, it's sort of what we would call reactive stress.

1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:38.240
 And so that's sort of point number one about the idiosyncrasies.

1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:43.240
 The point number two is that when you are having a difficult night of sleep,

1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:49.240
 as a sleep researcher, you basically have become the Woody Allen neurotic of the sleep world.

1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:54.240
 Because at that moment, you know, I'm trying to fall asleep and I'm not.

1:53:54.240 --> 1:53:58.240
 And I'm starting to think, okay, my dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is not shutting down.

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:00.240
 Or adrenaline is not ramping down.

1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:03.240
 My sympathetic nervous system is not giving way to my parasitic.

1:54:03.240 --> 1:54:08.240
 At that point, you are dead in the water for the next two hours and nothing is bringing you back.

1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:11.240
 So there is some irony in that too.

1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:17.240
 I would say for myself, though, if there's something I'm not proud of,

1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:23.240
 it has been at times railing against my chronotype.

1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:28.240
 So your chronotype is essentially, are you a morning type evening type or somewhere in between?

1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:29.240
 Yeah.

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:36.240
 And there were times because society is desperately biased towards the morning types.

1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:40.240
 You know, this notion of the early bird catches the worm.

1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:46.240
 Maybe that's true, but I'll also tell you that the second mouse gets the cheese.

1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:52.240
 Yeah, so I think one of the issues is a good line around, you know,

1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:55.240
 if firstly people don't really understand chronotype,

1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:58.240
 because I'll have some people when I'm sort of out in the public,

1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:01.240
 they'll say, look, I struggled with terrible insomnia and I'll ask them,

1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:03.240
 is it problems falling asleep or staying asleep?

1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:05.240
 And they'll say falling asleep.

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:10.240
 And then I'll say, look, if you are on a desert island with nothing to wake up for,

1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:14.240
 no responsibilities, what time would you normally go to bed and what time would you wake up?

1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:18.240
 And they would say, I probably like to go to bed about midnight and wake up maybe eight in the morning.

1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:22.240
 Then I'd say, so what time do you now go to bed? And they'd say, well, I've got to be up for work early,

1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:24.240
 so I get into bed at 10.

1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:29.240
 I'd say, well, you don't have insomnia, you have a mismatch between your biological chronotype

1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:31.240
 and your current sleep schedule.

1:55:31.240 --> 1:55:35.240
 And when you align those two, and I was fighting that for some time too,

1:55:35.240 --> 1:55:40.240
 I'm probably mostly right in the middle.

1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:45.240
 I am desperately vanilla, unfortunately, in many aspects of life.

1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:49.240
 But this included, I'm neither a strong morning type nor a strong evening type.

1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:54.240
 So ideally, I'd probably like to go to bed around, you know, 11, 10, 30, 11,

1:55:54.240 --> 1:55:58.240
 probably somewhere between 10, 13, 11, and wake up, you know,

1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:04.240
 I naturally wake up usually most days before my alarm at 7.04.

1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:09.240
 And it's 7.04 because why not be a deosyncratic in terms of sitting up?

1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:10.240
 I love it.

1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:15.240
 And so I... That's kind of awesome. I've never heard about that. That's amazing.

1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:19.240
 I'm going to start doing that now, setting alarms a little bit off the...

1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:22.240
 Yeah, I know. I'm never quite sure why we all...

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:24.240
 It's a celebration of uniqueness.

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:28.240
 Yeah, and I am quite the odd snowflake in that sense too.

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:33.240
 So I would usually then try to force myself because I had that same mentality

1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:38.240
 that if I wasn't up at, you know, 6.30 and in the gym by 7.

1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:41.240
 That there was something wrong with me.

1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:44.240
 And I quickly abandoned that.

1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:47.240
 But if I look back, if there was a shameful act that I have around my sleep,

1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:52.240
 I think it would be that for some years until I really started to get more detailed into sleep.

1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:57.240
 And now I have no shame in telling people that, you know,

1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:03.240
 I will probably usually wake up around 6.45 naturally, sometimes 7.

1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:08.240
 When people are looking at me thinking, you're a sloth, you're lazy.

1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:14.240
 And, you know, I don't finish my daily workout until, you know,

1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:17.240
 I'm not working until probably 9 o clock in the morning.

1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:19.240
 I'm thinking, what are you doing?

1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:22.240
 Now, I will work late into the day.

1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:25.240
 You know, if I could, I would work 16 hours.

1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:29.240
 It's my passion, just like yours.

1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:35.240
 So I don't feel shame around that, but I have changed my mentality around that.

1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:43.240
 It's complicated because I'm probably happiest going to bed

1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:46.240
 if I'm being honest, like at 5 a.m.

1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:48.240
 That's fine. You're just an extreme evening type.

1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:54.240
 But the problem is it's not that I'm ashamed for it.

1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:59.240
 I actually kind of enjoy it because I get to sleep through all the nonsense of, like, the morning.

1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:01.240
 Isn't that a beautiful thing?

1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:06.240
 People are busy with their emails and I just am happy as a cow.

1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:09.240
 And I wake up after all the drama has been resolved.

1:58:09.240 --> 1:58:12.240
 Yeah, and cows are happy and the drama has been resolved.

1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:13.240
 Exactly.

1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:18.240
 But, you know, in society you do, especially, I mean, this is what I think about is,

1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:22.240
 you know, when you work on a larger team, especially with companies,

1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:26.240
 you are, you know, everybody's awake at the same time.

1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:32.240
 So that's definitely been a struggle to try to figure out, just like you said,

1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:38.240
 how to balance that, how to fit into society and yet be optimal for your chronotype.

1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:42.240
 Yeah, to sleep in synchrony with it and harmony.

1:58:42.240 --> 1:58:48.240
 Because normally what we know is that if you fight biology, you'll normally lose.

1:58:48.240 --> 1:58:52.240
 And the way you know you've lost is through disease and sickness.

1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:56.240
 You said you suffered through several bouts of insomnia.

1:58:56.240 --> 1:59:02.240
 Is there, aside from embracing your chronotype,

1:59:02.240 --> 1:59:07.240
 is there a device you can give to overcome insomnia from your own experience?

1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:12.240
 Right now the best method that we have is something called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia

1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:14.240
 or CBTI for short.

1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:18.240
 And you work with people who don't know what it is.

1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:21.240
 You work with a therapist for maybe six weeks.

1:59:21.240 --> 1:59:24.240
 And you can do it online, by the way, I recommend probably jumping online.

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.240
 It's just the easiest.

1:59:26.240 --> 1:59:31.240
 And it will change your beliefs, your habits, your behaviors,

1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:34.240
 and your general stress around this thing called sleep.

1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:37.240
 And it is just as effective as sleeping pills in the short term.

1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:42.240
 But what's great is that unlike sleeping pills, when you stop working with your therapist,

1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:45.240
 those benefits last for years later.

1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:49.240
 Whereas when you stop your sleeping pills, you typically have what's called rebound insomnia,

1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:54.240
 where your sleep not only goes back to being as bad as it was before, it's usually even worse.

1:59:54.240 --> 2:00:00.240
 For me, I think I found a number of things effective.

2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:04.240
 The first is that I had to really address what was stressful

2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:11.240
 and try to come up with some degree of meaningful rationality around it.

2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:13.240
 Because I think one of the things that happens,

2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:17.240
 there's something very, talking about conscious states to come all the way back to,

2:00:17.240 --> 2:00:19.240
 gosh, I don't know.

2:00:19.240 --> 2:00:21.240
 I feel like we've only been chatting for like 20 minutes,

2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:23.240
 but you're going to tell me it's been a while.

2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:24.240
 Yeah, it's been a while.

2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:27.240
 Okay, I'm desperately, I feel terribly sorry.

2:00:27.240 --> 2:00:32.240
 But let's come back to conscious states where we started.

2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:36.240
 There is something very strange about the night

2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:43.240
 that thoughts and anxieties are not the same as they are in the waking day.

2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:45.240
 They are worse, they are bigger.

2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:58.240
 And I at least find that I am far more likely to catastrophize and ruminate at night about things,

2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:01.240
 that when I wake up the next day in the broad light of day,

2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:04.240
 I think it's no one nearer that bad man.

2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:05.240
 What were you doing?

2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:06.240
 I'm not that bad at all.

2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:12.240
 So to gain firstly some rational understanding of my emotional state

2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:15.240
 that's causing that insomnia was very helpful.

2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:18.240
 The second thing was to keep regularity,

2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:21.240
 just going to bed at the same time waking up.

2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:25.240
 And here's an unconventional piece of sleep advice.

2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:31.240
 After a bad night of sleep, do nothing.

2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:34.240
 Don't wake up any later.

2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:37.240
 Don't go to bed any earlier.

2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:39.240
 Don't nap during the day.

2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.240
 And don't drink any more coffee than you would otherwise.

2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:47.240
 Because if you end up sleeping later into the morning,

2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:51.240
 you're then not going to be tired at your normal time at night.

2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:53.240
 So then you're going to get into bed thinking,

2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:58.240
 well, I had a terrible night of sleep last night and yes, I slept in this morning to try and compensate.

2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:01.240
 But I'm still going to get to bed at my normal time.

2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:05.240
 You get into bed and you haven't been awake for as long as you normally would.

2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:07.240
 So you're not as sleepy as you normally would be.

2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:11.240
 And so now you sit there lying in bed and it's another bad night.

2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:15.240
 And the same thing is, you know, if you go to bed any earlier,

2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:19.240
 so don't wake up any later, wake up at the same time.

2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:23.240
 Don't go to bed any earlier because then you're just probably your chronotype,

2:02:23.240 --> 2:02:26.240
 your biological rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep.

2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:32.240
 And you think, well, terrible night, I'm going to get into bed at 9 p.m. rather than my standard 10.

2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:35.240
 You're just going to be lying in bed awake for that hour.

2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:37.240
 Naps will take our double edged sword.

2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:42.240
 They can have wonderful benefits and we've done lots of studies on naps for both the brain and the body.

2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:50.240
 But they are a double edged sword in the sense that napping will just take the edge off your sleepiness.

2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:52.240
 It's a little bit like a valve on a pressure cooker.

2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:59.240
 When you nap during the day, you can take some of that healthy sleepiness that you've been building up during the day.

2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:04.240
 And for some people, not all people, but for some people that can then make it harder for them to fall asleep at night

2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:07.240
 and then stay asleep soundly across the night.

2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:12.240
 So the advice would be if you're struggling with sleep at night, don't nap during the day.

2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:17.240
 But if you are not struggling with sleep and you can nap regularly, naps are just fine.

2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:21.240
 And we can play around with optimal durations depending on what you want.

2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:27.240
 Just try not to nap too late into the day because napping late into the day is like snacking before your main meal.

2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:30.240
 It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger as it were.

2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:36.240
 So that's my unconventional second piece of advice regarding insomnia.

2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:38.240
 The third is meditation.

2:03:38.240 --> 2:03:41.240
 I found meditation to be incredibly powerful.

2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:49.240
 I started reading about meditation as I was researching that aspect of the book many years ago.

2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:53.240
 And as a hard nose scientist, I thought this sounds very woo woo.

2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:59.240
 This is sort of we all hold hands and sing come by our and everything's going to be fine with sleep.

2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:02.240
 I read the data and it was compelling.

2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:04.240
 I couldn't ignore it.

2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:09.240
 And I started meditating and that was six years ago and I haven't stopped.

2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:14.240
 And I found meditation before bed incredibly powerful.

2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:19.240
 The meditation app companies were perplexed at this at first, they want people to meditate during the day.

2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:24.240
 But when they looked at their usage statistics, they found that they would have people in the morning meditating.

2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:28.240
 And then there's a huge number of people using the meditation app in the evening.

2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:31.240
 What they were doing was self medicating this.

2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:38.240
 They're insomnia and they finally rather than railing against it, they started to see it as a cash cow.

2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:39.240
 Rightly so.

2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:45.240
 So I found meditation to be helpful having a wind down routine is the other thing that's critical for me.

2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:51.240
 I can't just go from because when my mind is switched on and I think you may be like this too.

2:04:51.240 --> 2:05:02.240
 If I get into bed, that roller decks of thoughts and information and excitement and anxiety and worry is just whirling away.

2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:05.240
 And it's not going to be a good night for me.

2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:07.240
 So I have to find a wind down routine.

2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:10.240
 And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like.

2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:13.240
 Sleep is not like a light switch.

2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:16.240
 Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane.

2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:22.240
 You know, it takes time to descend down onto the terra firma that we call sound sleep at night.

2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:24.240
 And we have this for kids.

2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:33.240
 You know, I don't have children, but you know, a lot of parents will say, you know, we have to have the bedroom.

2:05:33.240 --> 2:05:38.240
 You're sorry, the bedtime routine, you know, you bathe the kids, you put them in bed, you read them a story.

2:05:38.240 --> 2:05:42.240
 You have to go through this routine, this wind down routine for them.

2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:44.240
 And then they fall asleep wonderfully.

2:05:44.240 --> 2:05:47.240
 Why do we abandon that as adults?

2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:51.240
 We need that same wind down routine.

2:05:51.240 --> 2:05:54.240
 So that's been the other thing that's been very helpful to me.

2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:58.240
 So don't do anything different if you have a bad night of sleep.

2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:00.240
 Keep doing the same thing.

2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:04.240
 Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it.

2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:11.240
 Then meditation and then finally having some kind of disengagement wind down routine.

2:06:11.240 --> 2:06:15.240
 Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me.

2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:16.240
 That's brilliant.

2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:20.240
 So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia.

2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:30.240
 Is it possible to have a healthy sleep life without the regularities?

2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:37.240
 I say that because I'm all over the place and I've gotten good in being all over the place.

2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:42.240
 So I'll often, like what happens, I'll go stretches of time.

2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:49.240
 There'll be sometimes a month where my days are like, this is embarrassing to admit, but they're like...

2:06:49.240 --> 2:06:51.240
 It's just you and I here.

2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:55.240
 It's like 28 hours or 30 hour days.

2:06:55.240 --> 2:07:00.240
 I'll just go all the way around comfortably and happily.

2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:01.240
 I love it.

2:07:01.240 --> 2:07:03.240
 And then there'll be a nap.

2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:09.240
 If you add up to hours when I'm just sleeping as much as I want,

2:07:09.240 --> 2:07:14.240
 it'll probably be like six hour average per 24 hours.

2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:18.240
 So it works out nicely, maybe even seven hours.

2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:23.240
 But it's obviously irregular and there's chaos in the whole thing.

2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:26.240
 Sometimes it's shorter sleep, sometimes it's longer.

2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:29.240
 Is that totally not a good thing?

2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:30.240
 Do you think?

2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:37.240
 The best evidence that we have to speak to this question is people who are doing rotating shifts.

2:07:37.240 --> 2:07:41.240
 And unfortunately, the news is not good.

2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:53.240
 They usually have a higher instance of many diseases such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, stroke.

2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:05.240
 And again, that's just me communicating the data that we have.

2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:08.240
 And I'm not telling you that you should do anything different.

2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:17.240
 The other thing is that there's nothing in your biology that suggests that that's how your body was designed to sleep.

2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:22.240
 It is a system that loves habit.

2:08:22.240 --> 2:08:30.240
 If your circadian clock in your brain is called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:36.240
 sits in the middle of your brain, had a personality trait, it would be a creature of habit.

2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:38.240
 It loves habit.

2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:47.240
 That's how your biology is designed to work is through very archetypal, prototypical, expected cycles.

2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:58.240
 And when we do something different to that, then you start to see some of the pressure, stress fractures in the system.

2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:09.240
 But again, to your point, if that's something that you don't mind adopting and understanding,

2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:12.240
 then I think you should keep doing what you're doing.

2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:13.240
 Yeah, it's complicated.

2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:16.240
 Of course, you have to be a student of your own body and explore it.

2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:23.240
 One of the reasons I want to have kids is kids enforce a stricter schedule.

2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:34.240
 I think I definitely feel that I'm not living the sort of data wise, scientifically speaking, the optimal life.

2:09:34.240 --> 2:09:39.240
 And me just living the way I want to live day to day is perhaps not the optimal way.

2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:48.240
 And there's certain things that I've seen, very successful people that I know in my life when they have kids.

2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:53.240
 They actually, the productivity goes up, they get their shit together, there's a lot of aspects that...

2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:54.240
 Regularity, yeah.

2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:55.240
 Yeah, the regularity.

2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:56.240
 I mean, that creature's a habit.

2:09:56.240 --> 2:09:57.240
 That's the thing.

2:09:57.240 --> 2:09:58.240
 That's power.

2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:02.240
 And then you start to optimally use the hours you have in a day.

2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:03.240
 Let me ask you about that.

2:10:03.240 --> 2:10:06.240
 Well, actually, I just have one quick point on that too.

2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:18.240
 You know, we often think about sleep as a cost, but instead I think of sleep as an investment.

2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:26.240
 And the reason is because your effectiveness and your efficiency when you're well slept typically exceeds that when you're not.

2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:38.240
 And to me, it's the idea of if I'm going to boil a pot of water, why would I boil it on medium when I could boil it in half the time on high?

2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:39.240
 Yeah.

2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:52.240
 And I sometimes worry that when I speak to Fortune 500 companies and, you know, they're of this mentality of, you know, long hours getting people to rise and grind.

2:10:52.240 --> 2:11:01.240
 The first point is that after about 20 hours of being awake, a human being is as cognitively as impaired as they would be if they were legally drunk.

2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:12.240
 And the reason I bring that point up is because I don't know any company or CEO who would say, I've got this great team that drunk all the time.

2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:25.240
 But we often lord the airport warrior who's flown through three different time zones in the past two days is on email at 2am and then is, you know, in the office at six.

2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:32.240
 And I think there is some aspect, not in all people, but there is sort of some aspect of that slight sleep machismo.

2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:47.240
 And that's not what you are very different, you know, you are driven by a purity of passion and a very authentic, incredibly genuine goal of wanting to do something remarkable with your life.

2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:52.240
 That's not the issue I think I'm speaking about.

2:11:52.240 --> 2:12:12.240
 It's just simply that I think the this notion of wanting to be awake for longer to try and get more done and sometimes be at odds with the fact that you can actually get so much more done if you're well slept.

2:12:12.240 --> 2:12:14.240
 And it's this trade off.

2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:21.240
 I actually admire people that take the big risk and work hard, whether that means staying up late at night, all those kinds of things.

2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:29.240
 But it cannot be in the framework in the context like what Edison said, which is sleep feels like a waste of time.

2:12:29.240 --> 2:12:36.240
 So like, if you're not sleeping, because you think sleep is stupid, that's totally wrong.

2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:45.240
 But if you're not sleeping because you're deeply passionate about something that to me, it's a gray area, of course, but that to me is much more admirable.

2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:54.240
 And everything you're espousing is saying like, whatever the hell you're doing, you better be aware of the sleep long term and short term is really good for you.

2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:59.240
 So if you're not sleeping, you're sacrificing, just make sure you're sacrificing for the right thing.

2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:03.240
 I see vodka and getting drunk the same way.

2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:05.240
 I know it's not good for me.

2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:08.240
 I know I'm not going to feel good days after.

2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:10.240
 I know it's going to decrease my performance.

2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:22.240
 There's nothing positive about it, except it introduces chaos in my life that introduces beautiful experiences that I would not otherwise have.

2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:34.240
 It creates like this turmoil of social interaction that ultimately makes me happy that I've experienced them in the moment and later the stories you get to meet new people.

2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:40.240
 Alcohol in this society is an incredible facilitator of that.

2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:46.240
 So that's a good example of not sleeping and drinking way too much vodka.

2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:51.240
 Again, it's this notion of life is to be lived to a degree.

2:13:51.240 --> 2:14:03.240
 But if you do have children, I think one of the other things that then maybe comes into the picture is the fact that now there are other people that you have to live with.

2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:07.240
 For example, that you have to live for than yourself.

2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:09.240
 Yeah, but come on.

2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:15.240
 Once they're old enough, if you can't defend for yourself, you're too weak, get stronger.

2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:17.240
 It's going to be that kind of fatherhood.

2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:19.240
 I got it.

2:14:19.240 --> 2:14:23.240
 I'm understanding so much more about like screaming.

2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:29.240
 That's why you have to have, for me, my wife would be probably softer.

2:14:29.240 --> 2:14:33.240
 It's good cop, bad cop, because I think I'm...

2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:44.240
 But of course, actually, because I don't have kids, I've seen some tough dudes when they have kids become the softies.

2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:47.240
 They do everything for their kids.

2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:50.240
 It totally transforms their life.

2:14:50.240 --> 2:15:00.240
 Joe Rogan is an example that has just seen so many tough guys completely become changed by having kids, which is fascinating to watch,

2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:04.240
 because it just shows you how meaningful having kids is for a lot of people.

2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:15.240
 Although, I would say having Chastity with Joe for some time, I think he is a delightful, sweetheart, independent of children.

2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:19.240
 I think, don't get me wrong, I don't want to be in a ring with him.

2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:22.240
 He would pace me five ways till Tuesday.

2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:27.240
 But I think he's a desperately sweet man and a very, very smart individual.

2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:35.240
 But he talks about the compassion he's gained from realizing just watching kids grow up, that we were all kids at some point.

2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:37.240
 You get a new perspective.

2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:40.240
 I think just like me, I still get this with him.

2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:45.240
 He's super competitive and there's a certain way to approach life.

2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:49.240
 You're striving to do great things and you're competitive against others.

2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:56.240
 And that intensity or that aggression, that can lack compassion sometimes and empathy.

2:15:56.240 --> 2:16:00.240
 And when you have children, you get a sense like, oh, everybody was a child at some point.

2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:04.240
 Everybody was a kid and you see that whole development process.

2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:12.240
 It can definitely enrich, expand your ability to be empathetic.

2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:15.240
 Let me ask you about diet.

2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:19.240
 So what's the connection between diet and sleep?

2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:24.240
 So I do intermittent fasting sometimes only one meal a day, sometimes no meals a day.

2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:29.240
 Is there a good science on the interaction between fasting and sleep?

2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:37.240
 We have some data, I would prefer more, but we have data both on time restricted eating.

2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:45.240
 And then we have some data on fasting to a degree.

2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:51.240
 On time restricted eating, I think that it has some benefits.

2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:57.240
 Although the human replication studies have actually not borne out quite the same health benefit extent

2:16:57.240 --> 2:16:59.240
 that the animal studies have.

2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:06.240
 There have been some disappointing studies, one here close to where we are right now at UCSF recently.

2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:09.240
 So I think time restricted eating can be a good thing.

2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:12.240
 And there are many benefits of time restricted eating.

2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:14.240
 Is sleep one of them?

2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:21.240
 No, it doesn't seem to be because there are probably at the time that we're recording this three pretty decent studies that I'm aware of.

2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:25.240
 Two out of the three were in obese individuals.

2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:28.240
 One out of the three were in healthy weight individuals.

2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:36.240
 And what they found was that time restricted eating in all three of those studies didn't have any advantageous benefit to sleep.

2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:41.240
 It didn't necessarily harm sleep, but it didn't seem to improve it.

2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:49.240
 When it comes to fasting though, which is a different state, we don't have too many studies, experimental studies with long term fasting.

2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:52.240
 The best data that we have is probably from religious practices.

2:17:52.240 --> 2:18:03.240
 And probably the most data we have is during Ramadan where people will fast for 29 to 30 days from sunrise to sunset.

2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:13.240
 And under those conditions, there are probably five distinct changes that we've seen.

2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:16.240
 None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep.

2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:20.240
 The first is that the amount of melatonin that you release and melatonin is a hormone.

2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:24.240
 It's often called the hormone of darkness or the vampire hormone.

2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:30.240
 Not because it makes you look longingly at people's necklines, but it's just because it comes out at night.

2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:36.240
 Melatonin signals to your brain that and your body that it's dark, it's nighttime and it's time to sleep.

2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:45.240
 Those individuals, when they were undergoing that regimen to fasting, the amount of melatonin that was released and when it was released,

2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:50.240
 the amount of melatonin decreased and when it was released came later.

2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:51.240
 That was the first thing.

2:18:51.240 --> 2:18:59.240
 The second thing was that they ended up finding it harder to fall asleep as quickly as they normally would otherwise.

2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:04.240
 The third thing was that the total amount of sleep that they were getting decreased.

2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:11.240
 The fourth fascinating thing was that awake promoting chemical called orexin increased.

2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:21.240
 This is why a lot of people will say, when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer and I'm more alert, I'm more active.

2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:26.240
 I'll come back from an evolutionary perspective, why we understand that to be the case.

2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:33.240
 Then the fourth factor is that fasting didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected.

2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:37.240
 It did, however, decrease the amount of REM sleep or dream sleep.

2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:42.240
 We know that REM sleep dreaming is essential for emotional first aid, mental health.

2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:45.240
 It's critical for memory creativity.

2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:47.240
 It's also critical for several hormone functions.

2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:52.240
 It's when there's direct correlations between testosterone.

2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:58.240
 Testosterone release peaks just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep, too.

2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:00.240
 REM sleep is critical.

2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:02.240
 Those are the five changes that we've seen.

2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:06.240
 None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep.

2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:12.240
 The fourth point that I mentioned, which was orexin, which is this awake promoting chemical,

2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:19.240
 and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain,

2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:27.240
 and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy, where you're just unpredictable with your sleep.

2:20:27.240 --> 2:20:36.240
 Orexin, when it's in high concentrations, keeps you awake when you lose it.

2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:43.240
 It can put you very much into a state of narcolepsy where you're sleeping a lot of the time in unpredictable sleep.

2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:51.240
 Why on earth, when you are fasting, would the brain release awake promoting chemical?

2:20:51.240 --> 2:21:00.240
 Our answer right now is the following. One of the few times that I mentioned before that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep

2:21:00.240 --> 2:21:06.240
 or prolonged sleep deprivation is under conditions of starvation.

2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:11.240
 That is an extreme evolutionary pressure.

2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:14.240
 At that point, the brain will forgo some.

2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:18.240
 It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep.

2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:24.240
 The reason is so that it can stay awake for longer because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain,

2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:28.240
 you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter.

2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:34.240
 You need to stay awake for longer so you can travel outside of your perimeter for a further distance,

2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:37.240
 and maybe you will find food and save the organism.

2:21:37.240 --> 2:21:46.240
 In other words, when we fast, it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal that you are under conditions of starvation.

2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.240
 The brain responds by saying, oh my goodness, I need to release the chemical

2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:57.240
 that helps the organism stay awake for longer, which is a rexin, so that they can forage for more food.

2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:02.240
 Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective doesn't know about this thing called Safeway,

2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:05.240
 that you could easily go to and break the fast.

2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:08.240
 That's how we understand fasting.

2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:14.240
 I think my dear friend, Peter Thier, has done a lot of work in this area too.

2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:17.240
 I think fasting and David Sinclair is brilliant work.

2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:20.240
 Goodness me, what an individual too.

2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:28.240
 The work is pretty clear there that time restricted eating and fasting have wonderful health benefits.

2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:39.240
 Fasting creates this thing called hermesis, just like exercise and low level stress and sauna, heat, chalk.

2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:45.240
 Hormesis is a biological process, I think, as David Sinclair once said in simple layman's terms.

2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:48.240
 What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:56.240
 I think there is certainly good data that fasting and time restricted eating has many benefits.

2:22:56.240 --> 2:22:57.240
 Is sleep one of them?

2:22:57.240 --> 2:22:58.240
 It doesn't seem to be.

2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:00.240
 It doesn't seem to enhance sleep.

2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:04.240
 It's interesting to understand its effects on sleep.

2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:12.240
 I've fasted, it's a study of NF2.

2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:16.240
 I once fasted 72 hours and another time 48 hours.

2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:22.240
 I found that I got much less sleep and it was very restful though.

2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:26.240
 I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt, which is I needed less sleep.

2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:34.240
 I wonder if my brain is deceiving me because it feels like I'm getting a whole extra amount of focus for free.

2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:39.240
 I wonder if there's long term impacts of that.

2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:45.240
 If I fast 24 hours, I get the same amount of calories, one meal a day.

2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:50.240
 There's a little bit of discomfort, like maybe your body gets a little bit colder.

2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:58.240
 Maybe there's just hunger, but the amount of focus is crazy.

2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:02.240
 I'm a little suspicious of that.

2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:04.240
 I feel like I'm getting something for free.

2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:08.240
 I'm the same way with sweetener, like Splendor or something.

2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:10.240
 It's got to be really bad for you, right?

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:12.240
 Because why is it so tasty?

2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:25.240
 I think, as we said before, with biology, if there's a gain, there's often a cost too.

2:24:25.240 --> 2:24:29.240
 But we at least understand the biological basis of what you're describing.

2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:33.240
 It's not that you actually don't need less sleep.

2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:39.240
 It's that this chemical is present that forces you more awake.

2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:45.240
 Subjectively, you feel as though, I don't need as much sleep because I'm wide awake.

2:24:45.240 --> 2:24:47.240
 Those two things are quite different.

2:24:47.240 --> 2:24:51.240
 It's not as though your sleep need has decreased.

2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:55.240
 It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch, the overboost switch,

2:24:55.240 --> 2:25:00.240
 to say, we need to keep you awake because food is in short supply.

2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:05.240
 You mentioned during sleep, there's a simulation, all those kinds of things for learning purposes.

2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:10.240
 You mentioned the five ways in which we become psychotic in dreams.

2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:14.240
 What do you think dreams are about?

2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:17.240
 Why do you think we dream?

2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:20.240
 What place do we go to when we dream?

2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:22.240
 And why are they useful?

2:25:22.240 --> 2:25:29.240
 Not just the assimilation aspect, but just all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams.

2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:33.240
 Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful?

2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:39.240
 Why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?

2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:46.240
 One of the camps in the sleep field is that dreams are meaningless,

2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:51.240
 that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct of this thing called REM sleep

2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:55.240
 from which dreams come from as a physiological state.

2:25:55.240 --> 2:26:00.240
 The analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb,

2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:06.240
 that the reason that you create the apparatus of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light

2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:13.240
 in the same way that we've evolved to this thing called REM sleep to serve whatever functions REM sleep.

2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:19.240
 But it turns out that when you create light in that way, you also produce something called heat.

2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:26.240
 It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb, it's just what happens when you create light in that way.

2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:32.240
 And the belief so too was that dreaming was essentially the heat of the light bulb,

2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:38.240
 that REM sleep is critical, but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours,

2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:44.240
 you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming.

2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:47.240
 I don't believe that for a second.

2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:56.240
 And from a simple perspective is that I suspect that dreaming is more metabolically costly as a conscious experience than not dreaming.

2:26:56.240 --> 2:27:05.240
 So you could still have REM sleep, but absent the conscious experience of dreaming was probably less metabolically costly.

2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:13.240
 And whenever Mother Nature burns the energy unit called ATP, which is the most valuable thing,

2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:22.240
 there's usually a reason for it. So if it's more energetically demanding, then I suspect that there is a function to it.

2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:26.240
 And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function.

2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:28.240
 The first, as we mentioned, creativity.

2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:34.240
 The second is that dreams provide a form of overnight therapy.

2:27:34.240 --> 2:27:46.240
 Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid. And it's during dream sleep at night that we take these difficult, painful experiences that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic.

2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:51.240
 And dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm.

2:27:51.240 --> 2:28:01.240
 And it sort of just takes the sharp edges off those difficult, painful experiences so that you come back the next day and you feel better about them.

2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:07.240
 And so I think in that sense, dreaming, it's not time that heals all wounds.

2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:12.240
 It's time during dream sleep that provides emotional convalescence.

2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:19.240
 So dreaming is almost a form of, you know, emotional windscreen wipers.

2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:25.240
 And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream.

2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:30.240
 It's what you dream about that also matters.

2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:37.240
 But for example, scientists have done studies with learning in memory where they have people learn a virtual maze.

2:28:37.240 --> 2:28:51.240
 And what they discovered was that those people who then dreamed but dreamed of the maze were the only ones who, when they woke up, ended up being better at navigating the maze.

2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:58.240
 Whereas those people who dreamed but didn't dream about the maze itself, they were no better at navigating the maze.

2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:02.240
 It's not just that you, it's not sort of necessary but not sufficient.

2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:07.240
 It's necessary that you dream, but it's not sufficient to produce the benefit.

2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:10.240
 You have to be dreaming about certain things itself.

2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:13.240
 And the same is true for mental health.

2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:26.240
 What we've discovered is that people who are going through a very difficult experience, a trauma, for example, a very painful divorce, those people who are dreaming but dreaming of that difficult event itself,

2:29:26.240 --> 2:29:31.240
 they go on to gain resolution to their clinical depression one year later.

2:29:31.240 --> 2:29:42.240
 Whereas people who were dreaming just as much but not dreaming about the trauma itself did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution to their depression.

2:29:42.240 --> 2:29:50.240
 So I think to me, those are the lines of evidence that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal.

2:29:50.240 --> 2:30:00.240
 And it's not just about the act of dreaming, it's about the content of the dreams, not just the fact of a dream itself.

2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:11.240
 It's first of all, it's fascinating, it makes a lot of sense, but then immediately takes my mind to, from an engineering perspective, how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems.

2:30:11.240 --> 2:30:27.240
 If you think about dreaming as an important part about learning and cognition and filtering previous memories of what's important, integrating them, maybe you can correct me,

2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:34.240
 but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds that are not constrained by physics.

2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:46.240
 So you get a chance to take some of your memories, some of your thoughts, some of your anxieties and play with them, construct virtual worlds and see how it evolves.

2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:57.240
 To play with those worlds in a safe environment of your mind, safe in quotes, because you can probably get into a lot of trouble with the places your mind will go.

2:30:57.240 --> 2:31:06.240
 And this definitely is applied in much cruder ways in artificial intelligence.

2:31:06.240 --> 2:31:20.240
 So one context in which this is applied is the process called self play, which is reinforcement learning where agents play against itself or versions of itself.

2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:29.240
 It's all simulated of trying different versions of themselves and playing against each other to see what ends up being a good.

2:31:29.240 --> 2:31:36.240
 The ultimate goal is to learn a function that represents what is good and what is not good in terms of how you should act in the world.

2:31:36.240 --> 2:31:43.240
 Right, you create a set of decision weights based on experience and you constantly update those weights based on ongoing learning.

2:31:43.240 --> 2:31:49.240
 But the experience is artificially created versus actual real data.

2:31:49.240 --> 2:31:56.240
 It's a crude approximation where dreams are, which is you're hallucinating a lot of things to see which things are actually.

2:31:56.240 --> 2:32:07.240
 No, I think it's and it's been a theory that's been put forward, which is that dreaming is a virtual reality test space that is largely consequence free.

2:32:07.240 --> 2:32:13.240
 What an incredible gift to give a conscious mind each and every night.

2:32:13.240 --> 2:32:20.240
 Now, the conscious mind, the human mind is very good at constructing dreams that are nevertheless useful for you.

2:32:20.240 --> 2:32:32.240
 Like they're wild and crazy, but they're such that they are still grounded in reality to a degree where anything you learn in dreams might be useful in reality.

2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:38.240
 This is a very difficult thing to do because it requires a lot of intelligence, it requires consciousness.

2:32:38.240 --> 2:32:49.240
 This has been effectively recently being used in self supervised learning for computer vision with the process of what's called data augmentation.

2:32:49.240 --> 2:33:06.240
 That's a very crude version of dreams, which is you take data and you mess with it and you start to learn how a picture of a cat truly represents a cat by messing with it in different ways.

2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:11.240
 Now, the crude methods currently are cropping, rotating, distorting, all that kind of stuff.

2:33:11.240 --> 2:33:25.240
 But you can imagine much more complicated generative processes that start hallucinating different cats in order for you to understand deeply of what it means for something to look like a cat.

2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:28.240
 What is the prototype of the archetype of a cat?

2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:42.240
 That's a very difficult process for computer vision to go from what are the pixels that are usually associated with a cat to what is a cat in the visual space?

2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:49.240
 In the three dimensional visual space that is projected on an image, on a two dimensional image, what is a cat?

2:33:49.240 --> 2:33:57.240
 Those are fundamentally philosophical questions that we humans don't know the answer to, like linguistically.

2:33:57.240 --> 2:34:04.240
 But when we look at a picture of a cat and a dog, we can usually tell pretty damn well what's the difference.

2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:12.240
 And I don't know what that is because you can't reduce that to pointy ears or non pointy ears, furry or not furry, something about the eyes.

2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:20.240
 It's been a longstanding issue in cognitive neuroscience too, is how does the brain create an archetype?

2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:29.240
 How does it create schemas that have general applicability but yet still obtain specificity?

2:34:29.240 --> 2:34:31.240
 That's a very difficult challenge.

2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:33.240
 We can do it, we do it.

2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:35.240
 It's rather bloody amazing.

2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:40.240
 And it seems like part of the toolbox is this controlled hallucination, which is dreams.

2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:45.240
 Well, it's a relaxing of the rigid constraints.

2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:52.240
 I often think of dreaming as it's from an information processing standpoint.

2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:58.240
 The prison guards are away and the prisoners are running amok in a delightful way.

2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:05.240
 And part of the reason is because when you go into dream sleep, the rational part of your brain called the prefrontal cortex, which is the part.

2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:07.240
 It's like the CEO of the brain.

2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:12.240
 It's very good at making high level rational top down decisions and controlled actions.

2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:17.240
 That part of the brain is shut down during REM sleep.

2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:27.240
 But then emotional centers, memory centers, visual centers, motoric centers, all of those centers actually become more active.

2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:33.240
 In fact, some of them are more active than when we're awake in the dream state.

2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:39.240
 So your brain from a neural architecture perspective is radically different.

2:35:39.240 --> 2:35:44.240
 Its network feature is not the same as wakefulness.

2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:56.240
 And I think this is an immensely beneficial thing that we have at least two different rational and irrational conscious states that we do information processing in.

2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:01.240
 The rational, the veritical, the page one of the Google search is wakefulness.

2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:09.240
 And the more irrational, illogical, hyper associative Google page 20 is the REM sleep.

2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:12.240
 Both I think are critical, both are necessary.

2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:13.240
 That's fascinating.

2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:22.240
 And again, fascinating to see how that could be integrated in the machines to help them learn better and to reason better.

2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:26.240
 And in some ways, we also know it from a chemical perspective too.

2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:35.240
 If you go into dream sleep, it is a neurochemical cocktail like no other that we see in the at the rest of the 24 hour state.

2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:40.240
 There is a chemical called noradrenaline or norepinephrine in the brain.

2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:52.240
 And you know if it's sister chemical in the body called adrenaline, but upstairs in the brain noradrenaline is very good at creating a very hyper focused, attentive, narrow.

2:36:52.240 --> 2:37:00.240
 It's sort of very convergent way of thinking to a point sharp focus.

2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:04.240
 That's the only thing the spotlight of consciousness is very narrow.

2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:06.240
 That's noradrenaline.

2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:17.240
 When you remove noradrenaline, then you go from a high SNR high signal to noise ratio where it's just you and I in this moment.

2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:19.240
 I don't even know what's going on elsewhere.

2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:22.240
 And with you, noradrenaline is present.

2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:30.240
 But when you go into REM sleep, it is the only time during the 24 hour period where your brain is devoid of any noradrenaline.

2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:32.240
 It is completely shut off.

2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:35.240
 And so the signal to noise ratio is very different.

2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:42.240
 It's almost as though we're injecting a greater amount of noise into the neural architecture of the brain during dream sleep.

2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:50.240
 As if it's chemically brute forced into this relaxed, associative memory processing state.

2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:58.240
 And then from an anatomical perspective, just as I described the prefrontal cortex goes down and other regions light up.

2:37:58.240 --> 2:38:08.240
 So it is a state that seems to be very, I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep and tell me that it's not REM sleep.

2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:14.240
 Just say, look, based on the pattern of this brain activity, what would you say is going on in this person's mind?

2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:16.240
 I would say, well, they're probably not rational.

2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:19.240
 They're probably not having logical thought because their prefrontal cortex is down.

2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:25.240
 They're probably feeling very emotional because their amygdala is is active, which is an emotional center of the brain.

2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:30.240
 They're definitely going to be thinking visually because the back of the brain is lit up the visual cortex.

2:38:30.240 --> 2:38:39.240
 It's probably going to be filled with past experience and autobiographical memories because their their memory centers are lighting up.

2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:43.240
 And there's probably going to be movement because their motor cortex is very active.

2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:45.240
 That to me sounds very much like a dream.

2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:49.240
 And that's exactly what we see in brain scanners when we've put people inside of them.

2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:59.240
 One of the things I notice sleep effects is my ability to see the beauty in the world.

2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:05.240
 So what do you think is the connection to sleep in your emotional life?

2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:12.240
 Your ability to love other human beings and love life?

2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:19.240
 Yeah, I think it's it's very powerful and strong.

2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:24.240
 So we've done a lot of work in the field of sleep and emotion and sleep and moods.

2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:31.240
 And you can separate your emotions into two main buckets, positive and negative.

2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:41.240
 And what's interesting is that when you are sleep deprived and the more hours that you go into being awake and the fewer hours that you've had to sleep,

2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:46.240
 your your negative mood starts to increase.

2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:52.240
 And we know which individual types of emotions are changing.

2:39:52.240 --> 2:40:11.240
 I've got a wonderful postdoc in my lab called Etty Ben Simon who's doing some incredible work on trying to understand the emotional individual emotional tapestry of affective meltdown when you're not getting sufficient sleep.

2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:15.240
 But let's just keep with two dimensions, positive and negative.

2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:20.240
 Most people would think, well, it's the negative that takes the biggest hit when I'm sleep deprived.

2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:28.240
 It's not by probably a log order magnitude larger is a hit on your positive emotions.

2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:34.240
 In other words, you stop gaining pleasure from normally pleasurable things.

2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:37.240
 And it's a state that we call anhedonia.

2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:43.240
 And anhedonia is the state that we often call depression.

2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:51.240
 So depression to most people's surprise isn't necessarily that you're always feeling negative emotions.

2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:58.240
 It's often more about the fact that you lose the pleasure in the good things in life.

2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:00.240
 That's what we call anhedonia.

2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:03.240
 That's what we see in sleep and insufficient sleep.

2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:05.240
 And it happens quite quickly.

2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:15.240
 Yeah, it's kind of fascinating. I think I do it's not depression, but like it's a it's a stroll into that direction,

2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:21.240
 which is when I'm sleep deprived, I stop being able to see the meaning in life.

2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:26.240
 The things that gave me meanings starts to lose meaning like stupid.

2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:33.240
 It makes me realize how enjoyable everything is in my life because when I start to lose it when I'm severely sleep deprived,

2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:36.240
 you start to see how much life sucks when you lose it.

2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:41.240
 But that said, I'm just cognizant enough that sleep fixes all of that.

2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:44.240
 So I use those states for what they're worth.

2:41:44.240 --> 2:41:52.240
 In fact, I personally like to pay attention to the things that bother me in doing that time.

2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:57.240
 Because they also reveal important information to me.

2:41:57.240 --> 2:41:59.240
 That's interesting.

2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:01.240
 That's usually like a roll shock.

2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:07.240
 Yeah, I mean, so I find when I fast combine with sleep deprivation,

2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:15.240
 I'm clear to see with people clear in identifying the things that are not going right in my life.

2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:21.240
 Or people that I'm working with are not doing as good of a job as they could be doing.

2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:27.240
 Like people that are negative in my life, I'm more able to identify them.

2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:31.240
 So I don't act on that. It's a very bad time to act on those decisions.

2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:33.240
 Good point, well made.

2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:39.240
 I'm recording that information because I usually when I'm well rested and happy,

2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:43.240
 I see the beauty in everybody, which can get you into trouble.

2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:45.240
 You have to balance those two things.

2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.240
 But yes, it's fascinating.

2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:51.240
 There's irony there too, which is the fact that when you're well rested and well slept,

2:42:51.240 --> 2:43:01.240
 as you said, you see the beauty in life and it sort of enlivens you and sort of gives you a quality of life

2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:03.240
 that's emotionally very different.

2:43:03.240 --> 2:43:15.240
 Yet then we are contrasting that against the need for not getting enough sleep

2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:19.240
 because of the beautiful things that you want to accomplish in life.

2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:29.240
 And I don't actually see them as completely counterintuitive or paradoxical

2:43:29.240 --> 2:43:35.240
 because I still think that you can strive for all of the brilliant things that you are striving for

2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:41.240
 to have the monumental goals, the Herculean challenges that you wish to take on and solve.

2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:47.240
 They can still enthrall you and excite you and stimulate you.

2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:55.240
 But because of the insufficient sleep that they can or that goal can produce,

2:43:55.240 --> 2:44:01.240
 it will shave off the beauty of life that you experience in between.

2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:03.240
 And again, this is just about the trade off.

2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:11.240
 I will say though that and this is not applicable to your circumstance,

2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:17.240
 we do know that insufficient sleep is very strongly linked to suicide ideation,

2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:23.240
 suicide attempts and tragically suicide completion as well.

2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:27.240
 And in fact, in 20 years of studying sleep,

2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:33.240
 we have not been able to discover a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.

2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:41.240
 And I think that that is a profound state. I think it tells us so much about the role of sleep

2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:45.240
 as a potential causal agent in psychiatric conditions.

2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:49.240
 I also think it's a potential sign that we should be using sleep as a tool

2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:51.240
 for the prevention of grave mental illness.

2:44:51.240 --> 2:44:55.240
 Yeah, it's both a cause and a solution.

2:44:55.240 --> 2:45:01.240
 I mean, me personally, I've gone through a few dark periods quite recently

2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:05.240
 and it was almost always sleep is not the cause,

2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:11.240
 but sleep is the catalyst from going to a bad time to a very bad time.

2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:17.240
 Yeah. And so it's definitely true and it's funny how sleep can just cure all of that.

2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:23.240
 There's actually a beautiful quote by an American entrepreneur called E. Joseph Kosman

2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:29.240
 who once said that the best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep.

2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:37.240
 And I spilled quite so much ink and hundreds of pages

2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:41.240
 in elegantly trying to say the same thing in my book and he said it in one line

2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:43.240
 and it's beautiful.

2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:47.240
 What do you think is we've been talking about how to extend this life,

2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:49.240
 how to make it a good life.

2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:53.240
 I've been talking about love.

2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:57.240
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole ride of life of life?

2:45:57.240 --> 2:46:01.240
 Why do we want to make it a good one?

2:46:01.240 --> 2:46:05.240
 Do you think there's a meaning? Do you think there's an answer to the why?

2:46:05.240 --> 2:46:09.240
 For me personally,

2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:19.240
 I think the meaning of life is to eat, is to sleep, is to fall in love,

2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:27.240
 is to cry, and then to die.

2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:29.240
 Probably race cars in between.

2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:33.240
 Race cars? Well, there's a whole topic of sex we didn't talk about.

2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:35.240
 That's probably in there. So should we do that?

2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:39.240
 Maybe if you'll have me back, I will give you a round.

2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:43.240
 Next time we will do another three hours on sex alone.

2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:49.240
 It has been over three hours.

2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:52.240
 I'm a big fan of your work. I think you're doing really important work.

2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:56.240
 Even despite all the things I've been saying about the madness of my own sleep schedule,

2:46:56.240 --> 2:46:59.240
 I think you're helping millions of people.

2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:02.240
 It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me

2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:05.240
 and I can't wait until your podcast comes out.

2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:08.240
 I'm a huge fan of podcasts. I'm a huge fan of you.

2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.240
 It's just an honor to know you and to get a chance hopefully in the future

2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:15.240
 to work together with you. You're a brilliant man

2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:20.240
 and you're doing amazing things and I feel immensely honored

2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:25.240
 to have met you to now know you and to start calling you a friend.

2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:31.240
 Thank you for what you do for the world and for me included.

2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:34.240
 Thank you, Matt. Take care.

2:47:34.240 --> 2:47:37.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matt Walker

2:47:37.240 --> 2:47:40.240
 and thank you to stamps.com, Squarespace,

2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:43.240
 Let It Greens, BetterHelp, and On It.

2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:46.240
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:50.240
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Nikola Tesla

2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:54.240
 who we discussed in this podcast as sleeping very few hours a night.

2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:59.240
 All that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated, and suppressed

2:47:59.240 --> 2:48:05.240
 only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle.

2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:10.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
