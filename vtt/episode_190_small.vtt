 The following is a conversation with Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at University of

00:04.640 --> 00:10.800
 Wisconsin and an author who masterfully reveals the beauty and power of mathematics in his

00:10.800 --> 00:17.440
 2014 book, How Not to Be Wrong, and his new book, just released recently called Shape,

00:17.440 --> 00:23.280
 The Hidden Geometry of Information, Biology, Strategy, Democracy, and Everything Else.

00:23.280 --> 00:29.760
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.480
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.280
 As a side note, let me say that geometry is what made me fall in love with mathematics

00:37.280 --> 00:42.400
 when I was young. It first showed me that something definitive could be stated about this

00:42.400 --> 00:48.720
 world through intuitive visual proofs. Somehow, that convinced me that math is not just abstract

00:48.720 --> 00:55.040
 numbers devoid of life, but a part of life, part of this world, part of our search for meaning.

00:55.040 --> 01:00.640
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Jordan Ellenberg.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.160
 If the brain is a cake. It is.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.080
 Let's just go with me on this. Okay. We'll pause it.

01:08.080 --> 01:17.520
 So, for Noam Chomsky, language, the universal grammar, the framework from which language springs

01:17.520 --> 01:24.080
 is like most of the cake, the delicious chocolate center, and then the rest of cognition that we

01:24.080 --> 01:31.520
 think of is built on top, extra layers, maybe the icing on the cake, maybe consciousness is

01:31.520 --> 01:39.360
 just like a cherry on top. Where do you put in this cake mathematical thinking? Is it as fundamental

01:39.360 --> 01:45.200
 as language? In the Chomsky view, is it more fundamental in the language? Is it echoes of

01:45.200 --> 01:49.680
 the same kind of abstract framework that he's thinking about in terms of language that they're

01:49.680 --> 01:55.760
 all really tightly interconnected? That's a really interesting question. You're getting me to reflect

01:55.760 --> 02:01.680
 on this question of whether the feeling of producing mathematical output, if you want,

02:01.680 --> 02:05.680
 is like the process of uttering language or producing linguistic output.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.360
 I think it feels something like that, and it's certainly the case. Let me put it this way. It's

02:11.360 --> 02:18.880
 hard to imagine doing mathematics in a completely non linguistic way. It's hard to imagine doing

02:18.880 --> 02:24.960
 mathematics without talking about mathematics and thinking and propositions. Maybe it's just

02:24.960 --> 02:28.320
 because that's the way I do mathematics that maybe I can't imagine it any other way.

02:29.440 --> 02:36.880
 Well, what about visualizing shapes, visualizing concepts to which language is not obviously

02:36.880 --> 02:42.400
 attachable? That's a really interesting question. One thing it reminds me of is one thing I talk

02:42.400 --> 02:48.000
 about in the book is dissection proofs, these very beautiful proofs of geometric propositions.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.440
 There's a very famous one by Baskara of the Pythagorean theorem. Proofs which are purely

02:55.440 --> 03:02.080
 visual, proofs where you show that two quantities are the same by taking the same pieces and putting

03:02.080 --> 03:07.840
 them together one way and making one shape and putting them together another way and making a

03:07.840 --> 03:11.040
 different shape and then observing that those two shapes must have the same area because they were

03:11.040 --> 03:18.400
 built out of the same pieces. There's a famous story and it's a little bit disputed about how

03:18.400 --> 03:22.560
 accurate this is, but that in Baskara's manuscript he gives this proof, just gives the diagram and

03:22.560 --> 03:32.160
 then the entire verbal content of the proof is he just writes under it, behold. There's some dispute

03:32.160 --> 03:38.080
 about exactly how accurate that is. Then there's an interesting question. If your proof is a diagram,

03:38.080 --> 03:42.800
 if your proof is a picture or even if your proof is a movie of the same pieces coming together

03:42.800 --> 03:46.000
 in two different formations to make two different things, is that language? I'm not sure I have

03:46.000 --> 03:54.320
 a good answer. What do you think? I think it is. I think the process of manipulating the visual

03:54.320 --> 04:00.400
 elements is the same as the process of manipulating the elements of language and I think probably

04:00.400 --> 04:06.000
 the manipulating, the aggregation, the stitching stuff together is the important part. It's not

04:06.000 --> 04:11.600
 the actual specific elements. It's more like, to me, language is a process and math is a process.

04:12.720 --> 04:22.160
 It's not just specific symbols. It's inaction. It's ultimately created through action,

04:22.160 --> 04:27.680
 through change, and so you're constantly evolving ideas. Of course, we kind of attach,

04:27.680 --> 04:31.920
 there's a certain destination you arrive to that you attach to and you call that a proof,

04:31.920 --> 04:36.880
 but that doesn't need to end there. It's just at the end of the chapter and then it goes on

04:36.880 --> 04:42.080
 and on and on in that kind of way. But I got to ask you about geometry and it's a prominent

04:42.080 --> 04:49.440
 topic in your new book shape. For me, geometry is the thing, just like as you're saying,

04:49.440 --> 04:55.520
 made me fall in love with mathematics when I was young. Being able to prove something visually

04:55.520 --> 05:03.280
 just did something to my brain that had planted this hopeful seed that you can

05:03.840 --> 05:10.320
 understand the world perfectly. Maybe it's an OCD thing, but from a mathematics perspective,

05:10.320 --> 05:15.920
 like humans are messy, the world is messy, biology is messy, your parents are yelling or

05:15.920 --> 05:20.880
 making you do stuff, but you can cut through all that BS and truly understand the world

05:20.880 --> 05:27.520
 through mathematics and nothing like geometry did that for me. For you, you did not immediately

05:27.520 --> 05:35.280
 fall in love with geometry. So how do you think about geometry? Why is it a special field in

05:35.280 --> 05:41.600
 mathematics and how did you fall in love with it if you have? Wow, you've given me a lot to say

05:41.600 --> 05:47.120
 and certainly the experience that you describe is so typical, but there's two versions of it.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.480
 One thing I say in the book is that geometry is the cilantro of math. People are not neutral

05:52.480 --> 05:57.120
 about it. There's people who are like you, the rest of it, I could take or leave, but then at

05:57.120 --> 06:01.680
 this one moment, it made sense. This class made sense. Why wasn't it all like that? There's other

06:01.680 --> 06:06.240
 people I can tell you because they come and talk to me all the time who are like, I understood

06:06.240 --> 06:08.880
 all the stuff where you're trying to figure out what X was. There's some mystery, you're trying

06:08.880 --> 06:12.800
 to solve it. X is the number, I figured it out, but then there was this geometry. What was that?

06:12.800 --> 06:16.480
 What happened that year? I didn't get it. I was lost the whole year and I didn't understand

06:16.480 --> 06:21.360
 why we even spent the time doing that. What everybody agrees on is that it's somehow different.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.960
 There's something special about it. We're going to walk around in circles a little bit,

06:26.960 --> 06:33.200
 but we'll get there. You asked me how I fell in love with math. I have a story about this.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.400
 When I was a small child, I don't know, maybe like I was six or seven, I don't know.

06:40.400 --> 06:45.600
 I'm from the 70s. I think you're from a different decade than that. In the 70s,

06:45.600 --> 06:50.960
 we had a cool wooden box around your stereo. That was the look. Everything was dark wood.

06:51.600 --> 06:58.480
 The box had a bunch of holes in it to let the sound out. The holes were in this rectangular

06:58.480 --> 07:05.920
 array, a six by eight array of holes. I was just zoning out in the living room as kids do,

07:05.920 --> 07:12.480
 looking at this six by eight rectangular array of holes. If you like just by focusing in and

07:12.480 --> 07:17.520
 out, just by looking at this box, looking at this rectangle, I was like, well, there's

07:18.640 --> 07:24.800
 six rows of eight holes each, but there's also eight columns of six holes each.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.800
 Eight sixes and six eights. It's just like the dissection proofs we were just talking about,

07:30.800 --> 07:34.720
 but it's the same holes. It's the same 48 holes. That's how many there are, no matter

07:34.720 --> 07:40.560
 whether you count them as rows or count them as columns. This was unbelievable to me.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.280
 Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast? I don't know if that's...

07:43.280 --> 07:43.760
 Oh, fuck yes.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.120
 Are we FCC regulated?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.840
 Okay. It was fucking unbelievable. Okay. That's the last time.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.240
 Get it in there.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.440
 This story merits it.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.520
 So two different perspectives and the same physical reality.

07:54.160 --> 08:01.120
 Exactly. It's just as you say. I knew the six times eight was the same as eight times six.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.680
 Right? I knew my times table. I knew that that was a fact, but did I really know it

08:05.680 --> 08:11.440
 until that moment? That's the question. I knew that the times table was symmetric,

08:11.440 --> 08:14.480
 but I didn't know why that was the case until that moment. And in that moment,

08:14.480 --> 08:18.240
 I could see like, oh, I didn't have to have somebody tell me that. That's information

08:18.240 --> 08:22.320
 that you can just directly access. That's a really amazing moment. And as math teachers,

08:22.320 --> 08:26.160
 that's something that we're really trying to bring to our students. And I was one of those

08:26.160 --> 08:32.480
 who did not love the kind of Euclidean geometry ninth grade class of like, prove that an isosceles

08:32.480 --> 08:36.640
 triangle has equal angles at the base, like this kind of thing. It didn't vibe with me the way that

08:36.640 --> 08:41.680
 algebra and numbers did. But if you go back to that moment, from my adult perspective,

08:41.680 --> 08:45.680
 looking back at what happened with that rectangle, I think that is a very geometric moment. In fact,

08:45.680 --> 08:54.720
 that moment exactly encapsulates the intertwining of algebra and geometry. This algebraic fact that,

08:54.720 --> 08:58.720
 well, in the instance, eight times six is equal to six times eight. But in general,

08:58.720 --> 09:02.480
 that whatever two numbers you have, you multiply them one way, and it's the same as if you multiply

09:02.480 --> 09:07.920
 them in the other order, it attaches it to this geometric fact about a rectangle, which in some

09:07.920 --> 09:11.840
 sense makes it true. So, you know, who knows, maybe I was always fated to be an algebraic

09:11.840 --> 09:17.440
 geometry, which is what I am as a researcher. So that's the kind of transformation. And you

09:17.440 --> 09:24.800
 talk about symmetry in your book. What the heck is symmetry? What the heck is these kinds of

09:24.800 --> 09:30.000
 transformation on objects that once you transform them, they seem to be similar? What do you make

09:30.000 --> 09:34.400
 of it? What's its use in mathematics or maybe broadly in understanding our world?

09:35.200 --> 09:40.080
 Well, it's an absolutely fundamental concept. And it starts with the word symmetry in the way

09:40.080 --> 09:43.520
 that we usually use it when we're just like talking English and not talking mathematics,

09:43.520 --> 09:48.320
 right? Sort of something is, when we say something is symmetrical, we usually means it has what's

09:48.320 --> 09:52.400
 called an axis of symmetry. Maybe like the left half of it looks the same as the right half,

09:52.400 --> 09:56.880
 that would be like a left, right axis of symmetry, or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half,

09:56.880 --> 10:00.240
 or both, right? Maybe there's sort of a fourfold symmetry where the top looks like the bottom

10:00.240 --> 10:04.960
 and the left looks like the right. Or more, and that can take you in a lot of different

10:05.600 --> 10:10.240
 directions, the abstract study of what the possible combinations of symmetries there are,

10:10.240 --> 10:14.720
 a subject which is called group theory was actually one of my first loves in mathematics

10:14.720 --> 10:20.720
 what I thought about a lot when I was in college. But the notion of symmetry is actually much more

10:20.720 --> 10:24.880
 general than the things that we would call symmetry if we were looking at like a classical

10:24.880 --> 10:32.880
 building or a painting or something like that. You know, nowadays in math,

10:32.880 --> 10:42.400
 we could use a symmetry to refer to any kind of transformation of an image or a space or an

10:42.400 --> 10:50.480
 object. You know, so what I talk about in the book is take a figure and stretch it vertically.

10:50.480 --> 11:00.000
 Make it twice as big vertically and make it half as wide. That I would call a symmetry.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.240
 It's not a symmetry in the classical sense, but it's a well defined transformation that

11:06.240 --> 11:11.360
 has an input and an output. I give you some shape and it gets kind of, I call this in the

11:11.360 --> 11:14.640
 book a scrunch. I just made out to have to make up some sort of funny sounding name for it because

11:14.640 --> 11:22.720
 it doesn't really have a name. And just as you can sort of study which kinds of objects are

11:22.720 --> 11:27.680
 symmetrical under the operations of switching left and right or switching top and bottom or

11:27.680 --> 11:34.000
 rotating 40 degrees or what have you, you could study what kinds of things are preserved by

11:34.880 --> 11:40.400
 this kind of scrunch symmetry and this kind of more general idea of what a symmetry can be.

11:42.400 --> 11:48.880
 Let me put it this way. A fundamental mathematical idea, in some sense, I might even say the idea

11:48.880 --> 11:52.720
 that dominates contemporary mathematics. Or by contemporary, by the way, I mean like the

11:52.720 --> 11:57.200
 last like 150 years. We're on a very long time scale in math. I don't mean like yesterday. I mean

11:57.200 --> 12:03.200
 like a century or so up till now. Is this idea that it's a fundamental question of when do we

12:03.200 --> 12:10.000
 consider two things to be the same? That might seem like a complete triviality. It's not. For

12:10.000 --> 12:15.040
 instance, if I have a triangle, and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions, but it's

12:15.040 --> 12:20.560
 over here, are those the same or different? Well, you might say like, well, look, there's two different

12:20.560 --> 12:24.080
 things. This one's over here. This one's over there. On the other hand, if you prove a theorem

12:24.080 --> 12:29.200
 about this one, it's probably still true about this one. If it has like all the same side lanes

12:29.200 --> 12:33.200
 and angles and like looks exactly the same, the term of art, if you want it, you would say they're

12:33.200 --> 12:38.560
 congruent. But one way of saying it is there's a symmetry called translation, which just means

12:38.560 --> 12:44.480
 move everything three inches to the left. And we want all of our theories to be translation

12:44.480 --> 12:48.960
 invariant. What that means is that if you prove a theorem about a thing that's over here, and then

12:48.960 --> 12:53.680
 you move it three inches to the left, it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems like didn't

12:53.680 --> 12:59.520
 still work. So this question of like, what are the symmetries and which things that you want to

12:59.520 --> 13:02.800
 study are invariant under those symmetries is absolutely fundamental. Boy, this is getting a

13:02.800 --> 13:08.880
 little abstract, right? It's not at all abstract. I think this is completely central to everything

13:08.880 --> 13:13.360
 I think about in terms of artificial intelligence. I don't know if you know about the MNIST dataset

13:13.360 --> 13:22.960
 with handwritten digits. And I don't smoke much weed or any really, but it certainly feels like

13:22.960 --> 13:27.360
 it when I look at MNIST and think about this stuff, which is like, what's the difference between one

13:27.360 --> 13:33.440
 and two? And why are all the twos similar to each other? What kind of transformations

13:34.400 --> 13:40.560
 are within the category of what makes a thing the same? And what kind of transformations

13:40.560 --> 13:46.160
 are those that make a different and symmetries core to that? In fact, whatever the hell our brain

13:46.160 --> 13:52.240
 is doing, it's really good at constructing these arbitrary and sometimes novel, which is really

13:52.240 --> 13:59.680
 important when you look at like the IQ test or they feel novel ideas of symmetry of like what,

13:59.680 --> 14:05.760
 like playing with objects, we're able to see things that are the same and not

14:06.880 --> 14:13.360
 and construct almost like little geometric theories of what makes things the same and not

14:13.360 --> 14:20.800
 and how to make programs do that in AI is a total open question. And so I kind of stared

14:20.800 --> 14:29.600
 and wonder how, what kind of symmetries are enough to solve the MNIST handwritten digit

14:29.600 --> 14:34.480
 recognition problem and write that down? And exactly. And what's so fascinating about the work in that

14:34.480 --> 14:41.600
 direction from the point of view of a mathematician like me in a geometry is that the kind of groups

14:41.600 --> 14:46.080
 and of symmetries, the types of symmetries that we know of are not sufficient, right? So in other

14:46.080 --> 14:52.080
 words, like, we're just going to keep on going into the weeds on this. The deeper the better.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.040
 You know, a kind of symmetry that we understand very well is rotation, right? So here's what

14:57.040 --> 15:03.760
 would be easy if humans, if we recognized a digit as a one, if it was like literally a rotation by

15:03.760 --> 15:09.280
 some number of degrees of some fixed one in some typeface like Palatino or something,

15:10.240 --> 15:14.080
 that would be very easy to understand, right? It would be very easy to like write a program that

15:14.080 --> 15:21.280
 could detect whether something was a rotation of a fixed digit one. Whatever we're doing when

15:21.280 --> 15:26.640
 you recognize the digit one and distinguish it from the digit two, it's not that. It's not just

15:26.640 --> 15:35.360
 incorporating one of the types of symmetries that we understand. Now, I would say that I would be

15:35.360 --> 15:42.880
 shocked if there was some kind of classical symmetry type formulation that captured what we're

15:42.880 --> 15:47.600
 doing when we tell the difference between a two and a three, to be honest. I think what we're

15:47.600 --> 15:53.120
 doing is actually more complicated than that. I feel like it must be. They're so simple, these

15:53.120 --> 15:58.960
 numbers. I mean, they're really geometric objects. Like, we can draw out one, two, three. It does

15:58.960 --> 16:04.080
 seem like it should be formalizable. That's why it's so strange. Do you think it's formalizable

16:04.080 --> 16:07.760
 when something stops being a two and starts being a three, right? You can imagine something

16:07.760 --> 16:16.800
 continuously deforming from being a two to a three. Yeah, but there is a moment. I have myself a

16:16.800 --> 16:23.040
 written program that literally morphed twos and threes and so on. You watch and there's moments

16:23.040 --> 16:31.440
 that you notice depending on the trajectory of that transformation, that morphing, that it is a

16:31.440 --> 16:36.160
 three and a two. There's a hard line. Wait, so if you ask people, if you showed them this morph,

16:36.160 --> 16:39.280
 if you ask a bunch of people, do they all agree about where the transition happened?

16:39.280 --> 16:42.800
 Because I would be surprised. I think so. Oh my God. Okay, we have an empirical view.

16:42.800 --> 16:49.760
 But here's the problem. Here's the problem that if I just showed that moment that I agreed on.

16:50.640 --> 16:55.040
 Well, that's not fair. No, but say I said, so I want to move away from the agreement because

16:55.040 --> 16:59.840
 that's a fascinating actually question that I want to backtrack from because I just

16:59.840 --> 17:07.520
 dogmatically said because I could be very, very wrong. But the morphing really helps

17:08.160 --> 17:12.720
 that like the change because I mean partially because our perception systems,

17:12.720 --> 17:17.920
 see this, it's all probably tied in there. Somehow the change from one to the other,

17:17.920 --> 17:22.480
 like seeing the video of it allows you to pinpoint the place where a two becomes a three

17:22.480 --> 17:30.960
 much better. If I just showed you one picture, I think you might really, really struggle. You

17:30.960 --> 17:39.360
 might call a seven. I think there's something also that we don't often think about, which is

17:39.360 --> 17:45.120
 it's not just about the static image. It's the transformation of the image or it's not a static

17:45.120 --> 17:51.440
 shape. It's the transformation of the shape. There's something in the movement that seems to be

17:51.440 --> 17:55.600
 not just about our perception system, but fundamental to our cognition, like how we think

17:56.160 --> 18:02.400
 about stuff. Yeah. That's part of geometry too. And in fact, again, another insight of

18:02.400 --> 18:06.720
 modern geometry is this idea that maybe we would naively think we're going to study,

18:07.440 --> 18:10.880
 I don't know, like Poincaré, we're going to study the three body problem. We're going to study

18:10.880 --> 18:16.080
 sort of like three objects in space moving around subject only to the force of each other's gravity,

18:16.080 --> 18:19.120
 which sounds very simple, right? And if you don't know about this problem, you're probably like,

18:19.120 --> 18:22.880
 okay, so you just put it in your computer and see what they do. Well, guess what? That's a

18:22.880 --> 18:27.360
 problem that Poincaré won a huge prize for, making the first real progress on in the 1880s.

18:27.360 --> 18:34.800
 And we still don't know that much about it 150 years later. I mean, it's the mongest mystery.

18:34.800 --> 18:40.160
 You just opened the door and we're going to walk right in before we return to symmetry.

18:40.800 --> 18:45.600
 What's the, who's Poincaré and what's this conjecture that he came up with?

18:45.600 --> 18:52.160
 And why is it such a hard problem? Okay, so Poincaré, he ends up being a major figure in

18:52.160 --> 18:56.320
 the book. And I didn't even really intend for him to be such a big figure, but he's so, he's,

18:58.080 --> 19:02.560
 he's first and foremost a geometer, right? So he's a mathematician who kind of comes up

19:02.560 --> 19:09.280
 in late 19th century France at a time when French math is really starting to flower.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.560
 Actually, I learned a lot. I mean, you know, in math, we're not really trained on our own history.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.400
 We get a PhD in math and learn about math. So I learned a lot. There's this whole kind of

19:17.600 --> 19:22.320
 moment where France has just been beaten in the Franco, Prussian war. And they're like,

19:22.320 --> 19:26.320
 oh my God, what did we do wrong? And they were like, we got to get strong in math,

19:26.320 --> 19:29.760
 like the Germans, we have to be like more like the Germans. So this never happens to us again.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.960
 So it's very much, it's like the Sputnik moment, you know, like what happens in America in the

19:32.960 --> 19:37.680
 50s and 60s with the Soviet Union, this is happening to France. And they're trying to kind of like,

19:37.680 --> 19:44.160
 instantly like modernize. That's fascinating. The humans and mathematics are intricately connected

19:44.160 --> 19:52.640
 to the history of humans. The Cold War is, I think, fundamental to the way people saw science and

19:52.640 --> 19:57.040
 math in the Soviet Union. I don't know if that was true in the United States, but certainly

19:57.040 --> 20:00.640
 wasn't the Soviet Union. It definitely was. And I would love to hear more about how it was in the

20:00.640 --> 20:08.320
 Soviet Union. I mean, we'll talk about the Olympiad. I just remember that there was this feeling

20:09.680 --> 20:20.160
 like the world hung in a balance and you could save the world with the tools of science. And

20:20.160 --> 20:29.440
 mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science. And so like people were seen as, you

20:29.440 --> 20:35.280
 know, people in America often idolized athletes. But ultimately, the best athletes in the world,

20:36.800 --> 20:43.760
 they just throw a ball into a basket. So like there's not, what people really enjoy about sports,

20:43.760 --> 20:50.160
 and I love sports, is like excellence at the highest level. But when you take that with mathematics

20:50.160 --> 20:55.280
 and science, people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics in the Soviet Union.

20:55.280 --> 20:59.920
 But there's an extra sense that that excellence will lead to a better world.

21:01.360 --> 21:08.800
 So that created all the usual things you think about with the Olympics, which is like

21:09.360 --> 21:15.920
 extreme competitiveness, right? But it also created this sense that in the modern era in America,

21:15.920 --> 21:21.360
 somebody like Elon Musk, whatever you think of them, like Jeff Bezos, those folks,

21:21.360 --> 21:26.960
 they inspire the possibility that one person or a group of smart people can change the world.

21:26.960 --> 21:31.440
 Like not just be good at what they do, but actually change the world. Mathematics was at

21:31.440 --> 21:37.280
 the core of that. And I don't know, there's a romanticism around it too. Like when you read

21:37.280 --> 21:42.480
 books about in America, people romanticize certain things like baseball, for example,

21:42.480 --> 21:48.480
 there's like these beautiful poetic writing about the game of baseball. The same was the

21:48.480 --> 21:54.400
 feeling with mathematics and science in the Soviet Union. And it was in the air. Everybody was forced

21:55.040 --> 22:00.400
 to take high level mathematics courses. Like you took a lot of math. You took a lot of science

22:00.400 --> 22:07.040
 and a lot of like really rigorous literature. Like the level of education in Russia, this could be

22:07.040 --> 22:15.520
 true in China. I'm not sure. In a lot of countries is in whatever that's called, it's K to 12 in

22:15.520 --> 22:23.200
 America. But like young people education, the level they were challenged to learn at is incredible.

22:23.200 --> 22:30.400
 It's like America falls far behind, I would say. America then quickly catches up and then exceeds

22:30.400 --> 22:35.920
 everybody else. As you start approaching the end of high school to college, like the university

22:35.920 --> 22:42.640
 system in the United States arguably is the best in the world. But like what we challenge

22:42.640 --> 22:48.880
 everybody. It's not just like the good, the A students, but everybody to learn in the Soviet

22:48.880 --> 22:52.880
 Union was fascinating. I think I'm going to pick up on something you said. I think you would love

22:52.880 --> 22:58.160
 a book called Duel at Dawn by Amir Alexander, which I think some of the things you're responding

22:58.160 --> 23:02.880
 to what I wrote, I think I first got turned on to by Amir's work. He's a historian of math,

23:02.880 --> 23:07.440
 and he writes about the story of Everdeast Galois, which is a story that's well known to all

23:07.440 --> 23:16.560
 mathematicians, this kind of like very, very romantic figure who he really sort of like begins

23:16.560 --> 23:20.560
 the development of this, or this theory of groups that I mentioned earlier, this general

23:21.200 --> 23:26.160
 theory of symmetries, and then dies in a duel in his early 20s, like all this stuff

23:26.960 --> 23:33.280
 mostly unpublished. It's a very, very romantic story that we all learn. And much of it is true,

23:33.280 --> 23:40.320
 but Alexander really lays out just how much the way people thought about math in those times in

23:40.320 --> 23:44.880
 the early 19th century was wound up with, as you say, romanticism. I mean, that's when the

23:44.880 --> 23:51.360
 romantic movement takes place. And he really outlines how people were predisposed to think

23:51.360 --> 23:54.640
 about mathematics in that way because they thought about poetry that way, and they thought about

23:54.640 --> 23:59.760
 music that way. It was the mood of the era to think about we're reaching for the transcendent,

23:59.760 --> 24:04.480
 we're sort of reaching for sort of direct contact with the divine. And so part of the reason that

24:04.480 --> 24:08.880
 we think of Galois that way was because Galois himself was a creature of that era, and he

24:08.880 --> 24:13.920
 romanticized himself. I mean, now we know he wrote lots of letters and he was kind of like,

24:13.920 --> 24:19.840
 I mean, in modern times, we would say he was extremely emo. We wrote all these letters about

24:19.840 --> 24:26.240
 his like florid feelings and like the fire within him about the mathematics. So it's just as you say

24:26.240 --> 24:31.600
 that the math history touches human history. They're never separate because math is made of

24:31.600 --> 24:37.200
 people. I mean, that's what it's people who do it and we're human beings doing it and we do it

24:37.200 --> 24:44.000
 within whatever community we're in and we do it affected by the mores of the society around us.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.960
 So the French, the Germans and Poincaré. Yes. Okay. So back to Poincaré. So

24:48.960 --> 24:56.000
 he's, you know, it's funny, this book is filled with kind of, you know, mathematical characters who

24:57.200 --> 25:03.840
 often are kind of peevish or get into feuds or sort of have like weird enthousiasms because

25:03.840 --> 25:08.400
 those people are fun to write about and they sort of like say very salty things. Poincaré

25:08.400 --> 25:13.840
 is actually none of this. As far as I can tell, he was an extremely normal dude. He didn't get

25:13.840 --> 25:18.160
 into fights with people and everybody liked him and he was like pretty personally modest and he

25:18.160 --> 25:23.600
 had very regular habits, you know what I mean? He did math for like four hours in the morning

25:23.600 --> 25:28.800
 and four hours in the evening and that was it. Like he had his schedule. I actually, it was like,

25:29.600 --> 25:33.360
 I still am feeling like somebody's going to tell me now that the book is out like,

25:33.360 --> 25:37.760
 oh, didn't you know about this like incredibly sorted episode of this? As far as I can tell,

25:38.640 --> 25:46.880
 a completely normal guy, but he just kind of in many ways creates the geometric world

25:46.880 --> 25:54.000
 in which we live and, you know, his first really big success is this prize paper he writes for this

25:54.000 --> 26:02.240
 prize offered by the King of Sweden for the study of the three body problem. The study of what we

26:02.240 --> 26:08.240
 can say about, yeah, three astronomical objects moving in what you might think would be this

26:08.240 --> 26:13.680
 very simple way. Nothing's going on except gravity relating. So what's the three body problem? Why

26:13.680 --> 26:19.840
 is it a problem? So the problem is to understand when this motion is stable and when it's not.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.120
 So stable meaning they would sort of like end up in some kind of periodic

26:23.120 --> 26:27.280
 orbit or I guess it would mean, sorry, stable would mean they never sort of fly off far apart

26:27.280 --> 26:30.640
 from each other and unstable would mean like eventually they fly apart. So understanding

26:30.640 --> 26:37.840
 two bodies is much easier. Yeah, exactly. Two bodies. Newton knew two bodies, they sort of

26:37.840 --> 26:42.320
 orbit each other in some kind of either in an ellipse, which is the stable case, you know,

26:42.320 --> 26:49.440
 that's what planets do that we know. Or one travels on a hyperbola around the other. That's

26:49.440 --> 26:53.040
 the unstable case. It sort of like zooms in from far away, sort of like whips around the

26:53.600 --> 26:59.040
 heavier thing and like zooms out. Those are basically the two options. So it's a very simple

26:59.040 --> 27:04.400
 and easy to classify story. With three bodies, just a small switch from two to three, it's a

27:04.400 --> 27:08.320
 complete zoo. It's the first, what we would say now is it's the first example of what's called

27:08.320 --> 27:13.280
 chaotic dynamics, where the stable solutions and the unstable solutions, they're kind of

27:13.280 --> 27:18.080
 like wound in among each other and a very, very, very tiny change in the initial conditions can

27:18.080 --> 27:22.240
 make the long term behavior of the system completely different. So Poincare was the first

27:22.240 --> 27:30.000
 to recognize that phenomenon even existed. What about the conjecture that carries his name?

27:30.000 --> 27:41.360
 Right. So he also was one of the pioneers of taking geometry, which until that point

27:41.360 --> 27:45.760
 had been largely the study of two and three dimensional objects, because that's like

27:46.320 --> 27:49.040
 what we see, right? That's those are the objects we interact with.

27:51.200 --> 27:56.240
 He developed the subject we now call topology. He called it analysis C2s. He was a very

27:56.240 --> 28:00.560
 well spoken guy with a lot of slogans, but that name did not, you can see why that name did not

28:00.560 --> 28:07.280
 catch on. So now it's called topology now. Sorry, what was it called before? Analysis C2s,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.520
 which I guess sort of roughly means like the analysis of location or something like that.

28:12.720 --> 28:21.040
 It's a Latin phrase. Partly because he understood that even to understand stuff that's going on

28:21.040 --> 28:25.600
 in our physical world, you have to study higher dimensional spaces. How does this work? And this

28:25.600 --> 28:29.680
 is kind of like where my brain went to it because you were talking about not just where things are,

28:29.680 --> 28:33.360
 but what their path is, how they're moving when we were talking about the path from two to three.

28:34.640 --> 28:38.400
 He understood that if you want to study three bodies moving in space,

28:39.440 --> 28:45.760
 well, each body, it has a location where it is, so it has an x coordinate, a y coordinate,

28:45.760 --> 28:49.280
 a z coordinate, right? I can specify a point in space by giving you three numbers,

28:49.280 --> 28:55.680
 but it also at each moment has a velocity. So it turns out that really to understand what's

28:55.680 --> 29:00.640
 going on, you can't think of it as a point or you could, but it's better not to think of it as a

29:00.640 --> 29:04.720
 point in three dimensional space that's moving. It's better to think of it as a point in six

29:04.720 --> 29:09.200
 dimensional space where the coordinates are where is it and what's its velocity right now.

29:09.200 --> 29:13.040
 That's a higher dimensional space called phase space. And if you haven't thought about this before,

29:13.040 --> 29:21.440
 I admit that it's a little bit mind bending, but what he needed then was a geometry that was flexible

29:21.440 --> 29:26.560
 enough, not just to talk about two dimensional spaces or three dimensional spaces, but any

29:26.560 --> 29:30.240
 dimensional space. So the sort of famous first line of this paper where he introduces analysis

29:30.240 --> 29:37.040
 situs is no one doubts nowadays that the geometry of n dimensional space is an actually existing

29:37.040 --> 29:40.480
 thing, right? I think that maybe that had been controversial and he's saying like,

29:40.480 --> 29:43.920
 look, let's face it, just because it's not physical, doesn't mean it's not there. It

29:43.920 --> 29:49.600
 doesn't mean we shouldn't study it. Interesting. He wasn't jumping to the physical interpretation.

29:50.480 --> 29:57.040
 It can be real even if it's not perceivable to human cognition. I think that's right. I think,

29:57.600 --> 30:02.000
 don't get me wrong, Poincaré never strays far from physics. He's always motivated by physics,

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
 but the physics drove him to need to think about spaces of higher dimension. And so he needed a

30:08.000 --> 30:12.240
 formalism that was rich enough to enable him to do that. And once you do that, that formalism is

30:12.240 --> 30:15.840
 also going to include things that are not physical. And then you have two choices. You can be like,

30:15.840 --> 30:20.640
 oh, well, that stuff's trash. Or, and this is more the mathematician's frame of mind.

30:21.200 --> 30:26.560
 If you have a formalistic framework that seems really good and sort of seems to be very elegant

30:26.560 --> 30:30.400
 and work well, and it includes all the physical stuff, maybe we should think about all of it.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.360
 Like maybe we should think about it thinking, maybe there's some gold to be mined there.

30:33.360 --> 30:39.280
 And indeed, guess what? Before long, there's relativity and there's space time. And all

30:39.280 --> 30:43.360
 of a sudden, it's like, oh, yeah, maybe it's a good idea. We already had this geometric apparatus

30:43.360 --> 30:48.480
 set up for how to think about four dimensional spaces. It turns out they're real after all.

30:49.120 --> 30:53.520
 This is a story much told in mathematics, not just in this context, but in many.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.720
 I'd love to dig in a little deeper on that, actually, because I have some

30:56.720 --> 31:03.440
 intuitions to work out. Okay, my brain. Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,

31:03.440 --> 31:10.000
 so we can work out together. Good. We'll together walk along the path of curiosity.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.200
 But Poincaré conjecture, what is it? The Poincaré conjecture is about curved

31:17.200 --> 31:24.960
 three dimensional spaces. So I was on my way there, I promise. The idea is that we perceive

31:24.960 --> 31:29.840
 ourselves as living in, we don't say a three dimensional space, we just say three dimensional

31:29.840 --> 31:33.040
 space, you know, you can go up and down, you can go left and right, you can go forward and back,

31:33.040 --> 31:38.880
 there's three dimensions in which we can move. In Poincaré's theory, there are many possible

31:39.680 --> 31:46.400
 three dimensional spaces in the same way that going down one dimension to sort of capture

31:46.400 --> 31:50.720
 our intuition a little bit more. We know there are lots of different two dimensional surfaces,

31:50.720 --> 31:55.360
 right? There's a balloon and that looks one way, and a donut looks another way,

31:55.360 --> 31:59.280
 and a mobius strip looks a third way. Those are all like two dimensional surfaces that we can

31:59.280 --> 32:04.320
 kind of really get a global view of because we live in three dimensional space, so we can see

32:04.320 --> 32:08.080
 a two dimensional surface sort of sitting in our three dimensional space. Well, to see a three

32:08.080 --> 32:13.520
 dimensional space whole, we'd have to kind of have four dimensional eyes, right, which we don't.

32:13.520 --> 32:18.640
 So we have to use our mathematical eyes, we have to envision. The Poincaré conjecture

32:18.640 --> 32:24.160
 says that there's a very simple way to determine whether a three dimensional space

32:26.400 --> 32:31.760
 is the standard one, the one that we're used to. And essentially, it's that it's what's called

32:31.760 --> 32:36.000
 fundamental group has nothing interesting in it. And that I can actually say without saying what

32:36.000 --> 32:39.520
 the fundamental group is, I can tell you what the criterion is. This would be good. Oh, look,

32:39.520 --> 32:42.880
 I can even use a visual aid. So for the people watching this on YouTube, you'll just see this,

32:42.880 --> 32:48.160
 for the people on the podcast, you'll have to visualize it. So Lex has been nice enough to like

32:48.160 --> 32:53.200
 give me a surface with an interesting topology, some mug right here in front of me, a mug. Yes,

32:53.200 --> 32:56.480
 I might say it's a genus one surface, but we could also say it's a mug, same thing.

32:58.480 --> 33:04.240
 So if I were to draw a little circle on this mug, which way should I draw it? So it's visible,

33:04.240 --> 33:08.320
 like here. Yeah, that's yeah, if I draw a little circle on this mug, imagine this to be a loop of

33:08.320 --> 33:14.880
 string, I could pull that loop of string closed on the surface of the mug, right? That's definitely

33:14.880 --> 33:19.040
 something I could do. I could shrink it, shrink it, shrink it until it's a point. On the other hand,

33:19.040 --> 33:23.440
 if I draw a loop that goes around the handle, I can kind of just it up here and I can just

33:23.440 --> 33:26.800
 it down there and I can sort of slide it up and down the handle, but I can't pull it closed,

33:26.800 --> 33:31.440
 can I? It's trapped. Not without breaking the surface of the mug, right? Not without like going

33:31.440 --> 33:38.560
 inside. So the condition of being what's called simply connected, this is one of punk erase

33:38.560 --> 33:43.920
 inventions, says that any loop of string can be pulled shut. So it's a feature that the mug

33:43.920 --> 33:49.840
 simply does not have. This is a non simply connected mug and a simply connected mug would

33:49.840 --> 33:54.000
 be a cup, right? You would burn your hand when you drank coffee out of it. So you're saying the

33:54.000 --> 34:00.320
 universe is not a mug? Well, I can't speak to the universe, but what I can say is that

34:02.560 --> 34:07.840
 regular old space is not a mug. Regular old space, if you like sort of actually physically have like

34:07.840 --> 34:12.720
 a loop of string. You can always close it. You can pull a shot. You can always pull a shot. But you

34:12.720 --> 34:16.320
 know, what if your piece of string was the size of the universe? What if your piece of string was

34:16.320 --> 34:20.960
 like billions of light years long? Like, how do you actually know? I mean, that's still an open

34:20.960 --> 34:26.880
 question of the shape of the universe. Exactly. Whether it's, I think there's a lot, there is

34:26.880 --> 34:32.240
 ideas of it being a tourist. I mean, there's some trippy ideas and they're not like weird

34:32.240 --> 34:38.880
 out there controversial. There's a legitimate at the center of cosmology debate. I mean, I think

34:38.880 --> 34:43.680
 there's some kind of dodecahedral symmetry. I mean, I remember reading something crazy about

34:43.680 --> 34:48.640
 somebody saying that they saw the signature of that in the cosmic noise or what have you. I mean,

34:49.600 --> 34:56.720
 to make the flat earthers happy, I do believe that the current main belief is it's flat.

34:57.520 --> 35:02.320
 It's flat ish or something like that. The shape of the universe is flat ish. I don't know what the

35:02.320 --> 35:08.880
 heck that means. I think that has like a very, I mean, how are you even supposed to think about the

35:08.880 --> 35:15.680
 shape of a thing that doesn't have any thing outside of it? I mean, but that's exactly what

35:15.680 --> 35:20.160
 topology does. Topology is what's called an intrinsic theory. That's what's so great about it.

35:20.160 --> 35:26.000
 This question about the mug, you could answer it without ever leaving the mug, right? Because

35:26.000 --> 35:31.120
 it's a question about a loop drawn on the surface of the mug and what happens if it never leaves

35:31.120 --> 35:37.040
 that surface? So it's like always there. See, but that's the difference between the topology

35:37.680 --> 35:44.800
 and say, if you're like trying to visualize a mug, do you can't visualize a mug while living inside

35:44.800 --> 35:49.440
 the mug? Well, that's true. The visualization is harder, but in some sense, no, you're right,

35:49.440 --> 35:54.160
 but if the tools of mathematics are there, I don't want to fight, but I think the tools of

35:54.160 --> 35:58.160
 mathematics are exactly there to enable you to think about what you cannot visualize in this

35:58.160 --> 36:03.360
 way. Let me give you, always to make things easier, go down a dimension. Let's think about,

36:03.360 --> 36:11.280
 we live on a circle, okay? You can tell whether you live on a circle or a line segment, because

36:11.280 --> 36:14.560
 if you live on a circle, if you walk a long way in one direction, you find yourself back where

36:14.560 --> 36:18.720
 you started. And if you live in a line segment, you walk for a long enough one direction, you

36:18.720 --> 36:23.360
 come to the end of the world. Or if you live on a line, like a whole line, an infinite line,

36:23.360 --> 36:28.240
 then you walk in one direction for a long time. And like, well, then there's not a sort of terminating

36:28.240 --> 36:31.280
 algorithm to figure out whether you live on a line or a circle, but at least you sort of,

36:33.200 --> 36:37.120
 at least you don't discover that you live on a circle. So all of those are intrinsic things,

36:37.120 --> 36:41.360
 right? All of those are things that you can figure out about your world without leaving

36:41.360 --> 36:45.440
 your world. On the other hand, ready, now we're going to go from intrinsic to extrinsic. Why did

36:45.440 --> 36:50.880
 I not know we were going to talk about this, but why not? Why not? If you can't tell whether you

36:50.880 --> 36:56.880
 live in a circle or a knot. Like imagine like a knot floating in three dimensional space. The

36:56.880 --> 37:00.880
 person who lives on that knot, to them it's a circle. They walk a long way, they come back to

37:00.880 --> 37:05.120
 where they started. Now we with our three dimensional eyes can be like, oh, this one's just a plain

37:05.120 --> 37:10.480
 circle and this one's knotted up. But that has to do with how they sit in three dimensional space.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.960
 It doesn't have to do with intrinsic features of those people's world.

37:12.960 --> 37:18.720
 We can ask you one ape to another. How does it make you feel that you don't know if you live

37:18.720 --> 37:26.400
 in a circle or on a knot in a knot inside the string that forms the knot?

37:28.480 --> 37:34.480
 I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know if I fear you won't like this answer,

37:34.480 --> 37:38.480
 but it does not bother me at all. I don't lose one minute of sleep over it.

37:39.200 --> 37:46.000
 So does it bother you that if we look at like a mobius strip, that you don't have an obvious way

37:46.000 --> 37:51.920
 of knowing whether you are inside of a cylinder, if you live on a surface of a cylinder or you

37:51.920 --> 37:57.840
 live on the surface of a mobius strip? No, I think you can tell. If you live,

37:58.400 --> 38:02.960
 if which one? Because if what you do is you like, tell your friend, hey, stay right here,

38:02.960 --> 38:06.480
 I'm just going to go for a walk. And then you like walk for a long time in one direction.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.280
 And then you come back and you see your friend again. And if your friend is reversed, then

38:09.280 --> 38:13.680
 you know you live on a mobius strip. Well, no, because you won't see your friend, right?

38:13.680 --> 38:18.960
 Okay, fair, fair point, fair point on that. But you have to believe his stories about,

38:19.680 --> 38:26.080
 no, I don't even know. I would, would you even know? Would you really? Oh, no, I know your

38:26.080 --> 38:29.600
 point is right. Let me try to think of a better, let's see if I can do this on the fly. It may not

38:29.600 --> 38:36.880
 be correct to talk about cognitive beings living on a mobius strip because there's a lot of things

38:36.880 --> 38:42.160
 taken for granted there. And we're constantly imagining actual like three dimensional creatures,

38:42.160 --> 38:50.000
 like how it actually feels like to live in a mobius strip is tricky to internalize.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
 I think that on what's called the real protective plane, which is kind of even more sort of like

38:54.000 --> 38:58.480
 messed up version of the mobius strip, but with very similar features, this feature of kind of

38:58.480 --> 39:05.040
 like only having one side, that has the feature that there's a loop of string, which can't be

39:05.040 --> 39:11.120
 pulled closed. But if you loop it around twice along the same path, that you can pull closed.

39:11.120 --> 39:17.360
 That's extremely weird. Yeah. But that would be a way you could know without leaving your world that

39:18.560 --> 39:23.120
 something very funny is going on. You know, it's extremely weird. Maybe we can comment on,

39:23.120 --> 39:30.160
 hopefully it's not too much of a tangent is, I remember thinking about this, this might be right,

39:30.160 --> 39:37.120
 this might be wrong. But if you're, if we now talk about a sphere, and you're living inside a sphere,

39:37.120 --> 39:43.280
 that you're going to see everywhere around you the back of your own head.

39:45.600 --> 39:51.520
 That I was, because like, I was, this was very counterintuitive to me to think about,

39:51.520 --> 39:57.760
 maybe it's wrong, but because I was thinking like earth, you know, your 3d thing on sitting on a

39:57.760 --> 40:02.960
 sphere, but if you're living inside the sphere, like you're going to see, if you look straight,

40:02.960 --> 40:07.920
 you're always going to see yourself all the way around. So everywhere you look, there's going

40:07.920 --> 40:12.560
 to be the back of your own head. I think somehow this depends on something of like how the physics

40:12.560 --> 40:16.240
 of light works in this scenario, which I'm sort of finding it hard to bend my. That's true. The

40:16.240 --> 40:20.720
 sea is doing a lot of work, like saying you see something is doing a lot of work. People have

40:20.720 --> 40:25.840
 thought about this. I mean, this metaphor of like, what if we're like little creatures in some sort

40:25.840 --> 40:30.000
 of smaller world, like how could we apprehend what's outside that metaphor just comes back and

40:30.000 --> 40:34.240
 back. And actually, I didn't even realize like how frequent it is. It comes up in the book a lot.

40:34.240 --> 40:38.240
 I know it from a book called Flatland. I don't know if you ever read this when you were a kid

40:38.240 --> 40:44.720
 or an adult, you know, this, this sort of comic novel from the 19th century about an entire

40:45.440 --> 40:50.640
 two dimensional world. It's narrated by a square. That's the main character. And

40:51.680 --> 40:56.480
 the kind of strangeness that befalls him when, you know, one day he's in his house and suddenly

40:56.480 --> 41:01.440
 there's like a little circle there and there with him. And then the circle, but then the circle

41:01.440 --> 41:06.000
 like starts getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And he's like, what the hell is going on? It's

41:06.000 --> 41:10.240
 like a horror movie like for two dimensional people. And of course, what's happening is that a

41:10.240 --> 41:15.280
 sphere is entering his world. And as the sphere kind of like moves farther and farther into the

41:15.280 --> 41:19.840
 plane, it's cross section, the part of it that he can see to him. It looks like there's like this

41:19.840 --> 41:26.560
 kind of bizarre being that's like getting larger and larger and larger until it's exactly sort of

41:26.560 --> 41:29.440
 halfway through. And then they have this kind of like philosophical argument where the sphere is

41:29.440 --> 41:32.000
 like, I'm a sphere. I'm from the third dimension. The square is like, what are you talking about?

41:32.000 --> 41:37.520
 There's no such thing. And they have this kind of like sterile argument where the square is not

41:37.520 --> 41:41.520
 able to kind of like follow the mathematical reasoning of the sphere until the sphere just

41:41.520 --> 41:46.320
 kind of grabs him and like jerks him out of the plane and pulls him up. And it's like, now,

41:46.320 --> 41:51.840
 like now do you see, like now do you see your whole world that you didn't understand before?

41:51.840 --> 41:57.840
 So do you think that kind of process is possible for us humans? So we live in a three dimensional

41:57.840 --> 42:04.800
 world, maybe with a time component, four dimensional. And then math allows us to go

42:05.840 --> 42:09.840
 high into high dimensions comfortably and explore the world from those perspectives.

42:09.840 --> 42:24.320
 Like, is it possible that the universe is many more dimensions than the ones we experience as human

42:24.320 --> 42:30.960
 beings? So if you look at the, you know, especially in physics theories of everything,

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
 physics theories that try to unify general relativity and quantum field theory, they seem to

42:38.000 --> 42:46.320
 go to high dimensions to work stuff out through the tools of mathematics. Is it possible, so like

42:46.320 --> 42:53.520
 the two options are one, it's just a nice way to analyze the universe, but the reality is as

42:53.520 --> 42:59.840
 exactly we perceive it, it is three dimensional. Or are we just seeing, are we those flat land

42:59.840 --> 43:07.040
 creatures? They're just seeing a tiny slice of reality. And the actual reality is many, many,

43:07.040 --> 43:12.320
 many more dimensions than the three dimensions we perceive. Oh, I certainly think that's possible.

43:14.480 --> 43:18.560
 Now, how would you figure out whether it was true or not is another question.

43:20.240 --> 43:25.360
 And I suppose what you would do as with anything else that you can't directly perceive is

43:27.520 --> 43:31.760
 you would try to understand what effect the presence of those extra dimensions

43:31.760 --> 43:37.920
 out there would have on the things we can perceive. Like what else can you do, right?

43:39.120 --> 43:45.680
 And in some sense, if the answer is they would have no effect, then maybe it becomes like a

43:45.680 --> 43:49.520
 little bit of a sterile question because what question are you even asking, right? You can kind

43:49.520 --> 43:57.120
 of posit however many entities that you want. Is it possible to intuit how to mess with the other

43:57.120 --> 44:01.840
 dimensions while living in a three dimensional world? I mean, that seems like a very challenging

44:01.840 --> 44:10.160
 thing to do. The reason flat land could be written is because it's coming from a three dimensional

44:10.160 --> 44:15.040
 writer. Yes, but what happens in the book, I didn't even tell you the whole plot,

44:15.040 --> 44:20.400
 what happens is the square is so excited and so filled with intellectual joy. By the way,

44:20.400 --> 44:25.520
 maybe to give the story some context, you ask like, is it possible for us humans to have this

44:25.520 --> 44:30.400
 experience of being transcendentally jerked out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from

44:30.400 --> 44:34.720
 above? Well, Edwin Abbott, who wrote the book, certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was

44:34.720 --> 44:39.200
 a minister. So the whole Christian subtext of this book, I had completely not grasped

44:40.320 --> 44:44.320
 reading this as a kid, that it means a very different thing, right? If sort of a theologian

44:44.320 --> 44:49.680
 is saying like, oh, what if a higher being could like pull you out of this earthly world you live

44:49.680 --> 44:54.800
 in so that you can sort of see the truth and like really see it from above as it were. So that's

44:54.800 --> 44:58.560
 one of the things that's going on for him. And it's a testament to his skill as a writer that

44:58.560 --> 45:04.080
 his story just works, whether that's the framework you're coming to it from or not.

45:05.120 --> 45:08.800
 But what happens in this book and this part now looking at it through a Christian lens,

45:08.800 --> 45:16.560
 it becomes a bit subversive is the square is so excited about what he's learned from the sphere

45:16.560 --> 45:19.440
 and the sphere explains to him like what a cube would be. Oh, it's like you have a three

45:19.440 --> 45:23.920
 dimensional and the square is very excited and the square is like, okay, I get it now. So like,

45:23.920 --> 45:27.200
 now that you explained to me how just by reason, I can figure out what a cube would be like,

45:27.200 --> 45:31.200
 like a three dimensional version of me, like, let's figure out what a four dimensional version

45:31.200 --> 45:35.040
 of me would be like. And then the sphere is like, what the hell are you talking about? There's a

45:35.040 --> 45:38.480
 fourth dimension, that's ridiculous. Like, there's three dimensions, like that's how many there are,

45:38.480 --> 45:42.320
 I can see. Like, I mean, it's this sort of comic moment where the sphere is completely unable to

45:43.680 --> 45:48.960
 conceptualize that there could actually be yet another dimension. So yeah, that takes the

45:48.960 --> 45:52.640
 religious allegory to like a very weird place that I don't really like understand theologically,

45:52.640 --> 46:00.160
 but that's a nice way to talk about religion and myth. In general, as perhaps us trying to

46:00.160 --> 46:05.440
 struggle with us, meaning human civilization, trying to struggle with ideas that are beyond

46:05.440 --> 46:11.360
 our cognitive capabilities. But it's in fact not beyond our capability, it may be beyond

46:11.360 --> 46:17.680
 our cognitive capabilities to visualize a four dimensional cube, a Tesseract is something like

46:17.680 --> 46:23.040
 to call it, or a five dimensional cube or a six dimensional cube, but it is not beyond our cognitive

46:23.040 --> 46:28.480
 capabilities to figure out how many corners a six dimensional cube would have. That's what's so

46:28.480 --> 46:32.800
 cool about us, whether we can visualize it or not, we can still talk about it, we can still reason

46:32.800 --> 46:39.360
 about it, we can still figure things out about it. That's amazing. Yeah, if we go back to this,

46:40.000 --> 46:44.560
 first of all, to the mug, but to the example you give in the book of the straw,

46:44.560 --> 46:53.600
 how many holes does a straw have? A new listener may try to answer that in your own head.

46:53.600 --> 46:56.960
 Yeah, I'm going to take a drink while everybody thinks about it so we can give you a moment.

46:56.960 --> 47:06.080
 A slow sip. Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe? Maybe you get very creative,

47:06.640 --> 47:14.080
 but it's kind of interesting to dissecting each answer as you do in the book is quite brilliant.

47:14.080 --> 47:19.440
 People should definitely check it out, but if you could try to answer it now, think about all the

47:19.440 --> 47:26.240
 options and why they may or may not be right. Yeah, it's one of these questions where people

47:26.240 --> 47:29.680
 on first hearing it think it's a triviality and they're like, well, the answer is obvious.

47:29.680 --> 47:33.840
 And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people this, something wonderfully comic happens,

47:33.840 --> 47:37.280
 which is that everyone's like, well, it's completely obvious. And then each person

47:37.280 --> 47:41.760
 realizes that half the person, the other people in the room have a different obvious answer,

47:41.760 --> 47:44.960
 for the way they have. And then people get really heated. People are like,

47:44.960 --> 47:49.520
 I can't believe that you think it has two holes or like, I can't believe that you think it has one.

47:49.520 --> 47:53.680
 And then people really learn something about each other and people get heated.

47:54.320 --> 48:00.560
 I mean, can we go through the possible options here? Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?

48:01.200 --> 48:07.600
 Sure. So I think most people, the zero holders are rare. They would say like, well, look,

48:07.600 --> 48:10.880
 you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic and closing it up.

48:10.880 --> 48:16.320
 Rectangular piece of plastic doesn't have a hole in it. I didn't poke a hole in it when I...

48:16.320 --> 48:16.800
 Yeah.

48:16.800 --> 48:21.840
 So how can I have a hole? It's like, it's just one thing. Okay. Most people don't see it that way.

48:21.840 --> 48:25.760
 That's like... Is there any truth to that kind of conception?

48:25.760 --> 48:28.640
 Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's account... I mean,

48:28.640 --> 48:41.440
 what I would say is you could say the same thing about a bagel. You could say I can make a bagel

48:41.440 --> 48:46.560
 by taking like a long cylinder of dough, which doesn't have a hole, and then smushing the ends

48:46.560 --> 48:50.960
 together. Now it's a bagel. So if you're really committed, you can be like, okay, a bagel doesn't

48:50.960 --> 48:54.720
 have a hole either. But like, who are you if you say a bagel doesn't have a hole? I mean, I don't know.

48:54.720 --> 49:00.240
 Yeah, so that's almost like an engineering definition of it. Okay, fair enough. So what about the

49:00.240 --> 49:09.760
 other options? So you know, one whole people would say... I like how these are like groups of people,

49:09.760 --> 49:12.800
 like where we've planted our foot. This is what we stand for.

49:12.800 --> 49:17.760
 There's books written about each belief. You know, would say, look, there's like a hole and it goes

49:17.760 --> 49:22.640
 all the way through the straw, right? There's one region of space, that's the hole, and there's one.

49:22.640 --> 49:25.280
 And two whole people would say like, well, look, there's a hole in the top and the hole

49:26.400 --> 49:31.040
 at the bottom. I think a common thing you see when people

49:33.920 --> 49:37.680
 argue about this, they would take something like this bottle of water I'm holding,

49:37.680 --> 49:41.920
 and go open it. And they say, well, how many holes are there in this? And you say like, well,

49:41.920 --> 49:46.720
 there's one, there's one hole at the top. Okay, what if I like poke a hole here so that all the

49:46.720 --> 49:53.120
 water spills out? Well, now it's a straw. So if you're a one hole, or I say to you like, well,

49:53.120 --> 49:58.400
 how many holes are in it now? There was one hole in it before, and I poked a new hole in it.

49:59.120 --> 50:03.920
 And then you think there's still one hole, even though there was one hole, and I made one more?

50:04.640 --> 50:09.760
 Clearly not. There's just two holes. Yeah. And yet, if you're a two hole, or the one hole,

50:09.760 --> 50:12.480
 or we'll say like, okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?

50:12.480 --> 50:20.240
 And in the book, I sort of, in math, there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem

50:20.240 --> 50:25.520
 that's confusing us. We can make the problem simpler. That's what we were doing a minute ago

50:25.520 --> 50:27.920
 when we were talking about high dimensional space. And I was like, let's talk about like

50:27.920 --> 50:32.320
 circles and line segments. Let's go down a dimension to make it easier. The other big

50:32.320 --> 50:36.640
 move we have is to make the problem harder, and try to sort of really like face up to

50:36.640 --> 50:40.720
 what are the complications. So what I do in the book is say like, let's stop talking about straws,

50:40.720 --> 50:46.720
 remove it and talk about pants. How many holes are there in a pair of pants? So I think most

50:46.720 --> 50:50.560
 people who say there's two holes in a straw would say there's three holes in a pair of pants.

50:51.760 --> 50:55.040
 I guess like, I mean, I guess we're filming only from here. I could take up. No, I'm not going

50:55.040 --> 51:00.800
 to do it. You'll just have to imagine the pants. Sorry. Yeah. Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no.

51:03.040 --> 51:06.640
 That's going to be in the director's, that's the Patreon only footage. There you go.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.400
 So many people would say there's three holes in a pair of pants. But you know,

51:10.400 --> 51:13.520
 for instance, my daughter, when I asked, by the way, talking to kids about this

51:13.520 --> 51:18.480
 is super fun. I highly recommend it. What did she say? She said, well,

51:19.600 --> 51:23.440
 yeah, I feel a pair of pants like just has two holes because yes, there's the waist,

51:23.440 --> 51:29.920
 but that's just the two leg holes stuck together. Whoa. Okay. Two leg holes. Yeah. Okay. I mean,

51:29.920 --> 51:34.560
 that really is a one color for the straw. So she's a one holder for the straw too. And

51:34.560 --> 51:43.120
 and that really does capture something. It captures this fact, which is central to the

51:43.120 --> 51:46.160
 theory of what's called homology, which is like a central part of modern topology that

51:47.840 --> 51:51.840
 holds whatever we may mean by them. There are somehow things which have an arithmetic to them.

51:51.840 --> 51:57.360
 There are things which can be added. Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg is kind

51:57.360 --> 52:02.080
 of an equation, but it's not an equation about numbers. It's an equation about some kind of

52:02.080 --> 52:06.000
 geometric, some kind of topological thing, which is very strange. And so, you know,

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
 when I come down, you know, like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up with these answers

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
 and somehow like dodge the original question and say, like, you're both right, my children. Okay.

52:19.040 --> 52:24.000
 So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician would say is like,

52:25.840 --> 52:29.920
 the first version would be to say like, well, there are two holes, but they're really both

52:29.920 --> 52:34.640
 the same hole. Well, that's not quite right. A better way to say it is there's two holes,

52:34.640 --> 52:40.880
 but one is the negative of the other. Now, what can that mean? One way of thinking about what it

52:40.880 --> 52:45.280
 means is that if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw, no matter what,

52:46.320 --> 52:51.360
 the amount of milkshake that's flowing in one end, that same amount is flowing out

52:52.080 --> 52:57.120
 the other end. So they're not independent from each other. There's some relationship

52:57.120 --> 53:03.280
 between them in the same way that if you somehow could like suck a milkshake through a pair of

53:03.280 --> 53:09.360
 pants, the amount of milkshake, just go with me on this Bob experiment. I'm right there with you.

53:09.360 --> 53:14.480
 The amount of milkshake that's coming in the left leg of the pants, plus the amount of milkshake

53:14.480 --> 53:20.640
 that's coming in the right leg of the pants is the same that's coming out the waste of the pants.

53:20.640 --> 53:26.000
 So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours yesterday, the last three days. So I just broke

53:26.000 --> 53:31.280
 the fast with a little bit of food yesterday. So this is like, this sounds, food analogies

53:31.280 --> 53:35.600
 or metaphors for this podcast work wonderfully, because I can intensely picture it.

53:35.600 --> 53:39.280
 Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation for talking about geometry for three hours?

53:39.280 --> 53:45.040
 Exactly, it's just for this. It's hardship to purify the mind. No, for the first time,

53:45.040 --> 53:51.440
 I just wanted to try the experience and just to pause, to do things that are out of the

53:51.440 --> 53:58.640
 ordinary, to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am to be just alive and be able to do all the

53:58.640 --> 54:04.400
 cool shit that I get to do. So did you drink water? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Water and salt,

54:04.400 --> 54:09.760
 so like electrolytes and all those kinds of things. But anyway, so the inflow on the top

54:09.760 --> 54:16.400
 of the pants equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants. Exactly. So this idea that,

54:16.400 --> 54:22.080
 I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really have this idea, this sort of modern idea. I mean,

54:22.080 --> 54:27.440
 building on stuff that other people did, Betty is an important one of this kind of modern notion

54:27.440 --> 54:32.160
 of relations between holes. But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic, the really modern view

54:32.160 --> 54:38.240
 was really Emy Nurtur's idea. So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject

54:39.520 --> 54:44.160
 on its modern footing that we have now. So, you know, it's always a challenge, you know,

54:44.160 --> 54:49.840
 in the book, I'm not going to say I give like a course so that you read this chapter and then

54:49.840 --> 54:53.440
 you're like, oh, it's just like I took like a semester of algebraic apology. It's not like

54:53.440 --> 54:57.920
 this. And it's always, you know, it's always a challenge writing about math because there are

54:57.920 --> 55:03.920
 some things that you can really do on the page and the math is there. And there's other things,

55:03.920 --> 55:08.880
 which it's too much in a book like this to like do them all the page, you can only say something

55:08.880 --> 55:15.120
 about them, if that makes sense. So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both. I try to do,

55:15.120 --> 55:23.040
 I try to topics that are, you can't really compress and really truly say exactly what they are

55:24.000 --> 55:29.520
 in this amount of space. I try to say something interesting about them, something meaningful

55:29.520 --> 55:34.880
 about them so that readers can get the flavor. And then in other places, I really try to get

55:34.880 --> 55:39.680
 up close and personal and really do the math and have it take place on the page.

55:40.560 --> 55:45.680
 To some degree, be able to give inklings of the beauty of the subject.

55:45.680 --> 55:48.080
 Yeah, I mean, there's, you know, there's a lot of books that are like,

55:48.080 --> 55:51.040
 I don't quite know how to express this well, I'm still laboring to do it, but

55:53.040 --> 56:00.800
 there's a lot of books that are about stuff. But I want my books to not only be about stuff,

56:00.800 --> 56:05.040
 but to actually have some stuff there on the page in the book for people to interact with

56:05.040 --> 56:09.840
 directly and not just sort of hear me talk about distant features about, distant features of it.

56:10.480 --> 56:16.240
 Right. So, not be talking just about ideas, but the actually be expressing the idea.

56:17.120 --> 56:23.920
 You know somebody in the, maybe you can comment, there's a guy, his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown,

56:23.920 --> 56:30.800
 Grant Sanderson, he does that masterfully well. Absolutely. Of visualizing, of expressing a

56:30.800 --> 56:36.160
 particular idea and then talking about it as well back and forth. What do you think about Grant?

56:37.040 --> 56:41.680
 It's fantastic. I mean, the flowering of math YouTube is like such a wonderful thing because,

56:42.800 --> 56:47.920
 you know, math teaching, there's so many different venues through which we can teach

56:47.920 --> 56:54.400
 people math. There's the traditional one, right? Well, where I'm in a classroom with, you know,

56:54.400 --> 56:58.640
 depending on the class, it could be 30 people, it could be 100 people, it could God help me be a

56:58.640 --> 57:02.400
 500 people, if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be. And there's sort of some,

57:02.400 --> 57:06.080
 but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude. And I'm with them for, we have a long

57:06.080 --> 57:10.160
 time, I'm with them for a whole semester. And I can ask them to do homework and we talk together,

57:10.160 --> 57:13.440
 we have office hours that they have one on one questions, a lot of that's like a very high level

57:13.440 --> 57:18.960
 of engagement. But how many people am I actually hitting at a time? Like not that many, right?

57:20.320 --> 57:27.200
 And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship where the fewer people you're

57:27.200 --> 57:31.440
 talking to, the more engagement you can ask for. The ultimate, of course, is like the mentorship

57:31.440 --> 57:37.520
 relation of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student where you spend a lot of one on one time

57:37.520 --> 57:44.080
 together for like, you know, three to five years. And the ultimate high level of engagement to one

57:44.080 --> 57:51.440
 person. You know, books, I can, this can get to a lot more people that are ever going to sit in my

57:52.000 --> 57:59.040
 classroom and you spend like, however many hours it takes to read a book, somebody like

57:59.040 --> 58:05.840
 Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile or people like Vi Hart, I mean, YouTube, let's face it,

58:05.840 --> 58:10.640
 has bigger reach than a book. Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many, many more views than

58:10.640 --> 58:16.240
 like, you know, any hardback book like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama is going to sell,

58:16.240 --> 58:24.240
 right? So that's, I mean, and then, you know, those are, you know, some of them are like

58:24.240 --> 58:27.280
 longer, 20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long, but they're, you know, they're

58:27.280 --> 58:30.800
 shorter. And then even so, look, look, like Virginia Chang is a wonderful category theorist

58:30.800 --> 58:34.800
 in Chicago. I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it, I mean, she was on, you know,

58:34.800 --> 58:38.560
 she has 30 seconds, but then there's like 30 seconds to sort of say something about mathematics

58:38.560 --> 58:45.360
 to like untold millions of people. So everywhere along this curve is important. One thing I feel

58:45.360 --> 58:49.680
 like is great right now is that people are just broadcasting on all the channels because we each

58:49.680 --> 58:54.480
 have our skills, right? Somehow along the way, like I learned how to write books, I had this kind

58:54.480 --> 58:58.560
 of weird life as a writer where I sort of spent a lot of time like thinking about how to put

58:58.560 --> 59:01.920
 English words together into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs, like

59:01.920 --> 59:07.680
 at length, which is this kind of like weird specialized skill. And that's one thing, but

59:07.680 --> 59:13.120
 like sort of being able to make like, you know, winning good looking eye catching videos is like

59:13.120 --> 59:17.200
 a totally different skill. And you know, probably, you know, somewhere out there, there's probably

59:17.200 --> 59:22.080
 sort of some like heavy metal band that's like teaching math through heavy metal and like using

59:22.080 --> 59:24.800
 their skills to do that. I hope there is at any rate.

59:24.800 --> 59:29.760
 Their music and so on. Yeah. But there is something to the process. I mean, Grant does this

59:29.760 --> 59:37.680
 especially well, which is in order to be able to visualize something that he writes programs.

59:37.680 --> 59:43.600
 So it's programmatic visualization. So like the things he is basically mostly through his

59:43.600 --> 59:49.920
 manum library and in Python, everything is drawn through Python. You have to

59:52.240 --> 59:58.160
 you have to truly understand the topic to be able to to visualize it in that way,

59:58.160 --> 1:00:04.800
 and not just understand it, but really kind of thinking a very novel way. It's funny because

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:11.200
 I've spoken with him a couple of times, spoken to him a lot offline as well. He really doesn't

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:18.160
 think he's doing anything new, meaning like he sees himself as very different from maybe like a

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:27.840
 researcher. But it feels to me like he's creating something totally new, like that act of understanding

1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:35.200
 visualizing is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power as does the process of proving

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:42.080
 something. It just it doesn't have that clear destination, but it's pulling out an insight

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:47.920
 and creating multiple sets of perspective that arrive at that insight. And to be honest, it's

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:54.640
 something that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value inside academic mathematics in

1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:58.640
 the same way. And this is a bit older that I think we haven't quite figured out how to value

1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:02.800
 the development of computational infrastructure. You know, we all have computers as our partners now

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:09.600
 and people build computers that sort of assist and participate in our mathematics. They build

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:14.880
 those systems and that's a kind of mathematics too, but not in the traditional form of proving

1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:20.240
 theorems and writing papers. But I think it's coming. Look, I mean, I think, you know, for example,

1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:24.720
 the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics at Brown, which is like a, you know,

1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:29.680
 it's a NSF funded math institute, very much part of sort of traditional math academia,

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.760
 they did an entire theme semester about visualizing mathematics, looking to the same kind

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.320
 of thing that they would do for like an up and coming research topic, like that's pretty cool.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:44.080
 So I think there really is buy in from the mathematics community to recognize that this

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:49.520
 kind of stuff is important and counts as part of mathematics, like part of what we're actually

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:54.240
 here to do. Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that from like MIT faculty, from faculty,

1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:59.200
 from all the top universities in the world. Let me ask you this weird question about the

1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:04.320
 Fields Medal, which is the Nobel Prize in mathematics. Do you think, since we're talking

1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:13.440
 about computers, there will one day come a time when a computer and AI system will win a Fields

1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:22.640
 Medal? No, of course, that's what a human would say. Why not? Is that like your, that's like

1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:28.160
 my cap shot? That's like the proof that I'm a human? Yeah. What does, how does he want me to

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:33.840
 answer? Is there something interesting to be said about that? Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously

1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:39.760
 interested in what AI can do in pure mathematics. I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial

1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.560
 interest, right? You're like, why am I not interested in like how it can like help feed

1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:47.440
 the world or help solve like various problems? I'm like, can it do more math? What can I do?

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:53.680
 We all have our interests, right? But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:03:01.120
 And here too, I think it's important to be kind of historical because it's certainly true that

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:05.600
 there's lots of things that we used to call research in mathematics that we would now call

1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:12.160
 computation, tasks that we've now offloaded to machines. Like, you know, in 1890, somebody

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:18.240
 could be like, here's my PhD thesis. I computed all the invariance of this polynomial ring under

1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:22.480
 the action of some finite group. Doesn't matter what those words mean, just it's like something

1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:27.680
 that in 1890 would take a person a year to do and would be a valuable thing that you might want to

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:32.080
 know. And it's still a valuable thing that you might want to know. But now you type a few lines

1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:38.800
 of code in Macaulay or Sage or Magma and you just have it. So we don't think of that as

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:43.760
 math anymore, even though it's the same thing. What's Macaulay, Sage and Magma? Oh, those are

1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:47.680
 computer algebra programs. So those are like sort of bespoke systems that lots of mathematicians

1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:51.920
 use. That's similar to Maple. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So it's similar to Maple in Mathematica. Yeah.

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:56.880
 But a little more specialized, but yeah. It's programs that work with symbols and allow you

1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:01.680
 to do, can you do proofs? Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs? They're not really

1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:06.240
 built for that. And that's a whole other story. But these tools are part of the process of

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:10.880
 mathematics now. Right. They are now, for most mathematicians, I would say, part of the process

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:16.400
 of mathematics. And so there's a story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by, which is,

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:27.520
 so far, attempts to get AIs to prove interesting theorems have not done so well. It doesn't mean

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:32.800
 they can. There's actually a paper I just saw, which has a very nice use of a neural net defined

1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:37.040
 counter examples to conjecture. Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that. Yeah.

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:40.560
 And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI to sort of try to find

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:45.280
 things where that's not true. And it actually succeeded. Now, in this case, if you look at

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:52.960
 the things that it found, you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures. Yes.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:59.680
 Okay. So like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so. Looking at what the AI came up with,

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.560
 you're like, you know, I bet if like five grad students had thought about that problem, they

1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:07.440
 wouldn't have thought about that. I mean, when you see it, you're like, okay, that is one of the

1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:12.400
 things you might try if you sort of like put some work into it. Still, it's pretty awesome.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:20.000
 But the story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by is there is, there's a, okay,

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.760
 we're going to go back to knots. It's cool. There's a knot called the Conway knot.

1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:26.240
 After John Conway, who maybe we'll talk about a very interesting character, awesome.

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:29.840
 Yeah. It's a small tangent. Somebody I was supposed to talk to, and unfortunately,

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:35.920
 he passed away. And he's somebody I find is an incredible mathematician, incredible human being.

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:39.840
 Oh, and I am sorry that you didn't get a chance because having had the chance to talk to him

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:44.560
 a lot when I was, you know, when I was a postdoc. Yeah, you missed out. There's no way to sugar

1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:49.200
 code it. I'm sorry that you didn't get that chance. Yeah, it is what it is. So knots.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.160
 Yeah. So there was a question. And again, it doesn't matter the technicalities of the question,

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:56.800
 but it's a question of whether the knot is sliced. It has to do with

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:02.160
 something about what kinds of three dimensional surfaces in four dimensions

1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:05.040
 can be bounded by this knot, but never mind what it means. It's some question.

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:10.160
 And it's actually very hard to compute whether a knot is sliced or not.

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:18.000
 And in particular, the question of the Conway knot, whether it was sliced or not,

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:24.880
 was particularly vexed until it was solved just a few years ago by Lisa Piccarillo,

1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:28.640
 who actually, now that I think of it, was here in Austin. I believe she was a grad student

1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:31.840
 at UT Austin at the time. I didn't even realize there was an Austin connection to this story

1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:36.560
 until I started telling it. She is, in fact, I think she's now at MIT. So she's basically following

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:42.640
 you around. If I remember correctly, there's a lot of really interesting richness to this story.

1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:49.600
 One thing about it is her paper was very short and simple, nine pages of which two were pictures.

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:55.680
 Very short for a paper solving a major conjecture. And it really makes you think about what we mean

1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:59.440
 by difficulty in mathematics. Do you say, oh, actually, the problem wasn't difficult because

1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:03.600
 you could solve it so simply? Or do you say, well, no, evidently it was difficult because

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:07.520
 the world's top depositors worked on it for 20 years and nobody could solve it. So therefore,

1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:12.240
 it is difficult. Or is it that we need some new category of things about which it's

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:17.120
 difficult to figure out that they're not difficult? I mean, this is the computer science

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:25.040
 formulation, but the journey to arrive at the simple answer may be difficult. But once you

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:30.560
 have the answer, it will then appear simple. And I mean, there might be a large category.

1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:42.800
 I hope there's a large set of such solutions. Because once we stand at the end of the scientific

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:48.240
 process that we're at the very beginning of, or at least it feels like, I hope there's just

1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:55.040
 simple answers to everything that will look and it'll be simple laws that govern the universe,

1:07:55.040 --> 1:08:02.160
 simple explanation of what is consciousness, of what is love, is mortality fundamental to life,

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:09.120
 what's the meaning of life, are human special or we're just another sort of reflection of

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:16.480
 and all that is beautiful in the universe in terms of like life forms, all of it is life and just

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:21.920
 has different, when taken from a different perspective is all life can seem more valuable

1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:26.400
 or not. But really, it's all part of the same thing. All those will have a nice like two equations,

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:31.840
 maybe one equation. Why do you think you want those questions to have simple answers?

1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:37.840
 I think just like symmetry and the breaking of symmetry is beautiful somehow.

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:44.240
 There's something beautiful about simplicity. I think it's aesthetic. It's aesthetic. Yeah.

1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:53.760
 Or but it's aesthetic in the way that happiness is an aesthetic. Why is that so joyful that a

1:08:53.760 --> 1:09:03.200
 simple explanation that governs a large number of cases is really appealing? Even when it's not,

1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:08.320
 like obviously, we get a huge amount of trouble with that because oftentimes,

1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:14.080
 it doesn't have to be connected with reality or even that explanation could be exceptionally

1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:21.440
 harmful. Most of like the world's history that was governed by hate and violence had a very

1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:27.280
 simple explanation at the core that was used to cause the violence and the hatred. So like we

1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:33.600
 get into trouble with that. But why is that so appealing? And in its nice forms in mathematics,

1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:39.680
 like you look at the Einstein papers, why are those so beautiful? And why is the Andrew Wiles

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:44.800
 proof of the Fermat's last theorem not quite so beautiful? Like what's beautiful about that story

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:52.640
 is the human struggle of like the human story of perseverance, of the drama of not knowing if

1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:57.040
 the proof is correct and ups and downs and all of those kinds of things. That's the interesting part.

1:09:57.040 --> 1:10:01.040
 But the fact that the proof is huge and nobody understood, well, from my outsider's perspective,

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:07.520
 nobody understands what the heck it is, is not as beautiful as it could have been. I wish it was

1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:16.000
 what Fermat originally said, which is, you know, it's not small enough to fit in the margins of

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.200
 this page. But maybe if he had like a full page or maybe a couple of post notes, he would have

1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:27.600
 enough to do the proof. What do you make of, if we could take another of a multitude of tangents,

1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:31.520
 what do you make of Fermat's last theorem? Because the statement, there's a few theorems,

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:37.040
 there's a few problems that are deemed by the world throughout its history to be exceptionally

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:44.800
 difficult. And that one in particular is really simple to formulate and really hard to come up

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:51.760
 with a proof for. And it was like taunted as simple by Fermat himself. Is there something

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:58.800
 interesting to be said about that x to the n plus y to the n equals z to the n for n of three or

1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:04.960
 greater? Is there a solution to this? And then how do you go about proving that? Like how would you

1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:12.080
 try to prove that? And what do you learn from the proof that eventually emerged by Andrew Wiles?

1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.080
 Yeah, so let me just say the background, because I don't know if everybody listening

1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:22.960
 knows the story. So you know, Fermat was an early number theorist, always sort of an early mathematician,

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:28.800
 those special adjacent didn't really exist back then. He comes up in the book actually in the

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:34.080
 context of a different theorem of his that has to do with testing whether a number is prime

1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:39.040
 or not. So I write about he was one of the ones who was salty and like he would exchange these

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:43.600
 letters where he and his correspondents would like try to top each other and vex each other with

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:49.680
 questions and stuff like this. But this particular thing, it's called Fermat's last theorem because

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:57.840
 it's a note he wrote in his in his copy of the Discretionist arithmetic guy, like he wrote,

1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:03.200
 here's an equation, it has no solutions, I can prove it, but the proof is like a little too long

1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:06.960
 to fit in this in the margin of this book, he was just like writing a note to himself.

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:10.480
 Now, let me just say historically, we know that Fermat did not have a proof of this theorem.

1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:15.840
 For a long time, people like, you know, people were like, this mysterious proof that was lost,

1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:24.160
 a very romantic story, right? But Fermat later, he did prove special cases of this theorem,

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.640
 and wrote about it, talked to people about the problem. It's very clear from the way that he

1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:33.840
 wrote where he can solve certain examples of this type of equation that he did not know how to do

1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:41.600
 the whole thing. He may have had a deep, simple intuition about how to solve the whole thing

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:47.280
 that he had at that moment without ever being able to come up with a complete proof, and that

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:54.400
 intuition may be lost in time. Maybe, but I think we, so, but you're right, that is unknowable,

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:59.120
 but I think what we can know is that later, he certainly did not think that he had a proof that

1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:05.040
 he was concealing from people. He thought he didn't know how to prove it, and I also think he

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:11.120
 didn't know how to prove it. Now, I understand the appeal of saying like, wouldn't it be cool

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:16.160
 if this very simple equation, there was like a very simple, clever, wonderful proof that you

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:19.920
 could do in a page or two, and that would be great. But you know what, there's lots of equations

1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:23.920
 like that that are solved by very clever methods like that, including the special cases that Fermat

1:13:23.920 --> 1:13:28.320
 wrote about, the method of descent, which is like very wonderful and important. But in the end,

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:33.600
 those are nice things that like, you know, you teach in an undergraduate class,

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:41.360
 and it is what it is, but they're not big. On the other hand, work on the Fermat problem,

1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:44.640
 that's what we like to call it because it's not really his theorem because we don't think you

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:51.920
 proved it. So, I mean, work on the Fermat problem, develop this like incredible richness of number

1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:57.360
 theory that we now live in today, like, and not by the way, just while Andrew Wiles being

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:02.080
 the person who together with Richard Taylor finally proved this theorem. But you know how

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.800
 you have this whole moment that people try to prove this theorem and they fail, and there's a

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:13.840
 famous false proof by LeMay from the 19th century, where Kummer, in understanding what mistake LeMay

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:18.880
 had made in this incorrect proof, basically understands something incredible, which is that,

1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:25.200
 you know, a thing we know about numbers is that you can factor them and you can factor them

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:31.280
 uniquely. There's only one way to break a number up into primes. Like, if we think of a number like

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:39.600
 12, 12 is 2 times 3 times 2. I had to think about it, right? Or it's 2 times 2 times 3,

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:44.240
 of course, you can reorder them. But there's no other way to do it. There's no universe in which

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:48.800
 12 is something times 5, or in which there's like four threes in it. Nope, 12 is like two twos in a

1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:55.120
 three. Like, that is what it is. And that's such a fundamental feature of arithmetic that we almost

1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:58.960
 think of it like God's law. You know what I mean? It has to be that way. That's a really powerful

1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:07.520
 idea. It's so cool that every number is uniquely made up of other numbers. And like made up meaning

1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:14.560
 like there's these like basic atoms that form molecules that get built on top of each other.

1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:18.320
 I love it. I mean, when I teach, you know, undergraduate number theory, it's like,

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:25.440
 it's the first really deep theorem that you prove. What's amazing is, you know, the fact that you can

1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:30.240
 factor a number into primes is much easier. Essentially Euclid knew it all, though he didn't

1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:35.520
 quite put it in that way. The fact that you can do it at all. What's deep is the fact that

1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:40.160
 there's only one way to do it that or however you sort of chop the number up, you end up with the

1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:49.440
 same set of prime factors. And indeed, what people finally understood at the end of the 19th century

1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:54.640
 is that if you work in number systems slightly more general than the ones we're used to,

1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:01.680
 which it turns out irrelevant to Fermat, all of a sudden, this stops being true.

1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:07.040
 Things get, I mean, things get more complicated. And now, because you were praising simplicity

1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:11.760
 before, you were like, it's so beautiful, unique factorization. It's so great. Like it's when I

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:16.080
 tell you that in more general number systems, there is no unique factorization. Maybe you're

1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:20.080
 like, that's bad. I'm like, no, that's good, because there's like a whole new world of phenomena to

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:25.920
 study that you just can't see through the lens of the numbers that we're used to. So I'm, I'm

1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:32.320
 for complication. I'm highly in favor of complication, because every complication is like an opportunity

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:38.720
 for new things to study. And is that the big kind of one of the big insights for you from

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:45.280
 Andrew Wiles's proof? Is there interesting insights about the process they used to prove

1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:51.040
 that sort of resonates with you as a mathematician? Is there interesting concept that emerged from

1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:57.440
 it? Is there interesting human aspects to the proof? Whether there's interesting human aspects

1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:03.520
 to the proof itself is an interesting question. Certainly, it has a huge amount of richness.

1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:10.800
 Sort of at its heart is an argument of, of what's called deformation theory, which was,

1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:17.520
 in part, created by my PhD advisor, Barry Mazer. Can you speak to what deformation theory

1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:23.600
 is? I can speak to what it's like. Sure. How about that? What is it rhyme with?

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:29.360
 Right. Well, the reason that Barry called it deformation theory, I think he's the one who

1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:34.560
 gave it the name. I hope I'm not wrong in saying Sunday. In your book, you have calling different

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:39.440
 things by the same name as one of the things in the beautiful map that opens the book.

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:45.040
 Yes. And this is a perfect example. So this is another phrase of Poincaré, this like incredible

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:48.560
 generator of slogans and aphorisms. He said, mathematics is the art of calling different

1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:52.880
 things by the same name. That very thing, that very thing we do, right? When we're like this

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.840
 triangle and this triangle, come on, they're the same triangle. They're just in a different place,

1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:03.760
 right? So in the same way, it came to be understood that the kinds of objects that you study

1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:12.160
 when you study, when you study Fermat's last theorem, and let's not even be too careful about

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:16.880
 what these objects are. I can tell you, they're gaol representations and modular forms, but saying

1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:22.560
 those words is not going to mean so much. But whatever they are, they're things that can be

1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:29.440
 deformed, moved around a little bit. And I think the insight of what Andrew and then Andrew and

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:36.000
 Richard were able to do was to say something like this. A deformation means moving something just a

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:41.920
 tiny bit, like an infinitesimal amount. If you really are good at understanding which ways

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:47.600
 a thing can move in a tiny, tiny, tiny infinitesimal amount in certain directions, maybe you can

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:52.320
 piece that information together to understand the whole global space in which it can move.

1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:57.200
 And essentially, their argument comes down to showing that two of those big global spaces

1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:03.040
 are actually the same, the fabled r equals t, part of their proof, which is at the heart of it.

1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:11.440
 And it involves this very careful principle like that. But that being said, what I just said,

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:16.960
 it's probably not what you're thinking, because what you're thinking, when you think, oh, I have a

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:26.560
 point in space and I move it around like a little tiny bit, you're using your notion of distance

1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:31.520
 that's from calculus. We know what it means for like two points on the real line to be close

1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:39.680
 together. So yet another thing that comes up in the book a lot is this fact that the notion of

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:44.480
 distance is not given to us by God. We could mean a lot of different things by distance.

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:47.760
 And just in the English language, we do that all the time. We talk about somebody being a close

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:52.960
 relative. It doesn't mean they live next door to you, right? It means something else. There's a

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:57.440
 different notion of distance we have in mind. And there are lots of notions of distances

1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:02.080
 that you could use in the natural language processing community and AI. There might be some

1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:07.200
 notion of semantic distance or lexical distance between two words. How much do they tend to

1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:14.240
 arise in the same context? That's incredibly important for doing autocomplete and machine

1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:16.960
 translation and stuff like that. And it doesn't have anything to do with, are they next to each

1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:21.280
 other in the dictionary? It's a different kind of distance. Okay, ready? In this kind of number

1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:26.080
 theory, there was a crazy distance called the piatic distance. I didn't write about this that

1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:28.800
 much in the book, because even though I love it, it's a big part of my research life. It gets a

1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:34.160
 little bit into the weeds, but your listeners are going to hear about it now. Please, you know,

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:38.720
 what a normal person says when they say two numbers are close, they say like, you know,

1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:42.560
 their difference is like a small number, like seven and eight are close because their difference is

1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:48.400
 one and one's pretty small. If we were to be what's called a two attic number theorist,

1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:53.760
 we'd say, oh, two numbers are close. If their difference is a multiple of a large power of two.

1:20:53.760 --> 1:21:03.920
 So like, so like one and 49 are close, because their difference is 48 and 48 is a multiple

1:21:03.920 --> 1:21:09.600
 of 16, which is a pretty large power of two, whereas whereas one and two are pretty far away,

1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:14.080
 because the difference between them is one, which is not even a multiple of a power of two at all.

1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:20.240
 It's odd. You want to know what's really far from one, like one and one 64th,

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:25.920
 because their difference is a negative power of two, two to the minus six. So those

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:31.920
 points are quite, quite far. Two to the power of a large n would be two.

1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:36.240
 If that's the difference between two numbers and they're close.

1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:43.200
 Yeah. So two to a large power is this metric, a very small number and two to a negative power

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:48.560
 is a very big number. That's too much. Okay. I can't even visualize that.

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:52.400
 It takes practice. It takes practice. If you've ever heard of the Cantor set, it looks kind of like

1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:58.000
 that. So it is crazy that this is good for anything, right? I mean, this just sounds

1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.600
 like a definition that someone would make up to torment you. But what's amazing is

1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:08.880
 there's a general theory of distance where you say any definition you make that satisfies

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:14.320
 certain axioms deserves to be called a distance and this. See, I'm sorry to interrupt. My brain,

1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:20.880
 you broke my brain now. Awesome. 10 seconds ago. Because I'm also starting to map for the two out

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:26.400
 of case to binary numbers, you know, because we romanticized those. Oh, that's exactly the

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:30.640
 right way to think of it. I was trying to mess with numbers. I was trying to see, okay, which ones

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:35.920
 are close. And then I'm starting to visualize different binary numbers and how they, which ones

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:40.560
 are close to each other. And that's, well, I think there's no, no, it's very similar. That's

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:44.560
 exactly the right way to think of it. It's almost like binary numbers written in reverse, right?

1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:49.680
 Because in a, in a binary expansion, two numbers are close. A number that's small is like 0.000

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:53.760
 something. Something that's the decimal and it starts with a lot of zeros. In the two attic

1:22:53.760 --> 1:23:01.520
 metric, a binary number is very small if it ends with a lot of zeros and then the decimal point.

1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:04.880
 Gotcha. So it is kind of like binary numbers written backwards is actually, I should have,

1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:08.560
 that's what I should have said, Lex. That's like very good metaphor.

1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:14.480
 Oh, okay. But so why is that, why is that interesting? Except for the fact that it's,

1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:20.880
 it's a beautiful kind of framework, different kind of framework, which you think about distances.

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:24.160
 And you're talking about not just the two attic, but the generalization of that.

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:28.160
 Yeah, the NEP. And so, so that, because that's the kind of deformation that comes up

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:35.200
 in Wiles's, in Wiles's proof that deformation where moving something a little bit means a little

1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:39.760
 bit in this two attic sense. Okay. No, I mean, it's such, I mean, I just get excited to talk

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:45.840
 about it. And I just taught this like in the fall semester that, but it like reformulating, why is,

1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:56.960
 so you pick a different measure of distance over which you can talk about very tiny changes

1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:03.360
 and then use that to then prove things about the entire thing. Yes. Although, you know,

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.800
 honestly, what I would say, I mean, it's true that we use it to prove things, but I would say

1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:13.120
 we use it to understand things. And then because we understand things better, then we can prove

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:17.040
 things. But you know, the goal is always the understanding, the goal is not to, so much

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:20.560
 to prove things, the goal is not to know what's true or false. I mean, this is the thing I write

1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:25.200
 about in the book near the end, and it's something that, so wonderful, wonderful essay by, by Bill

1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:29.440
 Thurston, kind of one of the great geometers of our time, who unfortunately passed away a few years

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:35.920
 ago, um, called on proof and progress in mathematics. And he writes very wonderfully about how,

1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:40.720
 you know, we're not, it's not a theorem factory where we have a production quota. I mean, the

1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:46.320
 point of mathematics is to help humans understand things. And the way we test that is that we're

1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:50.240
 proving new theorems along the way. That's the benchmark, but that's not the goal. Yeah. But

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:56.080
 just as a, as a kind of absolutely, but as a tool, it's kind of interesting to approach a problem

1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:03.520
 by saying, how can I change the distance function? Like what the nature of distance,

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:09.760
 because that might start to lead to insights for deeper understanding. Like if I were to try to

1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:17.840
 describe human society by a distance, two people are close if they love each other, right? And then,

1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:23.680
 and then start to, uh, and do a full analysis on the everybody that lives on earth currently,

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:29.680
 the seven billion people. And from that perspective, as opposed to the geographic perspective of

1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:35.440
 distance, and then maybe there could be a bunch of insights about the source of, uh, violence,

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:41.920
 the source of, uh, maybe entrepreneurial success or invention or economic success or different

1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:47.600
 systems, communism, capitalism start to, I mean, that's, I guess what economics tries to do. But

1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:53.200
 really saying, okay, let's think outside the box about totally new distance functions that could

1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:58.400
 unlock something profound about the space. Yeah. Because think about it. Okay. Here's,

1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:03.680
 I mean, now we're going to talk about AI, which you know a lot more about than I do. So

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:06.960
 just, you know, start laughing uproariously if I say something that's completely wrong.

1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.760
 We both know very little relative to what we will know centuries from now.

1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:17.440
 That is, that is a really good humble way to think about it. I like it. Okay. So let's just go for it.

1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:23.280
 Um, okay. So I think you'll agree with this, that in some sense what's good about AI is that

1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:28.640
 we can't test any case in advance. The whole point of AI is to make, or one point of it,

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:33.280
 I guess, is to make good predictions about cases we haven't yet seen. And in some sense,

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:37.840
 that's always going to involve some notion of distance because it's always going to involve

1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:43.760
 somehow taking a case we haven't seen and saying what cases that we have seen, is it close to?

1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:49.840
 Is it like, is it somehow an interpolation between? Now, when we do that in order to talk about

1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:55.440
 things being like other things, implicitly or explicitly, we're invoking some notion of distance

1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:59.280
 and boy, we better get it right. Right? If you try to do natural language processing and your

1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:03.520
 idea about distance between words is how close they are in the dictionary. When you write them

1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:09.200
 in alphabetical order, you are going to get pretty bad translations, right? No, the notion of distance

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:14.160
 has to come from somewhere else. Yeah, that's essentially when neural networks are doing this.

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.720
 Well, word embeddings are doing is coming up with. In the case of word embeddings, literally,

1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:22.400
 like literally what they are doing is learning a distance. But those are super complicated

1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:30.560
 distance functions. And it's almost nice to think maybe there's a nice transformation that's simple.

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:35.440
 Sorry, there's a nice formulation of the distance. Again, with the simple.

1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:44.720
 Let me ask you about this. From an understanding perspective, there's the Richard Feynman maybe

1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:52.320
 attributed to him, but maybe many others is this idea that if you can't explain something simply

1:27:52.320 --> 1:28:01.360
 that you don't understand it. In how many cases, how often is that true? Do you find there's some

1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:08.240
 profound truth in that? Oh, okay. So you were about to ask, is it true, which I would say

1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:13.120
 flatly no, but then you said you followed that up with, is there some profound truth in it?

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:16.080
 And I'm like, okay, sure. So there's some truth in it. It's not true.

1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:26.960
 It says your mathematician answer. The truth that is in it is that learning to explain something

1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:35.520
 helps you understand it. But real things are not simple. A few things are, most are not.

1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:40.480
 And I don't, to be honest, I don't, I mean, I don't, we don't really know whether Feynman

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:44.160
 really said that, right? Or something like that is sort of disputed. But I don't think Feynman

1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:48.000
 could have literally believed that whether or not he said it. And, you know, he was the kind

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:53.280
 of guy, I didn't know him, but I'm reading his writing, he liked to sort of say stuff like stuff

1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:57.920
 that sounded good. You know what I mean? So it totally strikes me as the kind of thing he could

1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:03.280
 have said because he liked the way saying it made him feel. But also knowing that he didn't

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:08.880
 like literally mean it. Well, I definitely have a lot of friends and I've talked to a lot of

1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:15.040
 physicists and they do derive joy from believing that they can explain stuff simply or believing

1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:20.000
 as possible to explain stuff simply, even when the explanation is not actually that simple.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:25.360
 Like I've heard people think that the explanation is simple and they do the explanation. And I

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:31.120
 think it is simple, but it's not capturing the phenomena that we're discussing. It's capturing,

1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:36.560
 it somehow maps in their mind, but it's, it's taking as a starting point as an assumption

1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:40.880
 that there's a deep knowledge and a deep understanding that's, that's actually very

1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:46.480
 complicated. And the simplicity is almost like a, almost like a poem about the more complicated

1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:50.960
 thing as opposed to a distillation. And I love poems, but a poem is not an explanation.

1:29:53.440 --> 1:29:57.360
 Well, some people might disagree with that, but certainly from a mathematical perspective,

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:02.560
 no poet would disagree with it. No poet would disagree. You don't think there's some things

1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:08.240
 that can only be described in precisely? I said explanation. I don't think any poem would,

1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:11.680
 I don't think any poet would say their poem is an explanation. They might say it's a description.

1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:16.880
 They might say it's sort of capturing sort of. Well, some people might say the only truth is like

1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:23.040
 music, right? That the, the, the, not the only truth, but some truth can only be expressed through

1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:28.240
 art. And I mean, that's the whole thing we're talking about religion and myth. And there's

1:30:28.240 --> 1:30:34.640
 some things that are limited cognitive capabilities and the tools of mathematics or the tools of physics

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:42.640
 are just not going to allow us to capture. Like it's possible consciousness is one of those things.

1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:47.280
 Yes, that is definitely possible. But I would even say, look, in consciousness is a thing about

1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:51.920
 which we're still in the dark as to whether there's an explanation we would, we would understand

1:30:51.920 --> 1:30:56.160
 as an explanation at all. By the way, okay, I got to give yet one more amazing Poincare quote,

1:30:56.160 --> 1:31:01.200
 because this guy just never stopped coming up with great quotes that, you know, Paul Erdisch,

1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:05.680
 another fellow who appears in the book. And by the way, he thinks about this notion of distance of

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:09.920
 like personal affinity, kind of like what you're talking about, the kind of social network and

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:14.160
 that notion of distance that comes from that. So that's something that Paul Erdisch, Erdisch did.

1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:17.040
 Well, he thought about distances in networks. I guess he didn't probably, he didn't think about

1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:19.840
 the social network. That's fascinating. That's how he started that story, where there's no,

1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:25.680
 but yeah, okay. But you know, Erdisch was sort of famous for saying, and this is sort of one

1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:31.680
 line you were saying, he talked about the book, capital T, capital B, the book. And that's the

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:36.160
 book where God keeps the right proof of every theorem. So when he saw a proof he really liked,

1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:39.760
 it was like really elegant, really simple, like that's from the book. That's like you found one

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:45.600
 of the ones that's in the book. He wasn't a religious guy, by the way, he referred to God

1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:49.520
 as the supreme fascist. He was like, but somehow he was like, I don't really believe in God,

1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:56.560
 but I believe in God's book. But Poincaré, on the other hand, and by the way, there are other

1:31:56.560 --> 1:32:02.240
 men, Hilda Hudson is one who comes up in this book. She also kind of saw math. She's one of the

1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:07.760
 people who sort of develops the disease model that we now use, that we use to sort of track

1:32:07.760 --> 1:32:12.080
 pandemics, this SIR model that sort of originally comes from her work with Ronald Ross. But she

1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:17.840
 was also super, super, super devout. And she also sort of on the other side of the religious coin

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:22.080
 was like, yeah, math is how we communicate with God. She has a great, all these people are incredibly

1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:26.880
 quotable. She says, you know, math is, the truth, the things about mathematics, she's like,

1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:31.360
 they're not the most important of God's thoughts, but they're the only ones that we can know precisely.

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:35.760
 So she's like, this is the one place where we get to sort of see what God's thinking when we do

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:40.480
 mathematics. Again, not a fan of poetry or music. Some people say Hendricks is like,

1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:46.080
 some people say chapter one of that book is mathematics. And then chapter two is like classic

1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:52.560
 rock. Right. So like, it's not clear that the, I'm sorry, you just sent me off on a tangent,

1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:56.640
 just imagining like Erdish at a Hendricks concert, trying to figure out if it was from

1:32:57.520 --> 1:33:02.560
 the book or not. What I was coming to was just to say, but when Poincaré said about this is he's

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:08.960
 like, you know, if like, this is all worked out in the language of the divine and if a divine

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:14.000
 being like came down and told it to us, we wouldn't be able to understand it. So it doesn't matter.

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:18.000
 So Poincaré was of the view that there were things that were sort of like

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:22.800
 inhumanly complex. And that was how they really were. Our job is to figure out the things that

1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:28.160
 are not like that. They're not like that. All this talk of primes got me hungry for primes.

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:34.640
 You, uh, you wrote a blog post, the beauty of bounding gaps, a huge discovery about prime

1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:40.880
 numbers and what it means for the future of math. Can you tell me about prime numbers? What the

1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:45.920
 heck are those? What are twin primes? What are prime gaps? What are bounding gaps in primes?

1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:51.360
 What are all these things? And what, if anything, or what exactly is beautiful about them?

1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:59.120
 Yeah. So, you know, prime numbers are one of the things that number theorists study the most and

1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:07.920
 have for millennia. They are numbers which can't be factored. And then you say like, like five,

1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:12.560
 and then you're like, wait, I can factor five. Five is five times one. Okay, not like that.

1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:18.240
 That is a factorization. It absolutely is a way of expressing five as a product of two things.

1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:21.440
 But don't you agree that there's like something trivial about it? It's something you can do to

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:27.040
 any number. It doesn't have content the way that if I say that 12 is six times two or 35 is seven

1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:30.960
 times five, I've really done something to it. I've broken up. So those are the kind of factorizations

1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:36.640
 that count. And a number that doesn't have a factorization like that is called prime, except

1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:43.840
 historical side note one, which at some times in mathematical history has been deemed to be a prime,

1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.480
 but currently is not. And I think that's for the best. But I bring it up only because sometimes

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:53.360
 people think that, you know, these definitions are kind of, if we think about them hard enough,

1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:58.800
 we can figure out which definition is true. No, there's just an artifact of mathematics. So

1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:05.920
 so it's the definition is best for us for our purposes. Well, those edge cases are weird, right?

1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:13.680
 So so it can't you can't be it doesn't count when you use yourself as a number or one as part of

1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:21.520
 the factorization or as the entirety of the factorization. So the so you somehow get to the

1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:27.280
 meat of the number by factorizing it. And that seems to get to the core of all of mathematics.

1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:31.680
 Yeah, you take any number and you factorize it until you can factorize no more. And what you

1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:36.240
 have left is some big pile of primes. I mean, by definition, when you can't factor anymore,

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:40.720
 when you when you're done, when you can't break the numbers up anymore, what's left must be prime,

1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:48.080
 you know, 12 breaks into two and two and three. So these numbers are the atoms, the building blocks

1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:53.120
 of all numbers. And there's a lot we know about them. But there's much more that we don't know

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:59.520
 them. I'll tell you the first few, there's two, three, five, seven, 11. By the way, they're all

1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:02.800
 going to be odd from then on, because if they were even, I could factor a two out of them.

1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:06.240
 But it's not all the odd numbers. Nine isn't prime because it's three times three.

1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:10.240
 15 isn't prime because it's three times five, but 13 is where we're at two, three, five,

1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:16.960
 seven, 11, 13, 17, 19, not 21, but 23 is et cetera, et cetera. Okay, so you could go on.

1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:20.560
 How high could you go if we were just sitting here? By the way, your own brain,

1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:25.040
 if continuous without interruption, would you be able to go over 100?

1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:29.760
 I think so. There's always those ones that trip people up. There's a famous one,

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:33.840
 the Groten Dieck prime, 57, like sort of Alexander Groten Dieck, the great algebraic

1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:38.560
 geometry was sort of giving some lecture involving a choice of a prime in general.

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:42.400
 And somebody said, like, can't you just choose a prime? And he said, okay, 57,

1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:46.960
 which is in fact not prime. It's three times 19. Oh, damn. But it was like,

1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:50.000
 I promise you in some circles, that's a funny story. Okay.

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:59.120
 Okay. There's a humor in it. Yes, I would say over 100, I definitely don't remember,

1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:04.800
 like 107, I think. I'm not sure. Okay. So is there a category of

1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:14.080
 fake primes that are easily mistaken to be prime? Like 57, I wonder.

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:21.920
 Yeah. So I would say 57 and 57 and 51 are definitely like prime offenders. Oh,

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:25.760
 I didn't do that on purpose. Oh, well done. I didn't do it on purpose. Anyway,

1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:31.280
 they're definitely ones that people, or 91 is another classic seven times 13. It really

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:36.720
 feels kind of prime, doesn't it? But it is not. Yeah. But there's also, by the way,

1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:41.280
 but there's also an actual notion of pseudo prime, which is a thing with a formal definition,

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:48.800
 which is not a psychological thing. It is a prime which passes a primality test devised by Fermat,

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.840
 which is a very good test, which if a number fails this test, it's definitely not prime.

1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:57.840
 And so there was some hope that, oh, maybe if a number passes the test, then it definitely

1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:01.360
 is prime. That would give a very simple criterion for primality. Unfortunately,

1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:08.960
 it's only perfect in one direction. So there are numbers, I want to say 341 is the smallest,

1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:14.080
 which passed the test, but are not prime 341. Is this test easily explainable or no?

1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:19.120
 Yes, actually. Ready? Let me give you the simplest version of it. You can dress it up a little bit,

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:26.880
 but here's the basic idea. I take the number, the mystery number, I raise two to that power.

1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:34.160
 So let's say your mystery number is six. Are you sorry you asked me? Are you ready?

1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:38.800
 No, I'm breaking my brain again, but yes. Let's do it. We're going to do a live

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:45.280
 demonstration. Let's say your number is six. So I'm going to raise two to the sixth power.

1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:49.360
 Okay, so if I were working on it, I'd be like, that's two cubes squared. So that's eight times

1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:54.240
 eight. So that's 64. Now we're going to divide by six, but I don't actually care what the

1:38:54.240 --> 1:39:02.960
 quotient is, only the remainder. So let's say 64 divided by six is, well, there's a quotient of 10,

1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:09.280
 but the remainder is four. So you failed because the answer has to be two. For any prime,

1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:16.960
 let's do it with five, which is prime. Two to the fifth is 32. Divide 32 by five.

1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:21.120
 And you get six with a remainder of two.

1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:27.680
 With a remainder of two. For seven, two to the seventh is 128. Divide that by seven.

1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:35.120
 And let's see. I think that's seven times 14. Is that right? No. Seven times

1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:43.600
 18 is 126 with a remainder of two, right? 128 is a multiple of seven plus two. So if that

1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:48.800
 remainder is not two, then that's definitely not prime. Then it's definitely not prime.

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:54.320
 And then if it is, it's likely a prime, but not for sure. It's likely a prime, but not for

1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:57.200
 sure. And there's actually a beautiful geometric proof, which is in the book, actually. That's

1:39:57.200 --> 1:39:59.840
 like one of the most granular parts of the book, because it's such a beautiful proof I couldn't

1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:06.480
 not give it. So you draw a lot of like opal and pearl necklaces and spin them. That's kind of the

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:13.440
 geometric nature of this proof of Fermat's little theorem. So yeah, so with pseudo primes,

1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:16.480
 there are primes that are kind of faking it. They pass that test, but there are numbers that

1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.360
 are faking it. They pass that test, but are not actually prime. But the point is,

1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:31.120
 there are many, many, many theorems about prime numbers. Are there like, there's a bunch of

1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:36.480
 questions to ask, is there an infinite number of primes? Can we say something about the gap

1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:41.760
 between primes as the numbers grow larger and larger and larger and so on? Yeah, it's a perfect

1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:46.160
 example of your desire for simplicity in all things. You know, it would be really simple

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:49.280
 if there was only finally many primes. Yes. And then there would be this

1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:55.600
 finite set of atoms that all numbers would be built up. That's right. That would be very

1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:59.440
 simple in good and certain ways, but it's completely false. And number theory would be

1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:03.840
 totally different if that were the case. It's just not true. In fact, this is something else

1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:09.840
 that Euclid knew. So this is a very, very old fact, like much before, long before we'd had

1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:13.600
 anything like modern number. The primes are infinite. The primes that there are, right,

1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.640
 the infinite primes. There's an infinite number of primes. So what about the gas between the

1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:22.160
 primes? Right. So one thing that people recognized and really thought about a lot is that the primes

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:27.280
 on average seem to get farther and farther apart as they get bigger and bigger. In other words,

1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:31.680
 it's less and less common. Like I already told you of the first 10 numbers, two, three, five,

1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:37.440
 seven, four of them are prime. That's a lot, 40%. If I looked at, you know, 10 digit numbers,

1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:42.880
 no way would 40% of those be prime. Being prime would be a lot rare in some sense because there's

1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:47.600
 a lot more things for them to be divisible by. That's one way of thinking of it. It's a lot more

1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:50.960
 possible for there to be a factorization because there's a lot of things you can try to factor

1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:54.880
 out of it. As the numbers get bigger and bigger, primality gets rarer and rarer.

1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:02.560
 And the extent to which that's the case, that's pretty well understood. But then you can ask more

1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:10.960
 fine grained questions. And here is one. A twin prime is a pair of primes that are two apart,

1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:19.120
 like three and five, or like 11 and 13, or like 17 and 19. And one thing we still don't know is,

1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:23.920
 are there infinitely many of those? We know on average, they get farther and farther apart,

1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:28.960
 but that doesn't mean there couldn't be like occasional folks that come close together.

1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:35.520
 And indeed, we think that there are. And one interesting question, I mean, this is,

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:41.280
 because I think you might say like, well, why, how could one possibly have a right to have an

1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.760
 opinion about something like that? Like what, you know, we don't have any way of describing a

1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:52.160
 process that makes primes like, sure, you can like look at your computer and see a lot of them.

1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:55.760
 But the fact that there's a lot, why is that evidence that there's infinitely many, right?

1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.120
 Maybe I can go on the computer and find 10 million. Well, 10 million is pretty far from

1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:02.720
 infinity, right? So how is that, how is that evidence? There's a lot of things. There's like

1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:05.920
 a lot more than 10 million atoms. That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms in the universe,

1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:09.200
 right? I mean, on most people's physical theories, there's probably not, as I understand it.

1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:16.640
 Okay. So why would we think this? The answer is that we've, that it turns out to be like

1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:23.120
 incredibly productive and enlightening to think about primes as if they were random numbers,

1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.880
 as if they were randomly distributed according to a certain law. Now they're not,

1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:30.000
 they're not random. There's no chance involved. It's completely deterministic,

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:35.440
 whether a number is prime or not. And yet it just turns out to be phenomenally useful in

1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:42.320
 mathematics to say, even if something is governed by a deterministic law, let's just pretend it

1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:46.560
 wasn't, let's just pretend that they were produced by some random process and see if the behavior is

1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:50.320
 roughly the same. And if it's not, maybe change the random process, maybe make the randomness a

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:54.720
 little bit different and tweak it and see if you can find a random process that matches the behavior

1:43:54.720 --> 1:44:01.360
 we see. And then maybe you predict that other behaviors of the system are like that of the

1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.120
 random process. And so that's kind of like, it's funny because I think when you talk to people

1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:11.920
 about the twin prime conjecture, people think you're saying, wow, there's like some deep structure

1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:17.200
 there that like makes those primes be like close together again and again. And no, it's the opposite

1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:21.040
 of deep structure. What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture is that we

1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:25.920
 believe the primes are like sort of strewn around pretty randomly. And if they were, then by chance,

1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:29.120
 you would expect there to be infinitely many twin primes. And we're saying, yeah, we expect them

1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:34.960
 to behave just like they would if they were random dirt. You know, the fascinating parallel here is

1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:40.560
 I just got a chance to talk to Sam Harris. And he uses the prime numbers as an example.

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:48.240
 Often, I don't know if you're familiar with who Sam is. He uses that as an example of there being

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:55.760
 no free will. Wait, where does he get this? Well, he just uses as an example of it might seem like

1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:03.280
 this is a random number generator, but it's all like formally defined. So if we keep getting more

1:45:03.280 --> 1:45:10.640
 and more primes, then like that might feel like a new discovery and that might feel like a new

1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:15.520
 experience, but it's not. It was always written in the cards. But it's funny that you say that

1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:22.720
 because a lot of people think of like randomness, the fundamental randomness within the nature of

1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:28.400
 reality might be the source of something that we experience as free will. And you're saying it's

1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:35.440
 like useful to look at prime numbers as a random process in order to prove stuff about them.

1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:40.400
 But fundamentally, of course, it's not a random process. Well, not in order to prove some stuff

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.640
 about them so much as to figure out what we expect to be true and then try to prove that.

1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:48.160
 Because here's what you don't want to do. Try really hard to prove something that's false.

1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:52.160
 That makes it really hard to prove the thing if it's false. So you certainly want to have some

1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:56.080
 heuristic ways of guessing, making good guesses about what's true. So yeah, here's what I would

1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:01.680
 say. You're going to be imaginary Sam Harris now. You are talking about prime numbers and you are like,

1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.680
 but prime numbers are completely deterministic. And I'm saying, well, let's treat them like

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:09.600
 a random process. And then you say, but you're just saying something that's not true. They're

1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:12.560
 not a random process. They're deterministic. And I'm like, okay, great, you hold to your

1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:15.440
 insistence that it's not a random process. Meanwhile, I'm generating insight about the

1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:18.160
 primes that you're not because I'm willing to sort of pretend that there's something that

1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:22.800
 they're not in order to understand what's going on. Yeah, so it doesn't matter what the reality is.

1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:30.640
 What matters is what framework of thought results in the maximum number of insights.

1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:34.400
 Yeah, because I feel, look, I'm sorry, but I feel like you have more insights about people if you

1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:40.720
 think of them as like beings that have wants and needs and desires and do stuff on purpose.

1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:44.320
 Even if that's not true, you still understand better what's going on by treating them in that

1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:47.440
 way. Don't you find, look, when you work on machine learning, don't you find yourself sort

1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:53.120
 of talking about what the machine is trying to do in a certain instance? Do you not find

1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.800
 yourself drawn to that language? It knows this. It's trying to do that. It's learning that.

1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:03.760
 I'm certainly drawn to that language to the point where I receive quite a bit of criticisms for it

1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:09.520
 because I, you know, like, oh, I'm on your side, man. So especially in robotics, I don't know why,

1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:16.080
 but robotics people don't like to name their robots. They certainly don't like to gender

1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:20.480
 their robots because the moment you gender a robot, you start to anthropomorphize.

1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:24.800
 If you say he or she, you start to, you know, in your mind construct like a,

1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:31.520
 like a life story in your mind. You can't help it. It's like you create like a humorous story to

1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:37.520
 this person. You start to, this person, this robot, you start to project your own. But I think

1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:41.440
 that's what we do to each other. And I think that's actually really useful for the engineering

1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:46.480
 process, especially for human robot interaction. And yes, for machine learning systems,

1:47:46.480 --> 1:47:51.120
 for helping you build an intuition about a particular problem. It's almost like asking this

1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:57.520
 question, you know, when a machine learning system fails in a particular edge case, asking

1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:02.880
 like, what were you thinking about? Like, like asking like almost like when you're talking about

1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:08.960
 to a child who just did something bad, you want to understand like what was,

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:14.080
 how did they see the world? Maybe there's a totally new, maybe you're the one that's

1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:19.760
 thinking about the world incorrectly. And yeah, that anthropomorphization process,

1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:24.160
 I think is ultimately good for insight. And the same as I agree with you, I tend to believe

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:28.800
 about free will as well. Let me ask you a ridiculous question if it's okay.

1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:36.080
 Of course. I've just recently, most people go on like rabbit hole, like YouTube things. And

1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:47.520
 I went on a rabbit hole often do of Wikipedia. And I found a page on finitism, ultra finitism,

1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:52.960
 and intuitionism, or I forget what it's called. Yeah, intuitionism. Intuitionism.

1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:58.640
 That seemed pretty, pretty interesting. I have a my to do list actually like looking to, like,

1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:03.040
 is there people who like formally attract like real mathematicians are trying to argue for this.

1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:09.760
 But the belief there, I think, let's say finitism that infinity is, is fake.

1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:18.800
 Meaning, infinity might be like a useful hack for certain, like a useful tool in mathematics,

1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:27.360
 but it really gets us into trouble. Because there's no infinity in the real world. Maybe I'm sort of

1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:32.880
 not expressing that fully correctly, but basically saying like there's things there.

1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:40.320
 And once you add into mathematics, things that are not provably within the physical world,

1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:48.400
 you're starting to inject, to corrupt your framework of reason. What do you think about that?

1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:54.160
 I mean, I think, okay, so first of all, I'm not an expert. And I couldn't even tell you what the

1:49:54.160 --> 1:49:59.120
 difference is between those three terms finitism, ultra finitism, and intuitionism, although I

1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:02.480
 know what they're related, I tend to associate them with the Netherlands in the 1930s.

1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:06.720
 Okay, I'll tell you, can I just quickly comment because I read the Wikipedia page,

1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:10.400
 the difference in ultra... That's like the ultimate sentence of the modern age.

1:50:10.400 --> 1:50:13.760
 Can I just comment because I read the Wikipedia page? That sums up our moment.

1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:22.960
 Bro, I'm basically an expert. Ultra finitism, so finitism says that the only infinity you're

1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:28.560
 allowed to have is that the natural numbers are infinite. So like those numbers are infinite.

1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:38.000
 So like one, two, three, four, five, the integers are infinite. The ultra finitism says, nope,

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.600
 even that infinity is fake. I'll bet ultra finitism came second. I'll bet it's like when

1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:47.280
 there's like a hardcore scene and then one guy's like, oh, now there's a lot of people in the

1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:51.760
 scene. I have to find a way to be more hardcore than the hardcore people. All back to the emo talk.

1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:57.280
 Yeah. Okay, so is there any... Are you ever... Because I'm often uncomfortable with infinity.

1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:06.080
 Like psychologically. I have trouble when that sneaks in there. It's because it works so damn

1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:14.000
 well. I get a little suspicious because it could be almost like a crutch or an oversimplification

1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:20.000
 that's missing something profound about reality. Well, so first of all, okay, if you say like,

1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:29.040
 is there like a serious way of doing mathematics that doesn't really treat infinity as a real thing

1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:32.640
 or maybe it's kind of agnostic and is like, I'm not really going to make a firm statement about

1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:36.320
 whether it's a real thing or not. Yeah, that's called most of the history of mathematics, right?

1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:42.320
 So it's only after Cantor, right, that we really are sort of, okay, we're going to like

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:45.920
 have a notion of like the cardinality of an infinite set and like

1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:52.480
 do something that you might call like the modern theory of infinity. That said, obviously,

1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:55.840
 everybody was drawn to this notion and no, not everybody was comfortable with it. Look,

1:51:55.840 --> 1:52:00.720
 I mean, this is what happens with Newton, right? I mean, so Newton understands that to talk about

1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:06.480
 tangents and to talk about instantaneous velocity, he has to do something that we would now call

1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:11.920
 taking a limit, right? The fabled dy over dx. If you sort of go back to your calculus class,

1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:17.440
 for those who've taken calculus, remember this mysterious thing and you know, what is it? What

1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:23.840
 is it? Well, he'd say like, well, it's like you sort of divide the length of this line segment

1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:26.320
 by the length of this other line segment and then you make them a little shorter and you

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:28.960
 divide again and then you make them a little shorter and you divide again and then you just

1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:33.120
 keep on doing that until they're like infinitely short and then you divide them again. These quantities

1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:43.280
 that are like, they're not zero, but they're also smaller than any actual number, these infinitesimals.

1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:48.160
 Well, people were queasy about it and they weren't wrong to be queasy about it, right? From a

1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:52.320
 modern perspective, it was not really well formed. There's this very famous critique of Newton by

1:52:52.320 --> 1:52:58.960
 Bishop Berkeley where he says like, what these things you define like, you know, they're not zero,

1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:03.760
 but they're smaller than any number. Are they the ghosts of departed quantities? That was

1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:10.800
 this like ultra line of Newton. And on the one hand, he was right. It wasn't really rigorous

1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:14.400
 by modern standards. On the other hand, like Newton was out there doing calculus and other

1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:20.480
 people were not writing. It works. It works. I think a sort of intuitionist view, for instance,

1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:26.080
 I would say would express serious doubt. And by the way, it's not just infinity. It's like

1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:29.920
 saying, I think we would express serious doubt that like, the real numbers exist.

1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:35.920
 Now, most people are comfortable with the real numbers.

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:39.280
 Well, computer scientists with floating point number, I mean,

1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:41.760
 floating point arithmetic.

1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:48.560
 It's a great point, actually. I think in some sense, this flavor of doing math saying,

1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:53.600
 we shouldn't talk about things that we cannot specify in a finite amount of time. There's

1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:57.680
 something very computational in flavor about that. And it's probably not a coincidence that it

1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:04.960
 becomes popular in the 30s and 40s, which is also like kind of like the dawn of ideas about

1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:08.480
 formal computation, right? You probably know the timeline better than I do. Sorry, what becomes

1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:14.080
 popular? These ideas that maybe we should be doing math in this more restrictive way where

1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:18.160
 even a thing that, you know, because look, the origin of all this is like,

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:23.600
 you know, number represents a magnitude, like the length of a line. Like so, I mean, the idea that

1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:27.520
 there's a continuum, there's sort of like, there's like,

1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:33.200
 is pretty old, but that, you know, just because something is old doesn't mean we can't reject

1:54:33.200 --> 1:54:37.120
 it if we want to. Well, a lot of the fundamental ideas in computer science, when you talk about

1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:44.080
 the complexity of problems to Turing himself, they rely on infinity as well.

1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:49.120
 Well, the ideas that kind of challenge that, the whole space of machine learning, I would say,

1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:53.920
 challenges that. It's almost like the engineering approach to things, like the floating point

1:54:53.920 --> 1:55:01.040
 arithmetic. The other one that, back to John Conway, that challenges this idea, I mean,

1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:11.840
 maybe to tie in the ideas of deformation theory and limits to infinity is this idea of cellular

1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:20.240
 automata. With John Conway looking at the game of life, Steven Wolfram's work, that I've been a

1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:24.240
 big fan of for a while of cellular automata. I was wondering if you have, if you have ever

1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:30.080
 encountered these kinds of objects, you ever looked at them as a mathematician, where you have

1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:37.840
 very simple rules of tiny little objects that when taken as a whole create incredible complexities,

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:43.200
 but are very difficult to analyze, very difficult to make sense of, even though the one individual

1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:48.640
 object, one part, it's like what we were saying about Andrew Wiles, you can look at the deformation

1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:54.960
 of a small piece to tell you about the whole. It feels like with cellular automata or any kind of

1:55:54.960 --> 1:56:02.400
 complex systems, it's often very difficult to say something about the whole thing, even when you

1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:10.880
 can precisely describe the operation of the local neighborhoods. Yeah, I mean, I love that subject.

1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:14.640
 I haven't really done research in it myself. I've played around with it. I'll send you a fun blog post

1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:21.280
 I wrote where I made some cool texture patterns from cellular automata that I... And those are

1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:24.960
 really always compelling. It's like you create simple rules and they create some beautiful

1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:28.240
 textures. It doesn't make any sense. Actually, did you see there was a great paper? I don't know if

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:31.680
 you saw this, like a machine learning paper. Yes. I don't know if you saw the one I'm talking about,

1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:36.560
 where they were learning the texture as like, let's try to reverse engineer and learn a cellular

1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:41.920
 automaton that can reduce texture that looks like this from the images. Very cool. And as you say,

1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:46.240
 the thing you said is I feel the same way when I read machine learning paper is that

1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:50.320
 what's especially interesting is the cases where it doesn't work. What does it do when it

1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:54.560
 doesn't do the thing that you tried to train it to do? That's extremely interesting. Yeah,

1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:58.800
 that was a cool paper. So yeah, so let's start with the game of life. Let's start with...

1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:02.720
 Or let's start with John Conway. So Conway...

1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:08.480
 Yeah, so let's start with John Conway again. Just I don't know, from my outsider's perspective,

1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:13.520
 there's not many mathematicians that stand out throughout the history of the 20th century.

1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:18.720
 And he's one of them. I feel like he's not sufficiently recognized. I think he's pretty

1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:24.880
 recognized. Okay. Well, I mean, he was a full professor of Princeton for most of his life.

1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:30.000
 He was sort of certainly the pinnacle of... Yeah, but I found myself every time I talk about Conway

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.680
 and how excited I am about him. I have to constantly explain to people who he is.

1:57:36.480 --> 1:57:41.360
 And that's always a sad sign to me. But that's probably true for a lot of mathematicians.

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:45.120
 I was about to say, I feel like you have a very elevated idea of how famous... This is

1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:48.160
 what happens when you grow up in the Soviet Union or you think the mathematicians are very, very

1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:54.480
 famous. Yeah, but I'm not actually so convinced at a tiny tangent that that shouldn't be so.

1:57:54.480 --> 1:58:01.600
 I mean, it's not obvious to me that that's one of the... If I were to analyze American society that

1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:07.040
 perhaps elevating mathematical and scientific thinking to a little bit higher level would

1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:12.800
 benefit the society, well, both in discovering the beauty of what it is to be human and for

1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:18.960
 actually creating cool technology, better iPhones. But anyway, John Conway. Yeah, and Conway is such

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:24.080
 a perfect example of somebody whose humanity was and his personality was like a wound up with his

1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:28.480
 mathematics. So it's not... Sometimes I think people who are outside the field think of mathematics

1:58:28.480 --> 1:58:33.360
 as this kind of cold thing that you do separate from your existence as a human being. No way,

1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:38.160
 your personality is in there just as it would be in a novel you wrote or a painting you painted or

1:58:38.160 --> 1:58:42.960
 just the way you walk down the street. It's in there, it's you doing it. And Conway was certainly

1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:51.600
 a singular personality. I think anybody would say that he was playful, like everything was

1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:57.920
 a game to him. Now, what you may think I'm going to say, and it's true is that he sort of was very

1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:03.760
 playful in his way of doing mathematics, but it's also true. It went both ways. He also sort of made

1:59:03.760 --> 1:59:09.360
 mathematics out of games. He looked at... He was a constant inventor of games with like crazy names

1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:15.760
 and then he was sort of analyzed those games mathematically to the point that he and then

1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:22.400
 later collaborating with Knuth like created this number system, the serial numbers, in which actually

1:59:22.400 --> 1:59:26.640
 each number is a game. There's a wonderful book about this called... I mean, there are his own

1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:30.960
 books and then there's like a book that he wrote with Berlecamp and Guy called Winning Ways, which is

1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:41.600
 such a rich source of ideas. And he too kind of has his own crazy number system in which, by the

1:59:41.600 --> 1:59:47.280
 way, there are these infinitesimals, the ghosts of departed quantities. They're in there now not as

1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:56.960
 ghosts, but as like certain kind of two player games. So, you know, he was a guy. So I knew him

1:59:56.960 --> 2:00:03.520
 when I was a postdoc and I knew him at Princeton and our research overlapped in some ways. Now,

2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:07.120
 it was on stuff that he had worked on many years before. The stuff I was working on kind of connected

2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:15.040
 with stuff in group theory, which somehow seems to keep coming up. And so I often would like to

2:00:15.040 --> 2:00:18.080
 sort of ask him a question. I would sort of come upon him in the common room and I would ask him a

2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:23.920
 question about something. And just anytime you turned him on, you know what I mean? You sort of

2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:29.280
 asked a question. It was just like turning a knob and winding him up and he would just go and you

2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:37.360
 would get a response that was like so rich and went so many places and taught you so much. And

2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:41.840
 usually had nothing to do with your question. Yeah. Usually your question was just a prompt.

2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:45.920
 Damn, you couldn't count on actually getting the question. Yeah, there's brilliant curious minds

2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:55.040
 that even at that age, yeah, it was definitely a huge loss. But on his game of life, which was I

2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:59.680
 think he developed in the 70s as almost like a side thing, a fun little experiment. Yeah, the game

2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:08.160
 of life is this. It's a very simple algorithm. It's not really a game per se in the sense of the

2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:15.440
 kinds of games that he liked, where people played against each other. But essentially, it's a game

2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:21.120
 that you play with marking little squares on the sheet of graph paper. And in the 70s, I think he

2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:25.840
 was like literally doing it with like a pen on graph paper, you have some configuration of squares,

2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:30.320
 some of the squares in the graph paper are filled in, some are not. And then there's a rule, a single

2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:38.000
 rule that tells you at the next stage, which squares are filled in and which squares are not.

2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.000
 Sometimes an empty square gets filled in, that's called birth, sometimes a square that's filled

2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:46.720
 in gets erased, that's called death. And there's rules for which squares are born, which squares die.

2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:55.440
 It's the rule is very simple, you can write it on one line. And then the great miracle is that you

2:01:55.440 --> 2:02:02.800
 can start from some very innocent looking little small set of boxes and get these results of

2:02:02.800 --> 2:02:06.320
 incredible richness. And of course, nowadays, you don't do it on paper. Nowadays, you do it on a

2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:10.640
 computer. There's actually a great iPad app called Golly, which I really like that has like

2:02:11.440 --> 2:02:16.320
 Conway's original rule and like, gosh, like hundreds of other variants. And it's a lightning

2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:21.760
 fast. So you can just be like, I want to see 10,000 generations of this rule play out like faster

2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:25.360
 than your eye can even follow. And it's like amazing. So I highly recommend it if this is

2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:30.560
 at all intriguing to you getting golly on your iOS device. And you can do this kind of process,

2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:36.800
 which I really enjoy doing, which is almost from like putting a Darwin hat on or a biologist hat

2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:43.360
 on and doing analysis of a higher level of abstraction, like the organisms that spring up,

2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:47.040
 because there's different kinds of organisms, like you can think of them as species, and they

2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:51.280
 interact with each other. They can, there's gliders, they shoot different, there's like

2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:58.160
 things that can travel around. There's things that can glider guns that can generate those gliders.

2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:04.480
 And you can use the same kind of language as you would about describing a biological system.

2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:09.680
 So it's a wonderful laboratory. And it's kind of a rebuke to someone who doesn't think that like

2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:16.560
 very, very rich complex structure can come from very simple underlying laws. Like

2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:23.120
 it definitely can't. Now, here's what's interesting. If you just picked like some random rule,

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:27.200
 you wouldn't get interesting complexity. I think that's one of the most interesting

2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:32.560
 things of these, one of these most interesting features of this whole subject that the rules

2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:36.960
 have to be tuned just right. Like a sort of typical rule set doesn't generate any kind of

2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:44.400
 interesting behavior. But some do. I don't think we have a clear way of understanding

2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:47.280
 which do and which don't. I don't know. Maybe Steven thinks he does. I don't know, but...

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:55.360
 No, no, it's a giant mystery. What Steven Wolfram did is... Now, there's a whole interesting aspect

2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:59.200
 to the fact that he's a little bit of an outcast in the mathematics and physics community,

2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:05.600
 because he's so focused on a particular, his particular work. I think if you put ego aside,

2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:10.560
 which I think unfairly, some people are not able to look beyond. I think his work is

2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:15.760
 actually quite brilliant. But what he did is exactly this process of Darwin like exploration

2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:20.640
 is taking these very simple ideas and writing a thousand page book on them, meaning like,

2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:26.560
 let's play around with this thing. Let's see. And can we figure anything out? Spoiler alert? No,

2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:33.600
 we can't. In fact, he does a challenge. I think it's like a rule 30 challenge, which is quite

2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:40.320
 interesting. Just simply for machine learning people, for mathematics people, is can you predict

2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:48.080
 the middle column? For his, it's a 1D cellular automata. Can you predict, generally speaking,

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:56.080
 can you predict anything about how a particular rule will evolve just in the future? Very simple.

2:04:56.080 --> 2:05:00.160
 Just look at one particular part of the world. Just zooming in on that part,

2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:08.640
 100 steps ahead. Can you predict something? And the challenge is to do that kind of prediction

2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:14.480
 so far as nobody's come up with an answer. But the point is, we can't. We don't have tools,

2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:20.240
 or maybe it's impossible, or, I mean, he has these kind of laws of irreducibility. They hear

2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:24.640
 first of his poetry. It's like, we can't prove these things. It seems like we can't. That's the

2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:30.160
 basic... It almost sounds like ancient mathematics or something like that, where you're like, the

2:05:30.160 --> 2:05:36.960
 gods will not allow us to predict the cellular automata. But that's fascinating that we can't.

2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:42.880
 I'm not sure what to make of it. And there's power to calling this particular set of rules,

2:05:42.880 --> 2:05:49.520
 game of life, as Conway did. Because I'm not exactly sure, but I think he had a sense that

2:05:49.520 --> 2:05:56.400
 there's some core ideas here that are fundamental to life, to complex systems, to the way life

2:05:56.400 --> 2:06:02.400
 emerged on Earth. I'm not sure I think Conway thought that. It's something that... I mean,

2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:09.120
 Conway always had a rather ambivalent relationship with the game of life, because I think he saw it

2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:15.920
 as... It was certainly the thing he was most famous for in the outside world. And I think that he,

2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:20.960
 his view, which is correct, is that he had done things that were much deeper mathematically than

2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:27.280
 that. And I think it always aggrieved him a bit that he was the game of life guy when he proved

2:06:27.280 --> 2:06:33.040
 all these wonderful theorems and created all these wonderful games, created the serial numbers.

2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:41.120
 He was a very tireless guy who just did an incredibly variegated array of stuff. So he was

2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:45.680
 exactly the kind of person who you would never want to reduce to one achievement. You know what

2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:52.560
 I mean? Let me ask you about group theory. You mentioned it a few times. What is group theory?

2:06:53.280 --> 2:07:00.160
 What is an idea from group theory that you find beautiful? Well, so I would say group theory

2:07:00.160 --> 2:07:08.080
 sort of starts as the general theory of symmetry is that people looked at different kinds of things

2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:15.760
 and said, like, as we said, like, oh, it could have maybe all there is the symmetry from left to

2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:21.360
 right, like a human being, right? Or that's roughly bilaterally symmetric, as we say. So

2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:25.520
 there's two symmetries. And then you're like, well, wait, didn't I say there's just one? There's

2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:30.560
 just left to right? Well, we always count the symmetry of doing nothing. We always count the

2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:34.880
 symmetry that's like, there's flip and don't flip. Those are the two configurations that you can be

2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:41.760
 in. So there's two. You know, something like a rectangle is bilaterally symmetric, you can flip

2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:47.520
 it left to right, but you can also flip it top to bottom. So there's actually four symmetries.

2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:52.320
 There's do nothing, flip it left to right, and flip it top to bottom or do both of those things.

2:07:55.120 --> 2:08:03.040
 A square, there's even more because now you can rotate it. You can rotate it by 90 degrees. So

2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:06.000
 you can't do that. That's not a symmetry of the rectangle. If you try to rotate it 90 degrees,

2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:12.960
 you get a rectangle oriented in a different way. So a person has two symmetries, a rectangle for

2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:19.040
 a square, eight, different kinds of shapes have different numbers of symmetries. And the real

2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:25.840
 observation is that that's just not like a set of things. They can be combined. You do one symmetry,

2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:33.440
 then you do another. The result of that is some third symmetry. So a group really abstracts away

2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:42.000
 this notion of saying it's just some collection of transformations you can do to a thing where

2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:45.840
 you combine any two of them to get a third. So, you know, a place where this comes up in computer

2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:52.000
 science is in sorting because the ways of permuting a set, the ways of taking sort of some set of

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:55.280
 things you have on the table and putting them in a different order, shuffling a deck of cards,

2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:58.720
 for instance, those are the symmetries of the deck. And there's a lot of them. There's not two,

2:08:58.720 --> 2:09:02.480
 there's not four, there's not eight. Think about how many different orders a deck of card can be in.

2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:08.160
 Each one of those is the result of applying a symmetry to the original deck. So a shuffle is

2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:13.920
 a symmetry, right? You're reordering the cards. If I shuffle and then you shuffle, the result is some

2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:19.760
 other kind of thing you might call a double shuffle, which is a more complicated symmetry.

2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:26.000
 So group theory is kind of the study of the general abstract world that encompasses all

2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:30.160
 these kinds of things. But then, of course, like lots of things that are way more complicated than

2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:35.280
 that. Like infinite groups of symmetries, for instance. So they give you infinite, huh? Oh,

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:41.840
 yeah. Okay. Well, okay, ready? Think about the symmetries of the line. You're like, okay, I can

2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:48.160
 reflect it left to right, you know, around the origin. Okay, but I could also reflect it left

2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:55.680
 to right grabbing somewhere else, like at one or two or pi or anywhere. Or I could just slide it

2:09:55.680 --> 2:09:59.760
 some distance. That's a symmetry. Slide it five units over. So there's clearly infinitely many

2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:03.360
 symmetries of the line. That's an example of an infinite group of symmetries.

2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:09.280
 Is it possible to say something that kind of captivates, keeps being brought up by physicists,

2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:15.120
 which is gauge theory, gauge symmetry, as one of the more complicated type of symmetries? Is there

2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:21.680
 an easy explanation of what the heck it is? Is that something that comes up on your mind at all?

2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:25.600
 Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist, but I can say this. It is certainly true

2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:33.120
 that it has been a very useful notion in physics to try to say, like, what are the symmetry groups,

2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:37.360
 like, of the world? Like, what are the symmetries under which things don't change, right? So we

2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:41.120
 just, I think we talked a little bit earlier about, it should be a basic principle that a theorem

2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:46.240
 that's true here is also true over there. And same for a physical law, right? I mean,

2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:49.040
 if gravity is like this over here, it should also be like this over there.

2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:53.840
 Okay. What that's saying is we think translation in space should be a symmetry.

2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:58.480
 All the laws of physics should be unchanged if the symmetry we have in mind is a very simple one,

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:05.280
 like translation. And so then there becomes a question, like, what are the symmetries

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:12.720
 of the actual world with its physical laws? And one way of thinking is an oversimplification,

2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:23.440
 but like one way of thinking of this big shift from before Einstein to after is that we just

2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:30.480
 changed our idea about what the fundamental group of symmetries were. So that things like

2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:35.120
 the Lorenz contraction, things like these bizarre relativistic phenomena or Lorenz would

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:45.040
 have said, oh, to make this work, we need a thing to change its shape if it's moving

2:11:46.080 --> 2:11:50.400
 nearly a speed of light. Well, under the new framework, it's much better. You're like, oh,

2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:53.520
 no, it wasn't changing its shape. You were just wrong about what counted as a symmetry.

2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:58.000
 Now that we have this new group, the so called Lorenz group, now that we understand what the

2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:02.160
 symmetries really are, we see it was just an illusion that the thing was changing its shape.

2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:07.120
 Yeah, so you can then describe the sameness of things under this weirdness that is

2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:15.840
 general relativity, for example. Yeah. Yeah, still, I wish there was a simpler explanation

2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:23.120
 of like exact, I mean, you know, gauge symmetries is a pretty simple general concept about rulers

2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:34.240
 being deformed. I've actually just personally been on a search, not a very rigorous or aggressive

2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:41.600
 search, but for something I personally enjoy, which is taking complicated concepts and finding

2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:47.440
 the sort of minimal example that I can play around with, especially programmatically.

2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:50.720
 That's great. I mean, this is what we try to train our students to do, right? I mean, in class,

2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:54.400
 this is exactly what this is like best pedagogical practice.

2:12:54.400 --> 2:13:04.320
 I do hope there's simple explanation, especially like I've in my sort of drunk random walk, drunk

2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:10.640
 walk, whatever it is that's called, sometimes stumble into the world of topology. And like

2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:15.440
 quickly, like, you know, when you go into a party and you realize this is not the right party for

2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:23.680
 me, whenever I go into topology is like so much math everywhere. I don't even know what it feels

2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:28.400
 like this is me like being a hater is I think there's way too much math. Like there are two,

2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:33.600
 the cool kids who just want to have like everything is expressed through math, because they're

2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:39.440
 actually afraid to express stuff simply through language. That's my hater formulation of topology.

2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:43.120
 But at the same time, I'm sure that's very necessary to do sort of rigorous discussion.

2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:46.320
 But I feel like... But don't you think that's what gauge symmetry is like? I mean,

2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:49.680
 it's not a field I know well, but it certainly seems like... Yes, it is like that. Okay.

2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:57.120
 But my problem with topology, okay, and even like differential geometry is like,

2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:04.080
 you're talking about beautiful things. Like if they could be visualized, it's open question if

2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:09.040
 everything could be visualized, but you're talking about things that could be visually stunning,

2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:17.440
 I think. But they are hidden underneath all of that math. Like if you look at the papers that

2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:22.320
 are written in topology, if you look at all the discussions on stack exchange, they're all math

2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:30.000
 dense, math heavy. And the only kind of visual things that emerge every once in a while is like

2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:33.920
 something like a mobius strip. Every once in a while, some kind of

2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:41.760
 simple visualizations. Well, there's the vibration, there's the hop vibration or

2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:46.960
 all those kinds of things that somebody, some grad student from like 20 years ago wrote a

2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:52.800
 program in Fortran to visualize it. And that's it. And it's just... It makes me sad because

2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.480
 those are visual disciplines. Just like computer vision is a visual discipline. So you can provide

2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:05.840
 a lot of visual examples. I wish topology was more excited and in love with visualizing some of the

2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:10.320
 ideas. I mean, you could say that, but I would say for me, a picture of the hop vibration does

2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:14.640
 nothing for me. Whereas like when you're, it's like, oh, it's like about the quaternions. It's

2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:18.080
 like a subgroup of the quaternions. And I'm like, oh, so now I see what's going on. Like, why didn't

2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:21.200
 you just say that? Why were you like showing me this stupid picture instead of telling me what

2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:26.720
 you were talking about? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying, nobody goes back to what we were saying

2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:30.640
 about teaching that like people are different and what they'll respond to. So I think there's no...

2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:34.640
 I mean, I'm very opposed to the idea that there's one right way to explain things. I think there's

2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:39.120
 like a huge variation in like, you know, our brains like have all these like weird like

2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:43.600
 hooks and loops. And it's like very hard to know like what's going to latch on. And it's not going

2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:49.840
 to be the same thing for everybody. So I think monoculture is bad, right? I think that's...

2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:53.920
 And I think we're agreeing on that point that like it's good that there's like a lot of different

2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:57.680
 ways in and a lot of different ways to describe these ideas because different people are going to

2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:04.720
 find different things illuminating. But that said, I think there's a lot to be discovered when you

2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:15.600
 force little silos of brilliant people to kind of find the middle ground or like

2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:23.360
 aggregate or come together in a way. So there's like people that do love visual things.

2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:28.160
 I mean, there's a lot of disciplines, especially in computer science that are obsessed with

2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:32.640
 visualizing, visualizing data, visualizing neural networks. I mean, neural networks themselves

2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:36.640
 are fundamentally visual. There's a lot of work in computer vision that's very visual.

2:16:36.640 --> 2:16:42.080
 And then coming together with some folks that were like deeply rigorous and are like totally

2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:45.840
 lost in multi dimensional space where it's hard to even bring them back down to 3D.

2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:52.080
 They're very comfortable in this multi dimensional space. So forcing them to kind of work together

2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:57.760
 to communicate because it's not just about public communication of ideas. It's also,

2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:01.360
 I feel like when you're forced to do that public communication like you did with your book,

2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:07.680
 I think deep profound ideas can be discovered. That's like applicable for research and for

2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:11.920
 science. Like there's something about that simplification or not simplification, but

2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:19.280
 distillation or condensation or whatever the hell you call it compression of ideas that

2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:25.440
 somehow actually stimulates creativity. And I'd be excited to see more of that in the

2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:30.480
 mathematics community. Can you? Let me make a crazy metaphor. Maybe it's a little bit like

2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:33.600
 the relation between prose and poetry, right? I mean, if you might say like,

2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:36.800
 why do we need anything more than prose? You're trying to convey some information. So you just

2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:42.480
 like say it. Well, poetry does something, right? It's sort of, you might think of it as a kind

2:17:42.480 --> 2:17:46.480
 of compression. Of course, not all poetry is compressed, like not awesome. Some of it is quite

2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:54.640
 baggy, but like you are kind of often it's compressed, right? A lyric poem is often sort of

2:17:54.640 --> 2:18:00.640
 like a compression of what would take a long time and be complicated to explain in prose into sort

2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:08.560
 of a different mode that is going to hit in a different way. We talked about Poincaré conjecture

2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:16.800
 here. There's a guy, he's Russian, Grigori Perlman. He proved Poincaré conjecture. If you

2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:22.320
 can comment on the proof itself, if that stands out to you, something interesting or the human

2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:30.800
 story of it, which is he turned down the Fields Medal for the proof. Is there something you find

2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:38.480
 inspiring or insightful about the proof itself or about the man? Yeah. I mean, one thing I really

2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:44.320
 like about the proof, and partly that's because it's sort of a thing that happens again and again

2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:48.080
 in this book. I mean, I'm writing about geometry and the way it sort of appears in all these kind

2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:54.000
 of real world problems. But it happens so often that the geometry you think you're studying

2:18:54.960 --> 2:19:00.800
 is somehow not enough. You have to go one level higher in abstraction and study a higher level

2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:06.160
 of geometry. And the way that plays out is that Poincaré asks a question about a certain kind

2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:11.200
 of three dimensional object. Is it the usual three dimensional space that we know, or is it some kind

2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:16.160
 of exotic thing? And so, of course, this sounds like it's a question about the geometry of the

2:19:16.160 --> 2:19:21.760
 three dimensional space. But no, Perlman understands. And by the way, in a tradition that involves

2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:26.160
 Richard Hamilton and many other people, like most really important mathematical advances,

2:19:26.160 --> 2:19:30.000
 this doesn't happen alone. It doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens as the culmination of a program

2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:33.440
 that involves many people. Same with Wiles, by the way. I mean, we talked about Wiles, and I

2:19:33.440 --> 2:19:38.080
 want to emphasize that starting all the way back with Coomer, who I mentioned in the 19th century,

2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:45.840
 but Gerhard Frey and Mazer and Ken Ribbit and like many other people are involved in building

2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:50.320
 the other pieces of the arch before you put the keystone in. We stand on the shoulders of giants.

2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:58.240
 Yes. So, what is this idea? The idea is that, well, of course, the geometry of the three

2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:02.800
 dimensional object itself is relevant. But the real geometry you have to understand is

2:20:02.800 --> 2:20:10.320
 the geometry of the space of all three dimensional geometries. Whoa. You're going up a higher level.

2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:18.720
 Because when you do that, you can say, now let's trace out a path in that space. There's a mechanism

2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:23.200
 called Ricci flow. And again, we're outside my research area. So for all the geometric analysts

2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:28.320
 and differential geometers out there listening to this, if I please, I'm doing my best and I'm

2:20:28.320 --> 2:20:33.200
 roughly saying it. So the Ricci flow allows you to say like, okay, let's start from some

2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:38.000
 mystery three dimensional space, which Poincare would conjecture is essentially the same thing

2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:44.000
 as our familiar three dimensional space, but we don't know that. And now you let it flow,

2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:49.040
 you sort of like let it move in its natural path according to some almost physical process

2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:54.880
 and ask where it winds up. And what you find is that it always winds up. You've continuously

2:20:54.880 --> 2:20:59.760
 deformed it. There's that word deformation again. And what you can prove is that the process doesn't

2:20:59.760 --> 2:21:04.480
 stop until you get to the usual three dimensional space. And since you can get from the mystery thing

2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:09.600
 to the standard space by this process of continually changing and never kind of

2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:17.120
 having any sharp transitions, then the original shape must have been the same as the standard

2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:20.640
 shape. That's the nature of the proof. Now, of course, it's incredibly technical. I think

2:21:20.640 --> 2:21:25.520
 as I understand it, I think the hard part is proving that the favorite word of AI people,

2:21:25.520 --> 2:21:31.040
 you don't get any singularities along the way. But of course, in this context, singularity just

2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:37.040
 means acquiring a sharp kink. It just means becoming non smooth at some point. So

2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:43.440
 just saying something interesting about formal about the smooth trajectory through this weird

2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:48.560
 space. But yeah, so what I like about it is that it's just one of many examples of where

2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:54.480
 it's not about the geometry you think it's about. It's about the geometry of all geometries,

2:21:55.200 --> 2:21:59.280
 so to speak. And it's only by kind of like kind of like being jerked out of Flatland,

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:04.240
 right? Same idea. It's only by sort of seeing the whole thing globally at once that you can

2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:07.120
 really make progress on understanding like the one thing you thought you were looking at.

2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:12.240
 It's a romantic question. But what do you think about him turning down the Fields Medal?

2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:19.920
 Well, is that just our Nobel Prizes and Fields Medal is just a cherry on top of the cake and

2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:28.400
 really math itself, the process of curiosity of pulling at the string of the mystery before us.

2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:37.120
 That's the cake. And then the words are just icing and clearly I've been fasting and I'm hungry.

2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:46.240
 But do you think it's tragic or just a little curiosity that he turned on the medal?

2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:51.360
 Well, it's interesting because on the one hand, I think it's absolutely true that right in some kind

2:22:51.360 --> 2:22:58.720
 of like vast spiritual sense, like awards are not important, not important the way that sort of

2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:04.160
 like understanding the universe is important. On the other hand, most people who are offered that

2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:13.520
 prize accept it. So there's something unusual about his choice there. I wouldn't say I see it as

2:23:13.520 --> 2:23:18.960
 tragic. I mean, maybe if I don't really feel like I have a clear picture of why he chose not to take

2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:23.680
 it. I mean, he's not alone in doing things like this. People have sometimes turned down prizes

2:23:23.680 --> 2:23:29.680
 for ideological reasons, probably more often in mathematics. I mean, I think I'm right in saying

2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:34.480
 that Peter Schultz had like turned down sort of some big monetary prize because he just, you know,

2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:40.800
 I mean, I think at some point you have plenty of money. And maybe you think it sends the wrong

2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:47.360
 message about what the point of doing mathematics is. I do find that there's most people accept.

2:23:47.360 --> 2:23:51.120
 You know, most people have given a prize. Most people take it. I mean, people like to be appreciated.

2:23:51.120 --> 2:23:54.480
 Like I said, we're people. Yes. Not that different from most other people.

2:23:54.480 --> 2:24:00.880
 But the important reminder that that turning down the prize serves for me is not that there's

2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:04.880
 anything wrong with the prize. And there's something wonderful about the prize, I think.

2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:11.040
 The Nobel Prize is trickier because so many Nobel Prizes are given. First of all, the Nobel

2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:16.320
 Prize often forgets many, many of the important people throughout history. Second of all,

2:24:16.880 --> 2:24:21.600
 there's like these weird rules to it. There's only three people and some projects have a huge

2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:31.040
 number of people. I don't know. It doesn't kind of highlight the way science is done

2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:34.800
 on some of these projects in the best possible way. But in general, the prizes are great.

2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:39.520
 But what this kind of teaches me and reminds me is sometimes in your life, there'll be moments

2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:49.280
 when the thing that you would really like to do, society would really like you to do,

2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:55.280
 is the thing that goes against something you believe in, whatever that is, some kind of

2:24:55.280 --> 2:25:02.560
 principle, and stand your ground in the face of that. It's something, I believe most people

2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:07.200
 will have a few moments like that in their life, maybe one moment like that. And you have to do

2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:11.040
 it. That's what integrity is. So it doesn't have to make sense to the rest of the world,

2:25:11.040 --> 2:25:15.840
 but to stand on that, to say no. It's interesting because I think...

2:25:15.840 --> 2:25:20.480
 But do you know that he turned down the prize in service of some principle? Because I don't know

2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:24.880
 that. Well, yes, that seems to be the inkling, but he has never made it super clear. But the

2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:30.160
 inkling is that he had some problems with the whole process of mathematics that includes awards,

2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:35.600
 like this hierarchies and the reputations and all those kinds of things and individualism that's

2:25:35.600 --> 2:25:40.160
 fundamental to American culture. He probably, because he visited the United States quite a bit,

2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:50.560
 that he probably... It's all about experiences. And he may have had some parts of academia,

2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:56.320
 some pockets of academia can be less than inspiring, perhaps sometimes, because of the

2:25:56.320 --> 2:26:03.840
 individual egos involved, not academia, people in general, smart people with egos. And if you

2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:08.640
 interact with certain kinds of people, you can become cynical too easily. I'm one of those people

2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:13.680
 that I've been really fortunate to interact with incredible people at MIT and academia in general,

2:26:13.680 --> 2:26:19.040
 but I've met some assholes. And I tend to just kind of... When I run into difficult folks,

2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:24.000
 I just kind of smile and send them all my love and just kind of go around. But for others,

2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:30.880
 those experiences can be sticky. Like they can become cynical about the world when folks like

2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:36.960
 that exist. So he may have become a little bit cynical about the process of science.

2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:40.640
 Well, you know, it's a good opportunity. Let's posit that that's his reasoning because I truly

2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:45.920
 don't know. It's an interesting opportunity to go back to almost the very first thing we talked

2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:51.120
 about, the idea of the mathematical Olympiad. Because of course, that is... So the international

2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:56.000
 mathematical Olympiad is like a competition for high school students solving math problems. And

2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:01.360
 in some sense, it's absolutely false to the reality of mathematics because just as you say,

2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:09.840
 it is a contest where you win prizes. The aim is to sort of be faster than other people.

2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:15.680
 And you're working on sort of canned problems that someone already knows the answer to,

2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:21.360
 like not problems that are unknown. So, you know, in my own life, I think when I was in

2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:25.840
 high school, I was like very motivated by those competitions. And like I went to the math Olympiad

2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.400
 and... You won it. I won. I mean... Well, there's something I have to explain to people because

2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:35.040
 it says... I think it says on the Wikipedia that I won a gold medal. And in the real Olympics,

2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:38.960
 they only give one gold medal in each event. I just have to emphasize that the international

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:44.160
 math Olympiad is not like that. The gold medals are awarded to the top one 12th of all participants.

2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:48.320
 So sorry to bust the legend or anything like that. Well, you're an exceptional

2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:53.040
 performer in terms of achieving high scores on the problems and they're very difficult.

2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:58.000
 So you've achieved a high level of performance on the... In this very specialized skill. And by

2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:02.800
 the way, it was a very cold war activity. You know, in 1987, the first year I went,

2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:07.200
 it was in Havana. Americans couldn't go to Havana back then. It was a very complicated

2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:11.360
 process to get there. And they took the whole American team on a field trip to the Museum

2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:16.320
 of American Imperialism in Havana so we could see what America was all about.

2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:26.400
 How would you recommend a person learn math? So somebody who's young or somebody my age or

2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:32.000
 somebody older who've taken a bunch of math but wants to rediscover the beauty of math

2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:37.680
 and maybe integrate into their work more solid in the research space and so on.

2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:40.640
 Is there something you could say about the process of

2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:46.320
 incorporating mathematical thinking into your life?

2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:51.520
 I mean, the thing is, it's in part a journey of self knowledge. You have to know

2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:56.240
 what's going to work for you and that's going to be different for different people. So there are

2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:02.800
 totally people who at any stage of life just start reading math textbooks. That is a thing

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:08.000
 that you can do and it works for some people and not for others. For others, a gateway is,

2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:11.680
 you know, I always recommend like the books of Martin Gardner, another sort of person we

2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:17.440
 haven't talked about, but who also like Conway embodies that spirit of play. He wrote a column

2:29:17.440 --> 2:29:22.960
 in Scientific American for decades called Mathematical Recreations and there's such joy in it and such

2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:27.840
 fun. And these books, the columns are collected into books and the books are old now, but for

2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:32.320
 each generation of people who discover them, they're completely fresh and they give a totally

2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:37.520
 different way into the subject than reading a formal textbook, which for some people would be the right

2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:43.440
 thing to do. And, you know, working contest style problems too, those are bound into books,

2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:46.480
 like especially like Russian and Bulgarian problems, right? There's book after book

2:29:46.480 --> 2:29:50.560
 problems from those contexts. That's going to motivate some people. For some people,

2:29:50.560 --> 2:29:54.320
 it's going to be like watching well produced videos, like a totally different format. Like,

2:29:54.320 --> 2:29:58.400
 I feel like I'm not answering your question. I'm sort of saying there's no one answer and like,

2:29:58.400 --> 2:30:02.480
 it's a journey where you figure out what resonates with you. For some people,

2:30:03.200 --> 2:30:06.560
 it's the self discovery is trying to figure out why is it that I want to know.

2:30:06.560 --> 2:30:10.800
 Okay, I'll tell you a story. Once when I was in grad school, I was very frustrated with my like

2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:14.240
 lack of knowledge of a lot of things as we all are, because no matter how much we know, we don't

2:30:14.240 --> 2:30:18.640
 know much more and going to grad school means just coming face to face with like the incredible

2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:22.800
 overflowing fault of your ignorance, right? So I told Joe Harris, who was an algebraic

2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:27.680
 geometer, a professor in my department, I was like, I really feel like I don't know enough. And I

2:30:27.680 --> 2:30:34.720
 should just like take a year of leave and just like read EGA, the holy textbook, elements of

2:30:34.720 --> 2:30:38.960
 algebraic geometry. This like, I'm just gonna, I feel like I don't know enough. So I just gonna

2:30:38.960 --> 2:30:47.840
 sit and like read this like 1500 page, many volume book. And he was like, and the professor

2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:51.040
 Harris, like, that's a really stupid idea. And I was like, why is that a stupid idea? Then I would

2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:54.560
 know more algebraic geometry, because you're not actually going to do it like you learn.

2:30:55.600 --> 2:30:58.720
 I mean, he knew me well enough to say like, you're going to learn because you're going to be working

2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:02.880
 on a problem. And then there's going to be a fact from EGA you need in order to solve your problem

2:31:02.880 --> 2:31:05.920
 that you want to solve. And that's how you're going to learn it. You're not going to learn it

2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:10.480
 without a problem to bring you into it. And so for a lot of people, I think if you're like,

2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:14.560
 I'm trying to understand machine learning, and I'm like, I can see that there's sort of some

2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:23.360
 mathematical technology that I don't have. I think you like, let that problem that you actually care

2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:28.000
 about drive your learning. I mean, one thing I've learned from advising students, you know,

2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:35.520
 math is really hard. In fact, anything that you do right is hard.

2:31:37.920 --> 2:31:42.320
 And because it's hard, like, you might sort of have some idea that somebody else gives you, oh,

2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:46.400
 I should learn X, Y, and Z. Well, if you don't actually care, you're not going to do it. You

2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:51.280
 might feel like you should. Maybe somebody told you you should. But I think you have to hook it

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:54.800
 to something that you actually care about. So for a lot of people, that's the way in. You have an

2:31:54.800 --> 2:31:58.560
 engineering problem you're trying to handle. You have a physics problem you're trying to handle.

2:31:59.440 --> 2:32:04.880
 You have a machine learning problem you're trying to handle. Let that not a kind of abstract idea

2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:10.080
 of what the curriculum is, drive your mathematical learning. And also just as a brief comment,

2:32:10.080 --> 2:32:16.640
 that math is hard. There's a sense to which hard is a feature, not a bug. In the sense that, again,

2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:23.760
 this maybe this is my own learning preference. But I think it's a value to fall in love with

2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:29.760
 the process of doing something hard, overcoming it, and becoming a better person. Because like,

2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:38.000
 I hate running. I hate exercise to bring it down to like the simplest hard. And I enjoy the part

2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:42.880
 once it's done. The person I feel like for the rest in the rest of the day, once I've accomplished

2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:48.160
 it, the actual process, especially the process of getting started in the initial, like it really,

2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:52.640
 I don't feel like doing it. And I really have the way I feel about running is the way I feel about

2:32:53.440 --> 2:32:58.960
 really anything difficult in the intellectual space, especially mathematics, but also

2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:06.400
 just something that requires like holding a bunch of concepts in your mind with some uncertainty,

2:33:06.400 --> 2:33:12.320
 like where the terminology or the notation is not very clear. And so you have to kind of hold all

2:33:12.320 --> 2:33:16.400
 those things together and like keep pushing forward through the frustration of really,

2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:23.280
 like, obviously not understanding certain like parts of the picture, like your giant missing

2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:30.000
 parts of the picture, and still not giving up. It's the same way I feel about running. And there's

2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:37.120
 something about falling in love with the feeling of after you went through the journey of not having

2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:42.400
 a complete picture at the end, having a complete picture, and then you get to appreciate the beauty

2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:48.320
 and just remembering that it sucked for a long time. And how great it felt when you figured

2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:52.880
 it out, at least at the basic, that's not sort of research thinking. Because with research,

2:33:52.880 --> 2:34:02.400
 you probably also have to enjoy the dead ends with learning math from a textbook or from a video.

2:34:02.400 --> 2:34:05.680
 There's a nice... I think you have to enjoy the dead ends, but I think you have to accept the

2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:11.040
 dead ends. That means that let's put it that way. Well, yeah, enjoy the suffering of it. So

2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:18.880
 the way I think about it, I do... I don't enjoy the suffering. It pisses me off,

2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:22.080
 by the way. You've got to accept that it's part of the process. It's interesting. There's a lot of

2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:27.200
 ways to kind of deal with that dead end. There's a guy who's ultramarathon runner, Navy Seal, David

2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:35.600
 Goggins, who kind of... I mean, there's a certain philosophy of most people would quit here.

2:34:37.600 --> 2:34:44.240
 And so if most people would quit here, and I don't, I'll have an opportunity to discover

2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:53.600
 something beautiful that others haven't yet. So any feeling that really sucks, it's like, okay,

2:34:54.240 --> 2:34:59.680
 most people would just go do something smarter. And if I stick with this,

2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:06.000
 I will discover a new garden of fruit trees that I can pick.

2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:11.120
 Okay, you say that, but what about the guy who wins the Nathan's hotdog eating contest every year?

2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:15.600
 Like when he eats his 35th hotdog, he correctly says, okay, most people would stop here.

2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:19.840
 Are you lauding that he's like, no, I'm going to eat the 36th hotdog again?

2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:28.320
 I am. In the long arc of history, that man is onto something, which brings up this question.

2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:33.840
 What advice would you give to young people today, thinking about their career, about their life,

2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:39.360
 whether it's in mathematics, poetry, or hotdog eating contest?

2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:43.760
 And, you know, I have kids, so this is actually a live issue for me, right?

2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:47.120
 I actually, it's not a thought experiment. I actually do have to give advice to

2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:50.080
 two young people all the time. They don't listen, but I still give it.

2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:56.160
 You know, one thing I often say to students, I don't think I've actually said this to

2:35:56.160 --> 2:36:01.280
 my kids yet, but I say to students a lot is, you know, you come to these decision points,

2:36:01.280 --> 2:36:09.600
 and everybody is beset by self doubt, right? It's like, not sure like what they're capable of,

2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:16.160
 like not sure what they're, what they really want to do. I always, I sort of tell people,

2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:22.480
 like often when you have a decision to make, one of the choices is the high self esteem choice.

2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:26.640
 And I always make the high self esteem choice, make the choice, sort of take yourself out of it,

2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:32.000
 and like if you didn't have those, you can probably figure out what the version of you

2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:37.040
 feels completely confident would do and do that and see what happens. And I think that's often

2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:43.920
 like pretty good advice. That's interesting. Sort of like, you know, like with Sims,

2:36:43.920 --> 2:36:49.280
 you can create characters, like create a character of yourself that lacks all the self doubt.

2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:53.920
 Right, but it doesn't mean, I would never say to somebody, you should just go have

2:36:53.920 --> 2:36:58.080
 high self esteem. Yeah, you shouldn't have doubts. No, you probably should have doubts.

2:36:58.080 --> 2:37:02.640
 It's okay to have them. But sometimes it's good to act in the way that the person who didn't have

2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:11.680
 them would act. That's a really nice way to put it. Yeah, that's a, that's a like from a third person

2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:17.040
 perspective. Take the part of your brain that wants to do big things. What would they do?

2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:24.480
 That's not afraid to do those things. What would they do? Yeah, that's, that's really nice. That's

2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:28.320
 actually a really nice way to formulate it. It's very practical advice. You should go to your kids.

2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:35.360
 Do you think there's meaning to any of it from a mathematical perspective, this life?

2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:42.000
 If I were to ask you, we're talking about primes, talking about proving stuff.

2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:49.120
 Can we say, and then the book that God has, that mathematics allows us to arrive at something about

2:37:49.120 --> 2:37:54.800
 in that book, there's certainly a chapter on the meaning of life in that book. Do you think we humans

2:37:54.800 --> 2:37:59.520
 can get to it? And maybe if you were to write cliff notes, what do you suspect those cliff notes

2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:05.120
 would say? I mean, look, the way I feel is that, you know, mathematics, as we've discussed, like it

2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:10.800
 underlies the way we think about constructing learning machines and underlies physics. It

2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:17.200
 can be you. I mean, it does all this stuff. And also you want the meaning of life. I mean,

2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:24.720
 it's like, we already did a lot for you. Like ask a rabbi. No, I mean, I wrote a lot in the

2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:32.560
 last book, how not to be wrong. Yeah, I wrote a lot about Pascal, a fascinating guy who is a sort

2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:37.440
 of very serious religious mystic as well as being an amazing mathematician. And he's well

2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:41.040
 known for Pascal's wager. I mean, he's probably among all mathematicians, he's the ones who's

2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:46.400
 best known for this. Can you actually like apply mathematics to kind of these transcendent

2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:54.400
 questions? But what's interesting when I really read Pascal about what he wrote about this,

2:38:54.400 --> 2:38:58.000
 you know, I started to see that people often think, oh, this is him saying, I'm going to use

2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:04.240
 mathematics to sort of show you why you should believe in God, you know, to really that's this

2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:09.600
 is mathematics has the answer to this question. But he really doesn't say that he almost kind of

2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:15.440
 says the opposite. If you ask blaze Pascal, like why do you believe in God? It's he'd be like,

2:39:15.440 --> 2:39:20.240
 oh, because I met God, you know, he had this kind of like psychedelic experience, this is like

2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:25.040
 a mystical experience where as he tells it, he just like directly encountered God. It's like,

2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:29.040
 okay, I guess there's a God, I met him last night. So that's that's it. That's why he believed it

2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:34.640
 didn't have to do with any kind of you know, the mathematical argument was like, about certain

2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:39.120
 reasons for behaving in a certain way. But he basically said like, look, like math doesn't tell

2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:45.600
 you that God's there or not like, if God's there, he'll tell you, you know, you know, I love this.

2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:51.280
 So you have you have mathematics, you have, what do you what do you have, like a waste of

2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:57.200
 sport of the mind, let's say psychedelics, you have like incredible technology, you also have

2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:02.160
 love and friendship and like, what, what the hell do you want to know what the meaning of it all is?

2:40:02.160 --> 2:40:07.360
 Just enjoy it. I don't think there's a better way to end it. Jordan, this was a fascinating

2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:15.920
 conversation. I really love the way you explore math in your writing, the, the willingness to be

2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:22.320
 specific and clear and actually explore difficult ideas, but at the same time, stepping outside

2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:30.240
 and figuring out beautiful stuff. And I love the chart at the opening of your new book that shows

2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:35.600
 the chaos, the mess that is your mind. Yes, this is what I was trying to keep in my head all at once

2:40:35.600 --> 2:40:40.800
 while I was writing. And I probably should have drawn this picture earlier on the process. Maybe

2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:45.840
 it would have made my organization easier. I actually drew it only at the end. And many of the

2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:51.200
 things we talked about are on this map, the connections are yet to be fully dissected and

2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:58.000
 dissected and investigated. And yes, God is in the picture. Right on the edge, right on the edge,

2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:03.920
 not in the center. Thank you so much for talking. It is a huge honor that you would waste your valuable

2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:08.400
 time with me. Thank you, Lex. We went to some amazing places today. This is really fun.

2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:13.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jordan Ellenberg. And thank you to

2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:19.840
 Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist and Indeed. Check them out in the description to support

2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:25.680
 this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Jordan in his book, How Not to Be Wrong.

2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:32.320
 Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of xray specs that reveal hidden structures

2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:37.680
 underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you

2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:51.200
 next time.
