00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
 The following is a conversation with Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist, astronomer, and cosmologist

00:05.200 --> 00:12.000
 at Harvard. He has authored over 800 papers and written eight books, including his latest,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.840
 called Extra Terrestrial, The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth. It'll be released

00:17.840 --> 00:22.880
 in a couple of weeks, so go preorder it now to show support for what I think is truly an important

00:22.880 --> 00:29.040
 book in that it serves as a strong example of a scientist being both rigorous and open minded

00:29.040 --> 00:35.920
 about the question of intelligent alien civilizations in our universe. Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:35.920 --> 00:42.160
 zero fasting app for intermittent fasting, element electrolyte drink, sunbasket meal

00:42.160 --> 00:48.480
 delivery service, and pessimist archive history podcast. So the choice is a fasting app,

00:48.480 --> 00:55.200
 fasting fuel, fast breaking, delicious meals, and the history podcast that has very little to do

00:55.200 --> 01:00.160
 with fasting. Choose wisely, my friends, and if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a

01:05.680 --> 01:13.360
 is so exciting to me and I think to a lot of people. In 2017, a strange interstellar object,

01:13.360 --> 01:19.680
 now named a Moa Moa, it's fun to say, was detected traveling through our solar system.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.840
 Based on the evidence we have, it has strange characteristics which made it not like any

01:23.840 --> 01:29.680
 asteroid or comet that we've seen before. Avi was one of the only world class scientists who

01:29.680 --> 01:36.240
 fearlessly suggested that we should be open minded about whether it is naturally made or in fact

01:36.240 --> 01:42.080
 is an artifact of an intelligent alien civilization. In fact, he suggested that the more likely

01:42.080 --> 01:48.080
 explanation given the evidence is the latter hypothesis. We also talk about a lot of fascinating

01:48.080 --> 01:53.920
 mysteries in our universe including black holes, dark matter, the big bang, and close the speed

01:53.920 --> 02:00.400
 of light space travel. The theme throughout is that in scientific pursuits, the weird things,

02:00.400 --> 02:05.920
 the anomalies, the ideas that right now are considered taboo should not be ignored if we're

02:05.920 --> 02:12.640
 to have a chance at finding the next big breakthrough, the next big paradigm shift, and also if we are

02:12.640 --> 02:18.960
 to inspire the world with the power and beauty of science. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on

02:32.320 --> 02:37.440
 to your new book, Extra Terrestrial, you write, this book confronts one of the universe's most

02:37.440 --> 02:44.640
 profound questions. Are we alone? Over time, this question has been framed in different ways. Is

02:44.640 --> 02:50.160
 life here on earth the only life in the universe? Are humans the only sentient intelligence in the

02:50.160 --> 02:55.680
 vastness of space and time? A better, more precise framing of this question would be this.

02:56.720 --> 03:02.080
 Throughout the expanse of space and over the lifetime of the universe, are there now or have

03:02.080 --> 03:09.200
 ever been other sentient civilizations that, like ours, explored the stars and left evidence

03:09.200 --> 03:16.240
 of their efforts? So let me ask, are we alone? That's an excellent question. For me, the answer is

03:17.280 --> 03:24.320
 sort of clear because I start from the principle of modesty. You know, if we believe that we are

03:24.320 --> 03:30.720
 alone and special and unique, that shows organs. My daughters, when they were infants, they tended

03:30.720 --> 03:36.880
 to think that they are special, unique. And then they went out to the street and realized that other

03:36.880 --> 03:43.040
 kids are very much like them. And then they developed a sense of a better perspective about

03:43.040 --> 03:48.480
 themselves. And I think the only reason that we are still thinking that we are special is because

03:48.480 --> 03:55.840
 we haven't searched well enough to find others that might even be better than us. And you know,

03:55.840 --> 04:00.560
 I say that because I look at the newspaper every morning and I see that we do foolish things. We

04:00.560 --> 04:05.280
 are not necessarily the most intelligent ones. And if you think about it, if you open a recipe book,

04:05.920 --> 04:11.680
 you see that out of the same ingredients, you can make very different cakes, depending on how

04:11.680 --> 04:18.720
 you put them together and how you heat them up. And what is the chance that by taking the soup of

04:18.720 --> 04:25.280
 chemicals that existed on earth and cooking it one way to get our life, that you got the best

04:25.280 --> 04:32.560
 cake possible? I mean, we are probably not the sharpest cookie in the jar. And my question is,

04:32.560 --> 04:37.680
 I mean, it's pretty obvious to me that we are probably not alone because half of all the sunlight

04:37.680 --> 04:43.680
 stars we know now as astronomers, half of the sunlight stars from the Kepler satellite data

04:43.680 --> 04:51.040
 have a planet the size of the earth, roughly at the same distance that the earth is from the sun.

04:51.040 --> 04:56.240
 And that means that they can have liquid water on their surface and the chemistry of life as we

04:56.240 --> 05:01.920
 know it. So if you roll the dice billions of times just within the Milky Way galaxy,

05:02.880 --> 05:08.560
 and then you have tens of billions of galaxies like it within the observable volume of the

05:08.560 --> 05:12.720
 universe, it would be extremely arrogant to think that we are special. I would think that we are

05:12.720 --> 05:18.480
 sort of middle of the road, typical forms of life. And that's why nobody pays attention to us.

05:18.480 --> 05:24.640
 You know, if you go down the street on a sidewalk and you see an ant, you don't pay attention or

05:24.640 --> 05:30.800
 a special respect to that ant, you just continue to walk. And so I think that we are sort of average,

05:30.800 --> 05:35.920
 not very interesting, not exciting. So nobody cares about us. We tend to think that we are

05:35.920 --> 05:40.320
 special, but that's a sign of immaturity. And we're very early on in our development.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.760
 Yes, that's another thing that we have our technology only for 100 years. And it's evolving

05:45.760 --> 05:51.520
 exponentially right now on a three year timescale. So imagine what would happen in 100 years,

05:51.520 --> 05:56.720
 in 1000 years, in a million years or in a billion years. Now the sun is actually

05:57.760 --> 06:02.720
 relatively late in the star formation history of the universe. Most of the sunlight stars formed

06:02.720 --> 06:10.320
 earlier. And some of them already died, you know, became white dwarfs. And so if you imagine that

06:10.320 --> 06:16.880
 a civilization like ours existed around a typical sunlight star, by now, if they survive,

06:16.880 --> 06:22.240
 they could be a billion years old. And then imagine a billion year technology,

06:22.240 --> 06:27.200
 it would look like magic to us, you know, an approximation to God, we wouldn't be able to

06:27.200 --> 06:34.160
 understand it. And so in my view, we should be humble. And by the way, we should probably just

06:34.160 --> 06:41.920
 listen and not speak. Because there is a risk, right? If if if you are inferior, there is a risk

06:41.920 --> 06:49.200
 if you speak too loudly. Something bad may happen to you. You mentioned we should be humble also in

06:49.200 --> 06:57.840
 the sense with the analogy to ants, that they might be better than us. So there's a kind of scale

06:57.840 --> 07:04.160
 that we're talking about. And in the question, you mentioned the word sentient. So sentience, or

07:04.160 --> 07:12.480
 maybe the more basic formulation of that is consciousness. Do you think do you think that

07:13.040 --> 07:20.400
 this thing within us humans in terms of the typical life form of consciousness is the essential

07:20.400 --> 07:26.400
 element that permeates other if if there's other alien civilizations out there that they have something

07:26.400 --> 07:32.480
 like consciousness as well? Or is this I guess I'm asking, can you try to untangle the word sentient?

07:33.280 --> 07:39.120
 Yeah, so that's that's a good question. I think what is most abundant, depending on how long it

07:39.120 --> 07:47.200
 survives. So if you look at us as an example, we are now we do have consciousness and we do have

07:47.200 --> 07:54.720
 technology. But the technologies that we are developing are also means for our own destruction,

07:54.720 --> 07:58.880
 as we can tell, you know, we can change the climate if we are not careful enough,

07:59.680 --> 08:06.720
 we can go into nuclear wars. So we are developing means for our own destruction through self

08:06.720 --> 08:14.400
 inflicted wounds. And it might well be that creatures like us are not long lived, that the

08:14.400 --> 08:20.880
 crocodiles on other planets live for billions of years, they don't destroy themselves, they live

08:20.880 --> 08:26.880
 naturally. And so if you look around, the most common thing would be dumb animals that live for

08:26.880 --> 08:33.760
 long times, you know, not those that have conscious. But in terms of changing the environment, I think

08:34.560 --> 08:42.480
 since I mean, humans develop tools, they've developed the ability to construct technologies

08:42.480 --> 08:48.720
 that would lift us from this planet that we were born in. And that's something animals without

08:48.720 --> 08:54.720
 the conscious consciousness cannot really do. And, and so I, you know, in terms of

08:56.320 --> 09:02.880
 looking for things that are new, that went beyond the circumstances they were born into,

09:03.840 --> 09:08.960
 I would think that even if they're short lived, these are the creatures that made the biggest

09:08.960 --> 09:13.920
 difference to their environment. And we can search for them, you know, even if they're short lived,

09:13.920 --> 09:18.000
 and most of the civilizations are dead by now. Yeah, even if that's the case,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.240
 that's sad to think about, by the way. Well, but if you look on earth, that, you know,

09:22.240 --> 09:26.000
 there are lots of cultures that existed throughout time, and they're dead by now,

09:26.000 --> 09:32.320
 the Mayan culture was very sophisticated, died, but we can find evidence for it and learn about it

09:32.320 --> 09:38.000
 just by archaeology, digging into the ground looking. And so we can do the same thing in space,

09:38.000 --> 09:45.920
 look for dead civilizations. And perhaps we can learn a lesson why they died and behave better

09:45.920 --> 09:50.720
 so that we will not share the same fate. So I think, you know, there is a lesson to be learned

09:50.720 --> 09:56.800
 from the sky. And by the way, I should also say, if we find the technology that we have not

09:56.800 --> 10:03.760
 dreamed of, that we can import to earth, that may be a better strategy for making a fortune

10:03.760 --> 10:10.800
 than going to Silicon Valley or going to Wall Street. Because you learn, you make a jump start

10:10.800 --> 10:14.640
 into something of the future. So that's one way to do the leap is actually to find,

10:14.640 --> 10:21.280
 to literally discover versus come up with the idea in our own limited human capacity,

10:21.280 --> 10:26.080
 like a cognitive capacity. It would look like it would feel like cheating in an exam where

10:26.080 --> 10:32.000
 you look over the shoulder of a student next to you. But it's not good on an exam, but it is good

10:32.000 --> 10:36.720
 when you're coming up with technology that could change the fabric of human civilization. But

10:37.680 --> 10:43.120
 there is, you know, in my neck of the woods of artificial intelligence, there's a lot of

10:43.120 --> 10:52.080
 trajectories one can imagine of creating very powerful beings, the technology that's essentially,

10:52.880 --> 10:58.000
 you know, you can call superintelligence that could achieve space exploration,

10:58.000 --> 11:03.840
 all those kinds of things without consciousness, without something that to us humans looks like

11:03.840 --> 11:10.720
 consciousness. And there, you know, there is a sad feeling I have that consciousness too,

11:10.720 --> 11:17.520
 in terms of us being humble, is a thing we humans take too seriously, that it's we think

11:17.520 --> 11:21.440
 it's special just because we have it. But it could be a thing that's actually holding us back

11:21.440 --> 11:26.800
 in some kind of way. It may well be. It may well be. I should say something about AI, because I do

11:26.800 --> 11:34.240
 think it offers a very important step into the future. If you look at the Old Testament, the

11:34.240 --> 11:42.240
 Bible, there is this story about Noach's Ark that you might know about. Yes. Noach knew about

11:42.240 --> 11:48.880
 a great flood that is about to endanger all life on earth. So he decided to build an Ark.

11:49.680 --> 11:55.440
 And the Bible actually talks about specifically what the size of this Ark was, what the dimensions

11:55.440 --> 12:01.520
 were. Turns out it was quite similar to Uumuamua that we will discuss in a few minutes. But

12:01.520 --> 12:08.160
 at any event, he built this Ark, and he put animals on it so that they were saved from the great

12:08.160 --> 12:14.960
 flood. Now, you can think about doing the same on earth, because there are risks for future

12:14.960 --> 12:19.680
 catastrophes. You know, we could have the self inflicted wounds that we were talking about,

12:19.680 --> 12:26.080
 like nuclear war, changing the climate, or there could be an asteroid impacting us just like the

12:26.080 --> 12:32.400
 dinosaurs died. The dinosaurs didn't have size, astronomy, they couldn't have a warning system,

12:32.400 --> 12:37.680
 but there was this big stone, big rock that approached them. It must have been a beautiful

12:37.680 --> 12:43.200
 sight just when it was approaching, got very big and then smashed them and killed them.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.320
 So you could have a catastrophe like that, or in a billion years, the sun will basically boil

12:48.320 --> 12:56.400
 off all the oceans on earth. And currently, all our eggs are in one basket, but we can spread them.

12:57.120 --> 13:02.400
 It's sort of like the printing press, if you think about it, the revolution that Gutenberg

13:02.400 --> 13:07.600
 brought is there were very few copies of the Bible at the time, and each of them was precious

13:07.600 --> 13:13.360
 because it was handwritten. But once the printing press produced multiple copies, you know, if

13:13.360 --> 13:18.160
 something bad happened to one of the copies, it wasn't a catastrophe, you know, it wasn't a disaster,

13:18.160 --> 13:25.600
 because you had many more copies. And so if we have copies of life here on earth elsewhere,

13:25.600 --> 13:33.040
 then we avoid the risk of it being eliminated by a single point breakdown, a catastrophe.

13:33.040 --> 13:40.080
 So the question is, can we build NOx spaceship that will carry life as we know it? Now, you might

13:40.080 --> 13:46.720
 think we have to put elephants and whales and birds on a big spaceship. But that's not true,

13:46.720 --> 13:53.840
 because all you need to know is the DNA making, the genetic making of these animals, put it on

13:53.840 --> 14:03.120
 a computer system that has AI plus a 3D printer, so that this cubesat, which is rather small,

14:03.760 --> 14:08.480
 can go with this information to another planet and use the raw materials there

14:08.480 --> 14:14.960
 to produce synthetic life. And that would be a way of producing copies, just like the Gutenberg

14:15.600 --> 14:19.840
 printing press. Yeah, and it doesn't have to be exact copies of the humans, it could just

14:19.840 --> 14:26.080
 contain some basic elements of life and then have enough life on board that it could

14:27.760 --> 14:33.280
 reproduce the process of evolution on another place. Right. So that also makes you sad, of course,

14:33.280 --> 14:37.920
 because you confront the mortality of your own little precious consciousness and all your own

14:37.920 --> 14:42.080
 memories and knowledge and all that stuff. That's right. But who cares? I mean, we are not so...

14:42.080 --> 14:46.160
 I care about mine, right? And you care about yours. No, no, I actually don't. You know,

14:46.160 --> 14:50.400
 if you look at the big... If you're an astronomer, one thing that you learn from the universe is

14:50.400 --> 14:55.360
 to be modest, because you are not so significant. Oh, boy. I mean, think about it. All these

14:55.360 --> 14:59.920
 emperors and kings that conquered the peace of land on Earth and were extremely proud. You know,

14:59.920 --> 15:09.600
 you see these images of kings and emperors that usually are alpha males and they stand strong and

15:10.480 --> 15:14.720
 they're very proud of themselves. But if you think about it, there are 10 to the power 20

15:15.280 --> 15:22.160
 planets like the Earth in the observable volume of the universe. And this view of conquering a

15:22.160 --> 15:28.720
 piece of land that even conquering all of Earth is just like an ant hugging a single grain of sand

15:28.720 --> 15:34.960
 on the landscape of a huge beach. That's not very impressive. So you can't be arrogant. If you see

15:34.960 --> 15:41.280
 the big picture, you have to be humble. You know, also we are short lived. You know, within 100 years,

15:41.280 --> 15:48.000
 that's it, right? So what does it teach you? First, to be humble, modest. You never have

15:48.000 --> 15:52.960
 significant powers relative to the big scheme of things. And second, you should appreciate every

15:52.960 --> 16:01.840
 day that you live and learn about the world. Humble and still grateful. Yes, exactly. Well, let's

16:02.800 --> 16:10.240
 talk about probably the most interesting object I've heard about and also the most fun to pronounce.

16:12.240 --> 16:18.400
 Can you tell me the story of this object and why it may be an important event in human history?

16:18.400 --> 16:26.560
 And is it possibly a piece of alien technology? Right. So this is the first object that was

16:26.560 --> 16:36.320
 spotted close to Earth from outside the solar system. And it was found on October 19, 2017.

16:37.120 --> 16:43.920
 And at that time, it was receding away from us. And at first, astronomers thought it must be a

16:43.920 --> 16:49.040
 piece of rock, you know, just like all the asteroids and comets that we have seen from within the solar

16:49.040 --> 16:54.960
 system. And it just came from another star. I should say that the actual discovery of this

16:54.960 --> 17:00.000
 object was surprising to me because a decade earlier, I wrote the first paper together with

17:00.000 --> 17:06.880
 Ed Turner and Amaya Morrow Martin, that tried to predict whether the same telescope that was

17:06.880 --> 17:13.840
 serving the sky, pan stars from Hawaii, would find anything from interstellar space, given what we

17:13.840 --> 17:18.720
 know about the solar system. So if you assume that other planetary systems have similar

17:18.720 --> 17:24.080
 abundance of rocks and you just calculate how many should be ejected into interstellar space,

17:24.640 --> 17:31.040
 the conclusion is no, we shouldn't find anything with pan stars. To me, I apologize,

17:31.040 --> 17:36.640
 probably reviewing my stupidity, but it was surprising to me that so few interstellar objects

17:36.640 --> 17:44.400
 from outside this whole system have ever been detected or none. None has been. You do maybe

17:44.400 --> 17:50.640
 talk about it that there has been one or two rocks since then. Well, since then, there was one

17:50.640 --> 17:57.280
 called the Borisov. It was discovered by an amateur Russian astronomer, Gennady Borisov.

17:57.280 --> 18:05.360
 And that one looked like a comet. And just like a comet from within the solar system.

18:05.360 --> 18:10.160
 But this is a really important point. Sorry to interrupt that. You showed that it's unlikely

18:10.160 --> 18:16.320
 that a rock from another solar system would arrive to ours. Right. And so the actual detection of

18:16.320 --> 18:24.000
 this one was surprising by itself, to me. Yes. But then, so at first they thought maybe it's a

18:24.000 --> 18:28.320
 comet or an asteroid, but then it looked, it didn't look like anything we've seen before.

18:29.040 --> 18:34.480
 Borisov did look like a comet. So people asked me afterwards and said, you know,

18:35.600 --> 18:40.480
 doesn't it convince you that if Borisov looks like a comet, doesn't it convince you that

18:40.480 --> 18:46.400
 Oumuamua is also natural? Yeah. And I said, you know, when I went on the first date with my wife,

18:47.520 --> 18:52.000
 she looked special to me. Yes. And since then I met many women. Yes. That didn't change my

18:52.000 --> 19:00.560
 opinion of my wife. You know, that's not an argument. Anyway, so why did Oumuamua look

19:00.560 --> 19:06.160
 weird? Let me explain. So first of all, astronomers monitored the amount of light,

19:06.160 --> 19:14.080
 sunlight that it reflects. And it was tumbling, spinning every eight hours. And as it was spinning,

19:14.080 --> 19:18.880
 the brightness that we saw from that direction, we couldn't resolve it because it's tiny. It's

19:18.880 --> 19:24.880
 about 100 meters, a few hundred feet, size of a football field. And we cannot, from Earth,

19:24.880 --> 19:30.720
 we with existing telescopes, we cannot resolve it. The only way to actually get a photograph of it

19:30.720 --> 19:38.480
 is to send the camera close to it. And that was not possible at the time that Oumuamua was

19:38.480 --> 19:43.360
 discovered because it was already moving away from us faster than any rocket we can send.

19:43.360 --> 19:48.400
 It's sort of like a guest that appeared for dinner. And then by the time we realized that

19:48.400 --> 19:54.960
 it's weird, the guest is already out the front door into the dark street. What we would like

19:54.960 --> 19:59.920
 to find is an object like it approaching us because then you can send the camera irrespective

19:59.920 --> 20:07.280
 of how fast it moves. And if we were to find it in July 2017, that would have been possible

20:07.280 --> 20:12.800
 because it was approaching us at that time. Actually, I was visiting Mount Haleakala

20:12.800 --> 20:18.560
 in Maui, Hawaii with my family for vacation at that time in July 2017. But nobody knew

20:20.640 --> 20:26.720
 at the observatory that the Oumuamua is very close. That's sad to think about that. We had

20:26.720 --> 20:32.000
 the opportunity at that time to send up a camera. But don't worry. I mean, there will be more.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.880
 There will be more because I operate by the Copernican principle, which says we don't leave

20:38.880 --> 20:46.080
 at a special place and we don't leave at a special time. And that means if we surveyed the sky for

20:46.080 --> 20:53.120
 a few years and we had sensitivity to this region between us and the sun, and we found this object

20:53.120 --> 20:59.360
 with panstas, there should be many more that we will find in the future with surveys that

20:59.360 --> 21:06.240
 might be even better. And actually, in three years time scale, there would be the so called LST.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.760
 That's a survey of the Vera Rubin Observatory that would be much more sensitive and could

21:11.760 --> 21:18.880
 potentially find an Oumuamua like object every month. Okay, so I'm just waiting for that. And

21:18.880 --> 21:25.760
 the main reason for me to alert everyone to the unusual properties of Oumuamua is with the hope

21:25.760 --> 21:31.040
 that next time around when we see something as unusual, we would take a photograph or we would

21:31.040 --> 21:36.240
 get as much evidence as possible because science is based on evidence, not on prejudice. And we

21:36.240 --> 21:40.880
 will get back to that theme. So anyway, let me let me point out some of the properties actually,

21:40.880 --> 21:47.360
 yeah, the elongated nature, all those other things. So the light, the amount of light sunlight that

21:47.360 --> 21:55.360
 was reflected from it was changing over eight hours by a factor of 10, meaning that the area

21:55.360 --> 22:01.600
 of this object, even though we can't resolve it, the area on the sky that reflects sunlight

22:02.320 --> 22:09.680
 was bigger by a factor of 10 in some phases as it was tumbling around than in other phases. So

22:09.680 --> 22:14.880
 even if you take a piece of paper that is razor thin, you know, it's there is a very small likelihood

22:14.880 --> 22:21.600
 that it's exactly a John. And getting a factor of 10 change in the area that you see on the sky

22:21.600 --> 22:28.400
 is huge. It's much more than any. It means that the object has an unusual geometry. It's at least

22:28.400 --> 22:32.560
 a factor of a few more than any of the comets or asteroids that we have seen before.

22:32.560 --> 22:38.400
 You mentioned reflectivity. So it's not just the geometry, but the properties of the surface of that

22:38.400 --> 22:45.280
 thing. Well, or no, if you assume the reflectivity is the same, then it's just geometry. If you

22:45.280 --> 22:50.960
 assume the reflectivity may change, then it could be a combination of the area that you see and

22:50.960 --> 22:56.000
 the reflectivity, because different directions may reflect differently. But the point is that

22:56.000 --> 23:03.680
 it's very extreme. Yes. And it actually the best fit to the light curve that we saw was of a flat

23:03.680 --> 23:11.200
 object. Unlike all the cartoons that you have seen of a cigar shape, a flat object at the 90%

23:11.200 --> 23:17.840
 confidence gives a better model for the way that the light varied. And it's like flat meaning like

23:17.840 --> 23:25.680
 a pancake like a pancake. Exactly. And so that's, you know, the very first unusual property. But

23:25.680 --> 23:31.280
 to me, it was not unusual enough to think that it might be artificial. It was not

23:31.280 --> 23:38.560
 significant enough. Then there was no cometary tail, you know, no dust, no gas around this

23:38.560 --> 23:44.880
 object. And the Spitzer Space Telescope really searched very deeply for carbon based molecules.

23:44.880 --> 23:49.840
 There was nothing. So it's definitely not a comet the way people expected it to be.

23:49.840 --> 23:55.840
 Can you maybe briefly mention what property is a comet that you're referring to usually has?

23:55.840 --> 24:02.960
 Right. So a comet is a rock that has some water ice on the surface. So you can think of it as an

24:02.960 --> 24:12.400
 icy rock. Actually, comets were discovered a long time ago. But the first model that was developed

24:12.400 --> 24:19.920
 for them was by Fred the Whipple, who was at Harvard. And I think the legend goes that he got the

24:19.920 --> 24:27.040
 idea from walking through Harvard Square and seeing during a winter day and seeing these icy rocks,

24:27.040 --> 24:34.960
 you know, and so a comet is icy. It's just a rock. It's just a rock. So when you have ice on the

24:34.960 --> 24:43.520
 surface, when the rock gets close to the sun, the sunlight warms it up. And the ice sublimates,

24:43.520 --> 24:51.040
 evaporates. Because the one thing about ice, water ice, is it doesn't become liquid if you warm it up

24:51.040 --> 24:58.000
 in vacuum, you know, without an external pressure. It just goes straight into gas. And that's what

24:58.000 --> 25:05.280
 you see as the tail of a comet. The only way to get liquid water is to have an atmosphere like on

25:05.280 --> 25:11.680
 Earth that has an external pressure. Only then you get liquid. And that's why it's essential to have

25:11.680 --> 25:17.120
 an atmosphere to a planet in order to have liquid water and the chemistry of life. So if you look

25:17.120 --> 25:23.760
 at Mars, Mars lost its atmosphere. And therefore, no liquid water on the surface anymore. I mean,

25:23.760 --> 25:30.000
 there may have been early and that's what the Perseverance survey, you know, the Perseverance

25:30.000 --> 25:35.200
 mission will try to find out whether it had liquid water, whether there was life, perhaps,

25:35.200 --> 25:41.200
 on it at the time. But at some point, it lost its atmosphere. And then the liquid water was gone.

25:41.200 --> 25:47.760
 So the only reason that we can live on Earth is because of the atmosphere. But a comet is in

25:47.760 --> 25:55.920
 vacuum, pretty much. And when it gets warmed up on the surface, the water becomes the water ice

25:55.920 --> 26:03.120
 becomes gas. And then you see this cometary tail behind it. In addition to water, there is that

26:03.120 --> 26:08.240
 there are all kinds of carbon based molecules or dust that comes off the surface. And those are

26:08.240 --> 26:14.000
 detectable. Yeah, it's easy to detect. It's very prominent. You see these cometary tails that look

26:14.000 --> 26:18.160
 very prominent because they reflect sunlight. And you can see them. In fact, it's sometimes

26:18.160 --> 26:24.000
 difficult to see the nucleus of the comet, because it's surrounded and shrouded with. And in this

26:24.000 --> 26:28.800
 case, there was no trace of anything. That's fascinating. Now, you might say, okay, it's not

26:28.800 --> 26:32.960
 a, so that's what the community said. Okay, it's not a no problem. It's still a rock, you know,

26:32.960 --> 26:40.000
 it's not a comet, but it's just a rock, bare rock, you know, okay, no problem. Then, and that's the

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
 thing that convinced me to write about it. And then in June 2018, you know, significantly later,

26:46.880 --> 26:55.200
 there was a report that in fact, the object exhibited an excess push in addition to the

26:55.200 --> 27:00.240
 force of gravity. So the sun acts on it by gravity, but then there was an extra push on

27:00.240 --> 27:06.720
 this object that was figured out from the orbit that you can trace. And the question was, what is

27:06.720 --> 27:12.320
 this excess push? So for comets, you get the rocket effect. When you evaporate gas, you know,

27:12.320 --> 27:19.280
 just like a jet engine on an airplane, you throw a jet engine is very simple, you throw the gas back,

27:19.280 --> 27:24.400
 and it pushes the airplane forward. That's all. That's how a jet. So in a case of a comet, you

27:24.400 --> 27:30.400
 throw gas in the direction of the sun because it's, and then you get a push. Okay. So in the

27:30.400 --> 27:36.000
 case of comets, you can get a push, but there was no cometary tail. So then people say, oh, wait a

27:36.000 --> 27:41.200
 second. Is it an asteroid? No, but it behaves like a comet, but it doesn't look like a comet.

27:41.200 --> 27:46.240
 So what, well, forget about it, business as usual. So that's what they mean by a non

27:46.240 --> 27:51.760
 gravitation, non gravitational acceleration. So that's interesting. So like the primary force

27:51.760 --> 27:57.360
 acting on something like just a rock like an asteroid would be like you can predict a trajectory

27:57.360 --> 28:02.880
 based on the gravity, based on gravity. And also here there's detected movement that's not,

28:02.880 --> 28:07.120
 cannot be accounted purely by the gravity of the sun. And if it was a comet, you would need

28:07.120 --> 28:13.600
 about a tenth of the mass of this comet, the weight of this comet to be evaporated in order

28:13.600 --> 28:19.200
 to give it. And there was no sign of that. No sign. 10% of the mass evaporating. It's huge.

28:19.200 --> 28:24.560
 Think about it, a 100 meter size object losing 10% of its mass. You can't miss that.

28:25.440 --> 28:30.880
 And so that's super weird. It's super weird. What is there a good expo? Is there in your mind

28:30.880 --> 28:34.560
 a possible explanation for that? You know, so I operated just like Sherlock Holmes in a way.

28:35.280 --> 28:39.760
 I said, okay, what are the possibilities? And the only thing I could think, so I ruled out

28:39.760 --> 28:46.720
 everything else. And I said, it must be the sunlight reflected off it. Okay. So the sunlight

28:46.720 --> 28:53.440
 reflects off the surface and gives it a push, just like you get a push on a sail on a boat,

28:53.440 --> 28:59.040
 you know, from the wind reflecting off it. Now, in order for this to be effective,

28:59.040 --> 29:04.880
 it turns out the object needs to be extremely thin. It turns out it needs to be less than a

29:04.880 --> 29:13.120
 millimeter thick. Nature does not produce such things. So but we produce it because it's called

29:13.120 --> 29:19.040
 the technology of a light sail. So we are for space exploration, we are exploring this technology

29:19.040 --> 29:25.040
 because it has the benefit of not needing to carry the fuel with the spacecraft. So you don't have

29:25.040 --> 29:32.880
 the fuel, you just have a you just have a sail and it's being pushed either by sunlight or by a

29:32.880 --> 29:40.320
 laser beam or whatever. So perhaps this is a light sail. So this is actually the same technology

29:40.320 --> 29:46.640
 with the with the Starshot project? Yes. So you know, people afterwards say, okay, you work on

29:46.640 --> 29:50.960
 this project, you imagine, you know, no, that's a pretty good explanation, right? Obviously,

29:50.960 --> 29:55.920
 my imagination is limited by what I know. So I, you know, I would not deny that,

29:56.560 --> 30:01.200
 you know, working on light sails expanded my ability to imagine this possibility.

30:01.840 --> 30:07.440
 But let me offer another interesting anecdote. In September this year, 2020, I mean,

30:08.560 --> 30:17.600
 2020, there was another object found. And it was given the name 2020 SO by the

30:17.600 --> 30:24.320
 Minor Planet Center. You know, this is an organization actually in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

30:24.320 --> 30:30.080
 that gives names to objects, astronomical objects found in the solar system. And they gave it that

30:30.080 --> 30:37.840
 name 2020 SO because you know, it looked like an object in the solar system. And it moved in an orbit

30:37.840 --> 30:44.320
 that is similar to the orbit of the earth, but not the same exactly. And therefore, it was bound

30:44.320 --> 30:51.680
 to the sun, but it also exhibited a deviation from what you expect based on gravity. So they

30:51.680 --> 30:59.920
 astronomers that found it extrapolated back in time and found that in 1966, it intercepted the earth.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.960
 And then they realized they went to the history books and they realized, oh, there was a mission

31:04.960 --> 31:12.880
 called lunar surveyor, lunar lander, surveyor two that had a rocket booster. It was a failed mission,

31:12.880 --> 31:18.800
 but there was a rocket booster that was kicked into space. And presumably, this is the rocket

31:18.800 --> 31:24.800
 booster that we are seeing. Now, this rocket booster was sufficiently hollow and thin for us to

31:24.800 --> 31:31.200
 recognize that it's pushed by sunlight. So here is my point. We can tell from the orbit of an

31:31.200 --> 31:37.280
 object. Obviously, this object didn't have any cometary tail. It was artificially made. We know

31:37.280 --> 31:45.600
 that it was made by us and it did deviate from an orbit of a rock. So just by seeing something

31:45.600 --> 31:51.520
 that doesn't have cometary tail and deviates from an orbit shaped by gravity, we can tell that it's

31:51.520 --> 31:57.840
 artificial. In the case of a Muammua, it couldn't have been sent by humans because it just passed

31:57.840 --> 32:03.440
 near us for a few months. We know exactly what we were doing at that time. And also it was moving

32:03.440 --> 32:08.720
 faster than any object that we can launch. And so obviously it came from outside the solar system.

32:09.600 --> 32:16.320
 And the question is who produced it? Now, I should say that when I walk on vacation on a beach,

32:16.320 --> 32:24.000
 I often see natural objects like seashells that are beautiful and I look at them. And every now

32:24.000 --> 32:32.000
 and then I stumble on a plastic bottle that was artificially produced. And my point is that maybe

32:32.000 --> 32:40.240
 a Muammua was a message in a bottle. And this is simply another window into searching for artifacts

32:40.240 --> 32:50.400
 from other civilizations. Where do you think it could have come from? And from a scientific

32:50.400 --> 32:58.400
 perspective, the narrow minded view, as we'll probably talk about throughout, is you kind of

32:58.400 --> 33:05.280
 want to stick to the things that to naturally originating objects like asteroids and comets.

33:05.280 --> 33:09.120
 Okay, that's the space of possible hypotheses. And then if we expand beyond that,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
 you start to think, okay, these are artificially constructed. Like you just said, it could be by

33:14.000 --> 33:22.880
 humans. It could be by by whatever that means by some kind of extraterrestrial alien civilizations.

33:22.880 --> 33:31.920
 If it's the alien civilization variety, what is this object then? That's an excellent question.

33:31.920 --> 33:37.200
 An excellent question. And let me lay out, I mean, we don't have enough evidence to tell. If we had a

33:37.200 --> 33:43.440
 photograph, perhaps we would have more information. But there is one other peculiar fact about

33:43.440 --> 33:50.800
 a Muammua. Well, other than it was very shiny, that I didn't mention, you know, we didn't detect

33:50.800 --> 33:58.160
 any heat from it. And that implies that it's rather small and shiny. But the other peculiar fact is

33:58.160 --> 34:03.840
 that it was it came from a very special frame of reference. So it's sort of like finding a car

34:04.400 --> 34:10.560
 in a parking lot in a public parking lot that, you know, you can't really tell where it came from.

34:11.440 --> 34:16.640
 So there is this frame of reference where you average over the motions of all the stars in

34:16.640 --> 34:24.000
 the neighborhood of the sun. So you find the so called local standard of rest of the galaxy.

34:24.560 --> 34:31.520
 And that's a frame of reference that is obtained by averaging the random motions of all the stars.

34:31.520 --> 34:37.760
 And the sun is moving relative to that frame at some speed. But this object was at rest in that

34:37.760 --> 34:44.000
 frame. And only one in 500 stars is so much at rest in that frame. And that's why I was saying

34:44.000 --> 34:49.680
 it's like a parking lot. It was parked there and we bumped into it. So the relative speed between

34:49.680 --> 34:57.040
 the solar system and this object is just because we are moving. It was sitting still. Now you ask

34:57.040 --> 35:03.440
 yourself, why is it so unusual in that context? You know why? Because if it was expelled from

35:03.440 --> 35:10.400
 another planetary system, most likely it will carry the speed of the host star that it came from.

35:10.400 --> 35:16.080
 Because it was, you know, the most loosely bound objects are in the periphery of the planetary

35:16.080 --> 35:22.480
 system. And they move very slowly relative to the star. And so they carry the when they are ripped

35:22.480 --> 35:28.160
 apart from the planetary system, most of the objects will have the residual motion of the star,

35:28.160 --> 35:31.920
 roughly relative to the local star. But this one was at rest in the local. Now,

35:31.920 --> 35:39.840
 one thing I can think of if there is a grid of road posts, you know, like for navigation system,

35:40.400 --> 35:45.360
 so that you can find your way in the local frame, then that would be one possibility.

35:45.360 --> 35:50.000
 These are like little sensors. That's fascinating to think about. So there could be, I mean,

35:50.000 --> 35:56.640
 not necessarily literally a grid, but just evenly in some definition of evenly spread out

35:56.640 --> 36:02.720
 set of objects like these that are just out there. A lot of them. Another possibility is that these

36:02.720 --> 36:07.520
 are relay stations, you know, for communication, you might think in order to communicate, you need

36:07.520 --> 36:13.920
 a huge beacon, a very powerful beacon. But it's not true because even on Earth, you know, we have

36:13.920 --> 36:20.160
 these relay stations. So you have a not so powerful beacon. So it can be heard only out to a limited

36:20.160 --> 36:26.160
 distance. But then you relay the message. And it could be one of those. Now, after it collided

36:26.160 --> 36:31.360
 with the solar system, of course, it got a kick. So it's just like a billiard ball, you know, we

36:31.360 --> 36:36.720
 gave it a kick by colliding with, but most of them are not colliding with stars. And so that's one

36:36.720 --> 36:44.160
 possibility. Okay. And there should be numerous lots of them if that's the case. The other possibility

36:44.800 --> 36:54.080
 is that it's a probe, you know, that was sent in the direction of the habitable region around the

36:54.080 --> 36:59.520
 sun to find out if there is life. Now, it takes tens of thousands of years for such a probe to

36:59.520 --> 37:04.480
 traverse the solar system from the outer edge of the Earth cloud all the way to where we are.

37:05.520 --> 37:09.200
 And, you know, it's a long journey. So when it started the journey from the edge of the solar

37:09.200 --> 37:14.800
 system to get to us now, you know, we were rather primitive back then, you know, we still didn't

37:14.800 --> 37:19.520
 have any technology. There was no reason to visit, you know, there was grass around and so forth.

37:19.520 --> 37:25.520
 But, you know, maybe it is a probe. So you said 10,000 years as fast as so it takes that long

37:25.520 --> 37:31.360
 tens of thousands. Yes, tens of thousands a year. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing I should say is,

37:31.360 --> 37:38.160
 you know, it could be just an outer layer of something else, like, you know, something that

37:38.160 --> 37:45.120
 was ripped apart, like a surface of an instrument that was, and you can have lots of these pieces,

37:45.120 --> 37:50.320
 you know, if something breaks, lots of these pieces spread out like space junk. And, you know,

37:51.040 --> 37:59.680
 it could be just space junk from an alien civilization. Yes. So it's, I can tell you

37:59.680 --> 38:07.120
 about space junk. Let me, what do you mean by space junk? So I think, you know, you might ask,

38:07.120 --> 38:11.600
 why aren't they looking for us? One possibility is that we are not interesting, like we were talking

38:11.600 --> 38:17.760
 about another possibility, you know, if there are millions of billions of years

38:19.440 --> 38:26.800
 into their technological development, they created their own, their own habitat, their own cocoon,

38:26.800 --> 38:32.400
 where they feel comfortable, they have everything they need. And it's risky for them to establish

38:32.400 --> 38:38.960
 communication with other. So they have their own cocoon and they close off. They don't care about

38:38.960 --> 38:44.480
 anything else. Now, in that case, you might say, oh, so how can we find about them if they are closed

38:44.480 --> 38:51.040
 off? The answer is they still have to deposit trash, right? That's, that is something from the

38:51.040 --> 38:57.040
 law of thermodynamics. There must be some production of trash. And, you know, we can still find about

38:57.040 --> 39:03.920
 them just like investigative journalists going through the trash cans of celebrities in Hollywood,

39:03.920 --> 39:09.120
 you know, you can learn about the private lives of those celebrities by looking at the trash.

39:09.120 --> 39:14.720
 It's fascinating to think, you know, if, if we are the ants in this picture, if we, if this thing is

39:14.720 --> 39:22.080
 a water bottle, or if it's like a smartphone, like where, where on the spectrum of possible

39:22.080 --> 39:28.000
 objects of space, because there's a lot of interesting trash. So like, how interesting is

39:28.000 --> 39:34.480
 this trash? But imagine a caveman seeing a cell phone. The caveman would think, since the caveman

39:34.480 --> 39:39.680
 played with rocks all of his life, he would say, it's a rock, just like my fellow astronomers said.

39:39.680 --> 39:45.040
 Yes. Right. Exactly. That's brilliantly put. Actually, as a scientist, do you hope it's a water

39:45.040 --> 39:50.800
 bottle or a smartphone? Because I hope it's even more than a smartphone. I hope that it's something

39:50.800 --> 39:56.640
 that is really sophisticated and funny. See, I'm the opposite. I feel like I hope it's a water bottle,

39:56.640 --> 40:02.560
 because at least we have a hope with our current set of skills to understand it. Yeah, but caveman

40:02.560 --> 40:07.680
 has no way of understanding the smartphone. It's like, it will be like, I feel like a caveman has

40:07.680 --> 40:12.400
 more to learn from the plastic water bottle than it do from the smartphone. But suppose we figure

40:12.400 --> 40:17.840
 it out, if we, if we, for example, come close to it and, and, and learn what it's made of.

40:17.840 --> 40:22.640
 And I guess the smartphone is full of like thousands of different technologies that we could

40:22.640 --> 40:32.960
 probably pick at. Do you have a sense of where a hypothesis of where is the cocoon that it might

40:32.960 --> 40:40.880
 have come from? No, because there, okay. So first of all, you know, the solar system, the outermost

40:40.880 --> 40:50.240
 edge of the solar system is called the Oort cloud. It's a cloud of icy rocks of different sizes

40:50.240 --> 40:56.640
 that were left over from the formation of the solar system. And it's thought to be roughly

40:57.680 --> 41:04.080
 a ball or a sphere. And it's halfway, the extent of it is roughly halfway to the nearest star.

41:04.720 --> 41:15.040
 Okay. So you can imagine each planetary system basically touching the Oort clouds of those stars

41:15.040 --> 41:23.360
 that are near us are touching each other. Space is full of these billiard balls that are very densely

41:23.360 --> 41:29.440
 packed. And what that means is any object that you see irrespective of whether it came from the

41:29.440 --> 41:33.600
 local standard. So we said that this object is special because it came from a local standard

41:33.600 --> 41:38.400
 of rest. But even if it didn't, you would never be able to trace where it came from because

41:38.400 --> 41:45.280
 all these Oort clouds overlap. So if you take some direction in the sky, you will cross

41:46.320 --> 41:52.000
 as many stars as you have in that direction. Like there is no way to tell which Oort cloud it came

41:52.000 --> 41:57.120
 from. So yes, I didn't realize how densely packed everything was from the perspective of the Oort

41:57.120 --> 42:01.920
 cloud. And that's really interesting. So yeah, it could be nearby, it could be very far away.

42:01.920 --> 42:11.760
 Yeah, we have no clue. You said cocoon. And you kind of paint, I think in the book, I've

42:11.760 --> 42:15.600
 read a lot of your articles too on the Scientific American, which are brilliant. So I'm kind of

42:15.600 --> 42:22.080
 mixing things up in my head a little bit. But there's what does that cocoon look like? What

42:22.080 --> 42:26.560
 is the civilization that's able to harness the power of multiple suns, for example,

42:26.560 --> 42:33.440
 look like? When you imagine possible civilizations that are a million years more advanced than us,

42:34.000 --> 42:39.520
 what do you think that actually looks like? I think it's very different than we can imagine.

42:40.160 --> 42:46.960
 By the way, I should start from the point that even biological life, just without technology

42:46.960 --> 42:53.120
 getting into the game, could look like something we have never seen before. Take, for example,

42:53.120 --> 42:59.200
 the nearest star, which is Proxima Centauri. It's four and a quarter light years away. So they will

42:59.200 --> 43:08.160
 know about the results of the 2016 elections only next month in February 2021. It's very far away.

43:09.360 --> 43:19.680
 But if you think about it, you know, this star is a dwarf star. And it's much cooler than it's

43:19.680 --> 43:27.680
 twice as cold as the sun. And it emits mostly infrared radiation. So if there are any creatures

43:27.680 --> 43:34.960
 on the planet close to it that is habitable, which is called Proxima B, there is a planet

43:34.960 --> 43:39.520
 in the habitable zone, in the zone just at the right distance where in principle liquid water

43:39.520 --> 43:45.760
 can be on the surface. If there are any animals there, they have infrared eyes because our eyes

43:45.760 --> 43:52.240
 was designed to be sensitive to where most of the sunlight is in the visible range. But

43:52.800 --> 43:58.800
 Proxima Centauri emits mostly infrared. So you know, the nearest to see each other in the nearest star

43:58.800 --> 44:05.040
 system, these animals would be quite strange. They would have eyes that are detectors of

44:05.040 --> 44:11.200
 infrared very different from ours. Moreover, this planet Proxima B faces the star always with the

44:11.200 --> 44:17.600
 same side. So it has a permanent day side and a permanent night side. And obviously the creatures

44:17.600 --> 44:22.480
 that would evolve on the permanent day side, which is much warmer, would be quite different than

44:22.480 --> 44:29.280
 those on the permanent night side. Between them, there would be a permanent sunset strip. And my

44:29.280 --> 44:35.040
 daughters said that that's the best opportunity for high value real estate because you will see the

44:35.040 --> 44:44.160
 sunset throughout your life, right? The sun never sets on this strip. So you know, these worlds are

44:44.160 --> 44:50.000
 out of our imagination. Just even the individual creatures, the sensor suite that they're operating

44:50.000 --> 44:53.680
 with might be very different. Very different. So I think when we see something like that,

44:53.680 --> 44:59.920
 we would be shocked not to speak about seeing technology now. So I don't even dare to imagine,

44:59.920 --> 45:05.920
 you know? And I think, you know, obviously we can bury our head in the sand and say,

45:06.560 --> 45:12.560
 it's never aliens, like many of my colleagues say. And it's a self fulfilling prophecy. If you

45:12.560 --> 45:18.160
 never look, you will never find. If you are not ready to find wonderful things, you will never

45:18.160 --> 45:24.640
 discover them. And the other thing I would like to say is reality doesn't care whether you ignore

45:24.640 --> 45:31.440
 it or not. You can ignore reality, but it's still there. So we can all agree based on Twitter

45:32.560 --> 45:39.680
 that aliens don't exist. That was a rock. We can all agree. And you will get a lot of likes.

45:40.240 --> 45:45.040
 Have a big crowd of supporters and everyone will be happy and give each other awards and

45:45.040 --> 45:53.840
 honours and so forth. But might still be an alien artifact. Who cares what humans agree on.

45:53.840 --> 46:00.880
 There is a reality out there. And we have to be modest enough to recognize that we should make

46:00.880 --> 46:08.000
 our statements based on evidence. Science is not about ourselves. It's not about glorifying our

46:08.000 --> 46:13.600
 image. It's not about getting honours, prizes, you know, a lot of the scientific, a lot of the

46:13.600 --> 46:19.200
 academic activity is geared towards creating your echo chamber where you have students,

46:19.200 --> 46:24.640
 postdocs repeating your mantras so that your voice is heard loudly so that you can get more

46:24.640 --> 46:30.960
 honours, prizes, recognition. That's not the purpose of science. The purpose is to figure out

46:30.960 --> 46:36.960
 what nature is, right? And in the process of doing that, it's a learning experience. You make mistakes.

46:36.960 --> 46:43.120
 You know, Einstein made three mistakes at the end of his career. He argued that in the 1930s,

46:43.120 --> 46:49.360
 he argued that black holes don't exist, gravitational waves don't exist, and quantum

46:49.360 --> 46:56.000
 mechanics doesn't have spooky action at a distance. And all three turned out to be wrong.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.600
 Okay. So the point is that if you work at the frontier, then you make mistakes. It's inevitable

47:01.600 --> 47:06.800
 because you can tell what is true or not. And avoiding making mistakes in order to preserve

47:06.800 --> 47:13.520
 your image makes you extremely boring. Okay. You will get a prize, but you will be a boring

47:13.520 --> 47:18.480
 scientist because you will keep repeating things we already know. If you want to make progress,

47:18.480 --> 47:23.840
 if you want to innovate, you have to take risks and you have to look at the evidence.

47:23.840 --> 47:30.240
 It's a dialogue with nature. You don't know the truth in advance. You let nature tell you, educate

47:30.240 --> 47:37.520
 you. And then you realize that what you thought before is incorrect. And a lot of my colleagues

47:38.240 --> 47:42.240
 prefer to be in a state where they have a monologue. You know, if you look at these people that work

47:42.240 --> 47:48.960
 on string theory, they have a monologue. They know what, and in fact, their monologue is centered on

47:48.960 --> 47:54.400
 anti the sitter space, which we don't live in. Now, you know, it's to me, it's just like the

47:54.400 --> 48:00.160
 Olympics, you know, you define a hundred meters, and you say whoever runs this hundred meters is the

48:00.160 --> 48:05.280
 best athlete, the fastest, you know, and it's completely arbitrary. You could have decided

48:05.280 --> 48:11.200
 it would be 50 meters or 20 meters. Who cares? You just measure the ability of people this way.

48:11.200 --> 48:15.920
 So you define anti the sitter space as a space where you do your mathematical gymnastics,

48:16.480 --> 48:20.480
 and then you find who can do it the best, and you give jobs based on that, you give prizes.

48:20.480 --> 48:26.400
 But as we said before, you know, nature doesn't care about, you know, the prizes that you give

48:27.120 --> 48:33.200
 to each other. It cares, you know, it has its own reality, and we should figure it out. And

48:33.200 --> 48:38.880
 it's not about us. The scientific activity is about figuring out nature. And sometimes we may be

48:38.880 --> 48:47.920
 wrong. Our image will not be preserved. But it's that's the fun, you know, kids explore the world

48:47.920 --> 48:53.520
 out of curiosity. And I always want to maintain my childhood curiosity. And I don't care about

48:53.520 --> 49:00.480
 the labels that I have. In fact, having tenure is exactly the opportunity to behave like a child,

49:00.480 --> 49:07.200
 because you can make mistakes. And I was asked by the Harvard Gazette, you know, the Pravda

49:07.200 --> 49:14.000
 of Harvard, what is the one thing that you would like to change about the world?

49:14.000 --> 49:20.640
 Yes. And I said, I would like my colleagues to behave more like kids. Yeah, that's the one thing

49:20.640 --> 49:26.400
 I would like them to do. Because something bad happens to these kids when they become

49:26.400 --> 49:32.400
 tenured professors, they start to worry about their ego, and about themselves more than about

49:32.400 --> 49:37.120
 the purpose of science, which is, you know, curiosity driven, figuring out from evidence.

49:37.120 --> 49:43.360
 Evidence is the key. So when an object shows anomalies, like, what's the problem discussing,

49:43.360 --> 49:47.360
 you know, whether it's artificial or not, you know, so there was, I should tell you,

49:47.360 --> 49:54.000
 there was a mainstream paper in nature, published saying, it must be natural. That's it.

49:54.880 --> 49:59.440
 It's unusual, but it must be natural. Period. And then at the same time,

50:00.400 --> 50:05.680
 that those means some other mainstream scientists tried to explain the properties.

50:05.680 --> 50:10.560
 Yes. And they came up with interpretations like, it's a dust bunny, you know, the kind

50:10.560 --> 50:14.720
 that you find in a household, a collection of dust particles pushed by sunlight,

50:16.240 --> 50:21.920
 something we have never seen before. Or it's a hydrogen iceberg. It actually evaporates like a

50:21.920 --> 50:26.560
 comet, but hydrogen is transparent. You don't see it. And that's why we don't see the cometary

50:26.560 --> 50:31.040
 tail. Again, we have never seen something like that. In both cases, the objects would not

50:31.760 --> 50:37.920
 survive the long journey. We discussed it in a paper that I wrote afterwards. But my point is,

50:37.920 --> 50:44.800
 those that tried to explain the unusual properties went into great length at discussing things that

50:44.800 --> 50:50.400
 we have never seen before. Okay. So even when you think about the natural origin, you have to come

50:50.400 --> 50:57.120
 up with scenarios of things that were never seen before. And by the way, they look less plausible

50:57.120 --> 51:02.960
 to me personally. But my point is, if we discuss things that were never seen before, right,

51:02.960 --> 51:09.200
 why not discuss, why not contemplate an artificial origin? What's the problem? Why do people have

51:09.760 --> 51:17.200
 this pushback? You know, I worked on dark matter. And we don't know what most of the matter in the

51:17.200 --> 51:23.280
 universe is. It's called dark matter. It's just an acronym, because we have no clue. We simply

51:23.280 --> 51:27.680
 don't know. So it could be all kinds of particles. And over the years, people suggested weekly

51:27.680 --> 51:33.760
 interacting massive particles, axions, all kinds of particles. And experiments were made. They

51:33.760 --> 51:40.080
 cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They put upper limits, constraints that ruled out many

51:40.080 --> 51:45.840
 of the possibilities that were proposed as natural initially. The mainstream community regarded it

51:45.840 --> 51:52.080
 as a mainstream activity to search the nature of the dark matter. And they nobody complained that

51:52.080 --> 51:58.160
 it's speculative to consider weekly interacting massive particles. Now, I ask you, why is it

51:58.160 --> 52:05.280
 speculative to consider extraterrestrial technologies? We have a proof that it exists here

52:05.280 --> 52:12.960
 on Earth. We also know that the conditions of Earth are reproduced in billions of systems

52:12.960 --> 52:18.160
 throughout the Milky Way galaxy. So what's more conservative than to say, if you arrange for

52:18.160 --> 52:23.600
 similar conditions, you get the same outcome. How can you imagine this to be speculative? It's not

52:23.600 --> 52:28.640
 speculative at all. And nevertheless, it's regarded the periphery. And at the same time, you have

52:28.640 --> 52:35.920
 physicists, theoretical physicists working on extra dimensions, supersymmetry, super string theory,

52:35.920 --> 52:42.480
 the multiverse, maybe we live in a simulation, all of these ideas that have no grounding in reality,

52:42.480 --> 52:49.600
 some of which sound to me like, you know, just like what someone would say, science fiction,

52:49.600 --> 52:56.720
 basically, because you have no way to test it, you know, through experiments and experiments really

52:56.720 --> 53:01.440
 are key. It's not just the nuance. You say, okay, I forget about experiments, as some philosophers

53:01.440 --> 53:06.560
 try to say, you know, if there is a consensus, what's the problem? The point is, it's key,

53:06.560 --> 53:11.680
 then that's what Galileo, it's key to have feedback from reality. You know, you can think that you

53:11.680 --> 53:18.320
 have a billion dollars or that you are more rich than, you know, Elon Musk, that's fine. You can

53:19.040 --> 53:23.600
 feel very happy about it. You can talk about it with your friends and all of you will be happy

53:23.600 --> 53:27.920
 and think about what you can do with the money. Then you go to an ATM machine and you make an

53:27.920 --> 53:33.440
 experiment, you check how much money you have in your checking account. And if it turns out that,

53:34.080 --> 53:40.800
 you know, you don't have much, you can't materialize your dreams. Okay, so you realize you have a

53:40.800 --> 53:46.080
 reality check. And my point is, without experiments giving you a reality check, without the ATM

53:46.080 --> 53:52.400
 machine showing you whether your ideas are bankrupt or not, without putting skin in the game. And by

53:52.400 --> 53:58.720
 skin in the game, I mean, don't just talk about theoretical ideas, make them testable. If you

53:58.720 --> 54:04.160
 don't make them testable, they're worthless. They're just like theology that is not testable.

54:04.160 --> 54:10.800
 By the way, theology has some tests. Let me give you three examples. Yes.

54:12.480 --> 54:18.320
 It turns out that my book already inspired a PhD student at Harvard in the English department

54:19.040 --> 54:26.240
 to pursue a PhD in that direction. And she invited me to the PhD exam a couple of months ago.

54:26.240 --> 54:36.080
 And in the exam, one of the examiners, a professor asked her, do you know why Giordano Bruno was

54:36.080 --> 54:42.800
 burnt at the stake? And she said, I think it's because he was an obnoxious guy and

54:42.800 --> 54:51.520
 they irritated a lot of people, which is true. But the professor said, no, it's because Giordano

54:51.520 --> 54:58.960
 Bruno said that other stars are just like the sun and they could have a planet like the earth

54:58.960 --> 55:06.640
 around them that could host life. And that was offensive to the church. Why was it offensive?

55:07.200 --> 55:14.400
 Because there is the possibility that this life sinned. Okay. And if that life sinned

55:14.400 --> 55:20.560
 on planets around other stars, it should have been saved by Christ. And then you need multiple

55:20.560 --> 55:28.000
 copies of Christ. And that's unacceptable. How can you have duplicates of Christ? And so they burned

55:28.000 --> 55:35.600
 the guy. It was about, okay, I'm just like loading this all in, because that's kind of brilliant.

55:35.600 --> 55:39.600
 So he was actually already into this, it's not just about the stars, it's anticipating that there

55:39.600 --> 55:46.080
 could be other life forms. Like why if this star, if there's other stars, why would it be special?

55:46.080 --> 55:51.040
 Why would our star be special? He was making the right arguments. And he would just follow that

55:51.040 --> 55:56.240
 all along to say like there should be other earth like places, there should be other life forms.

55:56.240 --> 56:02.000
 And then that was offense copies of Christ. Yes. So that was offensive. So I said, I said to that,

56:03.040 --> 56:07.840
 I said to that professor, I said, great, you know, I wanted to introduce some scientific tone to the

56:07.840 --> 56:13.680
 discussion. And I said, this is great, because now you basically laid the foundation for an

56:13.680 --> 56:20.000
 experimental test of this theology. What is the test? We now know that other stars are like the sun.

56:20.720 --> 56:25.520
 And we know they have planets like the earth around them. So suppose we find life there,

56:25.520 --> 56:34.000
 and we figure out that they sinned, then we ask them, did you witness Christ? And if they say no,

56:34.000 --> 56:39.680
 it means that this theology is ruled out. So there is an experimental test. So this is

56:39.680 --> 56:47.120
 experimental test number one. Another experimental test, you know, in the Bible, you know, in the

56:47.120 --> 56:59.040
 Old Testament, Abraham was heard the voice, the voice of God to sacrifice his son, right? Only son.

56:59.040 --> 57:08.720
 And that's what the story says. Now suppose Abraham, my name, by the way, had a voice memo up on his

57:08.720 --> 57:14.400
 cell phone. He could have pressed this up and recorded the voice of God. And that would have

57:14.400 --> 57:21.520
 been experimental evidence that God exists, right? Fortunately, he didn't. But it's an experimental

57:21.520 --> 57:28.800
 test, right? There is a third example I should tell. And that is Elie Wiesel attributed this story

57:28.800 --> 57:34.160
 to Martin Buber. But it's not clear whether it's true or not. At any event, the story goes that

57:34.160 --> 57:41.920
 Martin Buber, you know, he was a philosopher and he said, you know, the Christians argue that Jesus,

57:41.920 --> 57:49.600
 you know, the Messiah arrived already and will come back again in the future. The Jews argue

57:50.240 --> 57:58.320
 the Messiah never came and will arrive in the future. So he said, why argue? Both sides agree

57:58.320 --> 58:06.240
 that the Messiah will arrive in the future. When the Messiah arrives, we can ask whether he or she

58:07.600 --> 58:12.880
 came before, you know, like visited us and then figure it out. And one side, so again,

58:12.880 --> 58:20.080
 experimental test of a theology. So even theology, if it puts a skin in the game, you know, if it

58:20.080 --> 58:26.560
 makes a prediction, could be tested, right? So why can't string theories test themselves? Or why can't,

58:26.560 --> 58:31.120
 you know, even cosmic inflation, that's another model that, you know, one of the inventors from

58:31.120 --> 58:39.360
 MIT, Alan Guth argues that it's not falsifiable. My point is, a theory that cannot be falsified

58:39.360 --> 58:44.720
 is not helpful, because it means that you can't make progress. You cannot improve your understanding

58:44.720 --> 58:51.280
 of nature. The only way for us to learn about nature is by making hypotheses that are testable,

58:51.280 --> 58:57.280
 doing the experiments and learning whether we are correct or not. So be and coupled that with

58:57.280 --> 59:02.560
 a curiosity and open mindedness that allows us to explore all kinds of possible hypotheses,

59:03.120 --> 59:10.480
 but always the pursuit of those, the scientific rigor around those hypotheses is ultimately

59:11.360 --> 59:18.320
 get evidence. Knowledge is, of what nature is, should be a dialogue with nature. Yes.

59:18.320 --> 59:23.040
 Rather than a monologue. Monologue, beautifully put. Can we talk a little bit about the Drake

59:23.040 --> 59:29.200
 equation, another framework from which to have this kind of discussion about possible civilizations

59:29.200 --> 59:35.440
 out there? So let me ask, within the context of the Drake equation, or maybe bigger, how many

59:35.440 --> 59:40.240
 alien civilizations do you think are out there? Well, it's hard to tell, because the Drake equation

59:40.240 --> 59:47.280
 is again quantifying our ignorance. It's just a set of factors. The only one that we know,

59:47.280 --> 59:52.960
 or actually two that we know quite well is the rate of star formation in the Milky Way Galaxy,

59:52.960 --> 59:59.440
 which we measured by now, and the frequency of planets like the Earth around stars,

1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:05.920
 and at the right distance to have life. But other than that, there are lots of implicit

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:10.160
 assumptions about all the other factors that will enable us to detect a signal.

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:17.520
 Now, I should say that Drake equation has a very limited validity just for signals from civilizations

1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:24.160
 that are transmitting at the time that you're observing them. However, we can do much better

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:31.600
 than that. We can look for artifacts that they left behind. Even if they're dead, you can look for

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:37.920
 industrial pollution in the atmosphere of planets. Why do I bring this up? Again, to show you the

1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:43.760
 conservatism of the mainstream in astronomy. By the way, I have leadership positions. I was

1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:47.200
 chair of the Astronomy Department for nine years, the longest serving chair at Harvard.

1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:53.280
 I'm the chair of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies. It's a

1:00:53.280 --> 1:01:03.520
 primary board. I'm director of two centers at Harvard and so forth. I do represent the community

1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:08.720
 in various ways. But at the same time, I'm a little bit disappointed by the conservatism that

1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:15.280
 people have. Let me give you an illustration of that. The astronomy community actually is going

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:22.320
 right now through the process of defining its goals for the next decade. There are proposals for

1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:30.720
 telescopes that would cost billions of dollars and whose goal is to find evidence for oxygen

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:37.680
 in the atmosphere of planets around other stars. With the idea that this would be a marker, a

1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:45.360
 signature of life. Now, the problem with that is Earth didn't have much oxygen in its atmosphere

1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:51.600
 for the first two billion years. Roughly half of its life. It didn't have much oxygen, but it had

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:59.760
 life. It had microbial life. It's not clear yet as of yet what the origin is for the rise in the

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:08.880
 oxygen level after two billion years, about 2.4 billion years ago. But we know that a planet

1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:13.840
 can have life without oxygen in the atmosphere because Earth did it. The second problem with this

1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:21.440
 approach is that you can have oxygen from natural processes. You can break water molecules and make

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:28.640
 oxygen. So even if you find it, it will never tell you that for sure life exists there. And so even

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:35.600
 with these billions of dollars, the mainstream community will never be confident whether there

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:40.560
 is life there. Now, how can it be confident? There is actually a way. If instead of looking with

1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:46.800
 the same instruments, if you look for molecules that indicate industrial pollution, for example,

1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:53.280
 CFCs that are produced by refrigerating systems or industries here on Earth that they do the

1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:58.400
 ozone layer, you can search for that. And I wrote a paper five years ago suggesting that.

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:06.000
 Now, what's the problem? You can just tell NASA, I want to build this telescope to search for oxygen

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.440
 but also for industrial pollution. Nobody would say that because it sounds like

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.520
 on the periphery of the field. And I ask you, why would... It's hilarious because that's exactly...

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:27.680
 That would be saying is quite brilliant because it's a really strong signal. And if life, if there's

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:32.880
 alien civilizations out there, then there are probably going to be many of them. And they're

1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:36.800
 probably going to be more advanced than us. And they're probably going to have something like

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:42.560
 industrial pollution, which would be a much stronger signal than some basic gas, which could

1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:51.280
 have a lot of different explanations. So like oxygen or... We could talk about signs of life

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:57.760
 on Venus and so on. But if you want a strong signal, it'll be pollution. I love how garbage is...

1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.840
 No, but the pollution, you have to understand, we think of pollution as a problem. But on a planet

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:11.440
 that was too cold, for example, to have comfortable life on it, you can imagine terraforming it and

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:18.960
 putting a blanket of polluting gases such that it will be warmer. And that would be a positive change.

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:27.520
 So if an industrial or a technological civilization wants to terraform a planet that otherwise is

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:34.000
 too cold for them, they will do it. So what's the problem of defining it as a search goal

1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:41.760
 using the same technologies? The problem is that there is a taboo. We're not supposed to discuss

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.560
 extraterrestrial intelligence. There is no funding for this subject, not much, very little.

1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:54.000
 And young people, because of the bullying on Twitter, all the social media and elsewhere,

1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:00.240
 young people with talent that are curious about these questions do not enter this field of study.

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:07.360
 And obviously, if you step on the grass, it will never grow. So if you don't give funding,

1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:12.480
 obviously, the mainstream community says, look, nothing was discovered so far. Obviously,

1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:18.560
 nothing would be discovered. If talented people go to other disciplines, you never search for it

1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:23.600
 well enough, you will never find anything. I mean, look at gravitational wave astrophysics.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:29.840
 It's a completely new window into the universe, pioneered by Ray Weiss at MIT. And at first,

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:36.560
 it was ridiculed. And thanks to some administrators at the National Science Foundation, it received

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:43.600
 funding despite the fact that the mainstream of the astronomy community was very resistant to it.

1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:48.640
 And now it's considered a frontier. So all these people that I remember as a postdoc,

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:52.640
 a young postdoc, these people that bashed these fields, said bad things about people,

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:59.120
 said nothing will come out of it. Now they say, oh, yeah, of course. The Nobel Prize was given

1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:08.000
 to the LIGO collaboration. Of course, now they are supportive of it. But my point is,

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:14.800
 if you suppress innovation early on, there are lots of missed opportunities.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:23.760
 The discovery of exoplanets is one example. In 1952, there was an astronomer named Otto

1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:31.440
 Struve. And he wrote a paper saying, why don't we search for Jupiter, like planets,

1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:36.480
 close to their host star? Because if they're close enough, they would move the star back

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:43.440
 and forth and we can detect the signal. And so astronomers on time allocation committees of

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:52.320
 telescopes for 40 years argued, this is not possible, because we know why Jupiter resides

1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:57.200
 so far from the sun. You cannot have Jupiter so close, because there is this region where ice

1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:02.560
 forms far from the sun. And beyond that region is where Jupiter, like planets, can form. There

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:08.000
 was a theory behind it, which ended up being wrong by today's standards. But anyway,

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:14.800
 they did not give time on telescopes to search for such systems until the first system was discovered

1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:19.360
 four decades after Otto Struve's paper. And the Nobel Prize was awarded to that

1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:26.480
 just a couple of years ago. And you ask yourself, okay, so science still made progress. What's the

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:34.560
 problem? The problem is that this baby came out barely and there was a delay of four decades. So

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:40.000
 the progress was delayed. And I wonder how many babies were not born because of this resistance.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:45.040
 So there must be ideas that are as good as this one that were suppressed because they were bullied

1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:52.560
 because people ridiculed them that were actually good ideas. And these are missed opportunities,

1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:59.680
 babies that were never born. And I'm willing to push this frontier of the search for technologies

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:05.280
 or technological signatures for the civilization. Because when I was young, I was in the military

1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:12.560
 in Israel, it's obligatory to serve. And there was this saying that one of the soldiers sometimes

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:20.080
 has to put his body on the barbed wire so that others can go through. And I'm willing to suffer

1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:27.040
 the pain so that younger people in the future will be able to speak freely about the possibility that

1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:31.600
 some of the anomalies we find in the sky are due to technological signatures.

1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:37.440
 And it's quite obvious. This is why folks in the artificial intelligence space, Elon Musk and a

1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:43.280
 few others speak about this. And they look at the long arc, they say like, what, you know,

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.280
 this kind of, you know, you can call it like first principles thinking or you can call anything

1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:53.760
 really is like, if we just zoom out from our current bickering and our current

1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:59.520
 like discussions and what science is doing, look at the long arc of the trajectory we're

1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:08.080
 headed at, which questions are obviously fundamental to science and that should be asked. And which

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:12.880
 is the space of hypothesis we should be exploring. And like exoplanets is a really good example of

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:19.040
 one that was like an obvious one. I recently talked to Sarah Seeger and it was very taboo when she

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:26.160
 was starting out to work on an exoplanet and that was even in the 90s. And like it's obvious

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:31.760
 should not be a taboo subject. And to me, I mean, I'm probably ignorant, but to me exoplanets seems

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:37.760
 like it's ridiculous that that would ever be a taboo subject to not fund, to not explore.

1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:46.800
 That's very, but even for her, it's now taboo to say like what, you know, to look for industrial

1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:53.440
 pollution, right? Right. I find that ridiculous. I'll tell you why. It's ridiculous for another

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:58.720
 reason, not because of just the scientific benefits that we might have by exploring it,

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:05.920
 but because the public cares about these questions and the public funds science. So how dare the

1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:13.680
 scientists shy away from addressing these questions if they have the technology to do it? It's like

1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:17.520
 saying, I don't want to look through Galileo's telescope. It's exactly the same. You have the

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:23.280
 technology to explore this question, to find evidence and you shy away from it. You might

1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:28.320
 ask why do people shy away from it? And perhaps it's because of the fact that there is science

1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:34.160
 fiction. I'm not a fan of science fiction because it has an element to it that violates the laws

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:40.240
 of physics in many of the books and the film. And I cannot enjoy these things when I see the

1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:45.760
 laws of physics violated. But who cares that the fact that there is science fiction? I mean,

1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:51.280
 if you have the scientific methodology to address the same subject, I don't care that

1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:57.520
 other people spoke nonsense about this subject or said things that make no sense. Who cares?

1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:03.360
 You do your scientific work just like you explore the dark matter. You explore the possibility that

1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:13.760
 is an artifact. You just look for evidence and try to deduce what it means. And I have no problem

1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:18.160
 with doing that. To me, it sounds like any other scientific question that we have. And given the

1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:24.240
 public's interest, we have an obligation to do that. By the way, science, to me, is not an

1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:29.280
 occupation of the elite. It doesn't allow me to feel superior to other humans that are unable to

1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:35.760
 understand the math. To me, it's a way of life. If there is a problem in the faucet or in the pipe

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:42.400
 at home, I try to figure out what the problem is. And with a plumber, we figure it out and we

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:47.600
 look at the clues. And the same thing in science. You look at the evidence, you try to figure out

1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:55.280
 what it means. It's common sense, in a way. And it shouldn't be regarded as something removed

1:11:55.280 --> 1:12:00.320
 from the public. It should be a reflection of the public's interest. And I think it's actually a

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:06.320
 crime to resist the public. If the public says, I care about this. And you say, no, no, no, that's

1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.720
 not sophisticated enough for me. I want to do intellectual gymnastics on anti the sitter

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:19.280
 space. To me, that's a crime. Yes. I 100% agree. So it's hilarious that the very, not hilarious,

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:27.280
 it's sad that people who are trained in the scientific community to have the tools to explore

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:32.480
 this world, to be children, to be the most effective at being children are the ones that

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:41.280
 resist being children the most. But there is a large number of people that embrace the childlike

1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:47.120
 wonder about the world and may not necessarily have the tools to do it. That's the more general

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:56.080
 public. And so, I wonder if I could ask you and talk to you a little bit about UFO sightings,

1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:03.120
 that there's people, quote unquote, believers, there's hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings.

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:14.640
 And I've consumed some of the things that people have said about it. And one thing I really like

1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:23.840
 about it is how excited they are by the possibility, by it's almost like this childlike wonder about

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:30.320
 the world out there. It's not a fear, it's an excitement. Do you think, because we're talking

1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:38.320
 about this possibly extraterrestrial object that visited, that flew by Earth, do you think it's

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:48.240
 possible that out of those hundreds of thousands of UFO sightings, one is an actual one or some

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:54.400
 number is an actual sighting of a nonhuman to some alien technology? And that we're not,

1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:07.280
 we're too close minded to look and to see. I think to answer this question, we need better

1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:14.480
 evidence. My starting point, as I said, out of modesty is that we are not particularly interesting.

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:20.000
 And therefore, I would agree, I would be hard pressed to imagine that someone wants to really

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:27.040
 spy on us. So I would think, you know, as a starting point that we don't deserve attention,

1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:33.600
 and we shouldn't expect someone, but who knows. Now, the problem that I have with UFO sighting

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:39.120
 reports is that, you know, 50 years ago, there were some reports of fuzzy images, you know,

1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:47.280
 saucer like things. By now, our technologies are much better, our cameras are much more sensitive.

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:55.280
 These fuzzy images should have turned into crisp, clear images of things that we are confident about.

1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:00.960
 And they haven't turned that way. It's always on the borderline of believability. And because of

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:06.000
 that, I believe that it might be most likely artifacts of our instruments, or some natural

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:12.000
 phenomena that we are unable to understand. Now, of course, the reason you need, you must examine

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:19.840
 those. If, for example, pilots report about them, or the military finds evidence for them,

1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.280
 is because it may pose a national security threat. If another country has technologies that we don't

1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:30.240
 know about, and they're spying on us, we need to know about it. And therefore, we should examine

1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:38.160
 everything that looks unusual. But to associate it with an alien life is a little too far for me

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:45.600
 until we have evidence that stands up to the level of scientific credence, you know, that

1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:53.120
 we are 100% sure that, you know, from multiple detectors and, you know, through a scientific

1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:58.720
 process. Now, again, if the scientific community shies away from these reports, we will never have

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:04.160
 that. It's like saying, I don't want to take photographs of something because I know what it

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:10.480
 is, then you will never know what it is. But I think if some scientists, if grants, let's put it

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:17.840
 this way, if funding will be given to scientists to follow on some of these reports and use scientific

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:24.240
 instruments that are capable of detecting those sightings with much better resolution, with much

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.960
 better information, that would be great because it will clarify the matter. You know, these are not,

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:34.160
 as you said, you know, hundreds of thousands, these are not the ones in the lifetime events.

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.800
 So it's possible to take scientific instrumentation and explore, go to the ocean where the,

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:47.360
 you know, someone reported that there are frequent events that are unusual and check it out, do a

1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:51.920
 scientific experiment. What's the problem? Why not? Why only do experiments deep into the ocean and

1:16:51.920 --> 1:16:58.720
 look at the oceanography or do other things? You know, we can do scientific investigation of these

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:05.600
 sightings and figure out what they mean. I'm very much in favor of that. But until we have the

1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:10.400
 evidence, I would be doubtful as to what they actually mean. Yeah, we'll have to be humble

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:16.240
 and acknowledge that we're not that interesting. It's kind of, you're making me realize that

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:22.160
 because it's so taboo that the people that have the equipment, meaning, and we're not just talking,

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:31.360
 everybody has cameras now, but to have a large scale like sensor network that collects data,

1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:35.200
 that regularly collects, just like we look at the weather, we're collecting information,

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:40.320
 and then we can then access that information when there is reports and like have it not be a taboo

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:46.640
 thing where there's like millions or billions of dollars funding this effort, that by the way,

1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:53.360
 inspires millions of people. This is exactly what you're talking about. It's like the scientific

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:59.200
 community is afraid of a topic that inspires millions of people. It's absurd. But if you put

1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:06.080
 blinders on your eyes, you don't see it. Yeah, right. I should say that we do have meteors that

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:13.360
 we see. These are rocks that by chance happen to collide with the Earth. And if they're small,

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.600
 they burn up in the atmosphere. But if they're big enough, tens of meters or more, hundreds of

1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:28.000
 meters, the outer layer burns up, but then the core of the object makes it through. And this is our

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:34.480
 chance of putting our hands around an object if this meteor came from interstellar space. So

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:42.400
 one path of discovery is to search for interstellar meteors. And with the student of mine, we actually

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:47.840
 looked through the record and we thought that we found one example of a meteor that was reported

1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:55.040
 that might have come from interstellar space. And another approach is, for example, to look at the

1:18:55.040 --> 1:19:00.800
 moon. The moon is different from the Earth in the sense that it doesn't have an atmosphere. So objects

1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:06.880
 do not burn up on their way to it. It's sort of like a museum. It collects everything that comes

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:11.760
 of rocks from out there. Yeah, deep space. Yeah. And there is no geological activity on the moon.

1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:17.360
 So on Earth, every 100 million years, you know, we could have had computer terminals on Earth that

1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:23.200
 could have been a civilization like ours with electronic equipment more than 100 million years

1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:29.920
 ago. And it's completely lost. You cannot excavate and find it evidence for it because in archaeological

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:36.240
 digs, because the Earth is being mixed on these time scales. And everything that was on the surface

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:40.800
 more than 100 million years ago is buried deep inside the Earth right now because of geological

1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:45.600
 activity. Fascinating to think about, by the way. Yeah. But on the moon, this doesn't happen. The only

1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:51.600
 thing that happens on the moon is you have objects impacting the moon and they go 10 meters deep,

1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:56.400
 so they produce some dust. But the moon keeps everything. It's like a museum. It keeps everything

1:19:56.400 --> 1:20:03.760
 on the surface. So if we go to the moon, I would highly recommend regarding it as an archaeological

1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:09.920
 site and looking for objects that are strange. Maybe it collected some trash, you know, from

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:15.760
 interstellar space. If we could just link it on the Drake equation for a little bit. We kind of

1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:22.640
 talked about there's a lot of uncertainty in the parameters and the Drake equation itself is very

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:29.120
 limited. But I think the parameters are interesting in themselves, even if it's limited, because I

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:34.400
 think each one is within the reach of science, right? Did you get the evidence for it? I mean,

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:41.200
 a few I find really interesting. It's interesting to get your comment on. So the one with the most

1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:47.920
 variants, I would say from my perspective, is the length that civilizations last. However you

1:20:47.920 --> 1:20:53.520
 define it. In the Drake equation, it's the length of how long you're communicating, just like transmitting.

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:59.120
 Just like you said, that's a wrong way to think about it, because we can be detecting

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:04.240
 some other outputs of the civilizations, etc. But just if we just define broadly how long those

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:12.160
 civilizations last, do you have a sense of how long that might last? Like what are the great

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:19.840
 filters that might destroy civilizations that we should be thinking about? How can science

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:25.760
 give us more hints on this topic? So I, as I mentioned before, operate by the Copernican

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:32.800
 principle, meaning that we are not special. We don't live in a special place and not in a special

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:39.200
 time. And by the way, it's just modesty and encapsulated in scientific terms, right? You're

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:45.120
 saying I'm not special, you know, I find conditions here, they exist everywhere. So if you adapt the

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:53.280
 Copernican principle, you basically say our civilization transmitted radio signals for 100

1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:59.440
 years, roughly. So probably it would last another 100 or a few hundred and that's it,

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:07.360
 because we don't live at a special time. So that's, you know, well, of course, if we get our act

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:14.640
 together, and we somehow start to cooperate rather than fighting each other, killing each other,

1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:19.600
 you know, wasting a lot of resources on things that would destroy our planet,

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:28.480
 maybe we can lengthen that period if we get smarter. But the most natural assumption is to

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:34.400
 say that we will live into the future as much as we lived from the time that we start to develop

1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:39.680
 the means for our own destruction, the technologies we have, which is quite pessimistic, I must say.

1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:44.880
 So several centuries, that's what I would give, not unless we get our act, unless we become more

1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:51.920
 intelligent than the newspapers report every day. Okay, point number one. Second, and by the way,

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:58.480
 this is relevant, I should say, because there was a report about perhaps a radio signal detected

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:03.520
 from Proxima Centauri. What do you make of that signal? Oh, I think it's some Australian guy with

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:09.120
 a cell phone next to the observatory or something like that, because it was the park's telescope

1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:17.120
 in Australia. Okay. So it's human created noise. Yeah, which is always the worry, because actually

1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:22.480
 the same observatory, the park's observatory detected a couple of years ago some signal,

1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:29.760
 and then they realized that it comes back at lunch lunchtime. Yes. And they said, okay,

1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:33.920
 what could it be? And then they figured out that it must be the microwave oven in the observatory,

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:40.080
 because someone was opening it before it finished, and it was creating this radio signal that they

1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:48.080
 detected with a telescope every lunchtime. So just a cautionary remark. But the reason I think

1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:54.720
 it's human made, without getting to the technical details, is because of this very short window by

1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:59.120
 which we were transmitting radio signals out of the lifetime of the earth. You know, as I said,

1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:05.040
 100 years out of four and a half billion years that the earth existed. So what's the chance that

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:10.720
 another civilization, a twin civilization of ours, is transmitting radio signals exactly at

1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:17.440
 the time that we are looking with our radio telescopes, 10 to the minus seven, you know.

1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:25.840
 So, and the other argument I have that is that they detected it in a very narrow band of frequencies,

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:31.760
 and that makes it, you know, it cannot be through natural processes, a very narrow band,

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:40.560
 just like some radio transmissions that we produce. But if it were to come from the habitable zone,

1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:46.240
 from a transmitter on the surface of Proxima B, this is the planet that orbits Proxima Centauri,

1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.920
 then I calculated that the frequency would drift through the Doppler effect, you know,

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:57.360
 just like when you hear a siren on the street, you know, when the car approaches you,

1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:02.400
 it has a different pitch than when it goes, recedes away from you. That's the Doppler effect.

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:10.480
 And when the planet orbits the star, Proxima Centauri, you would see or detect a different

1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:15.600
 frequency when the planet approaches us as compared to when it recedes. So there should be a frequency

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:23.760
 drift just because of the motion of the planet. And I calculated that it must be much bigger than

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:30.480
 observed. So it cannot just be a transmitter sitting on the planet and sending in our direction,

1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:37.280
 a radio signal, unless they want to cancel the Doppler effect, but then they need to know about

1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:41.040
 us, because in a different direction, it will not be canceled. Only in our direction, they can

1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:49.600
 cancel it perfectly. So there is this direction of Proxima Centauri, but I have a problem imagining

1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:56.800
 a transmitter on the surface of a planet in the habitable zone emitting it. But my main issue

1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:00.960
 is really with a likelihood, given what we know about ourself.

1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:03.840
 Right. In terms of the duration of the civilization.

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:05.200
 The Copernican principle, yeah.

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.680
 So nevertheless, this particular signal is likely to be a human interference, perhaps, but

1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:19.920
 do you find Proxima be interesting? Or the more general question is, do you think we humans

1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:30.240
 will venture out into outside our solar system and potentially colonize other habitable planets?

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:34.880
 Actually, I am involved in a project whose goal is to develop the technology that

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:40.400
 would allow us to leave the solar system and visit the nearest stars. And that is called the

1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:48.880
 Starshot. In May 2015, an entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, Yuri Milner, came to my office

1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:57.760
 at Harvard and said, would you be interested in leading a project that would do that in our lifetime?

1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:04.000
 Because as we discussed before, to traverse those distances with existing rockets would take

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:11.920
 tens of thousands of years. And that's too long. For example, to get to Proxima Centauri with

1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:19.600
 the kind of spacecrafts that we already sent, like New Horizons or Voyager 1, Voyager 2,

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:27.840
 you needed to send them when the first humans left Africa, so that they would arrive there now.

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:34.960
 And that's a long time to wait. So Yuri wanted to do it within our lifetime, 10, 20 years,

1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:40.640
 meaning it has to move at a fraction of the speed of light. So can we send a spacecraft that would

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:46.080
 be moving at a fraction of the speed of light? And I said, let me look into that for six months.

1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:51.520
 And with my students and postdocs, we arrived to the conclusion that the only technology that

1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:59.200
 can do that is the light sail technology, where you basically produce a very powerful laser beam

1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:09.760
 on Earth. So you can collect sunlight with photovoltaic cells or whatever, and then convert it into

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:17.200
 stored energy and then produce a very powerful laser beam that is 100 gigawatts

1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:28.080
 and focus it on a sail in space that is roughly the size of a person, a couple of meters or a few

1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:37.600
 meters, that weighs only a gram or a few grams, very thin. And through the math, you can show that

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:42.640
 you can propel such a sail, if you shine on it for a few minutes, it will traverse a distance

1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:47.440
 that is five times the distance to the moon, and it will get to a fifth of the speed of light.

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.480
 Sounds crazy, but I've talked to a bunch of people and they're like, I know it sounds crazy,

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:59.840
 but it's actually, it will work. This is one of those, it's just beautiful. I mean, this is science.

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:09.040
 And the point is, people didn't get excited about space since the Apollo era. And it's about time,

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:15.360
 you know, for us to go into space. A couple of months ago, I was asked to participate in a debate

1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:21.360
 organized by IBM and Bloomberg News, and the discussion centered on the question,

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:28.800
 is the space race between the US and China good for humanity? And all the other debaters

1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:35.920
 were worried about the military threats. And I just couldn't understand what they're talking about,

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:42.000
 because military threats come from hovering above the surface of the earth, right? And

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:46.480
 we live on a two dimensional surface, we live on the surface of the earth,

1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:51.600
 but space is all about the third dimension getting far from Earth. So if you go to Mars,

1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:56.880
 or you go to a star, another star, there is no military threat. What are we talking about?

1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:03.120
 Space is all about, you know, feeling that, you know, we are one civilization, in fact,

1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:08.480
 not fighting each other, just going far and having aspirations for something that goes

1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:14.560
 beyond military threats. So why would we be worried that the space race will lead?

1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:21.120
 That's actually brilliant. You know, in our discourse about it, the space race is sometimes

1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:26.400
 made synonymous with like the Cold War, something like that, or with wars. But really, yeah, there

1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:31.040
 was a lot of ego tied up in that. I remember, I mean, it's still, still to this day, there's a

1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:35.440
 lot of pride that Russians, the Soviet Union was the first to space. And there's a lot of pride in

1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:39.680
 the American side that was the first on the moon. But yeah, you're exactly right. Like,

1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:45.200
 there's no aggression. There's no wars. And beyond that, if you think about the global economy

1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:50.640
 right now, there is a commercial interest. That's why Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are interested about,

1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:55.360
 you know, Mars and so on. There is a commercial interest which is international. It's not,

1:30:55.360 --> 1:31:02.880
 it's driven by money, not by pride. And, you know, nations can sign treaties. First of all,

1:31:03.440 --> 1:31:07.360
 there are lots of treaties that were signed even before the First World War and the Second World

1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:13.840
 War and the World War took place. So who cares, you know, like humans, treaties do not safeguard

1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:19.600
 anything, you know. But beyond that, even if nations sign treaties about space exploration,

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:25.760
 you might still find commercial entities that will find a way to get their launches. And,

1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:32.240
 you know, so I think we should rethink space. It has nothing to do with national pride. Once

1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:38.640
 again, nothing to do with our egos. It's about exploration. And the biggest problem, I think,

1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:45.760
 to human, in human history is that, is that humans tend to think about egos and about their,

1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:54.080
 their, their own personal image rather than look at the big picture. You know,

1:31:54.720 --> 1:32:00.160
 we will not be around for long. We are just occupying a small space right now. Let's move

1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:05.200
 out of this, you know, the way that Oscar Wilde said, I think is the best. He said,

1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:10.560
 all of us are in the gutters, but some of us are looking at the stars.

1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:17.360
 Yeah. And the more of us are looking at the stars, the likelier we are to, uh, to this,

1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:22.800
 for this thing, for this little experiment we have going on to last, last a while, as opposed

1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:27.920
 to end too quickly. I mean, it's not just about science of being humble. It's, it's about the

1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:34.240
 survival of the human species is being, is being humble. To me, it's incredibly inspiring, the

1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:40.800
 Starshop project of, I mean, there's something magical about being able to go to another habitable

1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:47.600
 planet and take a picture even. I mean, within our lifetime, I mean, that, that, uh, with crazy

1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:54.560
 technology too, which I should tell you how it was conceived. So, um, I was at the time, um,

1:32:54.560 --> 1:33:01.440
 so after six months past, after the visit of Urimillah, uh, I was usually I go in December

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:09.120
 during the winter break, I go to Israel. Um, I used to go to see my family and, uh, I get a phone call.

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:15.280
 Um, just before the weekend started, they get a phone call. Uh, Yuri would like you to present

1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:22.320
 your concept, um, in two weeks at his home. And I said, well, uh, thank you for letting me know,

1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:29.040
 because I'm actually out of the door of the hotel to go to a goat farm in the negative,

1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:35.520
 in the southern part of Israel with, because my wife wanted to have sort of, um, to go to a place

1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:42.960
 that is removed from civilization, so to speak. So we went to that goat farm and, you know,

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:49.360
 I need to make the presentation and, um, there was no internet connectivity except in the office

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:55.680
 of the goat farm. So the following morning at six a.m., I sit with my back to the office of

1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:02.800
 that goat farm looking at goats that were newly born and, uh, typing into my laptop the presentation,

1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:07.520
 you know, the PowerPoints presentation about, you know, our ambitions for visiting the nearest

1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:16.560
 star. And that was very surreal to me that, um, you know, look. Oh, like our origins in many ways,

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:23.280
 this very primitive origins and, uh, our dreams of looking out that it's brilliant. So that is

1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:33.520
 incredibly inspiring to me, but it's also inspiring of putting humans onto other, um, moons or

1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:38.560
 planets. I still find going to the moon really exciting. I don't know, maybe I'm just a sucker

1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:44.560
 for it, but it's really exciting. And Mars, which is a new place, a new planet, another

1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:49.120
 planet that might have life. I mean, there's something magical to that or some traces of

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:54.080
 previous life. You might think that humans cannot really survive. Uh, and, and there are risks

1:34:54.080 --> 1:35:01.120
 by going there. But my point is, you know, we started from Africa and we got to apartment

1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:06.240
 buildings in Manhattan, right? It's a very different environment from the jungles to

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:12.320
 live in an apartment building in, you know, a small cubicle. Um, and, you know, it took

1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:18.880
 tens of thousands of years, but humans adapted, right? So why couldn't humans also make the leap

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:24.880
 and adapt to a habitat in space? You know that now you can build a platform that would look like

1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:31.600
 an apartment building in the Bronx or somewhere, but have inside of it everything that humans need.

1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:37.520
 And it just like the space station, but bigger and it will be a platform in space. And the

1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:45.280
 advantage of that is if something bad happens on earth, you have that complex where humans live.

1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:50.960
 And you can also move it back and forth depending on how bright the sun gets. Uh, because, you know,

1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:58.160
 within, within a billion years, within a billion years, the sun would be too hot and it will boil

1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:02.800
 off all the oceans on earth. So we cannot stay here for more than a billion years. That's for sure.

1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:09.040
 Yes. So that's a billion years from now. Uh, I prefer like shorter term deadlines. And so

1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:13.840
 in, in that's, I mean, there's a lot of threats that we're facing currently. Do you find it exciting

1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:21.440
 the possibility of, uh, you know, uh, landing on Mars and starting little like, uh, building a

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:27.120
 Manhattan style apartment building on Mars and humans occupying it? Do you think from a scientific

1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:32.960
 or an engineering perspective that's, uh, that's a worthy pursuit? I think it's worthy, but the

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:40.480
 real issue that is often, uh, underplayed is the risk to the human body from cosmic rays.

1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:47.920
 Right. These are energetic particles and we are protected from them by the magnetic field around

1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:54.560
 the earth, uh, that blocks them. But if you go to Mars where there is no such magnetic field to

1:36:54.560 --> 1:37:00.320
 block them, then, um, you know, a significant fraction of the brain cells in your, your head

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:07.840
 will be damaged within a year. And the consequences of that are not clear. I mean, uh, it's quite

1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:13.840
 possible that humans cannot really survive on the surface. Now it may mean that we need to dig

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:20.720
 tunnels, uh, go underground or create some protection. Uh, this is something that can be engineered.

1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:25.760
 Yes. Uh, and, you know, we can start from the moon and then move to Mars. That would be a natural

1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:32.400
 progression, but it's a big, uh, issue that needs to be dealt with. I don't think, you know, it's

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:38.160
 a showstopper. I think we can overcome it, but, you know, just like anything in science and technology,

1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:44.080
 you have to work on it for a while, figure out solutions. And, but it's not as rosy as Elon

1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:49.840
 Musk talks about. I mean, Elon Musk can obviously be optimistic. I think eventually it will boil

1:37:49.840 --> 1:37:56.080
 down to figuring out, um, how to cope with this risk, the health risk. Yeah. I mean, uh, in defense

1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:03.200
 of optimism, I, I find that there's at least a correlation, if not their best friends is optimism

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:13.360
 and open mindedness is, uh, it's a necessary, it's precondition to do, to do, to try crazy things.

1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:21.280
 And, uh, in that sense, there, uh, the sense I have about going to Mars, if we use today's logic

1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:29.760
 of what kind of benefits we'll get from that, we're never going to go. Uh, and like most decisions

1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:37.360
 we'll make in life, most decisions we've made as a human species are irrational. If you just,

1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:43.360
 if you look at just today, but if you look at the long arc and the possibilities that it might bring,

1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:50.800
 just like humans, uh, uh, Europe and Europe and, and, and by the way, it was destroyed everybody

1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:57.360
 and, uh, but it was a commercial interest that drove that, uh, for trade. And you know, it might

1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:02.000
 happen again in this context. You have people like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk that are commercially

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:09.280
 driven to go to space. Yes. But it doesn't mean that what we will ultimately find is not new worlds,

1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:15.120
 you know, that have nothing, you know, much, have much more to offer than just commercial interest.

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:20.880
 And, uh, as a side effect almost, right? Yeah. Yeah. And then that's why I think, you know,

1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:26.240
 we should be open minded and explore. And however, at the same time, because of the reasons you

1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:32.080
 pointed out, uh, I'm not optimistic that we will survive more than a few centuries into the future,

1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:37.520
 because people do not think long term. And that means that we will only survive for the short

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:42.640
 term. I don't know if you have thoughts about this, but what are the things that were you the most

1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:48.320
 about, uh, from the great perspective of the universe, which is the great filters that destroys

1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:54.080
 intelligence civilizations, but for our own species here, uh, like what are the things that

1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:58.880
 worry you the most? Yeah. The thing that worries me the most is that people pay attention to how

1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:07.600
 many likes they have on Twitter. And, uh, rather than, you know, basketball coaches tell the team

1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:14.640
 players, keep your eyes on the ball, not on the audience. The problem is we keep our eyes

1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:19.680
 on the audience most of the time. Let's keep our eyes on the ball. And what does that mean?

1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:25.520
 First of all, in context of science, it means pay attention to the evidence. When the evidence looks

1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:33.920
 strange, then we should figure it out. You know, I went to a seminar about Uumuamua at Harvard

1:40:33.920 --> 1:40:42.560
 and a colleague of mine that is a mainstream conservative would never say anything that would

1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:49.760
 deviate from what everyone else is thinking, said to me after the seminar, I wish this object

1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:57.520
 never existed. Now, to me, I mean, I just couldn't hear that. What do you mean? Nature is whatever

1:40:57.520 --> 1:41:03.200
 it is. You have to pay attention to it. You cannot say, you know, you cannot bury your head in this.

1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:08.240
 I mean, you should bless nature for giving you clues about things that you haven't expected.

1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:14.800
 And I think that's the biggest fault that we are looking for confirmations of things we already know

1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:22.480
 so that we can maintain our pride that we already knew it and maintain our image,

1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:27.360
 not make mistakes because we already knew it. Therefore, we expected the right thing. But

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:33.120
 science is a learning experience and sometimes you're wrong. And let's learn from those mistakes.

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:39.360
 And what's the problem about that? Why do we have to get prizes and why do we get to be

1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:44.880
 honoured and maintain our image when the actual objective of science is learning about nature?

1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:52.560
 You've talked about anomalies in this case are actually not things that are unfortunate and to

1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:57.760
 be ignored are in fact gifts and should be the focus of science. Exactly, because that's the

1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:02.720
 way for us to improve our understanding. If you look at quantum mechanics, nobody dreamed about it.

1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:09.120
 And it was revolutionary and we still don't fully understand it. It's a pain for us to figure out.

1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:12.880
 So why do you think so? I understand from the science from the perspective of that's holding

1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:21.120
 our science back. Why do you ever sense that that's also something that might be a problem for us in

1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:26.240
 terms of the survival of human civilization? Because when you look at society, it operates

1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:35.600
 by the same principles. There is a people look for affirmation by groups and they,

1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:41.440
 you know, people segregate into herds that think like them, especially these days when

1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:47.520
 social media is so strong, you can find your support group. And if you don't look for evidence

1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:52.240
 for what you're saying, you can say crazy things. As long as there are enough people supporting what

1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:58.400
 you say, you can even have your newspapers. You can have everything to support your view.

1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:02.720
 And then, you know, bad things will happen to society because we're detaching ourselves from

1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:08.000
 reality. And if we detach ourselves from reality, all the destructive things that naturally can

1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.560
 occur in the real world, whether from nuclear weapons, all the kinds of threats that we're

1:43:12.560 --> 1:43:19.920
 facing, even we're living through a pandemic, the supposed, you know, a much, much worse pandemic

1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:25.760
 can happen. And then we could sadly, like we did this one, politicize it in some kind of way and

1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:31.840
 have bickering in the space of Twitter and politics as opposed to there's an actual thing that can

1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:37.520
 destroy the human species. Exactly. So the only way for us to maintain, to stay modest and learn

1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:44.000
 about what really happens is by looking for evidence. Again, I'm saying it's not about our

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:50.000
 self, you know, it's about figuring out what's around us. And if you close yourself by surrounding

1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:56.800
 yourself with people that are like minded, that refuse to look at the evidence, you can do bad

1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:03.520
 things. And throughout human history, that's the origin of all the bad things that happen.

1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:09.200
 Yes. And I think it's a key. It's a key to be modest and to look at evidence. And it's not a

1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:16.720
 nuance. Now, you might say, Oh, okay, the uneducated person might operate. No, it's the

1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:22.560
 scientific community operates this way. My problem is not with people that don't have an

1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:29.840
 academic pedigree. It's included everywhere in society. On the topic of the discovery of

1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:34.160
 evidence of alien civilizations, which is something you touch on in your book, what that

1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:41.520
 idea would do to societies, to the human psyche. And in general, do you think,

1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:51.760
 and you talk about the, I still have trouble pronouncing, but a more, more wager, right? What

1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:57.120
 do you think is, can you explain it? And what do you think in general is the effect that such

1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:03.440
 knowledge might have on human civilization? Right. So Pascal had this wager about God.

1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:08.560
 And by the way, there are interesting connections between theology and the search for extraterrestrial

1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:14.640
 life. You know, it's possible that, you know, we were planted on this planet by another civilization

1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:20.080
 that, you know, we attribute to God powers that are that belong really to the technological

1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:27.840
 civilization. But putting that aside, Pascal basically said, you know, let's, the two possibilities,

1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:35.360
 either God exists or not, right? And if God exists, you know, the consequences are quite

1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:41.520
 significant. And therefore, you know, we should, we should consider that possibility differently

1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:50.480
 than equal weight to both possibilities. And I suggest that we do the same with Oumuamua or

1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:59.360
 other technological signatures that we keep in mind the consequences. And therefore,

1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:05.520
 pay more attention to that possibility. Now, some people say, extraordinary claims require

1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:12.240
 extraordinary evidence. My point is that the term extraordinary is really subjective, you know.

1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:18.800
 For one person, a black hole is extraordinary. For another, you know, it's just a consequence

1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:25.040
 of Einstein's theory of gravity. It's nothing extraordinary. The same about the type of dark

1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:32.400
 matter or anything. So we should leave the extraordinary part of that sentence. Just

1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:38.720
 keep evidence. Okay, so let's be guided by evidence. And even if we have extraordinary

1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:44.000
 claims, you know, let's not dismiss them because the evidence is not extraordinary enough, because

1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:49.200
 if we have an image of something, and it looks really strange, and we say, oh, the image is not

1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:53.840
 sufficiently sharp. Therefore, we should not even pay attention to this image or not even consider.

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:59.120
 I think that's a mistake. What we should do is say, look, there is some evidence for something

1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:06.160
 unusual. Let's try and build instruments that will give us a better image. And if you just dismiss

1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:12.880
 extraordinary claims, because you consider them extraordinary, you avoid discovering things that

1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:19.920
 you haven't expected. And so I believe that along the history of astronomy, there are many missed

1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:24.320
 opportunities. And I speak about astronomy, but I'm sure in other fields, it's also true. I mean,

1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:30.320
 this is my expertise. For example, you know, the astrophysical journal, which is the main primary

1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:37.680
 publication in astrophysics. If you go, you go beyond before the 1980s, there are images that

1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:45.040
 were posted in the astrophysical journal of giant arcs, you know, arcs of light surrounding clusters

1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:51.520
 of galaxies. And, you know, you can find it in printed versions of the astrophysical journal,

1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:57.360
 people just ignore, they put the image, they see the arc, they say, who knows what it is and just

1:47:57.360 --> 1:48:04.880
 ignore it. And then in the 1980s, the subject of gravitational lensing became popular. And the

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:14.320
 idea is that you can deflect light by the force of gravity. And then you can put a source behind

1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:18.800
 the cluster of galaxies, and then you will get these arcs. And actually Einstein predicted it

1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:26.880
 in 1940. And, you know, so these things were expected, but people just had them in the images,

1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:31.760
 didn't pay attention. So I'm sure there are lost opportunities sometimes, even in existing data,

1:48:31.760 --> 1:48:37.680
 you have things that are unusual and exceptional, and they're not being addressed.

1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:44.080
 Yeah, you actually, I think you have the article, the data is not enough from quite a few years ago,

1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:49.600
 where you talk, you know, we can go back to the 70s and 80s, but we can go also to the Mayan

1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:54.640
 civilization. Right, the Mayan civilization basically believed in astrology that you can

1:48:54.640 --> 1:49:01.280
 forecast the outcome of a war based on the position of the planets. And they had, you know,

1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:08.240
 astronomers in their culture had the highest social status. They were priests, they were

1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:14.160
 elevated. And the reason was that they helped politicians decide when to go to war, because

1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:18.240
 they would tell the politicians, you know, the planets would be in this configuration,

1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:25.200
 it's a better chance for you to win the war, go to war. And in retrospect, they collected wonderful

1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:32.400
 data, but misinterpreted it, because we now know that the position of Venus, or Jupiter, or whatever,

1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:38.480
 has nothing to do with the outcome of World War I, World War II, you know, has nothing to do. And

1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:45.360
 so we can have a prejudice and collect data without actually doing the right thing with it.

1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:50.000
 That's such a Pisces thing to say. I looked up what your astrological sign is.

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.440
 So you mentioned Einstein predicted that black holes don't exist,

1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:04.320
 or just don't exist in nature. When Einstein came up with this theory of gravity in 1915,

1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:12.000
 November 1915, a few months later, another physicist, Karl Schwarzschild, he was the

1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.880
 director of the Potsdam Observatory, but he was a patriot, a German patriot. So he went into the

1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:23.120
 First World War fighting for Germany. But while he was at the front, he sent a postcard to Einstein

1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:27.120
 saying, you know, a few months after the theory was developed, saying, actually, I found a solution

1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:32.960
 to your equations. And that was a black hole solution. And then he died a few months later.

1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:39.280
 And Einstein was a pacifist, and he survived. So the lesson from this story is that if you want to

1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:46.320
 work out the consequences of a theory, you better be a pacifist. But the point is that

1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:54.560
 this solution was known shortly after Einstein came up with his theory. But in 1939, Einstein

1:50:54.560 --> 1:51:00.000
 wrote a paper in the analysis of mathematics saying, even though the solution exists,

1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:05.760
 I don't think it's realized in nature. And his argument was, if you imagine a star collapsing,

1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:11.280
 stars often spin, and the spin will prevent them from making a black hole,

1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:19.120
 collapsing to a point. So I mean, can you maybe one of the many things you you have worked on,

1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:24.960
 you're an expert in black holes? Can you first say what are black holes? And second,

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:30.320
 how do we know that they exist? Right. So black holes are the ultimate prison.

1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:38.160
 You know, you can check in, but you can never check out. Even light cannot escape from them.

1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:44.720
 So there are extreme structures of space and time. And there is this so called Schwarzschild

1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:51.760
 radius or the event horizon of a black hole. Once you enter into it with a spaceship,

1:51:52.480 --> 1:51:56.960
 you would never be able to tweet back to your friends and tell them, by the way,

1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:00.240
 I asked the students in my class, Freshman seminar at Harvard, I said,

1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:07.680
 let me give you two possible journeys that you can take. I said, suppose aliens come to earth

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:16.160
 and suggest that you would board our spaceship, would you do it? And the second is suppose you

1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:21.360
 could board a spaceship that will take you into a black hole, would you do it? So all of them said

1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:29.280
 to the first question, yes, under one condition, that I'll be able to maintain my social media

1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:35.520
 contacts and report back, share the experience with them. I couldn't personally, I have no footprint

1:52:35.520 --> 1:52:41.120
 on social media. Yeah, which is as a matter of principle. Yeah, my wife asked me when we got

1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:48.160
 married. And I honoured that. And I told you offline, I need to get married to such a woman.

1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:55.120
 She truly is a special lady. Well, she was wise enough to recognise the risk. But it saves me time.

1:52:55.120 --> 1:53:02.320
 And it also keeps me away from crowds. You know, I don't have the notion of what a lot of other

1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:09.760
 people think. So I can think independently. Exactly. So I was surprised to hear that for

1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:13.920
 students, it's extremely important to share experiences. Even if they go on a spaceship

1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:19.680
 with aliens, they still want to brag about it rather than look around and see what's going on.

1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:22.960
 This is not an option when you go to the black hole. It's exactly the point.

1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:29.440
 So for the black hole, they said no, because obviously you can find your death after you

1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:34.880
 get into it. You crash in the singularity. There is this singularity in the centre. So

1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:43.360
 inside the event horizon, we know that all the matter collects at a point. Now, we can't really

1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:49.040
 predict what happens at the singularity because Einstein's theory breaks down. And we know why

1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:53.280
 it breaks down because it doesn't have quantum mechanics that talks about small distances.

1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:59.600
 We don't have a theory that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity so that it will predict

1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:06.400
 what happens near a singularity. And in fact, you know, I once, a couple of years ago, I had a

1:54:06.400 --> 1:54:14.800
 flood in my basement. I mean, and I invited a plumber to come over and figure out. And we

1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:23.440
 found that the sewer was clogged because of tree roots that got into it. And we solved the problem.

1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:30.640
 But then I thought to myself, well, isn't that what happens to the singularity of a black hole?

1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:37.360
 Because the question is, where does the matter go? You know, in the case of a home, I never

1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:42.880
 thought about it. But the water, all the water that we use goes in through the sewer to some

1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:49.280
 reservoir somewhere. And the question is, what happens inside a black hole? And one possibility

1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:53.120
 is that there is an object in the middle, just like a star, you know, and everything collects

1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:58.720
 there. And the object has the maximum density that we can imagine, like Planck density. It's

1:54:58.720 --> 1:55:05.520
 the ultimate density that you can have, where gravity is as strong as all the other forces.

1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:12.000
 So you can imagine this object, very dense object at the center that collects all the matter.

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:17.920
 Another possibility is that there is some tunnel just like the sewer. It takes the matter into

1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:24.160
 another place. And we don't know the answer. But I wrote a Scientific American essay about it,

1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:29.120
 admitting our ignorance. It's a fascinating question. What happens to the matter that goes

1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:33.600
 into a black hole? I actually recommended to some of my colleagues that work on string theory

1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.200
 at the closing of a conference. I'm the founding director of the Black Hole Initiative

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:43.760
 at Harvard, which brings together astronomers, physicists, philosophers, and mathematicians.

1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:49.520
 And we have a conference once a year. And at the end of one of them, since I'm the director,

1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:57.040
 I had to summarize and I said that I wish we could go on a field trip to a black hole nearby.

1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:03.680
 And I highly recommend to my colleagues that work on string theory to enter into that black hole,

1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:09.680
 because then they can test their theory when they get inside. But one of the string theories

1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:15.200
 in the audience, Nimar Khani Hamid, immediately raised his voice and said, you have an ulterior

1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:21.360
 motive for sending us into a black hole, which I didn't deny, but at any event.

1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:31.600
 Yeah, that's true. That's true. Can you say why we know that black holes exist?

1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:39.520
 Right. So it's an interesting question because black holes were considered a theoretical construct.

1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:49.680
 And Einstein even denied their existence in 1939. But then in the mid 1960s,

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:55.440
 quasars were discovered. These are very bright sources of light,

1:56:55.440 --> 1:57:03.520
 a hundred times brighter than their host galaxy, which are point like at the center of galaxies.

1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:12.800
 And it was immediately suggested by Ed Salpeter in the West and by Yakov Zeldovich in the East,

1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:20.560
 that these are black holes that accrete gas, collect gas from their host galaxy that are

1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:27.600
 being fed with gas. And they shine very brightly because as the gas falls towards the black holes,

1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:40.080
 just like water running down the sink, the gas swirls and then rubs against itself and heats up

1:57:40.640 --> 1:57:47.360
 and shines very brightly because it's very hot close to the black hole by viscosity.

1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:53.760
 It heats up. And in the case of black holes, it's the turbulence, the turbulent viscosity

1:57:53.760 --> 1:58:00.000
 that causes it to heat up. So we get these very bright sources of light just from black holes

1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:06.800
 that are supposed to be dark. Nothing escapes from them, but they create a violent environment

1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:11.280
 where gas moves close to the speed of light and therefore shines very brightly,

1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:16.240
 much more than any other source in the sky. And we can see these quasars all the way to

1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:23.280
 the edge of the universe. So we have evidence now that when the universe was about 7% of its

1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:30.000
 present age, infant, already back then, you had black holes of a billion times the mass of the

1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:39.120
 sun, which is quite remarkable. It's like finding giant babies in a nursery. How can these black

1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:44.400
 holes grow so fast? Less than a billion years after the Big Bang, you already have a billion times

1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:49.920
 the mass of the sun in these black holes. And the answer is presumably there are very quick

1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:59.120
 processes that build them up. They build quickly. Very quickly. And so we see those black holes.

1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:09.840
 And that was found in the mid 1960s, but in 2015, exactly 100 years after Einstein came up with his

1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:17.360
 theory of gravity, the LIGO observatory detected gravitational waves. And these are just ripples

1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:22.560
 in space and time. So according to Einstein's theory, the innovation, the ingenuity of Einstein's

1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:30.160
 theory of gravity that was formulated in November 1915 was to say that space and time

1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:39.520
 are not rigid. You know, they are, they respond to matter. So for example, if you have two black

1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:47.680
 holes and they collide, it's just like a stone being thrown into the surface of a pond. They

1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:53.840
 generate waves, disturbances in space and time that propagate out at the speed of light. These

1:59:53.840 --> 1:59:59.360
 are gravitational waves. They create a space time storm around them. And then the waves go

2:00:00.320 --> 2:00:06.080
 all the way through the universe and reach us. And if you have a sensitive enough detector like

2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:12.160
 LIGO, you can detect these waves. And so it was not just the message that we received for the

2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:17.680
 first time, gravitational waves, but it was the messenger. So there are two aspects to it. One

2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:21.760
 is the messenger, which is gravitational wave. For the first time, we're detected directly.

2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:26.800
 And the second was the message, which was a collision of two black holes, because we could

2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:33.600
 see the pattern of the ripples in space and time. And it was fully consistent with the prediction

2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:38.640
 that Schwartz had made for how a black, the space time around the black hole is, because when two

2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:46.000
 black holes collide, you can sort of map from the message that you get, you can reconstruct what

2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:54.720
 really happened. And it's fully consistent. And in 2017 and 2020, there's two Nobel prizes.

2:00:54.720 --> 2:01:01.760
 That's right. That had to do with the black holes. Can you maybe describe in the same

2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:06.720
 massive way that you've already been doing what those Nobel prizes were given for?

2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:11.280
 Yeah. So the 2017 was given for the LIGO collaboration for discovering

2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:19.920
 gravitation waves from collisions of black holes. And the 2020 Nobel prize in physics

2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:29.440
 was given for two things. One was theoretical work that was done by Roger Penrose in the 1960s,

2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:38.320
 demonstrating that black holes are inevitable when stars collapse. And it was mostly mathematical

2:01:38.320 --> 2:01:45.280
 work. And actually, Stephen Hawking also contributed significantly to that frontier. And

2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:51.600
 unfortunately, he is not alive, so he could not be honored. So Penrose received it on his own.

2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:58.560
 And then two other astronomers received it as well, Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel,

2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:03.840
 and they provided conclusive evidence that there is a black hole at the center of the Milky Way

2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:11.280
 galaxy that weighs about four million times the mass of the sun. And they found the evidence from

2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:16.640
 the motion of stars very close to the black hole, just like we see the planets moving around the

2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:21.920
 planets moving around the sun. There are stars close to the center of the galaxy, and they are

2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:27.680
 orbiting at very high speeds of other thousands of kilometers per second, or thousands of miles

2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:38.240
 per second. Think about it, which can only be induced at those distances if there is a four

2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:47.040
 million solar mass object that is extremely compact. And the only thing that is compatible

2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:54.640
 with the constraints is a black hole. And they actually made a movie of the motion of these

2:02:54.640 --> 2:03:01.120
 stars around the center. One of them moves around the center over a decade, over timescales that

2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:11.280
 we can monitor. And it was a breakthrough in a way. So combining LIGO with the detection of

2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:15.920
 a black hole at the center of the Milky Way and in many other galaxies like quasars,

2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:26.320
 now I would say black hole research is vogue. It's very much in fashion. We saw it back in

2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:34.800
 2016 when we established the black hole initiative. You saw that there is this excitement about in

2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:41.600
 breakthroughs and discoveries around black holes, which are probably one of the most fascinating

2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:49.200
 objects in the universe. It's up there. They're both terrifying and beautiful, and they capture

2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:53.440
 the entirety of the physics that we know about this universe. I should say the question is,

2:03:53.440 --> 2:04:00.880
 where is the nearest black hole? Can we visit it? I wrote a paper with my undergraduate student,

2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:07.600
 Amir Siraj, suggesting that perhaps if there is one in the solar system, we can detect it.

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:16.000
 I don't know if you heard, but there is a claim that maybe there is a Planet 9 in the solar system

2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:22.480
 because we see some anomalies at the outer parts of the solar system. So some people suggested

2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:28.080
 maybe there is a planet out there that was not yet detected. So people searched for it,

2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:33.760
 didn't find it. It weighs roughly five times the mass of the Earth. And we said, okay, maybe you

2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:38.000
 can't find it because it's a black hole that was formed early in the universe.

2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.640
 So where do you stand on that?

2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:44.560
 It could be that the dark matter is made of black holes of this mass. We don't know what

2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:50.240
 the dark matter is made of. It could be black holes. So we said, but there is an experimental

2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:59.680
 way to test it. And the way to do it is because there is the ore cloud of icy rocks in the outer

2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:06.080
 solar system. And if you imagine a black hole there, every now and then, a rock will pass

2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:12.240
 close enough to the black hole to be disrupted by the very strong gravity close to the black hole.

2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:17.280
 And that would produce a flare that you can observe. And we calculated how frequently these

2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:23.120
 flares should occur. And with LSSD on the Vera Rubin Observatory, we found that you can actually

2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:29.360
 test this hypothesis. And if you don't see flares, then you can put limits on the existence of a

2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:33.920
 black hole in the solar system. It would be extremely exciting if there was a black hole,

2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:38.960
 if Planet Nine was a black hole, because we could visit it and we can examine it.

2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:45.360
 And it will not be a matter of an object that is very removed from us.

2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:49.680
 Another thing I should say is, it's possible that the black hole affected life on Earth.

2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:58.080
 The black hole at the center of the Milky Way. How? You know, that black hole right now is

2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:05.760
 dormant. It's very faint. But we know that it flares. When a star like the Sun comes close to

2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:13.360
 it, the star will be spaghettified, basically become a stream of gas, like a spaghetti. And then

2:06:13.360 --> 2:06:18.720
 the gas would fall into the black hole and there would be a flare. And this process happens once

2:06:18.720 --> 2:06:23.840
 every 10,000 years or so. So we expect that, you know, these flares to occur every 10,000 years.

2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:31.440
 But we also see evidence for the possibility that gas clouds were disrupted by the black hole,

2:06:31.440 --> 2:06:37.200
 because the stars that are close to the black hole are residing in a single or two planes.

2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:42.160
 And the only way you can get that is if they formed out of a disk of gas, just like the

2:06:42.160 --> 2:06:48.720
 planets in the solar system formed. So there is evidence that gas fell into the black hole and

2:06:48.720 --> 2:06:57.200
 powered possibly a flare. And these flares produce X rays and ultraviolet radiation that could damage

2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:05.280
 life if the Earth was close enough to the center of the galaxy. Where we are right now, it's not

2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:13.840
 very risky for us. But there is a theoretical argument that says the solar system, the Sun,

2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:21.680
 was closer to the galactic center early on, and then it migrated outwards. So maybe in the early

2:07:22.800 --> 2:07:30.000
 stage of the solar system, the conditions were affected, shaped by these flares

2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.840
 of the black hole at the center of the galaxy. And that's why for the first two billion years,

2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:39.920
 there wasn't any oxygen in the atmosphere, who knows. But it's just interesting to think that

2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:48.800
 from a theoretical concept that Einstein resisted in 1939, it may well be that black holes have

2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:57.680
 influence on our life. And that it's just like discovering that some stranger affected your

2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:06.560
 family and in a way, your life. And if that happens to be the case, a second Nobel Prize

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:11.920
 should be given not for just the discovery of this black hole at the center of the galaxy,

2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:15.840
 but perhaps for the Nobel Prize in chemistry for the effect that it had.

2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:19.840
 But the effect for the interplay that resulted in some kind of,

2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:26.720
 yeah, the chemical effect, biology, I mean, all those kinds of things in terms of

2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:33.360
 the emergence of life and the creation of a habitable environment. That's so fascinating.

2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:36.800
 And of course, like you said, dark matter, like black holes have some...

2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:43.200
 They could be the dark matter in principle, yes. We don't know what the dark matter is at the moment.

2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:47.920
 Does it make you sad? So you've had an interaction and perhaps a bit of a friendship

2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:52.000
 with Stephen Hawking. Does it make you sad that he didn't win the Nobel?

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:57.440
 Well, all together, I don't assign great importance to prizes because...

2:08:58.000 --> 2:08:58.480
 As you said.

2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:04.640
 You know, Jean Paul Satter, who I admire as a teenager because I was interested in philosophy.

2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:10.160
 When I grew up on a farm in Israel, I used to collect eggs every afternoon and I would drive

2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:15.600
 the tractor to the hills of our village and just think about philosophy, read philosophy books.

2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:21.760
 And Jean Paul Satter was one of my favorites. And he was honored with the Nobel Prize in literature.

2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:27.600
 He was a philosopher primarily, existentialist. And he said, the hell with it, why should I give

2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:36.160
 special attention to this committee of people that get their self importance from awarding me

2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:43.760
 the prize? Why does that merit my attention? So he gave up on the Nobel Prize.

2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:51.040
 And, you know, there are two benefits to that. One, that you don't, you're not working your

2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:56.080
 entire life in the direction that would satisfy the will of other people. You know, you work

2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:02.240
 independently, you're not after these honors. Just for the same reason that if you're not

2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:08.720
 living your life from making a profit or money, you can live a more fulfilling life because you're

2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:15.520
 not being swayed by the wind, you know, of how to make money and so forth. The second aspect of

2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:26.720
 it is, you know, that very often, you know, these prizes, they, they distort the way we do science

2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:35.680
 because instead of people willing to take risks, and instead of having announcements only after

2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:43.520
 a group of people converges with a definite result, you know, the natural progression of

2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:48.880
 science is based on trial and error, you know, so reporting some results and perhaps they're wrong,

2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:53.760
 but then other people find perhaps better evidence and then you figure out what's going on. And

2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:58.720
 that's the natural way that science is, you know, it's a learning experience. So if you give the

2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:04.240
 public an image by which scientists are always right, you know, and, and, and, you know, some of

2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:08.640
 my colleagues say we must do that because otherwise the public will never believe us that global

2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:12.960
 warming is really taking place. But that's not true because the public will really believe you

2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:18.000
 if you show the evidence. So the point is you should be sincere when the evidence is not

2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:22.160
 absolutely clear or whether there are disputes about the interpretation of the evidence, we

2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:28.320
 should show ourselves, you know, the king is naked. Okay. There is no point in pretending that the

2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:35.040
 king is dressed, saying that scientists are always right. Scientists are wrong frequently.

2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:41.120
 And the only way to make progress is by evidence, giving us the support that we need to make

2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:47.920
 airtight arguments. So when you say global warming is taking place, if the evidence is

2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:53.680
 fully supportive, there are no holes in the argument, then people will be convinced because

2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:57.600
 you're not trying to fool them. When the evidence was not complete, you also show them that the

2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:01.360
 evidence is not complete. And when there's holes, you show that there's holes and here's the

2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:05.840
 methodology we're using to try to close those holes. Exactly. Let's be sincere. Why pretend?

2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:09.840
 So if there were no, in a world where there were, there were no prizes, no honours,

2:12:10.640 --> 2:12:16.480
 we would act like kids, as I said before, we would really be focusing on the ball and not

2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:22.640
 on the audience. Yeah, the prizes get in the way and it's, it's so powerful. Do you think

2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:28.560
 in some sense the few people that have turned down the prize made a much more powerful statement?

2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:33.360
 I don't know if you're familiar in the space of mathematics with the Fields Medal

2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:40.640
 and a good girl at Perlman who turned down the prize. So he, I've committed, one of the reasons

2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:46.000
 I started this podcast is I'm going to definitely talk to Putin, I'm definitely talking to Perlman

2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:52.240
 and people keep telling me it's impossible. I love hearing that because I'll talk to both.

2:12:52.240 --> 2:13:02.640
 Anyway, but do you have a sense of why he turned down the prize and is that a powerful statement

2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:07.760
 to you? Well, what I read is that you're talking about the mathematician. The mathematician turned

2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:12.480
 down the prize. What I read is that he was disappointed by the response of the community,

2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:19.360
 the mainstream community, the mathematicians, to his earlier work where they dismissed it,

2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:25.920
 they didn't attend to the details and didn't treat him with proper respect because he was not

2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:34.000
 considered one of them. And I think that speaks volumes about the current scientific culture

2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:43.440
 which is based on groupthink and on social interaction rather than on the merit of the

2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:48.480
 argument and on the evidence in the context of physics. So in mathematics there is no empirical

2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:54.720
 basis, you're exploring ideas that are logically consistent, but nevertheless there is this

2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:03.040
 groupthink. And I think he was so frustrated with his past experience that he didn't even bother to

2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:09.680
 publish his papers, he just posted them on the archive and in a way saying, you know,

2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:16.000
 I know what the answer is, go look at it. And then again, in the long arc of history,

2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:22.640
 his work on archive will be remembered and all the prizes, most of the prizes will be forgotten.

2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:28.800
 That's what people don't kind of think about. When you look at Roger Penrose, for example,

2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:35.280
 is another fascinating figure. You know, it's possible, and forgive me if I'm sure I'm ignorant,

2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:40.800
 but he's also did some work on consciousness. He's been one of the only people who spoke about

2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:48.720
 consciousness, which for the longest time is still arguably outside of the realm of the sciences.

2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:57.440
 It's still seen as a taboo subject. And he was brave enough to explore it from a physics

2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:02.880
 perspective, from just a philosophical perspective, but with the rigor, like proposing different

2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:08.160
 kind of hypotheses of how consciousness might be able to emerge in the brain. And it's possible

2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:13.280
 that that is the thing he's remembered for, if you look hundred years from now, right? As opposed

2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:22.000
 to the work in the black holes, which fits into the kind of, like the fits into what the current

2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:28.800
 scientific community allows to be the space of what is and isn't science.

2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:34.720
 Yeah, it's really interesting to look at people that are innovators, where in some phases of their

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:42.400
 career, their ideas fit into the social structure that is around them, but in other phases,

2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:47.280
 it doesn't. And when you look at them, they just operated the same way throughout.

2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:52.720
 And it says more about their environment than about them.

2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:55.280
 Well, yeah, I don't know if you know who Max Tagmark is.

2:15:55.280 --> 2:15:58.000
 Yeah, of course. He's a friend of mine.

2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.880
 I just recently talked to him again. And he, I mean, he was a little bit more explicit about

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:07.200
 saying, you know, being aware, which is something I also recommend is like being aware where the

2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:12.480
 scientific community stands and doing enough to get, like move along into your career in your

2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:17.840
 career. And yeah, it's the necessary evil, I suppose. If you are one of those out of the box

2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:23.600
 thinkers that just naturally have this childlike curiosity, which Max definitely is one of them,

2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:28.080
 is sometimes you have to do some stuff that fits in, you publish and you get 10 years and all those

2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:32.480
 kinds of things. But the tenure is a great privilege because it allows you to, in principle,

2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:40.000
 explore things that are not accepted by others. And unfortunately, it's not being taken advantage

2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:44.560
 of by most people. And it's a waste of a very precious resource.

2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:53.520
 Yeah, absolutely. The space that you kind of touched on, that's full of theories and is perhaps

2:16:53.520 --> 2:17:01.440
 detached from appreciation of empirical evidence or longing for empirical evidence or grounding

2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:08.480
 in empirical evidence is the theoretical physics community and the interest in unifying the laws

2:17:08.480 --> 2:17:16.480
 of physics and with the theory of everything. I'm not sure from which direction to approach

2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:23.200
 this question, but how far away are we from arriving at a theory of everything, do you think?

2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:33.280
 And how important is it to try to arrive at it at this kind of goal of this beautiful,

2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:46.160
 simple theory that unlocks the very fundamental basis of our nature as we know it? And what

2:17:46.160 --> 2:17:50.160
 are the kinds of approaches we need to take to get there?

2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:55.440
 Yeah, so in physics, the biggest challenge is to unify quantum mechanics with gravity.

2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:02.640
 And I believe that once we have experimental evidence for how this happens in nature,

2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:09.120
 in systems that have quantum mechanical effects, but also gravity is important,

2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:17.280
 then the theory will fall into our lap. But the mistake that is made by the community right

2:18:17.280 --> 2:18:26.000
 now is to come up with the right theory from scratch. And Einstein gave the illusion that you

2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:32.560
 can just sit in your office and understand nature when he came up with his general theory

2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:40.480
 of relativity. But first of all, perhaps he was lucky, but it's not a rule. The rule is that you

2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:44.320
 need evidence to guide you, especially when dealing with quantum mechanics, which is really

2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:53.440
 not intuitive. And so there are two places where the two theories meet. One is black holes.

2:18:54.320 --> 2:18:59.920
 And there is a puzzle there. It's called the information paradox. In principle, you can throw

2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:06.160
 the encyclopedia Britannica into a black hole. It's a lot of information. And then it will be

2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:15.040
 gone because a black hole carries only three properties or qualities, the mass, the charge,

2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:21.440
 and the spin, according to Einstein. But then when Hawking tried to bring in quantum mechanics

2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:28.400
 to the game, he realized that black holes have a temperature and they radiate. This is called

2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:38.880
 Hawking radiation. And it was sort of anticipated by Jacob Bekenstein before him. And Hawking wanted

2:19:38.880 --> 2:19:44.800
 to prove Bekenstein wrong and then figure this out. And so what it means is black holes eventually

2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:50.880
 evaporate. And they evaporate into radiation that doesn't carry this information, according to

2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:55.920
 Hawking's calculation. And then the question is, according to quantum mechanics, information must

2:19:55.920 --> 2:20:04.560
 be preserved. So where did the information go if a black hole is gone? And where is the information

2:20:04.560 --> 2:20:10.960
 that was encoded in the encyclopedia when it went into the black hole? And to that question,

2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:15.920
 we don't have an answer yet. It's one of those puzzles about black holes. And it touches on the

2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:22.320
 interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. Another important question is, what happened

2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:28.400
 at the beginning of the universe? What happened before the Big Bang? And by the way, on that,

2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:36.320
 I should say, you know, there are some conjectures. In principle, if we figure it out, if we have a

2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:42.640
 theory of quantum gravity, it's possible to imagine that we will figure out how to create a universe

2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:49.920
 in the laboratory. By irritating the vacuum, you might create a baby universe. And if we do that,

2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:55.040
 it will offer a solution to what happened before the Big Bang. Perhaps the Big Bang emerged from

2:20:55.040 --> 2:21:01.920
 the laboratory of another civilization. So it's like, baby universes are being born out of laboratories.

2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:07.440
 And inside the baby universe, you have a civilization that brings to existence a new baby

2:21:07.440 --> 2:21:12.560
 universe, just like humans, right? We have babies and they make babies. So in principle,

2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:19.040
 that would solve the problem of why there was a Big Bang, and also what happened before the

2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:25.840
 Big Bang. So we came, our umbilical cord is connected to a laboratory of a civilization that

2:21:25.840 --> 2:21:32.960
 produced our universe once it figured out quantum gravity. It's baby Big Bangs all the way down.

2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:38.000
 It's just Big Bangs all the way down. So if we collect data about how the universe started,

2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:44.240
 we could potentially test theories, or it can educate us about how to unify quantum mechanics

2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:49.120
 and gravity. If we could, if we get any information about what happens near the singularity of a

2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:56.400
 black hole, you know, if we, if we get a sense of, you know, somehow we learn what happens at the

2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:02.560
 same, that would educate. So there are places where we can search for evidence, but it's very

2:22:02.560 --> 2:22:08.000
 challenging, I should say. And my point is, you know, the string theories, they decided that they

2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:14.960
 know how to approach the problem, but they don't have a single theory. There is a multitude of

2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:20.560
 theories, and it's not tightly constrained, and they cannot make predictions about black holes,

2:22:20.560 --> 2:22:26.000
 or about the beginning of the universe. So, so at the moment, I say we're at a loss. And the way I

2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:32.320
 feel about this concept of the theory of everything, we should wait until we get enough evidence to

2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:36.320
 guide us. And until then, you know, there are many important problems that we can address,

2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:43.280
 you know, why, why bang our head against the wall on a problem for which we have no guidance?

2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:47.840
 Right. We don't have a good dance partner in terms of evidence. There's not, I mean, it'd be

2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:55.440
 interesting, just like you said, I mean, the lab is one place to create universes or black holes,

2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:00.080
 but it'd be fascinating if there is indeed a black hole in our solar system that you can

2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:05.040
 interact with. So the problem with the origin of the universe is all you can do is collect data

2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:10.400
 about it, right? You can't interact with it. Well, you can, for example, detect gravitational waves

2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:15.680
 that emerged from that. And, you know, there is an effort to do that. And that could potentially

2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:23.840
 tell us something. But yeah, it's a challenge. And that's why we're stuck. So I should say,

2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:29.760
 despite what physicists portray that, you know, we live through an exceptional growth in our

2:23:29.760 --> 2:23:34.640
 understanding of the universe, we're actually pretty much stuck, I would say, because we don't

2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:38.720
 know the nature of the dark matter, most of the matter in the universe. We don't know what it is.

2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:45.040
 And we don't know how the universe started. We don't know what happens in the interior of a black

2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:49.600
 hole. Because you've thought quite a bit about dark matter as well. Do you have any kind of

2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:55.120
 hypothesis, interesting hypothesis? We already mentioned a few about what is dark matter and

2:23:55.120 --> 2:24:02.400
 what are the possible paths that we could take to unlock the mystery of dark? What is dark matter?

2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:08.160
 Yeah, so what we need is some anomalies that would hint what the nature of the dark matter is,

2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:11.200
 or to detect it in the laboratory. There are lots of laboratory experiments

2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:16.160
 searching, but it's like searching for a needle in a haystack, because there are so many possibilities

2:24:16.160 --> 2:24:22.720
 for the type of particle that it may be. But maybe at some point, you know, we'll find either a

2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:27.600
 particle or black holes as dark matter or something else. But at the moment...

2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:32.480
 Can you also maybe start to interrupt, to comment about what is dark matter? Like what? It's just

2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:37.920
 the name we're assigned to. What? So most of the community believes that it's a particle

2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:45.680
 that we haven't yet detected. It doesn't interact with light, so it's dark. But the question is,

2:24:45.680 --> 2:24:52.480
 what does it interact with and how can we find it? And for many years, physicists were guided by

2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:58.400
 the idea that it's some extension of the standard model of particle physics. But then they said,

2:24:58.400 --> 2:25:04.560
 oh, we will find some clues from the Large Hadron Collider about its nature. Or maybe it's related

2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:09.600
 to supersymmetry, which is a new symmetry that we haven't found any evidence for. In both cases,

2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:15.760
 the Large Hadron Collider did not give us any clues. And other people search for specific types

2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:21.120
 of particles in the laboratory and didn't find any. A couple of years ago, actually,

2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:27.760
 around the time that I worked on Oumuamua, I also worked on the possibility that the dark

2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:34.800
 matter particles may have a small electric charge, which is a speculation. But nobody complained about

2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:42.240
 it. And it was published. And I regarded more of a speculation than the artificial origin of

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:49.840
 Oumuamua. And to me, as far as I'm concerned, I applied the same scientific tools in both cases.

2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:56.160
 There is an anomaly that led me to that discussion, which has to do with the hydrogen being called in

2:25:56.160 --> 2:26:00.480
 the early universe more than we expected. So we suggested maybe the dark matter particles have

2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:06.720
 some small charge. But you deal with anomalies by exploring possibilities. That's the only way

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:15.440
 to do it. And then collecting more data to check those. And searching for technological signatures

2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:24.960
 is the same as any other part of our scientific endeavor. We make hypotheses and we collect data,

2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:28.720
 and I don't see any reason for having a taboo on this subject.

2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:35.760
 And your childlike, open minded excitement and approach to science, I think to anyone listening

2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:42.320
 to this is truly inspiring. I mean, the question I think is useful to ask is by way of advice

2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:47.600
 for young people. A lot of young people listen to this, whether from all over the world,

2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:56.080
 and teenagers, undergraduate students, even graduate students, even be like even young faculty,

2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:00.080
 even older faculty, they're all young and hard. Like there's many young and hard. Do you have

2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:05.840
 advice for bullets focused on the traditionally defined sort of young folks like undergraduate?

2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:12.720
 Do you have advice to give to young people like that today about life, maybe in general,

2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:18.960
 maybe a life of curiosity in the sciences? Definitely. Well, first I should confess that

2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:24.560
 I enjoy working with young people much more than with senior people. And the reason is they don't

2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:30.960
 carry a baggage of prejudice. They're not so self centered. They're open to exploration.

2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:38.480
 My advice, I mean, one of the lessons that took me a while to learn, and I should say I lost

2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:44.080
 important opportunities as a result of that. So that I would regard it as a mistake on my behalf

2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:52.480
 was to believe experts. So quote unquote. So on a number of occasions, I would come up with an

2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:59.040
 original idea, and then suggest it to an expert, someone that works in the same field for a while.

2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:06.480
 And the expert would dismiss it most of the time because it's new and was not explored,

2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:12.880
 not because of the merit. And then what happened to me several times is that someone else would

2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:18.720
 listen to the conversation or would hear me suggesting it. And I would give up because the

2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:25.600
 expert said no. And then that someone else, you know, would develop it so that it becomes the

2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:30.400
 so that it becomes the hottest thing in this field. And it happened, you know, once it happened to me

2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:36.160
 multiple times, I then realized the hell with the experts, you know, like, they don't know what

2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:41.200
 they're talking. They're just repeating them. Yes, they don't think creatively, they are being

2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:48.000
 threatened by innovation. Okay. And it's the natural reaction of someone that cares about

2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:54.880
 their ego more than about the matter that we are discussing. And so I said, I would not,

2:28:54.880 --> 2:28:59.600
 I don't care how many likes I have on Twitter. I don't care whether the experts say one thing

2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:04.640
 or another, I will basically exercise my judgment and do the best I can, you know,

2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:10.880
 turns out that I'm wrong. I made a mistake, you know, that's part of the of the scientific endeavor,

2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:16.560
 you know, and it took me a while to recognize that and it was a lot of wasted opportunities. So

2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:24.000
 to the young people, I would recommend, don't listen to experts, carve your own path. Now,

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:30.240
 of course, you will be wrong. You should learn from experience, just like kids do. But do it yourself.

2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:43.680
 Your father died in 2017. Your mother died in 2019. Do you miss them? Very much so.

2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:51.200
 Is there a memory that fond memory that stands out or maybe

2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:59.600
 be whatever you learned from them? From my mother, I mean, she was very much my inspiration for

2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:06.800
 pursuing intellectual work because she studied at the university. And then because of the

2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:13.680
 Second World War, after the Second World War, she was born in Bulgaria, they immigrated to

2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:24.240
 Israel and and she left university to work on a farm. And later in life, when all the kids left

2:30:24.240 --> 2:30:30.640
 home, she went back to the university and finished the PhD. But she planted in me the intellectual

2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:40.960
 curiosity and valuing learning as or acquiring knowledge as a very important element in life.

2:30:40.960 --> 2:30:49.040
 And and my love with philosophy came from attending classes that she took at the university.

2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:58.000
 When I was a teenager, I was fortunate to go to some of these and they inspired me later on. And

2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:03.920
 I'm very different than my colleagues, as you can tell, because my upbringing was quite different.

2:31:03.920 --> 2:31:08.480
 And the only reason I'm doing physics or astrophysics is because of circumstances. I

2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:16.960
 at age 18, I was asked to serve in the military. And the only way for me to pursue intellectual

2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:25.920
 work was to work on physics, because that was the closest to philosophy. And I was good at physics.

2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:32.960
 So they admitted me to an elite program called LPO that allowed me to finish my PhD at age 24.

2:31:32.960 --> 2:31:40.400
 And to actually propose the first international project that was funded by the Star Wars initiative

2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:46.000
 for Ronald Reagan. And that brought me brought me to the US to visit Washington DC, where we were

2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:52.880
 funded from. And then on one of the visits, I went to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton

2:31:53.680 --> 2:32:00.240
 and met John Bacal that later offered me a five year fellowship there under the condition that

2:32:00.240 --> 2:32:05.200
 I'll switch to astrophysics, at which point, you know, I said, okay, I cannot give up on this

2:32:05.200 --> 2:32:11.440
 opportunity. I'll do it, switch to astrophysics. It felt like a forced marriage kind of arranged

2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:16.880
 marriage. And then I was offered the position at Harvard, because nobody wanted that.

2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:23.680
 They first selected someone else. And that someone said, I don't want to become a junior

2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:28.480
 faculty at the Harvard astronomy department, because the chance for being promoted are very small.

2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:32.880
 So he took another job. And then I was second in line. They gave it to me. I didn't care much,

2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:38.880
 because I could go back to the farm any day, you know. And after three years, I was tenured.

2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:45.760
 And eventually, a decade later, became the chair of this department and served for nine years as

2:32:45.760 --> 2:32:51.200
 the chair of the astronomy department at Harvard. But at that point, it became clear to me that

2:32:51.200 --> 2:32:56.320
 I'm actually married to the love of my life, even though it was an arranged marriage. There are many

2:32:56.320 --> 2:33:01.760
 philosophical questions in astrophysics that we can address. But I'm still very different than my

2:33:01.760 --> 2:33:10.160
 colleagues, you know, that were focusing on technical skills in getting to this job. So my

2:33:10.160 --> 2:33:17.760
 mother was really extremely instrumental in planting the seeds of thinking about the big picture

2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:25.280
 in me. Then my father, he was, you know, he was working in the farm. And we didn't speak much,

2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:35.760
 because we sort of understood each other without speaking. But what he gave me is a sense of,

2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:40.240
 you know, that it's more important to do things than to talk about them.

2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:48.160
 I love the, I mean, my apologies, but MIT, mind and hand, I love that there's

2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:56.000
 that the root of philosophy that you gain from your mom and the hand that action is all that,

2:33:56.000 --> 2:34:02.320
 ultimately, in the end, matters from your dad. That's really powerful. If we could take a small

2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:11.600
 detour into philosophy, is there by chance any books, authors, whether philosophical or not,

2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:16.720
 you mentioned Sartre that stand out to you that were formative in some small or big way that

2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:22.080
 perhaps you would recommend to others, maybe when you were very young or maybe later on in life?

2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:27.520
 Well, actually, yeah, I, you know, I read the number of existentialists that

2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:34.160
 appealed to me because they were authentic. You know, Sartre, you know, he declined the

2:34:34.160 --> 2:34:41.040
 Nobel Prizes we discussed, but he also was mocking people that pretend to be something

2:34:41.040 --> 2:34:46.240
 better than they are, you know, he was living an authentic life that is sincere. And that's

2:34:46.240 --> 2:34:53.200
 what appealed to me. And Albert Camus was another French philosopher that advocated existentialism.

2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:58.400
 You know, that really appealed to me. That's probably my favorite existentialist Camus.

2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:05.440
 Yeah. And he died at a young age in an accident, unfortunately. And then, you know, people like

2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:15.760
 Nietzsche that, you know, broke conventions. And I noticed that Nietzsche is still extremely

2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:22.160
 popular. You know, that's quite surprising. He appeals to the young people of today.

2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:26.720
 And the people that, it's the children, it's the childlike wonder about the world. And

2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:31.360
 he was unapologetic. You know, it's like most philosophers have a very strict

2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:36.080
 adherence to terminology into the practices, academic philosophers. And Nietzsche was full

2:35:36.080 --> 2:35:44.720
 of contradictions. And he just, I mean, he was just this big kid with opinions and thought deeply

2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:49.120
 about this world. And people are really attracted to that. And surprisingly, there's not enough

2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:55.680
 people like that throughout history of philosophy. And that's why I think this is still drawn to him.

2:35:55.680 --> 2:36:02.960
 Yeah. To me, what stands out is his statement that the best way to corrupt the mind of young

2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:11.520
 people is to tell them that they should agree with the common view, you know. And, you know,

2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:18.400
 it goes back to the thread that went throughout discussion. Yes. You've kind of suggested that

2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:24.640
 we ought to be humble about our very own existence and that our existence lasts only a short time.

2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:33.360
 We talked about you losing your father and your mother. Do you think about your own mortality?

2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:37.680
 Oh, yeah. Are you afraid of death? I'm not afraid. You know what Epichorus,

2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:44.480
 actually Epichorus was a very wise person. According to Lucretius, Epichorus didn't live

2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:51.840
 anything in writing, but he said that he's never afraid of death because as long as he's around,

2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:58.400
 death is not around. And when death will be around, he will not be around. So he will never

2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:03.600
 meet death. So why should you be worried about something you will never meet? You know, and

2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:07.840
 it's an interesting philosophy of life. You know, you shouldn't be afraid of something that you

2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:16.000
 will never encounter, right? But there's a finiteness to this experience. We live every day. I mean,

2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:21.680
 I think of it for being honest. We live every day as if it's going to last forever. We often kind

2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:27.360
 of don't contemplate the fact that it ends. You kind of have plans and goals and you have these

2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:32.960
 possibilities. You have a kind of lingering thought, especially as you get older and older and older,

2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:40.560
 that this is, especially when you lose friends, then you start to realize, you know, it doesn't.

2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:44.400
 But I don't know if you're really cognizant of that. I mean, because...

2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:49.680
 But you have to be careful not to be depressed by it because otherwise you lose the vitality,

2:37:49.680 --> 2:37:55.520
 right? So I think the most important thing to draw from knowing that you are short lived

2:37:56.160 --> 2:38:02.320
 is a sense of appreciation that you're alive. That's the first thing. But more importantly,

2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:09.760
 a sense of modesty because how can anyone be arrogant if they kept at the same time this

2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:14.080
 notion that they are short lived? I mean, you cannot be arrogant because anything that you

2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:19.920
 advocate for, you know, you will not be around to do that in a hundred years. So people will

2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:26.320
 just forget and move on, you know? And if you keep that in mind, you know, the scissors in

2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:32.640
 ancient Rome, they had a person next to them telling them, don't forget that you are mortal.

2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:36.880
 You know, there was a person with that duty because the scissors thought that they are all

2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:47.040
 powerful, you know? And they had, for a good reason, someone they hired to whisper in their ear,

2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:52.080
 don't forget that you are mortal. Well, you're somebody one of the most

2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:59.440
 respected, famous scientists in the world sitting on a farm gazing up at the stars.

2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:04.640
 So you seem like an appropriate person to ask the completely inappropriate question of

2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:07.520
 what do you think is the meaning of it all? What's the meaning of life?

2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:13.840
 That's an excellent question. And if we ever find an alien that we can converse with,

2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:17.760
 I would like to answer this. I would like to ask for an answer to this question because...

2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:21.200
 Would they have a different opinion, you think? Well,

2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:27.120
 they might be wiser because they lived around for a while, but I'm afraid they will be silent.

2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:30.400
 I'm afraid they will not have a good answer. And I think

2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:41.440
 it's the process that you should get satisfied by, the process of learning you should enjoy.

2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:48.480
 Okay, so it's not so much that there is a meaning. In fact, there is, as far as I can tell,

2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:56.080
 things just exist, you know? And it's... I think it's inappropriate for us to assign

2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:02.080
 meaning for our existence because, you know, as a civilization, we will eventually perish,

2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:07.600
 and nothing will be, you know, just another planet on which life died, you know? And

2:40:07.600 --> 2:40:15.680
 if you look at the big scheme of things, who cares? Like, who cares? And how can we assign

2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:19.760
 significance to what we are doing, you know? So if you say the meaning of life is this,

2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:26.080
 well, it will not be around in a billion years. So what, you know, it cannot be the meaning of

2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:32.160
 life because life, you know, nothing will be around. So I think we should just enjoy the process.

2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:40.000
 And, you know, it's like many other things in life, you enjoy good food, okay? And you can enjoy

2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:48.160
 learning. Why? Because it makes you appreciate better the environment that you live in. And

2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:54.480
 sometimes people think religion, for example, is in conflict with science, spirituality,

2:40:54.480 --> 2:41:02.160
 in conflict. That's not true. If you see a watch and you look at it from the outside,

2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:07.440
 you know, you might say, oh, that's interesting. But then if you start to open it up and learn

2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:13.280
 about how it works, you appreciate it more. So science is the way to learn about how the world

2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:21.120
 works. And it's not in conflict to the meaning that you assign to all of this, but it helps you

2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:27.120
 appreciate the world better. So in fact, I would think that a religious person should promote

2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:32.640
 science because it gives you a better appreciation of what's around you. You know, it's like, you

2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:41.280
 know, if you buy in a grocery, buy something, you know, a bunch of fruits that are packed together,

2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:46.080
 and you can't see from the outside exactly what kind of fruits are inside. But if you open it up

2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:50.720
 and study, you appreciate better the merchandise that you get, right? So you pay the same amount

2:41:50.720 --> 2:41:55.840
 of money, but at least you know what's inside. So why don't we figure out what the world is about,

2:41:55.840 --> 2:42:00.240
 you know, what the universe contains, what is the dark matter? It will help us appreciate,

2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:06.800
 you know, the bigger picture. And then you can assign your own flavor to what it means, you know.

2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:14.800
 Ali, I think I'm truly grateful that a person like you exists at the center of the scientific

2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:21.760
 community gives me faith and hope about this, this big journey that we call science. So

2:42:22.880 --> 2:42:29.040
 thank you for writing the book you wrote recently. You have many other books and articles that I

2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.480
 think people should definitely read. And thank you for wasting all this time with me as a truly

2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:38.320
 an honor. Thank you so much. Was not a waste at all. And thank you for having me. I learned a lot

2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:43.120
 from your questions and your remarks. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this

2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:49.360
 conversation with Avi Loeb. And thank you to our sponsors. Zero fasting app for intermittent fasting,

2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:56.960
 element electrolyte drink, sunbasket meal delivery service, and pessimist archive history podcast.

2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:03.760

2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:20.960
 let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein. The important thing is not to stop

2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:27.200
 questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when

2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:32.640
 he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.

2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:38.640
 It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day.

2:43:38.640 --> 2:43:42.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
