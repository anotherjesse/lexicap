00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and author

00:05.680 --> 00:10.960
 of The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, The God Delusion, The Magic of Reality,

00:10.960 --> 00:18.320
 and The Greatest Show of Earth and His Latest Allgrowing God. He is the originator and popularizer

00:18.320 --> 00:23.840
 of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including,

00:23.840 --> 00:29.840
 funny enough, the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene,

00:29.840 --> 00:34.800
 which, in the context of a gene centered view of evolution, is an exceptionally powerful idea.

00:35.520 --> 00:41.120
 He's outspoken, bold, and often fearless in the defense of science and reason,

00:41.120 --> 00:45.040
 and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.920
 This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic for everyone feeling the medical,

00:51.920 --> 00:57.520
 psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I'm sending love your way. Stay strong,

00:57.520 --> 01:03.280
 we're in this together, we'll beat this thing. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:03.280 --> 01:07.600
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 stars on Apple Podcast,

01:07.600 --> 01:13.760
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Freedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.320
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle

01:18.320 --> 01:22.560
 that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt

01:22.560 --> 01:28.880
 the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the

01:28.880 --> 01:35.040
 App Store. When you get it, use Colex Podcast. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy

01:35.040 --> 01:40.800
 Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App allows you to send

01:40.800 --> 01:46.480
 and receive money digitally, peer to peer, security in all digital transactions is very important.

01:46.480 --> 01:52.160
 Let me mention the PCI data security standard that Cash App is compliant with. I'm a big

01:52.160 --> 01:58.080
 fan of standards for safety and security. PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of

01:58.080 --> 02:03.040
 competitors got together and agreed that there needs to be a global standard around the security

02:03.040 --> 02:08.000
 of transactions. Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial

02:08.000 --> 02:13.280
 intelligence systems in general. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,

02:13.280 --> 02:19.360
 and use the code LEX Podcast, you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 the first,

02:19.360 --> 02:23.840
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people

02:23.840 --> 02:31.600
 around the world. And now here's my conversation with Richard Dawkins. Do you think there's

02:31.600 --> 02:38.000
 intelligent life out there in the universe? Well, if we accept there's intelligent life here and

02:38.000 --> 02:43.360
 we accept that the number of planets in the universe is gigantic. I mean, 10 to 22 stars has

02:43.360 --> 02:47.840
 been estimated. It seems to me highly likely that there is not only life in the universe

02:47.840 --> 02:53.840
 elsewhere, but also intelligent life. If you deny that, then you're committed to the view

02:53.840 --> 02:58.560
 that the things that happened on this planet are staggeringly improbable. I mean, ludicrously,

02:58.560 --> 03:04.160
 off the charts improbable. And I don't think it's that improbable. Certainly the origin of life

03:04.160 --> 03:09.040
 itself. There are really two steps, the origin of life, which is probably fairly improbable,

03:09.040 --> 03:13.760
 and then the subsequent evolution to intelligent life, which is also fairly improbable.

03:13.760 --> 03:19.280
 So the juxtaposition of those two, you could say, is pretty improbable, but not 10 to the 22

03:19.280 --> 03:23.760
 improbable. It's an interesting question, maybe you're coming onto it, how we would recognize

03:23.760 --> 03:29.360
 intelligence from outer space if we encountered it. The most likely way we would come across them

03:29.360 --> 03:36.640
 would be by radio. It's highly unlikely they'd ever visit us. But it's not it's not that unlikely

03:36.640 --> 03:42.000
 that we would pick up radio signals. And then we would have to have some means of deciding that

03:42.000 --> 03:48.720
 it was intelligent. People have people involved in the SETI program discuss how they would do it

03:48.720 --> 03:54.640
 and things like prime numbers would be an obvious thing to an obvious way for them to broadcast

03:54.640 --> 04:02.000
 to say we are intelligent, we are here. I suspect it probably would be obvious, actually.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.320
 That's interesting, prime numbers. So the mathematical patterns, it's an open question

04:06.320 --> 04:12.320
 whether mathematics is the same for us as it would be for aliens. I suppose we could assume

04:13.120 --> 04:18.160
 that ultimately if we're governed by the same laws of physics, and we should be governed by

04:18.160 --> 04:23.040
 the same laws of mathematics. I think so. I suspect that they will have Pythagoras theorem,

04:23.040 --> 04:26.240
 etc. I don't think that their mathematics will be that different.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.400
 Do you think evolution would also be a force on the alien planets as well?

04:30.400 --> 04:35.120
 I stuck my neck out and said that if we do, if ever that we do discover life elsewhere,

04:35.120 --> 04:41.600
 it will be Darwinian life in the sense that it will work by some kind of natural selection,

04:41.600 --> 04:48.880
 the non random survival of randomly generated codes. It doesn't mean that the genetic would

04:48.880 --> 04:53.520
 have to have some kind of genetics, but it doesn't have to be DNA genetics, probably wouldn't be

04:53.520 --> 04:56.880
 actually. But I think it would have to be Darwinian, yes.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.720
 So some kind of selection process?

04:59.760 --> 05:02.240
 Yes. In the general sense, it will be Darwinian.

05:03.200 --> 05:09.360
 So let me ask kind of an artificial intelligence engineering question. So you've been an outspoken

05:09.360 --> 05:14.880
 critic of I guess what could be called intelligent design, which is an attempt to describe the

05:14.880 --> 05:21.520
 creation of a human mind, a body by some religious folks that religious folks use to describe.

05:21.520 --> 05:26.000
 So broadly speaking, evolution is, as far as I know, again, you can correct me,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.760
 is the only scientific theory we have for the development of intelligent life.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.200
 Like there's no alternative theory as far as I understand.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.480
 None has ever been suggested, and I suspect it never will be.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.760
 Well, of course, whenever somebody says that 100 years later.

05:41.760 --> 05:48.880
 I know. It's a risk. But what a bet. I mean, I'm pretty confident.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.200
 But it would look, sorry, yes, it would probably look very similar, but it's almost like

05:53.200 --> 05:59.520
 Einstein's general relativity versus Newtonian physics. It'll be maybe an alteration of the

05:59.520 --> 06:02.720
 theory or something like that, but it won't be fundamentally different. But okay.

06:05.120 --> 06:11.040
 So now for the past 70 years, even before the AI community has been trying to engineer

06:11.040 --> 06:18.000
 intelligence in a sense to do what intelligent design says was done here on Earth.

06:18.640 --> 06:26.000
 What's your intuition? Do you think it's possible to build intelligence, to build computers that

06:26.000 --> 06:31.440
 are intelligent, or do we need to do something like the evolutionary process? There's no

06:31.440 --> 06:38.480
 shortcuts here. That's an interesting question. I'm committed to the belief that is ultimately

06:38.480 --> 06:44.320
 possible because I think there's nothing nonphysical in our brains. I think our brains work by the

06:44.320 --> 06:50.080
 laws of physics. And so it must, in principle, be possible to replicate that. In practice,

06:50.080 --> 06:54.800
 though, it might be very difficult. And as you suggest, it might, it may be the only way to do

06:54.800 --> 07:00.240
 it is by something like an evolutionary process. I'd be surprised. I suspect that it will come.

07:00.240 --> 07:05.520
 But it's certainly been slower incoming than some of the early pioneers thought.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.760
 Thought it would be, yeah. But in your sense, is the evolutionary process efficient?

07:10.320 --> 07:15.040
 So you can see it as exceptionally wasteful in one perspective. But at the same time,

07:15.040 --> 07:20.320
 maybe that is the only path. It's a paradox, isn't it? I mean, on the one side, it is deplorably

07:20.320 --> 07:26.400
 wasteful. It's fundamentally based on waste. On the other hand, it does produce magnificent

07:26.400 --> 07:37.680
 results. I mean, the design of a soaring bird, an albatross, a vulture, an eagle is superb.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.960
 An engineer would be proud to have done it. On the other hand, an engineer would not be proud

07:40.960 --> 07:46.400
 to have done some of the other things that evolution has served up. Some of the sort of

07:46.400 --> 07:51.440
 botched jobs that you can easily understand because of their historical origins, but they

07:51.440 --> 07:57.120
 don't look well designed. Do you have examples of bad design? My favorite example is the current

07:57.120 --> 08:01.600
 laryngeal nerve. I've used this many times. This is a nerve. It's one of the cranial nerves,

08:01.600 --> 08:07.760
 which goes from the brain. And the end organ that it supplies is the voice box, the larynx.

08:08.720 --> 08:13.200
 But it doesn't go straight to the larynx. It goes right into the chest and then loops around

08:14.000 --> 08:18.080
 an artery in the chest and then comes straight back up again to the larynx.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.360
 And I've assisted in the dissection of a giraffe's neck, which happened to have died in a zoo.

08:23.920 --> 08:29.920
 And we saw the recurrent laryngeal nerve going, whizzing straight past the larynx,

08:30.480 --> 08:33.840
 within an inch of the larynx, down into the chest and then back up again,

08:35.040 --> 08:42.480
 which is a detour of many feet, very, very inefficient. The reason is historical.

08:42.480 --> 08:50.160
 The ancestors are fish ancestors, the ancestors of all mammals and fish. The most direct

08:50.960 --> 08:55.600
 pathway of that, of the equivalent of that nerve, there wasn't a larynx in those days,

08:55.600 --> 09:03.920
 but it innovated one of the gills. The most direct pathway was behind that artery. And then when the

09:03.920 --> 09:08.720
 mammal, when the tetrapods, when the land vertebra started evolving and then the neck started to

09:08.720 --> 09:15.520
 stretch, the marginal cost of changing the embryological design to jump that nerve over the

09:15.520 --> 09:22.560
 artery was too great or rather was, was each step of the way was a very small cost, but the

09:22.560 --> 09:27.120
 marginal, but the cost of actually jumping it over would have been very large. As the neck

09:27.120 --> 09:32.240
 lengthened, it was a negligible change to just increase the length, the length of the detour,

09:32.240 --> 09:36.000
 tiny bit, a tiny bit, a tiny bit, each millimeter at a time didn't make any difference. And so,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.120
 but finally, when you get to a giraffe, it's a huge detour and no doubt is very inefficient. Now,

09:41.120 --> 09:48.080
 that's bad design. Any engineer would reject that piece of design. It's ridiculous. And there are

09:48.080 --> 09:53.200
 quite a number of examples, as you'd expect. It's not surprising that we find examples of that sort.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.480
 In a way, what's surprising is there aren't more of them. In a way, what's surprising

09:57.040 --> 10:01.680
 is that the design of living things is so good. So natural selection manages to achieve excellent

10:01.680 --> 10:11.760
 results partly by tinkering, partly by coming along and cleaning up initial mistakes. And as

10:11.760 --> 10:17.040
 it were, making the best of a bad job. That's really interesting. I mean, it is surprising and

10:17.040 --> 10:22.880
 beautiful. And it's a mystery from an engineering perspective that so many things are well designed.

10:22.880 --> 10:30.320
 I suppose the thing we're forgetting is how many generations have to die for that.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.360
 That's the inefficiency of it. Yes, that's the horrible wastefulness of it.

10:33.360 --> 10:38.240
 So yeah, we marvel at the final product. But yeah, the process is painful.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.880
 Elon Musk describes human beings as potentially what he calls the biological

10:44.880 --> 10:50.000
 bootloader for artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence as used as the

10:50.000 --> 10:56.640
 term is kind of like superintelligence. Do you see superhuman level intelligence as potentially

10:56.640 --> 11:01.680
 the next step in the evolutionary process? Yes, I think that if superhuman intelligence is to

11:01.680 --> 11:07.280
 be found, it will be artificial. I don't have any hope that we ourselves, our brains will go on

11:09.200 --> 11:16.560
 getting larger in ordinary biological evolution. I think that's probably come to an end. It is

11:16.560 --> 11:22.720
 the dominant trend or one of the dominant trends in our fossil history for the last two or three

11:22.720 --> 11:28.640
 million years. Brain size? Brain size, yes. So it's been swelling rather dramatically over the

11:28.640 --> 11:35.040
 last two or three million years. That is unlikely to continue. The only way that happens is because

11:35.040 --> 11:41.840
 natural selection favors those individuals with the biggest brains. And that's not happening anymore.

11:41.840 --> 11:48.400
 Right. So in general, humans, the selection pressures are not... I mean, are they active in

11:48.400 --> 11:55.600
 any form? Well, in order for them to be active, it would be necessary that the most... Let's

11:55.600 --> 12:01.840
 call it intelligence. Not that intelligence is simply correlated with brain size, but let's

12:01.840 --> 12:07.600
 talk about intelligence. In order for that to evolve, it's necessary that the most intelligent

12:07.600 --> 12:16.480
 beings have the most... Individuals have the most children. And so intelligence may buy you money,

12:16.480 --> 12:22.240
 it may buy you worldly success, it may buy you a nice house and a nice car and things like that,

12:22.240 --> 12:28.880
 if you successful career. It may buy you the admiration of your fellow people, but it doesn't

12:29.760 --> 12:32.960
 increase the number of offspring that you have. It doesn't increase your genetic

12:33.920 --> 12:40.320
 legacy to the next generation. On the other hand, artificial intelligence, I mean, computers and

12:40.320 --> 12:47.040
 technology generally is evolving by a non genetic means, by leaps and bounds, of course.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.360
 And so what do you think... I don't know if you're familiar, there's a company called Neuralink,

12:51.360 --> 12:57.840
 but there's a general effort of brain computer interfaces, which is to try to build a connection

12:57.840 --> 13:03.120
 between the computer and the brain, to send signals both directions. And the long term dream

13:03.120 --> 13:08.800
 there is to do exactly that, which is expand... I guess expand the size of the brain, expand

13:08.800 --> 13:16.080
 the capabilities of the brain. Do you see this as interesting? Do you see this as a promising

13:16.080 --> 13:20.960
 possible technology, or is the interface you see in the computer and the brain, like the brain is

13:20.960 --> 13:25.200
 this wet, messy thing that's just impossible to interface with? Well, of course, it's interesting,

13:25.200 --> 13:32.320
 whether it's promising, I'm really not qualified to say what I do find puzzling is that the brain

13:32.320 --> 13:38.480
 being as small as it is compared to a computer and the individual components being as slow as

13:38.480 --> 13:46.480
 they are compared to our electronic components, it is astonishing what it can do. I mean, imagine

13:46.480 --> 13:54.640
 building a computer that fits into the size of a human skull. And with the equivalent of

13:54.640 --> 14:03.520
 transistors or integrated circuits, which work as slowly as neurons do, it's something mysterious

14:03.520 --> 14:10.400
 about that. Something must be going on that we don't understand. So I've just talked to Roger

14:10.400 --> 14:18.880
 Penrose, I'm not sure if you're familiar with this work. He also describes this kind of mystery in

14:18.880 --> 14:26.720
 the mind, in the brain, that he sees a materialist. So there's no sort of mystical thing going on,

14:26.720 --> 14:30.320
 but there's so much about the material of the brain that we don't understand.

14:30.320 --> 14:36.320
 And that might be quantum mechanical and nature and so on. So there are the ideas about consciousness.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.320
 Have you ever thought about, do you ever think about ideas of consciousness or a little bit

14:42.320 --> 14:46.480
 more about the mystery of intelligence and consciousness that seems to pop up just like

14:46.480 --> 14:51.440
 you're saying from our brain? I agree with Roger Penrose that there is a mystery there.

14:54.720 --> 14:59.840
 He's one of the world's greatest physicists. I can't possibly argue with his...

14:59.840 --> 15:06.640
 But nobody knows anything about consciousness. And in fact, if we talk about religion and so on,

15:07.360 --> 15:13.840
 the mystery of consciousness is so awe inspiring and we know so little about it

15:13.840 --> 15:18.160
 that the leap to religious or mystical explanations is too easy to make.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.200
 I think that it's just an act of cowardice to leap to religious explanations and Roger

15:23.200 --> 15:30.480
 doesn't do that, of course. But I accept that there may be something that we don't understand about it.

15:31.120 --> 15:37.040
 So correct me if I'm wrong, but in your book Selfish Gene, the gene centered view of evolution

15:37.040 --> 15:42.320
 allows us to think of the physical organisms as just the medium through which the software

15:43.440 --> 15:52.240
 of our genetics and the ideas sort of propagate. So maybe can we start just with the basics?

15:52.240 --> 15:59.360
 What in this context does the word meme mean? It would mean the cultural equivalent of a

15:59.360 --> 16:04.640
 gene, cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays the same role as the gene in the

16:04.640 --> 16:11.040
 transmission of culture and the transmission of ideas in the broadest sense. And it's only a useful

16:11.040 --> 16:17.440
 word if there's something Darwinian going on. Obviously culture is transmitted, but is there

16:17.440 --> 16:22.800
 anything Darwinian going on? And if there is, that means there has to be something like a gene,

16:22.800 --> 16:29.520
 which becomes more numerous or less numerous in the population. So it can replicate?

16:29.520 --> 16:33.040
 It can replicate. Well, it clearly does replicate. There's no question about that.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.400
 The question is, does it replicate in a sort of differential way in a Darwinian fashion?

16:38.400 --> 16:42.800
 Could you say that certain ideas propagate because they're successful in the meme pool?

16:42.800 --> 16:50.400
 In a sort of trivial sense you can. Would you wish to say though that in the same way as a

16:51.040 --> 16:58.160
 animal body is modified, adapted to serve as a machine for propagating genes?

16:58.960 --> 17:03.040
 Is it also a machine for propagating memes? Could you actually say that something about the way a

17:03.040 --> 17:14.000
 human is, is modified, adapted for the function of meme propagation? That's such a fascinating

17:14.000 --> 17:19.520
 possibility if that's true. It's not just about the genes which seem somehow more

17:20.640 --> 17:28.240
 comprehensible. It's like these things of biology. The idea that culture or maybe ideas,

17:28.240 --> 17:35.760
 you can really broadly define it, operates under these mechanisms. Even morphology, even anatomy

17:37.520 --> 17:45.440
 does evolve by memetic means. I mean, things like hairstyles, styles of makeup, circumcision,

17:45.440 --> 17:51.200
 these things are actual changes in the body form, which are non genetic and which get

17:51.200 --> 17:59.280
 passed on from generation to generation or sideways like a virus in a quasi genetic way.

17:59.280 --> 18:05.760
 But the moment you start drifting away from the physical, it becomes interesting because the

18:05.760 --> 18:13.440
 space of ideas, ideologies, political systems. Of course, yes. So what's in your, what's your

18:13.440 --> 18:22.560
 sense? Are memes a metaphor more or are they really, is there something fundamental, almost

18:22.560 --> 18:27.200
 physical presence of memes? Well, I think they're a bit more than a metaphor. And I think that,

18:28.080 --> 18:33.200
 and I mentioned that physical bodily characteristics, which are a bit trivial in a way, but

18:33.840 --> 18:40.320
 when things like the propagation of religious ideas, both longitudinally down generations

18:40.320 --> 18:48.160
 and transversely as in a sort of epidemiology of ideas, when a charismatic preacher

18:49.280 --> 18:58.240
 converts people, that resembles viral transmission. Whereas the longitude

18:58.240 --> 19:05.440
 nor transmission from grandparent to parent to child, et cetera, is more like conventional

19:05.440 --> 19:11.600
 genetic transmission. That's such a beautiful, especially in the modern day idea. Do you think

19:11.600 --> 19:16.400
 about this implication in social networks where the propagation of ideas, the viral propagation

19:16.400 --> 19:24.320
 of ideas, enhance the new use of the word meme to describe? Well, the internet, of course, provides

19:25.120 --> 19:30.000
 extremely rapid method of transmission. And before, when I first coined the word,

19:30.000 --> 19:35.600
 the internet didn't exist. And so I was thinking that in terms of books, newspapers,

19:36.480 --> 19:42.720
 broader radio, television, that kind of thing, now an idea can just leap around the world

19:43.520 --> 19:54.080
 in all directions instantly. And so the internet provides a step change in the facility of propagation

19:54.080 --> 19:59.920
 of memes. How does that make you feel? Isn't it fascinating that sort of ideas, it's like you

19:59.920 --> 20:06.240
 have Galapagos Islands or something, is the 70s. And the internet allows all these species to just

20:06.240 --> 20:13.040
 like globalize. And in a matter of seconds, you can spread a message to millions of people.

20:13.040 --> 20:21.920
 And these ideas, these memes can breed, can evolve, can mutate, and there's a selection,

20:21.920 --> 20:27.200
 and there's like different, I guess, groups that have all like there's a dynamics that's fascinating

20:27.200 --> 20:33.280
 here. Do you think? Yes. Basically, do you think your work in this direction, while fundamentally

20:33.280 --> 20:39.040
 was focused on life on earth, do you think it should continue like to be taken further?

20:39.040 --> 20:44.160
 I do think it would probably be a good idea to think in a Darwinian way about this sort of thing.

20:45.200 --> 20:50.720
 We can mentionly think of the transmission of ideas from an evolutionary context as being

20:50.720 --> 20:59.200
 limited to, I mean, in our ancestors, people living in villages, living in small bands where

20:59.200 --> 21:03.760
 everybody knew each other and ideas could propagate within the village and they might hop

21:03.760 --> 21:10.000
 to a neighboring village occasionally and maybe even to a neighboring continent eventually.

21:10.000 --> 21:17.600
 And that was a slow process. Nowadays, villages are international. I mean, you have people,

21:17.600 --> 21:24.480
 it's been called echo chambers where people are in a sort of internet village where the other

21:24.480 --> 21:28.880
 members of the village may be geographically distributed all over the world, but they just

21:28.880 --> 21:34.160
 happen to be interested in the same things, use the same terminology, the same jargon,

21:34.160 --> 21:41.680
 have the same enthusiasm. So people like the Flat Earth Society, they don't all live in one place,

21:41.680 --> 21:44.960
 they find each other and they talk the same language to each other, they talk the same

21:44.960 --> 21:53.280
 nonsense to each other. But so this is a kind of distributed version of the primitive idea of

21:54.160 --> 21:58.400
 people living in villages and propagating their ideas in a local way.

21:58.400 --> 22:06.480
 Is there Darwinist parallel here? So is there an evolutionary purpose of villages or is that just

22:06.480 --> 22:11.760
 a... Oh, I wouldn't use a word like evolutionary purpose in that case, but villages or villages

22:11.760 --> 22:18.480
 will be something that just emerged. That's the way people happen to live. And in just the same

22:18.480 --> 22:24.960
 kind of way, the Flat Earth Society, societies of ideas emerge in the same kind of way in this

22:24.960 --> 22:31.280
 digital space. Yes, yes. Is there something interesting to say about the... I guess,

22:32.480 --> 22:40.320
 from a perspective of Darwin, could we fully interpret the dynamics of social interaction and

22:40.320 --> 22:48.560
 these social networks? Or are some much more complicated things need to be developed? What's

22:48.560 --> 22:55.200
 your sense? Well, a Darwinian selection idea would involve investigating which ideas spread

22:55.200 --> 23:02.720
 and which don't. So some ideas don't have the ability to spread. I mean, the Flat Earth,

23:02.720 --> 23:07.200
 the Flat Earthism, there are a few people believing it, but it's not going to spread

23:07.200 --> 23:13.440
 because it's obvious nonsense. But other ideas, even if they are wrong, can spread because they

23:14.800 --> 23:22.160
 are attractive in some sense. So the spreading and the selection in the Darwinian context

23:22.160 --> 23:26.960
 is just to be attractive in some sense. We don't have to define... It doesn't have to be

23:26.960 --> 23:32.080
 attractive in the way that animals attract each other. It could be attractive in some other way.

23:32.080 --> 23:38.480
 Yes. All that matters is all that is needed is that it should spread. And it doesn't have to be

23:38.480 --> 23:44.240
 true to spread. In truth, there's one criterion which might help an idea to spread. But there are

23:44.240 --> 23:50.480
 other criteria which might help it to spread. As you say, attraction in animals is not necessarily

23:50.480 --> 23:57.680
 valuable for survival. The famous peacock's tail doesn't help the peacock to survive. It helps it

23:57.680 --> 24:04.400
 to pass on its genes. Similarly, an idea which is actually rubbish but which people don't know is

24:04.400 --> 24:10.080
 rubbish and think is very attractive will spread in the same way as a peacock's genes spread.

24:10.080 --> 24:16.560
 There's a small side step. I remember reading somewhere, I think recently, that in some species

24:16.560 --> 24:23.120
 of birds, sort of the idea that beauty may have its own purpose and the idea that some

24:23.120 --> 24:32.160
 birds... I'm being ineliquent here, but there are some aspects of their feathers and so on

24:32.160 --> 24:37.600
 that serve no evolutionary purpose whatsoever. There's somebody making an argument that there

24:37.600 --> 24:44.960
 are some things about beauty that animals do that may be its own purpose. Does that ring a bell

24:44.960 --> 24:53.200
 for you? It sounds ridiculous. I think it's a rather distorted bell. Darwin, when he coined the

24:53.200 --> 25:03.600
 phrase sexual selection, didn't feel the need to suggest that what was attractive to females,

25:03.600 --> 25:08.080
 usually is male attractive females, that what females found attractive had to be useful. He

25:08.080 --> 25:13.120
 said it didn't have to be useful. It was enough that females found it attractive and so it could

25:13.120 --> 25:17.760
 be completely useless, probably was completely useless in the conventional sense, but was not

25:17.760 --> 25:23.040
 at all useless in the sense of passing on... Darwin didn't call them genes, but in a sense of reproducing.

25:24.400 --> 25:31.680
 Others, starting with Wallace, the co discoverer of natural selection, didn't like that idea and they

25:31.680 --> 25:38.400
 wanted sexually selected characteristics like peacock's tails to be in some sense useful.

25:38.400 --> 25:43.120
 It's a bit of a stretch to think of a peacock's tail as being useful, but in the sense of survival,

25:43.120 --> 25:50.400
 but others have run with that idea and have brought it up to date. There are two schools

25:50.400 --> 25:55.520
 of thought on sexual selection which are still active and about equally supported now. Those

25:55.520 --> 25:59.840
 who follow Darwin in thinking that it's just enough to say it's attractive and those who follow

25:59.840 --> 26:10.240
 Wallace and say that it has to be in some sense useful. Do you fall into one category or the

26:10.240 --> 26:14.000
 other? No, I'm open minded. I think they both could be correct in different cases.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.400
 I mean, they've both been made sophisticated in a mathematical sense, more so than when Darwin

26:20.400 --> 26:26.480
 and Wallace first started talking about it. I'm Russian, I romanticize things, so I prefer the

26:26.480 --> 26:35.680
 former where the beauty in itself is a powerful attraction, is a powerful force in evolution.

26:37.120 --> 26:43.200
 On religion, do you think there will ever be a time in our future where almost nobody

26:43.200 --> 26:49.200
 believes in God or God is not a part of the moral fabric of our society?

26:50.400 --> 26:54.960
 Yes, I do. I think it may happen after a very long time. I think it may take a long time for

26:54.960 --> 26:59.840
 that to happen. Do you think ultimately for everybody on earth, religion,

27:01.200 --> 27:06.720
 other forms of doctrine's ideas could do better job than what religion does?

27:07.680 --> 27:17.680
 Yes. I mean, following truth. Well, truth is a funny word and reason too.

27:17.680 --> 27:28.480
 It's a difficult idea now with truth on the internet and fake news and so on.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.760
 I suppose when you say reason, you mean the very basic sort of

27:33.200 --> 27:38.000
 inarguable conclusions of science versus which political system is better.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.640
 Yes, yes. I mean truth about the real world, which is ascertainable by not just by the

27:46.640 --> 27:52.080
 more rigorous methods of science but by just ordinary sensory observation.

27:52.640 --> 27:59.360
 So do you think there will ever be a time when we move past it? I guess another way to ask it,

27:59.360 --> 28:08.000
 are we hopelessly fundamentally tied to religion in the way our society functions?

28:09.040 --> 28:14.960
 Well, clearly all individuals are not hopelessly tied to it because many individuals don't believe.

28:14.960 --> 28:21.600
 You could mean something like society needs religion in order to function properly,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.680
 something like that. And some people have suggested that.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.120
 What's your intuition on that?

28:25.840 --> 28:33.600
 Well, I've read books on it and they're persuasive. I don't think they're that persuasive though.

28:33.600 --> 28:41.520
 I mean, some people suggested that society needs a sort of figurehead which can be a

28:41.520 --> 28:45.520
 non existent figurehead in order to function properly. I think there's something rather

28:45.520 --> 28:51.600
 patronizing about the idea that, well, you and I are intelligent enough not to believe in God,

28:51.600 --> 28:58.240
 but the plebs need it sort of thing. I think that's patronizing and I'd like to think that

28:58.240 --> 29:00.080
 that was not the right way to proceed.

29:01.120 --> 29:04.000
 But at the individual level, do you think there's some value

29:04.000 --> 29:13.680
 of spirituality? If I think sort of as a scientist, the amount of things we actually

29:13.680 --> 29:19.840
 know about our universe is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of what we could possibly know.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.600
 So just from everything, even the certainty we have about the laws of physics,

29:23.600 --> 29:27.600
 it seems to be that there's yet a huge amount to discover.

29:27.600 --> 29:34.320
 And therefore, we're sitting where 99.999% of things are just still shrouded in mystery. Do

29:34.320 --> 29:39.680
 you think there's a role in a kind of spiritual view of that, sort of a humbled spiritual?

29:39.680 --> 29:44.080
 I think it's right to be humble. I think it's right to admit that there's a lot we don't know,

29:44.080 --> 29:48.480
 a lot that we don't understand, a lot that we still need to work on. We're working on it.

29:49.040 --> 29:54.000
 What I don't think is that it helps to invoke supernatural explanations.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.520
 If our current scientific explanations aren't adequate to do the job,

29:59.520 --> 30:04.160
 then we need better ones. We need to work more. And of course, the history of science shows just

30:04.160 --> 30:10.000
 that, that as science goes on, problems get solved one after another. And the science advances,

30:10.000 --> 30:19.120
 the science gets better. But to invoke a non scientific, non physical explanation is simply

30:19.120 --> 30:23.120
 to lie down in a cowardly way and say, we can't solve it. So we're going to invoke magic.

30:23.120 --> 30:27.520
 Don't let's do that. Let's say we need better science. We need more science.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.480
 It may be that the science will never do it. It may be that we will never actually understand

30:32.480 --> 30:37.360
 everything. And that's okay. But let's keep working on it.

30:39.280 --> 30:43.520
 A challenging question there is, do you think science can lead us astray in terms of the

30:43.520 --> 30:50.640
 humbleness? So there's some aspect of science. Maybe it's the aspect of scientists and not science,

30:50.640 --> 31:00.000
 but of sort of a mix of ego and confidence that can lead us astray in terms of discovering the,

31:01.200 --> 31:05.120
 you know, some of the big open questions about the universe.

31:05.120 --> 31:09.600
 I think that's right. I mean, there are arrogant people in any walk of life and

31:09.600 --> 31:13.520
 scientists are no exception to that. And so there are arrogant scientists who think we've

31:13.520 --> 31:18.480
 solved everything. And of course, we haven't. So humility is a proper stance for a scientist.

31:18.480 --> 31:26.400
 I mean, it's a proper working stance because it encourages further work. But in a way to resort

31:26.400 --> 31:30.880
 to a supernatural explanation is a kind of arrogance because it's saying, well, we don't

31:30.880 --> 31:38.720
 understand it scientifically. Therefore, the non scientific religious supernatural explanation

31:38.720 --> 31:42.800
 must be the right one. That's arrogant. What is what is humble is to say, we don't know.

31:42.800 --> 31:48.800
 And we need to work further on it. So maybe if I could psychoanalyze you

31:48.800 --> 31:54.960
 for a second, you have at times been just slightly frustrated with people who have

31:55.600 --> 32:02.160
 supernatural, you know, have a supernatural. Has that changed over the years? Have you become,

32:02.160 --> 32:07.920
 like, how do people that kind of have seek supernatural explanations? How do you see

32:07.920 --> 32:15.280
 those people as human beings? Do you see them as dishonest? Do you see them as

32:17.040 --> 32:23.280
 sort of ignorant? Do you see them as, I don't know, like, how do you think of?

32:23.280 --> 32:29.120
 Certainly not dishonest. And I mean, obviously, many of them are perfectly nice people. So I don't

32:29.120 --> 32:35.920
 sort of despise them in that sense. I think it's often a misunderstanding that

32:35.920 --> 32:44.480
 that people will jump from the admission that we don't understand something. They will jump

32:44.480 --> 32:48.960
 straight to what they think of as an alternative explanation, which is the supernatural one,

32:48.960 --> 32:55.760
 which is not an alternative. It's a non explanation. Instead of jumping to the conclusion that

32:55.760 --> 32:59.840
 science needs more work, that we need to actually do some better, better science.

32:59.840 --> 33:08.880
 So I don't have, I mean, personal antipathy towards such people. I just think they're

33:09.520 --> 33:15.520
 misguided. So what about this really interesting space that I have trouble with? So religion,

33:15.520 --> 33:21.040
 I have a bit of grasp on, but there's large communities, like you said, Flat Earth community,

33:22.640 --> 33:28.800
 that I've recently, because I've made a few jokes about it, I saw that there's, I've noticed that

33:28.800 --> 33:35.600
 there's people that take it quite seriously. So there's this bigger world of conspiracy theorists,

33:36.560 --> 33:44.320
 which is a kind of, I mean, there's elements of it that are religious as well. But I think

33:44.320 --> 33:52.880
 they're also scientific. So the basic credo of a conspiracy theorist is to question everything,

33:52.880 --> 33:59.200
 which is also the credo of a good scientist, I would say. So what do you make of this?

33:59.200 --> 34:06.800
 Yes. I mean, I think it's probably too easy to say that by labeling something a conspiracy,

34:06.800 --> 34:11.760
 you therefore dismiss it. I mean, occasionally conspiracies are right. And so we shouldn't

34:11.760 --> 34:17.440
 dismiss conspiracy theories out of hand. We should examine them on their own merits. Flat

34:17.440 --> 34:23.680
 Earth is an obvious nonsense. We don't have to examine that much further. But I mean, there may

34:23.680 --> 34:29.600
 be other conspiracy theories which are actually right. So I've grew up in the Soviet Union. So

34:30.960 --> 34:36.880
 the space race was very influential for me on both sides of the coin. There's

34:36.880 --> 34:45.520
 conspiracy theory that we never went to the moon, right? And it's like, I can understand it. And

34:45.520 --> 34:51.120
 it's very difficult to rigorously scientifically show one way or the other. It's just you have to

34:51.120 --> 34:55.280
 use some of the human intuition about who would have to lie, who would have to work together.

34:55.280 --> 35:02.400
 And it's clear that very unlikely, good. Behind that is my general intuition that most people

35:02.400 --> 35:07.360
 in this world are good. You know, in order to really put together some conspiracy theories,

35:07.360 --> 35:13.200
 there has to be a large number of people working together and essentially being dishonest.

35:13.200 --> 35:18.720
 Yes, which is improbable. The sheer number who would have to be in on this conspiracy and

35:19.440 --> 35:22.880
 the sheer detail, the attention to detail they'd have had to have had and so on.

35:23.520 --> 35:29.120
 I'd also worry about the motive. And why would anyone want to suggest that it didn't happen?

35:29.120 --> 35:36.000
 What's the, why is it so hard to believe? I mean, the physics of it, the mathematics of it,

35:36.000 --> 35:42.080
 the idea of computing orbits and trajectories and things, it all works mathematically.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.600
 Why wouldn't you believe it? It's a psychology question because there's

35:45.600 --> 35:52.880
 something really pleasant about, you know, pointing out that the emperor has no clothes when

35:52.880 --> 35:58.480
 everybody, like, you know, thinking outside the box and coming up with a true answer where

35:58.480 --> 36:02.720
 everybody else is deluded. There's something, I mean, I have that for science, right?

36:02.720 --> 36:05.840
 You want to prove the entire scientific community wrong. That's the whole.

36:05.840 --> 36:12.320
 No, that's right. And of course, historically, lone geniuses have come out right sometimes,

36:12.320 --> 36:16.800
 but often people who think they're a lone genius much more often turn out not to.

36:17.520 --> 36:21.920
 So you have to judge each case on its merits. The mere fact that you're a maverick, the mere

36:21.920 --> 36:27.760
 fact that you're going against the current tide doesn't make you right. You've got to

36:27.760 --> 36:29.760
 show you're right by looking at the evidence.

36:29.760 --> 36:34.400
 So because you focus so much on religion and disassemble a lot of ideas there and

36:34.400 --> 36:41.760
 I just, I was wondering if you have ideas about conspiracy theory groups, because it's such a

36:41.760 --> 36:47.840
 problem even reaching into presidential politics and so on. It seems like it's a very large

36:47.840 --> 36:52.000
 communities that believe different kinds of conspiracy theories. Is there some connection

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
 there to your thinking on religion?

36:55.040 --> 37:02.000
 It is curious. It's an obvious, difficult thing. I don't understand why people believe

37:02.000 --> 37:07.600
 things that are clearly nonsense like, well, Flat Earth and also the conspiracy about not

37:07.600 --> 37:15.280
 landing on the moon or that the United States engineered 9.11, that kind of thing.

37:16.720 --> 37:20.240
 So it's not clearly nonsense. It's extremely unlikely.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.160
 Okay. It's extremely unlikely.

37:23.840 --> 37:27.520
 Religion is a bit different because it's passed down from generation to generation.

37:27.520 --> 37:32.400
 So many of the people who are religious got it from their parents, who got it from their

37:32.400 --> 37:37.760
 parents, who got it from their parents and childhood indoctrination is a very powerful force.

37:38.800 --> 37:47.360
 But these things like the 9.11 conspiracy theory, the Kennedy assassination conspiracy

37:47.360 --> 37:52.720
 theory, the man on the moon conspiracy theory, these are not childhood indoctrination. These are

37:52.720 --> 38:00.000
 presumably dreamed up by somebody who then tells somebody else, who then wants to believe it.

38:00.960 --> 38:08.160
 And I don't know why people are so eager to fall in line with some, just some person that they

38:08.160 --> 38:13.440
 happen to read or meet who spins some yarn. I can kind of understand why they believe

38:14.160 --> 38:19.600
 what their parents and teachers told them when they were very tiny and not capable of critical

38:19.600 --> 38:26.320
 thinking for themselves. So I sort of get why the great religions of the world like Catholicism and

38:26.320 --> 38:33.280
 Islam go on persisting. It's because of childhood indoctrination. But that's not true of Flat

38:33.280 --> 38:36.880
 Earthism. And sure enough, Flat Earthism is a very minority cult.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.840
 Way larger than I ever realized.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.640
 Well, yes, I know.

38:40.640 --> 38:44.800
 But so that's a really clean idea. And you've articulated that in your new book and the

38:44.800 --> 38:50.160
 Algorand God and in God Delusion is the early indoctrination. That's really interesting.

38:50.160 --> 38:59.440
 You can get away with a lot of out there ideas in terms of religious texts, if the age which you

38:59.440 --> 39:06.160
 convey those ideas at first is a young age. So indoctrination is sort of an essential element

39:06.160 --> 39:13.680
 of propagation of religion. So let me ask on the morality side, in the books that I mentioned,

39:13.680 --> 39:19.040
 God Delusion, Algorand God, you described that human beings don't need religion to be moral.

39:19.920 --> 39:27.920
 So from an engineering perspective, we want to engineer morality into AI systems. So in general,

39:27.920 --> 39:31.440
 where do you think morals come from in humans?

39:32.720 --> 39:40.560
 A very complicated and interesting question. It's clear to me that the moral standards,

39:40.560 --> 39:50.560
 the moral values of our civilization changes as the decades go by, certainly as the centuries

39:50.560 --> 40:00.240
 go by, even as the decades go by. And we in the 21st century are quite clearly labeled 21st century

40:00.240 --> 40:07.520
 people in terms of our moral values. There's a spread. I mean, some of us are a little bit more

40:07.520 --> 40:11.040
 ruthless, some of us more conservative, some of us more more liberal and so on.

40:12.560 --> 40:19.440
 But we all subscribe to pretty much the same views when you compare us with, say, 18th century,

40:19.440 --> 40:27.680
 17th century people, even 19th century, 20th century people. So we're much less racist,

40:27.680 --> 40:32.480
 we're much less sexist and so on, than we used to be. Some people are still racist and some are

40:32.480 --> 40:38.320
 still sexist. But the spread has shifted that the Gaussian distribution has moved and moves

40:39.040 --> 40:48.640
 steadily as the centuries go by. And that is the most powerful influence I can see on our

40:49.200 --> 40:56.320
 moral values. And that doesn't have anything to do with religion. I mean, the morals of the

40:56.320 --> 41:06.320
 Old Testament are Bronze Age models. They're deplorable. And they are to be understood in

41:06.320 --> 41:11.520
 terms of the people in the desert who made them up at the time. And so human sacrifice,

41:13.360 --> 41:19.200
 an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, petty revenge, killing people for breaking the Sabbath,

41:19.200 --> 41:26.720
 all that kind of thing, inconceivable now. So at some point, religious texts may have in part

41:26.720 --> 41:31.440
 reflected that Gaussian distribution at that time. I'm sure they did. I'm sure they always reflect

41:31.440 --> 41:39.120
 that, yes. And then now, but the sort of almost like the meme, as you describe it, of ideas moves

41:39.120 --> 41:44.800
 much faster than religious texts do, than your religion. Yeah. So basing your morals on religious

41:44.800 --> 41:52.240
 texts, which were written millennia ago, is not a great way to proceed. I think that's

41:52.240 --> 41:59.600
 pretty clear. So not only should we not get our morals from such texts, but we don't. We quite

41:59.600 --> 42:07.200
 clearly don't. If we did, then we'd be discriminating against women and we'd be racist, we'd be

42:07.200 --> 42:16.000
 be killing homosexuals and so on. So we don't and we shouldn't. Now, of course, it's possible to

42:17.680 --> 42:22.480
 use your 21st century standards of morality and you can look at the Bible and you can cherry pick

42:23.440 --> 42:28.800
 particular verses which conform to our modern morality. And you'll find that Jesus says

42:28.800 --> 42:36.560
 some pretty nice things, which is great. But you're using your 21st century morality to decide

42:36.560 --> 42:41.920
 which verses to pick, which verses to reject. And so why not cut out the middleman of the Bible

42:42.640 --> 42:49.920
 and go straight to the 21st century morality, which is where that comes from. It's a much

42:49.920 --> 42:56.400
 more complicated question. Why is it that morality, moral values change as the centuries go by?

42:56.400 --> 43:02.080
 They undoubtedly do. And it's a very interesting question to ask why. So it's another example

43:02.080 --> 43:09.600
 of cultural evolution just as technology progresses. So moral values progress for probably very

43:09.600 --> 43:14.320
 different reasons. But it's interesting if the direction in which that progress is happening

43:14.320 --> 43:19.120
 has some evolutionary value or if it's merely a drift that can go into any direction.

43:19.120 --> 43:23.280
 I'm not sure it's any direction and I'm not sure it's evolutionally valuable. What it is is

43:24.800 --> 43:29.280
 progressive in the sense that each step is a step in the same direction as the previous step.

43:29.280 --> 43:36.640
 So it becomes more gentle, more decent by modern standards, more liberal, less violent.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.840
 See, but more decent, I think you're using terms and interpreting everything

43:41.840 --> 43:47.360
 in the context of the 21st century, because Genghis Khan would probably say that this is

43:47.360 --> 43:52.160
 not more decent because we're now, you know, there's a lot of weak members of society that

43:52.160 --> 43:56.640
 we're not murdering. I was careful to say by the standards of the 21st century,

43:56.640 --> 44:02.160
 by our standards, if we with hindsight look back at history, what we see is a trend in

44:02.160 --> 44:09.760
 the direction towards us, towards our present values. So for us, we see progress, but it's

44:09.760 --> 44:15.440
 an open question whether that won't, you know, I don't see necessarily why we can never return

44:15.440 --> 44:23.760
 to Genghis Khan times. Well, we could. I suspect we won't, but if you look at the history of moral

44:23.760 --> 44:30.400
 values over the centuries, it is in a progressive, I use the word progressive, not in a value

44:30.400 --> 44:36.160
 judgment sense, in the sense of a transitive sense, each step is the same direction as the

44:36.160 --> 44:46.560
 previous step. So things like we don't derive entertainment from torturing cats. We don't

44:46.560 --> 44:52.480
 derive entertainment from like the Romans did in the Colosseum from that stage.

44:52.480 --> 44:59.840
 Or rather, or rather, we suppress the desire to get, I mean, to have, it's probably in us

44:59.840 --> 45:04.480
 somewhere. So there's a bunch of parts of our brain, one that probably, you know,

45:04.480 --> 45:10.720
 limbic system that wants certain pleasures. And that's, I mean, I wouldn't have said that,

45:10.720 --> 45:17.360
 but you're at liberty to think that. Well, no, there's a, there's a Dan Carlin of Hardcore History,

45:17.360 --> 45:21.920
 there's a really nice explanation of how we've enjoyed watching the torture of people,

45:21.920 --> 45:25.600
 the fighting of people, just the torture, the suffering of people throughout history

45:25.600 --> 45:32.320
 as entertainment until quite recently. And now everything we do with sports,

45:32.320 --> 45:38.080
 we're kind of channeling that feeling into something else. I mean, there's some dark aspects

45:38.080 --> 45:44.320
 of human nature that are underneath everything. And I do hope this like higher level software

45:44.320 --> 45:52.400
 we've built will keep us at bay. Yes. I'm also Jewish and have history with the Soviet Union

45:52.400 --> 45:58.720
 and the Holocaust. And I clearly remember that some of the darker aspects of human nature creeped

45:58.720 --> 46:04.080
 up there. They do. There have been, there have been steps backwards admittedly. And the Holocaust

46:04.080 --> 46:09.200
 is on this one. But if you take a broad view of history, it's in the same direction.

46:09.200 --> 46:16.160
 So Pamela McCordick in Machines Who Think has written that AI began with an ancient wish to

46:16.160 --> 46:23.120
 forge the gods. Do you see, it's a poetic description, I suppose, but do you see a connection

46:23.120 --> 46:30.160
 between our civilizations, historic desire to create gods, to create religions, and our modern

46:30.160 --> 46:37.200
 desire to create technology and intelligent technology? I suppose there's a link between

46:37.200 --> 46:49.440
 an ancient desire to explain a way of mystery and science, but artificial intelligence creating

46:49.440 --> 46:57.200
 gods, creating new gods. And I forget, I read somewhere a somewhat facetious paper which said

46:57.200 --> 47:02.640
 that we have a new god. It's called Google. And we pray to it and we worship it and we

47:02.640 --> 47:09.520
 ask its advice like an oracle and so on. That's fun. But you don't see that, you see that as a

47:09.520 --> 47:14.880
 fun statement, a facetious statement. You don't see that as a kind of truth of us creating things

47:14.880 --> 47:21.120
 that are more powerful than ourselves and natural. It has a kind of poetic resonance to it, which I

47:21.120 --> 47:29.840
 get. But I wouldn't have bothered to make the point myself put it that way. All right. So you

47:29.840 --> 47:34.240
 don't think AI will become a new religion and new gods like Google?

47:34.240 --> 47:42.320
 Well, yes. I mean, I can see that the future of intelligent machines or indeed intelligent aliens

47:42.320 --> 47:49.440
 from outer space might yield beings that we would regard as gods in the sense that they are so

47:49.440 --> 47:58.240
 superior to us that we might as well worship them. That's highly plausible, I think. But I see a very

47:58.240 --> 48:04.640
 fundamental distinction between a god who is simply defined as something very, very powerful and

48:04.640 --> 48:11.680
 intelligent on the one hand and a god who doesn't need explaining by a progressive step by step

48:11.680 --> 48:22.160
 process like evolution or like engineering design. So suppose we did meet an alien from outer space

48:22.160 --> 48:29.040
 who was marvelously, magnificently more intelligent than us and we would sort of worship it and for

48:29.040 --> 48:35.440
 that reason. Nevertheless, it would not be a god in the very important sense that it did not just

48:35.440 --> 48:43.600
 happen to be there like God is supposed to. It must have come about by a gradual step by step

48:43.600 --> 48:50.160
 incremental progressive process, presumably like Darwinian evolution. There's all the difference

48:50.160 --> 48:58.880
 all the difference in the world between those two. Intelligence, design comes into the universe late

48:58.880 --> 49:06.240
 as a product of a progressive evolutionary process or a progressive engineering design process.

49:06.240 --> 49:11.040
 So most of the work is done through this slow moving progress. Exactly.

49:11.040 --> 49:23.520
 Yeah. But there's still this desire to get answers to the why question. If the world

49:23.520 --> 49:26.800
 is a simulation, if we're living in a simulation that there's a programmer

49:27.840 --> 49:32.400
 like creature that we can ask questions of. Okay. Well, let's pursue the idea that we're

49:32.400 --> 49:37.520
 living in a simulation, which is not totally ridiculous, by the way. There we go.

49:37.520 --> 49:46.880
 Then you still need to explain the programmer. The programmer had to come into existence by some

49:47.600 --> 49:54.880
 even if we're in a simulation, the programmer must have evolved. Or if he's in a sort of

49:54.880 --> 50:02.240
 or she or she she's in a meta simulation, then the meta, meta programmer must have evolved by

50:02.240 --> 50:09.280
 by a gradual process. You can't escape that. Fundamentally, you've got to come back to a gradual

50:09.280 --> 50:15.040
 incremental process of explanation to start with. There's no shortcuts in this world.

50:17.280 --> 50:22.240
 But maybe to linger on that point about the simulation, do you think it's an interesting

50:23.040 --> 50:28.320
 basically talk to board the the heck out of everybody asking this question, but

50:28.320 --> 50:34.000
 whether you live in a simulation, do you think first, do you think we live in a simulation?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.560
 Second, do you think it's an interesting thought experiment?

50:37.200 --> 50:42.480
 It's certainly an interesting thought experiment. I first met it in a science fiction novel by

50:43.200 --> 50:54.000
 Daniel Galloy, called Counterfeit World, in which it's all about our heroes are running

50:54.000 --> 51:00.560
 a gigantic computer which which simulates the world. And something goes wrong. And so one of

51:00.560 --> 51:05.760
 them has to go down into the simulated world in order to fix it. And then the the the denouement

51:05.760 --> 51:10.320
 of the thing, the climax of the novel is that they discover that they themselves are in another

51:10.320 --> 51:16.960
 simulation at a high level. So I was intrigued by this. And I love others of Daniel Galloy's

51:16.960 --> 51:24.720
 science fiction novels. Then it was revived seriously by Nick Bostrom. Bostrom talking to him in an

51:24.720 --> 51:32.480
 hour. Okay. And he goes further, not just treat it as a science fiction speculation, he actually

51:32.480 --> 51:38.000
 thinks it's positively likely. I mean, I think it's very likely, actually. Well, he's he makes

51:38.000 --> 51:42.720
 like a probabilistic argument, which you can use to come up with very interesting conclusions about

51:42.720 --> 51:49.040
 the nature of this universe. I mean, he thinks that that that we're in a simulation done by,

51:49.680 --> 51:54.720
 so to speak, our descendants of the future that the products. But it's still a product of evolution.

51:54.720 --> 51:59.760
 It's still ultimately going to be a product of evolution, even though the super intelligent

52:00.480 --> 52:06.640
 people of the future have created our world. And you and I are just a simulation and this

52:06.640 --> 52:14.640
 table is a simulation and so on. I don't actually, in my heart of hearts believe it, but I like his

52:14.640 --> 52:21.040
 argument. Well, so the interesting thing is that I agree with you. But the interesting thing to me,

52:21.040 --> 52:27.040
 if I would say if we're living in a simulation, that in that simulation to make it work, you still

52:27.040 --> 52:32.240
 have to do everything gradually, just like you said, that even though it's programmed, I don't think

52:32.240 --> 52:38.320
 there could be miracles. Otherwise, well, no, I mean, the programmer, the higher the upper ones

52:38.320 --> 52:42.880
 have to have evolved gradually. However, the simulation they create could be instantaneous.

52:42.880 --> 52:47.440
 I mean, it could be switched on and we come into the world with fabricated memories.

52:48.080 --> 52:52.960
 True. But what I'm what I'm trying to convey, so you're saying the broader statement, but I'm

52:52.960 --> 52:59.200
 saying from an engineering perspective, both the programmer has to be slowly evolved and the

52:59.200 --> 53:04.480
 simulation because it's like from an engineering perspective, it takes a long time to write a

53:04.480 --> 53:11.280
 program. No, like just I don't think you can create the universe in a snap. I think you have to grow

53:11.280 --> 53:20.960
 it. Okay, well, that's a good point. That's an arguable point. By the way, I have thought about

53:20.960 --> 53:28.480
 using the Nick Bostrom idea to solve the riddle of how we were talking earlier about why the

53:28.480 --> 53:35.360
 human brain can achieve so much. I thought of this when my then 100 year old mother

53:36.080 --> 53:40.480
 was marveling at what I could do with it with a smartphone. And I could, you know,

53:40.480 --> 53:44.560
 call look up anything and it's like the PDR, I could play her music that she liked and so on.

53:44.560 --> 53:50.400
 She says, all in that in that tiny little phone. No, it's out there. It's in the cloud. And maybe

53:50.400 --> 53:58.400
 what most of what we do is in a cloud. So maybe if we are a simulation, then all the power that

53:58.400 --> 54:03.040
 we think is in our skull, it actually may be like the power that we think is in the iPhone.

54:04.080 --> 54:08.400
 But is that actually out there in an interface to something else? I mean, that's what

54:10.480 --> 54:15.120
 including Roger Prenrose with panpsychism, that consciousness is somehow a fundamental

54:15.120 --> 54:20.560
 part of physics that it doesn't have to actually all reside inside. But Roger thinks it does reside

54:20.560 --> 54:26.880
 in the skull. Whereas I'm suggesting that it doesn't. That there's a cloud.

54:26.880 --> 54:35.360
 That'd be a fascinating, fascinating notion on a small tangent. Are you familiar with the work

54:35.360 --> 54:43.440
 of Donald Hoffman, I guess? Maybe not saying his name correctly, but just forget the name,

54:43.440 --> 54:51.040
 the idea that there's a difference between reality and perception. So like we biological

54:51.040 --> 54:55.520
 organisms perceive the world in order for the natural selection process to be able to survive

54:55.520 --> 55:01.120
 and so on. But that doesn't mean that our perception actually reflects the fundamental

55:01.840 --> 55:08.560
 reality, the physical reality underneath. Well, I do think that although it reflects the

55:08.560 --> 55:16.000
 fundamental reality, I do believe there is a fundamental reality. I do think that our perception

55:16.000 --> 55:25.760
 is constructive in the sense that we construct in our minds a model of what we're seeing. And this

55:25.760 --> 55:31.920
 is really the view of people who work on visual illusions like Richard Gregory, who point out

55:31.920 --> 55:38.480
 the things like a Necker cube, which flip from a two dimensional picture of a cube on

55:39.760 --> 55:45.120
 sheet of paper. We see it as a three dimensional cube, and it flips from one orientation to another.

55:45.120 --> 55:51.760
 At regular intervals. What's going on is that the brain is constructing a cube,

55:52.480 --> 55:57.920
 but the sense data are compatible with two alternative cubes. And so rather than stick

55:57.920 --> 56:04.000
 with one of them, it alternates between them. I think that's just a model for what we do all

56:04.000 --> 56:10.240
 the time when we see a table, when we see a person, when we see anything. We're using the

56:10.240 --> 56:18.160
 sense data to construct or make use of a perhaps previously constructed model. I noticed this

56:18.160 --> 56:26.960
 when I meet somebody who actually is say a friend of mine. But until I kind of realized that that

56:26.960 --> 56:34.160
 is him, he looks different. And then I finally clocked that it's him, his features switch

56:34.160 --> 56:39.920
 like a Necker cube into the familiar form. As it were, I've taken his face out of the

56:39.920 --> 56:48.400
 filing cabinet inside and grafted it onto or used the sense data to invoke it.

56:48.400 --> 56:53.520
 Yeah, we do some kind of miraculous compression on this whole thing to be able to filter most of

56:53.520 --> 56:59.520
 the sense data and make sense of it. That's just the magical thing that we do. So you've written

57:00.800 --> 57:09.200
 several many amazing books. But let me ask, what books, technical or fiction or philosophical,

57:09.200 --> 57:17.040
 had a big impact on your own life? What books would you recommend people consider reading in

57:17.040 --> 57:25.120
 their own intellectual journey? Darwin, of course. The original, I've actually

57:25.120 --> 57:31.360
 ashamed to say I've never read Darwin. He's astonishingly prescient because considering

57:31.360 --> 57:37.520
 he was writing the middle of the 19th century, Michael Gieselin said he's working 100 years

57:37.520 --> 57:45.040
 ahead of his time. Everything except genetics is amazingly right and amazingly far ahead of his time.

57:47.600 --> 57:54.560
 And of course, you need to read the the updates that have happened since his time as well.

57:54.560 --> 58:01.280
 I mean, he would be astonished by, well, let alone Watson and Crick of course,

58:01.280 --> 58:03.680
 but he'd be astonished by Mendelian genetics as well.

58:03.680 --> 58:07.920
 Yeah, if you're fascinated to see what he thought about, he would think about DNA.

58:07.920 --> 58:16.240
 Oh, I mean, yes, it would. Because in many ways, it clears up what appeared in his time to be a riddle.

58:17.440 --> 58:23.840
 The digital nature of genetics clears up what was a problem, what was a big problem.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.760
 Gosh, there's so much that I could think of. I can't really.

58:27.760 --> 58:35.040
 Is there something outside sort of more fiction? When you think young, was there books that just

58:35.040 --> 58:40.080
 kind of outside of kind of the realm of science and religion, they just kind of sparked your

58:40.640 --> 58:44.560
 Yes. Well, actually, I have, I suppose I could say that I've learned some

58:46.320 --> 58:54.640
 some science from science fiction. I mentioned Daniel Gallo and that's one example,

58:54.640 --> 59:00.240
 but another of his novels called Dark Universe, which is not terribly well known,

59:00.240 --> 59:05.360
 but it's a very, very nice science fiction story. It's about a world of perpetual darkness.

59:06.160 --> 59:09.520
 And we don't, we're not told at the beginning of the book why these people are in darkness.

59:09.520 --> 59:14.800
 They stumble around in some kind of underground world of caverns and passages,

59:15.520 --> 59:21.760
 using echolocation like bats and whales to get around. And they've adapted,

59:21.760 --> 59:27.760
 presumably by Darwinian means to survive in perpetual total darkness. But what's interesting

59:27.760 --> 59:36.000
 is that their mythology, their religion has echoes of Christianity, but it's based on light.

59:36.880 --> 59:43.920
 And so there's been a fall from a, from a, a paradise world that once existed where light

59:43.920 --> 59:51.600
 reigned supreme. And because of the sin of mankind, light banished them. So then they no

59:51.600 --> 59:57.440
 longer are in light's presence, but, but light survives in the form of mythology and in the

59:57.440 --> 1:00:01.680
 form of sayings like they're great light almighty over light's sake, don't do that.

1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:06.560
 And I, and I, I hear what you mean rather than I see what you, what you mean.

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:10.160
 So the, some of the same religious elements are present in this other totally kind of

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:15.440
 absurd different form. Yes. And so it's a wonderful, I wouldn't call it satire because

1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:21.600
 it's too good natured for that. I mean, a wonderful parable about Christianity and the

1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:27.840
 doctrine, the theological doctrine of the fall. So I find that, that kind of science fiction

1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:32.880
 immensely stimulating. Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud. Oh, by the way, anything by Arthur C.

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:37.520
 Clarke, I find very, very wonderful too. Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud,

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:47.840
 his first science fiction novel where he, well, I learned, I learned a lot of science from that.

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:53.040
 It has, it suffers from an obnoxious hero, unfortunately, but apart from that,

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:59.360
 you learn a lot of science from it. Another of his novels, Apha Andromeda,

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:04.960
 which by the way, the theme of that is taken up by Carl Sagan's science fiction novel,

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:15.600
 another wonderful writer, Carl Sagan Contact, where the idea is, again, we will not be visited from

1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:21.040
 outer space by physical bodies. We will be visited possibly, we might be visited by radio,

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:29.520
 but the radio signals could manipulate us and actually have a concrete influence on the world

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:37.840
 if they make us or persuade us to build a computer which runs their software so that they can then

1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:44.400
 transmit their software by radio. And then the computer takes over the world. And this is the

1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:50.720
 same theme in both Hoyle's book and Sagan's book, I presume, I don't know whether Sagan knew about

1:01:50.720 --> 1:02:02.320
 Hoyle's book, he probably did. And it's a clever idea that we will never be invaded by physical

1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:08.640
 bodies. The war of the worlds of HD worlds will never happen, but we could be invaded by radio

1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:17.840
 signals, code, coded information, which is sort of like DNA. And we are, I call them, we are

1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:25.200
 survival machines of our DNA. So it has great resonance for me because I think of us, I think

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:34.080
 of bodies, physical bodies, biological bodies as being manipulated by coded information in DNA

1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:39.360
 which has come down through generations. And in a space of memes, it doesn't have to be physical,

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:45.440
 it can be transmitted through the space of information. That's a fascinating possibility

1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:52.560
 that from outer space we can be infiltrated by other memes, by other ideas, and thereby controlled

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:59.360
 in that way. Let me ask the last, the silliest or maybe the most important question, what is the

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:05.280
 meaning of life? What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, meaning?

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:10.400
 From a scientific point of view, the meaning of life is the propagation of DNA, but that's not

1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:16.480
 what I feel. That's not the meaning of my life. So the meaning of my life is something which is

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:20.480
 probably different from yours and different from other people's, but we each make our own meaning.

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:27.360
 So we set up goals, we want to achieve, we want to write a book, we want to

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:34.480
 do whatever it is we do, write a quartet, we want to win a football match.

1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:40.960
 And these are short term goals, well, maybe even quite long term goals, which are set up by our

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:46.480
 brains, which have goal seeking machinery built into them. But what we feel, we don't feel

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:54.480
 motivated by the desire to pass on our DNA mostly. We have other goals, which can be very

1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:02.560
 moving, very important. They could even be called spiritual in some cases. We want to understand

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:08.800
 the real of the universe, we want to understand consciousness, we want to understand how the

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:16.480
 brain works. These are all noble goals. Some of them can be noble goals anyway. And they are

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:21.520
 a far cry from the fundamental biological goal, which is the propagation of DNA.

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:30.160
 But the machinery that enables us to set up these higher level goals is originally programmed into

1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:39.520
 us by natural selection of DNA. The propagation of DNA. But what do you make of this unfortunate

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:44.800
 fact that we are mortal? Do you ponder your mortality? Does it make you sad?

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:54.720
 I ponder it. It makes me sad that I shall have to leave and not see what's going to happen next.

1:04:54.720 --> 1:05:02.560
 If there's something frightening about mortality, apart from sort of missing, as I've said,

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:10.480
 something more deeply, darkly frightening, it's the idea of eternity. But eternity is only

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:15.840
 frightening if you're there. Eternity before we were born, billions of years before we were born,

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:22.000
 and we were effectively dead before we were born. As I think it was Mark Twain said, I was dead for

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.680
 billions of years before I was born and never suffered the smallest inconvenience.

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:32.720
 That's how it's going to be after we leave. So I think of it as really, eternity is a frightening

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:39.040
 prospect. And so the best way to spend it is under a general anesthetic, which is what it'll be.

1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:44.480

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:19.520
 We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because

1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:25.120
 they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place,

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:30.160
 but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia.

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:37.360
 Certainly, those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton.

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:45.120
 We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:53.840
 of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds, it is you and I in our ordinariness that

1:06:53.840 --> 1:07:01.680
 are here. We privileged few who won the lottery of birth against all odds. How dare we whine at

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:07.120
 our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred.

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:17.120
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
