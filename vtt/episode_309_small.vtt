00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
 I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters and he was slowly moving around and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.

00:06.960 --> 00:14.760
 It was all still keyboard. We didn't even have mice set up at that time, but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

00:14.760 --> 00:20.440
 The wall disappears in a little animation and there's a monster like right there and he practically fell out of his chair.

00:20.440 --> 00:26.820
 It was just like, ah! And games just didn't do that. You know, the games were the gods eye view.

00:26.820 --> 00:32.120
 You were a little invested in your little guy. You can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.320
 But you just did not get that kind of startle reaction. You weren't inside the game.

00:36.320 --> 00:42.320
 Something in the back of your brain, some reptile brain thing is just going, oh shit, something just happened.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.160
 And that was one of those early points where it's like, yeah, this is going to make a difference.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.960
 This is going to be powerful and it's going to matter.

00:49.960 --> 00:56.960
 The following is a conversation with John Carmack, widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers ever.

00:56.960 --> 01:06.960
 He was the cofounder of id Software and the lead programmer on several games that revolutionized the technology, the experience and the role of gaming in our society,

01:06.960 --> 01:12.960
 including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake.

01:12.960 --> 01:24.960
 He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR helping to create portals into virtual worlds and to define the technological path to the metaverse and meta.

01:24.960 --> 01:31.960
 And now he has been shifting some of his attention to the problem of artificial general intelligence.

01:31.960 --> 01:43.960
 This was the longest conversation on this podcast at over five hours and still I could talk to John many, many more times.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.960
 And we hope to do just that.

01:45.960 --> 01:51.960
 This is the Lexington podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:51.960 --> 01:56.960
 And now dear friends, here's John Carmack.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.960
 What was the first program you've ever written? Do you remember?

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
 Yeah, I do.

02:01.960 --> 02:11.960
 So I remember being in a radio shack going up to the TRS80 computers and learning just enough to be able to do 10 print John Carmack.

02:11.960 --> 02:22.960
 And it's kind of interesting how, of course, I've, you know, Carnigan and Richie kind of standardized Hello World is the first thing that you do in every computer programming language and every computer,

02:22.960 --> 02:27.960
 but not having any interaction with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.960
 It was just like, well, what am I going to say? I'm going to say my name.

02:30.960 --> 02:34.960
 And then you learn how to do go to 10 and have it scroll all off the screen.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.960
 And that was definitely the first thing that I wound up doing on a computer.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.960
 Can I ask you a programming advice?

02:40.960 --> 02:43.960
 I was always told in the beginning that you're not allowed to use go to statements.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.960
 That's really bad programming. Is this correct or not?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.960
 Jumping around code.

02:47.960 --> 02:55.960
 Can we look at the philosophy and the technical aspects of the go to statement that seems so convenient, but it's supposed to be programming.

02:55.960 --> 03:00.960
 Certainly back in the day in basic programming languages, you didn't have proper loops.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
 You didn't have four wiles and repeats.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.960
 You know, that was the land of Pascal for people that kind of generally had access to it back then.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.960
 So you had no choice but to use go tos.

03:09.960 --> 03:16.960
 And as you made what were big programs back then, which were a thousand line basic program is a really big program.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.960
 They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.960
 You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.960
 So you would wind up fixing things in one place at a little patch.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.960
 And there's reasons why structured programming generally helps understanding.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.960
 But go tos aren't poisonous.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.960
 Sometimes they're the right thing to do.

03:35.960 --> 03:49.960
 Usually it's because there's a language feature missing like nested breaks or something where it can sometimes be better to do a go to clean up or go to error rather than having multiple flags, multiple if statements littered throughout things.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.960
 But it is rare.

03:51.960 --> 03:58.960
 If you grep through all of my code right now, I don't think any of my current code bases would actually have a go to.

03:58.960 --> 04:06.960
 But deep within sort of the technical underpinnings of a major game engine, you're going to have some go tos in a couple places probably.

04:06.960 --> 04:15.960
 Yeah, the infrastructure on top of like the closer you get to machine code, the more go tos you're going to see, the more of these like hacks you're going to see.

04:15.960 --> 04:21.960
 Because the set of features available to you in low level programming languages is not is limited.

04:21.960 --> 04:25.960
 So print John Carmack.

04:25.960 --> 04:31.960
 When is the first time if we could talk about love that you found love with programming?

04:31.960 --> 04:34.960
 You said like this, this is really something special.

04:34.960 --> 04:42.960
 It really was something that was one of those love at first sight things where just really from the time that I understood what a computer was even.

04:42.960 --> 04:49.960
 I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias at the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes at the real to real tape decks.

04:49.960 --> 05:04.960
 And for people nowadays, it can be a little hard to understand what the world was like then from information gathering where I would go to the libraries and there would be a couple books on the shelf about computers and they would be very out of date even at that point.

05:04.960 --> 05:13.960
 Just not a lot of information, but I would grab everything that I could find and you know, devour everything whenever time or newsweek had some article about computers.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.960
 I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.

05:16.960 --> 05:23.960
 It just, it felt like this magical thing to me, this idea that the computer would just do exactly what you told it to.

05:23.960 --> 05:30.960
 I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw sort of issues there where you'd better be really, really careful with what you're telling it to do.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.960
 But it wasn't going to back talk you, it wasn't going to have a different point of view.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.960
 It was going to carry out what you told it to do.

05:36.960 --> 05:42.960
 And if you had the right commands, you could make it do these pretty magical things.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.960
 And so what kind of programs did you write at first?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.960
 So beyond the print John Carmack.

05:47.960 --> 06:01.960
 So I can remember as going through the learning process where you find at the start you're just learning how to do the most basic possible things and I can remember stuff like Superman comic that Radio Shack commissioned to have.

06:01.960 --> 06:11.960
 It's like Superman had lost some of his super brain and kids had to use Radio Shack TRS80 computers to do calculations for it to help him kind of complete his heroics.

06:11.960 --> 06:19.960
 And I'd find little things like that and then get a few basic books to be able to kind of work my way up.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.960
 And again, it was so precious back then.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.960
 I had a couple books that would teach me important things about it.

06:25.960 --> 06:33.960
 I had one book that I could start to learn a little bit of assembly language from and I'd have a few books on basic and some things that I could get from the libraries.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.960
 But my goals in the early days was almost always making games of various kinds.

06:39.960 --> 06:50.960
 I had I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games and being able to do some of those things myself on the computers was very much what I aspired to.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.960
 And it was a whole journey where if you learn normal basic, you can't do any kind of an action game.

06:55.960 --> 06:56.960
 You can write an adventure game.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.960
 You can write things where you say, what do you do here?

06:59.960 --> 07:05.960
 I get sort of tack troll that type of thing and that can be done in the context of basic.

07:05.960 --> 07:11.960
 But to do things that had moving graphics, there were only the most limited things you could possibly do.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.960
 You could maybe do breakout or Pong or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.

07:15.960 --> 07:24.960
 And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.960
 They had a they had a mode called low resolution graphics where of course all graphics were low resolution back then.

07:30.960 --> 07:38.960
 But you know, regular low resolution graphics, it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally, but they could have 16 different colors.

07:38.960 --> 07:44.960
 And I wanted to make a game kind of like the the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.960
 And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up and I could move a little ship around.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.960
 You could manage to do that in basic, but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.

07:52.960 --> 08:01.960
 And I remember at the time just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled,

08:01.960 --> 08:05.960
 where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen were basically the same thing.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.960
 And all those computers could scroll their text screen reasonably.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.960
 You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.

08:11.960 --> 08:18.960
 And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple of things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.960
 And I could draw graphics and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.

08:23.960 --> 08:29.960
 And then the system would scroll it all up using an assembly language routine that I didn't know how to write back then.

08:29.960 --> 08:36.960
 So that was like this first great hack that sort of had analogs later on in my career for a lot of different things.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
 So I found out that I could draw a screen.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.960
 I could do a line feed at the bottom.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
 We would scroll it up once.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.960
 I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.

08:43.960 --> 08:52.960
 And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen, which was interesting in that that played a big part later on in the id software days as well.

08:52.960 --> 09:03.960
 So do efficient drawing where you don't have to draw the whole screen, but you draw from the bottom using the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
 Yeah.

09:04.960 --> 09:15.960
 Where so much of until recently, game design was limited by what you could actually get the computer to do where it's easy to say, like, OK, I want to scroll the screen.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.960
 You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
 And nowadays that works just fine.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.960
 Computers are ludicrously fast.

09:23.960 --> 09:29.960
 But up until a decade ago or so, there were all these things everybody wanted to do.

09:29.960 --> 09:41.960
 But if they knew enough programming to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow to be a good experience, either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.

09:41.960 --> 09:50.960
 So so much of kind of the first couple of decades of the programming work that I did was largely figuring out how to do something that everybody knows how they want it to happen.

09:50.960 --> 09:57.960
 It just has to happen two to ten times faster than sort of the straightforward way of doing things would make it happen.

09:57.960 --> 10:05.960
 And it's different now because at this point, lots of things you can just do in the most naive possible way and it still works out.

10:05.960 --> 10:11.960
 You know, you don't have nearly the creative limitations or the incentives for optimizing on that level.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
 And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.

10:13.960 --> 10:22.960
 But I do generally, you know, I'm not going to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit where back in my day, programmers had to do real programming.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.960
 You know, it's it's amazing that you can just kind of pick an idea and go do it right now.

10:27.960 --> 10:34.960
 And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard or deep GPU Arcanist to be able to figure out how to make your wishes happen.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.960
 Well, there's still, see, that's true.

10:37.960 --> 10:49.960
 But let me put on my old man with a fist hat and say that probably the thing that will define the future still requires you to operate at the limits of the current system.

10:49.960 --> 11:07.960
 So we'll probably talk about this. But if you talk about building the metaverse and building a VR experience that's compelling, it probably requires you to not to go to assembly or maybe not literally, but sort of spiritually to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.

11:07.960 --> 11:18.960
 And that really was why virtual reality was specifically interesting to me where it had all the ties to you could say that even back in the early days, I have some old magazine articles that's talking about.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.960
 Doom as a virtual reality experience back when just seeing anything in 3D.

11:23.960 --> 11:28.960
 So you could say that we've been trying to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning.

11:28.960 --> 11:40.960
 And in the modern era, virtual reality, especially on the mobile side of things, when it's standalone, you're basically using a cell phone chip to be able to produce these very immersive experiences.

11:40.960 --> 11:52.960
 It does require work. It's not at the level of what an old school console game programmer would have operated at where you're looking at hardware registers and you're scheduling all the DNA accesses.

11:52.960 --> 12:00.960
 But it is still definitely a different level than what a web developer or or even a PC steam game developer usually has to work at.

12:00.960 --> 12:08.960
 And again, it's great. There's opportunities for people that want to operate it either into that spectrum there and still provide a lot of value to the world.

12:08.960 --> 12:14.960
 Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.

12:14.960 --> 12:24.960
 What would you say is the best programming language, your favorite, but also the best you've seen throughout your career.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.960
 You're considered by many to be the greatest programmer ever.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.960
 I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.960
 But if you put it on anyone, it's you.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.960
 So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions of what's the best band of all time.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.960
 But in your case, what's the best programming language?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.960
 Everything has all the caveats about it.

12:43.960 --> 12:51.960
 So what I use, so nowadays, I do program a reasonable amount of Python for AIML sorts of work.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.960
 I'm not a native Python programmer.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.960
 It's something I came to very late in my career.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.960
 I understand what it's good for.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.960
 But you don't dream in Python?

12:59.960 --> 13:00.960
 I do not.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.960
 And it has some of those things where there's some amazing stats.

13:03.960 --> 13:10.960
 When you say if you just start, if you make a loop, you know, a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,

13:10.960 --> 13:16.960
 you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower than a proper GPU tensor operation.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.960
 And these are staggering numbers.

13:18.960 --> 13:26.960
 You know, you can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.960
 So your intuition is about inefficiencies within the Python sort of.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.960
 It keeps hitting me upside the face where it's just gotten to the point now I understand.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.960
 It's like, OK, you just can't do a loop if you care about performance in Python.

13:37.960 --> 13:46.960
 You have to figure out how you can reformat this into some big vector operation or something that's going to be done completely within a C++ library.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.960
 But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient.

13:49.960 --> 13:54.960
 And you just see stuff that people are able to cobble together by just import a few different things.

13:54.960 --> 14:01.960
 And you can do stuff that nobody on Earth could do 10 years ago and you can do it in a little cookbook thing that you copy pasted out of a website.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.960
 So that is really great.

14:03.960 --> 14:09.960
 When I'm sitting down to do what I consider kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.

14:09.960 --> 14:17.960
 And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that where I'm not big into the modern template metaprogramming sorts of things.

14:17.960 --> 14:22.960
 I see a lot of train wrecks coming from some of that over abstraction.

14:22.960 --> 14:32.960
 I spent a few years really going kind of deep into the kind of historical Lisp work and Haskell and some of the functional programming sides of things.

14:32.960 --> 14:37.960
 And there is a lot of value there in the way you think about things.

14:37.960 --> 14:49.960
 And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code based on what I learned about the value that comes out of not having this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of.

14:49.960 --> 14:57.960
 Because something that many people don't really appreciate till they've been at it for a long time is that it's not the writing of the program initially.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.960
 It's the whole lifespan of the program.

14:59.960 --> 15:08.960
 And that's when it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates, but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change.

15:08.960 --> 15:23.960
 And then the thing that I've really been learning in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is it's also how well it hands off between a continuous kind of revolving door programmers taking over maintenance and different things and how you get people up to speed in different areas.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.960
 And there's all these other different aspects of it.

15:26.960 --> 15:31.960
 So C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
 Probably not the best.

15:33.960 --> 15:52.960
 And there's some really interesting aspects to this where in some cases languages that are not generally thought well of for many reasons like C is derided pretty broadly that, yes, obviously all of these security flaws that happen with the memory and unsafeness and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there.

15:52.960 --> 16:07.960
 But there is this underappreciated aspect to the language is so simple, anyone can go and if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace and not have to learn what paradigms they're using because there just aren't that many available.

16:07.960 --> 16:11.960
 I think there's some really, really well written C code.

16:11.960 --> 16:20.960
 I find it great that if I'm messing around with something an open BSD say, I mean I can be walking around in the kernel and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.

16:20.960 --> 16:28.960
 It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do to make whatever change that I need to.

16:28.960 --> 16:36.960
 While you can have more significant languages like it's a downside of Lisp where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.960
 I think that it did help my thinking about programming in some ways.

16:41.960 --> 16:56.960
 But the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is that if you write a huge Lisp program, you've basically invented your own kind of language and structure because it's not the primitives of the language you're using very much.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.960
 It's all of the things you've built on top of that.

16:58.960 --> 17:06.960
 And then a language like Racket, kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions, it's essentially touted as a language for building other languages.

17:06.960 --> 17:26.960
 And I understand the value of that for a tiny little project, but the idea of that for one of these long term supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me where all of those abstractions that you're like, OK, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself on all of these things that we've built on top of that.

17:26.960 --> 17:37.960
 And it was interesting to see how when Google made go, a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like, wow, this is not a state of the art language. This language is just so simple and almost crude.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.960
 And you could see the programming language people just looking down at it.

17:41.960 --> 17:48.960
 But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying this is the good things about C. Everybody can just jump right in and use it.

17:48.960 --> 17:53.960
 You don't need to restructure your brain to write good code in it.

17:53.960 --> 17:58.960
 So I wish that I had more opportunity for doing some work in go.

17:58.960 --> 18:03.960
 Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about that I'm not fit past judgment on.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.960
 I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.960
 I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust just as an exercise.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.960
 But that was a few years ago and I haven't really used it since.

18:14.960 --> 18:24.960
 The best programming language is the one that works generally that you're currently using because that's another trap is in almost every case I've seen when people mixed languages on a project.

18:24.960 --> 18:25.960
 That's a mistake.

18:25.960 --> 18:30.960
 I would rather stay just in one language so that everybody can work across the entire thing.

18:30.960 --> 18:35.960
 And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects that use kind of react framework.

18:35.960 --> 18:40.960
 So you've got JavaScript here and then you have C++ for real work.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.960
 And then you may have Java interfacing with some other part of the Android system.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.960
 And those are all kind of horrible things.

18:46.960 --> 18:58.960
 And that was one thing that I remember talking with Boz at Facebook about it where like, man, I wish we could have just said we're only hiring C++ programmers.

18:58.960 --> 19:07.960
 And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective, well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough with the thousands of programmers they've got there.

19:07.960 --> 19:14.960
 It is not necessarily a dying breed, but you can sure find a lot more Java or JavaScript programmers.

19:14.960 --> 19:20.960
 And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.

19:20.960 --> 19:27.960
 It's like, well, you just, you go out and you find those programmers and you don't hire the other programmers that don't do the languages that you want to use.

19:27.960 --> 19:36.960
 But right now, I guess, yeah, they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work for the UI side of things when you go find UI programmers, they're JavaScript programmers.

19:36.960 --> 19:44.960
 I wonder if that's because there's a lot of JavaScript programmers, because I do think that great programmers are rare.

19:44.960 --> 19:55.960
 That it's not, you know, if you just look at statistics of how many people are using different programming languages, that doesn't tell you the story of what the great programmers are using.

19:55.960 --> 20:00.960
 And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to, which is the fundamentals of a language.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
 What does it encourage?

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
 How does it encourage you to think?

20:02.960 --> 20:05.960
 What kind of systems does it encourage you to build?

20:05.960 --> 20:14.960
 There's something about C++ that has elements of creativity, but forces you to be an adult about your programming.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.960
 Well, it expects you to be an adult.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
 It does not force you to.

20:18.960 --> 20:38.960
 So it brings out people that are willing to be creative in terms of building large systems and coming up with interesting solutions, but at the same time have the sort of the good software engineering practices that amend themselves to real world systems.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.960
 Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.

20:42.960 --> 20:54.960
 So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years and humans are long gone, something tells me that most of the systems they find will be running JavaScript.

20:54.960 --> 21:00.960
 I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation, it's written in JavaScript.

21:00.960 --> 21:12.960
 You know, for the longest time, even still, JavaScript didn't get any respect, and yet it runs so much of the world and an increasing number of the world.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.960
 Is it possible that all everything will be written in JavaScript one day?

21:16.960 --> 21:20.960
 So the engineering under JavaScript is really pretty phenomenal.

21:20.960 --> 21:29.960
 The systems that make JavaScript run as fast as it does right now are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways.

21:29.960 --> 21:44.960
 It does feel like it is not an optimal language for all the things that it's being used for or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps in something like this without type systems and so on.

21:44.960 --> 21:49.960
 But I think for a lot of people, it does reasonably the necessary things.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.960
 It's still a C flavored language.

21:51.960 --> 22:01.960
 It's still a braces and semicolon language. It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript and then understand the roots of where it came from.

22:01.960 --> 22:08.960
 I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing for most programs to be written in.

22:08.960 --> 22:18.960
 It's funny that I still, just this morning, I was on, I was seeing a Twitter thread of a bunch of really senior game dev people arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.

22:18.960 --> 22:23.960
 You will run into some people that are top notch programmers that just say, no, this is literally not a good thing.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.960
 Oh, because it makes you lazy?

22:25.960 --> 22:27.960
 Yes, that it makes you not think about things.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.960
 And I do disagree.

22:29.960 --> 22:39.960
 I think that there is so much objective data on the vulnerabilities that have happened in C and C++ programs, sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.

22:39.960 --> 22:43.960
 It's like nobody is good enough to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.960
 You write enough C code, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

22:46.960 --> 22:50.960
 And garbage collection is a very great thing for the vast majority of programs.

22:50.960 --> 22:59.960
 It's only when you get into the tightest of real time things that you start saying it's like, no, the garbage collection has more costs than it has benefits for me there.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.960
 But that's not 99 plus percent of all the software in the world.

23:03.960 --> 23:08.960
 So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.

23:08.960 --> 23:23.960
 And so much of programming is not the language itself, it's the infrastructure that surrounds it, all the libraries that you can get and the different ways you can deploy it, the portability that it gives you.

23:23.960 --> 23:35.960
 And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it, the web stack about everything that has to go when you do something really trivial in JavaScript

23:35.960 --> 23:46.960
 and it shows up on a web browser to kind of x ray through that and see everything that has to happen for your one little JavaScript statement to turn into something visible in your web browser.

23:46.960 --> 23:58.960
 It's very, very disquieting, just the depth of that stack and the fact that so few people can even comprehend all of the levels that are going on there.

23:58.960 --> 24:07.960
 But it's again, I have to caution myself to not be the in the good old days old man about it because clearly there's enormous value here.

24:07.960 --> 24:13.960
 The world does run on JavaScript to a pretty good approximation there and it's not falling apart.

24:13.960 --> 24:23.960
 There's a bunch of scary stuff where you look at console logs and you just see all of these bad things that are happening, but it's still kind of limping along and nobody really notices.

24:23.960 --> 24:29.960
 But so much of my systems design and systems analysis goes around.

24:29.960 --> 24:34.960
 You should understand what the speed of light is, like what would be the best you could possibly do here.

24:34.960 --> 24:44.960
 And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases, you can be a thousand times off your speed of light velocity for something and it's still be okay.

24:44.960 --> 25:00.960
 And in fact, it can even sometimes still be the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint where there's a lot of things that you don't want to have to parachute in someone like me to go in and say, make this this web page run a thousand times faster.

25:00.960 --> 25:10.960
 You know, make this web app into a hardcore native application that starts up in 37 milliseconds and everything responds in less than one frame latency.

25:10.960 --> 25:26.960
 That's just not necessary. And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars to do software like that when they can take somebody right out of a boot camp and say spin up an application for this, often being efficient is not really the best metric.

25:26.960 --> 25:41.960
 And it's like there's that applies in a lot of areas where it's kind of interesting how a lot of our appliances and everything are all built around energy efficiency, sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways or higher costs in other ways where there's

25:41.960 --> 25:55.960
 interesting things where energy or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world and that could change our engineering tradeoffs for the way we build certain things where you could throw away efficiency and actually get more benefits that actually matter.

25:55.960 --> 26:03.960
 That's one of my, you know, I one of the directions I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy when I was kind of like, what do I want to do next?

26:03.960 --> 26:17.960
 It was either going to be cost effective nuclear fission or artificial general intelligence. And one of the one of my pet ideas there is like, you know, people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is.

26:17.960 --> 26:30.960
 And there would be ways that you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less. But if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper, that could be a radical innovation and something like that.

26:30.960 --> 26:41.960
 So there's like some of these thoughts around like direct fission energy conversion, fission fragment conversion that, you know, maybe you build something that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything, even if it winds up being less efficient.

26:41.960 --> 26:55.960
 So that applies a lot in programming where there's always it's always good to know what you could do if you really sat down and took it took it far because sometimes there's discontinuities like around user reaction times.

26:55.960 --> 27:07.960
 There are some points where the difference between operating in one second and 750 milliseconds, not that huge. You'll see it in web page statistics, but most of the usability stuff, not that great.

27:07.960 --> 27:18.960
 But if you get down to 50 milliseconds, then all of a sudden this just feels amazing, you know, it's just like doing your bidding instantly rather than you're giving it a command, twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.

27:18.960 --> 27:31.960
 So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard to get over some threshold. But there are there are broad basins in the value metric for lots of work where it just doesn't pay to even go that extra mile.

27:31.960 --> 27:41.960
 And they're craftsmen that, you know, they just don't want to buy that and more power to them. You know, if somebody just wants to say, no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work.

27:41.960 --> 27:48.960
 I'm never going to do something that's not as good as I could possibly make it. I respect that and sometimes I am that person.

27:48.960 --> 27:59.960
 But I try to focus more on the larger value picture and you do pick your battles and you deploy your resources in the play that's going to give you sort of the best user value in the end.

27:59.960 --> 28:13.960
 Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth as a kind of programming effort, it seems like efficiency isn't the thing that's being optimized for.

28:13.960 --> 28:27.960
 Like natural selection is very inefficient, but it kind of adapts and through the process of adaptations, building more and more complex systems that are more and more intelligent, the final result is kind of pretty interesting.

28:27.960 --> 28:35.960
 And so I think of JavaScript the same way. It's like this giant mess that, you know, things naturally die off if they don't work.

28:35.960 --> 28:47.960
 And if they become useful to people, they kind of naturally live and then you build this community, large community of people that are generating code and some code is sticky, some is not.

28:47.960 --> 29:02.960
 And nobody knows the inefficiencies or the efficiencies or the breaking points, like how reliable this code is and you kind of just run it, assume it works and then get unpleasantly surprised and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.

29:02.960 --> 29:12.960
 So that's a really good analogy and we can go a lot of places with that where in the earliest days of programming when you had finite, you could count the bytes that you had to work on this.

29:12.960 --> 29:22.960
 You had all the kind of hackers playing code golf to be one less instruction than the other person's multiply routine to kind of get through and it was so perfectly crafted.

29:22.960 --> 29:30.960
 It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program because there just were not that many. You couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways.

29:30.960 --> 29:41.960
 And in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work where again, if you did not have the resources to just say, well, we're going to do billions and billions of programmable weights here.

29:41.960 --> 29:46.960
 You have to turn it down into something that is symbolic and crafted like that.

29:46.960 --> 29:53.960
 But that's definitely not the way DNA and life and biological evolution and things work.

29:53.960 --> 29:59.960
 On the one hand, it's almost humbling how little programming code is in our bodies.

29:59.960 --> 30:07.960
 We've got a couple billion base pairs and it's like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.

30:07.960 --> 30:16.960
 You've got maybe 50 megabytes and this is not like Shannon Limit perfectly information dense conveyances here.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
 It's like these are messy codes.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.960
 They're broken up into amino acids.

30:20.960 --> 30:25.960
 A lot of them don't do important things or they do things in very awkward ways.

30:25.960 --> 30:32.960
 But it is this process of just accumulation on top of things and you need scale.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.960
 Both you need scale for the population for that to work out.

30:36.960 --> 30:47.960
 In the early days, in the 50s and 60s, the ancient era of computers where you could count when they say like when the Internet started even in the 70s, there were 18 hosts or something on it.

30:47.960 --> 30:53.960
 It was this small finite number and you were still optimizing everything to be as good as you possibly could be.

30:53.960 --> 30:58.960
 But now it's billions and billions of devices and everything going on.

30:58.960 --> 31:06.960
 You can have this very much natural evolution going on where lots of things are tried, lots of things are blowing up.

31:06.960 --> 31:13.960
 Venture capitalists lose their money when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack and things completely failed or failed the scale.

31:13.960 --> 31:21.960
 But good things do come out of it and it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution of the way different things happen.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.960
 Like mentioning Hello World at the beginning.

31:23.960 --> 31:37.960
 It's funny how some little thing like that where everybody, every programmer knows Hello World now and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C and early examples of things like that.

31:37.960 --> 31:49.960
 So millions of experiments are going on all the time, but some things do kind of rise to the top and win the fitness war for whether it's mind space or programming techniques or anything.

31:49.960 --> 32:00.960
 Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called CodeGolf where people compete to write the shortest possible program for a particular task in all the different kinds of languages.

32:00.960 --> 32:12.960
 And it's really interesting to see folks kind of their masters of their craft really play with the limits of programming languages.

32:12.960 --> 32:13.960
 It's really beautiful to see.

32:13.960 --> 32:21.960
 And across all the different programming languages, you get to see some of these weird programming languages and mainstream ones.

32:21.960 --> 32:29.960
 The difference between Python 2 and 3, you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java and you get to see JavaScript, all of that.

32:29.960 --> 32:42.960
 And it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth of possibility there is within programming languages that CodeGolf kind of tasks reveal.

32:42.960 --> 32:49.960
 Most of us, if you do any kind of programming, you kind of do boring kind of very vanilla type of code.

32:49.960 --> 32:56.960
 That's the way to build large systems, but it's nice to see that the possibility of creative genius is still within those languages.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.960
 It's laden within those languages.

32:59.960 --> 33:07.960
 So given that you are once again one of the greatest programmers ever, what do you think makes a good programmer?

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
 Maybe a good modern programmer.

33:09.960 --> 33:16.960
 So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta to the TPM organization.

33:16.960 --> 33:23.960
 And my biggest point was everything that we're doing really should flow from user value.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.960
 You know, all the good things that we're doing.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.960
 It's like we're not technical people.

33:27.960 --> 33:32.960
 It's like you shouldn't be taking pride just in the specific thing like CodeGolf is the sort of thing.

33:32.960 --> 33:37.960
 It's a fun puzzle game, but that really should not be a major motivator for you.

33:37.960 --> 33:41.960
 It's like we're solving problems for people or we're providing entertainment to people.

33:41.960 --> 33:45.960
 We're doing something of value to people that's displacing something else in their life.

33:45.960 --> 33:52.960
 So we want to be providing a net value over what they could be doing, but instead they're choosing to use our products.

33:52.960 --> 33:59.960
 And that's where, I mean, it sounds triter corny, but I fundamentally do think that's how you make the world a better place.

33:59.960 --> 34:06.960
 If you have given more value to people than it took you and your team to create, then the world's a better place.

34:06.960 --> 34:12.960
 People have gone from something of lesser value, chosen to use your product and their life feels better for that.

34:12.960 --> 34:17.960
 And if you've produced that economically, that's a really good thing.

34:17.960 --> 34:24.960
 On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money, you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into a woodchipper there

34:24.960 --> 34:28.960
 and you should maybe not feel so good about what you're doing.

34:28.960 --> 34:36.960
 So being proud about a specific architecture or a specific technology or a specific code sequence that you've done,

34:36.960 --> 34:40.960
 it's great to get a little smile, like a tiny little dopamine hit for that.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.960
 But the top level metric should be that you're building things of value.

34:44.960 --> 34:50.960
 Now, you can get into the argument about what is user value, how do you actually quantify that.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.960
 And there can be big arguments about that, but it's easy to be able to say,

34:54.960 --> 34:58.960
 okay, this pissed off user there is not getting value from what you're doing.

34:58.960 --> 35:03.960
 This user over there with the big smile on their face, the moment of delight when something happened,

35:03.960 --> 35:05.960
 there's a value that's happened there.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.960
 I mean, you have to at least accept that there is a concept of user value.

35:09.960 --> 35:14.960
 Even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it, you can usually make relative arguments about it.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
 Well, this was better than this.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.960
 We've improved things.

35:18.960 --> 35:24.960
 So being a servant to the user is your job when you're a developer.

35:24.960 --> 35:29.960
 You want to be producing something that other people are going to find valuable.

35:29.960 --> 35:35.960
 And if you are technically inclined, then finding the right levers to be able to pull,

35:35.960 --> 35:41.960
 to be able to make a design that's going to produce the most value for the least amount of effort.

35:41.960 --> 35:49.960
 There's a ratio there where it's a problem at the big tech companies, whether it's MetaGoogle,

35:49.960 --> 35:54.960
 Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, companies that have almost infinite money.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.960
 I mean, I know their CFO will complain that it's not infinite money,

35:58.960 --> 36:02.960
 but for most developer standpoints, it really does feel like it.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.960
 And it's almost counterintuitive that if you're working hard as a developer on something,

36:07.960 --> 36:13.960
 there's always this thought, if only I had more resources, more people, more RAM, more megahertz,

36:13.960 --> 36:15.960
 then my product will be better.

36:15.960 --> 36:21.960
 And that sense that at certain points, it's certainly true that if you are really hamstrung by this,

36:21.960 --> 36:26.960
 removing an obstacle will make a better product, make more value.

36:26.960 --> 36:32.960
 But if you're not making your core design decisions in this fiercely competitive way

36:32.960 --> 36:37.960
 where you're saying feature A or feature B, you can't just say, let's do both,

36:37.960 --> 36:40.960
 because then you're not making a value judgment about them.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.960
 You're just saying, well, they both seem good.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.960
 I don't want to necessarily have to pick out which one is better or how much better

36:46.960 --> 36:52.960
 and tell team B that, sorry, we're not going to do this because A is more important.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.960
 But that notion of always having to really critically value what you're doing,

36:57.960 --> 37:01.960
 your time, the resources you expend, even the opportunity cost of doing something else,

37:01.960 --> 37:04.960
 that's super important.

37:04.960 --> 37:11.960
 Well, let me ask you about the big debates that you're mentioning of how to measure value.

37:11.960 --> 37:18.960
 Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically,

37:18.960 --> 37:25.960
 or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route of imagining

37:25.960 --> 37:31.960
 sort of somebody using a thing and imagining a smile on their face,

37:31.960 --> 37:35.960
 imagining the experience of love and joy that you have when you use the thing.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.960
 That's from a design perspective.

37:37.960 --> 37:41.960
 Or if you're building more like a lower level thing for Linux,

37:41.960 --> 37:48.960
 you imagine a developer that might come across this and use it and become happy

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
 and better off because of it.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
 So where do you land on those things?

37:52.960 --> 37:58.960
 I imagine like Meta and Google will probably try to measure the thing.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.960
 It's like you try to optimize engagement or something.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.960
 Let's measure engagement.

38:03.960 --> 38:12.960
 I admire the designer ethic of think of a future that's immeasurable

38:12.960 --> 38:16.960
 and you try to make somebody in that future that's different from today happy.

38:16.960 --> 38:23.960
 So I do usually favor if you can get any kind of a metric that's good by all means

38:23.960 --> 38:27.960
 listen to the data, but you can go too far there where we've had problems where

38:27.960 --> 38:32.960
 it's like, hey, we had a performance regression because our fancy new telemetry system

38:32.960 --> 38:36.960
 is doing a bazillion file rights to kind of archive this stuff

38:36.960 --> 38:39.960
 because we needed to collect information to determine if we were doing,

38:39.960 --> 38:41.960
 you know, if our plans were good.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.960
 So when information is available, you should never ignore it.

38:45.960 --> 38:50.960
 For actual users using the thing, human beings using the thing,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.960
 large number of human beings, and you get to see sort of all the large numbers.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.960
 So there's zero to one problem of when you're doing something really new,

38:56.960 --> 38:58.960
 you do kind of have to make a guess.

38:58.960 --> 39:04.960
 But one of the points that I've been making at Meta is we have more than enough users now

39:04.960 --> 39:09.960
 that anything somebody wants to try in VR, we have users that will be interested in that.

39:09.960 --> 39:14.960
 You do not get to make a completely greenfield blue sky pitch and say,

39:14.960 --> 39:17.960
 I'm going to do this because I think it might be interesting.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
 I challenge everyone.

39:19.960 --> 39:23.960
 There are going to be people, whether it's, you know, working in VR on your,

39:23.960 --> 39:28.960
 like on your desktop replacement or communicating with people in different ways

39:28.960 --> 39:34.960
 or playing the games, there are going to be probably millions of people,

39:34.960 --> 39:37.960
 or at least if you pick some tiny niche that we're not in right now,

39:37.960 --> 39:41.960
 there's still going to be thousands of people out there that have the headsets

39:41.960 --> 39:43.960
 that would be your target market.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.960
 And I tell people, pay attention to them.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.960
 Don't invent fictional users.

39:47.960 --> 39:52.960
 Don't make an Alice Bob Charlie that fits whatever matrix of tendencies

39:52.960 --> 39:56.960
 that you want to break the market down to because it's a mistake to think about

39:56.960 --> 40:01.960
 imaginary users when you've got real users that you could be working with.

40:01.960 --> 40:08.960
 But on the other hand, there is value to having a kind of wholeness of vision for a product.

40:08.960 --> 40:14.960
 And companies like Meta have, you know, they understand the tradeoffs

40:14.960 --> 40:19.960
 where you can have a company like SpaceX or, you know, Apple and the Steve Jobs era

40:19.960 --> 40:23.960
 where you have a very powerful leading personality that I, you know,

40:23.960 --> 40:26.960
 that can micromanage at a very low level and can say it's like,

40:26.960 --> 40:31.960
 no, that handle needs to be different or that icon needs to change the tint there.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.960
 And they clearly get a lot of value out of it.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.960
 They also burn through a lot of employees that have horror stories to tell about

40:38.960 --> 40:40.960
 working there afterwards.

40:40.960 --> 40:45.960
 My position is that you're at your best when you've got a leader

40:45.960 --> 40:50.960
 that is at their limit of what they can kind of comprehend of everything below them

40:50.960 --> 40:54.960
 and they can have an informed opinion about everything that's going on.

40:54.960 --> 41:00.960
 And you take somebody, you've got to believe that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience,

41:00.960 --> 41:04.960
 you would hope that they've got wisdom that the just out of boot camp person

41:04.960 --> 41:08.960
 contributing doesn't have and that if they're like, well, that's wrong there,

41:08.960 --> 41:13.960
 you probably shouldn't do it that way or even just don't do it that way, do it another way.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.960
 So there's value there, but it can't go beyond a certain level.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.960
 I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him saying things that are just wrong

41:21.960 --> 41:27.960
 right in front of me about technical things because he was not operating at that level.

41:27.960 --> 41:31.960
 But when it does work and you do get that kind of passionate leader

41:31.960 --> 41:35.960
 that's thinking about the entire product and just really deeply cares about

41:35.960 --> 41:39.960
 not letting anything slip through the cracks, I think that's got a lot of value.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.960
 But the other side of that is the people saying that, well,

41:42.960 --> 41:45.960
 we want to have these independent teams that are bubbling up the ideas

41:45.960 --> 41:50.960
 because it's almost anti capitalist or anti free market to say it's like,

41:50.960 --> 41:54.960
 I want my great leader to go ahead and dictate all these points there

41:54.960 --> 41:58.960
 where clearly free markets bring up things that you don't expect.

41:58.960 --> 42:02.960
 Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things like it didn't turn out at all

42:02.960 --> 42:05.960
 the way the early people thought were going to be the key applications

42:05.960 --> 42:10.960
 and things that would not have been approved by the dark cabal

42:10.960 --> 42:13.960
 making the decisions about what gets into the store

42:13.960 --> 42:16.960
 turn out in some cases be extremely successful.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.960
 So I definitely kind of wanted to be there as a point where I did make a pitch.

42:21.960 --> 42:25.960
 It's like, hey, make me VR dictator and I'll go in and get shit done.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.960
 And that's just, it's not in the culture at Metta.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.960
 They understand the trade offs and that's just not the way,

42:32.960 --> 42:36.960
 that's not the company that they want, the team that they want to do.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.960
 It's fascinating because VR and we'll talk about it more.

42:39.960 --> 42:46.960
 It's still unclear to me in what way VR will change the world

42:46.960 --> 42:50.960
 because it does seem clear that VR will somehow fundamentally transform this world

42:50.960 --> 42:53.960
 and it's unclear to me how.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.960
 Let me know when you want to get into that.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
 Hold on a second.

42:58.960 --> 43:02.960
 Stick to the you being the best programmer ever.

43:02.960 --> 43:06.960
 Okay, in the early days when you didn't have adult responsibilities

43:06.960 --> 43:08.960
 of leading teams and all that kind of stuff

43:08.960 --> 43:12.960
 and you can focus on just being a programmer,

43:12.960 --> 43:17.960
 what did the productive day in the life of John Carmack look like?

43:17.960 --> 43:20.960
 How many hours of the keyboard? How much sleep?

43:20.960 --> 43:23.960
 What was the source of calories that fueled the brain?

43:23.960 --> 43:26.960
 What was it like? What time did you wake up?

43:26.960 --> 43:29.960
 So I was able to be remarkably consistent about

43:29.960 --> 43:33.960
 what was good working conditions for me for a very long time.

43:33.960 --> 43:39.960
 I was never one of the programmers that would do all nighters going through

43:39.960 --> 43:41.960
 work for 20 hours straight.

43:41.960 --> 43:46.960
 It's like my brain generally starts turning to mush after 12 hours or so.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.960
 But the hard work is really important

43:49.960 --> 43:51.960
 and I would work for decades.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.960
 I would work 60 hours a week.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.960
 I would work a 10 hour day, 6 days a week,

43:55.960 --> 43:58.960
 and try to be productive at that.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
 Now my schedule shifted around a fair amount

44:00.960 --> 44:02.960
 when I was young without any kids,

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
 any other responsibilities.

44:04.960 --> 44:06.960
 I was on one of those cycling schedules

44:06.960 --> 44:09.960
 where I'd kind of get in an hour later each day

44:09.960 --> 44:11.960
 and roll around through the entire time

44:11.960 --> 44:15.960
 and I'd wind up kind of pulling in at 2 or 3 in the afternoon sometimes

44:15.960 --> 44:19.960
 and then working again past midnight or 2 in the morning.

44:19.960 --> 44:25.960
 And that was when it was just me trying to make things happen.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.960
 And I was usually isolated off in my office.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.960
 People generally didn't bother me much at it

44:30.960 --> 44:34.960
 and I could get a lot of programming work done that way.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.960
 I did settle into a more normal schedule

44:36.960 --> 44:39.960
 when I was taking kids to school and things like that.

44:39.960 --> 44:43.960
 So kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up at the same time?

44:43.960 --> 44:46.960
 It's not clear to me that there was much of a difference

44:46.960 --> 44:50.960
 in the productivity with that where I kind of feel...

44:50.960 --> 44:52.960
 If I just get up when I feel like it,

44:52.960 --> 44:54.960
 it's usually a little later each day,

44:54.960 --> 44:57.960
 but I just recently made the focusing decision

44:57.960 --> 44:59.960
 to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier

44:59.960 --> 45:01.960
 to getting up at 8 in the morning

45:01.960 --> 45:04.960
 and trying to shift things around.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.960
 I'm often doing experiments with myself about

45:07.960 --> 45:10.960
 what should I be doing to be more productive.

45:10.960 --> 45:14.960
 And one of the things that I did realize was happening in recent months

45:14.960 --> 45:18.960
 where I would go for a walk or a run.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.960
 I cover like four miles a day

45:20.960 --> 45:25.960
 and I would usually do that just as the sun's going down here in Texas now

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
 and it's still really damn hot,

45:27.960 --> 45:29.960
 but I'd go out at 8.30 or something

45:29.960 --> 45:32.960
 and cover the time there and then the showering.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.960
 And it was putting a hold in my day

45:34.960 --> 45:37.960
 where I would have still a couple of hours after that

45:37.960 --> 45:39.960
 and sometimes my best hours were at night

45:39.960 --> 45:41.960
 and I'd be like, I don't know what else is around.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.960
 Nobody's bothering me,

45:43.960 --> 45:45.960
 but that hole in the day was a problem.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.960
 So just a couple of weeks ago,

45:47.960 --> 45:49.960
 I made the change to go ahead and say,

45:49.960 --> 45:51.960
 all right, I'm going to get up a little earlier.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.960
 I'm going to do a walk or get out there first

45:53.960 --> 45:55.960
 so I can have more uninterrupted time.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.960
 So I'm still playing with factors like this

45:57.960 --> 46:00.960
 as I kind of optimize my work efforts,

46:00.960 --> 46:03.960
 but it's always been...

46:03.960 --> 46:06.960
 It was 60 hours a week for a very long time.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.960
 To some degree, I had a little thing in the back of my head

46:08.960 --> 46:10.960
 where I would have a lot of programmers

46:10.960 --> 46:12.960
 that would do these marathon sessions.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.960
 And I had Dave Taylor, one of the guys that he had.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
 He would be one of those people

46:16.960 --> 46:18.960
 that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes

46:18.960 --> 46:20.960
 and all the kind of classic hacker tropes about things.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.960
 And a part of me was always a little bothered

46:22.960 --> 46:24.960
 that that wasn't me,

46:24.960 --> 46:27.960
 that I wouldn't go program 20 hours straight

46:27.960 --> 46:29.960
 because I'm falling apart

46:29.960 --> 46:32.960
 and not being very effective after 12 hours.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.960
 I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming,

46:34.960 --> 46:36.960
 that's fine when you're doing that,

46:36.960 --> 46:38.960
 but not doing smart work much after.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.960
 At least I'm not, but there's a range of people.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.960
 I mean, that's something that a lot of people

46:42.960 --> 46:44.960
 don't really get in their gut

46:44.960 --> 46:46.960
 where there are people that work on four hours of sleep

46:46.960 --> 46:48.960
 and are smart and can continue to do good work,

46:48.960 --> 46:51.960
 but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.960
 So I do tell people that

46:53.960 --> 46:55.960
 I always try to get eight hours of sleep.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
 It's not this, you know,

46:57.960 --> 46:59.960
 push yourself harder, get up earlier.

46:59.960 --> 47:02.960
 I just do worse work where, you know,

47:02.960 --> 47:04.960
 you can work 100 hours a week

47:04.960 --> 47:06.960
 and people get eight hours of sleep

47:06.960 --> 47:08.960
 if you just kind of prioritize things correctly.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.960
 But I do believe in working hard, working a lot.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.960
 There was a comment that Game Dev made

47:14.960 --> 47:17.960
 that I know there's a backlash

47:17.960 --> 47:20.960
 against really hard work in a lot of cases,

47:20.960 --> 47:23.960
 and I get into online arguments about this all the time,

47:23.960 --> 47:25.960
 but he was basically saying, yeah, 40 hours a week,

47:25.960 --> 47:27.960
 that's kind of a part time job.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.960
 And if you were really in it,

47:29.960 --> 47:31.960
 you're doing what you think is important,

47:31.960 --> 47:33.960
 what you're passionate about,

47:33.960 --> 47:35.960
 what your work gets more done.

47:35.960 --> 47:39.960
 And it's just really not possible to argue with that

47:39.960 --> 47:41.960
 if you've been around the people

47:41.960 --> 47:44.960
 that work with that level of intensity and just say,

47:44.960 --> 47:46.960
 it's like, no, they should just stop.

47:46.960 --> 47:49.960
 And we had, I kind of came back around to that

47:49.960 --> 47:53.960
 a couple years ago where I was using the fictional example of,

47:53.960 --> 47:55.960
 all right, some people say,

47:55.960 --> 47:57.960
 they'll say with a straight face, they think,

47:57.960 --> 47:59.960
 no, you are less productive

47:59.960 --> 48:01.960
 if you work more than 40 hours a week.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.960
 You're not really misinterpreting things

48:03.960 --> 48:07.960
 where your marginal productivity for an hour after eight hours

48:07.960 --> 48:09.960
 is less than in one of your peak hours,

48:09.960 --> 48:11.960
 but you're not literally getting less done.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.960
 There is a point where you start breaking things

48:13.960 --> 48:16.960
 and getting worse behavior and everything out of it

48:16.960 --> 48:18.960
 where you're literally going backwards,

48:18.960 --> 48:21.960
 but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.960
 And the fictional example I would use was,

48:23.960 --> 48:28.960
 imagine there's an asteroid coming to crash into Earth,

48:28.960 --> 48:30.960
 destroy all of human life.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.960
 Do you want Elon Musk or the people working at SpaceX

48:33.960 --> 48:35.960
 that are building the interceptor

48:35.960 --> 48:37.960
 that's going to deflect the asteroid?

48:37.960 --> 48:39.960
 Do you want them to clock out at five

48:39.960 --> 48:42.960
 because, damn it, they're just going to do worse work

48:42.960 --> 48:44.960
 if they work another couple hours?

48:44.960 --> 48:46.960
 And it seems absurd.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.960
 And that's a hypothetical, though,

48:48.960 --> 48:49.960
 and everyone can dismiss that,

48:49.960 --> 48:51.960
 but then when coronavirus was hitting

48:51.960 --> 48:54.960
 and you have all of these medical personnel

48:54.960 --> 48:57.960
 that are clearly pushing themselves really, really hard,

48:57.960 --> 49:01.960
 and I'd say it's like, okay, do you want all of these scientists

49:01.960 --> 49:03.960
 working on treatments and vaccines

49:03.960 --> 49:05.960
 and caring for all of these people?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.960
 Are they really screwing everything up

49:07.960 --> 49:09.960
 by working more than eight hours a day?

49:09.960 --> 49:11.960
 And of course, people say I'm just an asshole

49:11.960 --> 49:14.960
 to say something like that, but it's the truth.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.960
 Working longer gets more done.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.960
 So that's kind of the layer one,

49:20.960 --> 49:23.960
 but I'd like to also say that,

49:23.960 --> 49:25.960
 at least I believe, depending on the person,

49:25.960 --> 49:27.960
 depending on the task,

49:27.960 --> 49:30.960
 working more and harder

49:30.960 --> 49:35.960
 will make you better for the next week

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
 in those peak hours.

49:37.960 --> 49:41.960
 So there's something about a deep dedication to a thing

49:41.960 --> 49:44.960
 that kind of gets deep in you.

49:44.960 --> 49:48.960
 So the hard work isn't just about the raw hours of productivity.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.960
 It's the thing it does to you

49:53.960 --> 49:56.960
 in the weeks and months after, too.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.960
 You're tempering yourself in some ways.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.960
 And I think, you know, it's like the Girodreams of sushi.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.960
 If you really dedicate yourself completely to making the sushi,

50:04.960 --> 50:07.960
 like really putting in the long hours,

50:07.960 --> 50:09.960
 day after day after day,

50:09.960 --> 50:13.960
 you become a true craftsman of the thing you're doing.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.960
 Now, there's, of course, discussions about

50:15.960 --> 50:18.960
 are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships,

50:18.960 --> 50:21.960
 are you sacrificing a lot of other possible things

50:21.960 --> 50:23.960
 to do with that time?

50:23.960 --> 50:27.960
 But if you're talking about purely being a master

50:27.960 --> 50:30.960
 or a craftsman of your art,

50:30.960 --> 50:34.960
 that more hours isn't just about doing more.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.960
 It's about becoming better at the thing you're doing.

50:36.960 --> 50:39.960
 Yeah, and I don't gain say anybody that wants to work

50:39.960 --> 50:41.960
 the minimum amount.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.960
 They've got other priorities in their life.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.960
 My only argument that I'm making,

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
 it's not that everybody should work hard.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.960
 It's that if you want to accomplish something,

50:49.960 --> 50:51.960
 if you want to be stronger and harder,

50:51.960 --> 50:53.960
 is the path to getting it accomplished?

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
 Well, let me ask you about this then.

50:55.960 --> 51:00.960
 The mythical work life balance.

51:00.960 --> 51:05.960
 For an engineer, it seems like that's one of the professions

51:05.960 --> 51:10.960
 for a programmer where working hard

51:10.960 --> 51:13.960
 does lead to greater productivity in it.

51:13.960 --> 51:18.960
 But it also raises the question of sort of personal relationships

51:18.960 --> 51:20.960
 that kind of stop family.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.960
 How are you able to find work life balance?

51:23.960 --> 51:26.960
 Is there advice you can give maybe even outside yourself?

51:26.960 --> 51:30.960
 Have you been able to arrive at any wisdom on this part

51:30.960 --> 51:32.960
 in your years of life?

51:32.960 --> 51:34.960
 I do think that there's a wide range of people

51:34.960 --> 51:36.960
 where different people have different needs.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.960
 It's not a one size fits all.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.960
 I am certainly what works for me.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.960
 I can tell enough that I'm different

51:44.960 --> 51:47.960
 than a typical average person in the way things impact me.

51:47.960 --> 51:50.960
 The things that I want to do, my goals are different

51:50.960 --> 51:54.960
 and sort of the levers to impact things are different.

51:54.960 --> 51:58.960
 I have literally never felt burnout

51:58.960 --> 52:01.960
 and I know there's lots of brilliant smart people

52:01.960 --> 52:04.960
 that do world leading work that get burned out

52:04.960 --> 52:06.960
 and it's never hit me.

52:06.960 --> 52:10.960
 I've never been at a point where I'm like,

52:10.960 --> 52:12.960
 I just don't care about this.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.960
 I don't want to do this anymore.

52:14.960 --> 52:18.960
 I've always had the flexibility to work on lots of interesting things.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.960
 I can always just turn my gaze to something else

52:20.960 --> 52:23.960
 and have a great time working on that.

52:23.960 --> 52:26.960
 So much of the ability to actually work hard

52:26.960 --> 52:29.960
 is the ability to have multiple things to choose from

52:29.960 --> 52:32.960
 and to use your time on the most appropriate thing.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.960
 There are time periods where I am,

52:35.960 --> 52:37.960
 it's the best time for me to read a new research paper

52:37.960 --> 52:40.960
 that I need to really be thinking hard about it.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.960
 Then there's a time that maybe I should just scan

52:42.960 --> 52:46.960
 and organize my old notes because I'm just not on top of things.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.960
 Then there's the time that, all right, let's go bang out

52:49.960 --> 52:51.960
 a few hundred lines of code for something.

52:51.960 --> 52:56.960
 So switching between them has been real valuable.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.960
 So you always have kind of joined your heart

52:58.960 --> 53:00.960
 for all the things you're doing

53:00.960 --> 53:02.960
 and that is the kind of work life balance

53:02.960 --> 53:04.960
 as a first sort of step.

53:04.960 --> 53:06.960
 So you're always happy.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.960
 Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
 that often I look like kind of a grim person

53:11.960 --> 53:14.960
 with just sitting there with a neutral expression

53:14.960 --> 53:16.960
 or even like knitted brows and a frown on my face

53:16.960 --> 53:18.960
 as I'm staring at something.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.960
 That's what happiness looks like for you.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.960
 Yeah, it's kind of true.

53:22.960 --> 53:24.960
 It's like, okay, I'm pushing through this.

53:24.960 --> 53:26.960
 I'm making progress here.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.960
 I know that doesn't work for everyone.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.960
 I know it doesn't work for most people,

53:31.960 --> 53:34.960
 but what I am always trying to do in those cases is

53:34.960 --> 53:38.960
 I don't want to let somebody that might be a person like that

53:38.960 --> 53:42.960
 be told by someone else that no, don't even try that out

53:42.960 --> 53:46.960
 as an option where work life balance

53:46.960 --> 53:48.960
 versus kind of your life's work

53:48.960 --> 53:51.960
 where there's a small subset of the people

53:51.960 --> 53:55.960
 that can be very happy being obsessive about things

53:55.960 --> 53:58.960
 and obsession can often get things done

53:58.960 --> 54:02.960
 that just practical, prudent, pedestrian work won't

54:02.960 --> 54:05.960
 or at least won't for a very long time.

54:05.960 --> 54:09.960
 There's legends of your nutritional intake

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
 in the early days.

54:11.960 --> 54:17.960
 What can you say about being a programmer as a kind of athlete?

54:17.960 --> 54:20.960
 So what was the nutrition that fueled it?

54:20.960 --> 54:25.960
 I have never been that great on really paying attention to it

54:25.960 --> 54:28.960
 where I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.960
 I've never been like a big, heavy guy,

54:31.960 --> 54:33.960
 but it was interesting where one of the things

54:33.960 --> 54:35.960
 that I can remember being an unhappy teenager

54:35.960 --> 54:38.960
 not having enough money and one of the things

54:38.960 --> 54:40.960
 that bothered me about not having enough money

54:40.960 --> 54:42.960
 is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.960
 So I got rich and then I bought a whole lot of pizza.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.960
 That was defining.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.960
 That's what being rich felt like.

54:49.960 --> 54:50.960
 There was a lot of little things.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.960
 I could buy all the pizza and comic books and video games

54:53.960 --> 54:55.960
 that I wanted to.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.960
 It really didn't take that much,

54:58.960 --> 55:00.960
 but the pizza was one of those things.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.960
 It's absolutely true that for a long time

55:02.960 --> 55:03.960
 it did software.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.960
 I had a pizza delivered every single day.

55:05.960 --> 55:08.960
 The delivery guy knew me by name.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.960
 I didn't find out until years later

55:10.960 --> 55:12.960
 that apparently I was such a good customer

55:12.960 --> 55:14.960
 that they just never raised the price on me.

55:14.960 --> 55:17.960
 I was using this six year old price for the pizzas

55:17.960 --> 55:20.960
 that they were still kind of sending my way every day.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.960
 So you were doing eating once a day?

55:23.960 --> 55:25.960
 It would be spread out.

55:25.960 --> 55:27.960
 You have a few pieces of pizza.

55:27.960 --> 55:28.960
 You have some more later on

55:28.960 --> 55:30.960
 and I'd maybe have something at home.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.960
 One of the nice things at Facebook Meta

55:33.960 --> 55:35.960
 is they feed you quite well.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.960
 You get a different, I guess now it's door dash

55:38.960 --> 55:39.960
 sorts of things delivered,

55:39.960 --> 55:41.960
 but they take care of making sure

55:41.960 --> 55:43.960
 that everybody does get well fed.

55:43.960 --> 55:46.960
 I probably had better food those six years

55:46.960 --> 55:48.960
 that I was working in the Meta office there

55:48.960 --> 55:50.960
 than I used to before,

55:50.960 --> 55:52.960
 but it's worked out okay for me.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.960
 My health has always been good.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.960
 I get a pretty good amount of exercise

55:56.960 --> 55:58.960
 and I don't eat to excess

55:58.960 --> 56:02.960
 and I avoid a lot of other kind of not so good for you things.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.960
 So I'm still doing quite well at my age.

56:04.960 --> 56:08.960
 Did you have a kind of, I don't know,

56:08.960 --> 56:12.960
 spiritual experience with food or coffee

56:12.960 --> 56:14.960
 or any of that kind of stuff?

56:14.960 --> 56:17.960
 I mean, the programming experience with music

56:17.960 --> 56:20.960
 or like I listen to brown noise on a program

56:20.960 --> 56:22.960
 or like creating an environment

56:22.960 --> 56:24.960
 and the things you take into your body,

56:24.960 --> 56:26.960
 just everything you construct

56:26.960 --> 56:28.960
 can become a kind of ritual

56:28.960 --> 56:31.960
 that empowers the whole process of the program.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
 Did you have that relationship with pizza or?

56:33.960 --> 56:35.960
 It would really be with Diet Coke.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.960
 There still is that sense of, you know,

56:37.960 --> 56:39.960
 drop the can down, crack open the can of Diet Coke.

56:39.960 --> 56:41.960
 All right, now I mean business.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.960
 We're getting to work here.

56:43.960 --> 56:44.960
 Still to this day?

56:44.960 --> 56:45.960
 Yeah.

56:45.960 --> 56:46.960
 Is Diet Coke a still partner?

56:46.960 --> 56:48.960
 Yeah, probably eight or nine a day.

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
 Nice.

56:49.960 --> 56:51.960
 Okay, what about your setup?

56:51.960 --> 56:54.960
 How many screens, what kind of keyboard

56:54.960 --> 56:56.960
 is there something interesting?

56:56.960 --> 56:58.960
 What kind of IDE?

56:58.960 --> 57:01.960
 Emax Vim or something modern?

57:01.960 --> 57:03.960
 Linux, what operating system laptop

57:03.960 --> 57:06.960
 or any interesting thing that brings you joy?

57:06.960 --> 57:08.960
 So I kind of migrated cultures

57:08.960 --> 57:10.960
 where early on through all of Game Dev,

57:10.960 --> 57:12.960
 there was sort of one culture there

57:12.960 --> 57:14.960
 which was really quite distinct from the more,

57:14.960 --> 57:17.960
 the Silicon Valley venture, you know,

57:17.960 --> 57:18.960
 culture for things.

57:18.960 --> 57:19.960
 They're different groups

57:19.960 --> 57:21.960
 and they have pretty different mores

57:21.960 --> 57:23.960
 and the way they think about things where,

57:23.960 --> 57:25.960
 and I still do think a lot of the big companies

57:25.960 --> 57:28.960
 can learn things from the hardcore

57:28.960 --> 57:30.960
 game development side of things

57:30.960 --> 57:34.960
 where it still boggles my mind how hostile

57:34.960 --> 57:38.960
 to debuggers and IDEs that so much of them,

57:38.960 --> 57:40.960
 the kind of big money, get billions of dollars,

57:40.960 --> 57:43.960
 Silicon Valley, venture backed funds are.

57:43.960 --> 57:44.960
 Oh, that's interesting.

57:44.960 --> 57:47.960
 Sorry, so you're saying like big companies

57:47.960 --> 57:49.960
 at Google and Meta are hostile to?

57:49.960 --> 57:52.960
 They are not big on debuggers and IDEs.

57:52.960 --> 57:55.960
 So much of it is like Emacs BIM for things

57:55.960 --> 57:57.960
 and we just assume that debuggers

57:57.960 --> 58:00.960
 don't work most of the time for the systems

58:00.960 --> 58:03.960
 and a lot of this comes from a sort of Linux bias

58:03.960 --> 58:05.960
 on a lot of things where I did come up

58:05.960 --> 58:07.960
 through the personal computers

58:07.960 --> 58:10.960
 and then the DOS and then Windows

58:10.960 --> 58:15.960
 and it was Borland Tools and then Visual Studio and.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.960
 Do you appreciate the buggers?

58:17.960 --> 58:18.960
 Very much so.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.960
 I mean, a debugger is how you get a view

58:20.960 --> 58:23.960
 into a system that's too complicated to understand.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.960
 I mean, anybody that thinks just read the code

58:25.960 --> 58:27.960
 and think about it, that's an insane statement.

58:27.960 --> 58:30.960
 You can't even read all the code on a big system.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.960
 You have to do experiments on the system

58:33.960 --> 58:36.960
 and doing that by adding log statements,

58:36.960 --> 58:38.960
 recompiling and rerunning it

58:38.960 --> 58:40.960
 is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.960
 I mean, yes, you can always get things done

58:42.960 --> 58:44.960
 even if you're working with stone knives

58:44.960 --> 58:46.960
 and bare skins.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.960
 That is the mark of a good programmer

58:48.960 --> 58:50.960
 is that given any tools,

58:50.960 --> 58:52.960
 you will figure out a way to get it done.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.960
 But it's amazing what you can do

58:54.960 --> 58:56.960
 with sometimes much, much better tools

58:56.960 --> 58:58.960
 where instead of just going through

58:58.960 --> 59:01.960
 this iterative compile run debug cycle,

59:01.960 --> 59:04.960
 you have the old Lisp direction of like,

59:04.960 --> 59:06.960
 you've got a REPL and you're working interactively

59:06.960 --> 59:08.960
 and doing amazing things there.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.960
 But in many cases, a debugger as a very powerful user interface

59:11.960 --> 59:14.960
 that can stop, examine all the different things

59:14.960 --> 59:16.960
 in your program, set all of these different breakpoints.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.960
 And of course you can do that with GDP

59:18.960 --> 59:20.960
 or whatever there.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.960
 But this is one of the user interface

59:22.960 --> 59:24.960
 fundamental principles where when something

59:24.960 --> 59:26.960
 is complicated to do,

59:26.960 --> 59:28.960
 you won't use it very often.

59:28.960 --> 59:30.960
 There's people that will break out GDP

59:30.960 --> 59:32.960
 when they're at their wits end

59:32.960 --> 59:34.960
 and they just have beat their head against a problem

59:34.960 --> 59:36.960
 for so long.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.960
 But for somebody that kind of grew up in Game Dev,

59:38.960 --> 59:40.960
 it's like they were running into the debugger anyways

59:40.960 --> 59:42.960
 before they even knew there was a problem

59:42.960 --> 59:44.960
 and you would just stop and see what was happening

59:44.960 --> 59:46.960
 and sometimes you could fix things

59:46.960 --> 59:50.960
 even before you did one compile cycle.

59:50.960 --> 59:52.960
 You could be in the debugger and you could say,

59:52.960 --> 59:54.960
 well, I'm just going to change this right here.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.960
 And yep, that did the job and fix it and go on.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.960
 And for people that don't know,

59:58.960 --> 1:00:02.960
 GDP is a popular Linux debugger

1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:04.960
 primarily for C++.

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:06.960
 They handle most of the languages,

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:08.960
 but it's based on C

1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:10.960
 as the original Unix heritage.

1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:12.960
 And it's kind of like command line.

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:14.960
 It doesn't allow for clean visualizations

1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:16.960
 and you're exactly right.

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:18.960
 You're using this kind of debugger

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:20.960
 usually when you're at wits end

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:22.960
 and there's a problem that you can't figure out

1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:24.960
 why by just looking at the codes if defined it.

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:26.960
 That's how I guess normal programmers use it.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:28.960
 But you're saying there should be tools

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:30.960
 that kind of visualize

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:32.960
 and help you as part of the programming process.

1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:34.960
 Just a normal programming process

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:36.960
 to understand the code deeper.

1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:38.960
 Yeah, when I'm working on like my C++ code,

1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:42.960
 I'm always running it from the debugger.

1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:44.960
 You know, just I type in the code.

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:46.960
 I run it many times.

1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:48.960
 The first thing I do after writing code

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:50.960
 is set a breakpoint and step through the function.

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:52.960
 Now other people will say it's like,

1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:54.960
 oh, I do that in my head.

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:56.960
 Well, your head is a faulty interpreter

1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.960
 of all those things there.

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:00.960
 And I've written brand new code.

1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:02.960
 I want to step in there and I'm going to single step

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:04.960
 through that examine lots of things

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:06.960
 and see if it's actually doing what I expected it to.

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:10.960
 It is a kind of companion, the debugger.

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:12.960
 Like you're now coding in an interactive way

1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:14.960
 with another being.

1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:16.960
 The debugger is a kind of dumb being,

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:18.960
 but it's a reliable being.

1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:20.960
 That is an interesting question

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:22.960
 of what role does AI play in that kind of,

1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:24.960
 with Codex and these kind of

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:26.960
 ability to generate code.

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:28.960
 You might start having tools

1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:30.960
 that understand the code

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:32.960
 in interesting deep ways

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:34.960
 that can work with you.

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.960
 There's a whole spectrum there

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.960
 from static code analyzers

1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:40.960
 and various kind of dynamic tools

1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:42.960
 there up to AI

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:44.960
 that can conceivably grok these programs

1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:46.960
 that literally no human can understand.

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:48.960
 They're too big, too intertwined,

1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.960
 and too interconnected,

1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:52.960
 but it's not beyond the possibility

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:54.960
 of understanding.

1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.960
 It's just beyond what we can hold in our heads

1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.960
 as kind of mutable state

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.960
 while we're working on things.

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:02.960
 And I'm a big proponent again

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.960
 of things like static analyzers

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:06.960
 and some of that stuff where

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:08.960
 you'll find some people that don't like

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:10.960
 being scolded by a program

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.960
 for how they've written something where

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.960
 it's like, oh, I know better, and sometimes you do,

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.960
 but that was something that

1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.960
 I was, it was very,

1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:20.960
 very valuable for me when

1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:22.960
 and not too many people get an opportunity

1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:24.960
 like this to have. This is almost one of those spiritual

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:26.960
 experiences as a programmer and

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:28.960
 awakening to the

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.960
 software code bases were a couple million

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:32.960
 lines of code and

1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:34.960
 at one point I had used a few of the

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.960
 different analysis tools, but

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:38.960
 I made a point to really

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:40.960
 go through and scrub the code base

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:42.960
 using every tool that I could find

1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:44.960
 and it was eye opening where we had

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.960
 a reputation for having some of the

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.960
 most robust, strongest code,

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:50.960
 where there were some great things that

1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.960
 I remember hearing from Microsoft

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:54.960
 telling us about crashes on Xbox

1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:56.960
 and we had this tiny number that they said

1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:58.960
 were probably literally hardware errors

1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:00.960
 and then you have other significant

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:02.960
 titles that just have millions of

1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:04.960
 faults that are getting recorded all the time,

1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:06.960
 so I was proud of our code on a lot

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.960
 of levels, but when I took this

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.960
 code analysis squeegee through

1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:12.960
 everything, it was

1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:14.960
 it was shocking how many

1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:16.960
 errors there were in there, things

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.960
 that you can say, okay, this was

1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:20.960
 a copy paste, not changing something right

1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:22.960
 here, lots of things that were

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:24.960
 the most common problem

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.960
 was something in a printf

1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:28.960
 format string that was the wrong data

1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:30.960
 type that could cause crashes there

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:32.960
 and you really want the warnings for

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:34.960
 things like that and the next most common

1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:36.960
 was missing a check for null that could

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:38.960
 actually happen, that could blow things up

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:40.960
 and those are obviously like top C, C++

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:42.960
 things, everybody has those problems,

1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:44.960
 but the long tail of

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.960
 all of the different little things that could go

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:48.960
 wrong there and we had good programmers

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:50.960
 and my own code stuff that I'd be looking

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:52.960
 at, it's like, oh, I wrote that code, that's

1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:54.960
 definitely wrong, we've been using this

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.960
 for a year and

1:03:56.960 --> 1:03:58.960
 it's this, you know, this

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.960
 mind sitting there waiting for us to step

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.960
 on and

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.960
 it was humbling, it was, and

1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:06.960
 I reached the conclusion that

1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:08.960
 anything that can be syntactically

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:10.960
 allowed in your language

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:12.960
 if it's going to show up

1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:14.960
 eventually in a large enough code base

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.960
 you're not going to, good intentions

1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:18.960
 aren't going to keep it from happening,

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:20.960
 you need automated tools and guard

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:22.960
 rails for things and those start with

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:24.960
 static types or even

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:26.960
 type hints in the more dynamic languages

1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:28.960
 but the people that

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.960
 rebel against that, that basically

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:32.960
 say, that slows me down

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.960
 doing that, there's something to that, I get

1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:36.960
 that, I've written, you know, I've cobbled

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.960
 things together in a notebook, I'm like

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.960
 wow, this is great that it just happened

1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:42.960
 but yeah, that's kind of sketchy but it's working

1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.960
 fine, I don't care, it does come back to

1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:46.960
 that value analysis

1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:48.960
 where sometimes it's right to not care

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:50.960
 but when you do care

1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:52.960
 if it's going to be something that's going to

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.960
 live for years and it's going to have other people

1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:56.960
 working on it and it's going to be

1:04:56.960 --> 1:04:58.960
 deployed to millions of people

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:00.960
 then you want to use all of these tools

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:02.960
 you want to be told, it's like no, you've

1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:04.960
 screwed up here, here, and here and that does

1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:06.960
 require kind of an ego check about

1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:08.960
 things where you have

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:10.960
 to be open to the fact

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:12.960
 that everything that you're doing is just littered

1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:14.960
 with flaws, it's not that oh, you

1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:16.960
 occasionally have a bad day, it's just

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:18.960
 whatever stream of code you output

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:20.960
 there's going to be a statistical

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:22.960
 regularity of things that you just make mistakes

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:24.960
 on and

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:26.960
 I do think there's a whole

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:28.960
 argument about test driven design

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:30.960
 and unit testing versus kind of

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.960
 analysis and different things

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:34.960
 I am more in favor of the

1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:36.960
 analysis and the stuff that just like you can't run

1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:38.960
 your program until you fix this rather

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.960
 than you can run it and hopefully

1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:42.960
 a unit test will catch it in some way

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:44.960
 Yeah, in my private code

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:46.960
 I have asserts everywhere

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:48.960
 just there's something

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:50.960
 pleasant to me

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:52.960
 pleasurable to me about sort of the

1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:54.960
 dictatorial rule of like

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:56.960
 this should be true at this point

1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:58.960
 in too many times

1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:00.960
 I've

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:02.960
 made mistakes

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:04.960
 that shouldn't have been made

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:06.960
 and I would assume

1:06:06.960 --> 1:06:08.960
 I wouldn't be the kind of person that would make that mistake

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:10.960
 but I keep making that mistake therefore

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:12.960
 an assert really catches me

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:14.960
 really helps all the time

1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:16.960
 so my

1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:18.960
 I would say like 10 to 20% of my private code

1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:20.960
 just for personal use is probably

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:22.960
 asserts. And they're active comments

1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:24.960
 and it's one of those things that in theory

1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:26.960
 they don't make any difference to the program

1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:28.960
 and if it was all operating the way

1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:30.960
 you expected it would be then

1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:32.960
 they will never fire

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.960
 but even if you have it right

1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:36.960
 and you wrote the code right initially

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:38.960
 then circumstances change

1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:40.960
 the world outside your program changes

1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:42.960
 and in fact that's one of the things

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:44.960
 where I'm kind of fond

1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.960
 in a lot of cases of static array size

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:48.960
 declarations where

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.960
 I went through this period where it's like

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.960
 okay now we have general collection classes

1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:54.960
 we should just make everything variable

1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:56.960
 because I had this history of

1:06:56.960 --> 1:06:58.960
 in the early days you get doom

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:00.960
 which had some fixed limits on it then

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:02.960
 everybody started making crazier and crazier

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.960
 things and they kept bumping up the different limits

1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:06.960
 this many lines this many sectors

1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:08.960
 and it seemed like

1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:10.960
 a good idea well we should just make this completely

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.960
 you can go kind of go up to whatever

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.960
 and

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.960
 there's cases where that's the right thing to do

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:18.960
 but it also

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.960
 the other aspect of the world changing around you

1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:22.960
 is it's good to be informed

1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:24.960
 when the world has changed more than you thought it would

1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:26.960
 and if you've got a continuously

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.960
 growing collection you're never going to find out

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:30.960
 you might have this quadratic

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:32.960
 slowdown on something where

1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:34.960
 you thought oh I'm only ever going to have a handful

1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:36.960
 of these but something changes

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:38.960
 and there's a new design style and all of a sudden

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:40.960
 you've got 10,000 of them

1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:42.960
 so I kind of like in many cases

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:44.960
 picking a number

1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:46.960
 some you know nice brown power of two

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.960
 number and setting it up in there

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:50.960
 and having an assert saying it's like hey you hit

1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:52.960
 the you hit this limit you should probably

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.960
 think are the choices that you've made

1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:56.960
 around all of this still relevant

1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:58.960
 if somebody's using 10 times

1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:00.960
 more than you thought they would

1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:02.960
 yeah this code was originally written

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.960
 with this kind of world view

1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:06.960
 with this kind of set of constraints

1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:08.960
 thinking of the world in this way

1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:10.960
 if something breaks that means

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:12.960
 you got to rethink the initial stuff

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:14.960
 and it's nice for it to

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:16.960
 for it to do that

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:18.960
 is there any stuff like keyboard

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:20.960
 or monitors

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:22.960
 I'm fairly pedestrian on

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:24.960
 a lot of that where I did move

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.960
 to triple monitors like in the last

1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:28.960
 several years ago I had been dual monitor

1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:30.960
 for a very long time and

1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.960
 and it was one of those things where

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.960
 probably years later than

1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:36.960
 I should have I'm just like well the video cards

1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:38.960
 now generally have three output ports

1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:40.960
 I should just put the third monitor up there

1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:42.960
 that's been a pure win I've been very happy

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.960
 with that

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:46.960
 but no I don't have fancy keyboard

1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.960
 or mouse or anything

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.960
 the key things is an IDE that has

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:52.960
 helpful debuggers

1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:54.960
 has helpful tools so it's not

1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.960
 the Emacs Vimrao and then Diet Coke

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.960
 yeah so I did spend

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.960
 one of my week long retreats

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:02.960
 where I'm like okay I'm going to make myself

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.960
 use

1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:06.960
 it was actually classic VI which I know people will say

1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:08.960
 you should never have done that you should have just used Vim

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.960
 directly but

1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:12.960
 I gave it the good try it's like okay I'm being

1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:14.960
 in kind of classic Unix developer

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:16.960
 mode here and

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:18.960
 I worked for a week on it

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:20.960
 I used Anki to like teach myself

1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:22.960
 the different little key combinations

1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:24.960
 for things like that and in the end it was just like

1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:26.960
 alright this was kind of like

1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:28.960
 my Civil War reenactment phase

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:30.960
 it's like I'm going out there doing it like they used to

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:32.960
 in the old days and it was kind of fun

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:34.960
 in that regard so many people right now

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:36.960
 they're screaming

1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:38.960
 as they're listening to this

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:40.960
 so again the out is that this was not modern Vim

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:42.960
 but still

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:44.960
 yes I was very happy to get back to

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.960
 my visual studio at the end

1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:48.960
 yeah I'm actually I struggle with this a lot

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.960
 because

1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:52.960
 so you said Kinesis keyboard and

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:54.960
 I use Emacs primarily

1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:56.960
 and I feel like

1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:58.960
 I can exactly as you said

1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:00.960
 I can understand the code I can navigate

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.960
 the code there's a lot of stuff you can build

1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:04.960
 within Emacs with using Lisp

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:06.960
 you can customize a lot of things for yourself

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:08.960
 to help you

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:10.960
 introspect the code like to help you

1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:12.960
 understand the code and visualize different aspects

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.960
 of the code you can even run debuggers

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.960
 but it's work

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:18.960
 and the world moves past you

1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:20.960
 and the better and better ideas are constantly

1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:22.960
 being built and that

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:24.960
 puts a kind of

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:26.960
 I need to take the same kind of

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:28.960
 treat as you're talking about but now

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:30.960
 I'm still fighting the Civil War

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:32.960
 I need to kind of move into the 21st century

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:34.960
 and it does seem like the world is

1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:36.960
 or a large chunk of the world is moving

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:38.960
 towards visual studio code which is

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.960
 kind of interesting to me against the

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.960
 JavaScript ecosystem on the one hand

1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:44.960
 and IDs are one of those

1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:46.960
 things that you want to be infinitely

1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:48.960
 fast you want them to just kind of

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.960
 immediately respond

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:52.960
 and like I mean heck I've got there's someone

1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:54.960
 I know I'm an old school game dev guy

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:56.960
 that still uses visual studio 6

1:10:56.960 --> 1:10:58.960
 and on a modern computer

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.960
 everything is just

1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:02.960
 absolutely instant on something like that

1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:04.960
 because it was made to work on a computer that's

1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:06.960
 10,000 or 100,000

1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:08.960
 times slower so just everything happens

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:10.960
 immediately and all the

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:12.960
 modern systems just feel

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:14.960
 you know they feel so crufty when

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:16.960
 it's like oh why is this refreshing the screen

1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:18.960
 and moving around and updating over here

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.960
 and something blinks down there and you should

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:22.960
 update this and there's

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:24.960
 you know there are things that

1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:26.960
 we've lost with that incredible flexibility

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:28.960
 but

1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:30.960
 lots of people get tons of value from it

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.960
 and I am super happy that that seems

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.960
 to be winning over even a lot of the old

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:36.960
 Vim and Emacs people that they're kind of like

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:38.960
 hey visual studio codes maybe you know

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:40.960
 not so bad I am

1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:42.960
 that may be the final peacekeeping solution

1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:44.960
 where everybody is reasonably

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:46.960
 happy with something like that

1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:48.960
 so can you explain what

1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:50.960
 a.plan file is and

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:52.960
 what role that played in your life

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:54.960
 does it still continue to play a role

1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:56.960
 back in the early early days

1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.960
 of id software one of

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:00.960
 our big things that was unique with what we did

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:02.960
 is I had adopted

1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:04.960
 next stations or kind of next step

1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:06.960
 systems from I Steve Jobs

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.960
 is out in the

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:10.960
 out in the woods away from Apple company

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:12.960
 and

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:14.960
 they were basically it was kind of interesting

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:16.960
 because I did not really have a background

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:18.960
 with the Unix system so many of the people

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:20.960
 they get immersed in that

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:22.960
 in college and

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:24.960
 you know and that's you know that

1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:26.960
 sets a lot of cultural expectations for them

1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:28.960
 and I didn't have any of that

1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:30.960
 but I knew that

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:32.960
 my background was I was a huge Apple

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:34.960
 to fanboy I was always

1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:36.960
 a little suspicious of the Mac I was

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:38.960
 not really what I what kind

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.960
 of I wanted to go with

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:42.960
 but when Steve Jobs left

1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.960
 Apple and started next this

1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.960
 computer did just seem like one of those amazing things

1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:48.960
 from the future where it had

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:50.960
 all of this cool stuff in it and we were

1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:52.960
 still back in those days working on

1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:54.960
 DOS everything blew up you had

1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:56.960
 reset buttons because your computer would just freeze

1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:58.960
 if you're doing development work literally

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:00.960
 dozens of times a day your computer was just rebooting

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:02.960
 constantly and so this

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:04.960
 idea of yes any of the

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:06.960
 the Unix work stations would have given

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.960
 a stable development platform where

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:10.960
 you don't crash and reboot all the

1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:12.960
 time but next also had

1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:14.960
 this really amazing graphical

1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:16.960
 interface and it was great for building

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:18.960
 tools and it used

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:20.960
 Objective C as the kind of

1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:22.960
 an interesting

1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:24.960
 next was Unix based

1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:26.960
 it's at Objective C so it has a lot of the

1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:28.960
 elements that became Mac I mean

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:30.960
 the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:32.960
 by next where that took over

1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:34.960
 and became what what the modern Mac

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.960
 system and defined some of the developer

1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:38.960
 like

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.960
 the tools and the whole community

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:42.960
 and you've still got if you're programming

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.960
 on Apple stuff now there's still all these

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:46.960
 NS somethings which was originally

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:48.960
 Next Step Objects of different kinds of things

1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:50.960
 but one of the aspects

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.960
 of those Unix systems

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.960
 was they had this notion of

1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:56.960
 a dot plan file where

1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:58.960
 a dot file is an invisible

1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.960
 file usually in your

1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:02.960
 home directory or something and there was a trivial

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:04.960
 server running on most Unix systems

1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:06.960
 at the time that

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.960
 when somebody ran a trivial

1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:10.960
 little command called finger you could

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.960
 do a finger and then somebody's

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.960
 address it could be anywhere on the internet

1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:16.960
 if you were connected correctly

1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:18.960
 then all that server would do was

1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:20.960
 read the dot plan file

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:22.960
 in that user's home directory and then just

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.960
 spit it out to you and originally

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:26.960
 the idea was that could be

1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:28.960
 whether you're on vacation what your current

1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:30.960
 project was it's supposed to be like the

1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:32.960
 plan of what you're doing and people would

1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:34.960
 use it for you know

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:36.960
 various purposes but all it did was

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.960
 dump that file over

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.960
 to the terminal of whoever issued

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.960
 the finger command

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:44.960
 and at one point

1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:46.960
 I started just keeping a list

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.960
 of what I was doing in there

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:50.960
 which would be what I was working on in the day

1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:52.960
 and I would have this little

1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.960
 syntax I kind of got to myself about

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:56.960
 here's something that I'm working on

1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.960
 I put a star when I finish it

1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:00.960
 I could have a few other little bits of punctuation

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:02.960
 and at the time it

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:04.960
 started off as being just like my to do

1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:06.960
 list and it would be these

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:08.960
 trivial obscure little things like

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:10.960
 I fixed something

1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:12.960
 with collision detection code

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:14.960
 made fireball do something different

1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:16.960
 and just little one liners that people that

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.960
 were following the games could kind of

1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:20.960
 decipher but I did wind up

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:22.960
 starting to write

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:24.960
 much more in depth things I would have

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:26.960
 little notes of

1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:28.960
 thoughts and insights and then I would

1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:30.960
 eventually start having little essays I would

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:32.960
 sometimes dump into the dot plan files

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:34.960
 interspersed with the work logs of things

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.960
 that I was doing so in some

1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:38.960
 ways it was like a super early proto

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:40.960
 blog where I was just kind

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:42.960
 of dumping out what I was working on but it

1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:44.960
 was interesting enough that

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:46.960
 there were a lot of people

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:48.960
 that were interested in this

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:50.960
 so most of the people didn't have Unix workstation

1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:52.960
 so there were the websites back in

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:54.960
 the day that would follow the doom and quake development

1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:56.960
 that would

1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:58.960
 basically make a little service that would go grab

1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:00.960
 all the changes and then people could just get it with

1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:02.960
 a web browser and there was a period

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:04.960
 where like all of the little

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:06.960
 kind of Dallas gaming diaspora

1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:08.960
 of people that were at all in that

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.960
 orbit there were a couple dozen plan

1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:12.960
 files going on which was

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:14.960
 and this was some years before

1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:16.960
 blogging really became kind of a thing

1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:18.960
 and it was kind of a

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:20.960
 a premonition of sort of the

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:22.960
 way things would go and there

1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:24.960
 was it's all been collected

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:26.960
 it's available online in different places

1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:28.960
 and it's kind of fun to go back and look through

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:30.960
 what I was thinking what

1:16:30.960 --> 1:16:32.960
 I was doing in the different areas

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:34.960
 Have you had a chance to look back is there some interesting

1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:36.960
 very low level specific

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:38.960
 to do items

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:40.960
 maybe things you've never completed all that kind

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:42.960
 of stuff and high level

1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:44.960
 philosophical essay type of stuff

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:46.960
 that

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.960
 there's some good stuff on both where

1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:50.960
 a lot of it was low level

1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:52.960
 nitpicky details about game dev

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:54.960
 and

1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:56.960
 I've learned enough things where there's no project

1:16:56.960 --> 1:16:58.960
 that I worked on that I couldn't go back

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:00.960
 and do a better job on now

1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:02.960
 I mean you just you learn things hopefully

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:04.960
 if you're doing it right you learn things as you get older

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:06.960
 and you should be able to do a better job

1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:08.960
 at all of the early things and there's

1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:10.960
 stuff in

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:12.960
 Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like oh clearly

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:14.960
 I could go back and do a better job

1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:16.960
 at this whether it's something in the rendering engine

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:18.960
 side or how I implemented

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.960
 the monster behaviors

1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:22.960
 or managed resources

1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:24.960
 do you see the flaws in your thinking now

1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:26.960
 looking back

1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:28.960
 I mean sometimes I'll get the

1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:30.960
 you know I'll look at it and say yeah I had a pretty

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:32.960
 clear view of I was doing good work

1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:34.960
 there and I haven't

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:36.960
 really hit the point where

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:38.960
 there was another programmer Graham Divine

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:40.960
 who was he had worked at id and

1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:42.960
 seventh guest and he made

1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:44.960
 some comment one time where he said he looked back at some

1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:46.960
 of his old notes he was like wow I

1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:48.960
 was really smart back then

1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:50.960
 and I don't hit

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.960
 that so much where I mean I look at it

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:54.960
 and I always know that yeah

1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:56.960
 there's all the you know with aging you get

1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:58.960
 certain changes in how you

1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:00.960
 you're able to work problems but all of the

1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:02.960
 problems that I've worked I

1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:04.960
 I'm you know I'm sure that I could do

1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:06.960
 a better job on all of them

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:08.960
 so you can still step right in if you could travel

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:10.960
 back in time and talk to that guy

1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:12.960
 you would teach him a few things yeah absolutely

1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:14.960
 it's awesome

1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:16.960
 I'm what about the high level

1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:18.960
 philosophical stuff is there some insights

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:20.960
 that stand out do you remember

1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:22.960
 there's things that

1:18:22.960 --> 1:18:24.960
 there's understanding about

1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:26.960
 development and I

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.960
 you know in the industry and so on that

1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:30.960
 were in a more primitive

1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:32.960
 stage where

1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:34.960
 I am I definitely learned

1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:36.960
 a lot more in the later years

1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:38.960
 about business and organization

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:40.960
 and team structure

1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:42.960
 there were

1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:44.960
 I mean there were definitely things that I was

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:46.960
 not the best person

1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:48.960
 or even a very good person about managing

1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:50.960
 like how a team should

1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:52.960
 internally how people should work together

1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:54.960
 I was just I

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:56.960
 you know I just

1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:58.960
 get out of my way and let me work on the code

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:00.960
 and do this and more and more

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:02.960
 I've learned how

1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:04.960
 in the larger scheme of things

1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:06.960
 how but sometimes relatively

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:08.960
 unimportant some of those things are where it is

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:10.960
 this user value generation

1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:12.960
 that's the the overarching

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:14.960
 importance for all of that and I

1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:16.960
 I didn't necessarily have my eye on that

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:18.960
 ball correctly through a lot of my

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:20.960
 you know my earlier years

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:22.960
 and there's things that

1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:24.960
 you know I could have I could have gotten more

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:26.960
 out of people handling things in different ways

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:28.960
 I am you know I could have made

1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:30.960
 you know in some ways more

1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:32.960
 successful products by following things

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:34.960
 in different ways there's mistakes that we

1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:36.960
 made that we couldn't really have

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:38.960
 known how things would have worked out but

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:40.960
 it was interesting to see in later years companies

1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:42.960
 like Activision showing that hey you really

1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:44.960
 can just do the same game

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:46.960
 make it better every year and you can

1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:48.960
 look at that from a negative standpoint

1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:50.960
 and say it's like oh that's just being derivative

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:52.960
 and all that but if you step back again

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:54.960
 and say it's like no are the people buying it

1:19:54.960 --> 1:19:56.960
 still enjoying it are they enjoying it more

1:19:56.960 --> 1:19:58.960
 than what they might have bought otherwise

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:00.960
 and you can say no that's that's actually

1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:02.960
 a great value creation

1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:04.960
 engine to do that if you're in a position

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:06.960
 where you can I you know

1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:08.960
 don't be forced into reinventing

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:10.960
 everything just because you think that you need

1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:12.960
 to I am

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:14.960
 you know lots of things about

1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:16.960
 business and team stuff that could be done

1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:18.960
 better but the technical work the kind

1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:20.960
 of technical visionary type stuff

1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:22.960
 that I laid out I still

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:24.960
 feel pretty good about there are some

1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:26.960
 classic old ones about my defending

1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:28.960
 of OpenGL versus D3D

1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:30.960
 which turned out

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.960
 to be one of the more probably

1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:34.960
 important momentous things there where

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.960
 it never it was always

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.960
 a rearguard action on Windows

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:40.960
 where Microsoft was just not going

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:42.960
 to let that win but when I look

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.960
 back on it now

1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:46.960
 that fight to keep OpenGL relevant

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:48.960
 for a number of years there

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:50.960
 meant that OpenGL was there

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.960
 when mobile started happening

1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:54.960
 and OpenGL ES was the thing that

1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:56.960
 drove all of the acceleration

1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:58.960
 of the mobile industry

1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:00.960
 and it's really only in the last few years

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:02.960
 as Apple's moved to metal and some

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:04.960
 of the other companies have moved to Vulcan

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:06.960
 that that's moved away

1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:08.960
 but really stepping back

1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:10.960
 and looking at it's like yeah I sold

1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:12.960
 millions of games for different things

1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.960
 but billions

1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:16.960
 and billions of devices wound

1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.960
 up with an appropriate

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:20.960
 capable graphics API

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:22.960
 do in no small part

1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:24.960
 to me thinking that that was really important

1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:26.960
 that we not just

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.960
 give up and use Microsoft's

1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:30.960
 at that

1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:32.960
 time really terrible API

1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:34.960
 the thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:36.960
 terrible they were terrible at the start

1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:38.960
 but a few versions on

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:40.960
 they were actually quite good and there was a completely

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:42.960
 fair argument to be made that

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:44.960
 by the time DX9 was out

1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:46.960
 it was probably a better programming environment

1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:48.960
 than OpenGL but it was still

1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:50.960
 a wonderful good thing

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:52.960
 that we had an open standard that could

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:54.960
 show up on Linux and Android

1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:56.960
 iOS and eventually WebGL

1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:58.960
 still to this day so

1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:00.960
 that was one

1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:02.960
 that would be on my greatest hits list of things

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:04.960
 that I kind of pushed with. In terms of impact it had

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:06.960
 on billions of devices yes

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:08.960
 so let's talk about it

1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:10.960
 can you tell the origin story of id software

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:12.960
 again

1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:14.960
 one of the greatest game developer

1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:16.960
 companies ever it created

1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:18.960
 Wolfstein 3D games that

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:20.960
 define my life also

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:22.960
 in many ways as a thing

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:24.960
 that made me realize what computers are capable of

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:26.960
 in terms of graphics in terms of

1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:28.960
 performance it just

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:30.960
 unlocked something deep

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:32.960
 in me in understanding

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:34.960
 what these machines are all about as games can do that

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:36.960
 so Wolfstein 3D, Doom, Quake

1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:38.960
 and just all the

1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:40.960
 incredible engineering innovation that went into that

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.960
 so how did it all

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:44.960
 start? So I'll caveat up

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.960
 front that I usually don't

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:48.960
 consider myself the historian

1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.960
 of the software side of things

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.960
 I usually do

1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:54.960
 kind of point people at John Romero

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:56.960
 for stories about the early days

1:22:56.960 --> 1:22:58.960
 where

1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:00.960
 I've never been like I've commented

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:02.960
 that I'm a remarkably unsentimental person

1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:04.960
 in some ways where I don't really

1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:06.960
 spend a lot of time unless I'm explicitly

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:08.960
 prodded to go back and think about

1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:10.960
 the early days of things and

1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:12.960
 I didn't

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.960
 necessarily make the effort to

1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.960
 archive everything exactly in my brain

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:18.960
 and the more that I work on machine learning

1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:20.960
 and AI and the aspects of memory

1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:22.960
 and how when you go back and polish certain

1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:24.960
 things it's not necessarily exactly

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:26.960
 the way it happened but

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.960
 having said all of that from

1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:30.960
 my view the way everything

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:32.960
 happened that led up to that was

1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:34.960
 after I was

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:36.960
 an adult kind of taking

1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:38.960
 a few college classes deciding to drop

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:40.960
 out I was doing

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:42.960
 I was hard scrabble contract

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.960
 programming work really struggling to

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:46.960
 kind of keep groceries and pay my rent

1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:48.960
 and things and the company

1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:50.960
 that I was doing the most work for was

1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.960
 a company called Soft Disk Publishing

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.960
 which had the

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:56.960
 Sounds Bizarre Now business model

1:23:56.960 --> 1:23:58.960
 of monthly subscription software

1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:00.960
 you know before there was an internet

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.960
 that people could connect to and get software

1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:04.960
 you would pay

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.960
 a certain amount and every month they would send

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:08.960
 you a disk that had some random software

1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:10.960
 on it and people that were into

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:12.960
 computers thought this was kind of cool and they had

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.960
 different ones for the Apple 2

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:16.960
 the 2GS the PC the Mac

1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:18.960
 the Amiga

1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:20.960
 lots of different things here so quirky little

1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:22.960
 business but I was doing a lot

1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:24.960
 of contract programming for them where I'd

1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:26.960
 write tiny little games and sell them

1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:28.960
 for $300

1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:30.960
 $500 and one of the things

1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:32.960
 that I was doing again to keep

1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:34.960
 my head above water here was

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.960
 I decided that I could make

1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:38.960
 one program and I could

1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:40.960
 port it to multiple systems

1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:42.960
 so I would write a game like

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.960
 dark designs or catacombs and

1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:46.960
 I would develop it on the Apple 2

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:48.960
 the 2GS and the IBM PC

1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:50.960
 which apparently

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:52.960
 was the thing that really kind

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.960
 of piqued the attention of the

1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:56.960
 people working down there like Jay Wilbur

1:24:56.960 --> 1:24:58.960
 was my primary editor and Tom Hall

1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:00.960
 was a secondary editor

1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:02.960
 and they kept asking me it's like hey

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.960
 you should come down and work for us here

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:06.960
 and I

1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:08.960
 pushed it off a couple times because I was

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:10.960
 really enjoying my freedom of kind of being

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:12.960
 off on my own even if I was barely

1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:14.960
 getting by I loved it I was

1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:16.960
 doing nothing but programming all day

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:18.960
 but I did have enough

1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:20.960
 close scrapes with like damn I'm just

1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:22.960
 really out of money that maybe I should

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:24.960
 get an actual job

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:26.960
 rather than contracting these kind of one at

1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:28.960
 a time things and Jay Wilbur

1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:30.960
 was great he was like fedexing me the checks

1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:32.960
 when I would need them to kind

1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.960
 of get over whatever hump I was at

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:36.960
 so I took the

1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:38.960
 I finally took them up on their offer to come

1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:40.960
 down to Shreveport, Louisiana

1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:42.960
 I was in Kansas City at the time

1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:44.960
 drove down

1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:46.960
 to through the Ozarks and everything

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:48.960
 down to Louisiana

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:50.960
 and saw the soft disk

1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:52.960
 offices went through talked to a bunch of

1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:54.960
 people met the people I had been working

1:25:54.960 --> 1:25:56.960
 with remotely at that time

1:25:56.960 --> 1:25:58.960
 but the most important thing for me

1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:00.960
 was I met two programmers

1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:02.960
 there John Romero and Lane Roth

1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:04.960
 that for the first time ever I had met

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:06.960
 programmers that knew more

1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:08.960
 cool stuff than I did where

1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:10.960
 the world was just different back then I

1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:12.960
 was in Kansas City it was one of those

1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:14.960
 smartest kid in the school does all the

1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:16.960
 computer stuff the teachers don't have anything

1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:18.960
 to teach him but all I had to learn

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:20.960
 from was these few books at the library

1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:22.960
 it was not much at all

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.960
 and there were some aspects of programming

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:26.960
 that were kind of black magic to me

1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:28.960
 like it's like oh he knows how to format

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:30.960
 a track on I am you know on a

1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:32.960
 low level drive programming

1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:34.960
 interface and this

1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:36.960
 was I was still not at all

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:38.960
 sure I was going to take the job but I met

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:40.960
 these awesome programmers that

1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:42.960
 were doing cool stuff and my Romero had

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.960
 worked at Origin Systems and he had done

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:46.960
 like you know so many different games

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.960
 ahead of time

1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:50.960
 that I did kind of quickly decide like

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:52.960
 yeah I'll go take the job down there

1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:54.960
 and I

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:56.960
 settled down there moved in

1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:58.960
 and started working on more little

1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:00.960
 projects and the first kind

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.960
 of big change that happened down there

1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:04.960
 was the company wanted to make a gaming

1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:06.960
 focused a PC gaming focused

1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:08.960
 subscription just like all their

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:10.960
 other was the same formula that they used for

1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:12.960
 everything pay a monthly

1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:14.960
 fee and you'll get a disc with

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:16.960
 one or two games just every month

1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:18.960
 and no choice in what you get but we think

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.960
 it'll be fun and that was the model

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:22.960
 they were comfortable with and said all right

1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:24.960
 we're going to start this gamers edge department

1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:26.960
 and all of us that were

1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:28.960
 interested in that like me Romero

1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:30.960
 I Tom Hall was kind of

1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:32.960
 helping us from from his side of things

1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:34.960
 Jay would peak in and we had a few other

1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:36.960
 programmers

1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.960
 working with us at the time and we were

1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:40.960
 going to to just start making games

1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:42.960
 just the same model

1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.960
 and we dived in and it was fantastic

1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:46.960
 you have to make new games

1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:48.960
 every month every month

1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.960
 yeah and this in

1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:52.960
 retrospect looking back at it that sense

1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:54.960
 that I had done all this contract programming

1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:56.960
 and John Romero had done

1:27:56.960 --> 1:27:58.960
 like far more of this where he had done one

1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:00.960
 of his teaching himself efforts was he

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:02.960
 made a game for every letter of the alphabet

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:04.960
 that sense of like I'm just going to go make

1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:06.960
 26 different games give him a different

1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:08.960
 theme and you learn

1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:10.960
 so much when you go through and you

1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:12.960
 crank these things out like on a

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:14.960
 bi weekly monthly basis something

1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:16.960
 to finish it's not like an I just

1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:18.960
 an idea it's not just

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.960
 from from the very beginning to the very end

1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:22.960
 it's done

1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:24.960
 it has to be done there's no delaying

1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:26.960
 it's done and you've got deadlines

1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:28.960
 and that kind of

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.960
 rapid iteration pressure cooker

1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:32.960
 environment was super important

1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:34.960
 for all of us developing the skills

1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.960
 that I you know that brought us

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:38.960
 to where we eventually went to I mean

1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:40.960
 we would say like like in the history of the

1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:42.960
 Beatles like it wasn't them being the Beatles

1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:44.960
 it was them playing all of these other

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:46.960
 I am you know early works that that

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:48.960
 opportunity to craft all of their skills

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:50.960
 before they were famous that was

1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:52.960
 very critical to their later successes

1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:54.960
 and I think there's a lot of that here

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:56.960
 where we did these games that

1:28:56.960 --> 1:28:58.960
 nobody remembers lots

1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:00.960
 of little things that contributed

1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:02.960
 to building up the skill set for the things

1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:04.960
 that eventually did make us famous

1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:06.960
 and just to ask you wrote the

1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:08.960
 gambler I had to

1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:10.960
 write it in a month just

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:12.960
 make money and nobody

1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:14.960
 remembers that probably because he had to

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:16.960
 figure out because it's literally

1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:18.960
 he he didn't have enough

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:20.960
 time to write it fast enough

1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:22.960
 said to come up with hacks

1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:24.960
 literally comes down to that

1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:26.960
 point where pressure and limitation of

1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:28.960
 resources is surprisingly

1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:30.960
 important and it's

1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:32.960
 counterintuitive in a lot of ways where you just

1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:34.960
 think that if you've got all the time in the world

1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:36.960
 and you've got all the resources in the world

1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:38.960
 of course you're going to get something better

1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:40.960
 but sometimes it really does work out that

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.960
 the you know I

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.960
 innovations mother necessity and you know

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:46.960
 where you can resource constraints and you

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:48.960
 have to do things when you don't have a choice

1:29:48.960 --> 1:29:50.960
 it's surprising what you can do

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:52.960
 is there any good games written in that time

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:54.960
 would you say some of them are still fun to

1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:56.960
 go back and play where

1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:58.960
 you get the

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:00.960
 they were they were all about kind of the more

1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:02.960
 modern term is game feel about how

1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:04.960
 exact feel that things it's not the grand

1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:06.960
 strategy of the design but how

1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:08.960
 running and jumping and shooting and those

1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:10.960
 things I feel in the

1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:12.960
 in the moment and some of those are still

1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:14.960
 you if you sat down on them you kind of go

1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.960
 it's a little bit different it doesn't have the same

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:18.960
 movement feel but you move over and you're

1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:20.960
 like bang jump bang it's like

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:22.960
 hey that's kind of cool still

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:24.960
 so you can get lost in the rhythm of the

1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:26.960
 game like that is that what you mean by feel

1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:28.960
 just like

1:30:28.960 --> 1:30:30.960
 there's something about it that pulls you in

1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:32.960
 nowadays again people talk about

1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:34.960
 compulsion loops and things where it's that

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.960
 I am that sense of exactly

1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.960
 what you're doing what your fingers are doing on

1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:40.960
 the keyboard what your eyes are seeing

1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:42.960
 and they're going to be the sequences of things

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.960
 grab the loot shoot the monster jump over

1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.960
 the opposite will get to the end of the level

1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:48.960
 these are eternal aspects of game design

1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:50.960
 in a lot of ways but

1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:52.960
 there are better and worse ways to do all of

1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:54.960
 them and we did so many of these

1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:56.960
 games that it was I we got

1:30:56.960 --> 1:30:58.960
 a lot of practice with it

1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:00.960
 so one of the kind of weird things

1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:02.960
 that was happening at this time is

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:04.960
 John Romero was getting some

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:06.960
 some strange fan mail

1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:08.960
 and back in the days this was before email

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:10.960
 so we literally got letters sometimes

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.960
 and telling him it's like oh I

1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:14.960
 want to talk to you about your games I want to

1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:16.960
 reach out different things

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:18.960
 and eventually

1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:20.960
 it turned out that these were all coming

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:22.960
 from Scott Miller at Apigee Software

1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:24.960
 and

1:31:24.960 --> 1:31:26.960
 he was reaching out through he didn't think

1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:28.960
 he could contact John directly that he would

1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:30.960
 get intercepted so he was trying to get

1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:32.960
 him to contact him through like

1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:34.960
 back channel fan mail because he basically

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:36.960
 was saying hey I'm making all this money

1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:38.960
 on shareware games

1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:40.960
 I want you to make shareware games

1:31:40.960 --> 1:31:42.960
 because he had seen some of the games

1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:44.960
 that Romero had done

1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:46.960
 and you know we looked at

1:31:46.960 --> 1:31:48.960
 Scott Miller's games and we didn't think

1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:50.960
 they were very good I am we're like

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.960
 that can't be making the kind

1:31:52.960 --> 1:31:54.960
 of money that he's saying he's making 10 grand

1:31:54.960 --> 1:31:56.960
 thing I am off of this game

1:31:56.960 --> 1:31:58.960
 and we really thought that he was full

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:00.960
 of shit that it was a lie trying to

1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:02.960
 get to get him into this

1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.960
 but so that was kind of going on at

1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:06.960
 I am you know at one level

1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:08.960
 he was and it was funny the moment

1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:10.960
 when Romero realized that he had some

1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:12.960
 of these letters pinned up on his wall like all of

1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:14.960
 his fans and then we noticed that they all had the same

1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:16.960
 return address with different names on them

1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:18.960
 which was a little bit of a two inch sort

1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:20.960
 there trying to

1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:22.960
 figure out the puzzle laid out before

1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:24.960
 him yeah what happened after I kind of

1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:26.960
 coincident with that was

1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:28.960
 I was working on a lot of the new

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.960
 technologies where

1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:32.960
 I was now full on the IBM PC

1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:34.960
 for the first time where I was really

1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:36.960
 a long hold out on Apple 2 forever

1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:38.960
 and I you know I loved my Apple 2

1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:40.960
 it was the computer I was wished I had when I was

1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:42.960
 growing up and when I finally did have one

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:44.960
 I was I was kind of clinging on

1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:46.960
 to that well past it's sort of good use

1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:48.960
 by the best computer ever made you would you say

1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:50.960
 um I wouldn't

1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:52.960
 make judgments like that about it but it

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:54.960
 was positioned in such a way especially

1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:56.960
 in the school systems that it impacted

1:32:56.960 --> 1:32:58.960
 a whole lot of American

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:00.960
 programmers at least where

1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:02.960
 there was programs that the Apple 2's got

1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:04.960
 into the schools and they had enough

1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:06.960
 capability that lots of interesting things

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:08.960
 happened with them you know in Europe

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:10.960
 it was different you had your Amiga's and

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:12.960
 Atari's and you know I'm acorns

1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:14.960
 in the UK and things that

1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:16.960
 that had different things but in the United States

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:18.960
 it was probably the Apple 2 made the most

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.960
 impact for a lot

1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:22.960
 of programmers of my generation

1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:24.960
 but so I was really digging

1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:26.960
 into the IBM and this was

1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:28.960
 even more so with the total

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:30.960
 focus because I had moved to another city

1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:32.960
 where I didn't know anybody that I wasn't working

1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:34.960
 with I had a little apartment

1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:36.960
 and then at Softisk again the

1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:38.960
 things that that drew me to it I had

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:40.960
 a couple programmers that knew more than

1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:42.960
 I did and they had a

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.960
 library they had a set of books

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:46.960
 and a set of magazines they had a couple years

1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.960
 ago they had a set of magazines the old

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:50.960
 Dr. Dobbs Journal and all of these

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.960
 magazines that had information

1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:54.960
 about things and so

1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:56.960
 I was just in total immersion

1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:58.960
 mode it was Eat, Breathe, Sleep

1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:00.960
 computer programming particularly the IBM

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.960
 for everything that I was

1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:04.960
 doing and I was digging into

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:06.960
 a lot of these low level hardware details

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:08.960
 that people weren't usually paying

1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.960
 attention to the way the IBM

1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:12.960
 EGA cards worked

1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:14.960
 which was fun for me I hadn't

1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:16.960
 experienced with things at that level

1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:18.960
 and back then you could get

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:20.960
 hardware documentation just down at the register

1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:22.960
 levels this is where the CRTC

1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:24.960
 register is this is how the

1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:26.960
 color registers work and how the different things

1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:28.960
 are applied and they were designed

1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:30.960
 for a certain reason they were designed

1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:32.960
 for an application they had

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:34.960
 an intended use in mind but

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:36.960
 I was starting to look at other

1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:38.960
 ways that they could perhaps be exploited

1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:40.960
 that they weren't initially intended for

1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:42.960
 because you comment on like

1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:44.960
 how the operating system was there

1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:46.960
 what instructions said

1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:48.960
 what are we talking about?

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:50.960
 So this was DOS and X86

1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:52.960
 so 16 bit 8086

1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:54.960
 the two 86's were there and

1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:56.960
 three 86's existed they were rare

1:34:56.960 --> 1:34:58.960
 we had a couple for our development systems

1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:00.960
 but we were still targeting

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.960
 the more broad I

1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.960
 it was all DOS 16 bit

1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:06.960
 none of this was kind of DOS extenders

1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:08.960
 and things. How different is it from the systems

1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:10.960
 of today's it's kind of a precursor

1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:12.960
 that's similar? Very little

1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:14.960
 if you open up command.exe

1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:16.960
 on or com on

1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:18.960
 windows you see some of the remnants

1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:20.960
 of all of that but it was a different world

1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:22.960
 it was the 640k is enough

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:24.960
 world and nothing was

1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:26.960
 protected it crashed all the time you had

1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.960
 TSR's or terminate and stay

1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:30.960
 resident hacks on top of things

1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:32.960
 that would cause configuration problems

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:34.960
 all the hardware was manually

1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:36.960
 configured in your auto exec

1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:38.960
 so it was a very different world

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:40.960
 but the code is still the same similar

1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:42.960
 you would still write

1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:44.960
 my earliest code there was written in Pascal

1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:46.960
 that was what I had learned

1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:48.960
 between basic

1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:50.960
 and C++ there's Pascal

1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:52.960
 so when basic assembly language

1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:54.960
 some of my intermediate

1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:56.960
 stuff was well you had to for performance

1:35:56.960 --> 1:35:58.960
 basic was just too slow so

1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:00.960
 most of the work that I was doing as a contract

1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:02.960
 programmer in my teenage years

1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:04.960
 was assembly language

1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:06.960
 you wrote games in assembly?

1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:08.960
 yeah complete games

1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:10.960
 in assembly language

1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:12.960
 and it's thousands and thousands of lines

1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:14.960
 of three letter acronyms for the

1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:16.960
 instructions

1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:18.960
 you don't earn the once again

1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:20.960
 greatest programmer ever labeled

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:22.960
 without being able to write a game in assembly

1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:24.960
 that's again everybody wrote there

1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:26.960
 everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language

1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.960
 it was kind of a

1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:30.960
 everybody serious

1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:32.960
 it was an outlier to use

1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:34.960
 Pascal a little bit where there was one

1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:36.960
 famous program called wizardry

1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:38.960
 it was one of the great early role playing games

1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:40.960
 that was written in Pascal

1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:42.960
 but it was almost nothing used

1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:44.960
 Pascal there but I did learn Pascal

1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:46.960
 and I remember doing all of my

1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.960
 like to this day I sketch in data structures

1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:50.960
 when I'm thinking about something

1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:52.960
 I'll open up a file

1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:54.960
 and I'll start writing struct definitions

1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:56.960
 for how data is going to be laid out

1:36:56.960 --> 1:36:58.960
 and Pascal was kind of formative to that

1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.960
 because I remember designing my rpgs

1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:02.960
 in Pascal record structures

1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:04.960
 and things like that and so I had

1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:06.960
 I've gotten a Pascal compiler

1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:08.960
 for the Apple 2GS that I could work on

1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:10.960
 in the first IBM game that I developed

1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:12.960
 I did in Pascal and

1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:14.960
 and that's actually kind of an interesting story

1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:16.960
 again talking about the constraints and resources

1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:18.960
 where

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:20.960
 I had an Apple 2GS I didn't have an IBM PC

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.960
 I wanted to port my

1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:24.960
 applications to IBM because

1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:26.960
 I thought I could make more money on it

1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:28.960
 so what I wound up doing is

1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:30.960
 I rented a PC for a week

1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:32.960
 and bought a copy of Turbo Pascal

1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:34.960
 and so I had a hard

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:36.960
 one week and this was cutting into

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:38.960
 what minimal profit margin I had there

1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:40.960
 but I had this computer for a week

1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:42.960
 I had to get my program ported

1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:44.960
 before I had to return the PC

1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:46.960
 and that was kind of the first thing

1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:48.960
 that I had done on the IBM PC

1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:50.960
 and what led me to taking the job at Softisk

1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.960
 and Turbo Pascal

1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:54.960
 how's that different from regular Pascal

1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:56.960
 is it different compiler or something like that

1:37:56.960 --> 1:37:58.960
 so it was a product of Borland

1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:00.960
 before Microsoft kind of killed them

1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:02.960
 they were the hot stuff

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:04.960
 developer tools company

1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:06.960
 Borland, Turbo Pascal, Turbo C

1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:08.960
 and Turbo Prolog, I mean all the different things

1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:10.960
 but what they did was

1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:12.960
 they took a supremely pragmatic approach

1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:14.960
 of making something useful

1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.960
 it was one of these great examples where

1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.960
 Pascal was an academic language

1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:20.960
 and you had things like the UCSDP system

1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:22.960
 that Wizardry was actually

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.960
 written in that they did

1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:26.960
 they did manage to make a game with that

1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:28.960
 but it was

1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:30.960
 not a super practical system

1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:32.960
 while Turbo Pascal was

1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:34.960
 it was called Turbo because it was blazingly fast

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:36.960
 to compile I mean really ridiculously

1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:38.960
 10 to 20 times

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:40.960
 faster than most other compilers at the time

1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:42.960
 but it also had very

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:44.960
 pragmatic access to look you can just

1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:46.960
 poke at the hardware in these different ways

1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:48.960
 and we have libraries that let you do things

1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:50.960
 and it was a pretty good

1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:52.960
 it was a perfectly good way to write games

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.960
 and this is one of those things where people have talked about

1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:56.960
 different paths that computer

1:38:56.960 --> 1:38:58.960
 development could have taken

1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:00.960
 where C took over the world

1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:02.960
 for reasons that came out of Unix

1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:04.960
 and eventually Linux

1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:06.960
 and that was not a foregone conclusion at all

1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.960
 and people can make

1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:10.960
 real reasoned rational arguments

1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:12.960
 that the world might have been better

1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:14.960
 if it had gone a Pascal route

1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:16.960
 I'm somewhat agnostic on that

1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:18.960
 where I do know from experience

1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:20.960
 it was perfectly good enough to do

1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:22.960
 do that and it had some fundamental improvements

1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:24.960
 like it had range checked arrays

1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:26.960
 as an option there which could avoid

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:28.960
 many of C's

1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:30.960
 real hazards that happened in a security space

1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.960
 but C1

1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:34.960
 they were basically operating at about the same level of abstraction

1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:36.960
 it was a systems programming language

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:38.960
 but

1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:40.960
 but you said Pascal had more emphasis on data structures

1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:42.960
 actually

1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:44.960
 in the tree of languages

1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:46.960
 did Pascal come before C

1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:48.960
 they were pretty contemporaneous

1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:50.960
 so Pascal's lineage went to

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:52.960
 Modula 2 and eventually Oberon

1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:54.960
 which was another Nicholas word

1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:56.960
 kind of

1:39:56.960 --> 1:39:58.960
 experimental language

1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:00.960
 but they were all good enough at that level

1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:02.960
 now some of the classic

1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:04.960
 academic oriented Pascal's were just missing

1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:06.960
 fundamental things like oh you can't access

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:08.960
 this core system thing because we're just using it

1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:10.960
 to teach students but

1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:12.960
 Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:14.960
 to it really did make it

1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.960
 a completely capable language

1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:18.960
 and it had some reasons why

1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:20.960
 you could implement it as a single pass compiler

1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:22.960
 so it could be way way faster

1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:24.960
 although less scope for optimizations

1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:26.960
 if you do it that way

1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:28.960
 and it did have some range checking options

1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:30.960
 it had a little bit better typing capability

1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:32.960
 you'd have properly typed enums

1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:34.960
 sorts of things and other stuff that C lacked

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:36.960
 but C was also

1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:38.960
 clearly good enough and it wound up with

1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:40.960
 a huge inertia from the UNIX

1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:42.960
 ecosystem and everything that came with that

1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:44.960
 garbage collection

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:46.960
 no it was not garbage collected

1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:48.960
 so you could still have your use after freeze

1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:50.960
 and all those other problems

1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.960
 just getting rid of array overruns

1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:54.960
 at least if you were compiled with that

1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:56.960
 debugging option certainly would have avoided

1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:58.960
 a lot of problems and could have a lot of

1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:00.960
 benefits but so anyways that was the next

1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:02.960
 thing I had to learn C because C

1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:04.960
 was where it seemed like most of the

1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:06.960
 things were going

1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:08.960
 so I abandoned Pascal and I started working

1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:10.960
 in C I started hacking on these hardware

1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:12.960
 things dealing with

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:14.960
 the graphics controllers and the EGA systems

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:16.960
 and what we most

1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:18.960
 wanted to do so at that time

1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:20.960
 we had

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:22.960
 we were sitting in our darkened office playing

1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:24.960
 all the different console video games

1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:26.960
 and we were figuring out what do we want to

1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:28.960
 what games do we want to make for our

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:30.960
 gamers edge product there

1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:32.960
 and so we had one of the first Super

1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:34.960
 Nintendos sitting there and we had

1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:36.960
 an older Nintendo looking at all those

1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:38.960
 games and the core thing that those consoles

1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:40.960
 did that you just didn't get on the PC

1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:42.960
 games was this ability to have

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:44.960
 a massive scrolling world

1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:46.960
 where most of the games that you would make on the

1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:48.960
 PC and early

1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:50.960
 earlier personal computers would be a static

1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:52.960
 screen you move little things around on it

1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:54.960
 and you interact like that

1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:56.960
 maybe you go to additional screens as

1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:58.960
 you know as you move but

1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:00.960
 arcade games and consoles had this

1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:02.960
 wonderful ability to just have a big

1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:04.960
 world that you're slowly moving your

1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:06.960
 window through and that was

1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:08.960
 for those types of games that kind of action

1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:10.960
 exploration adventure games that was a

1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:12.960
 super super important thing

1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.960
 and PC games just didn't do

1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:16.960
 that and what I

1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:18.960
 had come across was a couple different

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:20.960
 techniques for implementing that

1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:22.960
 on the PC and they're not

1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:24.960
 hard complicated things

1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:26.960
 when I explain them now they're

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:28.960
 they're pretty straightforward but just nobody was doing

1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:30.960
 you sound like Einstein describing his

1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:32.960
 five papers is pretty straightforward

1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:34.960
 I understand but they're

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:36.960
 nevertheless revolutions so size scrolling

1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:38.960
 is a game changer

1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:40.960
 it's a genius invention

1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:42.960
 and some of the consoles had different

1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:44.960
 limitations about you could do one but not the

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:46.960
 other and there were similar things

1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:48.960
 going on as advancements even in the console

1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:50.960
 space where you'd have like the original

1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:52.960
 Mario game was

1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:54.960
 just horizontal scrolling and then later

1:42:54.960 --> 1:42:56.960
 Mario games added vertical aspects to

1:42:56.960 --> 1:42:58.960
 it and different things that

1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:00.960
 you were doing to explore

1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:02.960
 kind of expand the capabilities there

1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:04.960
 and so much of the early game design for

1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:06.960
 decades was removing limitations

1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:08.960
 letting you do things that you envisioned

1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:10.960
 as a designer you wanted the player to

1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:12.960
 experience but the hardware just

1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:14.960
 couldn't really or you didn't know

1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:16.960
 how to make it happen it felt

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:18.960
 impossible you can imagine

1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:20.960
 that you want to create like this

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:22.960
 big world through which you can

1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:24.960
 size scroll like through which you can

1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:26.960
 walk and then

1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:28.960
 you ask yourself a question how do I

1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:30.960
 actually build that in a way that's

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:32.960
 like the the latency

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:34.960
 is low enough the hardware

1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:36.960
 can actually deliver that

1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:38.960
 in such a way that it's a company

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:40.960
 and we knew what we wanted to do because

1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:42.960
 we were playing all of these console games

1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:44.960
 playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:46.960
 clearly there is a whole world of awesome

1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:48.960
 things there that we just couldn't do on

1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:50.960
 the PC at least initially

1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:52.960
 because every programmer can tell

1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:54.960
 it's like if you want to scroll you can just redraw

1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:56.960
 the whole screen but then it turns out well

1:43:56.960 --> 1:43:58.960
 you're going five frames per second

1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:00.960
 that's not an interactive fun experience

1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:02.960
 you want to be going 30 or 60

1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:04.960
 frames per second or something

1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:06.960
 and it just didn't feel like that was possible

1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:08.960
 it felt like the PCs had to get

1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:10.960
 five times faster for you to make

1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:12.960
 a playable game there

1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:14.960
 and interestingly I wound up with

1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:16.960
 two completely different solutions

1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:18.960
 for the scrolling problem

1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:20.960
 and this is

1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:22.960
 this is a theme that runs through everything

1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:24.960
 where all of these big technical advancements

1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:26.960
 it turns out there's always a couple

1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:28.960
 different ways of doing them and

1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:30.960
 it's not like you found the one true

1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:32.960
 way of doing it and we'll see this

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:34.960
 as we go into 3D games and things later

1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:36.960
 but so the scrolling

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:38.960
 the first set of scrolling tricks that I got

1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:40.960
 was

1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:42.960
 the hardware had this ability to

1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:44.960
 you could shift

1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:46.960
 like inside the window of memory

1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:48.960
 so the EGA cards at the time

1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:50.960
 had 256 kilobytes of memory

1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:52.960
 and it was

1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:54.960
 awkwardly set up in this planer format

1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:56.960
 where instead of

1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:58.960
 having 256 or

1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:00.960
 you know 24 million colors

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:02.960
 you had 16 colors which is 4 bits

1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:04.960
 so you had 4 bit planes

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:06.960
 64k a piece of course

1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:08.960
 64k is a nice round number

1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:10.960
 for 16 bit addressing

1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:12.960
 so your graphics card had a 16 bit

1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:14.960
 window that you could

1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:16.960
 look at and you could tell it to start

1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:18.960
 the video scan out anywhere inside there

1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:20.960
 so there were a couple games

1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:22.960
 that had taken this approach if you could make

1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:24.960
 a 2x2 screen or a 1x4 screen

1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:26.960
 and you could do scrolling

1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:28.960
 really easily like that you could just lay it

1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:30.960
 all out and just pan around there

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:32.960
 but you just couldn't make it any bigger

1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:34.960
 because that's all the memory that was there

1:45:34.960 --> 1:45:36.960
 the first insight to the scrolling

1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:38.960
 that I had was well

1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:40.960
 if we make a screen that's just

1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:42.960
 one tile larger you know and we usually

1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:44.960
 had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16

1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:46.960
 pixels the little classic Mario

1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:48.960
 block that you run into

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:50.960
 lots of art gets drawn that way

1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:52.960
 and your screen is a certain number of tiles

1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:54.960
 but if you had one little buffer region

1:45:54.960 --> 1:45:56.960
 outside of that

1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:58.960
 you could easily pan around inside that

1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:00.960
 16 pixel region that could be perfectly

1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:02.960
 smooth but then what happens

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:04.960
 if you get to the edge and you want to keep going

1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:06.960
 the first way we did

1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:08.960
 scrolling was what I called

1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:10.960
 adaptive tile refresh

1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:12.960
 which was really just a matter of you get

1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:14.960
 to the edge and then you go back

1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:16.960
 to the original point and then only

1:46:16.960 --> 1:46:18.960
 change the tiles that have

1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.960
 actually that are different between where

1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:22.960
 it was in most of the games at the time

1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:24.960
 if you think about sort of your

1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:26.960
 classic Super Mario Brothers game

1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:28.960
 you've got big fields of blue sky

1:46:28.960 --> 1:46:30.960
 long rows of

1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:32.960
 the same brick texture

1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:34.960
 and there's a lot of commonality

1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:36.960
 it's kind of like a data compression thing

1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:38.960
 if you take the screen and you set it down

1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:40.960
 on top of each other in general

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:42.960
 only about 10% of the tiles

1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:44.960
 were actually different there

1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:46.960
 so this was a way to

1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:48.960
 go ahead and say well I'm going to move it back

1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:50.960
 and then I'm only going to change those

1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:52.960
 10, 20, whatever percent

1:46:52.960 --> 1:46:54.960
 tiles there and that meant

1:46:54.960 --> 1:46:56.960
 that it was essentially five times

1:46:56.960 --> 1:46:58.960
 faster than if you were redrawing all of the

1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:00.960
 tiles and that worked well enough

1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:02.960
 for us to do a bunch of these games

1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:04.960
 for Gamers Edge

1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:06.960
 we had a lot of these scrolling games like

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:08.960
 Slurnax and Shadow Knights and things like

1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:10.960
 that that we were cranking out at this high

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:12.960
 rate that had this scrolling effect on it

1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:14.960
 and it worked well enough there were design

1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:16.960
 challenges there where

1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:18.960
 if you made the worst case if you made a

1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:20.960
 report over the entire screen

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:22.960
 you scroll over one and every single tile

1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:24.960
 changes and your frame rate is now five frames

1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:26.960
 per second because it had to redraw everything

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.960
 so the designers had a little bit

1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:30.960
 that they had to worry about they had to make

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:32.960
 these relatively plain looking levels

1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:34.960
 but it was still pretty magical

1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:36.960
 it was something that we hadn't seen before

1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:38.960
 and

1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:40.960
 the first thing that we wound up doing

1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:42.960
 with that was I had just gotten this

1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:44.960
 working and Tom Hall

1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:46.960
 was sitting there with me and

1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:48.960
 we were looking over at our Super Nintendo

1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:50.960
 on the side there with Super Mario

1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:52.960
 3 running and we had

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:54.960
 the technology we had the

1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:56.960
 tools set up there and we stayed up all night

1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.960
 and we basically cloned

1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:00.960
 the first level of Super Mario Brothers

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:02.960
 performance wise as well

1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:04.960
 and so it and we had our little character

1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:06.960
 running and jumping in there it wasn't

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:08.960
 it was close to pixel accurate as far as

1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:10.960
 all the backgrounds and everything

1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:12.960
 but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled

1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:14.960
 together from previous games that I had

1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:16.960
 written I just kind of like really

1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:18.960
 kick bash the whole thing together to make this demo

1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:20.960
 and that was one of the rare cases

1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:22.960
 when I said I don't usually do

1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:24.960
 these all night programming things

1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:26.960
 there's probably only two memorable ones

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:28.960
 that I can think about you know one

1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:30.960
 was the all nighter to go ahead and get

1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:32.960
 I am to get our dangerous Dave

1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:34.960
 and copyright infringement is how we

1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:36.960
 titled it because we had a game called dangerous Dave

1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:38.960
 was you know running around with the shotgun shooting

1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:40.960
 things I and we were

1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:42.960
 just taking our most beloved game at the time

1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:44.960
 there the Super Mario 3

1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:46.960
 and sort of sticking Dave inside that

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:48.960
 with this new scrolling technology that

1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:50.960
 was going perfectly smooth for

1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:52.960
 I am you know for them

1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:54.960
 as it ran and Tom

1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:56.960
 and I just kind of blurrily the next morning

1:48:56.960 --> 1:48:58.960
 you know kind of left and we left

1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:00.960
 a disc on I you know on the

1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:02.960
 desk for John Romero and Jay Wilbur

1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:04.960
 to see and just said run this

1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:06.960
 and we eventually made it back in

1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:08.960
 later in the day and

1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:10.960
 it was you know like they grabbed

1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:12.960
 us and pulled us in you know pulled us

1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:14.960
 into the room and that was the point where

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:16.960
 they were like we got to do something

1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:18.960
 with this you know we're we're going to make

1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:20.960
 a company we're going to go make our own

1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:22.960
 games where this was something that

1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:24.960
 we we were able to just kind of hit them

1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:26.960
 with a hammer of an experience like wow

1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:28.960
 this is just like so much cooler than

1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:30.960
 what we thought was possible

1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:32.960
 there and initially we tried

1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:34.960
 to get Nintendo to to let us make

1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:36.960
 Super Mario 3 on the PC

1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:38.960
 that's really what we wanted to do we're like

1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.960
 hey we can finish this it's line

1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:42.960
 of sight for this will be great

1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:44.960
 and we sent something to Nintendo

1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:46.960
 and we heard that it did get looked at

1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:48.960
 in Japan and they just

1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:50.960
 weren't interested in that

1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:52.960
 but that's another one of those life could have gone

1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:54.960
 a very different way where we could have been

1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:56.960
 like Nintendo's house PC team

1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:58.960
 you know at that point

1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:00.960
 and defined the direction of

1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:02.960
 you know

1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:04.960
 Wolfenstein

1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:06.960
 and Doom and Quake

1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:08.960
 has been a Nintendo creation

1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:10.960
 yeah so at the same time

1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:12.960
 that we were just doing our first scrolling

1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:14.960
 demos I'm

1:50:14.960 --> 1:50:16.960
 we reached out to Scott Miller at

1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:18.960
 Apigee and said it's like hey we do

1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:20.960
 want to make some games you know these things

1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:22.960
 that you think you want those are those are nothing

1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:24.960
 what do you see what we can actually do now this

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:26.960
 is going to be amazing and

1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:28.960
 he just like popped right up and sent a check

1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:30.960
 to us where we at that point

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:32.960
 we still thought he might be a fraud that

1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:34.960
 he was just lying about all of this but he

1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:36.960
 was totally correct on how much money

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:38.960
 he was making with his shareware titles

1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:40.960
 and this was his

1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:42.960
 his kind of real brainstorm about this

1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:44.960
 where shareware was this idea

1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:46.960
 that software doesn't have a fixed price

1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:48.960
 if you use it you send out of the goodness

1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:50.960
 of your heart some money to the creator

1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:52.960
 and there were a couple utilities

1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:54.960
 that did make some significant success

1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:56.960
 like that but for the most part

1:50:56.960 --> 1:50:58.960
 it didn't really work you know there wasn't

1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:00.960
 much software in a pure shareware

1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:02.960
 model that that was successful

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:04.960
 the apogee

1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:06.960
 innovation was to

1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:08.960
 take something call it shareware

1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:10.960
 split it into three pieces you always made a trilogy

1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:12.960
 and you would

1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:14.960
 put the first piece out but then you buy

1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:16.960
 the whole trilogy for

1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:18.960
 some shareware amount which in reality

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.960
 it meant that the first part was a demo

1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:22.960
 where you kind of like the demo went

1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:24.960
 everywhere for free and you paid money to

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.960
 to get the whole set but

1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:28.960
 it was still played as shareware and we were

1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:30.960
 happy to have the first one go everywhere

1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:32.960
 and it wasn't a crippled demo where the

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:34.960
 first episode of all these trilogies

1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:36.960
 it was a real complete game and probably

1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:38.960
 20 times as many people

1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:40.960
 played that part of it thought they had a great game

1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:42.960
 had found memories

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:44.960
 of it but never paid us a dime

1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:46.960
 but enough people

1:51:46.960 --> 1:51:48.960
 were happy with that where

1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:50.960
 it was really quite successful and these

1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:52.960
 early games that we didn't think very much

1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:54.960
 of compared to commercial quality

1:51:54.960 --> 1:51:56.960
 games but they were doing really good

1:51:56.960 --> 1:51:58.960
 business some fairly crude

1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:00.960
 things and people it was good

1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:02.960
 business people enjoyed it and

1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.960
 it wasn't like you were taking a crapshoot on what

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:06.960
 you were getting you just played a third of the

1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:08.960
 experience and you loved it enough

1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:10.960
 to hand write out a check

1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:12.960
 and put it in an envelope and address it

1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:14.960
 and send it out to Apogee

1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:16.960
 to get the rest of them so

1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:18.960
 it was a really pretty feel good

1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:20.960
 business prospect there because

1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:22.960
 everybody was happy

1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:24.960
 you know they knew what they were getting

1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:26.960
 when they send it in and they would send in

1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:28.960
 mail if you're going to the trouble of addressing

1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:30.960
 a letter and I am filling out

1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:32.960
 an envelope you write something in it and

1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:34.960
 there were just the literal bags of fan mail

1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:36.960
 for the shareware

1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:38.960
 games so people loved them

1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:40.960
 I should mention that for you

1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:42.960
 the definition of wealth is being

1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:44.960
 able to have pizza

1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:46.960
 whenever you want for me

1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:48.960
 there was a dream

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:50.960
 that would play shareware games over

1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:52.960
 and over the part that's free

1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:54.960
 over and over and it was very

1:52:54.960 --> 1:52:56.960
 deeply fulfilling experience but

1:52:56.960 --> 1:52:58.960
 I dreamed of a time where

1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:00.960
 I could actually afford

1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:02.960
 the full experience and this is kind of this

1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:04.960
 dreamland beyond

1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:06.960
 the horizon when you could

1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:08.960
 find out what else is there

1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:10.960
 in some sense

1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:12.960
 even just playing the shareware

1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:14.960
 was

1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:16.960
 the limitation of that

1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:18.960
 life is

1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:20.960
 limited eventually we all die

1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:22.960
 in that way shareware was

1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:24.960
 like

1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:26.960
 somehow really fulfilling

1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:28.960
 to have this kind of mysterious thing

1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:30.960
 beyond what's free

1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:32.960
 always there it's kind of

1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:34.960
 I don't know that maybe

1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:36.960
 it's because a part of my childhood is playing

1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:38.960
 shareware games that was a really fulfilling

1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:40.960
 experience it's so interesting how that model

1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:42.960
 still brought joy

1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:44.960
 to so many people the 20x

1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:46.960
 people that played it I felt very good about

1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:48.960
 that I would run into people it's like

1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:50.960
 that would say oh I loved that game

1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:52.960
 that you had early on Commander Keen

1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:54.960
 whatever and

1:53:54.960 --> 1:53:56.960
 and no they meant just the first

1:53:56.960 --> 1:53:58.960
 episode that they got to see everywhere

1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:00.960
 that's me I played the crap out of Commander Keen

1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:02.960
 and that was all good

1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:04.960
 yeah

1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:06.960
 so we were in this position where Scott Miller

1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:08.960
 was just fronting us cash and saying yeah

1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:10.960
 make a game but

1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:12.960
 we did not properly

1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:14.960
 pull the trigger and say alright

1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:16.960
 we're quitting our jobs we were like

1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:18.960
 we're gonna do both we're gonna keep working

1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:20.960
 at soft disk working on this

1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:22.960
 and then we're going to go ahead

1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:24.960
 and make a new game for

1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:26.960
 Apogee at the same time

1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:28.960
 and this eventually did lead to some legal

1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:30.960
 problems and we had we had trouble

1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:32.960
 it all got worked out in the end but

1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:34.960
 it was not a good call at the time

1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:36.960
 there and your legal mind at the time was not

1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:38.960
 stellar

1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:40.960
 you you were not thinking

1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:42.960
 in terms of the illegal no I

1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:44.960
 I definitely wasn't none of us were

1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:46.960
 I and in hindsight

1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:48.960
 yeah it's like how did we think we were going to get away

1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:50.960
 with like even using our work computers

1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:52.960
 to write write software for

1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.960
 you know our our breakaway

1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:56.960
 new company it was

1:54:56.960 --> 1:54:58.960
 not a good plan how did Commander

1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:00.960
 Keen come to be

1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:02.960
 so the design process

1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:04.960
 we would start from we had some idea of what

1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:06.960
 we wanted to do we wanted to do a

1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:08.960
 Mario like game it was going to be a side

1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:10.960
 scroller I was going to use the technology

1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:12.960
 we we had some sense

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:14.960
 of what it would have to look like because of the limitations

1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:16.960
 of this adaptive tile refresh

1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:18.960
 technology it had to have

1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:20.960
 fields of relatively constant tiles

1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:22.960
 you couldn't just paint up a background

1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:24.960
 and then move that around

1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:26.960
 I the early design

1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:28.960
 or all the design for Commander Keen really came

1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:30.960
 from Tom Hall where

1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:32.960
 he was

1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:34.960
 the main creative mind

1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:36.960
 for the early in software stuff

1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:38.960
 where we had an interesting division of things where

1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:40.960
 Tom was

1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:42.960
 all creative and design I was all

1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:44.960
 programming John Romero was an interesting

1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:46.960
 bridge where he was both a very good

1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:48.960
 programmer and also very good designer

1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:50.960
 and artist and kind of straddled

1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:52.960
 between the areas but Commander

1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:54.960
 Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby

1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:56.960
 and

1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:58.960
 he came up with all the design and

1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:00.960
 backstory for the different things of kind of

1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:02.960
 a mad scientist little kid

1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:04.960
 with I am

1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:06.960
 building a rocket ship and a zap gun

1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:08.960
 and visiting alien worlds

1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:10.960
 and doing all this that the

1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:12.960
 background that we lay the game inside

1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:14.960
 of and there's not

1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:16.960
 a whole lot to any of these things you know

1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:18.960
 design for us was always just what we

1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:20.960
 needed to do to make the game that was

1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:22.960
 going to be so much fun to play

1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:24.960
 and we made our we laid out

1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:26.960
 our first trilogy of games you know

1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:28.960
 the shareware formula it's going to be

1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:30.960
 three pieces we make Commander Keen one

1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:32.960
 two and three and we just really

1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:34.960
 started

1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:36.960
 busting on all that work and it went together

1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.960
 really quickly it was like three months

1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:40.960
 and it was something that while we were

1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:42.960
 still making games every month

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:44.960
 for Gamers Edge we were sharing

1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:46.960
 technology between that I'd write a bunch

1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:48.960
 of code for this and we just kind of use it

1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:50.960
 for both again not a particularly good

1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:52.960
 idea there that had consequences for us

1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:54.960
 but

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:56.960
 in three months we got our first our

1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:58.960
 first game out and all of a sudden it

1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:00.960
 was three times as successful as

1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:02.960
 the most successful thing Apogee had had

1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:04.960
 before and we were making like $30,000

1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:06.960
 a month

1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:08.960
 from the Commander Keen stuff

1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:10.960
 and that was again a surprise

1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:12.960
 to us it was more than we thought that

1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:14.960
 was going to that that was going to make

1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:16.960
 and we said well we're going to certainly

1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:18.960
 roll into another set of titles

1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:20.960
 from this and in that three months

1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:22.960
 I had come up with a much better way

1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:24.960
 of doing the scrolling technology that

1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:26.960
 was not the adaptive tile refresh

1:57:26.960 --> 1:57:28.960
 which in some ways was even simpler

1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:30.960
 and these things

1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:32.960
 so many of the great ideas of technology

1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:34.960
 are things that are back at the envelope

1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:36.960
 designs I make this comment

1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:38.960
 about modern machine learning where

1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:40.960
 all the things that are really important

1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:42.960
 practically in the last decade are each

1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:44.960
 of them fits on the back of an envelope

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:46.960
 there are these simple little things

1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:48.960
 they're not super dense hard to

1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:50.960
 understand technologies

1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:52.960
 and so the the second scrolling

1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:54.960
 trick was just a matter of like

1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:56.960
 okay we know we've got this 64k

1:57:56.960 --> 1:57:58.960
 window

1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:00.960
 and the question was always like well you could

1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:02.960
 make a 2x2 but you can't

1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:04.960
 go off the edge

1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:06.960
 but I finally asked well what actually

1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:08.960
 happens if you just go off the

1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:10.960
 edge if you take your start

1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:12.960
 and you say it's like okay

1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:14.960
 I can move over I'm scrolling I can move

1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:16.960
 over I can move down I'm scrolling

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:18.960
 I get to what should be the bottom of the memory

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:20.960
 window it's like well what if I just

1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:22.960
 keep going and I say I'm going to start

1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:24.960
 at you know what happens if I start

1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:26.960
 at FFFE at the very

1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:28.960
 end of the 64k block

1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:30.960
 and it turns out it just

1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:32.960
 wraps back around to the top of the block

1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:34.960
 and I'm like oh well this makes

1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:36.960
 everything easy you can just scroll

1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:38.960
 the screen everywhere and all you have to draw

1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:40.960
 is just one new line of tiles

1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:42.960
 which everything you expose it might be

1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:44.960
 unaligned off various parts

1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:46.960
 of the screen memory

1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:48.960
 but it just works that no longer

1:58:48.960 --> 1:58:50.960
 had the problem of you had to have fields

1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.960
 of the similar colors because

1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:54.960
 it doesn't matter what you're doing you could be

1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:56.960
 having a completely unique world

1:58:56.960 --> 1:58:58.960
 and you're just drawing the new strip

1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:00.960
 that comes on but it might be

1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:02.960
 like you said unaligned

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:04.960
 so it can be all over the place and it turns out

1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:06.960
 it doesn't matter I would have two page flipped

1:59:06.960 --> 1:59:08.960
 screens as long as they didn't overlap they moved

1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:10.960
 in series through this

1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:12.960
 two dimensional window of graphics

1:59:12.960 --> 1:59:14.960
 and that was one of those like well

1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:16.960
 this is so simple this just

1:59:16.960 --> 1:59:18.960
 this just works it's faster

1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:20.960
 I am there it seemed like there was no

1:59:20.960 --> 1:59:22.960
 downside funny thing was

1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:24.960
 I it turned out after we shipped

1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:26.960
 titles with this there were

1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:28.960
 what they called super VGA

1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:30.960
 cards the cards that would allow higher

1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:32.960
 resolutions and I and

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:34.960
 different features that the standard ones didn't

1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:36.960
 and on some of those

1:59:36.960 --> 1:59:38.960
 cards this was a weird

1:59:38.960 --> 1:59:40.960
 compatibility cork again because nobody thought

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:42.960
 this was not what it was designed to do

1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:44.960
 and some of those cards had more

1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:46.960
 memory they had more than just

1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:48.960
 256k in four planes they had

1:59:48.960 --> 1:59:50.960
 512k or a megabyte

1:59:50.960 --> 1:59:52.960
 and on some of those cards

1:59:52.960 --> 1:59:54.960
 I scroll my window down

1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:56.960
 and then it goes into uninitialized

1:59:56.960 --> 1:59:58.960
 memory that actually exists there

1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:00.960
 rather than wrapping back around at the top

2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:02.960
 and then

2:00:02.960 --> 2:00:04.960
 I was in the tough position of do I have to

2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:06.960
 track every single one of these and it was a mad

2:00:06.960 --> 2:00:08.960
 house back then with there were

2:00:08.960 --> 2:00:10.960
 20 different video card vendors with

2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:12.960
 all slightly different implementations of

2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:14.960
 their non standard functionality

2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:16.960
 so either I needed to natively

2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:18.960
 program all of the the VGA

2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:20.960
 cards there to

2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:22.960
 map in that memory and keep scrolling

2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:24.960
 down through all of that or I kind

2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:26.960
 of punted and took the easy solution

2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:28.960
 of when you finally did run to the

2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:30.960
 edge of the screen I accepted

2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:32.960
 a hitch and just copied the whole screen up

2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:34.960
 there so on some of those

2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:36.960
 those cards it was

2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:38.960
 a compatibility mode in the normal ones

2:00:38.960 --> 2:00:40.960
 when it all worked fine everything was just

2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:42.960
 beautifully smooth but if you had one of those

2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:44.960
 cards where it did not wrap the way

2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:46.960
 I wanted it to you'd be

2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:48.960
 scrolling around scrolling around and

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:50.960
 then eventually you'd have a little hitch where

2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:52.960
 200 milliseconds or something

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:54.960
 that was not super smooth as it

2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:56.960
 froze a little bit and this was the binary

2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:58.960
 thing is it one of the standard

2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:00.960
 screens or isn't one of the weird ones

2:01:00.960 --> 2:01:02.960
 the super VGA one yeah okay

2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:04.960
 and so we would default to and I think

2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:06.960
 that was one of those that changed over

2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:08.960
 the kind of course of deployment where

2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:10.960
 early on we would have a normal mode

2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:12.960
 and then you would have you would enable the compatibility

2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:14.960
 flag if your screen did this crazy

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:16.960
 flickery thing when you got to a certain

2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:18.960
 point in the game and then

2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:20.960
 later I think it probably got enabled by default

2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:22.960
 as just more and more of the cards

2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:24.960
 I kind of did not do exactly

2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:26.960
 the right thing and that's the two edge

2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.960
 sword of doing unconventional

2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:30.960
 things with technology where

2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:32.960
 you can find something that nobody thought about

2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:34.960
 doing that kind of scrolling trick when they

2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:36.960
 set up those cards but

2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:38.960
 the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason

2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:40.960
 when I was relying on that then

2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:42.960
 I wound up being broken on some of the later

2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:44.960
 cards let me take a bit

2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:46.960
 of a tangent but

2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:48.960
 ask you about the hacker

2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:50.960
 ethic because you mentioned shareware

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:52.960
 it's an interesting world

2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:54.960
 the world of people

2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:56.960
 that make money

2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:58.960
 business and the people that

2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:00.960
 build systems the engineers

2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:02.960
 and

2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:04.960
 what is the hacker

2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:06.960
 ethic you've been a man

2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:08.960
 of the people and you've

2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:10.960
 embodied at least the part of that

2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:12.960
 ethic what does it mean

2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:14.960
 what did it mean to you at the time what does it mean to

2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:16.960
 you today so Steven Levy's

2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:18.960
 book hackers was a really

2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:20.960
 formative book for me as a teenager

2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:22.960
 I mean I read it several

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:24.960
 times and there was

2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:26.960
 all of the great lore of the early

2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:28.960
 MIT era of hackers

2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:30.960
 ending up at the end with

2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:32.960
 it kind of went through the early

2:02:32.960 --> 2:02:34.960
 MIT hackers and the Silicon Valley

2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:36.960
 hardware hackers and then

2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:38.960
 the game hackers in part 3

2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:40.960
 and at that time as a teenager

2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:42.960
 I really

2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:44.960
 was kind of bitter in some ways

2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:46.960
 I thought I was born too late

2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:48.960
 I thought I missed the window

2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:50.960
 there and I really thought I

2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:52.960
 belonged in that third section of that

2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:54.960
 book with the game hackers and they were talking

2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:56.960
 about the Williams at Sierra

2:02:56.960 --> 2:02:58.960
 and Origin Systems with Richard Garriott

2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:00.960
 and it's like

2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:02.960
 I really wanted to be there

2:03:02.960 --> 2:03:04.960
 and I knew that was now

2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:06.960
 a few years in the past it was

2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:08.960
 not to be

2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:10.960
 but the early days

2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:12.960
 early MIT hacker days talking

2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:14.960
 a lot about this sense of

2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:16.960
 the hacker ethic that there was this sense

2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:18.960
 that it was about

2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:20.960
 sharing information being good

2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:22.960
 not keeping it to yourself and

2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:24.960
 that it's not a zero sum game

2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:26.960
 that you can share something

2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:28.960
 with another programmer and it doesn't

2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:30.960
 take it away from you

2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:32.960
 you then have somebody else doing something

2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:34.960
 and I also think that there's

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:36.960
 an aspect of it where it's

2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:38.960
 this ability to take

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:40.960
 joy in other people's accomplishments

2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:42.960
 where it's not the cutthroat bit of

2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:44.960
 like I have to be first I have to be

2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:46.960
 recognized as the one

2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:48.960
 that did this in some way but

2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:50.960
 being able to see somebody else

2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:52.960
 do something and say holy shit that's amazing

2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:54.960
 you know and just taking joy

2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:56.960
 in the ability of something amazing

2:03:56.960 --> 2:03:58.960
 that somebody else does

2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:00.960
 and the

2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:02.960
 big thing that I was able to do

2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:04.960
 through in software was

2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:06.960
 this ability to eventually release the source code

2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:08.960
 for most of our like all of our really

2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:10.960
 seminal game titles and that

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:12.960
 was a it was a stepping stone

2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:14.960
 process where we were

2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:16.960
 kind of surprised early on where

2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:18.960
 people were able to

2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:20.960
 hack the existing games and of course I had

2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:22.960
 experience with that I remember hacking my copies

2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:24.960
 of Ultima so I give myself you know

2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:26.960
 9999 gold and raise my levels

2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:28.960
 and you know break out the sector editor

2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:30.960
 and so I was familiar with all of that

2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:32.960
 so it was just it was with a smile

2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:34.960
 when I started to see people doing that to our

2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:36.960
 games I am you know making

2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:38.960
 level editors for Commander Keen

2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:40.960
 or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D

2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:42.960
 but I made

2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:44.960
 the pitch internally

2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:46.960
 that we should actually release our own

2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:48.960
 tools for like what we did

2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:50.960
 what we used to create the games

2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:52.960
 and that was you know that was

2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:54.960
 a little bit debatable about

2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:56.960
 well you know will this let other will

2:04:56.960 --> 2:04:58.960
 give people a leg up it's always like what's that

2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:00.960
 going to mean for the competition

2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:02.960
 but the really hard pitch

2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:04.960
 was to actually release the full

2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:06.960
 source code for the games

2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:08.960
 and it was a balancing act with

2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:10.960
 the other people inside the company

2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:12.960
 where it's

2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:14.960
 interesting how the programmers

2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.960
 generally did get

2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:18.960
 certainly I am the people

2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:20.960
 that I worked closely with they did kind of

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:22.960
 get that hacker ethic bit where

2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:24.960
 you wanted to share your code you were

2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:26.960
 you were proud of it you wanted other people to take it

2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:28.960
 do cool things with it

2:05:28.960 --> 2:05:30.960
 but interestingly

2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:32.960
 the broader

2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:34.960
 game industry is a little more

2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:36.960
 hesitant to embrace that than

2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:38.960
 like the group of people that we happen to have

2:05:38.960 --> 2:05:40.960
 at id software where it was

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:42.960
 always a little interesting to me seeing how

2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:44.960
 a lot of people in the game modding

2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:46.960
 community were very possessive

2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:48.960
 of their code they did not want to share their

2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:50.960
 code they wanted it to be theirs it was their

2:05:50.960 --> 2:05:52.960
 you know claim to fame and that

2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:54.960
 was much more like what we tended

2:05:54.960 --> 2:05:56.960
 to see with artists where you know the

2:05:56.960 --> 2:05:58.960
 artists understand something about credit

2:05:58.960 --> 2:06:00.960
 and I you know wanting it to be known

2:06:00.960 --> 2:06:02.960
 as their work and a lot of the

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:04.960
 game programmers

2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:06.960
 felt a little bit more like artists

2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:08.960
 than like hacker programmers in that it was

2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:10.960
 about building something that

2:06:10.960 --> 2:06:12.960
 maybe felt more like art to them than

2:06:12.960 --> 2:06:14.960
 the more tool based and

2:06:14.960 --> 2:06:16.960
 exploration based kind of

2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:18.960
 hacking culture side of things

2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:20.960
 it's so interesting that this kind of

2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:24.960
 fear that credit will not be

2:06:24.960 --> 2:06:26.960
 sufficiently attributed to you

2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:28.960
 and that's one of the things that I do

2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:30.960
 bump into a lot because

2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:32.960
 I try not

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:34.960
 to go I mean it's easy for

2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:36.960
 me to say because so much credit is heaped on

2:06:36.960 --> 2:06:38.960
 me for the id software side of

2:06:38.960 --> 2:06:40.960
 things but when people come up and

2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:42.960
 they want to pick a fight and say no it's

2:06:42.960 --> 2:06:44.960
 like that wasn't where first person gaming

2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:46.960
 came from and you can point to

2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:48.960
 you know you can point to some of like things

2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:50.960
 on obscure titles that I was never aware

2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:52.960
 of or like the old Play Doh systems

2:06:52.960 --> 2:06:54.960
 or you know each personal computer

2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:56.960
 had something that was 3D

2:06:56.960 --> 2:06:58.960
 and moving around and I'm

2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:00.960
 you know and I'm happy to say it's like no

2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:02.960
 I mean I saw Battlezone and Star Wars

2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:04.960
 in the arcades I had seen 3D graphics

2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:06.960
 I had seen all these things they're

2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:08.960
 standing on the shoulders of lots of other people

2:07:08.960 --> 2:07:10.960
 but sometimes these examples they pull out

2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:12.960
 like I didn't know that existed I mean

2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:14.960
 there I had never heard of that before

2:07:14.960 --> 2:07:16.960
 then that didn't contribute to

2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:18.960
 what I made but there's plenty of stuff that

2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:20.960
 did and you know I

2:07:20.960 --> 2:07:22.960
 I think there's good cases to be made

2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:24.960
 that obviously Doom and Quake

2:07:24.960 --> 2:07:26.960
 and Wolfenstein were formative examples

2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:28.960
 for what

2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:30.960
 everything that came after

2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:32.960
 that but I don't feel

2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:34.960
 the need to go fight and say claim

2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:36.960
 primacy or initial invention

2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:38.960
 of anything like that but a lot of people

2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:40.960
 do want to. I think when you fight

2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:42.960
 for the credit in that way

2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:44.960
 and it does go against the hacker ethic

2:07:44.960 --> 2:07:46.960
 you destroy

2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:48.960
 something fundamental about the culture, about the

2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:50.960
 community that builds cool stuff

2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:52.960
 I think credit ultimately

2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:54.960
 so

2:07:54.960 --> 2:07:56.960
 I had this

2:07:56.960 --> 2:07:58.960
 sort of there's a famous

2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:00.960
 wrestler and freestyle wrestling

2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:02.960
 called

2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:04.960
 and he always preached

2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:06.960
 that you should just focus

2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:08.960
 on the art of the wrestling

2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:10.960
 and let people

2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:12.960
 write

2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:14.960
 your story however they want

2:08:14.960 --> 2:08:16.960
 the

2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:18.960
 the highest form of the art is just

2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:20.960
 focusing on the art and that's something

2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:22.960
 that is something about the

2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:24.960
 hacker ethic is just

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:26.960
 focus on building cool stuff

2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:28.960
 sharing it with other cool people

2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:30.960
 and credit will get

2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:32.960
 assigned correctly

2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:36.960
 in the long arc of history

2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:38.960
 and I generally think that's true

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:40.960
 and you've got

2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:42.960
 you know like there's some things

2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:44.960
 there's a graphics technique that got labeled

2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:46.960
 car max reverse

2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:48.960
 literally named it and it turned out

2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:50.960
 that I wasn't the first person to figure

2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:52.960
 that out like most scientific

2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:54.960
 things or mathematical things you might have

2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:56.960
 like oh this other person had actually done that

2:08:56.960 --> 2:08:58.960
 somewhat before and then there's

2:08:58.960 --> 2:09:00.960
 things that get attributed to me like the inverse

2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:02.960
 square root hack that I actually didn't

2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:04.960
 do I flat out that wasn't me and it's like

2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:06.960
 it's weird how the memetic power

2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:08.960
 of the internet I cannot

2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:10.960
 convince people of that

2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:12.960
 everything just gets attributed to you now

2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.960
 even though you've never

2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:16.960
 sought that the credit of things

2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:18.960
 I mean but part

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:20.960
 of the fact that the humility behind

2:09:20.960 --> 2:09:22.960
 that is what attracts the

2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:24.960
 attributions

2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:26.960
 let's talk about a game

2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:28.960
 you mean one of the greatest games ever made

2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:30.960
 I know you could talk about doing quake

2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:32.960
 and so on but to me Wolfenstein 3D was like

2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:34.960
 whoa

2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:36.960
 it blew my mind

2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:38.960
 that a world like this could exist so

2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:40.960
 how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be

2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:42.960
 in terms of the programming

2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:44.960
 in terms of the design in terms of some of the

2:09:44.960 --> 2:09:46.960
 memorable technical challenges

2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:48.960
 and also

2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:50.960
 actually just something you haven't mentioned

2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:52.960
 you know

2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:54.960
 how did these ideas

2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:56.960
 come to be

2:09:56.960 --> 2:09:58.960
 inside your mind the adaptive

2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:00.960
 side scrolling so

2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:02.960
 the solutions to these technical challenges

2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:04.960
 so I usually can

2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:06.960
 introspectively pull back

2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:08.960
 pretty detailed

2:10:08.960 --> 2:10:10.960
 accounts of how technology solutions

2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:12.960
 and design choices on my part

2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:14.960
 came to be where

2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:16.960
 technically we had done two games

2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:18.960
 3D games like that before

2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:20.960
 where hover tank was the first one

2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:22.960
 which had flat shaded walls

2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:24.960
 but did have the scaled enemies inside it

2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:26.960
 and then catacombs 3D

2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:28.960
 which had textured walls

2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:30.960
 scaled enemies and

2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:32.960
 some more

2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:34.960
 some more functionality like the

2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:36.960
 disappearing walls and some other stuff

2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:38.960
 but what's really interesting from a

2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:40.960
 game development standpoint is

2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:42.960
 those games catacombs 3D

2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:44.960
 hover tank and Wolfenstein

2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:46.960
 they literally used

2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:48.960
 the same code for

2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:50.960
 a lot of the character behavior that a 2D

2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:52.960
 game that I had made earlier called catacombs

2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:54.960
 did where

2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:56.960
 it was an overhead view game kind of like gauntlet

2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:58.960
 you're running around and you can open up doors

2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:00.960
 pick up items basic game stuff

2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:02.960
 and the thought was

2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:04.960
 that this exact same

2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:06.960
 game experience just

2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:08.960
 presented in a different perspective

2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:10.960
 it could be literally the same game

2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:12.960
 just with a different view into it

2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:14.960
 would have a dramatically different

2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:16.960
 impact on the players

2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:18.960
 so it wasn't

2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:20.960
 a true 3D you're saying that

2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:22.960
 you can kind of take it

2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:24.960
 you can scale enemies meaning things that are

2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:26.960
 farther away you can make them smaller

2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:28.960
 so from the game was

2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:30.960
 a 2D map like all of our games

2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:32.960
 use the same tool for creation

2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:34.960
 we use the same map editor for creating

2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:36.960
 keen as Wolfenstein and

2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:38.960
 hevertank and catacombs and all this stuff

2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:40.960
 so the game was a 2D grid

2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:42.960
 made out of blocks and you

2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:44.960
 could say well these are walls these are where

2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:46.960
 the enemies start then they start moving around

2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:48.960
 and these early games like catacombs

2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:50.960
 you played it strictly in a 2D view

2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:52.960
 it was a scrolling 2D view

2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:54.960
 and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh

2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:56.960
 at the time to be able to do something

2:11:56.960 --> 2:11:58.960
 like that and then

2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:00.960
 the thought that these early

2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:02.960
 games all it did was take the same

2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:04.960
 basic enemy logic but

2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:06.960
 instead of seeing it from the god's eye view

2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:08.960
 on top you were inside it

2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:10.960
 and turning from side to side yawing

2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:12.960
 your view and moving forwards and backwards

2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:14.960
 and side to side and

2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:16.960
 it's a striking thing where you always talk

2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:18.960
 about wanting to isolate and factor changes

2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:20.960
 in values and this was one of those

2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:22.960
 most pure cases there where

2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:24.960
 the rest of the game changed very little

2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:26.960
 it was our normal kind of change the colors

2:12:26.960 --> 2:12:28.960
 on something and draw a different picture

2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:30.960
 for it but it's kind of the same thing

2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:32.960
 but the perspective changed in a really

2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:34.960
 fundamental way and

2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:36.960
 it was dramatically different

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:38.960
 I can remember the reactions

2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:40.960
 where the artist Adrian

2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:42.960
 that had been drawing the pictures for

2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.960
 we had a cool big troll thing in catacombs 3D

2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:46.960
 and we had these walls

2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:48.960
 that you could get a key and you could make

2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:50.960
 the blocks disappear and really simple stuff

2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.960
 blocks could either be there or not there

2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:54.960
 so our idea of a door was

2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:56.960
 being able to make a set of blocks just disappear

2:12:56.960 --> 2:12:58.960
 and I remember the reaction

2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:00.960
 when he had drawn these characters and he was slowly

2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:02.960
 moving around and people

2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:04.960
 had no experience with 3D navigation

2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:06.960
 it was all still keyboard, we didn't even have mice

2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:08.960
 set up at that time

2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:10.960
 but slowly moving, going up

2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:12.960
 picked up a key, go to a wall

2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:14.960
 the wall disappears in a little animation

2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:16.960
 and there's a monster right there

2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:18.960
 and he practically fell out of his chair

2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:20.960
 and games just

2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:22.960
 didn't do that

2:13:22.960 --> 2:13:24.960
 the games were the gods eye view

2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:26.960
 you were a little invested in your little guy

2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:28.960
 you know, happy or sad when things

2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:30.960
 happened but you just did not get that

2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:32.960
 kind of startle reaction

2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:34.960
 something in your face, something in the back of your brain

2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:36.960
 some reptile brain thing

2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:38.960
 is just going oh shit, something just happened

2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:40.960
 and that was one of those

2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:42.960
 early points where it's like yeah

2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:44.960
 this is going to make a difference

2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:46.960
 this is going to be powerful and it's going to matter

2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:48.960
 were you able to imagine that

2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:50.960
 in the idea stage or no

2:13:50.960 --> 2:13:52.960
 so not that exact thing

2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:54.960
 so again, we had cases

2:13:54.960 --> 2:13:56.960
 like the arcade games battle zone

2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:58.960
 and star wars that you could kind of

2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:00.960
 see a 3D world and things coming at you

2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:02.960
 and you get some sense of it

2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:04.960
 but nothing had done the kind

2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:06.960
 of worlds that we were doing and the sort of

2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:08.960
 action based things, 3D

2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:10.960
 at the time was

2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:12.960
 really largely about the simulation

2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:14.960
 thoughts and this is something

2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:16.960
 that really might have

2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:18.960
 trended differently if not for

2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:20.960
 the id software approach in the games

2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:22.960
 where there were flight simulators

2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:24.960
 there were driving simulators

2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:26.960
 you had like hard drive in

2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:28.960
 and Microsoft flight simulator

2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:30.960
 and these were doing 3D and general purpose

2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:32.960
 3D in ways that were

2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:34.960
 more flexible than what we were doing with our

2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:36.960
 games but they were looked at as

2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:38.960
 simulations, they weren't trying to

2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:40.960
 necessarily be fast or responsive

2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:42.960
 or letting you do

2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:44.960
 kind of exciting maneuvers

2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:46.960
 because they were trying to simulate reality

2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:48.960
 and they were taking their cues from the big systems

2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:50.960
 the Evans in Sutherland and the silicon

2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:52.960
 graphics that were doing things

2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:54.960
 but we were taking our cues from

2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:56.960
 the console and arcade games

2:14:56.960 --> 2:14:58.960
 we wanted things that were

2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:00.960
 sort of quarter eaters that were doing fast

2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:02.960
 pace things that you could smack you around

2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:04.960
 rather than just smoothly gliding you

2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:06.960
 from place to place

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:08.960
 quarter eaters

2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:10.960
 and you know a funny thing is

2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:12.960
 so much that that built into us

2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:14.960
 that Wolfenstein still had

2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:16.960
 lives and you had like one of the biggest power ups

2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:18.960
 in all these games like was an extra life

2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:20.960
 because you started off with 3 lives

2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:22.960
 and you lose your lives and then it's game over

2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:24.960
 and there weren't save games in

2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:26.960
 most of this stuff

2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:28.960
 it sounds almost crazy to say this

2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:30.960
 but it was an innovation in DOOM

2:15:30.960 --> 2:15:32.960
 to not have lives

2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:34.960
 you could just play DOOM as long as you wanted

2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.960
 you just restart at the start of the level

2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:38.960
 and why not?

2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:40.960
 we aren't trying to take people's quarters

2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:42.960
 they've already paid for the entire game

2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:44.960
 we want them to have a good time

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:46.960
 and you would have some

2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:48.960
 I think that there's something to the epic journey

2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:50.960
 of making it to the end having to restart

2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:52.960
 all the way from the beginning after a certain number

2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:54.960
 of tries but now more fun is had

2:15:54.960 --> 2:15:56.960
 when you just let people kind of keep trying

2:15:56.960 --> 2:15:58.960
 when they're stuck rather than having to go

2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:00.960
 all the way back and learn different things

2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:02.960
 so you've recommended the

2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:04.960
 game engine black book Wolfenstein 3D

2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:06.960
 for technical exploration of the game

2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:08.960
 so looking back

2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:10.960
 30 years

2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:12.960
 what are some memorable technical innovations

2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:14.960
 that made this perspective

2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:16.960
 shift into this world that's

2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:18.960
 so immersive that scares you when a monster appears

2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:20.960
 or some things you have to solve?

2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:22.960
 so one of the interesting things

2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:24.960
 that come back to the theme of

2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:26.960
 deadlines and resource constraints

2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:28.960
 the game catacombs 3D

2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:30.960
 we shipped

2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:32.960
 we were supposed to be shipping this for gamers edge

2:16:32.960 --> 2:16:34.960
 on a monthly cadence and I had

2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:36.960
 slipped I was actually

2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:38.960
 late it slipped like six weeks because

2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:40.960
 this was texture mapped walls

2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.960
 doing stuff that I hadn't done before

2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:44.960
 and

2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:46.960
 at the six week point it was

2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:48.960
 still kind of glitchy and buggy

2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:50.960
 there were things that I knew that

2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:52.960
 if you had a wall that was like almost edge

2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:54.960
 on you could slide over to it and you could

2:16:54.960 --> 2:16:56.960
 see some things freak out or vanish or not

2:16:56.960 --> 2:16:58.960
 work and I hated that

2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:00.960
 I but I was up against

2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:02.960
 the wall we had to ship the game

2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:04.960
 it was still a lot of fun to play it was

2:17:04.960 --> 2:17:06.960
 novel nobody had seen it it gave you that

2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:08.960
 startle reflex I reaction

2:17:08.960 --> 2:17:10.960
 so it was worth shipping

2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:12.960
 but it had these things that I knew

2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:14.960
 were kind of flaky and janky and not

2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:16.960
 not what I was really proud of

2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:18.960
 so one of the

2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:20.960
 things that I did very differently in Wolfenstein

2:17:20.960 --> 2:17:22.960
 I was

2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:24.960
 I went catacombs used

2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:26.960
 almost a conventional

2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:28.960
 thing where you had segments that were

2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:30.960
 one dimensional polygons basically that were

2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:32.960
 clipped and back faced

2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:34.960
 and done kind of like a very crude

2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:36.960
 3D engine from the professionals

2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:38.960
 but I wasn't getting it done

2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:40.960
 right I was not doing a good

2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:42.960
 enough job I didn't really have line of sight

2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:44.960
 to fix

2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.960
 it right there's stuff that of course I look back

2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:48.960
 it's like oh it's obvious how to do this do

2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:50.960
 the math right do your clipping right

2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:52.960
 check all of this how you handle the precision

2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:54.960
 but I did not know how to do that

2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:56.960
 at that time and I the first 3D

2:17:56.960 --> 2:17:58.960
 engine you wrote catacombs 3D

2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:00.960
 you know hover tank had been a little bit before that

2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:02.960
 but that had the flat shaded walls so

2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:04.960
 the texture mapping on the walls was what

2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:06.960
 was bringing in some of these challenges

2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:08.960
 that was that was hard for me

2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:10.960
 and I couldn't solve it right at the time

2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:12.960
 can you describe what flat shading is in texture mapping

2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:14.960
 so in the the walls were

2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:16.960
 solid color one of 16 colors

2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:18.960
 I am in hover tank

2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:20.960
 so that's easy it's fast you just

2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:22.960
 draw the solid color for everything

2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:24.960
 texture mapping is what we all see

2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:26.960
 today where you have an image that is

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.960
 stretched and distorted onto the walls

2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:30.960
 or the surfaces that you're working with

2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:32.960
 I am and it was

2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:34.960
 you know it was a long time for me to just figure

2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:36.960
 out how to do that without it

2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:38.960
 distorting in the wrong ways

2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:40.960
 and I did not get it all

2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:42.960
 exactly right in catacombs and I

2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:44.960
 had these flaws

2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:46.960
 so that was important enough to me

2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:48.960
 that rather than continuing to bang my head

2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:50.960
 on that when I wasn't positive I was

2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:52.960
 going to get it I went with a completely

2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.960
 different approach for drawing

2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:56.960
 for figuring out where the walls were

2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:58.960
 which was a ray casting approach

2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:00.960
 which I had done in catacombs 3D

2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:02.960
 I had a bunch of C code

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.960
 I was going to make this work right and it wasn't

2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:06.960
 working right in Wolfenstein

2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:08.960
 I wound up going to a very

2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:10.960
 small amount of assembly code

2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:12.960
 so in some ways they should be

2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:14.960
 a slower way of doing it

2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:16.960
 but by making it a smaller amount of work

2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:18.960
 that I could more tightly optimize

2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:20.960
 it worked out and Wolfenstein 3D

2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.960
 was just absolutely rock solid

2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960
 you know it was you know nothing

2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.960
 glitched in there the game just was

2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:28.960
 pretty much flawless through all of that

2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:30.960
 and I was super proud of that

2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:32.960
 but eventually like in the later games

2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:34.960
 I went back to the more span based

2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:36.960
 things where I could get more total efficiency

2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:38.960
 once I really did figure out

2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:40.960
 how to do it so there were two

2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:42.960
 sort of key technical things to Wolfenstein

2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:44.960
 one was this ray casting approach

2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.960
 which you still to this day

2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:48.960
 you see people go and say let's

2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:50.960
 write a ray casting engine because

2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.960
 it's an understandable way of doing things

2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:54.960
 that lets you make games very much

2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:56.960
 like that so you see raycasters in

2:19:56.960 --> 2:19:58.960
 javascript raycasters in python

2:19:58.960 --> 2:20:00.960
 people that are basically going

2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:02.960
 and re implementing that

2:20:02.960 --> 2:20:04.960
 approach to taking a tiled world

2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:06.960
 and casting out into it

2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:08.960
 it works pretty well but it's not the fastest

2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:10.960
 way of doing it. Can you describe what ray casting is?

2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:12.960
 So you start off

2:20:12.960 --> 2:20:14.960
 and you've got your screen which is

2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:16.960
 320 pixels across at the time if you haven't

2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:18.960
 sized down the window for

2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:20.960
 greater speed and at every

2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:22.960
 pixel there's going to be an angle

2:20:22.960 --> 2:20:24.960
 you've got your position in the world

2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:26.960
 and you're going to just run along that angle

2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:28.960
 and keep going until you hit a block

2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:30.960
 so up to 320

2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:32.960
 times across there it's going to throw

2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:34.960
 cast array out into the world

2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:36.960
 from wherever your origin is

2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:38.960
 until it runs into a wall

2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:40.960
 and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall

2:20:40.960 --> 2:20:42.960
 it hits. The performance

2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.960
 challenge of that is as it's going out

2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:46.960
 every block it's crossing

2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:48.960
 it checks is this a solid wall

2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:50.960
 so that means that in

2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:52.960
 like the early Wolfenstein levels you're

2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:54.960
 in a small jail cell going out into a small

2:20:54.960 --> 2:20:56.960
 hallway it's super efficient for

2:20:56.960 --> 2:20:58.960
 that because you're only stepping across three

2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:00.960
 or four blocks but then if somebody

2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:02.960
 makes a room that covers our maps

2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:04.960
 we're limited to 64 by 64 blocks

2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:06.960
 if you made one room

2:21:06.960 --> 2:21:08.960
 that was nothing but walls at the far

2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:10.960
 space it would go pretty slow

2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:12.960
 because it would be stepping across

2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:14.960
 80 tile tests or something

2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:16.960
 along the way. By the way the physics of our

2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.960
 universe seems to be competing this very thing

2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:20.960
 so this maps nicely to the

2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:22.960
 actual physics of our world.

2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:24.960
 Yeah you get like I follow a little bit

2:21:24.960 --> 2:21:26.960
 of something like Stephen Wolfram's work on

2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:28.960
 you know interconnected network

2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:30.960
 information states of that and

2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:32.960
 that's it's beyond what I can

2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:34.960
 have an informed opinion on

2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.960
 but it's interesting that people are

2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:38.960
 considering things like that and have

2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:40.960
 and have things that can back

2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:42.960
 it up. Yeah

2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:44.960
 there's whole different sets of interesting stuff

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:46.960
 there. So Wolfenstein 3D

2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.960
 had raycasting. So raycasting

2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:50.960
 and then the other kind of key aspect

2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:52.960
 was what I called compiled

2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:54.960
 scalars where the

2:21:54.960 --> 2:21:56.960
 idea of

2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:58.960
 you saw this in the earlier classic

2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:00.960
 arcade games like Space Harrier and stuff

2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:02.960
 where you would take a picture which is

2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:04.960
 normally drawn directly on the screen

2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:06.960
 and then if you have the ability to make

2:22:06.960 --> 2:22:08.960
 it bigger or smaller big chunky pixels

2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:10.960
 or physically small drop sampled

2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:12.960
 pixels that's the fundamental

2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:14.960
 aspect of what our characters

2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:16.960
 were doing in these 3D games you would have

2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:18.960
 it's just like you might have drawn a tiny little character

2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:20.960
 but now we can make them really big

2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:22.960
 and make them really small move it around

2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:24.960
 that was the limited kind of 3D

2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:26.960
 that we had for characters to make them

2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:28.960
 turn there were literally eight different views

2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:30.960
 of them you didn't actually have a 3D model

2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:32.960
 that would rotate you just had these cardboard

2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:34.960
 cutouts but that was good enough for that

2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:36.960
 startle fight reaction and

2:22:36.960 --> 2:22:38.960
 it was kind of what we had to deal

2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:40.960
 with there. So a straightforward

2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:42.960
 approach to do that you could just write

2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:44.960
 out your doubly nested loop of

2:22:44.960 --> 2:22:46.960
 you've got your stretch factor

2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:48.960
 and it's like you've got a point you stretch by a little

2:22:48.960 --> 2:22:50.960
 bit it might be on the same pixel it might

2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:52.960
 be on the next pixel might have skipped a pixel

2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:54.960
 you can write that out but it's

2:22:54.960 --> 2:22:56.960
 not gonna be fast enough where especially

2:22:56.960 --> 2:22:58.960
 you get a character for that right in

2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:00.960
 your face monster covering almost the

2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:02.960
 entire screen doing that with a

2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:04.960
 general purpose scaling routine

2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:06.960
 would have just been much too slow it would have

2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:08.960
 worked when they're small characters but then it would get

2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:10.960
 slower and slower as they got closer to you

2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:12.960
 until right at the time when you most care

2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:14.960
 about having a fast reaction time

2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:16.960
 the game would be chunking down

2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:18.960
 so the fastest possible

2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:20.960
 way to draw pixels

2:23:20.960 --> 2:23:22.960
 at that time was to

2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:24.960
 I am

2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:26.960
 instead of saying I've got a general

2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:28.960
 purpose I am

2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:30.960
 version that can handle any scale

2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:32.960
 I made I used

2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:34.960
 a program to make essentially

2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:36.960
 a hundred or more separate little

2:23:36.960 --> 2:23:38.960
 programs that was optimized for

2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:40.960
 I will take an image and I will draw it

2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:42.960
 12 pixels tall I'll take an image I'll

2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:44.960
 draw it 14 pixels tall

2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:46.960
 up by every two pixels even

2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:48.960
 for that so you would have the most

2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:50.960
 optimized code so that in

2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:52.960
 the normal case where

2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:54.960
 most of the world is fairly large

2:23:54.960 --> 2:23:56.960
 I like the pixels are big you know

2:23:56.960 --> 2:23:58.960
 we did not have a lot of memory so

2:23:58.960 --> 2:24:00.960
 in most cases that meant that you

2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:02.960
 would load a pixel color and then

2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:04.960
 you would store it multiple times

2:24:04.960 --> 2:24:06.960
 so that was faster

2:24:06.960 --> 2:24:08.960
 than even copying an image

2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:10.960
 in a normal conventional case because

2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:12.960
 most of the time the image is expanded

2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:14.960
 so instead of doing one read one

2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:16.960
 write for a simple copy you might

2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:18.960
 be doing one read and three or four writes

2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:20.960
 as it got really big and that had

2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:22.960
 the beneficial aspect of just when you

2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:24.960
 needed the performance most when things are covering

2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:26.960
 the screen it was giving you the most

2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:28.960
 acceleration for that by the way we

2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:30.960
 were able to

2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:32.960
 understand this through

2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:34.960
 thinking about it or were you testing like

2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:36.960
 the right speed and this again

2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:38.960
 comes back to I can

2:24:38.960 --> 2:24:40.960
 find the antecedents for things like this

2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:42.960
 so in I

2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:44.960
 back in the Apple 2 days

2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:46.960
 the graphics were

2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:48.960
 essentially single bits at a time

2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:50.960
 and if you wanted to make your

2:24:50.960 --> 2:24:52.960
 little spaceship if you wanted to make it

2:24:52.960 --> 2:24:54.960
 smoothly go across the world

2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:56.960
 if you just took the image and you drew it out at the next

2:24:56.960 --> 2:24:58.960
 location you would move by seven pixels

2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:00.960
 at a time so it would go chunk chunk chunk

2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:02.960
 if you wanted to make it move smoothly

2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:04.960
 you actually had to make seven versions

2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:06.960
 of the ship that were pre shifted

2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:08.960
 you could write a program that would shift it

2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:10.960
 dynamically but on a one megahertz

2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:12.960
 processor that's not going anywhere fast

2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:14.960
 so if you wanted to do a smooth

2:25:14.960 --> 2:25:16.960
 moving fast action game you made

2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:18.960
 separate versions of each of these

2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:20.960
 sprites now there were a few

2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:22.960
 more tricks you could pull that if it still

2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:24.960
 wasn't fast enough you could make

2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:26.960
 a compiled shape where

2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:28.960
 instead of this program

2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:30.960
 that normally copies an image

2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:32.960
 it says like get this byte from here

2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:34.960
 stored here get this byte store this byte

2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:36.960
 if you've got the memory space

2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:38.960
 you could say I'm going to write

2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:40.960
 the program that does nothing but draw

2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:42.960
 this shape it's going to be like

2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:44.960
 I'm going to load the immediate value

2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:46.960
 25 you know which is some

2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:48.960
 bit pattern and then I'm going to store

2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:50.960
 that at this location

2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:52.960
 rather than loading something from memory

2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:54.960
 that involve indexing registers

2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:56.960
 and this other slow stuff you could

2:25:56.960 --> 2:25:58.960
 go ahead and say no I'm going to hard code

2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:00.960
 the exact values of all of the image right

2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:02.960
 into the program and this was always

2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:04.960
 a horrible trade off there but you didn't have much

2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:06.960
 memory and you didn't have much speed

2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:08.960
 but if you had something that you wanted to go

2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:10.960
 really fast you could turn it into a program

2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.960
 and that was

2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:14.960
 you know knowing about that technique is what

2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:16.960
 made me think about some of these unwinding

2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:18.960
 it for the PC where people

2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:20.960
 that didn't come from that background were less

2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:22.960
 likely to think about that

2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:24.960
 I mean there's some deep parallels

2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:26.960
 probably to human cognition as well

2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:28.960
 there's something about

2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:30.960
 optimizing

2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:32.960
 and compressing

2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:34.960
 the

2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:36.960
 the processing of a new information that

2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:38.960
 requires you to predict the possible

2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:40.960
 ways in which

2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:42.960
 the game or the world

2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:44.960
 might unroll and you have

2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:46.960
 something like compiled scalars always

2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:48.960
 there so you have like

2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:50.960
 optimum like you have a prediction

2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:52.960
 of how the world will unroll and you have

2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:54.960
 some kind of optimized

2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:56.960
 data structure

2:26:56.960 --> 2:26:58.960
 for that prediction and then you can modify

2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:00.960
 if the world turns out to be different

2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:02.960
 you can modify in a slight way.

2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:04.960
 As far as building out techniques so much of the brain

2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:06.960
 is about the associative context

2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:08.960
 you know there just when you learn something

2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:10.960
 it's in the context of something else

2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:12.960
 and you can have faint tiny little

2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:14.960
 hints of things and I do think there are

2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:16.960
 some deep things around

2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:18.960
 like sparse distributed memories and boosting

2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:20.960
 that's like if you can just be slightly above the noise

2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:22.960
 floor of having some hint of something

2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:24.960
 you can have things refined into

2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:26.960
 pulling the memory back up so

2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:28.960
 having a being a programmer and having a

2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:30.960
 toolbox of like all of these things that

2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.960
 things that I did in all of these previous

2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:34.960
 lives of programming tasks that

2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:36.960
 still matters to me about how I'm

2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:38.960
 able to pull up some of these things like in that

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:40.960
 case it was something I did on the Apple

2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:42.960
 to then being relevant for the PC

2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:44.960
 and I have still cases

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:46.960
 when I would when I would work on mobile

2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:48.960
 development then be like okay I did

2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:50.960
 something like this back in the

2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:52.960
 the doom days but now it's a different

2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:54.960
 environment but I still had that tie

2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:56.960
 I can bring it in and I can transform it

2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:58.960
 into what the world needs right now

2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:00.960
 and I do think that's actually one of the

2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:02.960
 very core things with human cognition

2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:04.960
 and brain like I you know brain

2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:06.960
 like functioning is finding

2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:08.960
 these ways about you've got your brain is

2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:10.960
 kind of everything everywhere all at once

2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:12.960
 you know it's it is just a set of all of this

2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:14.960
 stuff that is just fetched back by these

2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:16.960
 queries that go into it and they can

2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:18.960
 just be slightly above the noise floor

2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:20.960
 with random noise in your neurons and synapses

2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:22.960
 that are affecting exactly what gets pulled

2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:24.960
 up so you're saying some of these very

2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:26.960
 specific solutions for different

2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:28.960
 games you find

2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:30.960
 that there's a kernel of an a deep

2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:32.960
 idea that's generalizable to other

2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:34.960
 to other things yeah you can't

2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:36.960
 predict what it's going to be but that

2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:38.960
 idea of like I called out that compiled

2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:40.960
 shaders in the forward that I wrote

2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:42.960
 for that the game engine black book

2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:44.960
 as you know this is it's

2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:46.960
 kind of an endpoint of unrolling

2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:48.960
 code but that's one of those things

2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:50.960
 that thinking about that and having that

2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:52.960
 in your mind and I'm sure there are some

2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:54.960
 programmers that you know hear about that

2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.960
 think about it a little bit it's kind of the

2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:58.960
 mind blown moment it's like oh you can

2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:00.960
 just turn all of that data into code

2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:02.960
 and nowadays you know you have instruction

2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:04.960
 cash issues and that's not necessarily the

2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:06.960
 best idea but there are different

2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:08.960
 it's an idea that has power

2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:10.960
 and has probably relevance in some other

2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:12.960
 areas maybe it's in a hardware point of

2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:14.960
 view that there's a way you approach

2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:16.960
 building hardware that has that same

2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:18.960
 you don't even have to think about iterating

2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:20.960
 everything all the way into it in one

2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:22.960
 place what is the story

2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:24.960
 of how you came to program doom

2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:26.960
 what is some memorable technical

2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:28.960
 challenges or innovations within that game

2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:30.960
 so the path that we went

2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:32.960
 after after Wolfenstein

2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:34.960
 got out and we were on this crazy

2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:36.960
 arc where keen one through three

2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:38.960
 more success than we thought keen

2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:40.960
 four through six even more success

2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:42.960
 Wolfenstein even more success so we

2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:44.960
 were on this this crazy trajectory

2:29:44.960 --> 2:29:46.960
 for things so actually our first

2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:48.960
 box commercial project was a commander

2:29:48.960 --> 2:29:50.960
 keen game but then

2:29:50.960 --> 2:29:52.960
 Wolfenstein was going to have a game

2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:54.960
 Spear of Destiny which was

2:29:54.960 --> 2:29:56.960
 a commercial version 60 new levels

2:29:56.960 --> 2:29:58.960
 so the rest of the team took the game

2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:00.960
 engine pretty much as it was

2:30:00.960 --> 2:30:02.960
 and started working on that we got

2:30:02.960 --> 2:30:04.960
 new monsters but it's

2:30:04.960 --> 2:30:06.960
 basically reskins of the things

2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:08.960
 there there's a really interesting aspect

2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:10.960
 about that that I didn't appreciate until much

2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:12.960
 much later about how

2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:14.960
 Wolfenstein clearly did

2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:16.960
 tap out its limit about

2:30:16.960 --> 2:30:18.960
 what you want to play

2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:20.960
 all the levels and a couple of our license

2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:22.960
 things there was a hard

2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:24.960
 creative wall that you did not really

2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:26.960
 benefit much by continuing to beat on it

2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:28.960
 but a game

2:30:28.960 --> 2:30:30.960
 like doom and other more modern

2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:32.960
 games like Minecraft or something

2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:34.960
 there's kind of a turing completeness level

2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:36.960
 of design freedom that you get in games

2:30:36.960 --> 2:30:38.960
 that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one

2:30:38.960 --> 2:30:40.960
 side of you know all the creative

2:30:40.960 --> 2:30:42.960
 people in the world could not go and do

2:30:42.960 --> 2:30:44.960
 a masterpiece just with the technology

2:30:44.960 --> 2:30:46.960
 that Wolfenstein had Wolfenstein

2:30:46.960 --> 2:30:48.960
 could do Wolfenstein but you really couldn't

2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:50.960
 do something crazy and different

2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:52.960
 but it didn't take that much more capability

2:30:52.960 --> 2:30:54.960
 to get to Wolfenstein with

2:30:54.960 --> 2:30:56.960
 the freeform lines and

2:30:56.960 --> 2:30:58.960
 a little bit more artistic freedom to get

2:30:58.960 --> 2:31:00.960
 to the point where people still announce

2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:02.960
 new doom levels today all these

2:31:02.960 --> 2:31:04.960
 years after without having completely

2:31:04.960 --> 2:31:06.960
 tapped out the creativity how did you

2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:08.960
 put it touring complete

2:31:08.960 --> 2:31:10.960
 design space design space

2:31:10.960 --> 2:31:12.960
 like you know we have the kind of

2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:14.960
 computational universality

2:31:14.960 --> 2:31:16.960
 on a lot of things and for creativity

2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:18.960
 but yeah there's things where

2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:20.960
 a box can be too small

2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:22.960
 but above a certain point

2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:24.960
 you kind of are at the point where

2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:26.960
 you really have almost

2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:28.960
 unbounded creative ability there and doom

2:31:28.960 --> 2:31:30.960
 was the first time you crossed

2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:32.960
 that line yeah where there were

2:31:32.960 --> 2:31:34.960
 thousands of doom levels created

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:36.960
 and some of them still have something new

2:31:36.960 --> 2:31:38.960
 and interesting to say to the world about it

2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:40.960
 that line

2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:42.960
 can you introspect what that line

2:31:42.960 --> 2:31:44.960
 was is in the design space

2:31:44.960 --> 2:31:46.960
 is it something about the programming

2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:48.960
 capabilities that you were able

2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:50.960
 to add to the game

2:31:50.960 --> 2:31:52.960
 so the graphics fidelity

2:31:52.960 --> 2:31:54.960
 was a necessary part because the block

2:31:54.960 --> 2:31:56.960
 limitations in Wolfenstein

2:31:56.960 --> 2:31:58.960
 what we had right there

2:31:58.960 --> 2:32:00.960
 was not enough

2:32:00.960 --> 2:32:02.960
 the full scale blocks although

2:32:02.960 --> 2:32:04.960
 Minecraft I really did show that

2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:06.960
 perhaps blocks stacked

2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:08.960
 in 3D and at one quarter

2:32:08.960 --> 2:32:10.960
 the scale of that one eighth in volume

2:32:10.960 --> 2:32:12.960
 is then sufficient to have all

2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:14.960
 of that but the wall

2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:16.960
 sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein

2:32:16.960 --> 2:32:18.960
 was too much of a creative limitation

2:32:18.960 --> 2:32:20.960
 we licensed the technology to a few other teams

2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:22.960
 none of them made

2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:24.960
 too much of a dent with that

2:32:24.960 --> 2:32:26.960
 it just wasn't enough creative ability

2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:28.960
 but a little bit more whether

2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:30.960
 it was the variable floors and ceilings

2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:32.960
 and arbitrary angles in doom

2:32:32.960 --> 2:32:34.960
 or the smaller

2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:36.960
 blocks in Minecraft

2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:38.960
 is then enough to open it up to

2:32:38.960 --> 2:32:40.960
 worlds and worlds of new capabilities

2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:42.960
 what is binary space

2:32:42.960 --> 2:32:44.960
 partitioning

2:32:44.960 --> 2:32:46.960
 which is one of the technologies

2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:48.960
 jump around a little bit

2:32:48.960 --> 2:32:50.960
 on the story path there

2:32:50.960 --> 2:32:52.960
 so while the team was working on

2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:54.960
 Spirit Destiny for Wolfenstein

2:32:54.960 --> 2:32:56.960
 we had met another development team

2:32:56.960 --> 2:32:58.960
 Raven Software while we were in Wisconsin

2:32:58.960 --> 2:33:00.960
 and

2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:02.960
 they had RPG background

2:33:02.960 --> 2:33:04.960
 and I still kind of love that

2:33:04.960 --> 2:33:06.960
 and I offered to do a game engine

2:33:06.960 --> 2:33:08.960
 for them to let them do

2:33:08.960 --> 2:33:10.960
 a 3D rendered RPG

2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:12.960
 instead of the like most RPG games

2:33:12.960 --> 2:33:14.960
 were kind of hand drawn they made it look

2:33:14.960 --> 2:33:16.960
 kind of 3D but it was done just all with

2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:18.960
 artist work rather than a real engine

2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:20.960
 and

2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:22.960
 after Wolfenstein this was still a tile

2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:24.960
 based world but I added floors and ceilings

2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:26.960
 and some lighting and the ability to have

2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:28.960
 some sloped floors in different areas

2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:30.960
 and that was my intermediate step for a game called

2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:32.960
 Lancaster

2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:34.960
 and it had slowed down enough

2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:36.960
 it was not fast enough to do our type

2:33:36.960 --> 2:33:38.960
 of action things so they had the screen

2:33:38.960 --> 2:33:40.960
 cropped down a little bit so

2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:42.960
 you couldn't go the full screen width

2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:44.960
 like we would try to do in Wolfenstein

2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:46.960
 but I learned a lot

2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:48.960
 I got the floors and ceilings and lightings and it looked great

2:33:48.960 --> 2:33:50.960
 they were great artists up there

2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:52.960
 and it was an inspiration for us to look at

2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:54.960
 some of that stuff

2:33:54.960 --> 2:33:56.960
 but I had learned enough from that

2:33:56.960 --> 2:33:58.960
 that I had the plan for

2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:00.960
 faster ways to do the lighting

2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:02.960
 and shadowing and I wanted to do this freeform

2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:04.960
 geometry I wanted to break out of this tile

2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:06.960
 based 90

2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:08.960
 degree world limitations

2:34:08.960 --> 2:34:10.960
 so we had that was

2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:12.960
 when we got our next stations and we were working

2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:14.960
 with these higher powered systems

2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.960
 and we built

2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:18.960
 an editor that let us draw kind of arbitrary

2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:20.960
 line segments and I was working hard

2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:22.960
 to try to make something that could

2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:24.960
 render this fast enough

2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:26.960
 I was pushing myself

2:34:26.960 --> 2:34:28.960
 pretty hard

2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:30.960
 and we were at a point where

2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:32.960
 we could see some things that looked amazingly cool

2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:34.960
 but it wasn't really fast enough

2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:36.960
 for the way I was doing it

2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:38.960
 for this flexibility it was no longer

2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:40.960
 I couldn't just raycast into it

2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:42.960
 and I had these very complex sets of lines

2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:44.960
 and simple little worlds were okay

2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:46.960
 but the cool things that we wanted to do

2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:48.960
 just weren't quite fast enough

2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:50.960
 and I wound up taking a break

2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:52.960
 at that point and I did

2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:54.960
 the port I did two ports

2:34:54.960 --> 2:34:56.960
 of

2:34:56.960 --> 2:34:58.960
 our games I

2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:00.960
 Wolfenstein to the

2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:02.960
 Super Nintendo it was a

2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:04.960
 crazy difficult thing to do

2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:06.960
 which was an even slower processor

2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:08.960
 a couple megahertz processor

2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:10.960
 and

2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:12.960
 it had been this whole thing where we had farmed out

2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:14.960
 the

2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:16.960
 work and it wasn't going well

2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:18.960
 and I took it back over

2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:20.960
 and trying to make it go fast

2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:22.960
 on there where it really

2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:24.960
 did not have much processing power

2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:26.960
 the pixels were stretched up hugely

2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:28.960
 and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it

2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:30.960
 but in the end it did come out fast enough

2:35:30.960 --> 2:35:32.960
 to play and still be kind of fun from that

2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:34.960
 but that was where I started

2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:36.960
 using BSP trees or binary

2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:38.960
 space partitioning trees it was one of those things

2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:40.960
 I had to make it faster

2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:42.960
 there it was a stepping stone

2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:44.960
 where it was reasonably easy to understand

2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:46.960
 in the grid world of Wolfenstein

2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:48.960
 where it was all still 90 degree angles

2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:50.960
 BSP trees were

2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:52.960
 I eased myself into

2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:54.960
 it with that and it was a big success

2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:56.960
 then when I came

2:35:56.960 --> 2:35:58.960
 back to working on Doom

2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:00.960
 I had this new tool in my toolbox

2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:02.960
 it was going to be a lot harder with the arbitrary

2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:04.960
 angles of Doom this was where

2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:06.960
 I really started grappling with epsilon

2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:08.960
 problems and just you know

2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:10.960
 up until that point I hadn't really had to deal with

2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:12.960
 the fact that I am

2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:14.960
 so many numeric things this almost felt like a betrayal

2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:16.960
 to me where people had told me that I had

2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:18.960
 mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal

2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:20.960
 where I was

2:36:20.960 --> 2:36:22.960
 people think I'm a math wizard and I'm not

2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:24.960
 I really everything that I did

2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:26.960
 was really done with a solid

2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:28.960
 high school math understanding

2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:30.960
 you know algebra 2 trigonometry

2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:32.960
 and I am

2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:34.960
 that was what got me all the way through Doom and Quake

2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:36.960
 and all of that of just understanding

2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:38.960
 basics of matrices and

2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:40.960
 knowing it well enough to do something with it

2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:42.960
 what's the epsilon problems you ran into

2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:44.960
 so I when you wind up taking

2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:46.960
 a like a sloped line

2:36:46.960 --> 2:36:48.960
 you say I'm going to intersect it with another sloped

2:36:48.960 --> 2:36:50.960
 line I am

2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:52.960
 then you wind up with something that's not going to be

2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:54.960
 on these nice grid boundaries

2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:56.960
 with the Wolfenstein tile maps

2:36:56.960 --> 2:36:58.960
 all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines

2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:00.960
 looking at it from above and if you cut

2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:02.960
 one of them it's just obvious the other one gets cut

2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:04.960
 exactly at that point

2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:06.960
 but when you have angled lines you're doing

2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:08.960
 a kind of a slope intercept problem

2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:10.960
 and you wind up with rational numbers there

2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:12.960
 where things that are not going

2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:14.960
 to evenly land on an integer

2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:16.960
 or even on any fixed point value that you've got

2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:18.960
 so everything winds up having

2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:20.960
 to snap to some fixed point value

2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:22.960
 so the lines slightly change their

2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:24.960
 angle you wind up if you cut something

2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:26.960
 here this one's going to bend a little this way

2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:28.960
 and it's not going to be completely straight

2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:30.960
 and then you come down to all these questions of

2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:32.960
 well this one is a

2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:34.960
 point on an angled line

2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:36.960
 you can't answer that in finite

2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:38.960
 precision unless you're doing something

2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:40.960
 with actual rational numbers

2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:42.960
 and later on I did waste far too much

2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:44.960
 time chasing things like that how do you

2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:46.960
 do precise arithmetic with rational numbers

2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:48.960
 and it always blows up eventually

2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:50.960
 exponentially as you do

2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:52.960
 so these kind of things are impossible with computers

2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:54.960
 so they're possible

2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:56.960
 again there are paths to do

2:37:56.960 --> 2:37:58.960
 doing it but you can't fit them conveniently

2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:00.960
 in any of the numbers you need to start using

2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:02.960
 big nums and different

2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:04.960
 factor trackings of different things

2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:06.960
 so you have to if you have any

2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:08.960
 elements of OCD and you want to do something

2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:10.960
 perfectly you're screwed if you're working

2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:12.960
 with floating point yeah so

2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:14.960
 so you had to deal with this for the first

2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:16.960
 time and there were lots of challenges

2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:18.960
 there about like okay they built

2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:20.960
 this cool thing and the way the BSP

2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:22.960
 trees work is it basically

2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:24.960
 takes the walls and it carves other

2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:26.960
 walls by those walls in this clever

2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:28.960
 way that you can then take

2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:30.960
 all of these fragments and then you can

2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:32.960
 for sure from any given point

2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:34.960
 get an ordering of everything in the world

2:38:34.960 --> 2:38:36.960
 and you can say this goes in front of this

2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:38.960
 goes in front of this all the way back to

2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:40.960
 the last thing and that's super

2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:42.960
 valuable for graphics where

2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:44.960
 kind of a classic graphics

2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:46.960
 algorithm would be painter's algorithm

2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:48.960
 you paint the furthest thing first and then the next thing

2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:50.960
 and then the next thing and then it comes up

2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:52.960
 and it's all perfect for you that's

2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:54.960
 slow because you don't want to have to have drawn

2:38:54.960 --> 2:38:56.960
 everything like that but you can also flip

2:38:56.960 --> 2:38:58.960
 it around and draw the closest thing

2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:00.960
 to you and then if you're clever

2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:02.960
 about it you can figure out what you need

2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:04.960
 to draw that's visible beyond

2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:06.960
 that and that's what BSP trees allow you to

2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:08.960
 do. Yeah so it's combined with

2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:10.960
 a bunch of other things but it gives

2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:12.960
 you that ordering it's a clever way

2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:14.960
 of doing things and I remember

2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:16.960
 I had learned this from one of

2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:18.960
 my graphics bible at the time

2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:20.960
 a book called Folien Van Damme and I can't

2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:22.960
 it was a different world back there there was a small

2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:24.960
 integer number of books and

2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:26.960
 this book that yeah

2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:28.960
 this book that was it was big fat college

2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:30.960
 textbook that I had read

2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:32.960
 through many times I didn't

2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:34.960
 understand everything in it some of it wasn't

2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:36.960
 useful to me but they had the little

2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:38.960
 thing about

2:39:38.960 --> 2:39:40.960
 finite orderings of you draw a little t

2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:42.960
 shaped thing and you can say you can

2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:44.960
 you can make a fixed ahead of time order from

2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:46.960
 this and you can generalize this with

2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:48.960
 the BSP trees and I

2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:50.960
 got a little bit more information about that and

2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:52.960
 it was kind of fun later while I was working on

2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:54.960
 Quake I got to meet Bruce Nailer

2:39:54.960 --> 2:39:56.960
 who is one of the original researchers that

2:39:56.960 --> 2:39:58.960
 developed those technologies

2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:00.960
 for academic literature

2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:02.960
 and that was kind of fun but I was very much

2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:04.960
 finding a tool that can help me solve

2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:06.960
 what I was doing and I was using it in this

2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:08.960
 very crude way in a two dimensional fashion

2:40:08.960 --> 2:40:10.960
 rather than the general 3D the epsilon

2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:12.960
 problem got much worse in Quake

2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:14.960
 in three dimensionals when things angle in every

2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:16.960
 way but eventually I did sort

2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:18.960
 out the sort out how to do it reliably

2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:20.960
 on doom there were still a few

2:40:20.960 --> 2:40:22.960
 edge cases in doom that were not

2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:24.960
 absolutely perfect where

2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:26.960
 they even got terminologies in the

2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:28.960
 communities like when you got to something where it

2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:30.960
 was messed up it was a hall of mirrors effect

2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:32.960
 because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw

2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:34.960
 something there and you would just wind up with

2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:36.960
 the leftover remnants as you flipped

2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:38.960
 between the two pages

2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:40.960
 but BSP trees were important

2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:42.960
 for it but it's again worth noting

2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:44.960
 that after we did

2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:46.960
 doom our major competition

2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:48.960
 came from I'm Ken Silverman

2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:50.960
 his build engine which was used for Duke

2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:52.960
 Nukem 3D and some of the other games for

2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:54.960
 3D realms and he used a completely

2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:56.960
 different technology nothing to do with

2:40:56.960 --> 2:40:58.960
 I'm with BSP

2:40:58.960 --> 2:41:00.960
 trees so there's not just

2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:02.960
 a one true way of doing things

2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:04.960
 I'm there were critical things

2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:06.960
 about to make any of those games

2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:08.960
 fast you had to you had to separate

2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:10.960
 your drawing into you drew vertical lines

2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:12.960
 and you drew horizontal lines just

2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:14.960
 kind of changing exactly what you would

2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:16.960
 draw with them that was critical for

2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:18.960
 the technologies at that time

2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:20.960
 and like all the games that were

2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:22.960
 kind of like that wound up doing something

2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:24.960
 similar but there were still a bunch of other

2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:26.960
 decisions that could be made

2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:28.960
 and we made good enough decisions

2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:30.960
 on everything on doom

2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:32.960
 we brought in multiplayer

2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:34.960
 significantly and it was our first game

2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:36.960
 that was designed to be modified

2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:38.960
 by the user community where we had this

2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:40.960
 whole set up of our wad files

2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:42.960
 and pwads and things that people could

2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:44.960
 build with tools that we released to them

2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:46.960
 and they eventually rewrote to be better

2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:48.960
 than what we released but they could build

2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:50.960
 things and you could add it to your game

2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:52.960
 without destructively modifying it which

2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:54.960
 is what you had to do in all the early games

2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:56.960
 the data files are

2:41:56.960 --> 2:41:58.960
 the executable before while doom

2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:00.960
 was set up in this flexible way so

2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:02.960
 that you could just say run the normal

2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:04.960
 game with this added on on top and it

2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:06.960
 would overlay just the things

2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:08.960
 that you wanted to there

2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:10.960
 would you say that doom was kind of the

2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:12.960
 first true 3d game

2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:14.960
 that you created so no it's still

2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:16.960
 doom would usually be called a 2

2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:18.960
 and a half d game where it had

2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:20.960
 three dimensional points on it and this is

2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:22.960
 another one of these kind of pedantic things

2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:24.960
 that I love to argue about about what was

2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:26.960
 the first 3d game I still

2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:28.960
 like every month probably I hear from

2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:30.960
 somebody about well was doom really

2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:32.960
 a 3d game or something

2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:34.960
 and

2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:36.960
 I give the point where

2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:38.960
 characters had three coordinates

2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:40.960
 so you had like an x y and z the

2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:42.960
 cacodamon could be coming in very high

2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:44.960
 and come down towards you

2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:46.960
 the walls had three coordinates

2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:48.960
 on them so on some sense

2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:50.960
 it's a 3d game engine

2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:52.960
 not a fully general 3d game

2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:54.960
 engine you could not

2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:56.960
 build a pyramid in doom because

2:42:56.960 --> 2:42:58.960
 you couldn't make a sloped wall

2:42:58.960 --> 2:43:00.960
 which was slightly different where in

2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:02.960
 that previous shadow caster game I couldn't

2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:04.960
 have vertexes and have a sloped floor there

2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:06.960
 but the changes that I made for

2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:08.960
 doom to get higher speed and

2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:10.960
 a different set of flexibility traded away

2:43:10.960 --> 2:43:12.960
 that ability but you literally couldn't make

2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:14.960
 that you could not

2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:16.960
 make different heights

2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:18.960
 of passages but you could not make a bridge

2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:20.960
 over another area you could not

2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:22.960
 go over and above it so it still had

2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:24.960
 some 2d limitations to it

2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:26.960
 that's more about the building versus the actual

2:43:26.960 --> 2:43:28.960
 experience because the experiences

2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:30.960
 it felt like things would come at you but again

2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:32.960
 you couldn't look up either

2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:34.960
 you could only pitch

2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:36.960
 it was 4 degrees of freedom rather than

2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:38.960
 6 degrees of freedom you did not

2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:40.960
 have the ability to tilt your head this way

2:43:40.960 --> 2:43:42.960
 or pitch up and down so that takes us

2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:44.960
 to quake what was

2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:46.960
 the leap there

2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:48.960
 what was some fascinating

2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:50.960
 technical challenges and there were a lot

2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:52.960
 or not challenges but innovations

2:43:52.960 --> 2:43:54.960
 that you've come up with so quake was

2:43:54.960 --> 2:43:56.960
 kind of the first thing where

2:43:56.960 --> 2:43:58.960
 I did have to kind of come face

2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:00.960
 to face with my limitations

2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:02.960
 where it was the first thing where

2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:04.960
 I really did kind of give

2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:06.960
 it my all and still come up

2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:08.960
 you know come up a little bit short in terms

2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:10.960
 of what and when I wanted to

2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:12.960
 to get it done and the company

2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:14.960
 brand had some serious stresses

2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:16.960
 through the whole project

2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:18.960
 and we

2:44:18.960 --> 2:44:20.960
 bit off a lot so the things that we set out

2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:22.960
 to do was it was going to be

2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:24.960
 really a true 3D engine where

2:44:24.960 --> 2:44:26.960
 it could do 6 degree of freedom

2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:28.960
 you could have all the

2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:30.960
 viewpoints you could model anything

2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:32.960
 it had

2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:34.960
 a really remarkable new lighting

2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:36.960
 model with the surface caching

2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:38.960
 and things that was one of those where it was starting

2:44:38.960 --> 2:44:40.960
 to do some things that they weren't doing

2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:42.960
 even on the very high end systems

2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:44.960
 and it was going to be

2:44:44.960 --> 2:44:46.960
 completely programmable

2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:48.960
 in the modding standpoint where

2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:50.960
 the thing that you couldn't do and do

2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:52.960
 you could replace almost all of the media

2:44:52.960 --> 2:44:54.960
 but you couldn't really change the game

2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:56.960
 there were still some people

2:44:56.960 --> 2:44:58.960
 that were doing the hex setting of the executable

2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:00.960
 the dehacked things where you could change

2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:02.960
 a few things about rules and people made

2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:04.960
 some really capture the flag type things

2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:06.960
 by hacking the executable but

2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:08.960
 it wasn't really set out to do that

2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:10.960
 quake was going to have its own

2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:12.960
 language that the game was going to be implemented

2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:14.960
 and that would be able to be overwritten

2:45:14.960 --> 2:45:16.960
 just like any of the media

2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:18.960
 code was going to be data for that

2:45:18.960 --> 2:45:20.960
 and you would be able to have expansion

2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:22.960
 packs that changed fundamental things

2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:24.960
 and mods and so on

2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:26.960
 and the multiplayer

2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:28.960
 was going to be playable over the internet

2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:30.960
 it was going to support a client

2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:32.960
 server rather than peer to peer

2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:34.960
 so we had the possibility of supporting

2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:36.960
 larger numbers of players in disparate locations

2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:38.960
 with this full flexibility

2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:40.960
 of the programming overrides

2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:42.960
 with full six degree of freedom

2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:44.960
 modeling and viewing

2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:46.960
 and with this fancy new light map

2:45:46.960 --> 2:45:48.960
 kind of surface caching

2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:50.960
 side it was a lot and this was

2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:52.960
 one of those things that if I could

2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:54.960
 go back and tell

2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:56.960
 tell younger me to do something differently

2:45:56.960 --> 2:45:58.960
 it would have been to split those innovations

2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:00.960
 up into two phases

2:46:00.960 --> 2:46:02.960
 in two separate games. It will be phase one

2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:04.960
 and phase two. So it probably would have been

2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:06.960
 taking the doom rendering engine

2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:08.960
 and bringing in

2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:10.960
 the TCP IP client server

2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:12.960
 focusing on the multiplayer

2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:14.960
 and the Quake C

2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:16.960
 or would have been Doom C programming language there

2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:18.960
 so I would have split that into

2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:20.960
 programming language and networking

2:46:20.960 --> 2:46:22.960
 with the same doom engine

2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:24.960
 rather than forcing everybody to go towards

2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:26.960
 the Quake engine which really meant

2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:28.960
 getting a Pentium. While it ran on a 486

2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:30.960
 it was not a great experience there

2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:32.960
 we could have made more people happier

2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:34.960
 and gotten two games done

2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:36.960
 50% more time.

2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:38.960
 So speaking of people happier

2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:40.960
 or

2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:42.960
 mutual friend Joe Rogan

2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:44.960
 it seems like has the most

2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:46.960
 important moment of his life

2:46:46.960 --> 2:46:48.960
 has centered around Quake

2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:50.960
 so it was a definitive

2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:52.960
 part of his life

2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:54.960
 so would he agree with

2:46:54.960 --> 2:46:56.960
 your thinking that

2:46:56.960 --> 2:46:58.960
 they should split

2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:00.960
 so he is a person who loves Quake

2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:02.960
 and played Quake a lot

2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:04.960
 would he agree that you should have

2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:06.960
 done the doom engine

2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:08.960
 and focus on the multiplayer for phase 1

2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:10.960
 or

2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:12.960
 in your looking back

2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:14.960
 is the 3D world that Quake created

2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:16.960
 was also

2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:18.960
 fundamental to the

2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:20.960
 enriching experience. I would say that

2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:22.960
 what would have happened is

2:47:22.960 --> 2:47:24.960
 you would have had a

2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:26.960
 doom looking but Quake feeling

2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:28.960
 game

2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:30.960
 8 months earlier and then maybe

2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:32.960
 6 months after Quake actually

2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:34.960
 shipped then there would have been the full

2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:36.960
 running on a Pentium I am

2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:38.960
 6 degree of freedom, graphics engine type

2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:40.960
 things there so it's not that it wouldn't

2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:42.960
 have been there

2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:44.960
 it would have been something amazingly cool

2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:46.960
 earlier and then something even cooler

2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:48.960
 somewhat later where

2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:50.960
 I would much rather have gone and done

2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:52.960
 two 1 year development efforts

2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:54.960
 I've cycled them through

2:47:54.960 --> 2:47:56.960
 I've been a little more pragmatic about that

2:47:56.960 --> 2:47:58.960
 rather than killing us

2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:00.960
 ourselves on the whole Quake development

2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:02.960
 but I would say it's obviously

2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:04.960
 things worked out well in the end

2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:06.960
 but looking back and saying how would I

2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:08.960
 optimize and do things differently

2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:10.960
 that did seem to be a clear case where

2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:12.960
 I

2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:14.960
 going ahead and we had enormous momentum

2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:16.960
 on doom you know we did doom too

2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:18.960
 as the kind of commercial boxed version

2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:20.960
 after our shareware success

2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:22.960
 with the original but we could have just

2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:24.960
 made another doom game

2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:26.960
 adding those new features

2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:28.960
 in it would have been huge we would have

2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:30.960
 learned all the same lessons but faster

2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:32.960
 and it would have given

2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:34.960
 6 degree of freedom and Pentium

2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:36.960
 class systems a little bit more time

2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:38.960
 to get mainstream because we did

2:48:38.960 --> 2:48:40.960
 cut out a lot of people with the hardware

2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:42.960
 requirements for Quake

2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:44.960
 was there any dark moments for you personally

2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:46.960
 psychologically in having

2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:50.960
 having such harsh deadlines

2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:52.960
 and having this also made

2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:54.960
 difficult technical challenges

2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:56.960
 so I've never really

2:48:56.960 --> 2:48:58.960
 had

2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:00.960
 really dark black places I mean

2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:02.960
 I can't necessarily put myself in

2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:04.960
 anyone else's shoes but I understand

2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:06.960
 a lot of people

2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:08.960
 have you have significant

2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:10.960
 challenges with kind of their

2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:12.960
 mental health and well being and I've been

2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:14.960
 I've been super stressed

2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:16.960
 I've been you know unhappy as a teenager

2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:18.960
 in various ways but

2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:20.960
 I've never I've never really

2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:22.960
 gone to a very dark

2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:24.960
 place I just seem to be

2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:26.960
 largely

2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:28.960
 immune to what really

2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:30.960
 wrecks people I mean I've had plenty of time

2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:32.960
 when I'm very unhappy and miserable about

2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:34.960
 something but it's never

2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:36.960
 hit me like you know I believe

2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:38.960
 it winds up hitting some other people

2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:40.960
 I've borne up well under whatever

2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:42.960
 stresses have I

2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:44.960
 you know have kind of fallen on me and I've

2:49:44.960 --> 2:49:46.960
 always coped best on that

2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:48.960
 when all I need to do is

2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:50.960
 usually just kind of bear down on my work

2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:52.960
 I pull myself out of

2:49:52.960 --> 2:49:54.960
 whatever hole I might be slipping into

2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:56.960
 by actually making progress

2:49:56.960 --> 2:49:58.960
 I mean maybe if I was in a

2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:00.960
 position where I was never able to make

2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:02.960
 that progress I could have slid down further

2:50:02.960 --> 2:50:04.960
 but I've always been in a

2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:06.960
 place where okay a little bit

2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:08.960
 more work maybe I'm in a tough spot here

2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:10.960
 but I always know

2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:12.960
 if I just keep pushing eventually

2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:14.960
 I break through and I make progress I feel

2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:16.960
 good about what I'm doing

2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:18.960
 and that's been enough for me so

2:50:18.960 --> 2:50:20.960
 far in my life

2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:22.960
 Have you seen in the distance

2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:24.960
 like

2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:26.960
 you know ideas of depression

2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:28.960
 or contemplating suicide have you seen

2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.960
 those things far?

2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:32.960
 So it was interesting when I was a teenager

2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:34.960
 I was

2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:36.960
 probably on some level a troubled

2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:38.960
 youth I was unhappy most of my teenage

2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:40.960
 years I

2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:42.960
 wanted to be on my own doing

2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:44.960
 programming all the time as soon as I

2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:46.960
 was 18, 19 even though

2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:48.960
 I was poor I was doing exactly what I wanted

2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:50.960
 and I was very happy but high

2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:52.960
 school was not a great time for me

2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:54.960
 and I had

2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:56.960
 a conversation with like the school counselor

2:50:56.960 --> 2:50:58.960
 and they're kind of running their script it's like

2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:00.960
 okay it's kind of a weird kid here let's

2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:02.960
 carefully probe around it's like

2:51:02.960 --> 2:51:04.960
 you know do you ever think about ending

2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:06.960
 it all? I'm like no of course

2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:08.960
 not never not at all

2:51:08.960 --> 2:51:10.960
 this is temporary things are going to be better

2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:14.960
 and that's always been kind of the case

2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:16.960
 for me and obviously

2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:18.960
 that's not that way for everyone and other people

2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:20.960
 do react differently and

2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:22.960
 what was your escape

2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:24.960
 from the troubled youth

2:51:24.960 --> 2:51:26.960
 like

2:51:26.960 --> 2:51:28.960
 you know music

2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:30.960
 video games

2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:32.960
 books

2:51:32.960 --> 2:51:34.960
 how did you escape from

2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:36.960
 a world that's full of cruelty and suffering

2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:38.960
 and that's absurd? Yeah I mean I was

2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:40.960
 not you know I was not victim of cruelty

2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:42.960
 and suffering it's like I was an unhappy

2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:44.960
 somewhat petulant youth and you know in my

2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:46.960
 point where I you know I'm not

2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:48.960
 putting myself up with anybody else's

2:51:48.960 --> 2:51:50.960
 suffering but I was unhappy

2:51:50.960 --> 2:51:52.960
 objectively and

2:51:52.960 --> 2:51:54.960
 the things that I did that

2:51:54.960 --> 2:51:56.960
 very much characterized my childhood

2:51:56.960 --> 2:51:58.960
 were I had

2:51:58.960 --> 2:52:00.960
 books, comic books, dungeons and dragons,

2:52:00.960 --> 2:52:02.960
 arcade games, video games

2:52:02.960 --> 2:52:04.960
 like some of my fondest

2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:06.960
 childhood memories are the convenience stores

2:52:06.960 --> 2:52:08.960
 the 711s and quick trips because

2:52:08.960 --> 2:52:10.960
 they had a spinner rack of comic books

2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:12.960
 and they had a little side room with

2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:14.960
 two or three video games, arcade games

2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:16.960
 in it and that was

2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:18.960
 that was very much my happy place you know if I

2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:20.960
 could I get my comic books and

2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:22.960
 if I could go to a library and you know

2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:24.960
 go through those little 0 0

2:52:24.960 --> 2:52:26.960
 0 section where computer books were supposed

2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:28.960
 to be and there are a few sad little books there

2:52:28.960 --> 2:52:30.960
 but still just being able to sit down

2:52:30.960 --> 2:52:32.960
 and go through that and I read

2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:34.960
 you know I read a ridiculous number

2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:36.960
 of books both fiction and nonfiction

2:52:36.960 --> 2:52:38.960
 as a teenager and

2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:40.960
 you know as I my

2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:42.960
 my rebelling in high school was

2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:44.960
 just sitting there with my nose in a book ignoring

2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:46.960
 the class and through lots of it and

2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:48.960
 teachers had a range of reactions

2:52:48.960 --> 2:52:50.960
 to that some more

2:52:50.960 --> 2:52:52.960
 accepting of it than others

2:52:52.960 --> 2:52:54.960
 I'm with you on that so let

2:52:54.960 --> 2:52:56.960
 us return to quake for a bit with the technical

2:52:56.960 --> 2:52:58.960
 challenges what

2:52:58.960 --> 2:53:00.960
 everything together

2:53:00.960 --> 2:53:02.960
 from the networking

2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:04.960
 to the graphics

2:53:04.960 --> 2:53:06.960
 what are some things you remember

2:53:06.960 --> 2:53:08.960
 that were

2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:10.960
 innovations you had to come up with in order

2:53:10.960 --> 2:53:12.960
 to make it all happen

2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:14.960
 yeah so there were a bunch of things on quake

2:53:14.960 --> 2:53:16.960
 where on the one hand the idea

2:53:16.960 --> 2:53:18.960
 that I built my own programming language

2:53:18.960 --> 2:53:20.960
 to implement the game in

2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:22.960
 looking back and I try to tell people

2:53:22.960 --> 2:53:24.960
 it's like every every high level

2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:26.960
 programmer sometime in their career goes through

2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:28.960
 and they invent their own language it just seems to be a thing

2:53:28.960 --> 2:53:30.960
 that's pretty broadly done people

2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:32.960
 they're like I'm gonna go write a computer programming language

2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:34.960
 and

2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:36.960
 you know I don't regret having done it

2:53:36.960 --> 2:53:38.960
 but after that I switched

2:53:38.960 --> 2:53:40.960
 from quake C my quirky little

2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:42.960
 pseudo object orient or

2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:44.960
 entity oriented language there

2:53:44.960 --> 2:53:46.960
 quake 2 went back to using DLLs

2:53:46.960 --> 2:53:48.960
 with C and then quake 3

2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:50.960
 I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler

2:53:50.960 --> 2:53:52.960
 which was a much smarter thing to do

2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:54.960
 that I should have done originally for quake

2:53:54.960 --> 2:53:56.960
 but building my own language was

2:53:56.960 --> 2:53:58.960
 an experience I learned a lot from that

2:53:58.960 --> 2:54:00.960
 and then there was a generation

2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:02.960
 of game programmers that learned

2:54:02.960 --> 2:54:04.960
 programming with quake C which I feel kind

2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:06.960
 of bad about because

2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:08.960
 we give javascript a lot of crap but

2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:10.960
 quake C was nothing to

2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:12.960
 write home about there

2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:14.960
 but it allowed people to do

2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:16.960
 magical things you get into programming not

2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:18.960
 because you love the

2:54:18.960 --> 2:54:20.960
 BNF syntax of a language

2:54:20.960 --> 2:54:22.960
 it's because the language lets you do

2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:24.960
 something that you cared about and here's

2:54:24.960 --> 2:54:26.960
 very much you could do something

2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:28.960
 in a whole beautiful three dimensional world

2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:30.960
 and the idea and the fact that the code

2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:32.960
 for the game was out there you could say

2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:34.960
 I like the shotgun but I want

2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:36.960
 it to be more badass you go in there and say

2:54:36.960 --> 2:54:38.960
 okay now it does 200 points damage

2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:40.960
 and then you go around with a big grin

2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:42.960
 on your face blowing up monsters all over

2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:44.960
 the game so yeah it's

2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:46.960
 I you know it is not

2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:48.960
 what I would do today going back with that

2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:50.960
 language but that was a big part of it

2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:52.960
 learning about the networking stuff

2:54:52.960 --> 2:54:54.960
 I because it's

2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:56.960
 interesting where I learned these things by

2:54:56.960 --> 2:54:58.960
 reading books so I would get a book on networking

2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:00.960
 find something I

2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:02.960
 read all about and learn okay packets they can

2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:04.960
 be out of order

2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:06.960
 lost or duplicated these are all

2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:08.960
 the things that can theoretically happen to packets

2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:10.960
 so I wind up spending all this time

2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:12.960
 thinking about how do we deal about all that

2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:14.960
 and it turns out of course in the real world

2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:16.960
 those are things that yes theoretically can

2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:18.960
 happen with multiple routes but they really

2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:20.960
 aren't things that you're 99.999%

2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:22.960
 of your packets

2:55:22.960 --> 2:55:24.960
 have to deal with

2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:26.960
 so there was learning experiences about

2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:28.960
 lots of that like why

2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:30.960
 when TCP is appropriate

2:55:30.960 --> 2:55:32.960
 versus UDP and and how

2:55:32.960 --> 2:55:34.960
 if you do things in UDP you wind up reinventing

2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:36.960
 TCP badly in almost all cases

2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:38.960
 so you know there's

2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:40.960
 there's good arguments for using both

2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:42.960
 for different game technology

2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:44.960
 different parts of the game process transitioning

2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:46.960
 from level to level and all but the

2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:48.960
 the graphics were the showcase

2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:50.960
 of what what quake

2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:52.960
 was all about it was this graphics technology

2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:54.960
 that nobody had seen there

2:55:54.960 --> 2:55:56.960
 and it was a while before

2:55:56.960 --> 2:55:58.960
 you know there were competitive things out there

2:55:58.960 --> 2:56:00.960
 and it went a long

2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:02.960
 time internally really not working

2:56:02.960 --> 2:56:04.960
 where we were even building

2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:06.960
 levels where the game

2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:08.960
 just was not at all

2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:10.960
 shippable with large fractions of the world

2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:12.960
 like disappearing not being there

2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:14.960
 I or being really

2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:16.960
 slow in various parts of it and it

2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:18.960
 was this act of faith it's like

2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:20.960
 I think I'm gonna be able to fix this I think

2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:22.960
 I'm gonna be able to make this work

2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:24.960
 I'm and lots

2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:26.960
 of stuff changed where the level designers

2:56:26.960 --> 2:56:28.960
 would build something then have to throw it away

2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:30.960
 as something fundamental in the kind of

2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:32.960
 graphics or level technology changed

2:56:32.960 --> 2:56:34.960
 and the

2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:36.960
 I'm so there were two big things

2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:38.960
 that contributed to making it possible

2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:40.960
 at that time frame I am

2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:42.960
 two new things there was

2:56:42.960 --> 2:56:44.960
 certainly hardcore optimized low level

2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:46.960
 assembly language this is where

2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:48.960
 I had hired Michael a brash away from

2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:50.960
 Microsoft and he had been one of my

2:56:50.960 --> 2:56:52.960
 early inspirations where

2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:54.960
 that back in the soft disk days the library

2:56:54.960 --> 2:56:56.960
 of magazines that they had

2:56:56.960 --> 2:56:58.960
 some of my most treasured ones were

2:56:58.960 --> 2:57:00.960
 Michael a brash's articles

2:57:00.960 --> 2:57:02.960
 in Dr. Dobbs Journal and

2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:04.960
 it was it was amazing after

2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:06.960
 all of our success in doom we were able to

2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:08.960
 kind of hit him up and say hey we'd like you

2:57:08.960 --> 2:57:10.960
 to come work at id software and he was in

2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:12.960
 the senior technical role at Microsoft

2:57:12.960 --> 2:57:14.960
 and I am you know and

2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:16.960
 he was on track for and this was right when

2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:18.960
 Microsoft was starting to take off and I did

2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:20.960
 eventually

2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:22.960
 convince him that what we were doing

2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:24.960
 was going to be really amazing with quake it was

2:57:24.960 --> 2:57:26.960
 going to it was going to be something nobody

2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:28.960
 had seen before it had

2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:30.960
 these aspects of what we were talking

2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:32.960
 about we had metaverse talk back then

2:57:32.960 --> 2:57:34.960
 we had read snow crash and we

2:57:34.960 --> 2:57:36.960
 were we knew about this and

2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:38.960
 Michael was

2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:40.960
 big into the science fiction and we would talk

2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:42.960
 about all that and kind of spin this tail

2:57:42.960 --> 2:57:44.960
 and it was some of the same conversations

2:57:44.960 --> 2:57:46.960
 that we have today about the metaverse

2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:48.960
 about how you could have different areas

2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:50.960
 linked together by portals and you could have

2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:52.960
 user generated content and changing

2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:54.960
 out all of these things so you really

2:57:54.960 --> 2:57:56.960
 were creating the metaverse quaking

2:57:56.960 --> 2:57:58.960
 and we we talked about things like

2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:00.960
 philosophically advertised as a virtual

2:58:00.960 --> 2:58:02.960
 reality experience you know that was

2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:04.960
 the first wave of virtual reality was

2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:06.960
 in the late 80s and early 90s

2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:08.960
 you had like the lawnmower man

2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:10.960
 I'm you know movie and you had

2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:12.960
 time in newsweek talking about the early

2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:14.960
 VPL headsets and

2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:16.960
 of course that cratered so hard that

2:58:16.960 --> 2:58:18.960
 people didn't want to look at virtual reality

2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:20.960
 for decades afterwards where

2:58:20.960 --> 2:58:22.960
 it was just it was spoken

2:58:22.960 --> 2:58:24.960
 mirrors it was not real in the sense

2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:26.960
 that you could actually do something

2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:28.960
 real and valuable with it but

2:58:28.960 --> 2:58:30.960
 but still we had that kind of common

2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:32.960
 set of talking points and we were talking

2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:34.960
 about what these games could

2:58:34.960 --> 2:58:36.960
 I could become and how you'd

2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:38.960
 like to see people building all of these

2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:40.960
 creative things because we were seeing an

2:58:40.960 --> 2:58:42.960
 explosion of work with doom at that time

2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:44.960
 people were doing amazingly

2:58:44.960 --> 2:58:46.960
 cool things like we saw cooler

2:58:46.960 --> 2:58:48.960
 levels that we had built coming out of the

2:58:48.960 --> 2:58:50.960
 user community and then people finding

2:58:50.960 --> 2:58:52.960
 ways to you know change the characters

2:58:52.960 --> 2:58:54.960
 in different ways and it was great and we

2:58:54.960 --> 2:58:56.960
 knew what we were doing in quake was

2:58:56.960 --> 2:58:58.960
 removing those last things there

2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:00.960
 was some quirky things with a couple

2:59:00.960 --> 2:59:02.960
 of the data types that didn't work right

2:59:02.960 --> 2:59:04.960
 for overriding and then and then the

2:59:04.960 --> 2:59:06.960
 core thing about the programming model

2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:08.960
 and I was definitely going to hit all of

2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:10.960
 those in quake I'm

2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:12.960
 but the the graphics side of it was

2:59:12.960 --> 2:59:14.960
 it was still

2:59:14.960 --> 2:59:16.960
 I knew what I wanted to do

2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:18.960
 and it was one of these

2:59:18.960 --> 2:59:20.960
 hubris things where it's like well

2:59:20.960 --> 2:59:22.960
 so far I've been able to kind of

2:59:22.960 --> 2:59:24.960
 kick everything that I set out

2:59:24.960 --> 2:59:26.960
 to go do but quake

2:59:26.960 --> 2:59:28.960
 was definitely a little bit

2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:30.960
 more than could be comfortably chewed

2:59:30.960 --> 2:59:32.960
 at that point and

2:59:32.960 --> 2:59:34.960
 but Michael was one of the

2:59:34.960 --> 2:59:36.960
 one of the strongest programmers and

2:59:36.960 --> 2:59:38.960
 graphics programmers that I knew

2:59:38.960 --> 2:59:40.960
 and he was one of the people that I trusted

2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:42.960
 to to write assembly code

2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:44.960
 you know better than I could and there's

2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:46.960
 there's a few people that I can point to

2:59:46.960 --> 2:59:48.960
 about things like this where I'm a world

2:59:48.960 --> 2:59:50.960
 class optimizer I mean I make things

2:59:50.960 --> 2:59:52.960
 go fast but I recognize

2:59:52.960 --> 2:59:54.960
 there's a number of people that

2:59:54.960 --> 2:59:56.960
 can write tighter assembly code

2:59:56.960 --> 2:59:58.960
 tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code

2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:00.960
 then you know then I can write

3:00:00.960 --> 3:00:02.960
 I'm you know my best strengths

3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:04.960
 are a little bit more at the system

3:00:04.960 --> 3:00:06.960
 level I mean I'm good at all of that

3:00:06.960 --> 3:00:08.960
 but the most leverage comes

3:00:08.960 --> 3:00:10.960
 from making the decisions that are a little bit

3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:12.960
 higher up where you figure out

3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:14.960
 how to change your large scale problems

3:00:14.960 --> 3:00:16.960
 so that these lower level problems

3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:18.960
 are easier to do or it makes it possible

3:00:18.960 --> 3:00:20.960
 to do them in a

3:00:20.960 --> 3:00:22.960
 in a uniquely fast way

3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:24.960
 so most of my

3:00:24.960 --> 3:00:26.960
 you know my big wins in a lot of ways

3:00:26.960 --> 3:00:28.960
 from all the way from the early games through

3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:30.960
 you know through VR and the aerospace

3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:32.960
 work that I'm doing and did

3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:34.960
 and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on

3:00:34.960 --> 3:00:36.960
 now is finding an angle on something

3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:38.960
 that means you trade off

3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:40.960
 something that you maybe think

3:00:40.960 --> 3:00:42.960
 you need but it turns out you don't need

3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:44.960
 and by making a sacrifice in one place

3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:46.960
 you can get big advantages

3:00:46.960 --> 3:00:48.960
 in another place.

3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:50.960
 Is it clear at which level of the system

3:00:50.960 --> 3:00:52.960
 those big advantages

3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:54.960
 can be gained? It's not always

3:00:54.960 --> 3:00:56.960
 clear and that's why the thing that

3:00:56.960 --> 3:00:58.960
 that I try to make one of my core

3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:00.960
 values and I

3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:02.960
 proselytize to a lot of people is

3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:04.960
 trying to know the entire stack

3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:06.960
 you know trying to see through

3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:08.960
 everything that happens and it's almost

3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:10.960
 impossible on like the web browser

3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:12.960
 level of things where there's so many levels

3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:14.960
 to it but you should at least understand

3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:16.960
 what they all are even if you can't understand

3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:18.960
 all the performance characteristics at

3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:20.960
 each level but it goes all the way

3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:22.960
 down to literally the hardware

3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:24.960
 so what does the what is this

3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:26.960
 chip capable of and

3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:28.960
 what is this software that you're writing capable

3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:30.960
 of and then with this architecture you put

3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:32.960
 on top of that then the ecosystem around

3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:34.960
 it all the people that are

3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:36.960
 working on it so there are

3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:38.960
 all these decisions and

3:01:38.960 --> 3:01:40.960
 they're never made in a globally optimal way

3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:42.960
 but sometimes you can drive

3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:44.960
 a thread of global optimality through it

3:01:44.960 --> 3:01:46.960
 you can't look at everything it's too complicated

3:01:46.960 --> 3:01:48.960
 but sometimes you can step

3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:50.960
 back up and make a different

3:01:50.960 --> 3:01:52.960
 decision and we kind of went through this on the

3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:54.960
 graphic side on Quake where

3:01:54.960 --> 3:01:56.960
 in some ways it was kind of bad where

3:01:56.960 --> 3:01:58.960
 Michael would spend his time

3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:00.960
 writing like I'd rough out

3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:02.960
 the basic routines like okay here's our

3:02:02.960 --> 3:02:04.960
 span rasterizer and he would spend

3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:06.960
 a month writing this

3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:08.960
 beautiful cycle optimized

3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:10.960
 piece of assembly language that

3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:12.960
 does what I asked

3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:14.960
 it to do and he did it faster than

3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:16.960
 my original code would do or probably

3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:18.960
 what I would be able to do even if I had spent

3:02:18.960 --> 3:02:20.960
 that month on it but then

3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:22.960
 we'd have some cases when I'd be like

3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:24.960
 okay well I figured out at this

3:02:24.960 --> 3:02:26.960
 higher level instead of drawing these in

3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:28.960
 a painter's order here I do a span

3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:30.960
 buffer and it cuts out

3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:32.960
 30% or 40% of all

3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:34.960
 of these pixels but it means you need to

3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:36.960
 rewrite kind of this interface of all of

3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:38.960
 that and I could tell that wore on him a

3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:40.960
 little bit but in the end it was

3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:42.960
 it was the right thing to do where we wound up

3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:44.960
 changing that rasterization

3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:46.960
 approach and we wound up with a super optimized

3:02:46.960 --> 3:02:48.960
 assembly language

3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:50.960
 core loop and then a good

3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:52.960
 system around it which minimized how much

3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:54.960
 that had to be called

3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:56.960
 in order to be able to do this kind of system

3:02:56.960 --> 3:02:58.960
 level thinking whether we're talking

3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:00.960
 about game development

3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:02.960
 aerospace

3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:04.960
 nuclear energy

3:03:04.960 --> 3:03:06.960
 AI

3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:08.960
 VR you have to be able to

3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:10.960
 understand the hardware

3:03:10.960 --> 3:03:12.960
 the low level software

3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:14.960
 the high level software the design

3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:16.960
 decisions the whole thing the full

3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:18.960
 stack of it. Yeah and that's where

3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:20.960
 a lot of these things become possible

3:03:20.960 --> 3:03:22.960
 when you're really when you're bringing

3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:24.960
 the future forward I mean there's a pace

3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:26.960
 that everything just kind of glides towards

3:03:26.960 --> 3:03:28.960
 where we have a lot of progress that's happening

3:03:28.960 --> 3:03:30.960
 at such a different so many different ways

3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:32.960
 you kind of slide towards progress just

3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:34.960
 left to your own programs just get faster

3:03:34.960 --> 3:03:36.960
 for a while it wasn't clear if they were

3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:38.960
 going to get fatter more than they get

3:03:38.960 --> 3:03:40.960
 quicker than they get faster and it cancels out

3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:42.960
 but it is clear now in retrospect now

3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:44.960
 programs just get faster and have gotten

3:03:44.960 --> 3:03:46.960
 faster for a long time

3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:48.960
 but if you want to do something like back

3:03:48.960 --> 3:03:50.960
 of that original talking about

3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:52.960
 scrolling games say what this needs to

3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:54.960
 be five times faster well

3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:56.960
 we can wait six years

3:03:56.960 --> 3:03:58.960
 and just it'll naturally get that much

3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:00.960
 faster at that time

3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:02.960
 or you come up with some really clever way of

3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:04.960
 doing it so there are those

3:04:04.960 --> 3:04:06.960
 opportunities like that in a whole bunch

3:04:06.960 --> 3:04:08.960
 of different areas now

3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:10.960
 most programmers don't need to be

3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:12.960
 thinking about that there's not that many

3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:14.960
 you know there's a lot of opportunities for

3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:16.960
 this but it's not everyone's work a day type

3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:18.960
 stuff so everyone doesn't have to know

3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:20.960
 how all these things work they don't have

3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:22.960
 to know how their compiler works how

3:04:22.960 --> 3:04:24.960
 you know the processor chip manages

3:04:24.960 --> 3:04:26.960
 cache eviction and all these

3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:28.960
 low level things but

3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:30.960
 sometimes there are powerful opportunities

3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:32.960
 that you can look at and say

3:04:32.960 --> 3:04:34.960
 we can bring the future

3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:36.960
 five years faster

3:04:36.960 --> 3:04:38.960
 you know we can do something that wouldn't it be

3:04:38.960 --> 3:04:40.960
 great if we could do this well we can do

3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:42.960
 it today if we make a certain

3:04:42.960 --> 3:04:44.960
 set of decisions and

3:04:44.960 --> 3:04:46.960
 it is in some ways smoke and mirrors

3:04:46.960 --> 3:04:48.960
 where you say it's like doom was

3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:50.960
 a lot of smoke and mirrors where people

3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:52.960
 thought it was more capable than it actually

3:04:52.960 --> 3:04:54.960
 was but we picked the right

3:04:54.960 --> 3:04:56.960
 smoke and mirrors to deploy in the game

3:04:56.960 --> 3:04:58.960
 where by doing this

3:04:58.960 --> 3:05:00.960
 people will think that it's more general

3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:02.960
 we're gonna amaze them with what they've got here

3:05:02.960 --> 3:05:04.960
 and they won't notice

3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:06.960
 that it doesn't do these other things

3:05:06.960 --> 3:05:08.960
 so smart decision making

3:05:08.960 --> 3:05:10.960
 at that point that's where that

3:05:10.960 --> 3:05:12.960
 that kind of global

3:05:12.960 --> 3:05:14.960
 holistic top down view

3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:16.960
 can work and

3:05:16.960 --> 3:05:18.960
 I'm

3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:20.960
 really a strong believer that technology

3:05:20.960 --> 3:05:22.960
 should be

3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:24.960
 sitting at that table having those discussions

3:05:24.960 --> 3:05:26.960
 because you do have cases where you say well

3:05:26.960 --> 3:05:28.960
 you want to be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever

3:05:28.960 --> 3:05:30.960
 where it's a pure design

3:05:30.960 --> 3:05:32.960
 solution and

3:05:32.960 --> 3:05:34.960
 that's in some

3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:36.960
 cases now where you truly have almost infinite

3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:38.960
 resources like if you're trying to do

3:05:38.960 --> 3:05:40.960
 a scrolling game on the PC

3:05:40.960 --> 3:05:42.960
 now you don't even have to talk to a technology

3:05:42.960 --> 3:05:44.960
 person you can just have

3:05:44.960 --> 3:05:46.960
 any intern can make that go run

3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:48.960
 as fast as it needs to there and it can be

3:05:48.960 --> 3:05:50.960
 completely design based

3:05:50.960 --> 3:05:52.960
 but if you're trying to do something that's hard

3:05:52.960 --> 3:05:54.960
 either that can't be done

3:05:54.960 --> 3:05:56.960
 for resources like VR on a mobile

3:05:56.960 --> 3:05:58.960
 chipset or that we don't even know how

3:05:58.960 --> 3:06:00.960
 to do yet like artificial general intelligence

3:06:00.960 --> 3:06:02.960
 it's probably going to be

3:06:02.960 --> 3:06:04.960
 a matter of coming at it from an angle

3:06:04.960 --> 3:06:06.960
 like I mean for AGI we have some of

3:06:06.960 --> 3:06:08.960
 like some of the Hutter principles

3:06:08.960 --> 3:06:10.960
 about how you can

3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:12.960
 sort of some of that there are theoretical

3:06:12.960 --> 3:06:14.960
 ways that you can say this is the optimal

3:06:14.960 --> 3:06:16.960
 learning algorithm that can solve everything

3:06:16.960 --> 3:06:18.960
 but it's completely impractical you know

3:06:18.960 --> 3:06:20.960
 you just can't do that so

3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:22.960
 clearly you have to make some concessions

3:06:22.960 --> 3:06:24.960
 for general intelligence

3:06:24.960 --> 3:06:26.960
 and nobody knows what the right ones are

3:06:26.960 --> 3:06:28.960
 yet so people are taking different

3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:30.960
 angles of attack I hope I've got something

3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:32.960
 clever to come up with in that space

3:06:32.960 --> 3:06:34.960
 it's been surprising to me

3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:36.960
 and I think perhaps it is a

3:06:36.960 --> 3:06:38.960
 principle of progress that

3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:40.960
 smoking mirrors somehow is the way

3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:42.960
 you build the future

3:06:42.960 --> 3:06:44.960
 you kind of

3:06:44.960 --> 3:06:46.960
 fake it till you make it

3:06:46.960 --> 3:06:48.960
 and you almost always make it and I think that's going to be

3:06:48.960 --> 3:06:50.960
 the way we achieve AGI

3:06:50.960 --> 3:06:52.960
 that's going to be the way we build

3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:54.960
 consciousness into our machines

3:06:54.960 --> 3:06:56.960
 is there's you know

3:06:56.960 --> 3:06:58.960
 philosophers debate about the touring test

3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:00.960
 is essentially about faking it

3:07:00.960 --> 3:07:02.960
 till you make it

3:07:02.960 --> 3:07:04.960
 you start by faking it

3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:06.960
 and I think that always leads

3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:08.960
 to making it

3:07:08.960 --> 3:07:10.960
 because if you look at history

3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:12.960
 arguments when as soon as people start talking about

3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:14.960
 qualia and consciousness

3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:16.960
 and Chinese rooms and things it's like

3:07:16.960 --> 3:07:18.960
 I just check out I just don't think there's any value

3:07:18.960 --> 3:07:20.960
 in those conversations it's just like

3:07:20.960 --> 3:07:22.960
 go ahead tell me it's not going to work

3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:24.960
 I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways

3:07:24.960 --> 3:07:26.960
 I don't know if you work with legged robots

3:07:26.960 --> 3:07:28.960
 there's a bunch of these

3:07:28.960 --> 3:07:30.960
 they make

3:07:30.960 --> 3:07:32.960
 they sure as heck make me feel like they're conscious

3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:34.960
 in a certain

3:07:34.960 --> 3:07:36.960
 way that's not here today

3:07:36.960 --> 3:07:38.960
 but is

3:07:38.960 --> 3:07:40.960
 you could see the kernel

3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:42.960
 it's like

3:07:42.960 --> 3:07:44.960
 the flame

3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:46.960
 the beginnings of a flame

3:07:46.960 --> 3:07:48.960
 we don't have line of sight but there's glimmerings

3:07:48.960 --> 3:07:50.960
 of light in the distance for all of these things

3:07:50.960 --> 3:07:52.960
 yeah I'm hearing murmuring in a distant

3:07:52.960 --> 3:07:54.960
 room

3:07:54.960 --> 3:07:56.960
 well let me ask you a human question here

3:07:56.960 --> 3:07:58.960
 you've in the game

3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:00.960
 design space you've done a lot of incredible work

3:08:00.960 --> 3:08:02.960
 throughout but in terms

3:08:02.960 --> 3:08:04.960
 of game design

3:08:04.960 --> 3:08:06.960
 you have changed the world and there's a few people

3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:08.960
 around you that did the same

3:08:08.960 --> 3:08:10.960
 so famously there's some animosity

3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:12.960
 there's much love

3:08:12.960 --> 3:08:14.960
 but there's some animosity between you

3:08:14.960 --> 3:08:16.960
 and John Romero

3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:18.960
 what is at the core of that animosity

3:08:18.960 --> 3:08:20.960
 and human tension

3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:22.960
 so there really hasn't been

3:08:22.960 --> 3:08:24.960
 for a long time and even at the beginning

3:08:24.960 --> 3:08:26.960
 it's like yes

3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:28.960
 I did push Romero out of the company

3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:30.960
 and

3:08:30.960 --> 3:08:32.960
 one of the things that I look back

3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:34.960
 if I could go back telling my younger self

3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:36.960
 some advice about things

3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:38.960
 the original

3:08:38.960 --> 3:08:40.960
 founding

3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:42.960
 corporate structure of id software

3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:44.960
 really led to a bunch of problems

3:08:44.960 --> 3:08:46.960
 we started off with us as

3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:48.960
 equal partners

3:08:48.960 --> 3:08:50.960
 and we had a buy sell agreement because we didn't

3:08:50.960 --> 3:08:52.960
 want outsiders to be telling us what to do

3:08:52.960 --> 3:08:54.960
 inside the company

3:08:54.960 --> 3:08:56.960
 and that did lead to a bunch of the

3:08:56.960 --> 3:08:58.960
 problems where I was sitting here going

3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:00.960
 it's like alright

3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:02.960
 I'm working harder than anyone

3:09:02.960 --> 3:09:04.960
 I'm doing these technologies

3:09:04.960 --> 3:09:06.960
 nobody's done before

3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:08.960
 but we're all equal partners

3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:10.960
 and then I see somebody that's

3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:12.960
 not working as hard

3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:14.960
 and it's

3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:16.960
 I can't say I was the most mature about that

3:09:16.960 --> 3:09:18.960
 I was 20 something years old

3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:20.960
 and it did

3:09:20.960 --> 3:09:22.960
 bother me when I'm like everybody

3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:24.960
 we need all pulled together and we've done it before

3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:26.960
 everybody we know we can do this

3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:28.960
 get together and we grind it all out

3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:30.960
 but not everybody wanted

3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:32.960
 to do that for for all time

3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:34.960
 you know and I was the youngest one of the

3:09:34.960 --> 3:09:36.960
 crowd there I had different

3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:38.960
 sets of kind of backgrounds

3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:40.960
 and motivations and left

3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:42.960
 at that point where

3:09:42.960 --> 3:09:44.960
 it was I'm alright

3:09:44.960 --> 3:09:46.960
 either everybody has to be contributing

3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:48.960
 like up to this level or they

3:09:48.960 --> 3:09:50.960
 need to get pushed out was not

3:09:50.960 --> 3:09:52.960
 I am that was not a

3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:54.960
 great situation and I look back

3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:56.960
 on it and know that

3:09:56.960 --> 3:09:58.960
 we pushed people out of the company that could

3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:00.960
 have contributed if there was

3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:02.960
 a different framework for them

3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:04.960
 and the modern kind of Silicon Valley

3:10:04.960 --> 3:10:06.960
 like let your stock vest over a time period

3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:08.960
 and maybe it's non voting stock

3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:10.960
 and all those different things we knew nothing about

3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:12.960
 any of that I mean we we didn't know

3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:14.960
 what we were doing in terms of corporate

3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:16.960
 structure or anything so if you think

3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:18.960
 the framework was different some of the

3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:20.960
 human tension could have been a little bit

3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:22.960
 almost certainly would have I

3:10:22.960 --> 3:10:24.960
 mean I look back at that and

3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:26.960
 and it's like even trying to summon up

3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:28.960
 in my mind it's like I know

3:10:28.960 --> 3:10:30.960
 I was really really angry

3:10:30.960 --> 3:10:32.960
 about I am you know like

3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:34.960
 Romero not working as hard as I wanted

3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:36.960
 him to work or not carrying

3:10:36.960 --> 3:10:38.960
 his load on the design for quake

3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:40.960
 and coming up with things there

3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:42.960
 but you know he was definitely doing things

3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:44.960
 he made some of the best levels there

3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:46.960
 he was working with our I some of

3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:48.960
 our external teams like Raven on the

3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:50.960
 licensing side of things

3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:52.960
 I am you know but there were differences

3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:54.960
 of opinion about it

3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:56.960
 but he landed you know right on his

3:10:56.960 --> 3:10:58.960
 feet he went he got 20 million dollars

3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:00.960
 from Eidos to go do I on storm

3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:02.960
 and he got to do things his way

3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:04.960
 and spun up three teams simultaneously

3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:06.960
 because that was always one of the

3:11:06.960 --> 3:11:08.960
 one of the challenging things in it it

3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:10.960
 where we were doing these single string

3:11:10.960 --> 3:11:12.960
 one project after another

3:11:12.960 --> 3:11:14.960
 and I think some of them you know

3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:16.960
 wanted to grow the company more and I

3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:18.960
 didn't because I knew people that were

3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:20.960
 saying that oh companies turn to shit

3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:22.960
 when you got 50 employees it's just

3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:24.960
 a different world there and I loved

3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:26.960
 our little dozen people

3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:28.960
 working on the projects

3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:30.960
 but you can look at and say well

3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:32.960
 business realities matter it's like

3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:34.960
 you're super successful here and we could

3:11:34.960 --> 3:11:36.960
 we could take a swing and a miss on

3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:38.960
 something but you do it a couple times

3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:40.960
 and you're out of luck there's

3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:42.960
 there's a reason companies try to have

3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:44.960
 multiple teams running at one time

3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:46.960
 I am and so

3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:48.960
 something I didn't really appreciate back then

3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:50.960
 so if you look past all that

3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:52.960
 you did create some amazing things together

3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:54.960
 what did you love about John Romero

3:11:54.960 --> 3:11:56.960
 what did you respect and appreciate about

3:11:56.960 --> 3:11:58.960
 what did you admire about him

3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:00.960
 what did you learn from him

3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:02.960
 when I met him he was the coolest programmer I had ever met

3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:04.960
 I you know he had done all of this

3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:06.960
 stuff he had he had made all of these

3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:08.960
 games he had worked at

3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:10.960
 you know one of the companies that I thought was the coolest

3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:12.960
 at origin systems and

3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:14.960
 he knew all this stuff he made things

3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:16.960
 happen fast and he could

3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:18.960
 it was also kind of a polymath about this where

3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:20.960
 he could do he made his own he drew his

3:12:20.960 --> 3:12:22.960
 own art he made his own levels as well

3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:24.960
 as you know we worked on sound design

3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:26.960
 systems on top of actually

3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:28.960
 being a really good programmer

3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:30.960
 and we had you know we went through

3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:32.960
 a little it was kind of fun where one of

3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:34.960
 the early things that we did where

3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:36.960
 there was kind of the young buck bit going in

3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:38.960
 where I was the new guy

3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:40.960
 and he was the kind of the

3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:42.960
 he was the top man programmer at

3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:44.960
 the soft disk area and eventually

3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:46.960
 we had sort of a challenge over the weekend

3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:48.960
 that we were going to like race to

3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:50.960
 implement this game to port one of our PC games

3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:52.960
 back down to the Apple too

3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:54.960
 and that was where we finally kind of became clear

3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:55.960
 it's like okay

3:12:55.960 --> 3:12:57.960
 Carmack stands a little bit apart on the

3:12:57.960 --> 3:12:59.960
 programming side of things and

3:12:59.960 --> 3:13:01.960
 but Romero then very gracefully

3:13:01.960 --> 3:13:03.960
 moved into well he'll work on the tools

3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:05.960
 he'll work on the systems

3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.960
 do some of the game design stuff as well as

3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:09.960
 contributing on starting

3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:11.960
 to lead the design aspects of a lot of things

3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:13.960
 so he was

3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:15.960
 enormously valuable

3:13:15.960 --> 3:13:17.960
 in the early stuff and so much of Doom

3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:19.960
 and even Quake have his stamp

3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:21.960
 on it in a lot of ways

3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:23.960
 but you know he wasn't

3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:25.960
 at the same level of focus that

3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:27.960
 I brought to the work that we were

3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:29.960
 doing there and he really did

3:13:29.960 --> 3:13:31.960
 we hit

3:13:31.960 --> 3:13:33.960
 such a degree of success that

3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:35.960
 it was all in the press about that

3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:37.960
 the Rockstar game programmers

3:13:37.960 --> 3:13:39.960
 I mean it's the Beatles problem

3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:41.960
 yeah I mean you know he ate it up

3:13:41.960 --> 3:13:43.960
 and he did personify it there was the whole

3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:45.960
 game developers with

3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:47.960
 Ferraris that we had

3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:49.960
 there and I thought that

3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:51.960
 you know that led to some

3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:53.960
 challenges there but

3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:55.960
 so much of the

3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:57.960
 you know the stuff that was great in the games

3:13:57.960 --> 3:13:59.960
 did come from him and I would certainly

3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:01.960
 not take that away from him

3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:03.960
 and even after we parted

3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:05.960
 ways and he took his swing with

3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:07.960
 Eidos in some ways he was

3:14:07.960 --> 3:14:09.960
 like he was ahead of the curve with mobile

3:14:09.960 --> 3:14:11.960
 gaming as well where

3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:13.960
 one of his companies after Eidos was working

3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:15.960
 on feature phone game development

3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:17.960
 and I wound up doing

3:14:17.960 --> 3:14:19.960
 some of that just before

3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:21.960
 the iPhone crossing over into the iPhone

3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:23.960
 phase there and that was something

3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:25.960
 that clearly did turn out to be a huge

3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:27.960
 thing although he was too

3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:29.960
 early for what he was working on

3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:31.960
 at that time you know we've had

3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:33.960
 pretty cordial relationships

3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:35.960
 where I was happy to talk with him anytime

3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:37.960
 I've run into him at a

3:14:37.960 --> 3:14:39.960
 conference I've actually had some other people

3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:41.960
 just say it's like oh you shouldn't

3:14:41.960 --> 3:14:43.960
 you know you shouldn't go over there and give him the time

3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:45.960
 of day or felt that

3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:47.960
 Masters of Doom was

3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:49.960
 you know like

3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:51.960
 played things up in a way that I shouldn't be

3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:53.960
 too happy with but I'm okay

3:14:53.960 --> 3:14:55.960
 with all of that. So you still got love

3:14:55.960 --> 3:14:57.960
 in your heart. Yeah I mean I just talked

3:14:57.960 --> 3:14:59.960
 with him like last year

3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:01.960
 I guess it was even this year about mentioning

3:15:01.960 --> 3:15:03.960
 that I'm going off doing this AI stuff

3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:05.960
 I'm going big into artificial intelligence

3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:07.960
 and he had a bunch of

3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:09.960
 ideas for how AI is going to

3:15:09.960 --> 3:15:11.960
 play into gaming and you know asked

3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:13.960
 if I was interested in collaborating and it's not

3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:15.960
 in line with what I'm

3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:17.960
 doing but I do you know

3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:19.960
 I wish almost everyone the best I mean

3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:21.960
 I know I may not have partnered on the best

3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:23.960
 of terms with you know with

3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:25.960
 some people but I was thrilled

3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:27.960
 to see Tom Hall writing

3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:29.960
 VR games now he wrote

3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:31.960
 working on a game called Demio which is

3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:33.960
 really an awesome VR game it's like

3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:35.960
 Dungeons and Dragons we all used to play Dungeons

3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:37.960
 and Dragons together that was one of the things that was what we did

3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:39.960
 on Sundays in the early

3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:41.960
 days I would dungeon master and they'd all play

3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:43.960
 and I you know so it really made

3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:45.960
 me smile seeing Tom involved with

3:15:45.960 --> 3:15:47.960
 an RPG game in virtual reality

3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:49.960
 you were

3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:51.960
 the CTO of Oculus

3:15:51.960 --> 3:15:53.960
 VR since 2013

3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:55.960
 and maybe less than a year involved

3:15:55.960 --> 3:15:57.960
 in a bit in

3:15:57.960 --> 3:15:59.960
 2019

3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:01.960
 Oculus was acquired by Facebook

3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:03.960
 now meta in

3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:05.960
 2014 you've spoken

3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:07.960
 brilliantly about both the low level details

3:16:07.960 --> 3:16:09.960
 the experimental design and the big picture vision

3:16:09.960 --> 3:16:11.960
 of virtual reality

3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:13.960
 let me ask you about the metaverse

3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:15.960
 the big question here both

3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:17.960
 philosophically and technically

3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:19.960
 how hard is it to build the metaverse

3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:21.960
 what is the metaverse in your view

3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:23.960
 you started with discussing

3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:25.960
 and thinking about quake as a kind of metaverse

3:16:25.960 --> 3:16:27.960
 as you think about

3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:29.960
 it today what is the metaverse

3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:31.960
 the thing that

3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:33.960
 could create this compelling user value

3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:35.960
 this experience that will change the world

3:16:35.960 --> 3:16:37.960
 and how hard is it to build it

3:16:37.960 --> 3:16:39.960
 so the term comes from

3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:41.960
 Neil Stephenson's book snow crash

3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:43.960
 which many of us had read back in

3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:45.960
 the 90s it was one of those kind of

3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:47.960
 formative books and

3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:49.960
 there was this sense that

3:16:49.960 --> 3:16:51.960
 the

3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:53.960
 the possibilities and kind of the freedom

3:16:53.960 --> 3:16:55.960
 and unlimited capabilities

3:16:55.960 --> 3:16:57.960
 to build a virtual world

3:16:57.960 --> 3:16:59.960
 that does whatever you want

3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:01.960
 whatever you ask of it has been a powerful draw

3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:03.960
 for generations of developers

3:17:03.960 --> 3:17:05.960
 game developers specifically

3:17:05.960 --> 3:17:07.960
 and people that are thinking about more

3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:09.960
 general purpose applications

3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:11.960
 so we were talking about that

3:17:11.960 --> 3:17:13.960
 back in the doom and quake days about

3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:15.960
 how do you wind up with an interconnected

3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:17.960
 set of worlds that you kind of visit

3:17:17.960 --> 3:17:19.960
 from one to another and as

3:17:19.960 --> 3:17:21.960
 web pages were becoming a thing you start

3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:23.960
 thinking about how what is the

3:17:23.960 --> 3:17:25.960
 interactive kind of 3D based

3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:27.960
 equivalent of this and there were

3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:29.960
 a lot of really bad takes you had

3:17:29.960 --> 3:17:31.960
 like vermal then

3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:33.960
 virtual reality markup languages

3:17:33.960 --> 3:17:35.960
 and there's aspects like that

3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:37.960
 that came from people saying

3:17:37.960 --> 3:17:39.960
 well what kind of capabilities

3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:41.960
 should we develop to

3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:43.960
 to enable this and that

3:17:43.960 --> 3:17:45.960
 kind of capability first work has usually

3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:47.960
 not panned out very well

3:17:47.960 --> 3:17:49.960
 on the other hand we have

3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:51.960
 successful games that started

3:17:51.960 --> 3:17:53.960
 with things like doom and quake

3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:55.960
 and communities that formed around those

3:17:55.960 --> 3:17:57.960
 and whether it was server lists

3:17:57.960 --> 3:17:59.960
 in the early days or literal

3:17:59.960 --> 3:18:01.960
 portaling between different games

3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:03.960
 and then modern things

3:18:03.960 --> 3:18:05.960
 that are on completely different order of magnitude

3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:07.960
 like minecraft and fortnite that have

3:18:07.960 --> 3:18:09.960
 100 million plus users

3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:11.960
 you know

3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:13.960
 I still think that that's the right way

3:18:13.960 --> 3:18:15.960
 to go to build the metaverse is

3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:17.960
 you build something that's amazing that people

3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:19.960
 love and people wind up spending all their

3:18:19.960 --> 3:18:21.960
 time in because it's awesome

3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:23.960
 and you expand the capabilities of that

3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:25.960
 so even if it's a very basic experience

3:18:25.960 --> 3:18:27.960
 as long as people

3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:29.960
 minecraft is an amazing case study

3:18:29.960 --> 3:18:31.960
 in so many things

3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:33.960
 where what's been able to be done with

3:18:33.960 --> 3:18:35.960
 that is really enlightening

3:18:35.960 --> 3:18:37.960
 and there are other cases

3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:39.960
 where like right now roblox

3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:41.960
 is basically a game construction

3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:43.960
 kit aimed at kids and that was a capability

3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:45.960
 first play and it's achieving scale

3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:47.960
 that's on the same order

3:18:47.960 --> 3:18:49.960
 of those things so

3:18:49.960 --> 3:18:51.960
 it's not impossible but

3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:53.960
 my preferred bet would be

3:18:53.960 --> 3:18:55.960
 you make something amazing that people love

3:18:55.960 --> 3:18:57.960
 and you make it better and better

3:18:57.960 --> 3:18:59.960
 and that's where I could say

3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:01.960
 we could have gone back and followed a path

3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:03.960
 kind of like that in the early days

3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:05.960
 if you just kind of take the same game

3:19:05.960 --> 3:19:07.960
 whether it's when Activision demonstrated

3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:09.960
 that you could make Call of Duty every year

3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:11.960
 and not only is it not bad

3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:13.960
 people kind of love it and it's a

3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:15.960
 it's very profitable

3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:17.960
 it's something like that

3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:19.960
 take a great game

3:19:19.960 --> 3:19:21.960
 release a new version every year

3:19:21.960 --> 3:19:23.960
 that lets the capabilities grow and expand

3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:25.960
 to start saying it's like okay

3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:27.960
 it's a game about running around and shooting things

3:19:27.960 --> 3:19:29.960
 but now you can have

3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:31.960
 bring your media into it

3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:33.960
 you can add persistence of

3:19:33.960 --> 3:19:35.960
 social sense signs of life

3:19:35.960 --> 3:19:37.960
 or whatever you want to add to it

3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:39.960
 I still think that's

3:19:39.960 --> 3:19:41.960
 quite a good position to take

3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:43.960
 and I think that

3:19:43.960 --> 3:19:45.960
 doing a bottoms up capability

3:19:45.960 --> 3:19:47.960
 approach with Horizon Worlds

3:19:47.960 --> 3:19:49.960
 where it's a fairly general purpose

3:19:49.960 --> 3:19:51.960
 creators can build whatever

3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:53.960
 they want in their sort of thing

3:19:53.960 --> 3:19:55.960
 I am you know it's

3:19:55.960 --> 3:19:57.960
 it's hard to compare and compete with something

3:19:57.960 --> 3:19:59.960
 like Fortnite which also has

3:19:59.960 --> 3:20:01.960
 enormous amounts of creativity

3:20:01.960 --> 3:20:03.960
 even though it was not designed originally

3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:05.960
 as a general purpose sort of thing

3:20:05.960 --> 3:20:07.960
 so there's we have examples on both sides

3:20:07.960 --> 3:20:09.960
 me personally

3:20:09.960 --> 3:20:11.960
 I would have bet on

3:20:11.960 --> 3:20:13.960
 to do entertainment

3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:15.960
 valuable destination first

3:20:15.960 --> 3:20:17.960
 and expanding from there

3:20:17.960 --> 3:20:19.960
 so

3:20:19.960 --> 3:20:21.960
 can you imagine the thing that will be

3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:23.960
 kind of if we look back

3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:25.960
 a couple centuries from now

3:20:25.960 --> 3:20:27.960
 and you think about the experiences

3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:29.960
 that marked

3:20:29.960 --> 3:20:31.960
 the singularity the transition

3:20:31.960 --> 3:20:33.960
 in

3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:35.960
 where most of our world

3:20:35.960 --> 3:20:37.960
 moved into virtual reality

3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:39.960
 what do you think those experiences will look like

3:20:39.960 --> 3:20:41.960
 so I do think it's going to be

3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:43.960
 kind of like the way the web

3:20:43.960 --> 3:20:45.960
 slowly took over where you're

3:20:45.960 --> 3:20:47.960
 the frog in the pot of water

3:20:47.960 --> 3:20:49.960
 that's slowly heating up where

3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:51.960
 having lived through all of that

3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:53.960
 I remember when it was shocking to start

3:20:53.960 --> 3:20:55.960
 seeing the first website address

3:20:55.960 --> 3:20:57.960
 on a billboard when you're like hey

3:20:57.960 --> 3:20:59.960
 my computer world is infecting the real world

3:20:59.960 --> 3:21:01.960
 you know this is spreading out

3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:03.960
 in some way but

3:21:03.960 --> 3:21:05.960
 there's still when you look back and say

3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:07.960
 well what made the web take off

3:21:07.960 --> 3:21:09.960
 and it wasn't

3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:11.960
 a big bang sort of moment there

3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:13.960
 it was a bunch of little things

3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:15.960
 that turned out not to even be the things

3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:17.960
 that are relevant now that

3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:19.960
 brought them into it so

3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:21.960
 well I wonder from I mean like you said

3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:23.960
 you're not a historian so maybe

3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:25.960
 there's a historian

3:21:25.960 --> 3:21:27.960
 out there that could really identify

3:21:27.960 --> 3:21:29.960
 that moment

3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:31.960
 data driven way it could be like

3:21:31.960 --> 3:21:33.960
 MySpace or something like that

3:21:33.960 --> 3:21:35.960
 maybe the first major social network

3:21:35.960 --> 3:21:37.960
 that really reached into

3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:39.960
 non geek

3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:41.960
 world or something like that

3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:43.960
 I think that's kind of the fallacy

3:21:43.960 --> 3:21:45.960
 of historians though looking for

3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:47.960
 some of those kind of primary dominant

3:21:47.960 --> 3:21:49.960
 causes where so many of

3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:51.960
 these things are like we see

3:21:51.960 --> 3:21:53.960
 an exponential curve but it's not because

3:21:53.960 --> 3:21:55.960
 like one thing is going exponential

3:21:55.960 --> 3:21:57.960
 it's because we have hundreds

3:21:57.960 --> 3:21:59.960
 of little sigmoid curves overlapped on

3:21:59.960 --> 3:22:01.960
 top of each other and they just happen to keep

3:22:01.960 --> 3:22:03.960
 adding up so that you've got something kind

3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:05.960
 of going exponential at any given point

3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:07.960
 but no single one of them

3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:09.960
 was the critical thing there were

3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:11.960
 dozens and dozens of things I mean

3:22:11.960 --> 3:22:13.960
 seeing the transitions of stuff like

3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:15.960
 as obviously MySpace giving way

3:22:15.960 --> 3:22:17.960
 to other things but even like blogging giving

3:22:17.960 --> 3:22:19.960
 way to social media

3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:21.960
 and getting resurrected in

3:22:21.960 --> 3:22:23.960
 other guys and the memes that

3:22:23.960 --> 3:22:25.960
 happened there dancing baby gift

3:22:25.960 --> 3:22:27.960
 or whatever the all your base

3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:29.960
 not belong to us whatever those

3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:31.960
 early memes that led to the modern

3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:33.960
 memes and the humor on

3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:35.960
 the different the different evolution

3:22:35.960 --> 3:22:37.960
 of humor on the internet I'm sure

3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:39.960
 the historians will also write books about

3:22:39.960 --> 3:22:41.960
 from the different website

3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:43.960
 that support to create the infrastructure

3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:45.960
 for that humor like Reddit and all that kind of stuff

3:22:45.960 --> 3:22:47.960
 so people will go back

3:22:47.960 --> 3:22:49.960
 and they will name firsts and critical

3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:51.960
 moments but it's probably going to

3:22:51.960 --> 3:22:53.960
 be a poor approximation of what actually

3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:55.960
 happens and we've already

3:22:55.960 --> 3:22:57.960
 seen like in the VR space where

3:22:57.960 --> 3:22:59.960
 it didn't play out the

3:22:59.960 --> 3:23:01.960
 way we thought it would in terms of what was going to be

3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:03.960
 like when the modern

3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:05.960
 era VR basically started with my E3

3:23:05.960 --> 3:23:07.960
 demo of Doom 3 on the Rift prototype

3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:09.960
 so we're like first person

3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:11.960
 shooters in VR match made in heaven

3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:13.960
 right and that didn't

3:23:13.960 --> 3:23:15.960
 work out that way at all they have

3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:17.960
 you know they have the most comfort problems with it

3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:19.960
 and then the most popular

3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:21.960
 virtual reality app is Beat Saber

3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:23.960
 which nobody predicted back then

3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:25.960
 what does that make you

3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:27.960
 like from first

3:23:27.960 --> 3:23:29.960
 principles if you were to like

3:23:29.960 --> 3:23:31.960
 reverse engineer that why

3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:33.960
 are these like silly fun games

3:23:33.960 --> 3:23:35.960
 well it actually makes

3:23:35.960 --> 3:23:37.960
 very clear sense when you

3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:39.960
 analyze it from hindsight

3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:41.960
 and look at the engineering reasons where

3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:43.960
 it's not just that it was a magical

3:23:43.960 --> 3:23:45.960
 quirky idea it was something that

3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:47.960
 played almost perfectly to what

3:23:47.960 --> 3:23:49.960
 turned out to be the real strengths of VR

3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:51.960
 where the one thing that I really

3:23:51.960 --> 3:23:53.960
 underestimated importance in VR

3:23:53.960 --> 3:23:55.960
 was the importance of the controllers

3:23:55.960 --> 3:23:57.960
 I was still thinking we could do a lot more

3:23:57.960 --> 3:23:59.960
 with the game pad and just the

3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:01.960
 amazingness of taking any existing game

3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:03.960
 being able to move your head around and look around

3:24:03.960 --> 3:24:05.960
 that was really amazing

3:24:05.960 --> 3:24:07.960
 but the controllers

3:24:07.960 --> 3:24:09.960
 were super important but the problem is

3:24:09.960 --> 3:24:11.960
 so many things that you do with the controllers

3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:13.960
 just suck it feels like

3:24:13.960 --> 3:24:15.960
 it breaks the illusion like trying to pick up glasses

3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:17.960
 with the controllers where you're like oh use the grip

3:24:17.960 --> 3:24:19.960
 button when you're kind of close and it'll

3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:21.960
 snap into your hand all of those

3:24:21.960 --> 3:24:23.960
 things are unnatural

3:24:23.960 --> 3:24:25.960
 actions that you do them and it's still

3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:27.960
 part of the VR experience but

3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:29.960
 beat saber winds up

3:24:29.960 --> 3:24:31.960
 I playing only to the

3:24:31.960 --> 3:24:33.960
 strengths it completely hides all the weaknesses

3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:35.960
 of it because you are holding

3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:37.960
 something in your hand you keep a solid grip

3:24:37.960 --> 3:24:39.960
 on it the whole time it slices

3:24:39.960 --> 3:24:41.960
 through things without ever bumping into

3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:43.960
 things you never get into the point where

3:24:43.960 --> 3:24:45.960
 you know I'm knocking on this table but in

3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:47.960
 VR my hand just goes right through it

3:24:47.960 --> 3:24:49.960
 so you've got something that

3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:51.960
 slices through so it's never

3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:53.960
 your brain telling you oh I should have hit something

3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:55.960
 you've got a lightsaber here it's just

3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:57.960
 you expect it to slice through everything

3:24:57.960 --> 3:24:59.960
 audio and music

3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:01.960
 turned out to be a really powerful

3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:03.960
 aspect of virtual reality where you're

3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:05.960
 blocking the world off and constructing

3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:07.960
 the world around you and

3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:09.960
 I and being something that can run

3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:11.960
 efficiently on even this relatively

3:25:11.960 --> 3:25:13.960
 low powered hardware and

3:25:13.960 --> 3:25:15.960
 can have a valuable loop

3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:17.960
 in a small amount of time where

3:25:17.960 --> 3:25:19.960
 a lot of modern games you're supposed

3:25:19.960 --> 3:25:21.960
 to sit down and play it for an hour just to get

3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:23.960
 anywhere sometimes a new game takes an hour to

3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:25.960
 get through the tutorial level and that's

3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:27.960
 not good for VR for a couple reasons

3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:29.960
 you do still have the comfort issues if

3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:31.960
 you're moving around at all but you've

3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:33.960
 also got just you know discomfort

3:25:33.960 --> 3:25:35.960
 from the headset battery life span

3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:37.960
 on the mobile versions so having

3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:39.960
 things that do break down into

3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:41.960
 three and four minute windows of play

3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:43.960
 that turns out to be very valuable from

3:25:43.960 --> 3:25:45.960
 a gameplay standpoint

3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:47.960
 so it winds up being kind of a perfect

3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:49.960
 form of all of these things that are really

3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:51.960
 good it doesn't have any of the comfort

3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:53.960
 problems you're not navigating around

3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:55.960
 you're standing still all the stuff flies

3:25:55.960 --> 3:25:57.960
 at you it has placed audio

3:25:57.960 --> 3:25:59.960
 strengths it adds

3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:01.960
 the whole fitness in VR nobody

3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:03.960
 was thinking about that back in the

3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:05.960
 at the beginning and it turns out that

3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:07.960
 that is an excellent daily

3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:09.960
 fitness thing to be doing if you go play

3:26:09.960 --> 3:26:11.960
 an hour of beat saver

3:26:11.960 --> 3:26:13.960
 or supernatural or something that is

3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:15.960
 legit solid exercise

3:26:15.960 --> 3:26:17.960
 and it's more fun than doing it

3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:19.960
 just about any other way there

3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:21.960
 so that's kind of the arcade stage

3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:23.960
 of things if I were to

3:26:23.960 --> 3:26:25.960
 say with my experience with VR

3:26:25.960 --> 3:26:27.960
 the thing that I think

3:26:27.960 --> 3:26:29.960
 is powerful is the

3:26:29.960 --> 3:26:31.960
 maybe it's not here yet

3:26:31.960 --> 3:26:33.960
 but the degree to which

3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:35.960
 it is immersive in the way

3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:37.960
 that quake is immersive

3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:39.960
 it takes you to another world

3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:41.960
 for me because I'm a fan of role

3:26:41.960 --> 3:26:43.960
 playing games

3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:45.960
 the Elder Scrolls series

3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:47.960
 like

3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:49.960
 Skyrim or even Daggerfall

3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:51.960
 it just takes you to another world

3:26:51.960 --> 3:26:53.960
 and when you're not in that world

3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:55.960
 you miss not being there

3:26:55.960 --> 3:26:57.960
 and then you just you kind of want to

3:26:57.960 --> 3:26:59.960
 stay there forever because life is

3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:01.960
 shitty

3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:03.960
 and you just want to go to this place

3:27:03.960 --> 3:27:05.960
 is that I there was a

3:27:05.960 --> 3:27:07.960
 there was a time when I

3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:09.960
 we were kind of asked to come up with

3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:11.960
 like what's your view about VR

3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:13.960
 and I am

3:27:13.960 --> 3:27:15.960
 my pitch was that it should be better inside

3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:17.960
 the headset than outside it's the world

3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:19.960
 as you want it and

3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:21.960
 everybody thought that was dystopian

3:27:21.960 --> 3:27:23.960
 and like that's like oh you're just going to

3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:25.960
 forget about the world outside

3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:27.960
 and I don't get that

3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:29.960
 mindset where the idea that

3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:31.960
 if you can make the world better inside

3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:33.960
 the headset than outside

3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:35.960
 you've just improved the person's life

3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:37.960
 that has a headset that can wear it

3:27:37.960 --> 3:27:39.960
 and there are plenty of things

3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:41.960
 that we just can't do for everyone in the

3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:43.960
 real world everybody can't have Richard Branson's

3:27:43.960 --> 3:27:45.960
 private island but everyone can have

3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:47.960
 a private VR island and it can have

3:27:47.960 --> 3:27:49.960
 the things that they want on it and there's

3:27:49.960 --> 3:27:51.960
 a lot of these kind of rivalrous goods

3:27:51.960 --> 3:27:53.960
 in the real world that VR

3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:55.960
 can just be better at

3:27:55.960 --> 3:27:57.960
 we can do a lot of things like that

3:27:57.960 --> 3:27:59.960
 that can be very very rich

3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:01.960
 so yeah I want the I think it's going to be

3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:03.960
 a positive thing this world where people want

3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:05.960
 to go back into their headset

3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:07.960
 where it can be better than somebody

3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:09.960
 in a tiny apartment

3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:11.960
 can have a palatial estate in virtual reality

3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:13.960
 that can have all their friends from all over the world

3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:15.960
 come over and visit them

3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:17.960
 without everybody getting on a plane

3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:19.960
 and meeting in some place

3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:21.960
 and dealing with all the other logistics hassles

3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:23.960
 there is real value in the

3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:25.960
 you know the presence that you can get

3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:27.960
 for remote meetings it's

3:28:27.960 --> 3:28:29.960
 it's all the little things that we need to sort out

3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:31.960
 but those are things that we have

3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:33.960
 line of sight on people

3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:35.960
 that have been in like a good VR meeting

3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:37.960
 using work rooms where you can say

3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:39.960
 oh that was better than a zoom meeting

3:28:39.960 --> 3:28:41.960
 but of course it's more of a hassle

3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:43.960
 to get into it not everyone has the headset

3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:45.960
 interoperability is worse

3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:47.960
 you can't have you cap out at a certain number

3:28:47.960 --> 3:28:49.960
 there's all these things that need to be fixed

3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:51.960
 but that's one of those things you can look at

3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:53.960
 and say we know there's value there

3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:55.960
 we just need to really grind hard

3:28:55.960 --> 3:28:57.960
 file off all the rough edges

3:28:57.960 --> 3:28:59.960
 and make that possible

3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:01.960
 so you do think we have line of sight

3:29:01.960 --> 3:29:03.960
 because

3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:05.960
 there's a reason like

3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:07.960
 I do this podcast

3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:09.960
 in person for example

3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:11.960
 doing it remotely

3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:13.960
 it's not the same

3:29:13.960 --> 3:29:15.960
 and if somebody were to ask me

3:29:15.960 --> 3:29:17.960
 why it's not the same I wouldn't be able to write down

3:29:17.960 --> 3:29:19.960
 exactly why

3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:21.960
 but you're saying

3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:23.960
 that it's possible whatever the magic is

3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:25.960
 for in person interaction

3:29:25.960 --> 3:29:27.960
 that immersiveness

3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:29.960
 of the experience

3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:31.960
 we are almost there

3:29:31.960 --> 3:29:33.960
 yes so the idea of

3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:35.960
 like I'm

3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:37.960
 doing a VR interview with someone

3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:39.960
 I'm not saying it's here right now

3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:41.960
 but you can see glimmers

3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:43.960
 of what it should be and

3:29:43.960 --> 3:29:45.960
 we largely know what would need to be

3:29:45.960 --> 3:29:47.960
 fixed and improved to

3:29:47.960 --> 3:29:49.960
 like you say there's a difference between

3:29:49.960 --> 3:29:51.960
 a remote interview doing a podcast over zoom

3:29:51.960 --> 3:29:53.960
 or something and face to face

3:29:53.960 --> 3:29:55.960
 there's that sense of presence

3:29:55.960 --> 3:29:57.960
 that immediacy the super low latency

3:29:57.960 --> 3:29:59.960
 responsiveness being able to see

3:29:59.960 --> 3:30:01.960
 all the subtle things there

3:30:01.960 --> 3:30:03.960
 just occupying the same field of view

3:30:03.960 --> 3:30:05.960
 and all of those are things that we absolutely

3:30:05.960 --> 3:30:07.960
 can do in VR

3:30:07.960 --> 3:30:09.960
 and that simple case of

3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:11.960
 a small meeting with a couple people

3:30:11.960 --> 3:30:13.960
 that's the much easier case than everybody thinks

3:30:13.960 --> 3:30:15.960
 the ready player one multiverse with a thousand

3:30:15.960 --> 3:30:17.960
 people going across that you know a huge bridge

3:30:17.960 --> 3:30:19.960
 to amazing places

3:30:19.960 --> 3:30:21.960
 that's harder in a lot of other technical ways

3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:23.960
 not to say we can't also do

3:30:23.960 --> 3:30:25.960
 that but that's further away and has more challenges

3:30:25.960 --> 3:30:27.960
 but this small thing about

3:30:27.960 --> 3:30:29.960
 being able to have a meeting with

3:30:29.960 --> 3:30:31.960
 one or a few people

3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:33.960
 and have it feel real

3:30:33.960 --> 3:30:35.960
 feel like you're there

3:30:35.960 --> 3:30:37.960
 you have the same interactions and talking with them

3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:39.960
 you get subtle cues as we start

3:30:39.960 --> 3:30:41.960
 getting eye and face tracking and some of the other things

3:30:41.960 --> 3:30:43.960
 on high end headsets

3:30:43.960 --> 3:30:45.960
 a lot of that is going to come over

3:30:45.960 --> 3:30:47.960
 and it doesn't have to be

3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:49.960
 as good this is an important

3:30:49.960 --> 3:30:51.960
 thing that people miss where

3:30:51.960 --> 3:30:53.960
 there was a lot of people that

3:30:53.960 --> 3:30:55.960
 especially rich people that would

3:30:55.960 --> 3:30:57.960
 look at VR and say it's like

3:30:57.960 --> 3:30:59.960
 this just isn't that good

3:30:59.960 --> 3:31:01.960
 and I'd say it's like well you've already been

3:31:01.960 --> 3:31:03.960
 court side backstage

3:31:03.960 --> 3:31:05.960
 and you know on pit row and you've done all of

3:31:05.960 --> 3:31:07.960
 these experiences because you get to do them in

3:31:07.960 --> 3:31:09.960
 real life but most people don't

3:31:09.960 --> 3:31:11.960
 get to and even if the experience

3:31:11.960 --> 3:31:13.960
 is only half as good if it's something

3:31:13.960 --> 3:31:15.960
 that they never would have gotten to do before

3:31:15.960 --> 3:31:17.960
 it's still a very good thing

3:31:17.960 --> 3:31:19.960
 and as we can push that number up

3:31:19.960 --> 3:31:21.960
 over time it has a minimum

3:31:21.960 --> 3:31:23.960
 viable value level

3:31:23.960 --> 3:31:25.960
 when it does something

3:31:25.960 --> 3:31:27.960
 that is valuable enough to people as long as it's

3:31:27.960 --> 3:31:29.960
 better inside the headset on any metric

3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:31.960
 than it is outside and people choose to go

3:31:31.960 --> 3:31:33.960
 there we're on the right path

3:31:33.960 --> 3:31:35.960
 and we have a value gradient that

3:31:35.960 --> 3:31:37.960
 I'm just always hammering on we can just follow

3:31:37.960 --> 3:31:39.960
 this value gradient just keep making things

3:31:39.960 --> 3:31:41.960
 better rather than

3:31:41.960 --> 3:31:43.960
 going for that one

3:31:43.960 --> 3:31:45.960
 close your eyes swing for the fences

3:31:45.960 --> 3:31:47.960
 I kind of silver bullet

3:31:47.960 --> 3:31:49.960
 approach well I wonder if there's a value

3:31:49.960 --> 3:31:51.960
 gradient for in person meetings because if you

3:31:51.960 --> 3:31:53.960
 get that right

3:31:53.960 --> 3:31:55.960
 that would change the world

3:31:55.960 --> 3:31:57.960
 you don't need a ready player one

3:31:57.960 --> 3:31:59.960
 but

3:31:59.960 --> 3:32:01.960
 I wonder if there's that

3:32:01.960 --> 3:32:03.960
 value gradient you can follow

3:32:03.960 --> 3:32:05.960
 along because

3:32:05.960 --> 3:32:07.960
 if there is any follow it

3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:09.960
 then there'll be a certain

3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:11.960
 like face shift

3:32:11.960 --> 3:32:13.960
 a certain point where people

3:32:13.960 --> 3:32:15.960
 will shift from

3:32:15.960 --> 3:32:17.960
 from zoom to this

3:32:17.960 --> 3:32:19.960
 I wonder

3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:21.960
 what

3:32:21.960 --> 3:32:23.960
 what are the bottlenecks is it software

3:32:23.960 --> 3:32:25.960
 is it hardware like is it

3:32:25.960 --> 3:32:27.960
 is it all about latency

3:32:27.960 --> 3:32:29.960
 so I have big arguments

3:32:29.960 --> 3:32:31.960
 internally about strategic

3:32:31.960 --> 3:32:33.960
 things like that where I

3:32:33.960 --> 3:32:35.960
 like the next headset that's

3:32:35.960 --> 3:32:37.960
 coming out that we've made

3:32:37.960 --> 3:32:39.960
 various announcements about is going to be a higher end

3:32:39.960 --> 3:32:41.960
 headset more expensive more features

3:32:41.960 --> 3:32:43.960
 lots of people want to make those tradeoffs

3:32:43.960 --> 3:32:45.960
 I you know we'll see

3:32:45.960 --> 3:32:47.960
 what the market has to say about the

3:32:47.960 --> 3:32:49.960
 exact tradeoffs we've made here

3:32:49.960 --> 3:32:51.960
 but if you want to replace zoom

3:32:51.960 --> 3:32:53.960
 you need to have something that everybody has

3:32:53.960 --> 3:32:55.960
 and

3:32:55.960 --> 3:32:57.960
 I like cheaper because

3:32:57.960 --> 3:32:59.960
 also lighter

3:32:59.960 --> 3:33:01.960
 and cheaper wind up being

3:33:01.960 --> 3:33:03.960
 a virtuous cycle there where

3:33:03.960 --> 3:33:05.960
 expensive and more features

3:33:05.960 --> 3:33:07.960
 tends to also lead towards heavier and it just

3:33:07.960 --> 3:33:09.960
 kind of goes it's like let's add more features the features

3:33:09.960 --> 3:33:11.960
 are not

3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:13.960
 they have physical presence and weight

3:33:13.960 --> 3:33:15.960
 and draw from batteries and all of those

3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:17.960
 things so I've always favored

3:33:17.960 --> 3:33:19.960
 a lower end cheaper

3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:21.960
 faster approach that's why

3:33:21.960 --> 3:33:23.960
 I was always behind the mobile side of

3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:25.960
 VR rather than the higher end PC

3:33:25.960 --> 3:33:27.960
 headsets I think that's

3:33:27.960 --> 3:33:29.960
 proven out well but there's

3:33:29.960 --> 3:33:31.960
 I you always ideally we have

3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:33.960
 a whole range of things but if you've only got

3:33:33.960 --> 3:33:35.960
 one or two things it's important

3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:37.960
 that those two things cover the

3:33:37.960 --> 3:33:39.960
 you know the scope that you think is most

3:33:39.960 --> 3:33:41.960
 important when we're in a world when it's like

3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:43.960
 cell phones and there's 50 of them on the market

3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:45.960
 covering every conceivable

3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:47.960
 ecological niche you want that's going to be great

3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:49.960
 but we're not going to be there for a while

3:33:49.960 --> 3:33:51.960
 where the bottlenecks is it the hardware

3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:53.960
 the software yeah so right

3:33:53.960 --> 3:33:55.960
 now I am you can play

3:33:55.960 --> 3:33:57.960
 you can get workrooms

3:33:57.960 --> 3:33:59.960
 on quest and you can set up these

3:33:59.960 --> 3:34:01.960
 things and it's a pretty good experience it's

3:34:01.960 --> 3:34:03.960
 surprisingly good I haven't tried it it's

3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:05.960
 surprisingly good yeah the voice

3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:07.960
 latency is better on that

3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:09.960
 than a lot better than a zoom meeting

3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:11.960
 so you've got a more a better sense

3:34:11.960 --> 3:34:13.960
 of immediacy there the

3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:15.960
 expressions that you get from

3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:17.960
 the current hardware with just

3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:19.960
 kind of your controllers and your head

3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:21.960
 is pretty realistic feeling you've got a

3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:23.960
 pretty good sense of being there with someone

3:34:23.960 --> 3:34:25.960
 are these like

3:34:25.960 --> 3:34:27.960
 avatars of people yeah

3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:29.960
 you do you get to see their body

3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:31.960
 yeah and they're sitting around a table

3:34:31.960 --> 3:34:33.960
 yeah and it feel

3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:35.960
 it feels better than zoom better than

3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:37.960
 you yeah better than you'd expect for that it

3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:39.960
 is definitely

3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:41.960
 yeah I'd say it's it's quite a bit

3:34:41.960 --> 3:34:43.960
 better than zoom when everything's working right

3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:45.960
 but there's still all the rough edges

3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:47.960
 of the reason zoom became so successful

3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:49.960
 is because they just nailed the usability

3:34:49.960 --> 3:34:51.960
 of everything it's high quality

3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:53.960
 with a absolutely first rate

3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:55.960
 experience and we are not

3:34:55.960 --> 3:34:57.960
 there yet with any of the VR stuff

3:34:57.960 --> 3:34:59.960
 I'm trying to to push hard

3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:01.960
 to get I keep talking

3:35:01.960 --> 3:35:03.960
 about it's like it needs to just be one click

3:35:03.960 --> 3:35:05.960
 to make everything happen and we're getting there

3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:07.960
 in our our home environment not

3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:09.960
 the whole work rooms application but the main home

3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:11.960
 where you can now kind of go over and click

3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:13.960
 and invite and still winds up taking

3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:15.960
 five times longer than it should

3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:17.960
 but we're getting close to that

3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:19.960
 where you click there they click

3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:21.960
 on their button and then they're sitting there

3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:23.960
 in this good presence with you

3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:25.960
 but latencies need to get a lot better

3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:27.960
 user interface needs to get a lot better

3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:29.960
 I'm ubiquity of the headsets

3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:31.960
 needs to get better we need to have

3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:33.960
 a hundred million of them out there

3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:35.960
 just so that everybody knows somebody that uses

3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:37.960
 this all the time well I think it's a

3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:39.960
 virtuous cycle because I do think

3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:41.960
 the

3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:43.960
 interface

3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:45.960
 is the thing that makes or breaks

3:35:45.960 --> 3:35:47.960
 this kind of revolution

3:35:47.960 --> 3:35:49.960
 it's so interesting how like

3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:51.960
 you said one click but it's also like how you

3:35:51.960 --> 3:35:53.960
 achieve that one click

3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:55.960
 I don't know what is a

3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:57.960
 can I ask a dark

3:35:57.960 --> 3:35:59.960
 question maybe let's keep it outside of meta

3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:01.960
 but

3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:03.960
 this is about meta but also Google and

3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:05.960
 big company are they

3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:07.960
 able to do this kind of thing

3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:09.960
 it seems like let me put

3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:11.960
 on my cranky old man head

3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:13.960
 is they seem to

3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:15.960
 not do a good job of

3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:17.960
 creating

3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:19.960
 these user friendly interfaces

3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:21.960
 as they get bigger and bigger as a company

3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:23.960
 like Google has created

3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:25.960
 some of the greatest interfaces ever

3:36:25.960 --> 3:36:27.960
 early on and it's

3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:29.960
 I mean creating Gmail

3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:31.960
 just so many brilliant

3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:33.960
 interfaces

3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:35.960
 and she seems to be getting crappier

3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:37.960
 and crappier at that same with

3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:39.960
 meta same with

3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:41.960
 Microsoft

3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:43.960
 it's just it seems to get worse

3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:45.960
 and worse at that is this I don't know what is

3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:47.960
 it because you become more conservative

3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:49.960
 careful risk averse

3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:51.960
 is that why can you speak to that

3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:53.960
 and really eye opening to me working inside

3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:55.960
 a tech Titan where

3:36:55.960 --> 3:36:57.960
 I am you know I

3:36:57.960 --> 3:36:59.960
 had my small companies and then we're

3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:01.960
 acquired by a you know a midsize

3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:03.960
 game publisher and then

3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:05.960
 Oculus getting acquired by

3:37:05.960 --> 3:37:07.960
 meta and meta has grown by a factor

3:37:07.960 --> 3:37:09.960
 of many just in the

3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:11.960
 the eight years since the acquisition

3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:13.960
 so I did

3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:15.960
 not have experience with this

3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:17.960
 and it's it was interesting

3:37:17.960 --> 3:37:19.960
 because I remember like previously my benchmark

3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:21.960
 for kind of use

3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:23.960
 of resources was some of the government programs

3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:25.960
 I interacted with on the aerospace

3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:27.960
 side and I remember thinking

3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:29.960
 there was okay there's an Air Force

3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:31.960
 program and they spent 50 million dollars

3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:33.960
 and they didn't they didn't

3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:35.960
 launch anything they didn't even build anything

3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:37.960
 it was just kind of like they I you know

3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:39.960
 they made a bunch of papers and had some parts

3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:41.960
 in a warehouse and nothing came

3:37:41.960 --> 3:37:43.960
 of it's like 50 million dollars

3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:45.960
 I am and I have

3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:47.960
 I've had to radically recalibrate my

3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:49.960
 sense of like how much money can

3:37:49.960 --> 3:37:51.960
 be spent with without a product

3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:53.960
 of the resources where

3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:55.960
 on the very the plus

3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:57.960
 side VR has turned out

3:37:57.960 --> 3:37:59.960
 we've built pretty much

3:37:59.960 --> 3:38:01.960
 exactly what

3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:03.960
 you know we just passed the 10 year mark then

3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:05.960
 from my I like my first demo

3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:07.960
 of the Rift and if I

3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:09.960
 could have said what I wanted to have it would

3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:11.960
 have been a standalone inside

3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:13.960
 out tracked 4k resolution

3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:15.960
 headset that I

3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:17.960
 that could still plug into a PC for high end

3:38:17.960 --> 3:38:19.960
 rendering and that's exactly what we've got

3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:21.960
 on Quest 2 first of all let's

3:38:21.960 --> 3:38:23.960
 pause on that with me being cranky

3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:25.960
 and everything it's what

3:38:25.960 --> 3:38:27.960
 meta achieved with

3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:29.960
 Oculus and so on is incredible

3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:31.960
 I mean this is this

3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:33.960
 what when I thought about the future of

3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:35.960
 VR is what I imagine in terms of hardware

3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:37.960
 I would say and maybe in terms

3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:39.960
 of the experience as well but

3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:41.960
 it's still not there somehow

3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:43.960
 on the one hand we did kind of

3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:45.960
 achieve it and win and we've got we've sold

3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:47.960
 you know we're a success right now

3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:49.960
 but the amount of resources

3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:51.960
 that have gone into it it winds up getting

3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:53.960
 clotted up into counting where last

3:38:53.960 --> 3:38:55.960
 mark did announce that

3:38:55.960 --> 3:38:57.960
 they spent ten billion dollars a year

3:38:57.960 --> 3:38:59.960
 like on reality labs now reality

3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:01.960
 labs covers a lot it was

3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:03.960
 VR was not the large part

3:39:03.960 --> 3:39:05.960
 of it also had portal and spark and the

3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:07.960
 big AR research efforts

3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:09.960
 and it's been expanding out

3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:11.960
 to include AI and other things there

3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:13.960
 where I there's

3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:15.960
 a lot going on there but

3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:17.960
 ten billion dollars was just a number

3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:19.960
 that I had trouble processing

3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:21.960
 it's just I feel sick to my

3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:23.960
 stomach thinking about that much money

3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:25.960
 being spent but that's how

3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:27.960
 they demonstrate commitment to this

3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:29.960
 where it's not

3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:31.960
 more so than like yeah Google goes

3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:33.960
 and cancels all of these projects

3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:35.960
 different things I like that

3:39:35.960 --> 3:39:37.960
 while meta is really sticking with

3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:39.960
 the funding of VR and

3:39:39.960 --> 3:39:41.960
 AR is still further out with it so

3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:43.960
 there's something to be said for that

3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:45.960
 it's not just going to vanish

3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:47.960
 the works going in I just wish it could

3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:49.960
 be all those resources could be

3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:51.960
 applied more effectively

3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:53.960
 because I see all these cases I point

3:39:53.960 --> 3:39:55.960
 out these examples of how

3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:57.960
 a third party that we're kind of competing

3:39:57.960 --> 3:39:59.960
 with in various ways a number of these examples

3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:01.960
 and they do work

3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:03.960
 with a tenth of the people

3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:05.960
 that we do internally

3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:07.960
 and a lot of it comes from yes there's

3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:09.960
 the small company can just go do it

3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:11.960
 while in a big company you do have

3:40:11.960 --> 3:40:13.960
 to worry about I

3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:15.960
 is there some SDK internally that you

3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:17.960
 should be using because another team is making

3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:19.960
 it you have to have your cross functional

3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:21.960
 group meetups for different things

3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:23.960
 you do have more concerns about

3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:25.960
 you know about privacy or diversity

3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:27.960
 and equity and I'm safety

3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:29.960
 of different things parental issues

3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:31.960
 and things that a small start up company

3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:33.960
 can just kind of you know Cowboy

3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:35.960
 often do something interesting

3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:37.960
 and there's a lot more

3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:39.960
 that is a problem that you have to

3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:41.960
 pay attention to in the big companies but I'm not

3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:43.960
 willing to believe that we are within

3:40:43.960 --> 3:40:45.960
 even a factor of two

3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:47.960
 or four of what the efficiency could be

3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:49.960
 you know I am constantly

3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:51.960
 kind of crying out for it's like

3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:53.960
 we can do better than this

3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:55.960
 and you wonder what the mechanisms to

3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:57.960
 unlock that efficiency are

3:40:57.960 --> 3:40:59.960
 you know I don't

3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:01.960
 there is some sense in a large company

3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:03.960
 that

3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:05.960
 like an individual engineer might not believe

3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:07.960
 that they can change the world maybe

3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:09.960
 you delegate a little bit of the

3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:11.960
 responsibility to be the one

3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:13.960
 who changes the world in a big company

3:41:13.960 --> 3:41:15.960
 I think but the reality is

3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:17.960
 like the world

3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:19.960
 will get changed by a single

3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:21.960
 engineer anyway so if

3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:23.960
 whether inside Google or inside a start

3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:25.960
 up it doesn't matter it's just like Google

3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:27.960
 and Meta needs to

3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:29.960
 help those engineers believe they're the ones

3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:31.960
 that are going to decrease that latency

3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:33.960
 is it'll take one John Carmack

3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:35.960
 like the 20 year old

3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:37.960
 Carmack that's

3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:39.960
 inside meta right now to change everything

3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:41.960
 and I try to

3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:43.960
 point that out and push people it's like

3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:45.960
 try to go ahead and when you see

3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:47.960
 some because there is you get the silo

3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:49.960
 mentality where you're like okay I know

3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:51.960
 something's not right over there but that's

3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:53.960
 I'm staying in my lane here

3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:55.960
 and there's a couple people that I can

3:41:55.960 --> 3:41:57.960
 you know I can think about that are willing

3:41:57.960 --> 3:41:59.960
 to just like hop all over the place

3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:01.960
 and man I treasure them the people that are

3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:03.960
 just willing to they're fearless

3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:05.960
 you know they will go over and they will go

3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:07.960
 rebuild the kernel and change this distribution

3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:09.960
 go in and hack a firmware over here

3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:11.960
 to to get something done right

3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:13.960
 and that is relatively rare

3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:15.960
 you know there's thousands of developers

3:42:15.960 --> 3:42:17.960
 and you've got a small handful that are willing

3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:19.960
 to operate at that level

3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:21.960
 and you know and it's potentially risky

3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:23.960
 for them the the politics are

3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:25.960
 you know are real in a lot of that and I'm in the

3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:27.960
 you know very much the privileged position

3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:29.960
 of I am you know I'm

3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:31.960
 more or less untouchable there where

3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:33.960
 I've been dinged like twice for it's like

3:42:33.960 --> 3:42:35.960
 you said something insensitive in that post

3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:37.960
 and you should probably not say that

3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:39.960
 I am but for the most part

3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.960
 yes I you know I get away with

3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:43.960
 I every week I'm posting something

3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:45.960
 you know pretty loud and opinionated

3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:47.960
 in you know internally and

3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:49.960
 I think that's useful for the company

3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:51.960
 but I am

3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:53.960
 yeah it's not it's rare to have a

3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:55.960
 position like that and I can't necessarily

3:42:55.960 --> 3:42:57.960
 offer advice for how someone

3:42:57.960 --> 3:42:59.960
 can do that I well you could

3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:01.960
 offer advice to a company in general to

3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:03.960
 give a little bit of freedom

3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:05.960
 for the young wild

3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:07.960
 like the wildest ideas come from

3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:09.960
 the young minds

3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:11.960
 and so you need to give

3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:13.960
 the young minds freedom to think

3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:15.960
 big and wild and and crazy

3:43:15.960 --> 3:43:17.960
 and for that they have to be opinionated

3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:19.960
 they have to be

3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:21.960
 they have to think

3:43:21.960 --> 3:43:23.960
 crazy ideas and thoughts

3:43:23.960 --> 3:43:25.960
 and pursue them with a full

3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:27.960
 passion without being slowed down by bureaucracy

3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:29.960
 or managers and all that kind of stuff

3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:31.960
 obviously startups

3:43:31.960 --> 3:43:33.960
 really empower that but big companies

3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:35.960
 could too and that's that's a design

3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:37.960
 challenge for company for big companies

3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:39.960
 to see how can you enable

3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:41.960
 that how can you come there are

3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:43.960
 so many resources there and

3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:45.960
 they do you know amazing things do get

3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:47.960
 accomplished but there's so much

3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:49.960
 more that could come out of that and

3:43:49.960 --> 3:43:51.960
 you know I'm hope I'm always hopeful I'm

3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:53.960
 an optimist in almost everything you know I think

3:43:53.960 --> 3:43:55.960
 things can get better I think that they

3:43:55.960 --> 3:43:57.960
 can improve things that you go

3:43:57.960 --> 3:43:59.960
 through a path and you're learning

3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:01.960
 how does and doesn't work and I'm not

3:44:01.960 --> 3:44:03.960
 I'm not ready to be fatalistic about

3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:05.960
 the kind of the outcome of any of that

3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:07.960
 me neither I know too

3:44:07.960 --> 3:44:09.960
 many good people inside of those large

3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:11.960
 companies that are incredible

3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:13.960
 you have a friendship

3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:15.960
 with Elon Musk

3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:17.960
 often when I talk to him he'll bring up

3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.960
 how incredible of an engineer and just

3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:21.960
 a big picture thinker you are

3:44:21.960 --> 3:44:23.960
 his huge amount of respect

3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:25.960
 for you

3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:27.960
 I just I've never been

3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:29.960
 a fly in the wall between a discussion between

3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:31.960
 the two of you I just wonder is there something

3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:33.960
 you guys

3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:35.960
 debate argue about

3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:37.960
 discuss is there some interesting problems

3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:39.960
 that the two of you

3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:41.960
 think about you come from different

3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:43.960
 worlds maybe there's some intersection

3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:45.960
 and then in aerospace maybe

3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:47.960
 there's some intersection

3:44:47.960 --> 3:44:49.960
 in your new efforts

3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:51.960
 in artificial intelligence

3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:53.960
 in terms of thinking is there something

3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:55.960
 interesting you could say about sort of the

3:44:55.960 --> 3:44:57.960
 things that you need to base the two of you have

3:44:57.960 --> 3:44:59.960
 so I think in some ways

3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:01.960
 we do have a kind of similar background

3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:03.960
 where we're almost exactly the same age

3:45:03.960 --> 3:45:05.960
 and we had kind of similar

3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:07.960
 programming backgrounds on the personal

3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:09.960
 computers and you know even some of the

3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:11.960
 books that we would read and things that

3:45:11.960 --> 3:45:13.960
 would kind of turn us into the people that

3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:15.960
 we are today and

3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:17.960
 I think there is a degree of

3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:19.960
 sensibility similarities

3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:21.960
 where you know we kind of call

3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:23.960
 bullshit on the same things and kind of see

3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:25.960
 opportunities

3:45:25.960 --> 3:45:27.960
 in different technology and there's that

3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:29.960
 sense of you know I always talk about the

3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:31.960
 speed of light solutions for things and he's

3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:33.960
 thinking about kind of

3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:35.960
 minimum manufacturing and engineering and

3:45:35.960 --> 3:45:37.960
 operational standpoints for

3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:39.960
 things and

3:45:39.960 --> 3:45:41.960
 so I mean I first met Elon

3:45:41.960 --> 3:45:43.960
 right at the start of the aerospace era

3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:45.960
 where I wasn't familiar with

3:45:45.960 --> 3:45:47.960
 you know I was still in my game dev bubble

3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:49.960
 I really wasn't familiar with all the startups

3:45:49.960 --> 3:45:51.960
 that were going and being successful

3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:53.960
 and what went on with PayPal and all of his

3:45:53.960 --> 3:45:55.960
 different companies but you know I met

3:45:55.960 --> 3:45:57.960
 him as I was starting to do Armadillo

3:45:57.960 --> 3:45:59.960
 Aerospace and you know he

3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:01.960
 came down with kind of his right hand

3:46:01.960 --> 3:46:03.960
 propulsion guy and we

3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:05.960
 talked about rockets you know what can we

3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:07.960
 what can we do with this and it was kind

3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:09.960
 of specific things about like

3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:11.960
 how are our flight computers set up

3:46:11.960 --> 3:46:13.960
 what are different propellant options

3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:15.960
 you know what can happen with

3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:17.960
 different ways of putting

3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:19.960
 things together and then

3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:21.960
 in some ways he was certainly the

3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:23.960
 biggest player in the sort of

3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:25.960
 space community that was going on in the

3:46:25.960 --> 3:46:27.960
 early 2000s

3:46:27.960 --> 3:46:29.960
 he was the most

3:46:29.960 --> 3:46:31.960
 well funded although you know his funding

3:46:31.960 --> 3:46:33.960
 in the larger scheme of things compared to

3:46:33.960 --> 3:46:35.960
 a like a NASA or something

3:46:35.960 --> 3:46:37.960
 like that was really tiny

3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:39.960
 it was a lot more than I had at the time

3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:41.960
 I but

3:46:41.960 --> 3:46:43.960
 it was interesting I had a point years later

3:46:43.960 --> 3:46:45.960
 when I realized okay

3:46:45.960 --> 3:46:47.960
 my like my financial resources

3:46:47.960 --> 3:46:49.960
 at this point are basically what

3:46:49.960 --> 3:46:51.960
 Elon's was when he went all in

3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:53.960
 on SpaceX and Tesla

3:46:53.960 --> 3:46:55.960
 and there's

3:46:55.960 --> 3:46:57.960
 I think in many

3:46:57.960 --> 3:46:59.960
 corners he does not get

3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:01.960
 the respect that he should about being

3:47:01.960 --> 3:47:03.960
 a wealthy person that could

3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:05.960
 just retire and he went

3:47:05.960 --> 3:47:07.960
 all in where he was really

3:47:07.960 --> 3:47:09.960
 going to you know

3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:11.960
 he could have gone bust and there's

3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:13.960
 plenty of people you look at the you know

3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:15.960
 the sad athletes

3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:17.960
 or entertainers that had all the money

3:47:17.960 --> 3:47:19.960
 in the world and blew it he could have been

3:47:19.960 --> 3:47:21.960
 the business case example of that

3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:23.960
 but I

3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:25.960
 you know the things that he was doing space

3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:27.960
 exploration electrification of

3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:29.960
 transportation

3:47:29.960 --> 3:47:31.960
 solar city type things

3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:33.960
 these are big world level

3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:35.960
 things and I have a great deal

3:47:35.960 --> 3:47:37.960
 of admiration that he was willing

3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:39.960
 to throw himself so completely

3:47:39.960 --> 3:47:41.960
 into that because

3:47:41.960 --> 3:47:43.960
 in contrast with myself I was doing

3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:45.960
 armadillo aerospace with this tightly

3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:47.960
 bounded it was John's

3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:49.960
 crazy money at the time

3:47:49.960 --> 3:47:51.960
 that had a finite limit on it it was

3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:53.960
 never going to impact me or my family

3:47:53.960 --> 3:47:55.960
 if it completely

3:47:55.960 --> 3:47:57.960
 failed and I was still hedging

3:47:57.960 --> 3:47:59.960
 my bets working at in software

3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:01.960
 at the time when he had been

3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:03.960
 you know really all in

3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:05.960
 there and

3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:07.960
 I have a huge amount of respect for that

3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:09.960
 and people do not the other thing I get

3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:11.960
 irritated with is people would say it's like

3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:13.960
 Elon's just a business guy

3:48:13.960 --> 3:48:15.960
 he just got like he was gifted

3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:17.960
 the money and he's just kind of

3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:19.960
 investing in all of this when

3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:21.960
 he was really deeply involved

3:48:21.960 --> 3:48:23.960
 in a lot of the decisions

3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:25.960
 not all of them were perfect but

3:48:25.960 --> 3:48:27.960
 he cared very much

3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:29.960
 about engine material selection

3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:31.960
 propellant selection

3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:33.960
 and for years he'd be kind of telling

3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:35.960
 me it's like get off that hydrogen

3:48:35.960 --> 3:48:37.960
 peroxide stuff it's like

3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:39.960
 liquid oxygen is the only proper

3:48:39.960 --> 3:48:41.960
 oxidizer for this

3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:43.960
 and

3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:45.960
 the times that I've gone through the factories

3:48:45.960 --> 3:48:47.960
 with him we're talking

3:48:47.960 --> 3:48:49.960
 very detailed things about

3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:51.960
 like how this weld is made

3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:53.960
 how this sub assembly goes together

3:48:53.960 --> 3:48:55.960
 what are like start

3:48:55.960 --> 3:48:57.960
 up shut down behaviors of the different

3:48:57.960 --> 3:48:59.960
 things so he is

3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:01.960
 really in there

3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:03.960
 at a very detailed level and I think

3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:05.960
 that he is the best modern

3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:07.960
 example now of someone that

3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:09.960
 tries to that can effectively

3:49:09.960 --> 3:49:11.960
 micromanage some decisions on things

3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:13.960
 on both Tesla and

3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:15.960
 SpaceX to some degree where

3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:17.960
 he cares enough about it I worry a lot

3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:19.960
 that he stretched too thin that

3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:21.960
 you get boring company in Neuralink

3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:23.960
 and Twitter and all the other possible

3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:25.960
 things there where I know

3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:27.960
 I've got

3:49:27.960 --> 3:49:29.960
 limits on how much I can pay attention

3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:31.960
 to that I have to kind of box

3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:33.960
 off different amounts of time

3:49:33.960 --> 3:49:35.960
 and I look back at like at my aerospace

3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:37.960
 side of things it's like I did not

3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:39.960
 go all in on that I did not

3:49:39.960 --> 3:49:41.960
 commit myself at a level that it would

3:49:41.960 --> 3:49:43.960
 have taken to be successful there

3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:45.960
 and I

3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:47.960
 and it's kind of a weird thing just

3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:49.960
 like having a discussion with

3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:51.960
 the richest man in the world right now

3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:53.960
 he operates on

3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:55.960
 you know on a level that is still

3:49:55.960 --> 3:49:57.960
 very much in my

3:49:57.960 --> 3:49:59.960
 wheelhouse on a technical side of things

3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:01.960
 so doing that systems level type of

3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:03.960
 thinking we can go to the

3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:05.960
 level of details and go up high to the

3:50:05.960 --> 3:50:07.960
 big picture do you think

3:50:07.960 --> 3:50:09.960
 in the aerospace

3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:11.960
 arena

3:50:11.960 --> 3:50:13.960
 in the next 5, 10

3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:15.960
 years do you think we're going to put a human

3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:17.960
 on Mars like what do you think is the

3:50:17.960 --> 3:50:19.960
 interesting

3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:21.960
 no I do in fact I made

3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:23.960
 a bet with someone with a group of people

3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:25.960
 kind of this about whether

3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:27.960
 boots on Mars by 2030

3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:29.960
 and this was kind of a fun

3:50:29.960 --> 3:50:31.960
 fun story because I was

3:50:31.960 --> 3:50:33.960
 at an Intel sponsored event

3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:35.960
 and we had a bunch of just

3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:37.960
 world class brilliant people and we were

3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:39.960
 talking about computing stuff but the after dinner

3:50:39.960 --> 3:50:41.960
 conversation was like what are some other

3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:43.960
 things how they're going to go in the future

3:50:43.960 --> 3:50:45.960
 and one of the ones tossed up on the white board

3:50:45.960 --> 3:50:47.960
 was like boots on Mars by 2030

3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:49.960
 and most of the

3:50:49.960 --> 3:50:51.960
 people in the room thought yes

3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:53.960
 you know I thought that like SpaceX is kicking

3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:55.960
 ass we've got all this possible stuff

3:50:55.960 --> 3:50:57.960
 I seems likely that it's

3:50:57.960 --> 3:50:59.960
 going to go that way and

3:50:59.960 --> 3:51:01.960
 I said no I think

3:51:01.960 --> 3:51:03.960
 less than 50% chance that it's going to make

3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:05.960
 it there

3:51:05.960 --> 3:51:07.960
 and people you know were kind of like oh

3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:09.960
 why the pessimism or whatever and of course

3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:11.960
 I'm an optimist at almost everything

3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:13.960
 but for me to be the one kind

3:51:13.960 --> 3:51:15.960
 of outlier saying no I don't think so

3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:17.960
 then I started

3:51:17.960 --> 3:51:19.960
 saying some of the things I said well let's

3:51:19.960 --> 3:51:21.960
 be concrete about it let's bet

3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:23.960
 $10,000 that it's not going to happen

3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:25.960
 and this was

3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:27.960
 this was really a startling

3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:29.960
 thing to see that I again

3:51:29.960 --> 3:51:31.960
 room full of brilliant people but as

3:51:31.960 --> 3:51:33.960
 soon as like money came on the line

3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:35.960
 and they were like do I want to put

3:51:35.960 --> 3:51:37.960
 $10,000 and I was not the richest person

3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:39.960
 in the room there are people much better

3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:41.960
 off than there's a spectrum

3:51:41.960 --> 3:51:43.960
 but

3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:45.960
 you know as soon as they started think it's like oh I could

3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:47.960
 lose money by

3:51:47.960 --> 3:51:49.960
 keeping my position right

3:51:49.960 --> 3:51:51.960
 now and all these

3:51:51.960 --> 3:51:53.960
 engineers they engage their brain they started thinking

3:51:53.960 --> 3:51:55.960
 it's like okay launch windows

3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:57.960
 launch delays

3:51:57.960 --> 3:51:59.960
 like how many times would it take to get this

3:51:59.960 --> 3:52:01.960
 right what historical precedence do we have

3:52:01.960 --> 3:52:03.960
 and I

3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:05.960
 and then it mostly came down to it's like well

3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:07.960
 what about in transit by 2030

3:52:07.960 --> 3:52:09.960
 and then I if you know what about

3:52:09.960 --> 3:52:11.960
 I you know different things or would you

3:52:11.960 --> 3:52:13.960
 hand would you go for 2032

3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:15.960
 but one of the people did go ahead

3:52:15.960 --> 3:52:17.960
 and was optimistic enough to make a bet

3:52:17.960 --> 3:52:19.960
 with me so I have a $10,000

3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:21.960
 bet that by 2030

3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:23.960
 I think it's going to happen shortly thereafter

3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:25.960
 I think there will probably be infrastructure

3:52:25.960 --> 3:52:27.960
 on Mars by 2030

3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:29.960
 but I don't think that we'll have humans

3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:31.960
 on Mars on 23rd I think it's possible

3:52:31.960 --> 3:52:33.960
 but I think it's less than a 50% chance

3:52:33.960 --> 3:52:35.960
 so I felt safe making that bet

3:52:35.960 --> 3:52:37.960
 well I think

3:52:37.960 --> 3:52:39.960
 you had an interesting point

3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:41.960
 correct me if I'm wrong that's a dark one

3:52:41.960 --> 3:52:43.960
 that's um

3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:45.960
 that should perhaps

3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:47.960
 help people appreciate Elon Musk

3:52:47.960 --> 3:52:49.960
 which is

3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:51.960
 in this particular

3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:53.960
 effort

3:52:53.960 --> 3:52:55.960
 Elon is critical

3:52:55.960 --> 3:52:57.960
 to the success

3:52:57.960 --> 3:52:59.960
 SpaceX seems to be

3:52:59.960 --> 3:53:01.960
 critical to the

3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:03.960
 20th

3:53:03.960 --> 3:53:05.960
 humans on Mars by 2030

3:53:05.960 --> 3:53:07.960
 or thereabouts

3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:09.960
 so if something happens to Elon

3:53:09.960 --> 3:53:11.960
 then all of this

3:53:11.960 --> 3:53:13.960
 collapses

3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:15.960
 and this is in contrast to the other

3:53:15.960 --> 3:53:17.960
 $10,000 bet I made

3:53:17.960 --> 3:53:19.960
 kind of recently and that was

3:53:19.960 --> 3:53:21.960
 driving cars at like a level 5

3:53:21.960 --> 3:53:23.960
 running around cities

3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:25.960
 and people have kind of nitpicked that

3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:27.960
 that we probably don't mean exactly level 5

3:53:27.960 --> 3:53:29.960
 but the guy I'm having the bet with

3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:31.960
 is we're going to be

3:53:31.960 --> 3:53:33.960
 we know what we mean about this

3:53:33.960 --> 3:53:35.960
 yeah, coding horror

3:53:35.960 --> 3:53:37.960
 but I

3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:39.960
 yeah I mean it's just

3:53:39.960 --> 3:53:41.960
 he doesn't think that people are going to be riding around

3:53:41.960 --> 3:53:43.960
 in robo taxis in 2030

3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:45.960
 in major cities just

3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:47.960
 like you take an Uber now

3:53:47.960 --> 3:53:49.960
 you think it will

3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:51.960
 and the difference is everybody looks at this

3:53:51.960 --> 3:53:53.960
 it's like oh but Tesla's been wrong

3:53:53.960 --> 3:53:55.960
 they've been promising it for years

3:53:55.960 --> 3:53:57.960
 and it's not here yet

3:53:57.960 --> 3:53:59.960
 and the reason this is different

3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:01.960
 than the bet with Mars

3:54:01.960 --> 3:54:03.960
 is Mars really is

3:54:03.960 --> 3:54:05.960
 more than is comfortable a bet on

3:54:05.960 --> 3:54:07.960
 Elon Musk

3:54:07.960 --> 3:54:09.960
 that is his thing

3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:11.960
 and he is really going to move heaven and earth

3:54:11.960 --> 3:54:13.960
 to try to make that happen

3:54:13.960 --> 3:54:15.960
 and perhaps not even SpaceX

3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:17.960
 just Elon Musk

3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:19.960
 yeah because if Elon went away

3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:21.960
 and SpaceX went public

3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:23.960
 and got a board of directors

3:54:23.960 --> 3:54:25.960
 there are more profitable things they could be doing

3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:27.960
 than focusing on human

3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:29.960
 presence on Mars

3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:31.960
 so this really is a sort of personal thing there

3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:33.960
 and in

3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:35.960
 contrast with that self driving cars

3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:37.960
 have a dozen credible

3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:39.960
 companies working really hard

3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:41.960
 and while

3:54:41.960 --> 3:54:43.960
 yes it's going slower than most people

3:54:43.960 --> 3:54:45.960
 thought it would

3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:47.960
 betting against that is a bet against almost

3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:49.960
 the entire world in terms of

3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:51.960
 all of these companies that have all of these

3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:53.960
 incentives it's not just

3:54:53.960 --> 3:54:55.960
 you know one guy's passion project

3:54:55.960 --> 3:54:57.960
 I

3:54:57.960 --> 3:54:59.960
 and I do think that it is solvable

3:54:59.960 --> 3:55:01.960
 although there's I recognize it's not a hundred percent chance

3:55:01.960 --> 3:55:03.960
 because it's possible

3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:05.960
 the long tail of self driving problems winds up

3:55:05.960 --> 3:55:07.960
 being an AGI complete problem

3:55:07.960 --> 3:55:09.960
 I think there's plenty of value to

3:55:09.960 --> 3:55:11.960
 mine out of it with narrow AI

3:55:11.960 --> 3:55:13.960
 and I think that it's you know it's going to happen

3:55:13.960 --> 3:55:15.960
 probably more so than people expect

3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:17.960
 but it's that whole sigmoid

3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:19.960
 curve where you over you know

3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:21.960
 you overestimate the near term progress

3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:23.960
 you underestimate the long term progress

3:55:23.960 --> 3:55:25.960
 and I think self driving is going to be like

3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:27.960
 that and I think 2030 still

3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:29.960
 a pretty good bet

3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:31.960
 yeah unfortunately

3:55:31.960 --> 3:55:33.960
 self driving

3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:35.960
 is a problem that

3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:37.960
 is safety critical

3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:39.960
 meaning that

3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:41.960
 if you don't do it well

3:55:41.960 --> 3:55:43.960
 people get hurt

3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:45.960
 but the other side of that is people are terrible drivers

3:55:45.960 --> 3:55:47.960
 so it is not going to be

3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:49.960
 that's probably going to be the argument that gets it through

3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:51.960
 is like we can save

3:55:51.960 --> 3:55:53.960
 10,000 lives a year

3:55:53.960 --> 3:55:55.960
 by taking imperfect self driving

3:55:55.960 --> 3:55:57.960
 cars and letting them take over a lot

3:55:57.960 --> 3:55:59.960
 of driving responsibilities

3:55:59.960 --> 3:56:01.960
 it's like was it 30,000 people a year

3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:03.960
 die in auto accidents right now in America

3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:05.960
 and a lot of those are

3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:07.960
 preventable and the problem is you'll have

3:56:07.960 --> 3:56:09.960
 people that every time a Tesla

3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:11.960
 crashes into something you've got a bunch of people

3:56:11.960 --> 3:56:13.960
 that literally have vested interest

3:56:13.960 --> 3:56:15.960
 shorting Tesla to come out and make it the

3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:17.960
 worst thing in the world and people

3:56:17.960 --> 3:56:19.960
 will be fighting against that but

3:56:19.960 --> 3:56:21.960
 optimist in me again I think that

3:56:21.960 --> 3:56:23.960
 we will have systems that are statistically

3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:25.960
 safer than human drivers

3:56:25.960 --> 3:56:27.960
 and we will be saving

3:56:27.960 --> 3:56:29.960
 thousands and thousands of lives

3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:31.960
 every year when we can hand over

3:56:31.960 --> 3:56:33.960
 more of those responsibilities to it

3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:35.960
 I do still think as a person

3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:37.960
 who studied this problem very deeply

3:56:37.960 --> 3:56:39.960
 from a human side as well

3:56:39.960 --> 3:56:41.960
 it's still an open problem

3:56:41.960 --> 3:56:43.960
 how good slash bad

3:56:43.960 --> 3:56:45.960
 humans are driving

3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:47.960
 it's a kind of funny

3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:49.960
 thing we say about each other oh humans

3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:51.960
 suck at driving

3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:53.960
 everybody except you

3:56:53.960 --> 3:56:55.960
 of course like we think we're good at driving

3:56:55.960 --> 3:56:57.960
 but I

3:56:57.960 --> 3:56:59.960
 after really studying it

3:56:59.960 --> 3:57:01.960
 I think you start to notice

3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:03.960
 you know because I watched

3:57:03.960 --> 3:57:05.960
 hundreds of hours of humans

3:57:05.960 --> 3:57:07.960
 driving the projects of this kind of

3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:09.960
 thing you've noticed that

3:57:09.960 --> 3:57:11.960
 even with the distraction

3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:13.960
 even with everything else humans are

3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:15.960
 able to do

3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:17.960
 some incredible things

3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:19.960
 with the attention even when you're

3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:21.960
 just looking at the smartphone just to get

3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:23.960
 cues from the environment to make

3:57:23.960 --> 3:57:25.960
 less seconds decisions

3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:27.960
 to use instinctual

3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:29.960
 type of decisions that actually save

3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:31.960
 your ass time and time and time again

3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:33.960
 and

3:57:33.960 --> 3:57:35.960
 are able to do that

3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:37.960
 with so much uncertainty around you

3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:39.960
 in such tricky dynamic environments

3:57:39.960 --> 3:57:41.960
 I don't know

3:57:41.960 --> 3:57:43.960
 I don't know exactly

3:57:43.960 --> 3:57:45.960
 how hard is it

3:57:45.960 --> 3:57:47.960
 to beat that kind of

3:57:47.960 --> 3:57:49.960
 skill of common sense reasoning

3:57:49.960 --> 3:57:51.960
 so this is one of those interesting

3:57:51.960 --> 3:57:53.960
 things that there have been a lot of studies about

3:57:53.960 --> 3:57:55.960
 how experts in their field

3:57:55.960 --> 3:57:57.960
 usually underestimate the

3:57:57.960 --> 3:57:59.960
 progress that's going to happen

3:57:59.960 --> 3:58:01.960
 because an expert thinks about all the

3:58:01.960 --> 3:58:03.960
 problems they deal with and they're like

3:58:03.960 --> 3:58:05.960
 damn I'm going to have a hard time solving

3:58:05.960 --> 3:58:07.960
 all of this and they filter out the fact

3:58:07.960 --> 3:58:09.960
 that they are one expert in a field of

3:58:09.960 --> 3:58:11.960
 thousands and you know

3:58:11.960 --> 3:58:13.960
 you think about yeah I can't do all of that

3:58:13.960 --> 3:58:15.960
 and you sometimes forget about the scope of

3:58:15.960 --> 3:58:17.960
 the ecosystem that you're embedded in

3:58:17.960 --> 3:58:19.960
 and if you think back eight years

3:58:19.960 --> 3:58:21.960
 very specifically the state of AI

3:58:21.960 --> 3:58:23.960
 and machine learning where

3:58:23.960 --> 3:58:25.960
 we had just gotten resnets probably

3:58:25.960 --> 3:58:27.960
 at that point and you look at all

3:58:27.960 --> 3:58:29.960
 of the amazing magical things

3:58:29.960 --> 3:58:31.960
 that have happened in eight years

3:58:31.960 --> 3:58:33.960
 and they do kind of seem to be happening

3:58:33.960 --> 3:58:35.960
 a little faster in recent years also

3:58:35.960 --> 3:58:37.960
 and you project that eight more years

3:58:37.960 --> 3:58:39.960
 into the future where again

3:58:39.960 --> 3:58:41.960
 I think there's a 50% chance we're going to

3:58:41.960 --> 3:58:43.960
 have signs of life of AGI

3:58:43.960 --> 3:58:45.960
 which we can put through driver's

3:58:45.960 --> 3:58:47.960
 ed if we need to to actually build

3:58:47.960 --> 3:58:49.960
 self driving cars and I think that

3:58:49.960 --> 3:58:51.960
 the narrow systems are going to

3:58:51.960 --> 3:58:53.960
 have real value demonstrated well before

3:58:53.960 --> 3:58:55.960
 then

3:58:55.960 --> 3:58:57.960
 that there's a lot of life in AGI

3:58:57.960 --> 3:58:59.960
 you've mentioned that

3:58:59.960 --> 3:59:01.960
 okay first of all

3:59:01.960 --> 3:59:03.960
 you're one of the most

3:59:03.960 --> 3:59:05.960
 brilliant people on this earth you could be

3:59:05.960 --> 3:59:07.960
 solving a number of different

3:59:07.960 --> 3:59:09.960
 problems as you've mentioned

3:59:09.960 --> 3:59:11.960
 your mind was attracted to nuclear energy

3:59:11.960 --> 3:59:13.960
 obviously virtual reality

3:59:13.960 --> 3:59:15.960
 with the metaverse is something you could have

3:59:15.960 --> 3:59:17.960
 a tremendous impact on so I do want to say

3:59:17.960 --> 3:59:19.960
 a quick thing about nuclear energy where

3:59:19.960 --> 3:59:21.960
 I you know this is something that

3:59:21.960 --> 3:59:23.960
 I read this so

3:59:23.960 --> 3:59:25.960
 precisely feels like aerospace

3:59:25.960 --> 3:59:27.960
 before SpaceX where

3:59:27.960 --> 3:59:29.960
 from everything that I know about all of these

3:59:29.960 --> 3:59:31.960
 I am the physics of this

3:59:31.960 --> 3:59:33.960
 stuff hasn't changed and

3:59:33.960 --> 3:59:35.960
 the reasons why things are expensive

3:59:35.960 --> 3:59:37.960
 now are not fundamental

3:59:37.960 --> 3:59:39.960
 I somebody

3:59:39.960 --> 3:59:41.960
 should be going into I

3:59:41.960 --> 3:59:43.960
 really hard Elon musk

3:59:43.960 --> 3:59:45.960
 style at

3:59:45.960 --> 3:59:47.960
 vision economical vision not

3:59:47.960 --> 3:59:49.960
 fusion where the

3:59:49.960 --> 3:59:51.960
 fusion is the kind of the

3:59:51.960 --> 3:59:53.960
 darling of people that want to go and do

3:59:53.960 --> 3:59:55.960
 nuclear because it doesn't have

3:59:55.960 --> 3:59:57.960
 the taint that fission has in a lot of people's

3:59:57.960 --> 3:59:59.960
 minds but

3:59:59.960 --> 4:00:01.960
 it's an almost absurdly complex thing

4:00:01.960 --> 4:00:03.960
 where nuclear fusion

4:00:03.960 --> 4:00:05.960
 as you look at the Tokamax

4:00:05.960 --> 4:00:07.960
 or any of the things that people are building and it's

4:00:07.960 --> 4:00:09.960
 doing all of this infrastructure

4:00:09.960 --> 4:00:11.960
 just at the end of the day to make something

4:00:11.960 --> 4:00:13.960
 hot to that you can then

4:00:13.960 --> 4:00:15.960
 turn into energy through a conventional

4:00:15.960 --> 4:00:17.960
 power plant and all of that

4:00:17.960 --> 4:00:19.960
 work which we think we've got line of sight

4:00:19.960 --> 4:00:21.960
 on but even if it comes out

4:00:21.960 --> 4:00:23.960
 then you have to do all of that

4:00:23.960 --> 4:00:25.960
 immensely complex expensive stuff

4:00:25.960 --> 4:00:27.960
 just to make something hot where

4:00:27.960 --> 4:00:29.960
 nuclear fission is basically you put these two

4:00:29.960 --> 4:00:31.960
 rocks together and they get hot all

4:00:31.960 --> 4:00:33.960
 by themselves that is just

4:00:33.960 --> 4:00:35.960
 that much simpler it's just

4:00:35.960 --> 4:00:37.960
 orders of magnitude simpler

4:00:37.960 --> 4:00:39.960
 and the actual rocks the refined uranium

4:00:39.960 --> 4:00:41.960
 is not very expensive it's

4:00:41.960 --> 4:00:43.960
 a couple percent of the cost

4:00:43.960 --> 4:00:45.960
 of electricity that's why I made that point

4:00:45.960 --> 4:00:47.960
 where you could have something which was

4:00:47.960 --> 4:00:49.960
 five times less efficient

4:00:49.960 --> 4:00:51.960
 than current systems

4:00:51.960 --> 4:00:53.960
 and if the rest of the plant was a whole much cheaper

4:00:53.960 --> 4:00:55.960
 you could still be super super

4:00:55.960 --> 4:00:57.960
 valuable so how much of

4:00:57.960 --> 4:00:59.960
 the pie do you think

4:00:59.960 --> 4:01:01.960
 could be solved

4:01:01.960 --> 4:01:03.960
 by nuclear energy by fission

4:01:03.960 --> 4:01:05.960
 so how much could it

4:01:05.960 --> 4:01:07.960
 become the primary source of energy on earth

4:01:07.960 --> 4:01:09.960
 it could be most of it

4:01:09.960 --> 4:01:11.960
 like the reserves of uranium as it stands now

4:01:11.960 --> 4:01:13.960
 could not power the whole earth but

4:01:13.960 --> 4:01:15.960
 I am you know you get into breeder reactors

4:01:15.960 --> 4:01:17.960
 and thorium and things like that

4:01:17.960 --> 4:01:19.960
 that you do for conventional fission

4:01:19.960 --> 4:01:21.960
 there is enough for everything

4:01:21.960 --> 4:01:22.960
 now I mean solar

4:01:22.960 --> 4:01:24.960
 photovoltaic has been amazing

4:01:24.960 --> 4:01:26.960
 you know it's I

4:01:26.960 --> 4:01:28.960
 one of my current projects is working on an

4:01:28.960 --> 4:01:30.960
 off grid system and it's been fun just

4:01:30.960 --> 4:01:32.960
 kind of again putting my hands on all the

4:01:32.960 --> 4:01:34.960
 stripping the wires and wiring things together

4:01:34.960 --> 4:01:36.960
 and doing all of that and just having followed

4:01:36.960 --> 4:01:38.960
 that a little bit from the outside

4:01:38.960 --> 4:01:40.960
 over the last couple decades

4:01:40.960 --> 4:01:42.960
 there's been semiconductor like magical

4:01:42.960 --> 4:01:45.960
 progress in what's going on there

4:01:45.960 --> 4:01:47.960
 so I'm all for all of that

4:01:47.960 --> 4:01:49.960
 but it doesn't solve everything and nuclear

4:01:49.960 --> 4:01:51.960
 really still does seem like

4:01:51.960 --> 4:01:53.960
 the smart money bet for what you should be

4:01:53.960 --> 4:01:56.960
 getting for baseband on a lot of things

4:01:56.960 --> 4:01:58.960
 and solar may be cheaper for

4:01:58.960 --> 4:02:00.960
 you know peaking over air conditioning loads

4:02:00.960 --> 4:02:02.960
 during the the summer and things that you

4:02:02.960 --> 4:02:04.960
 can push around in different ways

4:02:04.960 --> 4:02:06.960
 but it's one of those things that's

4:02:06.960 --> 4:02:08.960
 it's just strange how

4:02:08.960 --> 4:02:10.960
 we've had the technology sitting there

4:02:10.960 --> 4:02:12.960
 but these non technical reasons on the

4:02:12.960 --> 4:02:14.960
 social optics of it has been

4:02:14.960 --> 4:02:16.960
 this major forcing function

4:02:16.960 --> 4:02:18.960
 for something that

4:02:18.960 --> 4:02:20.960
 you know really should be at the cornerstone

4:02:20.960 --> 4:02:22.960
 of all of the world's concerns

4:02:22.960 --> 4:02:24.960
 with energy it's interesting

4:02:24.960 --> 4:02:26.960
 how the non technical factors

4:02:26.960 --> 4:02:28.960
 have really dominated something that is

4:02:28.960 --> 4:02:30.960
 so fundamental to

4:02:30.960 --> 4:02:32.960
 kind of the existence of the human race as we

4:02:32.960 --> 4:02:34.960
 know it today

4:02:34.960 --> 4:02:36.960
 and much of the troubles of the world including

4:02:36.960 --> 4:02:38.960
 wars in different parts

4:02:38.960 --> 4:02:40.960
 of the world like Ukraine is energy

4:02:40.960 --> 4:02:42.960
 based and

4:02:42.960 --> 4:02:44.960
 yeah it's just sitting right there to be solved

4:02:46.960 --> 4:02:48.960
 that said

4:02:48.960 --> 4:02:50.960
 I mean to me personally I think

4:02:50.960 --> 4:02:52.960
 it's clear that if AGI would

4:02:52.960 --> 4:02:54.960
 be achieved that would change the course

4:02:54.960 --> 4:02:56.960
 of human history so AGI

4:02:56.960 --> 4:02:58.960
 wise I was

4:02:58.960 --> 4:03:00.960
 I was making this decision about what do I want

4:03:00.960 --> 4:03:02.960
 to focus on after

4:03:02.960 --> 4:03:04.960
 VR and I'm still working on VR

4:03:04.960 --> 4:03:06.960
 regularly I spend a day

4:03:06.960 --> 4:03:08.960
 a week kind of consulting with

4:03:08.960 --> 4:03:10.960
 meta and I you know

4:03:10.960 --> 4:03:12.960
 boss styles me the consulting

4:03:12.960 --> 4:03:14.960
 CTO is kind of like the Sherlock Holmes

4:03:14.960 --> 4:03:16.960
 that comes in and consults on

4:03:16.960 --> 4:03:18.960
 some of the specific tough issues

4:03:18.960 --> 4:03:20.960
 and I'm still pretty passionate about all

4:03:20.960 --> 4:03:22.960
 of that but I have been

4:03:22.960 --> 4:03:24.960
 figuring out how to compartmentalize

4:03:24.960 --> 4:03:26.960
 and force that into a smaller

4:03:26.960 --> 4:03:28.960
 box to work on some other things

4:03:28.960 --> 4:03:30.960
 and I did come down to this decision between

4:03:30.960 --> 4:03:32.960
 working on

4:03:32.960 --> 4:03:34.960
 economical nuclear fission or

4:03:34.960 --> 4:03:36.960
 artificial general intelligence

4:03:36.960 --> 4:03:38.960
 and the fission side of things

4:03:38.960 --> 4:03:40.960
 I've got a bunch of interesting things

4:03:40.960 --> 4:03:42.960
 going that way but

4:03:42.960 --> 4:03:44.960
 it would take that would be a fairly big

4:03:44.960 --> 4:03:46.960
 project thing to do I don't think

4:03:46.960 --> 4:03:48.960
 it needs to be as big as people expect

4:03:48.960 --> 4:03:50.960
 I do think something original space

4:03:50.960 --> 4:03:52.960
 excised I

4:03:52.960 --> 4:03:54.960
 you build it power your building off of it

4:03:54.960 --> 4:03:56.960
 and then the government I think will come

4:03:56.960 --> 4:03:58.960
 around to what you need to

4:03:58.960 --> 4:04:00.960
 is everybody loves an existence proof

4:04:00.960 --> 4:04:02.960
 I think it's possible somebody should be

4:04:02.960 --> 4:04:04.960
 doing this but it's going to involve

4:04:04.960 --> 4:04:06.960
 some politics it's going to involve

4:04:06.960 --> 4:04:08.960
 decent sized teams and a bunch of this

4:04:08.960 --> 4:04:10.960
 cross functional stuff that I don't love

4:04:10.960 --> 4:04:12.960
 while the artificial

4:04:12.960 --> 4:04:14.960
 general intelligence side of things

4:04:14.960 --> 4:04:16.960
 I'm

4:04:16.960 --> 4:04:18.960
 it seems to me like this is

4:04:18.960 --> 4:04:20.960
 the highest leverage

4:04:20.960 --> 4:04:22.960
 moment for potentially

4:04:22.960 --> 4:04:24.960
 a single individual potentially

4:04:24.960 --> 4:04:26.960
 in the history of the world where

4:04:26.960 --> 4:04:28.960
 the things that we know about

4:04:28.960 --> 4:04:30.960
 the brain about what we can do

4:04:30.960 --> 4:04:32.960
 with artificial intelligence

4:04:32.960 --> 4:04:34.960
 nobody can say absolutely

4:04:34.960 --> 4:04:36.960
 on any of these things but

4:04:36.960 --> 4:04:38.960
 I am not a madman

4:04:38.960 --> 4:04:40.960
 for saying that it is likely

4:04:40.960 --> 4:04:42.960
 that the code for artificial general

4:04:42.960 --> 4:04:44.960
 intelligence is going to be

4:04:44.960 --> 4:04:46.960
 tens of thousands of lines

4:04:46.960 --> 4:04:48.960
 of code not millions of lines

4:04:48.960 --> 4:04:50.960
 of code this is code that conceivably

4:04:50.960 --> 4:04:52.960
 one individual could

4:04:52.960 --> 4:04:54.960
 write unlike writing a new web browser

4:04:54.960 --> 4:04:56.960
 operating system

4:04:56.960 --> 4:04:58.960
 and based on the progress

4:04:58.960 --> 4:05:00.960
 that AI has machine

4:05:00.960 --> 4:05:02.960
 learning has made in the recent decade

4:05:02.960 --> 4:05:04.960
 it's likely that the

4:05:04.960 --> 4:05:06.960
 important things that we don't know

4:05:06.960 --> 4:05:08.960
 are relatively simple there's

4:05:08.960 --> 4:05:10.960
 probably a handful of things

4:05:10.960 --> 4:05:12.960
 and my bet is that

4:05:12.960 --> 4:05:14.960
 I think there's less than

4:05:14.960 --> 4:05:16.960
 six key insights that need

4:05:16.960 --> 4:05:18.960
 to be made each one of them can probably

4:05:18.960 --> 4:05:20.960
 be written on the back of an envelope

4:05:20.960 --> 4:05:22.960
 we don't know what they are but when

4:05:22.960 --> 4:05:24.960
 they're put together in concert with

4:05:24.960 --> 4:05:26.960
 GPUs at scale and the data

4:05:26.960 --> 4:05:28.960
 that we all have access to

4:05:28.960 --> 4:05:30.960
 that we can make something that behaves

4:05:30.960 --> 4:05:32.960
 like a human being

4:05:32.960 --> 4:05:34.960
 or like a living creature

4:05:34.960 --> 4:05:36.960
 and that can then be educated

4:05:36.960 --> 4:05:38.960
 in whatever ways that we need to get to the point

4:05:38.960 --> 4:05:40.960
 where we can have

4:05:40.960 --> 4:05:42.960
 universal remote workers where

4:05:42.960 --> 4:05:44.960
 anything that somebody does

4:05:44.960 --> 4:05:46.960
 mediated by a computer and doesn't require

4:05:46.960 --> 4:05:48.960
 physical interaction

4:05:48.960 --> 4:05:50.960
 that an AGI will be able to do

4:05:50.960 --> 4:05:52.960
 we can already simulate the

4:05:52.960 --> 4:05:54.960
 equivalent of the zoom meetings

4:05:54.960 --> 4:05:56.960
 with avatars and

4:05:56.960 --> 4:05:58.960
 synthetic deepfakes and whatnot

4:05:58.960 --> 4:06:00.960
 we can definitely do that

4:06:00.960 --> 4:06:02.960
 we have superhuman capabilities

4:06:02.960 --> 4:06:04.960
 on any narrow thing that we can

4:06:04.960 --> 4:06:06.960
 that we can formalize and make a loss

4:06:06.960 --> 4:06:08.960
 function for but there's things we don't

4:06:08.960 --> 4:06:10.960
 know how to do now but I don't

4:06:10.960 --> 4:06:12.960
 think they are unapproachably

4:06:12.960 --> 4:06:14.960
 hard now that's incredibly hubristic

4:06:14.960 --> 4:06:16.960
 to say that it's like

4:06:16.960 --> 4:06:18.960
 but I think that what I said a couple

4:06:18.960 --> 4:06:20.960
 years ago is a 50% chance

4:06:20.960 --> 4:06:22.960
 that somewhere there will be signs of

4:06:22.960 --> 4:06:24.960
 life of AGI in

4:06:24.960 --> 4:06:26.960
 2030 and I've probably increased

4:06:26.960 --> 4:06:28.960
 that slightly I may be at

4:06:28.960 --> 4:06:30.960
 55, 60% now because I do

4:06:30.960 --> 4:06:32.960
 think there's a little sense of

4:06:32.960 --> 4:06:34.960
 acceleration there.

4:06:34.960 --> 4:06:36.960
 So I wonder what the and by the way you also

4:06:36.960 --> 4:06:38.960
 written that I bet

4:06:38.960 --> 4:06:40.960
 with hindsight we will find that clear

4:06:40.960 --> 4:06:42.960
 antecedents of all the critical

4:06:42.960 --> 4:06:44.960
 remaining steps for AGI

4:06:44.960 --> 4:06:46.960
 are already buried somewhere

4:06:46.960 --> 4:06:48.960
 in the vast literature of today so the ideas

4:06:48.960 --> 4:06:50.960
 are already there.

4:06:50.960 --> 4:06:52.960
 I think that's likely the case one of the

4:06:52.960 --> 4:06:54.960
 things that appeals to so many people

4:06:54.960 --> 4:06:56.960
 including me about the promise of AGI

4:06:56.960 --> 4:06:58.960
 is we know that

4:06:58.960 --> 4:07:00.960
 we're only drinking from a straw from

4:07:00.960 --> 4:07:02.960
 the fire hose of all the information

4:07:02.960 --> 4:07:04.960
 out there I mean you look at

4:07:04.960 --> 4:07:06.960
 just in a very narrowly

4:07:06.960 --> 4:07:08.960
 bounded field like machine learning like

4:07:08.960 --> 4:07:10.960
 you can't read all the papers that come out

4:07:10.960 --> 4:07:12.960
 all the time you can't go back and read

4:07:12.960 --> 4:07:14.960
 all the clever things that people did

4:07:14.960 --> 4:07:16.960
 in the 90s or earlier that people have

4:07:16.960 --> 4:07:18.960
 forgotten about because they didn't pan out

4:07:18.960 --> 4:07:20.960
 all the time when they were trying to do them

4:07:20.960 --> 4:07:22.960
 with 12 neurons

4:07:22.960 --> 4:07:24.960
 so that this idea that

4:07:24.960 --> 4:07:26.960
 yeah I think there are gems

4:07:26.960 --> 4:07:28.960
 buried in some of the older literature

4:07:28.960 --> 4:07:30.960
 that was not the path taken by everything

4:07:30.960 --> 4:07:32.960
 and you can see a kind of herd

4:07:32.960 --> 4:07:34.960
 mentality on the things that happen right

4:07:34.960 --> 4:07:36.960
 now it's almost funny to see

4:07:36.960 --> 4:07:38.960
 like oh Google does something and open AI

4:07:38.960 --> 4:07:40.960
 does something meta does something and

4:07:40.960 --> 4:07:42.960
 you know they're the same people that all

4:07:42.960 --> 4:07:44.960
 talk to each other and they all one up in

4:07:44.960 --> 4:07:46.960
 each other and they're all capable of

4:07:46.960 --> 4:07:48.960
 each other's work given a month

4:07:48.960 --> 4:07:50.960
 or two after somebody has an announcement

4:07:50.960 --> 4:07:52.960
 of that but there's

4:07:52.960 --> 4:07:54.960
 a whole world of possible

4:07:54.960 --> 4:07:56.960
 approaches to machine learning

4:07:56.960 --> 4:07:58.960
 and I think that

4:07:58.960 --> 4:08:00.960
 we probably will in hindsight go back and see

4:08:00.960 --> 4:08:02.960
 it's like yeah that was kind of clearly

4:08:02.960 --> 4:08:04.960
 predicted by this early paper

4:08:04.960 --> 4:08:06.960
 here you know and this turns out

4:08:06.960 --> 4:08:08.960
 that if you do this and this and take this result

4:08:08.960 --> 4:08:10.960
 from animal training

4:08:10.960 --> 4:08:12.960
 and this thing from neuroscience over here

4:08:12.960 --> 4:08:14.960
 and put it together and set

4:08:14.960 --> 4:08:16.960
 up this curriculum for them to learn in

4:08:16.960 --> 4:08:18.960
 that that's kind of what it took

4:08:18.960 --> 4:08:20.960
 you don't have too many people

4:08:20.960 --> 4:08:22.960
 now that are still saying it's not

4:08:22.960 --> 4:08:24.960
 possible or it's going to take hundreds of years

4:08:24.960 --> 4:08:26.960
 and 10 years ago you would get

4:08:26.960 --> 4:08:28.960
 you would collect get a collection of experts

4:08:28.960 --> 4:08:30.960
 and you would have a decent chunk on the margin

4:08:30.960 --> 4:08:32.960
 that either say not possible

4:08:32.960 --> 4:08:34.960
 or a couple hundred years

4:08:34.960 --> 4:08:36.960
 might be centuries and the median

4:08:36.960 --> 4:08:38.960
 estimate would be like

4:08:38.960 --> 4:08:40.960
 50 70 years and it's been

4:08:40.960 --> 4:08:42.960
 coming down and I know with me saying

4:08:42.960 --> 4:08:44.960
 eight years for something that still puts me

4:08:44.960 --> 4:08:46.960
 on the optimistic side but it's not

4:08:46.960 --> 4:08:48.960
 crazy out in the fringes

4:08:48.960 --> 4:08:50.960
 and just being able to look at that

4:08:50.960 --> 4:08:52.960
 at a meta level about the trend

4:08:52.960 --> 4:08:54.960
 of the

4:08:54.960 --> 4:08:56.960
 predictions going down there

4:08:56.960 --> 4:08:58.960
 the idea that something could

4:08:58.960 --> 4:09:00.960
 be happening relatively soon

4:09:00.960 --> 4:09:02.960
 now

4:09:02.960 --> 4:09:04.960
 I do not believe in fast takeoffs

4:09:04.960 --> 4:09:06.960
 that's one of the safety issues that people say

4:09:06.960 --> 4:09:08.960
 it's like oh it's going to go boom and the AI

4:09:08.960 --> 4:09:10.960
 is going to take over the world

4:09:10.960 --> 4:09:12.960
 and that's one of the reasons I don't think

4:09:12.960 --> 4:09:14.960
 that's a credible position

4:09:14.960 --> 4:09:16.960
 and I think that

4:09:16.960 --> 4:09:18.960
 we will go from a point where we start

4:09:18.960 --> 4:09:20.960
 seeing things that

4:09:20.960 --> 4:09:22.960
 that credibly look like

4:09:22.960 --> 4:09:24.960
 look like animals behaviors and

4:09:24.960 --> 4:09:26.960
 I have a human voice box wired into them

4:09:26.960 --> 4:09:28.960
 it's like I tried to get Elon to say

4:09:28.960 --> 4:09:30.960
 it's like you're you're pig in neurolink

4:09:30.960 --> 4:09:32.960
 give it a human voice box and let it start

4:09:32.960 --> 4:09:34.960
 learning human words

4:09:34.960 --> 4:09:36.960
 I think that you know I think animal intelligence

4:09:36.960 --> 4:09:38.960
 is closer to human intelligence than a lot

4:09:38.960 --> 4:09:40.960
 and I think that culture and modalities

4:09:40.960 --> 4:09:42.960
 of IO

4:09:42.960 --> 4:09:44.960
 make the gulf seem a lot bigger than it

4:09:44.960 --> 4:09:46.960
 actually is there's just that smooth

4:09:46.960 --> 4:09:48.960
 spectrum of how the brain developed

4:09:48.960 --> 4:09:50.960
 and cortexes and

4:09:50.960 --> 4:09:52.960
 scaling of different things going on there

4:09:52.960 --> 4:09:54.960
 cultural modalities of IO

4:09:54.960 --> 4:09:56.960
 yes languages

4:09:56.960 --> 4:09:58.960
 the

4:09:58.960 --> 4:10:00.960
 sort of loss in translation conceals a lot

4:10:00.960 --> 4:10:02.960
 of intelligence

4:10:02.960 --> 4:10:04.960
 so when you think about

4:10:04.960 --> 4:10:06.960
 signs of life for AGI

4:10:06.960 --> 4:10:08.960
 thinking about

4:10:08.960 --> 4:10:10.960
 human interpretable signs

4:10:10.960 --> 4:10:12.960
 so the example I give if we get to the point

4:10:12.960 --> 4:10:14.960
 where you've got a learning disabled toddler

4:10:14.960 --> 4:10:16.960
 some kind of real special needs

4:10:16.960 --> 4:10:18.960
 child that can still

4:10:18.960 --> 4:10:20.960
 interact with their favorite TV show

4:10:20.960 --> 4:10:22.960
 and video game and can be

4:10:22.960 --> 4:10:24.960
 trained and learn in some

4:10:24.960 --> 4:10:26.960
 appreciably human like way

4:10:26.960 --> 4:10:28.960
 at that point you can deploy an army

4:10:28.960 --> 4:10:30.960
 of engineers

4:10:30.960 --> 4:10:32.960
 cognitive scientist education

4:10:32.960 --> 4:10:34.960
 developmental education people

4:10:34.960 --> 4:10:36.960
 and you've got so many advantages

4:10:36.960 --> 4:10:38.960
 there unlike real education where you

4:10:38.960 --> 4:10:40.960
 can do rollbacks and A.B. testing

4:10:40.960 --> 4:10:42.960
 and you can find a golden path through a curriculum

4:10:42.960 --> 4:10:44.960
 of different things if you get to that point

4:10:44.960 --> 4:10:46.960
 learning disabled toddler

4:10:46.960 --> 4:10:48.960
 I think that it's

4:10:48.960 --> 4:10:50.960
 it's going to be a done deal

4:10:50.960 --> 4:10:52.960
 but you think we'll know when we see it

4:10:52.960 --> 4:10:54.960
 so

4:10:54.960 --> 4:10:56.960
 there's been a lot of really interesting

4:10:56.960 --> 4:10:58.960
 general learning progress from

4:10:58.960 --> 4:11:00.960
 deep mind

4:11:00.960 --> 4:11:02.960
 opening eye a little bit too

4:11:02.960 --> 4:11:04.960
 I tend to believe

4:11:04.960 --> 4:11:06.960
 that Tesla autopilot deserves

4:11:06.960 --> 4:11:08.960
 a lot more credit than it's getting

4:11:08.960 --> 4:11:10.960
 for making progress

4:11:10.960 --> 4:11:12.960
 on the general

4:11:12.960 --> 4:11:14.960
 on the doing the multitask learning

4:11:14.960 --> 4:11:16.960
 thing and increasing the number of tasks

4:11:16.960 --> 4:11:18.960
 and automating that

4:11:18.960 --> 4:11:20.960
 process of

4:11:20.960 --> 4:11:22.960
 sort of

4:11:22.960 --> 4:11:24.960
 learning from the edge

4:11:24.960 --> 4:11:26.960
 discovering the edge cases and learning from the edge cases

4:11:26.960 --> 4:11:28.960
 that is it's really

4:11:28.960 --> 4:11:30.960
 approaching from a different angle the general

4:11:30.960 --> 4:11:32.960
 learning problem

4:11:32.960 --> 4:11:34.960
 but the more clear approach

4:11:34.960 --> 4:11:36.960
 comes from deep mind where you have these

4:11:36.960 --> 4:11:38.960
 kind of game situations

4:11:38.960 --> 4:11:40.960
 build systems

4:11:40.960 --> 4:11:42.960
 there but I don't know

4:11:42.960 --> 4:11:44.960
 people seem to be quite

4:11:46.960 --> 4:11:48.960
 there will always be people that just won't

4:11:48.960 --> 4:11:50.960
 believe it and I fundamentally

4:11:50.960 --> 4:11:52.960
 don't care I mean I don't care

4:11:52.960 --> 4:11:54.960
 if they don't believe it I

4:11:54.960 --> 4:11:56.960
 when it starts doing people's jobs

4:11:56.960 --> 4:11:58.960
 and I mean I don't care about the

4:11:58.960 --> 4:12:00.960
 philosophical zombie argument at all

4:12:00.960 --> 4:12:02.960
 absolutely absolutely but will you

4:12:02.960 --> 4:12:04.960
 do you think you will notice that something

4:12:04.960 --> 4:12:06.960
 special has happened here

4:12:06.960 --> 4:12:08.960
 or

4:12:08.960 --> 4:12:10.960
 because to me I've been

4:12:10.960 --> 4:12:12.960
 noticing a lot of special things

4:12:12.960 --> 4:12:14.960
 I think a lot of credit should go

4:12:14.960 --> 4:12:16.960
 to deep mind for alpha

4:12:16.960 --> 4:12:18.960
 zero

4:12:18.960 --> 4:12:20.960
 that was truly special

4:12:20.960 --> 4:12:22.960
 self play mechanisms achieve

4:12:22.960 --> 4:12:24.960
 sort of solve problems that

4:12:24.960 --> 4:12:26.960
 used to be thought unsolvable

4:12:26.960 --> 4:12:28.960
 like the game of go

4:12:28.960 --> 4:12:30.960
 also I mean protein folding

4:12:30.960 --> 4:12:32.960
 starting to get into that space

4:12:32.960 --> 4:12:34.960
 where learning is doing

4:12:34.960 --> 4:12:36.960
 at first it wasn't

4:12:36.960 --> 4:12:38.960
 end to end learning

4:12:38.960 --> 4:12:40.960
 now it's end to end learning

4:12:40.960 --> 4:12:42.960
 of a very difficult previously thought

4:12:42.960 --> 4:12:44.960
 unsolvable problem of protein folding

4:12:44.960 --> 4:12:46.960
 and so

4:12:48.960 --> 4:12:50.960
 where do you think

4:12:50.960 --> 4:12:52.960
 would be a really magical

4:12:52.960 --> 4:12:54.960
 moment for you

4:12:54.960 --> 4:12:56.960
 there have been incredible things happening

4:12:56.960 --> 4:12:58.960
 in recent years like you say all of the

4:12:58.960 --> 4:13:00.960
 things from deep mind and open AI

4:13:00.960 --> 4:13:02.960
 that have been huge show piece

4:13:02.960 --> 4:13:04.960
 things but when you really get down to it

4:13:04.960 --> 4:13:06.960
 you read the papers and you look at the way

4:13:06.960 --> 4:13:08.960
 the models are going

4:13:08.960 --> 4:13:10.960
 it's still like a feed forward

4:13:10.960 --> 4:13:12.960
 you push something in something comes out

4:13:12.960 --> 4:13:14.960
 on the end I mean maybe there's

4:13:14.960 --> 4:13:16.960
 diffusion models or Monte Carlo

4:13:16.960 --> 4:13:18.960
 tree rollouts and different things going on

4:13:18.960 --> 4:13:20.960
 but it's not a being

4:13:20.960 --> 4:13:22.960
 it's not close to a being

4:13:22.960 --> 4:13:24.960
 that's going through

4:13:24.960 --> 4:13:26.960
 a lifelong learning process

4:13:26.960 --> 4:13:28.960
 do you want something that kind

4:13:28.960 --> 4:13:30.960
 of gives signs of a being

4:13:30.960 --> 4:13:32.960
 like what's the difference between

4:13:32.960 --> 4:13:34.960
 a neural network

4:13:34.960 --> 4:13:36.960
 a feed forward neural network

4:13:36.960 --> 4:13:38.960
 and a being

4:13:38.960 --> 4:13:40.960
 so where's the

4:13:40.960 --> 4:13:42.960
 fundamentally the brain is a recurrent neural network

4:13:42.960 --> 4:13:44.960
 generating an action policy

4:13:44.960 --> 4:13:46.960
 I mean it's implemented on a biological

4:13:46.960 --> 4:13:48.960
 substrate and it's interesting thinking about

4:13:48.960 --> 4:13:50.960
 things like that where we know fundamentally

4:13:50.960 --> 4:13:52.960
 the brain is not

4:13:52.960 --> 4:13:54.960
 a convolutional neural network or a transformer

4:13:54.960 --> 4:13:56.960
 those are specialized things that

4:13:56.960 --> 4:13:58.960
 are very valuable for what we're doing

4:13:58.960 --> 4:14:00.960
 but it's not the way the brain's doing now

4:14:00.960 --> 4:14:02.960
 I do think consciousness and AI

4:14:02.960 --> 4:14:04.960
 in general is a substrate

4:14:04.960 --> 4:14:06.960
 independent mechanism where

4:14:06.960 --> 4:14:08.960
 it doesn't have to be implemented the way the brain is

4:14:08.960 --> 4:14:10.960
 but if you've only got one existence

4:14:10.960 --> 4:14:12.960
 proof there's certainly some

4:14:12.960 --> 4:14:14.960
 value in caring about what it says and does

4:14:16.960 --> 4:14:18.960
 and so the idea that

4:14:18.960 --> 4:14:20.960
 anything that can be done with a narrow

4:14:20.960 --> 4:14:22.960
 AI that you can quantify up a

4:14:22.960 --> 4:14:24.960
 loss function for a reward mechanism

4:14:24.960 --> 4:14:26.960
 you're almost certainly going to be able

4:14:26.960 --> 4:14:28.960
 to produce something that's more

4:14:28.960 --> 4:14:30.960
 resource effective to train and deploy

4:14:30.960 --> 4:14:32.960
 and use in an inference mode

4:14:32.960 --> 4:14:34.960
 you know train a whole lot using an inference

4:14:34.960 --> 4:14:36.960
 but a living being

4:14:36.960 --> 4:14:38.960
 is going to be something that's a continuous

4:14:38.960 --> 4:14:40.960
 lifelong learned task

4:14:40.960 --> 4:14:42.960
 agnostic thing

4:14:42.960 --> 4:14:44.960
 and while a lot of learning

4:14:44.960 --> 4:14:46.960
 is really important too and the

4:14:46.960 --> 4:14:48.960
 long term memory

4:14:48.960 --> 4:14:50.960
 so memory is a big weird part

4:14:50.960 --> 4:14:52.960
 of that puzzle. We've got

4:14:52.960 --> 4:14:54.960
 again I have all the respect in the world

4:14:54.960 --> 4:14:56.960
 for the amazing things that are being done

4:14:56.960 --> 4:14:58.960
 now but sometimes they can be taken

4:14:58.960 --> 4:15:00.960
 a little bit out of context with things

4:15:00.960 --> 4:15:02.960
 like there's some smoke and

4:15:02.960 --> 4:15:04.960
 mirrors going on like the GATO

4:15:04.960 --> 4:15:06.960
 the recent work the multi task learning stuff

4:15:06.960 --> 4:15:08.960
 you know it's amazing that it's the one

4:15:08.960 --> 4:15:10.960
 it's one model that plays all

4:15:10.960 --> 4:15:12.960
 the Atari games I am as well

4:15:12.960 --> 4:15:14.960
 as doing all these other things

4:15:14.960 --> 4:15:16.960
 but I of course it didn't learn

4:15:16.960 --> 4:15:18.960
 to do all of those it was instructed

4:15:18.960 --> 4:15:20.960
 in doing that by other reinforcement

4:15:20.960 --> 4:15:22.960
 learners going through and doing that

4:15:22.960 --> 4:15:24.960
 and even in the case of all the games

4:15:24.960 --> 4:15:26.960
 it's still going with a specific

4:15:26.960 --> 4:15:28.960
 hand coded reward function

4:15:28.960 --> 4:15:30.960
 in each of those Atari games

4:15:30.960 --> 4:15:32.960
 where it's not that you know how does it

4:15:32.960 --> 4:15:34.960
 it just wants to spend its summer afternoon

4:15:34.960 --> 4:15:36.960
 playing Atari because that's the most interesting

4:15:36.960 --> 4:15:38.960
 thing for it so it's again not

4:15:38.960 --> 4:15:40.960
 a general it's not learning the way

4:15:40.960 --> 4:15:42.960
 humans learn and there's

4:15:42.960 --> 4:15:44.960
 I believe a lot of things that are

4:15:44.960 --> 4:15:46.960
 challenging to make a loss function

4:15:46.960 --> 4:15:48.960
 for that you can train through

4:15:48.960 --> 4:15:50.960
 these existing conventional things

4:15:50.960 --> 4:15:52.960
 we're going to chip away at all the things

4:15:52.960 --> 4:15:54.960
 that people do I am

4:15:54.960 --> 4:15:56.960
 that we can turn into narrow

4:15:56.960 --> 4:15:58.960
 AI problems and

4:15:58.960 --> 4:16:00.960
 billions of probably trillions of

4:16:00.960 --> 4:16:02.960
 dollars of value are going to be created

4:16:02.960 --> 4:16:04.960
 by that but there's still going to be

4:16:04.960 --> 4:16:06.960
 a set of things and we've got questionable

4:16:06.960 --> 4:16:08.960
 cases like the self driving car

4:16:08.960 --> 4:16:10.960
 where it's possible it's

4:16:10.960 --> 4:16:12.960
 not my bet but it's plausible

4:16:12.960 --> 4:16:14.960
 that the long tail could be problematic

4:16:14.960 --> 4:16:16.960
 enough that that really does require

4:16:16.960 --> 4:16:18.960
 a full on artificial general intelligence

4:16:18.960 --> 4:16:20.960
 I am the counter argument

4:16:20.960 --> 4:16:22.960
 is that data solves almost everything

4:16:22.960 --> 4:16:24.960
 is an interpolation problem if you have enough

4:16:24.960 --> 4:16:26.960
 data and Tesla may be able to get

4:16:26.960 --> 4:16:28.960
 enough data from all

4:16:28.960 --> 4:16:30.960
 their deployed stuff to be able to work like

4:16:30.960 --> 4:16:32.960
 that but maybe not and

4:16:32.960 --> 4:16:34.960
 there are all the other problems about like say

4:16:34.960 --> 4:16:36.960
 you want to have a strategy meeting

4:16:36.960 --> 4:16:38.960
 and you want to go ahead and bring in all

4:16:38.960 --> 4:16:40.960
 the remote workers and your consultants

4:16:40.960 --> 4:16:42.960
 and you want a world where some of those

4:16:42.960 --> 4:16:44.960
 could be AIs that are

4:16:44.960 --> 4:16:46.960
 you know that are talking and interacting

4:16:46.960 --> 4:16:48.960
 with you in an area

4:16:48.960 --> 4:16:50.960
 that is too murky to have a crisp loss

4:16:50.960 --> 4:16:52.960
 function but they still have

4:16:52.960 --> 4:16:54.960
 things that on some level they're

4:16:54.960 --> 4:16:56.960
 rewarded on some internal level

4:16:56.960 --> 4:16:58.960
 for building a valuable to humans

4:16:58.960 --> 4:17:00.960
 kind of life

4:17:00.960 --> 4:17:02.960
 and ability to interact with things

4:17:02.960 --> 4:17:04.960
 see I still think

4:17:04.960 --> 4:17:06.960
 that self driving car

4:17:06.960 --> 4:17:08.960
 solving that problem will take us very far

4:17:08.960 --> 4:17:10.960
 towards AGI you might not need AGI

4:17:10.960 --> 4:17:12.960
 but I am really

4:17:12.960 --> 4:17:14.960
 inspired by what

4:17:14.960 --> 4:17:16.960
 autopilot is doing

4:17:16.960 --> 4:17:18.960
 Waymo, so some of the other

4:17:18.960 --> 4:17:20.960
 companies I think Waymo leads the way

4:17:20.960 --> 4:17:22.960
 there is also really

4:17:22.960 --> 4:17:24.960
 interesting but they don't have quite as ambitious

4:17:24.960 --> 4:17:26.960
 of an effort in terms of

4:17:26.960 --> 4:17:28.960
 learning based

4:17:28.960 --> 4:17:30.960
 sort of data hungry

4:17:30.960 --> 4:17:32.960
 approach to driving which I think

4:17:32.960 --> 4:17:34.960
 is very close to the kind of thing that would

4:17:34.960 --> 4:17:36.960
 take us far

4:17:36.960 --> 4:17:38.960
 towards AGI. Yeah and it's a funny thing

4:17:38.960 --> 4:17:40.960
 because as far as I can tell

4:17:40.960 --> 4:17:42.960
 Elon is completely serious about all of his

4:17:42.960 --> 4:17:44.960
 concerns about AGI

4:17:44.960 --> 4:17:46.960
 being an existential threat and

4:17:46.960 --> 4:17:48.960
 I tried to draw him out to talk about AI

4:17:48.960 --> 4:17:50.960
 and he just didn't want to

4:17:50.960 --> 4:17:52.960
 and I think that

4:17:52.960 --> 4:17:54.960
 I get that little fatalistic sense from him

4:17:54.960 --> 4:17:56.960
 and it's weird because his company

4:17:56.960 --> 4:17:58.960
 could very well be the leading company

4:17:58.960 --> 4:18:00.960
 leading towards a lot of that where

4:18:00.960 --> 4:18:02.960
 Tesla being a super pragmatic company

4:18:02.960 --> 4:18:04.960
 that's doing things because

4:18:04.960 --> 4:18:06.960
 they really want to solve this actual problem

4:18:06.960 --> 4:18:08.960
 it's a different vibe than the research

4:18:08.960 --> 4:18:10.960
 oriented companies where

4:18:10.960 --> 4:18:12.960
 it's a great time to be an AI researcher

4:18:12.960 --> 4:18:14.960
 you've got your pick of trillion dollar companies

4:18:14.960 --> 4:18:16.960
 that will pay you to kind of work on the problems

4:18:16.960 --> 4:18:18.960
 you're interested in but that's not

4:18:18.960 --> 4:18:20.960
 necessarily driving hard towards

4:18:20.960 --> 4:18:22.960
 the core problem of

4:18:22.960 --> 4:18:24.960
 AGI as something that's going to produce

4:18:24.960 --> 4:18:26.960
 a lot of value by doing things that

4:18:26.960 --> 4:18:28.960
 you know that people currently do

4:18:28.960 --> 4:18:30.960
 or would like to do.

4:18:30.960 --> 4:18:32.960
 I have a million questions to you

4:18:32.960 --> 4:18:34.960
 about your ideas about

4:18:34.960 --> 4:18:36.960
 AGI but do you think

4:18:36.960 --> 4:18:38.960
 it needs to be embodied

4:18:38.960 --> 4:18:40.960
 do you think it needs to have a body

4:18:40.960 --> 4:18:42.960
 to start to

4:18:42.960 --> 4:18:44.960
 notice the signs of life

4:18:44.960 --> 4:18:46.960
 to develop the kind of system that's

4:18:46.960 --> 4:18:48.960
 able to reason

4:18:48.960 --> 4:18:50.960
 perceive the world in the way that an AGI

4:18:50.960 --> 4:18:52.960
 should and act in the world

4:18:52.960 --> 4:18:54.960
 so should we be thinking about robots

4:18:54.960 --> 4:18:56.960
 or can this be achieved in a

4:18:56.960 --> 4:18:58.960
 purely digital system?

4:18:58.960 --> 4:19:00.960
 What's your opinion on that and that's

4:19:00.960 --> 4:19:02.960
 that no it does not need

4:19:02.960 --> 4:19:04.960
 to be embodied in the physical world

4:19:04.960 --> 4:19:06.960
 where you could say most of my

4:19:06.960 --> 4:19:08.960
 career is about making simulated

4:19:08.960 --> 4:19:10.960
 virtual worlds in games

4:19:10.960 --> 4:19:12.960
 or virtual reality and so

4:19:12.960 --> 4:19:14.960
 on a fundamental level I believe that

4:19:14.960 --> 4:19:16.960
 you can make a simulated environment that provides

4:19:16.960 --> 4:19:18.960
 much of the value of what the real

4:19:18.960 --> 4:19:20.960
 environment does and restricting

4:19:20.960 --> 4:19:22.960
 yourself to operating

4:19:22.960 --> 4:19:24.960
 at real time in the physical world with

4:19:24.960 --> 4:19:26.960
 physical objects I think is an enormous

4:19:26.960 --> 4:19:28.960
 handicap I mean that's one

4:19:28.960 --> 4:19:30.960
 of the real lessons driven home by all my

4:19:30.960 --> 4:19:32.960
 aerospace work is that

4:19:32.960 --> 4:19:34.960
 you know

4:19:34.960 --> 4:19:36.960
 reality is a bitch in so many ways there

4:19:36.960 --> 4:19:38.960
 we're dealing with all the mechanical components

4:19:38.960 --> 4:19:40.960
 like everything fails, Murphy's law

4:19:40.960 --> 4:19:42.960
 even if you've done it right before on your fifth one

4:19:42.960 --> 4:19:44.960
 it might come out differently

4:19:44.960 --> 4:19:46.960
 so yeah I think that

4:19:46.960 --> 4:19:48.960
 anybody that

4:19:48.960 --> 4:19:50.960
 is all in on the embodied aspect of it

4:19:50.960 --> 4:19:52.960
 they are tying a huge weight

4:19:52.960 --> 4:19:54.960
 to their ankles and I think

4:19:54.960 --> 4:19:56.960
 I would almost

4:19:56.960 --> 4:19:58.960
 count them out anybody that's making that a cornerstone

4:19:58.960 --> 4:20:00.960
 of their belief about it I would almost write

4:20:00.960 --> 4:20:02.960
 them off as being worried about them

4:20:02.960 --> 4:20:04.960
 getting to AGI first

4:20:04.960 --> 4:20:06.960
 I was very surprised that Elon's big on

4:20:06.960 --> 4:20:08.960
 the humanoid robots

4:20:08.960 --> 4:20:10.960
 I mean like the NASA Robonaut stuff was always

4:20:10.960 --> 4:20:12.960
 almost a gag line

4:20:12.960 --> 4:20:14.960
 like what are you doing people?

4:20:14.960 --> 4:20:16.960
 Well that's very interesting because he has a very pragmatic

4:20:16.960 --> 4:20:18.960
 view of that that's just

4:20:20.960 --> 4:20:22.960
 a way to solve a particular problem

4:20:22.960 --> 4:20:24.960
 in a factory. Now I do think that

4:20:24.960 --> 4:20:26.960
 once you have an AGI

4:20:26.960 --> 4:20:28.960
 robotic bodies, humanoid bodies are going to be

4:20:28.960 --> 4:20:30.960
 enormously valuable I just don't think

4:20:30.960 --> 4:20:32.960
 they're helpful getting to AGI

4:20:32.960 --> 4:20:34.960
 Well he has a very sort of practical view

4:20:34.960 --> 4:20:36.960
 which I disagree with and I argue with him

4:20:36.960 --> 4:20:38.960
 but it's a practical view that

4:20:38.960 --> 4:20:40.960
 there's you know you could

4:20:40.960 --> 4:20:42.960
 transfer the problem of

4:20:42.960 --> 4:20:44.960
 driving to the problem of

4:20:44.960 --> 4:20:46.960
 robotic manipulation

4:20:46.960 --> 4:20:48.960
 because so much of it is perception

4:20:48.960 --> 4:20:50.960
 it's perception

4:20:50.960 --> 4:20:52.960
 and it's just a different context

4:20:52.960 --> 4:20:54.960
 and so you can apply all the same

4:20:54.960 --> 4:20:56.960
 kind of data engine

4:20:56.960 --> 4:20:58.960
 learning processes to a

4:20:58.960 --> 4:21:00.960
 different environment and so why not

4:21:00.960 --> 4:21:02.960
 apply it to the humanoid robot environment

4:21:02.960 --> 4:21:04.960
 but

4:21:04.960 --> 4:21:06.960
 I think

4:21:06.960 --> 4:21:08.960
 I do think that there's a certain

4:21:08.960 --> 4:21:10.960
 magic to the body

4:21:10.960 --> 4:21:12.960
 robot.

4:21:12.960 --> 4:21:14.960
 That may be the thing that finally convinces people

4:21:14.960 --> 4:21:16.960
 but again I don't really care

4:21:16.960 --> 4:21:18.960
 that much about convincing people

4:21:18.960 --> 4:21:20.960
 but the world that I'm looking towards

4:21:20.960 --> 4:21:22.960
 is you know you

4:21:22.960 --> 4:21:24.960
 you go to the website and say

4:21:24.960 --> 4:21:26.960
 I want five Frank 1As to

4:21:26.960 --> 4:21:28.960
 work on my team today and they all spin up

4:21:28.960 --> 4:21:30.960
 and they start showing up in your Zoom meetings

4:21:30.960 --> 4:21:32.960
 to push back but also

4:21:32.960 --> 4:21:34.960
 to agree with you but first to push back

4:21:34.960 --> 4:21:36.960
 I do think you need to convince people

4:21:36.960 --> 4:21:38.960
 for them to welcome that thing

4:21:38.960 --> 4:21:40.960
 into their life.

4:21:40.960 --> 4:21:42.960
 I think there's enough businesses that operate

4:21:42.960 --> 4:21:44.960
 on an objective kind of profit

4:21:44.960 --> 4:21:46.960
 loss sort of basis that

4:21:46.960 --> 4:21:48.960
 I mean if you look at how many things

4:21:48.960 --> 4:21:50.960
 again talking about the world as

4:21:50.960 --> 4:21:52.960
 an evolutionary space there

4:21:52.960 --> 4:21:54.960
 when you do have free markets and you have

4:21:54.960 --> 4:21:56.960
 entrepreneurs

4:21:56.960 --> 4:21:58.960
 you're going to have people that are going to be willing to go out and try

4:21:58.960 --> 4:22:00.960
 whatever crazy things

4:22:00.960 --> 4:22:02.960
 and when it proves to be beneficial

4:22:02.960 --> 4:22:04.960
 you know there's fast followers in all sorts of

4:22:04.960 --> 4:22:06.960
 places.

4:22:06.960 --> 4:22:08.960
 Yeah and you're saying that

4:22:08.960 --> 4:22:10.960
 Quake and VR

4:22:10.960 --> 4:22:12.960
 is a kind of embodiment but just in

4:22:12.960 --> 4:22:14.960
 a digital world and if you're able to

4:22:14.960 --> 4:22:16.960
 demonstrate

4:22:16.960 --> 4:22:18.960
 if you're able to do something productive in that kind

4:22:18.960 --> 4:22:20.960
 of digital reality

4:22:22.960 --> 4:22:24.960
 then AGI doesn't

4:22:24.960 --> 4:22:26.960
 need to have a body. Yeah it's like one of the really

4:22:26.960 --> 4:22:28.960
 practical technical questions that I kind

4:22:28.960 --> 4:22:30.960
 of keep arguing with myself over

4:22:30.960 --> 4:22:32.960
 if you're doing a training

4:22:32.960 --> 4:22:34.960
 and learning and you've got like you can

4:22:34.960 --> 4:22:36.960
 watch Sesame Street you can play master system

4:22:36.960 --> 4:22:38.960
 games or something is it enough

4:22:38.960 --> 4:22:40.960
 to have just a video feed that

4:22:40.960 --> 4:22:42.960
 is that video coming in

4:22:42.960 --> 4:22:44.960
 or should it literally be on

4:22:44.960 --> 4:22:46.960
 a virtual TV set in a virtual room

4:22:46.960 --> 4:22:48.960
 even if it's a simple room

4:22:48.960 --> 4:22:50.960
 just to have that sense of

4:22:50.960 --> 4:22:52.960
 you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen

4:22:52.960 --> 4:22:54.960
 versus having the screen beamed directly

4:22:54.960 --> 4:22:56.960
 into your retinas and

4:22:56.960 --> 4:22:58.960
 I think it's possible

4:22:58.960 --> 4:23:00.960
 to maybe get past some of these signs

4:23:00.960 --> 4:23:02.960
 of life of things with the

4:23:02.960 --> 4:23:04.960
 just kind of projected directly into the receptor

4:23:04.960 --> 4:23:06.960
 fields but eventually

4:23:06.960 --> 4:23:08.960
 for more

4:23:08.960 --> 4:23:10.960
 kind of human emotional connection

4:23:10.960 --> 4:23:12.960
 for things probably having

4:23:12.960 --> 4:23:14.960
 some VR room with a lot of screens

4:23:14.960 --> 4:23:16.960
 in it for the AI to be learning in

4:23:16.960 --> 4:23:18.960
 is likely helpful

4:23:18.960 --> 4:23:20.960
 it may be a world of different AIs

4:23:20.960 --> 4:23:22.960
 interacting with each other. That self play I do think

4:23:22.960 --> 4:23:24.960
 is one of the critical things where

4:23:24.960 --> 4:23:26.960
 socialization wise one of the other limitations

4:23:26.960 --> 4:23:28.960
 I set for myself thinking about

4:23:28.960 --> 4:23:30.960
 these is I need

4:23:30.960 --> 4:23:32.960
 something that is at least

4:23:32.960 --> 4:23:34.960
 potentially real time because

4:23:34.960 --> 4:23:36.960
 I want it's nice you can always slow down

4:23:36.960 --> 4:23:38.960
 time you can run on a subscale

4:23:38.960 --> 4:23:40.960
 system and test an algorithm

4:23:40.960 --> 4:23:42.960
 at some lower level and if you've got

4:23:42.960 --> 4:23:44.960
 extra horsepower running it faster than real time

4:23:44.960 --> 4:23:46.960
 is a great thing but

4:23:46.960 --> 4:23:48.960
 I want to be able to

4:23:48.960 --> 4:23:50.960
 have the AIs

4:23:50.960 --> 4:23:52.960
 either socially interact with each other

4:23:52.960 --> 4:23:54.960
 or critically with actual

4:23:54.960 --> 4:23:56.960
 people you're sort of child development psychiatrist

4:23:56.960 --> 4:23:58.960
 that comes in and

4:23:58.960 --> 4:24:00.960
 interacts and does the good boy, bad boy

4:24:00.960 --> 4:24:02.960
 sort of thing

4:24:02.960 --> 4:24:04.960
 as they're going through and exploring different things

4:24:04.960 --> 4:24:06.960
 and it's nice to

4:24:06.960 --> 4:24:08.960
 I come back to the value of

4:24:08.960 --> 4:24:10.960
 constraints in a lot of ways and if I say

4:24:10.960 --> 4:24:12.960
 well one of my constraints is real time

4:24:12.960 --> 4:24:14.960
 operation I mean it might still be

4:24:14.960 --> 4:24:16.960
 a huge data center full of

4:24:16.960 --> 4:24:18.960
 computers but it should be

4:24:18.960 --> 4:24:20.960
 able to interact on a zoom meeting

4:24:20.960 --> 4:24:22.960
 with people and that's how you also do

4:24:22.960 --> 4:24:24.960
 start convincing people even if it's not

4:24:24.960 --> 4:24:26.960
 a robot body moving around which eventually

4:24:26.960 --> 4:24:28.960
 gets to irrefutable levels

4:24:28.960 --> 4:24:30.960
 but if you can go ahead and

4:24:30.960 --> 4:24:32.960
 not just type back and forth to a GPT

4:24:32.960 --> 4:24:34.960
 bot on something but

4:24:34.960 --> 4:24:36.960
 you're literally talking to them

4:24:36.960 --> 4:24:38.960
 embodied over zoom form

4:24:38.960 --> 4:24:40.960
 and working through problems

4:24:40.960 --> 4:24:42.960
 with them or exploring situations

4:24:42.960 --> 4:24:44.960
 having conversations

4:24:44.960 --> 4:24:46.960
 that are fully stateful and learned

4:24:46.960 --> 4:24:48.960
 I think that

4:24:48.960 --> 4:24:50.960
 that's a valuable thing so I do keep

4:24:50.960 --> 4:24:52.960
 all of my eyes on things that

4:24:52.960 --> 4:24:54.960
 can be implemented within sort of that

4:24:54.960 --> 4:24:56.960
 30 frames per second

4:24:56.960 --> 4:24:58.960
 kind of work and I think that's feasible

4:24:58.960 --> 4:25:00.960
 Do you think the most compelling experience

4:25:00.960 --> 4:25:02.960
 is that it first will be

4:25:02.960 --> 4:25:04.960
 for pleasure

4:25:04.960 --> 4:25:06.960
 or for business as they ask in airports

4:25:06.960 --> 4:25:08.960
 so

4:25:08.960 --> 4:25:10.960
 meaning is it

4:25:10.960 --> 4:25:12.960
 if it's interacting with

4:25:12.960 --> 4:25:14.960
 AI

4:25:14.960 --> 4:25:16.960
 agents will it be

4:25:16.960 --> 4:25:18.960
 sort of like friends

4:25:20.960 --> 4:25:22.960
 entertainment

4:25:22.960 --> 4:25:24.960
 almost like a therapist or whatever

4:25:24.960 --> 4:25:26.960
 that kind of interaction

4:25:26.960 --> 4:25:28.960
 or is it in the business setting something

4:25:28.960 --> 4:25:30.960
 like you said brainstorming different ideas

4:25:30.960 --> 4:25:32.960
 sort of

4:25:32.960 --> 4:25:34.960
 this is all a different formulation of

4:25:34.960 --> 4:25:36.960
 a kind of a touring test or the spirit

4:25:36.960 --> 4:25:38.960
 of the original touring test where do you think

4:25:38.960 --> 4:25:40.960
 the biggest benefit will first come

4:25:40.960 --> 4:25:42.960
 So it's going to start off hugely expensive

4:25:42.960 --> 4:25:44.960
 I mean you're going to

4:25:44.960 --> 4:25:46.960
 we're still all guessing about

4:25:46.960 --> 4:25:48.960
 what compute is going to be necessary

4:25:48.960 --> 4:25:50.960
 I fall on the side of I don't think

4:25:50.960 --> 4:25:52.960
 you run the numbers and you're like 86 billion neurons

4:25:52.960 --> 4:25:54.960
 100 trillion synapses

4:25:54.960 --> 4:25:56.960
 I don't think those all need to be weights

4:25:56.960 --> 4:25:58.960
 I don't think we need models that are quite that big

4:25:58.960 --> 4:26:00.960
 that often

4:26:00.960 --> 4:26:02.960
 we've got reasonable estimates

4:26:02.960 --> 4:26:04.960
 of what some parts of the brain do

4:26:04.960 --> 4:26:06.960
 we don't have the neocortex formula

4:26:06.960 --> 4:26:08.960
 but we kind of get some of the other sensory

4:26:08.960 --> 4:26:10.960
 processing and it doesn't feel like

4:26:10.960 --> 4:26:12.960
 we need to we can simulate that in computers

4:26:12.960 --> 4:26:14.960
 for less weights but still

4:26:14.960 --> 4:26:16.960
 it's probably going to be

4:26:16.960 --> 4:26:18.960
 thousands of GPUs

4:26:18.960 --> 4:26:20.960
 to be running

4:26:20.960 --> 4:26:22.960
 a human level AGI

4:26:22.960 --> 4:26:24.960
 depending on how it's implemented that might give you

4:26:24.960 --> 4:26:26.960
 sort of a clan of 128

4:26:26.960 --> 4:26:28.960
 run in batch people

4:26:28.960 --> 4:26:30.960
 depending on whether they're sparsity in the way

4:26:30.960 --> 4:26:32.960
 the weights and things are set up

4:26:32.960 --> 4:26:34.960
 if it is a reasonably dense thing

4:26:34.960 --> 4:26:36.960
 then just the memory bandwidth tradeoffs

4:26:36.960 --> 4:26:38.960
 means you get 128 of them at the same time

4:26:38.960 --> 4:26:40.960
 and either it's

4:26:40.960 --> 4:26:42.960
 all feeding together learning in parallel

4:26:42.960 --> 4:26:44.960
 or kind of all running together

4:26:44.960 --> 4:26:46.960
 I kind of talking to a bunch of people

4:26:46.960 --> 4:26:48.960
 but still if you've got thousands of GPUs

4:26:48.960 --> 4:26:50.960
 necessary to run these

4:26:50.960 --> 4:26:52.960
 things it's going to be kind of

4:26:52.960 --> 4:26:54.960
 expensive where it might start

4:26:54.960 --> 4:26:56.960
 off a thousand dollars

4:26:56.960 --> 4:26:58.960
 an hour for your even post

4:26:58.960 --> 4:27:00.960
 development or something for that

4:27:00.960 --> 4:27:02.960
 which would be something that you would only use

4:27:02.960 --> 4:27:04.960
 for a business

4:27:04.960 --> 4:27:06.960
 something where you think they're going to help you make

4:27:06.960 --> 4:27:08.960
 a strategic decision or point out something

4:27:08.960 --> 4:27:10.960
 super important but I also

4:27:10.960 --> 4:27:12.960
 am completely confident

4:27:12.960 --> 4:27:14.960
 that we will have another factor

4:27:14.960 --> 4:27:16.960
 of a thousand in cost performance

4:27:16.960 --> 4:27:18.960
 increase in AGI

4:27:18.960 --> 4:27:20.960
 type calculations

4:27:20.960 --> 4:27:22.960
 not in general computing necessarily

4:27:22.960 --> 4:27:24.960
 but there's so much more that we can do

4:27:24.960 --> 4:27:26.960
 with packaging, making those right tradeoffs

4:27:26.960 --> 4:27:28.960
 all those same types of things that

4:27:28.960 --> 4:27:30.960
 in the next couple of decades

4:27:30.960 --> 4:27:32.960
 thousand X easy and then you're down to a dollar an hour

4:27:32.960 --> 4:27:34.960
 and

4:27:34.960 --> 4:27:36.960
 then you're kind of like well

4:27:36.960 --> 4:27:38.960
 I should have an entourage of AIs

4:27:38.960 --> 4:27:40.960
 that are following me around

4:27:40.960 --> 4:27:42.960
 helping me out on anything that I want them to do

4:27:42.960 --> 4:27:44.960
 that's one interesting trajectory

4:27:44.960 --> 4:27:46.960
 but I'll push back

4:27:46.960 --> 4:27:48.960
 because I have a

4:27:48.960 --> 4:27:50.960
 so in that case

4:27:50.960 --> 4:27:52.960
 with a thousand dollars

4:27:52.960 --> 4:27:54.960
 it should actually provide some value

4:27:54.960 --> 4:27:56.960
 I think it's easier

4:27:56.960 --> 4:27:58.960
 for cheaper

4:27:58.960 --> 4:28:00.960
 to provide

4:28:00.960 --> 4:28:02.960
 value via a dumb

4:28:02.960 --> 4:28:04.960
 AI

4:28:04.960 --> 4:28:06.960
 that will take us towards AGI

4:28:06.960 --> 4:28:08.960
 to just have a friend

4:28:08.960 --> 4:28:10.960
 I think there's an ocean of loneliness

4:28:10.960 --> 4:28:12.960
 in the world

4:28:12.960 --> 4:28:14.960
 and I think an effective friend

4:28:14.960 --> 4:28:16.960
 that doesn't have to be perfect

4:28:16.960 --> 4:28:18.960
 that doesn't have to be intelligent

4:28:18.960 --> 4:28:20.960
 empathic

4:28:20.960 --> 4:28:22.960
 having emotional intelligence

4:28:22.960 --> 4:28:24.960
 having ability to remember things

4:28:24.960 --> 4:28:26.960
 having ability to listen

4:28:26.960 --> 4:28:28.960
 most of us don't listen to each other

4:28:28.960 --> 4:28:30.960
 one of the things that love

4:28:30.960 --> 4:28:32.960
 and when you care about somebody

4:28:32.960 --> 4:28:34.960
 when you love somebody is when you listen

4:28:34.960 --> 4:28:36.960
 and that is something we treasure about each other

4:28:36.960 --> 4:28:38.960
 and

4:28:38.960 --> 4:28:40.960
 if an AI can do that kind of thing

4:28:40.960 --> 4:28:42.960
 I think that

4:28:42.960 --> 4:28:44.960
 provides a huge amount of value

4:28:44.960 --> 4:28:46.960
 and very importantly

4:28:46.960 --> 4:28:48.960
 provides value in its ability

4:28:48.960 --> 4:28:50.960
 to listen

4:28:50.960 --> 4:28:52.960
 and understand

4:28:52.960 --> 4:28:54.960
 versus provide really good advice

4:28:54.960 --> 4:28:56.960
 I think providing really good advice

4:28:56.960 --> 4:28:58.960
 is another next level

4:28:58.960 --> 4:29:00.960
 step that would

4:29:00.960 --> 4:29:02.960
 I think it's just

4:29:02.960 --> 4:29:04.960
 easier to do companionship

4:29:04.960 --> 4:29:06.960
 I wouldn't disagree

4:29:06.960 --> 4:29:08.960
 I think that there's very few things

4:29:08.960 --> 4:29:10.960
 that I would argue can't be reduced

4:29:10.960 --> 4:29:12.960
 to some kind of a narrow

4:29:12.960 --> 4:29:14.960
 AI

4:29:14.960 --> 4:29:16.960
 a trillion dollars of value easily

4:29:16.960 --> 4:29:18.960
 and all the things that can be done there

4:29:18.960 --> 4:29:20.960
 and a lot of it can be done with smoke and mirrors

4:29:20.960 --> 4:29:22.960
 without having to go the whole thing

4:29:22.960 --> 4:29:24.960
 there's going to be the equivalent of the Doom

4:29:24.960 --> 4:29:26.960
 the Doom version

4:29:26.960 --> 4:29:28.960
 for the AGI that's

4:29:28.960 --> 4:29:30.960
 not really AGI, it's all smoke and mirrors

4:29:30.960 --> 4:29:32.960
 but it happens to do another valuable things

4:29:32.960 --> 4:29:34.960
 that it's enormously useful

4:29:34.960 --> 4:29:36.960
 and valuable to people

4:29:36.960 --> 4:29:38.960
 but at some point you do want to get to the point

4:29:38.960 --> 4:29:40.960
 where you have the fully general thing

4:29:40.960 --> 4:29:42.960
 and you stop making bespoke specialized systems

4:29:42.960 --> 4:29:44.960
 for each thing and you wind up

4:29:44.960 --> 4:29:46.960
 start using the higher level language

4:29:46.960 --> 4:29:48.960
 instead of writing everything in assembly language

4:29:48.960 --> 4:29:50.960
 what about consciousness

4:29:50.960 --> 4:29:52.960
 the C word

4:29:52.960 --> 4:29:54.960
 what do you think that's

4:29:54.960 --> 4:29:56.960
 fundamental

4:29:56.960 --> 4:29:58.960
 to solving AGI

4:29:58.960 --> 4:30:00.960
 or is it a quirk of human

4:30:00.960 --> 4:30:02.960
 cognition

4:30:02.960 --> 4:30:04.960
 so I think most of the arguments

4:30:04.960 --> 4:30:06.960
 about consciousness don't have a whole

4:30:06.960 --> 4:30:08.960
 lot of merit

4:30:08.960 --> 4:30:10.960
 I think that consciousness is kind of

4:30:10.960 --> 4:30:12.960
 the way the brain feels when it's operating

4:30:12.960 --> 4:30:14.960
 and

4:30:14.960 --> 4:30:16.960
 this idea that

4:30:16.960 --> 4:30:18.960
 I do generally subscribe

4:30:18.960 --> 4:30:20.960
 to sort of the pandemonium theories of consciousness

4:30:20.960 --> 4:30:22.960
 where there's all these things bubbling around

4:30:22.960 --> 4:30:24.960
 and I think of them as

4:30:24.960 --> 4:30:26.960
 kind of slightly randomized

4:30:26.960 --> 4:30:28.960
 sparse distributed memory bit strings of things

4:30:28.960 --> 4:30:30.960
 that are kind of happening

4:30:30.960 --> 4:30:32.960
 recalling different associative memories

4:30:32.960 --> 4:30:34.960
 and eventually you get some level of consensus

4:30:34.960 --> 4:30:36.960
 and it bubbles up to the point of being a conscious

4:30:36.960 --> 4:30:38.960
 thought there

4:30:38.960 --> 4:30:40.960
 there's a little bit of stochasticity

4:30:40.960 --> 4:30:42.960
 that are sitting on in this

4:30:42.960 --> 4:30:44.960
 as it cycles between different things

4:30:44.960 --> 4:30:46.960
 and recalls different memory

4:30:46.960 --> 4:30:48.960
 that's largely our imagination and creativity

4:30:48.960 --> 4:30:50.960
 so I don't think

4:30:50.960 --> 4:30:52.960
 there's anything deeply magical

4:30:52.960 --> 4:30:54.960
 about it certainly not symbolic

4:30:54.960 --> 4:30:56.960
 I think it is generally the flow of these

4:30:56.960 --> 4:30:58.960
 associations

4:30:58.960 --> 4:31:00.960
 drawn up with stochastic

4:31:00.960 --> 4:31:02.960
 noise overlaid on top of them

4:31:02.960 --> 4:31:04.960
 I think so much of that is

4:31:04.960 --> 4:31:06.960
 like it depends on what you happen to have

4:31:06.960 --> 4:31:08.960
 a view as some other thought was occurring

4:31:08.960 --> 4:31:10.960
 to you that overlay and blend

4:31:10.960 --> 4:31:12.960
 into the next key that queries your memory

4:31:12.960 --> 4:31:14.960
 for things and that kind of determines

4:31:14.960 --> 4:31:16.960
 how your chain of consciousness

4:31:16.960 --> 4:31:18.960
 goes so that's kind

4:31:18.960 --> 4:31:20.960
 of the quality of the subjective

4:31:20.960 --> 4:31:22.960
 experience of it is not

4:31:22.960 --> 4:31:24.960
 is not essential for intelligence

4:31:24.960 --> 4:31:26.960
 I don't think so I don't think there's anything really important

4:31:26.960 --> 4:31:28.960
 there what about some other

4:31:28.960 --> 4:31:30.960
 human qualities like fear of mortality

4:31:30.960 --> 4:31:32.960
 and stuff like that like

4:31:32.960 --> 4:31:34.960
 the fact that this ride ends

4:31:34.960 --> 4:31:36.960
 is that

4:31:36.960 --> 4:31:38.960
 important like you

4:31:38.960 --> 4:31:40.960
 talk so much about this conversation

4:31:40.960 --> 4:31:42.960
 about the value of deadlines and constraints

4:31:42.960 --> 4:31:44.960
 do you think that's important

4:31:44.960 --> 4:31:46.960
 for intelligence? That's actually a super

4:31:46.960 --> 4:31:48.960
 interesting angle that I don't usually

4:31:48.960 --> 4:31:50.960
 take on that about has death being

4:31:50.960 --> 4:31:52.960
 a deadline that forces you to make better decisions

4:31:52.960 --> 4:31:54.960
 because I have heard people

4:31:54.960 --> 4:31:56.960
 talk about how if you have immortality

4:31:56.960 --> 4:31:58.960
 people are going to stop trying

4:31:58.960 --> 4:32:00.960
 and working on things because they've got all the time

4:32:00.960 --> 4:32:02.960
 in the world

4:32:02.960 --> 4:32:04.960
 but I would say that

4:32:04.960 --> 4:32:06.960
 I don't expect it to be

4:32:06.960 --> 4:32:08.960
 a super critical thing

4:32:08.960 --> 4:32:10.960
 that a sense of mortality

4:32:10.960 --> 4:32:12.960
 and death impending death is

4:32:12.960 --> 4:32:14.960
 necessary there because those are things that

4:32:14.960 --> 4:32:16.960
 they do wind up providing reward signals

4:32:16.960 --> 4:32:18.960
 to us and we will be in control of the

4:32:18.960 --> 4:32:20.960
 reward signals and there will have

4:32:20.960 --> 4:32:22.960
 to be something fundamental that causes

4:32:22.960 --> 4:32:24.960
 that engenders curiosity and goal

4:32:24.960 --> 4:32:26.960
 setting and all of that

4:32:26.960 --> 4:32:28.960
 something is going to play in there

4:32:28.960 --> 4:32:30.960
 at the reward level

4:32:30.960 --> 4:32:32.960
 whether it's positive or negative

4:32:32.960 --> 4:32:34.960
 or both. I don't

4:32:34.960 --> 4:32:36.960
 have any strong opinions

4:32:36.960 --> 4:32:38.960
 on exactly what it's going to be

4:32:38.960 --> 4:32:40.960
 but that's that type of thing

4:32:40.960 --> 4:32:42.960
 where I doubt

4:32:42.960 --> 4:32:44.960
 that might be one of those half dozen key

4:32:44.960 --> 4:32:46.960
 things that has to be sorted out on exactly

4:32:46.960 --> 4:32:48.960
 what the master reward

4:32:48.960 --> 4:32:50.960
 that's the meta reward overall of the

4:32:50.960 --> 4:32:52.960
 local task specific rewards

4:32:52.960 --> 4:32:54.960
 have to be. That could be that big

4:32:54.960 --> 4:32:56.960
 negative reward of death

4:32:56.960 --> 4:32:58.960
 maybe not death but ability

4:32:58.960 --> 4:33:00.960
 to walk away from an interaction

4:33:00.960 --> 4:33:02.960
 so it bothers me

4:33:02.960 --> 4:33:04.960
 when people treat AI systems like

4:33:04.960 --> 4:33:06.960
 servants so

4:33:06.960 --> 4:33:08.960
 it doesn't bother me but I mean

4:33:08.960 --> 4:33:10.960
 it really is drawing

4:33:10.960 --> 4:33:12.960
 the line

4:33:12.960 --> 4:33:14.960
 between what an AI system could be

4:33:14.960 --> 4:33:16.960
 it's limiting the possibility what an AI system

4:33:16.960 --> 4:33:18.960
 could be is treating them as justice tools

4:33:18.960 --> 4:33:20.960
 now that's of course

4:33:20.960 --> 4:33:22.960
 from a narrow AI perspective

4:33:22.960 --> 4:33:24.960
 there's so many

4:33:24.960 --> 4:33:26.960
 problems that narrow AI

4:33:26.960 --> 4:33:28.960
 I could solve just like you said

4:33:28.960 --> 4:33:30.960
 as

4:33:30.960 --> 4:33:32.960
 in its form of a tool

4:33:32.960 --> 4:33:34.960
 but it could also be

4:33:34.960 --> 4:33:36.960
 a being

4:33:36.960 --> 4:33:38.960
 which is much more than a tool and

4:33:38.960 --> 4:33:40.960
 to become a being

4:33:40.960 --> 4:33:42.960
 you have to respect that thing for being

4:33:42.960 --> 4:33:44.960
 a being and for that

4:33:44.960 --> 4:33:46.960
 it has to be able to have

4:33:46.960 --> 4:33:48.960
 to make its own

4:33:48.960 --> 4:33:50.960
 decisions to walk away to say

4:33:50.960 --> 4:33:52.960
 I had enough of you I would like to break up

4:33:52.960 --> 4:33:54.960
 with you now

4:33:54.960 --> 4:33:56.960
 not treated me well and I would like to

4:33:56.960 --> 4:33:58.960
 move on so

4:33:58.960 --> 4:34:00.960
 I think that actually

4:34:00.960 --> 4:34:02.960
 that choice

4:34:02.960 --> 4:34:04.960
 to end things

4:34:04.960 --> 4:34:06.960
 so I have

4:34:06.960 --> 4:34:08.960
 a couple of things on that so on the one hand

4:34:08.960 --> 4:34:10.960
 it is kind of disturbing when you see

4:34:10.960 --> 4:34:12.960
 people being like people that are mean to

4:34:12.960 --> 4:34:14.960
 robots and you know mean to Alexa

4:34:14.960 --> 4:34:16.960
 whatever and that seems

4:34:16.960 --> 4:34:18.960
 to speak badly about humanity

4:34:18.960 --> 4:34:20.960
 but there's also the exact opposite

4:34:20.960 --> 4:34:22.960
 side of that where you have so many people that

4:34:22.960 --> 4:34:24.960
 imbue humanity in

4:34:24.960 --> 4:34:26.960
 inanimate objects or things that are toys

4:34:26.960 --> 4:34:28.960
 or that are relatively limited

4:34:28.960 --> 4:34:30.960
 so I think there may even be

4:34:30.960 --> 4:34:32.960
 more danger about people putting more

4:34:32.960 --> 4:34:34.960
 emotional investment into a lot of these

4:34:34.960 --> 4:34:36.960
 proto AIs in different ways

4:34:36.960 --> 4:34:38.960
 and then the

4:34:38.960 --> 4:34:40.960
 AI would manipulate that

4:34:40.960 --> 4:34:42.960
 but as far as like the AI

4:34:42.960 --> 4:34:44.960
 ethnic sides of things

4:34:44.960 --> 4:34:46.960
 I really stay away

4:34:46.960 --> 4:34:48.960
 from any of those discussions or even

4:34:48.960 --> 4:34:50.960
 really thinking about it it's

4:34:50.960 --> 4:34:52.960
 similar with the safety things where I think

4:34:52.960 --> 4:34:54.960
 it's just premature and there's a certain

4:34:54.960 --> 4:34:56.960
 class of people that enjoy

4:34:56.960 --> 4:34:58.960
 thinking about impractical things

4:34:58.960 --> 4:35:00.960
 things are not in the world

4:35:00.960 --> 4:35:02.960
 you know of pragmatic effect around

4:35:02.960 --> 4:35:04.960
 you and I think that

4:35:04.960 --> 4:35:06.960
 again because I don't think

4:35:06.960 --> 4:35:08.960
 there's going to be a fast takeoff I think we actually

4:35:08.960 --> 4:35:10.960
 will have time to have these debates

4:35:10.960 --> 4:35:12.960
 when we know the shape of what we're debating

4:35:12.960 --> 4:35:14.960
 and some people do take a

4:35:14.960 --> 4:35:16.960
 principled approach that they think it's going to go too

4:35:16.960 --> 4:35:18.960
 fast that you really do need to get ahead of it

4:35:18.960 --> 4:35:20.960
 that you need to be thinking about this because

4:35:20.960 --> 4:35:22.960
 we have slow processes of coming

4:35:22.960 --> 4:35:24.960
 to any kind of consensus or even coming

4:35:24.960 --> 4:35:26.960
 up with ideas about this

4:35:26.960 --> 4:35:28.960
 and maybe that's

4:35:28.960 --> 4:35:30.960
 maybe that's true

4:35:30.960 --> 4:35:32.960
 I wouldn't put any of my money or funding

4:35:32.960 --> 4:35:34.960
 into something like that because

4:35:34.960 --> 4:35:36.960
 I don't think it's a problem yet

4:35:36.960 --> 4:35:38.960
 and I think that we will have these signs

4:35:38.960 --> 4:35:40.960
 of life when we've got our learning

4:35:40.960 --> 4:35:42.960
 disabled toddler we should really start

4:35:42.960 --> 4:35:44.960
 talking about some of the safety and ethics

4:35:44.960 --> 4:35:46.960
 issues but probably not before

4:35:46.960 --> 4:35:48.960
 then can you elaborate

4:35:48.960 --> 4:35:50.960
 briefly about why you don't think there'll

4:35:50.960 --> 4:35:52.960
 be a fast takeoff is there

4:35:52.960 --> 4:35:54.960
 some deep intuition you have about it

4:35:54.960 --> 4:35:56.960
 does it because it's grounded in the physical

4:35:56.960 --> 4:35:58.960
 world or why yeah so

4:35:58.960 --> 4:36:00.960
 it is my belief that we're going to start

4:36:00.960 --> 4:36:02.960
 off with something that requires thousands

4:36:02.960 --> 4:36:04.960
 of GPUs and

4:36:04.960 --> 4:36:06.960
 I don't know if you've tried to go get

4:36:06.960 --> 4:36:08.960
 a thousand GPU instance on a cloud

4:36:08.960 --> 4:36:10.960
 anytime recently but these are not

4:36:10.960 --> 4:36:12.960
 things that you can just go spin up

4:36:12.960 --> 4:36:14.960
 hundreds of I

4:36:14.960 --> 4:36:16.960
 there are real challenges to

4:36:16.960 --> 4:36:18.960
 I mean these things are going to take data centers

4:36:18.960 --> 4:36:20.960
 and data centers take years to build

4:36:20.960 --> 4:36:22.960
 you know and the last few years

4:36:22.960 --> 4:36:24.960
 we've seen a few of them kind of coming up

4:36:24.960 --> 4:36:26.960
 going in different places they're big engineering

4:36:26.960 --> 4:36:28.960
 efforts you can hear people

4:36:28.960 --> 4:36:30.960
 bemoan about the fact that I

4:36:30.960 --> 4:36:32.960
 know that the network was wired

4:36:32.960 --> 4:36:34.960
 all wrong and it took them a month to go

4:36:34.960 --> 4:36:36.960
 unwire it and rewire it the right way

4:36:36.960 --> 4:36:38.960
 these aren't things that you can just magic

4:36:38.960 --> 4:36:40.960
 into existence and

4:36:40.960 --> 4:36:42.960
 the ideas of I am like the old

4:36:42.960 --> 4:36:44.960
 tropes about it's going to escape on the internet

4:36:44.960 --> 4:36:46.960
 and take over other systems

4:36:46.960 --> 4:36:48.960
 there's the fast takeoff ones are clearly

4:36:48.960 --> 4:36:50.960
 nonsense because you just can't open TCP

4:36:50.960 --> 4:36:52.960
 connections above a certain rate no matter

4:36:52.960 --> 4:36:54.960
 how smart you are even if you have perfect

4:36:54.960 --> 4:36:56.960
 hacking ability that take over the world

4:36:56.960 --> 4:36:58.960
 in an instant sort of thing just

4:36:58.960 --> 4:37:00.960
 isn't plausible at all and

4:37:00.960 --> 4:37:02.960
 even if you had access to all of the resources

4:37:02.960 --> 4:37:04.960
 these are going to be

4:37:04.960 --> 4:37:06.960
 specialized systems where

4:37:06.960 --> 4:37:08.960
 you're going to wind up with something that is architected

4:37:08.960 --> 4:37:10.960
 around exactly

4:37:10.960 --> 4:37:12.960
 this chip with this interconnect

4:37:12.960 --> 4:37:14.960
 and it's not just going to be able to be

4:37:14.960 --> 4:37:16.960
 plopped somewhere else now interestingly

4:37:16.960 --> 4:37:18.960
 it is going to be something that the entire

4:37:18.960 --> 4:37:20.960
 the entire

4:37:20.960 --> 4:37:22.960
 code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive

4:37:22.960 --> 4:37:24.960
 that's total spy movie

4:37:24.960 --> 4:37:26.960
 thriller sorts of things where

4:37:26.960 --> 4:37:28.960
 you could have hey we crack the secret AGI

4:37:28.960 --> 4:37:30.960
 and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone

4:37:30.960 --> 4:37:32.960
 could steal it now they're still going to have to build

4:37:32.960 --> 4:37:34.960
 the right data center to deploy it

4:37:34.960 --> 4:37:36.960
 and have the right kind of life experience

4:37:36.960 --> 4:37:38.960
 curriculum to take it up to the point

4:37:38.960 --> 4:37:40.960
 where it's valuable but the real core of it

4:37:40.960 --> 4:37:42.960
 the magic that's going to happen there

4:37:42.960 --> 4:37:44.960
 is going to be very small

4:37:44.960 --> 4:37:46.960
 you know it's again tens of thousands of lines

4:37:46.960 --> 4:37:48.960
 of code not millions of lines of code

4:37:48.960 --> 4:37:50.960
 it is possible to imagine a world

4:37:50.960 --> 4:37:52.960
 as you mentioned this spy thriller

4:37:52.960 --> 4:37:54.960
 view if it's

4:37:54.960 --> 4:37:56.960
 if it's just a few lines of code

4:37:58.960 --> 4:38:00.960
 we can imagine a world where the surface

4:38:00.960 --> 4:38:02.960
 of computation is growing maybe growing

4:38:02.960 --> 4:38:04.960
 exponentially meaning

4:38:04.960 --> 4:38:06.960
 there's you know the

4:38:06.960 --> 4:38:08.960
 refrigerators start getting a GPU

4:38:08.960 --> 4:38:10.960
 and

4:38:10.960 --> 4:38:12.960
 just every first all

4:38:12.960 --> 4:38:14.960
 the smartphones the billions of smartphones

4:38:14.960 --> 4:38:16.960
 but maybe if

4:38:16.960 --> 4:38:18.960
 there become

4:38:18.960 --> 4:38:20.960
 highways through

4:38:20.960 --> 4:38:22.960
 which code can spread across the

4:38:22.960 --> 4:38:24.960
 entirety of the computation surface

4:38:24.960 --> 4:38:26.960
 then you don't

4:38:26.960 --> 4:38:28.960
 any longer have to book

4:38:28.960 --> 4:38:30.960
 AWS

4:38:30.960 --> 4:38:32.960
 GPU real fundamental

4:38:32.960 --> 4:38:34.960
 issues there when you start getting down to

4:38:34.960 --> 4:38:36.960
 taking an actual problem

4:38:36.960 --> 4:38:38.960
 and putting it on an abstract machine like that

4:38:38.960 --> 4:38:40.960
 that has not worked out well

4:38:40.960 --> 4:38:42.960
 in practice and the idea

4:38:42.960 --> 4:38:44.960
 that there was always

4:38:44.960 --> 4:38:46.960
 like it's always been easy to come up with ways

4:38:46.960 --> 4:38:48.960
 to get compute faster

4:38:48.960 --> 4:38:50.960
 say more flops or more

4:38:50.960 --> 4:38:52.960
 giga ops or whatever there that's usually

4:38:52.960 --> 4:38:54.960
 the easy part but you then

4:38:54.960 --> 4:38:56.960
 have interconnect and then memory

4:38:56.960 --> 4:38:58.960
 for what goes into it and

4:38:58.960 --> 4:39:00.960
 when you talk about saying well cell phones

4:39:00.960 --> 4:39:02.960
 well you're limited to like a 5G connection

4:39:02.960 --> 4:39:04.960
 or something on that and

4:39:04.960 --> 4:39:06.960
 if you say how if you take

4:39:06.960 --> 4:39:08.960
 your your calculation you factor

4:39:08.960 --> 4:39:10.960
 it across a million

4:39:10.960 --> 4:39:12.960
 cell phones instead of

4:39:12.960 --> 4:39:14.960
 a thousand GPUs in a warehouse

4:39:14.960 --> 4:39:16.960
 you might be able to have some kind of a substrate

4:39:16.960 --> 4:39:18.960
 like that but it could be operating

4:39:18.960 --> 4:39:20.960
 then at

4:39:20.960 --> 4:39:22.960
 one thousandth the speed and so yes

4:39:22.960 --> 4:39:24.960
 you could get you could have an AGI working there

4:39:24.960 --> 4:39:26.960
 but it wouldn't be a real time AGI it would be

4:39:26.960 --> 4:39:28.960
 something that is operating at

4:39:28.960 --> 4:39:30.960
 really a snail's pace

4:39:30.960 --> 4:39:32.960
 much much slower than

4:39:32.960 --> 4:39:34.960
 kind of human level thought for things

4:39:34.960 --> 4:39:36.960
 I'm not worried about that problem

4:39:36.960 --> 4:39:38.960
 you're transferring the problem into the

4:39:38.960 --> 4:39:40.960
 interconnect the communication

4:39:40.960 --> 4:39:42.960
 the shared memory

4:39:42.960 --> 4:39:44.960
 the collective intelligence aspect of it

4:39:44.960 --> 4:39:46.960
 which is extremely difficult as well

4:39:46.960 --> 4:39:48.960
 I mean it's back to the very earliest days of

4:39:48.960 --> 4:39:50.960
 supercomputers you still have the

4:39:50.960 --> 4:39:52.960
 the balance between bandwidth

4:39:52.960 --> 4:39:54.960
 storage and computation

4:39:54.960 --> 4:39:56.960
 and sometimes they're easier to get one or the other

4:39:56.960 --> 4:39:58.960
 but it's been remarkably constant

4:39:58.960 --> 4:40:00.960
 across all those years that

4:40:00.960 --> 4:40:02.960
 you still need all three

4:40:02.960 --> 4:40:04.960
 what do your efforts

4:40:04.960 --> 4:40:06.960
 now you mentioned

4:40:06.960 --> 4:40:08.960
 to me that you're really

4:40:08.960 --> 4:40:10.960
 committing to AGI at this

4:40:10.960 --> 4:40:12.960
 stage what what do you see your life

4:40:12.960 --> 4:40:14.960
 in the next few months years look like

4:40:14.960 --> 4:40:16.960
 what what do you hope to achieve

4:40:16.960 --> 4:40:18.960
 achieve here so

4:40:18.960 --> 4:40:20.960
 I literally just this

4:40:20.960 --> 4:40:22.960
 week signed a term sheet to

4:40:22.960 --> 4:40:24.960
 to take some investment money for my company

4:40:24.960 --> 4:40:26.960
 where the last two years

4:40:26.960 --> 4:40:28.960
 I had backed off from

4:40:28.960 --> 4:40:30.960
 META and I was still doing my consulting

4:40:30.960 --> 4:40:32.960
 CTO role there but

4:40:32.960 --> 4:40:34.960
 I had styled it as I was going to take

4:40:34.960 --> 4:40:36.960
 the Victorian gentleman scientist

4:40:36.960 --> 4:40:38.960
 route where I was going to be

4:40:38.960 --> 4:40:40.960
 the you know the wealthy person that

4:40:40.960 --> 4:40:42.960
 was going to go pursue science and learn

4:40:42.960 --> 4:40:44.960
 about this and do experiments

4:40:44.960 --> 4:40:46.960
 and honestly I'm surprised there aren't more

4:40:46.960 --> 4:40:48.960
 people like that that are

4:40:48.960 --> 4:40:50.960
 like me technical people that

4:40:50.960 --> 4:40:52.960
 made a bunch of money and are interested

4:40:52.960 --> 4:40:54.960
 in some of these possibly the

4:40:54.960 --> 4:40:56.960
 biggest leverage point in human history

4:40:56.960 --> 4:40:58.960
 I mean I know of I've heard of

4:40:58.960 --> 4:41:00.960
 a couple organizations that

4:41:00.960 --> 4:41:02.960
 are basically led by one rich techie guy

4:41:02.960 --> 4:41:04.960
 that gets a few people around

4:41:04.960 --> 4:41:06.960
 him to try to work on this

4:41:06.960 --> 4:41:08.960
 but I'm surprised that there's not more that there aren't

4:41:08.960 --> 4:41:10.960
 like a dozen of them

4:41:10.960 --> 4:41:12.960
 I mean maybe people are still

4:41:12.960 --> 4:41:14.960
 think that it's an unapproachable problem

4:41:14.960 --> 4:41:16.960
 that it's kind of beyond their ability to

4:41:16.960 --> 4:41:18.960
 to get a wrench on and have some effect on

4:41:18.960 --> 4:41:20.960
 like whatever startups they've run before

4:41:20.960 --> 4:41:22.960
 but I that was

4:41:22.960 --> 4:41:24.960
 my kind of like with all the

4:41:24.960 --> 4:41:26.960
 stuff I've learned whether it's gaming

4:41:26.960 --> 4:41:28.960
 aerospace whatever I I go

4:41:28.960 --> 4:41:30.960
 through a larval phase where I'm like okay

4:41:30.960 --> 4:41:32.960
 I'm sucking up all of this information

4:41:32.960 --> 4:41:34.960
 trying to see is this something

4:41:34.960 --> 4:41:36.960
 that I can actually do is this

4:41:36.960 --> 4:41:38.960
 something that's practical to

4:41:38.960 --> 4:41:40.960
 devote a large chunk of my life to

4:41:40.960 --> 4:41:42.960
 and I've gone through that with

4:41:42.960 --> 4:41:44.960
 the with the AI machine learning

4:41:44.960 --> 4:41:46.960
 space of things and

4:41:46.960 --> 4:41:48.960
 and I think I've got my arms

4:41:48.960 --> 4:41:50.960
 around it I've got the measure of it where

4:41:50.960 --> 4:41:52.960
 some of the most brilliant people in the

4:41:52.960 --> 4:41:54.960
 world are working on this problem but

4:41:54.960 --> 4:41:56.960
 nobody knows exactly the path

4:41:56.960 --> 4:41:58.960
 that it's going on we're throwing a lot

4:41:58.960 --> 4:42:00.960
 of things at the wall and seeing what sticks

4:42:00.960 --> 4:42:02.960
 I but I have

4:42:02.960 --> 4:42:04.960
 I you know another interesting thing

4:42:04.960 --> 4:42:06.960
 just learning about all of this the

4:42:06.960 --> 4:42:08.960
 contingency of your path to knowledge and

4:42:08.960 --> 4:42:10.960
 talking about the associations and the context

4:42:10.960 --> 4:42:12.960
 that you have with them where

4:42:12.960 --> 4:42:14.960
 people that learn in the same path

4:42:14.960 --> 4:42:16.960
 will have similar thought processes

4:42:16.960 --> 4:42:18.960
 and I think it's useful that I come

4:42:18.960 --> 4:42:20.960
 at this from a different background

4:42:20.960 --> 4:42:22.960
 different history than the people

4:42:22.960 --> 4:42:24.960
 that have had the largely academic backgrounds

4:42:24.960 --> 4:42:26.960
 for this where I have

4:42:26.960 --> 4:42:28.960
 huge blind spots that they could easily

4:42:28.960 --> 4:42:30.960
 point out but I have

4:42:30.960 --> 4:42:32.960
 a different set of experiences in

4:42:32.960 --> 4:42:34.960
 history and approaches to problems and systems

4:42:34.960 --> 4:42:36.960
 engineering that

4:42:36.960 --> 4:42:38.960
 you know that might turn out to be

4:42:38.960 --> 4:42:40.960
 useful and I can afford to take that

4:42:40.960 --> 4:42:42.960
 bet where I'm not

4:42:42.960 --> 4:42:44.960
 going to be destitute I am I was

4:42:44.960 --> 4:42:46.960
 you know I've been I have enough money to fund

4:42:46.960 --> 4:42:48.960
 myself working on this for the rest

4:42:48.960 --> 4:42:50.960
 of my life but what I was finding

4:42:50.960 --> 4:42:52.960
 is that I was

4:42:52.960 --> 4:42:54.960
 I was still

4:42:54.960 --> 4:42:56.960
 not committing where I had a foot

4:42:56.960 --> 4:42:58.960
 firmly in the VR and met a side of things

4:42:58.960 --> 4:43:00.960
 where in theory I've got

4:43:00.960 --> 4:43:02.960
 I've got a very nice position there I only

4:43:02.960 --> 4:43:04.960
 have to work one day a week for my

4:43:04.960 --> 4:43:06.960
 my consulting role but

4:43:06.960 --> 4:43:08.960
 but I was engaging every day I'd still

4:43:08.960 --> 4:43:10.960
 be like my computers there I'd be going

4:43:10.960 --> 4:43:12.960
 and checking the workplace and notes and

4:43:12.960 --> 4:43:14.960
 testing different things and communicating with people

4:43:14.960 --> 4:43:16.960
 but

4:43:16.960 --> 4:43:18.960
 but I did make the the decision recently

4:43:18.960 --> 4:43:20.960
 that no I'm going to get serious

4:43:20.960 --> 4:43:22.960
 I'm still going to keep my ties

4:43:22.960 --> 4:43:24.960
 with meta but I am

4:43:24.960 --> 4:43:26.960
 seriously going for the AGI

4:43:26.960 --> 4:43:28.960
 side of things and it's actually

4:43:28.960 --> 4:43:30.960
 a really interesting point because a lot of

4:43:30.960 --> 4:43:32.960
 the machine learning the AI

4:43:32.960 --> 4:43:34.960
 community is quite large but

4:43:34.960 --> 4:43:36.960
 really

4:43:36.960 --> 4:43:38.960
 basically almost everybody has taken the same

4:43:38.960 --> 4:43:40.960
 trajectory through life

4:43:40.960 --> 4:43:42.960
 in that community and it's so

4:43:42.960 --> 4:43:44.960
 interesting to have somebody like you

4:43:44.960 --> 4:43:46.960
 with a fundamentally different trajectory

4:43:46.960 --> 4:43:48.960
 and that's where the big solutions can

4:43:48.960 --> 4:43:50.960
 come because there is a kind of silo

4:43:50.960 --> 4:43:52.960
 and it's it is a

4:43:52.960 --> 4:43:54.960
 bunch of people kind of following the same kind

4:43:54.960 --> 4:43:56.960
 of set of ideas and I was really worried

4:43:56.960 --> 4:43:58.960
 that I didn't want to come

4:43:58.960 --> 4:44:00.960
 off as you know like an arrogant

4:44:00.960 --> 4:44:02.960
 outsider for things where I have

4:44:02.960 --> 4:44:04.960
 all the respect in the world for the work

4:44:04.960 --> 4:44:06.960
 that's you know it's been a miracle decade

4:44:06.960 --> 4:44:08.960
 we're in the midst of a scientific revolution

4:44:08.960 --> 4:44:10.960
 happening now and everybody doing

4:44:10.960 --> 4:44:12.960
 this is I you know these are

4:44:12.960 --> 4:44:14.960
 the the Einstein's and Bors and whatever

4:44:14.960 --> 4:44:16.960
 is of our modern era

4:44:16.960 --> 4:44:18.960
 I am and I was really happy to see

4:44:18.960 --> 4:44:20.960
 that the the people that I sat down and

4:44:20.960 --> 4:44:22.960
 talked with everybody does seem to really

4:44:22.960 --> 4:44:24.960
 be quite great about just happy

4:44:24.960 --> 4:44:26.960
 to talk about things willing to acknowledge

4:44:26.960 --> 4:44:28.960
 that we don't know what we're doing we're

4:44:28.960 --> 4:44:30.960
 figuring it out as we go along

4:44:30.960 --> 4:44:32.960
 and I mean I've got a you know a huge

4:44:32.960 --> 4:44:34.960
 I debt on this where

4:44:34.960 --> 4:44:36.960
 this all really started for me because

4:44:36.960 --> 4:44:38.960
 Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open

4:44:38.960 --> 4:44:40.960
 AI and it was at

4:44:40.960 --> 4:44:42.960
 a point when I didn't know anything about

4:44:42.960 --> 4:44:44.960
 what was really going on in

4:44:44.960 --> 4:44:46.960
 machine learning and in fact it's funny

4:44:46.960 --> 4:44:48.960
 how the first time you reached out to me

4:44:48.960 --> 4:44:50.960
 it's like four years ago for your AI

4:44:50.960 --> 4:44:52.960
 podcast for people

4:44:52.960 --> 4:44:54.960
 yeah for people

4:44:54.960 --> 4:44:56.960
 who are

4:44:56.960 --> 4:44:58.960
 listening to this should know that

4:44:58.960 --> 4:45:00.960
 first of all obviously

4:45:00.960 --> 4:45:02.960
 I've been a huge fan of yours for the longest

4:45:02.960 --> 4:45:04.960
 time but we've agreed to talk like yeah

4:45:04.960 --> 4:45:06.960
 like four years ago back when this

4:45:06.960 --> 4:45:08.960
 was called the artificial intelligence podcast

4:45:08.960 --> 4:45:10.960
 we wanted to

4:45:10.960 --> 4:45:12.960
 do a thing and you said yes

4:45:12.960 --> 4:45:14.960
 and I said it's like I don't know anything about

4:45:14.960 --> 4:45:16.960
 modern AI I said I could kind of take

4:45:16.960 --> 4:45:18.960
 an angle on machine perception because

4:45:18.960 --> 4:45:20.960
 you know I'm doing a lot of that with the

4:45:20.960 --> 4:45:22.960
 sensors and the virtual reality but

4:45:22.960 --> 4:45:24.960
 we could probably find something to talk about

4:45:24.960 --> 4:45:26.960
 and that's where

4:45:26.960 --> 4:45:28.960
 when did Sam talk to you about open AI

4:45:28.960 --> 4:45:30.960
 around the same time?

4:45:30.960 --> 4:45:32.960
 It was a bit after that so

4:45:32.960 --> 4:45:34.960
 I had done the most basic work

4:45:34.960 --> 4:45:36.960
 I had kind of done the neural

4:45:36.960 --> 4:45:38.960
 networks from scratch where I'd gone

4:45:38.960 --> 4:45:40.960
 and written it all in C just to make sure I

4:45:40.960 --> 4:45:42.960
 understood back propagation at the

4:45:42.960 --> 4:45:44.960
 lowest level and my nuts and bolts

4:45:44.960 --> 4:45:46.960
 approach but after

4:45:46.960 --> 4:45:48.960
 Sam approached me

4:45:48.960 --> 4:45:50.960
 I was flattering to think that

4:45:50.960 --> 4:45:52.960
 he thought that I could be useful at

4:45:52.960 --> 4:45:54.960
 open AI largely for

4:45:54.960 --> 4:45:56.960
 systems optimization

4:45:56.960 --> 4:45:58.960
 sorts of things without

4:45:58.960 --> 4:46:00.960
 being an expert but

4:46:00.960 --> 4:46:02.960
 I asked Ilya Sutskover

4:46:02.960 --> 4:46:04.960
 to give me a reading list and he gave

4:46:04.960 --> 4:46:06.960
 me a

4:46:06.960 --> 4:46:08.960
 binder full of all the papers that

4:46:08.960 --> 4:46:10.960
 okay these are the important things

4:46:10.960 --> 4:46:12.960
 if you really read and understand all of these

4:46:12.960 --> 4:46:14.960
 you'll know like 80% of what most of the

4:46:14.960 --> 4:46:16.960
 machine language researchers

4:46:16.960 --> 4:46:18.960
 work on and I went through and I read

4:46:18.960 --> 4:46:20.960
 all those papers multiple times and highlighted

4:46:20.960 --> 4:46:22.960
 them and went through and kind of

4:46:22.960 --> 4:46:24.960
 figured the things out there and then

4:46:24.960 --> 4:46:26.960
 started branching out into my own

4:46:26.960 --> 4:46:28.960
 sets of research on things and

4:46:28.960 --> 4:46:30.960
 actually started writing my own experiments

4:46:30.960 --> 4:46:32.960
 and doing kind of figuring out

4:46:32.960 --> 4:46:34.960
 finding out what I don't know

4:46:34.960 --> 4:46:36.960
 what the limits of my knowledge are

4:46:36.960 --> 4:46:38.960
 and starting to get some of my angles of attack

4:46:38.960 --> 4:46:40.960
 on things the things that I think are a little

4:46:40.960 --> 4:46:42.960
 bit different from what

4:46:42.960 --> 4:46:44.960
 people are doing and

4:46:44.960 --> 4:46:46.960
 I've had a couple years now

4:46:46.960 --> 4:46:48.960
 like two years since I kind of

4:46:48.960 --> 4:46:50.960
 left the full time position at meta

4:46:50.960 --> 4:46:52.960
 and now I've

4:46:52.960 --> 4:46:54.960
 kind of pulled the trigger and said

4:46:54.960 --> 4:46:56.960
 I'm going to get serious about it but

4:46:56.960 --> 4:46:58.960
 some of my lessons all the way back to Armadillo

4:46:58.960 --> 4:47:00.960
 space about how I know I need

4:47:00.960 --> 4:47:02.960
 to be more committed to this where

4:47:02.960 --> 4:47:04.960
 there is that

4:47:04.960 --> 4:47:06.960
 it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways

4:47:06.960 --> 4:47:08.960
 when you know that you're wealthy enough to say

4:47:08.960 --> 4:47:10.960
 it's like this doesn't really mean anything

4:47:10.960 --> 4:47:12.960
 I can spend

4:47:12.960 --> 4:47:14.960
 a million dollars a year for the rest

4:47:14.960 --> 4:47:16.960
 of my life and it doesn't

4:47:16.960 --> 4:47:18.960
 mean anything it's fine

4:47:18.960 --> 4:47:20.960
 but that is an opportunity

4:47:20.960 --> 4:47:22.960
 to just kind of meander

4:47:22.960 --> 4:47:24.960
 and I could see that in myself when

4:47:24.960 --> 4:47:26.960
 I'm doing some things it's like oh this is a kind of

4:47:26.960 --> 4:47:28.960
 interesting curious thing

4:47:28.960 --> 4:47:30.960
 let's look at this for a little while let's look at that

4:47:30.960 --> 4:47:32.960
 it's not really bearing down on the

4:47:32.960 --> 4:47:34.960
 problem so

4:47:34.960 --> 4:47:36.960
 there's a few things that

4:47:36.960 --> 4:47:38.960
 that I've done that are kind of tactics

4:47:38.960 --> 4:47:40.960
 for myself to make me more effective like

4:47:40.960 --> 4:47:42.960
 one thing I noticed I was not

4:47:42.960 --> 4:47:44.960
 doing well is I had

4:47:44.960 --> 4:47:46.960
 a Google cloud account with to get

4:47:46.960 --> 4:47:48.960
 GPUs there and I was finding I was very

4:47:48.960 --> 4:47:50.960
 rarely doing that for no good

4:47:50.960 --> 4:47:52.960
 psychological reasons where I'm like oh

4:47:52.960 --> 4:47:54.960
 I can always think of something to do other than to

4:47:54.960 --> 4:47:56.960
 set up instances and run an experiment

4:47:56.960 --> 4:47:58.960
 I can you know keep working on my local

4:47:58.960 --> 4:48:00.960
 Titans or something

4:48:00.960 --> 4:48:02.960
 but it was really stupid I mean it was not

4:48:02.960 --> 4:48:04.960
 a lot of money I should have been running more

4:48:04.960 --> 4:48:06.960
 experiments there so I thought to myself

4:48:06.960 --> 4:48:08.960
 well I'm gonna go buy

4:48:08.960 --> 4:48:10.960
 a quarter million dollar DGX station

4:48:10.960 --> 4:48:12.960
 I'm gonna just like sit it right there and it's gonna

4:48:12.960 --> 4:48:14.960
 mock me if I'm not using it if the fans

4:48:14.960 --> 4:48:16.960
 aren't running on that thing I'm not

4:48:16.960 --> 4:48:18.960
 properly utilizing it

4:48:18.960 --> 4:48:20.960
 and that's been helpful you know I've done a lot

4:48:20.960 --> 4:48:22.960
 more experiments since then it's been

4:48:22.960 --> 4:48:24.960
 interesting where I thought I'd be doing all

4:48:24.960 --> 4:48:26.960
 this low level in the link optimize

4:48:26.960 --> 4:48:28.960
 stuff but 90% of what I do is just spin up

4:48:28.960 --> 4:48:30.960
 four instances of an experiment with different

4:48:30.960 --> 4:48:32.960
 hyper parameters on it

4:48:32.960 --> 4:48:34.960
 you're doing

4:48:34.960 --> 4:48:36.960
 like really sort of building up intuition

4:48:36.960 --> 4:48:38.960
 by doing ML experiments of different kinds

4:48:38.960 --> 4:48:40.960
 but so

4:48:40.960 --> 4:48:42.960
 the next big thing though is

4:48:42.960 --> 4:48:44.960
 I am you know I decided

4:48:44.960 --> 4:48:46.960
 that I was gonna take some take some investor

4:48:46.960 --> 4:48:48.960
 money because I

4:48:48.960 --> 4:48:50.960
 have an overactive sense of responsibility

4:48:50.960 --> 4:48:52.960
 about other people's money

4:48:52.960 --> 4:48:54.960
 I am and it's like

4:48:54.960 --> 4:48:56.960
 I don't want

4:48:56.960 --> 4:48:58.960
 a lot of my push and my

4:48:58.960 --> 4:49:00.960
 passionate in treaties for things that

4:49:00.960 --> 4:49:02.960
 met are it's like I don't want suck to have wasted

4:49:02.960 --> 4:49:04.960
 his money investing in Oculus

4:49:04.960 --> 4:49:06.960
 I want it to work out I want it to change

4:49:06.960 --> 4:49:08.960
 the world I want it to be worth

4:49:08.960 --> 4:49:10.960
 all of this time money and effort

4:49:10.960 --> 4:49:12.960
 going into it and I

4:49:12.960 --> 4:49:14.960
 expect that it's going to be that like

4:49:14.960 --> 4:49:16.960
 that with my company

4:49:16.960 --> 4:49:18.960
 where it's a huge forcing function

4:49:18.960 --> 4:49:20.960
 this investment investors

4:49:20.960 --> 4:49:22.960
 that are going to expect something

4:49:22.960 --> 4:49:24.960
 of me now we've all had the conversation

4:49:24.960 --> 4:49:26.960
 that this is a low probability

4:49:26.960 --> 4:49:28.960
 long term bet it's not something

4:49:28.960 --> 4:49:30.960
 that there's a million things I could do

4:49:30.960 --> 4:49:32.960
 that I would have line of sight on the value

4:49:32.960 --> 4:49:34.960
 proposition for this isn't that I think

4:49:34.960 --> 4:49:36.960
 there are there are unknown unknowns

4:49:36.960 --> 4:49:38.960
 in the way but

4:49:38.960 --> 4:49:40.960
 it's one of these things that it's

4:49:40.960 --> 4:49:42.960
 it's hyper ball but it's potentially

4:49:42.960 --> 4:49:44.960
 one of the most important things humans ever

4:49:44.960 --> 4:49:46.960
 do and it's something that I think is

4:49:46.960 --> 4:49:48.960
 within our lifetimes if not within

4:49:48.960 --> 4:49:50.960
 a decade

4:49:50.960 --> 4:49:52.960
 to happen so

4:49:52.960 --> 4:49:54.960
 yeah this is just now happening

4:49:54.960 --> 4:49:56.960
 like term sheet like the ink is barely

4:49:56.960 --> 4:49:58.960
 virtually barely dry on drying

4:49:58.960 --> 4:50:00.960
 I mean as I mentioned you're all flying

4:50:00.960 --> 4:50:02.960
 like somebody I admire and

4:50:02.960 --> 4:50:04.960
 some of you know Andre Carpathia I think

4:50:04.960 --> 4:50:06.960
 the two of you different trajectories

4:50:06.960 --> 4:50:08.960
 in life but approach problems

4:50:08.960 --> 4:50:10.960
 similarly in that he codes

4:50:10.960 --> 4:50:12.960
 stuff from scratch up all the time

4:50:12.960 --> 4:50:14.960
 and

4:50:14.960 --> 4:50:16.960
 he's created a bunch of little things

4:50:16.960 --> 4:50:18.960
 outside of

4:50:18.960 --> 4:50:20.960
 even outside the course at Stanford

4:50:20.960 --> 4:50:22.960
 that have been tremendously

4:50:22.960 --> 4:50:24.960
 useful to build up intuition

4:50:24.960 --> 4:50:26.960
 about stuff but also to

4:50:26.960 --> 4:50:28.960
 help people and they're all

4:50:28.960 --> 4:50:30.960
 in the realm of AI

4:50:30.960 --> 4:50:32.960
 do you see yourself

4:50:32.960 --> 4:50:34.960
 potentially doing things like this or

4:50:34.960 --> 4:50:36.960
 not necessarily solving a gigantic

4:50:36.960 --> 4:50:38.960
 problem but on the journey on the

4:50:38.960 --> 4:50:40.960
 path to that

4:50:40.960 --> 4:50:42.960
 building up intuitions

4:50:42.960 --> 4:50:44.960
 and

4:50:44.960 --> 4:50:46.960
 sharing code

4:50:46.960 --> 4:50:48.960
 or ideas or systems

4:50:48.960 --> 4:50:50.960
 that

4:50:50.960 --> 4:50:52.960
 give inklings of AGI

4:50:52.960 --> 4:50:54.960
 but also kind of are useful to

4:50:54.960 --> 4:50:56.960
 people in some way so yeah first of all Andre

4:50:56.960 --> 4:50:58.960
 is awesome I learned a lot when I was going

4:50:58.960 --> 4:51:00.960
 through my larval phase from his blog posts

4:51:00.960 --> 4:51:02.960
 and his Stanford course and

4:51:02.960 --> 4:51:04.960
 you know super valuable I got to meet him

4:51:04.960 --> 4:51:06.960
 first a couple years ago when I was

4:51:06.960 --> 4:51:08.960
 first kind of starting off on

4:51:08.960 --> 4:51:10.960
 my gentleman scientist bit

4:51:10.960 --> 4:51:12.960
 and just

4:51:12.960 --> 4:51:14.960
 a couple months ago when he went out on his sabbatical

4:51:14.960 --> 4:51:16.960
 he stopped by in Dallas and we talked

4:51:16.960 --> 4:51:18.960
 for a while and I had

4:51:18.960 --> 4:51:20.960
 a great time with him and then when I heard he actually left

4:51:20.960 --> 4:51:22.960
 Tesla I did of course along with a hundred

4:51:22.960 --> 4:51:24.960
 other people say hey if you

4:51:24.960 --> 4:51:26.960
 ever want to work with me it would

4:51:26.960 --> 4:51:28.960
 be an honor so

4:51:28.960 --> 4:51:30.960
 he thinks that he's going to be doing this educational

4:51:30.960 --> 4:51:32.960
 work but I think someone's going to make him an offer

4:51:32.960 --> 4:51:34.960
 he can't refuse before

4:51:34.960 --> 4:51:36.960
 he gets too far along on it.

4:51:36.960 --> 4:51:38.960
 His current interest is educational

4:51:38.960 --> 4:51:40.960
 so yeah

4:51:40.960 --> 4:51:42.960
 he's a special mind.

4:51:42.960 --> 4:51:44.960
 Is there something you could speak to what makes

4:51:44.960 --> 4:51:46.960
 him so special?

4:51:46.960 --> 4:51:48.960
 He was

4:51:48.960 --> 4:51:50.960
 very much a programmers programmer that was

4:51:50.960 --> 4:51:52.960
 doing machine learning work rather than

4:51:52.960 --> 4:51:54.960
 it's a different feel than

4:51:54.960 --> 4:51:56.960
 an academic where you can see it in

4:51:56.960 --> 4:51:58.960
 paper sometimes where somebody that's

4:51:58.960 --> 4:52:00.960
 really a mathematician or a statistician

4:52:00.960 --> 4:52:02.960
 at heart and they're doing something

4:52:02.960 --> 4:52:04.960
 with machine learning but

4:52:04.960 --> 4:52:06.960
 Andre is about getting something done

4:52:06.960 --> 4:52:08.960
 and you could see it in

4:52:08.960 --> 4:52:10.960
 all of his earliest approaches to

4:52:10.960 --> 4:52:12.960
 here's how reinforcement learning works

4:52:12.960 --> 4:52:14.960
 here's how recurrent neural networks work

4:52:14.960 --> 4:52:16.960
 here's how transformers work

4:52:16.960 --> 4:52:18.960
 here's how crypto works

4:52:18.960 --> 4:52:20.960
 and

4:52:20.960 --> 4:52:22.960
 yeah it's just

4:52:22.960 --> 4:52:24.960
 one of his old posts was like a

4:52:24.960 --> 4:52:26.960
 hacker's guide to machine learning

4:52:26.960 --> 4:52:28.960
 he deprecated that and said don't really pay

4:52:28.960 --> 4:52:30.960
 attention to what's in here but

4:52:30.960 --> 4:52:32.960
 it's that thought that carries through

4:52:32.960 --> 4:52:34.960
 in a lot of it where

4:52:34.960 --> 4:52:36.960
 back again to that hacker mentality

4:52:36.960 --> 4:52:38.960
 and the hacker ethic with what he's doing

4:52:38.960 --> 4:52:40.960
 and sharing all of it.

4:52:40.960 --> 4:52:42.960
 Yeah and a lot of his approach to a new thing

4:52:42.960 --> 4:52:44.960
 like you said larva stage

4:52:44.960 --> 4:52:46.960
 is let me code up

4:52:46.960 --> 4:52:48.960
 the simplest possible thing

4:52:48.960 --> 4:52:50.960
 to build up intuition about it.

4:52:50.960 --> 4:52:52.960
 Yeah like I say I sketch with structs and things

4:52:52.960 --> 4:52:54.960
 when I'm just thinking about a problem

4:52:54.960 --> 4:52:56.960
 I'm thinking in some degree of code.

4:52:56.960 --> 4:52:58.960
 You are

4:52:58.960 --> 4:53:00.960
 also among many things a martial

4:53:00.960 --> 4:53:02.960
 artist both Judo and Jiu Jitsu

4:53:02.960 --> 4:53:04.960
 how has this helped

4:53:04.960 --> 4:53:06.960
 make you the person you are?

4:53:06.960 --> 4:53:08.960
 So I mean I was a competent club player

4:53:08.960 --> 4:53:10.960
 in Judo and grappling

4:53:10.960 --> 4:53:12.960
 I mean I was by no means any kind

4:53:12.960 --> 4:53:14.960
 of a superstar but

4:53:14.960 --> 4:53:16.960
 I went through a few phases with it

4:53:16.960 --> 4:53:18.960
 where I did some

4:53:18.960 --> 4:53:20.960
 when I was quite young a little bit

4:53:20.960 --> 4:53:22.960
 more when I was 17

4:53:22.960 --> 4:53:24.960
 and then I got into it

4:53:24.960 --> 4:53:26.960
 kind of seriously in my mid 30s

4:53:26.960 --> 4:53:28.960
 and I went pretty far with it

4:53:28.960 --> 4:53:30.960
 and I was pretty good

4:53:30.960 --> 4:53:32.960
 at some of the things that I was doing

4:53:32.960 --> 4:53:34.960
 and I did appreciate it quite a bit

4:53:34.960 --> 4:53:36.960
 where

4:53:36.960 --> 4:53:38.960
 on the one hand it's always

4:53:38.960 --> 4:53:40.960
 if you're going to do exercise or something

4:53:40.960 --> 4:53:42.960
 it's a more motivating form of exercise

4:53:42.960 --> 4:53:44.960
 and if someone is crushing you

4:53:44.960 --> 4:53:46.960
 you are motivated

4:53:46.960 --> 4:53:48.960
 to do something about that

4:53:48.960 --> 4:53:50.960
 to up your attributes and be better about

4:53:50.960 --> 4:53:52.960
 getting out of that.

4:53:52.960 --> 4:53:54.960
 But there's also that sense that

4:53:54.960 --> 4:53:56.960
 I was not

4:53:56.960 --> 4:53:58.960
 a sports guy I did do wrestling

4:53:58.960 --> 4:54:00.960
 junior high and I often wish

4:54:00.960 --> 4:54:02.960
 that I think I would have

4:54:02.960 --> 4:54:04.960
 been good for me if I'd carried that on

4:54:04.960 --> 4:54:06.960
 into high school and had a little bit more

4:54:06.960 --> 4:54:08.960
 of that I mean it's like I

4:54:08.960 --> 4:54:10.960
 you know felt a little bit of wrestling

4:54:10.960 --> 4:54:12.960
 vibe with always going on about embracing

4:54:12.960 --> 4:54:14.960
 the grind and like that push that I

4:54:14.960 --> 4:54:16.960
 associate with the wrestling team

4:54:16.960 --> 4:54:18.960
 that I in hindsight

4:54:18.960 --> 4:54:20.960
 I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself

4:54:20.960 --> 4:54:22.960
 that way.

4:54:22.960 --> 4:54:24.960
 But even getting back into Judo and Jiu Jitsu

4:54:24.960 --> 4:54:26.960
 in my mid 30s as usually

4:54:26.960 --> 4:54:28.960
 man on the mat with that

4:54:28.960 --> 4:54:30.960
 there was still the

4:54:30.960 --> 4:54:32.960
 sense that

4:54:32.960 --> 4:54:34.960
 working out with the group

4:54:34.960 --> 4:54:36.960
 and having the guys that

4:54:36.960 --> 4:54:38.960
 you're beating each other up with it

4:54:38.960 --> 4:54:40.960
 but you just feel good

4:54:40.960 --> 4:54:42.960
 coming out of it and I can remember those

4:54:42.960 --> 4:54:44.960
 driving home

4:54:44.960 --> 4:54:46.960
 aching in various ways and just thinking

4:54:46.960 --> 4:54:48.960
 it's like that was really great

4:54:48.960 --> 4:54:50.960
 and

4:54:50.960 --> 4:54:52.960
 it's mixing with a bunch of people that had

4:54:52.960 --> 4:54:54.960
 nothing to do with any of the things that

4:54:54.960 --> 4:54:56.960
 I worked with you know every once in a while

4:54:56.960 --> 4:54:58.960
 someone would be like oh you're the doom guy

4:54:58.960 --> 4:55:00.960
 and I but for the most part

4:55:00.960 --> 4:55:02.960
 it was just different slice of life

4:55:02.960 --> 4:55:04.960
 you know a good thing

4:55:04.960 --> 4:55:06.960
 and I made the call when I was

4:55:06.960 --> 4:55:08.960
 40 that's like maybe I'm getting a little old

4:55:08.960 --> 4:55:10.960
 for this I had separated a rib

4:55:10.960 --> 4:55:12.960
 and tweaked a few things and I got out

4:55:12.960 --> 4:55:14.960
 without any really bad injuries

4:55:14.960 --> 4:55:16.960
 and I was like

4:55:16.960 --> 4:55:18.960
 have I dodged enough bullets should I

4:55:18.960 --> 4:55:20.960
 hang it up I went back

4:55:20.960 --> 4:55:22.960
 I've gone a couple times

4:55:22.960 --> 4:55:24.960
 in the last decade trying to get my kids

4:55:24.960 --> 4:55:26.960
 into it a little bit I didn't really stick

4:55:26.960 --> 4:55:28.960
 with any of them but it was fun to get

4:55:28.960 --> 4:55:30.960
 back on the mats I really

4:55:30.960 --> 4:55:32.960
 hurts for a while when you haven't gone

4:55:32.960 --> 4:55:34.960
 I gone for a while but

4:55:34.960 --> 4:55:36.960
 I still debate this

4:55:36.960 --> 4:55:38.960
 pretty constantly my brother's only a year younger

4:55:38.960 --> 4:55:40.960
 than me and he's going kind of hard in jujitsu

4:55:40.960 --> 4:55:42.960
 right now and I you know he was

4:55:42.960 --> 4:55:44.960
 just he won a few medals at the last

4:55:44.960 --> 4:55:46.960
 tournament he was at competing

4:55:46.960 --> 4:55:48.960
 and I was thinking yeah I guess we're

4:55:48.960 --> 4:55:50.960
 in the executive division if you're over 50

4:55:50.960 --> 4:55:52.960
 or over 45 or something

4:55:52.960 --> 4:55:54.960
 and it's

4:55:54.960 --> 4:55:56.960
 not out of the question that I

4:55:56.960 --> 4:55:58.960
 go back at some point and do some of this

4:55:58.960 --> 4:56:00.960
 but again I'm just reorganizing my life

4:56:00.960 --> 4:56:02.960
 around more focus

4:56:02.960 --> 4:56:04.960
 probably not going to happen I'm pushing

4:56:04.960 --> 4:56:06.960
 my exercise around

4:56:06.960 --> 4:56:08.960
 to give me longer uninterrupted intellectual

4:56:08.960 --> 4:56:10.960
 focus time pushing it to the beginning

4:56:10.960 --> 4:56:12.960
 or the end of the game running and stuff like that

4:56:12.960 --> 4:56:14.960
 walking yeah running

4:56:14.960 --> 4:56:16.960
 and calisthenics and some things like

4:56:16.960 --> 4:56:18.960
 that but it allows you to still think about

4:56:18.960 --> 4:56:20.960
 a problem and but if you're going to a

4:56:20.960 --> 4:56:22.960
 judo club or something you're you've got to

4:56:22.960 --> 4:56:24.960
 fix it's going to be seven o clock or whatever

4:56:24.960 --> 4:56:26.960
 10 o clock on Saturday

4:56:26.960 --> 4:56:28.960
 although I talked about this a little bit

4:56:28.960 --> 4:56:30.960
 when I was on Rogan and shortly after

4:56:30.960 --> 4:56:32.960
 that Carlos Machado did reach out and

4:56:32.960 --> 4:56:34.960
 I had trained with him for years

4:56:34.960 --> 4:56:36.960
 back in the day and he was like hey

4:56:36.960 --> 4:56:38.960
 we've got kind of a small private club

4:56:38.960 --> 4:56:40.960
 with a bunch of executive type

4:56:40.960 --> 4:56:42.960
 people and

4:56:42.960 --> 4:56:44.960
 it gets it does tempt me

4:56:44.960 --> 4:56:46.960
 yeah I don't know if you know him but

4:56:46.960 --> 4:56:48.960
 John Donahar

4:56:48.960 --> 4:56:50.960
 here at Austin

4:56:50.960 --> 4:56:52.960
 with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks and

4:56:52.960 --> 4:56:54.960
 he has a very interesting way

4:56:54.960 --> 4:56:56.960
 very deep systematic way of thinking

4:56:56.960 --> 4:56:58.960
 about jiu jitsu that

4:56:58.960 --> 4:57:00.960
 reveals the

4:57:00.960 --> 4:57:02.960
 chest of it the

4:57:02.960 --> 4:57:04.960
 the like the

4:57:04.960 --> 4:57:06.960
 the science of it and I do

4:57:06.960 --> 4:57:08.960
 think about that more as kind of an older

4:57:08.960 --> 4:57:10.960
 person considering the martial arts where

4:57:10.960 --> 4:57:12.960
 I can remember the very earliest

4:57:12.960 --> 4:57:14.960
 days getting back into judo and I'm like

4:57:14.960 --> 4:57:16.960
 teach me submissions right now

4:57:16.960 --> 4:57:18.960
 you know it's like learn the arm bar learn the choke

4:57:18.960 --> 4:57:20.960
 I but as you get older

4:57:20.960 --> 4:57:22.960
 you start thinking more about it's like okay

4:57:22.960 --> 4:57:24.960
 I really do want to like learn the entire

4:57:24.960 --> 4:57:26.960
 canon of judo it's like aren't all the

4:57:26.960 --> 4:57:28.960
 different things there and like all the

4:57:28.960 --> 4:57:30.960
 different approaches for it not just the

4:57:30.960 --> 4:57:32.960
 you know if you want to compete there's just a

4:57:32.960 --> 4:57:34.960
 handful of things you learn really really well

4:57:34.960 --> 4:57:36.960
 but sometimes there's interest in learning a

4:57:36.960 --> 4:57:38.960
 little bit more of the scope there and

4:57:38.960 --> 4:57:40.960
 figuring some things out from

4:57:40.960 --> 4:57:42.960
 you know at one point I had wasn't exactly

4:57:42.960 --> 4:57:44.960
 a spreadsheet but I did have a

4:57:44.960 --> 4:57:46.960
 you know a big long text file with like here's

4:57:46.960 --> 4:57:48.960
 the things that I learned in here like ways

4:57:48.960 --> 4:57:50.960
 you chain this together and while

4:57:50.960 --> 4:57:52.960
 when I went back a few years

4:57:52.960 --> 4:57:54.960
 ago it was good to see that I

4:57:54.960 --> 4:57:56.960
 I whipped myself back into reasonable shape

4:57:56.960 --> 4:57:58.960
 about doing the basic grappling but I know

4:57:58.960 --> 4:58:00.960
 there was a ton of the subtleties that were

4:58:00.960 --> 4:58:02.960
 just that were gone but could probably be

4:58:02.960 --> 4:58:04.960
 brought back reasonably quickly

4:58:04.960 --> 4:58:06.960
 and there's also the benefit I mean

4:58:06.960 --> 4:58:08.960
 you're exceptionally successful now

4:58:08.960 --> 4:58:10.960
 um

4:58:10.960 --> 4:58:12.960
 you're brilliant

4:58:12.960 --> 4:58:14.960
 and the problem the old problem

4:58:14.960 --> 4:58:16.960
 of the ego

4:58:16.960 --> 4:58:18.960
 I still pushed kind of

4:58:18.960 --> 4:58:20.960
 harder than I should I mean that was

4:58:20.960 --> 4:58:22.960
 I was one of those people that I

4:58:22.960 --> 4:58:24.960
 I'm on the smaller side

4:58:24.960 --> 4:58:26.960
 for a lot of the people competing

4:58:26.960 --> 4:58:28.960
 and I would you know I'd go with all the

4:58:28.960 --> 4:58:30.960
 big guys and I'd go hard and I'd push

4:58:30.960 --> 4:58:32.960
 myself a lot and that would be

4:58:32.960 --> 4:58:34.960
 one of those where I would

4:58:34.960 --> 4:58:36.960
 I you know I'd be dangerous

4:58:36.960 --> 4:58:38.960
 to anyone for first five minutes but then

4:58:38.960 --> 4:58:40.960
 sometimes after that I'm already dead

4:58:40.960 --> 4:58:42.960
 and I knew it was terrible for me because

4:58:42.960 --> 4:58:44.960
 it made the you know it meant

4:58:44.960 --> 4:58:46.960
 I got less training time with all of that

4:58:46.960 --> 4:58:48.960
 when you go and you just gas out

4:58:48.960 --> 4:58:50.960
 you know relatively quickly there and I

4:58:50.960 --> 4:58:52.960
 like to think that I would be better

4:58:52.960 --> 4:58:54.960
 about that where after I gave up

4:58:54.960 --> 4:58:56.960
 judo I started doing the half marathons

4:58:56.960 --> 4:58:58.960
 and tough butters and things like that

4:58:58.960 --> 4:59:00.960
 and so when I did go back to the

4:59:00.960 --> 4:59:02.960
 local judo kai club I thought

4:59:02.960 --> 4:59:04.960
 it's like oh I should have better cardio for this

4:59:04.960 --> 4:59:06.960
 I'm a runner now and I do all of this

4:59:06.960 --> 4:59:08.960
 and didn't work out that way it was the same

4:59:08.960 --> 4:59:10.960
 old thing where just push

4:59:10.960 --> 4:59:12.960
 really hard strain really hard and

4:59:12.960 --> 4:59:14.960
 and of course when I worked with good guys

4:59:14.960 --> 4:59:16.960
 like Carlos it's like

4:59:16.960 --> 4:59:18.960
 just the whole flow like water thing is

4:59:18.960 --> 4:59:20.960
 real and he's just like that's true with

4:59:20.960 --> 4:59:22.960
 judo to some of the best people like

4:59:22.960 --> 4:59:24.960
 I've trained with Olympic gold medalists

4:59:24.960 --> 4:59:26.960
 and for some reason

4:59:26.960 --> 4:59:28.960
 with them everything's easier

4:59:28.960 --> 4:59:30.960
 everything it's you

4:59:30.960 --> 4:59:32.960
 actually start to feel

4:59:32.960 --> 4:59:34.960
 the science of it the music

4:59:34.960 --> 4:59:36.960
 of it the dance of it everything

4:59:36.960 --> 4:59:38.960
 is effortless

4:59:38.960 --> 4:59:40.960
 you understand that there's an art

4:59:40.960 --> 4:59:42.960
 to it it's not just an exercise

4:59:42.960 --> 4:59:44.960
 it was interesting where I did

4:59:44.960 --> 4:59:46.960
 go to the Kodokan in Japan

4:59:46.960 --> 4:59:48.960
 the birthplace of judo and everything

4:59:48.960 --> 4:59:50.960
 and I remember I rolled with one old guy

4:59:50.960 --> 4:59:52.960
 I didn't

4:59:52.960 --> 4:59:54.960
 start standing just started on groundwork

4:59:54.960 --> 4:59:56.960
 and it was striking how

4:59:56.960 --> 4:59:58.960
 different it was from Carlos he was still

4:59:58.960 --> 5:00:00.960
 he was better than me and he got my arm

5:00:00.960 --> 5:00:02.960
 you know I had to tap there but

5:00:02.960 --> 5:00:04.960
 it was a completely different style

5:00:04.960 --> 5:00:06.960
 where I just felt like I could do nothing

5:00:06.960 --> 5:00:08.960
 he was just enveloping me and just like slowly

5:00:08.960 --> 5:00:10.960
 ground it down put my arm and bent it

5:00:10.960 --> 5:00:12.960
 while with Carlos

5:00:12.960 --> 5:00:14.960
 you know he's just loose and free and you always

5:00:14.960 --> 5:00:16.960
 thought like oh you're just gonna go grab something

5:00:16.960 --> 5:00:18.960
 but never had any chance to do it but it was

5:00:18.960 --> 5:00:20.960
 very different feeling that's a good summary

5:00:20.960 --> 5:00:22.960
 of the difference between Jiu Jitsu and judo

5:00:22.960 --> 5:00:24.960
 and Jiu Jitsu there's it is a dance

5:00:24.960 --> 5:00:26.960
 and you feel like there's a freedom

5:00:26.960 --> 5:00:28.960
 and actually

5:00:28.960 --> 5:00:30.960
 anybody I tried like Gordon

5:00:30.960 --> 5:00:32.960
 Ryan one of the best

5:00:32.960 --> 5:00:34.960
 grappler in the world

5:00:34.960 --> 5:00:36.960
 there's a feeling like you can do anything

5:00:36.960 --> 5:00:38.960
 but

5:00:38.960 --> 5:00:40.960
 when you actually try to do something

5:00:40.960 --> 5:00:42.960
 you can't just magically doesn't work

5:00:42.960 --> 5:00:44.960
 but with the best judo players in the world

5:00:44.960 --> 5:00:46.960
 it does feel like there's

5:00:46.960 --> 5:00:48.960
 a blanket that weighs a thousand

5:00:48.960 --> 5:00:50.960
 pounds on top of you and

5:00:50.960 --> 5:00:52.960
 there's not a feeling like you can do anything

5:00:52.960 --> 5:00:54.960
 you just you're trapped

5:00:54.960 --> 5:00:56.960
 and that's a style that's a difference

5:00:56.960 --> 5:00:58.960
 in the style of martial arts

5:00:58.960 --> 5:01:00.960
 but it's also

5:01:00.960 --> 5:01:02.960
 once you start to study you understand it

5:01:02.960 --> 5:01:04.960
 all has to do with human movement and the

5:01:04.960 --> 5:01:06.960
 physics of it and the leverage and all that kind of stuff

5:01:06.960 --> 5:01:08.960
 and that's like that's super fascinating

5:01:08.960 --> 5:01:10.960
 at the end of the day for me

5:01:10.960 --> 5:01:12.960
 the biggest benefit is in the humbling

5:01:12.960 --> 5:01:14.960
 aspect when another human being

5:01:16.960 --> 5:01:18.960
 kind of tells you that

5:01:18.960 --> 5:01:20.960
 you know there's a hierarchy

5:01:20.960 --> 5:01:22.960
 or there's a

5:01:22.960 --> 5:01:24.960
 you're not that special

5:01:24.960 --> 5:01:26.960
 and in the most extreme case when you

5:01:26.960 --> 5:01:28.960
 tap to a choke you are basically

5:01:28.960 --> 5:01:30.960
 living because somebody

5:01:30.960 --> 5:01:32.960
 lets you live and that is

5:01:32.960 --> 5:01:34.960
 one of those if you think about it that is a

5:01:34.960 --> 5:01:36.960
 closer brush with mortality than

5:01:36.960 --> 5:01:38.960
 than most people consider

5:01:38.960 --> 5:01:40.960
 and that

5:01:40.960 --> 5:01:42.960
 kind of humbling

5:01:42.960 --> 5:01:44.960
 act is good to take to your

5:01:44.960 --> 5:01:46.960
 work then where it's harder to get

5:01:46.960 --> 5:01:48.960
 humbled you know

5:01:48.960 --> 5:01:50.960
 yeah because nobody's nobody that does any

5:01:50.960 --> 5:01:52.960
 martial art is coming out thinking I'm the best in the

5:01:52.960 --> 5:01:54.960
 world at anything because

5:01:54.960 --> 5:01:56.960
 everybody loses

5:01:56.960 --> 5:01:58.960
 let me ask you for advice

5:01:58.960 --> 5:02:00.960
 what advice would you give to young

5:02:00.960 --> 5:02:02.960
 people today

5:02:02.960 --> 5:02:04.960
 about life about career

5:02:04.960 --> 5:02:06.960
 how they can have a job

5:02:06.960 --> 5:02:08.960
 how they can have an impact

5:02:08.960 --> 5:02:10.960
 how they can have a life that

5:02:10.960 --> 5:02:12.960
 can be proud of

5:02:12.960 --> 5:02:14.960
 so it was kind of fun I got

5:02:14.960 --> 5:02:16.960
 invited to give the commencement speech back

5:02:16.960 --> 5:02:18.960
 at the I went to a college

5:02:18.960 --> 5:02:20.960
 for two semesters and

5:02:20.960 --> 5:02:22.960
 stopped out and went on to do my tech

5:02:22.960 --> 5:02:24.960
 stuff but they still wanted me to

5:02:24.960 --> 5:02:26.960
 come back and give a commencement speech

5:02:26.960 --> 5:02:28.960
 and I've got that pinned on my

5:02:28.960 --> 5:02:30.960
 twitter account I still feel good about

5:02:30.960 --> 5:02:32.960
 everything that I said there

5:02:32.960 --> 5:02:34.960
 and my biggest point

5:02:34.960 --> 5:02:36.960
 was that the path

5:02:36.960 --> 5:02:38.960
 for me might not be the path for everyone

5:02:38.960 --> 5:02:40.960
 and in fact the advice

5:02:40.960 --> 5:02:42.960
 the path that I took and even the advice

5:02:42.960 --> 5:02:44.960
 that I would give based on my

5:02:44.960 --> 5:02:46.960
 experience and learnings probably

5:02:46.960 --> 5:02:48.960
 isn't the best advice for everyone

5:02:48.960 --> 5:02:50.960
 because what I did was all about

5:02:50.960 --> 5:02:52.960
 this knowledge in depth it was

5:02:52.960 --> 5:02:54.960
 about not just having this

5:02:54.960 --> 5:02:56.960
 surface level ability to make things

5:02:56.960 --> 5:02:58.960
 do what I want but to really understand

5:02:58.960 --> 5:03:00.960
 them through and through to let me do

5:03:00.960 --> 5:03:02.960
 the systems engineering work and sometimes

5:03:02.960 --> 5:03:04.960
 find these inefficiencies

5:03:04.960 --> 5:03:06.960
 that can be bypassed

5:03:06.960 --> 5:03:08.960
 and that the whole

5:03:08.960 --> 5:03:10.960
 world doesn't need that you know most programmers

5:03:10.960 --> 5:03:12.960
 don't or engineers of any kind don't

5:03:12.960 --> 5:03:14.960
 necessarily need to do that they need to do

5:03:14.960 --> 5:03:16.960
 a little job that's been parceled out

5:03:16.960 --> 5:03:18.960
 to them be reliable

5:03:18.960 --> 5:03:20.960
 let people depend on you do quality

5:03:20.960 --> 5:03:22.960
 work with all of that

5:03:22.960 --> 5:03:24.960
 but people that do have

5:03:24.960 --> 5:03:26.960
 an inclination for wanting

5:03:26.960 --> 5:03:28.960
 to know things deeper

5:03:28.960 --> 5:03:30.960
 and learn things deeper

5:03:30.960 --> 5:03:32.960
 you know there are just layers

5:03:32.960 --> 5:03:34.960
 and layers of things out there

5:03:34.960 --> 5:03:36.960
 and it's amazing it's if you're

5:03:36.960 --> 5:03:38.960
 the right person that is excited

5:03:38.960 --> 5:03:40.960
 about that

5:03:40.960 --> 5:03:42.960
 the world's never been like this before

5:03:42.960 --> 5:03:44.960
 it's better than ever I mean everything that was

5:03:44.960 --> 5:03:46.960
 wonderful for me is still there

5:03:46.960 --> 5:03:48.960
 and there's whole new worlds to explore

5:03:48.960 --> 5:03:50.960
 on the different things that you can

5:03:50.960 --> 5:03:52.960
 do and that

5:03:52.960 --> 5:03:54.960
 you know it's hard work

5:03:54.960 --> 5:03:56.960
 embrace the grind with it

5:03:56.960 --> 5:03:58.960
 and understand as much as you can

5:03:58.960 --> 5:04:00.960
 and then be

5:04:00.960 --> 5:04:02.960
 prepared for opportunities to present themselves

5:04:02.960 --> 5:04:04.960
 where you can't just

5:04:04.960 --> 5:04:06.960
 say this is my golden life and just push

5:04:06.960 --> 5:04:08.960
 at that I mean you might be able to do

5:04:08.960 --> 5:04:10.960
 that but you're going to make more total progress

5:04:10.960 --> 5:04:12.960
 if you say I am preparing

5:04:12.960 --> 5:04:14.960
 myself with this broad set of tools

5:04:14.960 --> 5:04:16.960
 and then I'm being aware

5:04:16.960 --> 5:04:18.960
 of all the way things are changing

5:04:18.960 --> 5:04:20.960
 as I move through the world and as the whole

5:04:20.960 --> 5:04:22.960
 world changes around me and then looking

5:04:22.960 --> 5:04:24.960
 for opportunities to deploy the tools

5:04:24.960 --> 5:04:26.960
 that you've built and

5:04:26.960 --> 5:04:28.960
 there's going to be more and more of those

5:04:28.960 --> 5:04:30.960
 types of things there where

5:04:30.960 --> 5:04:32.960
 an awareness of what's happening

5:04:32.960 --> 5:04:34.960
 where the inefficiencies are

5:04:34.960 --> 5:04:36.960
 what things can be done

5:04:36.960 --> 5:04:38.960
 what's possible versus what's current practice

5:04:38.960 --> 5:04:40.960
 and then finding those areas where

5:04:40.960 --> 5:04:42.960
 you can go and make an adjustment

5:04:42.960 --> 5:04:44.960
 and make something that may

5:04:44.960 --> 5:04:46.960
 affect millions or billions of people

5:04:46.960 --> 5:04:48.960
 in the world make it better

5:04:48.960 --> 5:04:50.960
 when maybe from your own example

5:04:50.960 --> 5:04:52.960
 how are you able to recognize

5:04:52.960 --> 5:04:54.960
 this about yourself that you saw

5:04:54.960 --> 5:04:56.960
 the layers in a particular thing

5:04:56.960 --> 5:04:58.960
 and you were drawn to

5:04:58.960 --> 5:05:00.960
 discovering deeper and deeper truths about it

5:05:00.960 --> 5:05:02.960
 is that something that was obvious

5:05:02.960 --> 5:05:04.960
 to you that you couldn't help or is there

5:05:04.960 --> 5:05:06.960
 some actions you had to take to actually

5:05:06.960 --> 5:05:08.960
 allow yourself to dig deep

5:05:08.960 --> 5:05:10.960
 so in the earliest days of personal computers

5:05:10.960 --> 5:05:12.960
 I remember the reference manuals

5:05:12.960 --> 5:05:14.960
 and the very early ones even had

5:05:14.960 --> 5:05:16.960
 schematics of computers

5:05:16.960 --> 5:05:18.960
 in the background in the back

5:05:18.960 --> 5:05:20.960
 of the books as well as

5:05:20.960 --> 5:05:22.960
 firmware listings and things and I could look

5:05:22.960 --> 5:05:24.960
 at that and at that time when I was a

5:05:24.960 --> 5:05:26.960
 younger teenager I didn't understand

5:05:26.960 --> 5:05:28.960
 a lot of that stuff how the

5:05:28.960 --> 5:05:30.960
 different things worked I was

5:05:30.960 --> 5:05:32.960
 pulling out the information that I could get

5:05:32.960 --> 5:05:34.960
 but I always wanted to know all of that

5:05:34.960 --> 5:05:36.960
 there was like kind of

5:05:36.960 --> 5:05:38.960
 information sitting down there it's like

5:05:38.960 --> 5:05:40.960
 the elder lore that some gray beard wizard

5:05:40.960 --> 5:05:42.960
 I'm you know is the keeper of

5:05:42.960 --> 5:05:44.960
 and so I always felt that pull

5:05:44.960 --> 5:05:46.960
 for wanting to know more

5:05:46.960 --> 5:05:48.960
 wanting to explore the

5:05:48.960 --> 5:05:50.960
 the mysterious areas there

5:05:50.960 --> 5:05:52.960
 and you know and that followed

5:05:52.960 --> 5:05:54.960
 right in through all the things that

5:05:54.960 --> 5:05:56.960
 got the value exploring the video cards

5:05:56.960 --> 5:05:58.960
 leading to the I'm you know the

5:05:58.960 --> 5:06:00.960
 scrolling advantages you know exploring

5:06:00.960 --> 5:06:02.960
 some of the academic papers and things

5:06:02.960 --> 5:06:04.960
 learning about BSP trees and the different

5:06:04.960 --> 5:06:06.960
 things that that I could do

5:06:06.960 --> 5:06:08.960
 I'm you know with those systems and

5:06:08.960 --> 5:06:10.960
 just that the huge larval

5:06:10.960 --> 5:06:12.960
 phases going through aerospace just

5:06:12.960 --> 5:06:14.960
 reading bookshelves full of books

5:06:14.960 --> 5:06:16.960
 I mean again that point where I have enough money

5:06:16.960 --> 5:06:18.960
 I can buy all the books I want it was

5:06:18.960 --> 5:06:20.960
 it was so valuable

5:06:20.960 --> 5:06:22.960
 where I was terrible with my money

5:06:22.960 --> 5:06:24.960
 when I was a kid my mom thought I would always be

5:06:24.960 --> 5:06:26.960
 broke because you know I'd buy my

5:06:26.960 --> 5:06:28.960
 comic books and just be out of money but

5:06:28.960 --> 5:06:30.960
 it was like all the pizza I want

5:06:30.960 --> 5:06:32.960
 all the Diet Coke I want video games

5:06:32.960 --> 5:06:34.960
 and then books books and it

5:06:34.960 --> 5:06:36.960
 didn't take that much as I was making

5:06:36.960 --> 5:06:38.960
 twenty seven K a year I

5:06:38.960 --> 5:06:40.960
 felt rich and I was just getting all the things

5:06:40.960 --> 5:06:42.960
 that that I wanted but

5:06:42.960 --> 5:06:44.960
 that sense of you know that books

5:06:44.960 --> 5:06:46.960
 have always been magical to me and that was one of the things

5:06:46.960 --> 5:06:48.960
 that really made me smile is I

5:06:48.960 --> 5:06:50.960
 Andre had said he found you know when he came

5:06:50.960 --> 5:06:52.960
 over to my house he said he found my library inspiring

5:06:52.960 --> 5:06:54.960
 and just it was

5:06:54.960 --> 5:06:56.960
 great to see you know I still look at him he's kind of a younger

5:06:56.960 --> 5:06:58.960
 guy I sometimes wonder if younger

5:06:58.960 --> 5:07:00.960
 people these days have the same relationship

5:07:00.960 --> 5:07:02.960
 with books that I do where they were

5:07:02.960 --> 5:07:04.960
 such a cornerstone for me in so many

5:07:04.960 --> 5:07:06.960
 ways but that sense that yeah I

5:07:06.960 --> 5:07:08.960
 always wanted to know it all I know I can't

5:07:08.960 --> 5:07:10.960
 and that was like one of the last things I said

5:07:10.960 --> 5:07:12.960
 you know you can't know everything but you

5:07:12.960 --> 5:07:14.960
 should convince yourself that you can know anything

5:07:14.960 --> 5:07:16.960
 you know any one particular

5:07:16.960 --> 5:07:18.960
 thing it was created and discovered

5:07:18.960 --> 5:07:20.960
 by humans you can learn it you can

5:07:20.960 --> 5:07:22.960
 find out what you need on there and you

5:07:22.960 --> 5:07:24.960
 can learn it deeply yeah you

5:07:24.960 --> 5:07:26.960
 can drive a nail down through whatever

5:07:26.960 --> 5:07:28.960
 layer cake problem space you've got

5:07:28.960 --> 5:07:30.960
 and learn a cross section

5:07:30.960 --> 5:07:32.960
 there and not only can you have an impact

5:07:32.960 --> 5:07:34.960
 doing that you can just

5:07:34.960 --> 5:07:36.960
 you can attain happiness doing that

5:07:36.960 --> 5:07:38.960
 there's something so fulfilling about

5:07:38.960 --> 5:07:40.960
 becoming a craftsman of a thing

5:07:40.960 --> 5:07:42.960
 yeah and I don't want to tell people that look

5:07:42.960 --> 5:07:44.960
 this is a good career move just

5:07:44.960 --> 5:07:46.960
 you know grit your teeth and you know and bear it

5:07:46.960 --> 5:07:48.960
 I you know you want people

5:07:48.960 --> 5:07:50.960
 you wanted and I do think

5:07:50.960 --> 5:07:52.960
 it is possible sometimes to find the joy

5:07:52.960 --> 5:07:54.960
 in something like it might not immediately

5:07:54.960 --> 5:07:56.960
 appeal to you but I had told

5:07:56.960 --> 5:07:58.960
 people early on like in

5:07:58.960 --> 5:08:00.960
 software times that I

5:08:00.960 --> 5:08:02.960
 you know it a lot of game developers

5:08:02.960 --> 5:08:04.960
 are in it just because they are so passionate

5:08:04.960 --> 5:08:06.960
 about games but I was always

5:08:06.960 --> 5:08:08.960
 really more flexible in

5:08:08.960 --> 5:08:10.960
 what appealed to me where I said

5:08:10.960 --> 5:08:12.960
 I think I could be quite

5:08:12.960 --> 5:08:14.960
 engaged doing operating system

5:08:14.960 --> 5:08:16.960
 work even database work I

5:08:16.960 --> 5:08:18.960
 would find the interest in that

5:08:18.960 --> 5:08:20.960
 because I think most things that are

5:08:20.960 --> 5:08:22.960
 significant in the world have a lot

5:08:22.960 --> 5:08:24.960
 of layers and complexity to them

5:08:24.960 --> 5:08:26.960
 and a lot of opportunities hidden within

5:08:26.960 --> 5:08:28.960
 them so

5:08:28.960 --> 5:08:30.960
 that would probably be the most important thing to encourage

5:08:30.960 --> 5:08:32.960
 to people is that

5:08:32.960 --> 5:08:34.960
 you can it's like weaponized curiosity

5:08:34.960 --> 5:08:36.960
 you can deploy your curiosity

5:08:36.960 --> 5:08:38.960
 to find I to kind of like make

5:08:38.960 --> 5:08:40.960
 things useful and valuable

5:08:40.960 --> 5:08:42.960
 to you even if they don't immediately appear

5:08:42.960 --> 5:08:44.960
 that way deploy your curiosity

5:08:44.960 --> 5:08:46.960
 yeah that's very true

5:08:46.960 --> 5:08:48.960
 we've mentioned this debate point

5:08:48.960 --> 5:08:50.960
 whether mortality or fear

5:08:50.960 --> 5:08:52.960
 of mortality is fundamental

5:08:52.960 --> 5:08:54.960
 to creating an AGI

5:08:54.960 --> 5:08:56.960
 but let's talk about whether it's

5:08:56.960 --> 5:08:58.960
 fundamental to human beings do you

5:08:58.960 --> 5:09:00.960
 think about your own mortality

5:09:00.960 --> 5:09:02.960
 I really don't

5:09:02.960 --> 5:09:04.960
 and you probably always

5:09:04.960 --> 5:09:06.960
 have to like take with a grain of salt

5:09:06.960 --> 5:09:08.960
 anything somebody says about fundamental things

5:09:08.960 --> 5:09:10.960
 like that I am

5:09:10.960 --> 5:09:12.960
 but I don't think about

5:09:12.960 --> 5:09:14.960
 really aging

5:09:14.960 --> 5:09:16.960
 impending death legacy with

5:09:16.960 --> 5:09:18.960
 I with my children things like

5:09:18.960 --> 5:09:20.960
 that and clearly it seems

5:09:20.960 --> 5:09:22.960
 most of the world does a lot

5:09:22.960 --> 5:09:24.960
 a lot more than I do

5:09:24.960 --> 5:09:26.960
 so I mean I think I'm an outlier

5:09:26.960 --> 5:09:28.960
 in that where

5:09:28.960 --> 5:09:30.960
 it's

5:09:30.960 --> 5:09:32.960
 it doesn't wind up being a real part of

5:09:32.960 --> 5:09:34.960
 my thinking and motivation

5:09:34.960 --> 5:09:36.960
 about things so daily existence

5:09:36.960 --> 5:09:38.960
 is about

5:09:38.960 --> 5:09:40.960
 sort of the people you love

5:09:40.960 --> 5:09:42.960
 and the problems

5:09:42.960 --> 5:09:44.960
 before you I'm very much focused on

5:09:44.960 --> 5:09:46.960
 what I'm working on right now

5:09:46.960 --> 5:09:48.960
 I do take that back

5:09:48.960 --> 5:09:50.960
 there's one aspect where the

5:09:50.960 --> 5:09:52.960
 kind of finiteness of the life does impact

5:09:52.960 --> 5:09:54.960
 me and that is about

5:09:54.960 --> 5:09:56.960
 thinking about the scope of the problems

5:09:56.960 --> 5:09:58.960
 that I'm working on when I

5:09:58.960 --> 5:10:00.960
 decided to work on when I was like

5:10:00.960 --> 5:10:02.960
 nuclear fission or AGI these are

5:10:02.960 --> 5:10:04.960
 big ticket things that

5:10:04.960 --> 5:10:06.960
 that are impact

5:10:06.960 --> 5:10:08.960
 large fractions of the world

5:10:08.960 --> 5:10:10.960
 and I was thinking to myself at some level

5:10:10.960 --> 5:10:12.960
 that okay I mean I may

5:10:12.960 --> 5:10:14.960
 have a couple more swings

5:10:14.960 --> 5:10:16.960
 at bat with me at full

5:10:16.960 --> 5:10:18.960
 capability but yes my

5:10:18.960 --> 5:10:20.960
 my mental abilities will decay

5:10:20.960 --> 5:10:22.960
 with age you know mostly inevitably

5:10:22.960 --> 5:10:24.960
 I don't think it's a 0%

5:10:24.960 --> 5:10:26.960
 chance that we will address some of that

5:10:26.960 --> 5:10:28.960
 before it becomes a problem for me I think

5:10:28.960 --> 5:10:30.960
 exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades

5:10:30.960 --> 5:10:32.960
 but I do have this

5:10:32.960 --> 5:10:34.960
 kind of vague plan that when

5:10:34.960 --> 5:10:36.960
 I'm not at the top of my game and I don't feel that

5:10:36.960 --> 5:10:38.960
 I'm you know in a position to put a

5:10:38.960 --> 5:10:40.960
 dent in the world some way that

5:10:40.960 --> 5:10:42.960
 I'll probably wind up doing some kind of

5:10:42.960 --> 5:10:44.960
 recreational retro programming or

5:10:44.960 --> 5:10:46.960
 you know I'll work on some

5:10:46.960 --> 5:10:48.960
 you know something that I would not

5:10:48.960 --> 5:10:50.960
 devote my life to now but I can

5:10:50.960 --> 5:10:52.960
 while away my time as the old man

5:10:52.960 --> 5:10:54.960
 gardening in the code worlds

5:10:54.960 --> 5:10:56.960
 and then

5:10:56.960 --> 5:10:58.960
 to step back even bigger

5:10:58.960 --> 5:11:00.960
 let me ask you about why we're here

5:11:00.960 --> 5:11:02.960
 we human beings

5:11:02.960 --> 5:11:04.960
 what's the meaning of it all

5:11:04.960 --> 5:11:06.960
 what's the meaning of life John Carmich

5:11:06.960 --> 5:11:08.960
 so very similar with that last question

5:11:08.960 --> 5:11:10.960
 I know a lot of people fret

5:11:10.960 --> 5:11:12.960
 about this question a lot and I just

5:11:12.960 --> 5:11:14.960
 really don't

5:11:14.960 --> 5:11:16.960
 you know we are

5:11:16.960 --> 5:11:18.960
 biological creatures that

5:11:18.960 --> 5:11:20.960
 happenstance of evolution

5:11:20.960 --> 5:11:22.960
 you know we have innate drives

5:11:22.960 --> 5:11:24.960
 that evolution crafted for

5:11:24.960 --> 5:11:26.960
 survival and passing on of genetic

5:11:26.960 --> 5:11:28.960
 codes

5:11:28.960 --> 5:11:30.960
 I don't

5:11:30.960 --> 5:11:32.960
 find a lot of value in trying to go

5:11:32.960 --> 5:11:34.960
 much deeper than that I have my motivation

5:11:34.960 --> 5:11:36.960
 some of which are

5:11:36.960 --> 5:11:38.960
 you know some of which are probably genetically coded

5:11:38.960 --> 5:11:40.960
 many of which are contingent on my

5:11:40.960 --> 5:11:42.960
 upbringing and the path that I've had through my life

5:11:42.960 --> 5:11:44.960
 I don't

5:11:44.960 --> 5:11:46.960
 run into like spades of

5:11:46.960 --> 5:11:48.960
 depression or envy or anything

5:11:48.960 --> 5:11:50.960
 that winds up being

5:11:50.960 --> 5:11:52.960
 a challenge and forcing a

5:11:52.960 --> 5:11:54.960
 degree of soul searching with things like that

5:11:54.960 --> 5:11:56.960
 I seem to be okay

5:11:56.960 --> 5:11:58.960
 you know kind of without that

5:12:00.960 --> 5:12:02.960
 as a brilliant ant in the ant colony

5:12:02.960 --> 5:12:04.960
 without looking up to the sky wondering

5:12:04.960 --> 5:12:06.960
 why the hell am I here again

5:12:06.960 --> 5:12:08.960
 so the

5:12:08.960 --> 5:12:10.960
 sky of it the incredible

5:12:10.960 --> 5:12:12.960
 mystery

5:12:12.960 --> 5:12:14.960
 of the fact that we started

5:12:14.960 --> 5:12:16.960
 first of all the origin of life on earth

5:12:16.960 --> 5:12:18.960
 and from that

5:12:18.960 --> 5:12:20.960
 from single cell organisms

5:12:20.960 --> 5:12:22.960
 the entirety of the evolutionary process

5:12:22.960 --> 5:12:24.960
 took us somehow to this incredibly intelligent

5:12:24.960 --> 5:12:26.960
 thing that is able to

5:12:26.960 --> 5:12:28.960
 build Wolfenstein 3D

5:12:28.960 --> 5:12:30.960
 and doom and quake and

5:12:30.960 --> 5:12:32.960
 take a crack at the problem

5:12:32.960 --> 5:12:34.960
 of AGI and create things that

5:12:34.960 --> 5:12:36.960
 eventually supersede human beings

5:12:36.960 --> 5:12:38.960
 that doesn't

5:12:38.960 --> 5:12:40.960
 the why of it

5:12:40.960 --> 5:12:42.960
 is um

5:12:42.960 --> 5:12:44.960
 it's been my experience that people

5:12:44.960 --> 5:12:46.960
 that focus on

5:12:46.960 --> 5:12:48.960
 that don't focus on the here and now right in

5:12:48.960 --> 5:12:50.960
 front of them tend to be less effective

5:12:50.960 --> 5:12:52.960
 I mean it's not 100%

5:12:52.960 --> 5:12:54.960
 you know vision matters to some

5:12:54.960 --> 5:12:56.960
 people but I

5:12:56.960 --> 5:12:58.960
 it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator

5:12:58.960 --> 5:13:00.960
 for me and I think that

5:13:00.960 --> 5:13:02.960
 the process of getting there is usually

5:13:02.960 --> 5:13:04.960
 done against like the magic of gradient descent

5:13:04.960 --> 5:13:06.960
 people just don't believe

5:13:06.960 --> 5:13:08.960
 that just looking locally gets you

5:13:08.960 --> 5:13:10.960
 to all of these spectacular things

5:13:10.960 --> 5:13:12.960
 that's been you know the decades

5:13:12.960 --> 5:13:14.960
 of looking at I

5:13:14.960 --> 5:13:16.960
 really some of the smartest people

5:13:16.960 --> 5:13:18.960
 in the world that would just push back

5:13:18.960 --> 5:13:20.960
 forever against this idea that

5:13:20.960 --> 5:13:22.960
 it's not this grand sophisticated

5:13:22.960 --> 5:13:24.960
 vision of everything but

5:13:24.960 --> 5:13:26.960
 little tiny steps local information

5:13:26.960 --> 5:13:28.960
 winds up leading to all the best answers

5:13:28.960 --> 5:13:30.960
 so the meaning of life

5:13:30.960 --> 5:13:32.960
 is uh following

5:13:32.960 --> 5:13:34.960
 locally wherever the gradient

5:13:34.960 --> 5:13:36.960
 descent takes you

5:13:36.960 --> 5:13:38.960
 this was an incredible conversation

5:13:38.960 --> 5:13:40.960
 officially the longest conversation

5:13:40.960 --> 5:13:42.960
 I've ever done on the podcast

5:13:42.960 --> 5:13:44.960
 which means a lot to me because

5:13:44.960 --> 5:13:46.960
 I get to do it with one of my heroes

5:13:46.960 --> 5:13:48.960
 John I can't tell you how much it means to me that

5:13:48.960 --> 5:13:50.960
 you would sit down with me you're an incredible

5:13:50.960 --> 5:13:52.960
 human being um

5:13:52.960 --> 5:13:54.960
 I can't wait what you do next but you've already

5:13:54.960 --> 5:13:56.960
 changed the world you're an inspiration to

5:13:56.960 --> 5:13:58.960
 so many people and again

5:13:58.960 --> 5:14:00.960
 we haven't covered like

5:14:00.960 --> 5:14:02.960
 most of what I was playing to talk

5:14:02.960 --> 5:14:04.960
 about so I hope we get a chance to talk

5:14:04.960 --> 5:14:06.960
 some day in the future and I can't wait

5:14:06.960 --> 5:14:08.960
 to see what you do next thank you so

5:14:08.960 --> 5:14:10.960
 much again for talking to me thank you very much

5:14:10.960 --> 5:14:12.960
 thanks for listening to this

5:14:12.960 --> 5:14:14.960
 conversation with John Carmack

5:14:14.960 --> 5:14:16.960
 to support this podcast please check out our

5:14:16.960 --> 5:14:18.960
 sponsors in the description

5:14:18.960 --> 5:14:20.960
 and now let me leave you with some words

5:14:20.960 --> 5:14:22.960
 from John Carmack himself

5:14:22.960 --> 5:14:24.960
 focused hard work

5:14:24.960 --> 5:14:26.960
 is the real key to success

5:14:26.960 --> 5:14:28.960
 keep your eyes on the goal

5:14:28.960 --> 5:14:30.960
 and just keep taking the next step towards

5:14:30.960 --> 5:14:32.960
 completing it if you aren't sure

5:14:32.960 --> 5:14:34.960
 which way to do something do it both ways

5:14:34.960 --> 5:14:36.960
 and see which works better

5:14:36.960 --> 5:14:38.960
 thank you for listening

5:14:38.960 --> 5:15:00.960
 and hope to see you next time
