 The following is a conversation with Jason Calacanis, who's an entrepreneur, investor,

00:05.720 --> 00:11.440
 author of Angel, How to Invest in Technology startups, and as many people may know, he's

00:11.440 --> 00:19.880
 a fun, brilliant, longtime podcast host of This Week in Startups, and cohost of the All

00:19.880 --> 00:26.640
 In podcast with Chamath Palahapatia, David Sacks, and David Friedberg, who all happen

00:26.640 --> 00:30.400
 to be poker buddies and self proclaimed besties.

00:30.400 --> 00:37.240
 The result is always a great listen due to both the love and the heated disagreements.

00:37.240 --> 00:43.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Brave Browser, Linode Linux Virtual Machines, FourSigmatic

00:43.360 --> 00:47.640
 Mushroom Coffee, and Rev Speech Detects Service.

 As a side note, let me say that I've been learning a lot about real world finance in

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
 the past few months.

00:56.360 --> 01:00.880
 To give you a bit of context, on the side, I've studied trading from an algorithmic

01:00.880 --> 01:05.840
 trading perspective as a machine learning and game theory problem off and on for a few

01:05.840 --> 01:08.200
 years in undergrad and grad school.

01:08.200 --> 01:14.600
 I found the distributed, complex system aspect of finance and economics in general fascinating.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.360
 But now, I find even more fascinating the human side of the whole thing.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.480
 Ideas of greed, power, freedom, and truth.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.480
 Wall Street Bets, Robin Hood, and the whole beautiful mess around this topic allows us

01:28.480 --> 01:34.840
 to have great conversations about human nature and the systems that underlie the rise and

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
 fall of civilizations.

 And now, here's my conversation with Jason Colicanus.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.240
 I have a million things to talk to you about, but we do happen to be living through what

01:57.240 --> 02:04.440
 I would think of as a historic event in terms of its impact, in terms of almost philosophically

02:04.440 --> 02:10.280
 thinking about the role of people and how they can fight power with this whole Wall

02:10.280 --> 02:13.480
 Street Bets and GameStop situation.

02:13.480 --> 02:19.200
 I was wondering, you've covered in your amazing online podcast, you guys have been having

02:19.200 --> 02:22.480
 fascinating battles over this whole situation.

02:22.480 --> 02:28.240
 I was wondering if you could tell maybe from your perspective, as it's unrolling the

02:28.240 --> 02:34.520
 saga of Wall Street Bets and GameStop, what are some interesting insights that you have

02:34.520 --> 02:36.880
 about this whole set of events?

02:36.880 --> 02:41.360
 In full disclosure, I was an angel investor in Robin Hood before they launched.

02:41.360 --> 02:47.520
 And when I met the founder Vlad and his partner, they pitched me at a bar, not too far from

02:47.520 --> 02:51.400
 where we are right now, in Palo Alto called Antonio's Nut House.

02:51.400 --> 02:56.200
 And my friend Adeo, it's a really good story, my friend Adeo had asked me to speak at his

02:56.200 --> 02:59.800
 founder's institute, which is kind of like an accelerator for people who are thinking

02:59.800 --> 03:00.960
 about starting a company.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.560
 And so I gave a talk and then he said, hey, let's go to Antonio's Nut House and we'll

03:05.560 --> 03:07.520
 meet Elon for a drink.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.720
 And so Elon met us for a drink there.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.160
 And it's the divest of dive bars.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.880
 Like you'll take a beer.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.640
 I love the image of all of this, you hang out with Elon at a crappy bar.

03:18.640 --> 03:24.040
 Yeah, I mean, it is the worst bar in the peninsula.

03:24.040 --> 03:29.200
 Like just garbage on the floor and like cheap beer and warm beer and like you pick up your

03:29.200 --> 03:30.920
 pine glass and be lipstick on it.

03:30.920 --> 03:31.920
 It's brutal.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.920
 Classy.

03:32.920 --> 03:33.920
 Not your lipstick.

03:33.920 --> 03:34.920
 You understand?

03:34.920 --> 03:35.920
 Somebody else's lipstick.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.920
 Yes.

03:36.920 --> 03:42.640
 And so we're sitting there and Vlad walks up with his partner and he says, you're Jason

03:42.640 --> 03:44.680
 Calacanis and I said, tell me about your startup.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.080
 He said, how do you know I have a startup?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.600
 I said, you recognize me.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.720
 And I mean, that's the only way.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
 And he goes, is that Elon Musk?

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
 I said, yes, Elon.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
 Say hi.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.720
 And he came over and said hi.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
 I said, tell me what you do.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.720
 He said, well, I'm a quant.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.720
 And I said, what's that?

03:57.720 --> 04:02.240
 And he said, quantitative analysis and I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, I know about that.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.160
 That's like, you guys make algorithms and then try to beat the market, right?

04:05.160 --> 04:08.560
 He's like, yeah, I was like, so you're going to pitch me on a startup and you're going

04:08.560 --> 04:10.640
 to sell your algorithm to other people.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.000
 And if it was so good, why wouldn't you just use it yourself and print money?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.480
 He's like, yeah, yeah, no, no, that's not our business.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.000
 Our business is we're going to create an app to get millennials to trade stocks.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.680
 And he said, hmm, you do realize there's no retail investors anymore, like the dot com

04:24.680 --> 04:30.440
 crash plus the 2008 financial crisis eliminated any individual's belief in participating in

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
 the stock market.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.920
 And he said, that's the opportunity.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.160
 I said, okay, I like it.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
 Tell me more.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.000
 He said, well, we're going to get these millennials to trade.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.400
 I said, the same ones who live in their mom's basements and take Uber and Lyft and are on

04:42.400 --> 04:48.640
 their parents have no money, got screwed and went 250k into debt for school and now can't

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
 get a job.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
 Those people?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
 And he's like, yeah.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.720
 I'm like, okay, they have no interest in their future, but they're going to trade stocks.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
 He said, yeah, that's the opportunity.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.480
 I was like, how are you going to make money?

04:58.480 --> 05:00.080
 And he said, well, that's the best part.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
 It's going to be free.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.360
 And I said, so your idea is to get a group of people who have no interest in saving for

05:05.360 --> 05:08.040
 their future to trade and your business model is free.

05:08.040 --> 05:14.360
 And he said, yes, I said, I'm in because in almost all cases, the crazy outlandish ideas

05:14.360 --> 05:17.520
 that nobody believes in are the ones that have the greatest returns.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.360
 I mean, Uber, I introduced to about 25 investors and three of us said yes.

05:22.360 --> 05:27.720
 So a full 12% of the community who saw that deal decided to do it.

05:27.720 --> 05:32.880
 So your sense about this idea being good had to do with the fact that this guy was just

05:32.880 --> 05:39.040
 the crazy and ambitious and bold thinking, or was it that there's something here in allowing

05:39.040 --> 05:42.400
 a much larger magnitude of people to be able to be investors?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
 Yeah.

05:43.400 --> 05:49.960
 The way to do really well as an angel investor or just in technology or in life is to not

05:49.960 --> 05:52.520
 say what could go wrong, but to say what could go right.

05:52.520 --> 05:58.360
 And then to just imagine for a moment, if it does work, what would the world look like?

05:58.360 --> 06:03.240
 And so when Elon was investing in Tesla and some other guys were running it and he was

06:03.240 --> 06:08.160
 trying to save the company, is this going to work?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.880
 It was almost positively not going to work.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.040
 And he knew that.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.440
 But if it does work, what does the world look like?

06:16.440 --> 06:22.560
 And so that's really what you're looking for is not the chances of success, but if it does

06:22.560 --> 06:25.400
 succeed, what would that look like?

06:25.400 --> 06:28.880
 And that's what the world needs more people doing.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.960
 And so when you looked at Robinhood, it was like, well, if he does succeed, what would

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
 the world look like?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.600
 And now we've seen what it looks like.

06:34.600 --> 06:40.720
 You have a generation who are so financially sophisticated that they know how to do puts

06:40.720 --> 06:48.640
 and calls and shorts and research at a level that dominated the hedge fund industry.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.800
 So let's pause for a second.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.760
 These traders sitting there on a subreddit in a Discord server are able to do analysis

06:55.760 --> 07:03.480
 and research and then act in unison to say, we're going to beat, in the Robinhood sense,

07:03.480 --> 07:08.160
 this group of sophisticated insiders who have more access and more access to capital, but

07:08.160 --> 07:11.320
 we will figure out how to solve this problem.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.880
 And most things don't work.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.360
 It's like the Wikipedia.

07:16.360 --> 07:21.400
 There's no way the Wikipedia would ever work, except it did.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.520
 You're like, how is this ever going to work?

07:23.520 --> 07:27.720
 You're not paying anybody, but it's both the largest corpus of an encyclopedia ever.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.880
 So I think Robinhood actually succeeded.

07:29.880 --> 07:35.400
 And then what we saw was this system and a lot of the systems in our society, whether

07:35.400 --> 07:41.480
 it's the political system, the Constitution of the United States, education, higher education

07:41.480 --> 07:46.000
 which you're involved in, and then even the financial system, we have not stress tested

07:46.000 --> 07:47.560
 and stress tested it.

07:47.560 --> 07:51.320
 And we don't actually know all the edge cases and how it works.

07:51.320 --> 07:56.520
 So Trump was able to just really put this crazy stress test.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.160
 Is the democracy going to hold?

07:59.160 --> 08:03.480
 Are we going to break this 200, someone year old experiment?

08:03.480 --> 08:07.240
 And then we looked at the financial markets and it turns out there were more people shorting

08:07.240 --> 08:09.520
 the stock than shares were available.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.640
 I don't know how that's possible.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.640
 And then I'm trying to uncover, where can I see a list of people who've shorted the

08:14.640 --> 08:19.160
 stock and it's like, you can't, but we can tell you sort of how many every two weeks

08:19.160 --> 08:21.920
 or maybe twice a week, we can create a report.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.920
 Maybe we know.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.560
 I was surprised that nobody knows the list of people who are shorted and you guys are

08:26.560 --> 08:27.560
 trying to figure that out.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.040
 Yeah, there's no transparency on a lot of these systems.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.040
 And if you call to try to short a stock, it's almost like they'll tell you on the phone,

08:34.040 --> 08:37.040
 let me see, I think I might know a guy who has shares to loan out.

08:37.040 --> 08:43.840
 So it's like, am I calling to try to find a 73 Mustang Grande in gold?

08:43.840 --> 08:44.840
 You're going to call around.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.200
 It's like, shouldn't this be like on a ledger somewhere and be completely transparent?

08:49.200 --> 08:50.880
 So now we're seeing those things.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.960
 And I think the investigations will make it super clear.

08:52.960 --> 08:58.680
 But of course, in a vacuum without information, there are so many investors in these startups

08:58.680 --> 09:00.640
 that conflicts can start to appear.

09:00.640 --> 09:05.960
 And then you know how it is with people in conspiracy theories, the mind starts to wander.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.680
 And so in some cases, there is actually a conspiracy.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.680
 And then in other cases, people's mind will fill in like, oh my God, there's some grand

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
 conspiracy here.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.960
 So the Robinhood's only goal is to get more people to trade stocks and to democratize it

09:17.960 --> 09:19.240
 even more.

09:19.240 --> 09:26.680
 And they apparently were on the brink of seizing as an entity if they didn't get more money

09:26.680 --> 09:28.000
 to cover all these trades.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.880
 I mean, they were on the brink and they raised $3.5 billion or something like that in a week.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.880
 Yeah.

09:33.880 --> 09:39.220
 So in some sense, Robinhood enabled this very like the magic of this distributed system

09:39.220 --> 09:41.320
 of Wall Street bets, right?

09:41.320 --> 09:46.600
 He said Wikipedia, which is probably one of my favorite websites and one of my favorite

09:46.600 --> 09:51.120
 examples of like a distributed system somehow coming together in a way, just like you said

09:51.120 --> 09:55.560
 at that crappy bar, I would have guessed it would never work.

09:55.560 --> 09:59.040
 But if it does work, it changes everything and it did.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.400
 And Robinhood, in that same way, probably enabled or was one of the major enablers of

10:04.400 --> 10:12.160
 Wall Street bets of giving power, like empowering young kids to learn about how this whole messy

10:12.160 --> 10:17.320
 financial system works and take on the big elite centralized players.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
 Yes.

10:18.320 --> 10:25.320
 And it's very easy when these companies get big, one thing that's changed is the footprint

10:25.320 --> 10:28.160
 of these startups and the velocity at which they grow.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.440
 So something like Airbnb is another perfect example of something that should really not

10:31.440 --> 10:33.200
 work in practice.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.200
 But it does.

10:34.200 --> 10:39.840
 I'm going to rent my couch or my extra room to somebody like a serial killer or I'm going

10:39.840 --> 10:44.800
 to stay in somebody's house like a serial killer's house and it really sounds scary,

10:44.800 --> 10:52.840
 but it actually works and it has not destroyed the hotel business, it has added.

10:52.840 --> 10:56.080
 So the best startups induce a market to exist.

10:56.080 --> 11:04.120
 If you look at Uber or Airbnb, people replace their cars and Uber was not competing ultimately

11:04.120 --> 11:05.120
 with taxis.

11:05.120 --> 11:10.520
 They were competing with car ownership, public transportation, walking, or just not going

11:10.520 --> 11:11.800
 out.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.560
 And then you look at Airbnb, a lot of people who stay in an Airbnb would not be taking

11:15.560 --> 11:21.080
 a trip to Kyoto if not for the fact that they could get a $75 beautiful room with great

11:21.080 --> 11:24.680
 reviews in Kyoto for three weeks.

11:24.680 --> 11:30.720
 It inspires people and it manifests a market because the product is so transcendent, right?

11:30.720 --> 11:34.800
 And I think that's one of the things that Robinhood did, you can't learn how to do this

11:34.800 --> 11:39.680
 options trading and puts and calls and all this sophistication stuff unless you actually

11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
 do it.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.560
 It's just too hard to learn except in practice.

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
 Just like poker.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.600
 If you want to learn how to play poker or guitar or tennis or skiing, you could talk

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
 about it.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.200
 You can watch YouTube videos, but at a certain point, you got to get on the mountain.

11:51.200 --> 11:56.040
 At a certain point, you got to put some chips in the pot and it's going to be painful.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
 Like poker is going to be painful.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.040
 You're going to lose a lot of money.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.120
 That's why you should play at the small tables first and even in trading, you look at people

12:02.120 --> 12:07.200
 who are doing this crazy trading and game stop, a company that's worth maybe a couple

12:07.200 --> 12:10.000
 of billion dollars, but certainly not tens of billions of dollars.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.160
 Of course, the people who are throwing their money and last are going to lose it.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.480
 I think everybody knew that.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.560
 And so it was a momentum play and they're betting against the hedge funds.

12:19.560 --> 12:24.160
 So I think it's good for people to learn and become financially literate and just always

12:24.160 --> 12:27.600
 understand the concept of the risk of ruin.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.360
 The good news is for a young person, the risk of ruin might be like they lose $5,000 or

12:31.360 --> 12:33.680
 something and then they have to build their stack back up.

12:33.680 --> 12:39.520
 But that's really the only thing I am concerned about is there are people who will play poker,

12:39.520 --> 12:43.160
 a blackjack or sports betting or whatever it is and lose control.

12:43.160 --> 12:47.660
 Just like there might be people who try alcohol and lose control, but we can't build a system

12:47.660 --> 12:55.160
 based upon limiting the average person's behavior based upon somebody who can't control their

12:55.160 --> 12:56.160
 ability to drink.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.240
 Two glasses of wine instead of 20.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.600
 How does this whole thing end?

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
 Probably in tears.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
 For who?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
 Yeah.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.600
 Who's crying?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.600
 Is everybody crying?

13:05.600 --> 13:06.600
 Exactly.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
 Who's crying when?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.760
 So I think there were some of the hedge funds that were crying initially, that maybe some

13:09.760 --> 13:13.080
 of the Wall Street bets people who bought last would be crying.

13:13.080 --> 13:17.520
 And then eventually there's probably another set of hedge funds or even the Wall Street

13:17.520 --> 13:23.760
 bets mob and that army, some of them might have broke ranks and then shorted the stock.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.880
 So nobody knows.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.000
 So everybody has to be aware of what's happening in the game.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.200
 So if Wall Street bets said, hey, let's squeeze these hedge funds because they have too much

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
 short interest.

13:32.200 --> 13:37.960
 Let's all buy the stock, then some of them might have said, okay, it's $200 or $300.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.800
 Maybe I'll join the short movement now that they've covered.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.640
 And they could have shorted their double agents.

13:43.640 --> 13:48.240
 So people have to understand this stuff is gnarly and it's a free for all.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.880
 I mean, it is a literal free for all.

13:49.880 --> 13:55.280
 There's a kind of morality, like a big statement that Wall Street bets made in terms of like

13:55.280 --> 13:59.680
 the elites can't just push us around, they can't bully around.

13:59.680 --> 14:05.240
 But at the same time, they're also interested in making money, right?

14:05.240 --> 14:06.240
 What's your sense?

14:06.240 --> 14:09.560
 You said that some of the people in the Wall Street bets might have broken off and shorted

14:09.560 --> 14:10.560
 the stock.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.040
 Are they more interested?

14:12.040 --> 14:18.080
 There was an emergent like morality that emerged and said like, we're not going to put up with

14:18.080 --> 14:22.520
 the centralized elites, but is that going to continue?

14:22.520 --> 14:26.800
 Are they going to fight the power structures that are bad for society or are they going

14:26.800 --> 14:31.800
 to now like, I mean, are they ultimately going to introduce more chaos that's going to damage

14:31.800 --> 14:35.580
 the economy and damage the world or are they going to continue being the good guys and

14:35.580 --> 14:41.520
 fighting the evils that manipulate the market?

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
 What's your sense?

14:42.520 --> 14:47.160
 You know, it really feels like the Dark Knight series of films where like some people just

14:47.160 --> 14:48.720
 want to see the world burn.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.480
 I think there is a contingent of people who just literally want to see chaos.

14:53.480 --> 14:59.360
 You know that contingent on some of these forums who just want to create chaos, right?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.800
 So there's certainly that chaos contingent, but I think overall what the arc will show

15:02.800 --> 15:05.840
 is a group of people getting massively educated.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.560
 You see it in crypto as well.

15:07.560 --> 15:13.600
 There was like a three year period where all of these failed entrepreneurs who I knew

15:13.600 --> 15:19.320
 who couldn't build companies were then coming back to me after their companies has failed

15:19.320 --> 15:22.280
 or after they gave up or couldn't clear a market raising money with the venture capital

15:22.280 --> 15:25.360
 community and they were doing ICOs.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.960
 And I was like, I met you before, right?

15:27.960 --> 15:28.960
 And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:28.960 --> 15:29.960
 No, I'm doing an ICO now.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.000
 I'm like, okay, where's your company at?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.320
 And they're like, here's a white paper.

15:34.320 --> 15:39.040
 And I was like, this white paper with spelling errors in it that says you're going to destroy

15:39.040 --> 15:43.400
 Airbnb because everybody's apartment is going to be on immutable ledger.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.280
 Like wouldn't that be better in a regular database that was private and not public?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.240
 Like why does it need to be on immutable ledgers?

15:49.240 --> 15:50.240
 It can't change.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.560
 I'm like, not changing the database as a feature?

15:53.560 --> 15:55.360
 That does not seem like a good feature.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
 And they couldn't explain it.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.120
 They're like, well, just people are interested in ICOs.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.880
 And there was that ICO mania.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.640
 And what it showed was there's a global appetite for risk.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.360
 People want to try new things.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.480
 This is one of the great things about the human spirit.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.960
 It is one of the great things about capitalism.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.880
 And one of the things that concerns me most about where we're at in society is the sort

16:13.880 --> 16:21.360
 of socialism, communism, entrepreneurship is bad, technology is bad, and polarization

16:21.360 --> 16:23.840
 of wealth and people getting rich is a bad thing.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.440
 When I grew up, I'm 50 now.

16:25.440 --> 16:29.840
 But when I was a Gen Xer growing up, we kind of maybe too much idolized Bill Gates and

16:29.840 --> 16:32.680
 people who were doing interesting things in the world and we thought capitalism was a

16:32.680 --> 16:33.680
 force for good.

16:33.680 --> 16:38.240
 I still believe capitalism is a force for good because when a group of people builds

16:38.240 --> 16:43.080
 a product or service that changes the world and it gets globally distributed, whether

16:43.080 --> 16:50.280
 it's Tesla or SpaceX or Google or Airbnb or Uber or Robinhood, everybody gets to benefit

16:50.280 --> 16:53.240
 from that product or service having to compete.

16:53.240 --> 17:00.480
 And if you look at the places where there's no competition like public education or less

17:00.480 --> 17:05.840
 established colleges and stuff like that, less competition for accreditation degrees,

17:05.840 --> 17:08.800
 things tend to get a little weird, don't they?

17:08.800 --> 17:13.920
 And people tend to be protected and that's not good, you need competition.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.440
 Doesn't mean that people shouldn't have global health care, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't

17:18.440 --> 17:22.920
 have a safety net, but we need to keep capitalism vibrant, especially because China has now

17:22.920 --> 17:28.200
 coopted capitalism and created their own version of capitalism, which is communism

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
 with capitalism.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.680
 It's like this weird operating system, like we still want to keep communism so we can

17:32.680 --> 17:35.520
 take any of your gains at any time.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.440
 But we'd like you to be entrepreneurial.

17:37.440 --> 17:44.280
 And then you have somebody like the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, who disappears for a

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
 couple of weeks.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.280
 Who's that?

17:46.280 --> 17:47.280
 No.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.280
 Exactly.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.280
 Who's Jack Ma?

17:49.280 --> 17:51.720
 I was like, he kind of disappears for a couple of weeks and then he comes back and he's really

17:51.720 --> 17:57.000
 sorry about the things he said and then he disappears again and like, we have to be

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
 very careful.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.480
 If China wins capitalism, this is going to be an existential threat for humanity.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.240
 The Chinese are no joke.

18:07.240 --> 18:12.080
 I mean, they are seriously focused and they are picking the winners.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.480
 It's a very weird system because it is, in fact, I don't know what you call it.

18:16.480 --> 18:22.480
 Communism and capitalism is such overloaded terms, but they do encourage entrepreneurship,

18:22.480 --> 18:25.040
 but they, and they do a good job of it.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.040
 Oh, yes.

18:26.040 --> 18:31.080
 But then they're like the surveillance thing and they're controlling things in a way.

18:31.080 --> 18:36.560
 It's weird because it seems to work really well for them in the short term.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.560
 Yes.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.560
 It's definitely got short term benefits.

18:38.560 --> 18:44.440
 So the question is like what, how that gets distorted and becomes worse and worse and worse,

18:44.440 --> 18:46.080
 which you potentially might be.

18:46.080 --> 18:53.800
 And I think on, you know, the entrepreneurial spirit, which you have apotheos all centered

18:53.800 --> 18:58.920
 around the entrepreneurial spirit is one of the magical things that makes this country

18:58.920 --> 18:59.920
 great.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.160
 The money is deeply tied into that.

19:02.160 --> 19:08.680
 I do get bothered by people, you know, treating the word billionaires if it's a bad word.

19:08.680 --> 19:13.400
 But in general, like all the hard things, all the difficult things we're going through

19:13.400 --> 19:21.560
 in this country, it seems like the way out is going to be making the entrepreneur the

19:21.560 --> 19:27.360
 hero of society of like letting that young kid with a big dream and the guts to take

19:27.360 --> 19:32.960
 the big risks and build something totally new, giving them a chance and whatever that

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
 involves.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.480
 I don't think it's about taxes.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.800
 I don't think it's about like regulation, all that stuff.

19:38.800 --> 19:44.640
 It's about us in just public discourse saying that that kid, that guy, that girl, they're

19:44.640 --> 19:47.520
 bad asses, like encourage them to do it.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.120
 We have to have people buy in to the fact that they have that opportunity.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.680
 And I think one of the problems in society is there's a group of people who actually

19:56.680 --> 20:01.920
 don't believe that they can succeed or they don't believe even more perniciously that

20:01.920 --> 20:03.200
 other people can.

20:03.200 --> 20:07.760
 And that's the group of people that I think are highly vocal, but a small group of people

20:07.760 --> 20:15.440
 which are generally people of incredible privilege, rich parents, white city dwellers, liberals.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.040
 They kind of look and say, poor people cannot change a lot.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.440
 And they're battling in their minds to protect poor people.

20:23.440 --> 20:27.200
 But they have this very weird patriarchal kind of approach to it, which is they think

20:27.200 --> 20:29.840
 that they're not capable of changing their lot in life.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.600
 And they're like, it's not possible.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.120
 And then once in a while, I'll tweet something where I say, you know, it's really incredible

20:35.120 --> 20:41.120
 that every piece of knowledge you could possibly want is now available for free on YouTube.

20:41.120 --> 20:46.320
 And every course from MIT and Harvard and Stanford is available on edX or Coursera and

20:46.320 --> 20:51.120
 all that information is there freely available and you can take the lectures.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.120
 This is amazing.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.720
 And people will be like, yeah, but people don't have access to it.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.960
 I'm like, they do.

20:55.960 --> 20:56.960
 It's free.

20:56.960 --> 20:57.960
 Here's the link.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.480
 And they're like, yeah, but they don't have internet.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.040
 And I'm like, here's the chart of internet penetration in America.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.120
 Like, and they're like, well, poor people don't have internet.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.800
 And I'm like, really?

21:07.800 --> 21:13.320
 Find me any downtrodden person without a smartphone with a high speed connection that capitalism

21:13.320 --> 21:16.520
 provided for $12 a month or $15 a month.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.760
 It's very hard to find that.

21:18.760 --> 21:23.960
 And we have it so well in this country and there's so much opportunity.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.000
 But people don't believe it.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.120
 And that's actually one of the problems.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.760
 See, the average American still watches four or five hours of television a day.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.240
 And often I meet people and they're like, I need a technical co founder.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.640
 And I, you know, but all I need is a million dollars.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.840
 And I'm like, okay, well, what is your skill?

21:37.840 --> 21:38.840
 And they don't have a skill.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.840
 Right.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.640
 And I'm like, well, are you a designer?

21:41.640 --> 21:42.640
 No.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.640
 Are you a product manager?

21:43.640 --> 21:44.640
 No.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.640
 Are you a developer?

21:45.640 --> 21:46.640
 No.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.640
 Are you a sales executive?

21:47.640 --> 21:48.640
 No.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.840
 So as my friend Sam Harris, I think your friend as well says like, everybody has like

21:53.840 --> 21:55.360
 a million ideas an hour.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
 Like you don't really get credit for those.

21:57.360 --> 22:01.760
 Even when you're asleep, your ideas spewing ideas, like zero credit for your ideas.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
 It's all about execution.

22:02.760 --> 22:07.520
 You have to believe that you yourself can be the core of that execution, you yourself

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
 can build the thing.

22:08.520 --> 22:12.640
 And every, no matter what your circumstances are, I mean, we could talk about like structural

22:12.640 --> 22:17.400
 racism and all those kinds of things that push us down, but from the individual perspective,

22:17.400 --> 22:21.520
 when you just like are coaching or giving advice to an individual, you can literally

22:21.520 --> 22:22.520
 change the world.

22:22.520 --> 22:26.080
 I mean, Wall Street Bets is an indication of that in the financial space that you yourself

22:26.080 --> 22:28.280
 can have, can change the world.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.280
 That's why this country is amazing.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
 Build the best country in the world.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
 Right.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
 I mean, it still is amazing.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.600
 The opportunity provided to people, all this educational experience is online.

22:37.600 --> 22:42.160
 And the ability, what I tell young people who are looking for advice, I say, you know,

22:42.160 --> 22:46.080
 the skill you need to refine is the ability to learn your skills.

22:46.080 --> 22:51.000
 Like if you become good at learning a new skill, and Tim Ferriss, a friend of mine is

22:51.000 --> 22:58.480
 really pioneered this, like he can get to 60 or 70% of like the knowledge in a skill

22:58.480 --> 23:00.200
 in some incredibly short period of time.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.880
 Now I'm not saying he's going to become a virtuoso drummer or a great basketball player,

23:03.880 --> 23:07.920
 but Tim and I were on vacation together in like a group vacation in Italy and there was

23:07.920 --> 23:09.960
 a basketball court.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.680
 And I said, let's go, let's go shoot some hoops.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.080
 I never shoot shop before.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.240
 And I was like, okay, come on, I'll teach you.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.800
 I mean, Tim is fabulously uncoordinated.

23:17.800 --> 23:18.800
 People don't know this.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
 Yes.

23:19.800 --> 23:26.360
 Like he tried to dribble a basketball and do a layup and it looked like he had a blindfold

23:26.360 --> 23:27.360
 on.

23:27.360 --> 23:32.120
 I mean, you've never seen something less elegant than Tim Ferriss doing a layup in basketball.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.800
 And then he watched me do it three or four times.

23:34.800 --> 23:39.440
 And I watched him study me and I listen, I've been playing basketball in Brooklyn since

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
 I was a kid.

23:40.440 --> 23:44.440
 I got a couple of moves and he was just taking notes and taking notes and taking notes and

23:44.440 --> 23:48.800
 by the end of a couple of hours of doing this, I could just watch him checking his form and

23:48.800 --> 23:50.720
 figuring it out.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.880
 That's every skill in the world now.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.520
 And what I tell people is like, I'm like, did you watch Game of Thrones?

23:56.520 --> 23:58.560
 And they're like, yeah, did you watch Breaking Bad?

23:58.560 --> 24:02.960
 Like, yeah, I'm like, okay, that's about 400 hours.

24:02.960 --> 24:06.840
 How about you don't watch the next two and you put that 400 hours into learning how to

24:06.840 --> 24:13.520
 be a graphic designer, a UX person, a developer, whatever it is and learn how to add skills.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.720
 And that's what I did my whole life.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.800
 I was a kid from Brooklyn, went to school at night, but I was very quick to get to maybe

24:18.800 --> 24:24.440
 50% of the knowledge base of graphic design or being a writer or being a sales executive,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.600
 whatever it was, a developer even.

24:26.600 --> 24:31.520
 And I was just good enough to not have people be able to bullshit me like when I hired them.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.600
 And that was a big unlock.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.880
 When you know enough that people can't snow you, that's a really good one.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.680
 And look at yourself, like you figured out how to set up an entire podcast.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.120
 People don't know this, but you don't have a team around you.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.360
 I have a team of like five, six people working on my podcast.

24:45.360 --> 24:50.000
 But if you even know enough about to set this up, you would then be able to hire a team.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
 Correct.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.720
 And you'll be able to call them on their bullshit if they're not doing a good job.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.720
 And that's really important.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.880
 And I don't know that much about this whole thing, but I know enough to be able to then

24:57.880 --> 25:00.040
 see who knows their stuff or not.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.040
 You're absolutely right.

25:01.040 --> 25:08.000
 And the process of learning how to learn is essential there because like I did martial

25:08.000 --> 25:10.200
 arts, jiu jitsu and so on.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.360
 And it's so funny to watch.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.360
 I did take one though, yeah.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.360
 I took one though.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.360
 It was awesome.

25:14.360 --> 25:19.000
 It's funny that there's some people that do an activity for years because just sort

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
 of elaborate on something you were saying about hours.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.640
 It's not always the amount of hours, it's the quality that you put in.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
 Yes.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.680
 Deliberate practice versus just doing some behavior.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.520
 I mean, literally I've been playing chess and trying to get that going again after watching

25:33.520 --> 25:37.480
 Queens Gambit and I got Chess.com and I realized I was just playing and I'm not getting better.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.920
 And then I was like, oh wait, there's a little analysis feature here in Chess.com where we'll

25:40.920 --> 25:43.320
 show you your blunders and mistakes.

25:43.320 --> 25:48.320
 And I'm like, oh, I'm spending no time reviewing my losses in chess and I just want to play

25:48.320 --> 25:49.320
 the next game.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.120
 I should really review these losses and figure out what mistakes I made.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.080
 And when I started doing that, I was like, oh, I'm getting better, right?

25:55.080 --> 25:56.560
 So some deliberate practice really works.

25:56.560 --> 26:01.600
 And if you want to take it all the way, Magnus Carlson, shout out to the guy, he has an app

26:01.600 --> 26:05.000
 but there's a few other coaching apps where you like focus on the end game.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.280
 You focus drilling in particular, you basically don't play the game at all.

26:09.280 --> 26:14.680
 You just focus on drilling the different aspects, the opening, the end game, and there's different

26:14.680 --> 26:15.680
 kinds of puzzles.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.280
 So you can really make it into a deliberate practice.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.360
 Not to make this episode sponsored by Chess.com, but they literally have puzzles.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.040
 So I was like, oh, and it's $100 a year for this product.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.600
 And I just thought to myself, this is capitalism.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.760
 They don't need to charge you $100 an hour for a lesson.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.880
 They can charge you $100 and they've created the ability for you to play chess 24 hours

26:36.880 --> 26:41.680
 a day against opponents who are perfectly matched against you based on your rating.

26:41.680 --> 26:45.200
 And they analyze every game and they have puzzles and they have tutorials and they've

26:45.200 --> 26:46.200
 got everything else.

26:46.200 --> 26:53.440
 It's like, just think about how much value is being provided to society because of capitalism

26:53.440 --> 26:54.560
 and because competition.

26:54.560 --> 26:59.280
 If you want things to get better and you want to step up your game, just make it slightly

26:59.280 --> 27:00.280
 competitive.

27:00.280 --> 27:04.840
 It is one of these things in human existence that is so powerful.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.360
 I don't know, did you see the Michael Jordan documentary, The Last Dance?

27:08.360 --> 27:09.360
 Like half of it.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.360
 Okay.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.360
 I'm still working through it.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.480
 I mean, he's so competitive and petty.

27:14.480 --> 27:21.320
 It's so inspiring that all he cares about is just winning to the level of which he literally,

27:21.320 --> 27:24.040
 there's like this running meme, I took that personally.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.040
 And I took that personally.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.120
 I don't know if you've seen the images of him sitting, smoking a cigar, looking at like

27:28.120 --> 27:31.080
 an iPad or a video clip and it's like, I took that personally.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.960
 And you can make a super cut of every time he took something personally.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.880
 He literally takes everything personally to give himself that competitive motivation to

27:37.880 --> 27:38.880
 win.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.880
 That's capitalism.

27:39.880 --> 27:46.640
 And when people are competing, man, look at what Elon did to the space of cars.

27:46.640 --> 27:51.080
 Like every, they were literally laughing at him in the first 10 years.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.480
 Electric cars, ha ha, that company got a business.

27:53.480 --> 27:59.640
 And now every single company is like, we're going fully electric by 2035 and he kicked

27:59.640 --> 28:05.960
 their asses so brutally that they had no choice but then to step up their game.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.360
 And that's what we want, right?

28:07.360 --> 28:13.000
 And this virus and this pandemic, I think the great thing that will come out of this

28:13.000 --> 28:18.040
 horrible experience that we've all had is psychologically death, learning just so many

28:18.040 --> 28:20.800
 bad things occurred, the economy, people losing their jobs.

28:20.800 --> 28:28.000
 But we also got to see the human spirit with these mRNA vaccines and just how if we took

28:28.000 --> 28:32.280
 out some of the regulation and people were super motivated, we might actually be able

28:32.280 --> 28:38.600
 to eliminate all pandemics from ever happening again.

28:38.600 --> 28:43.640
 And before that, Bill Gates was banging his fist and Jeff Skull was doing the movie Contagion.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.960
 I mean, for two decades, people have been banging their fists.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.720
 We have to be prepared for this.

28:47.720 --> 28:51.000
 And everybody's like, yeah, whatever, YOLO, it's not going to happen.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.840
 And now it's happened and people are like, we need to be able to destroy every pandemic

28:56.840 --> 28:58.480
 and virus before it happens.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.640
 And you're, listen, you know a lot more about science than I do.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.400
 But these mRNA has been around for a while.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.920
 We've just never gotten aggressive about doing it.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.440
 And then you think about challenge trials.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.000
 I don't know if you've been following this, but they're doing challenge trials now in

29:12.000 --> 29:17.560
 the UK this month where they're introducing COVID into healthy young patients and then

29:17.560 --> 29:20.000
 giving them the vaccine.

29:20.000 --> 29:27.280
 And that is against all rules and regulations about, you know, do no harm.

29:27.280 --> 29:31.440
 But then you think about it, we kind of celebrate people jumping out of planes.

29:31.440 --> 29:35.320
 And we got that one guy, Alex Honnold, who's climbing up mountains without a rope and they

29:35.320 --> 29:41.640
 give him a North Star, you know, back page ad and an endorsement deal.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.840
 And we celebrate that.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.960
 We celebrate people surfing with sharks.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.480
 We celebrate people doing deep welding.

29:47.480 --> 29:51.680
 We pay them extra to go 200 feet underground and weld stuff.

29:51.680 --> 29:57.240
 And people do dangerous stuff all day long, astronauts.

29:57.240 --> 30:03.840
 But we won't, soldiers, firefighters, but we won't let people get paid to do a challenge

30:03.840 --> 30:04.840
 trial.

30:04.840 --> 30:05.840
 Yeah.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.280
 We're weirdly risk averse in certain areas that are completely don't make any sense.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.280
 And this is where the world needs to be.

30:10.280 --> 30:14.560
 We could have said these thousand people, young people, who we know are in all likelihood

30:14.560 --> 30:17.360
 not going to have a bad outcome, but there's a possibility.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.360
 There's a possibility.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.360
 But it's very low.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.160
 And it's certainly lower than riding a motorcycle.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.440
 It's lower than riding a motorcycle.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
 People ride motorcycles everywhere.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.240
 We have ads for motorcycles.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.560
 We could have just said to those thousand people, we'll give you a million dollars each

30:29.560 --> 30:30.560
 to do this.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.560
 Okay.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.560
 There's your billion dollars.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.720
 We're printing trillions of dollars of money to deal with this.

30:35.720 --> 30:40.720
 If we had just done a thousand people for a million dollars each to do a challenge trial

30:40.720 --> 30:46.480
 in March, April, May, when they had the mRNA vaccines ready, we could have deployed the

30:46.480 --> 30:47.480
 vaccines in the summer.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.480
 We would have been done with this.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.720
 We would have been over by now.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.720
 So we get to challenge all of the thinking.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.640
 I think that's what the great pause did.

30:54.640 --> 30:58.480
 It's letting everybody challenge that thinking is, why do we have that rule?

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
 Okay.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
 Yeah.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.560
 We don't want to have people give up their organs for money.

31:04.560 --> 31:08.980
 We obviously understand, but there's a reasonable discussion about, well, maybe there's a level

31:08.980 --> 31:10.480
 of risk in a global pandemic.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.720
 I mean, we fought the Nazis, right?

31:12.720 --> 31:13.980
 We defeated the Nazis.

31:13.980 --> 31:15.520
 That took a lot of deaths to do that.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.160
 But we had to kill that evil.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.080
 This is another evil, which we must fight.

31:21.080 --> 31:25.160
 And it's going to result in, it's already resulting in thousands of people dying a day,

31:25.160 --> 31:29.080
 but we could have actually stopped it earlier if we just had a reasonable discussion.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.240
 This is like podcasting, is our respect what you do.

31:31.240 --> 31:36.000
 And this is why intelligent people are so drawn to podcasts, because you and I can expand

31:36.000 --> 31:40.240
 on this and not cancel each other over this very suggestion.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.920
 When I make this suggestion that are challenge trials reasonable or not, if I were to do

31:43.920 --> 31:49.960
 that on Twitter, they'd be like, oh, Callicanus wants to give poor people coronavirus in order

31:49.960 --> 31:50.960
 to save rich people.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.360
 It's like, no, I didn't say that.

31:53.360 --> 31:57.520
 But you and I could have a reasonable discussion about a challenge trial, something we should

31:57.520 --> 32:02.880
 consider in a acute situation where millions of people are going to lose their lives.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
 Right.

32:03.880 --> 32:08.360
 So, you know, that's an example of capitalism and competition working really well.

32:08.360 --> 32:13.280
 There's one of the, to me, sad thing to see about coronavirus is that, for example, testing

32:13.280 --> 32:18.920
 at scale should have, it seems obvious, I was a little clueless about it, but because

32:18.920 --> 32:24.840
 I thought there's no way you can have like antigen tests at hundreds of millions, like

32:24.840 --> 32:27.160
 order hundreds of millions of them and make them cheap.

32:27.160 --> 32:32.040
 But actually, I realized recently that there have been available since about like May,

32:32.040 --> 32:33.040
 you were able to...

32:33.040 --> 32:35.240
 In Korea, in Finland, all over the place.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.040
 You could have done mass manufacture.

32:37.040 --> 32:43.600
 So there, there's a little bit of a failure of capitalism to step up.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.720
 And I don't know if you agree with this, but it seems that the blame is to be placed at

32:47.720 --> 32:52.560
 the regulators and the various institutions.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.880
 Crony capitalism and all likelihood is what stopped it here in America.

32:55.880 --> 33:01.680
 I mean, I had friends who had imported them from other countries, the testing kits, and

33:01.680 --> 33:05.040
 you've probably been to parties where people had these kind of testing kits from other

33:05.040 --> 33:06.040
 countries.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.200
 They're sitting here and they're just approving them now.

33:08.200 --> 33:13.240
 Really in February, month 11 of the pandemic in America, we're going to have testing online.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.240
 Really.

33:14.240 --> 33:20.720
 I mean, even if these tests were 80% effective and they're 95% effective, mass producing them,

33:20.720 --> 33:24.080
 we should have sent them in every postal...

33:24.080 --> 33:28.480
 Anybody with a post office box should have, with a mailing address, should have had 10

33:28.480 --> 33:31.200
 of them put in their mailing address just for free from the government.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.720
 And then everybody would be testing and we would have contained it.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.160
 We don't have test and trace here in the United States.

33:36.160 --> 33:42.600
 All the countries that are on the other side of COVID did it by having testing, tracing,

33:42.600 --> 33:44.800
 and closing their borders and masks.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.960
 That's the combination that works.

33:46.960 --> 33:51.760
 The problem with the coronavirus is while there's a lot of institutions did not behave

33:51.760 --> 33:55.160
 their best, it's also the case that there's a lot of uncertainty.

33:55.160 --> 34:00.800
 So I tend to give a little bit of a pass to everybody involved for the uncertainty.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.800
 We were all...

34:01.800 --> 34:03.920
 I give them that until June.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.800
 I wonder how history will remember this whole period.

34:06.800 --> 34:12.640
 I'd love to ask you, because you were an early investor in Robinhoods, and you're in a very

34:12.640 --> 34:21.760
 nice place of being a huge supporter of the Wall Street bets, kind of distributed power

34:21.760 --> 34:29.800
 of the people, and at the same time, because of you being an investor intellectually giving

34:29.800 --> 34:35.640
 a chance to Robinhood in this kind of chaotic time of conversations to think about, well,

34:35.640 --> 34:36.640
 what did they do right?

34:36.640 --> 34:37.640
 What did they do wrong?

34:37.640 --> 34:38.640
 Yeah.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.400
 So you have a kind of a balanced view on the whole thing, which is really nice.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.400
 Is there...

34:42.400 --> 34:46.520
 We've talked about what Robinhood did right, I think.

34:46.520 --> 34:55.400
 Can you sort of steelman Chamath's argument of what Robinhood did wrong in the last few

34:55.400 --> 34:56.400
 days?

34:56.400 --> 35:01.400
 Yeah, I mean, communication is always the number one issue with these startups, right?

35:01.400 --> 35:07.360
 And if you have to get ahead of any problem, and you have to put all the bad news out immediately.

35:07.360 --> 35:11.160
 And in the case of Robinhood, it seems, based on what has been in the papers and what Robinhood

35:11.160 --> 35:14.720
 said publicly, is that they had this kind of liquidity crisis, right?

35:14.720 --> 35:16.920
 Where they were being...

35:16.920 --> 35:20.200
 Because of these exchanges telling them, you have to put up this amount of money in collateral

35:20.200 --> 35:23.040
 and them being pinned at number one in the app store.

35:23.040 --> 35:27.720
 There were so many people trying to buy five shares of this stock, five shares of this meme

35:27.720 --> 35:30.600
 stock, that it kind of broke their system.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.840
 And then the people who clear the trades for them, they said, you got to put up a billion

35:33.840 --> 35:37.080
 dollars, $2 billion, $3 billion, we can't do that overnight.

35:37.080 --> 35:43.240
 And I think that they were in an uncomfortable situation of going on TV and saying, we have

35:43.240 --> 35:47.120
 a liquidity crisis, like that could be like a run on the bank.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.240
 Everybody then logs in at the same time to Robinhood and tries to sell every share they

35:50.240 --> 35:52.280
 own because they're afraid that the whole thing's going to collapse, right?

35:52.280 --> 35:57.040
 So I think there was this kind of like black swan event and they probably didn't communicate

35:57.040 --> 35:58.240
 at all that well.

35:58.240 --> 36:03.880
 At the center of that, this is really interesting, maybe you can comment on the nature of communication.

36:03.880 --> 36:10.200
 Vlad the CEO, the guy you met at the bar, I think at the center of the communication,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.200
 right?

36:11.200 --> 36:14.800
 So Elon is an example of a guy who also is at the center of the communication for his

36:14.800 --> 36:16.520
 particular set of companies.

36:16.520 --> 36:20.720
 And that on Twitter seems to be a really powerful way to communicate.

36:20.720 --> 36:26.720
 And there was something, this is me saying it, there was something about Vlad that sounded

36:26.720 --> 36:29.920
 like he's hiding stuff.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.920
 As opposed to Elon, it doesn't sound like he's hiding stuff.

36:33.920 --> 36:38.680
 It could be the nature, the beat, the timing of the conversation.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.360
 Same thing with Mark Zuckerberg.

36:40.360 --> 36:44.200
 Mark Zuckerberg for some reason often sounds like he's hiding something.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.200
 And then there's like Jack Dorsey is much less so.

36:47.200 --> 36:52.040
 And I don't know what that is about the CEOs that makes you trust them and not.

36:52.040 --> 36:58.880
 Might be the point in time, like in terms of escape velocity.

36:58.880 --> 37:03.280
 There might be non disclosures in place that we're not aware of where they're not allowed

37:03.280 --> 37:04.640
 to talk about certain relationships.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.640
 I see.

37:05.640 --> 37:11.680
 And that results like in Vlad's case, and that results in you being like acting weird

37:11.680 --> 37:13.360
 or nervous or nervous.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.320
 Yeah, it could just be the person is nervous.

37:15.320 --> 37:20.040
 So it's really hard to be building one of these companies and you're at scale and, you

37:20.040 --> 37:24.600
 know, oh my Lord, the entire thing's coming apart and you're the most hated person for

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
 that day.

37:25.600 --> 37:30.440
 You know how the rage cycle works and the media is just so crazy when they get their

37:30.440 --> 37:31.440
 hooks into something.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.520
 I saw it happen with Uber.

37:32.520 --> 37:37.240
 We saw it happen with Facebook and even Tesla, you know, there were times when people did

37:37.240 --> 37:41.760
 stupid things with autopilot and it's like, okay, somebody's watching a movie and sleeping

37:41.760 --> 37:46.720
 in their car or leaving the driver's seat against all the rules of autopilot and somehow

37:46.720 --> 37:48.000
 Tesla's responsible for that.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.600
 It's like, we have people who stand on top of their motorcycles and drive down the road

37:51.600 --> 37:57.440
 on a motorcycle and we don't blame Yamaha or Harley Davidson for some idiot standing

37:57.440 --> 37:59.880
 on the seat of their motorcycle on a highway going 60 miles an hour.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.120
 We just say, that person's an idiot.

38:02.120 --> 38:07.800
 But when new technology comes out, we blame the technology, not the person operating it.

38:07.800 --> 38:13.720
 And if you are going to operate, we basically vilify and indemnize and I think that that

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
 is part of it.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.280
 Like when the person at, I remember Airbnb, we always thought, what if somebody trashes

38:18.280 --> 38:19.780
 your apartment?

38:19.780 --> 38:23.120
 And then sure enough, a bunch of methads rented this poor woman's apartment.

38:23.120 --> 38:27.440
 She left all of her stuff in it and then a bunch of methads had a drug party, destroyed

38:27.440 --> 38:31.440
 her apartment, ripped up all her photos and went crazy.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.480
 And we knew that day would happen, but nobody remembers it now, but it was the number one

38:34.480 --> 38:38.880
 story on every news channel because wow, that's an exciting story.

38:38.880 --> 38:43.960
 And I just thought to myself, I wonder if there are any parties in hotel rooms where

38:43.960 --> 38:47.400
 the hotel rooms being trashed and people are doing drugs and crazy things.

38:47.400 --> 38:52.160
 It's like, yes, that's basically every hotel in Los Angeles right now is being destroyed

38:52.160 --> 38:55.320
 by some rock band that's throwing a TV out the window.

38:55.320 --> 38:59.880
 Like we expected in a hotel, we just didn't expect it in somebody's house with Airbnb

38:59.880 --> 39:05.440
 and then Airbnb created rules around, you can't rent an Airbnb for a party and they learn.

39:05.440 --> 39:09.760
 So I think there's a learning curve with these companies and they do get to scale at a level

39:09.760 --> 39:11.240
 that is unprecedented.

39:11.240 --> 39:15.200
 It used to take decades for a company to become an international phenomenon.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.400
 Now it happens in two, three, four years.

39:17.400 --> 39:22.120
 I mean, look at clubhouse, this thing went from being a private beta six months ago to

39:22.120 --> 39:28.080
 being the number one app in Germany and in Japan and here, just like that, boom.

39:28.080 --> 39:32.440
 And it's because there's an ecosystem that has never existed, the app store.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.800
 Then there's payments online.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.120
 And then everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket.

39:38.120 --> 39:45.240
 When we, the thing people got wrong about entrepreneurship, technology and business over the last couple

39:45.240 --> 39:53.240
 of decades was just how big the market was and then how quickly you could achieve relevancy

39:53.240 --> 39:55.480
 in these markets.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.480
 We thought the market was like the 60 million homes were broadband and originally it was

39:59.480 --> 40:00.480
 like maybe 10 or 20.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.480
 Then it became 60 million.

40:01.480 --> 40:05.120
 Then it was like, okay, well, how many hours are you at your desktop computer?

40:05.120 --> 40:08.760
 Well, like probably at our computers for five hours a day, 10 hours a day at work, three

40:08.760 --> 40:10.520
 hours a day on our own.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.680
 And then I was like, yeah, nobody's on their desktop computer.

40:12.680 --> 40:13.880
 Everybody's on their mobile phone.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.560
 And oh, and by the way, they have it with them.

40:15.560 --> 40:20.360
 So the people with mobile phones are now using this high speed device with an app store,

40:20.360 --> 40:21.360
 with their credit card in it.

40:21.360 --> 40:25.080
 And the early days of the internet, people were scared to put their credit card on the

40:25.080 --> 40:26.080
 internet.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.080
 That was considered a really dumb thing to do.

40:27.080 --> 40:30.360
 If you put your credit card on the internet, you're going to lose all your money.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.760
 They're going to hack you or whatever.

40:32.760 --> 40:38.160
 And now it's just amazing to me how quickly when a company hits, how quickly it can get

40:38.160 --> 40:42.200
 to a million subscribers or 10 million or a billion users, right?

40:42.200 --> 40:46.760
 And there's all these networks, like social networks that allow the spread of the viral

40:46.760 --> 40:52.560
 spread of like a new startup, a new company, a new app to be announced.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.560
 Anything.

40:53.560 --> 40:54.560
 An idea.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.560
 Yeah.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.120
 A single meme could change the world.

40:58.120 --> 41:02.720
 Speaking of clubhouse, I just want to, we're saying so many interesting things, but there

41:02.720 --> 41:05.560
 was a magical moment with Vlad and Elon on clubhouse.

41:05.560 --> 41:06.560
 That was wild.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.560
 Yes.

41:07.560 --> 41:16.240
 Do you have thoughts about that interaction, which felt like so many aspects of this whole

41:16.240 --> 41:23.880
 situation feels like it's totally novel, surreal, like it's defining a new era, like a billionaire,

41:23.880 --> 41:31.720
 the richest human on earth is interviewing the person at the center of one of the most

41:31.720 --> 41:38.920
 interesting mass scale, like power battles in finance ever, perhaps.

41:38.920 --> 41:43.520
 And by the way, seven movies have been sold in two weeks.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.320
 Just think about how fast things are moving, Lex.

41:46.320 --> 41:51.440
 This thing happens, like people had the idea to short the stock six months ago.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.600
 They start doing their research.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.360
 They build an army, they execute the trade.

41:55.360 --> 42:01.640
 The system goes down, Robin Hood raises $3.5 billion in four days, Elon is interviewing

42:01.640 --> 42:04.560
 them on clubhouse on Sunday after the Wednesday it happened.

42:04.560 --> 42:08.200
 And now here we are, it's 10 days later.

42:08.200 --> 42:12.120
 Doesn't it feel like it's been 10 months?

42:12.120 --> 42:13.280
 It's been 10 days, Lex.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.280
 It's been 10 days.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.280
 10 days.

42:15.280 --> 42:18.600
 Plus there's like a new president, all these things that, and everyone forgot, like what?

42:18.600 --> 42:19.600
 It was an insurrection.

42:19.600 --> 42:25.200
 By the way, we also have a revolution at the Capitol where a bunch of crazy people who

42:25.200 --> 42:31.880
 have guns and body armor, and then a bunch of them who are just yoloing in cosplay took

42:31.880 --> 42:32.880
 over the Capitol.

42:32.880 --> 42:36.240
 Well, so, and the other more dramatic thing to me is that was one month ago.

42:36.240 --> 42:40.960
 That was one month and the president of the United States got banned from every major

42:40.960 --> 42:48.520
 social network, and which I think I'm still deeply troubled by is Parler being removed

42:48.520 --> 42:49.920
 from AWS.

42:49.920 --> 42:56.560
 That changed the way I, that changed a lot of things as somebody who's an aspiring entrepreneur.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.480
 That changed the way I see the world.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.520
 That little, maybe I'm being overdramatic, but no, you're not.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.960
 I think you're paranoid for a reason.

43:03.960 --> 43:09.000
 You're paranoid for a very good reason, which is as big as these companies can become, they

43:09.000 --> 43:10.960
 are beholden to the mob.

43:10.960 --> 43:15.960
 And if the mob says, Hey, this person needs to be canceled, they're going to get canceled

43:15.960 --> 43:20.040
 because you can't lose your entire audience, you can lose your whole customer base, and

43:20.040 --> 43:21.600
 you can lose all your employees.

43:21.600 --> 43:26.320
 I think what's interesting about your fear about Parler and AWS taking off is we went

43:26.320 --> 43:30.720
 from being like a social network, which is the software layer.

43:30.720 --> 43:36.280
 And then we went to like the infrastructure layer, and they'll even go after like Cloudflare,

43:36.280 --> 43:37.760
 which is a CDN provider.

43:37.760 --> 43:41.760
 They're just like a plumbing, it's like sort of like the telephone.

43:41.760 --> 43:46.040
 So we're basically holding everybody responsible on the whole chain of events here.

43:46.040 --> 43:52.280
 And what that's going to do is, I'm not a huge believer in crypto, but distributed computing,

43:52.280 --> 43:58.800
 where nobody and decentralized and distributed computing platforms and open standards, podcasting

43:58.800 --> 43:59.840
 is an open standard.

43:59.840 --> 44:07.440
 The web is an open standard, FTP was an open standard, but Twitter and Facebook are closed.

44:07.440 --> 44:11.920
 And what's going to happen is we will see a group of individuals create peer to peer

44:11.920 --> 44:15.320
 networks for social media, where nobody can control it.

44:15.320 --> 44:22.400
 And the same for cloud computing, where there's a crypto project where everybody will, and

44:22.400 --> 44:27.720
 I invested in a company that tried to do this and got sold and didn't work out, but take

44:27.720 --> 44:33.200
 your hard drive on your computer at home, you give a terabyte of your 10 terabyte drive

44:33.200 --> 44:34.600
 over to the cloud.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.280
 And then everybody else does their terabyte, and then all of a sudden you've got this virtual

44:37.280 --> 44:41.280
 cloud, and anybody can store stuff on it, and it's all encrypted, and then nobody can

44:41.280 --> 44:42.280
 stop it.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.720
 And that could be tweets, it could be videos.

44:43.720 --> 44:49.280
 And so this idea that YouTube will be able to tell people, kick people off because they're

44:49.280 --> 44:55.880
 skeptics of, I don't know, the pandemic or the vaccine, or they'll make things that are

44:55.880 --> 44:57.160
 more censorship resistant.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.200
 I think that'll be the reaction to all of this.

44:59.200 --> 45:04.160
 This is my question for you, going back to that crappy bar and people pitching you.

45:04.160 --> 45:10.480
 Is there, like with Clubhouse, do you see competitors, do you think it's possible that

45:10.480 --> 45:15.560
 another, perhaps more decentralized, or another kind of social media will emerge that will

45:15.560 --> 45:19.400
 take on Twitter and Facebook and might be able to replace them?

45:19.400 --> 45:25.080
 If you look at the whole landscape, with Clubhouse and everything else, do you think some other

45:25.080 --> 45:26.600
 company might emerge?

45:26.600 --> 45:28.280
 There'll be 10 versions of Clubhouse.

45:28.280 --> 45:31.920
 We looked at social networking, we thought Friendster was it.

45:31.920 --> 45:35.360
 Like Friendster was so good, nobody be able to compete with that, it was growing so quickly.

45:35.360 --> 45:39.160
 And then MySpace was a juggernaut, and they hit 100 million in revenue and 100 million

45:39.160 --> 45:40.160
 users.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.160
 And it was like, well, that's game over.

45:41.160 --> 45:46.520
 And then Facebook and LinkedIn and Snapchat and FriendFeed and countless others.

45:46.520 --> 45:52.800
 So there's usually 20 people who will win in a category, and 80% of the charity glory

45:52.800 --> 45:55.240
 will be owned by the top two or three players.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.520
 But will those players change, do you think?

45:57.520 --> 45:58.520
 What's your sense?

45:58.520 --> 45:59.520
 Oh yeah, for sure.

45:59.520 --> 46:03.160
 If Facebook hadn't bought Instagram, it would be a company in decline right now.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.640
 People would be shorting the stock, right?

46:04.640 --> 46:08.720
 Facebook peaked and then was sort of heading down, and Instagram saved them and WhatsApp

46:08.720 --> 46:09.720
 saved them.

46:09.720 --> 46:13.640
 So that's another kind of weird moment in history that they were able to accumulate

46:13.640 --> 46:16.200
 that much power and consolidate that much power.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.200
 Instagram should have never sold to them.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.200
 That should have gone public.

46:18.200 --> 46:22.840
 They had just raised money from Sequoia, and they had raised $50 million at a $500

46:22.840 --> 46:24.960
 million valuation, and they didn't need to sell.

46:24.960 --> 46:27.200
 And that was a big mistake to sell.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.680
 They should have kept going, and it should have took on Facebook.

46:29.680 --> 46:33.040
 And if Instagram was a standalone company right now, it'd be worth $500 million.

46:33.040 --> 46:37.800
 Do you think Facebook might buy Clubhouse?

46:37.800 --> 46:40.120
 They'll probably copy it.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.800
 Zuckerberg has no moral compass or ethics or anything.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.320
 He's a marauder.

46:45.320 --> 46:50.840
 He basically copied Snapchat seven times, like he did poke, and he just kept trying and trying

46:50.840 --> 46:51.840
 and trying.

46:51.840 --> 46:55.520
 Part of the reason why the WhatsApp founders and the Instagram founders left is they found

46:55.520 --> 46:59.840
 Zuckerberg so distasteful in terms of his ability to copy.

46:59.840 --> 47:02.600
 What do you think makes a great leader in that sense?

47:02.600 --> 47:05.040
 Because, okay, so when I look at Zuckerberg...

47:05.040 --> 47:07.000
 He's a great executor.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
 Is he a great executor?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.080
 I don't think he's a great leader.

47:09.080 --> 47:13.040
 I was bullish on, I was excited about Facebook in the very early days.

47:13.040 --> 47:17.000
 I thought it was an exciting opportunity to connect people, and stuff started going wrong

47:17.000 --> 47:19.120
 in certain kinds of ways.

47:19.120 --> 47:25.120
 And again, maybe it's our human nature, but I attribute a lot of that to the leadership.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
 Absolutely.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.120
 And...

47:27.120 --> 47:30.600
 I mean, the guy started it because he was unable to ask girls if they were single and

47:30.600 --> 47:31.600
 on a date.

47:31.600 --> 47:32.600
 I mean, that was as explicit.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.600
 That could be a good motivator.

47:33.600 --> 47:34.600
 That could be a good motivator.

47:34.600 --> 47:39.600
 Well, I mean, the motivation of 18, 19 year old men is pretty clear.

47:39.600 --> 47:40.600
 He was just trying.

47:40.600 --> 47:41.600
 He had no game.

47:41.600 --> 47:47.360
 He had no game, and he needed to know who was single so he could at least have a shot

47:47.360 --> 47:48.360
 at getting a date.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.360
 It's a little creepy.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.360
 It's a little creepy, yeah.

47:50.360 --> 47:55.520
 I think was so obsessed with engagement and winning, and he's kind of like one of those

47:55.520 --> 47:58.760
 friends you have who's just really good at playing a video game, but maybe doesn't see

47:58.760 --> 48:00.360
 the bigger picture in life.

48:00.360 --> 48:04.160
 And I mean, there's a reason why everybody who worked for him hates him and doesn't talk

48:04.160 --> 48:06.200
 to him anymore and then actively derides him.

48:06.200 --> 48:07.480
 Like, there's so many.

48:07.480 --> 48:14.000
 The people who sold WhatsApp to him then backed other projects like Telegram and said horrible

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
 things about him on the way out.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.280
 These are the people he made billionaires, and they really don't like him.

48:19.280 --> 48:23.800
 So I think there is something that he does that does not breed loyalty, but he's very

48:23.800 --> 48:27.320
 successful in his focus, which is growth is all that matters.

48:27.320 --> 48:28.320
 He's a marauder.

48:28.320 --> 48:32.840
 And taking friction out of products and processes is the playbook of Silicon Valley for the

48:32.840 --> 48:34.440
 last decade or two.

48:34.440 --> 48:35.440
 So whatever the friction is.

48:35.440 --> 48:36.440
 That's poetry what you're saying.

48:36.440 --> 48:40.600
 And also, you're speaking so fast that I almost forget that you're dropping bombs.

48:40.600 --> 48:45.320
 But so removing the, removing friction, and you're saying Facebook is exceptionally good

48:45.320 --> 48:46.320
 at removing friction.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.320
 He was the best at it.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.840
 And at Uber, they were like, we're going to take out tipping.

48:50.840 --> 48:54.640
 We're going to take out the need for you to take out your credit card and do payment.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.400
 It's just going to be in your wallet.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.680
 You got picked up.

48:57.680 --> 48:58.680
 You leave.

48:58.680 --> 48:59.680
 That's it.

48:59.680 --> 49:00.680
 And I was like, we should have tipping.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.880
 And they're like, it adds a step and we're trying to have no steps.

49:03.880 --> 49:07.760
 You put your address in, you click the button, and you do nothing else.

49:07.760 --> 49:11.360
 And so we've been obsessed here in Silicon Valley is how many clicks can we take out

49:11.360 --> 49:12.360
 of the process?

49:12.360 --> 49:14.200
 I guess Amazon is incredible at that as well.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.200
 Absolutely.

49:15.200 --> 49:16.200
 One click was the start of it.

49:16.200 --> 49:19.880
 Then you look at Clubhouse as an example, you open Clubhouse and you see rooms.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.880
 You click on it.

49:20.880 --> 49:21.880
 You're listening.

49:21.880 --> 49:23.080
 So in one click, you're listening.

49:23.080 --> 49:27.040
 And then in one click, if you raise your hand or you get invited and you say, yes, you're

49:27.040 --> 49:28.040
 speaking.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.520
 So it's two clicks to speak, one click to listen.

49:30.520 --> 49:31.520
 Yeah.

49:31.520 --> 49:35.640
 I mean, the only way they could make that app work even faster is if you opened it up and

49:35.640 --> 49:42.000
 your microphone was turned on and you, which is kind of scary, but that is the next evolution.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.040
 And what happens when you go that fast is you get unintended consequences.

49:46.040 --> 49:49.560
 And so this is why Facebook has had more fines than any company in the history of Silicon

49:49.560 --> 49:50.560
 Valley.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.320
 It's just giant fines for doing stuff like this.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.520
 And one of them was, I don't know if you remember when they created groups or if you

49:55.520 --> 50:01.520
 have a group for your podcast, but you can just add people to a group without their permission.

50:01.520 --> 50:05.080
 And there was this famous case when they first came out with it.

50:05.080 --> 50:10.240
 Somebody created a Nambla fake group, National Man Love Boy Association or whatever, like

50:10.240 --> 50:15.720
 an affiliate association and they added Zuckerberg, Mike Arrington, myself and like 20 other famous

50:15.720 --> 50:17.280
 people in Silicon Valley.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.560
 And I was like, and then somebody takes a screenshot of it and they're like, you're

50:19.560 --> 50:20.560
 in Nambla?

50:20.560 --> 50:25.800
 And I'm like, no, Facebook, then Zuckerberg's response was, well, if your friends put you

50:25.800 --> 50:30.960
 in that Nambla group, you should get new friends and it was like, you got put in there too.

50:30.960 --> 50:35.640
 And then the sad part about it was there were a group of young men who were gay and who

50:35.640 --> 50:40.160
 were in college and there was a gay choir in their college and the person who was coordinating

50:40.160 --> 50:42.760
 their Facebook group added them.

50:42.760 --> 50:46.680
 So Zuckerberg, it wasn't enough for Zuckerberg to make it so anybody could add anybody to

50:46.680 --> 50:49.800
 any group because it will grow faster.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.600
 Let alone you have to confirm you want to be added to the group.

50:52.600 --> 50:57.040
 What it also did was posted it on their walls to increase engagement.

50:57.040 --> 51:01.160
 And what they inadvertently did was they outed a bunch of 18, 19 year olds in college to

51:01.160 --> 51:06.720
 their families because they joined the gay man's choir at some college.

51:06.720 --> 51:11.000
 And this is the kind of way, you know, this is where Silicon Valley needs to check itself

51:11.000 --> 51:16.800
 and to do better is you have to really think, well, there is my incentive to grow faster

51:16.800 --> 51:19.680
 and then there's what's right for society and for the individuals, you got to think

51:19.680 --> 51:20.880
 it through.

51:20.880 --> 51:21.880
 Think it through.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.920
 It's sometimes very difficult.

51:23.920 --> 51:29.600
 This is where vision is required to anticipate the unintended consequences.

51:29.600 --> 51:33.080
 It seems like Mark Zuckerberg is not very good at that.

51:33.080 --> 51:39.560
 We've talked to so many great leaders in this world privately and publicly.

51:39.560 --> 51:43.360
 What do you think makes a great leader of these tech companies?

51:43.360 --> 51:45.320
 Do you have an example?

51:45.320 --> 51:47.480
 Is Elon to you a great leader?

51:47.480 --> 51:49.240
 He's also a controversial one, right?

51:49.240 --> 51:54.440
 There's a love and hate, a controversial in the sense that there is, and I know a lot

51:54.440 --> 52:00.600
 of people work with him for him, that there's also a love hate relationship.

52:00.600 --> 52:05.720
 The hate comes from the fact that they get pushed extremely hard.

52:05.720 --> 52:12.320
 It's a very competitive environment, but it's a positive one because there's a vision that's

52:12.320 --> 52:13.320
 underlying.

52:13.320 --> 52:18.360
 It's similar to the Steve Jobs thing and it has to do with the, back to our Michael Jordan

52:18.360 --> 52:26.360
 discussion as well, that there seems to be the demons involved in tension and just anxiety,

52:26.360 --> 52:27.920
 all those kinds of things.

52:27.920 --> 52:34.480
 If you want to do great things, there will be some suffering and there'll be some pain

52:34.480 --> 52:37.640
 and it's not easy if you want to change the world.

52:37.640 --> 52:41.680
 Some people have this expectation that it's going to be easy.

52:41.680 --> 52:47.600
 What you'll typically find for any great leader who's trying to do something super ambitious,

52:47.600 --> 52:52.480
 if you're a rich guy and you start a restaurant and you don't care about making money and

52:52.480 --> 52:55.920
 people have made restaurants before, you could be high fives and everybody could love you

52:55.920 --> 52:57.760
 or whatever.

52:57.760 --> 53:00.120
 If you want to change the world, you want to do something hard driving, there's going

53:00.120 --> 53:02.640
 to be sacrifice involved.

53:02.640 --> 53:08.880
 The problem is people are looking at something that is an Olympic caliber sport or a Navy

53:08.880 --> 53:10.600
 Seals like effort.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.720
 In other words, an effort that requires massive sacrifice.

53:13.720 --> 53:17.600
 We would not look at somebody who wins a gold medal like Michael Phelps and say, oh my

53:17.600 --> 53:22.480
 god, he had to get up at 4 a.m. every day and he had to swim and he had to do an ice bath.

53:22.480 --> 53:26.160
 Oh my god, that poor guy, he suffered, he was tortured.

53:26.160 --> 53:30.160
 People were super mean to him, they put him in an ice bath, it was like, no, he wanted

53:30.160 --> 53:34.560
 to be the greatest swimmer of all time and he knew what the sacrifice entailed.

53:34.560 --> 53:40.360
 What happens in work, in business, is that people conflate like, oh, well, I went to

53:40.360 --> 53:47.640
 work to make a living to pay my bills versus Michael Phelps approach to getting gold medals

53:47.640 --> 53:50.840
 or Michael Jordan or pick the person, Elon or Jeff Bezos.

53:50.840 --> 53:55.520
 When you look at the reviews of a place like Amazon, there was this incredible story in

53:55.520 --> 53:59.600
 the New York Times where people were, I don't know if you remember it, this is the worst

53:59.600 --> 54:02.000
 place you could ever work, Amazon.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.440
 We talked to 200 people and they all told us, they all described for us in the New York

54:06.440 --> 54:12.320
 Times a culture of cutthroatness and brutality that has never before been seen and then you

54:12.320 --> 54:16.600
 see all these people who worked for Bezos for 24 years from when they graduated with

54:16.600 --> 54:24.920
 their MBAs until today and they've never left the company and they are ride or die forever.

54:24.920 --> 54:31.520
 What you're seeing there is there's a mismatch of people going to work in an extreme sport

54:31.520 --> 54:34.480
 or an extreme endeavor who should not do that.

54:34.480 --> 54:39.560
 There are people who should go out into the rice fields and pick rice and then there's

54:39.560 --> 54:46.480
 another group of people who are samurai and who wield a sword and who take on missions

54:46.480 --> 54:48.480
 that are dangerous.

54:48.480 --> 54:53.280
 But if you're a rice picker and that's what you do and you feel safe just getting a couple

54:53.280 --> 54:58.120
 of grains of rice, put them in a basket, cleaning it and then whatever, that's valid work, no

54:58.120 --> 55:03.000
 big deal, I'm not deriding it, I'm sort of, but that is one group and then there's people

55:03.000 --> 55:08.960
 who are samurai and you cannot conflate the two, you cannot compare the two and that's

55:08.960 --> 55:10.880
 what is happening right now in business.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.920
 Whenever you see these stories about this person at this company is a tyrant and they're

55:14.920 --> 55:20.240
 so horrible and they yelled at somebody, if you're in the field and you're taking the

55:20.240 --> 55:25.080
 beach at Normandy and it's D day or you got to take the hill or you got to whack Osama

55:25.080 --> 55:30.200
 bin Laden and you're the Navy SEALs and a rudder gets knocked off the back of the Black

55:30.200 --> 55:36.760
 Hawk, this is serious shit, don't do it if you're not serious and if you're not serious

55:36.760 --> 55:39.560
 about changing the world, why would you go work for Bezos?

55:39.560 --> 55:41.000
 Why would you go work for Elon Musk?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.200
 Don't do it, don't go work there.

55:44.200 --> 55:50.880
 This is, let me just sit back and enjoy the beauty of all that, that's music to my ears

55:50.880 --> 55:57.240
 but I'm not sure what to do with it because it's conflicting to a lot of the things I

55:57.240 --> 56:03.680
 hear from the way you're supposed to kind of act and I think in order to do great things

56:03.680 --> 56:08.800
 you have to, I always admired people that lose their shit a little bit because they're

56:08.800 --> 56:16.000
 so passionate and apologizing and all those kinds of things but there's a tension, there's

56:16.000 --> 56:24.160
 a drama to the creative process when especially in the early startup, this is not like the

56:24.160 --> 56:27.560
 work life balance idea, it doesn't even apply.

56:27.560 --> 56:31.280
 Work life balance, ridiculous, it's a ridiculous concept.

56:31.280 --> 56:35.040
 The idea that there's work life balance in a startup is ridiculous, if you're looking

56:35.040 --> 56:39.800
 for work life balance, do not go to a startup or any kind of ambitious company.

56:39.800 --> 56:46.560
 There is a series of places you can work in the world where you do not need to do anything

56:46.560 --> 56:52.240
 more than what's put in front of you and you just put the round peg in the round hole

56:52.240 --> 57:00.120
 and the square peg in the square hole and you go home and you get your little bits and

57:00.120 --> 57:03.560
 grains of rice and you go heat them up and eat them, that's it.

57:03.560 --> 57:07.760
 And there's this other thing which is the extreme pursuit of changing the world and

57:07.760 --> 57:14.400
 sacrificing and we have a generation of people, multi generations of people who are soft,

57:14.400 --> 57:15.400
 they're just soft.

57:15.400 --> 57:19.640
 I mean, what is the big struggle we've had to deal with in America in our lifetimes,

57:19.640 --> 57:23.400
 like 9 11 and we didn't have the Vietnam war and then we had this like weird Iraq wars

57:23.400 --> 57:27.600
 and Middle East wars that were kind of like a small number of people went and we sent

57:27.600 --> 57:30.640
 drones like we have not had to sacrifice.

57:30.640 --> 57:36.480
 Latin Xers, maybe the talent of boomers experienced the Vietnam war regrettably, but we've had

57:36.480 --> 57:40.800
 a couple of generations now, three I guess, that just haven't had to suffer.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.840
 And so we're soft as Americans, we're soft.

57:42.840 --> 57:46.080
 And then you look at people in China and we're like, oh my God, these poor Chinese people

57:46.080 --> 57:51.840
 are living in these tiny cramped apartments like they were living in like essentially

57:51.840 --> 57:57.720
 lean twos in northern China with no running water or like one spigot of ice cold water

57:57.720 --> 58:02.440
 for the entire village, like they're thrilled to be joining the middle class, even if it's

58:02.440 --> 58:04.680
 the bottom of the middle class, right?

58:04.680 --> 58:08.800
 They've taken hundreds of millions of people in China and moved them into the middle class.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.520
 And we're like, oh my God, these people are suffering.

58:10.520 --> 58:14.960
 It's like, you know, they're up to $4 an hour, $3 or $4 an hour in the factories there.

58:14.960 --> 58:20.360
 And they were just two decades ago at, you know, I don't know, it was probably 50 cents

58:20.360 --> 58:22.720
 an hour, something crazy like that.

58:22.720 --> 58:26.560
 And now they've improved the quality of life there so much.

58:26.560 --> 58:29.200
 It's like America did 200 years ago or 100 years ago.

58:29.200 --> 58:33.720
 They've improved it so much in China that now they're getting outpriced for factories from

58:33.720 --> 58:37.240
 Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India.

58:37.240 --> 58:41.280
 And people are moving and people in China are moving the factories out of China into

58:41.280 --> 58:47.040
 other countries because the Chinese are now outsourcing to Vietnam and other countries.

58:47.040 --> 58:50.960
 So this is the way of the world, you know, people move up and they get a better lot in

58:50.960 --> 58:52.080
 life for their families.

58:52.080 --> 58:55.640
 And just in America, we've gotten soft and there's a generation.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.520
 How do people die in America now?

58:57.520 --> 59:04.520
 Suicide, obesity, heart attacks, anxiety, I mean, we're suffering from things that if

59:04.520 --> 59:09.480
 you told people 100 years ago that the number, the top ways Americans would die would be

59:09.480 --> 59:13.680
 overeating and suicide, they'd be like, what?

59:13.680 --> 59:15.880
 You're literally killing yourself or eating yourself to death.

59:15.880 --> 59:17.400
 That's what's happening in America.

59:17.400 --> 59:22.080
 And when everybody, not everybody unmasked, there's a large number of people who've become

59:22.080 --> 59:27.040
 softer and softer, capitalism creates an environment where there's people that still

59:27.040 --> 59:32.600
 step up amidst that with a big dream and challenge the conventions and that human spirit just

59:32.600 --> 59:40.880
 arise above that is Elon's example, that Jeff Bezos example, and they push, you know,

59:40.880 --> 59:45.400
 the limits of those of human beings that are willing to step up.

59:45.400 --> 59:54.200
 And you know, I think about sort of how to create a company that amidst all of the softness

59:54.200 --> 59:56.960
 still creates a revolution.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.560
 It doesn't seem trivial.

59:58.560 --> 1:00:07.200
 It seems like how do you build a culture that's once healthy, but also unhealthy in the way

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:09.160
 that an Olympic pursuit is?

1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:10.320
 It's all top down.

1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:13.800
 Everybody just, you asked earlier what leadership was and I never answered the question.

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:18.040
 I think, you know, what leaders do is they set the example, they set the bar.

1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:22.760
 And if you look at someone like Elon, you know, we're personal friends for 20 years,

1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:24.760
 and he is indefatigable.

1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:30.560
 Like, I mean, the guy has a stamina that is just phenomenal, like he does not get tired,

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:36.360
 he works relentlessly, and he sets that standard for the rest of the team.

1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:40.720
 And I think, you know, Bezos is very sharp and likes to debate stuff and is very, you

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:46.160
 know, and Jobs was just incredible at design and figuring out how to bridge that gap.

1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:48.960
 So they just, leaders set the standard.

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:50.400
 They set the standard.

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:53.880
 And you know that your time is over as a leader when you can't set the standard.

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:55.760
 And that's when you have to pass the baton, right?

1:00:55.760 --> 1:00:56.760
 And Bezos did that.

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:57.760
 Brilliant.

1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:02.920
 And Bezos now is saying, you know what, I'm 57, I'm the richest guy on the planet, depending

1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:04.240
 on the week.

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.760
 And I would like to do some other challenges, but I don't want to grind it out at Amazon

1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:10.240
 for another 25 years.

1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:11.480
 I want to do other things.

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:13.280
 And so he passed the baton.

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:15.280
 And that's the healthy thing to do in that regard.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:18.960
 I do think there is a time period in which you can run that hot.

1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:22.560
 And then at a certain point, you have to then change, just like an athlete might go to be

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:25.920
 a coach, right, or a commentator.

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:29.560
 And so, you know, being an entrepreneur is brutal.

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:33.160
 It's, you know, seven days a week, 12 hours a day, anybody who says anything differently

1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:38.360
 is kidding themselves, you're going to have to sacrifice in this competition.

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:40.000
 And America has to fight.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:46.880
 If America does not win capitalism, and China does, it is literally the end of the human

1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.280
 species.

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:49.880
 It's over for humanity.

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:53.920
 Right now, everything has been going really well in terms of the number of people living

1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:56.400
 in poverty is plummeting.

1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:02.120
 Life, you know, lifespans have been rising, science is booming, the economy is booming.

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:03.120
 All these things are incredible.

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.960
 The one thing that's kind of stagnant right now is the number of people living in democracy

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:09.560
 versus under authoritarian rule.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.560
 It's flat.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:13.920
 So, when you look at all Steve Pinker's charts and he's really excited, there's one you're

1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:14.920
 going to see that's flat.

1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:20.360
 And I think we peaked with 53 or 54% of people on the planet Earth being in a democracy and

1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:22.560
 now it's going below 50.

1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:26.960
 And it's because some of the democratic, you know, Western countries don't have the population

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.760
 growth of some of the communist and socialist countries and authoritarian countries.

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.120
 And we have to make sure that we win capitalism.

1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:38.440
 We must win economically.

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:39.600
 That is the battlefield.

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:43.560
 The battlefield is science, technology and money and economy, finance.

1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:44.560
 That's the battlefield.

1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:47.520
 China wins, authoritarians win.

1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:52.840
 And at any time, Xi Jinping can pull Jack Ma into a room and say, it's time for you

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:57.920
 to be reeducated or they can put three or four million people, Uyghurs, into prison camps

1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:03.480
 and say, you know what, this religious thing, that's counter to what is productive for us.

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:07.080
 Therefore, we're going to shave your heads and we're going to have you literally pick

1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:08.240
 cotton in the fields.

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:15.640
 They have Uyghurs with no sense of any kind of arc of history in the fields picking cotton

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:22.000
 as slaves in what can only be described by every humanitarian organization as a concentration

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.880
 camp and every Jewish person I know takes great offense when somebody uses the Holocaust

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:29.600
 as a metaphor, except in the case of the Uyghurs right now.

1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:33.600
 And every Jewish person I've talked to has said to me, that is a Holocaust.

1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:38.760
 That is millions of people going to genocide because of their religious beliefs.

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:43.240
 And I'm an atheist, but if people want to believe a certain religion, fine.

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:47.280
 But you know, China's approach is we need to win capitalism so bad.

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:51.640
 We need to win on the global stage so bad, we can't have any of this religious stuff

1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:52.640
 going on here.

1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:54.960
 That is a distraction from winning and beating America.

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:59.160
 And then in America, the people who are going to make us win are the entrepreneurs and

1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:03.080
 the scientists and the technology and our education system and finance and we're vilifying

1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:04.080
 those things.

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:05.560
 It's pretty dark.

1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:10.880
 It's dark, but I still believe that the vilification is just in the space of Twitter and the space

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:11.880
 of ideas.

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:12.880
 I think that's probably a good...

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:14.800
 And entrepreneurs win out in the end.

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:15.800
 They don't...

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:16.800
 I believe...

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:17.800
 And they'll build, we'll get the rocks...

1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:20.760
 Some of them do actually in their darkest moments, I can tell you that they turn off

1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:24.320
 their Twitter accounts and they, I've had to sit down with a number of entrepreneurs

1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:26.680
 and say, turn off Twitter.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.480
 This is not healthy for you.

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:31.360
 This is not a healthy pursuit because don't read the comments.

1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:33.080
 If you do, it's like a full contact sport.

1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:36.960
 You should just take it as like professional wrestling or something, but stay focused on

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:44.000
 building companies and advancing the human species through science and technology.

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.560
 As you're describing, you've hosted this week in startups for how many episodes?

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:51.480
 11 years, almost 1200 now.

1:04:51.480 --> 1:04:52.480
 1200.

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.480
 Yeah.

1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:56.320
 So you've talked to some of the great leaders in business in general.

1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:01.600
 Is there a common thing that you see or...

1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:04.000
 Really messed up relationship with the parents.

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.400
 Like just find me a great entrepreneur.

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:08.480
 I will show me the trauma.

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:11.480
 Their dad was like, you're not good enough.

1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:13.400
 In the teenage years, is that truly...

1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:14.400
 Is there something...

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:15.400
 There is definitely something to do...

1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:17.840
 Like hardship at some point in their life kind of thing.

1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:18.840
 Yeah.

1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:19.840
 I think so.

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:24.280
 I mean, and there's definitely something with immigrant parents that is a bit of a stereotype

1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:29.440
 about here, but I've heard from many investors, that's like their, oh, were your parents immigrants

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:34.400
 and did they beat into you that you have to succeed and you feel the need to succeed because

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:36.560
 they suffered to get you to this country?

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.920
 There is an archetype there that I hear...

1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:42.080
 When I started investing, I heard from a lot of people was like, yeah, you want to find

1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:45.080
 those immigrant founders who are coming out of Stanford because they had to fight to get

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:48.000
 there and their parents had to fight.

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.400
 So it's like two huge fights and there's so much at stake as opposed to somebody who's

1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:55.280
 fifth generation and had everything handed to them and they were legacy and got into

1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.280
 schools for free.

1:05:56.280 --> 1:06:03.240
 But I think in general, the ability to get people to join you on that journey is so critical.

1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:07.400
 So you have to be charismatic and it doesn't mean like you're an extrovert.

1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:11.600
 There are introverts who are super charismatic and there are soft spoken people.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.640
 They don't have to be like super vivacious or rambunctious people.

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:20.320
 They could be just quiet assassins, but you need to be able to get people to come on the

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:21.320
 journey with you.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:24.200
 You need to be that storyteller and you have to have that passion and then you have to

1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:30.080
 transfer that enthusiasm to investors, the press, to customers, to all the stakeholders.

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:34.360
 And if you're enthusiastic about it and you're engaged, then it's easier for people to come

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:35.440
 on that journey.

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:39.040
 And that's why people really start to think about, well, what is the purpose of what I'm

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:40.040
 doing?

1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:41.040
 And it sounds corny.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:43.200
 And when I first heard that, I was like, it's kind of corny.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:47.600
 But then I read this book by, I've got his name, Rick Something.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:52.240
 He wrote The Purpose Driven Church and he had spoken at a TED or something and everybody

1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:57.200
 went crazy about it and he's like, a church should have one purpose, one single thing

1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:58.200
 they do.

1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:01.920
 And like his church, which was like one of these mega churches in San Diego, just wanted

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:06.840
 to do education for this specific country and that's all they did.

1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:08.320
 And they just, they benchmarked them.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:14.640
 I think it's very important to have a purpose and a mission, not everything, but a specific

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:18.240
 purpose of some kind of joy that you want to put into the world, you want to solve some

1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:23.960
 kind of big, hard problem and then everybody knows why you're coming to work every day.

1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:28.440
 And then for the founder, when you dread going to work that day and you don't feel like solving

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.200
 that problem anymore, that's the, that's the tell.

1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:33.320
 And a lot of times I meet young founders and I'm like, why are you doing this?

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:37.240
 And they're like, well, I was looking for an idea and this is the one I came up with

1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:38.600
 because I think I'll make a lot of money.

1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:41.120
 And it's like, you're going to quit.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:44.600
 You're going to get to month nine or 10 of this and you're going to run out of money or

1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:48.160
 like your CTO is going to quit, then your CFO is going to quit and you're going to lose

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:53.120
 your biggest customer and you're just going to say, this is not worth it.

1:07:53.120 --> 1:08:03.080
 And if using Bezos or Elon's examples, they just needed to see the world change in very

1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:07.880
 specific ways and Steve Jobs, they needed to see a change and it doesn't matter if they

1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:11.280
 made money or they were losing or winning, they just went to work every day and they

1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:12.280
 had to change it.

1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:14.280
 It's almost like they didn't have a choice.

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:15.280
 No choice.

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.560
 Elon makes this sound like his torture, his whole journey, but he can't help it.

1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:26.040
 Having been a witness to it, just as friends for that long, I have never seen an entrepreneur

1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:27.400
 suffer more than him.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.360
 And he's been public about that, like you do not want to be me.

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.560
 He has suffered for those companies.

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.200
 He has suffered to get them where they are.

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:36.480
 It has not been easy.

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:39.640
 Can you analyze Elon in that aspect?

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:42.160
 Is it just he can't help it?

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:46.600
 He must see the change that he hopes for in the world?

1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:51.920
 He's just incredibly hardworking and he's very talented as well.

1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:53.920
 I don't think people understand that.

1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:55.760
 He actually is a really brilliant engineer.

1:08:55.760 --> 1:09:01.240
 At the end of the day, he actually knows what he's doing and he asks the right questions.

1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:05.720
 People were kind of aghast that he was asking Vlad such good questions and they're like,

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:08.280
 oh my God, Elon's the best journalist on the planet.

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.400
 And it was like, kind of anybody who knows Elon knows he has great questions.

1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:18.840
 I used to have dinner in LA and my book agent also was Sam Harris's agent and Sam and I

1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:24.240
 met through John Brockman and we became friends because we lived near each other and I was

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:28.360
 friends with Elon and then I used to invite them to both dinner in Brentwood because one

1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:31.480
 lived in Bel Air, one lived in Santa Monica and I lived in Brentwood and we would go to

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:36.320
 this place Papone and it's Italian restaurant and every Tuesday for years, we would just

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:40.920
 the three of us, every other Tuesday or so, we'd have dinner and I'd sit there and Sam

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.080
 wanted to know about AI and Elon's talking about artificial intelligence because he's

1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:49.960
 on the board of DeepMind and Elon wanted to know about atheism and meditation and all

1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:52.600
 this other stuff that Sam was an expert on.

1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.400
 I had to sit there and like just listen to these two guys talk.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:03.760
 And they have both piercing intelligences but Elon, he goes straight to the gut.

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:09.240
 The questions that no engineer wants to hear is like just the basic stuff that like why

1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:15.080
 the hell are you doing it this way when the obvious solution is like much easier or this

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:16.920
 or that, like why haven't you tried this?

1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:17.920
 You figure things out.

1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:19.920
 I mean, he's a problem solver.

1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:23.920
 And that's another thing, I think the great entrepreneurs can look at a problem with very

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:30.160
 fresh eyes like almost consistently that Bezos described that as day one thinking, right?

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:35.720
 Like just pretend this is day one every day and then other people use the term first principles.

1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:40.680
 But it basically means like when you see a problem, pause for a second and really think

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:44.680
 through what is the best possible solution here, what are some alternative solutions

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.920
 and get from everybody like how do we solve this problem and what people do sometimes

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:48.920
 they get in a rut.

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:53.160
 They just come to work and they just go through their email, they do whatever they did the

1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:54.160
 day before.

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:55.160
 They don't think, why are we doing this?

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.000
 And is there a better way to do it?

1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.880
 Now you can get so obsessive about that that you can over engineer stuff and you can never

1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:03.480
 actually ship a product.

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:08.440
 So there have to be some pragmatism and some goals and some dates associated with that.

1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:13.960
 But it is a very cool thing to really think like, I wonder if we actually made the batteries

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:18.480
 ourselves, what that would look like or I wonder if we could get to two day shipping,

1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:22.800
 you know, or what if we do same day shipping, like you need to have somebody who's willing

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:27.280
 to say, you know what, fuck it, let's set a crazy audacious goal, a two day shipping

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:29.760
 of any product anywhere in the United States.

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:33.000
 And once you throw the gauntlet down like that, now everybody knows they're rowing in

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.840
 the right direction, two day shipping, Amazon Prime, and that's what people didn't realize

1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:37.840
 about Amazon.

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:41.000
 The business wasn't the shipping of those products, it was getting you to sign up for

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.520
 Amazon Prime.

1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:47.920
 They have hundreds of millions of people doing Amazon Prime for $10 a month, I think globally

1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:49.040
 it's probably cheaper.

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:54.360
 But that was the driver of that business was all of those people because they would, you're

1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:57.400
 an Amazon Prime subscriber, do you know how much you pay?

1:11:57.400 --> 1:11:58.400
 No.

1:11:58.400 --> 1:11:59.400
 Exactly.

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:00.400
 It started at $50.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:03.920
 And I think they even had like 40, 50, $60 was like the testing in the early days and

1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:08.480
 now it's I think $149.12, $13 a month.

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:11.920
 If you pay for the year, I think it goes down to 10 bucks a month, 120.

1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:12.920
 And you're like, wow.

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:18.160
 And he's like, yeah, you're paying $13 a month for the privilege of shopping at Amazon.

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:23.720
 But you say it's the greatest thing in the world because anything I need, if you forgot

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:27.640
 a microphone or a cable goes bad or a camera goes bad, you get it here within a day or

1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:28.640
 less.

1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:29.640
 Yeah.

1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:30.640
 It's pretty amazing.

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:36.760
 You've already been dropping bombs, incredible advice on startups in general, but let me maybe

1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:42.560
 go straight in and ask, is there advice for somebody that wants to go big to build the

1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:44.680
 big startup to help them succeed?

1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:45.680
 Yeah.

1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:49.920
 It's similar to the advice I give to investors because now I teach angel investing because

1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:52.040
 there's so many people who want to invest.

1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:55.960
 And so I wrote a book on that angel and then I do a course called Angel University that

1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:57.560
 I teach six times a year.

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:00.360
 And then I have a syndicate called thesyndicate.com where I invest in companies.

1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:02.440
 There's 6,500 people who are members of that.

1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:04.200
 It's the largest syndicate in the world.

1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:07.560
 In fact, the first deal we ever did was com.com, the meditation app.

1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:12.120
 We put $378,000 into it when it was a $5 million product, a $5 million company.

1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:13.920
 So we bought six or 7% of the company.

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:14.920
 It's now with $2 billion.

1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:15.920
 So you can do the math on that.

1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:16.920
 We still own 5%.

1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:17.920
 What year was it?

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:18.920
 Six years ago.

1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:25.720
 So probably maybe 2015, 2014, and nobody else would invest in com.

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:30.640
 But Sam Harris was the reason I did because I asked Sam, tell me about meditation and

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.680
 he's explaining it to me and I said, what about this?

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:33.840
 You have to have like a mantra.

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:34.840
 How does it work?

1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:35.840
 Exactly.

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:36.840
 I know positive.

1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:38.680
 I was like, well, you should just go to UCLA and talk to Diana Winston and there's this

1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:41.880
 whole project there and I'm like, UCLA does meditation?

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.160
 It's like, yeah, there's a mindful institute there.

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:48.800
 Like teaching people to teach meditation and they're doing PTSD and I'm doing brain scans

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:53.960
 and I was like, oh, and then I talked to the UCLA people and they're like, it's real.

1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:54.960
 Yeah.

1:13:54.960 --> 1:14:00.120
 Like we taught Phil Jackson and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O Neal did, you know, that's

1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:01.120
 how they won their championships.

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:02.120
 They meditated.

1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:07.680
 And I was like, hmm, if UCLA is doing it, Sam says it's cool, well, fuck it, I'll put

1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:09.080
 money into that.

1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:12.640
 And that's the second biggest investment in my career after Uber and it will, well, in

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:13.640
 all likelihood become the biggest.

1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:18.160
 I mean, it's between Uber, Robin Hood and Com.

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:21.360
 And long story short, when I'm teaching people to angel invest, there's really two things

1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:24.160
 that you cannot fake.

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.280
 One is a product that is built really well.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:33.280
 So if you look at Com, Robin Hood, Uber, Tesla, Amazon, these products are transcendent.

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:34.280
 They're well constructed.

1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:35.960
 There's craftsmanship to them.

1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:36.960
 They're great products.

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:41.560
 So you're saying not fundamentally like the idea but the execution of the actual craftsmanship

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:42.560
 of the construction.

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:45.600
 The actual product is amazing.

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:53.040
 Then there's customers and that every business has ultimately a customer and that customer,

1:14:53.040 --> 1:15:01.120
 if they are in fact delighted by that product, that's the magic because you need a team to

1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:06.240
 build the product and then you need customers to use the product and really those three

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:08.360
 vectors are undeniable.

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:14.320
 Now, you could have great teams that build a bad product, doesn't happen too often or

1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:19.320
 you could have customers who don't like the product but generally speaking, a great team

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:25.480
 will build a great product or a good product that iterate and then eventually delight customers.

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:31.360
 And so most people say the team is the most important but there's a lot of smart people

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:37.000
 out there and let's assume that you can have, you can raise money for your idea or you have

1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.600
 money or you can just convince people to do it for free.

1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:42.080
 If you make a great product and it connects with users, that's the magic.

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:46.480
 You look at Clubhouse, it's actually a really well designed product and that product is

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:50.320
 connecting with customers and if you were to talk to the customers or look at the product,

1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:54.120
 you would see a well constructed product and a delighted customer and you can tell the

1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:56.720
 delighted customer by just the amount of time they use it.

1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:57.720
 That's called engagement.

1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:02.800
 It's the fancy word for how much they use it and Snapchat, when that was going around

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:07.320
 and they were trying to raise money, they had a fraction of the number of users.

1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:15.160
 But the top maybe third were opening the app every hour and nobody had ever seen that before.

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:18.840
 People were using Facebook a couple of times a day, the top users, but nobody had ever

1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:25.840
 seen people using it every day for 100 days in a row every hour and I was like, what's

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:26.840
 going on here?

1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:30.920
 I was like, oh, the ephemeral messaging and then the streaks, they had created the streaks

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:35.200
 between people where every day and then people would be on vacation, I just have to open

1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:39.120
 my streak and keep my streak with Lex that we chatted every day going and so they had

1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:43.200
 this addictive nature to it and that's why Clubhouse was able to garner so much investment

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:48.880
 is the number of hours people were using it every month was just unbelievably off the

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:49.880
 charts.

1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:55.360
 Some of that is execution, but some of it is the weird magic of the product market fit.

1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:00.720
 So there's something in Clubhouse, it's still a mystery to me because I also use Discord

1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:01.720
 voice.

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:03.360
 There's that intimacy to voice.

1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:04.360
 Oh, for sure.

1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:06.880
 Well, you have people's, yeah, tent.

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:13.120
 Well, but like the video gets in the way actually, in a weird way, there's a privacy when you

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:14.120
 just use voice.

1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:15.680
 People are not taking showers now, Lex.

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:18.720
 I mean, we're in a pandemic and people just are all out of bed.

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:19.720
 And the hair thing.

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:20.720
 Nobody's getting haircuts.

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:21.720
 Nobody's hair is good.

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:22.720
 Nobody's getting haircuts.

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.080
 People are wearing gym clothes.

1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:28.080
 I mean, Zoom is just horrific to be on Zoom for five hours a day.

1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:29.080
 It is exhausting.

1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:35.480
 Well, it does make me wonder what once we emerge from the pandemic, whether a product

1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:39.280
 market fit, how that evolves with Clubhouse and all those kinds of things.

1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:42.360
 Yeah, no, Clubhouse is a beneficiary of the pandemic for sure.

1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:49.080
 When do you think the, when do you think debts will be under, let's say 200 a day and we'll

1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:51.200
 have 200 million people on the other side of this?

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:52.640
 Because that's kind of what it takes, right?

1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:55.720
 You got to get to 150, 200 million people on the other side in America.

1:17:55.720 --> 1:18:00.800
 I haven't, you know, I personally stopped deeply thinking about this because I've been

1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:08.720
 frustrated for so long that I almost checked out because it psychologically allows me to

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:16.680
 carry on because I thought for many months now that testing needs to be done at scale.

1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:17.880
 And it still hasn't gotten done.

1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:18.880
 It has.

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:23.360
 So we gave up basically on testing because we're, and we're all sitting there waiting

1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:30.080
 for vaccine to come along and the distribution of the vaccine is not, you know, it's struggling

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:33.720
 from the same kind of things as the testing is going to take quite a bit of time.

1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:40.000
 So it does, if everything goes great, meaning there's not a second strand of the virus that's

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:46.960
 going to create a second major wave, that I am cynical enough to think that it won't

1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:51.240
 be until mid summer that we start opening back up.

1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:54.560
 Yeah, I think it's going to be May, June, I'm a little bit earlier than you.

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:55.560
 I've been tracking it.

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:57.760
 It's like 1.5 million shots in arms a day.

1:18:57.760 --> 1:18:59.360
 I think this vaccine's been undersold.

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:01.200
 I mean, it's a miracle.

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:05.880
 Not one person who was in the trials died who took it and only one went to the hospital

1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:07.400
 and they weren't even put on a ventilator.

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:12.480
 So, and the hospitalizations are plummeting and we're at 10% now in the United States.

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:16.320
 At the pace we're going at 1.5 a day, I think when the Johnson and Johnson one comes out

1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.880
 next month, it'll be 3 million a day, maybe two and a half.

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:22.080
 And we already have 100 million people who've likely had it.

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:23.080
 So I've been doing the math.

1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:26.480
 I think we're like 60 days away, February and March.

1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:30.440
 Yeah, sometime in April, I think anybody's going to be able to get a shot and the number

1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:33.480
 of deaths is going to go below 200 a day.

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:36.600
 And once that happens, I think people who have had enough of this, they're just going

1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:39.240
 to go yolo.

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:44.680
 But see the crucial piece for me that I've been focusing on is the social media aspect

1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:49.600
 of how the, it's not just about the reality of deaths.

1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:55.680
 It's about the state of the collective intelligence of the human species, which is determined

1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:58.400
 by our communication on social media.

1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:03.960
 So we could, yeah, we can be collectively afraid, the fear can spread or it could be

1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:10.120
 yolo can spread or it could be like all different kinds of misinformation.

1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:16.240
 And of course, during the election year, the politics influences our perception of what

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:22.200
 is true and not, but, you know, having real rigorous nuanced conversation about this kind

1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:25.720
 of stuff is the way, is the way out of this.

1:20:25.720 --> 1:20:30.720
 And that's where social media really comes in because social media drives division where

1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:33.160
 the people form tribes and so on.

1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:36.960
 It feels like it's honestly a technology problem.

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:41.760
 You know, people say it's a human problem, but it just feels like I believe people are

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:42.760
 good.

1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:45.040
 Technology can enable them to be thoughtful.

1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:50.360
 We talked earlier about, you know, the magic of Silicon Valley and then maybe going too

1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:55.800
 far with the Facebook groups example where, you know, you take out all that friction.

1:20:55.800 --> 1:21:01.360
 What happened was, we used to have something called our chron, reverse chronological order.

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:03.120
 That's how you consume to feed.

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:06.720
 So any kind of social feed like Twitter was in reverse chronological order.

1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:09.920
 The newest thing was up top and you would just work your way backwards.

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:12.640
 And so it gave this like really fresh feeling.

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:16.840
 And then a guy named Dave Moran and the team over at Facebook realized, you know, there

1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:21.200
 are some things that got a lot of attention two hours ago.

1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:23.440
 And the stuff since then has not been as important.

1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:26.960
 But if you missed that, there was a really good tweet where there was a really good update

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:33.000
 like somebody had a baby, let's, that's kind of, can we get the baby one at the top?

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.360
 And it was like, well, how would we do that?

1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:35.880
 How would we know that that's the important one?

1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.040
 It's like, well, let's, let's put a like button on it.

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:40.480
 And let's see how many comments there are.

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:44.320
 So if it gets a lot of likes or comments or retweets, let's show those first.

1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:47.400
 And then we'll kind of mix in the most recent stuff.

1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:52.600
 And so when you're on Twitter and then when Facebook did that, Facebook became so addicting

1:21:52.600 --> 1:21:56.960
 because Facebook was on, what has got the most engagement put that first?

1:21:56.960 --> 1:22:00.120
 So every time you open up Facebook, you get the dopamine hit.

1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:06.240
 And then what happens when you see the Bart Mitzvah photo or, you know, the enraging story

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:08.920
 about some injustice in the world, you retweet it.

1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:10.120
 You write a comment.

1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:12.080
 You share it on your wall.

1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:18.960
 And thus this addiction to the outrageous, the outlandish, the inspiring occurred.

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:24.240
 And it used to be like inspiring stuff, puppies or some heartwarming story.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:25.400
 And then it got dark.

1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:30.240
 And then people started to realize, if I want to show up on the top of my friend's feeds,

1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:35.120
 if I say something controversial or I'm outraged, I get to the top.

1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:38.240
 And then that's when outraged culture came in and then that's when cancel culture came

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:39.240
 in.

1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:45.000
 And I realized, if I try to cancel that person for being a racist or a sexist or a horrible

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.720
 human being or whatever they did that's wrong, I get to the top of the feed.

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:53.960
 And we all collectively started playing a very weird video game, which is how outraged

1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:54.960
 can we all be?

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:56.680
 And to get to the top of the list.

1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:00.520
 And then of course, with Trump, he realized it and he's like, okay, yeah, I'm just going

1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:03.040
 to make fun of a celebrity and I get more retweets.

1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:06.440
 Okay, I'm going to make fun of Rosie O'Donnell for being overweight or something.

1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:08.720
 And he just starts attacking people.

1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:10.360
 And people are like, oh my God, what did he say?

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:14.040
 And he copied that from Howard Stern because he was in New York and he used to be on Howard

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:18.680
 Stern and Howard Stern took over all the dialogue in the 80s and 90s because he was outrageous.

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:19.680
 And then Trump did that.

1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:23.720
 And then social media incorporated that into the operating system.

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:28.760
 It became the actual device of social media was the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:30.120
 We've got something incredible for you.

1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:34.840
 Everybody salivates like Pavlog's dog, you know, oh my God, I can't be outraged.

1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.240
 That's what's got to be undone.

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:41.240
 And the only way for that to be undone is these things can't be billions of people where

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:45.880
 the most outrageous thing that happened in the world today in the last five minutes is

1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:47.280
 now in front of you.

1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:48.680
 And that's why people have anxiety.

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:53.760
 They don't sleep and they doom scroll all night is because the human mind was not meant

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:56.920
 to process this much suffering, pain, anger.

1:23:56.920 --> 1:23:59.320
 And that's why we have all this mental health issues.

1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:04.960
 Also, you know, young girls or even adults watching other people post their private jets

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:11.120
 and their vacations and, you know, YOLO adventures on their Instagram to the point at which young

1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:18.840
 people are now faking being on private jets to put on their Instagram and creating like

1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:22.520
 this crazy FOMO around their Instagrams.

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:25.040
 Like now we wonder why people are unhappy.

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.120
 Like if you think everybody's on a private jet going to some Michelin star restaurant

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:33.280
 or whatever the coolest thing in the world is today, like going to the Grammys, going

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:39.560
 to whatever Coachella Burning Man, like you're like, oh, but I'm home.

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:43.160
 I'm in my house and I'm not at Burning Man.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:44.160
 Getting inadequate.

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:45.160
 Exactly.

1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:48.200
 So this whole system is creating the wrong set of incentives.

1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:53.880
 I didn't believe it's possible to still have extremely high engagement and create a successful

1:24:53.880 --> 1:25:00.200
 profitable business while encouraging personal growth, like encouraging people to be the

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:01.200
 best version of themselves.

1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:06.680
 I just think we haven't, we got the first generation of social networks, I think a new generation

1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:07.680
 needs to be built.

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:08.680
 Absolutely.

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:09.680
 Is that your plan for a business?

1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:17.400
 Well, I have a longer term plan in terms of ambition, which is I believe in being able

1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:24.000
 to have deep connection between human and AI systems, like partners, friends.

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.160
 There is a connection to there with social media.

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:36.240
 I do think AI has a strong role to play in representing us, in guiding us in how we consume

1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:37.240
 social media.

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:44.240
 So this algorithm that controls the feed for Facebook is a somewhat centralized algorithm,

1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:49.040
 but instead to give more power to the people, individuals, to where each one of us have

1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:50.040
 our own algorithm.

1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:51.040
 Bring your own algorithm.

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:52.040
 Bring your own algorithm.

1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:53.040
 B Y O A.

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:54.040
 B Y O A.

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:55.040
 I like it.

1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:56.040
 Bring your own algorithm.

1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:57.040
 Yeah.

1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.880
 Well, I mean, if you thought about it, if we came and said, I want, when I look at my

1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:07.200
 Twitter feed, I would like to see the people who are the most helpful in the world, generous,

1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:15.240
 kind, intelligent, considered commenting on things that I don't already know about because

1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:17.440
 I want to open my worldview.

1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:19.160
 That could be a beautiful thing for society.

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:23.980
 And actually, Jack was talking about potentially on Twitter, letting people bring their own

1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:26.560
 algorithms and sort their feeds themselves.

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:27.560
 This would be a wonderful thing.

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:31.540
 I think it's one of the reasons Clubhouse has resonated is it's such a diverse group

1:26:31.540 --> 1:26:36.520
 of people that I've been able to drop in on conversations with people who are nothing

1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:42.080
 like me and listen in and hear conversations that I wouldn't normally be privy to.

1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:45.280
 And I, my, everybody's like, oh, come join us as a speaker.

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:46.280
 I want to do a room with you.

1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:47.840
 I get asked every day, can we do a room?

1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:48.840
 Can we do a room?

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:49.840
 Ask an angel investor.

1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:50.840
 Talk about startups.

1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:57.360
 And I'm like, my usage of Clubhouse is going on my Peloton treadmill, putting Clubhouse

1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:00.080
 on, taking a room and just listening.

1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:06.020
 It's so delightful for me as a podcaster where my job is to talk, to sit back and just put

1:27:06.020 --> 1:27:10.240
 in a couple of miles and play chess and listen to a Clubhouse discussion.

1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:16.600
 That is about relationships or, you know, some fashion or hip hop or whatever it is

1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:17.600
 that I'm not part of.

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.200
 I just sit there and I listen and you learn.

1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:21.200
 It's like such a delightful thing.

1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:24.560
 I always think about these kids who go to college and I've always been so jealous of

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:25.560
 these Ivy League kids.

1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.560
 They go and they're like, oh, I got to go to class.

1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:32.400
 And I'm like, I would just love to sit there and listen to Professor Lex talk.

1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:37.520
 You know, like what a privilege to sit there and let somebody else drive and talk and listen

1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:38.520
 and learn.

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:39.520
 Yeah.

1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:40.520
 That's the beauty of podcasting.

1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:44.200
 But of course Clubhouse creates a whole nother experience for its conversations is different.

1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:45.640
 I think it's going to be the in between.

1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:48.640
 I like it as a, you release your podcast.

1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:51.160
 Like you and I are going to release this podcast, right?

1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:53.480
 And then at some point I'll have you on my pod when you want your startup.

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:57.800
 And then at some point, somebody's going to be like, you and I will run it.

1:27:57.800 --> 1:27:58.800
 And I ran into you.

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:03.120
 I saw you were on Clubhouse the other night and I was busy, but I was almost going to

1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:05.120
 click on you and say, let's start a room together.

1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:08.200
 But you and I will start a room together with Eric Weinstein or somebody or Sam Harris will

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:12.520
 jump in or Elon and we'll have a different experience, which would just shoot the shit.

1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:19.920
 And it'll act as like a fabric and a little filler between the tentpole podcast, right?

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:22.040
 Like you and Eric, you've done three, I think with Eric.

1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:23.040
 Yeah.

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:24.040
 We just four.

1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:25.040
 I haven't released the fourth yet.

1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:26.040
 Oh, okay.

1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.280
 So I'm a watched all three because I really thought your you way and him like giving you

1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:34.680
 advice is very interesting dynamic and those very interesting dynamic.

1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:36.720
 And I find him like a fascinating cat.

1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:39.640
 We know everybody in common except we've never met.

1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:42.640
 It's very weird because you think about the social graph in the real world.

1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:48.400
 This is why I think augmented reality is going to be such an amazing product.

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:52.400
 I just have one killer feature I want for augmented reality.

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:54.280
 We wear our glasses.

1:28:54.280 --> 1:29:00.000
 And when I look at you above your head, I see the relationships we have and the things

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:01.000
 we've done together.

1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:02.000
 Yes.

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.000
 Right?

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:07.280
 So I see, oh, you both know Sam Harris or you had Elon on the podcast on this date or

1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:10.720
 you and I were both at Burning Man in 2016.

1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:14.640
 So the most meaningful element of our connection in the network.

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:18.640
 And then because we would discover that through small talk, but imagine you're like at a party

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:24.800
 and you look and it just people glow and you just see a glow around a person and like

1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:29.040
 green means you have some financial relationship, blue means you have some friendship one or

1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:33.160
 yellow means you have friendship one, blue means you know nothing about each other.

1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:34.160
 You have no connections.

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:37.120
 You're like, wow, these blue people have no connection to.

1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:38.760
 These people, that one's glowing red.

1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:41.120
 We know seven or more people in common.

1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:42.120
 And those are the seven people.

1:29:42.120 --> 1:29:45.800
 Oh, we should go talk about how we know each other.

1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:48.680
 And that's sort of happened with Facebook, remember or MySpace where you were like, oh,

1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:50.760
 you know that person, friend of a friend?

1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:56.640
 But that's what is going to be AR is like, this is why I think if Apple figures out AR

1:29:56.640 --> 1:30:01.000
 or Snapchat and they just have those glasses, you know, forget about VR, it's just nauseating

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:06.280
 and whatever, but AR where you put the glasses on, you see the real world, but you augment

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:07.280
 it.

1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:12.520
 You make, just like you were saying, you make it frictionless, a very low friction to make

1:30:12.520 --> 1:30:17.120
 a deep human connection because you have all the basic elements there already.

1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:19.920
 Now think about the unintended consequences of what I just described.

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:21.800
 It could get creepy and weird.

1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:22.800
 The privacy thing.

1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:23.800
 Yeah.

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:29.520
 I mean, people will, here's the thing, people, your privacy is an illusion, like all this

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:30.720
 information is there.

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:37.960
 And then people are more than willing to give up privacy in exchange for some value.

1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:39.880
 You know, it's a value trade.

1:30:39.880 --> 1:30:45.960
 And giving, if my Tesla, when I'm driving in the direction of my house just starts the

1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:50.920
 navigation and saves me three clicks and that friction's gone, I'm willing to give Tesla

1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:53.560
 my location and my home address, right?

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:56.440
 I'm not willing to give Zuckerberg anything because I don't trust him, but you get the

1:30:56.440 --> 1:30:57.440
 idea.

1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:59.240
 I mean, it will be that way with like DNA and other things.

1:30:59.240 --> 1:31:01.280
 At some point, we'll just be like, yeah, just take my DNA.

1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:02.480
 Like I don't, yeah, sure.

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:06.920
 People can look and see that I'm a mental midget and my IQ is like lower than, I don't

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:12.080
 want to bring the bell curve up or whatever, but you could figure out like, if we all put

1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:17.040
 our DNA in a sequence online and be like, oh yeah, you know, Lex has got 10 more IQ points

1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:20.120
 than Jay Cal and you know, Sam's got 10 more than Lex.

1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:22.560
 And all of a sudden people are like, all bed out of shape about it.

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:25.960
 But what if they, we did that and they were like, and by the way, you also, all three

1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:30.440
 of you are going to get Parkinson's unless you do X, Y and Z, unless you eat more blueberries

1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:31.680
 or whatever we figure out.

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:33.560
 They're going to accept it pretty quickly.

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:34.560
 Yeah, that's...

1:31:34.560 --> 1:31:35.560
 Brave new world.

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:36.560
 Brave new world.

1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:41.760
 I have to ask you, you're, just like you were saying, you're one of the world experts

1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:48.120
 in investing and in startups, yeah, VC and so on.

1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:54.520
 From the perspective of the startup, I was always kind of skeptical of raising money.

1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:58.840
 It feels like people do it too quickly, too easily, but I don't know what the hell I'm

1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:00.760
 talking about.

1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:04.760
 When is the, when should a startup raise money?

1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:10.480
 And from the perspective of the investor, when should the investor invest in the startup?

1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:12.120
 Is there a timing thing here?

1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:13.120
 Is there...

1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:14.120
 Yeah.

1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:20.800
 It's a very important question because the venture capital community is only going to

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:27.600
 fund sub 1% of enterprises started in the United States every year, like maybe 10 basis

1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:30.160
 points of them, like one in a thousand.

1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:33.480
 And the reason is it's jet fuel.

1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:37.160
 You only want to take that money if you really want to build something big and you want to

1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:38.160
 build it fast.

1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:43.920
 And when you put jet fuel behind a startup, as we've seen with other rockets, things can

1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:46.160
 blow up and people can die.

1:32:46.160 --> 1:32:49.360
 It's not people literally dying, but the business can go up and smoke, right?

1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:50.360
 Yes.

1:32:50.360 --> 1:32:54.240
 The rockets get blown up all the time at SpaceX as part of their ambitious plans.

1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:58.240
 And startups, seven out of 10 startups we invest in go to zero.

1:32:58.240 --> 1:33:02.120
 Now, if you were to start the business and only build it off customer revenue and use

1:33:02.120 --> 1:33:07.400
 your own money and go nice and slow and grow 10% a year, the chances of you blowing up

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:10.840
 the rocket are very low because you're riding a bicycle.

1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:15.840
 You can go a little faster, but the bicycle can only go so fast.

1:33:15.840 --> 1:33:24.480
 And once you start taking that money, the way venture capital is constructed in the

1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:31.080
 mix of like MIT or Harvard's endowments is, we're going to put some money into safe things

1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:34.240
 and then we're going to have these really binary things over here.

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:38.480
 And they probably put 5% in venture capital traditionally.

1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:42.840
 It's grown to 20% just as a function of how successful it's been.

1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:48.600
 So the Harvard's of the world and MIT's probably want 5% or 10% in venture, but it's grown

1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:53.680
 to 25% because companies like Airbnb and Uber have grown so big and Tesla.

1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:59.760
 But the goal is in these venture funds, we're going to invest in 30 names and one or two

1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:03.080
 of them are going to return three times the capital we've deployed.

1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:06.480
 So it's a $300 million fund and there's 30 names and they each got 10 million.

1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:11.240
 That means one of the 10 million is going to return the fund plus.

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:17.080
 So that means it has to grow 30X and then 60X to double the fund.

1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:19.920
 And you're really supposed to be doing three times cash on cash.

1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:25.320
 So that $300 million funds, the expectation is in 10 years to return 900 million, triple

1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.520
 the person's money as opposed to the stock market, which doubles your money in the same

1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:29.520
 period.

1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:35.600
 So you're supposed to do 25% annualized returns in order to triple the money.

1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:38.600
 And maybe I have an outlying chance of four or five times the money, which does happen

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:43.080
 sometimes when you have an outlier in your portfolio like Uber or Facebook was.

1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.760
 And what that means is the venture capitalist behavior in the game they're playing is different

1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:49.000
 than you as the founder.

1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.840
 You as the founder, you may really care about this and it dying really matters to you.

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:56.480
 And then you got a venture capitalist who's like, we're betting on 30 names, we need two

1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:02.480
 of them to hit it out of the park, maybe three and nothing else is meaningful.

1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:06.120
 So now you start thinking about the game theory there.

1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:12.880
 You're dealing with money that is coming in that only cares about you going a hundred

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:13.880
 X.

1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:14.880
 Yes.

1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:17.240
 It's a whole different ball game.

1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:19.160
 Whereas if you build off revenue, you don't have to do that.

1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:22.520
 And if you look at a company like calm.com, we invested at 5 million, the next round they

1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:23.520
 did was 250.

1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:28.460
 They were so capital efficient that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue to millions

1:35:28.460 --> 1:35:32.840
 of dollars a month in revenue over those four years since we invested and they didn't raise

1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:34.840
 money in between.

1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:37.800
 It was unbelievable and I've only seen this happen three or four times.

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:43.720
 So it doesn't happen all this capital efficient meaning based on customer revenue alone plus

1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.800
 some small amount of fundraising, you're able to grow like how hard is it to do that?

1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:52.560
 It takes extreme product market fit.

1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:56.240
 You have to have a great price for your product that has a great margin.

1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:57.560
 Yeah.

1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:00.720
 And if you're doing something in hardware, it's probably impossible because it's super

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:01.720
 capital intensive.

1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:04.040
 So it's probably got to be a software business software.

1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:05.800
 Software businesses take a lot more.

1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:10.280
 Do venture capitalists get in the way at all of the business or do bosses have to get

1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:11.280
 out of the way?

1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:12.280
 Yeah.

1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:15.480
 If you get young venture capitalists who are starting their career, they're very nervous

1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:18.920
 and scared because they're putting all these bets.

1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:21.920
 And then there's a very weird thing that happens.

1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:23.960
 The bad news comes first.

1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:28.800
 So companies that don't work out go out of business immediately.

1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:34.720
 So if it's not going to be Com or Robinhood or Uber, you know you have one of those great

1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:38.680
 successes somewhere in your five, six, seven, eight as an investor.

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:40.080
 What is the first five years like?

1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:47.840
 The first five years, you feel like an idiot because let's say you make these 10 bets.

1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:50.840
 In year two, two or three of them come back and they don't have product market fit and

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:51.840
 they're out of money.

1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:52.840
 And they say, can we have more money?

1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:55.520
 You say, no, we have to go get it from somebody else because you have to prove that they're

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:56.760
 still in market for it.

1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.000
 We may keep our pro rata, we may put a little bit in to maintain our percentage ownership,

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:05.240
 but we're not going to give you another big chunk of money.

1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:06.320
 And that company dies.

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.280
 So now you've got 10 million up in smoke, boom, 10 million up in smoke.

1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:15.720
 So this is called the J curve where your performance goes down and then it's only in years four

1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:17.160
 or five and six that starts going up.

1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:21.280
 And what you're seeing right now is the people who started like I did in 2000, you know,

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:26.440
 just 11, 12 years ago in 2009, I started investing, we all look like geniuses.

1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:27.440
 Why?

1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:29.080
 We're at the end of the cycle.

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:34.160
 We invested after when the stock market was on the floor after the financial crisis and

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:35.840
 it's gone straight up since.

1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:38.840
 So everybody, there's a couple of little blips in there, but generally speaking, there hasn't

1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:42.120
 been like a major crash with the exception of the pandemic crash, but that bounced right

1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:43.120
 back.

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.480
 And so, you know, it takes a decade to figure out if you're good at it.

1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:50.640
 And then if the market crashes again, everybody feels like an idiot again, the cycle starts

1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:51.640
 again.

1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:56.960
 And now as a founder, you are now inserting yourself into that casino.

1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.000
 And now you've got all these other forces pushing and pulling.

1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:03.280
 And you're growing, let's say your company was growing 50%.

1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:04.280
 You feel like, wow, I'm successful.

1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:07.520
 I made a million dollars last year and now I'm doing a million and a half.

1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:10.640
 And the first thing VC is going to say is, how do we triple?

1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:11.640
 We're growing too slow.

1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:15.600
 See, but that's like you said that beautifully is a rocket fuel.

1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:19.080
 It's, in a sense, it's a kind of motivation.

1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:20.080
 It's a drive.

1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:21.080
 I mean, it's a positive.

1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:27.240
 So if you want that, if you want that, if you want to go to Navy SEAL school, you're

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:31.000
 going to be in pain and they're going to put that hose in your face while you're underwater,

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.120
 with your hands tied behind your back in the pool and you're going to be choking.

1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:38.800
 And they may have to do CPR on you and like every couple of years, tragically, somebody

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:40.400
 dies in Navy SEAL school.

1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:41.400
 Yeah.

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:42.600
 Well, it doesn't mean we're getting rid of the Navy SEALs.

1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:43.880
 Like Rocky, if he dies, he dies.

1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.960
 I don't know if you know David Goggins as by any chance.

1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:46.960
 I do.

1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:48.920
 I mean, I don't know him personally, but oh my Lord.

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:53.000
 So I'm running 48 miles together with him in person in a month.

1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:54.000
 What?

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:55.640
 You're doing an ultramarathon?

1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:01.560
 With him and probably other stuff because he enjoys just breaking people, making them

1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:02.560
 cry.

1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:03.560
 Oh my God.

1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:04.560
 I'm so jelly.

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:10.040
 Well, I offered, we agreed a while ago to do a podcast and he's like, oh yeah, we'll

1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:11.040
 do it this day.

1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:13.040
 Is he in the Bay Area?

1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:17.000
 I don't know where the hell he is, but we're doing it and I don't think I'm supposed to

1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.560
 say where it is, but it's not anywhere close to anywhere of this.

1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:24.360
 It's in the middle of nowhere, but he seems to be in a bunch of different locations.

1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:27.200
 Like he's in Oregon or something like that.

1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:30.040
 What does he do for outside of writing books and being inspirational?

1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.120
 Does he actually train people or like life coach or what are you doing?

1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:35.680
 He's full time insane.

1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:43.000
 Like he fights forest fires like for a few months a year as a farmer like unpaid labor.

1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.800
 Like you know, there's a bunch of people who are like him like Navy Seals and so on that

1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:51.600
 kind of make a career out of motivational speaking, all that kind of stuff.

1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.400
 He's not interested in any of that.

1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:59.360
 He's literally interested in just doing hard shit all the time.

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:00.360
 Breaking himself.

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:01.360
 Breaking himself personally.

1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:05.920
 He seems like he wants to break himself and that book is amazing and the audio book is

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.760
 amazing when he's talking about how fat he was and how he just had to go and keep running

1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:15.280
 and his legs are broken and he's just super pain and he just goes through it.

1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:16.280
 It's really inspiring.

1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:17.280
 The inspiring thing also.

1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:19.280
 Are you going to videotape yourself doing this?

1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:22.360
 I can't wait to see you get destroyed.

1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:26.960
 This is going to be so entertaining for the lack of audience.

1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:28.480
 The pain.

1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:34.560
 But the other thing is he's happily married and there's a partnership there that's everybody

1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:40.400
 finds this attention as a push and pull that's beautiful I think.

1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:47.560
 And speaking of beautiful push and pull, how about that transition?

1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:51.240
 You and Jamat, he's a friend of yours.

1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:52.240
 Besties.

1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:53.240
 Besties.

1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:54.240
 Yeah.

1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:59.080
 I mean, there's very few people in my life, him, Elon, David Sacks, John Brockmans, very

1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:01.120
 few people have supported me as much as those folks.

1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:02.560
 I mean, I'm a huge debt.

1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:05.600
 So he's also cohost on the All In podcast.

1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:07.240
 We taped episode 21 today.

1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:08.240
 Oh, today.

1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:09.240
 Cool.

1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:10.240
 It's Friday now.

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:11.240
 They want to do every Friday.

1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:12.240
 They're addicted like me and you are to podcast.

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:14.360
 So you're going to release it when?

1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.080
 It's probably released as we're sitting here.

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:17.080
 Oh, okay.

1:41:17.080 --> 1:41:18.080
 Beautiful.

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.080
 I can't wait.

1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:20.080
 Special guest on it.

1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:22.080
 We had Draymond Green from the Warriors phone in.

1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:23.320
 So we had our first guest.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:24.320
 Awesome.

1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:25.320
 Yeah.

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:27.520
 So it's really funny because he plays poker with us and we're all besties.

1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:28.520
 So, yeah.

1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:29.520
 Beautiful.

1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:34.960
 So you guys went pretty heated against each other versus Rob on Robin Hood.

1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:35.960
 Yes.

1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:41.160
 So this is two things I want to ask, first, on the actual Robin Hood discussion and the

1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:44.400
 Wall Street Best discussion, can you steel man his argument?

1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:49.360
 What was the nature of the disagreement where, yeah, what is the little, because I don't

1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:51.800
 think it's as big as spaces.

1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:55.600
 It came off as sounding, what is the nature of the disagreement?

1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:04.520
 He felt that Robin Hood turned off trading because the hedge funds told them to and that

1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:08.480
 they were bowing down to the pressure of the hedge funds.

1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:09.480
 That's not true.

1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:14.640
 But in a vacuum of information, you know what happens to people's minds, conspiracy theories

1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:15.640
 abound.

1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:19.560
 And sometimes there is a conspiracy theory and sometimes there's just the appearance

1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:24.200
 of impropriety or a bunch of related things.

1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:29.360
 Like when you look at the Trump situation with Russia, like was Trump trying to coordinate

1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:35.960
 with Russia or the Russians just screwing with a bunch of like neophyte, idiotic dipshits

1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:39.160
 like Donald Trump Jr. who don't know any better.

1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:42.240
 And they don't know that you shouldn't meet with the Russians.

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:45.640
 And if you do meet with the Russians, you are probably a useful idiot, you probably should

1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:46.640
 tell the FBI.

1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:48.960
 Like they're just a bunch of idiots in all likelihood.

1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:49.960
 Who knows?

1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:51.320
 And there's a vacuum of information.

1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:52.400
 And there's a vacuum of information.

1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:53.400
 We don't know.

1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:55.200
 And the Russians are trying to compromise everybody.

1:42:55.200 --> 1:43:02.240
 So would you call it a conspiracy or would you call it an attempted, you know, conspiracy?

1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:03.400
 There was no conspiracy here.

1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:10.760
 What it was was Robinhood needed to raise billions of dollars to say solvent in all likelihood.

1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:13.480
 And they weren't allowed to talk about it.

1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:17.600
 So they were forced into not talking about it in all likelihood and had to come up with

1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:19.320
 that money or shut down.

1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:24.880
 And then what got me upset with Chamath and we had a talk afterwards that people don't

1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:25.880
 know about.

1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:27.360
 I'll talk about it here for the first time.

1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:31.000
 On Sunday, we had to have a little, we had to air it out.

1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:32.000
 Yeah.

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:35.360
 In the episode after you guys sound like you've had a private you've made up.

1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:37.660
 We had a private discussion, just one on one.

1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:38.800
 And we said, listen, we love each other.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:39.800
 We're besties.

1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:41.520
 We've always been there for each other.

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:42.520
 What happened here?

1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:48.080
 And what happened there is I'm fiercely loyal to my folks, whether it's Chamath or Travis

1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:50.160
 from Uber or Sax or whoever.

1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:51.440
 I'm just a loyal guy.

1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:52.440
 Yes.

1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.040
 I always ride or die with my founders, if I invest in them, even if they make a mistake

1:43:56.040 --> 1:43:57.320
 and Uber made plenty of mistakes.

1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:01.440
 I always went on CNBC on my podcast and said, hey, we're going to fix these things.

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:03.760
 I'm in touch with the team.

1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:04.760
 Mistakes were made.

1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:06.500
 We're going to solve them.

1:44:06.500 --> 1:44:10.560
 This is a group of people with great intent who want to make the world a better place.

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:11.560
 And you know what?

1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:13.320
 I was hated for a period of time with Uber.

1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:15.480
 I was hated for it last week with Robin Hood.

1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:18.560
 I got a lot of blowback.

1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:20.920
 But I think in both of those cases, eventually I was right.

1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:24.040
 Uber's doing great stuff in the world, Robin Hood's doing great stuff in the world.

1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:28.760
 And I like to be loyal to my investments and my partners to just, I feel like if you invest

1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:32.600
 and you're on the team, you know, you have really three choices.

1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:36.320
 You can either fight for your team, you can go silent, or you can throw your team under

1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:37.320
 the bus.

1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:40.440
 And I've watched investors throw the team that they invested in that made them a bunch

1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:42.960
 of money under the bus, not acceptable to me.

1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:44.440
 And being quiet is not acceptable to me.

1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:47.720
 So I always ask the founder, do you want me to, is it okay if I go out and defend you

1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:48.720
 publicly?

1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:49.720
 If they say yes, I do it.

1:44:49.720 --> 1:44:53.840
 That's beautiful, by the way, because what else do we have in this world if not friendship?

1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:54.840
 Loyalty means everything to me.

1:44:54.840 --> 1:45:00.960
 I grew up in Brooklyn where if you were not loyal and you were not loyal to your crew,

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:03.680
 then you were a Ronan.

1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.400
 You were out there on your own, flailing in the, you know, trust me, you do not want

1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:13.200
 to be on your own in 1970s, 80s, Brooklyn, Manhattan, like you need to have a crew with

1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:14.200
 you.

1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:17.560
 I've gotten into, you know, you don't want to get into a fight with 10 guys and be alone

1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:18.560
 or just be with you.

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:20.000
 You need a crew to survive.

1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:25.580
 So I just learned early, and my dad who owned a bar just drilled into me being loyal.

1:45:25.580 --> 1:45:28.400
 And so for whatever reason, I'm a bulldog when it comes to loyalty.

1:45:28.400 --> 1:45:32.200
 And Tramoth came out and said, you know, these guys need to go to jail and there's scumbags

1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:34.640
 and I'm trying to defend them.

1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:38.280
 And I'm in a position where I can't defend them because I don't have complete information.

1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:40.880
 There is no complete information and it's in the heat of the moment.

1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:43.480
 And then it becomes the number one story.

1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:46.320
 And it's my number three investment.

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:51.560
 And Tramoth has a competing company, SoFi, and he's killing my guys and then I started

1:45:51.560 --> 1:45:53.200
 killing his guys.

1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:58.960
 And then all of a sudden we're like, wait a second, we're best friends and we're swinging

1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:04.840
 our swords at each other and we're a group of the seven samurai who fight together.

1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:06.660
 When did we turn on each other?

1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:09.960
 And then everybody else who's on the pod, the two Davids, who, you know, both on the

1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:14.720
 spectrum a bit, they got a little Asperger's or whatever, no offense, Lex.

1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:22.440
 I'm not saying, you know, you're in AI and, you know, you might be somewhere.

1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:23.440
 It's not a coincidence.

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:24.440
 Yeah.

1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:25.440
 It might not be a coincidence.

1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:26.440
 Anyway, we upgraded the two Davids firmware.

1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:27.600
 We're going to upgrade your firmware after this.

1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:32.240
 I'll give you a, yeah, you're on the 1.5, you have the three emotions now or should

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:33.240
 we add fourth?

1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:34.240
 You want to go with joy?

1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:35.240
 I'm in the 2.0 already.

1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:36.240
 You're on the 2.0.

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:37.240
 You got the joy.

1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:38.240
 How's it working out?

1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:39.240
 It's difficult.

1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:40.240
 It's difficult.

1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:41.240
 You'll get there.

1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:42.240
 Just let it happen, Lex.

1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:44.960
 Just let the joy happen.

1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:50.480
 So anyway, we just talked about it offline and we decided like, listen, we didn't pregame

1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:53.800
 that episode and I happened to be skiing with my family.

1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:58.360
 I had taken the first like vacation since the pandemic started and I was having a wonderful

1:46:58.360 --> 1:46:59.880
 time and then this whole thing blows up.

1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:03.880
 I'm coming off the mountain, just, you know, having a great time with my daughter skiing

1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:07.760
 and, you know, and then I'm mixing it up with him and, you know, he had a short fuse about

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:13.600
 it because he was triggered, he told me because he really feels like he's fighting to defend,

1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:14.600
 you know, the every man.

1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:16.760
 And I was like, that's what my team's doing.

1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:19.200
 That's why they named the company Robin Hood.

1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:21.400
 We're on the same side here.

1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:25.960
 And then over time, we've started to see the explanation come out and, you know, people

1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:28.120
 who are friends are going to have disagreements.

1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:31.920
 In the podcast, it happened to happen very publicly and we didn't know was going to become

1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:35.240
 the number one story in the world.

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:39.320
 If Trump still had his Twitter handle, this would not have been a story.

1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:44.240
 Trump would have said something about GameStop and he would have coopted the entire conversation.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:49.080
 So in a way, going back to our censorship discussion, I might actually be in favor of

1:47:49.080 --> 1:47:57.240
 Trump being censored only because, only because how delightful has it been since January 20th

1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:01.440
 that we can all focus on something other than him.

1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.160
 He was exhausting.

1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:06.440
 I mean, the amount of cycles he took on our processors.

1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:09.000
 He monopolized the conversation.

1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:12.320
 And now this is a little bit more of a distributed like this.

1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:15.200
 Yeah, everybody gets a chance to be the number one new story.

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:17.400
 Everybody gets a chance to discuss it.

1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:20.480
 So on a scale of one to 10, how much do you love Chamath?

1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:21.480
 Oh, it's 11.

1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:23.080
 I mean, I love Chamath.

1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:24.800
 I mean, we played cards last night.

1:48:24.800 --> 1:48:25.800
 We're besties.

1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:29.320
 And, you know, I would literally jump in front of a bullet for him.

1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:30.320
 Yeah.

1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:31.320
 I mean, what's the lesson in that discussion?

1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:32.320
 Because it was super.

1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:33.320
 I wouldn't.

1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:36.320
 I think the love was felt and the respect was felt throughout, even when you guys are

1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:38.800
 going pretty vicious on each other.

1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:40.120
 Is there a lesson to be learned?

1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:41.600
 Do you regret any of that conversation?

1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:42.600
 No.

1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:46.480
 I mean, I think he told me that he regretted some of the things he said publicly on the

1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:47.480
 podcast.

1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:48.480
 Like I said, I was a little hot.

1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:50.960
 I may have said things in the heat of the moment.

1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:53.920
 But I don't live with too much regret because I always think about intent.

1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:58.280
 And it's one of the nuance and intent have been totally lost.

1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:02.280
 The idea that we could have any of kind of a nuanced discussion about things seems to

1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:04.320
 have been forgotten.

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:07.540
 And the fact that people don't look at people's intent.

1:49:07.540 --> 1:49:14.400
 If you hurt somebody's feelings or you disrespect somebody or you do something mean or whatever,

1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:17.040
 I always look at the intent, you know?

1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:22.160
 And I've had people attack me and I look at the intent and I'm like, that person feels

1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:23.440
 bad about themselves.

1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:27.400
 Or maybe I said something and I insulted them and that's why their blowback's there.

1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:30.760
 So I always try to think what's the intent of the person and then almost universally

1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:37.360
 you talk to somebody and you find out you ascribe some crazy intent that's not there.

1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:38.560
 And they're like, oh yeah, you know what happened?

1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:42.960
 I got in a fight with my spouse and I didn't sleep last night and I've had a lot of anxiety

1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:47.600
 about my business and I just snapped and said something about you.

1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:48.600
 And it's like, oh, okay.

1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:54.840
 Like I literally had somebody on Twitter this past summer, I had said something.

1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:58.960
 I was complaining about a New York Times journalist and something I thought was wrong.

1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:01.040
 This person was a fan of that journalist.

1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:05.520
 And they went, I kid you not, onto my social media account, found a picture I had taken

1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:08.880
 about how blue the sky was one day.

1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:11.920
 They reversed image search, the tree line.

1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:16.600
 Found the tree line on Google image search somehow with a reverse image search.

1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:23.240
 Found an old listing that some broker had listed on their website of my house and then

1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:31.200
 posted my home address, the value of my home and doxed me on Twitter.

1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:33.640
 And I'm like, what is going on here?

1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:39.600
 So I call the person and I look them up and they work in private equity in Boston.

1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:45.360
 And I look and I'm like, this person works in Boston, this is July 4th week.

1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:49.080
 And when I look at the person's LinkedIn, we have seven people in common.

1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:52.900
 So going back to the AR conversation, we'll go, I'm like, okay, this person literally

1:50:52.900 --> 1:50:53.900
 just doxed me.

1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:55.000
 I asked him to take it down.

1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.520
 They told me they won't take it down.

1:50:57.520 --> 1:50:58.520
 And then I look at it.

1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:04.880
 So then I DM him back on Instagram, on Twitter and I said, by the way, your boss, Susan,

1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:07.160
 and I know seven people in common.

1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:08.320
 And these are the seven people.

1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:09.960
 Here's the screenshot.

1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:14.680
 What is she going to think when I call her on Monday and you've doxed me?

1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:15.880
 Here's my phone number if you'd like to talk.

1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:16.880
 He calls me.

1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:18.600
 I said, what's going on?

1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:19.600
 Why would you do this?

1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:22.040
 He's like, well, I really pissed off about what you said about this person.

1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:25.920
 You understand, I've had like two or three stalkers, like in anybody who's in high profile

1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:29.560
 like I am, like we're medium profile, you're going to have weird things happen.

1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:32.620
 You literally put my home address, you put my family at risk.

1:51:32.620 --> 1:51:37.320
 What if I put your home address on my, I have 400,000 followers or 300,000 followers.

1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:38.320
 You have like 300.

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:41.040
 What if I post your address?

1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:42.040
 He's like, well, I wish you wouldn't do that.

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:45.160
 I was like, well, I asked you kindly to take my address down.

1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:47.800
 And I said, are you married?

1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:49.120
 I said, how old are you?

1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:50.120
 You like 25 or something?

1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:51.120
 He's like, no, I'm 42.

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:53.240
 I was like, you're 42 years old.

1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:54.240
 I was like, are you married?

1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:55.240
 You have kids?

1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:56.240
 He's like, yeah, I just had a baby like six months ago.

1:51:56.240 --> 1:51:58.240
 I'm like, you're home with your wife.

1:51:58.240 --> 1:51:59.720
 It's July 4th weekend.

1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:04.240
 You're doxing Jason Caliganis because you're upset at me because I said something about

1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:05.960
 a New York Times runner.

1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:08.120
 He's like, yeah, this is the biggest mistake of my life.

1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:12.280
 I said, I tell you what, let's forget it ever happened.

1:52:12.280 --> 1:52:16.880
 And he wrote me back and he said, I just wanted to thank you for how you handled it.

1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:24.120
 My wife said I'm a complete fucking moron and my wife says I'm a complete fucking moron

1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:27.280
 and I'm really sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I wrote it back.

1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:30.600
 I said, I wrote it back and I said, my wife says the same thing to me all the time.

1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:32.600
 She's like, welcome to the club.

1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:33.600
 It's totally fine.

1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:36.600
 But intent, nuance, it matters, right?

1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:39.520
 And the person could be having a bad day and they do something stupid they regret.

1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:40.520
 And what am I going to do?

1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:41.520
 Cancel the guy?

1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:45.480
 Or if I had called his boss, he would have been fired immediately.

1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:50.640
 And then I got to live with this guy, got fired and he's got a kid and what is this

1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:51.640
 personal destruction?

1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:53.160
 Why are we doing this to each other?

1:52:53.160 --> 1:52:54.920
 Life's hard enough.

1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:55.920
 Life's hard, right?

1:52:55.920 --> 1:52:57.880
 Like just get into the days hard.

1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:58.880
 Yeah.

1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:03.480
 And that little bit of empathy, thinking about the intent of the person allows you to then

1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:07.960
 sort of deescalate this kind of conversation that social media wants to escalate.

1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:08.960
 Yes.

1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:09.960
 So social media wants to escalate.

1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:10.960
 Back to what we were saying.

1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:17.120
 This, in my younger years, I would have retweeted the guy's home address and my address and

1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:19.600
 would have called his boss and tried to get him fired or whatever.

1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:23.680
 And it's like, now I'm just like, why are we attacking each other?

1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:24.680
 Life is so hard.

1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:27.720
 I mean, this is what the pandemic I think should make everybody realize is like, look

1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:29.960
 at how hard it is.

1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:30.960
 Life is hard.

1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:33.960
 And then just think about all the people suffering right now who are at home, the single mom

1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:40.360
 or dad with two or three kids at home in public school, maybe they've been laid off and

1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:44.120
 their kids aren't learning and they're in a tiny apartment.

1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:48.120
 I mean, this has been brutal for a lot of people and not to mention people losing loved

1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:51.720
 ones or maybe some people got corona and now their lungs are still not right.

1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:53.520
 Can I ask you about love?

1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:56.020
 Oh, sure.

1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:57.020
 I'm feeling it.

1:53:57.020 --> 1:53:58.920
 You know, like we're an hour or two here, Lexie.

1:53:58.920 --> 1:53:59.920
 Yeah, you feel you're getting.

1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:00.920
 We could become besties.

1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:01.920
 We're good.

1:54:01.920 --> 1:54:02.920
 We're good.

1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:05.040
 I feel like we got a bromance going here, Lex.

1:54:05.040 --> 1:54:06.040
 I feel it too.

1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:09.360
 I don't know if it's Eric Weinstein level, but I feel like it's close.

1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:16.640
 Yeah, I'm feeling the love, but we talked about the, there's music to my ears, your

1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:23.600
 whole rant on the Olympic nature of a startup.

1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:32.560
 Is there a role, like what role does love, family, friendship play in that brutal pursuit

1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:38.920
 of excellence that is building a startup, building a company or creating anything new

1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:40.760
 in this world?

1:54:40.760 --> 1:54:46.400
 Such a great question and totally unprepared for it because I know we would ever ask me

1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:47.400
 about that.

1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:52.200
 So I think it's why you've got quite a following on your podcast is that you're able to ask

1:54:52.200 --> 1:54:53.200
 these questions.

1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:58.440
 And I can tell one story because, you know, I don't talk about, I try not to talk about

1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:03.520
 relationship with Elon that often because, you know, he's so famous now.

1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:04.520
 Yeah.

1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:07.200
 I mean, when we met, I used to go out to parties with him and people like, oh my God, you're

1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:09.200
 Jason Kalkas.

1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:10.200
 I was like, yeah, and like, who's your friend?

1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:11.200
 I'm like, I was my friend Elon.

1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:12.200
 And they'd be like, what?

1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:13.200
 He's doing rocket ship stuff.

1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:14.200
 But he's told this story publicly.

1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:15.200
 So I can tell it.

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:17.440
 I would never talk about anything that he hasn't already talked about publicly, especially

1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:21.000
 since he's a high profile, but it was a pretty funny moment.

1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.040
 He, there was a moment in time when Tesla almost went out of business and you've probably

1:55:25.040 --> 1:55:30.720
 heard the story many times, but it was during the financial crisis and they were running

1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:36.920
 out of money and they said, you know, let's go get a steak.

1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:37.920
 And we're in LA.

1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:43.040
 We drove to Boa and I had my orange Tesla Roadster and he had his P1 or P2, like the

1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:45.920
 red one that I think is in space now.

1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:49.960
 And we drove to the valet and we had a steak together and we're sitting there.

1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:54.120
 And I said, you know, I read the story in Gawker or whatever, you know, in New York

1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:59.160
 Times, you're, you only got like five weeks of money left in Tesla because it's not true.

1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:00.160
 I was like, oh, thank God.

1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:01.160
 He goes, we have two weeks.

1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:02.160
 I was like, oh God.

1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:07.640
 I was like, well, what's going on with the rocket ship company?

1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:08.640
 Yeah.

1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:13.120
 You know, like, you know, I know you did the one last month and don't you have one coming

1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:14.120
 up?

1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:15.120
 He's like, yeah, we got the third one coming up.

1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:16.120
 I was like, well, how's that going?

1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:17.640
 I said, well, we'd blow that one up.

1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:19.600
 There's no more SpaceX.

1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:23.920
 I was like, so two weeks of money left in Tesla and SpaceX, you blew up the first two

1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:25.720
 rockets, you blow up the third SpaceX is over.

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:26.720
 He's like, yeah.

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.480
 I was like, I can load you a couple million dollars.

1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:31.640
 I don't have like a ton.

1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:37.000
 He's like, it's okay, our friend beep has loaned me some money and Elon's been super

1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.000
 public about this.

1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:41.000
 I would never tell a story unless you had him, but he was talking, he never said who

1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:45.200
 it was, but somebody had loaned him money to keep him afloat.

1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:46.600
 He was functionally bankrupt.

1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:49.960
 I mean, he had the equity in the companies, but the equity was quickly becoming worth

1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:54.960
 zero and the financial crisis and he's figuring out if he's going to go on vacation for Christmas

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:55.960
 or not.

1:56:55.960 --> 1:57:00.520
 And he's on the phone trying to, you know, save both companies.

1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:06.400
 And I said, certainly there must be some good news and he takes that as BlackBerry to date

1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:07.400
 this conversation.

1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:08.400
 There are no iPhones.

1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:12.920
 He takes us BlackBerry and he starts swiping and he says, don't tell anybody.

1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:14.120
 This is what I'm building.

1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:19.960
 And he shows me the Model S and nobody knew that he was working on the Model S. We knew

1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:25.280
 he was doing the roadster and was trying to save the company and I looked at it and I

1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:27.880
 was like, that's gorgeous.

1:57:27.880 --> 1:57:28.880
 It was the clay models.

1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.760
 So it was a full size clay model.

1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:34.040
 So there's human beings standing around a clay version of this tiny little BlackBerry

1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:35.040
 picture.

1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:38.560
 I'm scrolling through on the, remember that little pad or the ball on the BlackBerry?

1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:41.560
 I'm scrolling through and I'm like, this is fucking great.

1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:44.920
 And I just said to him, it's like, what's the range going to be?

1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:46.440
 I said, well, I think we get 250 miles.

1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:47.440
 I was like, 250 miles.

1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:49.560
 He's like, yeah, I think it'll be the safest car ever.

1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:51.280
 I said, what is it going to cost?

1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:55.800
 He says, I think this could cost eventually $50,000, $60,000.

1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:00.320
 I said, Elon, if you make that car, you'll change the goddamn world.

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:07.160
 You have to, this company must survive because the roadsters for like 2,000 people in United

1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:11.320
 States, this car is for every person in the United States.

1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:15.280
 Every single person in the United States needs, will want this car if it's $50,000.

1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:18.960
 And maybe some of the people who you have 20 or 30,000 dollars won't be able to afford

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:20.760
 it, but they'll all want it.

1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:21.760
 It's gorgeous.

1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:23.240
 And he said, you really think so?

1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:24.240
 I said, yeah.

1:58:24.240 --> 1:58:27.760
 I got home and I talked to my wife, Jade, and I said, did you have the checkbook?

1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:31.000
 She does all the finances and stuff like that and pays the bills and whatever.

1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:35.320
 And I said, yeah, don't tell anybody, Elon's making this great car.

1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:38.080
 And I wrote two checks for $50,000.

1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:45.080
 And I just took out a piece of paper and I wrote E comma, love the new car, I'll take

1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:46.080
 two.

1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:51.600
 And I signed it, I kissed the two $50,000 checks, put them in the envelope, and I fed

1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:57.880
 that extra to him for Monday delivery, and I said to Jade, that $100,000 is going to

1:58:57.880 --> 1:59:02.160
 be gone in 48 hours because it will pay for one or two days to pay for Tesla.

1:59:02.160 --> 1:59:07.120
 So we just added like instead of two weeks of rowing, he's got 12 days.

1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:12.200
 And the checks don't cash, but then I read a story that he's closed the money, saved

1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:18.600
 the company like the next week or two, and a couple of months later, the checks get cashed.

1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:24.400
 And I'm like, okay, three years later, I get an email, your reservation number, it's

1:59:24.400 --> 1:59:29.760
 from Tesla, your reservation number is 00000001.

1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:35.160
 And then five seconds later, your reservation number is 000073.

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:41.000
 And I forwarded the number one to Elon and I said, I can't take number one, signature

1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:42.000
 number one.

1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:43.000
 I can't take that.

1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.000
 That's yours.

1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:45.600
 And he's like, oh, I got five of them.

1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:48.320
 And besides, you're the first person who ordered it.

1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:49.320
 And I was the first person who had seen it.

1:59:49.320 --> 1:59:51.000
 You're going to give me to be teary eyed.

1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:52.000
 I mean, that's beautiful.

1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:53.500
 That's a beautiful moment.

1:59:53.500 --> 1:59:57.720
 It was an incredible moment for both of us and we talk about it sometimes, those moments

1:59:57.720 --> 1:59:58.720
 in time.

1:59:58.720 --> 1:59:59.720
 And to your point about love.

1:59:59.720 --> 2:00:03.560
 That's like the darkest moment, one of the darkest moments in his life, probably.

2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:07.800
 I think it was, I can tell you it was the darkest period of his life for sure.

2:00:07.800 --> 2:00:09.880
 And he's been very public about how dark that was.

2:00:09.880 --> 2:00:14.120
 And I think this is why I have great sympathy for the entrepreneurs of the world, like the

2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:15.600
 suffering and the pain.

2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:18.880
 And when he talks about the suffering and the pain that all of these founders have felt,

2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:22.240
 and then we were throwing rocks at them or criticizing them as they try to change the

2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:23.240
 world and save humanity.

2:00:23.240 --> 2:00:28.520
 And in Tesla's case, I mean, they weren't, you know, they weren't like delivering pizza.

2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:31.400
 I mean, they were trying to get us off of fossil fuels.

2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:37.080
 Like this was a big, heady mission to literally save the environment, the planet, humanity.

2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:41.640
 And the way they shorted that stock and they attacked him, it was always perplexing to me

2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:49.480
 why any human being who is standing on God's green earth would want to throw rocks at the

2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:56.760
 guy who is trying to stem the dam of global warming that is about to engulf all of us.

2:00:56.760 --> 2:01:00.200
 How dare they throw rocks at that guy?

2:01:00.200 --> 2:01:02.240
 There's so many people you could throw rocks at.

2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:08.000
 There's somebody who's making the jewel vaporizer throw rocks at that scumbag, no offense.

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.200
 But like whoever's making the jewel things and is, you know, selling pina colada flavor

2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:16.320
 to 12 year olds, like throw rocks at them.

2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:22.320
 Somebody's doing something, you know, abhorrent, but not E. I mean, and yeah, anyway, that

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:28.520
 car is, you know, up the road here, sitting under a cover with 20,000 miles on it in my

2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:29.520
 garage.

2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:32.760
 And then the roads are number 16s in the garage next to it.

2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:36.080
 And every day I walk by the two of them and I get a warm feeling in my heart because I

2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:40.960
 know you did it, against all odds, against all odds.

2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:48.560
 He pulled it off and it was that moment, that month in that 2000, I think it was probably

2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:53.400
 December, January, December of 2008, I think, it was just 12 years ago when you think about

2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:54.400
 13 years ago.

2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:55.400
 It was dark.

2:01:55.400 --> 2:01:56.400
 I mean, it was dark.

2:01:56.400 --> 2:02:00.520
 And they almost had the same thing happen, you know, in the Model 3 production in June

2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:02.600
 of two years, three years ago.

2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:06.520
 And I remember him just trying to get the Model 3 out the door and the company almost

2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:07.840
 crashed then.

2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:10.800
 Most of these companies have, you know, these kind of moments.

2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:14.880
 And I think friendship is you get what you give.

2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:16.680
 You get what you give.

2:02:16.680 --> 2:02:22.400
 And if you are there for people, you're going to feel so good about having done that.

2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:30.160
 And then the reciprocation effect, which you probably know very well, is so great in the

2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:35.320
 world that any time you're kind to people, you build this incredible bond and then what

2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:41.400
 are we at the end of the day, Lex, besides a series of memories with the people we love.

2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:42.400
 That's all it is.

2:02:42.400 --> 2:02:45.680
 It's just a series of memories and moments.

2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:46.680
 It's just moments.

2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:48.680
 You ever see Blade Runner?

2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:49.680
 Yes, of course.

2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:54.040
 Do you remember what Rucker Harris says at the end, all of these memories gone like tears

2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:55.040
 in the rain?

2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:56.040
 Yeah.

2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:57.040
 I mean, that's our existence.

2:02:57.040 --> 2:02:59.480
 It just all goes away at some point.

2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:01.560
 It's just these drops of rain.

2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:06.000
 Each of those memories, just like one snowflake or one drop of rain, and they're all lost

2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.440
 at some point, but they're here now.

2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:10.640
 And that's why we have to be there for each other.

2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:15.760
 That's why I feel like what I do is so important in this world, and I get such great meaning

2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:19.080
 out of it, just being a friend, just having these conversations.

2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:24.360
 What you're doing on your podcast, just talking to intelligent people and spreading the word

2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:28.640
 and the gospel of what they're saying and amplifying it.

2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:30.000
 You're inspiring so many people.

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:34.200
 Every podcast, you get 500,000 people, a million people watch these videos, and there's some

2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:39.920
 kid in Sri Lanka or some little girl in Afghanistan who's going to stumble upon this on YouTube,

2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:46.320
 and they're going to change the world in the next century because it's not just about America.

2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:48.320
 Our story is almost over.

2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:50.000
 We were the story of the last 200, 300 years.

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.080
 I hope it keeps going, but there's all these other places in the world, San Paolo and Africa,

2:03:55.080 --> 2:04:00.800
 where people now have access to these videos, and somebody will hear this video and go,

2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:01.800
 Elon did it.

2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:06.880
 Oh, and that guy, Jason, was his friend, and Lex does those interviews with the, oh yeah,

2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:08.040
 I could do it too.

2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:13.560
 Your little magical moment of love amidst the suffering with Elon, because you've talked

2:04:13.560 --> 2:04:15.480
 about it, it'll have these ripple effects.

2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:20.720
 It's fascinating to think about it in decades to come, and new entrepreneurs being born,

2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:27.480
 new, more love being put out there, and more support through these rough times when people

2:04:27.480 --> 2:04:29.160
 are trying to create new things.

2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:34.760
 I mean, that's a beautiful thing, that's a beautiful, I'm glad you think of friendship

2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:36.760
 in this way.

2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:42.080
 I'm deeply grateful that you're loyal in the way you are.

2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:45.760
 Here's the thing, it costs you nothing to make this investment either.

2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:53.840
 The amount of time it takes to be bitter, or angry, sitting at home, to be disappointed,

2:04:53.840 --> 2:04:58.320
 you could just channel that same amount of energy into being loyal, loving, kind, and

2:04:58.320 --> 2:04:59.760
 there for people.

2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:05.440
 It just only takes the intention, right, those emotions are gonna flow, right, like Sam would

2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:10.280
 always tell me when I was struggling in my life, and I talked to him, he'd say, Jason,

2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:13.080
 your brain is spewing all these ideas.

2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:17.280
 Even you're standing by a river, and the river is all your ideas.

2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:20.760
 You are not a slave to any one of these ideas, you're just whipping by, like each of those

2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:22.400
 little waves in the river.

2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:26.760
 You can pick one of those ideas out and look at it and examine it, and either keep it or

2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:31.320
 throw it back in the river and let it go, and I was like, wow, Sam, that was like, of

2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:34.720
 my entire friendship with Sam Harris, that was like the one moment where I was just like,

2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:41.440
 oh my God, all my life I've wondered about all these thoughts in my head, insecurities,

2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:47.280
 you know, imposter syndrome, like I didn't go to MIT, you know, I'm not the smartest

2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:53.800
 guy, but somehow I made a career writing little 50K checks, and now, you know, $3 million

2:05:53.800 --> 2:05:56.840
 checks, but whatever, you know, little checks and being a journalist and doing this little

2:05:56.840 --> 2:06:02.440
 podcast, and it's ended up to something, and I kind of, I'm proud of it, I'm 50, and I'm

2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:07.080
 kind of proud of what I did, and I wake up every morning, I could retire, and I say,

2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:12.400
 I kind of like what I do, I kind of like having the conversation and writing the check and

2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:17.400
 then being on somebody's team, and I got offered to be in these giant mega funds, and they

2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:22.200
 said, Jason, you're in it, you invest in 60 companies a year, you know, 500K at a time,

2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:28.160
 you put $30 million a year to work, come work with us, write $150 million check, and then

2:06:28.160 --> 2:06:35.640
 you can go to Aspen and Cabo and Coachella and not work, but why are you doing all this

2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:40.520
 work? It's like, well, the $50 million check is like, it's like a formality, it's just

2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:44.360
 like being an ATM, like the companies are already huge by that time. I really want to

2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:49.560
 meet the two people with the idea, I want to meet them in year one, I want to meet them

2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:54.040
 on day zero, I want to be the guy who wrote the first, second, or third check, I want

2:06:54.040 --> 2:06:58.080
 a guy who wrote the 3,000th check, the last check, it's fucking boring.

2:06:58.080 --> 2:07:02.640
 And make that basic human connection, and also be there and be with them after the rough

2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:07.680
 times, be with them with that first, I mean, the first early successes, I mean, that's

2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:08.680
 a beautiful.

2:07:08.680 --> 2:07:14.880
 So great, when a founder and their team get product market fit, and you just know it's

2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:23.240
 going to work, oh man, Lex, it's when Calm would email me and they'd say, the company's

2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:27.120
 been growing and we're not going to go out of business, but we added some sleep stuff

2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:33.880
 and then we added this other function and we have a streak now and we grew 10x in the

2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:41.920
 last three months, and we're good, I was like, ah, that's nice, it's real nice, it's a nice

2:07:41.920 --> 2:07:42.920
 feeling.

2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:49.440
 Well, because so many of them die, we talked about that J curve early, imagine it's like

2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:53.520
 all these baby turtles going out to the ocean and the seagulls are ripping them to shreds

2:07:53.520 --> 2:07:58.680
 and then their sharks are eating them, but then like a couple of the turtles make it

2:07:58.680 --> 2:08:04.080
 and they become wise old 100 year old turtles, you know, and you're like, yep, I remember

2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:09.680
 when you catched and like all of your brothers and sisters were ripped to shreds by the seagulls

2:08:09.680 --> 2:08:13.920
 and you made it into the water, and then you made it out into the deep water, a pretty

2:08:13.920 --> 2:08:14.920
 great feeling.

2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:21.040
 I think there's no better way to end it, the talk of the cruelty of life, the suffering

2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:26.320
 that is life, and the love amidst the suffering, Jason, I've been a fan of yours for a long

2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:32.840
 time, you're one of the most special people in Silicon Valley, and maybe you'll also call

2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:36.320
 me in one of the rough times, and I'm sure there'll be many.

2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:41.560
 There will be, yeah, you know, there's one expression, nobody gets there alone, nobody

2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:46.440
 gets there alone, and anybody who thinks that they got there alone is delusional and kidding

2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:51.200
 themselves, and they will at some point wake up and realize, oh, shit, there were a lot

2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:54.440
 of people who helped me get here, I need to write a couple of gratitude letters.

2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:58.920
 I got a gratitude letter the other day from a friend of mine who I helped, and I was one

2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.120
 of the, you know about these gratitude letters people are writing?

2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:07.520
 It turns out Martin Seligman in, was it authentic happiness?

2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:13.680
 Anyway, the guy who really studied happiness and joy, turns out one of the greatest amplifiers

2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:19.160
 of joy in your life is to thank somebody for doing something for you, and somebody who

2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:24.040
 I had helped just wrote me a letter, and I got in Christmas, and I had the stack of Christmas

2:09:24.040 --> 2:09:27.960
 cards, and I hadn't opened them, and it's the second week of January, and I was just

2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:33.160
 getting to like the last stack, and I opened it up, and I almost missed it, this is incredibly

2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:38.000
 heartwarming letter about how meaningful like certain things I had done to help along the

2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:45.280
 way, and how he'd always appreciated my counsel, and I was just like, well, this happened 25

2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:50.400
 years ago, and you wrote this letter now, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks, and

2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:54.720
 I was just like, wow, you know, if you're hearing this, there's probably 10 people who

2:09:54.720 --> 2:09:59.760
 were really instrumental in your lives, in your lives, go ahead and call them on the

2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:05.480
 phone, write them an email, or even better, just write a letter, and send it to them,

2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:09.640
 and just tell them you're thankful, and let me tell you something, the amplification

2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:15.680
 of joy in your life will go 100X, 100X, when you tell somebody you love them, and that

2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:19.960
 you really appreciate them, and that what they did for you was magical, so just, and

2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:23.600
 you can look it up gratitude, gratitude is like one of these incredible forces.

2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:24.600
 Amen.

2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:26.600
 I'm grateful for being on the pod.

2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:27.600
 I'm grateful.

2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:31.880
 You wasted all this time with me, I love it.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from the man himself, Jason Calacanis.

2:10:55.800 --> 2:11:00.680
 The number one reason a startup shuts down is not running out of money.

2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:07.040
 The number one reason a startup fails is that the founder gives up.

2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:33.400
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
