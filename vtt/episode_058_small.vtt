00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
 The following is a conversation with Michael Stevens,

00:02.680 --> 00:04.500
 the creator of Vsauce,

00:04.500 --> 00:07.000
 one of the most popular educational YouTube channels

00:07.000 --> 00:10.080
 in the world, with over 15 million subscribers

00:10.080 --> 00:13.040
 and over 1.7 billion views.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.160
 His videos often ask and answer questions

00:16.160 --> 00:18.760
 that are both profound and entertaining,

00:18.760 --> 00:21.800
 spanning topics from physics to psychology.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.440
 Popular questions include what if everyone jumped at once

00:25.440 --> 00:27.680
 or what if the sun disappeared

00:27.680 --> 00:32.680
 or why are things creepy or what if the earth stopped spinning?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.040
 As part of his channel,

00:34.040 --> 00:36.320
 he created three seasons of Mind Field,

00:36.320 --> 00:38.760
 a series that explored human behavior.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.640
 His curiosity and passion are contagious

00:41.640 --> 00:44.080
 and inspiring to millions of people.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.240
 And so as an educator,

00:45.240 --> 00:47.540
 his impact and contribution to the world

00:47.540 --> 00:49.780
 is truly immeasurable.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.840
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.200
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:55.200 --> 00:57.160
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

00:57.160 --> 00:58.600
 support it on Patreon,

00:58.600 --> 01:00.640
 or simply connect with me on Twitter.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.800
 I'm Alex Friedman, spelled FRIDMAN.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.120
 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.760
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

01:10.760 --> 01:12.720
 and never any ads in the middle

01:12.720 --> 01:14.760
 that break the flow of the conversation.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.120
 I hope that works for you

01:16.120 --> 01:19.000
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.480
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:21.480 --> 01:24.000
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.560
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

01:26.560 --> 01:28.280
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.720
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.480
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

01:33.480 --> 01:34.960
 You can buy fractions of a stock,

01:34.960 --> 01:38.280
 say $1 a worth, no matter what the stock price is.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.880
 Broker's services are provided by Cash App Investing,

01:40.880 --> 01:44.240
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.200
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

01:46.200 --> 01:49.120
 to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,

01:49.120 --> 01:52.440
 best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.960
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

01:55.960 --> 01:57.720
 in over 110 countries

01:57.720 --> 02:00.320
 and have a perfect rating on charity navigator,

02:00.320 --> 02:01.600
 which means the donated money

02:01.600 --> 02:04.280
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.320
 When you get Cash App from the App Store,

02:06.320 --> 02:09.880
 Google Play and use code LEX Podcast,

02:09.880 --> 02:13.760
 you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

02:13.760 --> 02:15.480
 which again is an organization

02:15.480 --> 02:18.360
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

02:18.360 --> 02:21.680
 to dream of engineering a better world.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.960
 And now here's my conversation with Michael Stevens.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.280
 One of your deeper interests is psychology,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.760
 understanding human behavior.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.480
 You've pointed out how messy studying human behavior is

02:35.480 --> 02:37.440
 and that it's far from the scientific rigor

02:37.440 --> 02:40.880
 of something like physics, for example.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.640
 How do you think we can take psychology

02:43.640 --> 02:45.680
 from where it's been in the 20th century

02:45.680 --> 02:49.080
 to something more like what the physicists,

02:49.080 --> 02:50.480
 theoretical physicists are doing,

02:50.480 --> 02:52.360
 something precise, something rigorous?

02:53.280 --> 02:55.440
 Well, we could do it by

02:56.760 --> 03:01.200
 finding the physical foundations of psychology, right?

03:01.200 --> 03:05.040
 If all of our emotions and moods and feelings

03:05.040 --> 03:10.040
 and behaviors are the result of mechanical behaviors

03:10.400 --> 03:12.800
 of atoms and molecules in our brains,

03:12.800 --> 03:15.400
 then can we find correlations?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.760
 Perhaps like chaos makes that really difficult

03:17.760 --> 03:19.520
 and the uncertainty principle and all these things.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.760
 We can't know the position and velocity

03:22.760 --> 03:27.160
 of every single quantum state in a brain, probably,

03:27.160 --> 03:32.160
 but I think that if we can get to that point

03:32.320 --> 03:35.480
 with psychology, then we can start to think about

03:36.440 --> 03:40.960
 consciousness in a physical and mathematical way.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.760
 When we ask questions like, well, what is self reference?

03:44.760 --> 03:47.320
 How can you think about yourself thinking?

03:47.320 --> 03:49.160
 What are some mathematical structures

03:49.160 --> 03:52.400
 that could bring that about?

03:52.400 --> 03:55.560
 There's ideas of, in terms of consciousness

03:55.560 --> 03:59.240
 and breaking it down into physics.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.400
 There's ideas of panpsychism where people believe

04:02.400 --> 04:04.840
 that whatever consciousness is,

04:04.840 --> 04:07.480
 is a fundamental part of reality.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.880
 It's almost like a physics law.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.560
 Do you think, what's your views on consciousness?

04:11.560 --> 04:15.600
 Do you think it has this deep part of reality

04:15.600 --> 04:17.840
 or is it something that's deeply human

04:17.840 --> 04:19.480
 and constructed by us humans?

04:21.640 --> 04:24.960
 Starting nice and light and easy.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.240
 Nothing I ask you today has actually proven answer,

04:28.240 --> 04:29.720
 so we're just hypothesizing.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.600
 So yeah, I mean, I should clarify,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.720
 this is all speculation and I'm not an expert

04:33.720 --> 04:36.440
 in any of these topics and I'm not God,

04:36.440 --> 04:41.120
 but I think that consciousness is probably

04:43.240 --> 04:45.640
 something that can be fully explained

04:45.640 --> 04:48.160
 within the laws of physics.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.560
 I think that our bodies and brains

04:51.560 --> 04:54.320
 and the universe and at the quantum level

04:54.320 --> 04:57.000
 is so rich and complex,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.240
 I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a room

04:59.240 --> 05:04.240
 for consciousness there and why should we be conscious?

05:05.120 --> 05:06.880
 Why are we aware of ourselves?

05:06.880 --> 05:11.120
 That is a very strange and interesting

05:11.120 --> 05:13.640
 and important question and I think

05:13.640 --> 05:15.600
 for the next few thousand years,

05:15.600 --> 05:20.160
 we're going to have to believe in answers purely on faith,

05:20.160 --> 05:25.040
 but my guess is that we will find that

05:25.040 --> 05:27.040
 within the configuration space

05:27.040 --> 05:29.800
 of possible arrangements of the universe,

05:29.800 --> 05:34.120
 there are some that contain memories of others.

05:34.120 --> 05:38.080
 Literally, Julian Barber calls them time capsule states

05:38.080 --> 05:40.360
 where you're like, yeah, not only do I have a scratch

05:40.360 --> 05:43.120
 on my arm, but also this state of the universe

05:43.120 --> 05:45.680
 also contains a memory in my head

05:45.680 --> 05:48.520
 of being scratched by my cat three days ago

05:48.520 --> 05:52.920
 and for some reason, those kinds of states of the universe

05:52.920 --> 05:55.760
 are more plentiful or more likely.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.040
 When you say those states,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.960
 the ones that contain memories of its past

05:59.960 --> 06:02.720
 or ones that contain memories of its past

06:02.720 --> 06:05.360
 and have degrees of consciousness.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.600
 Just the first part because I think the consciousness

06:08.600 --> 06:11.400
 then emerges from the fact

06:11.400 --> 06:14.320
 that a state of the universe that contains

06:15.440 --> 06:18.600
 fragments or memories of other states

06:19.640 --> 06:22.560
 is one where you're going to feel like there's time.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.120
 You're going to feel like, yeah,

06:24.120 --> 06:26.400
 things happened in the past

06:26.400 --> 06:28.000
 and I don't know what'll happen in the future

06:28.000 --> 06:29.600
 because these states don't contain information

06:29.600 --> 06:30.760
 about the future.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.000
 For some reason, those kind of states

06:34.000 --> 06:38.240
 are either more common, more plentiful

06:38.240 --> 06:40.840
 or you could use the anthropic principle and just say,

06:40.840 --> 06:42.480
 well, they're extremely rare,

06:42.480 --> 06:45.720
 but until you are in one or if you are in one,

06:45.720 --> 06:46.880
 then you can ask questions

06:46.880 --> 06:49.720
 like you're asking me on this podcast.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
 Why questions?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.560
 Yeah, it's like, why are we conscious?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.400
 Well, because if we weren't,

06:53.400 --> 06:55.240
 we wouldn't be asking why we were.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.480
 You've kind of implied that you have a sense,

06:59.480 --> 07:02.360
 again, hypothesis theorizing

07:02.360 --> 07:05.560
 that the universe is deterministic.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.040
 What's your thoughts about free will?

07:08.040 --> 07:10.320
 Do you think of the universe as deterministic

07:10.320 --> 07:13.960
 in a sense that it's unrolling a particular,

07:13.960 --> 07:17.920
 like it's operating under a specific set of physical laws

07:17.920 --> 07:21.320
 and when you have set the initial conditions,

07:21.320 --> 07:23.480
 it will unroll in the exact same way

07:23.480 --> 07:28.440
 in our particular line of the universe every time?

07:28.440 --> 07:31.600
 That is a very useful way to think about the universe.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.440
 It's done us well.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.720
 It's brought us to the moon.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.800
 It's brought us to where we are today, right?

07:36.880 --> 07:40.280
 I would not say that I believe in determinism

07:40.280 --> 07:43.160
 in that kind of an absolute form.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.520
 Or actually, I just don't care.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.720
 Maybe it's true,

07:46.720 --> 07:48.840
 but I'm not gonna live my life like it is.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.880
 What in your sense,

07:50.880 --> 07:54.120
 because you've studied kind of how we humans

07:54.120 --> 07:55.800
 think of the world,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.960
 what's in your view is the difference

07:57.960 --> 07:59.200
 between our perception,

07:59.200 --> 08:02.320
 like how we think the world is and reality.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.120
 Do you think there's a huge gap there?

08:04.120 --> 08:07.240
 Like we dilute ourselves as the whole thing is an illusion,

08:07.240 --> 08:09.360
 just everything about human psychology,

08:09.360 --> 08:12.880
 the way we see things and how things actually are.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.760
 All the things you've studied, what's your sense?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.920
 How big is the gap between reality and perception?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.920
 Well, again, purely speculative,

08:18.920 --> 08:20.960
 I think that we will never know the answer.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.600
 We cannot know the answer.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.960
 There is no experiment to find an answer to that question.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.240
 Everything we experience is an event in our brain.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.880
 When I look at a cat, I'm not even,

08:34.080 --> 08:36.680
 I can't prove that there's a cat there.

08:36.680 --> 08:40.920
 All I am experiencing is the perception of a cat

08:40.920 --> 08:43.120
 inside my own brain.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.320
 I am only a witness to the events of my mind.

08:46.320 --> 08:50.080
 I think it is very useful to infer that

08:50.080 --> 08:54.120
 if I witness the event of cat in my head,

08:54.120 --> 08:57.200
 it's because I'm looking at a cat that is literally there

08:57.200 --> 09:00.040
 and has its own feelings and motivations

09:00.040 --> 09:03.080
 and should be pet and given food and water and love.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.920
 I think that's the way you should live your life.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.480
 But whether or not we live in a simulation,

09:09.480 --> 09:13.040
 I'm a brain in a vat, I don't know.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.880
 Do you care?

09:14.880 --> 09:17.480
 I don't really, well, I care

09:17.480 --> 09:19.560
 because it's a fascinating question.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.040
 And it's a fantastic way to get people excited

09:22.040 --> 09:25.000
 about all kinds of topics,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.080
 physics, psychology, consciousness, philosophy.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.040
 But at the end of the day, what would the difference be?

09:31.040 --> 09:31.880
 If you...

09:31.880 --> 09:33.800
 The cat needs to be fed at the end of the day.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.680
 Otherwise, it'll be a dead cat.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.440
 Right, but if it's not even a real cat,

09:38.440 --> 09:40.360
 then it's just like a video game cat.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.480
 And right, so what's the difference

09:42.480 --> 09:45.840
 between killing a digital cat in a video game

09:45.840 --> 09:48.360
 because of neglect versus a real cat?

09:48.360 --> 09:50.600
 It seems very different to us psychologically.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.920
 Like I don't really feel bad about,

09:51.920 --> 09:54.440
 oh my gosh, I forgot to feed my Tamagotchi, right?

09:54.440 --> 09:55.840
 But I would feel terrible

09:55.840 --> 09:59.000
 if I forgot to feed my actual cats.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.480
 So can you just touch on the topic of simulation?

10:03.480 --> 10:05.680
 Do you find this thought experiment

10:05.680 --> 10:07.640
 that we're living in a simulation

10:07.640 --> 10:11.600
 useful, inspiring, or constructive in any kind of way?

10:11.600 --> 10:13.000
 Do you think it's ridiculous?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.040
 Do you think it could be true?

10:15.040 --> 10:17.560
 Or is it just a useful thought experiment?

10:17.560 --> 10:20.960
 I think it is extremely useful as a thought experiment

10:20.960 --> 10:24.720
 because it makes sense to everyone,

10:24.720 --> 10:28.520
 especially as we see virtual reality in computer games

10:28.520 --> 10:30.640
 getting more and more complex.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.920
 You're not talking to an audience in Newton's time

10:33.920 --> 10:36.680
 where you're like, imagine a clock

10:36.680 --> 10:38.840
 that it has mechanics in it that are so complex

10:38.840 --> 10:40.280
 that it can create love.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.440
 And everyone's like, no.

10:42.440 --> 10:46.560
 But today, you really start to feel, man,

10:46.560 --> 10:49.000
 at what point is this little robot friend of mine

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
 gonna be like someone I don't want to cancel plans with?

10:56.040 --> 10:59.080
 And so it's a great, the thought experiment

10:59.080 --> 11:00.360
 of do we live in a simulation?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.840
 Am I a brain in a vat that is just being given

11:03.840 --> 11:08.840
 electrical impulses from some nefarious other beings

11:09.040 --> 11:11.080
 so that I believe that I live on Earth

11:11.080 --> 11:13.120
 and that I have a body and all of this?

11:13.120 --> 11:15.560
 And the fact that you can't prove it either way

11:15.560 --> 11:17.560
 is a fantastic way to introduce people

11:17.560 --> 11:19.880
 to some of the deepest questions.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.160
 So you mentioned a little buddy

11:23.160 --> 11:25.760
 that you would want to cancel an appointment with.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.840
 So that's a lot of our conversations.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.800
 That's what my research is, it's artificial intelligence.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.560
 And I apologize, but you're such a fun person

11:34.560 --> 11:36.920
 to ask these big questions with.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.240
 Well, I hope I can give some answers that are interesting.

11:40.240 --> 11:45.240
 Well, because of you've sharpened your brain's ability

11:45.240 --> 11:47.160
 to explore some of the most,

11:47.160 --> 11:49.160
 some of the questions that many scientists

11:49.160 --> 11:52.400
 are actually afraid of even touching, which is fascinating.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.040
 And I think you're in that sense,

11:54.040 --> 11:56.600
 ultimately a great scientist

11:56.600 --> 11:58.960
 through this process of sharpening your brain.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.760
 Well, I don't know if I am a scientist.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.960
 I think science is a way of knowing

12:04.960 --> 12:09.480
 and there are a lot of questions I investigate

12:09.480 --> 12:12.000
 that are not scientific questions.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.240
 On like minefield, we have definitely done

12:14.240 --> 12:16.680
 scientific experiments and studies

12:16.680 --> 12:18.800
 that had hypotheses and all of that,

12:18.800 --> 12:22.520
 but not to be too precious about

12:22.520 --> 12:24.240
 what does the word science mean?

12:24.240 --> 12:27.640
 But I think I would just describe myself as curious

12:27.640 --> 12:29.960
 and I hope that that curiosity is contagious.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.880
 So to you, the scientific method

12:31.880 --> 12:33.760
 is deeply connected to science

12:33.760 --> 12:38.320
 because your curiosity took you to asking questions.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.680
 To me, asking a good question,

12:41.920 --> 12:44.520
 even if you feel society feels

12:44.520 --> 12:46.480
 that it's not a question within the reach of science

12:46.480 --> 12:49.120
 currently, to me, asking the question

12:49.120 --> 12:53.360
 is the biggest step of the scientific process.

12:53.360 --> 12:57.280
 The scientific method is the second part

12:57.280 --> 12:59.440
 and that may be what traditionally is called science,

12:59.440 --> 13:00.880
 but to me, asking the questions,

13:00.880 --> 13:03.040
 being brave enough to ask the questions,

13:03.040 --> 13:05.040
 being curious and not constrained

13:05.040 --> 13:07.320
 by what you're supposed to think

13:07.320 --> 13:11.600
 is just true, what it means to be a scientist to me.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.280
 It's certainly a huge part of what it means to be a human.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.120
 If I were to say, you know what, I don't believe in forces.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.120
 I think that when I push on a massive object,

13:22.120 --> 13:25.680
 a ghost leaves my body and enters the object I'm pushing

13:25.680 --> 13:28.040
 and these ghosts happen to just get really lazy

13:28.040 --> 13:29.760
 when they're around massive things

13:29.760 --> 13:31.200
 and that's why F equals MA.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.360
 Oh, and by the way, the laziness of the ghost

13:34.360 --> 13:36.320
 is in proportion to the mass of the object.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.760
 So boom, proved me wrong.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.040
 Every experiment, well, you can never find the ghost.

13:41.040 --> 13:45.880
 And so none of that theory is scientific,

13:45.880 --> 13:49.400
 but once I start saying, can I see the ghost?

13:49.400 --> 13:50.880
 Why should there be a ghost?

13:50.880 --> 13:53.120
 And if there aren't ghosts, what might I expect?

13:53.120 --> 13:56.560
 And I start to do different tests to see

13:56.560 --> 13:58.000
 is this falsifiable?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.600
 Are there things that should happen

14:00.600 --> 14:02.760
 if there are ghosts or things that shouldn't happen?

14:02.760 --> 14:05.120
 And do they, you know, what do I observe?

14:05.120 --> 14:06.920
 Now I'm thinking scientifically.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.960
 I don't think of science as, wow, a picture of a black hole.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.880
 That's just a photograph, that's an image, that's data,

14:13.880 --> 14:16.480
 that's a sensory and perception experience.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.640
 Science is how we got that and how we understand it

14:19.640 --> 14:20.680
 and how we believe in it

14:20.680 --> 14:24.040
 and how we reduce our uncertainty around what it means.

14:24.040 --> 14:28.280
 But I would say I'm deeply within the scientific community

14:28.280 --> 14:33.280
 and I'm sometimes disheartened by the elitism of the thinking,

14:33.280 --> 14:36.280
 the sort of not allowing yourself to think outside the box.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.880
 So allowing the possibility

14:37.880 --> 14:40.040
 of going against the conventions of science,

14:40.040 --> 14:43.720
 I think is a beautiful part

14:43.720 --> 14:46.280
 of some of the greatest scientists in history.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.840
 I don't know, I'm impressed by scientists every day.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.840
 And revolutions in our knowledge of the world occur

14:58.480 --> 15:00.760
 only under very special circumstances.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.680
 It is very scary to challenge conventional thinking

15:05.680 --> 15:10.480
 and risky because let's go back to elitism and ego, right?

15:10.480 --> 15:11.440
 If you just say, you know what?

15:11.440 --> 15:14.040
 I believe in the spirits of my body

15:14.040 --> 15:17.920
 and all forces are actually created by invisible creatures

15:17.920 --> 15:21.160
 that transfer themselves between objects.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.680
 If you ridicule every other theory

15:26.680 --> 15:30.120
 and say that you're correct, then ego gets involved

15:30.120 --> 15:31.680
 and you just don't go anywhere.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.640
 But fundamentally the question of well, what is a force

15:36.800 --> 15:38.560
 is incredibly important.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.040
 We need to have that conversation

15:40.040 --> 15:42.640
 but it needs to be done in this very political way

15:42.640 --> 15:44.640
 of like let's be respectful of everyone

15:44.640 --> 15:46.920
 and let's realize that we're all learning together

15:46.920 --> 15:48.960
 and not shutting out other people.

15:48.960 --> 15:53.960
 And so when you look at a lot of revolutionary ideas,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.440
 they were not accepted right away.

15:57.440 --> 16:02.080
 And Galileo had a couple of problems with the authorities

16:02.080 --> 16:05.280
 and later thinkers, Descartes was like, all right,

16:05.280 --> 16:06.960
 look, I kind of agree with Galileo

16:06.960 --> 16:11.360
 but I'm gonna have to not say that.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.840
 I'll have to create and invent

16:12.840 --> 16:14.120
 and write different things that keep me

16:14.120 --> 16:15.080
 from being in trouble.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.320
 But we still slowly made progress.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.240
 Revolutions are difficult in all forms

16:19.240 --> 16:20.480
 and certainly in science.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.840
 Before we get to AI on topic of revolutionary ideas,

16:23.840 --> 16:28.840
 let me ask on Reddit, AMA, you said that is the earth flat?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.600
 Is one of the favorite questions you've ever answered.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.640
 Speaking of revolutionary ideas.

16:33.640 --> 16:37.080
 So your video on that people should definitely watch

16:37.080 --> 16:38.840
 is really fascinating.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.120
 Can you elaborate why you enjoyed answering

16:42.120 --> 16:43.800
 this question so much?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.600
 Yeah, well, it's a long story.

16:45.600 --> 16:49.360
 I remember a long time ago,

16:49.360 --> 16:50.920
 I was living in New York at the time.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.960
 So it had to have been like 2009 or something.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.600
 I visited the Flat Earth forums.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.840
 And this was before the Flat Earth theories became

17:00.840 --> 17:03.160
 as sort of mainstream as they are.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.720
 Aside to ask the dumb question forums, online forums.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.040
 Yeah, the Flat Earth Society,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.200
 I don't know if it's.com or.org, but I went there

17:11.200 --> 17:14.200
 and I was reading their ideas

17:14.200 --> 17:17.840
 and how they responded to typical criticisms of,

17:17.840 --> 17:20.240
 well, the earth isn't flat because what about this?

17:20.240 --> 17:23.760
 And I could not tell, and I mentioned this in my video,

17:23.760 --> 17:28.640
 I couldn't tell how many of these community members

17:28.640 --> 17:31.400
 actually believe the earth was flat or were just trolling.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.320
 And I realized that the fascinating thing is,

17:36.320 --> 17:38.480
 how do we know anything?

17:38.480 --> 17:41.640
 And what makes for a good belief

17:41.640 --> 17:45.280
 versus a maybe not so tenable or good belief?

17:45.280 --> 17:47.600
 And so that's really what my video

17:47.600 --> 17:49.960
 about earth being flat is about.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.480
 It's about, look, there are a lot of reasons.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.720
 The earth is probably not flat,

17:57.040 --> 18:00.640
 but a Flat Earth believer can respond

18:00.640 --> 18:02.440
 to every single one of them.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.160
 But it's all in an ad hoc way.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.800
 And all of these, all of their rebuttals

18:05.800 --> 18:10.800
 aren't necessarily gonna form a cohesive, noncontradictory hole.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.560
 And I believe that's the episode

18:12.560 --> 18:15.000
 where I talk about Occam's razor

18:15.000 --> 18:17.440
 and Newton's flaming laser sword.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.520
 And then I say, well, you know what, wait a second,

18:19.520 --> 18:24.520
 we know that space contracts as you move.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.240
 And so to a particle moving near the speed of light

18:27.240 --> 18:29.600
 towards earth, earth would be flattened

18:29.600 --> 18:32.200
 in the direction of that particle's travel.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.560
 So to them, earth is flat.

18:35.560 --> 18:40.560
 Like we need to be really generous to even wild ideas

18:41.000 --> 18:43.800
 because they're all thinking.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.840
 They're all the communication of ideas.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.240
 And what else can it mean to be a human?

18:48.240 --> 18:53.240
 Yeah, and I think I'm a huge fan of the Flat Earth theory,

18:54.160 --> 18:57.520
 quote unquote, in the sense that to me it feels harmless

18:57.520 --> 18:59.000
 to explore some of the questions

18:59.000 --> 19:00.480
 of what it means to believe something,

19:00.480 --> 19:05.000
 what it means to explore the edge of science and so on.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.160
 Because it's a harm, it's a, to me,

19:07.160 --> 19:09.680
 nobody gets hurt whether the earth is flat around,

19:09.680 --> 19:11.840
 not literally, but I mean intellectually

19:11.840 --> 19:13.360
 when we're just having a conversation.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.760
 That said, again, to elitism,

19:16.680 --> 19:20.080
 I find that scientists roll their eyes way too fast

19:20.080 --> 19:21.400
 on the Flat Earth.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.520
 The kind of dismissal that I see to this even notion,

19:25.520 --> 19:27.760
 they haven't like sat down and say,

19:27.760 --> 19:30.160
 what are the arguments that are being proposed?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.600
 And this is why these arguments are incorrect.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.040
 So this is, you know, that should be something

19:35.040 --> 19:37.480
 that scientists should always do,

19:37.480 --> 19:42.160
 even to the most sort of ideas that seem ridiculous.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.880
 So I like this is almost, it's almost my test

19:45.880 --> 19:48.440
 when I ask people what they think about Flat Earth theory

19:48.440 --> 19:51.080
 to see how quickly they roll their eyes.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.800
 Well, yeah, I mean, let me go on record.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.880
 Yeah.

19:53.880 --> 19:58.400
 And say that the earth is not flat.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.040
 It is a three dimensional spheroid.

20:02.040 --> 20:07.040
 However, I don't know that and it has not been proven.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.840
 Science doesn't prove anything.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.720
 It just reduces uncertainty.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.320
 Could the earth actually be flat?

20:13.960 --> 20:16.840
 Extremely unlikely.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.080
 Extremely unlikely.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.680
 And so it is a ridiculous notion

20:21.680 --> 20:26.680
 if we care about how probable and certain our ideas might be.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.400
 But I think it's incredibly important

20:28.400 --> 20:32.120
 to talk about science in that way

20:32.120 --> 20:37.120
 and to not resort to, well, it's true, it's true

20:37.320 --> 20:41.320
 in the same way that a mathematical theorem is true.

20:41.320 --> 20:46.320
 And I think we're kind of like being pretty pedantic

20:46.560 --> 20:48.440
 about defining this stuff.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.720
 But like, sure, I could take a rocket ship out

20:51.720 --> 20:53.720
 and I could orbit earth and look at it

20:53.720 --> 20:56.040
 and it would look like a ball, right?

20:56.040 --> 20:58.680
 But I still can't prove that I'm not living in a simulation

20:58.680 --> 20:59.840
 that I'm not a brain in a vat,

20:59.840 --> 21:02.280
 that this isn't all an elaborate ruse created

21:02.280 --> 21:05.840
 by some technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization.

21:05.840 --> 21:10.320
 So there's always some doubt and that's fine.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.600
 That's exciting.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.200
 And I think that kind of doubt, practically speaking,

21:14.200 --> 21:17.080
 is useful when you start talking about quantum mechanics

21:17.080 --> 21:21.240
 or string theory, sort of, it helps to me that kind of little,

21:21.240 --> 21:25.520
 adds a little spice into the thinking process of scientists

21:25.520 --> 21:26.480
 and scientists.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.080
 So, I mean, just as a thought experiment,

21:30.080 --> 21:33.440
 your video kind of, okay, say the earth is flat,

21:33.440 --> 21:36.400
 what would the forces when you walk about this flat

21:36.400 --> 21:38.440
 earth feel like to the human?

21:38.440 --> 21:40.640
 That's a really nice thought experiment to think about.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.440
 Right, because what's really nice about it

21:42.440 --> 21:45.440
 is that it's a funny thought experiment,

21:45.440 --> 21:48.080
 but you actually wind up accidentally learning

21:48.080 --> 21:53.080
 a whole lot about gravity and about relativity and geometry.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.120
 And I think that's really the goal of what I'm doing.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.680
 I'm not trying to convince people that the earth is round.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.120
 I feel like you either believe that it is or you don't

22:01.120 --> 22:04.520
 and like that's, you know, how can I change that?

22:04.520 --> 22:06.760
 What I can do is change how you think

22:06.760 --> 22:10.800
 and how you are introduced to important concepts.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.600
 Like, well, how does gravity operate?

22:13.600 --> 22:16.320
 Oh, it's all about the center of mass of an object.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.320
 So right, on a sphere, we're all pulled towards the middle,

22:19.320 --> 22:22.760
 essentially the centroid, geometrically, but on a disk.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.520
 Ooh, you're gonna be pulled at a weird angle

22:24.520 --> 22:25.920
 if you're out near the edge.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.400
 And that stuff's fascinating.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.840
 Yeah, and to me, that was that particular video

22:34.480 --> 22:37.480
 opened my eyes even more to what gravity is.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.960
 It's just a really nice visualization tool

22:39.960 --> 22:43.040
 because you always imagine gravity with spheres,

22:43.040 --> 22:44.560
 with masses that are spheres.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.080
 Yeah. And imagining gravity on masses

22:47.080 --> 22:49.720
 that are not spherical, some other shape,

22:49.720 --> 22:54.040
 but in here, a plate, a flat object is really interesting.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.280
 It makes you really kind of visualize

22:56.280 --> 22:57.720
 in a three dimensional way the force.

22:57.720 --> 23:02.720
 Yeah, even if a disk, the size of Earth would be impossible.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.000
 I think anything larger than like the moon basically

23:09.000 --> 23:13.720
 needs to be a sphere because gravity will round it out.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.120
 So you can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter, right?

23:18.120 --> 23:21.040
 There's a great book about a teacup in the universe

23:21.040 --> 23:22.920
 that I highly recommend.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.520
 I don't remember the author, I forget her name,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.200
 but it's a wonderful book, so look it up.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
 I think it's called Teacup in the Universe.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.680
 Just to link on this point briefly,

23:32.680 --> 23:37.120
 your videos are generally super, people love them, right?

23:37.120 --> 23:39.600
 If you look at the sort of number of likes versus dislikes,

23:39.600 --> 23:43.160
 this measure of YouTube, right, is incredible,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.240
 and as do I.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.160
 But this particular Flat Earth video

23:48.160 --> 23:51.360
 has more dislikes than usual.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.360
 What do you, on that topic in general,

23:55.360 --> 23:58.800
 what's your sense, how big is the community,

23:58.800 --> 24:00.760
 not just who believes in Flat Earth,

24:00.760 --> 24:03.720
 but sort of the anti scientific community

24:03.720 --> 24:08.200
 that naturally distrusts scientists in a way

24:08.200 --> 24:12.200
 that's not an open minded way,

24:12.200 --> 24:13.720
 like really just distrust scientists,

24:13.720 --> 24:17.080
 like they're bought by some kind of mechanism

24:17.080 --> 24:18.880
 of some kind of bigger system

24:18.880 --> 24:21.080
 that's trying to manipulate human beings.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.040
 What's your sense of the size of that community?

24:24.040 --> 24:28.960
 You're one of the sort of great educators in the world

24:28.960 --> 24:33.960
 that educates people on the exciting power of science,

24:34.000 --> 24:38.080
 so you're kind of up against this community.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.960
 What's your sense of it?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.960
 I really have no idea.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.200
 I haven't looked at the likes and dislikes

24:44.200 --> 24:47.280
 on the Flat Earth video, and so I would wonder

24:47.280 --> 24:51.360
 if it has a greater percentage of dislikes than usual,

24:51.360 --> 24:53.520
 is that because of people disliking it

24:53.520 --> 24:58.520
 because they think that it's a video about Earth being flat

25:00.040 --> 25:02.000
 and they find that ridiculous and they dislike it

25:02.000 --> 25:04.240
 without even really watching much?

25:04.240 --> 25:08.560
 Do they wish that I was more dismissive of Flat Earth theories?

25:08.560 --> 25:10.200
 Yeah, that's possible too.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.080
 I know there are a lot of response videos

25:12.080 --> 25:15.840
 that kind of go through the episode

25:15.840 --> 25:18.600
 and are pro Flat Earth,

25:18.600 --> 25:21.840
 but I don't know if there's a larger community

25:21.840 --> 25:25.120
 of unorthodox thinkers today

25:25.120 --> 25:27.440
 than there have been in the past,

25:27.440 --> 25:29.960
 and I just wanna not lose them.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.600
 I want them to keep listening and thinking,

25:32.600 --> 25:36.640
 and by calling them all idiots or something,

25:36.640 --> 25:37.560
 that is no good,

25:37.560 --> 25:41.040
 because how idiotic are they really?

25:41.040 --> 25:45.320
 I mean, the Earth isn't a sphere at all.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.760
 We know that it's an oblate spheroid,

25:47.760 --> 25:50.400
 and that in and of itself is really interesting,

25:50.400 --> 25:52.280
 and I investigated that in which way is down,

25:52.280 --> 25:54.240
 where I'm like, really, down does not point

25:54.240 --> 25:56.280
 towards the center of the Earth.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.920
 It points in different direction,

25:58.920 --> 26:00.800
 depending on what's underneath you

26:00.800 --> 26:02.480
 and what's above you and what's around you.

26:02.480 --> 26:06.040
 The whole universe is tugging on me.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.400
 And then you also show that gravity

26:08.400 --> 26:11.720
 is non uniform across the globe.

26:11.720 --> 26:14.440
 Like if you, there's this, I guess, thought experiment,

26:14.440 --> 26:19.440
 if you build a bridge all the way across the Earth,

26:19.800 --> 26:22.600
 and then just knock out its pillars,

26:22.600 --> 26:23.680
 what would happen?

26:23.680 --> 26:27.080
 And you describe how it would be like a very chaotic,

26:27.080 --> 26:29.000
 unstable thing that's happening

26:29.000 --> 26:31.800
 because gravity is non uniform throughout the Earth.

26:31.800 --> 26:36.640
 But yeah, in small spaces like the ones we work in,

26:36.640 --> 26:39.360
 we can essentially assume that gravity is uniform,

26:39.360 --> 26:40.920
 but it's not.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.080
 It is weaker the further you are from the Earth,

26:43.080 --> 26:47.600
 and it also is going to be,

26:47.600 --> 26:50.080
 it's radially pointed towards the middle of the Earth.

26:50.080 --> 26:54.160
 So a really large object will feel tidal forces

26:54.160 --> 26:55.680
 because of that non uniformness.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.520
 And we can take advantage of that with satellites, right?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.320
 Gravitational induced torque,

27:00.320 --> 27:01.720
 it's a great way to align your satellite

27:01.720 --> 27:05.600
 without having to use fuel or any kind of engine.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.360
 So let's jump back to it, artificial intelligence.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.200
 What's your thought of the state of where we are at

27:11.200 --> 27:12.960
 currently with artificial intelligence,

27:12.960 --> 27:15.200
 and what do you think it takes to build

27:15.200 --> 27:18.000
 human level or super human level intelligence?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.440
 I don't know what intelligence means.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.880
 That's my biggest question at the moment.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.080
 And I think it's because my instinct is always to go,

27:25.080 --> 27:28.040
 well, what are the foundations here of our discussion?

27:28.040 --> 27:31.080
 What does it mean to be intelligent?

27:31.080 --> 27:32.920
 How do we measure the intelligence

27:32.920 --> 27:37.520
 of an artificial machine or a program or something?

27:37.520 --> 27:39.920
 Can we say that humans are intelligent?

27:39.920 --> 27:42.640
 Because there's also a fascinating field

27:42.640 --> 27:44.280
 of how do you measure human intelligence?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.400
 Of course.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.120
 But if we just take that for granted,

27:47.120 --> 27:50.040
 saying that whatever this fuzzy intelligence thing

27:50.040 --> 27:52.200
 we're talking about, humans kind of have it.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.720
 What would be a good test for you?

27:56.720 --> 27:59.160
 So touring, develop a test that's natural language

27:59.160 --> 28:01.600
 conversation, would that impress you?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.360
 A chatbot that you'd want to hang out

28:03.360 --> 28:06.600
 and have a beer with for a bunch of hours

28:06.600 --> 28:08.360
 or have dinner plans with?

28:08.360 --> 28:10.320
 Is that a good test, natural language conversations?

28:10.320 --> 28:12.240
 Is there something else that would impress you?

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
 Or is that also too difficult to think about?

28:14.240 --> 28:15.840
 Yeah, I'm pretty much impressed by everything.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.760
 But I think that if...

28:17.760 --> 28:18.720
 Roomba?

28:18.720 --> 28:23.120
 If there was a chatbot that was like incredibly,

28:23.120 --> 28:24.480
 I don't know, really had a personality.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.960
 And if I didn't be the touring test, right?

28:27.960 --> 28:32.960
 Like if I'm unable to tell that it's not another person,

28:33.360 --> 28:36.560
 but then I was shown a bunch of wires

28:36.560 --> 28:39.080
 and mechanical components.

28:39.080 --> 28:42.680
 And it was like, that's actually what you're talking to.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.440
 I don't know if I would feel that guilty destroying it.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.240
 I would feel guilty because clearly it's well made

28:49.240 --> 28:51.040
 and it's a really cool thing.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.800
 It's like destroying a really cool car or something.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.280
 But I would not feel like I was a murderer.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.760
 So yeah, at what point would I start to feel that way?

28:58.760 --> 29:02.680
 And this is such a subjective psychological question.

29:02.680 --> 29:07.680
 If you give it movement or if you have it act as though,

29:08.600 --> 29:11.840
 or perhaps really feel pain as I destroy it

29:11.840 --> 29:15.640
 and scream and resist, then I'd feel bad.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.680
 Yeah, it's beautifully put.

29:16.680 --> 29:20.480
 And let's just say act like it's in pain.

29:20.480 --> 29:25.480
 So if you just have a robot that not screams

29:25.600 --> 29:28.400
 just like moans in pain, if you kick it,

29:28.400 --> 29:32.800
 that immediately just puts in a class that we humans,

29:32.800 --> 29:35.280
 it becomes, we anthropomorphize it,

29:35.280 --> 29:37.960
 it almost immediately becomes human.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.320
 So that's a psychology question

29:39.320 --> 29:40.920
 as opposed to sort of a physics question.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.080
 Right, I think that's a really good instinct to have.

29:43.080 --> 29:48.080
 If the robot screams and moans,

29:48.080 --> 29:52.680
 even if you don't believe that it has the mental experience,

29:52.680 --> 29:55.320
 the qualia of pain and suffering,

29:55.320 --> 29:56.800
 I think it's still a good instinct to say,

29:56.800 --> 30:00.000
 you know what, I'd rather not hurt it.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.600
 The problem is that instinct can get us in trouble

30:02.600 --> 30:05.560
 because then robots can manipulate that.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.280
 And there's different kinds of robots.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.680
 There's robots like the Facebook and the YouTube algorithm

30:10.680 --> 30:11.920
 that recommends the video

30:11.920 --> 30:14.440
 and they can manipulate in the same kind of way.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.240
 Well, let me ask you just to stick

30:16.240 --> 30:17.840
 on artificial intelligence for a second.

30:17.840 --> 30:21.760
 Do you have worries about existential threats from AI

30:21.760 --> 30:23.720
 or existential threats from other technologies

30:23.720 --> 30:27.400
 like nuclear weapons that could potentially destroy

30:27.400 --> 30:31.240
 life on earth or damage it to a very significant degree?

30:31.240 --> 30:35.320
 Yeah, of course I do, especially the weapons that we create.

30:35.320 --> 30:38.120
 There's all kinds of famous ways to think about this.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.480
 And one is that, wow, what if we don't see

30:41.480 --> 30:43.960
 advanced alien civilizations

30:43.960 --> 30:48.960
 because of the danger of technology?

30:50.640 --> 30:51.840
 What if we reach a point,

30:51.840 --> 30:55.040
 and I think there's a channel Thoughty2?

30:55.040 --> 30:57.440
 Geez, I wish I remembered the name of the channel.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.000
 But he delves into this kind of limit

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
 of maybe once you discover radioactivity and its power,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.200
 you've reached this important hurdle.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.400
 And the reason that the skies are so empty

31:09.400 --> 31:13.880
 is that no one's ever managed to survive as a civilization

31:13.880 --> 31:16.840
 once they have that destructive power.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.840
 And when it comes to AI, I'm not really very worried

31:22.320 --> 31:24.800
 because I think that there are plenty of other people

31:24.800 --> 31:26.440
 that are already worried enough.

31:26.440 --> 31:30.520
 And oftentimes these worries are just,

31:30.520 --> 31:32.880
 they just get in the way of progress.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.680
 And there are questions that we should address later.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.960
 And I think I talk about this in my interview

31:41.960 --> 31:46.960
 with the self driving autonomous vehicle guy,

31:47.440 --> 31:48.640
 as I think it was a bonus scene

31:48.640 --> 31:52.080
 from the trolley problem episode.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.240
 And I'm like, wow, what should a car do

31:54.240 --> 31:57.000
 if this really weird contrived scenario happens

31:57.000 --> 32:00.160
 where it has to swerve and save the driver but kill a kid?

32:00.160 --> 32:03.480
 And he's like, well, what would a human do?

32:03.480 --> 32:07.240
 And if we resist technological progress

32:07.240 --> 32:10.400
 because we're worried about all of these little issues,

32:10.400 --> 32:12.000
 then it gets in the way.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.360
 And we shouldn't avoid those problems,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.800
 but we shouldn't allow them to be stumbling blocks

32:16.800 --> 32:18.960
 to advancement.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.480
 So the folks like Sam Harris or Elon Musk

32:22.480 --> 32:24.560
 are saying that we're not worried enough.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.560
 So worry should not paralyze technological progress,

32:28.560 --> 32:30.800
 but we're sort of marching,

32:30.800 --> 32:35.800
 technology is marching forward without the key scientists,

32:35.840 --> 32:37.880
 the developing the technology,

32:37.880 --> 32:42.080
 worrying about the overnight having some effects

32:42.080 --> 32:45.200
 that would be very detrimental to society.

32:45.200 --> 32:49.520
 So to push back on your thought of the idea

32:49.520 --> 32:51.240
 that there's enough people worrying about it,

32:51.240 --> 32:54.320
 Elon Musk says there's not enough people worrying about it.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.560
 So that's the kind of balance is,

32:58.520 --> 33:01.240
 you know, it's like a folks who really focused

33:01.240 --> 33:03.680
 on the nuclear deterrence are saying

33:03.680 --> 33:04.840
 there's not enough people worried

33:04.840 --> 33:06.080
 about nuclear deterrence, right?

33:06.080 --> 33:08.480
 So it's an interesting question of

33:08.480 --> 33:12.600
 what is a good threshold of people to worry about these?

33:12.600 --> 33:15.160
 And if it's too many people that are worried, you're right,

33:15.160 --> 33:18.760
 it'll be like the press would overreport on it

33:18.760 --> 33:21.840
 and it'll be technological halt technology progress.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.440
 If not enough, then we can march straight ahead

33:24.440 --> 33:29.440
 into that abyss that human beings might be destined for

33:29.840 --> 33:31.320
 with the progress of technology.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.680
 Yeah, I don't know what the right balance is

33:33.680 --> 33:35.720
 of how many people should be worried

33:35.720 --> 33:36.960
 and how worried should they be,

33:36.960 --> 33:40.440
 but we're always worried about new technology, you know?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.960
 We know that Plato was worried about the written word.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.000
 He's like, we shouldn't teach people to write

33:45.000 --> 33:48.080
 because then they won't use their minds to remember things.

33:48.080 --> 33:51.240
 There have been concerns over technology

33:51.240 --> 33:55.120
 and its advancement since the beginning of recorded history.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.880
 And so, you know, I think, however,

33:58.880 --> 34:01.040
 these conversations are really important to have

34:01.040 --> 34:03.360
 because again, we learn a lot about ourselves.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.160
 If we're really scared of some kind of AI,

34:06.160 --> 34:09.360
 like coming into being that is conscious or whatever

34:09.360 --> 34:13.120
 and can self replicate, we already do that every day.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.560
 It's called humans being born.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.200
 They're not artificial, they're humans,

34:17.200 --> 34:18.080
 but they're intelligent.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.160
 And I don't wanna live in a world

34:20.160 --> 34:21.960
 where we're worried about babies being born

34:21.960 --> 34:24.200
 because what if they become evil?

34:24.200 --> 34:25.040
 Right.

34:25.040 --> 34:25.880
 What if they become mean people?

34:25.880 --> 34:27.680
 What if they, what if they're thieves?

34:27.680 --> 34:31.760
 Maybe we should just like what, not have babies born?

34:31.760 --> 34:33.960
 Like maybe we shouldn't create AI.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.960
 It's like, you know, we will want to have safeguards in place

34:39.680 --> 34:41.280
 in the same way that we know,

34:41.280 --> 34:43.160
 like a kid could be born that becomes

34:43.160 --> 34:47.920
 some kind of evil person, but we have loss, right?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.960
 And it's possible that with advanced genetics

34:50.960 --> 34:53.920
 in general, be able to, you know,

34:53.920 --> 34:58.480
 it's a scary thought to say that, you know,

34:58.480 --> 35:02.880
 this my child if born would be,

35:02.880 --> 35:07.880
 would have an 83% chance of being a psychopath, right?

35:08.720 --> 35:11.480
 Like being able to, if it's something genetic,

35:11.480 --> 35:15.040
 if there's some sort of, and what to use that information,

35:15.040 --> 35:20.040
 what to do with that information is a difficult ethical thought.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.040
 Yeah, I'd like to find an answer that isn't,

35:22.040 --> 35:24.960
 well, let's not have them live.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.840
 You know, I'd like to find an answer that is,

35:26.840 --> 35:30.320
 well, all human life is worthy.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.640
 And if you have an 83% chance of becoming a psychopath,

35:33.640 --> 35:38.080
 well, you still deserve dignity.

35:38.080 --> 35:42.000
 And you still deserve to be treated well.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.360
 And you still have rights.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.960
 At least at this part of the world, at least in America,

35:45.960 --> 35:49.520
 there's a respect for individual life in that way.

35:49.520 --> 35:54.040
 That's, well, to me, but again, I'm in this bubble

35:54.040 --> 35:55.720
 is a beautiful thing.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.920
 But there's other cultures

35:57.920 --> 36:00.600
 where individual human life is not that important.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.760
 Where a society, so I was born in the Soviet Union,

36:04.760 --> 36:07.440
 where the strength of nation and society together

36:07.440 --> 36:10.280
 is more important than any one particular individual.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.080
 So it's an interesting also notion,

36:12.080 --> 36:13.520
 the stories we tell ourselves.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.000
 I like the one where individuals matter,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.200
 but it's unclear that that was what the future holds.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.480
 Well, yeah, and I mean, let me even throw this out.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.840
 Like what is artificial intelligence?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.200
 How can it be artificial?

36:25.200 --> 36:28.000
 I really think that we get pretty obsessed

36:28.000 --> 36:30.720
 and stuck on the idea that there is something

36:30.720 --> 36:34.320
 that is a wild human, a pure human organism

36:34.320 --> 36:35.760
 without technology.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.360
 But I don't think that's a real thing.

36:38.360 --> 36:43.360
 I think that humans and human technology are one organism.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.240
 Look at my glasses, okay?

36:45.240 --> 36:48.640
 If an alien came down and saw me,

36:48.640 --> 36:51.320
 would they necessarily know that this is an invention,

36:51.320 --> 36:53.960
 that I don't grow these organically from my body?

36:53.960 --> 36:56.280
 They wouldn't know that right away.

36:56.280 --> 37:01.040
 And the written word and spoons and cups,

37:01.040 --> 37:03.160
 these are all pieces of technology.

37:04.280 --> 37:08.560
 We are not alone as an organism.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.880
 And so the technology we create,

37:10.880 --> 37:13.840
 whether it be video games or artificial intelligence

37:13.840 --> 37:15.880
 that can self replicate and hate us,

37:15.880 --> 37:18.720
 it's actually all the same organism.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.080
 When you're in a car, where do you end in the car begin?

37:21.080 --> 37:22.920
 It seems like a really easy question to answer,

37:22.920 --> 37:24.520
 but the more you think about it,

37:24.520 --> 37:25.760
 the more you realize, wow,

37:25.760 --> 37:29.840
 we are in this symbiotic relationship with our inventions.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.920
 And there are plenty of people who are worried about it

37:31.920 --> 37:35.720
 and there should be, but it's inevitable.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.800
 And I think that even just us think of ourselves

37:38.800 --> 37:43.800
 as individual intelligences may be silly notion

37:44.400 --> 37:47.920
 because it's much better to think of

37:47.920 --> 37:49.840
 the entirety of human civilization.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.200
 All living organisms on earth is a single living organism.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.040
 Right.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.120
 As a single intelligent creature,

37:55.120 --> 37:57.320
 because you're right, everything's intertwined.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.040
 Everything is deeply connected.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.440
 So we mentioned Elon Musk.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.120
 So you're a curious lover of science.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.840
 What do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing

38:09.840 --> 38:13.160
 with space exploration, with electric vehicles,

38:13.160 --> 38:16.560
 with autopilot sort of getting into the space

38:16.560 --> 38:20.320
 of autonomous vehicles, with boring under LA,

38:20.320 --> 38:24.000
 and Neuralink trying to communicate

38:24.000 --> 38:25.040
 brain machine interfaces,

38:25.040 --> 38:28.720
 communicate between machines and human brains?

38:29.720 --> 38:30.960
 Well, it's really inspiring.

38:30.960 --> 38:35.840
 I mean, look at the fandom that he's amassed.

38:35.840 --> 38:40.080
 It's not common for someone like that

38:40.080 --> 38:41.480
 to have such a following.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.320
 And so it's...

38:42.320 --> 38:43.280
 Engineering nerd.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.560
 Yeah, so it's really exciting,

38:45.560 --> 38:47.400
 but I also think that a lot of responsibility

38:47.400 --> 38:48.560
 comes with that kind of power.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.200
 So like if I met him,

38:50.200 --> 38:51.800
 I would love to hear how he feels

38:51.800 --> 38:53.880
 about the responsibility he has.

38:55.080 --> 39:00.080
 When there are people who are such a fan of your ideas

39:00.080 --> 39:04.680
 and your dreams and share them so closely with you,

39:04.680 --> 39:06.440
 you have a lot of power.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.720
 And he didn't always have that, you know?

39:09.720 --> 39:12.040
 He wasn't born as Elon Musk.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.000
 Well, he was, but well, he was named that later.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
 But the point is that I wanna know the psychology

39:20.200 --> 39:23.880
 of becoming a figure like him.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.680
 Well, I don't even know how to phrase the question right,

39:25.680 --> 39:28.040
 but it's a question about what do you do

39:28.040 --> 39:30.840
 when you're following,

39:30.840 --> 39:35.840
 your fans become so large that it's almost bigger than you?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.040
 And how do you responsibly manage that?

39:41.040 --> 39:43.520
 And maybe it doesn't worry him at all, and that's fine too.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.520
 But I'd be really curious.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.720
 And I think there are a lot of people that go through this

39:47.720 --> 39:50.440
 when they realize, whoa, there are a lot of eyes on me.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.920
 There are a lot of people who really take what I say

39:53.920 --> 39:57.720
 very earnestly and take it to heart and will defend me.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.720
 And that can be dangerous

40:04.320 --> 40:07.560
 and you have to be responsible with it.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.280
 Both in terms of impact on society

40:09.280 --> 40:11.320
 and psychologically for the individual,

40:11.320 --> 40:15.080
 just the burden psychologically on neon.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.880
 Yeah, yeah, how does he think about that

40:18.880 --> 40:21.240
 part of his persona?

40:21.240 --> 40:23.400
 Well, let me throw that right back at you

40:23.400 --> 40:27.600
 because in some ways you're just a funny guy

40:28.640 --> 40:31.760
 that's gotten a humongous following,

40:31.760 --> 40:33.600
 a funny guy with a curiosity.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.640
 You've got a huge following.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.320
 How do you psychologically deal with the responsibility?

40:40.320 --> 40:42.040
 In many ways you have a reach

40:42.040 --> 40:44.600
 in many ways bigger than Elon Musk.

40:44.600 --> 40:49.360
 What is the burden that you feel in educating

40:49.360 --> 40:52.000
 being one of the biggest educators in the world

40:52.000 --> 40:53.520
 where everybody's listening to you

40:53.520 --> 40:58.440
 and actually everybody, like the most of the world

40:58.440 --> 41:01.120
 that uses YouTube for education material

41:01.120 --> 41:04.800
 trusts you as a source of good, strong,

41:04.800 --> 41:06.040
 scientific thinking.

41:06.040 --> 41:11.040
 It's a burden and I try to approach it

41:11.040 --> 41:16.040
 with a lot of humility and sharing.

41:16.080 --> 41:20.320
 I'm not out there doing a lot of scientific experiments.

41:20.320 --> 41:23.200
 I am sharing the work of real scientists

41:23.200 --> 41:24.920
 and I'm celebrating their work

41:24.920 --> 41:29.480
 and the way that they think and the power of curiosity.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.160
 But I want to make it clear at all times that like,

41:32.160 --> 41:35.240
 look, we don't know all the answers

41:35.240 --> 41:37.640
 and I don't think we're ever going to reach a point

41:37.640 --> 41:39.480
 where we're like, wow, and there you go.

41:39.480 --> 41:40.600
 That's the universe.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.520
 It's this equation.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.840
 You plug in some conditions or whatever

41:43.840 --> 41:44.680
 and you do the math

41:44.680 --> 41:46.120
 and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.920
 I don't think we're ever gonna reach that point

41:47.920 --> 41:51.920
 but I think that there is a tendency

41:51.920 --> 41:56.120
 to sometimes believe in science and become elitist

41:56.120 --> 41:58.040
 and become, I don't know, hard

41:58.040 --> 41:59.920
 when in reality it should humble you

41:59.920 --> 42:01.800
 and make you feel smaller.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.080
 I think there's something very beautiful

42:03.080 --> 42:07.400
 about feeling very, very small and very weak

42:07.400 --> 42:10.920
 and to feel that you need other people.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.200
 So I try to keep that in mind and say,

42:13.200 --> 42:14.360
 look, thanks for watching.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.680
 Vsauce is not, I'm not Vsauce, you are.

42:16.680 --> 42:20.480
 When I start the episodes, I say, hey, Vsauce, Michael here.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.280
 Vsauce and Michael are actually a different thing

42:22.280 --> 42:23.120
 in my mind.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.400
 I don't know if that's always clear

42:24.400 --> 42:26.880
 but yeah, I have to approach it that way

42:26.880 --> 42:29.040
 because it's not about me.

42:29.040 --> 42:32.960
 Yeah, so it's not even, you're not feeling the responsibility.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.360
 You're just sort of plugging into this big thing

42:35.360 --> 42:39.200
 that is scientific exploration of our reality

42:39.200 --> 42:41.880
 and you're a voice that represents a bunch

42:41.880 --> 42:46.840
 but you're just plugging into this big Vsauce ball

42:46.840 --> 42:49.200
 that others, millions of others are plugged into.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.240
 Yeah, and I'm just hoping to encourage curiosity

42:52.240 --> 42:56.440
 and responsible thinking and

42:56.440 --> 43:01.440
 and an embracement of doubt

43:02.000 --> 43:05.040
 and being okay with that.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.240
 So next week, talking to Christos Goudreau,

43:08.240 --> 43:10.040
 I'm not sure if you're familiar who he is

43:10.040 --> 43:11.880
 but he's the VP of engineering head

43:11.880 --> 43:14.680
 of the quote unquote YouTube algorithm

43:14.680 --> 43:16.200
 or the search and discovery.

43:16.200 --> 43:20.240
 So let me ask, first high level,

43:20.240 --> 43:25.160
 do you have a question for him

43:25.160 --> 43:28.880
 that if you can get an honest answer that you would ask?

43:28.880 --> 43:30.200
 But more generally,

43:30.200 --> 43:32.680
 how do you think about the YouTube algorithm

43:32.680 --> 43:36.120
 that drives some of the motivation behind,

43:36.120 --> 43:38.960
 no, some of the design decisions you make

43:38.960 --> 43:42.280
 as you ask and answer some of the questions you do,

43:42.280 --> 43:45.200
 how would you improve this algorithm in your mind in general?

43:45.200 --> 43:47.600
 So just what would you ask him?

43:47.600 --> 43:49.560
 And outside of that,

43:49.560 --> 43:52.720
 how would you like to see the algorithm improve?

43:52.720 --> 43:56.840
 Well, I think of the algorithm as a mirror.

43:56.840 --> 43:59.000
 It reflects what people put in

43:59.000 --> 44:01.200
 and we don't always like what we see in that mirror.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.800
 From the individual mirror

44:02.800 --> 44:05.480
 to the individual mirror to the society.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.080
 Both in the aggregate,

44:07.080 --> 44:11.440
 it's reflecting back what people on average want to watch.

44:11.440 --> 44:15.400
 And when you see things being recommended to you,

44:15.400 --> 44:19.280
 it's reflecting back what it thinks you want to see.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.360
 And specifically, I would guess that it's

44:22.360 --> 44:23.600
 not just what you want to see,

44:23.600 --> 44:25.600
 but what you will click on

44:25.600 --> 44:27.960
 and what you will watch some of

44:27.960 --> 44:32.520
 and stay on YouTube because of.

44:32.520 --> 44:33.840
 I don't think that,

44:33.840 --> 44:34.880
 this is all me guessing,

44:34.880 --> 44:39.000
 but I don't think that YouTube cares

44:39.000 --> 44:41.720
 if you only watch like a second of a video.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.120
 As long as the next thing you do is open another video.

44:45.120 --> 44:49.400
 If you close the app or close the site,

44:49.400 --> 44:50.800
 that's a problem for them

44:50.800 --> 44:52.960
 because they're not a subscription platform.

44:52.960 --> 44:53.800
 They're not like, look,

44:53.800 --> 44:56.160
 you're giving us 20 bucks a month no matter what.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.680
 So who cares?

44:57.680 --> 45:02.160
 They need you to watch and spend time there and see ads.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.680
 So one of the things I'm curious about

45:03.680 --> 45:08.680
 whether they do consider longer term sort of develop,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.680
 your longer term development as a human being,

45:12.680 --> 45:15.200
 which I think ultimately will make you feel better

45:15.200 --> 45:17.520
 about using YouTube in the longterm

45:17.520 --> 45:20.000
 and allowing you to stick with it for longer.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.440
 Because even if you feed the dopamine rush

45:22.440 --> 45:26.040
 in the short term and you keep clicking on cat videos,

45:26.040 --> 45:29.040
 the eventually you sort of wake up like from a drug

45:29.040 --> 45:30.880
 and say, I need to quit this.

45:30.880 --> 45:32.720
 So I wonder how much you're trying to optimize

45:32.720 --> 45:35.840
 for the longterm because when I look at the,

45:35.840 --> 45:39.440
 your videos aren't exactly sort of no offense,

45:39.440 --> 45:41.760
 but they're not the most clickable.

45:41.760 --> 45:44.200
 They're both the most clickable

45:44.200 --> 45:47.320
 and I feel I watched the entire thing

45:47.320 --> 45:49.680
 and I feel a better human after I watched it, right?

45:49.680 --> 45:54.680
 So like they're not just optimizing for the clickability

45:54.720 --> 45:59.720
 because this is, so my thought is, how do you think of it?

45:59.920 --> 46:02.280
 And does it affect your own content?

46:02.280 --> 46:04.720
 Like how deep you go, how profound you explore

46:04.720 --> 46:07.040
 the directions and so on.

46:07.040 --> 46:11.560
 I've been really lucky in that I don't worry too much

46:11.560 --> 46:12.560
 about the algorithm.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.840
 I mean, look at my thumbnails.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.240
 I don't really go too wild with them.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.360
 And with Mindfield, where I'm in partnership

46:19.360 --> 46:20.880
 with YouTube on the thumbnails,

46:20.880 --> 46:22.440
 I'm often like, let's pull this back.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.000
 Let's be mysterious.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.680
 But usually I'm just trying to do

46:25.680 --> 46:27.560
 what everyone else is not doing.

46:27.560 --> 46:29.880
 So if everyone's doing crazy Photoshop,

46:29.880 --> 46:31.360
 the kind of thumbnails, I'm like,

46:31.360 --> 46:34.160
 what if the thumbnails just align?

46:34.160 --> 46:37.800
 And what if the title is just a word?

46:37.800 --> 46:41.200
 And I kind of feel like all of the Vsauce channels

46:41.200 --> 46:43.240
 have cultivated an audience that expects that.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.400
 And so they would rather Jake make a video

46:45.400 --> 46:47.080
 that's just called Stains,

46:47.080 --> 46:51.000
 than one called I Explored Stains, Shocking.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.360
 But there are other audiences out there that want that.

46:53.360 --> 46:57.120
 And I think most people kind of want

46:57.120 --> 46:58.840
 what you see the algorithm favoring,

46:58.840 --> 47:02.320
 which is mainstream traditional celebrity

47:02.320 --> 47:03.680
 and news kind of information.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.240
 I mean, that's what makes YouTube really different

47:05.240 --> 47:06.720
 than other streaming platforms.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.840
 No one's like, what's going on in the world?

47:08.840 --> 47:10.560
 I'll open up Netflix to find out.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.760
 But you do open up Twitter to find that out.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.880
 You open up Facebook, you can open up YouTube

47:14.880 --> 47:16.280
 because you'll see that the trending videos

47:16.280 --> 47:19.600
 are like what happened amongst the traditional

47:19.600 --> 47:22.120
 mainstream people in different industries.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.040
 And that's what's being shown.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.560
 And it's not necessarily YouTube saying,

47:27.560 --> 47:29.240
 we want that to be what you see.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.400
 It's that that's what people click on.

47:31.400 --> 47:33.320
 When they see Ariana Grande, you know,

47:33.320 --> 47:36.280
 reads a love letter from like her high school sweetheart,

47:36.280 --> 47:38.000
 they're like, I want to see that.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.320
 And when they see a video from me

47:39.320 --> 47:41.800
 that's got some lines in math and it's called Law and Causes,

47:41.800 --> 47:45.960
 they're like, well, I mean, I'm just on the bus.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.640
 Like I don't have time to dive into a whole lesson.

47:48.640 --> 47:52.360
 So, you know, before you get super mad at YouTube,

47:52.360 --> 47:53.640
 you should say, really,

47:53.640 --> 47:55.520
 they're just reflecting back human behavior.

47:55.520 --> 47:59.120
 Is there something you would improve about the algorithm?

48:00.240 --> 48:02.760
 Knowing, of course, that as far as we're concerned,

48:02.760 --> 48:04.560
 it's a black box or we don't know how it works.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.800
 Right. And I don't think that even anyone at YouTube

48:06.800 --> 48:07.920
 really knows what it's doing.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.800
 They know what they've tweaked, but then it learns.

48:09.800 --> 48:13.800
 I think that it learns and it decides how to behave.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.640
 And sometimes the YouTube employees are left going,

48:16.640 --> 48:19.600
 I don't know, maybe we should like change the value

48:19.600 --> 48:22.640
 of how much it worries about watch time.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.800
 And maybe it should worry more about something else.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.640
 I don't know.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.400
 But I mean, I would like to see,

48:28.400 --> 48:30.680
 I don't know what they're doing and not doing.

48:30.680 --> 48:32.720
 Well, is there a conversation

48:32.720 --> 48:35.720
 that you think they should be having just internally,

48:35.720 --> 48:37.320
 whether they're having it or not?

48:37.320 --> 48:38.920
 Is there something,

48:38.920 --> 48:41.120
 should they be thinking about the longterm future?

48:41.120 --> 48:44.400
 Should they be thinking about educational content

48:44.400 --> 48:48.120
 and whether that's educating about what just happened

48:48.120 --> 48:50.640
 in the world today, news or educational content?

48:50.640 --> 48:51.480
 Like what you're providing,

48:51.480 --> 48:54.320
 which is asking big sort of timeless questions

48:54.320 --> 48:56.520
 about how the way the world works.

48:56.520 --> 48:59.400
 Well, it's interesting, what should they think about?

48:59.400 --> 49:02.560
 Because it's called YouTube, not our tube.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.640
 And that's why I think they have

49:04.640 --> 49:07.520
 so many phenomenal educational creators.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.360
 Yes.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.720
 You don't have shows like Three Blue One Brown

49:11.720 --> 49:14.200
 or Physics Girl or Looking Glass Universe

49:14.200 --> 49:18.720
 or Up an Atom or Brain Scoop or, I mean, I could go on and on.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.960
 They aren't on Amazon Prime and Netflix

49:20.960 --> 49:24.000
 and they don't have commissioned shows from those platforms.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.520
 It's all organically happening

49:25.520 --> 49:26.640
 because there are people out there

49:26.640 --> 49:30.120
 that want to share their passion for learning,

49:30.120 --> 49:32.520
 that wanna share their curiosity.

49:32.520 --> 49:37.440
 And YouTube could promote those kinds of shows more,

49:37.440 --> 49:39.080
 but like, first of all,

49:40.200 --> 49:43.240
 they probably wouldn't get as many clicks

49:43.240 --> 49:44.400
 and YouTube needs to make sure

49:44.400 --> 49:46.200
 that the average user is always clicking

49:46.200 --> 49:47.720
 and staying on the site.

49:47.720 --> 49:51.040
 They could still promote it more for the good of society,

49:51.040 --> 49:52.720
 but then we're making some really weird claims

49:52.720 --> 49:53.960
 about what's good for society

49:53.960 --> 49:55.600
 because I think that cat videos

49:55.600 --> 49:58.040
 are also an incredibly important part

49:58.040 --> 50:00.360
 of what it means to be a human.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.840
 I mentioned this quote before from Unumuno about,

50:02.840 --> 50:05.400
 look, I've seen a cat like estimate distances

50:05.400 --> 50:07.800
 and calculate a jump, you know, more often

50:07.800 --> 50:09.440
 than I've seen a cat cry.

50:09.440 --> 50:12.440
 And so things that play with our emotions

50:12.440 --> 50:15.360
 and make us feel things can be cheesy and can feel cheap,

50:15.360 --> 50:18.000
 but like, man, that's very human.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
 And so even the dumbest vlog is still so important

50:23.760 --> 50:27.360
 that I don't think I have a better claim to take it spot

50:27.360 --> 50:29.840
 than it has to have that spot, so.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.600
 It puts a mirror to us, the beautiful parts,

50:32.600 --> 50:36.000
 the ugly parts, the shallow parts, the deep parts.

50:36.000 --> 50:36.840
 You're right.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.840
 What I would like to see is, you know,

50:39.840 --> 50:43.400
 I miss the days when engaging with content on YouTube

50:43.400 --> 50:47.640
 helped push it into my subscribers timelines.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.600
 It used to be that when I liked a video,

50:49.600 --> 50:54.600
 say from Veritasium, it would show up in the feed

50:54.640 --> 50:56.920
 on the front page of the app or the website

50:56.920 --> 50:58.360
 of my subscribers.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.480
 And I knew that if I liked a video,

51:00.480 --> 51:03.520
 I could send it 100,000 views or more.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.960
 That no longer is true, but I think

51:05.960 --> 51:07.320
 that was a good user experience.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.840
 When I subscribe to someone, when I'm following them,

51:09.840 --> 51:13.120
 I want to see more of what they like.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.400
 I want them to also curate the feed for me.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.920
 And I think that Twitter and Facebook are doing that

51:17.920 --> 51:20.360
 in also some ways that are kind of annoying,

51:20.360 --> 51:22.360
 but I would like that to happen more.

51:22.360 --> 51:25.200
 And I think we would see communities being stronger

51:25.200 --> 51:27.320
 on YouTube if it was that way instead of YouTube going,

51:27.320 --> 51:29.800
 well, technically Michael liked this Veritasium video,

51:29.800 --> 51:33.600
 but people are way more likely to click on Carpool Karaoke.

51:33.600 --> 51:36.200
 So I don't even care who they are, just give them that.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.960
 Not saying anything against Carpool Karaoke,

51:38.960 --> 51:43.280
 that is a extremely important part of our society,

51:43.280 --> 51:46.800
 what it means to be a human on earth, you know, but...

51:46.800 --> 51:48.480
 I'll say it sucks, but...

51:48.480 --> 51:51.320
 Yeah, but a lot of people would disagree with you

51:51.320 --> 51:53.840
 and they should be able to see as much of that as they want.

51:53.840 --> 51:55.680
 And even people who don't think they like it

51:55.680 --> 51:57.080
 should still be really aware of it

51:57.080 --> 51:59.400
 because it's such an important thing.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.920
 And such an influential thing.

52:00.920 --> 52:03.320
 But yeah, I just wish that like new channels I discover

52:03.320 --> 52:04.360
 and that I subscribe to,

52:04.360 --> 52:06.960
 I wish that my subscribers found out about that

52:06.960 --> 52:10.040
 because especially in the education community,

52:10.040 --> 52:11.600
 a rising tide floats all boats.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.040
 If you watch a video from Numberphile,

52:14.040 --> 52:16.760
 you're just more likely to want to watch an episode from me,

52:16.760 --> 52:18.560
 whether it be on Vsauce One or Ding.

52:18.560 --> 52:21.880
 It's not competitive in the way that traditional TV was,

52:21.880 --> 52:23.240
 where it's like, well, if you tune into that show,

52:23.240 --> 52:24.560
 it means you're not watching mine

52:24.560 --> 52:26.160
 because they both air at the same time.

52:26.160 --> 52:29.360
 So helping each other out through collaborations

52:29.360 --> 52:31.720
 takes a lot of work, but just through engaging,

52:31.720 --> 52:34.000
 commenting on their videos, liking their videos,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.680
 subscribing to them, whatever,

52:36.680 --> 52:41.480
 that I would love to see become easier and more powerful.

52:41.480 --> 52:46.040
 So a quick and impossibly deep question,

52:46.040 --> 52:48.960
 last question, about mortality.

52:48.960 --> 52:52.600
 You've spoken about death as an interesting topic.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.960
 Do you think about your own mortality?

52:55.960 --> 52:59.760
 Yeah, every day, it's really scary.

52:59.760 --> 53:04.040
 So what do you think is the meaning of life

53:04.040 --> 53:07.360
 that mortality makes very explicit?

53:07.360 --> 53:12.360
 So why are you here on earth, Michael?

53:12.640 --> 53:14.560
 What's the point of this whole thing?

53:18.120 --> 53:23.120
 What does mortality, in the context of the whole universe,

53:23.120 --> 53:24.960
 in the context of the whole universe,

53:24.960 --> 53:26.400
 make you realize about yourself?

53:26.400 --> 53:28.040
 Just you, Michael Stevens.

53:29.120 --> 53:33.640
 Well, it makes me realize that I am destined

53:33.640 --> 53:35.600
 to become a notion.

53:35.600 --> 53:39.600
 I'm destined to become a memory, and we can extend life.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.880
 I think there's really exciting things being done

53:42.880 --> 53:47.080
 to extend life, but we still don't know how to protect you

53:47.080 --> 53:48.880
 from some accident that could happen,

53:48.880 --> 53:50.280
 some unforeseen thing.

53:50.280 --> 53:54.120
 Maybe we could save my connectome

53:54.120 --> 53:56.560
 and recreate my consciousness digitally,

53:56.560 --> 53:59.400
 but even that could be lost

54:00.320 --> 54:02.560
 if it's stored on a physical medium or something.

54:02.560 --> 54:07.760
 So basically, I just think that embracing

54:07.760 --> 54:09.000
 and realizing how cool it is,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.560
 that someday I will just be an idea,

54:11.560 --> 54:13.360
 and there won't be a Michael anymore

54:13.360 --> 54:16.160
 that can be like, no, that's not what I meant.

54:16.160 --> 54:19.600
 It'll just be what people, they have to guess what I meant.

54:19.600 --> 54:24.600
 And they'll remember me and how I live on as that memory

54:25.800 --> 54:29.600
 will maybe not even be who I wanted to be,

54:29.600 --> 54:31.960
 but there's something powerful about that,

54:31.960 --> 54:36.640
 and there's something powerful about letting future people

54:36.640 --> 54:38.960
 run the show themselves.

54:38.960 --> 54:41.960
 I think I'm glad to get out of their way at some point

54:41.960 --> 54:43.680
 and say, all right, it's your world now.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.720
 So you, the physical entity, Michael,

54:46.720 --> 54:50.320
 has have ripple effects in the space of ideas

54:50.320 --> 54:54.280
 that far outlives you in ways that you can't control,

54:54.280 --> 54:56.120
 but it's nevertheless fascinating to think,

54:56.120 --> 54:57.600
 I mean, especially with you,

54:57.600 --> 54:59.200
 you can imagine an alien species

54:59.200 --> 55:01.800
 when they finally arrive and destroy all of us,

55:01.800 --> 55:04.600
 would watch your videos to try to figure out

55:04.600 --> 55:06.160
 what were the questions that these people.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.440
 But even if they didn't,

55:07.440 --> 55:11.440
 you know, I still think that there will be ripples.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.480
 Like when I say memory,

55:13.480 --> 55:16.640
 I don't specifically mean people remember my name

55:16.640 --> 55:19.000
 and my birth date and like there's a photo of me

55:19.000 --> 55:20.920
 on Wikipedia, like all that can be lost,

55:20.920 --> 55:24.040
 but I still would hope that people ask questions

55:24.040 --> 55:26.520
 and teach concepts in some of the ways

55:26.520 --> 55:28.400
 that I have found useful and satisfying.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.840
 Even if they don't know that I was the one

55:29.840 --> 55:32.640
 who tried to popularize it, that's fine.

55:32.640 --> 55:35.320
 But if Earth was completely destroyed,

55:35.320 --> 55:39.440
 like burnt to a crisp, everything on it today,

55:39.440 --> 55:42.760
 what would the universe wouldn't care?

55:42.760 --> 55:47.760
 Like Jupiter is not gonna go, oh no, and that could happen.

55:49.720 --> 55:54.480
 So we do, however, have the power to, you know,

55:54.480 --> 55:57.960
 launch things into space to try to extend

55:57.960 --> 56:02.960
 how long our memory exists.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.680
 And what I mean by that is, you know,

56:04.680 --> 56:06.960
 we are recording things about the world

56:06.960 --> 56:08.480
 and we're learning things and writing stories

56:08.480 --> 56:13.480
 and all of this and preserving that is truly what I think

56:15.280 --> 56:16.640
 is the essence of being a human.

56:16.640 --> 56:20.640
 We are autobiographers of the universe

56:20.640 --> 56:21.720
 and we're really good at it.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.560
 We're better than fossils, we're better than light spectrum,

56:25.560 --> 56:26.800
 we're better than any of that.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.040
 We collect much more detailed memories

56:30.040 --> 56:32.880
 of what's happening, much better data.

56:32.880 --> 56:37.360
 And so that should be our legacy.

56:37.360 --> 56:40.200
 And I hope that that's kind of mine too,

56:40.200 --> 56:42.480
 in terms of people remembering something

56:42.480 --> 56:44.840
 or having some kind of effect.

56:44.840 --> 56:47.600
 But even if I don't, you can't not have an effect.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.200
 That's not me feeling like,

56:49.200 --> 56:50.880
 I hope that I have this powerful legacy.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.840
 It's like, no matter who you are, you will.

56:53.840 --> 56:57.760
 But you also have to embrace the fact

56:57.760 --> 57:01.400
 that that impact might look really small and that's okay.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.520
 One of my favorite quotes is from Tessa the Derbervils.

57:04.520 --> 57:08.240
 And it's along the lines of the measure of your life

57:08.240 --> 57:10.960
 depends on not your external displacement,

57:10.960 --> 57:13.120
 but your subjective experience.

57:13.120 --> 57:15.800
 If I am happy and those that I love are happy,

57:16.760 --> 57:17.760
 can that be enough?

57:17.760 --> 57:20.120
 Because if so, excellent.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.480
 I think there's no better place to end it, Michael.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.080
 Thank you so much, it was an honor to meet you.

57:25.080 --> 57:25.920

 And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom

57:58.640 --> 58:00.840
 from Albert Einstein.

58:00.840 --> 58:04.040
 The important thing is not to stop questioning.

58:04.040 --> 58:06.960
 Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

58:06.960 --> 58:09.280
 One cannot help but be in awe

58:09.280 --> 58:11.760
 when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity,

58:11.760 --> 58:15.000
 of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.120
 It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend

58:18.120 --> 58:20.180
 a little of this mystery every day.

58:20.180 --> 58:32.180
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
