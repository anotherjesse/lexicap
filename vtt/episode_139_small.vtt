00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at Stanford,

00:05.200 --> 00:09.600
 working to understand how the brain works, how it can change their experience,

00:09.600 --> 00:13.840
 and how to repair brain circuits damaged by injury or disease.

00:14.560 --> 00:21.120
 He has a great Instagram account at Huberman Lab, where he teaches the world about the brain

00:21.120 --> 00:28.000
 and the human mind. Also, he's a friend and an inspiration in that he shows that you can be

00:28.000 --> 00:34.160
 humble, giving, and still succeed in the science world. Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:34.160 --> 00:40.480
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode. AID Sleep, a mattress that cools itself and gives

00:40.480 --> 00:46.720
 me yet another reason to enjoy sleep. SEM Rush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've

00:46.720 --> 00:52.800
 ever come across, and Cache App, the app I use to send money to friends. Please check out these

00:58.560 --> 01:03.600
 let me say that I heard from a lot of people about the previous conversation I had with

01:03.600 --> 01:11.920
 Yaron Brooke about Objectivism. Some people loved it, some people hated it. I misspoke in some parts,

01:11.920 --> 01:17.040
 was more critical on occasion than I meant to be, didn't push on certain points that I should have,

01:17.040 --> 01:22.320
 was undereducated or completely unaware about some major things that happened in the past,

01:22.320 --> 01:29.920
 or major ideas out there. I bring all that up to say that if we are to have difficult conversations,

01:29.920 --> 01:36.800
 we have to give each other space to make mistakes, to learn, to grow. Taking one or two statements

01:36.800 --> 01:44.800
 from a three hour podcast and suggesting that they encapsulate who I am, I was, or ever will be,

01:44.800 --> 01:50.240
 is a standard that we can't hold each other to. I don't think anyone could live up to that kind

01:50.240 --> 01:57.680
 of standard, at least I know I can't. The conversation with Yaron is mild, relative to some conversations

01:57.680 --> 02:03.760
 that I will likely have in the coming year. Please continue to challenge me, but please try to do so

02:03.760 --> 02:11.920
 with love and with patience. I promise to work my ass off to improve. Whether I'm successful at that

02:11.920 --> 02:17.200
 or not, we shall see. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars

02:23.280 --> 02:31.280
 Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Andrew Huberman. You've mentioned that in your

02:31.280 --> 02:37.680
 lab at Stanford, you do stress by putting people into virtual reality and having them go through

02:38.480 --> 02:42.800
 one of a set of experiences. I think you mentioned this on Rogan or with Whitney,

02:42.800 --> 02:50.400
 that scare them. So just on a practical, psychological level and maybe on a philosophical

02:50.400 --> 02:57.440
 level, what are people afraid of? What are the fears? What are these fear experiences that

02:57.440 --> 03:02.800
 you find to be effective? Yeah, so it depends on the person, obviously. And we should probably

03:02.800 --> 03:08.800
 define fear, right? Because you can, without going too far down the rabbit hole of defining

03:08.800 --> 03:14.640
 these things, you can't really have fear without stress, but you could have stress without fear.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.520
 And you can't really have trauma without fear and stress, but you could have fear and stress

03:19.520 --> 03:23.440
 without trauma. So we can start playing the word game, and that actually is one of the

03:23.440 --> 03:27.840
 motivations for even having a laboratory that studies these things is that we really need better

03:28.720 --> 03:34.400
 physiological, neuroscientific, and operational definitions of what these things are. I mean,

03:34.400 --> 03:40.400
 the field of understanding emotions and states, which is mainly what I'm interested in,

03:41.040 --> 03:47.360
 is very complicated. But we can do away with a lot of complicated debate and say,

03:47.360 --> 03:54.960
 in our laboratory, what we're looking for to assign it a value of fear is a big inflection

03:54.960 --> 03:58.640
 in autonomic arousal. So increases in heart rate, increases in breathing,

03:58.640 --> 04:05.120
 perspiration, pupil dilation, all the hallmark signature features of the stress response.

04:06.480 --> 04:11.040
 And in some cases, we have the benefit of getting neurosurgery patients where we've got

04:11.040 --> 04:16.480
 electrodes in their amygdala and their insula and the orbital frontal cortex down beneath the skull.

04:16.480 --> 04:21.280
 So these are chronically implanted electrodes, we're getting multiunit signals. And we can start

04:21.280 --> 04:28.800
 seeing some central features of meaning within the brain. And what's interesting is that

04:30.080 --> 04:39.200
 as trivial as it might seem in listening to it, almost everybody responds to heights and falling

04:39.200 --> 04:46.640
 from a high virtual place with a very strong stress, if not fear response. And that's because

04:46.640 --> 04:52.880
 the visual vestibular apparatus, the optic flow and how it links to the balanced semicircular

04:52.880 --> 04:59.280
 canals in the inner ears, all this technical stuff. But really, all of that pulls all your

04:59.280 --> 05:03.520
 physiology, the feeling that your stomach is dropping, the feeling that suddenly you're

05:03.520 --> 05:07.600
 sweating even though you're not afraid of falling off this virtual platform, but you feel as if

05:07.600 --> 05:14.640
 you're falling because of the optic flow, that one is universal. So we've got a dive with Great

05:14.640 --> 05:19.680
 White Sharks experience where you actually exit the cage. We went out into this in the real world

05:19.680 --> 05:24.480
 and brought back 360 video that's built out pretty. Oh, so this is actually 360 video?

05:24.480 --> 05:29.680
 360 video. And this was important to us, right? So when we decided to set up this platform,

05:29.680 --> 05:35.840
 a lot of the motivation was that a lot of the studies of these things in laboratories, I don't

05:35.840 --> 05:39.040
 want to call them lame because I want to be respectful of the people that did this stuff

05:39.040 --> 05:45.280
 before, but they'd study fear by showing subjects a picture of a bloody arm or a snake or something

05:45.280 --> 05:50.560
 like that. And it just, unless you have a snake phobia, it just wasn't creating a real enough

05:50.560 --> 05:54.240
 experience. So we need to do something where people aren't going to get injured, but where we

05:54.240 --> 05:59.040
 can tap into the physiology and that thing of presence of people momentarily, not the whole

05:59.040 --> 06:04.800
 time, but momentarily forgetting they're in a laboratory. And so heights will always do it.

06:04.800 --> 06:09.680
 And I, if people want to challenge me on this, I like to point to that movie Free Solo,

06:09.680 --> 06:14.720
 which was wild because, you know, it's incredible movie, but I think a lot of its popularity can

06:14.720 --> 06:21.200
 be explained by a puzzle, which is you knew he was going to live when you walked in the theater

06:21.200 --> 06:27.440
 or you watched it at home. You knew before that he survived. And yet it was still scary

06:27.440 --> 06:31.840
 that people somehow were able to put themselves into that experience or into Alex's experience

06:31.840 --> 06:38.720
 enough that they, they were concerned or worried or afraid at some level. So heights always does it.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.480
 If we get people who have generalized anxiety, these are people who

06:43.440 --> 06:48.880
 wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of autonomic arousal and anxiety,

06:48.880 --> 06:53.520
 then we can tip them a little bit more easily with things that don't necessarily get everyone afraid,

06:54.080 --> 07:00.720
 things like claustrophobia, public speaking, that's going to vary from person to person.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.800
 And then if you're afraid of sharks, like my sister, for instance, afraid of sharks,

07:04.800 --> 07:09.360
 she won't even come to my laboratory because there's, there's a thing about sharks in it.

07:09.360 --> 07:14.960
 That's how terrified some people are of these specific stimuli, but heights get some every time.

07:15.600 --> 07:21.120
 And I'm terrified of heights. It's, you know, when we have you step off a platform,

07:21.120 --> 07:26.640
 virtual platform, and it's a flat floor in my lab, but we, you're up there.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.280
 Well, you actually allow them the possibility in the virtual world to actually take the leap

07:31.280 --> 07:36.000
 of faith. Yeah, maybe I should describe a little bit of the experiment. So without giving away too

07:36.000 --> 07:39.920
 much in case someone wants to be a subject in one of these experiments, we have them playing

07:39.920 --> 07:44.800
 a cognitive game. It's a simple lights out kind of game where you're pointing a cursor and turning

07:44.800 --> 07:50.160
 out lights on a grid, but it gets increasingly complex and it speeds up on them. And, you know,

07:50.160 --> 07:54.320
 there's a failure point for everybody where they just can't make the motor commands fast enough.

07:54.320 --> 08:00.640
 And then we surprise people essentially by placing them virtually all of a sudden,

08:00.640 --> 08:06.640
 they're just, they're on a narrow platform between two buildings. And then we encourage them or we

08:07.280 --> 08:11.920
 cue them with a, with talking to them through a microphone to continue across that platform to

08:11.920 --> 08:19.040
 continue the game. And, you know, some people, they just won't, they actually will hold, get down

08:19.040 --> 08:24.480
 on the ground and hold on to a virtual beam that doesn't even exist on a flat floor. And so what

08:24.480 --> 08:30.880
 this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these virtual states as if they were real.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.040
 And we really think that anchoring the visual and the vestibular, the balance

08:35.040 --> 08:40.320
 components of the nervous system are what bring people into that presence so quickly. There's

08:40.320 --> 08:45.680
 also the potential and we haven't done this yet to bring in 360 sound. So the reason we did 360

08:45.680 --> 08:51.200
 video is that when we started all this back in 2016, a lot of the VR was pretty lame, frankly,

08:51.200 --> 08:57.920
 it was CGI. It just wasn't real enough. But with 360 video, we knew that we could get people into

08:57.920 --> 09:02.080
 this presence where they think they're in a real experience more quickly. And our friend,

09:02.080 --> 09:05.840
 Michael Muller, who I was introduced to because of the project I reached out to some friends,

09:05.840 --> 09:10.320
 Michael Muller is a very famous portrait photographer in Hollywood, but he dives with

09:10.320 --> 09:17.520
 great white sharks and he leaves the cage. And so we worked with him to build a 360 video apparatus

09:17.520 --> 09:23.680
 that we could swim underwater with, went out to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, and actually got the

09:23.680 --> 09:27.600
 experience. It was a lot of fun. There were some interesting moments out there of danger,

09:27.600 --> 09:31.280
 but it came back with that video and built that for the sharks. And then we realized,

09:31.280 --> 09:34.240
 we need to do this for everything. We need to do it for heights. We need to do it for public

09:34.240 --> 09:41.520
 speaking, for claustrophobia. And what's missing still is 360 sound, where 360 sound would be,

09:42.240 --> 09:47.920
 for instance, if I were to turn around and there was a giant attack dog there,

09:47.920 --> 09:52.560
 the moment I would turn around and see it, the dog would growl. But if I turn back toward you,

09:52.560 --> 09:58.400
 then it would be silent. And that brings a very real element to one's own behavior,

09:58.400 --> 10:02.640
 where you don't know what's going to happen if you turn a corner. Whereas if there's a dog growling

10:02.640 --> 10:08.480
 behind me and I turn around and then I turn back to you and it's still growling, that might seem

10:08.480 --> 10:14.160
 like more of an impending threat and sustained threat. But actually, it's when you start linking

10:14.160 --> 10:19.920
 your own body movements to the experience. So when it's closed loop, where my movements and choices

10:19.920 --> 10:24.560
 are starting to influence things and they're getting scarier and scarier, that's when you can

10:24.560 --> 10:30.000
 really drive people's nervous system down these paths of high states of stress and fear. Now,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.200
 we don't want to traumatize people, obviously, but we also study a number of tools that allow

10:35.200 --> 10:39.280
 them to calm themselves in these environments. So the short answer is height.

10:39.280 --> 10:44.320
 Height? Yeah. Well, from a psychology and from a neuroscience perspective,

10:44.320 --> 10:49.920
 this whole construction that you've developed is fascinating. We did this a little bit with

10:49.920 --> 10:57.280
 autonomous vehicles. So to try to understand the decision making process of a pedestrian when they

10:57.280 --> 11:04.160
 cross the road and trying to create an experience of a car that can run you over. So there's the

11:04.160 --> 11:13.680
 danger there. I was so surprised how real that whole world was. And the graphics that we built

11:13.680 --> 11:19.520
 wasn't ultra realistic or anything, but I was still afraid of being hit by a car. Everybody we

11:19.520 --> 11:23.360
 tested were really afraid of being hit by that car. Even though it was all a simulation. It was

11:23.360 --> 11:30.240
 all a simulation. It was kind of a boxy, actually. I mean, it wasn't like ultra realistic simulation.

11:30.240 --> 11:40.160
 It's fascinating. Looms and heights. So any kind of depth, we're just programmed to not necessarily

11:40.160 --> 11:45.040
 recoil, but to be cautious about that edge and that depth. And then looms, things coming at us

11:45.040 --> 11:49.360
 that are getting larger. There are looming sensing neurons even in the retina at a very,

11:49.360 --> 11:57.920
 very early stage of visual processing. And incidentally, the way Mueller and folks learned

11:57.920 --> 12:02.320
 how to not get eaten by great white sharks when you're swimming outside the cage is as they start

12:02.320 --> 12:07.680
 lumbering in, you swim toward them. And they get very confused when you loom on them because

12:07.680 --> 12:12.640
 clearly you're smaller. Clearly they could eat you if they wanted to. But there's something about

12:12.640 --> 12:17.760
 forward movement toward any creature that that creature questions whether or not it would be a

12:17.760 --> 12:23.920
 good idea to generate forward movement toward you. And so that's actually the survival tool of these

12:23.920 --> 12:28.400
 cage exit white shark divers. Are you playing around with like one of the critical things for

12:28.400 --> 12:34.240
 the autonomous vehicle research is you couldn't do 360 video because there's a game theoretic.

12:34.240 --> 12:40.080
 There's an interactive element that's really necessary. So maybe people realize this. Maybe

12:40.080 --> 12:46.320
 they don't. But 360 video, you obviously, well, it's actually not that obvious to people, but you

12:46.320 --> 12:54.240
 can't change the reality that you're watching. That's right. But you find that that's like,

12:54.240 --> 13:00.640
 is there something fundamental about fear and stress that the interactive element is essential for?

13:00.640 --> 13:07.760
 Or do you find you can you can arouse people with just the video? Great question. It works best to

13:07.760 --> 13:13.680
 use mixed reality. So we have a snake stimulus. I personally don't like snakes at all. I don't

13:13.680 --> 13:17.840
 mind spiders. We also have a spider stimulus. But like snakes, I just don't like them. There's

13:17.840 --> 13:22.960
 something about the the slithering and the it just creates a visceral response for me.

13:23.840 --> 13:29.040
 Some people not so much. And they have lower levels of stress and fear in there. But one way

13:29.040 --> 13:36.000
 that we can get them to feel more of that is to use mixed reality, where we have an actual physical

13:36.000 --> 13:42.240
 bat, and they have to stomp out the snake as opposed to just walk to a little safe corner,

13:42.240 --> 13:47.360
 which then makes the snake disappear. That tends to be not as stressful as if they have a physical

13:47.360 --> 13:51.280
 weapon. And so you've got people in there, you know, banging on the floor against this thing.

13:51.280 --> 13:56.400
 And there's something about engaging that makes it more of a more of a threat. Now,

13:56.400 --> 14:01.520
 I should also mention we we always get the subjective report from the subject of what

14:01.520 --> 14:06.400
 they experienced because I we never want to project our own ideas about what they were feeling.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.680
 But that's the beauty of working with humans is you can ask them how they feel.

14:09.680 --> 14:15.600
 Exactly. And humans aren't great at explaining how they feel. But it's a lot easier to understand

14:15.600 --> 14:21.680
 what they're saying than a mouse or a macaque monkey is saying. So it's the best we can do

14:21.680 --> 14:25.360
 is language plus these physiological and neurophysiological signals.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.720
 Is there something you've learned about yourself about your deepest fears?

14:28.720 --> 14:33.360
 Like you said snakes, is there something that like if I were to torture you,

14:33.360 --> 14:39.920
 I'm so I'm Russian. So, you know, I always kind of think, how can I murder this people that this

14:39.920 --> 14:45.120
 person entered the room? But also, how can I torture you to get some information out of you?

14:46.320 --> 14:50.880
 What would I go with? It's interesting, you should say that I never considered myself claustrophobic.

14:51.760 --> 14:59.440
 But because I don't mind small environments provided they're well ventilated. But before

14:59.440 --> 15:04.240
 COVID, I started going to this Russian Banya, you know, and then we jumped here. And I had never

15:04.240 --> 15:09.440
 been to a Banya. So, you know, the whole experience of really, really hot sauna. And what are they

15:09.440 --> 15:14.960
 called the plots? They're hitting you with the leaves. And it gets really hot and humid in there.

15:14.960 --> 15:19.200
 And there were a couple of times where I thought, okay, this thing is below ground.

15:20.320 --> 15:26.800
 It's in a city where there are a lot of earthquakes. Like if this place crumbled and we were stuck in

15:26.800 --> 15:31.600
 here, and I'd start getting a little panicky, and I realized I'm like, I don't like small confined

15:31.600 --> 15:36.080
 spaces with poor ventilation. So I realized I think I have some claustrophobia. And I wasn't

15:36.080 --> 15:41.920
 aware of that before. So I put myself into our own claustrophobia stimulus, which involves getting

15:41.920 --> 15:49.280
 into an elevator. And with a bunch of people, virtual people, and the elevator gets stalled.

15:49.280 --> 15:54.320
 And at first, you're fine, you feel fine. But then as we start modulating the environment,

15:54.320 --> 15:58.160
 and we actually can control levels of oxygen in the environment if we want to,

15:59.280 --> 16:03.680
 it is really uncomfortable for me. And I never would have thought, you know, I fly,

16:03.680 --> 16:09.760
 I'm comfortable in planes, but it is really uncomfortable. And so I think I've unhatched

16:09.760 --> 16:16.160
 a bit of a claustrophobia. Yeah. Yeah, for me as well, probably. That one, that one's pretty bad.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.120
 The heights, I tried to overcome. So I went to skydiving to try to overcome the fear of heights,

16:21.120 --> 16:26.240
 but that didn't help. Did you jump out? Yeah, jump out. But it was, it was a,

16:26.240 --> 16:31.840
 it was fundamentally different experience. And I guess there could be a lot of different

16:31.840 --> 16:39.600
 flavors of fear of heights, maybe. But the one I have didn't seem to be connected to jumping

16:39.600 --> 16:44.000
 out of a plane. It's a very different, because like once you accept that you're going to jump,

16:44.000 --> 16:51.520
 then it's, it's a different thing. I think what I'm afraid of is the moments before it

16:52.080 --> 16:58.960
 is the scariest part. Absolutely. And I don't think that's emphasized in the skydiving experience

16:58.960 --> 17:05.200
 as much. And also just the acceptance of the fact that it's going to happen. So once you accept it

17:05.200 --> 17:10.960
 is going to happen, it's not as scary. It's the fact that it's not supposed to happen. And it might,

17:10.960 --> 17:16.080
 that's the scary part. I guess I'm not being eloquent in this description, but there's something

17:16.080 --> 17:23.280
 about skydiving that was actually philosophically liberating. I was, I was like, wow, it, it was

17:24.400 --> 17:29.520
 the possibility that you can walk on a surface. And then at a certain point, there's no surface

17:29.520 --> 17:35.440
 anymore to walk on. And it's all of a sudden the world becomes three dimensional. And there's this

17:35.440 --> 17:43.200
 freedom of floating that the concept of like, of earth disappears for a brief few seconds. I don't

17:43.200 --> 17:48.960
 know. That was, that was wild. That was wild, but I'm still terrified of heights. So I mean, one,

17:48.960 --> 17:54.800
 one thing I want to ask just on fear, because it's so fascinating is, have you

17:55.920 --> 18:02.480
 learned anything about what it takes to overcome fears? Yes. And that comes from two, from a,

18:02.480 --> 18:09.200
 you know, research study standpoint, two parallel tracks of research. One was done actually in mice,

18:09.760 --> 18:13.200
 because we have a mouse lab also where we can probe around in different brain areas and try

18:13.200 --> 18:17.680
 and figure out what interesting brain areas we might want to probe around in humans. And

18:18.720 --> 18:24.320
 a graduate student in my lab, she's now at Caltech, Lindsey Salay, published a paper back

18:24.320 --> 18:31.440
 in 2018 showing that what at first might seem a little bit obvious, but the mechanisms are not,

18:31.440 --> 18:36.640
 which is that there are really three responses to fear. You can pause, you can freeze essentially.

18:37.760 --> 18:43.440
 You can retreat, you can back up, or you can go forward. And there's a single hub of neurons

18:43.440 --> 18:48.880
 in the midbrain, in the, just actually not the midbrain, but it's in the middle of the thalamus,

18:48.880 --> 18:55.120
 which is a forebrain structure. And depending on which neurons are active there, there's a much

18:55.120 --> 19:00.160
 higher probability that a mouse or it turns out or a human will advance in the face of fear,

19:00.160 --> 19:06.320
 or will pause or will retreat. Now, that just assigns a neural structure to a behavioral phenomenon.

19:06.320 --> 19:13.440
 But what's interesting is that it turns out that the lowest level of stress or autonomic arousal

19:13.440 --> 19:19.680
 is actually associated with the pausing and freezing response. Then as the threat becomes

19:19.680 --> 19:26.480
 more impending, and we used visual looms in this case, the retreat response has a slightly higher

19:26.480 --> 19:30.880
 level of autonomic arousal and stress. So think about playing hide and go, seeking or trying to

19:30.880 --> 19:36.720
 stay quiet in a closet that you're hiding. If you're very calm, it's easy to stay quiet and

19:36.720 --> 19:43.280
 still. As your level of stress goes up, it's harder to maintain that level of quiet and stillness.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.760
 You see this also in animals that are stalking, a cat will chatter its teeth. That's actually

19:48.320 --> 19:53.280
 sort of top down inhibition and trying to restrain behavior. So the freeze response

19:53.280 --> 19:58.560
 is actually an active response, but it's fairly low stress. And what was interesting to us is that

19:58.560 --> 20:04.000
 the highest level of autonomic arousal was associated with the forward movement toward

20:04.000 --> 20:10.240
 the threat. So in your case, jumping out of the plane. However, the forward movement in the face

20:10.240 --> 20:16.320
 of threat was linked to the activation of what we call collateral, which means just a side

20:16.320 --> 20:21.360
 connection, literally a wire in the brain that connects to the dopamine circuits for reward.

20:21.360 --> 20:28.720
 And so when one safely and adaptively, meaning you survive, moves through a threat or toward a

20:28.720 --> 20:35.360
 threat, it's rewarded as a positive experience. And so the key, it actually maps very well the

20:35.360 --> 20:40.240
 cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot of the existing treatments for trauma is that you have

20:40.240 --> 20:46.960
 to confront the thing that makes you afraid. So otherwise, you exist in this very low level of

20:46.960 --> 20:52.480
 reverbitory circuit activity where the circuits for autonomic arousal are humming and they're

20:52.480 --> 20:56.560
 humming more and more and more. And we have to remember that stress and fear and threat were

20:56.560 --> 21:02.800
 designed to agitate us so that we actually move. So the reason I mention this is I think a lot

21:02.800 --> 21:08.640
 of times people think that the maximum stress response or fear response is to freeze and to

21:08.640 --> 21:14.320
 lock up. But that's actually not the maximum stress response. The maximum stress response is to

21:14.320 --> 21:20.880
 advance, but it's associated with reward. It has positive valence. So there's this kind of,

21:20.880 --> 21:28.240
 everyone always thinks about the bell shape curve for at low levels of rousal performance is low.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.760
 And as the increases performance goes higher, and then it drops off as you get really stressed.

21:31.760 --> 21:37.040
 But there's another bump further out that's distribution where you perform very well under

21:37.040 --> 21:41.120
 very high levels of stress. And so we've been spending a lot of time in humans and in animals

21:41.120 --> 21:48.800
 exploring what it takes to get people comfortable to go to that place. And also to let them experience

21:48.800 --> 21:54.080
 how there are heightened states of cognition there. There's changes in time perception that

21:54.080 --> 21:59.760
 allow you to evaluate your environment at a faster frame rate, essentially. This is the

21:59.760 --> 22:05.840
 matrix as a lot of people think of it. But we tend to think about fear as all the low level

22:05.840 --> 22:12.320
 stuff where things aren't worked out. But there are many, there are a lot of different features

22:12.320 --> 22:17.200
 to the fear response. And so we think about it quantitatively and we think about it from a circuit

22:17.200 --> 22:22.640
 perspective in terms of outcomes. And we try and weigh that against the threat. So we never want

22:22.640 --> 22:26.960
 people to put themselves in unnecessary risk. But that's where the VR is fun, because you can push

22:26.960 --> 22:32.560
 people hard without risk of physically injuring them. And that's a, like you said, the little

22:32.560 --> 22:37.760
 bump that that seems to be a very small fraction of the human experience, right? So it's kind of

22:37.760 --> 22:45.680
 fascinating to study it. Because most of us move through life without ever experiencing that kind

22:45.680 --> 22:51.760
 of focus. Well, everything's in a peak state there. I really think that's where optimal

22:51.760 --> 22:58.400
 performance lies. There's so many interesting words here. But what's performance? And what's

22:58.400 --> 23:05.760
 optimal performance? We're talking about mental ability to what, to perceive the environment

23:05.760 --> 23:10.960
 quickly, to make actions quickly. What's optimal performance? Yeah, well, it's very subjective

23:10.960 --> 23:17.120
 and it varies depending on task and environment. So one way we can make it a little bit more

23:17.120 --> 23:24.960
 operational and concrete is to say, there is a sweet spot, if you will, where the level of

23:24.960 --> 23:33.040
 internal autonomic arousal, aka stress or alertness, whatever you want to call it, is ideally matched

23:33.040 --> 23:39.200
 to the speed of whatever challenge you have to be facing in the outside world. So we all have

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
 perception of the outside world as exteroception and the perception of our internal real estate

23:44.000 --> 23:48.880
 interoception. And when those two think when interoception and exteroception are matched

23:48.880 --> 23:58.000
 along a couple dimensions, performance tends to increase or tends to be in an optimal range.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.760
 So for instance, if you're, I don't play guitar, but I know you play guitar. So let's say you're

24:01.760 --> 24:06.880
 trying to learn something new on the guitar. I'm not saying that being in these super high

24:06.880 --> 24:13.600
 states of activation are the best place for you to be in order to learn. It may be that your internal

24:13.600 --> 24:19.760
 arousal needs to be at a level where your analysis of space and time has to be well matched to the

24:19.760 --> 24:25.600
 information coming in and what you're trying to do in terms of performance, in terms of playing

24:25.600 --> 24:31.280
 chords and notes and so forth. Now, in these cases of high threat where things are coming in quickly

24:31.280 --> 24:36.880
 and animals and humans need to react very quickly, the higher your state of autonomic arousal, the

24:36.880 --> 24:42.800
 better because you're slicing time more finely just because of the way the autonomic system works,

24:42.800 --> 24:49.680
 the pupil dilation, for instance, and movement of the lens essentially changes your optics.

24:49.680 --> 24:55.280
 That's obvious. But with the change in optics is a change in how you bend time and slice time,

24:55.280 --> 25:00.640
 which allows you to get more frames per second readout. With the guitar learning, for instance,

25:00.640 --> 25:08.240
 it might actually be that you want to be almost sleepy, almost in a kind of drowsy state to be

25:08.240 --> 25:13.760
 able to, and I don't play music, so I'm guessing here, but sense some of the nuance in the chords

25:13.760 --> 25:17.920
 or the ways that you're to be relaxed enough that your fingers can follow an external cue. So

25:17.920 --> 25:23.600
 matching the movement of your fingers to something that's pure extra reception. And so there is no

25:24.800 --> 25:32.800
 perfect autonomic state for performance. This is why I don't favor terms like flow because

25:32.800 --> 25:40.480
 they're not well operationally defined enough. But I do believe that optimal or peak performance

25:40.480 --> 25:47.920
 is going to arise when internal state is ideally matched to the space time features of the external

25:47.920 --> 25:54.320
 demands. So there's some slicing of time that happens, and then you're able to adjust a slice

25:54.320 --> 26:01.440
 time more finely or more or less finely in order to adjust to the stimulus, the dynamics of the

26:01.440 --> 26:10.560
 stimulus. What about the the realm of ideas? So like, you know, I'm a big believer, this guy named

26:10.560 --> 26:18.640
 Cal Newport who wrote a book about deep work. Yeah, I love that book. Yeah, he's great. I mean,

26:18.640 --> 26:24.240
 one of the nice things, I've always practiced deep work, but it's always nice to have words

26:25.920 --> 26:31.200
 put to the concepts that you've practiced. It somehow makes them more concrete and allows

26:31.200 --> 26:38.320
 you to get better. It turns it into a skill that you can get better at. But, you know, I also value

26:38.320 --> 26:46.240
 deep thinking, where you think it's almost meditative, you think about a particular concept

26:46.240 --> 26:50.960
 for long periods of time, the programming you have to do that kind of thing for, you just have to

26:50.960 --> 26:56.880
 hold this concept, like, like you hold it, and then you take steps with it, you take further

26:56.880 --> 27:03.040
 steps, and you're holding relatively complicated things in your mind as you're thinking about them.

27:03.040 --> 27:10.320
 And there's a lot of, I mean, the hardest part is there's a frustrating things like you take a step,

27:10.320 --> 27:14.960
 but it turns out to be the wrong direction. So you have to calmly turn around and take a step back,

27:14.960 --> 27:19.360
 and then it's you kind of like exploring through the space of ideas. Is there something about

27:20.000 --> 27:25.200
 your study of optimal performance that could be applied to the act of thinking,

27:25.200 --> 27:32.960
 as opposed to action? Well, we haven't done too much work there, but I think I can comment on it

27:32.960 --> 27:38.080
 from a neuroscience perspective, which is really all I do is, well, we do experiments in the lab,

27:38.080 --> 27:43.680
 but looking at things through the lens of neuroscience. So what you're describing can be

27:43.680 --> 27:50.800
 mapped fairly well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change

27:50.800 --> 27:57.680
 in information that's coming back into your brain. Jack Feldman, who I'm a huge fan of and

27:57.680 --> 28:03.120
 fortunate to be friends with, is a professor at UCLA, works on respiration and breathing,

28:03.120 --> 28:07.920
 but he has a physics background. And so he thinks about respiration and breathing in terms of

28:08.720 --> 28:13.680
 ground states and how they modulate other states, very, very interesting and I think,

28:13.680 --> 28:19.840
 important work. Jack has an answer to your question. So I'm not going to get this exactly

28:19.840 --> 28:23.440
 right because this is lifted from a coffee conversation that we had about a month ago.

28:24.240 --> 28:30.960
 So apologies in advance, but I think I can get it mostly right. So we were talking about this,

28:30.960 --> 28:36.880
 about how the brain updates cognitive states depending on demands and thinking in particular.

28:37.440 --> 28:41.120
 And he used an interesting example, I'd be curious to know if you agree or disagree.

28:41.120 --> 28:50.240
 He said, most great mathematics is done by people in their late teens and 20s, even you

28:50.240 --> 28:55.120
 could say early 20s, sometimes into the late 20s, but not much further on. Maybe I just

28:55.120 --> 29:00.800
 insulted some mathematicians. No, that's true. And I think that it demands, his argument was

29:01.440 --> 29:07.280
 there's a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number

29:07.280 --> 29:11.200
 of plates spinning, so to speak, mentally and run back and forth between them, updating them.

29:12.320 --> 29:19.040
 In physics, Jack said, and I think this makes sense to me too, that there's

29:19.680 --> 29:26.880
 a reliance on working memory, but an increased reliance on some sort of deep memory and deep

29:26.880 --> 29:31.840
 memory stores, probably stuff that's moved out of the hippocampus and forebraining into the cortex

29:31.840 --> 29:38.480
 and is more some episodic and declarative stuff. But really, so you're pulling from your library,

29:38.480 --> 29:42.400
 basically, it's not all RAM, it's not all working memory. And then in biology,

29:43.280 --> 29:49.440
 and physicists tend to have very active careers into their 30s and 40s and 50s and so forth,

29:49.440 --> 29:54.960
 sometimes later. And then in biology, you see careers that have a much longer arc,

29:54.960 --> 30:00.880
 kind of these protracted careers often, people still in their 60s and 70s doing really terrific work.

30:00.880 --> 30:05.120
 Not always doing it with their own hands because people in the labs are doing them, of course,

30:05.120 --> 30:12.800
 but and that work does tend to rely on insights gained from having a very deep knowledge base

30:13.360 --> 30:18.800
 where you can remember a paper or maybe a figure in a paper, you could go look it up if you wanted

30:18.800 --> 30:24.080
 to, but it's very different than the working memory of the mathematician. And so when you're

30:24.080 --> 30:30.640
 talking about coding or being in that tunnel of thought and trying to iterate and keeping a lot

30:30.640 --> 30:37.040
 of plate spinning, it speaks directly to working memory. My lab hasn't done too much of that.

30:37.040 --> 30:41.840
 Working memory. But we are pushing working memory when we have people do things like

30:41.840 --> 30:46.560
 these simple lights out tasks while they're under, we can increase the cognitive load

30:46.560 --> 30:51.200
 by increasing the level of autonomic arousal to the point where they start doing less well.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.920
 And, you know, everyone has a cliff. This is what's kind of fun. We've had, you know,

30:55.920 --> 31:01.040
 seal team operators come to the lab, we have people from other units in the military, very,

31:01.040 --> 31:05.680
 you know, we've had a range of of intellects and backgrounds and all sorts of things and

31:05.680 --> 31:12.960
 everyone has a cliff. And those cliffs sometimes show up as a function of the demands of speed

31:12.960 --> 31:18.480
 of processing or how many things you need to keep online. I mean, we're all limited at some

31:18.480 --> 31:21.760
 point in the number of things we can keep online. So what you're describing is very interesting

31:21.760 --> 31:28.720
 because it I think it has to do with how narrow or broad the information set is because and I don't

31:28.720 --> 31:33.600
 program I'm not an active programmer. So this is a regime I don't really fully know. So I don't

31:33.600 --> 31:39.920
 want to comment about it in that in any way that, you know, doesn't suggest that. But I think that

31:39.920 --> 31:46.800
 what you're talking about is top down control. So this is prefrontal cortex, keeping every bit

31:46.800 --> 31:50.880
 of reflexive circuitry at bay, the one that makes you want to get up and use the restroom,

31:50.880 --> 31:56.080
 the one that makes you want to check your phone, all of that, but also running these

31:56.080 --> 32:01.360
 anterior thalamus to prefrontal cortex loops, which we know are very important for working

32:01.360 --> 32:09.600
 memory. Yeah, let me try to think through this a little bit. So reducing the process of thinking

32:09.600 --> 32:18.960
 to working memory access is tricky. He's probably ultimately correct. But if I were to say some

32:18.960 --> 32:27.280
 of the most challenging things that an engineer has to do, and a scientific thinker, I would say

32:27.280 --> 32:32.400
 it's kind of depressing to think that we do that best in our 20s. But is this kind of first

32:32.400 --> 32:43.520
 principles thinking step of saying you you're accessing the things that you know, and then

32:43.520 --> 32:49.840
 saying, Well, let me how do I do this differently than I've done it before this this weird like

32:50.880 --> 32:58.080
 stepping back like, is this right? Let's try it this other way that that's the most

32:58.800 --> 33:06.480
 mentally taxing step is like, you've gotten quite good at this particular pattern of how you solve

33:06.480 --> 33:11.600
 this particular problem. So there's a there's a pattern recognition first, you're like, Okay,

33:11.600 --> 33:16.160
 I know how to build a thing that solves this particular problem in programming, say,

33:16.160 --> 33:24.160
 and then the question is, but can I do it much better? And I don't know if that's

33:25.360 --> 33:28.800
 I don't know what the hell that is. I don't know if that's accessing working memory.

33:29.760 --> 33:34.720
 That's that's almost access. Maybe it is accessing memory in a sense is trying to find

33:35.760 --> 33:39.840
 similar patterns in a totally different place that could be projected onto this.

33:39.840 --> 33:48.080
 But you're you're it's you're not querying facts, you're querying, like, functional things, like,

33:48.720 --> 33:52.640
 yes, patterns, I mean, you're running out, you're testing algorithms. Yeah, right,

33:52.640 --> 33:59.280
 you're testing algorithms. So I want to just because I know some of the people listening

33:59.280 --> 34:04.400
 to this and you how have basis in, you know, scientific training and have scientific training.

34:04.400 --> 34:09.360
 So I want to be clear, I think we can be correct about some things like the role of working memory

34:09.360 --> 34:13.200
 in these kinds of processes without being exhaustive. We're not saying they're the only thing

34:13.200 --> 34:17.440
 we're not, you know, we can be correct, but not assume that that's the only thing involved.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.840
 Right. And I mean, neuroscience, let's face it is still in its infancy. I mean, we probably

34:21.840 --> 34:26.800
 know 1% of what there is to know about the brain. You know, we've learned so much. And yet,

34:27.440 --> 34:33.520
 there may be global states that underlie this that make prefrontal circuitry work differently

34:33.520 --> 34:38.320
 than it would in a in a different regime, or even time of day. I mean, there's a lot of mysteries

34:38.320 --> 34:44.720
 about this. But so I just want to make sure that we sort of are we're aiming for precision

34:44.720 --> 34:49.680
 inaccuracy, but we're not going to be exhaustive. So there's a difference there. And I think,

34:50.240 --> 34:53.920
 you know, sometimes in the vastness of the internet, that gets forgotten.

34:55.440 --> 35:05.920
 So the other is that, you know, we think about, you know, we think about these operations at,

35:05.920 --> 35:10.960
 you know, really focused keeping a lot of things online. But what you were describing is actually

35:12.000 --> 35:18.880
 it, it speaks to the very real possibility probably that with certainty, there's another

35:18.880 --> 35:23.200
 element to all this, which is when you're trying out lots of things, in particular,

35:23.200 --> 35:28.800
 lots of different algorithms, you don't want to be in a in a state of very high autonomic

35:28.800 --> 35:33.120
 arousal. That's not what you want, because the higher level of autonomic arousal and stress in

35:33.120 --> 35:38.320
 the system, the more rigidly you're going to analyze space and time. Right. And what you're

35:38.320 --> 35:43.120
 talking about is playing with space time dimensionality. And I want to be very clear. I mean,

35:43.120 --> 35:47.360
 I'm the son of a physicist. I am not a physicist. When I talk about space and time, I'm literally

35:47.360 --> 35:53.520
 talking about visual space and how long it takes for my finger to move from this point to this point.

35:53.520 --> 35:58.000
 You are facing a tiger and trying to figure out how to avoid being eaten by the tiger.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.560
 And that's primarily going to be determined by the visual system in humans. We don't walk

36:02.560 --> 36:08.640
 through space, for instance, like a sent hound would and look at three dimensional sent plumes.

36:08.640 --> 36:13.360
 You know, when a sent hound goes out in the environment, they have depth to their odor

36:13.360 --> 36:18.560
 trip, the odor trails they're following. And they don't think about them. We don't think about odor

36:18.560 --> 36:22.560
 trails. You might say, Oh, well, the smell is getting more intense. Aha. But they actually

36:22.560 --> 36:27.840
 have three dimensional odor trails. So they see a cone of odor, see, of course, with their nose,

36:27.840 --> 36:33.360
 with their olfactory cortex. We do that with our visual system. And we parse time often

36:33.360 --> 36:38.480
 subconsciously, mainly with our visual system, also with our auditory system. And this shows up

36:38.480 --> 36:42.640
 for the musicians out there, metronomes are a great way to play with this, you know, base

36:42.640 --> 36:46.640
 drumming, when the frequency of base drumming changes, your perception of time changes quite

36:46.640 --> 36:51.760
 a lot. So in any event, space and time are linked in that through the sensory apparatus,

36:51.760 --> 36:55.840
 through the eyes and ears and nose, and probably through taste to and through touch

36:55.840 --> 37:04.160
 for us, but mainly through vision. So when you drop into some coding or iterating through a

37:04.160 --> 37:12.160
 creative process or trying to solve something hard, you can't really do that well if you're in a rigid

37:13.440 --> 37:17.680
 high level of autonomic arousal, because you're plugging in algorithms that are

37:17.680 --> 37:23.440
 in this space regime, this time regime matches at space time matched, whereas creativity,

37:23.440 --> 37:26.640
 I always think the lava lamp is actually a pretty good example, even though it has these

37:26.640 --> 37:30.320
 counterculture, new agey connotations, because you actually don't know which

37:30.320 --> 37:37.120
 direction things are going to change. And so in drowsy states, sleeping and drowsy states,

37:37.120 --> 37:41.440
 space and time become dislodged from one another somewhat, and they're very fluid. And I think

37:41.440 --> 37:48.080
 that's why a lot of solutions come to people after sleep and naps. And this could even take us into

37:48.080 --> 37:53.840
 a discussion, if you like, about psychedelics. And what we now know, for instance, that people

37:53.840 --> 37:59.520
 thought that psychedelics work by just creating spontaneous bursting of neurons and hallucinations,

37:59.520 --> 38:06.640
 but that the 5H2C and 2A receptors, which are the main sites for things like LSD and

38:06.640 --> 38:12.640
 psilocybin and some of the other ones that create hallucinations, the drugs that create hallucinations,

38:12.640 --> 38:20.080
 the most of those receptors are actually in the collection of neurons that encase the thalamus,

38:20.080 --> 38:23.760
 which is where all the sensory information goes into, a structure called the thalamic

38:23.760 --> 38:30.640
 reticular nucleus. And it's an inhibitory structure that makes sure that when we're

38:30.640 --> 38:35.920
 sitting here talking, that I'm mainly focused on whatever I'm seeing visually, that I'm

38:35.920 --> 38:40.320
 essentially eliminating a lot of sensory information under conditions where people take

38:40.320 --> 38:46.640
 psychedelics and these particular serotonin receptors are activated, that inhibitory shell,

38:46.640 --> 38:52.240
 it's literally shaped like a shell, starts losing its ability to inhibit the passage of

38:52.240 --> 38:58.320
 sensory information. But mostly, the effects of psychedelics are because the lateral connectivity

38:58.320 --> 39:06.000
 in layer five of cortex across cortical areas is increased. And what that does is that means

39:06.000 --> 39:11.040
 that the spacetime relationship for vision, like moving my finger from here to here, a very rigid

39:11.040 --> 39:14.800
 spacetime relationship, if I slow it down, it's slower, obviously, but there's a prediction

39:14.800 --> 39:18.560
 that can be made based on the neurons in the retina and the cortex. On psychedelics, this

39:18.560 --> 39:23.760
 could be very strange experience. But the auditory system has one that's slightly different

39:24.560 --> 39:28.560
 spacetime and they're matched to one another in deeper circuits in the brain. The olfactory

39:28.560 --> 39:35.440
 system has a different spacetime relationship to it. So under conditions of these

39:35.440 --> 39:41.760
 increased activation of these serotonin receptors, spacetime across sensory area starts

39:41.760 --> 39:46.560
 being fluid. So I'm no longer running the algorithm from moving my finger from here to here and

39:46.560 --> 39:52.480
 making a prediction based on vision alone. I'm now, this is where people talk about hearing

39:53.520 --> 39:59.120
 sites, right? You start linking, this might actually make a sound in a psychedelic state.

39:59.120 --> 40:02.480
 Now, I'm not suggesting people run out and do psychedelics because it's very disorganized.

40:02.480 --> 40:07.200
 But essentially what you're doing is you're mixing the algorithms. And so when you talk about being

40:07.200 --> 40:11.680
 able to access new solutions, you don't need to rely on psychedelics. If people choose to do that,

40:11.680 --> 40:17.760
 that's their business. But in drowsy states, this lateral connectivity is increased as well.

40:17.760 --> 40:25.600
 The shell of the thalamus shuts down. And what's happening is you're getting whole

40:25.600 --> 40:31.600
 brain activation at a level that you start mixing algorithms. And so sometimes I think

40:31.600 --> 40:37.920
 solutions come not from being in that narrow tunnel of spacetime and strong activation of

40:37.920 --> 40:42.800
 working memory and trying to iterate if this, then that's very strong, deductive and inductive

40:42.800 --> 40:49.280
 thinking and working from first principles, but also from states where something that was

40:49.280 --> 40:54.560
 an algorithm that you never had in existence before suddenly gets lumped with another algorithm.

40:54.560 --> 41:02.800
 And all of a sudden, a new possibility comes to mind. And so space and time need to be fluid and

41:02.800 --> 41:07.840
 space and time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful. And I realize I'm

41:07.840 --> 41:11.760
 riffing long on this. But this is why I think there was so much interest a few years ago with

41:11.760 --> 41:17.600
 Michael Pollan's book and other things happening about psychedelics as a pathway to exploration

41:17.600 --> 41:21.920
 and all this kind of thing. But the real question is what you export back from those experiences.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.640
 Because dreams are amazing. But if you can't bring anything back from them, they're just amazing.

41:27.200 --> 41:34.800
 I wonder how to experiment with a mind without any medical assistance first.

41:36.480 --> 41:41.840
 I pushed my mind in all kinds of directions. I definitely want to, I did shrooms a couple of

41:41.840 --> 41:52.000
 times. I definitely want to figure out how I can experiment with psychedelics. I'm talking to Rick

41:52.000 --> 41:58.080
 Dobin, I think. Doblin. Doblin. Soon. I went back and forth. So he does all these studies on

41:58.080 --> 42:03.680
 psychedelics. And he keeps ignoring the parts of my email that asks, like, how do I participate in

42:03.680 --> 42:07.360
 these studies? There are some legality issues. I mean, conversation, I want to be very clear.

42:07.360 --> 42:11.600
 I'm not saying that anyone should run out and do psychedelics. I think that drowsy states and

42:11.600 --> 42:16.640
 sleep states are super interesting for accessing some of these more creative states of mind.

42:16.640 --> 42:20.800
 Hypnosis is something that my colleague David Spiegel, Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford,

42:20.800 --> 42:26.720
 works on. Where also, again, it's a unique state because you have narrow context. So this is very

42:27.360 --> 42:34.240
 kind of tunnel vision and yet deeply relaxed where new algorithms, if you will, can start to surface.

42:34.240 --> 42:42.640
 Strong state for inducing neuroplasticity. And I think, so if I had a, I'm part of a group

42:44.240 --> 42:48.080
 that it's called the liminal collective as a group of people that get together and talk about

42:49.200 --> 42:54.720
 just wild ideas, but they try and implement. And it's a really interesting group, some people from

42:55.280 --> 43:00.880
 military, from Logitech and some other backgrounds, academic backgrounds. And I was asked, what would

43:00.880 --> 43:06.400
 be if you could create a tool, if you just had a tool like your magic wand wish for the day,

43:06.400 --> 43:11.920
 what would it be? I thought it'd be really interesting if someone could develop psychedelics

43:11.920 --> 43:20.960
 that have on off switches. So you could go into a psychedelic state very deeply for 10 minutes,

43:20.960 --> 43:25.920
 but you could launch yourself out of that state and place yourself into a linear real world state

43:25.920 --> 43:30.720
 very quickly so that you could extract whatever it was that happened in that experience and then go

43:30.720 --> 43:37.120
 back in if you wanted. Because the problem with psychedelic states and dream states is that,

43:37.120 --> 43:42.080
 first of all, a lot of the reason people do them is they're lying. They say they want plasticity

43:42.080 --> 43:47.760
 and they want all this stuff. They want a peak experience inside of an amplified experience.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.680
 So they're kind of seeking something unusual. I think we should just be honest about that

43:51.680 --> 43:54.560
 because a lot of times they're not trying to make their brain better. They're just trying to

43:54.560 --> 44:01.360
 experience something really amazing. But the problem is space and time are so unlocked

44:02.000 --> 44:06.480
 in these states, just like they are in dreams, that you can really end up with a whole lot of

44:06.480 --> 44:12.400
 nothing. You can have an amazing amplified experience housed in an amplified experience

44:12.400 --> 44:18.800
 and come out of that thinking you had a meaningful experience when you didn't bring anything back.

44:18.800 --> 44:24.640
 You didn't bring anything back. All you have is a fuzzy memory of having a transformational

44:24.640 --> 44:32.320
 experience. But you don't actually have tools to bring back or actually concrete ideas to bring

44:32.320 --> 44:39.040
 back. Yeah, it's interesting. I wonder if it's possible to do that with the mind to be able to

44:39.040 --> 44:45.360
 hop back and forth. I think that's where the real power of adjusting states is going to be.

44:45.360 --> 44:50.000
 It probably will be with devices. I mean, maybe it'll be done through pharmacology. It's just that

44:50.000 --> 44:54.320
 it's hard to do on off switches in human pharmacology, that we have them for animals.

44:54.320 --> 45:01.360
 I mean, we have Cree flip recombinases and we have channelopsins and haloridopsins and

45:02.080 --> 45:07.200
 all these kinds of things. But to do that work in humans is tricky. But I think you could do it

45:07.200 --> 45:12.400
 with virtual reality, augmented reality, and other devices that bring more of the somatic

45:12.400 --> 45:19.280
 experience into it. You're, of course, a scientist who's studying humans as a collective. I tend to

45:19.280 --> 45:27.920
 be just a one person scientist of just looking at myself. When these deep thinking, deep work

45:27.920 --> 45:34.880
 sessions, I'm very cognizant in the morning that there's times when my mind is so

45:34.880 --> 45:43.280
 eloquent at being able to jump around for ideas and hold them all together. I'm almost like,

45:43.280 --> 45:50.160
 I step back from a third person perspective and enjoy that whatever that mind is doing. I do not

45:50.160 --> 45:59.600
 waste those moments. I'm very conscious of this little creature that woke up that's only awake

45:59.600 --> 46:05.440
 for, if we're being honest, maybe a couple hours a day. Early part of the day for you. Early part

46:05.440 --> 46:12.240
 of the day. Not always. Early part of the day for me is a very fluid concept. You're one of those.

46:12.240 --> 46:17.840
 Yeah, you're one of those. Being single, one of the problems. Single and no meetings. I don't

46:17.840 --> 46:26.720
 schedule any meetings. I've been living on like a 28 hour day. So I like, it drifts. So it's all

46:26.720 --> 46:35.600
 over the place. But after a traditionally defined full night's sleep, whatever the heck that means,

46:35.600 --> 46:40.480
 I find that like in those moments, there's a clarity of mind that's just,

46:42.000 --> 46:49.840
 everything is effortless. And it's the deepest dives intellectually that I make. And I'm cognizant

46:49.840 --> 46:55.600
 of it. And I try to bring that to the other parts of the day that don't have it and treasure them

46:55.600 --> 47:00.640
 even more in those moments, because they only last like five or 10 minutes. Because of course,

47:00.640 --> 47:05.120
 in those moments, you want to do all kinds of stupid stuff that are completely is worthless,

47:05.120 --> 47:12.000
 like Czech social media or something like that. But those are the most precious things in intellectual

47:12.000 --> 47:18.480
 life is those mental moments of clarity. And I wonder, I'm learning how to control them.

47:19.760 --> 47:22.080
 I think caffeine is somehow involved. I'm not sure exactly.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.120
 Sure. Well, because if you learn how to titrate caffeine,

47:25.760 --> 47:29.680
 everyone's slightly different with this, what they need. But if you learn to titrate caffeine with

47:29.680 --> 47:33.040
 time of day and the kind of work that you're trying to do, you can bring that autonomic

47:33.040 --> 47:38.000
 arousal state into the close to perfect place. And then you can tune it in with,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.120
 you know, sometimes people want a little bit of background music, sometimes they want less,

47:41.120 --> 47:45.920
 these kinds of things. The early part of the day is interesting because the one thing that's not

47:45.920 --> 47:51.680
 often discussed is this transition out of sleep. So there's a book, I think it's called Winston

47:51.680 --> 47:57.520
 Churchill's nap. And it's about naps and the transition between wake and sleep as a valuable

47:57.520 --> 48:05.360
 period. I've a long time ago, someone who I respect a lot was mentoring me said,

48:05.920 --> 48:12.000
 be very careful about bringing in someone else's sensory experience early in the day.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.760
 So when I wake up, I'm very drowsy. I sleep well, but I don't emerge from that very quickly. I need

48:17.760 --> 48:24.320
 a lot of caffeine to wake up and whatnot. But there's this concept of getting the download from

48:24.320 --> 48:29.520
 sleep, which is, you know, in sleep, you were essentially expunging the things that you don't

48:29.520 --> 48:35.040
 need, the stuff that was meaningless from the previous day. But you were also running variations

48:35.040 --> 48:39.200
 on these algorithms of whatever it is you're trying to work out in life on short timescales,

48:39.200 --> 48:44.880
 like the previous day and long timescales, like your whole life. And those lateral connections

48:44.880 --> 48:53.120
 in layer five of the neocortex are very robustly active and cross sensory areas. And you're running

48:53.120 --> 48:58.320
 an algorithm or a brain, it's a brain state that will be useless in waking. You wouldn't get anything

48:58.320 --> 49:01.840
 done. You'd be the person talking to yourself in the hallway or something about something that

49:01.840 --> 49:08.400
 no one else can see. But in those states, you do that the theory is that you arrive at certain

49:08.400 --> 49:13.280
 solutions. And those solutions will reveal themselves in the early part of the day, unless

49:13.280 --> 49:18.480
 you interfere with them by bringing in social media is a good example of you immediately enter

49:18.480 --> 49:24.320
 somebody else's space time sensory relationship, someone is the conductor of your thoughts in

49:24.320 --> 49:30.000
 that case. And so many people have written about this, what I'm saying isn't entirely new, but

49:30.000 --> 49:36.560
 allowing the download to occur in the early part of the day. And asking the question,

49:36.560 --> 49:42.400
 am I more in my head or am I in more of an interoceptive or exteroceptive mode? And

49:42.400 --> 49:47.360
 depending on the kind of work you need to do, if it sounds like for you, it's very interoceptive

49:47.360 --> 49:53.200
 and very got a lot of thinking going on and a lot of computing going on, allowing yourself to

49:53.200 --> 49:58.320
 transition out of that sleep state and arrive with those solutions from sleep and plug into the work

49:58.320 --> 50:04.320
 really deeply. And then and only then allowing things like music, news, social media doesn't

50:04.320 --> 50:07.760
 mean you shouldn't talk to loved ones and see faces and things like that. But some people have

50:07.760 --> 50:12.240
 taken this to the extreme. When I was a graduate student at Berkeley, there was a guy there

50:12.240 --> 50:20.160
 was a professor is brilliant, odd, but brilliant, who was so fixated on this concept that he wouldn't

50:20.160 --> 50:25.920
 look at faces in the early part of the day, because he just didn't want to anything else to

50:25.920 --> 50:32.400
 impact him. Now he would didn't have the most rounded life, I suppose. But if you're talking

50:32.400 --> 50:37.440
 about cognitive performance, this could actually be very beneficial. You said so many brilliant

50:37.440 --> 50:46.320
 things. So one, if you read books that describe the habits of brilliant people like writers,

50:46.960 --> 50:53.680
 they do control that sensory experience in the in the hours after wake, like many writers,

50:54.960 --> 50:59.200
 you know, they have a particular habit of several hours early in the morning of actual

50:59.200 --> 51:04.240
 writing, they do don't do anything else for the rest of the day. But they control, they're very

51:04.240 --> 51:09.440
 sensitive to noises and so on. I think they make it very difficult to live with them. I try to,

51:09.440 --> 51:17.120
 I'm definitely like that, like I could, I, I love to control the sensory, how much information

51:17.120 --> 51:21.200
 is coming in. There's something about the peaceful, just everything being peaceful.

51:21.760 --> 51:26.960
 At the same time, and we were talking to a mutual friend of Whitney Cummings, who

51:28.000 --> 51:33.680
 has has a has a mansion, a castle on top of a cliff in the middle of nowhere, she actually

51:33.680 --> 51:41.680
 purchased her own island. She wants silence. She wants to control how much sound is coming in.

51:41.680 --> 51:46.320
 She's very sensitive to sound and environment. Yeah. Beautiful home and environment, but like

51:46.320 --> 51:52.800
 clearly puts a lot of attention into, into details. Yeah. And very creative. Yeah. And that's,

51:52.800 --> 51:59.200
 yeah, that allows for creativity to flourish. I'm also, I don't like, that feels like a slippery

51:59.200 --> 52:08.480
 slope. So I enjoy introducing noises and signals and training my mind to be able to tune them out.

52:09.440 --> 52:13.280
 Because I feel like you can't always control the environment so perfectly because,

52:14.560 --> 52:18.160
 because your mind gets comfortable with that. I think it's a skill that you want to learn to be

52:18.160 --> 52:24.480
 able to shut it off. Like I often go to like back before COVID to a coffee shop. It really

52:24.480 --> 52:30.000
 annoys me when there's sounds and voices and so on. But I feel like I can train my mind to block

52:30.000 --> 52:35.600
 them out. So it's a balance, I think. Yeah. And I think, you know, two things come to mind as

52:35.600 --> 52:41.520
 you're saying this. First of all, yeah, I mean, we're talking about what's best for work is not

52:41.520 --> 52:46.240
 always what's best for, you know, completeness of life. I mean, you know, autism is probably many

52:46.240 --> 52:50.400
 things. Like when you hit autism, just like feet, they're probably 50 ways to get a fever,

52:50.400 --> 52:54.880
 they're probably 50 ways to that the brain can create what looks like autism or what people

52:54.880 --> 53:00.160
 call autism. There's an interesting set of studies that have come out of David Ginty's lab at Harvard

53:00.160 --> 53:07.760
 Med looking at these are mouse mutants where these are models for autism where nothing is

53:07.760 --> 53:14.560
 disrupted in the brain proper and in the central nervous system. But the sensory app, the sensory

53:14.560 --> 53:19.040
 neurons, the ones that innervate the skin and the ears and everything are are hypersensitive.

53:19.040 --> 53:27.200
 And this maps to a mutation in certain forms of human autism. So this means that the overload of

53:27.200 --> 53:31.360
 sensory information and sensory experience that a lot of autistics feel, they're like that they

53:31.360 --> 53:35.040
 can't tolerate things. And then they get the stereotype behaviors, the rocking and the kind

53:35.040 --> 53:40.880
 of the shouting, it, you know, we always thought of that as a brain problem. In some cases, it might

53:40.880 --> 53:46.640
 be. But in many cases, it's because they just can't, they seem to have a, it's like turning the

53:46.640 --> 53:51.520
 volume up on every sense. And so they're overwhelmed. And none of us want to become like that. I think

53:51.520 --> 53:56.320
 it's very hard for them and it's hard for their parents and so forth. So I like the coffee shop

53:56.320 --> 54:03.520
 example because the way I think about trying to build up resilience, you know, physically or

54:03.520 --> 54:07.920
 mentally or otherwise is one of, I guess we could call it limb, I like to call it limbic friction,

54:07.920 --> 54:11.840
 that's not a real scientific term. And I acknowledge that I'm making it up now, because I think it

54:11.840 --> 54:16.080
 captures the concept, which is that, you know, we always hear about resilience, it makes it sound

54:16.080 --> 54:20.320
 like, oh, you know, under stress, where everything's coming at you, you're gonna stay calm. But there's

54:20.320 --> 54:26.800
 another, you know, so limbic, the limbic system wants to pull you in some direction, typically

54:26.800 --> 54:32.800
 in the direction of reflexive behavior. And the prefrontal cortex through top down mechanisms

54:32.800 --> 54:38.400
 has to suppress that and say, no, we're not going to respond to the banging of the coffee cups behind

54:38.400 --> 54:44.080
 me or I'm going to keep focusing. That's pure top down control. So limbic friction is high

54:44.080 --> 54:47.440
 in that environment, you've put yourself into a high limbic friction environment mean that the

54:47.440 --> 54:52.240
 prefrontal cortex has to work really hard. But there's another side to limbic friction too,

54:52.240 --> 54:57.120
 which is when you're very sleepy, there's nothing incoming, it can be completely silent.

54:57.120 --> 55:01.280
 And it's hard to engage and focus because you're drifting off and you're getting sleepy. So their

55:01.280 --> 55:06.160
 limbic friction is high, but for the opposite reason autonomic arousal is too low. So they're

55:06.160 --> 55:11.440
 turning on Netflix in the background or looping a song might boost your level of alertness that

55:11.440 --> 55:18.240
 will allow top down control to be in the play exactly the sweet spot you want it. So this is

55:18.240 --> 55:22.560
 why earlier I was saying it's all about how we feel inside relative to what's going on on the

55:22.560 --> 55:29.600
 outside. We're constantly in this, I guess one way you could envision it spatially, especially if

55:29.600 --> 55:34.560
 people are listening to this just an audio is I like to think about it kind of like a glass barbell

55:35.200 --> 55:41.040
 where one sphere of perception and attention can be on what's going on with me and one sphere of

55:41.040 --> 55:45.920
 attention can be on what's going on with you or something else in the room or in my environment.

55:45.920 --> 55:50.560
 But this barbell isn't rigid, it's not really glass. Would plasma work here? I don't know

55:50.560 --> 55:57.600
 anything about plasma. Sorry, I don't know. Okay. So imagine that this thing can contort the size

55:57.600 --> 56:02.640
 of the globes at the end of this barbell can get bigger or smaller. So let's say I close my eyes

56:02.640 --> 56:08.640
 and I bring all my experience into what's going on through interoception internally.

56:08.640 --> 56:14.000
 Now it's as if I've got two orbs of perception just on my internal state, but I can also do the

56:14.000 --> 56:18.240
 opposite and bring to both orbs of perception outside me. I'm not thinking about my heart rate

56:18.240 --> 56:23.120
 or my breathing, I'm just thinking about something I see. And what you'll start to realize as you

56:23.120 --> 56:31.280
 kind of use this spatial model is that two things, one is that it's very dynamic and that the more

56:31.280 --> 56:36.320
 relaxed we are, the more these two orbs of attention, the two ends of the barbell can move

56:36.320 --> 56:42.880
 around freely. The more alert we are, the more rigid they're going to be tethered in place.

56:43.440 --> 56:48.480
 And that was designed so that if I have a threat in my environment, it's tethered to that threat.

56:48.480 --> 56:51.440
 I'm not going to be, if something's coming to attack me, I'm not going to be like, oh,

56:51.440 --> 56:55.760
 my breathing cadence is a little bit quick. That's not how it works. Why? Because both orbs

56:55.760 --> 57:02.640
 are linked to that threat. And so my behavior is now actually being driven by something external,

57:02.640 --> 57:06.400
 even though I think it's internal. And so I don't want to get too abstract here because I'm a

57:06.400 --> 57:11.600
 neuroscientist, I'm not a theorist. But when you start thinking about models of how the brain

57:11.600 --> 57:15.440
 work, I mean, brain works, excuse me, they're only really three things that neurons do. They're

57:15.440 --> 57:22.720
 either sensory neurons, they're motor neurons, or they're modulating things. And the models of

57:22.720 --> 57:29.120
 attention and perception that we have now, 2020, tell us that we've got interoception and extra

57:29.120 --> 57:34.640
 reception. They're strongly modulated by levels of autonomic arousal. And that if we want to form

57:34.640 --> 57:40.800
 the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure or something, whether or not it's sleep

57:40.800 --> 57:47.840
 and impending threat or coding, we need to adjust our internal space time relationship with the

57:47.840 --> 57:52.080
 external space time relationship. And I realize I'm repeating what I said earlier. But we can

57:52.080 --> 57:57.600
 actually assign circuitry to this stuff. It mostly has to do with how much limbic friction there is,

57:57.600 --> 58:02.960
 how much you're being pulled to some source. That source could be internal. If I have pain,

58:02.960 --> 58:07.520
 physical pain in my body, I'm going to be much more interoceptive than I am exteroceptive.

58:07.520 --> 58:10.800
 You could be talking to me and I'm just going to be thinking about that pain. It's very hard.

58:10.800 --> 58:17.840
 And the other thing that we can link it to is top down control, meaning anything in our environment

58:17.840 --> 58:22.880
 that has a lot of salience will tend to bring us into more extra reception than interoception.

58:22.880 --> 58:26.240
 And again, I don't want to litter the conversation with just a bunch of terms. But

58:26.240 --> 58:32.240
 what I think it can be useful for people is to do what essentially you've done, Lex, is to start

58:32.240 --> 58:37.840
 developing an awareness. When I wake up, am I mostly in a mode of interoception or extra

58:37.840 --> 58:44.240
 reception? When I work well, what does working well look like from the perspective of autonomic

58:44.240 --> 58:49.520
 arousal? How alert or calm am I? What kind of balance between internal focus and external

58:49.520 --> 58:53.280
 focus is there? And to sort of watch this process throughout the day.

58:53.280 --> 59:00.320
 Can you just briefly use this term a lot and be nice to try to get a little more color to it,

59:00.320 --> 59:08.880
 which is interoception and extra reception? What are we exactly talking about? What's included

59:08.880 --> 59:15.840
 in each category and how much overlap is there? Interoception would be an awareness of anything

59:15.840 --> 59:20.240
 that's within the confines or on the surface of my skin that I'm sensing.

59:20.240 --> 59:24.480
 So literally physiological. Physiologically, like within the boundaries of my skin

59:24.480 --> 59:30.320
 and probably touch to the skin as well. Extra reception would be perception of anything that's

59:31.600 --> 59:40.800
 beyond the reach of my skin. So that bottle of water, a scent, a sound, although, and this

59:40.800 --> 59:44.320
 can change dramatically, actually, if you have headphones in, you tend to hear things in your

59:44.320 --> 59:46.800
 head as opposed to a speaker in the room. That's interesting, yeah.

59:46.800 --> 59:52.080
 This is actually the basis of ventriloquism. So there are beautiful experiments done by Greg

59:52.080 --> 59:57.440
 Reckon's own up at UC Davis looking at how auditory and visual cues are matched in an array

59:57.440 --> 1:00:03.520
 of speakers. And this will become obvious as I say it, but obviously the ventriloquist doesn't

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:07.920
 throw their voice. What they do is they direct your vision to a particular location and you

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:11.760
 think the sound is coming from that location. And there are beautiful experiments that Greg

1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:15.840
 and his colleagues have done where they suddenly introduce an auditory visual mismatch,

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:21.520
 and it freaks people out because you can actually make it seem from a perception standpoint as if

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:28.000
 the sound arrived from the corner of the room and hit you physically and people will recoil.

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.480
 And so sounds aren't getting thrown across the room. They're still coming from this

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:37.680
 defined location and array of speakers. But this is the way the brain creates these internal

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:43.760
 representations. And again, not to, I don't want to go down a rabbit hole, but I think

1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:49.920
 as much as, I'm sure the listeners appreciate this, but everything in the brain is an abstraction.

1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:57.360
 I mean, the sensory apparatus that are the eyes and ears and nose and skin and taste and all that

1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:03.040
 are taking information and with interoception, taking information from sensors inside the body,

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:08.160
 the enteric nervous system for the gut. I've got sensory neurons that innervate my liver,

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:17.520
 etc., taking all that. And the brain is abstracting that in the same way that if I took a picture

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:21.280
 of your face and I handed it to you and I'd say, that's you, you'd say, yeah, that's me.

1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:26.000
 But if I were an abstract artist, I'd be doing a little bit more of what the brain does,

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.840
 where if I took a pen and pad and paper, maybe I could do this because I'm a terrible artist,

1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:33.680
 and I could just mix it up. And let's say I would make your eyes like water bottles,

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.440
 but I'd flip them upside down and I'd start assigning fruits and objects to the different

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:40.800
 features of your face. And I show it to you, I say, Lex, that's you. Say, well, that's not me.

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:44.160
 And I'd say, no, but that's my abstraction of you. But that's what the brain does.

1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:50.080
 The space time relationship of the neurons that fire that encode your face has have no resemblance

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:55.520
 to your face. Right. And I think people don't really, I don't know if people have fully internalized

1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:00.880
 that. But the day that I, and I'm not sure I fully internalized that, because it's weird to think

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:06.480
 about, but all neurons can do is fire in space and in time, different neurons in different

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:10.960
 sequences, perhaps with different intensities. It's not clear the action potential is all or none,

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:14.960
 although neuroscientists don't like to talk about that, even though it's been published in nature

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:18.800
 a couple of times. The action potential for a given neuron doesn't always have the exact same

1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:23.040
 waveform. People, it's in all the textbooks, but you can modify that waveform.

1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:29.680
 I mean, there's a lot of fascinating stuff with neuroscience about the fuzziness of all the,

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:36.320
 of the transfer of information from neuron to neuron. I mean, we certainly touch upon it

1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:40.640
 every time we at all try to think about the difference between artificial neural networks and

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:46.400
 biological neural networks. But can we maybe linger a little bit on this, on the circuitry

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:53.360
 that you're getting at. So the brain is just a bunch of stuff firing and it forms abstractions

1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:57.280
 that are fascinating and beautiful, like layers upon layers upon layers of abstraction.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.560
 And I think it just like when you're programming, you know, on programming in Python,

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:09.280
 it's awe inspiring to think that underneath it all, it ends up being zeros and ones.

1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:15.920
 And the computer doesn't know about no stupid Python or Windows or Linux. It only knows about

1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:24.800
 the zeros and ones in the same way with the brain. Is there something interesting to you

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:30.240
 or fundamental to you about the circuitry of the brain that allows for the magic

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:37.520
 that's in our mind to emerge? How much do we understand? I mean, maybe even focusing on the

1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:43.520
 vision system. Is there something specific about the structure of the vision system,

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:50.720
 the circuitry of it that allows for the complexity of the vision system to emerge?

1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:53.600
 Or is it all just a complete chaotic mess that we don't understand?

1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:58.160
 It's definitely not all a chaotic mess that we don't understand if we're talking about vision.

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:01.280
 And that's not just because I'm a vision scientist.

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:02.080
 Let's stick to vision.

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.440
 Let's stick to vision. Well, because in the beauty of the visual system,

1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:09.600
 the reason David Hubel and Tornton Weasel on the Nobel Prize was because they were

1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:12.480
 brilliant and forward thinking and adventurous and all that good stuff.

1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:16.320
 But the reason that the visual system is such a great model for addressing these kinds of

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:22.240
 questions and other systems are hard is we can control the stimuli. We can adjust spatial frequency,

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:26.720
 how finer the gratings are, thick gratings, thin gratings, we can adjust temporal frequency,

1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:30.720
 how fast things are moving. We can use coenisolating stimuli.

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:34.640
 We can use it. There's so many things that you can do in a controlled way,

1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:40.400
 whereas if we're talking about cognitive encoding, encoding the space of concepts or

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:48.960
 something, I like you, if I may, am drawn to the big questions in neuroscience.

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:54.400
 But I confess, in part because of some good advice I got early in my career,

1:04:54.400 --> 1:05:01.360
 and in part because I'm not perhaps smart enough to go after the really high level stuff,

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:10.640
 I also like to address things that are tractable. And we need to address what we can stand to make

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:16.160
 some ground on at a given time. You can construct brilliant controlled experiments

1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:20.160
 to study, to really literally answer questions about it, yeah.

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:24.960
 Yeah, I mean, I'm happy to have a talk about consciousness, but it's a scary talk, and I

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.920
 think most people don't want to hear what I have to say, which is we can save that for later,

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:32.800
 perhaps, or another day. I mean, it's an interesting question of

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:38.240
 we talk about psychedelics, we can talk about consciousness, we can talk about cognition.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:45.920
 Can experiments in neuroscience be constructed to shed any kind of light on these questions?

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:52.080
 So I mean, it's cool that vision, I mean, to me, vision is probably one of the most beautiful

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:59.040
 things about human beings. Also, from the AI side, computer vision has some of the most

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:05.680
 exciting applications of neural networks is in computer vision. But it feels like that's a

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:10.560
 neighbor of cognition and consciousness. It's just that we maybe haven't come up with experiments

1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:15.040
 to study those yet. Yeah, the visual system is amazing. We're mostly visual animals to navigate

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:22.240
 it, survive humans mainly rely on vision, not smell or something else. But it's a filter for

1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:28.960
 cognition, and it's a strong driver of cognition, maybe just because it came up and then we're

1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:35.040
 moving to higher level concepts. The way the visual system works can be summarized in a few

1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:39.200
 relatively succinct statements, unlike most of what I've said, which has not been succinct at all.

1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:47.200
 Let's go there. The retina. Yeah, so the retina is this three layers of neuron structure at the

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:52.720
 back of your eyes, but I think it's a credit card. It is a piece of your brain. And sometimes people

1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:58.080
 think I'm kind of wriggling out of reality by saying that it's absolutely a piece of the brain.

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:01.920
 It's a four brain structure that in the first trimester, there's a genetic program

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.360
 that made sure that that neural retina, which is part of your central nervous system,

1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:12.800
 was squeezed out into what's called the embryonic eye cups, and that the bone formed with a little

1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:17.200
 hole where the optic nerve is going to connect it to the rest of the brain. And that window

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:22.560
 into the world is the only window into the world for a mammal, which has a thick skull.

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:27.200
 Birds have a thin skull, so their pineal gland sits and lizards too, and snakes actually have

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:31.840
 a hole so that light can make it down into the pineal directly and in trained melatonin rhythms

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:35.440
 for time of day and time of year. Humans have to do all that through the eyes.

1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:40.320
 So, three layers of neurons that are a piece of your brain, their central nervous system,

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:43.920
 and the optic nerve connects to the rest of the brain. The neurons in the eye,

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:49.280
 some just care about luminance, just how bright or dim it is, and they inform the brain about

1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:53.360
 time of day, and then the central circadian clock informs every cell in your body about time of

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:56.640
 day and make sure that all sorts of good stuff happens if you're getting light in your eyes

1:07:56.640 --> 1:08:01.040
 at the right times, and all sorts of bad things happen if you are getting light randomly throughout

1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:04.960
 the 24 hour cycle. We could talk about all that, but this is a good incentive for keeping

1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:11.840
 a relatively normal schedule, consistent schedule of light exposure. Consistent schedule,

1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:16.880
 try and keep a consistent schedule. When you're young, it's easy to go off schedule and recover.

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:21.920
 As you get older, it gets harder, but you see everything from outcomes in cancer patients to

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:29.920
 diabetes improves when people are getting light at a particular time of day and getting darkness

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:37.120
 at a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle. We were designed to get light and dark at different

1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:43.600
 times of the circadian cycle. All that information is coming in through specialized type of neuron

1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:47.280
 in the retina called the melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cell discovered by

1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:53.840
 David Berson at Brown University. That's not spatial information. It's subconscious. You

1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:57.360
 don't think, oh, it's daytime. Even if you're looking at the sun, it doesn't matter. It's a

1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:02.080
 photon counter. It's literally counting photons. It's saying, oh, even though it's a cloudy day,

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.560
 lots of photons coming in at winter in Boston, it must be winter, and your system is a little

1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:10.720
 depressed. It's spring, you feel alert. That's not a coincidence. That's these melanopsin cells

1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:16.720
 signaling the circadian clock. There are a bunch of other neurons in the eye that signal to the

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.280
 brain, and they mainly signal the presence of things that are lighter than background or darker

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:26.560
 than background. A black object would be darker than background, a light object lighter than

1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:33.360
 background. It's looking at pixels. Mainly, they look at circles, and those neurons have

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:37.600
 receptive fields, which not everyone will understand, but those neurons respond best to

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:42.480
 little circles of dark light or little circles of bright light. Little circles of red light versus

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:49.120
 little circles of green light or blue light. It sounds very basic. It's like red, green, blue,

1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:55.600
 and circles brighter or dimmer than what's next to it. That's basically the only information that

1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:01.040
 sent down the optic nerve. When we say information, we can be very precise. I don't mean little bits

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:06.800
 of red traveling down the optic nerve. I mean spikes, neural action potentials in space and time,

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:12.960
 which for you makes total sense, but I think for a lot of people, it's actually beautiful to think

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:18.240
 about all that information in the outside world is converted into a language that's very simple.

1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:23.840
 It's just a few syllables, if you will. Those syllables are being shouted down the optic

1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:28.320
 nerve converted into a totally different language like Morse code. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:31.440
 Goes into the brain, and then the thalamus essentially responds in the same way that the

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:37.680
 retina does, except the thalamus is also weighting things. It's saying, you know what,

1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:43.840
 that thing was moving faster than everything else, or it's brighter than everything else,

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:51.840
 so that signal I'm going to allow up to cortex. Or that signal is much redder than it is green,

1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:56.640
 so I'm going to let that signal go through that signal as much. It's kind of more like the red

1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:01.120
 next to it. Throw that out. The information just doesn't get up into your cortex. And then in cortex,

1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:05.600
 of course, is where perceptions happen. And in V1, if you will, visual area one,

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:12.240
 but also some neighboring areas, you start getting representations of things like oriented lines. So

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:18.800
 there's a neuron that responds to this angle of my hand versus vertical. This is the defining work

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:24.400
 of Hubel and Wiesel's Nobel. And it's a very systematic map of orientation, line orientation,

1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:30.080
 direction of movement, and so forth. And that's pretty much end color. And that's how the visual

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:35.520
 system is organized all the way up to the cortex. So it's hierarchical. You don't build, I want to

1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:39.360
 be clear, it's hierarchical because you don't build up that line by suddenly having a neuron that

1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:45.120
 responds to lines in some random way. It responds to lines by taking all the dots that are aligned

1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:50.480
 in a vertical stack, and they all converge on one neuron. And then that neuron responds to vertical

1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:56.560
 lines. So it's not random. There's no abstraction at that point, in fact. In fact, if I showed you

1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:02.160
 a black line, I could be sure that if I were imaging V1, that I would see a representation

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:08.640
 of that black line as a vertical line somewhere in your cortex. So at that point, it's absolutely

1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:15.840
 concrete. It's not abstract. But then things get really mysterious. Some of that information travels

1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:20.880
 further up into the cortex and goes from one visual area to the next, to the next, to the next,

1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:27.280
 so that by time you get into an area that Nancy Kenwisher at MIT has studied much of her career,

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:35.600
 the fusiform face area, you start finding single neurons that respond only to your father's face

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:41.760
 or to Joe Rogan's face, regardless of the orientation of his face. I'm sure if you saw Joe,

1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:45.360
 because you know him well, from across the room and you just saw his profile, you'd be like,

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:50.800
 oh, that's Joe. Walk over and say hello. The orientation of his face isn't there. You wouldn't

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:57.040
 even see his eyes necessarily. But he's represented in some abstract way by a neuron that actually

1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:01.440
 would be called the Joe Rogan neuron or collection neurons. You might have limits. I might not

1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:06.000
 recognize him if he was upside down or something like that. It'd be fascinating to see what the

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.720
 limits of that Joe Rogan concept is. So Nancy's lab has done that because early on,

1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:15.600
 she was challenged by people that said there aren't face neurons. There are neurons that

1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:20.000
 they only respond to space and time, shapes and things like that, moving in particular

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.880
 directions and orientations. And it turns out Nancy was right. They used these stimuli

1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:29.360
 called greeble stimuli, which any computer programmer would appreciate, which kind of morphs

1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:34.160
 a face into something gradually that eventually just looks like this alien thing they call the

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:40.240
 greeble. And the neurons don't respond to greebles. In most cases, they only respond to faces and

1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:44.240
 familiar faces. Anyway, I'm summarizing a lot of literature and forgive me, Nancy, and for those

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:48.800
 of the greeble people, if there are anything like, don't come after me with pitchforks. Actually,

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:52.080
 you know what? Come after me with pitchforks. I think you know what I'm trying to do here.

1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:58.000
 So the point is that in the visual system, it's very concrete up until about visual area four,

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:04.640
 which has color pinwheels and seems to respond to pinwheels of colors. And so the stimuli become

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:10.480
 more and more elaborate. But at some point, you depart that concrete representation and you start

1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:15.040
 getting abstract representations that can't be explained by simple point to point wiring.

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:19.600
 And to take a leap out of the visual system to the higher level concepts,

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:24.960
 what we talked about in the visual system, maps to the auditory system where you're encoding what

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:31.440
 that frequency of tone sweeps. So this is going to sound weird to do, but like a Doppler,

1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:36.960
 like hearing something, car passing by, for instance. But at some point, you get into motifs

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:43.680
 of music that can't be mapped to just what they call a tonotopic map of frequency. You start

1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:49.840
 abstracting. And if you start thinking about concepts of creativity and love and memory,

1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:55.680
 like what is the map of memory space? Well, your memories are very different than mine,

1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:00.240
 but presumably there's enough structure at the early stages of memory processing,

1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.920
 or at the early stages of emotional processing, or at the earlier stages of creative processing

1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:09.920
 that you have the building blocks, your zeros and ones, if you will,

1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:16.960
 but you depart from that eventually. Now, the exception to this, and I want to be really clear

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:22.080
 because I was just mainly talking about neocortex, the six layered structure on the outside of the

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:28.480
 brain that explains a lot of human abilities, other animals have them too, is that subcortical

1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:35.280
 structures are a lot more like machines. It's more plung and chug. And what I'm talking about

1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:41.360
 is the machinery that controls heart rate and breathing and receptive fields, neurons that

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:48.480
 respond to things like temperature on the top of my left hand. And I came into neuroscience from

1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:54.320
 the more of a perspective initially of psychology, but one of the reasons I forced upon myself to

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:59.920
 learn some electrophysiology, not a ton, but enough. And some molecular biology and about

1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:05.360
 circuitry is that one of the most beautiful experiences you can have in life, I'm convinced,

1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:11.760
 is to lower an electrode into the cortex and to show a person or an animal,

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:18.480
 you do this ethically, of course, stimulus, like an oriented line or a face. And you can

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:23.120
 convert the recordings coming off of that electrode into an audio signal, an audio monitor,

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:27.840
 and you can hear what they call hash. It's not the hash you smoke, it's the hash you hear,

1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:36.480
 and it sounds like noise. And in the cortex, eventually you find a stimulus that gets the

1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:41.040
 neuron to spike in fire action potentials that convert it into an auditory stimulus

1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:46.240
 that are very concrete. Crack, crack, crack sounds like a bat cracking, like home runs

1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:54.480
 or outfield balls. When you drop electrodes deeper into the thalamus or into the hypothalamus

1:16:54.480 --> 1:16:59.200
 or into the brainstem areas that control breathing, it's like a machine. You never hear

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:05.680
 hash. You drop the electrode down. This could be like a grungy old Tuggestin electrode,

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:09.040
 not high fidelity electrode, as long as it's got a little bit of insulation on it. You plug

1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.520
 it into an audio monitor, it's picking up electricity. And if it's a visual neuron and

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:18.560
 it's in the thalamus or the retina and you walk in front of that animal or person, that neuron goes

1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:25.280
 crack, and then you walk away and it stops. And you put your hand in front of the eye again and

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:31.280
 it goes crack, and you could do that for two days. And that neuron will just, every time

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:35.760
 there's a stimulus, it fires. So whereas before, it's a question of how much information is getting

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:40.480
 up to cortex. And then these abstractions happening where you're creating these ideas,

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:46.800
 when you go subcortical, everything is... There's no abstractions. It's two plus two equals four.

1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:51.920
 There's no abstractions. And this is why I know we have some common friends at Neural Link.

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:56.000
 And I love the demonstration they did recently. I'm a huge fan of what they're doing and where

1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:01.040
 they're headed. And no, I don't get paid to say that. And I have no business relationship to them.

1:18:01.040 --> 1:18:05.920
 I'm just a huge fan of the people in the mission. But my question was to some of them,

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:10.720
 when are you going to go subcortical? Because if you want to control an animal,

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:15.280
 you don't do it in the cortex. The cortex is like the abstract painting I made of your face.

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:21.440
 Removing one piece or changing something may or may not matter for the abstraction. But when

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:27.760
 you are in the subcortical areas of the brain, a stimulating electro can evoke an entire behavior

1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:32.400
 or an entire state. And so the brain, if we're going to have a discussion about the brain and how

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:38.880
 the brain works, we need to really be clear which brain. Because everyone loves neocortex.

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:43.280
 It's like, oh, canonical circuits in cortex, we can get the cortical connectome. And sure,

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:49.360
 necessary, but not sufficient. Not to be able to plug in patterns of electrical stimulation

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:54.160
 and get behavior. Eventually we'll get there. But if you're talking subcortical circuits,

1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:58.000
 that's where the action is. That's where you could potentially cure Parkinson's by stimulating

1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:03.680
 the subthalamic nucleus. Because we know that it gates motor activation patterns in very predictable

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:08.720
 ways. So I think for those that are interested in neuroscience, it pays to pay attention to,

1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:14.720
 like, is this a circuit that abstracts the sensory information? Or is it just one that builds up

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:20.560
 hierarchical models in a very predictable way? And there's a huge chasm in neuroscience right

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:26.880
 now because there's no conceptual leadership. No one knows which way to go. And this is why I think

1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:31.120
 Neuralink has captured an amazing opportunity, which was, okay, well, while all you academic

1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:35.520
 research labs are figuring all this stuff out, we're going to pick a very specific goal and make

1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:40.800
 the goal the endpoint. And some academic laboratories do that. But I think that's a beautiful way to

1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:46.400
 attack this whole thing about the brain because it's very concrete. Let's restore motion to the

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.520
 Parkinsonian patient. Academic labs want to do that too, of course. Let's restore

1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:57.920
 speech to the stroke patient. But there's nothing abstract about that. That's about

1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:02.640
 figuring out the solution to a particular problem. So anyway, those are my, and I admit I've mixed

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:08.080
 in a lot of opinion there. But having spent some time, like 25 years digging around in the brain

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:13.440
 and listening to neurons firing and looking at them anatomically, I think, given it's 2020,

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:18.560
 we need to ask the right, you know, the way to get better answers, ask better questions. And

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:27.040
 the really high level stuff is fun. It makes for good conversation. And it has brought enormous

1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:30.960
 interest. But I think the questions about consciousness and dreaming and stuff, they're

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:34.320
 fascinating. But I don't know that we're there yet.

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:37.440
 So you're saying there might be a chasm in the two views

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:50.240
 of the power of the brain arising from the circuitry that forms abstractions or the power of

1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:58.080
 the brain arising from the majority of the circuitry that's just doing very brute force

1:20:58.080 --> 1:21:05.120
 dumb things that don't have any fancy kind of stuff going on. That's really interesting to think

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:11.520
 about. And which one to go after first? And here I'm poaching badly from someone I've never met,

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:16.400
 but whose work I follow, which is, and it was actually on your podcast, I think Elon Musk

1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:21.120
 said, you know, basically the brain is a monkey brain with a supercomputer on top.

1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:24.880
 And I thought that's actually probably the best description of the brain I've ever heard,

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:29.920
 because it captures a lot of important features like limbic friction, right? But we think of like,

1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:33.680
 oh, you know, when we're making plans, we're using the prefrontal cortex and we're

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:37.520
 executive function and all this kind of stuff. But think about the drug addict,

1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:43.920
 who's driven to go pursue heroin or cocaine, they make plans. So clearly they use their

1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:48.640
 frontal cortex, it's just that it's been hijacked by the limbic system and all the monkey brain

1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:52.480
 as you refer to. It's really not fair to monkeys though, Elon, because actually monkeys can make

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:56.400
 plans. They just don't make plans as sophisticated as us. I've spent a lot of time with monkeys,

1:21:56.400 --> 1:22:00.000
 but I've also spent a lot of time with humans. Anyway, I'm you're putting you're saying like,

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.000
 which there's a lot of value to focusing on the monkey brain or whatever the heck you call it.

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:10.640
 I do because let's say I had an ability to place a chip anywhere I wanted in the brain today,

1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:15.520
 and activate it or inhibit that area. I'm not sure I would put that chip in neocortex,

1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:19.920
 except maybe to just kind of have some fun and see what happens. The reason is it's an

1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:25.360
 abstraction machine. And especially if I wanted to make a mass production tool, a tool in mass

1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:29.440
 production that I could give to a lot of people, because it's quite possible that your abstractions

1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:34.720
 are different enough than mine, that I wouldn't know what patterns of firing to induce. But if I

1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:40.880
 want, let's say I want to increase my level of focus and creativity, well, then I would love to

1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:46.240
 be able to, for instance, control my level of limbic friction. I would love to be able to wake up

1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:50.080
 and go, oh, you know, I have an eight o clock appointment, I wake up slowly. So between seven,

1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:53.760
 eight, but I want to do a lot of linear thinking. So you know what, I'm going to just, I'm going to

1:22:53.760 --> 1:23:00.960
 turn down the limbic friction and or ramp up prefrontal cortex is activation. So there's a

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:05.680
 lot of stuff that can happen in the thalamus with sensory gating. For instance, you could shut down

1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:10.400
 that shell around the thalamus and allow more creative thinking by allowing more lateral

1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:14.080
 connections. These would be some of the those would be the experiments I'd want to do. So

1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:18.880
 they're in the subcortical, quote unquote, monkey brain. But you could then look at what

1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:25.520
 sorts of abstract thoughts and behaviors would arise from that, rather than and here I'm not

1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:30.880
 pointing my finger at neural link at all. But there's this obsession with neocortex. But I'm

1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:35.120
 going to, well, I might lose a few friends, but I'll hopefully gain a few. And also,

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:42.560
 one of the reasons people spend so much time in neocortex is I have a fact and an opinion. One

1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:47.600
 fact is that you can image there and you can record there. Right now, the two photon and one

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:52.960
 photon microscopy methods that allow you to image deep into the brain still don't allow you to image

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:57.600
 down really deep unless you're jamming prisms in there and endoscopes. And then the endoscopes

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:01.120
 are very narrow. So you're getting very, you know, it's like looking at the bottom of the ocean

1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:07.200
 through a through a spotlight. And so you much easier look at the waves up on top, right? So

1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:11.280
 let's face it, folks, a lot of the reasons why there's so many recordings in layer two, three of

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:16.400
 cortex with all this advanced microscopy is because it's very hard to image deeper. Now,

1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:21.120
 the microscopes are getting better. And thanks to the amazing work mainly of engineers and

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:25.040
 chemists and physicists, let's face it, they're the ones who brought this revolution to neuroscience

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:31.520
 in the last 10 years or so, you can image deeper. But we don't really, that's why you see so many

1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:36.400
 reports on layer two, three. The other thing, which is purely opinion, and I'm not going after

1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:42.640
 anybody here, but is that as long as there's no clear right answer, it becomes a little easier

1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:47.760
 to do creative work in a structure where no one really knows how it works. So it's fun to probe

1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:53.280
 around because anything you see is novel. If you're going to work in the thalamus or the pulvinar or

1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:57.600
 the hypothalamus or these structures they've been known about since the 60s and 70s and really

1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:04.000
 since the centuries ago, you are dealing with exist, you have to combat existing models.

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:10.240
 Yeah. And we're as in cortex, no one knows how the thing works. Neocortex, six layer cortex.

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.720
 And so there's a lot more room for discovery. There's a lot more room for discovery. And I'm

1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:18.240
 not calling anyone out. I love cortex. We've published some papers on cortex. It's super

1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:24.560
 interesting. But I think with the tools that are available nowadays, and where people are trying

1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:29.040
 to head of not just reading from the brain, monitoring activity, but writing to the brain,

1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:34.720
 I think we really have to be careful and we need to be thoughtful about what are we trying to write?

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:38.000
 What script are we trying to write? Because there are many brain structures for which we

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.160
 already know what scripts they write. And I think there's tremendous value there. I don't think it's

1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:47.680
 boring. The fact that they act like machines makes them predictable. Those are your zeros and ones.

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:52.960
 Let's start there. But what's sort of happening in this field of writing to the brain is there's

1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:57.280
 this idea. And again, I want to be clear, I'm not pointing at neural link. I'm mainly pointing at

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:03.840
 the neocortical jockeys out there that you go in, you observe patterns, and then you think replaying

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:09.440
 those patterns is going to give rise to something interesting. I should call out one experiment

1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:15.040
 or two experiments which were done by Sasumoto Nagawa, Nobel Prize winner from MIT, done important

1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:21.680
 work in memory and immunology, of course, as well as Mark Mayford's lab at UC San Diego.

1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.680
 They did an experiment where they monitored a bunch of neurons while an animal learned something.

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:31.280
 Then they captured those neurons through some molecular tricks so they could replay the neurons.

1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:37.680
 So now there's like perfect case scenario. It's like, okay, you monitor the neurons in your brain,

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:41.520
 then I say, okay, neurons one through 100 were played in the particular sequence. So you know

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:44.960
 the space time, you know the keys on the piano that were played that gave rise to the song,

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:49.360
 which was the behavior. And then you go back and you reactivate those neurons, except you

1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:55.600
 reactivate them all at once, like slamming on all the keys once on the piano. And you get the exact

1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:05.760
 same behavior. So the space time code may be meaningless for some structures. Now that's

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:12.800
 freaky. That's a scary thing because what that means is that all the space time firing in cortex,

1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:20.480
 the space part may matter more than the time part. So you know, rate codes and space time codes,

1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:24.880
 we don't know. And you know, I'd rather have more, I'd rather deliver more answers in this

1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:30.080
 discussion questions. But I think it's an important consideration. You're saying some of the magic

1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:36.880
 is in the early stages of what the closer to the raw information. I believe so. I believe so. You

1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:41.840
 know the stimulus, you know, the neuron then codes that stimulus, so you know the transformation.

1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:45.680
 When I say this for those that will think about sensory transformations, it's like,

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:51.680
 I can show you a red circle. And then I look at how many times the neuron fires in response to

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:55.200
 that red circle. And then I could show the red circle a bunch of times, green circle,

1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:59.440
 see if it changes. And then essentially the number of times that is the transformation,

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:03.280
 you've converted red circle into like three action potentials, you know,

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:07.840
 or whatever you want to call it, you know, for those that think in sound space. So

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:11.520
 that's what you've created, you know, the transformation and you march up the, it's

1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:18.160
 called the nerve axis as you go from the periphery up into the cortex. And we know that,

1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:25.280
 and I know Lisa Feldman Barrett, or is it Barrett Feldman? Barrett Feldman, excuse me,

1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:29.520
 Lisa, that talked a lot about this, that, you know, birds can do sophisticated things and

1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:35.120
 whatnot as well. But humans, there's a strong what we call sephalization. A lot of the processing

1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:39.920
 is moved up into the cortex and out of these subcortical areas. But it happens nonetheless.

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:44.640
 And so as long as you know the transformations, you are in a perfect place to build machines

1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:51.920
 or add machines to the brain that exactly mimic what the brain wants to do, which is take events

1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:57.120
 in the environment and turn them into internal firing of neurons. So the mastery of the brain

1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:03.520
 can happen at their early load. You know, another perspective of it is you saying this means that

1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:09.440
 humans aren't that special. If we look at the evolutionary time scale, the leap to intelligence

1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:16.320
 is not that special. So like the extra layers of abstraction isn't where most of the magic

1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:22.640
 happens of intelligence, which gives me hope that maybe if that's true, that means the evolution

1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:30.240
 of intelligence is not that rare of an event. I certainly hope not. I hope there are other

1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:36.240
 forms of intelligence. I mean, I think what humans are really good at, and here I want to

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:41.200
 be clear that this is not a formal model, but what humans are really good at is taking that

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:47.920
 plasma barbell that we were talking about earlier and not just using it for analysis of space,

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:52.720
 like the your media environment, but also using historical information. Like I can read a book

1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:57.200
 today about the history of medicine. I happen to be doing that lately for some stuff I'm researching.

1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:01.120
 And I can take that information. And if I want, I can inject it into my plans for the future.

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:08.880
 Other animals don't seem to do that over the same time scales that we do. Now, it may be that the

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:14.080
 chipmunks are all hiding little notebooks everywhere in the form of little dirt castles or

1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:18.000
 something that we don't understand. I mean, the waggle dance of the bee is in the most famous

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:23.680
 example. Bees come back to the hive, they orient relative to the honeycomb, and they waggle.

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:27.680
 There's a guy down in Australia named Serena Vissan who studied this in it. It's really

1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:34.000
 interesting. No one really understands it except he understands it best. The bee waggles in a couple

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:39.840
 ways relative to the orientation of the honeycomb. And then all the other bees see that it's visual

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:45.360
 and they go out and they know the exact coordinate system to get to the source of whatever was the

1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:49.840
 food and bring it back. And he's done it where they isolate the bees, he's changed the visual

1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:54.160
 flight environment, all this stuff. They are communicating. And they're communicating something

1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:59.760
 about something they saw recently, but it doesn't extend over very long periods of time.

1:30:59.760 --> 1:31:03.920
 The same way that you and I can both read a book or you can recommend something to me and then we

1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:09.600
 could converge on a set of ideas later. And in fairness, because she was the one that said it

1:31:09.600 --> 1:31:15.200
 and I didn't and I hadn't even thought of it, when you talked to Lisa on your podcast, she

1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:20.560
 brought up something beautiful, which is that I never really occurred to me and I was sort of

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:26.480
 embarrassed that it hadn't. But it's really beautiful and brilliant, which is that we don't

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:32.480
 just encode senses in the form of color and light and sound waves and taste, but ideas become a form

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:38.800
 of sensory mapping. And that's where the really, really cool and exciting stuff is, but we just

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:42.880
 don't understand what the receptive fields are for ideas. What's an idea of receptive field?

1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:50.720
 And how they're communicated between humans because we seem to be able to encode those ideas

1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:56.400
 in some kind of way. Yes, it's taking all the raw information and the internal physical states,

1:31:56.400 --> 1:32:02.080
 the that sensory information put into this concept blob that we store and then we're

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:06.080
 able to communicate that. Your abstractions are different than mine. I actually think the

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:11.840
 comment section on social media is a beautiful example of where the abstractions

1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:16.000
 are different for different people. So much of the misunderstanding of the world

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:22.320
 is because of these idea receptive fields. They're not the same. Whereas I can look at

1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:28.320
 a photoreceptor neuron or olfactory neuron or a V1 neuron. And I am certain I would bet my life

1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:34.640
 that yours look and respond exactly the same way that Lisa's do and mine do. But once you get

1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:40.080
 beyond there, it gets tricky. And so when you say something or I say something and somebody gets upset

1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:45.920
 about it or even happy about it, their concept of that might be quite a bit different. They don't

1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:51.680
 really know what you mean. They only know what it means to them. Yeah, so from a neural link

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:57.600
 perspective, it makes sense to optimize the control and the augmentation of the of the more

1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:03.600
 primitive circuitry. So like the stuff that is closer to the raw sensory information.

1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:09.920
 Go deeper if they I think by the way deeper into the brain. And to be fair, so Matt McDougall,

1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:15.040
 who's the neurosurgeon neural link and clinical nurse, a great guy, brilliant. They have amazing

1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.200
 people. I have to give it to them. They have been very cryptic in recent years. Their website was

1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:24.640
 just like a neural like nothing there. They really know how to do things with style and

1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:30.320
 they've upset a lot of people, but that's good too. But Matt is there. I know Matt,

1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:33.840
 he actually came out through my lab at Stanford, although he was a neurosurgery resident. We

1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:37.760
 spent time in our lab. He actually came out on the shark dive and did great white shark diving

1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:43.600
 with my lab to collect the VR that we use in our fear stuff. I've talked to Matt and I think he

1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:49.440
 and other folks that are hungry for the deeper brain structures. The problem is that damn vasculature,

1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:56.000
 all that blood supply. It's not trivial to get through and down into the brain without damaging

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.920
 the vasculature in the neocortex, which is on the outer crust. But once you start getting into

1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:04.560
 the thalamus and closer to some of the main arterial sources, you really risk getting

1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:09.360
 massive bleeds. It's an issue that can be worked out. It just is hard.

1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:16.800
 Maybe it'd be nice to educate. I'm sure of my ignorance. The smart stuff is on the surface.

1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:26.160
 I didn't quite realize because you keep saying deep. The early stages are deep

1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:34.560
 in actual physically in the brain. Of course, you've got your deep brain structures that

1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:37.920
 are involved in breathing and heart rate and kind of lizard brain stuff. And then on top of that,

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:44.080
 this is the model of the brain that no one really subscribes to anymore. But anatomically,

1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:48.000
 it works. And then on top in mammals. And then on top of that, you have the limbic structures,

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:51.600
 which gate sensory information and decide whether or not you're going to listen to

1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:54.400
 something more that you're going to look at it or you're going to split your attention to both.

1:34:54.400 --> 1:35:03.760
 Kind of sensory allocation stuff. And then the neocortex is on the outside. And that is where

1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:07.760
 you get a lot of this abstraction stuff. And now not all cortical areas are doing abstraction,

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:13.280
 some are like visual area one, auditory area one, they're just doing concrete representations.

1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:18.560
 But as you get into the higher order stuff, that when you start hearing names like

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:22.640
 infro, parietal cortex, and when you start hearing multiple names in the same,

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:27.520
 then you're talking about higher order areas. But actually, there's an important experiment

1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:33.280
 that drives a lot of what people want to do with brain machine interface. And that's the work of

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:38.080
 Bill Newsom, who is at Stanford and Tony Moveshin, who runs the Center for Neural Science at NYU.

1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:42.880
 This is a wild experiment. And I think it might freak a few people out if they really think about

1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:50.800
 it too deeply. But anyway, here he goes. There's an area called MT in the cortex. And if I showed

1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:57.120
 you a bunch of dots all moving up, and this is what Tony and Bill and some of the other people

1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.160
 in that lab did way back when, is they show a bunch of dots moving up. Somewhere in MT,

1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.480
 there are some neurons that respond, they fire when the neurons move up. And then what they did

1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:10.400
 is they started varying the coherence of that motion. So they made it so only 50% of the dots

1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:14.800
 moved up and the rest move randomly. And that neuron fires a little less. And eventually,

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:18.480
 it's random and that neuron stops firing because it's just kind of dots moving everywhere.

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:22.320
 It's awesome. And there's a systematic map so that other neurons are responding and

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:25.840
 things moving down and other things are responding left and other things are moving right. Okay.

1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:31.520
 So there's a map of direction space. Okay, well, that's great. You could lesion MT,

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:35.760
 animals lose the ability to do these kind of coherence discrimination or direction

1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:42.480
 discrimination. But the amazing experiment, the one that just is kind of eerie, is that

1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:49.440
 they lowered a stimulating electrode into MT, found a neuron that responds to when dots go up. But

1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:57.280
 then they silenced that neuron. And sure enough, the animal doesn't recognize the neurons are going

1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:04.320
 up. And then they move the dots down. They stimulate the neuron that responds to things

1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:10.560
 moving up. And the animal responds, because it can't speak, it responds by doing a lever

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:15.200
 press, which says the dots are moving up. So in other words, the sensory, the dots are moving

1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:21.440
 down in reality on the computer screen. They're stimulating the neuron that responds to dots

1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:28.160
 moving up. And the perception of the animal is that dots are moving up, which tells you that

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:35.040
 your perception of external reality absolutely has to be a neuronal abstraction. It is not

1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:41.200
 tacked to the movement of the dots in any absolute way. Your perception of the outside world depends

1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:48.320
 entirely on the activation patterns of neurons in the brain. And you can hear that and say, well,

1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:52.880
 duh, because if I stimulate the stretch reflex and you kick or something or whatever,

1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.240
 the knee reflex, and you kick, of course, there's a neuron that triggers that,

1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:00.960
 but it didn't have to be that way. Because A, the animal had prior experience. B,

1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:08.640
 you're way up in this higher order cortical areas. What this means is that, and I generally try to

1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:14.320
 avoid conversations about this kind of thing, but what this means is that we are constructing our

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:20.160
 reality with this space time firing the zeros and ones. And it doesn't have to have anything to do

1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:25.920
 with the actual reality. And the animal or person can be absolutely convinced that that's what's

1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:34.640
 happening. Are you familiar with the work of Donald Hoffman? So he's, so he makes an evolution

1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:45.520
 argument. That's not important. That we, our brains are completely detached from reality,

1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:54.080
 in the sense that he makes a radical case that we have no idea what physical reality is. And in fact,

1:38:54.080 --> 1:39:02.320
 is drastically different than what we think it is. Oh my. So he goes, that's scary. So he doesn't

1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:07.200
 say like there's just, because you're kind of implying there's a, there's a gap. There might,

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:13.200
 there might be a gap. We're constructing an illusion. And then maybe using communication to

1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:20.080
 maybe create a consistency that's sufficient for human collaboration, whatever, or mammal could,

1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:25.840
 you know, just maybe even just life forms are constructing a consistent reality that's maybe

1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:30.320
 detached. I mean, that's really cool that neurons are constructing that, like that you can prove

1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:37.520
 this is when you were science at his best vision science. But he says that like, our brain is actually

1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:45.440
 just lost its shit on the path of evolution to where we're normal. We're just playing games

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:52.880
 with each other in constructing realities that allow our survival. But it's completely detached

1:39:52.880 --> 1:40:01.360
 from physical reality. We're missing a lot. We're missing like most of it, if not all of it.

1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:06.160
 Well, this was, it's fascinating because I just saw the Oliver Sacks documentary,

1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:11.040
 there's a new documentary out about his life. And there's this one part where he's like,

1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:16.960
 I've spent part of my life trying to imagine what it would like to be to be a bat or something to

1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:23.120
 see the world through the life, the sensory apparatus of a bat. And he did this with these

1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:28.400
 patients that were locked into these horrible syndromes that to pull out some of the beauty of

1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:33.360
 their experience as well, not just communicate the suffering, although the suffering too.

1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:36.880
 And as I was listening to him talk about this, I started to realize, it's like,

1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:41.360
 well, what, you know, like they're these mantis shrimps that can see 60 shades of

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:46.080
 pink or something. And they see this stuff all the time and animals, they can see UV light.

1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:51.120
 Every time I learn about an animal that can sense other things in the environment that I

1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:56.400
 can't like heat sensing, why not? I don't crave that experience the same way Sacks talked about

1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:01.920
 craving that experience. But it does throw another penny in the jar for what you're saying, which is

1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:10.720
 that it could be that most, if not all of what I perceive and believe is just a neural fabrication.

1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:15.280
 And that for better or for worse, we all agree on enough of the same neural

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:18.560
 fabrications in the same time and place that we're able to function.

1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:21.600
 Not only that, but we agree with the things that are trying to eat us

1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:29.440
 enough to where we don't, they don't eat us, meaning like that it's not just us humans,

1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:35.520
 you know, I see, because it's interactive, it's interactive. So like, so like, now,

1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:46.000
 I think it's a really nice thought experiment. I think because Donald really frames it in a

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:51.840
 scientific, like he makes a hard, like as hard as our discussion has been now, he makes a hard

1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:58.720
 scientific case that we don't know shit about reality. I think that's a little bit hard core,

1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:05.200
 but I think it's, I think it's our core. But I think it's a good thought experiment

1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:13.520
 that kind of cleanses the palate of the confidence we might have about about because we are operating

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:21.200
 in the subtraction space. And, you know, and, you know, the sensory spaces might be something very

1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:27.200
 different. And it's kind of interesting to think about if you start to go into a realm of neural

1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:31.760
 link or start to talk about just everything that you've been talking about with dream states and

1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:38.240
 psychedelics and stuff like that, which part of the which layer can we control and play around with

1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:45.040
 to maybe look into a different slice of reality? You just got to do the experiment. The key is to

1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:49.280
 just do the experiment in the most ethical way possible. You just, I mean, that's the beauty

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:55.440
 of experiments. This is why, you know, there's, there's wonderful theoretical neuroscience happening

1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.360
 now to make predictions. But that's why experimental science is so wonderful. You can go into the

1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:07.120
 laboratory and poke around in there and be a brain explorer and listen to and write to neurons.

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:11.600
 And when you do that, you get answers. You don't always get the answers you want, but that's,

1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:16.800
 you know, that's the beauty of it. I think when you were saying this thing about reality and the

1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:22.800
 Donald Hoffman model, I was thinking about children, you know, like when I have an older

1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:30.800
 sister, she's very sane. But when she was a kid, she had an imaginary friend. And she played with

1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:35.600
 this imaginary friend. And it had, there was this whole, there was a consistency. This friend was

1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.760
 like, it was Larry lived in a purple house. Larry was a girl. It was like all this stuff that a

1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:44.400
 child, a young child wouldn't have any issue with. And then one day she announced that Larry had

1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:48.800
 died, right? And it wasn't traumatic or traumatic. And that was it. And she just stopped. And I

1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:57.520
 always wonder what that neurodevelopmental event was that a kept her out of a psychiatric ward

1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:03.920
 had she got, you know, kept that imaginary friend. But it's also there was something kind of sad to

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:07.920
 it. I think the way it was told to me because I'm the younger brother, I didn't, I wasn't around

1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:12.160
 for that. But my dad told me that, you know, there was a kind of a sadness because it was this

1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:16.080
 beautiful reality that had been constructed. And so we kind of wonder, I wonder as you're

1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:21.200
 telling me this, whether or not, you know, as adults, we try and create as much reality for

1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:24.960
 children as we can so that they can make predictions and feel safe because the ability to make

1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:29.600
 predictions is a lot of what keeps our autonomic arousal in check. I mean, we go to sleep every

1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:34.400
 night and we give up total control. And that should frighten us deeply. But, you know,

1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:38.960
 unfortunately, autonomic arousal be yanks us down under and we don't negotiate too much.

1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:45.440
 So you sleep sooner or later. I don't know. I was a little worried we get into discussions

1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:49.680
 about the nature of reality because it's interesting. In the laboratory, I'm very much

1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:54.800
 like, what's the experiment? What's the analysis going to look like? What mutant mouse are we going

1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:59.520
 to use? What experience are we going to put someone through? But I think it's wonderful

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:05.200
 that in 2020, we can finally have discussions about this stuff and look kind of peek around

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:11.120
 the corner and say, well, no link. And people, others who are doing similar things,

1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:16.720
 are going to figure it out. The answers will show up and we just have to be open to interpretation.

1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:22.160
 Do you think there could be an experiment centered around consciousness? I mean, you're

1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:27.280
 plugged into the neuroscience community. I think for the longest time, the quote unquote,

1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:33.680
 C word was totally not, was almost anti scientific. But now more and more people are talking about

1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:39.040
 consciousness. Elon is talking about consciousness. AI folks are talking about consciousness.

1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:48.800
 It's still nobody knows anything, but it feels like a legitimate domain of inquiry that's hungry

1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:57.280
 for a real experiment. So I have, fortunately, three short answers to this.

1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:06.240
 The first one is a, I'm not, I'm not particularly succinct. I agree. The joke I always tell is

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:11.520
 there are two things you never want to say to a scientist. One is what do you do? And the second

1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:15.200
 one is take as much time as you need. And you definitely don't want to say them in the same

1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:22.560
 sentence. I have three short answers to it. So there's a, there's a cynical answer kind of,

1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:31.360
 and it's not one I enjoy giving, which is that if you look into the 70s and a back at the 1970s

1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:39.360
 and 1980s, and even into the early 2000s, there were some very dynamic, very impressive speakers

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:44.480
 who are very smart in the field of neuroscience and related fields who thought hard about the

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:52.880
 consciousness problem and fell in love with the problem, but overlooked the fact that the

1:46:52.880 --> 1:47:00.640
 technology wasn't there. So I admire them for falling in love with the problem, but they gleaned

1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:07.440
 tremendous taxpayer resources, essentially for nothing. And these people know who they are,

1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:10.880
 some of them are alive, some of them aren't. I'm not referring to Francis Crick, who was brilliant,

1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:14.000
 by the way, and thought the classroom was involved in consciousness, which I think is a

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:18.080
 great idea. It's this obscure structure that no one's really studied. People are now starting

1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:22.720
 to study it. So I think Francis was brilliant and wonderful. But there it, you know, there were

1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:31.120
 books written about it. It makes for great television stuff and thought around the table

1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:36.960
 or after a couple glasses of wine or whatever. It's an important problem nonetheless. And so I

1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:42.320
 think I do think the consciousness, the issue is it's not operationally defined, right? That

1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:50.000
 psychologists are much smarter than a lot of hard scientists in that for the following reason,

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:55.440
 and they put operational definitions. They know that psychology, if we're talking about motivation,

1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:58.320
 for instance, they know they need to put operational definitions on that so that

1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:02.400
 two laboratories can know they're studying the same thing. The problem with consciousness is

1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:08.240
 no one can agree on what that is. And this was a problem for attention when I was coming up. So

1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:12.160
 in the early 2000s, people would argue, what is attention? Is it spatial attention, auditory

1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:17.680
 attention? And finally, people are like, you know what, we agree. Have they agreed on that one?

1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:22.560
 I remember hearing people scream a lot of attention. Right. They couldn't even agree on

1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:25.920
 attention. So I was coming up as a young graduate student, I'm thinking like,

1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:30.000
 I'm definitely not going to work on attention. And I'm definitely not going to work on consciousness.

1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.120
 And I wanted something that I could solve or figure out. I want to be able to see the circuit

1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:39.200
 or the neurons. I want to be able to hear it on the audio. I want to record from it. And then I

1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:44.160
 want to do gain a function and loss a function, take it away, see something change, put it back,

1:48:44.160 --> 1:48:48.720
 see something change a systematic way. And that takes you down into the depths of some stuff

1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:55.280
 that's pretty plug and chug. But I'll borrow from something in the military because I'm

1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:59.280
 fortunate to do some work with units from special operations and they have beautiful language

1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.600
 around things because their world is not abstract. And they talk about three meter targets,

1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:08.080
 10 meter targets and 100 meter targets. And it's not an issue of picking the 100 meter target

1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:11.680
 because it's more beautiful or because it's more interesting. If you don't take down the

1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:18.480
 three meter targets and the 10 meter targets first, you're dead. So I think scientists could pay to

1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:25.520
 adopt a more kind of military thinking in that sense. The other thing that is really

1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:30.160
 important is that just because somebody conceived of something and can talk about it beautifully

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:36.400
 and can glean a lot of resources for it, doesn't mean that it's led anywhere. So this isn't just

1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:41.040
 true of the consciousness issue. And I don't want to sound cynical, but I could pull up some names

1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:47.920
 of molecules that occupied hundreds of articles in the very premier journals that then were later

1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:54.320
 discovered to be totally moot for that process. And biotech companies folded everyone and the

1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:58.880
 lab pivots and starts doing something different with that molecule. And nobody talks about it

1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:02.960
 because as long as you're in the game, we have this thing called anonymous peer review. You

1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:08.560
 can't afford to piss off anybody too much unless you have some other funding stream. And I have

1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:13.520
 avoided battles most of my career, but I pay attention to all of it. And I've watched this

1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:17.920
 and I don't think it's ego driven. I think it's that people fall in love with an idea. I don't

1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:21.360
 think there's any, there's not enough money in science for people to sit back there rubbing

1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:27.600
 their hands together. The beauty of what Neuralink and Elon and team, because obviously he's

1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:32.800
 very impressive, but the team as a whole is really what gives me great confidence in their mission,

1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:40.800
 is that he's already got enough money, so it can't be about that. He doesn't seem to need it at a

1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:46.160
 level of, I don't know him, but he doesn't seem to need it at a kind of an ego level or something.

1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:52.400
 I think it's driven by genuine curiosity. And the team that he's assembled include people that

1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:58.480
 are very kind of abstract neuro neocortex, space time coding people. They're people like Matt,

1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:06.720
 who is a neurosurgeon. You can't BS neurosurgery. Failures in neurosurgery are not tolerated,

1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:11.840
 so you have to be very good to exceptional to even get through the gate. And he's exceptional.

1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:16.080
 And then they've got people like Dan Adams, who was at UCSF for a long time, is a good

1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:21.040
 friend and a known name for years, who is very concrete, studied the vasculature in the eye

1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:24.560
 and how it maps to the vasculature in cortex. When you get a team like that together,

1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:29.440
 you're going to have dissenters. You're going to have people that are high level thinkers,

1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:34.320
 people that are coders. When you get a team like that, it no longer looks like an academic

1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:39.920
 laboratory or even a field in science. And so I think they're going to solve some really hard

1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:48.720
 problems. And again, I'm not here, I have nothing at stake with them. But I think that's the solution.

1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:53.360
 You need a bunch of people who don't need first author papers, who don't need to complete their

1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:59.280
 PhD, who aren't relying on outside funding, who have a clear mission, and you have a bunch of

1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:04.560
 people who are basically will adapt to solve the problem. I like the analogy of the three

1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:10.240
 meter target and the hundred meter target. So the folks at Neuralink are basically many of them

1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:14.640
 are some of the best people in the world at the three meter target. Like you mentioned Matt,

1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:19.280
 Neurosurgery, like they're solving real problems. There's no BS, philosophical

1:52:19.280 --> 1:52:23.360
 smoke. So we need to look back and look at the stars. But

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.040
 so both on Elon and because I think like this, I think it's really important to think about

1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:36.560
 the hundred meter and the hundred meter is not even not even a hundred meter, but like

1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:43.200
 like the stuff behind the hill that's that's that's too far too far away, which is which is

1:52:43.200 --> 1:52:54.320
 where I put consciousness. I'm maybe I tend to believe that consciousness can be engineered.

1:52:55.120 --> 1:53:02.640
 I mean, part of the reason part of the the the business I want to build leverages that idea

1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:07.680
 that consciousness is a lot simpler that we've then we've been talking about.

1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:12.400
 Well, if someone can simplify the problem, right, that will be wonderful. I mean, the reason we can

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:17.360
 talk about something as abstract as face representations and fusiform face area is

1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:24.720
 because Nancy Kenwisher had the brilliance to tie it to the kind of lower level statistics

1:53:24.720 --> 1:53:28.800
 of visual scenes. It wasn't because she was like, oh, I bet it's there. That wouldn't have been

1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:36.160
 interesting. So people like her understand how to bridge that gap. And they put a tractable definition.

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:41.600
 So I just that's what I'm begging for in science is a tractable definition.

1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:48.480
 This is what but I want people to sit in it. I want people who are really uncomfortable with

1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:54.880
 woo woo, like consciousness, like high level stuff to sit in that topic and sit uncomfortably,

1:53:54.880 --> 1:53:59.440
 because it forces them to then try to ground and simplify it into something that's concrete.

1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:03.440
 Because too many people are just uncomfortable to sit in the consciousness room,

1:54:04.080 --> 1:54:09.440
 because there's no definitions. It's like attention or intelligence in the artificial

1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:14.160
 intelligence community. But the reality is, it's easy to avoid that room all together,

1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:18.160
 which is what I mean, there's analogies to everything you've said with the artificial

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:24.720
 intelligence community with Minsky and even Alan Turing that talked about intelligence a lot.

1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:28.480
 And then they drew a lot of funding and then it crashed because they really didn't do anything

1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:34.560
 with it. And it was a lot of force of personality and so on. But that doesn't mean the topic of

1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:43.520
 the Turing test and intelligence isn't something we should sit on and think. Turing actually

1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:48.720
 attempted this with the Turing test. He tried to make concrete this very question of intelligence.

1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:56.640
 It doesn't mean that we shouldn't linger on it. And we shouldn't forget that ultimately that is

1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:03.200
 what our efforts are all about in the artificial intelligence community. And in the people,

1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:07.840
 whether it's neuroscience or whatever bigger umbrella you want to use for understanding the

1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:17.040
 mind, the goal is not just about understanding layer two or three of the vision. It's to understand

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:24.800
 consciousness and intelligence and maybe create it or just all the possible biggest questions

1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:30.880
 of our universe. That's ultimately the dream. Absolutely. And I think what I really appreciate

1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:35.440
 about what you're saying is that everybody, whether or not they're working on a kind of

1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:40.400
 low level synapse that's like a reflex in the musculature or something very high level abstract

1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:46.320
 can benefit from looking at those who prefer three, everyone's going after three meter,

1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:51.680
 10 meter and 100 meter targets in some sense. But to be able to tolerate the discomfort of

1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:57.120
 being in a conversation where there are real answers where the zeros and ones are known zeros

1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:01.760
 and ones are those the equivalent of them in the nervous system. And also, as you said,

1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:06.160
 for the people that are very much like, oh, I can only trust what I can see and touch,

1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:10.400
 those people need to put themselves into the discomfort of the high level conversation because

1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:20.240
 what's missing is conversation and conceptualization of things at multiple levels. I think one of the

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:25.040
 this is I don't gripe about my life's been fortunate, we've been funded from the start and

1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:31.200
 we've been happy in that regard and lucky and we're grateful for that. But I think one of the

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:39.120
 challenges of research being so expensive is that there isn't a lot of time, especially nowadays,

1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:46.160
 for people to just convene around a topic because there's so much emphasis on productivity. And

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:50.560
 so there are actually, believe it or not, there aren't that many concepts, formal concepts in

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:56.640
 neuroscience right now. The last 10 years has been this huge influx of tools. And so people

1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:01.920
 in neural circuits and probing around and connectomes, it's been wonderful. But 10,

1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:06.800
 20 years ago, when the consciousness stuff was more prominent, the C word, as you said,

1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:13.120
 what was good about that time is that people would go to meetings and actually discuss ideas and

1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:19.680
 models. Now, it's sort of like demonstration day at the School of Science Fair where everyone's

1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:26.240
 got their thing and some stuff is cooler than others. But I think we're going to see a shift.

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:32.720
 I'm grateful that we have so many computer scientists and theoreticians and or theorists,

1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:41.840
 I think they call themselves. Somebody tell me what the difference is someday. And psychology and

1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:46.160
 even dare I say philosophy, these things are starting to converge. Neuroscience,

1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:50.480
 the name neuroscience, there wasn't even such a thing. When I started graduate school or as a

1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:56.720
 postdoc, it was neurophysiology or you're a neuroanatomist or what now, it's sort of everybody's

1:57:56.720 --> 1:58:01.440
 invited. And that's beautiful. That means that something useful is going to come up all this.

1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:04.960
 And there's also tremendous work, of course, happening for the treatment of disease. And

1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:10.560
 we shouldn't overlook that. That's where eliminating, reducing suffering is also a huge

1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:15.200
 initiative of neuroscience. So there's a lot of beauty in the field. But the consciousness thing

1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:22.480
 continues to be a, it's like an exotic bird. It's like, no one really quite knows how to handle it

1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:33.840
 and it dies very easily. Well, yeah, I think also from the AI perspective, I so I view the brain

1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:41.440
 as less sacred. I think from a neuroscience perspective, you're a little bit more sensitive

1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:49.360
 to BS, like BS narratives about the brain or whatever. I'm a little bit more comfortable

1:58:49.360 --> 1:58:54.000
 with just poetic BS about the brain as long as it helps engineer intelligence systems.

1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:55.360
 Well, I mean,

1:58:56.400 --> 1:59:02.000
 and I have to, you know, I confess ignorance when it comes to, you know, most things about coding

1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:06.160
 and I have some quantitative ability, but I don't have strong quantitative leanings. And so

1:59:06.160 --> 1:59:12.160
 I know my limitations too. And so I think the next generation coming up, you know, a lot of the

1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:17.040
 students at Stanford are really interested in quantitative models and theory and AI. And

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:22.320
 I remember when I was coming up, a lot of the people who were doing work ahead of me, I kind of

1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:25.840
 rolled my eyes at some of the stuff they were doing, including some of their personalities,

1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:30.880
 although I have many great senior colleagues everywhere, the world. So it's the way of the

1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:35.760
 world. So nobody knows what it's like to be, you know, a young graduate student in 2020 except

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:40.400
 the young graduate students. So I know what I do. I know there are a lot of things I don't know.

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:45.360
 And in addition to why I do a lot of public education, increased scientific literacy and

1:59:45.360 --> 1:59:51.680
 neuroscientific thinking, etc. A big goal of mine is to try and at least pave the way so that

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:56.640
 these really brilliant and forward thinking younger scientists can make the biggest possible

1:59:56.640 --> 2:00:02.240
 dent and make what will eventually be all us old guys and gals look stupid. I mean, that's

2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:09.120
 what we were all trying to do. That's what we were trying to do. So yeah. So from the highest

2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:18.960
 possible topic of consciousness to the, to the lowest level topic of David Goggins, let's go.

2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:24.160
 I don't know if it's low level. He's high performance. High performance. But like low,

2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:31.040
 like there's no, I don't think David has, has, has any time for philosophy. Let's just put it

2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:36.640
 this way. Well, it's, I mean, I think we can tack it to what we were just saying in a, in a

2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:44.160
 meaningful way, which is whatever goes on in that abstraction part of the brain, he's figured,

2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:50.160
 you know, he's figured out how to dig down in whatever the limbic friction. He's figured out

2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:57.680
 how to grab ahold of that, scruff it and send it in the direction that he's decided it needs to go.

2:00:57.680 --> 2:01:03.600
 And what's wild is that he's what we're talking about is him doing that to himself. Right? He's,

2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:07.600
 it's like he's scruffing himself and directing himself in a particular direction

2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:15.040
 and sending himself down that trajectory. And he, what's beautiful is that he acknowledges

2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:23.280
 that that process is not pretty. It doesn't feel good. It's kind of horrible at every level.

2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:31.280
 But he's created this rewarding element to it. And I think that's what's so, it's so admirable.

2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.080
 And it's what so many people crave, which is regulation of the self at that level.

2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:43.520
 And he practices, I mean, there's a ritual to it. There's every single day, like no exceptions.

2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:49.040
 There's a practice aspect to the suffering that he goes through.

2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:54.000
 It's principle suffering. Principle suffering. I mean, I just, I mean,

2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:58.800
 I admire all aspects of it, including him and his girlfriend slash wife. I'm not sure.

2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:02.000
 Should probably know this. I don't know. I'm not asking him.

2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:07.760
 No, no, we've only communicated, I've only communicated with her by text about some stuff

2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:13.600
 I was asking David. But yeah, they clearly have formed a powerful team.

2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:19.280
 Yeah. And it's a beautiful thing to see people working in that kind of synergy.

2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:23.760
 It's inspiring to me, same as with Elon, that a guy like David Goggins can find love.

2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:30.960
 That you find a thing that works, which gives me hope that like whatever,

2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:36.880
 whatever flavor of crazy I am, you can always find another thing that works with that.

2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:46.160
 But I've had the, so maybe let's trade Goggins stories, you're from a neuroscience

2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:52.400
 perspective, me from a self inflicted pain perspective. I somehow found myself

2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:59.360
 in communication with David about some challenges that I was undergoing.

2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:07.840
 One of which is we were communicating every single day, email phone about the particular

2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:12.800
 30 day challenge that I did and that stretched for longer of pushups and pullups.

2:03:13.520 --> 2:03:15.840
 You made a call out on social media. Yeah, social media.

2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:21.040
 Actually, I think that was the point. I knew of you before, but that's where I started tracking

2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:23.280
 some of what you were doing with these physical challenges. And I,

2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:28.400
 the hell is wrong with that guy? Well, no, I think I actually, I don't often comment on people's

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:33.680
 stuff, but I think I commented something like neuroplasticity loves a non negotiable rule.

2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:39.760
 But no, I said a non negotiable contract because at the point where yeah, neuroplasticity really

2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:45.520
 loves a non negotiable contract because, you know, and I've said this before, so forgive me,

2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:50.160
 but you know, the brain is doing analysis of duration path and outcome. And that's a lot

2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:55.280
 of work for the brain. And the more that it can pass off duration path and outcome to just

2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:02.640
 reflex, the more energy and it can allocate to other things. So if you decide there's no

2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:07.280
 negotiation about how many pushups, how far I'm going to run, how many days, how many pullups,

2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:11.440
 et cetera, you actually have more energy for pushups running in pullups.

2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:15.520
 And when you say neuroplasticity, you mean like the brain wants the decision is made,

2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:20.560
 it'll start rewiring stuff to, to make sure that this we can actually make this happen.

2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:24.560
 That's right. I mean, so much of what we do is reflexive at the level of just core circuitry,

2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:28.960
 breathing, heart rate, all that boring stuff, digestion. But then there's a lot of reflexive

2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:34.400
 stuff like how you drink out of a mug of coffee, that's reflexive too, but that you had to learn

2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.720
 at some point in your life earlier when you were very little, analyzing duration path and outcome.

2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:43.600
 And that involves a lot of top down processing with the prefrontal cortex. But through plasticity

2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:48.800
 mechanisms, you now do it. So when you take on a challenge, provided that you understand the core

2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:53.120
 mechanics of how to, you know, run pushups and pullups and whatever else you decided to do.

2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:59.680
 Once you set the number and the duration and all that, then you all you have to do is just go.

2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:05.200
 But people get caught in that tide pool of just, well, do I really have to do it? How do I not do

2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:09.120
 that? What if I get injured? What if I, you know, can I sneak at this? So that, you know, and that's

2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:18.480
 work. And to some extent, I look, I not David Goggins, obviously, nor nor do I claim to understand

2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:24.960
 his process. Partially, you know, but maybe a little bit, which is that it's clear that by

2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:30.640
 making the decision, there's more resources to devote to the effort of the actual execution.

2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:35.760
 Well, that's a really, like what you're saying was not a lesson that was obvious to me. And it's

2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:40.400
 still not obvious. It's something I really work at, which is there is always an option to quit.

2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:48.240
 And I mean, that's something I really struggle with. I mean, I've quit some things in my life.

2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:59.040
 It's like stupid stuff. And one lesson I've learned is if you quit once, it opens the door

2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:06.080
 that like, it's really valuable to trick your brain into thinking

2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:13.360
 that you're going to have to die before you quit. Like, it's actually really convenient. So actually,

2:06:13.360 --> 2:06:19.760
 what you're saying is very profound, but you shouldn't intellectualize it. Like,

2:06:21.840 --> 2:06:29.200
 it took me time to develop, like out psychologically in ways that I think it would be

2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:32.960
 another conversation, because I'm not sure how to put it into words, but it's really tough

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:36.880
 on me to do certain parts of that challenge.

2:06:36.880 --> 2:06:39.440
 Well, it's a huge output.

2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:47.040
 I thought it would be the number would be hard, but it's not. It's the entirety of it,

2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:56.480
 especially in the early days, was just spending, I'm kind of embarrassed to say how many hours

2:06:56.480 --> 2:07:02.800
 this took. So I didn't say publicly how many hours because people I knew people would be like,

2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:08.080
 don't you aren't you supposed to do other stuff? Well, it's how are you doing?

2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:11.760
 Again, I don't want to speculate too much about but occasionally, David has said this publicly

2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:16.480
 where people will be like, don't you sleep or something? And his process used to just be that

2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:23.120
 he would just block, delete, you know, like gone. But it's actually, it's a super interesting

2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:31.040
 topic. And because self control and directing our actions and the role of emotion and quitting,

2:07:32.400 --> 2:07:37.120
 these are vital to the human experience. And they're vital to performing well at anything.

2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:42.240
 And obviously at a super high level, being able to understand this about the self is crucial.

2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:48.880
 So I have a friend who was also in the teams. His name is Pat Dossett. He did nine years in the

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:57.760
 SEAL teams. And in a similar way, there's a lore about him among team guys, because of a kind of

2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:02.560
 funny challenge he gave himself, which was so he and I swim together, although he swims further

2:08:02.560 --> 2:08:10.480
 up front than I do. And he's very patient. But, you know, he was on a he was assigned when he

2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:14.720
 was in the teams to a position that gave him a little more time behind a desk than he wanted.

2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:19.680
 And there's not as much time out in deployments, although he did deployments. So he didn't know

2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:24.240
 what to do at that time. But he thought about it and he asked himself, what does he hate the most?

2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:28.480
 And it turns out the thing that he hated doing the most was bear crawls, you know,

2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:32.880
 walking in your hands and knees. So he decided to bear crawl for a mile for time. So he was

2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:37.840
 bear crawling a mile a day, right? And I thought that was an interesting example that he gave,

2:08:37.840 --> 2:08:42.880
 because, you know, like, why pick the thing you hate the most? And I think it maps right back

2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:47.920
 to limbic friction. It's the thing that creates the most limbic friction. And so if you can overcome

2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:53.200
 that, then there's carryover. And I think the notion of carryover has been talked about psychologically

2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:56.560
 and kind of in the self help space, like, oh, if you run a marathon, it's going to help you in

2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:00.640
 other areas of life. But will it really? Will it? Well, I think it depends on whether or not

2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:05.840
 there's a lot of limbic friction. Because if there is, what you're exercising is not a circuit

2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:10.720
 for bear crawls, or a circuit for pull ups, what you're doing is you're exercising a circuit for

2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:16.880
 top down control. And that circuit was not designed to be for bear crawls, or pull ups, or coding,

2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:22.320
 or waking up in the middle of the night to do something hard. That circuit was designed to

2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:28.640
 override limbic friction. And so neural circuits were designed to generalize, right? The stress

2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:34.400
 response to an incoming threat that's a physical threat was designed to feel the same way and be

2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:40.720
 the same response internally as the threat to an impending exam, or divorce, or marriage, or whatever

2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:46.640
 it is that's stressing somebody out. And so neural circuits are not designed to be for one particular

2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.640
 action or purpose. So if you can, as you did, if you can train up top down control under conditions

2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:58.640
 of the highest limbic friction, that when the desired acquit is at its utmost, either because

2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:05.520
 of fatigue or hyperarousal, being too stressed or too tired, you're learning how to engage a

2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:12.160
 circuit. And that circuit is forever with you. And if you don't engage it, it sits there, but

2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:17.680
 it's atrophied. It's like a plant that doesn't get any water. And a lot of this has been discussed

2:10:17.680 --> 2:10:22.240
 in self help and growth mindset and all these kinds of ideas that circle the internet and social

2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:26.320
 media. But when you start to think about how they map to neural circuits, I think there's some

2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:31.680
 utility because what it means is that the limbic friction that you'll experience in, I don't know,

2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:38.560
 maybe some future relationship to something or someone, it's a category of neural processing

2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:42.720
 that should immediately click into place. It's just like the limbic friction you experienced

2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:49.600
 trying to engage in the God knows how many push ups, pull ups, and running runs you were doing.

2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:56.960
 25,000, 20,000. So folks, if Lex does this again, more comments, more likes.

2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:02.080
 This is the problem with you getting more followers as you're going to get more.

2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:05.840
 Actually, I should say that's the benefit. I don't know. Maybe it's not politically

2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:14.080
 correct for me to ask, but there is this stereotype about Russians being like being really

2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:23.840
 durable. And I started going to that Russian Banya way back before COVID and they could tolerate a

2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:28.480
 lot of heat and they would sit very stoic and no one was going, oh, it's hot in here. They were

2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:32.240
 just kind of like ease into it. So maybe there's something there who knows.

2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:35.600
 There might be something there, but it could be also just personal. I just have some,

2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:41.920
 I found myself, everyone's different, but I've found myself to be able to do

2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:48.640
 something unpleasant for very long periods of time. Like, I'm able to shut off the mind.

2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:52.320
 And I don't think that's been fully tested.

2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:55.040
 Monkey mind or the supercomputer?

2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:02.240
 Well, it's interesting. I mean, which mind tells you to quit exactly?

2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:05.440
 Limbic friction tells you.

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:09.120
 Limbic friction is the source of that, but who are you talking with exactly?

2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:14.800
 So there's a, we can put something very concrete to that. So there's a paper published in Cell,

2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:23.760
 super top tier journal, two years ago, looking at effort. And this was in a visual environment

2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:28.320
 of trying to swim forward toward a target and a reward. And it was a really cool experiment

2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:34.160
 because they manipulated virtually the visual environment. So the same amount of effort was

2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:38.080
 being expended every time, but sometimes the perception was you're making forward progress

2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:42.800
 and sometimes the perception was you're making no progress because stuff wasn't drifting by,

2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:46.640
 meant no progress. So you can be swimming and swimming and not making progress.

2:12:46.640 --> 2:12:54.480
 And it turns out that with each bout of effort, there's a epinephrine and norepinephrine is being

2:12:54.480 --> 2:12:59.840
 released in the brainstem. And glia, what traditionally were thought of as support cells

2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.560
 for the neurons, but they do a lot of things actively too, are measuring the amount of

2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:08.560
 epinephrine and norepinephrine in that circuit. And when it exceeds a certain threshold,

2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:13.200
 the glia send inhibitory signals that shut down, top down control, they literally,

2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:20.880
 it's the quit, you stop, there's no more, it's you quit enduring. It can be rescued,

2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:30.320
 endurance can be rescued with dopamine. So that's where the subjective part really comes into play.

2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:36.240
 So you quit because you've learned how to turn that off or you've learned how to,

2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:42.000
 some people will reward the pain process so much that friction becomes the reward.

2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.960
 And when you talk about people like Goggins and other people I know from special operations and

2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:52.880
 people have gone through cancer treatments three times, you hear about, just when you hear about

2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:56.960
 people, the Victor Frankel stories, I mean, you hear about Nelson Mandela, you hear about these

2:13:56.960 --> 2:14:02.080
 stories, I'm sure the same process is involved. Again, this speaks to the generalizability of

2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:06.880
 these processes as opposed to a neural circuit for a particular action or cognitive function.

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:12.800
 So I think you have to learn to subjectively self reward in a way that replenishes you.

2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:20.080
 Goggins talks about eating souls. It's a very dramatic example. In his mind, apparently,

2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:26.400
 that's a form of reward, but it's not just a form of reward where it's like you're picking up a

2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:33.840
 trophy or something. It's actually it gives the energy. It's a reward that gives more neural energy

2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:39.760
 and I'm defining that as more dopamine to suppress the noradrenaline and adrenaline circuits in the

2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:45.920
 brainstem. So ultimately maps of that. Yeah, he creates enemies. He's always fighting enemies.

2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:51.200
 I never, I think I have enemies, but they're usually just versions of me inside my head.

2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:56.480
 So I thought about through that 30 day challenge, I tried to come up with like

2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:02.800
 fake enemies. It wasn't working. The only enemy I came up with is David.

2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:11.360
 Well, now you certainly have a formidable adversary in this one. I don't care. David,

2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:19.280
 I'm willing to die on this one. So let's go there. Well, let's hope you both survive this.

2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:24.960
 Well, my problem is the physical. So everything we've been talking about has been in the mind.

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:33.360
 There's a physical aspect that's just practically difficult, which is when you injure yourself

2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:38.800
 at a certain point, you just can't function. Or you're doing more damage talking about it,

2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:46.000
 taking yourself out of running for the rest of your life potentially or for years. So

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:52.640
 you know, I'd love to avoid that, right? There's just like stupid physical stuff that you just

2:15:52.640 --> 2:15:58.000
 want to avoid. You want to keep it purely in the mental. And if it's purely in the mental,

2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.720
 that's when the race is interesting. But yeah, the problem with these physical challenges,

2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:09.200
 as David has experienced, I mean, it has a toll on your body. I tend to think of the mind as

2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:14.560
 limitless and the body is kind of unfortunately quite limited. Well, I think the key is to

2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:22.320
 dynamically control your output. And that can be done by reducing effort, which doesn't work throughout,

2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:31.040
 but also by restoring through these subjective reward processes. And we don't want to go down

2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:35.200
 the rabbit hole of why this all works. But these are ancient pathways that were designed to

2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:41.760
 bring resources to an animal or to a person through foraging for hunting or mates or water or

2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:47.200
 all these things. And they work so well because they're down in those circuits where we know

2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:53.200
 the zeros and ones. And that's great because it can be subjective at the level of, oh, I reached

2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:59.760
 this one milestone, this one horizon, this one three meter target. But if you don't reward it,

2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:08.240
 it's just effort. If you do self reward it, it's effort minus one in terms of the adrenaline output.

2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:16.560
 But I have to ask you about this. You're one of the great communicators in science. I'm

2:17:16.560 --> 2:17:21.680
 really a big fan of yours enjoying in terms of like the educational stuff you're putting

2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:28.640
 on neuroscience. Thank you. What's the, do you have a philosophy behind it or is it just an

2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:35.040
 instinct? Oh my unstoppable force. Do you have like, what's your thinking? Because it's rare

2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:45.760
 and it's exciting. I'm excited that somebody from Stanford, so I, okay, I'm in multiple places in

2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:52.720
 the sense of like where my interests lie. And politically speaking, academic institutions

2:17:52.720 --> 2:18:00.800
 are under fire for many reasons we don't need to get into. I get into it in a lot of other places.

2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:11.840
 But I believe in places like Stanford and places like MIT as one of the most magical

2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:19.840
 institutions for inspiring people to dream, people to build the future. I mean, I believe

2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:25.600
 that it is a really special, these universities are really special places. And so it's always

2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:34.000
 exciting to me when somebody as inspiring as you represents those places. So it makes me

2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:40.320
 proud that somebody from Stanford is like something like you is representing Stanford.

2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:51.600
 So maybe you could speak to what's, how did you come to be who you are in being a communicator?

2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:56.880
 Well, first of all, thanks for the kind words, especially coming from you. I think

2:18:57.440 --> 2:19:02.080
 Stanford is an amazing place as is MIT. And it's such a... MIT is better by the way.

2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:07.040
 I'll let it out anything you say at this point. I've got many friends at MIT.

2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:16.560
 Smarter friends, yeah. Ed Boyden is among the best in class. There's some people,

2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:21.200
 not me, that can hold a candle to him, but not many, maybe one or two. I think the

2:19:21.200 --> 2:19:26.640
 great benefit of being in a place like MIT or Stanford is that when you look around,

2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:34.800
 the average is very high. You have many best in class among the one or two or three best in

2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:40.640
 the world at what they do. And it's a wonderful privilege to be there. And one thing that I

2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:46.080
 think also makes them and other universities like them very special is that there's an emphasis on

2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:51.520
 what gets exported out of the university, not keeping it ivory tower and really trying to keep

2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:56.720
 an eye on what's needed in the world and trying to do something useful. And I think the proximity

2:19:56.720 --> 2:20:02.320
 to industry and Silicon Valley and in the Boston area in Cambridge also lends itself well to that.

2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:08.240
 And there are other institutions too, of course. So the reason I got involved in educating on

2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:16.400
 social media was actually because of Pat Dossett, the mile bear call guy. I was at the turn of

2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:23.840
 2018 to 2019. We had formed a good friendship and he talked to me into doing these early morning

2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:28.160
 cold water swims. I was learning a lot about pain and suffering, but also the beauty of cold water

2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:33.440
 swims. And we were talking one morning, he said, so what are you going to do to serve the world

2:20:33.440 --> 2:20:39.120
 in 2019? That's the way that a Texan former seal talks. We're just literally like, what are you

2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:42.560
 going to do to serve the world in 2019? Well, I run my lab, it's like, no, no, no, what are you

2:20:42.560 --> 2:20:46.160
 going to do that's new? And he wasn't forceful in it, but I was like, that's interesting question.

2:20:46.160 --> 2:20:52.320
 I said, well, if I had my way, I would just teach people, everyone about the brain because I think

2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:57.360
 it's amazing. He goes, we'll do it. All right. He goes, shake on it. So we did it. And so I

2:20:57.360 --> 2:21:04.720
 started putting out these posts and it's grown into to include a variety of things. But you asked

2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:10.640
 about a governing philosophy. So I want to increase interest in the brain and in the nervous system

2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:16.560
 and in biology generally. That's one major goal. I'd like to increase scientific literacy, which

2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:22.880
 can't be rammed down people's throats of talking about how to look at a graph and statistics and

2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:30.400
 z scores and p values and genetics. It has to be done gradually in my opinion. I want to put

2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:35.440
 valuable tools into the world, mainly tools that map to things that we're doing in our lab.

2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:41.040
 So these will be tools centered around how to understand and direct one's states of mind and

2:21:41.040 --> 2:21:45.840
 body. So reduce stress, raise one's stress threshold. So it's not always just about being

2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:49.120
 calm. Sometimes it's about learning how to tolerate not being not calm,

2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:57.200
 raise awareness for mental health. There's a ton of micro missions in this. But it all really maps

2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:03.040
 back to the eight and 10 year old version of me, which is I used to spend my weekends when I was

2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:08.160
 a kid reading about weird animals. And I had this obsession with medieval weapons and stuff like

2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:13.120
 catapults. And then I used to come into school on Monday and I would ask if I could talk about it

2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:20.560
 to the class and teach. And I promise and some people might not believe me, but I don't really

2:22:20.560 --> 2:22:27.040
 like being the point of focus. I just get so excited about these gems that I find in the

2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:32.560
 world in books and in experiments and in discussions with colleagues and discussions with people like

2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:39.360
 you and around the universe. And just compulsively, I got to tell people about it. So I try and package

2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:45.440
 it into a form that people can access. I think the reception has been really wonderful. Stanford

2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:52.560
 has been very supportive, thankfully. I've done some podcasts even with them and they've reposted

2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:56.720
 some stuff on social media. It's a precarious place to put yourself out there as a research

2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:01.280
 academic. I think some of my colleagues, both locally and elsewhere, probably wonder if I'm

2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:09.680
 still serious about research, which I absolutely am. And I also acknowledge that their research and

2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:15.600
 the research coming out of the field needs to be talked about. And not all scientists are good at

2:23:15.600 --> 2:23:20.960
 translating that into a language that people can access. And I don't like the phrase dumb it down.

2:23:20.960 --> 2:23:26.960
 What I like to do is take a concept that I think people will find interesting and useful

2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:32.880
 and offer it sort of like you would offer food to somebody visiting your home. You're not going

2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:38.240
 to cram Fragras in their face. You're going to say, do you want a cracker? And they say, yeah,

2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:42.960
 do you want something on that cracker? Do you like cheese? Yeah, do you want Swiss cheese or

2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:48.080
 you want that really stinky French cheese? I don't like cheese much. But do you want

2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:55.120
 Fragras? What's that? So the best information prompts more questions of interest, not questions

2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:59.920
 of confusion, but questions of interest. And so I feel like one door opens, then another door opens,

2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:05.680
 then another door opens. And pretty soon, the image in my mind is you create a bunch of neuroscientists

2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:10.000
 who are thinking about themselves neuroscientifically. And I don't begin to think that I have all the

2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:16.800
 answers at all. I cast a neuroscience, sometimes a little bit of a psychology lens onto what I

2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:24.480
 think are interesting topics. And someday I'm going to go into the ground or the ocean or

2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:31.840
 wherever it is I end up. And I'm very comfortable with the fact that not everyone's going to be

2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:36.880
 happy with how I deliver the information. But I would hope that people would feel like some of

2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:42.160
 it was useful and meaningful and got them to think a little bit harder. Since you mentioned going

2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:58.960
 into the ground and Victor Franco man search for meaning, I reread that book quite often. Let me

2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:04.720
 ask the the big ridiculous question about life. What do you think is the the meaning of it all?

2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:10.320
 Like maybe why do you do you mention that book from a psychologist's perspective,

2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:17.600
 which Victor Franco was? Do you ever think about the the bigger philosophical questions

2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:21.040
 that raises about meaning? What's and the meaning of it all?

2:25:22.800 --> 2:25:28.640
 One of the great challenges in assigning a good, you know, giving a good answer to the question

2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:34.160
 of like, what's the meaning of life is, I think illustrated best by the Victor Franco example,

2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:40.320
 although there are other examples too, which is that our sense of meaning is very elastic

2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:48.640
 in time and space. And we talked a little bit about this earlier, but it's amazing to me that

2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:55.360
 somebody locked in a cell or a concentration camp can bring the horizon in close enough

2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:01.120
 that they can then micro slice their environment so that they can find rewards and meaning and power

2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:09.360
 and beauty even in a little square box or or a horrible situation. And I think this is really

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:14.160
 speaks to one of the most important features of the human mind, which is we could do let's take two

2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:19.680
 opposite extremes. One would be, let's say the alarm went off right now in this building and the

2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:26.880
 building started shaking. Our vision, our hearing, everything would be tuned to this space time bubble

2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:32.880
 for those moments. And everything that we would process, all that would matter, the only meaning

2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:39.120
 would be get out of here safe, figure out what's going on, contact loved ones, etc. If we were

2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:43.440
 to sit back totally relaxed, we could do the, you know, as I think it's called pale blue dot thing

2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:46.800
 or whatever, where we could imagine ourselves in this room, and then they were in the United

2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:50.720
 States and this continent and the earth and then it's peering down us. And all of a sudden you

2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:56.880
 get back, it can seem so big that all of a sudden it's meaningless, right? If you see yourself as

2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:04.800
 just one brief glimmer in all of time and all of space, you go to, I don't matter. And if you go to,

2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:10.080
 oh, every little thing that happens in this text thread or this, you know, comment section on

2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:16.880
 YouTube or Instagram, your space time bubble is tiny, then everything seems inflated and the brain

2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:26.400
 will contract and dilate its space time, vision and time, but also sense of meaning. And that's

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:31.040
 beautiful. And it's what allows us to be so dynamic in different environments and we can pull from

2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:36.800
 the past and the present and future. It's why examples like Nelson Mandela and Victor Frankel

2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:41.920
 had to include. It makes sense that it wasn't just about grinding it out, they had to find

2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:49.280
 those dopamine rewards even in those little boxes they were forced into. So I'm not trying to dodge

2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:57.200
 an answer, but for me personally, and I think about this a lot, because I have this complicated

2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:03.040
 history in science where my undergraduate graduate advisor and postdoctoral advisor all died young.

2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:10.560
 So, you know, and they were wonderful people and had immense importance in my life. But what I

2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:17.760
 realized is that we can get so fixated on the thing that we're experiencing holding tremendous

2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:25.280
 meaning, but it only holds that meaning for as long as we're in that space time regime. And this

2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:31.760
 is important because what really gives meaning is the understanding that you can move between

2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:36.400
 these different space time dimensionalities. And I'm not trying to sound like a theoretical

2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:43.600
 physicist or anyone that thinks about the cosmos and saying that. It's really the fact that sometimes

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:48.400
 we say and do and think things and it feels so important. And then two days later, we're like,

2:28:48.400 --> 2:28:55.120
 what happened? Well, you had a different brain processing algorithm entirely, you were in a

2:28:55.120 --> 2:29:02.400
 completely different state. And so what I want to do in this lifetime is I want to engage in as

2:29:02.400 --> 2:29:10.400
 many different levels of contraction and dilation of meaning as possible. I want to go to the micro.

2:29:10.400 --> 2:29:13.680
 I sometimes think about this. I'm like, if I just pulled over the side of the road, I bet you

2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:19.120
 there's an ant hill there and their whole world is fascinating. You can't stay there. And you also

2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:23.680
 can't stay staring up at the clouds and just think about how we're just these little beings and it

2:29:23.680 --> 2:29:30.960
 doesn't matter. The key is the journey back and forth up and down that staircase back and forth

2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:36.240
 and back and forth. And my goal is to get as many trips up and down that staircase as I can before

2:29:36.240 --> 2:29:42.240
 the Reaper comes for me. Oh, beautiful. So the dance of dilation and contraction between the

2:29:42.240 --> 2:29:51.120
 difference, zoom in, zoom out, and get as many steps in on that staircase. That's my goal anyway.

2:29:51.120 --> 2:29:57.440
 And I've watched people die. I watched my postdoc advisor die with or away. It was tragic, but

2:29:57.440 --> 2:30:04.080
 they found beauty in these closing moments because their bubble was their kids in one case or

2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:09.280
 like one of them was a Giants fan and got to see a Giants game in her last moments.

2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:15.120
 And you just realize it's a Giants game, but not in that moment because time is closing and so

2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:22.240
 those time bins feel huge because she's slicing things so differently. So I think learning how

2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:28.880
 to do that better and more fluidly, recognizing where one is and not getting too tacked to the

2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:34.160
 idea that there's one correct answer, like that's what brings meaning. That's my goal anyway.

2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:40.000
 I don't think there's a better way to end it. Andrew, I really appreciate that you would come

2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:47.520
 down and contract your space time and focus on this conversation for a few hours. It is

2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:54.240
 a huge honor. I'm a huge fan of yours as I told you. I hope you keep growing and educating the world

2:30:54.240 --> 2:31:00.560
 about the human mind. Thanks for talking today. Thank you. I really appreciate the invitation

2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:04.400

2:31:04.400 --> 2:31:10.400
 yours. I send your podcasts to my colleagues and other people. And I think what you're doing isn't

2:31:10.400 --> 2:31:17.280
 just amazing. It's important. And so thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with
