00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Michael Malis and Yaron Brooke, Michael's third time

00:05.680 --> 00:11.360
 on this podcast and Yaron's second, but together for the first time.

00:11.360 --> 00:18.240
 Michael is an anarchist, political thinker, host of a podcast called You're Welcome and

00:18.240 --> 00:25.200
 author of Dear Reader, the New Right and two upcoming books, Anarchist Handbook and the

00:25.200 --> 00:26.720
 White Pill.

00:26.720 --> 00:33.760
 Yaron is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Einrand Institute, host of the Yaron

00:33.760 --> 00:41.320
 Brooke Show and coauthor of The Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.

00:41.320 --> 00:49.720
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave and Forseigmatic.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.160
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:53.160 --> 00:58.360
 As a side note, let me say that this conversation is a kind of experiment.

00:58.360 --> 01:04.480
 Both Michael and Yaron are thoughtful and passionate, united in part by an interest in the history

01:04.480 --> 01:09.600
 and philosophy of Einrand, but they are also very different in style.

01:09.600 --> 01:15.200
 Good conversation, like good food, is often made delicious by pairing of contrasting

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
 elements.

01:16.200 --> 01:22.880
 For example, someone suggested I try a peanut butter, bacon and banana sandwich, which apparently

01:22.880 --> 01:24.640
 is very good.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.240
 Among the three of us, I don't know who's the peanut butter, who's the bacon and who's

01:28.240 --> 01:29.240
 the banana.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.760
 I'm guessing it's probably me, I'm the banana.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.640
 But I hope the final result, the final dish, if you will, is equally delicious.

01:38.640 --> 01:44.880
 We talk through, I think, a lot of interesting ideas, sometimes disagreeing, sometimes even,

01:44.880 --> 01:50.000
 in rare cases, saying something humorous, including dark humor, especially Michael's

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
 case.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.760
 All three of us are sensitive to the suffering in the world today and throughout human history.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.520
 We think about it, we talk about it, and we deal with it in different ways.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.000
 Be patient with us.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.240
 Whether you agree, disagree, enjoy or dislike the result, I hope you feel listened, hear

02:07.240 --> 02:09.800
 a wiser person on the other end of it.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.000
 I know I was.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.120
 Mostly, I really enjoyed this conversation because no matter what Michael and Yaron believe,

02:17.120 --> 02:22.800
 underneath it all, they're genuine, kind human beings that I'm lucky to be able to hang

02:22.800 --> 02:25.400
 out with and learn from.

02:25.400 --> 02:31.480
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here's my conversation with Michael Malis and Yaron

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
 Rook.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.880
 I've been a huge fan of the two of you for the longest time.

02:36.880 --> 02:37.880
 Are we recording now?

02:37.880 --> 02:38.880
 Is it starting?

02:38.880 --> 02:39.880
 Or are you just talking?

02:39.880 --> 02:40.880
 I'm not recording at all.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.320
 I'm not going to compliment this if it's not part of the show.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
 Yes, he does.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.320
 All the time.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.320
 He speaks very highly of me.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
 Big charity.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.320
 I'm not sure.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
 He only does this to me on the show.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.120
 Objectives don't like charities, so don't compliment him, he won't think it's sincere.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.320
 So it's an incredible honor that both of you would show up here.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.560
 If we, let me just ask this sort of profound philosophical question.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.560
 How well do you think we would get along if we were stuck in a desert island together?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.400
 What would life be like?

03:07.400 --> 03:12.040
 I thought the original question you had that you sent us this question was how long would

03:12.040 --> 03:13.920
 it take for us to murder one another or something like that?

03:13.920 --> 03:16.520
 There was murder in the question, if I remember.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.560
 Listen, he sent us homework, right?

03:18.560 --> 03:19.560
 All these questions.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
 I ignored it.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.680
 I didn't spend four years at Patrick Henry University to do homework.

03:23.680 --> 03:29.400
 To answer your question, I think it would be very easy for us to live together in desert

03:29.400 --> 03:30.840
 island in terms of interpersonal.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.880
 I know a lot, and I say this because I know a lot of people who have been the show survivor.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.880
 And I know a little bit about the dynamics.

03:36.880 --> 03:42.640
 So when you have people who are intelligent, who are going to have the same goals, I mean,

03:42.640 --> 03:44.880
 there's space to go away if I'm annoyed at you.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.960
 I don't think it would be that hard at all.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.840
 What's our goals on a desert island?

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
 Food, shelter, survival.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
 Survival.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
 Survival, basically.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.440
 Survival and getting out of it, right?

03:53.440 --> 03:54.880
 You don't want to stay on the desert island.

03:54.880 --> 04:01.480
 So yeah, I don't think, I think that's two of any three, you know, even semi rational

04:01.480 --> 04:06.040
 people who, you know, who basically share the goal that they want to survive.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.040
 They want to thrive.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.080
 They want to get off of the island.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.080
 Why would they be conflict?

04:10.080 --> 04:11.080
 Yes.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.320
 They can be conflict, and they can be conflict, but they find ways to deal with it.

04:15.320 --> 04:20.400
 I don't have this negative view of human beings, particularly not as individuals, it's when

04:20.400 --> 04:27.120
 they get into mobs and groups and collectives that ideology can really motivate them to

04:27.120 --> 04:28.400
 do horrible things.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.960
 One of the things that really drives me crazy is how sinister an impact the book Lord the

04:32.960 --> 04:34.920
 Flies has had on our culture.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.320
 I read in high school, it's a superb book.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.840
 That's not even a question, but it's not accurate.

04:39.840 --> 04:45.040
 We see in many situations where people are trapped together under difficult circumstances,

04:45.040 --> 04:50.040
 obviously that book is about children, that very quickly, it is not about conflict.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.960
 It very quickly becomes about cooperation.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
 Let's work together.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
 We all have the same goal.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.360
 This is not a time to worry about other things.

04:57.360 --> 05:04.040
 It really, the human beings, the animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal, and I'm

05:04.040 --> 05:08.160
 going to shut up and go over there and have like stop my feet instead of arguing with

05:08.160 --> 05:11.760
 your own because we're really trapped in the situation and we need to make it work.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.200
 Well, to the extent that they're bad people, bad people are dealt with.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.400
 This is true of all of, how did we survive as a species?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.640
 How have we survived as a species?

05:20.640 --> 05:24.320
 We've been on a desert island in a sense as a species forever.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.320
 Tribe survived.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.440
 They survived by cooperation.

05:26.440 --> 05:31.240
 They survived by dealing with bad people.

05:31.240 --> 05:37.040
 Civilization is created by people cooperating and working together and allowing individuals

05:37.040 --> 05:40.520
 to thrive within the group.

05:40.520 --> 05:44.760
 When bad people arise, they deal with them.

05:44.760 --> 05:50.840
 Sometimes these groups get captured by bad people and bad ideas and probably from day

05:50.840 --> 05:58.440
 one that was going on, the whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with.

05:58.440 --> 06:03.400
 Underneath it all, the fact is that to survive as a species, we need to think.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.720
 We need to be rational.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.720
 If we don't have any respect for reason, then we would all die.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.720
 We would die off.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.000
 So that's a hopeful message, but where does that go wrong?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.200
 So with three people who might get along, we would focus on the basics of life where

06:19.200 --> 06:20.600
 similar goals.

06:20.600 --> 06:26.160
 Once women are introduced, they're incessant in rationalism and less of their hormones

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
 or SOL.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.800
 Look, the University of the Desert Island would be nice, but without women, it wouldn't

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
 be fun.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.000
 I'm going to edit out half the things Michael said through his broadcast.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.320
 As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.760
 She was a woman last time I looked.

06:38.760 --> 06:39.760
 Oh, wait a minute.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.560
 You know exactly what I'm going to say.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.840
 When Ludwig von Mises or Haslitt, I don't know why it was Mises, was praising Ayn Rand

06:47.840 --> 06:50.280
 and I think it was Haslitt who said it to her.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.160
 He said, Ludwig von Mises said, you're the smartest man I've ever met.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.480
 And Ayn Rand said, did he say man?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
 Right?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
 No, she viewed as a compliment.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
 All right.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.480
 But she wanted to be clear that he said man.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.480
 She was excited.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.480
 Absolutely.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.480
 She was.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.480
 She was.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.840
 She was her perceiving him as seeing her as a full equal.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.120
 Oh, I think that's right.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.120
 I think that's right.

07:10.120 --> 07:15.440
 Plus, I think the perception out there, the perception and the culture of man as being

07:15.440 --> 07:22.120
 rational, you know, was a compliment to her because that was affirming that he viewed

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
 her as a rational.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
 Yeah.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.120
 Because Mises's old school, he's an older Eastern European guy, so he would definitely

07:27.120 --> 07:32.120
 have these rigid views like his wife, I read her autobiography, Margit von Mises, and basically

07:32.120 --> 07:36.640
 he made her his secretary to the point where like he's typing something or he had something

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
 handwritten.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.640
 She had to type it out.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.440
 And if she made a typo, he would tear up the page.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.640
 She had to start from the beginning, but it's like, this is the role of the man, this

07:43.640 --> 07:44.640
 is the role of the woman.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.000
 So for him to regard her, this was kind of a breaking through moment, not that she was

07:48.000 --> 07:51.360
 secretly misogynist.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.720
 So I think we go wrong when people try to understand the world around them and come

07:55.720 --> 07:57.720
 up with wrong ideas.

07:57.720 --> 08:02.240
 And it's natural that they would come up with wrong ideas because it's hard to figure

08:02.240 --> 08:03.640
 out what's right.

08:03.640 --> 08:10.040
 So we start with trying to come up with mystical explanations for the existence of the things

08:10.040 --> 08:11.800
 around us.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.760
 And that I think very quickly leads to some people being able to communicate with the

08:16.760 --> 08:20.920
 mystical stuff out there and some people not being able to communicate and some people

08:20.920 --> 08:27.440
 wanting to control other people and using those pseudo explanations as a way to control.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.120
 So you always have, Rand called it a tiller and the witch doctor.

08:31.120 --> 08:37.840
 You always have a witch doctor, the mystic, the philosopher, the intellectual, the philosopher,

08:37.840 --> 08:42.040
 you know, king is a unity of the, and you have an attila, you have somebody who wants

08:42.040 --> 08:46.000
 control of the people, who's willing to use force to control other people.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.440
 And when those two get together, that's when things go bad.

08:49.440 --> 08:57.600
 And unfortunately 95, 98% of human history is when those two are together.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.120
 And so they're not having them together, having the right ideas and the right ideas are ones

09:02.120 --> 09:07.720
 that are not exclusive to those guys and where we don't allow a tiller to have that kind of

09:07.720 --> 09:09.800
 physical power over us.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.400
 That's an exception and that's rare and that's what needs to be defended.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
 Yeah.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
 Stalin's not personally killing people.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
 Hitler's not personally killing people.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.960
 Charles Manson's not personally killing people.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.320
 They need their goons.

09:20.320 --> 09:25.640
 They need their goons, but also they don't, they don't have original ideas.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.280
 Nothing Stalin says is original to him, right?

09:28.280 --> 09:31.160
 He needs a Marx, even Lenin, right?

09:31.160 --> 09:32.560
 They all need a Marx, right?

09:32.560 --> 09:39.200
 They all, and Marx needs a particular line of thinkers that come before him that set

09:39.200 --> 09:41.280
 him up for these kinds of ideas.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.360
 So Stalin both needs his goons, even though he's somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.760
 He has a bankrupt real.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.760
 Yeah.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.640
 Lenin, Lenin, I think is a better example because Lenin's more intellectual, if you

09:51.640 --> 09:56.360
 will, but Lenin needs his goons, he needs his Stalin's, but Lenin also needs his Marx.

09:56.360 --> 10:02.040
 And we don't want to let Marx off the hook because Marx knows, I think, implicitly that

10:02.040 --> 10:05.360
 his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.680
 His ideas are not neutral.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.240
 I don't think it's implicit at all.

10:08.240 --> 10:13.040
 I think Marx very much glorified revolution, blood and terror.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.040
 This is not implicit.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.040
 No, absolutely.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.400
 There are letters between him and Engels where they talk about which peoples will have to

10:18.400 --> 10:23.760
 be eliminated because they don't have that proletariat thing, right?

10:23.760 --> 10:30.880
 So I think that certain peoples in Southern Europe are not appropriate for the utopia

10:30.880 --> 10:32.960
 to come and will have to be gone.

10:32.960 --> 10:38.600
 And Marx also had this concept, which we still see today in garbled ways of polylogism,

10:38.600 --> 10:44.320
 which is if you're a capitalist and I'm bourgeois or I'm a worker, your logic is different

10:44.320 --> 10:45.320
 than mine.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.800
 It's literally going to be impossible for us to communicate.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.920
 And at a certain point, you're going to have to be liquidated and they pretend that doesn't

10:50.920 --> 10:52.480
 mean murdered, but it means murdered.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.640
 And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois and then you have the hall of

10:56.640 --> 10:57.640
 the morn, things like this.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.800
 No, he knows exactly what it's going to lead.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.600
 And this is why people say, oh, Marx is not evil.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
 He just wrote books.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
 No.

11:04.600 --> 11:09.160
 It's the people who write books who are responsible for the way history evolves.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.440
 And they know.

11:10.440 --> 11:15.680
 They know the bad guys certainly know the consequence of their ideas.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.600
 And they need to bear the moral responsibility for what happens when their ideas are implemented.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
 Here's a way.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
 Can I ask a question?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
 Yeah.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
 Because I think I know more about Rand and Yaron.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
 So let's see.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.280
 Oh, the gauntlet has been thrown down.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.880
 Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man who ever lived?

11:30.880 --> 11:31.880
 Emmanuel Conte.

11:31.880 --> 11:32.880
 That's right.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
 Correct.

11:33.880 --> 11:34.880
 No, that I know.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.640
 I mean, it's a big deal that Emmanuel Conte is.

11:36.640 --> 11:41.240
 And most people don't understand why, because if you read Conte, there's certain passages

11:41.240 --> 11:43.040
 in Conte that sound pretty liberal.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.040
 They sound pretty.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.240
 He's for the individual.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.000
 It sounds like he's for the individual.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.920
 He sounds like he's for the American Revolution, things like that.

11:49.920 --> 11:53.360
 But when you, when you actually read his philosophy and what he's trying to defend and what he's

11:53.360 --> 11:59.120
 trying to undermine, he's trying to undermine the foundations that make the revolution possible,

11:59.120 --> 12:01.560
 that make freedom and individualism possible.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.520
 He's trying to destroy the Enlightenment.

12:03.520 --> 12:08.920
 And the Enlightenment is, are those ideas that make freedom, individualism feasible?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.720
 He's trying to undermine reason.

12:10.720 --> 12:15.960
 And without reason, we're nothing, we're not, we can't survive as a species.

12:15.960 --> 12:21.520
 So and that's why she thought he was the most evil person because his ideas undermine the

12:21.520 --> 12:27.000
 very foundations of what it requires to be a human being, reason and individualism.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.240
 Those are the things she's trying to eviscerate.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.480
 I know you've, you've talked about Hoffman before.

12:32.480 --> 12:39.680
 So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to Donald Hoffman.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
 Donald Hoffman.

12:40.680 --> 12:46.960
 Donald Hoffman is the University of California, Ovine, a neurologist, a neuroscientist, something

12:46.960 --> 12:47.960
 like that.

12:47.960 --> 12:53.000
 So I met him once and we went, at one of these conferences where you do a quick intro, you

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
 said, and you do a quick intro.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.560
 His introduction was, I've just written a book that proves that evolution has conditioned

12:58.560 --> 13:02.640
 us not to see reality.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.560
 Okay, that is very content.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.560
 Yeah.

13:05.560 --> 13:12.960
 And he is basically just presenting pseudoscience to defend Kant's position about epistemology

13:12.960 --> 13:14.880
 and about, and about metaphysics.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.160
 And there's nothing, there's nothing original there.

13:18.160 --> 13:23.240
 And he puts up a bunch of equations and he says, I ran a simulation and it proves I'm

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
 right.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.560
 So Yaron is a little bit frustrated with Donald Hoffman's work.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
 Let me, let me.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.560
 I'm frustrated.

13:30.560 --> 13:36.000
 I just think it's completely wrong and it is, and it's anti life, anti mind, anti evolution.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.280
 I think he's an anti evolutionist at the end.

13:38.280 --> 13:42.000
 And I think it, you know, anytime you say, look, here's the important point.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.200
 Anytime you say reality doesn't exist, or that you perceive it, well, who are you?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.280
 What do you mean by, what are any of your words mean?

13:49.280 --> 13:52.900
 What does anything you say even mean if it doesn't refer to something that's actually

13:52.900 --> 13:53.900
 out there in reality?

13:53.900 --> 13:58.600
 I try to defend this point of view because in a, in a certain kind of sense, I hear it

13:58.600 --> 14:05.720
 as a being humble in the face of the uncertainty that's around us, sort of, you know, when

14:05.720 --> 14:12.640
 you speak with the confidence of Ayn Rand and yourself, that reason can be like this

14:12.640 --> 14:17.120
 weapon that cuts through all the bullshit of the world and makes us like have an ethical

14:17.120 --> 14:19.680
 moral life and all those kinds of things.

14:19.680 --> 14:25.120
 You kind of assume that reason is a superpower that has no limits.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.120
 Wait, hold on.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.120
 Hold on a second, okay.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.120
 But, but...

14:30.120 --> 14:31.120
 I got this one.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.320
 See, this is already leading to a murder by words.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
 Yeah.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.320
 And we've been only talking for 20 minutes.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.320
 It just wouldn't get along together.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.320
 It wouldn't get along together on an island.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
 No, we just make him our slave.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
 We're all going to get along.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
 He's just going to do the work.

14:42.320 --> 14:49.520
 But I'm afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave, so this is, this is not going

14:49.520 --> 14:50.520
 to end well for me.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.640
 We can provide value as dinner.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
 That's the problem.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.640
 I'm trying to get there.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.640
 That's a solution.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.640
 Okay.

14:56.640 --> 15:04.320
 But Donald Hoffman says that there is, like, he makes an argument that the, exactly as

15:04.320 --> 15:12.480
 you said, that the, what we perceive is not, is very, very far from actual physical reality.

15:12.480 --> 15:17.600
 In fact, we're not able to perceive the physical reality at all.

15:17.600 --> 15:26.520
 And he also makes the bigger claim that evolution prefers beings who are not attached to reality.

15:26.520 --> 15:31.160
 So like evolution created creatures that are basically functioning way outside of what

15:31.160 --> 15:32.160
 the physical reality is.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
 Okay.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
 Now I got this.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.160
 I got this.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.160
 Okay.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.160
 Because there's a lot to unpack here and I ate all of it.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.160
 All right.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.160
 Okay.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.160
 First of all, no, no, I'm serious.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.780
 First of all, when you were making that comment about how, you know, reason is a superpower

15:44.780 --> 15:48.760
 beyond limit, you're being ironic, but it's true.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.960
 And I'll give you one example, which is astronomy.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.960
 If you look at the physical size of the universe, it's literally in one sense incomprehensible.

15:55.960 --> 16:00.480
 So he's right in the sense that I do not understand and none of us understand what it means for

16:00.480 --> 16:02.400
 93 million miles away for the sun to be.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.240
 It makes no, it's a number on another screen, right?

16:05.240 --> 16:11.000
 That said, the fact that my mind, and I'm not one of the great thinkers of all time,

16:11.000 --> 16:19.160
 he's capable, yet there, is capable of appreciating what the sun means, what heliocentrism means.

16:19.160 --> 16:23.680
 The fact that we can, you know, you're a math person, that you could look at galaxies and

16:23.680 --> 16:31.120
 reduce it to 10 to the 64th power in terms of distance, that shows the unlimited capacity

16:31.120 --> 16:32.720
 of the human mind and reason.

16:32.720 --> 16:40.560
 Number one, number two is if he says that evolution favors those who are not in touch

16:40.560 --> 16:43.880
 with reality, and I don't know in what context he's saying that because that sentence could

16:43.880 --> 16:50.880
 mean a lot of different things, evolution is what guides, reality is what guides evolution.

16:50.880 --> 16:56.680
 Evolution works because you are fitted to the reality of the situation around you.

16:56.680 --> 17:01.360
 It's not that someone is sitting down and says, well, I'm going to add a fin to this

17:01.360 --> 17:05.720
 animal and that fin helps it swim, swim, I engineer a check mark.

17:05.720 --> 17:11.880
 It's that mutations occur, the vast majority of mutations are against reality, they do

17:11.880 --> 17:17.320
 not further this animal's life or this plant's life or this fungus's life, but the ones that

17:17.320 --> 17:23.960
 are in touch with reality such as, okay, it's really cold here, there's no predators here,

17:23.960 --> 17:28.320
 if I could figure out, and I'm using that term very loosely, a way where I could survive

17:28.320 --> 17:31.600
 in the cold, I don't have predation, it's really great.

17:31.600 --> 17:38.840
 So the fact that unconsciously and mindlessly this process can force the mutation and evolution

17:38.840 --> 17:42.040
 of the form precisely means that they're in touch with reality.

17:42.040 --> 17:47.000
 Now if he means the consciousness is not in touch with reality, that's another thing

17:47.000 --> 17:48.400
 that I really hate.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.240
 You're referring to the reality as like the biological reality of evolution, but all

17:52.240 --> 17:57.680
 of that is based on many other layers of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics underneath

17:57.680 --> 18:01.760
 it all, and he's saying somewhere along the layers, you start to lose more and more and

18:01.760 --> 18:02.760
 more attachment to the actual.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.920
 How about one more second?

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
 Sure, sure.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.120
 I do not, I despise the idea.

18:08.120 --> 18:13.200
 I say despise, I'm not using this, I'm not joking, the idea that the reality we don't

18:13.200 --> 18:17.080
 live in is somehow more real than this.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.920
 That is a very dangerous idea to say, well, quantum works in this way and I'm sure he's

18:20.920 --> 18:23.880
 correct and none of us disagree with that.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.200
 But we perceive macro works in a different way, well, that's the real reality and this

18:28.200 --> 18:30.320
 is fake, bullshit.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.840
 This is the real reality.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.560
 That is a different type of a subset, but no one's living there.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.720
 And humanity is the starting point.

18:37.720 --> 18:41.760
 It's a subset that has to integrate with this world.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.480
 There isn't two worlds, one in the quantum world and one here, they're integrated.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.040
 Now we might not have the scientific knowledge to know how they're integrated, but so what?

18:49.040 --> 18:52.360
 We know that there's only one reality and that's this one.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.440
 He has this difference.

18:53.440 --> 19:00.320
 He says evolution matches up to fitness not to reality and he creates this dichotomy between

19:00.320 --> 19:03.440
 fitness and reality, but that's complete nonsense.

19:03.440 --> 19:09.000
 There is no such thing as a concept of fitness outside of fitness to what?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.640
 To reality.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.080
 Fitness and reality are the same thing, they're not separate things.

19:14.080 --> 19:21.120
 So the whole way he sets this up intellectually is wrong, I think to some extent dishonest

19:21.120 --> 19:23.040
 and certainly philosophically corrupt.

19:23.040 --> 19:28.920
 And it's Kantian, again, he's accepted Kant's ideas and everybody pretty much has accepted

19:28.920 --> 19:33.240
 Kant's ideas for the last 200 years and they give it a different facade and he's giving

19:33.240 --> 19:37.360
 it an evolutionary facade, but it's just a facade for the same idea and that is that

19:37.360 --> 19:43.560
 somehow because we have eyes, we cannot see because the light waves are going through

19:43.560 --> 19:46.440
 a medium and that medium necessarily distorted.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.640
 The medium changes the resolution at which you see, right?

19:49.640 --> 19:53.120
 Like if I take off my glasses, I'm seeing it a little differently, but the thing is

19:53.120 --> 19:56.520
 still there and the thing is still there in the way I see it because the handle, I'm

19:56.520 --> 19:58.840
 grasping the handle and lifting the cup.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
 That's not an illusion.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.920
 That is a real cup.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.280
 So do you think some things are more real than others?

20:03.280 --> 20:09.440
 For example, money, there's a bunch of things that seem real, this is not an animal farm

20:09.440 --> 20:10.440
 reference.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.440
 Is this going to be about love?

20:11.440 --> 20:15.000
 There's nothing as real as love, right Lex?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.240
 What is love?

20:16.240 --> 20:21.880
 Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics, yes, no, no, no, no.

20:21.880 --> 20:27.920
 Is there some things that have become reality because we humans in a collective sense believe

20:27.920 --> 20:28.920
 it?

20:28.920 --> 20:30.360
 You can't believe something collectively.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.000
 Now it doesn't become real.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.800
 What does it mean to say something's real?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.880
 That is you can, so love for example, it loves a good example, right?

20:36.880 --> 20:38.680
 Love is an abstraction, right?

20:38.680 --> 20:42.440
 It's not something I can touch, it's not something I can see, but it's certainly something you

20:42.440 --> 20:43.440
 could feel.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.120
 I can't, right?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.120
 We love differently.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.120
 I don't think that's true.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
 I think I have to start honest about it.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
 I can't get love.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.200
 You can't, love is an abstraction.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
 So is it love real?

20:54.200 --> 20:56.480
 Yes, it's real because I feel it.

20:56.480 --> 21:00.440
 It's an existent, but it's not an existent in the same sense as this cup is.

21:00.440 --> 21:07.920
 So abstractions are real, but at the end of the day, all abstractions have to be able

21:07.920 --> 21:14.640
 to be reduced to actual concrete so that you can either see it.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.240
 I really don't like criticizing someone whose work I haven't read secondhand.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.400
 So I want to take this away from speaking about him personally because I'm not familiar

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
 with his work.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.000
 He is a nice guy.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
 That makes me like him.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
 No, I meant him.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
 That makes him like him less.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.120
 Now you're back talking about fitness, evolutionary fitness.

21:31.120 --> 21:39.360
 I think there's disingenuousness when we talk about the word real in terms of ideas

21:39.360 --> 21:45.400
 are real versus the cup is real, and you try to switch back between those two meanings,

21:45.400 --> 21:50.600
 and it's a little bit of linguistic wordplay that is trying to force a point that's not

21:50.600 --> 21:53.440
 accurate, in my opinion.

21:53.440 --> 21:59.080
 I think the issue is, and what he's challenging is, and what Kant is challenging is, do we

21:59.080 --> 22:01.280
 know reality?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.320
 And I think the answer is yes, we do.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.320
 We know reality.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.320
 We observe it.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.720
 Now, do we know everything about reality?

22:07.720 --> 22:12.720
 No, we can't, for example, sense what a bat senses as reality.

22:12.720 --> 22:18.880
 A bat observes reality through sound waves, through sonar.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.640
 So it has a different sense, but it's the same reality.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.880
 It's still a table.

22:22.880 --> 22:28.200
 The bat's spatial relationship to the table is different than ours, but the object is

22:28.200 --> 22:29.200
 still the same object.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.240
 But how do you know that's true?

22:31.240 --> 22:34.320
 Are you not just hoping that's true, or assuming that's true?

22:34.320 --> 22:35.960
 That's what no means.

22:35.960 --> 22:39.720
 No means I have identified an aspect of reality.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.880
 That's literally definition of knowledge.

22:41.880 --> 22:46.320
 Now if you say, how are you certain, well, that's a whole other question, but one of

22:46.320 --> 22:50.360
 the reasons I know it was certain is because this happens, and I know this is going to

22:50.360 --> 22:51.360
 happen.

22:51.360 --> 22:55.720
 And if I tell you, if you go downstairs, you're going to see Mr. Jones, and you walk

22:55.720 --> 23:00.160
 downstairs, and I see Mr. Jones, at the very least, you know, something's going on there.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.720
 So what about all the things that mess with our perception?

23:02.720 --> 23:07.080
 For example, we've talked about psychedelics before, talked about in dreams, or detached

23:07.080 --> 23:12.040
 from this, I mean, there's certain things that happen to your brain to where you're

23:12.040 --> 23:13.040
 not able to perceive.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.400
 So you're not perceiving reality.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
 That's right.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.720
 So your brain is creating a different reality.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
 It's not real.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
 That's...

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
 How do you know it's not real?

23:19.720 --> 23:21.240
 How do you know the elves will meet in the...

23:21.240 --> 23:25.680
 Because I need it, because partially because I need to take a drug in order to do it.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.560
 Because I'm asleep when I'm dreaming.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.560
 It's not reality.

23:29.560 --> 23:33.560
 That is clearly a creation of our mind.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
 It's not a...

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
 Hold on.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.560
 Let's get to psychedelics.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
 The drug is real.

23:37.560 --> 23:38.560
 Okay.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.560
 If you are...

23:39.560 --> 23:40.560
 I'm not...

23:40.560 --> 23:42.240
 I think you're going to be thinking I'm joking a lot more than I am this episode.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.960
 I'm going to be the humorous subjectivist.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.840
 He could be the court jester.

23:47.840 --> 23:53.680
 In terms of psychedelic, when people are perceiving these elves, these machine elves as other entities,

23:53.680 --> 23:57.240
 whether they are... they could either be real or not, I don't know.

23:57.240 --> 24:02.880
 But the point is that doesn't go to his broader point, because if these beings exist, and

24:02.880 --> 24:06.760
 the only way to perceive them is to take a drug, they still exist.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.760
 This is just...

24:07.760 --> 24:14.320
 It's for example, if I'm walking outside in the woods at night, and there's a deer,

24:14.320 --> 24:18.160
 and I can't see it, but if I put on night vision goggles, I can see it, that deer was

24:18.160 --> 24:19.640
 there the entire time.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.840
 It's not that the night vision goggles caused the deer to appear.

24:22.840 --> 24:28.200
 You can recreate it not only using night vision goggles, but you can then use sonar.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.880
 You can use other mechanisms by which to prove that the deer is there.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.680
 The thing with psychedelics is that...

24:33.680 --> 24:38.680
 Now, I don't know, because maybe I'm the least experienced with psychedelics here, probably.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.680
 My guess is every time you take the psychedelic, you have exactly the same experience of the

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
 deer.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.680
 No.

24:43.680 --> 24:48.040
 Second, are there other mechanisms, other scientific mechanisms by which I can find

24:48.040 --> 24:50.920
 a deer out there other than the psychedelics?

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
 We don't know yet.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.600
 Well, we don't know yet.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.560
 But this is Arkham's razor, right?

24:56.560 --> 25:02.360
 The simplest explanation here is the most likely, and that is that you've taken something

25:02.360 --> 25:05.720
 that's messing with the chemical in the brain, something is being...

25:05.720 --> 25:07.080
 Your brain can project.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.080
 We dream.

25:08.080 --> 25:12.520
 Nobody's arguing that the dream is real and reality's not, or if they are, I think they're

25:12.520 --> 25:13.520
 nuts.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.400
 The dream is a dream.

25:15.400 --> 25:20.720
 Your brain is creating an image of telling you a story.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.200
 It's assimilating the same thing.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.240
 That's probably what's going on until there's evidence to the contrary.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
 Well, hold on.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.440
 I'm going to disagree with you a little bit, because let's take Adderall, for example.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
 No one here disagrees.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.600
 That could have something much more simpler than, unless, you know, out of this world.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.760
 I think what he might be speaking to, I know Joe Rogan talks about this and other people

25:37.760 --> 25:41.200
 in this space, is that when you take certain drugs, it changes your perception.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.600
 It doesn't have to be otherworldly.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.120
 It changes your perception of what's around you.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.200
 And as an example, what they talk about is that three of us are talking.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.880
 There's lots of other stuff in the room.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.000
 We're only aware of it vaguely on a personal level.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
 So let me finish.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
 Let me finish.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
 Hold on.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
 Let me finish.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
 No, I don't do that.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
 I'm Israeli.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
 You're about to start.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
 This is back to the desert island of murder.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.840
 No, but we just resolved it within three seconds.

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
 We didn't.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.240
 There's no, there's no punk.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.480
 He's trying to get us.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.480
 Yeah, it's not going to happen.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.480
 I'm trying.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.480
 Exactly.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
 I'm trying to create murder.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.480
 No one has asthma.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.480
 It's going to be fine.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.720
 Because if the two of you murder each other, there's more food for me.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.720
 There's no.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.560
 You're all, you broke, broke on the alcohol.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.560
 Waitings would go up.

26:17.560 --> 26:18.560
 You or ship would go up.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.560
 For the ratings.

26:19.560 --> 26:20.560
 Yeah.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.480
 But if you take, for example, Adderall or speed, right?

26:22.480 --> 26:25.680
 People like you focus on things, you perceive things that aren't there.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.840
 But that doesn't mean those things weren't there to begin with.

26:27.840 --> 26:32.320
 There are absolutely ways to change human perception chemically through glasses, through

26:32.320 --> 26:33.720
 getting drunk.

26:33.720 --> 26:37.280
 None of that changes the fact that the reality underneath it is real and is causing this

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
 effect.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.280
 Absolutely.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.280
 And it has a particular nature, right?

26:40.280 --> 26:43.120
 And all it's doing is changing the focus, right?

26:43.120 --> 26:45.400
 So if I take off my glasses, I'm seeing the same thing.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.000
 I'm just seeing some things out of focus.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.240
 And maybe in a distance, I can't see something.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.240
 It just, it's gone.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.240
 And then I put it on.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.240
 There it is.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.360
 That thing was always there.

26:53.360 --> 26:57.680
 It's just my, the sensitivity I have to it has changed.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.720
 And it's absolutely not sensitive to everything equally.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.840
 And drugs can change the relative sensitivities.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.040
 It doesn't change reality.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.640
 It changes our ability to focus on reality.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.320
 Let me give you one great example.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.440
 The microscope.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.440
 I forget who it was.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.880
 His name was with an L. The scientist who discovered it.

27:16.880 --> 27:21.400
 He had a drop of water and he's seeing monsters, the protozoa in this drop of water.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.560
 For him, it must have been, it is like a drug experience.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.560
 Like, wait a minute.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
 I'm drinking this.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.280
 And there's alien beings whose shapes are completely crazy in this water.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.520
 Those beings were always there.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.000
 Those beings were there before any of us were here.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.840
 They've been there for billions of years.

27:33.840 --> 27:37.800
 But because he had this apparatus, now he's able to see protozoa.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.960
 No one's arguing protozoa are extra dimensional.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.640
 No one's arguing the supernatural.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.400
 Amoebas are well studied, paramecia, all the other lots.

27:44.400 --> 27:48.680
 So if these elves, the machine elves are real, and the only way to perceive them is

27:48.680 --> 27:53.360
 through DMT or something like that, that doesn't contradict the broader point that they've

27:53.360 --> 27:54.560
 always been there.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.400
 And this is the mechanism for perceiving them.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.560
 So here's the word I was looking for.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.920
 It's a word actually Greg, Greg taught me this.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.000
 So Greg Salamiere.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.960
 So it's resolution, right?

28:03.960 --> 28:04.960
 So it's resolution.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.720
 My resolution changes with the glasses.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.600
 My resolution gets final with the microscope.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.280
 So there's probably some bacteria here on the table.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
 100%.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.280
 There's no doubt about it.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.280
 I don't see them.

28:15.280 --> 28:19.920
 So I need a microscope to not see them, but they're either there or they're not there.

28:19.920 --> 28:24.160
 And I have the tools to discover whether they are there or they're not there.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.000
 And that's called a microscope.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.760
 Now they could be even smaller beings that even with a microscope, I wouldn't be able

28:29.760 --> 28:30.760
 to define.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.760
 But that's completely arbitrary to claim that, that they're there until I find a tool to

28:34.760 --> 28:36.080
 be able to discover it.

28:36.080 --> 28:41.240
 The same with what you see if you're seeing other beings when you're taking psychedelics.

28:41.240 --> 28:46.280
 Unless you find another tool to be able to see them with, the simplest assumption is

28:46.280 --> 28:47.880
 probably the truest assumption.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.520
 But even the not simplest assumption doesn't contradict the broader point.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
 No.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.960
 Which is, again, if it turns out that there are these creatures that you can only see

28:54.960 --> 28:58.800
 with psychedelics, and there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics.

28:58.800 --> 29:04.560
 And our resolution while we're not on psychedelics is not fine enough to observe them.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
 So what?

29:05.560 --> 29:11.000
 That doesn't change the fact that we evolved to survive in reality as it is.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.760
 What do you do with the possibility that our resolution as it currently stands is really,

29:14.760 --> 29:16.000
 really crappy?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
 That basically...

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
 Well, it's not.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.680
 But you don't know that.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.280
 No, we know it completely.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.280
 Compared to who?

29:22.280 --> 29:24.520
 Compared to the future possibilities, like artificial intelligence.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.520
 It is true.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.520
 It is crappy.

29:26.520 --> 29:27.520
 Compared to the future.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.520
 That's true.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.520
 But that's not relevant.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.520
 Much, much.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
 Or it's a magnitude.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.160
 But here I'll use the standard that Hoffman uses, evolution, right?

29:35.160 --> 29:39.880
 The reason I know that our resolution is phenomenal, is phenomenally good, right?

29:39.880 --> 29:42.080
 Because look at us.

29:42.080 --> 29:47.680
 We're sitting here comfortably in an apartment with air conditioning, in warm Austin with

29:47.680 --> 29:51.800
 microphones, and we're good at all this stuff.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.440
 Really good at survival and changing the environment.

29:54.440 --> 29:59.560
 Indeed, if you look at the species that we know of, there's not a species that come anywhere

29:59.560 --> 30:05.480
 close to our ability to deal with reality, to observe reality, to understand reality,

30:05.480 --> 30:06.480
 and to shape it.

30:06.480 --> 30:10.400
 The future, well, we'll come up with machines that can figure out stuff that we have no

30:10.400 --> 30:11.400
 clue about today.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.960
 Yeah, but that's only because we're so well suited to reality that can we create those

30:15.960 --> 30:16.960
 machines?

30:16.960 --> 30:20.520
 And I promise you, it's in the future, it's going to be much more what you're saying.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.520
 That's how it's going to happen.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.280
 No, but the thing is, when the creatures from the future look back to the things we're

30:24.280 --> 30:28.120
 saying now, what I ran is saying, what you're saying with certainty, do you think they'll

30:28.120 --> 30:32.520
 laugh at the level of how much confusion there was, how much inaccuracies?

30:32.520 --> 30:33.520
 No.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.520
 No, no.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.520
 Let me get this one.

30:35.520 --> 30:36.520
 What do they do?

30:36.520 --> 30:41.240
 They're going to do what you do when any of us read Aristotle or read any of these great

30:41.240 --> 30:42.240
 geniuses of the past.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.760
 It's like, these people didn't have electricity.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.680
 They didn't have warm clothes or anything, and they're able to figure out the diameter

30:49.680 --> 30:55.720
 of the earth, the creativity to be, and to get it within a few miles, the creativity

30:55.720 --> 30:59.400
 and to figure out the speed of light when you don't even have a stopwatch.

30:59.400 --> 31:03.320
 When you look back, a lot of it's nonsense, but at the same, it's like when you're talking

31:03.320 --> 31:09.520
 to a kid, you disregard the nonsense, and when they get something right, it's awe.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.000
 It's never a numbers game.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.760
 It's the few that validate and justify the rest.

31:16.760 --> 31:20.760
 When you look at Aristotle, and he's talking about the, there was one of those causes which

31:20.760 --> 31:24.200
 is time travel, and it doesn't really make sense, but you look at the rest of his stuff

31:24.200 --> 31:29.160
 or even played or any of these greats, it's like, oh my, this is an amazing miracle.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.600
 I wouldn't say literally miracle, I got you everyone, but at the same time, a lot of these

31:32.600 --> 31:34.320
 other people had stupid ideas.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
 You don't care.

31:35.320 --> 31:41.040
 You care about those great, great minds and how they moved us all forward to this day.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.040
 We still study Pythagoras.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.040
 Of course.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.320
 And it's not even just the sciences and the math.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.520
 Think about the philosophy.

31:48.520 --> 31:52.400
 How much is there to learn from reading Aristotle or Plato or Socrates when you disagree with

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
 them?

31:53.400 --> 31:57.120
 I mean, how many giants have there been in all of human history that have had the minds

31:57.120 --> 32:02.720
 of a Socrates, a Plato, and an Aristotle, a thousand years where they look back at Plato

32:02.720 --> 32:04.880
 and Aristotle and admire them?

32:04.880 --> 32:05.880
 Absolutely.

32:05.880 --> 32:10.960
 Well, they find certain things that are wrong, yes, but certain things that Aristotle discovered

32:10.960 --> 32:14.240
 are absolutely right and will always be right.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.680
 Certain things that I invented discovered will always be right.

32:16.680 --> 32:21.400
 I think a lot of what he came up with, well, some things would be discovered to be wrong.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
 Yeah.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.720
 You know, that wouldn't shock me.

32:24.720 --> 32:33.120
 But the genius and the truth of the we know today is amazing.

32:33.120 --> 32:38.620
 It's stunning to be pessimistic about us because in the future we'll know more.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.120
 Not pessimistic, but more humble.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.040
 There's no reason to be humble.

32:42.040 --> 32:45.800
 I mean, I really think humility is a vice, not a virtue.

32:45.800 --> 32:46.800
 What's it to be humble about?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.520
 Look at life.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
 This is amazing.

32:49.520 --> 32:52.440
 No, but the word humble has different meanings.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.440
 No, I know.

32:53.440 --> 32:59.600
 I was going to get, I was going to get, I mean, humility in a sense of, you know, humility

32:59.600 --> 33:08.840
 in a sense of not appreciating the genius and the ability and the success and all the

33:08.840 --> 33:16.080
 stuff that we as individuals, I think in our lives, but as a culture, as a movement, if

33:16.080 --> 33:19.800
 you think about movement in terms of those of us who respect reason, have achieved in

33:19.800 --> 33:24.520
 spite of the odds, we should be proud of that and pride is the virtue.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.640
 Humility in the sense of, yeah, I know there's more to know.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.480
 I know there's a lot more to know and in the future we'll know more.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.480
 Sure.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.480
 But I don't think that's the way.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.840
 See, I take humility as the way the Christians use it, which is the other way.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.840
 And I think it's a real vice.

33:37.840 --> 33:41.240
 It's don't think of yourself too much just because you can think, you know, that's not

33:41.240 --> 33:42.240
 a big deal.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.920
 Just because you can create this, it is a big deal.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.960
 Your achievements are a big deal and you should take credit for them.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.280
 So be careful with the word humility because the real meaning is the Christian meaning,

33:52.280 --> 33:54.800
 which is a very, very bad meaning.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.800
 Hold on.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.120
 Let me be a little pedantic because there's no such thing as real meaning, right?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.120
 So there's different meanings.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
 Okay, hold on.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.520
 This is semantics, but here's another real meaning that you're not going to disagree

34:03.520 --> 34:09.440
 with, which is the smartest person on earth is ignorant of 99.9% of knowledge, right?

34:09.440 --> 34:14.880
 So if I meet someone who is less intelligent than me and less informed than me, it is still

34:14.880 --> 34:18.480
 certain that this person has things to teach me.

34:18.480 --> 34:23.720
 If I go to a mechanic and maybe this guy is dumb as rocks, I don't know anything about

34:23.720 --> 34:24.720
 cars.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.320
 What he tells me about that car is that I could take it to the bank.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.520
 He's going to be in a position to inform me.

34:29.520 --> 34:34.600
 So one of the reasons humility is extremely important is very often you have people and

34:34.600 --> 34:39.360
 you see this very much in academia who think, you know, we're exactly wrong going around,

34:39.360 --> 34:41.080
 who think they're know it all.

34:41.080 --> 34:46.280
 And they think, oh, I have this degree, you're a layman, you've never been formally educated.

34:46.280 --> 34:49.680
 Therefore not only you dumb and uneducated and you're wrong.

34:49.680 --> 34:54.200
 And it's like, this person might be have, one, a great example of this, and this is an example

34:54.200 --> 34:58.720
 you never mind that like, is a lot of times you have these native populations and they'll

34:58.720 --> 35:03.160
 have a better understanding of the animals around them, the plants, the fruits, whatever,

35:03.160 --> 35:06.200
 and you'd have these scientists and be like, oh, they're talking about this monster in

35:06.200 --> 35:07.200
 the woods.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.200
 Yeah, whatever.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.200
 This giant, this giant ape.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
 But it was real.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.200
 Yeah.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.320
 But, you know, you dismiss them because, oh, these are stupid, ignorant, whatever people.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.520
 That's kind of changed to some extent, but that is an aspect of humility that I think

35:17.520 --> 35:22.840
 behooves especially highly intelligent people because there is such a presumption to be

35:22.840 --> 35:27.160
 dismissive of people who you regard as less than, but they're often right.

35:27.160 --> 35:31.440
 So I agree with all of the concrete examples.

35:31.440 --> 35:34.000
 I just think we should come up with a better word than humility.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.800
 And I don't have one because I'm not a wood smith, I'm not, this is not my strength.

35:38.800 --> 35:45.960
 But humility is a word from the Christian ethics, and it means something very specific

35:45.960 --> 35:54.200
 in the field of ethics, and it means the opposite of what I think virtue requires.

35:54.200 --> 36:01.080
 It's the meaning, it's to put you down, it's to resist pride, and I think pride is a very

36:01.080 --> 36:02.080
 important thing.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.080
 I don't know, Iran.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
 But again, you have to define your terms properly.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.080
 Hating myself has been quite useful for me as a...

36:08.080 --> 36:10.840
 Well, but that's because you're Russian and Jewish.

36:10.840 --> 36:11.840
 So by...

36:11.840 --> 36:12.840
 What?

36:12.840 --> 36:15.840
 This changes everything.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.000
 This is what happens, right?

36:17.000 --> 36:21.040
 We're brought up to feel exactly that way.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.800
 That has been a good Russian boy.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
 So we got him.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.800
 Oh my God.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.800
 What is this?

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
 What is this?

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
 What is this?

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
 What is this?

36:28.800 --> 36:29.800
 What is this?

36:29.800 --> 36:30.800
 What is this?

36:30.800 --> 36:31.800
 What is this?

36:31.800 --> 36:32.800
 What is this?

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
 What is this?

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
 What is this?

36:34.800 --> 36:35.800
 What is this?

36:35.800 --> 36:36.800
 What is this?

36:36.800 --> 36:39.620
 What is this coscia?

36:39.620 --> 36:43.480
 Did you check if it's coscia?

36:43.480 --> 36:44.600
 This is Ukrainian, my friend.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.600
 Oh.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.600
 Oh my God.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.600
 That is a sin.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
 I'm not gonna scare you.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.600
 That is really sinful.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.200
 You know me, you didn't say I was born in the same town.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.200
 Okay.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.200
 My dad is Ukrainian.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.200
 Don't get mad.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.200
 So...

36:55.200 --> 36:56.200
 I don't think...

36:56.200 --> 36:57.700
 I don't think self...

36:57.700 --> 36:58.700
 Self...

36:58.700 --> 36:59.700
 What did you...

36:59.700 --> 37:00.700
 How did you define it?

37:00.700 --> 37:01.700
 You...

37:01.700 --> 37:02.700
 Self hate?

37:02.700 --> 37:03.700
 Yeah, I think...

37:03.700 --> 37:05.200
 I think Self hate is quite destructive.

37:05.200 --> 37:13.200
 I think that humility is quite destructive. Humility in the sense of I'm no big deal. No,

37:13.200 --> 37:16.800
 I mean, if you've achieved something in life, you are a big deal. You are a big deal because,

37:16.800 --> 37:21.480
 you know, look, you got the two of us to fly into town just to sit down here and have a

37:21.480 --> 37:25.960
 conversation with you. You're a big deal. That says more about you than me. We're just

37:25.960 --> 37:37.520
 we're lonely to pray. I'm starting to question your ability to reason with the decisions

37:37.520 --> 37:43.560
 you're making. What on the on the aspect of and I should mention that the idiot by Dusty

37:43.560 --> 37:47.480
 Eskies is one of my favorite novels. And there is a Christian ethic that runs through that.

37:47.480 --> 37:52.320
 I mean, because because yeah, I mean, particularly, but I hate to bring this up,

37:52.320 --> 37:56.200
 but particularly Russians and particularly Russian Jews and particularly Eastern European Jews

37:56.200 --> 38:02.440
 are incredibly Christian. There is a there's a there's a real Christian theme in in Judaism

38:02.440 --> 38:10.920
 that's that's about guilt. Guilt is not there's no guilt in Judaism. David doesn't feel any guilt

38:10.920 --> 38:16.400
 Solomon does. There's no guilt in the Old Testament. Plenty of guilt. Once Christianity has an

38:16.400 --> 38:20.840
 impact on Judaism, we're raised to feel this way. We're raised to be humble. We're raised not to

38:20.840 --> 38:28.000
 feel special. We were raised to think we're no big deal into and our mothers put us down and use

38:28.000 --> 38:32.520
 that against us and try to inflict guilt on us. They raise us up and then they knock us down.

38:32.520 --> 38:38.240
 It's a mechanism, but it's a cultural mechanism. And I think it's very destructive to self

38:38.240 --> 38:41.960
 esteem and to happiness. And I'll give you a great he's absolutely right with what he just said.

38:41.960 --> 38:46.920
 I disagree. Well, yeah, why? Why is he right? Because like my family, for example,

38:46.920 --> 38:50.080
 it still doesn't really understand how I could pay the rent because I don't go into an office.

38:50.080 --> 38:55.720
 And like when I started out trying to be a writer, the immediate reaction isn't which is a lot of

38:55.720 --> 39:00.600
 times I talk to kids, right? And they won't have these aspirations and I'll tell them go for it

39:00.600 --> 39:06.320
 while you're young. If you fail, you'll go to your grave with like I tried my best. I didn't make

39:06.320 --> 39:10.760
 it happen. Whereas if you don't try and never achieve, you are going to feel horrible for the

39:10.760 --> 39:15.800
 rest of your life. And this is the example I use all the time. I bring up many times I go go to

39:15.800 --> 39:20.240
 any bookstore and look at all those terrible, terrible books on the shelves that you wonder,

39:20.240 --> 39:24.600
 how's this a book? That could be you. You could be that crappy writer. But the thing is in that

39:24.600 --> 39:28.480
 culture that Yaron was talking about, you tell your family, I'm going to be a writer. Who do you

39:28.480 --> 39:32.000
 think you are? Why do you think you're going to be you? You're no Stephen King. And it's like,

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
 why do you have to be Stephen King? Why can't you just be a mediocre, crappy writer making the rent?

39:37.000 --> 39:41.120
 It's the best that you can be. But even that is an amazing accomplishment. If I don't have to go to

39:41.120 --> 39:45.560
 an office and I write books that not that many people read, this is a story of my life, at the same

39:45.560 --> 39:50.920
 time, I do have pride because I made this happen. You can be the best version. I mean, this is a

39:50.920 --> 39:55.600
 cliche, but you can be the best version of yourself. It's not a competition. And yet our Jewish

39:55.600 --> 40:01.320
 mothers, that's not what they aspire us to be. They aspire us to be the best version of what they

40:01.320 --> 40:06.640
 imagine, what the culture imagines, you know, what what what what society imagine, not what not

40:06.640 --> 40:12.440
 what it's not about you in their minds. And and I've seen it, I see, I see it all around me,

40:12.440 --> 40:17.160
 people putting their kids down, putting themselves down. It's not healthy. I've never

40:17.160 --> 40:22.600
 told the story. I'm going to tell it now. When I graduated college, I was a temp for a while,

40:22.600 --> 40:26.760
 because I didn't know what I wanted to do. Right. And when you're a temp, it's like playing roulette.

40:26.760 --> 40:31.760
 You're going to have jobs that pay well, that suck, and pay well that are great, or that are great,

40:31.760 --> 40:37.280
 that don't pay well and suck and pay poorly. But it's you and your 21, you have that that kind

40:37.280 --> 40:43.000
 of space. And my grandmother was talking to her brother, you know, he's talking about his kids,

40:43.000 --> 40:48.720
 she's talking about me, she's, you know, from Odessa. And she told me she lied to him about how

40:48.720 --> 40:53.160
 much money I was making. And that's something I've never brought up. And it still hurts me,

40:53.160 --> 41:01.120
 because it's like, your approval of me should be a function of my character, my happiness,

41:01.120 --> 41:07.320
 and the fact that you feel ashamed over how much money I'm making, especially at this point in

41:07.320 --> 41:13.560
 my life, I thought was very really misplaced priorities. Yeah, absolutely. I don't know.

41:13.560 --> 41:21.400
 I don't know what to make of that. I think there's a huge benefit to the humility terms aside for

41:21.400 --> 41:26.480
 believing that others can teach you a lot. Everybody can teach you a lot. I just mentioned

41:26.480 --> 41:32.040
 that. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. The point. But for that, I do believe you have to not

41:32.040 --> 41:41.400
 constantly sort of break your ego apart and constantly question whether you know anything

41:41.400 --> 41:46.800
 about this world and sort of there's a negativity with it that that I think is very useful. And

41:46.800 --> 41:53.000
 it's also very fulfilling just constantly. I don't know. It's the other way around. I find

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
 that the more the more I know, the more I know, the easier it is for me to learn from other

41:59.000 --> 42:06.640
 people. The broader context I have, the more curious I become, the more areas I know, you

42:06.640 --> 42:11.200
 know, it's true that the more you know, the more areas you know, you don't know. And the more I

42:11.200 --> 42:15.800
 find myself attracted to people who can teach me something about things I don't know. Whereas,

42:15.800 --> 42:21.920
 if I was ignorant, if I truly believed I didn't know anything, I don't know how I would live.

42:21.920 --> 42:29.320
 It would really completely challenge everything about life for me. Where would I even start?

42:29.320 --> 42:34.120
 You wouldn't know where to start. So no, I think, and if you don't recognize what you know,

42:34.120 --> 42:39.640
 you don't have a full appreciation of yourself. So really building a recognition of what do I

42:39.640 --> 42:46.880
 know? And how much do I know? It's really crucial to living. And I'll tell you something else that

42:46.880 --> 42:51.160
 furthers my life enormously is when you reach a certain point in your career and your life and

42:51.160 --> 42:55.800
 you're talking to people who are a lot younger, and they might be smart, driven, intelligent,

42:55.800 --> 42:59.480
 they lack data. When you're 23, you don't know how to speak corporate, you don't know what the

42:59.480 --> 43:04.560
 code words are. So if I am in a position to sit down with this kid and be like, do X, Y, and Z,

43:04.560 --> 43:08.800
 and here's why I'm coming to this conclusion. This is the information that released me this

43:08.800 --> 43:15.200
 conclusion. And I can save them from some of the suffering I went through. That is very gratifying.

43:15.200 --> 43:19.760
 It's making the world a better place. And it's also the opposite in a sense of humility because

43:19.760 --> 43:24.160
 like in this context, I'm an expert, or I'm at least knowledgeable enough that I'm comfortable

43:24.160 --> 43:28.440
 giving you advice. Yeah. And look, everything I do is about me knowing stuff that other people

43:28.440 --> 43:35.200
 don't. And I know a lot of stuff other people don't. And I do. And it's fun. It's I'm a teacher. I'm a

43:35.200 --> 43:39.680
 teacher at heart always happy. It turns out I didn't know that early on. But you know, I like

43:39.680 --> 43:44.080
 becoming an expert and then and then trying to teach people doesn't mean I know everything.

43:44.080 --> 43:49.040
 Quite the contrary. Again, the more I know, the more I know that the certain things I don't know

43:49.040 --> 43:53.320
 and the certain areas of expertise I don't have. But look, pride is a broader concept than that.

43:53.320 --> 43:59.240
 Pride is about and humility is the opposite of pride. And Christianity has that right. Pride is

43:59.240 --> 44:06.320
 about taking your life seriously. Pride is about wanting to be really good at living, wanting to

44:06.320 --> 44:11.360
 have the knowledge. And I think what you're describing is you're describing as I'm constantly

44:11.360 --> 44:16.440
 learning. Sometimes I have to read a challenge myself. I have to question what I believed in

44:16.440 --> 44:21.880
 to gain you knowledge. That's all good. But that is that is a drive that is driven by pride.

44:22.920 --> 44:28.280
 You want to know that lots of people out there that don't want to know because they don't have

44:28.280 --> 44:33.960
 that pride. They don't have that commitment to live, the commitment to achieving something.

44:33.960 --> 44:38.440
 And I'm going to say something else that I think is crucial. Humility is extremely important when

44:38.440 --> 44:43.800
 it comes to politics. Because if you feel comfortable telling someone you've never met,

44:43.800 --> 44:47.880
 how to live their life, that is a complete lack of humility.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.000
 Well, I lack it, obviously, because I tell people how to live all the time.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.160
 Not through the force. Not through force. That's what I'm saying.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.760
 Not and of course, not in the concrete. I don't tell them, you know, move to,

44:56.760 --> 45:01.480
 although I do tell them to do it often, but I don't tell them this is what you do as a profession.

45:01.480 --> 45:05.240
 But I give them the principles because I think they're making a choice. That's my point.

45:05.240 --> 45:10.680
 Politically, what I'm saying is it shows a lack of humility to be like, I've never met this person.

45:10.680 --> 45:15.640
 This is how I'm going to take money from him. But I don't see that humility. There's nothing.

45:15.640 --> 45:19.480
 No, it's the lack of humility. No, but it's not even a lack of humility because it's...

45:19.480 --> 45:21.880
 Who am I to tell him how to live? That's lack of humility.

45:22.520 --> 45:29.000
 No. Who are you to tell him how to live is an issue of, it's an issue of force and rights and

45:29.000 --> 45:33.720
 a bunch of different things. I don't think it's a lack of humility there. I think it's a lack of

45:33.720 --> 45:41.400
 being a human being. It could be both. Sure. I think it's, who gives you the right to dictate

45:41.400 --> 45:44.840
 to somebody else how to live their lives? Yeah, but that's a lack of humility if you think you

45:44.840 --> 45:50.120
 have that right. Again, we're using humility in a very different way. No, we're using the same way.

45:50.120 --> 45:56.280
 Because the person who feels comfortable, they think, I know, I know better than you how you

45:56.280 --> 46:00.680
 should live your life to the point where a couple forcing you because I know it's going to be best

46:00.680 --> 46:04.520
 for you in the long run. And the answer is you don't know. Right, but that's a lack of humility.

46:04.520 --> 46:09.320
 I think in your mind, you're on humility somehow tied to the Christian concept of humility. And

46:09.320 --> 46:13.000
 so you're kind of allergic to the word. Well, absolutely, because it's part of, if you look at

46:13.000 --> 46:20.680
 the cardinal virtues, the cardinal sins in Christianity, pride is a cardinal sin and humility

46:20.680 --> 46:26.360
 is a cardinal virtue. But they don't mean it in the sense because they're happy to tell you how

46:26.360 --> 46:31.480
 to live. They're happy to be philosopher kings over your life and they believe that's being humble.

46:31.480 --> 46:35.480
 And you should be humble, by the way, in listening to the Pope or listening to God,

46:35.480 --> 46:39.640
 because what do you know? You know nothing. God knows everything. So you should shut up

46:39.640 --> 46:43.800
 and do what you're told. That's the sense in which I don't think you should be humble.

46:43.800 --> 46:48.920
 I mean, it's a sense in which I was using the example of Abraham. God comes to Abraham and says,

46:48.920 --> 46:56.200
 go kill your eldest son, your only son. Go kill him. It's like, and what does Abraham

46:56.200 --> 47:02.360
 do? He says, yes, sir, I'll follow. And he's a moral hero for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

47:02.360 --> 47:07.400
 He's a moral hero because he follows orders because he's humble. I would tell God to go to hell.

47:08.840 --> 47:14.520
 Screw you. I'm not killing my son. He's no way. I mean, he killed his sons. That's only fair.

47:14.520 --> 47:19.240
 Well, this is before he kills us. I didn't know that. But no, but part of the evil,

47:19.240 --> 47:24.360
 part of the evil of Christianity is that he's killed his son in the most torturous form of

47:24.360 --> 47:30.120
 death possible. I mean, the whole story of Jesus is one of the most immoral, unjust stories ever told,

47:30.120 --> 47:34.200
 and that Christians elevate this to a position of, I'd love to have this conversation with

47:34.200 --> 47:39.080
 Jordan, right? Jordan Peterson, the idea of elevating. That'll never happen. No, it won't.

47:39.080 --> 47:44.280
 But elevating Jesus, exactly, elevating Jesus to a superhero status for one of the most immoral

47:44.280 --> 47:51.000
 acts in human history is horrific. So yeah, I mean, I'm opposed to God sacrificing his own son,

47:51.000 --> 47:55.160
 never mind my son. Let him go do it to his own son. But he didn't kill Isaac. He killed the goat.

47:55.160 --> 48:00.440
 The story's about Abraham, not about God. First of all, God is mean, right, to put Abraham through

48:00.440 --> 48:07.240
 that. But Abraham has to assume that he's going to kill his son and he lifts his, he's going to do it.

48:07.240 --> 48:13.080
 And he stopped. So the whole point is obedience. That's what humility leads to. It leads to the

48:13.080 --> 48:17.320
 opposite of the story you were telling. It leads to people saying, yes, I should be told what to do.

48:17.320 --> 48:22.280
 Where's the authority who actually knows something? I don't know anything. No, I know a lot. And I

48:22.280 --> 48:27.160
 know a lot about my life. So you stay away from my life because I have pride in my life.

48:27.160 --> 48:31.000
 The science is settled, right? Look at these experts. Who am I to argue with these experts?

48:31.000 --> 48:34.680
 They tell me to drink dog pee. I'm going to drink, what am I, not drink dog pee?

48:34.680 --> 48:38.840
 Yes. Let's go back to the island. We're on island again.

48:39.720 --> 48:44.520
 Back to the island. And let's go to the island. Let's, let's,

48:44.520 --> 48:51.400
 I live on an island. Everything's an island in some context. Like Earth is an island.

48:51.400 --> 48:57.000
 This universe is an island in a multiverse. There's no multiverses. There's only one universe.

48:57.000 --> 49:04.280
 All right. So let's invite Jordan Peterson to this island. You wish. Hold on. Hold on a sec.

49:05.000 --> 49:12.280
 Hey girl. What's you doing? Lex? Lex Friedman? Look him up. Lex who?

49:12.280 --> 49:16.840
 Lex who? I don't know. Lex says he's big of a following almost as Jordan.

49:17.720 --> 49:21.880
 I know, I know Jordan. I know his family actually through Jim Keller,

49:21.880 --> 49:27.320
 who is his relative. He's an engineer. So, and I just talked to Sam who

49:29.640 --> 49:33.720
 is perhaps a little bit aligned in some sense on your perspective on religion and so on.

49:34.280 --> 49:37.480
 So let me ask, is there some? Religion, yes, but other things.

49:37.480 --> 49:40.280
 Sam Harris. Sam Harris. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Sam Harris.

49:40.280 --> 49:44.920
 He's on first name relations with these guys. Look at this inside baseball. I just talked to Sam.

49:46.200 --> 49:50.040
 I thought, I thought, let's talk about humility. Let's talk about humility like my buddy Sam.

49:50.040 --> 49:55.320
 I was talking to Barack. You might know him. Yeah. I, I simply. You're gonna let you in out the window.

49:56.200 --> 50:03.000
 I'm just a natural language processing model that I assume that once I mentioned Jordan Peterson,

50:03.000 --> 50:07.400
 it becomes an obvious statement what Sam means. This is how neural networks think.

50:07.400 --> 50:12.600
 This is how robots think. Michael, you should know this. I thought by now you'd be a scholar.

50:14.600 --> 50:20.600
 For the sake of the audience. Humility. Everything can teach you something even a robot.

50:21.480 --> 50:29.800
 Okay. So do you think there's value in religion or broader? Do you think there's value in myth?

50:29.800 --> 50:33.960
 And as we've been talking about the value of reason, do you think it's possible to argue in

50:33.960 --> 50:40.360
 society as we grow this, the population of our little island that there's some value of common

50:40.360 --> 50:46.600
 myths, of common stories, of common religion? There was value. There is no value today.

50:47.480 --> 50:53.480
 So human beings need explanations, right? They need a philosophy to guide their life. They need

50:53.480 --> 50:59.720
 ethics. They need some explanation of what's going on in the world, right? And it's no accident

50:59.720 --> 51:06.280
 that the early religions had a river god and they had a sun god and a moon god because everything

51:06.280 --> 51:11.080
 they didn't understand, they made god, right? So they had multiple gods because they didn't

51:11.080 --> 51:17.640
 understand very much. As human understanding evolved, increased, as we knew reality more,

51:18.200 --> 51:22.520
 right? We came to the conclusion of, you know, this is very inefficient to have all these gods.

51:22.520 --> 51:27.000
 This is a genius of Judaism, right? Let's just have one bucket to put all the stuff we don't

51:27.000 --> 51:31.480
 know in and we'll call it one god. And then we don't, as we gain new knowledge, we can just take

51:31.480 --> 51:37.480
 it out of the bucket that's god and put it into the bucket of science. At some point, though,

51:38.840 --> 51:42.840
 at some point, and that point suddenly came during the scientific revolution, I think,

51:43.960 --> 51:48.920
 we could come to the conclusion that, no, we don't need this bucket that's called god to

51:48.920 --> 51:56.760
 explain the things that we don't know. We can say we don't know. And we're learning. And slowly,

51:56.760 --> 52:01.160
 the knowledge is increasing. And yet there's a lot more that we don't know. But we don't need

52:01.160 --> 52:07.000
 to throw it into some bucket that's called god in order to have it. And I think that's true

52:07.000 --> 52:11.720
 for morality and it's true for everything else, right? As we gain the tools to understand what

52:11.720 --> 52:16.920
 morality requires, we don't need a set of commandments. We can figure out morality from

52:16.920 --> 52:24.120
 human nature and from reality. So I don't think we need religion anymore. I think religion needed

52:24.120 --> 52:30.840
 to die probably about 200 years ago and was dying, I think, up until Kant. It seemed to be dying.

52:30.840 --> 52:36.040
 And one of Kant's missions, as he says, is to revive religion against the attack of reason

52:36.040 --> 52:39.640
 and enlightenment. Now, mythology is a little different because it depends what you mean by

52:39.640 --> 52:47.080
 mythology. Certainly, we need stories. And certainly, we need art. Art is a, Rand writes

52:47.080 --> 52:51.800
 about this a lot. And, you know, she's an artist and she writes in, I'm a huge fan of the Romantic

52:51.800 --> 52:58.600
 Manifesto, which I think is one of her underappreciated masterpieces. Oh, I hate it. Okay. Yeah.

52:58.600 --> 53:06.440
 So I think we have a real need, right, as a conceptual being. We have a need for aesthetic

53:06.440 --> 53:12.280
 experiences. We have a need to concretize abstractions, to concretize abstract ideas,

53:12.280 --> 53:16.360
 to concretize the complex nature of the world out there. And that's what painting, sculpture,

53:16.360 --> 53:22.840
 to some extent, music, but painting, sculpture, literature does for us. So to the extent that

53:22.840 --> 53:28.280
 mythology serves that purpose, it's just art, right? To the extent that it serves another

53:28.280 --> 53:33.080
 purpose, that is that it's a way for the gods to communicate with us or it fits some kind of

53:33.800 --> 53:38.440
 preexisting mental construct that we have, again, kind of a Kantian perspective, right,

53:38.440 --> 53:45.240
 that we have these categorical imperatives and this mythology links up to that.

53:45.240 --> 53:51.720
 Then I think it's false. It's not helpful and destructive. So I believe religion today

53:52.360 --> 53:55.800
 is a destructive force on planet Earth. I think it's always been a destructive force.

53:55.800 --> 54:00.360
 It was just a necessary force, right? You needed an explanation. People needed something to believe

54:00.360 --> 54:04.760
 in. Once you get philosophy and once you get philosophy that starts explaining real life,

54:04.760 --> 54:09.160
 real world, you don't need religion anymore and indeed it becomes a destructive force. And you

54:09.160 --> 54:15.560
 look around the world today, it's an unbelievably destructive force. Every way it touches is bad

54:15.560 --> 54:20.680
 for life. Again, mythology depends. Art is essential, very, very crucial in the human

54:20.680 --> 54:25.400
 existence. I mean, I'd love to hear what you think, but you don't see religion and philosophy and

54:25.400 --> 54:31.160
 mythology as just a continuous spectrum. Yeah. So religion is a primitive form of philosophy.

54:31.160 --> 54:33.240
 But I don't think... It's prephilosophical.

54:33.240 --> 54:39.560
 Where I thought Rand was going to go and he didn't go was that I think he... I agree with

54:39.560 --> 54:45.640
 what he's going to say. Rand was a mythologizer. In a certain specific context, Atlas shrugged

54:45.640 --> 54:50.120
 as a myth. It's one thing to sit down and say, these are the people who move us forward.

54:50.120 --> 54:54.200
 These are the values that are important. When you experience it through a story,

54:54.200 --> 55:00.680
 through a movie, through a TV show, a poem, or a painting, it affects you in a very visceral,

55:00.680 --> 55:04.840
 very different way. Talk about American history. You have the Founding Fathers,

55:04.840 --> 55:09.640
 then you have the myth of the Founding Fathers. Now, unfortunately, the term myth often means lie,

55:09.640 --> 55:15.960
 but it could mean, in a useful sense, an abstraction to help you systematize and

55:15.960 --> 55:21.880
 concretize ideas. So you have the myth of Reagan. You have the myth of Thatcher. The reality often

55:21.880 --> 55:27.320
 falls very short. But when you look at how these different figures are mythologized,

55:27.320 --> 55:33.080
 not only is it very inspirational on a personal level, very motivating on a personal level,

55:33.080 --> 55:38.440
 it's also a great way to concretize ideas because just how humans think. It's one thing to think

55:38.440 --> 55:43.640
 about ideas, but when you see someone who embodies these ideas, Miss America. I was saying earlier,

55:43.640 --> 55:47.720
 I had an asterisk on my show. These people might be jerks, but when you look at them,

55:47.720 --> 55:52.040
 one specific aspect of their life and you extrapolate it, that can be to anyone, very

55:52.040 --> 55:59.080
 motivating. And it's very important for people to have the belief that happiness and achievement

55:59.080 --> 56:03.240
 is possible because it's very hard to keep that in mind, especially if you're depressed,

56:03.240 --> 56:06.520
 if you're anxious, you're unemployed, you don't have a girlfriend, you think it's going to be like

56:06.520 --> 56:10.360
 this forever. And then you look at someone's story and they're like, you know what, that

56:10.360 --> 56:16.120
 astronaut of your Clayton Anderson, he applied 13 times, didn't get a callback, applied the 14th

56:16.120 --> 56:22.120
 time, got a callback, didn't get the job, 15th time he get the job, he talks to kids and he goes,

56:22.120 --> 56:28.440
 listen, apply 13 times. Even if you don't get the callback, you'll still feel I'm doing something

56:28.440 --> 56:33.400
 and having heard him and the myth of Clayton Anderson, this is going to tell people, yeah,

56:33.400 --> 56:39.240
 you know what, that could be me. Absolutely. And it's not just happiness. It's the fact that

56:39.240 --> 56:44.360
 virtue works, integrity. I mean, what's the power of the fontan? I know you love the fontan.

56:44.360 --> 56:51.720
 Part of the power of the fontan head is Howard Rock's absolute commitment to integrity.

56:51.720 --> 56:57.880
 He is committed to integrity and he gets, and he's happy, right? And it's very rare in life

56:58.760 --> 57:04.840
 to see that, to actually see a concrete of that. And it's very hard to hold it in your mind.

57:04.840 --> 57:09.640
 Yes, I'm going to be stuck in the quarry or I'm going to be stuck doing this horrible job. But

57:10.280 --> 57:14.040
 if I stick to my principles, I'm going to be Howard Rock. Now I've got that concrete. I

57:14.040 --> 57:21.560
 know I can, I can immediately relate to that success. So I think art is essential. And I think

57:21.560 --> 57:26.520
 in a sense what we do to Thatcher and Reagan is odd. You have to be careful in true stories,

57:27.400 --> 57:31.640
 not to diverge too far from reality. Because then when you discover the reality, you don't want to

57:31.640 --> 57:36.200
 whitewash it. And particularly when it has political implications, and then it's really bad. So

57:36.200 --> 57:39.000
 particularly with Reagan and Thatcher, you have to be careful because they want anyone

57:39.000 --> 57:45.080
 near as good as people try to make them out to be. But these, these are powerful, powerful, powerful

57:45.080 --> 57:51.320
 stories. And, and people are moved by it. And the integration of emotion with reason is crucial,

57:51.320 --> 57:57.480
 right? One of the, one of the goals to be happy is to bring your emotions in line with your thinking.

57:57.480 --> 58:02.120
 And I think that stories and art more broadly. And I, you know, when I go and see Michelangelo's

58:02.120 --> 58:08.680
 David, it does the same thing to me. You know, I can stand up to anybody because he did. And look,

58:08.680 --> 58:15.160
 he succeeded. And, and it makes sense that he could, right? So there's a really interesting idea

58:15.160 --> 58:20.040
 of bringing your emotion in line with your thinking, with your reasoning. So Ben Shapiro

58:20.040 --> 58:25.400
 famously has this saying, how do you like that transition, Michael? You gave me props. I know

58:25.400 --> 58:31.880
 you did. He's not Ben, it's Ben Shapiro. Yeah. Someone is not taking your calls. Benny, Benny.

58:31.880 --> 58:38.200
 I guess it's the daily don't take the caller. Back to the island with the murder. I think we

58:38.200 --> 58:44.920
 know, we would know who would be committing the murder. I have the suit for it. So he has the

58:44.920 --> 58:51.720
 saying of facts don't care about your feelings. And that always, I've always felt

58:53.000 --> 58:58.280
 badly about that statement somehow, like it was incomplete. So it's interesting to that you mention

58:59.000 --> 59:03.160
 bringing your emotions in line with your thinking. Like, what do you think about that statement?

59:03.160 --> 59:11.720
 I got this one. What Ben is doing, Ben, Ben, what he's doing in a loose way is attacking

59:11.720 --> 59:17.960
 Kantianism. Cause Kant, there's this, it's, it's almost impossible for Westerners who aren't schooled

59:17.960 --> 59:23.080
 in this to understand the idea of philosophical idealism. Cause it sounds so crazy that you're

59:23.080 --> 59:27.480
 like, these great minds of all time can't really be saying this. I must be missing something.

59:27.480 --> 59:33.560
 So the idea, when we hear idealism, we think John F. Kennedy, right? As an example, you aspire

59:33.560 --> 59:37.560
 things, you think life could be better than it is. That's not what it means in a philosophical

59:37.560 --> 59:45.400
 sense. And philosophical idealism, it means ideas are more real than reality. That I have this idea,

59:45.400 --> 59:51.080
 then this comes along. It's the reality that isn't correct. My idea is still correct. A good example

59:51.080 --> 59:55.720
 of this that you see all the time on the internet is when they refer to Mitt Romney and John McCain

59:55.720 --> 1:00:01.560
 as rhinos, Republicans in name only. And it's like, what is, who is more a real Republican?

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:07.800
 The nominee of the party, the senator, the governor of the party, or some person in your mind

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:13.240
 who has never existed and there's no evidence for them existing. So what Kant did is he bifurcated

1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:20.520
 reality into what we see around us, the phenomenal world, but then it's inferior. The real world,

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:27.400
 the noumenal world, we can't access it. Because we have eyes, we only see the thing as it appears,

1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:32.920
 not as it is in itself. And because of this, everything we know is a shadow and is secondary.

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:38.120
 And that's Plato. Straight out of Plato. Right. And the real reality is this realm of ideas.

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:42.760
 So when Ben is saying facts don't care about your feelings, what he is really saying is,

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:49.240
 reality comes first, your feelings have to be a response or a reaction to it. You can't say,

1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:54.520
 this is how I feel. This table doesn't care. You can yell at it all day long. It will still be

1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:59.320
 indifferent to your emotional state because it comes first. So it's a great statement. I think

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:04.440
 he's cribbing it from Ayn Rand in a sense. And I love it. There's a sense in which he is. I mean,

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:09.800
 who popularized that kind of idea? And Ben is read Ayn Rand quite extensively. Not enough.

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:14.440
 Not enough. Well, not enough to reference. That's where the yarmulke is. So yeah, obviously.

1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:23.560
 He may be read enough, but didn't understand enough. But so it's absolutely reality.

1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:30.440
 Reality is unaffected by your emotional state and your feelings about it. And this is a great

1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:35.960
 claim against the idealism, the philosophical idealism of much of the world out there, both left

1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:40.120
 and right. I think politically, culturally, the left and right are detached from reality.

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:45.000
 They live in a different dimension, in a different space that they are creating in their own minds

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:51.000
 that has nothing to do with the real world. And when they fail, they make stuff up to justify

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.680
 their failure. So all of really the ideas that are promulgated today on both sides

1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:07.080
 are this kind of detached from reality. We're putting emotions or ideas before reality itself.

1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:14.440
 But I believe that, you know, our emotions are responses. They're responses to reality conditioned

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:19.800
 by our existing concepts. You're going to have to talk slowly to talk emotions to Lex because he

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:25.080
 doesn't really understand. I don't understand. So really, you got to really... But he's big on love.

1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.280
 What is love? But he's big on love. He's trying to learn. He's pretty big on love. I'm all in,

1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:36.760
 I'm a love maximalist. I mean, we could create an environment on this island where you would

1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:45.560
 really feel emotions. Like fear is an emotion. We could easily call you to the point where you

1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:51.160
 felt fear, right? So we could teach him about emotions. But emotions are responses to reality.

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:55.320
 So some people, for example, you could take five different people and show them exactly the same

1:02:55.320 --> 1:03:00.440
 thing. And some of them would feel fear, and some of them would actually, you know, feel indifferent

1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:06.200
 and other people might feel love, right? I think Leonard Peacuff uses the example of looking through

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:12.760
 a microscope and seeing a, I don't know, a virus or bacteria. And for one, it's a scientist. He's

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:19.960
 made a new discovery. He feels pride and love. And, you know, the one has no clue, right? And

1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:23.320
 he's looking at this and it means nothing to them. And somebody else might look at it,

1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:27.320
 and, you know, it's a bacteria, you know, and they feel fear because of what it could do to them.

1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:33.240
 So it's conditioned by what you know, what your values are, and your level of knowledge,

1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:38.600
 and what the thing is out there in reality. And it's that into, so your emotions respond to that.

1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:49.000
 So aligning your emotions with your reason is making sure that your emotions are really conditioned

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.520
 by what you know explicitly versus what you've internalized implicitly that you might not agree

1:03:54.520 --> 1:04:00.040
 with anymore. You know, things might happen in your childhood, and they probably do,

1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:07.400
 right, where you get a trauma. I don't know. I'm afraid of dogs. And maybe when I was a

1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:12.360
 five year old, some dogs jumped me. And I don't even remember it, right? But I came to a conclusion

1:04:12.360 --> 1:04:18.040
 when I was five, dogs bad, dogs dangerous. And now anytime I see a dog, oh my God, that

1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:24.520
 bringing my emotions aligned with reality, right, with my ideas is, no, now I understand dogs don't

1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:30.600
 have to be scary. I can work through this, various techniques, and hopefully if there

1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:35.960
 is such a science of psychology, but in psychology to get you to the point where you can get rid

1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:41.240
 of that fear and align your emotion now with your explicit ideas. And that's what I mean by that.

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:44.920
 And let me build on that. We're talking about your friend, Putin. I think I mentioned this

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.560
 before, maybe on the show. He was meeting with Angela Merkel.

1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:48.360
 Oh, Vladimir, please.

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:52.200
 Yeah, Vlad. My boy, Vlad. He was meeting with Angela Merkel.

1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:57.720
 Angela Merkel has a fear of dogs. So he brought out his big Labrador retriever. Now for people

1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:01.800
 who don't know, Labradors are very big dogs, but they're also like the least aggressive.

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:05.400
 It's like you could punch them in the face. They don't care. That dog

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:11.560
 is not going to be more likely to attack just because she's scared. And it's kind of, I know

1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:15.560
 they say animals can sense fear domesticated dogs. If they see you're scared, they're not

1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:18.920
 going to be aggressive. They're going to try to play. I remember when I was a kid, I will never

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:23.800
 forget. There was this dog, Rex, this German Shepherd. I'm five. This dog is gigantic. And

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:26.840
 I'm sitting on the couch. The German Shepherds have been bred for intelligence. They're very

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.000
 bright dogs. They're very good with kids. He's sitting next to me. This thing is three times my

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:37.320
 size. He very gently puts his paw on my leg to be like, kid, like he can sense my fear. He's like,

1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:41.800
 I'm not going to do it. Like I want to be your friend. I'm still freaking out. He licks my hand

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:46.040
 is just very scary. You know, animals are so bright, but that's the thing is in terms of

1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:51.560
 facts don't care about your feelings. That dog is not more likely to attack someone

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:57.160
 because their emotion is so intense. It's not that I feel something very strongly.

1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:04.760
 Therefore, this thing is more likely to happen. So my intensity of my motion does not in any way

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:09.160
 correlate when you're being irrational to the likelihood of that thing actually happening.

1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:13.000
 No, you could have a dog that does respond to your emotion, right? But then it's,

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:19.240
 but then it's not part of reality. That's a fact of reality that certain dogs respond to certain

1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:26.120
 emotions. But isn't this emotion a part of reality? Like, okay, let me say a word. So part of that,

1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:30.920
 I would even say, don't let your emotion about your emotion, right? Because sometimes you have

1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:37.000
 an emotion about your emotion. Don't be repressed. Don't be repressed and identify the emotion as

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:43.880
 reality and evaluated. Don't judge it evaluated. Is it a rational emotion? Is it consistent with my,

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:49.000
 like if I'm afraid of these dogs, if I feel that fear, is it rational to be afraid of these dogs?

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.480
 But you're speaking to your own individual trajectory as a human being as you grow through

1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:57.240
 the world and try to understand reality and connect yourself to reason to reality. What

1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:07.480
 I'm talking about is a term like lived experience. When you observe and analyze the, you know,

1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:12.920
 conversations with other people to try to understand how other people see the world,

1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:19.000
 doesn't emotion fundamentally integrate into that? Like, is an emotion lived experience?

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:24.440
 So everybody experiences the same reality, but the way they experience it might be very different

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:28.680
 and that has to do with what? Doesn't have to do with... With their values, with their conclusions,

1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:33.080
 with their ideas, with their experiences, with a million different things. But at the end of the

1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:37.080
 day, it's about the conclusions that they come to, which are then shaping their emotions. But

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:42.200
 look, emotions are not something to be avoided or ignored. That is, I can sense your emotions to

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:49.720
 some extent, right? Okay, it is Lex. I can sense his emotions. I can sense Michael's emotions.

1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:56.280
 And that's part of the facts of reality, right? So if Michael responds to something that I view

1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:01.080
 as really, really important, right? If we were standing in front of Michelangelo's David,

1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:05.960
 a Michael's response to Michelangelo's David was, yeah, and turned his back to it and walked away.

1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:10.760
 That would be really meaningful to me, right? That I would respond emotionally to that and

1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:16.520
 cognitively, I would say, what is it about Michael that makes him, you know, respond this way? That

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:21.480
 is, that is, that gives me a lot of information about him. So emotions are information laden,

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:29.640
 right? But they are not primary. They are responses, responses to something. So once,

1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:34.920
 one must be very aware of one's own emotions, recognize them, and analyze them. And one,

1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:38.440
 one should be aware of other people's emotions. If they're important to you, if they're not important

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:42.520
 to you, it doesn't matter, right? You don't care about a stranger's emotion. Yeah, like a stranger

1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:47.160
 walks up to Michelangelo's David and said, eh, and walks away, and I go, okay, glad you're a stranger.

1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:55.320
 But it's, now, now, I've known you when Michael's response to Michelangelo's David was or is,

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:59.000
 so I'm a little worried about what he's going to say. You got candy too, because that was great.

1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:04.600
 Hey. Do I get Ukrainian? I don't know. I can't read either. What's this thing,

1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:08.280
 Josh, what does that say to him? Is this Ukrainian candy as well? I thought it was

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:13.640
 sent to me. Do you know that Atlas Shrugged was the bestselling book in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016?

1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:17.720
 Do you know Atlas Shrugged was translated to Russian by someone who's now a crypto billionaire,

1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:20.920
 and he made like six copies, and I have one of them, and I sent it to my great grandma.

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:23.560
 No, they're more than six, but yeah, because I have a copy too. Okay.

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.560
 Not, I personally, the institute has a copy. I sent it to my great grandma, and she said,

1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:30.280
 why is he sending me this? I want to read books about love. And I'm like, you know what?

1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:32.600
 It's just about love. That's what you should have said.

1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:39.880
 What's that? Is that say? So this says it's, it has vitamins and minerals.

1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:48.600
 If it's in Russian, I don't believe it. It sounds really strange to read like health

1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:51.880
 information in Russian, but there's already this stressful of it.

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:55.720
 Look, there's a Yorker like you have. Exactly. I mean, I'm much, I like

1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:01.320
 he doesn't mean it more than I like Moscow. Wow, strong words. But this is, this is not,

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.760
 it's like hard candy. I don't know. I don't know. I think this, some of my friends sent me

1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:10.200
 that's made with blood to give the kids iron. Whose blood? Like cow blood. Oh, like with chocolate.

1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:14.840
 All right. You can keep it. That's all you. All right. I'm keeping both of you.

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:17.320
 Can I, can I, can I take all of it? Something you're talking about with emotion.

1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:23.240
 Something that is very pernicious in terms of emotion is people denying the validity of

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.880
 their own emotions. And here's one example. Someone could be in an abusive relationship

1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:32.520
 or have had an abusive childhood and they think, well, I didn't have a black eye.

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:35.720
 We had dinner on the table. It wasn't abusive because you hear some other story.

1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:40.760
 So they feel their emotion isn't valid or like, oh, he never lays hands on me.

1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:44.440
 He gets drunk and is mean to me. He's still basically a good person.

1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:49.320
 You're denying that emotion and that emotion is a response to something real. There's an

1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:53.400
 expression. I have friends who are in 12 step programs. There's an expression there, which I

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:59.320
 think is very profound, which is if it's hysterical, it's historical. Meaning if some minor incident

1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:05.400
 is having an extreme disproportionate impact on you, think ask yourself, why am I responding

1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:10.120
 in such an extreme way to some minor thing? And I will tell you 10 times out of 10,

1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:15.960
 you'll go back and you'll be like, oh, I'm feeling now like I felt when I was eight and my dad came

1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:20.360
 home and he was a total jerk and I didn't do anything wrong and he thought I had and I was

1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.200
 complete powerless. And now I'm in the same situation. My boss, I'm not that eight year old

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:28.760
 and one since I am another since I'm not, but I feel the same way I did as a kid. And this is

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:33.560
 a very useful mechanism in terms of furthering one's happiness because you kind of deep program

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:37.400
 all those things that you've picked up as a child. But it's also, you know, if you're feeling

1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:41.240
 something wrong, even though you're trying to rationalize in a way, you know, it's not abusive

1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:46.040
 because he's not hitting me. No, the emotion is telling you something real about what's going on.

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:52.600
 So acknowledge it and fix the situation, right? So one of the powers emotions give you is they

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:57.960
 send you signals about something that might not be in cognition yet. And when you examine their

1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:03.000
 motion, it brings it to cognition and now you can act on it. So maybe the boss is abusive,

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.880
 but I didn't really think of it in those terms and my emotions are sending me signals. And now

1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:11.880
 that I signal it, I'm going to resign. I'm going to find a better job. I'm going to complain to

1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:17.320
 his boss or whatever. I'm going to take action. Why do you think Ayn Rand is such a controversial

1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:22.920
 figure? Last time I spoke with you on this particular podcast, the, the amount of emails I've

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:28.680
 gotten positive and negative and certainly negative. I don't usually get negative emails.

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:34.360
 Yeah, but yeah, I can't, I can't relate. I'm sure mine were positive or only positive.

1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:38.760
 It was mostly women sending pictures for me to forward to you because

1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:42.520
 you didn't send me anything. I can't. Oh, it's the wrong email address.

1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:46.920
 I kept bouncing while sending it to you. Oh, so this is love.

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:55.320
 Love hurts. Okay. Yeah. No, I, well, why do you think she's such a divisive figure?

1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:59.400
 Why do you think she provokes such emotion in both the positive and the negative side?

1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:02.120
 I'd love to hear both of your viewpoints on this.

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.480
 Well, I think on the negative side and both on the positive and the negative side,

1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:13.400
 I think it's because she's radical. She's consistently radical. She upends the, the

1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:19.240
 premises, the ideas that are prevalent in the culture that were brought up on that, that, that are

1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:25.960
 like, you know, they're like milk and, and, and, and, and, you know, the basic stuff that we're,

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:29.320
 we're growing up. You have to be altruistic. You have to live for the people. That's just

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:33.320
 basic stuff. Nobody challenges that. Nobody questions it. And if they do question it,

1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:39.480
 they usually question it from the perspective of a cynic or a bad guy, right? You mentioned the

1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:43.880
 Joker, right? Before we started, right? You know, I'm going to upend the world because I don't care

1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:48.040
 about other people, right? So, so they presented with these two alternatives and it's real in

1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:55.720
 people's lives, right? You either live for other people or you're an evil SOB. And, you know,

1:13:55.720 --> 1:14:01.160
 yeah, most people in either one of those, but the ethic is right here. It's, it's living for the

1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.880
 people. And when you challenge that, they have no way cognitively to go with that. And the only

1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:10.280
 place they can go with that cognitively is to the Joker. It's to the evil guy. It's the somebody

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:15.080
 who wants to smash everything and destroy it because they don't have this alternative conception of,

1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:20.760
 oh no, you can be rationally self interested and that does not involve destruction and that does

1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:27.640
 not involve, you know, they're exploiting other people. They can't conceptualize that. It's not

1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:33.480
 in their framework. So, it's the fact that she's so consistently on the side of self interest,

1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:39.640
 for example, on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom. It's the fact that she dismisses

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:45.320
 faith to the extent that she does or to the extent that I do, right? That alienates people because

1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:48.920
 that is completely different from what they brought up. Now, the flip side of that is,

1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:55.560
 it's also really interesting to some people. So, you know, a lot of you got some positives,

1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:59.560
 right? And I got a lot of positives on that appearance. So, I know a lot of people came

1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:04.680
 to my podcast because I appeared on your show. Why? Because they hear something that's completely

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:11.880
 fresh, new, different. They've never heard before. It appeals to something in them that maybe, you

1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:15.880
 know, a lot of people say, I read, I ran and it confirmed everything I believed. Now, for me,

1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:20.040
 it didn't. It was the opposite. It turned upside down everything I believe. But there are a lot

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:24.520
 of people out there that who have a sense that something's wrong in the world, that altruism

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.080
 is wrong, that socialism, that just the stuff and religion is wrong, but they don't have an

1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.080
 alternative. It hasn't coalesced. And they listened to a lot of podcasts because they're trying to

1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:37.880
 get ideas of what is it, what is it that I'm sensing that's wrong out there? And suddenly,

1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:42.600
 somebody comes out and gives them some clear explanation of things and they go, wow,

1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:47.240
 that's what I've been looking for my whole life. So, that's the positive for people.

1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:57.560
 You know, and I read, I ran, it just all made sense. It all clicked. And it made clear that

1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:02.920
 everything I believed to that point was just wrong. It just didn't integrate. And I always knew,

1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:06.760
 to some extent, it didn't integrate. But there was an alternative. So, I believed it. What else

1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:11.880
 was there? I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15, why should I, why is this,

1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:18.120
 why is Moraleo about other people? Why is that? Well, that's just the way it is. And I couldn't

1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:21.320
 come up with an explanation. She gave me the explanation. And she gave me the explanation

1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:26.760
 why it's wrong to do that. And I think, so I think that's why people respond. It's just too

1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:31.640
 radical. It can't fit into their cognitive framework that they're being brought up on,

1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:35.560
 that they've been educated on, that just their whole life revolves around.

1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:40.440
 Michael, you don't bring up Ayn Rand that much in conversation, except as kind of references

1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:44.440
 every once in a while as part of the humor of just the general flow and the music of the way

1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:51.400
 you like to talk. Well, why do you think you don't integrate her into your philosophy when you're

1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:58.200
 like explaining ideas and all those kinds of things? Like, why is she not, you know, a popular

1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:03.160
 reference point for discussion of ideas? Because I, and I don't know if everyone's

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.560
 going to agree with or can't agree with me. I think for a certain percentage of population,

1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:10.760
 actually, I talked to someone from the Ayn Rand Institute. I forgot his name, older guy with

1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:14.840
 glasses, and he didn't disagree with me. He said, this is changing. I said, I think for a certain

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:20.920
 percentage of population who are uninformed about her work, higher than 10%, less than 50%,

1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:24.840
 you mentioned Ayn Rand. They have been trained to think this is identical to Scientology.

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:29.640
 So as soon as her name comes up, it's like, okay, I'm out the door. I'm not going to have anything

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:33.560
 to do with this. And everyone who follows her is a crazy person. That's one thing that has happened.

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:41.240
 Another thing is Rand, in her personality, was very aggressive and antagonistic. She was, for a long

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:47.960
 time, the lone voice in the wilderness, being like, this isn't like one of her big adversaries,

1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:53.480
 in a certain sense, is Milton Friedman. And she really hated how Milton Friedman was like, oh,

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:59.160
 you know, having rent control is inefficient. And she's like, inefficient, we're talking about

1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:05.560
 mass homelessness and people dying. And you're talking about this, like, what color tie goes

1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:11.000
 with this color shirt? And in fact, it's hilarious. There was an organization called the Foundation

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:17.560
 for Economic Education Fee. Leonard Reed was the head of this. And there were a series of letters,

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:21.400
 and she was helping him. She was much more philosophically grounded in certain contexts than

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:27.240
 he was. And there was an essay, a pamphlet that he published called Roofs or Ceilings.

1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:31.720
 It was cowritten by Milton Friedman, later Nobel Prize winner, and George Stigler,

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:37.960
 also later Nobel Prize winner. And basically, the argument was, well, if the government controls

1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:43.640
 all housing, how's that going to work out? And she's sitting there, and she's typing in all caps.

1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:46.680
 So you know, she's holding on the shift key and doing this.

1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:52.440
 On a typewriter. On a typewriter. And being like, how, and you can imagine her with her cigarette

1:18:52.440 --> 1:19:00.040
 holder, apoplectic, being like, how is an organization ostensibly devoted to free enterprise,

1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:06.840
 discussing these, this Stalinist idea in the most casual of terms? She's like, have I taught you

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:13.560
 not? And what's amazing is, so at fee, they only have her letters, because she sent them to read,

1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:18.200
 the iron ran astute must have Leonard Reed's letter. I was able to, knowing Rand enough,

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:22.840
 predict exactly what the conversation would go like, because he also did something she didn't

1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:27.800
 approve of, which is he asked other people for feedback on her work. And she goes,

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:31.960
 I gave this to you to read. Who are you shopping around to some jerk that I don't,

1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:37.480
 I need their approval. What are you doing? So it was a very interesting situation. But so that's

1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:41.560
 one issue. I remember this is a new end when she's young. She was not young. Well, I mean,

1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:45.000
 she's relatively young, right? Yeah, it's before Ashletchuk. It was before Ashletchuk. So it's

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:50.920
 before she's super famous. And before this is the fan has been published. But, but, you know,

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:56.920
 she's, she's trying to work with others. And they are disappointing her left and right.

1:19:56.920 --> 1:20:05.720
 Yeah. So, and also when you are a, what she takes away from bad people, you have these kids,

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:09.240
 right? And you're going to sit down with them. And they're going to be like, yeah, I'm going to

1:20:09.240 --> 1:20:14.600
 take your guns. I'm going to lock you in your house. I'm going to take 60% of your income

1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:19.880
 and all this other stuff. And they might up to reading ran, they might sit down and have a

1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:25.400
 discussion. And ran goes, Hey, you know what? You didn't have to give them an answer. You could

1:20:25.400 --> 1:20:32.600
 say, go to hell. We're not having this conversation. And you have no right to one second of my life.

1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:37.720
 And this is not a legitimate opener. This is a declaration of war. This isn't like,

1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:41.400
 it's not like, if I sit down with you, I run like, Hey, Ron, here are my plans for your wife.

1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:44.920
 Go to hell. This isn't a conversation we're having. Oh, I'm going to make you unsafe in your

1:20:44.920 --> 1:20:50.200
 house. What? This is not a discussion. So what happens is these people who five minutes ago

1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:54.200
 were able to have a debate with this kid because people read ran when they're young often. And

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:59.320
 now that kid is like, yeah, I'm not even talking to you. It's her fault. Whereas in reality,

1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:03.960
 it's that person's fault because that person had no right. Although they've been trained to the

1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:08.120
 contrary of our culture to believe, yeah, I'm going to sit down and we're just going to

1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:12.520
 equally have a discussion over your own life. And you have one vote and I have one vote and

1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:16.760
 we're going to go, oh, Lex has a vote. And that's, that's how it's going to be. And Rand's not having

1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:21.560
 it. So I think those are two issues. And there's some other things which, which I don't need to

1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:27.240
 get into. But I, I, because one of the things that ran set consisting of her life is that her

1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:32.920
 philosophy is an integrated whole, right? So to be an objective isn't just like, I like Atlas

1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:39.800
 shrugged. It means I accept objectivism as a totality. Since I do not, I don't, I think it is

1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:44.760
 proper to be respectful to her wishes and not constantly be, especially given that I've somewhat

1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:49.240
 of a platform to be like, I ran, I ran, I ran, I ran because I don't think I ran would have liked

1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:54.520
 it if I was talking about I ran this much. So how do you, how do you deep program? Because I,

1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:59.080
 I don't like to bring up I ran just because I do see what, like how people roll their eyes,

1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:05.080
 essentially. So how do you, what's the outside exactly? But what is that pro, can we, can you

1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:09.640
 speak to that programming that people have programming people? I mean, look, at the end of

1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:13.960
 the day, if you talk about the ideas and ideas make sense and people attract it to the ideas,

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:18.120
 then you say, Oh, by the way, and this came from mine, man, that's how you deep program them.

1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:21.880
 Right. If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture, if people start viewing

1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:26.200
 self interest as something that's kind of interesting and worthwhile and something

1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:30.760
 with investigating, and they said, Oh, that came from my man, then I think, I think then

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.120
 we'll, we'll deep program them and get them and get them changing their minds about these things.

1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:41.080
 And also, you know, going on shows where people are going to watch your show no matter who you

1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:47.480
 bring on, right? So even though now you do, if you put on you, you put on ran in the title,

1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:52.120
 that immediately reduces the number of people who watch. So, so in the future, you shouldn't

1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:56.840
 you put a mouse in the title and then at least the female population to the female to, you know,

1:22:56.840 --> 1:23:02.200
 absolutely, just to see. But so, so you go and you try to make them as credible as possible to

1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:06.680
 as many people as possible over time. It takes time. And ultimately, I don't think the culture

1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:11.080
 will have this response to her. They might still disagree with her. But I think over time, and

1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:16.120
 already you're seeing it, younger people, I think today, a far less, there was a generation who never

1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:20.200
 read I'm right. And was like this, bring out your garlic in the crosses, we don't want to have

1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:24.600
 anything to do with it. Then, and I think today, there are many more people who've read her and

1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:28.520
 might disagree or not disagree, right? And then there are a lot of people who haven't read her,

1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:33.000
 but who are not opposed to it or willing to have an engage to engage. So I think it's changing

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.520
 already. And I think in 20 years, it'll be completely different. And just two more things that

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:40.760
 she does that I think it says that I think people find very, very off putting given our culture.

1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:46.920
 One is she will basically you could sit down with Rand and be like, your fear is not in any way a

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:52.920
 hold on my freedom. Just that one sentence. And for a lot of people that's very off putting and

1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:59.160
 very harsh, it's correct. But for them, it's just like, wait a minute, I'm still scared. It's like

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:04.120
 I don't care. Like for example, like with lockdowns and things like this, it's like, well, I'm scared

1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:08.120
 and maybe I have a right to be scared. Or like I'm scared that you have a gun in your house.

1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:12.600
 And it's like, I respect that you're scared. I don't care at the end. As you say, at the end

1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:17.080
 of the day, this is my house. I'm going to live my life as I please as long as I don't hurt other

1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:21.080
 people. Well, you are hurting me because I'm scared. No, that's not. This is the feeling

1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:27.160
 versus fact. Yeah. Yeah. So that is one situation. It's like feeling versus freedom. Yes. Where Rand

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:35.640
 puts a lot of people off. I also think that historically, a lot of people who were drawn

1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:42.920
 to her are drawn to her for the wrong reasons that a lot of times like Howard Rourke, the hero, we're

1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:46.440
 going to still say hero. You're supposed to say protagonist, the hero. The hero of the fountain

1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:52.200
 head, he's extremely intelligent, but he's also extremely uncompromising. What often ends up

1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:56.520
 happening is you'll have a young kid who is somewhat intelligent, but then they pick up the

1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:00.920
 personality and now you're someone I can't work with. And then it's like, you're not Howard Rourke.

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:04.840
 Relax. You're not that skilled. You're not that talented. But because the character has to be

1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:09.800
 personification and have certain aspects together, when kids read that, they're going to might get

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:16.600
 the wrong idea and that's not Rand's fault. And it's more than that. I completely agree with that,

1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:22.600
 but it's even broader than that. So here is, in my view, one of the geniuses of the millennium

1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:26.920
 presenting a philosophy. And she's got not just the questions, in my view, she's got the answers.

1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:33.080
 And you're reading them at 16 and you're reading the answers. You don't know at 16 that this is

1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:37.000
 true. You might have a sense that it's true, but you don't have the life experience, the learned

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:41.400
 experience. You don't have the facts. You don't have the knowledge. You're picking up truth.

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:45.880
 It's just being absorbed. You're accepting it as true, but you don't know it's true.

1:25:45.880 --> 1:25:51.000
 And then you go out into the world advocating for it, which we all did, or at least I did,

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:57.160
 when I was 16. And you're obnoxious. You can't prove what you're arguing for because you don't

1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:02.440
 have the experience. It took me, I don't know, 10, 20 years, probably 20, to figure out that I

1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:07.800
 really do think what she said was true. But I didn't know when I was 16. When I was 16,

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:14.280
 I just absorbed these ideas and accepted them in a sense, with some connection to reality,

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:21.720
 but in a sense, on faith, at least presented it that way. And as a consequence, you come off as

1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:27.880
 a detached from reality, obnoxious human being. And I think of a lot of young objectivists,

1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:32.680
 oh, and it's hard not to be, because you are, you're confronted with genius. And you're not a

1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:36.920
 genius. I certainly am not a genius. And I'm confronted with just genius and have all this

1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:43.240
 information in my head now, I cannot articulate it. And it's hard to deal with yourself. There's

1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:47.480
 an inside joke. No, you said I'm confronted with genius, I point to us. Yeah. I'm confronted with

1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:52.760
 you guys. I'm at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses. But I'm going to say there's

1:26:52.760 --> 1:26:56.200
 something else. This is not why people don't like her, but there's something that the fountain head

1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:01.720
 does, which I think is very, and I don't, I don't blame her, but it's a bad consequence.

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.080
 If you read the fountain head and you're young and you're intelligent and talented,

1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:09.160
 the message, at least I got, and I know I'm not alone, is you are going to think that you're

1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:13.400
 going to be a pariah, that a lot of people are going to be against you. And you're going to,

1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:18.520
 you're basically doomed for a short period of being isolated and alone. And that may have been

1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:22.440
 the case when the fountain head was written. But I think now with the internet, and in my

1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:26.920
 experience, both as a youth and someone who's a little bit older, I didn't appreciate and

1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:29.480
 you're not going to get it from that book. And you can't get it through that book because it

1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:35.880
 has to have a certain narrative. How many people who are a little older are giddy when they find

1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:40.840
 young talent. How inspiring it is, how exciting it is. Like when you talk to these kids who are

1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:45.240
 doing things on the internet or writing or whatever achievement, you want them to flourish.

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.240
 You don't, you're not threatened by them as the antagonists of the fountain head are.

1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.240
 And that doesn't come through in the fountain head because it depends on your profession, right?

1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:58.120
 I mean, parts of the world are better than others. If you're an, if you're an artist,

1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:04.120
 at least the way I conceive of art, and you want to go study art today, you're going to be

1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:09.160
 poo pooed and look down on and so on. So, so yeah, I agree. I mean, and in my generation,

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:13.960
 when I read, I meant, you know, there was no internet. There was, and I was in Israel. So

1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:18.360
 we were isolated and there was nobody else who has shared their ideas. And he did feel that kind

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:24.360
 of isolation. And, but rock gave you, to me, he didn't teach me about, you know, you're going to be

1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:37.000
 isolated because partially because I wasn't, maybe I was, I was humble, right? When I, when I read

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.800
 Atlas Shrug, I identified with Eddie Willis. Okay. When I read the fountain head, I didn't

1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:44.920
 identify with how it worked. How old were you read the fountain head?

1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:50.520
 So I read Atlas when I was 16, I probably read a fountain head when I was 16 and a half, 17,

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:55.080
 something like that. And I, and I, and I, and I read the fountain head after Atlas Shrug. Yeah.

1:28:55.080 --> 1:29:00.360
 If anyone listening to this, they should read it first. But for me, after Atlas Shrug, no,

1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:06.520
 that is a war crime. No, for me, reading Atlas Shrug was much more, it is more important. But,

1:29:06.520 --> 1:29:11.320
 but my point is, I think the fountain head in many ways is redundant in certain aspects. If you

1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:15.880
 read Atlas Shrug first, and because the fountain head is such a masterful book and such a personal

1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:19.880
 book, I agree, I agree with that. So ideally you would read the fountain head. That's what I'm

1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:23.080
 saying. Yes. But, and here's the other thing people don't appreciate. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:27.160
 People think Rand's always about politics, politics, politics, politics, politics. The

1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:30.760
 fountain head is not a political book at all. It's about it. Well, she talks about politics

1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:35.880
 in Man's Soul. Sure. But it's about ethics, how important everyone has to have a moral code.

1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:39.960
 That's the other thing why people find Rand off putting. If you have young people

1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:46.280
 who now find it very important to live a moral life, who are like, what does that mean to have

1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:52.520
 morality, to have ethics, to live with integrity for people who have gotten a little older,

1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:56.600
 who have made these little sacrifices, who are like, I'm not going to fight at work.

1:29:56.600 --> 1:30:00.120
 Do I really need to look for another job? Yeah, my wife's kind of, you know,

1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:05.000
 getting annoying, but am I going to make a fight about it? These little sacrifices that they make

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:11.080
 every day. And big ones. And big ones. Oh, absolutely. So when you have someone who's saying, forcing

1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:17.400
 you to look in the mirror and say, those little sacrifices and big sacrifices made you did the

1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:23.160
 wrong thing and you're evading that you betrayed your own conscious, that to many people, I think,

1:30:23.160 --> 1:30:29.560
 is very threatening. But this is why so many people say that I'm Rand is for 14 year old boys.

1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:35.800
 Yeah, right. Right. And there's a reason why there's a reason why it appeals to 14 is a little

1:30:35.800 --> 1:30:40.760
 young, but 16, 18, it's because those are the ages where we're still open to idealism,

1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:47.160
 idealism in a positive sense, right, to beautiful things, the ideals, to seeking perfection,

1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:52.840
 to seeking a great life. I think as you grow older, most people become cynical.

1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:56.920
 They give up on their ideals. Why? Because their ideals were wrong. And their ideas fail.

1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:00.920
 Right. My parents were socialists when they were young. Those ideas failed. So where do you go

1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:06.360
 from socialism to idealism? cynicism, which is horrible. Right. All adults, almost all adults

1:31:06.360 --> 1:31:11.080
 out there are cynical. And that is that is that is failed idealism. And when they look at the

1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:16.520
 young people, they see their idealism. Oh, well, that's that I was idealistic too. And they don't

1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:20.200
 question the idea. Well, they're good ideals and they're bad ideas, the right ideals and the wrong

1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:26.440
 ideals. And and that's why they attribute it to the attributed to you. So it's a threat to a lot

1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:30.200
 of people, a lot of people who it's too late for. For some people, it's too late to change

1:31:30.200 --> 1:31:37.240
 their minds. And they know it. And they're too invested in the, in the job, in the wife,

1:31:37.240 --> 1:31:41.400
 in the, in the compromises, in the comfort, in the comfort, and they're too invested in the

1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:46.840
 comfort, too, too invested in compromise, too invested in comfort. And they know that they

1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:50.840
 shouldn't be, they know they should change. And these young people are challenging that.

1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:56.040
 And that is really, really scary for them. And that's, that's why they reject it without even

1:31:56.040 --> 1:31:59.880
 without too much consideration. What one of the things ran the working title for Fountainhead

1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:05.240
 was secondhand lives. And ran had two definitions of selfishness in that book. One is selfishness

1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:10.280
 in the sense of my life is the most important thing. It's not the only important thing. My family

1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:14.680
 would be number two friends. They certainly are extremely high values. But you can't have these

1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:18.200
 secondary values at the first value. But in the context of my life, right? Because your family

1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:23.240
 might not be a value, right? You might hate your parents. Sure. The point being selfishness.

1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:27.400
 Then there's the other kind of selfishness, which is Peter Keating, one of the villains of the book,

1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:32.840
 which is he's selfish in that he's greedy. He's looking out for number one, but he has no values.

1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:38.200
 He has no sense of character. He just wants to be wealthy. He wants to have a beautiful wife.

1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:42.120
 He wants to have a big house. Why? He couldn't tell you because other people have it and he

1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:46.680
 wants to have it more than them. His sense of reference is other people. He's living second

1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:52.200
 hand. What the problem with that is, a lot of young people read rand. And when they start arguing

1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:56.840
 online, they just start trying to talk like rand. Whereas rand would be like the original,

1:32:56.840 --> 1:33:01.720
 be an innovator. If you want to argue for objectivism and rand's views, take her ideas,

1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:06.200
 articulate them in your own way. Because that's a good way of showing that you understand what

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:11.640
 she thinks. But what they end up doing is just talking like her. It sounds dated and comical.

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:15.400
 And that's going to be off putting because it's like, rand wouldn't expect someone else to sound

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:21.240
 like rand. She's a person. And she of course wouldn't view Keating as selfish in any sense,

1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:27.160
 because, or even greedy, greed is a tricky word. He was selfish in the old school sense.

1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:33.400
 Yeah. He's selfish in the old, but even there, it's not as if he has some passion and he's

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:39.880
 going after a passion no matter what. I'm getting light sheet steel. His passion is painting,

1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:44.200
 right? And he doesn't pursue his passion. He pursues what his mother wants him to pursue.

1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:50.040
 And he pursues money and he's completely second handed in the sense that he follows

1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:53.800
 other people's values, not his own. Can we actually just backtrack and can we

1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:58.920
 define some of these ideas that iron rand is known for of selfishness? Selfishness, egoism,

1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:06.200
 egotism, greed, I mean, those all basically all of those words are seen as negative in society.

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:12.280
 And iron rand has been reclaiming in her work those words. So can you speak to what they mean?

1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:18.760
 I think she's trying to, you're on my disagree. I think she's trying to be needlessly provocative.

1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:25.240
 And it's off putting. And on one hand, maybe you want to be a provocateur because that gives

1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:29.240
 you people like, what does this woman mean? On the other hand, many people are going to be

1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:34.840
 viscerally put off. When iron rand was on Donahue in 1979, he asked her explicitly,

1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:40.360
 define to me the virtue of selfishness, which is the title of her collection of essays as well.

1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:45.560
 And she, this is rand, immediately says, use a different word, self esteem. And it's like,

1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:51.400
 yeah, it's like, why are you championing this word, which has extremely negative connotations?

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:58.760
 Whereas if you just say, and this is thanks to her and her work, my life matters. My values

1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:05.240
 matter. I'm not going to apologize for that. That is a lot less off putting than this caricature

1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:09.960
 of rand, which is when people hear I'm for selfishness, they hear, oh, someone's bleeding

1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:13.960
 out in the corner, but I want to get a coke. That's nice. She condemned that. She says,

1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:18.120
 I'm against this kind of sociopathy. That's absolutely crazy. But that word selfishness

1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:24.600
 goes a mistake to, to, to be provocative in this one dimension, to go like and to stick with it.

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:30.120
 I mean, she's stuck with this idea of selfishness and so on. This term. And it's I, I, I, I often use

1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:35.560
 terms for provocative effect. Yes, this is true. You're a master. You're a scholar of the trolling

1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:41.960
 arts. Thank you, sir. But I think this is one example where the costs that weigh the benefits.

1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:46.520
 And go ahead, you're on. Yes, I'm, I'm, I don't, I'm open to that idea, but I don't,

1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:53.160
 I don't think that's right. When, when you actually dig, you know, deeper into what people

1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:58.600
 object to, they're not but objecting to the word. They're objecting to the ideas. And

1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:03.240
 she addresses this explicitly in the virtue of selfishness in there. I think the introduction.

1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:06.360
 Wait, hold on. I got, I got, that's for clarification. You're saying they're objecting

1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:09.720
 to the ideas, but when they talk about her, they're not talking about her actual ideas.

1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:13.560
 They're talking about the caricature. Well, sure. But, but the caricature is a defense

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:19.240
 mechanism. Okay. Not to, not have to deal with the ideas, right? So, so they create the caricature

1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:24.280
 in order to ignore the ideas in order to, and some of them do it consciously. Like when, when,

1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:28.040
 when people like Krugman and others do this, they know exactly what they're doing.

1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:34.040
 Well Krugman is, is Ellsworth Tui. Yes. He's, he's the perfect Ellsworth Tui. And, and he,

1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:39.240
 he knows Iron Man, he's read Iron Man and he knows she's the enemy in some sense. He knows

1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:45.000
 check out our episode with, with Krugman. I think it's number 90. It was a great conversation.

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.600
 Didn't get as many views as me, but what are you going to do?

1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:49.160
 No, well, you got a Nobel Prize. So what you got?

1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:55.640
 I've got a ticket to heaven. Sorry, Paul. Yasuo Alfred has a Nobel Prize.

1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:59.080
 And Hitler was a times man of the year. Yes.

1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:02.760
 But you, you, that, that really bothers me when people bring that up. Are you really?

1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:05.880
 Yeah. Time of the year. It's called a joke, Michael. Good.

1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:10.600
 Is it? Man of the year is not representative. Good. It's, it represents the most influential

1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:12.760
 person of that year. And Hitler was. Absolutely.

1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:16.440
 Well, what were you upset about? When people like, well, look at Time Magazine,

1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:19.560
 they call Hitler man of the year. They, like you're on set. They won't say this guy's awesome.

1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:20.920
 They said, this is the guy who moved on the world.

1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:25.320
 It's not like he was. I don't, I don't go out there.

1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:32.600
 Now that's who they like. Hitler's terrible. Stalin guy. Oh, no, no, I'm not even joking.

1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:37.640
 The, the attitude between the, the attitude of people between Nazism and fascism and

1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:42.360
 communism is stunning. Like in my upcoming book, I have all the receipts how like the,

1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:48.200
 the things that they were saying about Stalin at the time are, if you look back, it's unconscionable.

1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:51.480
 And these people have had no accountability in the positive direction.

1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.160
 It's not, it's not even at the time. And I, I, we need to get back to the selfishness stuff,

1:37:55.160 --> 1:38:00.680
 but it's not even at the time. So I'm, I was once, I think I've told the story. I was at,

1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:05.480
 I was in the green room going on John Stossel show. And so a bunch of libertarians, right?

1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:09.320
 Oh, in the green room, all hanging out. And this guy walks in, this young guy walks in.

1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:14.520
 And somebody says to me, you know, he's, he's a communist. I said, what do you mean?

1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:19.400
 I said, they said, no, no, he's, he's a card carrying real member of the communist party.

1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:25.720
 He's a communist. And I said, and that's okay with you guys. And they go, yeah, yeah, nice guy.

1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:28.600
 And I'm like, no, this is not acceptable.

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:34.200
 Hold on. Let me quote Rand. Rand said she would rather talk to a philosophical Marx,

1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:36.760
 right? Did she not say this? Yeah, but this is not a, this is,

1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:43.240
 this is a communist in the context of 21st century. Right. So, so I said, well,

1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:48.680
 well, in a sense that we know exactly what we know exactly. So I'm like, this guy has the

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:53.080
 blood of a hundred million people on his hands. I'm not letting him off the hook. So I get,

1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:56.840
 I engage with this guy and, and, and, and literally we get into this matter, you know,

1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:00.760
 I'm telling him what I, what I think of his ideas and therefore what I think of him.

1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:05.400
 Then the people from the wardrobe department come out and their chairs are put aside and,

1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:09.960
 you know, this little gladiator wing. It's like the libertarians are like sitting there amused

1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:13.560
 because to them it's just, you know, and I don't, you know, I'm not going to name names,

1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:17.960
 but to them it's just like, yeah, he's a communist. And I said, I said at some point,

1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:23.640
 and I said at some point to them, I won't name names because I said at some point to them,

1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:29.320
 if somebody walks into a room and says, I'm a Nazi, do you just treat him as, okay, let's,

1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:32.680
 let's go hang out and get some drinks? I do. I don't. I do. Cause I wrote a book about this,

1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:36.360
 then you write, and I did talk to Nazis and I went to North Korea. Cause you were writing a book.

1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:40.520
 Yeah. Right. But, but you're not, you're not going to hang out with a Nazi or a communist,

1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:43.720
 just like the regular person, right? To me, a Nazi and a communist are the same.

1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:47.800
 I don't, okay. Please explain this. Cause at first of all, any time you have equivocation,

1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:51.080
 I hate that because I don't, I don't like equality. I think it's a bad concept.

1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:56.040
 Sure. We're all sitting here as Jewish people, right? We're from the, we're from the Soviet Union.

1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:59.880
 To say these two things are basically the same. It's a matter of life and death for all of us.

1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:03.720
 We'd be dead under Hitler. We're not doing so hot under Stalin, but we're still alive.

1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:11.240
 Sure. So there's, there's some very big difference. It's one more thing. There's also one very big

1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:16.680
 difference in that one has a lot worse of a brand name and the other does not, even though the other

1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:21.640
 should. It's a brand. Yeah. Yeah. So I, so I agree. So there's a context in which I would fear

1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:25.320
 Stalin more than Hitler. There's a different context in which I would hit fear Hitler,

1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:33.160
 but as ideologies, they are equally evil. Wait, wait, but not, not the same because the difference

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:38.200
 has been communism and fascism, but as ideologies, they're equally evil. They both view the individual

1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:42.600
 as insignificant, unimportant, and they both basically want to kill any independent minded.

1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:47.240
 Well, you're equating communism and Stalinism. So you're equal. No, I'm equating communism.

1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:51.960
 I don't know what Stalinism is. I don't care. Stalinism is one version of communism.

1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:56.600
 Communism is an evil ideology, no matter who practices it.

1:40:56.600 --> 1:41:03.560
 I don't, I don't think that's, I think that's too loose because here's one example. The first person

1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:10.680
 who went to the Soviet Union from the left and denounced it was Emma Goldman. She was an anarcho

1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:15.320
 communist, right? So she went there. She got deported from the United States. She went to Lenin

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.600
 to his face. Hold on, let me finish. You're already, you're already dismissing what I'm saying.

1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:25.160
 Your body language, your emotion, your humility. History doesn't care about your feelings either.

1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:30.040
 She goes to Lenin. She goes, we're supposed to be about free speech. We're supposed to be

1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:33.560
 about the individual freedom. What are you doing? And he goes, free speeches of bourgeois

1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:38.280
 extravagance. You can't have it during a revolution. Too bad. She comes back to the west.

1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:41.480
 Wait, he's right? Yeah. Oh, no, yeah, correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.240
 He's more consistent with the idea. Yeah, he's more consistent.

1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:47.000
 She's a compromise. Yeah, you're right. Well, she comes back to the west,

1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:53.800
 the big red Emma, the big hero of the left. And she goes, you guys, this is a complete,

1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:58.760
 not, she didn't say bad. She was very random. She goes, this is pure evil. This is horrifying.

1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:02.120
 What they're doing to the workers, which you supposedly care about, completely oppressing.

1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:07.720
 And one, one person described, they go, when she got up to talk, it was a standing ovation.

1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:12.680
 And when she was finished, you could hear a pin drop because she wasn't some capitalist.

1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:19.080
 She wasn't some bourgeois conservative. She was as hard left for violent revolution as it gets.

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:22.840
 And so I don't think she, as a communist, is an evil person.

1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:29.880
 I think she is. Because, because if she, if she wasn't evading and, you know, with Rand,

1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:34.920
 and I think in reality, the essence of evil is evasion is, is ignoring the facts of reality,

1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:40.040
 is putting your feelings ahead of your facts. She would realize that what was going on in the

1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:45.320
 Soviet Union was the inevitable consequence of her ideas. So she could have, so she could have

1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:50.120
 changed her mind. She could have, coming back to the Soviet Union said, these ideas are wrong.

1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:55.800
 I now repudiate my ideas, not just of implementation, but my ideas. And then I would have said,

1:42:55.800 --> 1:43:00.520
 yeah, she had been mistaken before and now she's confronted reality. But if she stayed a leftist,

1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:05.960
 if she stayed a leftist to that extent, not just a mildly, but a leftist, then I think she's dishonest

1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:09.960
 and therefore immoral, right? But you're using three words identically. You're saying dishonest,

1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:16.040
 immoral, and evil. And I'm, so evil, so evil is more, is, is, is an extreme form of immorality,

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:20.280
 right? So, okay, so she's, she's immoral. The ideology she holds is still evil. Because the

1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:25.880
 ideology, she might be delusional. That's delusional. But she can be delusional. She cannot be delusional.

1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:31.560
 See, I, I, I'm willing to accept a delusion before she's gone to the Soviet Union and seen it.

1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:38.120
 Once she's gone to see it, I don't think that excuse holds anymore. I think now she's been

1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:44.280
 confronted and she's lying to herself about the implications of it. Logically, it's inevitable

1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:49.000
 that what happens in the Soviet Union has to happen in any communist context.

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:54.280
 To play a little bit of a devil's advocate here. Is it logically inevitable? Is it,

1:43:54.280 --> 1:43:59.000
 can you imagine that there is communist systems where the consequences we've seen in the 20th

1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.520
 century are not the, the consequences we get in, imagine future societies under different

1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:09.160
 conditions, under different, you know, with the internet, different communication schemes,

1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:12.600
 different set of reasons. As long as human beings are what we are. Now the Borg,

1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.120
 you remember the Borg from, from Star Trek or whatever the series was. Okay, nerd.

1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:26.680
 Yeah. I mean, I'm a nerd. Okay. The Borg is the highest of compliments. The Borg in this household.

1:44:26.680 --> 1:44:34.120
 The Borg is the highest of Lex. The Borg is communist, right? The Borg is a different species.

1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:39.720
 It has a different biology. It has a business, different form consciousness. Now, whether such

1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:44.520
 a being could, could survive evolution is a question. Whether such a, they don't have to be

1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:48.280
 intelligent. Yeah. But they, but then the question is, can you have free will? Yeah. Yeah. Human

1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:54.120
 cognitive cognition and be a Borg. I don't think so. But maybe, sure. Maybe in another planet.

1:44:54.120 --> 1:45:01.960
 But you gotta take the NT to meet the Borg. Say human beings. No. Communism is anti,

1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:07.640
 the reason communism is evil is it's anti reality, anti human nature, anti the individual.

1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:13.320
 And therefore it is inherently evil. It cannot result in anything good coming out of it. Only

1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:16.840
 bad can come of it. Do you think you could have predicted that before the 20th century?

1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:21.720
 Yes. And plenty of people did. It's not, it's not. You know who did? Mikhail Bakunin. Mikhail Bakunin,

1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:26.760
 who was an early communist, Marx's rival in 18, this is going to be in my upcoming book,

1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:33.480
 in 1860, he sat down and wrote an essay, goes, what Marx is advocating is insane. This is going to

1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:38.440
 be worse than the czar. You're talking about complete totalitarian nightmare. When you put

1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:42.360
 this into practice, it's going to be something we've never seen before. It's a pure horror.

1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:48.360
 Like he was a hardcore leftist. Look, Marx predicted it, right? Marx at some point says

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:52.680
 certain people cannot be part of the proletariat and they have to be liquidated. So this idea of

1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:58.440
 mass murder and mass killing is not new to communism. It is an inherent part of what it means. You're

1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:05.320
 either proletarian or you're not. And you look, and in Marx, it's in Marx, right? The individual

1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:09.800
 doesn't matter. Now he might matter in his utopia because he knows he's got a marketing problem.

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:14.040
 See, Marx has a marketing problem because the fact is you have individuals. How do you convince

1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:18.520
 individuals to give up their individualism, to give up the individuality? What you say is,

1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:23.560
 well, we have to go through this difficult process to get to this utopia. And then this utopia,

1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:27.720
 I mean, he's very Christian. I mean, this is the other thing about Marx. But the end time.

1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:32.360
 Marx is very Christian in everything, in his morality, in his collectivism and in the end

1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:38.040
 time. The end times for Marx is going back to the Garden of Eden. The end time for Marx is,

1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:44.360
 you don't have to do anything. Food is just available. Every wealth is just available.

1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:48.840
 You can do your hobbies. You can do everything. You can do whatever you want, whatever feelings,

1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:54.360
 whatever. So it's going back to a Garden of Eden perception perspective on human. So he knows what

1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:58.280
 that is going to require. It's going to require this dictatorship of the proletarian to get there.

1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:03.400
 And he never tells you how we get there, right? There's no game plan. There's a dictatorship

1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:08.040
 than these utopias. It's like the underpants notes. Step one, dictatorship. Step two, question

1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:12.680
 mark. Step three, utopia. And the question mark is what action is, right? Annihilate. Yeah, you yada,

1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:19.560
 yada, the important part. And people buy this garbage, right? So there's nothing of value in

1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:25.240
 Marx. I mean, let me be very clear. There's nothing, he gets capitalism wrong. He gets the

1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:31.720
 proletarian wrong. He gets the workers wrong. He gets the labor theory of value is wrong.

1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:37.800
 There is nothing of value. There's nothing of value in communism. It is a wrong, unfitted to

1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:43.160
 human nature ideology from beginning to end. The clarity with which you speak is just not

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:47.720
 something I, I don't think I have that clarity about anything. So I, I mean, it has to do with

1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:51.560
 that thing that where everybody has something to teach you, I just feel like I've been reading

1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:55.880
 Mein Kampf recently, for example, for the first time, something to learn from Hitler. Well,

1:47:55.880 --> 1:48:00.280
 there's a lot to learn from Hitler about the nature of evil, about wrong ideas, not about

1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:04.280
 anything good, not about anything positive. Oh, so yes. So that's probably a really bad example.

1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:09.560
 And why is Hitler different than Marx? That's a regular question. No, I get that. But in terms

1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:13.240
 of ideas, why is Hitler different than Marx? Why, why do we have, the other way, do we have to

1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:17.400
 assume there's something to learn from Marx, but there's nothing, but the, but we acknowledge

1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:20.280
 that there's nothing positive to learn from him. Well, because, I mean, all right.

1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:23.720
 But I can tell you something in the sense that like, there's an interesting question is,

1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:28.040
 how did this person get from step A to being able to implement the ideas?

1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:31.800
 I know you, everybody should read. Anybody who's interested should read Marx,

1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:35.560
 because it's really important. It's important in the history and a lot of people were influenced

1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:40.840
 by it. How, why was it influential? What is it that he says that appeals to people? I find it

1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:44.040
 interesting to see all the parallels with Christianity. And I think that's why to a large

1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:48.200
 extent it appeals to people because they got to give up the unimportant part of religion and

1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:52.840
 got to keep the front parts of religion, the important parts to them of religion, the morality,

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:58.520
 for example. But no, there's not something positive to learn from everybody.

1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:03.160
 In Ayn Rand's view, in your view, who was worse, Stalin or Hitler?

1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:11.640
 I think worse is this is something that I, I'll do a randy and sin and be evasive.

1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:18.600
 It really drives me crazy when people sit down and have these competitions about like,

1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:22.040
 if someone who's Jewish brings up the Holocaust and someone who's African American brings up

1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:28.120
 slavery. And this is a conversation that I think is pointless and very hurtful and harmful.

1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:32.600
 And it is really like silly and ridiculous. So it might make sense in like some kind of

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:37.160
 stoner context about like you're doing the math and trying to figure out. But it's like, you know,

1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:40.600
 and yeah, you could be like, what would you rather have like this kind of cancer or full

1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:45.480
 blown AIDS and short, I mean, there's gotta be life expectancy. But these are such,

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:53.560
 I'll evade your question, reframe it. I think we understand, and a lot of this is a function of

1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:56.680
 the propaganda at the time, and I'm not using the word propaganda in a negative sense,

1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:02.840
 the horrors of Hitler and Nazism. I think, and one of the things I'm trying to solve with my

1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:10.440
 upcoming book, there is a very poor understanding about the horrors of Stalinism and what that

1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:15.400
 meant in practice. One of the reasons I wrote Dear Reader, my North Korea book, and what I was

1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:21.880
 shocked and delighted by when I started writing Dear Reader, I thought to myself, look, I have

1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:27.880
 very little capacity to affect change. But I can tell stories. I can write books. This is my

1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:34.120
 competency. If I move the needle in America, we got a pretty good here. If I move the needle in

1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:38.760
 North Korea, this could have really profound positive consequences. And so I set a very limited

1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:44.440
 goal. And that goal is to change the conversation about North Korea, to stop it being regarded as

1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:52.360
 a laughing stock, and start regarding it as a existential horror. And the metaphor I use always,

1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.680
 and we brought up earlier, was the Joker. Because people look at Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il, his

1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:01.880
 father, they look at a clown, this guy's a buffoon, and that's valid. And I go, and I said,

1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:05.800
 this is what I can do. I can move that camera a little bit. And now that camera, instead of

1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:12.200
 looking at Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il, you see behind him literally millions of corpses. And when you

1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:16.920
 see people putting on these performances and these shows, look at these fools, then you're like,

1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:21.480
 everyone, those people, their kid has a gun to their head right now. If someone puts a gun to

1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:25.560
 your kid's head, you're going to put on a clown makeup. Yeah, you are. What color? Put on the

1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:33.640
 shoes, whatever you want. So in terms of, people do not appreciate the horrors of Stalinism.

1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:38.680
 I think this is a big fault of the right wing. You can't expect necessarily New York Times to do

1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:44.200
 this because of the blood on their hands. And for a long time, I was berating conservatives. I go,

1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:49.320
 this was the big right wing victory, bloodless largely, the victory of the Soviet Union. No

1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:54.200
 one's talking about it. No one's informing. And let's be clear, there are very many people who

1:51:54.200 --> 1:51:58.200
 are Democrats who are on the left, who are violently opposed, literally violently opposed to

1:51:58.200 --> 1:52:03.960
 the Soviet Union and its horrors. This is not necessarily a partisan issue. And I'm like,

1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:08.120
 all right, I'm going to do something about it. So I know that's not really literally your question,

1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:12.600
 but you know, that's kind of information that feeds. Let me ask you that question if it's okay.

1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:21.080
 So what, which do we, can we learn more from from a historical perspective of looking forward from,

1:52:21.080 --> 1:52:28.360
 like which has more lessons in how to avoid it, how to, and just general lessons about human

1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:34.360
 nature? Well, I mean, I agree with Michael that it's not important who's more evil because they're

1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:40.600
 both evil and they're both just so evil that the differences don't matter. What matters is

1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:48.760
 what is the ideology? What is the, what is, what are the consequences? What do we understand from

1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:55.160
 it? What are we worried about? What are we going to avoid? So I'm not worried about Nazism,

1:52:55.160 --> 1:53:01.560
 Quan Nazism, because everybody hates Nazism. I mean, it's uniform that that's out. Even

1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:07.000
 the people I think on the far right in America are staying away from the cliches of Nazism,

1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:12.520
 some of them are stupid enough not to. But in the end, if the United States goes authoritarian

1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:20.760
 right, it's not going to be Nazism. It'll be some other form of fascism because that is so obviously,

1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:25.960
 you know, being understood as evil and bad that there's almost no understanding that evil of

1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:32.520
 communism. I mean, you brought it up earlier, right? Almost nobody understands that communism

1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:38.840
 is an evil ideology that there's nothing worthwhile there that any, any attempt to go in that direction

1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:45.080
 in any sustainable way is destructive. They are, as you mentioned, they're economists out there

1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:50.280
 claiming they are communists. I mean, I find that spickable that anybody would claim to be a

1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:57.160
 communist economist or communist anything, because I think that's, it's, it's, it's an ideology that

1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:02.760
 has no basis, but we haven't learned that. So to me, communism is the much bigger threat,

1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:09.320
 because we still think it's some kind of beautiful ideal in the world around us.

1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:14.920
 I think Nazism is out, but I think, I think fascism is a, is a massive threat out there,

1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:20.120
 because I don't think we've learned real lessons of nobody knows what Nazism is. Everybody thinks

1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:24.840
 fascism is Nazism. They don't, they don't recognize that in a sense we already fascist,

1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:29.000
 and they were certainly heading in that direction. So they don't know what it is. And again, we haven't

1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:33.720
 studied, and the real lesson here is we haven't studied what unifies them both, because there's

1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:38.760
 not a big difference between fascism and communism. There's no big difference between Nazism and

1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:45.400
 communism. What unifies them? What unifies them is the common good, the public interest. What

1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:51.320
 unifies them is this idea that there is some elite group of people who can run our lives for us,

1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:57.160
 for the common good, for the public interest. And that you don't matter. You as an individual,

1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:02.360
 you individual don't matter, and they, they will dictate how you live. And, you know, so these

1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:07.080
 are philosopher kings. It goes back to Plato's philosophy, but it really unifies it. Think

1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:12.040
 about communism. Communism is about the sacrifice of the individual to the proletarian. Who is the

1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:17.720
 proletarian? It's this collective group here. Who represents the proletarian? Well, they have,

1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:21.320
 somebody has to, somebody has to tell the proletarian what they believe in, because they don't know,

1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:25.480
 because there is no collective consciousness. So you need a Stalin. And this is the point

1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:32.840
 about Marxism. Marxism needs a dictator, because somebody has to represent the, the, the, the,

1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:38.920
 the values, the, the, the public interest, what's good for the public. Nazism needs the same thing,

1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:44.440
 just Nazism replaced proletarian with Aryans, the Aryan race. And you have exactly the same thing,

1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:48.360
 you need a dictator to tell us what's good for the Aryan people, so we can do what's good for

1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:52.760
 the Aryan people. So it's impossible to have a communist system or a fascist system without

1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:57.480
 a dictator naturally emerging. It's not, it's not possible to have a Georgia. It's ideologically.

1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:01.960
 It's absolutely impossible to have that on, on scale. You can certainly have communes

1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.360
 where people behave communistically. Because it's not inside the ideology.

1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:09.560
 Hold on. Let me talk about this because let's talk about fascism, because fascism

1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:14.120
 definitely is going to have a strongman. I don't even know how it could be fascism without that.

1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:18.280
 And let's talk, what you said earlier on is about how people don't know what fascism is.

1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:23.160
 Fascists don't know what fascism is. So there's a superb book by John Diggins from the early

1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:28.520
 seventies called Mussolini and Fascism, The View from America. So I find Mussolini to be a far

1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:33.000
 more interesting figure than Hitler, because he had a much more nuanced career. He was much more

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.440
 of an innovator. He was an intellectual. He was an intellectual. He was shocking because he always

1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:45.080
 comes across as a buffoon. But he was actually a thinker. Hold on. So one of the things with

1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:53.240
 fascism is it's a direct line from Kant to Mussolini. So basically, there is a philosopher

1:56:53.240 --> 1:56:58.600
 who I adore, who I'm sure you don't, called Schopenhauer. And Schopenhauer, the question became,

1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:04.840
 Rand was not a particularly humorous person. She had some moments of wit. There's a great

1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:10.280
 moment when she was on Tom Snyder's show in 1980, I believe, and she's talking about Kant.

1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:14.920
 And she goes, Immanuel Kant and all his illegitimate children, if you catch my meaning,

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:19.160
 she mean all his bastards. But the host, Tom Snyder, did not pick up on it. If you watch it

1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:23.800
 on YouTube, you could pick up on it. And what happened was once Kant bifurcated reality into

1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:29.480
 the phenomenal world, the pure idea world and the numinal world, the question became, well,

1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:34.920
 what is the nature of this world of ideas? And Hegel had it meant reason. I don't know,

1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:40.760
 even know what that means, theoretically, that the world of reason is idea. And this is Schopenhauer,

1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:45.560
 who hated Hegel, who constantly attacked him by name and Hegel's followers in his work.

1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:51.480
 He was a very big innovator in a malevolent way, because he said the nature of reality,

1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:57.960
 this idea is will, meaning the universe doesn't care about you. And it's constantly in this

1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:04.040
 reality, putting urges in your mind values. And when you denounce these values and urges,

1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:09.640
 that's the basis of morality. And from there, it went to Nietzsche. And the will isn't mindless,

1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:17.160
 it is a will to power. Mussolini took this and basically said, because the will to power

1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:24.200
 is the real reality, the Kantian idea, therefore, all of this is secondary. So if we will it,

1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:32.120
 we can make it happen. When you have this concept of my willpower is stronger than reality, and

1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:37.880
 you're like, okay, how's this program going to work? We can make it happen. That was why fascism

1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:43.800
 is not a very coherent ideology, because explicitly, there's a book called from 1936,

1:58:43.800 --> 1:58:47.960
 called The Philosophy of Fascism, which tried to codify this 36. This is a long time ago,

1:58:47.960 --> 1:58:54.760
 where they're like, we're against reason and explicitly rationality. We are for willpower,

1:58:54.760 --> 1:59:02.200
 for strength. And if you are strong enough and united enough, you can force these things to work.

1:59:02.200 --> 1:59:08.040
 So there's a lot that is not taught about this ideology. I highly recommend people read the

1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:14.200
 books from the time. And what was fascinating about Mussolini is he was regarded as the moderate.

1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:20.200
 Because the 1930s, you had the Great Depression, all the intellectuals said this proves

1:59:20.200 --> 1:59:25.320
 capitalism can't work. The Great Depression, obviously, air quotes, is capitalism's fault.

1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:30.520
 Then you have the alternative, the USSR. Well, that's not tenable for us. Here comes Mussolini.

1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:36.120
 And Mussolini says, I'm going to take the best of both worlds. I have aspects of markets, capitalism,

1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:41.560
 but I don't have this chaos, but I also don't have complete government control of the bureaucrats.

1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:45.880
 I'm going to have this combination. And there was a Broadway song, You're the Top,

1:59:45.880 --> 1:59:50.920
 You're Mussolini. That was later edited out, because that's when he took a bad turn. But

1:59:50.920 --> 1:59:57.880
 this is kind of the fascist idea. And it's about power, and it's about control. That's the essence.

1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:04.040
 It's about will. So they don't care. Fascists don't care who owns stuff, owns in quotes, because

2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:10.760
 what's important is who controls it. So you can own your home. But if I get to tell you when you

2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:15.000
 can sell it, for how much you can sell it, and what you can do on that home, then I'm in control

2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.440
 of it. That's the essence of fascism. And if you think about it, we live today in a much more

2:00:20.440 --> 2:00:27.560
 fascist economic context than anything else. We pretend that corporations are private. But when

2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:33.720
 everything they do is regulated, who they can hire, how much they pay them, when and how they can

2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:41.480
 fire them, what they can do in their property, it's all control. That's the way fascists start

2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:46.120
 controlling everything. But it's not possible to have checks on power and balance on power

2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:52.280
 at the top of fascism or communist systems. The question was whether in fascist systems or communist

2:00:52.280 --> 2:01:00.120
 systems, we're saying the dictator naturally or must emerge. If I don't say emerge, the dictator

2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:06.280
 is the one who makes the fascist system. Yeah, fascism, well, it is, it could emerge. Because

2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:11.800
 for example, I think today in America, we're moving much more towards fascism, socialism,

2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:16.840
 and at some point that manifests itself in some kind of dictator. And the dictator might be different

2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:23.400
 than a Mussolini on Nazis. It might be couched in some kind of pseudo constitutional American

2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:27.960
 presets. It would be a lot easier for a female to be a fascist dictator in America than a male,

2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:31.560
 because do you have that softness? She's not going to come off as a strong woman. People

2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:36.520
 won't see it coming, in my opinion. Maybe. I think it's going to be, I have my own view. I think it's

2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:41.880
 going to be a nationalist, religious, environmentalist. I think somebody who can combine those three.

2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:45.400
 Well, Hitler did those, yeah. Yeah, exactly. And somebody who can combine those three and

2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:49.240
 articulate the case for it, I think America's ready. So you think it's possible for fascism

2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:54.120
 to arise in the world again? Oh, of course. It has never went away. It just adopt the name.

2:01:54.120 --> 2:02:00.440
 And because the fundamental ideas, the Kantian ideas, the ideas that are behind fascism never

2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:05.400
 went away. They're still as popular, if anything, more popular. Then they were back there and Marx

2:02:05.400 --> 2:02:12.040
 is as popular. I think these ideas are prevalent. They're out there and absolutely, I think America

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:17.080
 is ready for them. Again, it won't be quite in the form that we've experienced in the past. It'll

2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:22.200
 be in a uniquely American form, couched at a flag. And of course, it was couched at a flag before.

2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:29.480
 But no, yes, in authoritarian, some form of authoritarianism is necessary because the fundamental

2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:36.280
 principle behind both communism and fascism is the in unimportance of the individual. The individual

2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:42.120
 is nothing. The individual is a nobody and the importance of the collective, the collective

2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:46.760
 of the collective will, the collective soul, the collective consciousness, but the collective has

2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:51.960
 no will has no soul has no consciousness. So somebody has to emerge to speak for the collective.

2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:58.600
 Otherwise, everything falls apart. Right. So it's, it's necessary, whether it's a committee or

2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:02.760
 whether it's one person, how exactly create somebody has to speak for the collective.

2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:07.720
 Even a committee doesn't function as a committee, right? Most committees, particularly when the

2:03:07.720 --> 2:03:13.080
 committee is about dictating how people should live. Somebody is going to, because now it becomes

2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:16.920
 really, really important. Somebody is going to dominate that committee and rule over it

2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:20.360
 because you don't want independent source, independent voices, because the individual

2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:24.200
 doesn't matter. And also people, natural hierarchicals, you have seven people, they're

2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:28.200
 ostensibly have the same role. Someone is going to emerge as a leader naturally. And some people

2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:31.720
 are going to be called. Yeah, it's the same reason you cannot have the Richard Wolfe type

2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:38.600
 socialism of, and this is the more, if you will, innocent part of his ideas. Oh, why can't we have

2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:44.200
 corporations all be worker owned and everybody votes on everything and we vote on who should be

2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:54.600
 CEO. And no, communism, fascism, most ideas necessitate ultimately authoritarians. And that's

2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:59.640
 most of human history we forget again. This idea of liberty, this idea of freedom,

2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:04.040
 even the limited freedom we have today. It's a recent invention. It's a recent invention.

2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:08.440
 It happens in little pockets throughout history. You know, we had a little bit of this democracy

2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:13.320
 stuff, partial, only a few, you know, some people got to vote and it wasn't rights respecting

2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:17.000
 because they didn't have the concept of rights in Athens, right? Yet in a few Greek cities,

2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:21.400
 we maybe had a version of it in Venice, we had a version of it in city states around the world.

2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:26.440
 But then it was invented by the founding fathers in this country. That's what makes the founding

2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:31.800
 of America so important and so different and such a radical thing to have happened historically.

2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:38.200
 Freedom is rare. Authoritarianism is common. So I was looking at some statistics that 53%

2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:44.600
 of people in the world live under authoritarian government. Only 53. Oh, because India is

2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:51.720
 is democratic. So I guess they don't count India. But yes, it used to be 100. Exactly.

2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:59.720
 And even the authoritarianism in a country like China is a lot less than it used to be

2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:04.920
 under Mao, right? So I would, you know, they were better off than they were under Mao.

2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:12.040
 That's a reality. How do we change it? We have to change the ethical views of people.

2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:18.920
 This brings us back to selfishness. Because as long as the standard of morality is the group,

2:05:19.640 --> 2:05:24.280
 others, as long as the standard of value is what other people want, what other people think,

2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:30.520
 as long as you are alive, only to be sacrificed to the group, that's why you have to challenge

2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:37.640
 Christianity. As long as the Jesus on a cross dying for other people's sin is viewed as this noble,

2:05:37.640 --> 2:05:42.680
 wonderful act instead of one of the most unjust things that ever happened to anybody, as long as

2:05:42.680 --> 2:05:46.760
 the common good and the public interest are the standards by which we evaluate things,

2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:51.080
 we will always drift towards fascism, some form of authoritarianism.

2:05:51.880 --> 2:05:56.040
 Can I answer your question? I think there's something that has to go along with what your

2:05:56.040 --> 2:06:00.680
 own was saying. And I know he's going to agree with me, which is technology. Because if it becomes

2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:08.120
 harder technologically for the authoritarian and more expensive for him to enforce his edicts,

2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:12.840
 that is going to create a pocket of freedom regardless of what the masses think. Hold on,

2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:16.600
 let me finish. The masses as a rule are not going to be able to think in general anyway.

2:06:17.240 --> 2:06:21.160
 I have a much more elitist view of mankind than Randolph's. Let me give you one specific example,

2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:26.600
 which I mentioned in my book, The New Right. Let's suppose it's 1990, not that long ago,

2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:31.720
 we all remember 1990, and we're having an argument about censorship. And Yaron says,

2:06:31.720 --> 2:06:37.400
 I want full freedom of the press, freedom of books, publish whatever you want, whatever, free speech.

2:06:37.400 --> 2:06:42.040
 And I say, well, what about books like Mein Kampf? What about people read this with the wrong idea?

2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:45.880
 What about child pornography, things like this? Where are you going to draw the line? And we

2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:51.720
 could argue along. Lex appears from the future and he goes, hey, guys, this conversation is moot.

2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:56.680
 And we're like, Lex, you look exactly the same. I'm like, yeah, of course, robust on age. And you

2:06:56.680 --> 2:07:03.640
 go, I'm from the future. And I go, wait a minute, black president. And you go, look, this conversation

2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:09.960
 is moot because in a few years from now, you will be able to send any book anywhere on earth at the

2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:17.320
 speed of light. You can make infinite copies in one second. And you could send it to anyone such

2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:22.360
 that they can only open this book if they know a magic word. And I go, well, how much is this

2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:27.960
 going to cost? Oh, it's free. And I go, wait, wait, you're telling me I can make infinite copies of

2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:33.880
 any book and teleport them at the speed of light anywhere for free. And you would say, yes, we

2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:39.960
 would think he's insane. But that's the status quo, right? So technology has done far more

2:07:39.960 --> 2:07:45.960
 to fight government censorship of literature and ideas than has spreading the right ideas.

2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:50.120
 So when you have things like crypto, which makes money less accessible than a gold

2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:54.280
 block in your house, when you have things like people being able to travel quickly,

2:07:54.280 --> 2:08:00.520
 those are also necessary compliments to having the right ideas. And Rand herself said

2:08:01.080 --> 2:08:04.760
 that she couldn't have come up with her philosophy before the industrial revolution.

2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:09.640
 So as time goes forward, and we have more technology, and we have more discourse.

2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:14.920
 But for a very difficult reason to say that, but it's also a lot easier to persuade people

2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:20.440
 the right idea. So I kind of agree. Maybe I'm more pessimistic, or maybe I don't get that

2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:27.080
 technology completely. That's because you're a boomer. There you go. Okay, boomer. I get that

2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:34.040
 itself a lot. I think I'm the last year of the boomer generation. I think I hit that last year.

2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:40.760
 It's a mindset. There you go. I love you so much. So the reason she said she couldn't develop her,

2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:45.960
 the reason she said she couldn't develop the philosophy without the industrial revolution

2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:53.960
 is the link between reason and wealth was not obvious before the industrial revolution.

2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:58.040
 And that, for example, it's not obvious to Aristotle. Aristotle doesn't see the link between

2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:06.760
 rationality and wealth creation. Business is low. And money is barren. Money is barren.

2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:12.600
 Your interest has no productive function. Bankers don't have. So you had to see it

2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:16.280
 existentially to be able to see reason is the source of wealth creation.

2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:23.400
 So I think that's a little different. Now, there is a sense in which, yes, technology

2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:29.320
 makes it more difficult for authoritarians to achieve their authoritarianism. I wouldn't,

2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:33.240
 I'm not convinced that they can't. I didn't say can't. Yeah. Okay. I didn't say can't.

2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:37.080
 Yeah. So at a certain point, they can turn off the electricity. I'm just saying it becomes

2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:41.160
 more expensive. It becomes more expensive. No question. It becomes more expensive.

2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:48.360
 And we're still beings that live in a physical reality. Therefore, they can still harm us in

2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:52.760
 this physical reality. But let me say this, like, it's going to sound as absurd. If there was

2:09:52.760 --> 2:09:56.600
 technology that we could teleport anywhere on Earth at the speed of light, that would certainly

2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:01.480
 go a long way towards hurting authoritarianism. If there was some way to go. And because they

2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:07.240
 could teleport too. And this is of course the danger of they can use the technology too.

2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:12.280
 And look at what the Chinese are doing with social scores and with monitoring people and

2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:17.080
 cameras everywhere. So there's a sense in which you probably had more privacy before some of

2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:23.640
 the technology. So it's not obvious to me that, so to me, it's all about ideas. And if we don't

2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:28.840
 get the ideas right, technology will be used for evil. Yes. And it will allow some of us maybe

2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:36.520
 to escape for a little while in some realms, but others not. Iran and North Korea do a pretty good

2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:42.360
 job shutting themselves away from technology, although a lot gets through in the Iranian,

2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:45.640
 at least with Iran. I don't know about North Korea, how much gets through.

2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:47.560
 It's real undermining them, which is wonderful.

2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:53.640
 Yeah, which is great. So yes. But it's more than that. And this is what leads me to be optimistic.

2:10:53.640 --> 2:11:00.440
 It's that we live in a world today where seven billion people basically have access to all of

2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:07.000
 human knowledge, all of human knowledge. It's not like in Rome, when Rome fell, all of human

2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:10.840
 knowledge disappeared. Now some of it escaped to Byzantines, some of them the Byzantines had

2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:14.440
 and ultimately landed up with the Arabs and found its way back into Western civilization

2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:19.400
 through them. But a lot of knowledge disappeared, just wiped out, right? How to build a dome,

2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:24.840
 how to build a big dome, how to have, you know, in Pompeii, they had faucets, they're running water

2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:31.800
 in faucets. They didn't have faucets for another thousand years, right? A lot of, they couldn't

2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:37.000
 build tall buildings once Rome came down. The Great Pyramid of Egypt was the tallest building

2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:42.040
 on earth till like 1840. It was crazy. Rome was a city of a million people. Other than China,

2:11:42.040 --> 2:11:46.520
 there wasn't another city of a million people in the West until London in the 19th century,

2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:52.760
 1500 years later. So it all disappeared because all of it was concentrated basically in one place.

2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:57.000
 Today, none of that exists because of the internet, because of universities everywhere,

2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:00.200
 institutions. I mean, think about how many engineers they are in the world today,

2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:05.560
 right? And who have basically all, definitely basically the same level of knowledge on how

2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:10.840
 to build stuff. So even if the United States went to some kind of dark ages, it's unlikely the whole

2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:16.600
 world goes into that kind of dark ages. So I am optimistic in that sense that the diffusion of

2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:22.440
 knowledge is so broad today that other than wiping out all the electricity on the planet,

2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:27.000
 everything electronic on the planet, it's just, it's not going to be possible to control us all.

2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:33.480
 And in that sense, technology is going to make it possible for us to survive and to stay semi free

2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:37.000
 because I don't think full freedom, but semi free, because full freedom, you need the ideas,

2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:39.720
 because full freedom means you need some political implementation.

2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:41.480
 No, full freedom means anarchy, but we know that.

2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:47.560
 We need to get into that, because we can't leave without pointing out that we fundamentally

2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:53.640
 disagree about that. Oh, that's beautiful to be continued on that one. Let me ask about one

2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:58.920
 particular technology that I've been learning a lot about, thinking a lot about, talking about,

2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:04.040
 which is Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, but Bitcoin specifically, which a lot of people

2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:13.000
 argue that the Bitcoin, that setting ideas aside, when you look at practical tools that

2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:17.800
 governments use to manipulate as people is inflation of the monetary system, within the

2:13:17.800 --> 2:13:25.240
 monetary system. And so they see Bitcoin as a way for the, for individuals to fight that,

2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:32.200
 to go outside those specific government control systems, and thereby sort of decentralizing

2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:37.480
 power. There's a case to be made historic of the 20th century that you couldn't have Stalin,

2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:41.640
 you couldn't have Hitler, you couldn't have much of the evil that you see in the world

2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:44.920
 if they couldn't control the monetary system. You couldn't have had the New Deal,

2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.800
 and FDR realized this very quickly. Very confiscated all the gold. Everybody knows

2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:56.440
 FDR is going to come into, to become president and confiscate the gold. So one of the mythologies,

2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:03.400
 the myths about the Great Depression is that there were all these bank runs that, well bank

2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:08.600
 runs happened because everybody was afraid that FDR would get elected, confiscate the gold. So

2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:12.680
 everybody ran to the bank and took the gold. Little did they realize that he would confiscate

2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:17.000
 their private holdings in their own backyards. He would dig, he would force them to dig up the

2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.920
 golds from their own backyards. But yes, one of the first things FDR did in spite of denying it

2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:24.760
 throughout the campaign, right? He was asked about this over and over again and denied it.

2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:29.320
 One of the first things was, was take over the gold and take the United States to the

2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:33.880
 Federal Reserve off the gold standard so that they can in a sense print money and that he

2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:38.360
 could start spending. Yeah, what people don't realize just to clarify what you're on said is

2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:42.600
 FDR, this is something that's so crazy to us that we think, okay, I'm misunderstanding it.

2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:49.720
 FDR made it illegal for people to own gold unless it's like a wedding ring. And before that

2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:55.160
 contracts, because inflation was a concern, I make a contract with your loan, right? I said,

2:14:55.160 --> 2:15:00.840
 okay, you're either going to pay me in $1,500 for my work or the gold equivalent. Because

2:15:00.840 --> 2:15:05.080
 if that $1,500, you know, you know, Weimar Germany and you have hyperinflation,

2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:11.080
 I don't want that $1,500, just give me the gold bullion. And FDR said all of those clauses,

2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:18.440
 he broke every contract. They don't matter. So now if I say, Iran says, okay, you owe me

2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:23.560
 three feet of drywall. And I go, here's three feet of drywall. It's 12 inches. And you go,

2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:27.720
 wait, wait, wait, three feet is 36 inches. You go, no, no, not anymore. What am I supposed to do?

2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:32.760
 And because you have, when you print more money, the value of every individual dollar

2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:39.080
 matters less, it becomes that much harder to plan anything, either in the government level or in

2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:44.360
 the private level, because if I'm managing outlays, if I'm trying to pay my workers, I'm trying to

2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:48.840
 build factories, I'm thinking long term. And I don't know what this dollar is going to buy in 10

2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:54.600
 years. That puts an enormous incentive for me to spend it now and not save it. Because if I save

2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:58.600
 it, it's going to be worth a lot less. And the worst thing about inflation, and this is something

2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:02.600
 I think people who are procapitalism don't talk about enough. They do talk about, I would just

2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:10.680
 like to see it more. This by far hurts the poorest of the poor the most. When we came to this country,

2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:16.280
 my mom told me they would go to 86th Street in Bensonhurst with the fruit stands to buy me some

2:16:16.280 --> 2:16:21.240
 grapes. And you go to this fruit stand and she'd walk all the way to the other corner. And if it

2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:25.560
 was three cents more a pound or less a pound, she'd walk all the way back because that three

2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:31.720
 cents mattered. Now, if I have this dollar and it's 5% inflation, whatever, and next year it's 95

2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:37.640
 cents, me and you, the three of us might not care. But if I'm destitute hand to mouth and I've got

2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:45.960
 5% less, that is really a material consequence of my life. So inflation really is evil because it

2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:50.280
 hurts the people for who those pennies matter. Well, one of the ways the government gets around

2:16:50.280 --> 2:16:55.640
 that, and it's because they get smart to that, is they index everything. So they index your

2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:00.440
 Social Security, they index welfare, they try to make sure. But that only makes you more dependent

2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:05.560
 on them. And the people in the modern context, the saving hurts the most, the inflation hurts

2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:11.160
 the most, the savers. People trying to save money and Fed policy right now is just horrific if

2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:16.680
 you're a saver, right? Because the Fed is, interest rates are zero, you get nothing on your saving.

2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:22.520
 And cost of living is going up, maybe not at a huge level, but is going up. And yet you can't

2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:31.800
 even save to keep the value of your dollars. And the government controls, and this has massive

2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:37.240
 perverse effects because it's not just the prices go up. It's the prices don't reflect

2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:42.520
 reality anymore. So some prices go up, some prices might not. Investments get distorted,

2:17:42.520 --> 2:17:47.160
 things get produced that shouldn't get produced. And then people like Richard Wolfe turn around

2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:52.440
 and blame all the distortions and the perversions and the crashes and the financial crisis on

2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:56.840
 capitalism. Not on the fact that the Fed, look at the financial crisis. Financial crisis was

2:17:56.840 --> 2:18:01.640
 caused, you could argue by inflation. And we could get into that if you wanted, but that's probably a

2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:06.680
 three hour show, just that, right? It was caused by the Fed reserve. And yet who got blamed for

2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:10.440
 the financial crisis? Who would Richard Wolfe is going to jump up and down? This is a crisis of

2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:14.040
 capitalism. This was caused by capitalism. But capitalism is the negation of the Fed.

2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:20.440
 Capitalism says there should be no Fed. That's item number one on the list of the things

2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:28.280
 capitalists want is to get rid of the Fed and then grant you guys your wish, have competition for

2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:33.080
 currency and let's see if Bitcoin wins. I'm skeptical, but I don't care. My point is under

2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:40.040
 freedom. I don't care who wins. I just want free choices and let the best currency win. I doubt

2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:45.560
 that becomes Bitcoin, but it doesn't really matter if I'm wrong. Great. Let me add to this. And I

2:18:45.560 --> 2:18:50.280
 think people appreciate, and this is a leftist, leftism at its best, that the government and the

2:18:50.280 --> 2:18:53.160
 banks are in bed with each other. This I don't think is particularly controversial statement.

2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:56.280
 Well, I don't like that statement. Let me just say why I don't like it. I mean,

2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:00.760
 I don't like it because it assumes that they're equal partners or that this causality goes in

2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:06.680
 both directions. From day one, and this was really from day one of the establishment of

2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:11.400
 the United States, banks have been regulated by the state. And the reason for that is primarily

2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:17.400
 Jefferson and others founders distrust of financial, of finance. So from the beginning,

2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:23.720
 banks have been controlled by the state. Now, over time, if I'm controlling you,

2:19:23.720 --> 2:19:28.200
 you won't have influence over me because I get to, so yes, they get into bed over time. But

2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:33.000
 so I don't like it that they're in bed together. One is dominating over the other and the other

2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:37.000
 is participating because what choice do they have? I should explain to you how things work when

2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:43.400
 you get to bed in bed and it's not always equal. Well, okay. So let's talk about safeguards,

2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:48.280
 which is very randy and topic. She doesn't like those. I had to read that scene three times in

2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:54.440
 the fountain head. I was like, no, because I'm like, I looked at the back cover. I'm like a woman

2:19:54.440 --> 2:20:00.200
 wrote this book in 1943. I must be misunderstanding this scene. She sure had a lot of shades of gray.

2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:08.040
 Yeah. So she hated that. Only black and white. No, but what I meant is 2008, right? You have the

2:20:08.040 --> 2:20:13.240
 bailout of Wall Street. Whereas in 2020, we saw every medium and small business under the sun go

2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:17.960
 under. There's not even a pretense that these are going to be bailed out. So the priorities of the

2:20:17.960 --> 2:20:22.680
 politicians, in my view, are always going to be towards powerful entities, powerful corporations,

2:20:22.680 --> 2:20:26.680
 and they're not going to be about the medium guy, the middle guy. Let me just finish my point because

2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:33.000
 I see you champing at the bit. At the very least, if you have regulation, people influencing each

2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:41.480
 other with Bitcoin and with crypto, that is not a possibility. You do not have any agency who is

2:20:41.480 --> 2:20:47.640
 king of Bitcoin, who is the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin. There is no organizing organization or

2:20:47.640 --> 2:20:52.760
 management team. Now, you could say this is a bad thing, but you can't say that this is a

2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:57.320
 different thing to money as opposed to Federal Reserve system. Yeah. So I agree with that

2:20:57.320 --> 2:21:02.600
 description of Bitcoin. My problem is Bitcoin elsewhere. Let me just say about the financial

2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:10.680
 crisis. I don't like it phrased that way again. They let Lehman go under and destroyed Lehman

2:21:10.680 --> 2:21:17.640
 Brothers. In the past, they destroyed Drexel Burnham because they didn't like Michael Malkin.

2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:24.200
 They are vindictive. It's not an accident that the Treasury Secretary at the time was an ex

2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:29.480
 chairman of Goldman Sachs, not Lehman Brothers, and Goldman hates Lehman. On the next day,

2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:35.000
 they bail out AIG. What I got out of financial crisis more than anything, and by the way,

2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:39.880
 there wasn't a bailout. So it wasn't even a bailout because they gave money to every bank

2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:46.200
 whether they had problems or not. And indeed, I know several bankers, including big banks like

2:21:46.200 --> 2:21:51.800
 JP Morgan and West Fargo and a friend of mine, John Allison of BB&T, who told them explicitly,

2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:56.280
 we don't want your money. We don't need your money. And they were basically a gun was put to

2:21:56.280 --> 2:21:59.720
 their head and they said, you don't take the money. We'll shut you down basically,

2:21:59.720 --> 2:22:07.400
 right? The equivalent of that. And so they wanted a virtue signal. So there's a big virtue

2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:11.400
 signal. We're taking care of things. Don't worry. We've got everything under control,

2:22:11.400 --> 2:22:16.520
 even though they were completely panicking and they had no clue what they were doing. One of the

2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:24.680
 things that the financial crisis really illustrated was how pathetic, ignorant, and incompetent

2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:29.080
 the people at the top are. And they knew it. And they, you know, so Paulson goes to Congress,

2:22:29.080 --> 2:22:34.440
 says, give me $700 billion. Don't tell me how to use it because I have no clue. Just give it to me

2:22:34.440 --> 2:22:39.000
 and give me your authoritarian power to do it in any way I want. And that was not out of a sense

2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:45.240
 of grandeur. That was a sense of panic. He had no idea. He had no clue. None of them did. They

2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:50.280
 bailed out everybody they could, everybody under the, you know, within their periphery.

2:22:50.280 --> 2:22:54.920
 When they thought it was appropriate, they were vindictive about some people like Lehman.

2:22:54.920 --> 2:23:00.440
 It was complete arbitrary use of power. The bankers didn't benefit from this. Indeed,

2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:06.120
 many bankers who took their money lost from it. Bank stocks got crushed after the bailout.

2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:10.360
 Before the bailout, bank stocks were doing okay. And right after top was announced,

2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:14.520
 bank stocks crushed because this was bad for banks. It wasn't good for banks.

2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:22.120
 This is just central planning gone amuck. It's, it's not them bailing out elites. It's them,

2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:26.120
 you know, throwing money at a problem without knowing what they would actually

2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:29.800
 do and what the consequences would be. Right. But the point is, sorry to,

2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:34.680
 where we agree, the focus will always be on bailing out elites. It's almost.

2:23:34.680 --> 2:23:37.480
 But the little banks got money too. No, what I was saying about last year,

2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:43.960
 there's no talk of saving ice and vice, saving century 21, saving all these other industries.

2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:47.480
 But should they were, if you look at this, it's just, sure there was, if you look at the,

2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:53.320
 if you look at what the Fed did, the Fed was bailing out third, fourth class businesses

2:23:53.320 --> 2:23:59.400
 in all kinds of areas that you wouldn't consider elitist areas. The OPPP, the way they're

2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:01.640
 2008. Yeah. No, I'm talking about now. Okay.

2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:06.040
 I'm talking about COVID last year. What the Fed did was unbelievable. The kind of bonds that

2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:10.760
 they were buying even 2008, even after 2000, I couldn't believe what they did last year.

2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:16.040
 PPP, the payable protection program was targeted at everybody. Everybody got PPP.

2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:22.680
 It's not about, I don't think it's about bailing out elites. It's about securing their power base.

2:24:22.680 --> 2:24:26.040
 And if they believe that securing their power base is Wall Street, then they'll bail out Wall

2:24:26.040 --> 2:24:31.560
 Street. They believe securing their power base is writing checks to restaurant owners all over

2:24:31.560 --> 2:24:34.440
 the country. They'll write checks to restaurant owners all over the country, which is what they

2:24:34.440 --> 2:24:39.720
 did with PPP. It's all about power for them. And it's whatever will achieve power, whatever will

2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:44.280
 result in power. I don't think it's about elites. I don't see, I don't, I didn't see elitism in the

2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:49.320
 bailouts of last year. I agree. I agree it wasn't last year. I'm saying that's one distinction between

2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:55.560
 2008 and 2008. And I do think, just one more thing, I do think getting in good bed with the

2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:59.800
 elites is a great mechanism in general for maintaining one's power. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's

2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:05.000
 that's how we define it. Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You mentioned there's some criticism

2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:10.120
 towards Bitcoin. There's a lot of excitement about the technology of Bitcoin for the

2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:17.720
 the resistance against this kind of central state pursuit of power. So that's part of my

2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:24.200
 criticism because I don't think it works. So yeah, I can imagine a world. I can imagine,

2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:31.720
 I'd love to see a technology evolve that where money is competitive and it's, it's,

2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:35.960
 it's a financial instrument that the government cannot touch. You think the state is too powerful

2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:41.240
 and I think two things. I think, I think right now, and maybe this won't be true in the future,

2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:45.960
 right now, I think crypto is, it cannot function as money right now. It just can't.

2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:52.440
 But it does. No, it doesn't. It functions as a mechanism. It functions as a mechanism

2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:57.800
 to transfer. It's a technology that allows me to transfer fiat money from place to place,

2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:02.040
 but it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't function because, and it can't because it's too volatile.

2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:05.960
 Wait, wait, I've sold things with Bitcoin. No, I know you have. But I can sell things,

2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:09.720
 I can buy things and sell things with my airline miles. There are lots of ways in which you can

2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:14.040
 use things as money, but it doesn't make them money. So if you're using something as money,

2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:18.040
 so let me take something use, no, okay, so let me take something you said before and

2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:22.520
 contradicts I think Bitcoin. You said one of the things about money is that it's stable. I know

2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:26.760
 what it's going to buy tomorrow, right? And this is why we're against inflation because I know what

2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:30.280
 the dollar today, I can plan because I can't plan. I don't know what Bitcoin is going to be

2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:35.000
 with tomorrow. So I can't plan with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is way too volatile to serve right now

2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:41.960
 as money. Now, the argument from Bitcoin is, yes, it's still being adopted. At some point,

2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:47.720
 it'll reach a certain crucial mass. Yes, and then it will become money because at that point,

2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:54.200
 it can be used as money because they don't have a stable value. Maybe right now, it's not useful

2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:59.720
 as money because I can't predict what I can't invest in it knowing what the value will be in

2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:06.520
 five years. Right now, it's an asset. It's not a monetary unit. It's much more functions as an asset.

2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:10.120
 Assets value can go up. I agree. It's a function much more as an asset than as money. That's not

2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:17.640
 in dispute. So I don't think it's money. But so I think it's still, I think it can come

2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:23.240
 to compete as a money with something tangible. So I think in a free market, some kind of crypto

2:27:23.240 --> 2:27:29.240
 backed by gold would be more successful. So Bitcoin folks argue that Bitcoin has all the

2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:35.560
 same fundamental properties that does gold. So it's backed by, there's a scarcity to it

2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:42.120
 and it's backed by proof of work. So it's backed by physical resources. And so they say that's a

2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:46.760
 very natural replacement of gold. So it doesn't need to be connected to gold. So the two things

2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:54.120
 that gold has that it doesn't have. One is gold is not finite. Gold supply actually grows over time.

2:27:54.120 --> 2:27:59.640
 Bitcoin at some point is truly finite. At least unless you count the fact that you can split

2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:05.720
 bitcoins and create coins. But that's a whole other question. So that's one. The second is

2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:14.440
 that gold has value beyond its use as a currency, beyond its use as money.

2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:19.560
 For jewelry and stuff. Yeah. But you minimize that. But jewelry and stuff has been important

2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:24.680
 for the human race for 100,000 years. You can find jewelry in caves for the cavemen,

2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:29.720
 design jewelry and war them. So we obviously assume being valued jewelry a lot. And almost

2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:34.760
 all jewelry evolved to be made out of gold because whatever it is within us is attracted

2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:39.320
 to shiny gold in particular, shiny object generally. So there's something about gold

2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:43.320
 that appeals to human being. There's some value that gold has beyond its being a currency.

2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:49.080
 It doesn't. Bitcoin doesn't. Now it's not enough to use it as money. Lots of things appeal to

2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:54.520
 human beings. But those are two characteristics. One that it's not finite and second that it is

2:28:55.480 --> 2:29:00.920
 a value beyond that Bitcoin doesn't have. Don't you think the finiteness could be framed as a

2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:05.720
 feature, the scarcity of Bitcoin? No, because I think it creates a real problem with scarcity

2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:12.440
 economically. It's the issue of planning. There is a mechanism, there's a beautiful mechanism in

2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:18.600
 markets that as the supply of gold is, in a sense, the quantity of gold is,

2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:25.480
 prices are going down because there's too little gold. So the value of gold, in a sense,

2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:32.200
 in dollar terms, the prices are going down. What happens then is there's an incentive to then go

2:29:32.200 --> 2:29:37.880
 mine for more gold because it becomes cheaper and cheaper to mine as the price goes down. So you

2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:43.640
 mine for more gold so it keeps increasing and it keeps increasing, basically very correlated to the

2:29:43.640 --> 2:29:50.520
 rate of increasing productivity. That's the beauty of gold mining because prices are related to gold.

2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:55.880
 Gold is the dominant money and it increases at about the same rate as productivity. So it keeps

2:29:58.120 --> 2:30:02.840
 prices relatively stable. You still have bouts of inflation and deflation, but it keeps it

2:30:02.840 --> 2:30:08.680
 relatively stable. With Bitcoin, it's fine at its ends. Now prices will only decline. What rate

2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:13.240
 will they decline at? They'll decline at the rate of productivity increases. It's hard to predict

2:30:13.240 --> 2:30:17.400
 the rate through which productivity increases. For example, technological shocks can change

2:30:17.400 --> 2:30:23.720
 that dramatically. You could get bouts of dramatic deflation, dramatic price drops that could

2:30:25.160 --> 2:30:31.000
 be problematic in terms of planning the same problem of inflation just reversed that you had

2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:36.920
 before. Again, it's a technical issue. I'm sure there are ways to get around it. Again, I'm not

2:30:36.920 --> 2:30:43.160
 sure. I don't know if you guys consider Bitcoin the end or the beginning. That is, is Bitcoin

2:30:43.160 --> 2:30:47.240
 it or is Bitcoin just the first example of a technology that's evolving? I was just going to

2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:52.440
 say there's the same technological issue with regard to gold, which is we now have the technology

2:30:52.440 --> 2:30:58.040
 that was very expensive to turn elements into different elements. At a certain, yeah, you

2:30:58.040 --> 2:31:01.080
 could fire electrons at it or whatever. You can make gold. They figured out how to do it. It's

2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:08.040
 not cheap and it's, it's called big trust. If gold is the standard, a lot of resources are

2:31:08.040 --> 2:31:12.040
 going to be going toward turning other things into gold, making the production of gold cheaper,

2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:15.960
 and that's going to have a similar consequence that Lawrence talked about.

2:31:15.960 --> 2:31:19.640
 That's kind of the category of security that Bitcoin is talking about. That's very difficult

2:31:19.640 --> 2:31:24.120
 to do that with Bitcoin. But I would argue that it's exceptionally difficult to do that with gold.

2:31:24.120 --> 2:31:28.920
 It is now, but the thing is, there's not huge incentive. If gold is the basis and if gold is

2:31:28.920 --> 2:31:33.480
 worth that much, gold isn't worth that much. Gold is worth, let's say. I'm saying in this world

2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:36.840
 that we're talking about. In the future. In the future, yeah. Gold is not going to be worth,

2:31:36.840 --> 2:31:41.800
 let's say right now, gold is about $2,000. It's less than $2,000. Let's say $2,000. That's,

2:31:41.800 --> 2:31:46.680
 that's price in terms of dollars. So you'd have to, it would have to be worth your

2:31:46.680 --> 2:31:49.720
 wallet to create something of $2,000. How much would you be willing to put into it?

2:31:49.720 --> 2:31:53.160
 At some point, you're right. And at that point, I think gold stops being money.

2:31:53.160 --> 2:31:57.800
 Right. Because they're useless. Once I can create it like, like, like, like silicon,

2:31:57.800 --> 2:32:02.840
 then once I can make out official gold. So I'm just not, I don't think Bitcoin is the solution.

2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:07.560
 I think, you know, I don't know what the solution is. I wish I, I wish I was that innovative.

2:32:08.360 --> 2:32:13.320
 But I think, I think you need a solution that has more of the characteristics of gold

2:32:13.320 --> 2:32:19.240
 than Bitcoin currently has. And I guess I'm surprised at a lot of the technologists

2:32:19.240 --> 2:32:25.240
 who view Bitcoin as the end game, where it strikes me as it's a, it's the birth of a new

2:32:25.240 --> 2:32:29.400
 tech, it represents the birth of a new technology. And who the winner in that technology is going

2:32:29.400 --> 2:32:34.520
 to be, we have no clue. Bitcoin is one of the players. The other players, there might be a

2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:40.760
 new technology that is even better than anything we can imagine right now that, so Bitcoin doesn't

2:32:40.760 --> 2:32:44.200
 strike me as optimal and that, that we should be moving towards something better.

2:32:44.200 --> 2:32:50.600
 Can you please stop shilling RAND coin for five minutes? Yeah. You know,

2:32:50.600 --> 2:32:56.040
 whether it was RAND coin, it was RAND. So I was like, no, I was like, no, that's true.

2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:59.160
 No, I mean, I'm RAND is the South South African one dollar. Yeah.

2:32:59.160 --> 2:33:06.600
 I'm RAND coin was, I was in China in 20, I think it was 2015 or 14. China. China.

2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:13.560
 I was in China 20, something like that. And this entrepreneur came up to me. She said, she's,

2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:19.000
 she's bought this massive quantity of land in this area in China is a little secluded.

2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:24.280
 She's starting what she's calling golds, golds. And she's serious. And she's issuing, and she

2:33:24.280 --> 2:33:32.280
 issued cryptocurrency based on the land, right back by the land called RAND, but INRAND with a

2:33:32.280 --> 2:33:36.360
 little portrait of INRAND, you know, a little portrait in the, in the, in the marketing.

2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:39.160
 INRAND, I don't, I don't think it went anywhere. You're not going to be a janitor?

2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:44.520
 A janitor in China. Golds, golds, golds. Yeah. By the way, I do want to point

2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:49.800
 out something I do enjoy about Objectivist. I constantly talk about INRAND and her vampire

2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:56.600
 novels. And I, that's the joke you're on. Thank you. And inevitably, someone feels the need to

2:33:56.600 --> 2:34:00.920
 point out that she did not write vampire novels and her name is actually INRAND. So thank you.

2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:05.320
 Thank you. We've been talking for two hours. I owned her copy of the fountain head. Somehow

2:34:05.320 --> 2:34:11.640
 I thought her name was INRAND. Thank you. Thank you. INRAND is an anthem. So this is a really

2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:16.440
 interesting way of phrasing it, which is, I was kidding with the INRAND. I know you knew you,

2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:20.040
 how to pronounce it. Yeah, I know, you know, you know, that, you know, you just got confusing.

2:34:20.840 --> 2:34:24.600
 I think we all know, and we all know there were jokers here. We're all one. There's no

2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:29.640
 Batman in this conversation. Zero is the only one. So it's, that's an interesting way to frame it

2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:35.960
 is Bitcoin the end or the beginning of something. And I've, as sort of with an open mind and seeing

2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:40.520
 kind of all the possibilities of technologies out there, I also kind of thought that Bitcoin is the

2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:47.560
 beginning of something. But what the Bitcoin community argues is that Bitcoin is the end of

2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:53.640
 the base layer, meaning all the different innovations will come on top of it. Like for

2:34:53.640 --> 2:34:59.640
 example, there's something called lightning network, where it's basically just like gold is the end.

2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:04.600
 And everything is built like the monetary systems like cash and all that is built on top of gold.

2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:10.760
 Bitcoin is the end in that other technologies that build on top of Bitcoin. That's, that's their

2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:16.360
 argument. And I get that. And I hear that all the time. And I just, I, I don't quite understand

2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:21.400
 that. And I, and I think Bitcoin has limitations that potentially other cryptocurrencies might not

2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:26.360
 have. I, you know, my attitude towards something like this is the large extent, I don't understand

2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:38.600
 the technology. My view is, let it play out. I, I think I have more fear of physical the ability

2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:43.560
 of, of the government to crush these things than I think many in the community. So for example,

2:35:44.200 --> 2:35:50.200
 so I gave a talk between, you know, and they were hyping the acceptance now, a lot of, a lot of

2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:53.880
 vendors that will accept Bitcoin. And this is great. And I said, yeah, it's absolutely great.

2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:59.560
 More options is better than few options. But I said, you know, that that could be taken away

2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:04.120
 like that. Now it's true that we could exchange Bitcoin and the government that wouldn't know,

2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:09.880
 I think wouldn't know that we do. But once he's advertising on his website that he accepts Bitcoin,

2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:15.480
 or once he tries to turn his Bitcoin into particular goods, once you manifested in the

2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:20.040
 physical world, now the, the government can step in. So the government could say, you can't sell

2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:25.000
 anything to anybody using Bitcoin. They can do that. And you won't be able to sell it. It will

2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:28.840
 be have to go into the black market. So, but that isn't able to sell it just to just sell you in the

2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:32.200
 black market. Yeah. But that's where the government thrives, right? The government thrives on letting

2:36:32.200 --> 2:36:36.520
 you do stuff in the black market so they can decide when to put you in jail or not. Right. So, so if,

2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:40.680
 if I'm buying a sweatshirt from the government, sorry, if I'm buying a sweatshirt from somebody

2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.720
 using Bitcoin, the government can't monitor my exchange of Bitcoin to him. Yeah. But they can

2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:51.800
 monitor the sweatshirt being sent to me. Right. That's where they can interfere. And, and I think

2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:57.960
 that at some point to the extent Bitcoin is successful, it will be stopped. That is, and,

2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:03.160
 and that's what will stop it from becoming money. See, money can only become money. It can only

2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:07.640
 become money if people are using it as money. Right. And if the government can stop it being

2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:13.000
 useful, if I can't go to the grocery store and use my ATM that charges on Bitcoin or whatever,

2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:20.200
 then it's not money. And I, I think that the government is going to step in and stop people

2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:27.400
 from doing that. And that's, that's what I saw. I have more respect and fear for the, for the power

2:37:27.400 --> 2:37:33.640
 of, of, of government today. I don't see that at all. However, I could be wrong. And I'm sure

2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:39.080
 you're wrong. Hope he's wrong. Absolutely. Yeah. I hope the government just give in and, and the

2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:43.640
 Fed tomorrow says, yeah, let, let Bitcoin thrive. But I think that want to regulate and control,

2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:48.120
 and the only way to regulate and control it is to, is to stop it. Yeah. There's a bunch of people

2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:53.880
 who argue that Bitcoin is too compelling to argue to government that they'll actually embrace it

2:37:53.880 --> 2:37:58.600
 like she was government has positive goals and wants to do good things. You can ask

2:37:58.600 --> 2:38:04.280
 you. No, no, it's greedy. They say government is greedy because they were Bitcoiners have

2:38:04.280 --> 2:38:09.000
 this whole lingo. They say number go up. Government is not greedy. Government is,

2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:13.720
 government is not greedy for money. Government is greedy for power. Government is greedy for

2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:18.760
 control. Government is much more, and now money's good too. They'll take the money if they can get

2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:23.560
 it. Sure. But it's not fundamentally about money. It's fundamentally, and this is something

2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:27.720
 that many libertarians don't understand. This is something many of the Bitcoin community don't

2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:34.360
 understand. They have far too benevolent a view of, of politicians and the people in government

2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:38.200
 today. And I know why he's laughing. I think I know why he's laughing. You know exactly why

2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:44.840
 I'm laughing. Yeah. And, and we should get to that issue at some point here. But, you know, so,

2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:50.440
 so I think there's a lot of naive, naivete. Yeah, there's a lot of naivete. A lot of it you're on.

2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:57.160
 No, okay. I'm not naive. I'm, I'm, I'm actually providing the warning and all these Bitcoiners

2:38:57.160 --> 2:39:01.000
 are saying, no, no, no, no, government doesn't function that way. No one says I'm naive. Naive

2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:07.560
 people think they're not naive. Well, so let's put this on the table. Speaking of naive, I still,

2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:13.640
 more than the two of you by far, I think, have faith that government can work. Okay, let's put

2:39:13.640 --> 2:39:19.400
 that on the table. I got it. I'm not trying to be pedantic. What do you mean work? Government can

2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:25.960
 achieve goals that is not in dispute. Can achieve goals effectively to build a better world. Okay.

2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:33.240
 A functioning society. So I'm going to take it one step further than you. Oh boy. The only way to

2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:40.440
 achieve a better world is through government. Michael, what do you think about that? He almost

2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:45.240
 dropped it. I said it on purpose that way. I'm glad the mask is dropping. You cannot,

2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:51.800
 you cannot achieve, you cannot have liberty or freedom without a government. Now, not anything

2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:56.760
 like the governments we have today. So I think, I think the idea that you can have liberty of

2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:03.480
 freedom without government is the rejection of the idea of liberty and freedom and, and the

2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:08.280
 undermining of any effort, any attempt to do it. So in that sense, I knew it's sitting right here,

2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:13.400
 right? Lex, I know, exactly. On this, I'm going to agree with Lex. Yeah, that government is good

2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:17.160
 for freedom. You agree with the guy who's reading my comments. That's not a surprise. Who's dressed

2:40:17.160 --> 2:40:24.360
 in black? Yeah. That's the bad guys. No, the, the, the, the, the fascism. I mean, the vote to

2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:30.360
 fascism is anarchy. It's not. What the hell are you talking about? Anarchy? What example would

2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:36.760
 anarchy let the fascism? Well, every example of a stateless society leads to authoritarianism.

2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:41.080
 Every single one in all of human history. It has to, because, because. You're saying why

2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:47.720
 Germany was anarchy? Well, it was, it wasn't pure anarchy, but it got close. But no, I said the

2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:51.880
 reverse, by the way, I said the reverse. I didn't say that every form of authoritarianism

2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:57.800
 started with anarchy. I said that every situation in which human beings lived under anarchy led

2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:04.280
 to authoritarianism. So I said the flip. Anarchism isn't a location. Anarchism is a relationship.

2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:09.320
 The three of us are in an anarchist relationship. Every country is, is in a relationship of

2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:13.320
 anarchy toward each other. The U.S. and Canada have an anarchist relationship toward one another.

2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:23.560
 And to claim, you know, when, going back to Emma Goldman, who I love, in 1901, William McKinley,

2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:29.240
 President McKinley, was shot by this guy, Leon Salgas. And it was very funny that he was a crazy

2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:35.080
 person. And they arrested him. He shot the president and they go, why did you shoot

2:41:35.080 --> 2:41:39.480
 President McKinley? And he just goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman. And she's like,

2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:44.760
 so now she's on the lambs. She had nothing to do with this guy. She's trying to flee.

2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:51.880
 She gets arrested. They caught her. And she said, and this is the hubris of this woman,

2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:56.680
 which I admire as the subject of the good hubris. She goes, I'd like to thank the cops

2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.320
 for doing what they're doing. They're turning far more people into anarchism than I could do

2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:08.600
 on my own. So given everything you've said in these two hours, and then to pivot to

2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:13.880
 being anti government is being anti liberty, I don't feel I have to say anything.

2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:19.320
 Well, okay. For people who are not familiar, if you're, I don't know why you would not be

2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:25.960
 familiar, but Michael Malis talks quite a bit about the evils of the state and government.

2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:32.840
 And espouse his ideas that anarchism is actually, what is it, the most moral system,

2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:37.720
 the most effective system for human relationships. There's this great book called Atlas Shrugged,

2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:43.240
 and the author posits an anarchist private society. She calls it Galt's Gulch,

2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:47.880
 where everything is privately owned and everyone is, no one is in a position of authority

2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:52.040
 over anyone else other than the landowner. That's an anarchist society. It is one judge

2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:59.320
 and one authority. Yeah. And that's what everyone, hold on. And that's what everyone has voluntarily

2:42:59.320 --> 2:43:02.680
 moved there and agreed to be under. It's a very small community, right?

2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:07.640
 That is right. So I have no problem with competing governments. That's the definition of anarchism.

2:43:08.200 --> 2:43:12.040
 What's that? That's the definition of anarchism. Case Clays. Okay. And the show, and the show,

2:43:12.040 --> 2:43:17.480
 I got it. I got it over. Not, not definition. Not definition of anarchy at all. I'm all for

2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:22.920
 competing governments. Good job. He did it. He did it. Yeah, you're on.

2:43:22.920 --> 2:43:25.080
 You brought him over. I brought him over. More Lithuanian.

2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:29.160
 What is this? That's Lithuanian. That's my people.

2:43:33.880 --> 2:43:35.960
 It's honey. No claims of health.

2:43:37.400 --> 2:43:42.120
 The other one claimed health. This one. No claims. No, I'm for competing governments

2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:47.720
 on different geographic areas. That's, that's fine. Why does it have to be over two? Okay, let

2:43:47.720 --> 2:43:54.440
 me. It's really crucial that it's on different. So you don't have two judges in Gold's Gulch. You

2:43:54.440 --> 2:44:00.440
 have one. And there's a reason one. There's one authority. There's one system of laws in Gold's

2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:06.200
 Gulch that is that all the people under the Gulch abide by. There's one. There's two because they're

2:44:06.200 --> 2:44:09.800
 in America. No, they're not. The whole point is they're not, right? They're not in America,

2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:14.040
 they're in Colorado. I know, but, but the whole point of the novel is they've left America. They

2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:17.320
 haven't left America. They've, they've hid themselves. So they're not under the authority of the

2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:19.960
 American government. But they are. Don't forget it. They're not. But they're hidden. They're

2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:24.280
 supposed to be. The point is that they're hidden so they're not under the, no, no, no. If you,

2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:29.640
 if the three of us hide, we're still under the authority of Washington. No, well, not if they

2:44:29.640 --> 2:44:33.640
 don't know. This is why they haven't established the state and it's not, it's not a government

2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:43.160
 and it's not in that sense, you know, an example of, of, of really the way we form societies.

2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:48.120
 It is a private club that is hidden away from everybody else. Fine. I'm fine with that. What

2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:53.880
 happens if an American kills a Canadian in Mexico? What happens in American, it depends.

2:44:53.880 --> 2:44:58.280
 Depends on the nature of the governments of the three places, right? But usually what happens

2:44:58.280 --> 2:45:03.800
 in most of human history is that America will launch a war either against Mexico or Canada.

2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:09.800
 Okay. Just first of all, so usually violence results in much more violence. Anarchy is just

2:45:09.800 --> 2:45:13.800
 a system that legalizes violence. That's all it does. And in international affairs, that's the

2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:19.400
 reality. The reality is that the way you resolve disputes that are major disputes is through violence.

2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:25.720
 Ayn Rand said the definition of a government is an agency that has a monopoly of force in a

2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:32.360
 geographical area. So you can't complain that anarchism is legalizing violence when the definition

2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:37.480
 of government, according to Rand, is legalized violence. No, but, but because you're taking

2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:42.120
 the definition of violence the way she defines it, right? In this context, A, she talks about

2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:47.560
 retaliatory force only. And has that ever happened? That's not the point. That is the point. Before

2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:51.400
 there was Aristotle was an Aristotle. Before there was an America was in America. The fact

2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:56.440
 that something has never existed means it will never exist before. The fact that the ideas haven't

2:45:56.440 --> 2:46:00.680
 been developed to make something exist means that it will never exist before. You know,

2:46:00.680 --> 2:46:05.960
 where human race is a young race, the ideas of freedom are very young. The ideas of the

2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:10.760
 Enlightenment are just 250 years old. The idea that you can't create the kind of government

2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:15.400
 Ayn Rand talked about, I talked about, that it's never been before means it will never

2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:19.160
 happen again. That's a silly argument. It's not a silly argument. It's you're being a Platonist.

2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:22.200
 No, not at all. I'll explain to you how you're being exactly a Platonist.

2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:26.760
 So if I was sitting in 1750 arguing with Thomas Jefferson, he was telling me what kind of state

2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:30.920
 he was going to create. And I said, is a state like this ever been created? And he said, no,

2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:35.240
 was I being a Platonist? Of course not. No, you know, things change. You're being a Platonist now.

2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:40.520
 Here's why you're being a Platonist now. Because one of the things that Aristotle believed in,

2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:44.760
 one of the things that Ayn Rand and other contexts believed in, the cover of her book,

2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:50.360
 the philosophy who needs it is that I think it's the Sistine Chapel, the cover or wherever it is.

2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:55.640
 It's Aristotle and Plato walking. No, not. Yeah. But what's that painting? I forget what it is.

2:46:55.640 --> 2:47:01.560
 It's a school of Athens. School of Athens. Thank you. So Plato is pointing toward the heavens while

2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:07.000
 they're talking. And Aristotle is pointing to the earth. Reality. Reality. Absolutely. So if you

2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:13.720
 want, there's two approaches. There's the Descartes Cartesian approach, which is I sit in my arm chair

2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:19.320
 and I deduce all of reality. Or if I want to study the nature of man, if I want to study

2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:23.720
 the nature of dogs, if I want to study the nature of the sun, I have to look around. I have to open

2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:29.560
 my eyes. I have to look at data. It's very difficult. You know, when Rand was on Donahue,

2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:34.120
 he asked her about, aren't you impressed with the order in the universe? And she goes, oh,

2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:38.440
 now you have to give me a moment. And the point she made, which was very hard for many people

2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:44.920
 to grasp, as hard for me to grasp, is one's concept of order comes from the universe.

2:47:44.920 --> 2:47:50.920
 You can't have a disorderly universe because order means describing that which exists and

2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:57.240
 which has existed. Now, if you are looking at governments throughout history that have always

2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:03.160
 existed, and when you were on Lex, you said, what I'm talking about has never existed.

2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:10.040
 That's right. To say that this, therefore, that that has a possibility of working in reality,

2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:16.120
 I think, is certainly not a point in that favor, number one. And number two, Jefferson was a fraud.

2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:22.280
 What Jefferson argued, how America would look, did not come true. Jefferson's concerns about

2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:28.040
 the Constitution were accurate. And the fact is the federal government did become centralized,

2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:33.480
 did become a civil war. So if you told Mr. Jefferson, the government you're positing

2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:38.600
 can't work, you would have been correct. That's not what I'm saying. It's not the issue of can it

2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:45.400
 work or not. It's the issue of can something exist that hasn't existed in the past. It's a

2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:50.040
 silly argument. Now, we can argue about the facts of reality, whether such a thing can exist. But

2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:54.680
 to say it hasn't existed in the past is not an argument about whether it consists in the future.

2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:58.040
 But that's the argument you made. No, no, you're talking about history and now you're dancing around

2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:03.320
 it. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. I'm saying that something different happened in the founding

2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:06.840
 of America. It might not have been perfect. It might not have been ideal. It might have been

2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:10.360
 some people even think it was bad, right? It was something different happened. Sure.

2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:13.960
 And you could have said 20 years before and said, well, that's never happened before,

2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:18.680
 so it can't happen in the future. That is a bad argument. It's not a good argument.

2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:23.400
 Irrelevant. No, but you're making the argument that just because something hasn't happened before,

2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:27.240
 or does that's certainly not a point to say it's likely to happen or possible?

2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:34.040
 No, I'm saying, first of all, I agree that everything we know about what's possible or

2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:39.080
 what's not possible has to be from reality. That we agree completely. I think Anarchy has

2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:46.280
 completely evaded that point. I think you guys live in a world of mythology, of abstraction,

2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:52.520
 of decod, to imagine the kind of Anarchy that David Friedman or Rothbard described. It's

2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:59.080
 complete fiction, and it's complete mysticism. Okay. Let me ask you just a few dumb questions.

2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:06.440
 So first of all, what do we do with violence in terms of just natural emergence of violence in

2:50:06.440 --> 2:50:15.160
 human societies? Sure. So the idea that Anarchism proposes is that we would, as the community grows,

2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:20.920
 there may be violence, and then we together form collectives that sort of fund mechanisms that

2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:27.320
 resist that violence. I'd love to sort of talk about violence because that seems to be the

2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:33.320
 core thing. That's the difference between the state that was definitionally, I guess,

2:50:33.320 --> 2:50:39.160
 is the thing that has a monopoly on violence, or controls violence in such a way that you

2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:44.360
 don't have to worry about it. And then the anarchism, I don't know. I'm using bad words.

2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:49.560
 No, your definition is accurate, but the point is that being the definition of the state versus

2:50:49.560 --> 2:50:56.200
 how states act in reality is just absurd. Yeah. And then the idea that anarchism would be is that

2:50:56.200 --> 2:51:03.720
 it's more kind of a market of defenses against violence. So you have security companies, and

2:51:03.720 --> 2:51:08.920
 then you hire different ones that have more companies. You have things being made affordable.

2:51:08.920 --> 2:51:14.840
 You have more accessibility to security. You have accountability when people misuse their power,

2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:20.920
 and you have more layers of security than having a government monopoly. What's that?

2:51:21.800 --> 2:51:26.440
 Objectivists understand, and they don't deny this. This is something they talk about constantly,

2:51:26.440 --> 2:51:32.680
 is anytime you have a government monopoly, it's going to have enormous distortions as a consequence.

2:51:32.680 --> 2:51:36.200
 It's going to be expensive. It's going to be ineffective. And when you're talking about

2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:42.040
 ineffectiveness in markets, that's not just like the cup sucks. It often means mass death.

2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:49.000
 It often means persecution. So this is something that anarchism, if not entirely

2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:52.680
 prevents, certainly mitigates enormously. So can I just, as a thought experiment,

2:51:52.680 --> 2:51:56.920
 say it was very easy to immigrate to another country, like where you could just move about

2:51:56.920 --> 2:52:01.800
 from government to government, would that alleviate most of the problems that you have

2:52:01.800 --> 2:52:07.320
 towards the state, which is like people being free to choose which government they operate under,

2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:14.520
 wouldn't that essentially be the problem? I'm trying to understand why governments aren't

2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:21.400
 already the thing that's the goal of anarchism, the kind of collectives that emerge under anarchism.

2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:26.920
 You're equating two terms. So there's something called private governance,

2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:32.840
 and there's government. So for example, if I go to Yaron's house, and he has a rule,

2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:38.200
 take off your shoes, become your house, if you want to really be kind of silly about it,

2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:43.080
 you could say he's the governor. But it's really nonsensical to say that.

2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:49.160
 If you go to Macy's, if you want to return your sweater, Macy's rules are right up there.

2:52:49.160 --> 2:52:52.840
 You have seven days. If you don't have receipt, you're going to get store credit. If you do have

2:52:52.840 --> 2:52:59.480
 receipt, you get a refund. So every organization, every bar, nightclub, your house has rules of

2:52:59.480 --> 2:53:07.240
 governments. It's often they're unspoken. This is unavoidable. No one in America by law has to pay a

2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:12.440
 tip, but it's just customary. You go at the waiter, you give them 15%, 20%, so on and so forth.

2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:20.520
 Now, what anarchism does is it says, okay, security is something that is of crucial,

2:53:20.520 --> 2:53:27.320
 essential human need. We all need to be safe in our property, safe in our purpose. The organization

2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:33.240
 that by far is the biggest violator of this and always has been, always will be, is the government.

2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:39.400
 Why? Because it's a monopoly, because it has no accountability. And look at the rioting last year,

2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:44.280
 right? If you have one agency, pretend it's not the government, pretend it's Apple.

2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:49.560
 And Apple has the in charge of security in this town. People are lied, rioting, people are looting.

2:53:49.560 --> 2:53:54.440
 And Apple says, yeah, we're not going to send people into work. And if you try to defend yourself,

2:53:54.440 --> 2:53:58.680
 we're going to put you in jail as well. That's the problem of having a government monopoly,

2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:00.760
 and that's something that anarchism solves for.

2:54:00.760 --> 2:54:06.280
 So, okay. But don't you, because you said no accountability, don't you mean to say

2:54:06.280 --> 2:54:07.240
 poor accountability?

2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:08.680
 No, I mean to say no accountability.

2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:11.640
 But isn't that the idea of democracies?

2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:12.840
 I'm not for democracy.

2:54:12.840 --> 2:54:16.680
 No, not for democracy, but like the system of governments that we have,

2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:23.480
 there is a monopoly on violence, but there is a, I mean, at least in the ideal, but I think in

2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:28.040
 practice as well, there's an accountability. Like, I know you're a critic of the police force and all

2:54:28.040 --> 2:54:31.560
 those kinds of things, but the military is accountable to the people.

2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:31.880
 I do not agree.

2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:37.720
 The police force is accountable to the people, perhaps imperfectly, but you're saying not at all.

2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:43.720
 Not at all. And we've seen many examples of police officers doing horrific things on video,

2:54:43.720 --> 2:54:44.760
 and they don't even lose their pension.

2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:46.920
 But there's a lot of amazing police officers, no.

2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:49.080
 I mean, no, they're not.

2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:53.640
 So you're saying by nature, police is like a fundamentally flawed system?

2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:58.200
 No, by nature, government monopoly in police is a fundamentally irredeemable system.

2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:03.640
 Let's talk about private security. If I have a private security firm, you could have that

2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:09.400
 with under a government. And as a result of my private security, my person who I'm bodyguarding

2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:15.000
 gets shot, that's going to be very bad for my company as compared to competing companies.

2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.960
 However, when you have a government monopoly and I get people shot, what are you going to do?

2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:25.480
 So the problem is that all the examples are going to be within the context of an existing

2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:28.600
 government. This is why I said the cell phone example, and all these are the examples of us

2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:32.920
 being here. We're not in anarchy. That is absurd. We're under a particular system of law,

2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:37.640
 and the system of laws applies. And we know that the particular system of laws applies.

2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:39.080
 So the problem is when you have...

2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:43.800
 There are many laws that we're not going to be enforced, that we're not really subject to.

2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:45.480
 We know that. Violence related?

2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:47.560
 No, there are lots of laws that are not going to be enforced.

2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:55.320
 That doesn't make this anarchy because there are the laws out there. They could be enforced,

2:55:55.320 --> 2:55:59.000
 which makes an enormous difference. But look, there's a number of issues here.

2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:03.240
 There's an issue of the role of force in human society.

2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:05.480
 I got to clarify, I think, because I think you misunderstood what I said.

2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:10.280
 I'm not saying that America is anarchist. What I'm saying is the three of us have an

2:56:10.280 --> 2:56:13.640
 anarchist relationship between us because none of us have authority over the others. That's what

2:56:13.640 --> 2:56:16.600
 I'm saying. But that's a bad use of the word anarchy.

2:56:16.600 --> 2:56:18.280
 No, that's the correct use of the word anarchy.

2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:21.720
 It makes it meaningless. It makes it... Every time any people get together,

2:56:21.720 --> 2:56:25.560
 they have an anarchistic relationship. No, we have a voluntary relationship.

2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:27.320
 That's what anarchism means, militarism.

2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:29.240
 No, it doesn't. It's a political system.

2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:30.600
 You want to get a dictionary out?

2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:35.560
 You're taking a word, and it's accepted usage, and then you're saying, oh, no, it means...

2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:36.200
 You mean like selfishness?

2:56:36.840 --> 2:56:39.880
 Maybe, and we never finished that discussion. You're taking a word,

2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:45.000
 we're taking a word that you're defining as replacing it with voluntary.

2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.320
 Okay, fine. I'm not for anarchism or voluntarism.

2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:51.080
 But let me... Let's understand what voluntary means, right?

2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:55.560
 So we, for example, going to stores and there's a certain relationship that we have with the store

2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:58.760
 that we engage in certain voluntary transactions with their store.

2:56:58.760 --> 2:57:03.960
 Now, I believe that that works because there is a certain system of law

2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:08.040
 that both the store and we have accepted that makes that possible.

2:57:08.040 --> 2:57:13.720
 Now, if that didn't, there are certain people who would like to walk into their store and just take the stuff, right?

2:57:13.720 --> 2:57:18.440
 So there is a... We might not, but there are certain people who might want it to go into their store.

2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:25.480
 There's a certain system of laws that regulates the relationship and that defines the property rights

2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:28.040
 and then provides protection for the property rights.

2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:33.320
 Now, you would like all that privatized. That is, the store would have its police force and that would be privatized.

2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:35.720
 Now, I don't believe that force can be privatized.

2:57:35.720 --> 2:57:37.720
 And there are many reasons...

2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:39.720
 Answer shouldn't.

2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:43.720
 I don't think it can. And I don't think... I think it's a...

2:57:43.720 --> 2:57:45.720
 That's an interesting distinction.

2:57:45.720 --> 2:57:49.720
 I don't think it can because I think that it's an unstable equilibrium, right?

2:57:49.720 --> 2:57:53.720
 I don't think competing police forces can work.

2:57:53.720 --> 2:57:59.720
 At the end, the police force with the biggest gun always wins and always takes over and becomes authoritarian.

2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:03.720
 That's not true. Look at Iran and Iraq, excuse me. We had the bigger guns. We didn't win.

2:58:03.720 --> 2:58:05.720
 Look at Afghanistan.

2:58:05.720 --> 2:58:11.720
 We didn't win partially because none of that is an example of anarchy.

2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:13.720
 No, but you just said the guy with the biggest gun is going to win.

2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:15.720
 Yeah, the guy with the biggest gun is going to win.

2:58:15.720 --> 2:58:17.720
 We didn't win in Vietnam. We had the bigger guns.

2:58:17.720 --> 2:58:19.720
 But again, you're taking it outside of a context.

2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:25.720
 That was a context in which countries are fighting, not a context in which there is no country.

2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:31.720
 You, Yaron, have a rocket launcher and there's 100 people with handguns. How are you going to win?

2:58:31.720 --> 2:58:33.720
 You have the biggest gun.

2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:35.720
 Oh, believe me, I could win.

2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:37.720
 With one rocket launcher against 100 people?

2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:41.720
 Yeah. Well, it depends how many rockets I have in the rocket launcher and whether I'm willing to use them.

2:58:41.720 --> 2:58:45.720
 But that's, so now it's democracy because they're more of them that they win.

2:58:45.720 --> 2:58:51.720
 Look, any one of these scenarios, all it does, so let's go back to the store.

2:58:51.720 --> 2:58:57.720
 This is fascinating, by the way. I'm really enjoying this. I just want to say that this is great.

2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:03.720
 I'm glad you are. I am enjoying the pain.

2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:05.720
 And I'm also enjoying the comments that are going to happen.

2:59:05.720 --> 2:59:09.720
 Oh, the comments. The comments are going to be overwhelmingly on your side.

2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:11.720
 I don't think so. I don't think so.

2:59:11.720 --> 2:59:13.720
 I think the Anarchy position is completely dishonest.

2:59:13.720 --> 2:59:15.720
 I'm a modern day. What's his name?

2:59:15.720 --> 2:59:17.720
 What's the guy who was defending communism?

2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:19.720
 Oh, Richard Wolff.

2:59:19.720 --> 2:59:21.720
 I'm a modern day Richard Wolff.

2:59:21.720 --> 2:59:25.720
 There's a sense in which I think anarchists are evading reality in the same sense.

2:59:25.720 --> 2:59:29.720
 Do you think I'm dishonest or delusional?

2:59:29.720 --> 2:59:33.720
 Calling someone dishonest is a really specific thing.

2:59:33.720 --> 2:59:35.720
 I think you're delusional.

2:59:35.720 --> 2:59:39.720
 I think you're delusional and I'm going to give you the benefit of it without being delusional.

2:59:39.720 --> 2:59:41.720
 That's fair.

2:59:41.720 --> 2:59:43.720
 We all love each other.

2:59:43.720 --> 2:59:51.720
 And as I said on the previous interview, I said only smart people can be anarchists

2:59:51.720 --> 2:59:57.720
 because it requires a certain level of abstraction of being divorced from reality

2:59:57.720 --> 2:59:59.720
 that is hard for people who are actually connected to reality.

2:59:59.720 --> 3:00:03.720
 But he makes a good point because I always talk about this with people on social media

3:00:03.720 --> 3:00:07.720
 and they talk about a lot of people who buy into the corporate media narrative

3:00:07.720 --> 3:00:11.720
 and how they're dumb. I go, it's easier to train smart people than dumb people.

3:00:11.720 --> 3:00:15.720
 It's easier to convince smart people of the systemic that's divorced from reality than somebody's dumb.

3:00:15.720 --> 3:00:19.720
 They can deal in an abstraction. They don't have to deal with the concretes that actually happen.

3:00:19.720 --> 3:00:23.720
 This is an example I gave debating another anarchist.

3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:27.720
 Who was it? James the sucked.

3:00:27.720 --> 3:00:29.720
 They were Hoppe fans.

3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:31.720
 Okay, Hoppe fans.

3:00:31.720 --> 3:00:37.720
 Not one of my least, people I liked the least in the world out there.

3:00:37.720 --> 3:00:39.720
 You like them better than the communists, don't you?

3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:41.720
 Barely.

3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:43.720
 Oh, come on. Seriously?

3:00:43.720 --> 3:00:45.720
 Yes, because I think it leaves the same place. I really do. I think it leaves the gulags.

3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:47.720
 Fine.

3:00:47.720 --> 3:00:49.720
 And I think Hoppe's view of anarchy definitely leads to gulags.

3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:52.720
 I'll grant you just for the sake of argument that it leads to gulags.

3:00:52.720 --> 3:00:58.720
 However, surely you concede that they are against gulags, whereas the communists have no problem with it.

3:00:58.720 --> 3:00:59.720
 And that's a big...

3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:06.720
 I think some do. I'm not sure people like Hoppe do, because if you read some of his stuff, one wonders.

3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:09.720
 You know, but once Monarchy's and you once...

3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:12.720
 No, he said Monarchy is a preferable to democracy, which is true.

3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:14.720
 No, it's not.

3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:17.720
 I mean, one of the problems with anarchists is...

3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:18.720
 What judge? That's the monarch.

3:01:18.720 --> 3:01:20.720
 One of the problems, yeah.

3:01:20.720 --> 3:01:22.720
 One judge, one authority.

3:01:22.720 --> 3:01:23.720
 Yeah, the monarch.

3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:25.720
 That's why I think...

3:01:25.720 --> 3:01:26.720
 So you're a Hoppean.

3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:27.720
 You're so authoritarian.

3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:28.720
 Yaron Brooks is a Hoppean.

3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:30.720
 No, I'm not a Hoppean. I don't want one judge.

3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:32.720
 I don't want an arbitrary judge.

3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:34.720
 I want an objective judge.

3:01:34.720 --> 3:01:37.720
 There's an essay by John Hasnass, I think his name, I'm going to bungle it.

3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:39.720
 It's going to be in my upcoming book on anarchism.

3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:43.720
 And he just discusses, and it's a very long, complicated technical issue,

3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:46.720
 that the idea of objective law is incoherent.

3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:49.720
 Well, yeah, I mean, that's why we disagree so much.

3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:50.720
 Yeah.

3:01:50.720 --> 3:01:52.720
 Because I think objective law is the only coherence.

3:01:52.720 --> 3:02:01.720
 Do you disagree that we, in effect, have competing systems of law under America?

3:02:01.720 --> 3:02:03.720
 Meaning there's different ideologies.

3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:07.720
 You have the Sotomayor ideology versus the Scalia ideology, and that effectively.

3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:12.720
 And the point being, when you and I file a lawsuit, it completely depends on who the judge is.

3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:13.720
 Yes.

3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:16.720
 And in theory, in theory, I don't think the system works this way,

3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:22.720
 but in theory, the way the system would work is that on new issues, there are, there is some competition.

3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:23.720
 Nice to meet you.

3:02:23.720 --> 3:02:25.720
 Syria wasn't talking to you.

3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:26.720
 Technology.

3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:27.720
 Capitalism.

3:02:27.720 --> 3:02:32.720
 So in theory, the system works, and this works, I think, with competing states,

3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:37.720
 but also with competing legal views, particularly on a new issue.

3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:41.720
 There's some, this is how common law worked, right?

3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:45.720
 There's some evolution of it, and at some point, that gets codified into the law,

3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:47.720
 and it gets objectified in that sense.

3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:53.720
 That is, there's some conclusion that people come to, this is the role in theory of a legislation.

3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:59.720
 The legislation would be nice if it was composed of people who had some idea of legal philosophy.

3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:00.720
 Sure.

3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:02.720
 And it gets codified.

3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:07.720
 And when, because these things are complex, and at some point, it goes through all the arguments,

3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:13.720
 and then a certain truth emerges, or certain proof is identified, and that's what gets encoded in law.

3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:15.720
 That's what the purpose of a legislature is.

3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:22.720
 Now, if you have competing mechanisms that don't converge on one authority, because there's no one authority,

3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:29.720
 there are multiple authorities, that is, in a sense, a multiple governments or multiple systems of enforcement, right?

3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:37.720
 Then you get not just something emerging out of it, what you get is competing legal systems.

3:03:37.720 --> 3:03:44.720
 Competing legal systems that now have competing mechanisms of enforcement, competing police forces,

3:03:44.720 --> 3:03:47.720
 completing militaries, however we want to define it.

3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:50.720
 And now there's no mechanism to resolve that.

3:03:50.720 --> 3:03:55.720
 Now, yes, we could negotiate, and there's goodwill, and so on, right?

3:03:55.720 --> 3:03:56.720
 Yeah, there you go.

3:03:56.720 --> 3:04:05.720
 But now we're talking about the law, what each view, each position views as true and right, right?

3:04:05.720 --> 3:04:11.720
 And it might involve, for example, it might involve the fact that the legal system has come to the conclusion

3:04:11.720 --> 3:04:18.720
 that it's okay for children to have sex with adults, and this legal system thinks that is evil and wrong, right?

3:04:18.720 --> 3:04:23.720
 And this something has happened between the two, right?

3:04:23.720 --> 3:04:24.720
 How do you resolve that conflict?

3:04:24.720 --> 3:04:26.720
 There is no resolution.

3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:28.720
 This adult wants to have sex with this child.

3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:30.720
 This legal system thinks it's okay.

3:04:30.720 --> 3:04:35.720
 The only way to resolve that system is through one system imposing itself on the other.

3:04:35.720 --> 3:04:37.720
 An example of countries is exactly that.

3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:40.720
 When you had monarchies, when you had little states all over the place,

3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:45.720
 the way any kind of dispute was resolved when there were issues of territorial disputes

3:04:45.720 --> 3:04:50.720
 or issues of marriage or issues of different legal interpretations was war.

3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:51.720
 No, it wasn't.

3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:52.720
 It was marriage.

3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:55.720
 A lot of times people would marry a princess from another country.

3:04:55.720 --> 3:04:58.720
 Sure, forced marriages, which was not very pleasant.

3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:00.720
 I'd rather sacrifice one princess than an army.

3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:02.720
 No, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.

3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:04.720
 And in addition, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.

3:05:04.720 --> 3:05:05.720
 I want to sacrifice the royals.

3:05:05.720 --> 3:05:06.720
 And in addition, well, I don't want royals.

3:05:06.720 --> 3:05:08.720
 Well, that's what sacrificing means.

3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:09.720
 I agree.

3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:15.720
 And then on top of that, look, those periods in history are filled with violence,

3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:19.720
 much more violence than we have today, much more bloody than they are today,

3:05:19.720 --> 3:05:22.720
 far less freedom than we have today in terms of individual freedom.

3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:25.720
 You're comparing this to 20th century.

3:05:25.720 --> 3:05:29.720
 Yes, I'm comparing a monarchy, right?

3:05:29.720 --> 3:05:32.720
 You said that's preferable to democracy, right?

3:05:32.720 --> 3:05:33.720
 I'm comparing.

3:05:33.720 --> 3:05:34.720
 Hoppe said that.

3:05:34.720 --> 3:05:35.720
 I'm not saying I'm saying that.

3:05:35.720 --> 3:05:36.720
 Oh, I thought you.

3:05:36.720 --> 3:05:37.720
 To some extent.

3:05:37.720 --> 3:05:38.720
 To some extent.

3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:39.720
 But I'm not going to die in that hell.

3:05:39.720 --> 3:05:40.720
 Hoppe said that.

3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:41.720
 And I think it's ridiculous.

3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:43.720
 These kings and queens were fighting constantly.

3:05:43.720 --> 3:05:47.720
 I mean, the wars back then were violent in a way that...

3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:48.720
 Unlike now?

3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:49.720
 That's more violent than now.

3:05:49.720 --> 3:05:51.720
 If you look at the actual percentage of people killed in war.

3:05:51.720 --> 3:05:52.720
 Yeah, the Stephen Pinker book.

3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:53.720
 Yeah.

3:05:53.720 --> 3:05:56.720
 If you look at percentage of people, and not just that, you can look at other stats.

3:05:56.720 --> 3:05:59.720
 The percentage of people killed in war back then were far greater than percentage of people,

3:05:59.720 --> 3:06:01.720
 even during World War II and World War I.

3:06:01.720 --> 3:06:08.720
 So anarchy, and you know, David Feynman loves to quote the sagas of Iceland about how wonderful the anarchy.

3:06:08.720 --> 3:06:11.720
 I mean, it's funny because a lot of people read...

3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:12.720
 David Feynman never read the sagas.

3:06:12.720 --> 3:06:14.720
 It's worth reading.

3:06:14.720 --> 3:06:18.720
 The sagas of the Iceland are filled with violence.

3:06:18.720 --> 3:06:19.720
 Constant violence.

3:06:19.720 --> 3:06:26.720
 Constantly people killing each other over, you know, I stole your chickens and you slept with my wife.

3:06:26.720 --> 3:06:31.720
 The only way to resolve disputes, the only way to resolve disputes was violence.

3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:32.720
 There was no authority.

3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:34.720
 There was no mechanism to resolve these disputes.

3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:37.720
 There was a council, but the council couldn't enforce anything.

3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:39.720
 So in the end of the day, we just resolved the violence.

3:06:39.720 --> 3:06:46.720
 And this is legalized because there is no mechanism by which to make the violence illegal.

3:06:46.720 --> 3:06:58.720
 So all anarchy is, is legalized violence constrained for a while and up until people stop that constraint

3:06:58.720 --> 3:07:03.720
 by, you know, arrangements between the security organizations.

3:07:03.720 --> 3:07:08.720
 But the security organizations have us by the balls to put it figuratively, right?

3:07:08.720 --> 3:07:09.720
 They really do.

3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:10.720
 Sure.

3:07:10.720 --> 3:07:11.720
 Unlike the state?

3:07:11.720 --> 3:07:12.720
 Oh, the state today has it.

3:07:12.720 --> 3:07:16.720
 But I would rather live in this state, much rather live in this state, much rather live

3:07:16.720 --> 3:07:22.720
 in many more authoritarian states than this, than a place where there's constant violence.

3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:24.720
 I have a bunch of questions, but I'm enjoying this.

3:07:24.720 --> 3:07:25.720
 That's why everything he said is wrong.

3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:26.720
 Okay, yes.

3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:33.720
 First of all, the idea of competing legal systems is inevitable because what Rand talked about

3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:39.720
 is what she wanted was, and this is really kind of Eric out of character with her broader

3:07:39.720 --> 3:07:43.720
 ideology is, I think this was her term and I'm not saying this to make fun of you.

3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:48.720
 When she has a judge and he's looking at the information, she wants him to be basically,

3:07:48.720 --> 3:07:53.720
 I think she's the word robot, someone without any ideology, that they're just looking at

3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:54.720
 the facts.

3:07:54.720 --> 3:07:56.720
 They're not bringing their kind of worldview to it.

3:07:56.720 --> 3:07:57.720
 I take it as a compliment.

3:07:57.720 --> 3:07:59.720
 You are welcome.

3:07:59.720 --> 3:08:12.720
 I think that given otherwise, her correct view that ideology is just a slur for someone's

3:08:12.720 --> 3:08:17.720
 philosophy, that someone, especially someone is erudite educated and informed as a judge

3:08:17.720 --> 3:08:23.720
 has to and in fact should bring their ideology to their work is in one sense a little contradiction

3:08:23.720 --> 3:08:24.720
 in her view.

3:08:24.720 --> 3:08:25.720
 Number one.

3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:29.720
 Number two is we have right now the DA in San Francisco.

3:08:29.720 --> 3:08:30.720
 I forget his name.

3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:37.720
 He's the son of literal terrorists, communist terrorists and he has made it the decree unilaterally

3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:41.720
 that if you shoplift for less than, I forget, $200, we're not prosecuting.

3:08:41.720 --> 3:08:42.720
 I know that.

3:08:42.720 --> 3:08:43.720
 You know this game.

3:08:43.720 --> 3:08:44.720
 Right, right, right.

3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:51.280
 So now you and I, certain and Lex I'm sure probably agree that his ideology is abhorrent,

3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:54.560
 that this doesn't help poor people, it doesn't help shop owners.

3:08:54.560 --> 3:09:00.800
 It creates a culture, an area where it's just deleterious to human life.

3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:07.240
 However, he has in one sense, given that he is a state operative, a legitimate worldview.

3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:08.960
 Can I ask you just a quick question?

3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:15.680
 Why couldn't a security force in a particular context say, yeah, if you take stuff on that

3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:19.000
 store, we're not going to have any problem with that.

3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:20.000
 I agree with you.

3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:21.000
 That's very fair.

3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:22.000
 That's a very legitimate question.

3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:27.720
 That is, in the context that I'm talking about, that firm is like, wait a minute, I'm hiring

3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:29.120
 you for security.

3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:31.200
 You're saying we're not going to provide security.

3:09:31.200 --> 3:09:32.440
 Why am I writing you a check?

3:09:32.440 --> 3:09:34.840
 And we have examples of this in real life.

3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:39.760
 If I get into a car accident with you, right, you have your car insurance.

3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:41.700
 I have my car insurance.

3:09:41.700 --> 3:09:45.360
 If your car insurance had their druthers, they wouldn't pay me one penny.

3:09:45.360 --> 3:09:49.000
 If my car insurance didn't have their druthers, they wouldn't pay you one penny.

3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:53.320
 We already have, you were saying earlier that we need to have one kind of umbrella that

3:09:53.320 --> 3:09:54.440
 can refuse.

3:09:54.440 --> 3:09:58.720
 There are already more cases than you can count where there's private arbitration.

3:09:58.720 --> 3:10:04.000
 Now, the argument is that private arbitration only works because they have recourse to the

3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:05.000
 government.

3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:09.440
 But my point is there's many examples where even though that recourse is theoretically

3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:16.440
 possible, it's not a realistic concern, specifically because they know that if you have recourse

3:10:16.440 --> 3:10:22.160
 to the state, you have no concept of what that outcome is going to look like, except

3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:24.960
 knowing it's going to be exorbitant.

3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:26.960
 It's going to be time consuming.

3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:27.960
 Talk about the...

3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:29.960
 Look, we can't use the state, right.

3:10:29.960 --> 3:10:33.600
 I mean, I'm as critical as the state as it is right now.

3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:34.840
 Maybe not as critical as you are.

3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:35.840
 Not as critical as you are.

3:10:35.840 --> 3:10:38.960
 But I'm quite critical of the state as it is right now.

3:10:38.960 --> 3:10:45.320
 But let's say we got into a traffic accident and you have a Rolls Royce and I destroyed

3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:46.320
 your Rolls Royce.

3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:49.640
 And my insurance company now owes your insurance company a lot of money.

3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:51.760
 And let's imagine it's a lot of money just for the sake of it.

3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:52.760
 And you're clearly guilty.

3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:54.000
 Yeah, clearly guilty.

3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:58.200
 And my insurance company looks at the books and it goes, you know, I don't really...

3:10:58.200 --> 3:10:59.840
 I don't want to pay this.

3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:00.840
 And you know what?

3:11:00.840 --> 3:11:03.080
 I've got bigger guns than his insurance company.

3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:05.560
 And I'm just going to take over their insurance company.

3:11:05.560 --> 3:11:14.000
 And hostile takeover takes on a whole new meaning when I can muster guns on my behalf than in

3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:17.880
 a hostile takeover in a capitalist context.

3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:19.160
 That to me is what happens.

3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:22.120
 That to me is inevitably what happens.

3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:24.160
 And I think this is where the delusion comes in.

3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:29.480
 The idea that everything that when big money is involved and big and power is involved,

3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:35.240
 remember, again, the same kind of politicians who today get into politics are likely to want

3:11:35.240 --> 3:11:39.080
 to run some of these security agencies because they have a lot of power over people.

3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:40.080
 So same kind of...

3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:41.080
 I don't think...

3:11:41.080 --> 3:11:44.080
 Maybe sociopaths will be there.

3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:45.080
 I don't think it's the same skill set, but that's separate issue.

3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:47.040
 I think it very much is.

3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:50.960
 But you think the people in Washington the same as CEOs psychologically and skill set

3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:51.960
 wise?

3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:52.960
 Well, today's CEOs, yes.

3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:53.960
 Okay.

3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:54.960
 Yes.

3:11:54.960 --> 3:11:55.960
 You might be right.

3:11:55.960 --> 3:12:00.440
 Because I think that's what's rewarded for CEOs, somebody who could get along with government.

3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:05.160
 And I think the kind of CEO who is going to run a security company, which is not just

3:12:05.160 --> 3:12:09.680
 about business, it's about the use of force, it's about control, it's about negotiation

3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:15.480
 with other entities that are using force, negotiate diplomacy, and we should get back

3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:19.120
 to objective law because I think it's essential to this whole argument.

3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:23.800
 I think all you get into is security agencies, fighting security agencies, and again, the

3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:24.960
 biggest gun.

3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:28.960
 And I don't mean here, the guy who has the biggest literal gun, the rocket launcher versus

3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:29.960
 the guns.

3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:30.960
 I got excited.

3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:31.960
 This...

3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:32.960
 By the biggest gun?

3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:33.960
 Yeah.

3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:37.560
 The party that has the more physical force, however, that is mustered either by numbers

3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:41.440
 or by weapons is going to dominate and will take over everybody else.

3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:45.920
 Now, one of the things that's common in a market is takeovers.

3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:47.360
 It's consolidation.

3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:53.960
 And here, the consolidation can happen through force and you can roll other security companies

3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:57.800
 and that's exactly what will happen until you dominate the particular geographic area.

3:12:57.800 --> 3:12:58.800
 Okay.

3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:00.080
 So let me explain why I disagree with that.

3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:04.960
 You were just saying, and I agree correctly, I agree with you, that listen, if I have access

3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:08.480
 to the bigger gun, why am I paying you or whoever's paying whatever, I'm just going

3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:10.520
 to use force and not pay them.

3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:11.520
 We have that right now.

3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:12.680
 It's called lobbying.

3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:18.440
 So instead of me, and I'm sure in your example, you weren't being literal, instead of the

3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:22.960
 insurance company literally having the army, they could be like, hey, let me call Corruptco

3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:23.960
 with a mafia.

3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:24.960
 I agree.

3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:25.960
 Yeah.

3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:26.960
 Go out and take them out.

3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:31.320
 By having this federal government, as you know, and certainly I'm not a fan of, takes

3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:36.680
 more through asset forfeiture than burglary is combined.

3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:38.760
 What asset forfeiture is people don't even understand this.

3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:43.600
 This is something crazy, which you, which are on is as opposed to me as opposed as I am,

3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:45.440
 which is I'm a cop.

3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:46.960
 I go to your house.

3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:50.240
 I think you haven't been charged or convicted of anything.

3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:52.400
 I have evidence usually in a car.

3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:53.400
 Yeah.

3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:54.400
 Yeah.

3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:55.400
 It's like drug deals.

3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:56.400
 Okay.

3:13:56.400 --> 3:13:57.400
 I go to your house.

3:13:57.400 --> 3:13:58.400
 You're a drug dealer.

3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:03.320
 And you can understand the reasoning, well, if someone is getting profit through illegal

3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:07.520
 mechanisms, their profit isn't real, their property, and they shouldn't be rewarded that

3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:08.520
 profit.

3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:09.520
 So basically, I go to your house.

3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:10.520
 You're a drug dealer.

3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:12.760
 I seize all your property.

3:14:12.760 --> 3:14:15.920
 You don't really have recourse, even though you haven't been through deep, I'm just explaining

3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:18.240
 to the audience, be through the new process.

3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:25.240
 And SOL, that combined for people who don't know is more than the total amount of burglaries

3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:26.360
 in America.

3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:31.000
 And what happens is the police department, which ceases your car auctions, it sees your

3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:34.320
 house auctions, it's a great way to line their pockets.

3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:35.640
 This is a huge incentive.

3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:36.640
 It's horrible.

3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:42.960
 It's a huge incentive for police departments to do this because it's like, look, this guy's

3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:43.960
 a crook.

3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:46.720
 Maybe he's not a drug dealer, but he's clearly a pimp.

3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:49.200
 Let me just take all his stuff and it's going to go to the community.

3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:54.520
 Well, and the rationale originally was, if I try him, in the meantime, he'll take that

3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:59.480
 money and funnel it somewhere else and hide it, and I'll never be able to get access to

3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:00.480
 it.

3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:06.560
 And it was passed in the 1970s under the original CZ Laws, what kind of RICO Act, going after

3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:07.720
 the mafia.

3:15:07.720 --> 3:15:12.520
 And one of the reasons I despise Giuliani as much as I do, and there's very few politicians

3:15:12.520 --> 3:15:18.200
 out there that I despise more, is because he was the first guy to use RICO on financiers.

3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:19.800
 And so it wasn't even a drug dealer.

3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:24.680
 It was you accused of a financial fraud.

3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:26.160
 You weren't shown to be guilty.

3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:27.160
 Accused.

3:15:27.160 --> 3:15:28.160
 Accused.

3:15:28.160 --> 3:15:29.160
 Yeah.

3:15:29.160 --> 3:15:30.660
 Your assets basically were forfeiture.

3:15:30.660 --> 3:15:31.960
 Innocence of proven guilty went out the window.

3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:34.120
 If you were managing money, you were done.

3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:35.120
 You were finished.

3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:37.440
 So you're saying this kind of stuff naturally is what the state is.

3:15:37.440 --> 3:15:38.440
 Hold on.

3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:42.600
 So my point is, what are presented as the strongest criticism of anarchism are inevitably

3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:44.400
 descriptions of status quo.

3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:46.960
 What you're describing is already the event.

3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:49.120
 I am a big insurance company.

3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:50.720
 I don't want to pay you.

3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:52.440
 I call Washington.

3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:54.720
 Either I pay you and Washington gives me a subsidy.

3:15:54.720 --> 3:15:59.240
 So what you're describing is an inevitable aspect of having a government.

3:15:59.240 --> 3:16:03.440
 So what I'm describing is the inevitable evolution of anarchy into a government.

3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:06.520
 I just think that the markets don't consolidate into monopoly.

3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:09.240
 That's the leftist propaganda myth.

3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:13.360
 Not markets where you have substitute products, but this is the problem.

3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:15.680
 The problem is force has no substitute.

3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:18.080
 That is, force is not a product you can have.

3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:22.920
 So this is my fundamental issue about turning competing police forces.

3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:24.320
 Force is not a product.

3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:25.320
 Force is not a service.

3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:26.320
 It's not a service.

3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:27.320
 It's not a service.

3:16:27.320 --> 3:16:28.320
 And it's not a product.

3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:29.320
 Security is not a service?

3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:30.320
 No.

3:16:30.320 --> 3:16:32.880
 Well, security in the context of a legal system is, but this is the point.

3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:37.720
 The legal system, the laws are not a service or a product.

3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:42.440
 They are a different type of human institution.

3:16:42.440 --> 3:16:44.720
 Science is not a product or service.

3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:46.440
 It's a different type of human institution.

3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:48.280
 There are different types of human institutions.

3:16:48.280 --> 3:16:49.560
 Some are marketable.

3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:50.800
 You can create markets in.

3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:51.960
 Some you cannot.

3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:54.280
 Law is not a marketable system.

3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:55.780
 Can I ask a question quickly?

3:16:55.780 --> 3:16:59.600
 Is there any other field other than law that you think you can't create markets?

3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:00.600
 Well, science.

3:17:00.600 --> 3:17:01.600
 Science is not marketable.

3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:03.160
 The science itself is not marketable.

3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:04.480
 But science is true.

3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:05.880
 And the same I think is in law.

3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:07.280
 Law is not marketable.

3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:10.840
 Law is the system that allows markets to happen.

3:17:10.840 --> 3:17:15.560
 You need a system of law, whether it's private law in a particular narrow context or whether

3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:16.720
 it's broader law.

3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:20.320
 Law is the context in which markets arise.

3:17:20.320 --> 3:17:25.000
 So one of the reasons we transact is we know that there's a certain contract between us,

3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:28.760
 explicit or implicit, that is protected by a certain law, whether it's protected by private

3:17:28.760 --> 3:17:29.760
 agency or private.

3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:30.760
 The government doesn't matter.

3:17:30.760 --> 3:17:34.400
 But there's a certain contract that is protectable, right?

3:17:34.400 --> 3:17:35.400
 Theoretically.

3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:36.400
 Theoretically.

3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:37.400
 Yes.

3:17:37.400 --> 3:17:40.680
 So law is the context in which markets arise.

3:17:40.680 --> 3:17:47.720
 You don't create a market because there's nothing above it, in a sense.

3:17:47.720 --> 3:17:51.480
 It is the context that allows markets to be created.

3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:54.360
 Once you market it, markets fall apart.

3:17:54.360 --> 3:17:55.360
 So hold on a second.

3:17:55.360 --> 3:17:56.360
 Hold on.

3:17:56.360 --> 3:17:59.000
 So you think that law could be a market?

3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:00.280
 And it already is a market.

3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:02.200
 And we see it, for example, eBay.

3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:05.360
 If I am buying something from Yaron, I won't even know his name.

3:18:05.360 --> 3:18:06.360
 I don't know.

3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:08.240
 Maybe he's in another country.

3:18:08.240 --> 3:18:10.760
 And he screws me out of the money.

3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:11.760
 I don't have access.

3:18:11.760 --> 3:18:12.840
 I can't sue you.

3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:15.240
 Or if I sue you in England, it's good luck with that.

3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:16.840
 You're not going to argue that I'm going to sue you.

3:18:16.840 --> 3:18:21.360
 What happens in this case, which has already been solved by the market, eBay and PayPal,

3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:24.720
 which has access to your bank account, they act as the private arbiter.

3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:27.040
 They're going to get it wrong a lot.

3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:28.040
 Not even a question.

3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:31.840
 Just like Yaron's not going to argue that the government right now gets it wrong a lot.

3:18:31.840 --> 3:18:32.840
 That's not even a question.

3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:38.600
 The point is, at the very least, I'm going to get my resolution faster, cheaper, and

3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:39.840
 more effectively.

3:18:39.840 --> 3:18:44.000
 So the issue with having any kind of government, anything, and Yaron's not going to disagree

3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:50.280
 with this, is at the very least, it's going to be expensive, inefficient, and cause conflict.

3:18:50.280 --> 3:18:51.280
 Yeah.

3:18:51.280 --> 3:18:53.000
 But I think what it allows is exactly...

3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:55.840
 We don't even know what the Supreme Court's going to judge.

3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:00.360
 Again, you're moving us to today's environment, which I'm trying against, right?

3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:01.360
 I'm moving us to reality.

3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:02.360
 No.

3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:03.360
 It doesn't have to be what it is.

3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:04.360
 I mean...

3:19:04.360 --> 3:19:05.360
 That's the most anti rant quote.

3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:06.360
 No.

3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:10.360
 In a sense of the politics, the political reality.

3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:11.640
 I know, but the quote by itself is great.

3:19:11.640 --> 3:19:12.640
 I know.

3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:13.640
 I know.

3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:14.640
 You'd love to...

3:19:14.640 --> 3:19:15.640
 He agrees with Donald Hoffman.

3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:16.640
 Yeah, it turns out I agree with Hoffman.

3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:17.640
 He's an elf.

3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:18.640
 So it's...

3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:20.840
 Where were we?

3:19:20.840 --> 3:19:26.200
 So I believe that because we have a certain system of government, right, it allows for

3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:31.760
 these private innovations to come about that facilitates certain issues in a much more

3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:34.040
 efficient way than the government would deal with it.

3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:40.240
 But it's only because we have a particular system that has defined property rights, that

3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:42.840
 has a clear view of what property rights are.

3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:48.200
 It has a clear view of what a transaction mean or what contract law is.

3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:52.440
 And eBay has a bunch of stuff that you sign, whether you read it or not.

3:19:52.440 --> 3:19:55.320
 All of that is defined first.

3:19:55.320 --> 3:20:01.000
 And then there are massive innovations at the level of particular transactions at the

3:20:01.000 --> 3:20:05.360
 level of an eBay that facilitate increased efficiency.

3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:06.360
 And that's great.

3:20:06.360 --> 3:20:08.560
 But the fact is none of that gets developed.

3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:13.000
 None of that gets created in a world in which I might be living under different definition

3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:14.000
 of property rights.

3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:16.800
 eBay might be living under separate definition of property rights.

3:20:16.800 --> 3:20:19.320
 You might have a third definition of property rights.

3:20:19.320 --> 3:20:24.240
 And there's no mechanism by which we can actually operationalize that because we all have a

3:20:24.240 --> 3:20:25.240
 different system.

3:20:25.240 --> 3:20:26.240
 There is a mechanism.

3:20:26.240 --> 3:20:27.240
 We already have that.

3:20:27.240 --> 3:20:28.880
 Let's change the example I just used.

3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:34.240
 What happens if a Chinese person who has different definition of property rights kills an American

3:20:34.240 --> 3:20:35.240
 in Brazil?

3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:39.960
 Again, in a smaller community, what happens is lots of violence.

3:20:39.960 --> 3:20:42.960
 No, but I'm talking about right now, if a Chinese person has...

3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:47.240
 Right now, the only reason that it doesn't lead to violence is because people are afraid

3:20:47.240 --> 3:20:52.360
 of even more violence and it affects many people, large numbers of people who don't want

3:20:52.360 --> 3:20:53.360
 to go to war.

3:20:53.360 --> 3:21:01.080
 But if you have small... in a state where the states were small, in those little states,

3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:03.960
 there was war all the time for exactly those reasons.

3:21:03.960 --> 3:21:09.720
 Because the cost was lower, because it was more personal, because I knew maybe the person

3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:11.320
 who was killed over there.

3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:13.920
 And I went to my king and encouraged him to go to war.

3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:14.920
 You know why there was war?

3:21:14.920 --> 3:21:15.920
 Violence is constant.

3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:17.040
 You know why there was war?

3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:19.840
 Because there had been no iron rand.

3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:25.120
 And good ideas lead to good societies, which leads to good people, which leads to good

3:21:25.120 --> 3:21:27.000
 behavior, good interrelationships.

3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:31.200
 So now that we have iron rand, all this stuff in the past is irrelevant.

3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:33.840
 Because if they studied her works, we would be...

3:21:33.840 --> 3:21:35.780
 Rand was on Donahue again.

3:21:35.780 --> 3:21:37.360
 You could watch the clip.

3:21:37.360 --> 3:21:43.280
 And he asked her, she goes, he goes, you're saying that if we were more selfish and acted

3:21:43.280 --> 3:21:46.920
 more self interest, there'd be less war, less Hitler.

3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:50.000
 And she said, there wouldn't be any.

3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:51.000
 Right.

3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:52.000
 Right.

3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:53.600
 Well, if we were all selfish, there wouldn't be any Hitler's, right?

3:21:53.600 --> 3:22:01.040
 But who do you regard as the overwinning authority if I am buying a product from you as a summoner

3:22:01.040 --> 3:22:02.680
 in England via eBay?

3:22:02.680 --> 3:22:05.240
 Who's the governing authority?

3:22:05.240 --> 3:22:10.040
 The governing authority is other legal systems in England and the United States, which have

3:22:10.040 --> 3:22:11.760
 to be synchronized pretty well.

3:22:11.760 --> 3:22:12.760
 Right.

3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:13.760
 But what I'm saying is...

3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:16.880
 It's why eBay doesn't function in certain countries, because there is no legal

3:22:16.880 --> 3:22:17.880
 system.

3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:18.880
 I agree with you.

3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:22.720
 My point is, why do those legal systems have to be a function specifically of geography

3:22:22.720 --> 3:22:25.880
 as opposed to why can't I sitting here...

3:22:25.880 --> 3:22:26.880
 I could sit here.

3:22:26.880 --> 3:22:27.880
 You're not...

3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:28.880
 Let me finish my point.

3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:31.800
 I can sit here and be a British diplomat, right?

3:22:31.800 --> 3:22:35.600
 And as a British diplomat, I'm going to be treated differently under American law than

3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:37.720
 you are as an American citizen as you are.

3:22:37.720 --> 3:22:40.880
 Why can't you have that same process?

3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:45.440
 Sure we're geographically proximate, but I'm a citizen of this company and you're a

3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:47.240
 citizen of that company.

3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:50.000
 Why would that be different in your opinion?

3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:55.480
 If it's England and the United States, it's probably not going to matter that much, right?

3:22:55.480 --> 3:23:00.760
 But if it's Iran and the United States, then the fact that we're sitting next to each other

3:23:00.760 --> 3:23:01.760
 makes a huge difference.

3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:02.760
 Oh, I agree.

3:23:02.760 --> 3:23:03.760
 Massive difference.

3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:07.840
 And the fact is that, and I in the end, I think would be the first acknowledges, and

3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:10.760
 this is why she was so opposed to Anarchy.

3:23:10.760 --> 3:23:12.600
 That's not why it is...

3:23:12.600 --> 3:23:13.600
 It's because of Rothbard.

3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:14.600
 No.

3:23:14.600 --> 3:23:16.200
 It has nothing to do with Rothbard.

3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:17.200
 Nothing.

3:23:17.200 --> 3:23:18.200
 Nothing.

3:23:18.200 --> 3:23:19.200
 How do you know?

3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:20.200
 Nothing.

3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:21.200
 How would you know?

3:23:21.200 --> 3:23:23.880
 Because of the argument against Anarchy as an intellectual one, not a personality

3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:24.880
 based one.

3:23:24.880 --> 3:23:25.880
 Can it be both?

3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:26.880
 No.

3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:27.880
 Back to Iran.

3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:28.880
 Back to Iran.

3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:29.880
 No.

3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:30.880
 It has nothing to do with Rothbard.

3:23:30.880 --> 3:23:31.880
 You don't know that.

3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:32.880
 You're not a psychic.

3:23:32.880 --> 3:23:33.880
 Or a necromancer.

3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:36.520
 The only way we're going to resolve this is on wrestling, right?

3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:37.520
 It's through violence.

3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:40.160
 On wrestling is not violence.

3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:41.160
 Words are violence.

3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:42.160
 Words are violence.

3:23:42.160 --> 3:23:43.160
 Words are violence.

3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:44.160
 Emotions are violence.

3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:48.000
 He posed me off with this stuff.

3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:49.000
 That's the problem.

3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:50.000
 But that's the truth?

3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:51.000
 He's very, very good.

3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:52.000
 Not facts and truths.

3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:54.680
 I mean, there's distortions and arbitrary statements.

3:23:54.680 --> 3:23:57.900
 Because your statement about Rothbard is an arbitrary statement that has no cognitive

3:23:57.900 --> 3:24:01.040
 standing, and therefore I can dismiss it.

3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:03.040
 I'm not doing like this because I want to dismiss it.

3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:04.040
 Hold on.

3:24:04.040 --> 3:24:05.040
 Let me...

3:24:05.040 --> 3:24:06.040
 It has no cognitive status.

3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:09.120
 The fact that she disliked Rothbard doesn't mean that everything he said she was going

3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:10.280
 to dismiss because she disliked it.

3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:11.280
 I agree with you.

3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:13.300
 What I'm saying is it would not be impossible.

3:24:13.300 --> 3:24:14.440
 But there's no evidence.

3:24:14.440 --> 3:24:15.440
 I'll give you...

3:24:15.440 --> 3:24:16.440
 I'll talk.

3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:17.440
 I'll give you some evidence.

3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:18.440
 It's human psychology.

3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:22.120
 It is not impossible that if you hate some...

3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:23.120
 What's his name?

3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:24.120
 What's that guy's name?

3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:25.120
 Richard Wolff.

3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:26.120
 Right.

3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:29.680
 It's not impossible that if Richard Wolff said something that you would otherwise agree

3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:30.680
 with, you...

3:24:30.680 --> 3:24:31.680
 Hold on.

3:24:31.680 --> 3:24:32.680
 Let me finish.

3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:35.480
 You'd be dismissive or less likely to give him credit for it, being a human being.

3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:36.480
 That's all I'm saying.

3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:41.840
 It's as silly as to say Rothbard came up with his theory of anarchy because he was pissed

3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:43.880
 off at Ayn Rand and wanted to write something.

3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:44.880
 I don't know.

3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:46.680
 Bring it down because...

3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:50.960
 Bring it down so that he can speak too and let's keep it...

3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:51.960
 Because I...

3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:52.960
 I don't think we're getting agitated.

3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:53.960
 No, you guys aren't.

3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:54.960
 No, no, no.

3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:55.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:02.920
 Bring it down, not in terms of a give more pauses so Michael can insert himself.

3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:03.920
 That's what I mean.

3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:04.920
 See, private governance.

3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:05.920
 What's the point of that?

3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:06.920
 Private governance.

3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:07.920
 Look.

3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:08.920
 He's...

3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:09.920
 Look.

3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:10.920
 It's private governance.

3:25:10.920 --> 3:25:12.400
 It's your graphic law of the land.

3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:13.400
 I don't know.

3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:14.400
 That's not the point.

3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:15.400
 I do think that Michael's...

3:25:15.400 --> 3:25:17.440
 I mean, that's interesting that you disagree with this.

3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:23.120
 I do believe that psychology has an impact on ideas and Ayn Rand...

3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:30.400
 You don't think Ayn Rand had grudges that impacted the way she saw the world?

3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:31.640
 We would like to think that...

3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:35.200
 I don't think any of her grudges entered into philosophical statements, at least not

3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:37.240
 that I can tell.

3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:43.640
 And I don't see, and given the centrality Ayn Rand gave, and to the role of government,

3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:48.680
 to the existence of government, to the need for government, to establish real freedom,

3:25:48.680 --> 3:25:52.040
 and the way she defines freedom, which is very different than Rothbard, and the way she

3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:59.920
 defines government, to say then that her opposition to Anarchy is because of, I think, is just

3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:00.920
 an arbitrary statement.

3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:01.920
 I didn't say because of...

3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:02.920
 I didn't say because I didn't say...

3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:03.920
 I didn't say because I didn't say...

3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:04.920
 And not...

3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:07.200
 And I don't see why psychology would enter it.

3:26:07.200 --> 3:26:11.440
 Now, maybe the tone in which you responded to an answer might have been motivated by

3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:12.440
 that or something like that.

3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:15.360
 But given the amount of thought she gave to the role of government in human society and

3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:21.440
 why government was needed, and why you needed laws in order to be free, that freedom didn't

3:26:21.440 --> 3:26:29.040
 proceed, that you needed the right hierarchy, I think that we could say that it...

3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:32.680
 Give her at least the respect that she...

3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:34.400
 She might have been wrong, right?

3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:39.280
 But she had a particular theory that rejected Anarchy, and the thought Anarchy was wrong.

3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:40.280
 Okay, hold on.

3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:45.680
 I really resent, and I don't want to say you're doing this, the implication that if Rand was

3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:49.720
 guided by her passions, that somehow is a criticism of her or lessens her.

3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:52.200
 I think Rand was a very passionate person.

3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:56.960
 I think she loved her husband enormously.

3:26:56.960 --> 3:27:02.320
 She despised certain people enormously, and I don't think that there's anything wrong

3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:03.320
 with that.

3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:06.160
 There's no philosophical position about something because she disliked somebody.

3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:07.160
 I agree.

3:27:07.160 --> 3:27:08.160
 But what I'm saying...

3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:09.160
 Given the amount of thought she gave to that philosophical position.

3:27:09.160 --> 3:27:10.160
 Fair.

3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:16.880
 All I'm saying is, it is possible that if someone comes across ideas that she had not considered

3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:23.500
 before, if she regarded this person as a bad actor, like all of us, she would be less likely

3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:25.200
 to take them under consideration.

3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:26.200
 Sure.

3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:27.200
 That's all I'm saying.

3:27:27.200 --> 3:27:28.200
 Sure.

3:27:28.200 --> 3:27:31.000
 And I think other people confronted her with the ideas of Anarchy, I don't think Rothbard

3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:32.000
 was the only one.

3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:33.000
 Correct.

3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:34.120
 That's what Roy Charles certainly did.

3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:38.000
 And she rejected them, and she rejected them because she had, and whether you agree with

3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:45.320
 her or not, she had a thought out position about why you needed to have this particular

3:27:45.320 --> 3:27:49.880
 structure in place so that markets and human freedom could exist.

3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:54.560
 It's just really interesting because this is the one time, in my view, and please correct

3:27:54.560 --> 3:28:01.160
 me if I'm wrong, where she invokes need as kind of a basis for political activity.

3:28:01.160 --> 3:28:05.360
 So let's suppose you want this federal government, whatever you want, you don't want it like

3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:07.760
 it is now, like your version of the government.

3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:16.040
 I don't see why it's an issue for you, for me and Lex, to say, we're not privy to Washington,

3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:17.680
 we're going to do our own thing.

3:28:17.680 --> 3:28:23.240
 And given if we go about our lives, not initiating force and being productive actors, why she

3:28:23.240 --> 3:28:24.240
 would have an issue with this?

3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:25.240
 Why would I care?

3:28:25.240 --> 3:28:28.920
 Well, you would care because if you're saying the government has a monopoly on force between

3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:29.920
 these two oceans.

3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:32.640
 So you can do that as long as you don't violate somebody else's rights.

3:28:32.640 --> 3:28:33.640
 Sure.

3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:35.600
 But what I'm saying is we just declare ourselves sovereign.

3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:37.600
 We're not going to pay any income taxes.

3:28:37.600 --> 3:28:39.920
 We're going to be peaceful people.

3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:44.240
 And when Lex and I have disputes, we're going to call Joe.

3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:45.240
 That's Joe Rogan.

3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:46.240
 You're never going to get to meet him.

3:28:46.240 --> 3:28:47.240
 But he's a good guy.

3:28:47.240 --> 3:28:48.240
 I know.

3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:50.960
 We're going to call Joe and Joe's going to resolve it between us.

3:28:50.960 --> 3:28:57.200
 He's so good at needling and getting you off topic that way.

3:28:57.200 --> 3:28:58.640
 He's really effective at it.

3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:05.000
 Look, I always say when I debate, when I debate communists, I always say to them, you mean

3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:06.000
 Lex?

3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:07.000
 Yeah.

3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:08.000
 Maybe Lex.

3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:09.000
 Maybe I should do this.

3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:10.000
 Tom Rad, I love you.

3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:14.720
 That if they really believe, if they really believe in what they think, then they should

3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:18.440
 be advocates of capitalism because under capitalism, under my system of government, capitalist

3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:21.960
 government, right, they could go and start a commune.

3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:22.960
 They can live in copiness.

3:29:22.960 --> 3:29:27.240
 They can live to each according to, to each according to his needs, from each according

3:29:27.240 --> 3:29:32.360
 to their ability, all they want and live their pathetic, miserable lives that way.

3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:37.320
 The government would never intervene because the whole view of capitalism is freedom.

3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:38.320
 We live in the way alone.

3:29:38.320 --> 3:29:42.040
 As long as you're not violating my rights, as long as you're not taking my property,

3:29:42.040 --> 3:29:45.120
 as long as you're not engaging.

3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:48.440
 So in that sense, yeah, you and Lex can form your own thing.

3:29:48.440 --> 3:29:50.600
 I don't believe in compulsory taxes anyway.

3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:56.040
 So you and Lex can do your own thing, never pay taxes, as long as you're not violating

3:29:56.040 --> 3:29:58.640
 the laws and the laws are very limited, right?

3:29:58.640 --> 3:30:00.080
 Because they're only there to protect individuals.

3:30:00.080 --> 3:30:04.120
 So as long as you're not violating somebody else's property rights or inflicting force

3:30:04.120 --> 3:30:06.440
 on anybody else, you're peaceful.

3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:07.440
 You can do what you want.

3:30:07.440 --> 3:30:11.840
 You know, don't have, yeah, don't, don't, don't have sex with kids, right?

3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:13.240
 I will stop immediately.

3:30:13.240 --> 3:30:14.240
 Good.

3:30:14.240 --> 3:30:16.160
 The rest of us are just plain checkers and he's plain chess.

3:30:16.160 --> 3:30:17.160
 Yeah.

3:30:17.160 --> 3:30:20.360
 I mean, I mean, a government that protects individual rights properly is a government

3:30:20.360 --> 3:30:23.640
 that leaves you alone to live your life as you see fit, even if you live your life in

3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:26.160
 a way that I don't approve of that I don't think is right.

3:30:26.160 --> 3:30:27.160
 I mean, that's all point.

3:30:27.160 --> 3:30:28.160
 Okay.

3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:29.160
 Then we're going to integrate that.

3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:35.280
 The only thing you can do is, you know, try to enforce arbitrary laws that you come

3:30:35.280 --> 3:30:36.280
 up with on me.

3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:37.280
 Sure.

3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:38.280
 Of course.

3:30:38.280 --> 3:30:39.280
 Absolutely.

3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.280
 Okay.

3:30:40.280 --> 3:30:41.280
 Great.

3:30:41.280 --> 3:30:44.520
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world where rights protecting laws are

3:30:44.520 --> 3:30:50.480
 superfluous, but the reality is usually that somebody violates them whether by accident

3:30:50.480 --> 3:30:55.320
 or, or intentionally, and that you need some mechanism, now if you guys can resolve that

3:30:55.320 --> 3:30:58.880
 dispute without getting involved, fine.

3:30:58.880 --> 3:31:04.200
 But if you guys land up not wanting, not resolving, there is another authority that will help

3:31:04.200 --> 3:31:05.200
 you resolve it.

3:31:05.200 --> 3:31:06.200
 Yeah.

3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:07.360
 Can I ask a question?

3:31:07.360 --> 3:31:13.120
 Under anarchism, what kind of systems of laws do you think will emerge?

3:31:13.120 --> 3:31:18.160
 Do you think we'll have basically a similar kind of layer of universal law to where like

3:31:18.160 --> 3:31:19.160
 Let me answer this.

3:31:19.160 --> 3:31:20.160
 That's a great question.

3:31:20.160 --> 3:31:21.940
 Sorry for this.

3:31:21.940 --> 3:31:25.520
 This is often presented as a criticism of anarchism.

3:31:25.520 --> 3:31:29.040
 And this is actually something I think Yaron would agree with as well in other contexts,

3:31:29.040 --> 3:31:30.280
 which is this.

3:31:30.280 --> 3:31:34.600
 One of the reasons communism can't work, central planning can't work, and this was one of Mises's

3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:40.040
 great innovations is if I could sit down, it's like asking, what would the fashion industry

3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:42.560
 look like if the government didn't run it?

3:31:42.560 --> 3:31:44.080
 There's no way for me to know.

3:31:44.080 --> 3:31:48.280
 What the fashion industry is, which all of us are in favor of it being free, is literally

3:31:48.280 --> 3:31:55.680
 millions of designers, of seamstresses, of people who make the fabric, also references

3:31:55.680 --> 3:31:56.680
 throughout history.

3:31:56.680 --> 3:32:02.480
 And these creative artistic minds putting things together in every year and there's no shortage

3:32:02.480 --> 3:32:03.480
 of clothes.

3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:08.880
 In fact, we make so many clothes that we send them in landfill sizes to overseas poor countries,

3:32:08.880 --> 3:32:11.640
 and you have people in these desperate countries wearing like Adidas shirts.

3:32:11.640 --> 3:32:15.280
 They can't even read English, but because we don't know what to do with all these clothes.

3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:18.360
 That's how the glory of free enterprise is.

3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:24.000
 The problem is, the problem is it's loosely, everything comes cheap and overabundant, like

3:32:24.000 --> 3:32:25.000
 food.

3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:26.480
 Well, it doesn't actually come overabundant.

3:32:26.480 --> 3:32:27.480
 It's done properly.

3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:28.480
 Sure.

3:32:28.480 --> 3:32:29.480
 That's fair.

3:32:29.480 --> 3:32:30.480
 Supply meets demand.

3:32:30.480 --> 3:32:31.480
 Sure, that's fair.

3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:34.320
 But I'm saying is like, if 150 years ago you said, you know, one day we're going to have

3:32:34.320 --> 3:32:38.720
 an issue where there's going to be so much food and then the kids are too fat.

3:32:38.720 --> 3:32:42.400
 It's just going to be like, I have four who are dead in the crib.

3:32:42.400 --> 3:32:43.400
 I wish.

3:32:43.400 --> 3:32:46.680
 I'm not a fan of what kind of a paradise is this.

3:32:46.680 --> 3:32:50.920
 So what you would have, we have this right now in certain centers.

3:32:50.920 --> 3:32:52.080
 You have the Hasidim.

3:32:52.080 --> 3:32:53.080
 You have Sharia.

3:32:53.080 --> 3:32:54.080
 You have different.

3:32:54.080 --> 3:32:58.000
 You have, I'm sure in the medical system, they have their own kind of private courts

3:32:58.000 --> 3:33:01.520
 and court marshals is another example of this although obviously that's through the state.

3:33:01.520 --> 3:33:07.480
 So you would have innovation in law under markets, just the same ways you'd have it.

3:33:07.480 --> 3:33:09.400
 And we have this already.

3:33:09.400 --> 3:33:12.800
 Maybe it's not, Yaron doesn't like in terms of like murder and rape and I can understand

3:33:12.800 --> 3:33:18.620
 why, but in terms of like business and interactions, he would have no problem with different arbitration

3:33:18.620 --> 3:33:22.800
 firms having different rules for like what kind of evidence is allowed.

3:33:22.800 --> 3:33:25.920
 Maybe you only have 60 days to make your case and so on and so forth.

3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:30.120
 And the market is a process of creative innovation and it would be dynamic.

3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:31.120
 It would be changing.

3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:34.440
 So what's interesting, what's interesting relating to this is that one of the ways I

3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:39.240
 ran proposed raising revenue for the government because she was against was let's say we have

3:33:39.240 --> 3:33:41.160
 a contract.

3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:45.640
 We could just have it arbitrated without government interviewing.

3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:50.040
 But if we wanted to access the courts of the government as a final authority, we would

3:33:50.040 --> 3:33:55.640
 pay and that's how governments would raise some of the funds would be raised that way.

3:33:55.640 --> 3:34:02.880
 So this definitely a value to having this innovation and the public space, but I don't

3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:04.680
 believe that is the case with murder.

3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:07.120
 I don't believe that is the case with violent crime.

3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:11.160
 And it's funny you bring up Sharia because David Friedman when he gives when he gives

3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:12.160
 I got to ask you to clarify.

3:34:12.160 --> 3:34:13.280
 I'm not trying to interrupt you.

3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:14.360
 You were talking about with murder.

3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:15.680
 I mean, you would agree.

3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:19.720
 I think it's just to clarify for the audience that there is room for innovation and murder

3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:21.240
 because there's things like mad slaughter.

3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:22.240
 There's murder one, murder two.

3:34:22.240 --> 3:34:23.240
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:26.040
 I don't think it happens at a market level.

3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:28.760
 I don't think there's a market innovation for murder.

3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:32.720
 Somebody has to figure out what those standards are and they will evolve as we gain more knowledge.

3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:36.120
 But we're all agreement that the word murder means very different things.

3:34:36.120 --> 3:34:37.120
 Oh, absolutely.

3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:43.520
 And circumstances matter and standards of proof, standards of evidence, all of that there has

3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:44.520
 to be a standard.

3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:45.520
 And consequences too, yes.

3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:52.120
 All of that there has to be a standard and that's what I think a proper government provides.

3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:59.120
 So David Friedman uses in some of his talks about private law, he uses Sharia law in Somalia

3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:00.120
 as an example.

3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:03.640
 Look, legal systems evolve privately independent.

3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:04.640
 Yeah.

3:35:04.640 --> 3:35:09.120
 Authoritarian ones, ones that don't respect the rights of women at all.

3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:10.120
 Are you married?

3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:11.120
 No, no.

3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:14.160
 But we all want to have sex with our mother, as Freud would say.

3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:16.640
 Oh my God, can we make that a clip?

3:35:16.640 --> 3:35:17.640
 Yeah.

3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:19.640
 Where the hell did that come from?

3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:22.920
 That's much better than what I was just saying about the kids.

3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:23.920
 I appreciate that.

3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:24.920
 Okay.

3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:30.200
 So we went in a voluntary way, although sometimes for Yaron and sometimes for Michael, it felt

3:35:30.200 --> 3:35:34.400
 involuntary, but we all got the big guns.

3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:41.480
 So how do we land this, clearly there's a disagreement about anarchism here?

3:35:41.480 --> 3:35:46.040
 I think there's a big agreement because if Yaron was saying that if I want to have my

3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:51.880
 voluntary stupid thing with you and his government is not going to tax me and is not going to

3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:55.200
 insinuate itself unless we're murdering each other, something like that, I'm okay with

3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:56.200
 that.

3:35:56.200 --> 3:36:00.840
 So if you take the example of Sharia law, which was mentioned earlier, so if you have

3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:10.560
 a little community within this, within my world, that imposes Sharia law, if it starts

3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:15.480
 mutilating little girls, then you impose your law on it.

3:36:15.480 --> 3:36:18.680
 You impose the law on it because it's an issue of protecting individuals.

3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:24.000
 If they want to treat women, if women have to cover up and the women are okay with that,

3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:25.000
 that's fine.

3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:29.440
 If the woman wants to leave, but is not allowed to leave, that's where my government would

3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:35.680
 step in and prevent them from using force against her.

3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:37.680
 And that's it.

3:36:37.680 --> 3:36:42.000
 Now I think it's more complicated than that because I think there are complex issue property

3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:47.000
 rights often where it's not going to be easy for you guys to resolve, and particularly

3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:54.280
 if you interact with people outside of your community, but yeah, my view as government

3:36:54.280 --> 3:36:58.360
 is there to protect individual rights, that's it to otherwise leave you alone.

3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:02.200
 I think this conversation is going to continue for quite a while.

3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:07.200
 Michael has a new book on the topic coming out eventually one day, so you're working

3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:09.840
 also on the still called the White Pill.

3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:10.840
 The White Pill, yeah.

3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:16.880
 And the first line of the White Pill is, Ayn Rand did not laugh.

3:37:16.880 --> 3:37:21.600
 I'm not joking, that's literally the first line because it opens up with her, who knows

3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:24.800
 what the book's going to look like when it's done, but as of now that's the beginning because

3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:29.680
 it opens up with her testimony at the House of American Activities Committee, where she's

3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:36.000
 trying to explain to these Congress people what it was like when she left the Soviet

3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.240
 Union and they are just befuddled by it.

3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:40.240
 Can you explain she did not laugh?

3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:43.960
 Well, because the first line, the fountain head spoiler alert is how it worked left.

3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:45.600
 So this is a little inversion of that.

3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:51.640
 It says Ayn Rand did not laugh because she had this, Ayn Rand was a huge fan of America

3:37:51.640 --> 3:37:53.880
 as am I.

3:37:53.880 --> 3:37:57.480
 She took our political system very seriously.

3:37:57.480 --> 3:38:00.120
 She had enormous reverence for institutions.

3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:06.680
 One example of this is one of the villains of the Atlas Shrugged is based on Harry Truman.

3:38:06.680 --> 3:38:08.840
 I think Thompson is the character's name.

3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:13.560
 And because she had such respect for the title of president, she refers to him as the chairman.

3:38:13.560 --> 3:38:14.560
 She couldn't even bring herself.

3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:16.640
 She had a huge respect for the presidency.

3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:20.800
 I wonder if she'd still have it, even the last string of presidents.

3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:27.240
 So having her, which sets up the broader point of the book, which I'm sure I'll be back

3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:32.160
 on this show to discuss, assuming this bridge hasn't been burned, but I'll try my best.

3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:34.440
 All three of us are canceled.

3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:36.200
 Some are more canceled than the others.

3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:37.200
 Uh oh.

3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:38.200
 I don't know.

3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:39.200
 I don't know.

3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:40.200
 I'm looking at you, Michael.

3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:45.960
 The point being, which sets up the broader point of the book is how ignorant many people

3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:53.240
 are in the West about the horrors of Stalinism and communism, but also how many people in

3:38:53.240 --> 3:39:01.120
 the West were complicit in saying to Americans, go home, everything's fine.

3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:02.120
 This is great.

3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:03.120
 Sure.

3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:05.920
 You know, this is why Pence and Savarese are sure they're mistakes.

3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:13.600
 And they really made a point to downplay really gratuitously some of the unimaginable atrocities

3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:16.960
 of the communism and just one more sentence.

3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:24.640
 And going through the work and learning about what they actually did is so jaw dropping

3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:29.280
 that it's, and if I didn't know about it and many people I'm friends with who are historians

3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:32.920
 who entered the space, you know, this isn't common knowledge to them, then we can assume

3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:35.200
 that almost no one knows about it.

3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:40.600
 And I think it's very important for people to appreciate whether Republican, Democrat,

3:39:40.600 --> 3:39:45.120
 liberal, whatever, how much of a danger this is.

3:39:45.120 --> 3:39:49.360
 And I think Americans have this, there's a book called, It Can't Happen Here, I think

3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:54.200
 by Sinclair Lewis about a fashion that come to America, we American exceptionalism has

3:39:54.200 --> 3:39:59.120
 a positive context, but also have a negative context where you think we're invincible.

3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:01.560
 All these horrible things that happens in other countries that can't possibly happen

3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:02.560
 here.

3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:03.560
 We're America we're special.

3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:06.520
 And it's completely an absurdity.

3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:07.520
 Yeah.

3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:08.520
 Yeah.

3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:10.020
 Have you seen the movie, Mr. Jones?

3:40:10.020 --> 3:40:11.020
 My friend wrote it.

3:40:11.020 --> 3:40:12.020
 No, I haven't.

3:40:12.020 --> 3:40:16.880
 But Walter Duranty and his quotes, I have a thread on Twitter, Walter Duranty for those

3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:22.560
 who don't know, he won a Pulitzer because he was the New York Times man in Moscow.

3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:29.960
 And endlessly, he was talking about how great it was, how if you hear about this famine

3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.160
 in Ukraine, this is just propaganda, I went to the villages, you know, everyone's happy

3:40:35.160 --> 3:40:36.400
 and fed.

3:40:36.400 --> 3:40:39.200
 A lot of it was explicit lies, you know.

3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:44.160
 And when you realize you're talking about, let's give them the absolute benefit of doubt

3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:49.440
 and accidental genocide, it's still mind boggling.

3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:54.160
 And also, you know, Ann Applebaum, who's just a phenomenal, phenomenal writer, she wrote

3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:57.680
 a book called Red Fam and Stalin's War on Ukraine.

3:40:57.680 --> 3:41:05.360
 And she talks about how what people in America don't appreciate is how clever in their sadism

3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:06.960
 the Soviets were.

3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:10.600
 And what they knew to do to Ukraine is everyone is starving.

3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:14.320
 So they knew if you got some meat on your bones, you're hiding food.

3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:18.760
 So they come back at night, take your hand, put in the door jam, keep slamming the door,

3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:19.760
 ransack your house.

3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:24.240
 They didn't have to find the food, burn down your house, take all your clothes, goodbye

3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:25.240
 and good luck.

3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:26.240
 I don't recall saying good luck.

3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:27.240
 Yeah.

3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:31.360
 So I highly recommend the movie because it's very well done.

3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:32.480
 It's very well directed.

3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:33.980
 It's beautifully made.

3:41:33.980 --> 3:41:38.400
 It's stunningly effective in illustrating exactly that.

3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:44.360
 The scenes in Ukraine during the famine, oh, your heart, I mean, it's just, it's crushing.

3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:45.680
 And it shifts to black and white.

3:41:45.680 --> 3:41:48.400
 It's very, very well made aesthetically.

3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:49.400
 So highly recommend.

3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:50.800
 And it's written by Andrew Shalupa.

3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:52.760
 She's a Ukrainian friend of mine.

3:41:52.760 --> 3:41:53.760
 She interests me.

3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:57.080
 Yannmi Park, who's a big North Korean defector.

3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:02.240
 And it's, this is the kind of thing where I think more people need to, when I wrote

3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:06.920
 The New Right, which talks a lot about the Nazis or the kind of neo Nazis, one of their

3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:11.600
 big complaints about, you know, against people who are Jewish is like, oh, we hear all about

3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:12.600
 the Holocaust.

3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:13.600
 How come you don't talk about the Hall of the Moor?

3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:15.160
 I'm like, I'm trying to do my part.

3:42:15.160 --> 3:42:18.760
 I agree with you that we need to be talking more about the Hall of the Moor.

3:42:18.760 --> 3:42:19.760
 Yeah.

3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:20.760
 Absolutely.

3:42:20.760 --> 3:42:24.280
 And it's sad that not more movies that are anti Soviet, which tells you a lot about the

3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:26.440
 view of the intelligentsia.

3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:27.440
 It's a great idea.

3:42:27.440 --> 3:42:29.080
 It just was badly implemented.

3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:30.320
 And no, it's a rotten idea.

3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:31.320
 It's an evil idea.

3:42:31.320 --> 3:42:32.320
 And it was implemented.

3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:33.320
 Exactly.

3:42:33.320 --> 3:42:34.320
 It was implemented.

3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:35.320
 Exactly how it has to be implemented.

3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:36.320
 There's no alternative.

3:42:36.320 --> 3:42:44.520
 Can we talk about the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and which character do you find most

3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:49.720
 fascinating ones that kind of you meet in your own mind that you almost have conversations

3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:54.080
 with or as an influence on you and your life in general?

3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:57.560
 You know what character I like because I know no good or bad side, no one, no one ever gives

3:42:57.560 --> 3:42:58.560
 this answer.

3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:03.920
 This is my just aesthetically, you know, sometimes you're drawn to a character and it's if this

3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:07.240
 person were real, you think they're just hard, but there's something about the resonance

3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:08.240
 with you.

3:43:08.240 --> 3:43:09.240
 I can't even explain this.

3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:15.080
 But I love the character in Atlas Shrugged of Lillian Reardon, who's Hank Reardon's wife.

3:43:15.080 --> 3:43:19.120
 And what I, what is amazing about her, she says, she's his wife.

3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:24.040
 He's his big industrialist, innovator, and she's this like former beauty in that.

3:43:24.040 --> 3:43:30.840
 But she's so cold and soulless that there's, I mean, I joke about, you know, Anne Rand's

3:43:30.840 --> 3:43:32.180
 vampire novels.

3:43:32.180 --> 3:43:37.160
 That character is as close to a literal vampire as you're going to see in Rand.

3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:42.240
 And there's just this great scene where, you know, Hank Reardon invents Reardon Medal.

3:43:42.240 --> 3:43:45.800
 It's this great medal, which is extremely strong, but extremely, it's like light.

3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:48.240
 So this creates all these innovations.

3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:52.120
 And he brings her a bracelet made of the first Reardon medal.

3:43:52.120 --> 3:43:53.440
 This is his life goal.

3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:55.560
 It's like Prometheus bringing fire.

3:43:55.560 --> 3:43:57.560
 And she's like, what the fuck is this?

3:43:57.560 --> 3:43:58.560
 It'd block me diamonds.

3:43:58.560 --> 3:43:59.560
 Yeah, it could probably die.

3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:00.560
 What is this shit?

3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:04.360
 And Dagny, who is another industrialist, she's a heroin, very strong female character

3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.960
 in Atlas Shrugged, is at a party and she goes, I got diamonds, let's trade.

3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:10.640
 And Lillian's like, you want this?

3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:14.720
 And she's like, yes, because that's the concretization that human mind, these are rocks.

3:44:14.720 --> 3:44:17.080
 And Lillian's like, okay, whatever.

3:44:17.080 --> 3:44:23.800
 And that character is someone who has a lot of resonance in our culture.

3:44:23.800 --> 3:44:25.600
 This kind of soulless.

3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:31.640
 It's easy to write a soulless male figure like Peter Keating in some ways is soulless.

3:44:31.640 --> 3:44:39.240
 But that for some reason, when it's like a soulless female, it seems that much more chilling

3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:40.240
 and effective.

3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:44.440
 Do you not agree, though, that Lillian Reardon is amazingly, very powerful figure?

3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:47.200
 And I think Reardon is too.

3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:51.200
 And what I love about Reardon is his evolution, right?

3:44:51.200 --> 3:44:52.200
 He's so flawed.

3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:54.440
 He's a hero who's completely flawed.

3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:59.320
 And it drives me nuts when people say, who characters are cartoonish, they never changed,

3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:01.320
 there's no emotion.

3:45:01.320 --> 3:45:02.320
 Really?

3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:03.320
 Did you read the same book I did?

3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:07.160
 Because if you take Reardon and he's struggling and he's trying to deal with Lillian and his

3:45:07.160 --> 3:45:10.720
 family and all this stuff, and we know family members like this, right?

3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:15.920
 I mean, there were leeches and parasites, but he's excusing them because that's what

3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:17.240
 he's supposed to do.

3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:23.400
 And then as he evolves to fully realize what's going on, that evolution is difficult.

3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:24.400
 It's hard.

3:45:24.400 --> 3:45:28.000
 Like the scene after he has sex with Dagny, of course, he gives a speech, but the speeches

3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:34.440
 is such a good speech in terms of conveying his mind, body split, right?

3:45:34.440 --> 3:45:36.560
 He thinks he really had fun.

3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:38.320
 He really enjoyed the sex, right?

3:45:38.320 --> 3:45:43.320
 But he thinks it's animalistic, and he thinks it's a sign of his depravity, and he thinks,

3:45:43.320 --> 3:45:48.720
 and here he is, this woman he loves, and he adores her, and he can't connect the two.

3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:50.440
 He can't connect the sex with the love.

3:45:50.440 --> 3:45:53.640
 He can't connect the sex with adoration and with the values.

3:45:53.640 --> 3:45:58.400
 So her characters are anything, I think, but cardboard characters, because I think they

3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:04.840
 are Dagny and the scenes where she's listening to music and gets captured by the music in

3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:08.240
 the way Rand describes that, I think it's just beautiful.

3:46:08.240 --> 3:46:16.160
 Or the scene, my favorite scene in Atlas is the scene where they're taking the first

3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:24.200
 train ride across the John Goldridge, and they're in the engine room, and it's traveling through.

3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:29.960
 And the way she's describing Dagny, it's almost like Dagny's having sex with the machine.

3:46:29.960 --> 3:46:34.820
 It's so powerful emotionally, their success, the fact that they did it.

3:46:34.820 --> 3:46:40.400
 They told them it was impossible, and the train is going really fast, and that whole,

3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:44.000
 it's got a sexual vibe to it.

3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:49.000
 It's all about passion, it's all about success, and it's all about the success of their minds,

3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:51.200
 and nobody else matters.

3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:54.760
 What's really great about that scene, just in terms of constructing the novel, I'm not

3:46:54.760 --> 3:46:56.280
 going to spoil anything.

3:46:56.280 --> 3:47:00.840
 So the Atlas Shrugged has three acts, like three act structure is not uncommon.

3:47:00.840 --> 3:47:06.200
 And the first act is about Hank Reardon overcoming all this adversity at home in his personal

3:47:06.200 --> 3:47:10.040
 life and in his business to create this great achievement.

3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:14.880
 So Rand really makes the reader invested in this character and his accomplishments.

3:47:14.880 --> 3:47:20.280
 He's unambiguously doing something good, there's no downside here, he's making it easier to

3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:24.200
 transport people, transport food, this is really just great.

3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:29.080
 And it's just, once you read it and you look back, you're like, she does such a masterful

3:47:29.080 --> 3:47:33.920
 job of making, you have to be a fan of this person and root for them, because she's like,

3:47:33.920 --> 3:47:36.800
 oh, you think things are going great, he's overcome?

3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:37.800
 Hold on a minute.

3:47:37.800 --> 3:47:44.600
 And then the rest of it, she's just, and your sense of injustice is triggered as a reader

3:47:44.600 --> 3:47:48.640
 to such an end degree, because you saw what he went through to get to this point, and

3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:51.600
 now you're seeing it taking away people in fear, and I feared him.

3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:56.920
 And one of the quotes on Twitter I use all the time is, I'll see someone, politician

3:47:56.920 --> 3:48:02.640
 or bureaucrat or a thinker, just advocate for something completely unconscionable.

3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:07.880
 And I'll just quote and say, my favorite criticism of Ein Rand is that they say her villains

3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:12.960
 are too evil and unrealistic, because the things that people posit with a straight face

3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:16.480
 are so much worse than she has in her book.

3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:18.680
 And not just politicians, you find intellectuals today.

3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:19.680
 Oh, of course.

3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:20.680
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

3:48:20.680 --> 3:48:24.280
 Way, way over the time, you know, even when I read it at the strike that was good, nobody

3:48:24.280 --> 3:48:25.440
 really talks like this.

3:48:25.440 --> 3:48:26.440
 No, they do.

3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:28.120
 Let me give you one example.

3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:30.400
 There was a story she wrote, which she never published.

3:48:30.400 --> 3:48:33.560
 They published her journals, the Ein Rand Institute.

3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:37.080
 And there was one character, and this is a prototype of Ellsworth II, he was the villain

3:48:37.080 --> 3:48:39.520
 of one of the villains of the Fountainhead.

3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:43.580
 And basically the kid had like deformed legs or broke his leg or something like that.

3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:45.640
 And he wants to get leg braces.

3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:47.640
 And the dad is like, oh, we're not going to do that.

3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:49.080
 Why should you be better than anyone else?

3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:52.320
 Like, you should just have like this deformity, accept defeat.

3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:56.240
 And you're reading this, I'm like, what dad is not going to give his kid leg braces?

3:48:56.240 --> 3:48:57.360
 This is ridiculous.

3:48:57.360 --> 3:49:03.600
 But now it's not uncommon for deaf children to not get cochlear implants and not be able

3:49:03.600 --> 3:49:08.520
 to hear because their parents say, well, we're going to lose deaf culture.

3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:09.600
 Hearing is just information.

3:49:09.600 --> 3:49:13.560
 And you're sitting there and whether you agree with this or not, this is very close to what

3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:14.880
 she was saying.

3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:18.720
 And when I read what she was saying, I'm like, okay, crazy Ein Rand, this is not a thing.

3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:23.160
 And it's like, oh, yeah, the craziness is that it's not braces, it's hearing.

3:49:23.160 --> 3:49:24.160
 It's, yeah.

3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:26.000
 And what evil to deny your kid hearing.

3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:27.720
 I mean, God.

3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:28.880
 So here's the other thing.

3:49:28.880 --> 3:49:32.200
 If you want deaf culture, which I would believe is a thing, sign language or whatever, they

3:49:32.200 --> 3:49:33.200
 could turn it off.

3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:34.200
 Yeah.

3:49:34.200 --> 3:49:35.200
 Yeah.

3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:36.200
 If you want it, you give them a choice.

3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:37.200
 Yeah.

3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:38.200
 Tonight, I'm starting one more thing.

3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:41.680
 To, you know, Rand used the word evil frequently.

3:49:41.680 --> 3:49:45.280
 And I think maybe I can make the argument she uses too loosely.

3:49:45.280 --> 3:49:49.400
 If you are denying a child the gift of music, I will say that's evil.

3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:50.400
 I agree.

3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:51.400
 Completely.

3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:52.400
 Unambiguously.

3:49:52.400 --> 3:49:53.400
 Yep.

3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:59.120
 If you're online and listen, watch videos of people getting hearing aids and being able

3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:00.120
 to hear for the first time.

3:50:00.120 --> 3:50:01.120
 And seeing what happens to their faces.

3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:06.440
 I promise you, you will cry because there's no pure, I'm getting teared up right now.

3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:12.560
 There's no pure expression of humanity and technology at its best than seeing a two year

3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:15.440
 old or one and a half year old who can't even talk.

3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:18.040
 And then you see their reaction when they hear mom's voice.

3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:20.360
 It's so beautiful and moving.

3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:21.360
 Absolutely.

3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:22.360
 Yeah.

3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:23.360
 It's so moving.

3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:28.360
 It's like, it's one of the ways to rethink technology perhaps.

3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:32.480
 And there's this, this is really funny because sometimes it'll be this tough dude, right?

3:50:32.480 --> 3:50:34.040
 And he's been deaf all his life.

3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:36.760
 And then he, they put hearing and the girlfriend's like, can you hear me?

3:50:36.760 --> 3:50:41.760
 And he's trying to be tough for three seconds and you just sit there and it's just this.

3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:42.760
 No, absolutely.

3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:43.760
 And that's true of any sense.

3:50:43.760 --> 3:50:44.760
 I mean.

3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:47.040
 Like colorblind people seeing color for the first time, that kind of thing.

3:50:47.040 --> 3:50:48.040
 I think there's a few.

3:50:48.040 --> 3:50:50.840
 It's not quite the same, but it's somewhat.

3:50:50.840 --> 3:50:54.680
 But if you're blind and suddenly can see, yeah, I mean, it's just, it's just stunning.

3:50:54.680 --> 3:50:55.680
 Right?

3:50:55.680 --> 3:50:57.200
 I mean, and, and how do we form our concepts?

3:50:57.200 --> 3:51:01.080
 How do we think we have to, we get information from reality, right?

3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:05.760
 We, we, we interact with reality through our senses and that's how we become conceptual

3:51:05.760 --> 3:51:09.720
 beings and you deny an element of that from a human being.

3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:10.720
 That is horrible.

3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:12.960
 There's a potential with that, with the neuro link too.

3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:14.600
 So further developments there.

3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:19.080
 So I mean, on that, there's a powerful question of who is John Galt?

3:51:19.080 --> 3:51:21.280
 I don't know if we can do this without spoiler alert.

3:51:21.280 --> 3:51:22.280
 Yeah.

3:51:22.280 --> 3:51:23.280
 That's for the book.

3:51:23.280 --> 3:51:24.280
 Okay.

3:51:24.280 --> 3:51:25.280
 Well, but you can say, you can say.

3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:26.440
 What, what's the importance of this character?

3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:27.440
 What's the importance of this question?

3:51:27.440 --> 3:51:31.480
 I mean, without the importance of, so I want to give a talk on who is John Galt.

3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:35.680
 And who is John Galt in a sense as anybody who takes their own life seriously, anybody

3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:41.000
 who's willing to really live fully their own life, use their mind in pursuit of their

3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:48.680
 rational values and pursue their happiness fully uncompromisingly with no comp, with no,

3:51:48.680 --> 3:51:54.080
 you know, compromise and, and you know, sticking to the integrity, anybody can be John Galt

3:51:54.080 --> 3:51:55.080
 in that sense.

3:51:55.080 --> 3:52:01.840
 I, I think one of the mottos I live by is all we are tested.

3:52:01.840 --> 3:52:04.280
 Maybe this is a little bit religious, but I think you're on is going to agree with it.

3:52:04.280 --> 3:52:05.840
 I'm sure you'll agree with it.

3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:09.600
 All any of us can do is leave the world a little bit of a better place than we found

3:52:09.600 --> 3:52:10.600
 it.

3:52:10.600 --> 3:52:15.400
 And I think if you do that through hard work, being honest, being a kind, not at the expense

3:52:15.400 --> 3:52:19.560
 of other people, you can go to your grave and patting yourself on the back.

3:52:19.560 --> 3:52:23.000
 I mean, I mean, to me, the, the, the leaving the world a better place.

3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:24.000
 Yeah.

3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:28.720
 I mean, that's, that's, that's not what drives me, what drives me is, I mean, what, what

3:52:28.720 --> 3:52:29.720
 I think drives people.

3:52:29.720 --> 3:52:34.680
 I think just live a good life and good life means a life you're happy living.

3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:39.480
 And part of that is the impact you have on, on the world, but it's, you know, so many

3:52:39.480 --> 3:52:45.200
 people live wasted lives, live mediocre lives, live conventional lives, you know, maybe they

3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:49.440
 even leave the world a better place, but they didn't really, they didn't leave the world

3:52:49.440 --> 3:52:50.440
 a better place.

3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:54.760
 They left the world a better place, but they didn't, they didn't, they didn't live their

3:52:54.760 --> 3:52:55.760
 potential.

3:52:55.760 --> 3:53:00.520
 They didn't, or they, or they died feeling guilty about it, or they, they, a million

3:53:00.520 --> 3:53:01.520
 different things.

3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:05.600
 So there's so many productive people, I mean, think about all the innovators and the technologists

3:53:05.600 --> 3:53:09.040
 and the businessmen who leave the world a better place by a big shot.

3:53:09.040 --> 3:53:10.440
 And they're never happy.

3:53:10.440 --> 3:53:14.280
 Never happy in their own, in their own souls, in their own, in their own life.

3:53:14.280 --> 3:53:16.000
 And to me, that's what counts.

3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:18.080
 And if you're going to be happy, you'll leave the better world a bit.

3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:20.200
 And that's what John Volts symbolizes.

3:53:20.200 --> 3:53:28.160
 To me, it's, it's living your life by your standards, by your values and, and, and pursuing,

3:53:28.160 --> 3:53:29.680
 pursuing that, that happens.

3:53:29.680 --> 3:53:33.680
 Well, I take, I'm sorry, I take it in a different context, because I think a lot of, and I don't

3:53:33.680 --> 3:53:34.880
 think you're going to disagree with this.

3:53:34.880 --> 3:53:38.280
 I think a lot of times when you're young, you have unrealistic expectations about what

3:53:38.280 --> 3:53:39.440
 you're going to accomplish.

3:53:39.440 --> 3:53:42.400
 And you think to yourself, well, I thought, let's suppose someone wants to go into politics.

3:53:42.400 --> 3:53:44.480
 Well, if I'm not elected president, I'm a failure.

3:53:44.480 --> 3:53:45.480
 That's nonsensical.

3:53:45.480 --> 3:53:48.880
 There's lots of people who are successful who haven't achieved literally the top position,

3:53:48.880 --> 3:53:49.880
 their role.

3:53:49.880 --> 3:53:54.320
 So if you can go to your grave, having defending everything you've done, and you move the needle

3:53:54.320 --> 3:53:55.320
 in a puff.

3:53:55.320 --> 3:53:56.320
 Successes should not be relative.

3:53:56.320 --> 3:53:57.320
 Yes.

3:53:57.320 --> 3:53:58.320
 So that, that goes back to second handedness.

3:53:58.320 --> 3:53:59.320
 Yes.

3:53:59.320 --> 3:54:03.480
 Success is not being better than other people's, and that is not being the best.

3:54:03.480 --> 3:54:06.440
 Success is maximizing your potential, whatever that is.

3:54:06.440 --> 3:54:13.200
 And look, you know, I know people, you know, I have a son who's, who could be a really

3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:17.160
 good engineer, really good mathematician, really good scientist, but he, he decided

3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:18.920
 he wants the right comedy, right?

3:54:18.920 --> 3:54:23.520
 So he might have been a better mathematicians than he's a comedian, but that's his values.

3:54:23.520 --> 3:54:24.520
 That's his goals.

3:54:24.520 --> 3:54:25.800
 That's what he wants to do.

3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:27.720
 And hopefully he'll be really, really good at that.

3:54:27.720 --> 3:54:31.840
 And he'll be incredibly successful at it, and materially in every other sense.

3:54:31.840 --> 3:54:34.640
 But that's, that's what you pursue, you know?

3:54:34.640 --> 3:54:39.640
 So it's, it's really being true to yourself in a deep sense.

3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:43.240
 And if you are true to yourself, yeah, you'll leave the world a better place, but that's

3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:44.240
 not the essence.

3:54:44.240 --> 3:54:45.240
 The essence is you.

3:54:45.240 --> 3:54:47.360
 No, focus on, focus on you.

3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:50.160
 Focus on making your life the best life that it can be.

3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:54.760
 And if you do that, you'll make the world a better place by, almost by definition.

3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:57.080
 But yeah, you'll impact people.

3:54:57.080 --> 3:55:00.000
 We're looking at the same thing in different ways.

3:55:00.000 --> 3:55:06.760
 It's at least in my little corner of the world, it was disappointing how rare that, that is.

3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:12.880
 So one of the reasons I'm here in Austin, and one of the reasons I, my work gravitated

3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:21.120
 towards Elon Musk is because he represents that person for me in the world of technology,

3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.760
 in the world of CEO, in the world of business.

3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:29.360
 It was very surprising to me, the more I've learned about the world of tech, how few people

3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:35.520
 live unapologetically, fully to their potential.

3:55:35.520 --> 3:55:39.080
 I'm sure people, others do that, maybe music and art.

3:55:39.080 --> 3:55:40.080
 I'm not sure.

3:55:40.080 --> 3:55:41.080
 I don't know about those worlds.

3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:46.000
 I do know about the technology world, and it was disappointing to me how many people

3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:51.480
 compromise their integrity in subtle ways at first, but then it becomes a slippery slope.

3:55:51.480 --> 3:55:52.480
 And then you,

3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:53.480
 Can I say this?

3:55:53.480 --> 3:55:57.520
 There's this great quote, and I always forget if it's Steinbeck or Hemingway, and the quote,

3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:00.840
 and this applies for money and applies for, for morality.

3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:03.320
 The quote was, how did you go bankrupt?

3:56:03.320 --> 3:56:06.520
 And he says two ways, gradually and then suddenly.

3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:09.920
 It's very hard to one day be like, I have no integrity.

3:56:09.920 --> 3:56:11.280
 You know, that doesn't happen.

3:56:11.280 --> 3:56:12.840
 It's very easy.

3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:15.760
 If it's like, look, I stole this candy bar.

3:56:15.760 --> 3:56:16.760
 What's the big deal?

3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:20.680
 If I steal this thing, then you're still, people say they're no slippery slopes.

3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:24.080
 They are, and they're big and they're very slippery and people slide.

3:56:24.080 --> 3:56:25.400
 This is the biggest one.

3:56:25.400 --> 3:56:29.320
 And people violate the integrity even without stealing, just little things about how they

3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:32.480
 treat other people, how they treat themselves, the values they pursue.

3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:34.720
 They don't go after the profession they really wanted to.

3:56:34.720 --> 3:56:39.240
 They compromise with, in ways that they shouldn't with their spouse or with their mothers or

3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:40.240
 whatever.

3:56:40.240 --> 3:56:42.720
 They look the other way when they see justice, yeah.

3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:47.440
 And this is, this is why people go through middle age, midlife crisis.

3:56:47.440 --> 3:56:51.000
 Midlife crisis is a crisis where you suddenly realize, I didn't do it.

3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:52.840
 I, I didn't live up to my standards.

3:56:52.840 --> 3:56:55.920
 I didn't live up to my youthful idealism.

3:56:55.920 --> 3:57:00.040
 I compromised and I sold out, but I also would warn you about Silicon Valley.

3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:01.040
 Yeah.

3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:06.960
 I think, I think at the top, very few of them stick to it and partially it's the political

3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:08.520
 pressure is unbearable.

3:57:08.520 --> 3:57:13.680
 I mean, how would you, how can you, it would require to be a hero and very few of them all.

3:57:13.680 --> 3:57:18.120
 But there are a lot of people who do really well at all kinds of levels in technology

3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:20.160
 who little startups people.

3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:21.320
 And this is the point Michael was making.

3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:22.320
 You don't have to be the best.

3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:23.320
 Yeah.

3:57:23.320 --> 3:57:28.600
 You know, you don't have to be a CEO to, to live to your max and to live with integrity

3:57:28.600 --> 3:57:30.840
 and to live a great life.

3:57:30.840 --> 3:57:35.520
 I know people who do, because they joined Amazon know, whatever, have just made a life

3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:40.760
 for themselves, an amazing life for themselves and have done great work at Amazon, let's

3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:45.360
 say, and then have lived a great life because of the opportunity that, that created for

3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:46.360
 them.

3:57:46.360 --> 3:57:51.520
 So I think they're more good people out there, but, but yes, one of the saddest things of

3:57:51.520 --> 3:57:57.320
 growing up is, is noted, or even when you're, when you're a teenager and looking at adults

3:57:57.320 --> 3:58:03.320
 and noticing how few of them actually live, I mean, are really alive in a sense of living

3:58:03.320 --> 3:58:05.200
 their values and enjoying their life.

3:58:05.200 --> 3:58:08.840
 And you start with your parents and you look across the people.

3:58:08.840 --> 3:58:11.520
 Everybody lives such mediocre lives.

3:58:11.520 --> 3:58:15.520
 And the other thing is they don't have to, that's what people don't appreciate.

3:58:15.520 --> 3:58:18.760
 Particularly not in the world that we live in today that's so wealthy and so many, we

3:58:18.760 --> 3:58:20.440
 all have so many opportunities.

3:58:20.440 --> 3:58:28.080
 But what, by way of advice, what advice would you give to young people to live their life

3:58:28.080 --> 3:58:29.080
 fully?

3:58:29.080 --> 3:58:35.480
 I mean, Michael and I have talked about this, but it bears repeating.

3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:40.160
 So if you look at John Galt, if you look at the highest ideals of what we, of a life who

3:58:40.160 --> 3:58:43.480
 could live, what advice would you give to a 20 year old today?

3:58:43.480 --> 3:58:46.840
 Can I say, I don't think John, I think, and I think Rand would agree.

3:58:46.840 --> 3:58:51.720
 When Rand was writing John Galt, she says, when you have this character's human perfection,

3:58:51.720 --> 3:58:53.400
 you don't want to get too close.

3:58:53.400 --> 3:58:56.920
 So he's a little bit of a vague character because she was aware that when you're dealing

3:58:56.920 --> 3:58:59.480
 with day to day, it kind of, the shine comes off.

3:58:59.480 --> 3:59:03.480
 I think Rourke is a lot better character for a young person.

3:59:03.480 --> 3:59:04.480
 Or weird?

3:59:04.480 --> 3:59:07.320
 Yeah, but Rourke is all, the entirety of the fountain is Rourke.

3:59:07.320 --> 3:59:08.560
 So it really is the one of several.

3:59:08.560 --> 3:59:09.560
 We barely know John Galt.

3:59:09.560 --> 3:59:10.560
 Yeah.

3:59:10.560 --> 3:59:12.980
 So, but Rourke is someone where you could be like, okay.

3:59:12.980 --> 3:59:15.920
 And what Rourke also gives young people is.

3:59:15.920 --> 3:59:16.920
 That's in the fountain head.

3:59:16.920 --> 3:59:20.140
 The fountain head is the strength to persevere.

3:59:20.140 --> 3:59:23.480
 Because when you're young, you're going to have down times.

3:59:23.480 --> 3:59:25.720
 There's going to be times when you're lonely.

3:59:25.720 --> 3:59:28.160
 There's going to be times when you don't have a girlfriend.

3:59:28.160 --> 3:59:31.840
 There's going to be times when you're out of work and you're thinking, holy crap, I'm

3:59:31.840 --> 3:59:33.440
 falling between the cracks.

3:59:33.440 --> 3:59:34.600
 I'm going to accomplish that.

3:59:34.600 --> 3:59:36.040
 I'm going to be a failure.

3:59:36.040 --> 3:59:40.640
 And he gives them the courage to, there's even a scene in the fountain head, which is

3:59:40.640 --> 3:59:42.120
 this amazing scene.

3:59:42.120 --> 3:59:43.120
 I love it.

3:59:43.120 --> 3:59:44.360
 It's not talked about enough.

3:59:44.360 --> 3:59:47.560
 Where basically Rourke is looking at one of his buildings and this little kid on a bicycle

3:59:47.560 --> 3:59:51.280
 comes up to him and you're on, please correct me.

3:59:51.280 --> 3:59:54.720
 And he's like, who built this and Rourke said, I did.

3:59:54.720 --> 3:59:58.560
 And the line is, you know, Rourke didn't realize it, but he just gave that kid the courage

3:59:58.560 --> 4:00:00.080
 to face the lifetime.

4:00:00.080 --> 4:00:06.360
 And I think that is such a beautiful thing where you can find inspiration in this character.

4:00:06.360 --> 4:00:08.440
 Don't become needlessly difficult.

4:00:08.440 --> 4:00:10.040
 Don't start parroting his lines.

4:00:10.040 --> 4:00:12.920
 You're not Howard Rourke and he's not a real person.

4:00:12.920 --> 4:00:16.600
 But there's aspects of him that you can apply to your life.

4:00:16.600 --> 4:00:17.600
 And here's something else.

4:00:17.600 --> 4:00:20.080
 I'll give one example, because this happened to me.

4:00:20.080 --> 4:00:23.800
 When I was working at Goldman Sachs, I was doing tech support and my great grandmother

4:00:23.800 --> 4:00:25.400
 had passed away that year.

4:00:25.400 --> 4:00:27.440
 And I promised my grandmother I'd have thanks.

4:00:27.440 --> 4:00:30.960
 I've told the story several times I would have Thanksgiving dinner with her.

4:00:30.960 --> 4:00:35.760
 I was working second shift fort to midnight and we were 24 seven help desk.

4:00:35.760 --> 4:00:37.960
 And I got the schedule for the next week.

4:00:37.960 --> 4:00:40.920
 And I sold my grandma going to have lunch with her in Thanksgiving.

4:00:40.920 --> 4:00:44.440
 And they had put me down from four to midnight the day before Wednesday, which is my normal

4:00:44.440 --> 4:00:45.440
 shift.

4:00:45.440 --> 4:00:47.160
 But then the day shipped the next day.

4:00:47.160 --> 4:00:48.160
 And I go to my boss.

4:00:48.160 --> 4:00:51.920
 I go, first of all, second shift, I'm like, this Thanksgiving, I promise my grandma.

4:00:51.920 --> 4:00:54.560
 And they're like, well, if you could find someone to fill this, we'll do it.

4:00:54.560 --> 4:00:56.520
 And I asked everyone, they're like, no.

4:00:56.520 --> 4:00:58.600
 And I said, I'm not coming in.

4:00:58.600 --> 4:01:01.320
 And I 100% not even a question.

4:01:01.320 --> 4:01:03.360
 If I asked my grandmother, can we have dinner instead?

4:01:03.360 --> 4:01:04.680
 She would have said yes.

4:01:04.680 --> 4:01:06.360
 But this was one of those moments.

4:01:06.360 --> 4:01:10.280
 Maybe this is from my huge ego where I felt like I was in a movie and I'm making a choice.

4:01:10.280 --> 4:01:15.120
 Am I going to ask grandma or am I going to just bend the knee?

4:01:15.120 --> 4:01:17.760
 And I go, I, I go, I couldn't find anyone.

4:01:17.760 --> 4:01:19.280
 And I go, I'm not coming in.

4:01:19.280 --> 4:01:21.600
 And they go, if you're not coming in, you're fired.

4:01:21.600 --> 4:01:23.160
 And I go, fire me.

4:01:23.160 --> 4:01:27.080
 And they did fire me and I'm, and I have no regrets.

4:01:27.080 --> 4:01:31.120
 And cause if they, if I, if I'd compromised, I'd have money in my pocket.

4:01:31.120 --> 4:01:34.080
 But since I didn't compromise, I could look at that story.

4:01:34.080 --> 4:01:36.720
 Rand talks about how man is a being of self made soul.

4:01:36.720 --> 4:01:38.520
 I could look at that story.

4:01:38.520 --> 4:01:43.440
 And next time I have a time where it's a tough decision where there's really pressure.

4:01:43.440 --> 4:01:45.040
 I could be like, you know what?

4:01:45.040 --> 4:01:47.120
 This is the kind of person you are.

4:01:47.120 --> 4:01:48.120
 Stick to it.

4:01:48.120 --> 4:01:49.120
 I'll give one more example.

4:01:49.120 --> 4:01:50.120
 I'm sorry.

4:01:50.120 --> 4:01:51.120
 You're on.

4:01:51.120 --> 4:01:54.480
 I've given talks on networking and I tell people, I like to use humor because humor is

4:01:54.480 --> 4:01:57.200
 a great way to shortcut the brain and get the truth to them directly.

4:01:57.200 --> 4:02:03.040
 I say, if you know someone is in town sell it with, it's their birthday and they're not

4:02:03.040 --> 4:02:04.840
 doing anything, take them out.

4:02:04.840 --> 4:02:06.360
 And I say, I do this for Rand reasons.

4:02:06.360 --> 4:02:07.360
 I do it selfishly.

4:02:07.360 --> 4:02:08.760
 And the audience laughs.

4:02:08.760 --> 4:02:09.760
 And I go, you're laughing.

4:02:09.760 --> 4:02:14.880
 But I go, the guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.

4:02:14.880 --> 4:02:15.880
 That could be you.

4:02:15.880 --> 4:02:16.880
 There's nothing stopping you.

4:02:16.880 --> 4:02:18.480
 You're just not thinking of these terms.

4:02:18.480 --> 4:02:20.320
 What's it going to cost you $30?

4:02:20.320 --> 4:02:24.360
 But for the rest of their life or a few years, that person will remember you and be like,

4:02:24.360 --> 4:02:25.360
 you know what?

4:02:25.360 --> 4:02:30.200
 This person did right by me and I'll give you a concrete example which changed my life

4:02:30.200 --> 4:02:31.200
 profoundly.

4:02:31.200 --> 4:02:36.000
 Ted Hope, who was the producer of the film, American Splendor, which starred by mentor

4:02:36.000 --> 4:02:42.240
 Harvey Picar, sent an email to his firm that said, Harvey's in town with nothing to do.

4:02:42.240 --> 4:02:44.440
 If you want to hang out with him, here's your chance.

4:02:44.440 --> 4:02:47.760
 They worked at a film company and I was the only one.

4:02:47.760 --> 4:02:48.760
 I got the email.

4:02:48.760 --> 4:02:52.240
 I wasn't working there from a friend who took him up on it.

4:02:52.240 --> 4:02:56.040
 And as a consequence, Harvey wrote a graphic novel about me, Egon Hubris, which is $250

4:02:56.040 --> 4:02:58.440
 in eBay now and it moves at that, not too shabby.

4:02:58.440 --> 4:03:01.920
 The point being, you know what?

4:03:01.920 --> 4:03:03.640
 Someone had a movie made about him.

4:03:03.640 --> 4:03:08.000
 Egon is an interesting figure, take the lunch and stay overtime for an hour.

4:03:08.000 --> 4:03:13.400
 But so many people don't think in those terms and there's so many opportunities for them.

4:03:13.400 --> 4:03:14.520
 So that's the advice I give.

4:03:14.520 --> 4:03:17.600
 And I think it's also good to give advice via anecdote.

4:03:17.600 --> 4:03:21.920
 So not only is the person getting the advice, they are learning why you got to that point.

4:03:21.920 --> 4:03:24.400
 And maybe I'm wrong, but at least they've thought about it.

4:03:24.400 --> 4:03:25.400
 Yeah.

4:03:25.400 --> 4:03:26.400
 I mean, I agree with all of that.

4:03:26.400 --> 4:03:31.400
 And I like the line, Iron Man's line about man as a self made soul is a creature of self

4:03:31.400 --> 4:03:36.840
 made soul is huge and it's something most people don't realize and it's something that

4:03:36.840 --> 4:03:39.160
 modern intellectuals undermine.

4:03:39.160 --> 4:03:43.200
 I mean, even somebody like Sam Harris, when you keep telling people they don't have free

4:03:43.200 --> 4:03:48.680
 will, then you don't have a self made soul because what is self made, there is no self

4:03:48.680 --> 4:03:49.840
 according to Sam, right?

4:03:49.840 --> 4:03:52.760
 He meditates and he sees that he doesn't have a self.

4:03:52.760 --> 4:03:59.120
 So you're undermining the ability of people to take control of their own lives and make

4:03:59.120 --> 4:04:03.360
 the kind of choices that are necessary to create the kind of moral character that is

4:04:03.360 --> 4:04:05.600
 necessary for them to be successful.

4:04:05.600 --> 4:04:11.040
 So I'd encourage people to go read, found head and that was shrugged because put aside

4:04:11.040 --> 4:04:17.320
 the politics, put aside even aspects of the philosophy, focus on these models.

4:04:17.320 --> 4:04:22.560
 These are, you know, how to walk is a great model for all of us.

4:04:22.560 --> 4:04:27.360
 It's a great story to have in your head, in your mind when you encounter challenging

4:04:27.360 --> 4:04:30.560
 choices that you might make.

4:04:30.560 --> 4:04:35.000
 And then spend the time, and this is, you know, I don't think I ever did this when I

4:04:35.000 --> 4:04:36.000
 was young.

4:04:36.000 --> 4:04:39.200
 I don't think people do this, but spend the time thinking about what your values really

4:04:39.200 --> 4:04:40.200
 are.

4:04:40.200 --> 4:04:41.600
 What do you love doing?

4:04:41.600 --> 4:04:45.000
 What makes, what gets you going?

4:04:45.000 --> 4:04:46.720
 What gets you excited?

4:04:46.720 --> 4:04:50.080
 And how can I make a living at this?

4:04:50.080 --> 4:04:53.560
 How can I do this and live through this?

4:04:53.560 --> 4:04:58.120
 And then, you know, think about what kind of life you want, what kind of, I don't know,

4:04:58.120 --> 4:04:59.760
 what kind of people you want to hang out with.

4:04:59.760 --> 4:05:03.720
 Don't just, don't let life just happen to you.

4:05:03.720 --> 4:05:04.720
 Think it through.

4:05:04.720 --> 4:05:07.840
 What kind of people, for example, if you want ambitious, excited, maybe you should move

4:05:07.840 --> 4:05:11.160
 to Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas, right?

4:05:11.160 --> 4:05:14.720
 If you want to be around artsy people, maybe you should go to Hollywood, maybe you should

4:05:14.720 --> 4:05:15.720
 go to New York.

4:05:15.720 --> 4:05:20.360
 You know, I don't know, but figure out what kind of life you want to live, what kind of

4:05:20.360 --> 4:05:23.760
 people you want to hang out with, what kind of woman you want to spend your life with,

4:05:23.760 --> 4:05:27.720
 what kind of romantic relationship you want to have.

4:05:27.720 --> 4:05:29.440
 Figure that out and go and do it.

4:05:29.440 --> 4:05:30.440
 Don't sit around.

4:05:30.440 --> 4:05:31.600
 Life is not...

4:05:31.600 --> 4:05:32.600
 Or try and fail.

4:05:32.600 --> 4:05:33.600
 It's okay.

4:05:33.600 --> 4:05:34.600
 You're going to fail.

4:05:34.600 --> 4:05:35.600
 Oh, failure.

4:05:35.600 --> 4:05:36.600
 Failure.

4:05:36.600 --> 4:05:37.600
 Absolutely.

4:05:37.600 --> 4:05:38.600
 Yeah.

4:05:38.600 --> 4:05:39.600
 And learn from that failure.

4:05:39.600 --> 4:05:40.600
 And that's the other thing.

4:05:40.600 --> 4:05:41.840
 Think about what you're doing, why you're succeeding, why you're failing, and keep improving.

4:05:41.840 --> 4:05:44.160
 Keep working on it because it's not just going to happen like this.

4:05:44.160 --> 4:05:48.160
 Nobody, nobody, nobody is Francisco to take a character out of Atlas Shark to succeed at

4:05:48.160 --> 4:05:50.400
 everything first try, right?

4:05:50.400 --> 4:05:51.760
 We all need to fail a few times.

4:05:51.760 --> 4:05:52.760
 We all need to...

4:05:52.760 --> 4:05:56.240
 But what have you got to lose?

4:05:56.240 --> 4:05:58.800
 Every second is never going to be back.

4:05:58.800 --> 4:06:02.480
 I mean, these are all cliches, but they're all true cliches.

4:06:02.480 --> 4:06:11.440
 So think, figure out what your values are, and try to apply your reason, your rational

4:06:11.440 --> 4:06:13.400
 thought on getting those values.

4:06:13.400 --> 4:06:18.440
 And try to... we talked about early on in the show, in the interview, we talked about integrating

4:06:18.440 --> 4:06:21.200
 your emotions with your cognition.

4:06:21.200 --> 4:06:24.920
 I think that's crucial because you don't want to be fighting your emotions as you move towards

4:06:24.920 --> 4:06:25.920
 these things.

4:06:25.920 --> 4:06:28.440
 You don't want your emotions to be barriers to your own success.

4:06:28.440 --> 4:06:31.800
 You want them to be cheerleaders, right?

4:06:31.800 --> 4:06:37.200
 To cheer on when good things happen and to be negative emotions when it's justified that

4:06:37.200 --> 4:06:38.360
 they're negative.

4:06:38.360 --> 4:06:41.040
 So work on integrating your soul.

4:06:41.040 --> 4:06:44.200
 So creating your soul, that's the real challenge.

4:06:44.200 --> 4:06:46.440
 And I'll give one piece of meta advice.

4:06:46.440 --> 4:06:49.440
 When you're young, you're going to be clueless because you're going to be ignorant.

4:06:49.440 --> 4:06:50.720
 You don't have the data.

4:06:50.720 --> 4:06:56.400
 Don't ask your dopey friends for advice because they want to be helpful, but the friends want

4:06:56.400 --> 4:06:57.400
 to be helpful.

4:06:57.400 --> 4:06:58.400
 They're as dopey as you.

4:06:58.400 --> 4:06:59.680
 They have uninformed as you.

4:06:59.680 --> 4:07:02.480
 So they're just going to give you platitudes and you're going to be worse off because

4:07:02.480 --> 4:07:06.200
 now you're going to get confused, especially with social media.

4:07:06.200 --> 4:07:09.320
 Reach out to people who are older than you, who are accomplished.

4:07:09.320 --> 4:07:13.480
 You'd be surprised how often you got to send them 20 bucks, buy them dinner, buy their

4:07:13.480 --> 4:07:15.320
 book, whatever it takes.

4:07:15.320 --> 4:07:22.360
 You are getting free world class advice for very cheap and that is really a mechanism

4:07:22.360 --> 4:07:23.360
 for success.

4:07:23.360 --> 4:07:25.800
 And here's something very unpopular and not sexy.

4:07:25.800 --> 4:07:28.320
 This is why people probably unfollow me.

4:07:28.320 --> 4:07:29.320
 That's not why.

4:07:29.320 --> 4:07:30.320
 Read.

4:07:30.320 --> 4:07:32.280
 Well, you'll tell me why after.

4:07:32.280 --> 4:07:33.440
 Read, read, read.

4:07:33.440 --> 4:07:36.760
 Because you're not always going to have access to those experts.

4:07:36.760 --> 4:07:39.320
 And I'm not just talking about self help books.

4:07:39.320 --> 4:07:41.280
 I'm not even talking about self help.

4:07:41.280 --> 4:07:42.480
 Read the world with literature.

4:07:42.480 --> 4:07:47.280
 I mean, literature presents you with all the different characters.

4:07:47.280 --> 4:07:50.280
 You know, read Dostoevsky, right?

4:07:50.280 --> 4:07:52.760
 Read who go, right?

4:07:52.760 --> 4:07:56.840
 Read all these authors that have taken time to really create characters and put them in

4:07:56.840 --> 4:08:01.280
 situations that maybe you will never face those exact situations, but you'll face similar

4:08:01.280 --> 4:08:04.600
 situations and they play it out for you.

4:08:04.600 --> 4:08:06.920
 You'll see what the consequences are.

4:08:06.920 --> 4:08:10.520
 Great literature is a real tool for building your soul.

4:08:10.520 --> 4:08:14.840
 Great art generally with literature and particularly because it's more conceptual.

4:08:14.840 --> 4:08:20.200
 What, um, maybe you could speak to love and relationship in your own life, but in general,

4:08:20.200 --> 4:08:25.880
 if we look at Alice Schrock, if we look at Fountainhead, and maybe this is going to become

4:08:25.880 --> 4:08:32.480
 a therapy session for Lex, but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice, how

4:08:32.480 --> 4:08:40.600
 can you be a Rorick Riordan type character and do it, live your life to the fullest in

4:08:40.600 --> 4:08:46.000
 creating the most amazing things that you're able to create and yet have others in your

4:08:46.000 --> 4:08:53.320
 life that you give yourself to in terms of loving them fully and having a family, having

4:08:53.320 --> 4:08:57.800
 kids, but just even just the love of your life kind of thing.

4:08:57.800 --> 4:09:00.240
 How do you balance those things together?

4:09:00.240 --> 4:09:02.240
 Is there anything to say?

4:09:02.240 --> 4:09:04.840
 I'll say one thing because then I'll defer to your own because he's the one who's married

4:09:04.840 --> 4:09:05.840
 here.

4:09:05.840 --> 4:09:07.080
 I don't think it's a balance.

4:09:07.080 --> 4:09:09.560
 I think they complement each other and feed off each other.

4:09:09.560 --> 4:09:12.240
 So it's like, how do you balance having shoes and pants?

4:09:12.240 --> 4:09:14.240
 It's like, no, you want both.

4:09:14.240 --> 4:09:15.240
 You want it all.

4:09:15.240 --> 4:09:19.560
 And having a great partner who thinks you're a badass and then sometimes they're on the

4:09:19.560 --> 4:09:22.320
 stage and you're like, oh my, I'm married to a badass.

4:09:22.320 --> 4:09:23.320
 That's the goal.

4:09:23.320 --> 4:09:24.320
 Am I wrong?

4:09:24.320 --> 4:09:25.320
 No, absolutely.

4:09:25.320 --> 4:09:26.320
 It feeds off of each other.

4:09:26.320 --> 4:09:27.320
 It's synergistic.

4:09:27.320 --> 4:09:28.320
 It's completely synergistic.

4:09:28.320 --> 4:09:33.200
 The problem that people have, I think, where they get into challenges is when they view

4:09:33.200 --> 4:09:35.120
 them as opposites, right?

4:09:35.120 --> 4:09:36.120
 Work or family?

4:09:36.120 --> 4:09:42.840
 Well, if you don't work the family, you can't finance the family, but more than that.

4:09:42.840 --> 4:09:45.760
 Why is your wife going to love you?

4:09:45.760 --> 4:09:47.400
 What are the virtues that you're bringing?

4:09:47.400 --> 4:09:51.040
 If you don't maximize your own potential, if you don't live the best life that you can

4:09:51.040 --> 4:09:52.880
 live, what is it to love?

4:09:52.880 --> 4:09:56.720
 And if she doesn't do the same thing, why do you love her?

4:09:56.720 --> 4:10:02.000
 So you don't get this conflict between work and how do I have a balanced life?

4:10:02.000 --> 4:10:03.600
 Of course, you have a balanced life.

4:10:03.600 --> 4:10:07.200
 You balance it based on your values, and it's never going to be the same.

4:10:07.200 --> 4:10:13.760
 The time you spend at work with family when you're young or when you have little kids

4:10:13.760 --> 4:10:15.960
 or when they're grown up is all going to be different.

4:10:15.960 --> 4:10:19.320
 It's going to depend on your priorities at the point, but it's all going to feed off

4:10:19.320 --> 4:10:20.320
 of each other.

4:10:20.320 --> 4:10:23.200
 So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.

4:10:23.200 --> 4:10:25.520
 Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or not?

4:10:25.520 --> 4:10:26.520
 Does she know what he's doing?

4:10:26.520 --> 4:10:27.520
 I know.

4:10:27.520 --> 4:10:28.520
 I think he's trolling you.

4:10:28.520 --> 4:10:29.520
 Is he trolling you?

4:10:29.520 --> 4:10:30.520
 He's a big troll.

4:10:30.520 --> 4:10:32.080
 Lex is the biggest troll on Twitter.

4:10:32.080 --> 4:10:33.080
 Ever.

4:10:33.080 --> 4:10:34.080
 Ever.

4:10:34.080 --> 4:10:35.080
 Ever.

4:10:35.080 --> 4:10:36.080
 Ever.

4:10:36.080 --> 4:10:37.080
 Sacrifice.

4:10:37.080 --> 4:10:38.080
 Deal with it.

4:10:38.080 --> 4:10:39.080
 Never sacrifice.

4:10:39.080 --> 4:10:40.080
 But see, he means sacrifice in the context.

4:10:40.080 --> 4:10:41.080
 I know.

4:10:41.080 --> 4:10:42.080
 I know.

4:10:42.080 --> 4:10:43.080
 So I'm going to define it.

4:10:43.080 --> 4:10:44.080
 Sacrifice in my world.

4:10:44.080 --> 4:10:45.080
 Can I say one thing before we get sidebar?

4:10:45.080 --> 4:10:48.440
 Rand had a good example of where he's talking about balance.

4:10:48.440 --> 4:10:50.120
 So she was married to this guy, Franco Conner.

4:10:50.120 --> 4:10:51.120
 He was not a cerebral.

4:10:51.120 --> 4:10:52.120
 He was not intellectual.

4:10:52.120 --> 4:10:53.120
 That's fine.

4:10:53.120 --> 4:10:54.120
 She was in love with him.

4:10:54.120 --> 4:10:55.120
 And I met someone who had been friends with Rand.

4:10:55.120 --> 4:10:58.040
 And a lot of times she'd have these conversations with her acolytes to like four in the morning

4:10:58.040 --> 4:10:59.880
 about the most cerebral topics.

4:10:59.880 --> 4:11:02.840
 And I said, and he would always bring them food, he'd stay up and kind of sit there in

4:11:02.840 --> 4:11:03.840
 a corner.

4:11:03.840 --> 4:11:08.080
 And I go, when this was happening, was he sitting there like, oh, God, here goes crazy

4:11:08.080 --> 4:11:09.080
 old iron.

4:11:09.080 --> 4:11:10.080
 And I just got to be bored.

4:11:10.080 --> 4:11:12.080
 And they go, absolutely not.

4:11:12.080 --> 4:11:14.120
 He was so proud of her.

4:11:14.120 --> 4:11:15.680
 He was so excited.

4:11:15.680 --> 4:11:19.520
 In fact, when she got a lot of money from, I think, selling a red pawn, which was her

4:11:19.520 --> 4:11:24.000
 screenplay, which they're produced, he told her, you can buy any kind of fur coat as long

4:11:24.000 --> 4:11:25.000
 as it's mink.

4:11:25.000 --> 4:11:26.000
 He wouldn't.

4:11:26.000 --> 4:11:28.080
 He's like, you earn this, celebrate it.

4:11:28.080 --> 4:11:29.080
 So that was a good example.

4:11:29.080 --> 4:11:31.320
 And that's a good relationship, absolutely.

4:11:31.320 --> 4:11:36.640
 No sacrifice is the giving of a heart of a value and expecting either nothing or something

4:11:36.640 --> 4:11:38.400
 less in return.

4:11:38.400 --> 4:11:41.720
 You don't do that in a love relationship.

4:11:41.720 --> 4:11:45.360
 Your love relationship is a sense, a trade.

4:11:45.360 --> 4:11:46.360
 You're constantly trading.

4:11:46.360 --> 4:11:50.280
 You're not trading materially, but you're trading spiritually.

4:11:50.280 --> 4:11:54.960
 Imagine if I only gave my wife, if I gave spiritually and materially, only in one direction.

4:11:54.960 --> 4:11:57.400
 I'd get sick of it.

4:11:57.400 --> 4:11:58.400
 She'd get sick of it.

4:11:58.400 --> 4:11:59.680
 It would never last.

4:11:59.680 --> 4:12:04.960
 It has to be in give and take constantly in different ways, different values.

4:12:04.960 --> 4:12:10.480
 It's not a monetary exchange, but it's constantly you're giving and you're receiving and you're

4:12:10.480 --> 4:12:11.480
 giving.

4:12:11.480 --> 4:12:15.000
 And that's got to be in balance.

4:12:15.000 --> 4:12:18.600
 And I know a lot of relationship with that gets out of bounds.

4:12:18.600 --> 4:12:22.280
 And one party feels like they're giving all the time to sacrificing.

4:12:22.280 --> 4:12:24.640
 They're giving more than they're receiving in a sense.

4:12:24.640 --> 4:12:26.000
 And it's over.

4:12:26.000 --> 4:12:31.880
 So now people use the word sacrifice, like Jordan Peterson, sometimes he uses it both

4:12:31.880 --> 4:12:32.880
 ways.

4:12:32.880 --> 4:12:33.880
 That's the problem.

4:12:33.880 --> 4:12:34.880
 People use it.

4:12:34.880 --> 4:12:35.880
 I don't know him personally.

4:12:35.880 --> 4:12:39.040
 Jordan Peterson, I said, I didn't call him Jordan.

4:12:39.040 --> 4:12:44.240
 He uses it in his talks as sometimes he uses it as just as I described it and he's supportive

4:12:44.240 --> 4:12:46.600
 of that, like the sacrifice Jesus made.

4:12:46.600 --> 4:12:49.400
 And sometimes he uses it as an investment.

4:12:49.400 --> 4:12:51.200
 But it's not.

4:12:51.200 --> 4:12:56.400
 If you're giving money now expecting a bigger return in the future, that's not a sacrifice.

4:12:56.400 --> 4:12:57.400
 That's an investment.

4:12:57.400 --> 4:12:59.240
 That's why we have two concepts for that.

4:12:59.240 --> 4:13:06.840
 And the same is true, if my wife is ill, and I've got a whole relationship build around

4:13:06.840 --> 4:13:07.840
 what I'm giving.

4:13:07.840 --> 4:13:09.160
 It's not that I'm not getting anything back.

4:13:09.160 --> 4:13:13.120
 What I'm getting back is that she is recovering.

4:13:13.120 --> 4:13:17.400
 Is that she is still alive or whatever it is that I'm keeping.

4:13:17.400 --> 4:13:19.360
 That's the value that I'm getting in return.

4:13:19.360 --> 4:13:21.960
 If I'm not getting that, why am I doing it?

4:13:21.960 --> 4:13:25.000
 Because I signed a contract a long time ago.

4:13:25.000 --> 4:13:28.160
 So it's not a sacrifice.

4:13:28.160 --> 4:13:29.160
 Children are not a sacrifice.

4:13:29.160 --> 4:13:33.400
 If I don't go to the movies because I stay at home with my kids, it's because I love

4:13:33.400 --> 4:13:36.000
 my kids more than I love going to the movies.

4:13:36.000 --> 4:13:40.000
 And if I love going to the movies more than I love staying with the kids, then get a babysitter

4:13:40.000 --> 4:13:43.440
 or don't have kids, which is the better approach.

4:13:43.440 --> 4:13:45.760
 That's a good question.

4:13:45.760 --> 4:13:48.840
 What book did Ayn Rand say is the most evil book in all of serious literature?

4:13:48.840 --> 4:13:49.840
 Tolstoy?

4:13:49.840 --> 4:13:50.840
 Tolstoy.

4:13:50.840 --> 4:13:54.000
 And the reason it was that book, which I haven't read, please correct me if I get the plot

4:13:54.000 --> 4:13:55.000
 wrong.

4:13:55.000 --> 4:13:58.000
 What Rand was saying is the plot is a guy who's a big shot, I think.

4:13:58.000 --> 4:14:01.960
 He marries a stupid girl who has nothing of value to offer him at all and she ends up

4:14:01.960 --> 4:14:02.960
 killing herself.

4:14:02.960 --> 4:14:08.040
 Whereas Rand's version, and we can take this out of the romantic context, I am delighted

4:14:08.040 --> 4:14:10.600
 when I could be of use to my friends.

4:14:10.600 --> 4:14:14.240
 It makes me feel wonderful and not in a kind of parasitic way.

4:14:14.240 --> 4:14:18.320
 It's just like that I'm at a certain point where they call me up, they're having a problem

4:14:18.320 --> 4:14:19.600
 and I've helped them with that problem.

4:14:19.600 --> 4:14:26.560
 Anna Karenina, he gives up the love of his life, the intelligent girl, the amazing girl.

4:14:26.560 --> 4:14:32.280
 He has an affair with the outsider marriage, taints her, is married to the stupid, but

4:14:32.280 --> 4:14:34.480
 she gives him the prestige and everything.

4:14:34.480 --> 4:14:37.280
 Oh, that's clearly very anti Rand.

4:14:37.280 --> 4:14:44.080
 And the smart, the one he loves, she commits suicide in there.

4:14:44.080 --> 4:14:47.480
 Oh, okay, I got it wrong.

4:14:47.480 --> 4:14:53.680
 It's about him choosing mediocrity and nothingness over love.

4:14:53.680 --> 4:14:57.160
 So pursuing your values is so crucial.

4:14:57.160 --> 4:14:58.160
 So don't sacrifice.

4:14:58.160 --> 4:15:02.240
 It doesn't mean that if you want to eat Chinese and she wants to eat Italian, you don't once

4:15:02.240 --> 4:15:04.720
 in a while eat Italian on that day, right?

4:15:04.720 --> 4:15:07.720
 That's silly, right?

4:15:07.720 --> 4:15:12.200
 That's not a sacrifice, not in the sense in which we're talking about.

4:15:12.200 --> 4:15:13.480
 It doesn't mean don't compromise.

4:15:13.480 --> 4:15:16.600
 It doesn't mean don't compromise on the day to day stuff.

4:15:16.600 --> 4:15:20.920
 It means don't compromise a moral values doesn't you don't compromise on the big stuff.

4:15:20.920 --> 4:15:25.880
 And you never and you never sacrifice and that way you have a relationship that's built

4:15:25.880 --> 4:15:32.960
 as equals and and as you admire each other and love at the end of the day is a response

4:15:32.960 --> 4:15:35.240
 to value.

4:15:35.240 --> 4:15:41.480
 If you stop undermining your own value, the person who loves you will stop or will stop

4:15:41.480 --> 4:15:43.280
 loving you will love you less.

4:15:43.280 --> 4:15:47.680
 If you love yourself less, you know, you have to say, I know also said, just in order to

4:15:47.680 --> 4:15:51.320
 say I love you, you have to be able to say the I, right?

4:15:51.320 --> 4:15:54.800
 You have to you have to be somebody you have to know yourself.

4:15:54.800 --> 4:16:02.320
 You have to have value and so love is a love is a profound emotional response to value.

4:16:02.320 --> 4:16:07.560
 So speaking of love and the three of us being on this deserted island for time together,

4:16:07.560 --> 4:16:09.560
 somehow not murdering each other.

4:16:09.560 --> 4:16:13.440
 Let me ask you, you're on Michael.

4:16:13.440 --> 4:16:18.200
 What is the most beautiful thing you find about the the other?

4:16:18.200 --> 4:16:19.200
 So let's go.

4:16:19.200 --> 4:16:20.200
 You're on first.

4:16:20.200 --> 4:16:22.080
 What do you think about Michael?

4:16:22.080 --> 4:16:31.880
 That you appreciate about him that you think, what do you love that he's going to edit it?

4:16:31.880 --> 4:16:32.880
 That makes sense.

4:16:32.880 --> 4:16:33.880
 I just programmed him.

4:16:33.880 --> 4:16:34.880
 Press play.

4:16:34.880 --> 4:16:36.960
 It's all just a prerecorded message.

4:16:36.960 --> 4:16:38.160
 So I've never been Michael before.

4:16:38.160 --> 4:16:39.600
 So this is my, that's not true.

4:16:39.600 --> 4:16:40.600
 You have.

4:16:40.600 --> 4:16:44.480
 And so I don't remember if I'm eating Michael and you're the very beginning of the new

4:16:44.480 --> 4:16:47.440
 right is me meeting you is the, I'm in the book.

4:16:47.440 --> 4:16:48.440
 Yes.

4:16:48.440 --> 4:16:49.440
 All right.

4:16:49.440 --> 4:16:53.400
 Well, now I have to read his book because I mean, it's my presented positively or negatively.

4:16:53.400 --> 4:16:54.400
 Very.

4:16:54.400 --> 4:16:55.400
 Oh, okay.

4:16:55.400 --> 4:16:56.400
 Good.

4:16:56.400 --> 4:16:57.400
 Lex is not so sure.

4:16:57.400 --> 4:16:58.400
 He's like, no, I left it.

4:16:58.400 --> 4:17:01.520
 He goes, are you am I presented positively or negatively?

4:17:01.520 --> 4:17:02.520
 I just go very good.

4:17:02.520 --> 4:17:04.520
 And he's like, oh, good.

4:17:04.520 --> 4:17:10.200
 I'm like, yeah, so he's Michael Sharp.

4:17:10.200 --> 4:17:12.200
 He's quick.

4:17:12.200 --> 4:17:15.680
 He's, he's, he's funny, although some of the humor is beyond me.

4:17:15.680 --> 4:17:16.680
 I'm not sure.

4:17:16.680 --> 4:17:17.680
 That's what I was saying.

4:17:17.680 --> 4:17:18.680
 He's very intelligent.

4:17:18.680 --> 4:17:19.680
 Yeah.

4:17:19.680 --> 4:17:24.960
 He's, he's definitely very intelligent and, but, but also very engaging.

4:17:24.960 --> 4:17:26.680
 I think that's very engaging.

4:17:26.680 --> 4:17:28.160
 I'm a sharp dresser.

4:17:28.160 --> 4:17:33.040
 Oh, he's definitely, well, yeah, I compliment him on stuff that's obvious and everybody

4:17:33.040 --> 4:17:34.040
 can see by the video.

4:17:34.040 --> 4:17:35.040
 Sex appeal.

4:17:35.040 --> 4:17:36.040
 All right.

4:17:36.040 --> 4:17:41.400
 Let me also just comment one thing you mentioned about you deriving joy from being a value

4:17:41.400 --> 4:17:42.400
 to your friends.

4:17:42.400 --> 4:17:43.400
 Yeah.

4:17:43.400 --> 4:17:47.720
 You know, people talk to me about you sometimes because you'll do humor about various things

4:17:47.720 --> 4:17:52.680
 and things like maybe you're some kind of a crazy person or something like that.

4:17:52.680 --> 4:17:53.680
 Yeah.

4:17:53.680 --> 4:17:58.000
 I know you enjoy this aspect of it, but you know, I say that the reason I'm friends with

4:17:58.000 --> 4:18:03.840
 Michael is there's like real love there and like the kind of kindness you give to your

4:18:03.840 --> 4:18:10.440
 friends, to people like they're close to you, to your family is amazing, man.

4:18:10.440 --> 4:18:13.480
 So that's one of my favorite things about you.

4:18:13.480 --> 4:18:19.200
 Your intellect aside, your philosophies aside, your humor aside, I think there's a lot of

4:18:19.200 --> 4:18:20.200
 love in you.

4:18:20.200 --> 4:18:24.120
 That's what I really appreciate, but enough about you, I'm actually getting sick of saying

4:18:24.120 --> 4:18:25.120
 nice things about you.

4:18:25.120 --> 4:18:26.120
 You're always good to say.

4:18:26.120 --> 4:18:28.920
 You know, I take it all back.

4:18:28.920 --> 4:18:32.440
 Can I say one thing?

4:18:32.440 --> 4:18:36.640
 You're joking, but this is something that's very key and it's something in a random context.

4:18:36.640 --> 4:18:44.120
 It is very disturbing and this is not by accident how in our culture, it is poo pooed to show

4:18:44.120 --> 4:18:49.880
 kindness, earnestness, appreciation to tell someone, you see this on Twitter where someone's

4:18:49.880 --> 4:18:50.880
 like, you know what?

4:18:50.880 --> 4:18:51.880
 I read your book.

4:18:51.880 --> 4:18:53.840
 It's made my life a lot better.

4:18:53.840 --> 4:18:55.040
 Okay, simp.

4:18:55.040 --> 4:18:59.960
 And there's a real, it very much comes out of urban like media circles.

4:18:59.960 --> 4:19:06.880
 It's this real disdain for showing appreciation, for showing happiness, for showing kindness.

4:19:06.880 --> 4:19:10.360
 And you don't know, now that I've called it out, you'll notice it, but when you see how

4:19:10.360 --> 4:19:16.880
 common it is and how people can't take compliments, it's the effects of that are extreme and extremely

4:19:16.880 --> 4:19:17.880
 negative.

4:19:17.880 --> 4:19:22.960
 I gotta say about Texas, one of the, so Austin, especially, I mean, I don't really fully know

4:19:22.960 --> 4:19:28.280
 Texas, Texas, but Austin, the friendliness, there's a reason I've been, I've gotten fatter

4:19:28.280 --> 4:19:34.400
 and been drinking a lot is for all the friendliness from random people who are not no longer random.

4:19:34.400 --> 4:19:35.400
 They're just friends.

4:19:35.400 --> 4:19:41.400
 I've made more friends in one week than I have in my entire stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

4:19:41.400 --> 4:19:42.400
 Yeah.

4:19:42.400 --> 4:19:43.400
 Exactly.

4:19:43.400 --> 4:19:44.400
 Yeah.

4:19:44.400 --> 4:19:45.400
 Exactly.

4:19:45.400 --> 4:19:46.400
 One and a half.

4:19:46.400 --> 4:19:47.400
 You know what the number two means?

4:19:47.400 --> 4:19:49.920
 I've never counted up that high.

4:19:49.920 --> 4:19:52.960
 So this is what happens when people are free?

4:19:52.960 --> 4:19:53.960
 No.

4:19:53.960 --> 4:19:57.720
 When people are free and individualistic, it's exact opposite of what people believe.

4:19:57.720 --> 4:20:03.560
 The more collectivist we are, the less free we are, the nastier we are to one another.

4:20:03.560 --> 4:20:08.040
 Individualists who are pursuing their own happiness are incredibly kind, friendly, and supportive

4:20:08.040 --> 4:20:09.040
 people.

4:20:09.040 --> 4:20:10.040
 Okay.

4:20:10.040 --> 4:20:12.240
 And now your task with doing...

4:20:12.240 --> 4:20:13.920
 Talk about bad juju.

4:20:13.920 --> 4:20:21.800
 To practice what you preach is there in your soul that you can find one beautiful thing

4:20:21.800 --> 4:20:26.480
 to say about Iran now that you guys met for the first, second, or third time, or at least

4:20:26.480 --> 4:20:27.640
 in performance.

4:20:27.640 --> 4:20:29.040
 So that's the easy one.

4:20:29.040 --> 4:20:35.920
 So what I like about Yaron is that I think he is taking one of the problems with maybe

4:20:35.920 --> 4:20:42.160
 more old school objectivism is that they would just use Rand's arguments in Rand's

4:20:42.160 --> 4:20:43.160
 way.

4:20:43.160 --> 4:20:44.160
 And it's like, you're a parrot.

4:20:44.160 --> 4:20:46.880
 You're not adding anything and you're not going to be better than her.

4:20:46.880 --> 4:20:48.440
 So you give this talk about...

4:20:48.440 --> 4:20:54.560
 I think you can compare Bill Gates to who was the one who went to jail.

4:20:54.560 --> 4:20:56.560
 Oh, Bernie Madoff.

4:20:56.560 --> 4:20:57.560
 Bernie Madoff.

4:20:57.560 --> 4:21:00.960
 And you make the point, you're like, does anyone here really think Bernie Madoff was

4:21:00.960 --> 4:21:01.960
 happy?

4:21:01.960 --> 4:21:05.160
 Like, yeah, he's successful and he's wealthy, but does he go to bed being like, hey, I'm

4:21:05.160 --> 4:21:06.160
 a great guy?

4:21:06.160 --> 4:21:07.160
 No.

4:21:07.160 --> 4:21:09.080
 And his son kills himself with all this tragedy that goes with him.

4:21:09.080 --> 4:21:15.360
 So I think anyone who takes an ideology or worldview that I think is of value and adds

4:21:15.360 --> 4:21:21.680
 to it and articulates it in a new way, I think is a great accomplishment.

4:21:21.680 --> 4:21:29.640
 I like how uncompromising you are in your views of putting her views forward.

4:21:29.640 --> 4:21:35.880
 And I like how you illustrate how silly it is to argue against anarchism.

4:21:35.880 --> 4:21:37.840
 So I don't really have to do any of the work.

4:21:37.840 --> 4:21:43.600
 As for you, and this I've thought this before many times, you're the first person I met

4:21:43.600 --> 4:21:48.680
 who I come at, literally the first of them, my friend who went to Yeshiva with as a kid,

4:21:48.680 --> 4:21:54.920
 who I come at us, there was a line on friends where Ross and Rachel were thinking of dating.

4:21:54.920 --> 4:21:59.400
 And they go, if we start dating, it would be like the third date because they knew each

4:21:59.400 --> 4:22:00.400
 other well.

4:22:00.400 --> 4:22:01.400
 And then she's like, yeah, but it'd be like that.

4:22:01.400 --> 4:22:02.400
 So it's like a plus and a minus.

4:22:02.400 --> 4:22:06.680
 Like, yeah, you're fast forwarding to seriousness, but it's also the fact that you and I have

4:22:06.680 --> 4:22:11.240
 the same background, like I can sit with your own or any of my other friends and try to

4:22:11.240 --> 4:22:12.240
 explain it.

4:22:12.240 --> 4:22:17.640
 The fact that intuitively you and I grew up the same and I know that we have that background

4:22:17.640 --> 4:22:23.360
 in common does create a bond because I feel, even if I haven't told you certain things,

4:22:23.360 --> 4:22:27.200
 you are going to understand me a lot better than many of my friends who've known me for

4:22:27.200 --> 4:22:28.200
 a long time.

4:22:28.200 --> 4:22:34.560
 I also really like how I feel, this is a very new age term, but I'm going to use it.

4:22:34.560 --> 4:22:37.440
 I feel very seen when I talk to you.

4:22:37.440 --> 4:22:39.320
 I think you see me for who I am.

4:22:39.320 --> 4:22:42.400
 You appreciate me for who I am.

4:22:42.400 --> 4:22:48.760
 And I also really like how, and this is increasingly common as my platform increases.

4:22:48.760 --> 4:22:52.440
 So I'm very flattered by this.

4:22:52.440 --> 4:22:56.280
 You understand what I'm trying to do and you don't try to get in the way even though it's

4:22:56.280 --> 4:22:57.280
 your show.

4:22:57.280 --> 4:22:59.720
 You're like, okay, this guy's a performer.

4:22:59.720 --> 4:23:01.560
 He's doing his thing.

4:23:01.560 --> 4:23:02.560
 People appreciate it.

4:23:02.560 --> 4:23:03.560
 I appreciate it.

4:23:03.560 --> 4:23:06.160
 I'm not going to try to drive their car.

4:23:06.160 --> 4:23:11.200
 And I think some people who are bad, and I have not encountered this because I would

4:23:11.200 --> 4:23:15.600
 shoot it down, but I think a lot of times people have a tendency when they're hosts

4:23:15.600 --> 4:23:17.560
 to try to drive the car.

4:23:17.560 --> 4:23:21.800
 And it's like, these things work when we come in here, none of us prepare.

4:23:21.800 --> 4:23:26.040
 You're prepared by me, none of us talk beforehand and make it spontaneous.

4:23:26.040 --> 4:23:30.040
 And the audience really enjoys that more because they know it's real, earnest and dynamic.

4:23:30.040 --> 4:23:31.040
 Yeah.

4:23:31.040 --> 4:23:36.320
 I enjoy having you drive the car even though I believe you don't have a license, and you

4:23:36.320 --> 4:23:37.320
 think we're going to crash.

4:23:37.320 --> 4:23:40.880
 No, I think he's an extraordinary interviewer because of all those things.

4:23:40.880 --> 4:23:43.920
 He makes you feel visible.

4:23:43.920 --> 4:23:50.520
 And he does, but he also comes across as really honest, that the questions are really questions

4:23:50.520 --> 4:23:56.640
 that you seem really interested in, that you really want answers to.

4:23:56.640 --> 4:24:02.360
 It doesn't come across as canned or I prepared my three book project questions.

4:24:02.360 --> 4:24:03.520
 Thank you.

4:24:03.520 --> 4:24:04.520
 Thank you, Michael.

4:24:04.520 --> 4:24:10.280
 I was pretty sure that on a desert island, this would end in murder, but now I believe

4:24:10.280 --> 4:24:11.280
 it may.

4:24:11.280 --> 4:24:13.280
 Well, given his comments on Anarchy, it might still.

4:24:13.280 --> 4:24:14.280
 It might still.

4:24:14.280 --> 4:24:15.280
 It might still.

4:24:15.280 --> 4:24:16.280
 It might still.

4:24:16.280 --> 4:24:17.280
 It might still.

4:24:17.280 --> 4:24:18.280
 The day is young.

4:24:18.280 --> 4:24:19.280
 The night is young.

4:24:19.280 --> 4:24:20.280
 It's just the beginning.

4:24:20.280 --> 4:24:21.280
 This is a huge honor.

4:24:21.280 --> 4:24:23.480
 I've been a fan of both of you separately for a long time.

4:24:23.480 --> 4:24:26.800
 I really appreciate you wasting all this time with me today.

4:24:26.800 --> 4:24:28.560
 I love you, Michael.

4:24:28.560 --> 4:24:29.560
 I love you, Iran.

4:24:29.560 --> 4:24:31.640
 We love you too.

4:24:31.640 --> 4:24:35.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Malis and Yaron Brooke.

4:24:35.760 --> 4:24:43.120
 And thank you to Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave, and FourSigmatic.

4:24:43.120 --> 4:24:46.320
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

4:24:46.320 --> 4:24:50.560
 And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

4:24:50.560 --> 4:24:53.960
 Surround yourself with people who make you happy.

4:24:53.960 --> 4:24:58.120
 People who make you laugh, who help you when you're in need.

4:24:58.120 --> 4:25:00.280
 People who genuinely care.

4:25:00.280 --> 4:25:03.720
 They are the ones worth keeping in your life.

4:25:03.720 --> 4:25:06.760
 Someone else is just passing through.

4:25:06.760 --> 4:25:34.840
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
