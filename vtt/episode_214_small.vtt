 The following is a conversation with Jed Buckwald, a professor of history and a philosopher of

00:05.840 --> 00:12.000
 science at Caltech, interested especially in the development of scientific concepts

00:12.000 --> 00:18.560
 and the instruments used to create and explore new effects and ideas in science.

00:23.200 --> 00:30.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Jed Buckwald.

00:31.600 --> 00:38.080
 Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions, as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.240
 or does it progress gradually? What do you think?

00:41.280 --> 00:48.320
 Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years

00:48.320 --> 00:55.680
 ago. He pulled me into it out of physics instead. So I know his work pretty well. And in the years

00:55.680 --> 01:01.120
 when I was at MIT running an institute, he was then in the philosophy department, used to come

01:01.120 --> 01:08.160
 over all the time to the talks we held and so on. So what would I say about that? He of course

01:08.160 --> 01:14.880
 developed his ideas a lot over the years. The thing that he's famous for, the structure of

01:14.880 --> 01:24.720
 scientific revolutions came out in 62. And as you just said, it offered an outline for what he

01:24.720 --> 01:31.120
 called a paradigmatic structure, namely the notion that you have to look at what scientists do

01:31.120 --> 01:38.560
 is forming a community of investigators and that they're trying to solve various puzzles,

01:38.560 --> 01:44.320
 as he would put it, that crop up, figuring out how this works, how that works, and so on.

01:44.320 --> 01:49.680
 And of course, they don't do it out of the blue, they do it within a certain framework. The framework

01:49.680 --> 01:56.400
 can be pretty vague. He called it a paradigm. And his notion was that eventually they run into

01:56.400 --> 02:03.360
 troubles or what he called anomalies, that kind of cracks things, somebody new comes along with

02:03.360 --> 02:10.400
 a different way of doing it, etc. Do I think things work that way? No, not really. Tom and I used to

02:10.400 --> 02:18.720
 have like the discussions about that over the years. I do think there is a common structure

02:19.440 --> 02:26.240
 that formulates both theoretical and experimental practices. And historians nowadays of science

02:26.240 --> 02:32.880
 like to refer to scientific work as what scientists practice. It's almost craftsmen like.

02:32.880 --> 02:41.840
 They can usually adapt in various ways. And I can give you all kinds of examples of that.

02:41.840 --> 02:48.320
 I once wrote a book on the origins of wave theory of light. And that is one of the

02:48.320 --> 02:55.920
 paradigmatic examples that Tom used, only it didn't work that way exactly. Because he thought

02:55.920 --> 03:03.680
 that what happened was that the wave theory ran into trouble with a certain phenomenon

03:03.680 --> 03:10.400
 which it couldn't crack. Well, it turned out that in fact, historically that phenomenon was

03:10.400 --> 03:17.440
 actually not relevant later on to the wave theory. And when the wave theory came in,

03:18.560 --> 03:23.520
 the alternative to it, which had prevailed, which was Newton's views, light as particles,

03:23.520 --> 03:29.520
 that it seemed couldn't explain what the wave theory could explain. Again, not true.

03:30.880 --> 03:37.440
 Not true. Much more complex than that. The wave theory offered the opportunity to deploy

03:38.080 --> 03:45.200
 novel experimental and mathematical structures which gave younger scientists, mathematicians

03:45.200 --> 03:54.960
 and others the opportunity to effect, manufacture, make new sorts of devices. It's not that the

03:54.960 --> 04:01.040
 alternative couldn't sort of explain these things, but it never was able to generate them

04:01.600 --> 04:06.800
 de novo as novelties. In other words, if you think of it as something scientists want to

04:07.840 --> 04:14.160
 progress in the sense of finding new stuff to solve, then I think what often happens is,

04:14.160 --> 04:20.320
 is that it's not so much that the prevailing view can't crack something as that it doesn't give you

04:20.320 --> 04:26.400
 the opportunity to do new stuff. When you say new stuff, are we referring to experimental science

04:26.400 --> 04:33.120
 here or new stuff in the space of new theories? Could be both. Could be both, actually. So how

04:33.120 --> 04:39.440
 does that, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the story of the wave? Sure. The prevailing view

04:39.440 --> 04:44.560
 of light, at least in France, where the wave theory really first took off, although it had

04:44.560 --> 04:49.920
 been introduced in England by Thomas Young. The prevailing theory dates back to Newton,

04:49.920 --> 04:56.400
 that light is a stream of particles and that refraction and reflection involve sort of repulsive

04:56.400 --> 05:04.400
 and attractive forces that deflect and bend the paths of these particles. Newton was not able

05:04.400 --> 05:11.440
 successfully to deal with the phenomenon of what happens when light goes past a knife's edge

05:11.440 --> 05:19.120
 or a sharp edge, what we now call diffraction. He had cooked up something about it that no

05:19.120 --> 05:26.080
 mathematical structure could be applied. Thomas Young first, but really this guy named Augustin

05:26.080 --> 05:35.840
 Frenel in France, deployed, in Frenel's case, rather advanced calculus forms of mathematics,

05:35.840 --> 05:43.360
 which enabled computations to be done and observations to be melded with these computations

05:43.360 --> 05:49.920
 in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton. Did that mean that the Newtonian

05:49.920 --> 05:59.040
 explanation of what goes on in diffraction fails? Not really. You can actually make it work, but

05:59.040 --> 06:06.960
 you can't generate anything new out of it, whereas using the mathematics of wave optics

06:06.960 --> 06:13.280
 in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization, which ironically was discovered

06:13.280 --> 06:20.960
 by partisans of Newton's way of doing things, you were able to generate devices which reflect

06:20.960 --> 06:29.760
 light in crystals, do various things that the Newtonian way could accommodate only after the

06:29.760 --> 06:37.200
 fact they couldn't generate it from the beginning. And so if you want to be somebody who is working

06:37.200 --> 06:45.280
 a novel vein, which increasingly becomes the case with people who become what we now call

06:45.280 --> 06:51.680
 physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular, then that's the direction you're going to go.

06:51.680 --> 06:57.440
 But there were holdouts until the 1850s. I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the

06:57.440 --> 07:02.640
 disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn. Do you still believe in paradigm shifts? Do you still

07:02.640 --> 07:09.600
 see that there is ideas that really have a transformational effect on science? The nature

07:09.600 --> 07:16.560
 of the disagreement has to do with how those paradigm shifts come to be? How they come to be

07:16.560 --> 07:24.800
 and how they change. I certainly think they exist. How strong they may be at any given time is maybe

07:24.800 --> 07:31.600
 not quite as powerful as Tom thought in general, although towards the end of his life he was beginning

07:31.600 --> 07:39.680
 to develop different modifications of his original way of thinking. But I don't think that the changes

07:39.680 --> 07:49.760
 happen quite so neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental observations. They get much

07:49.760 --> 07:59.040
 more complex than that. In terms of neatness, how much of science progresses by individual

07:59.040 --> 08:10.160
 lone geniuses and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and cooperating humans?

08:12.160 --> 08:19.200
 I don't think you can cut that with a knife to say it's this percent and that percent.

08:19.200 --> 08:29.920
 It's almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three individuals who are sort

08:29.920 --> 08:40.080
 of central to what goes on when things begin to shift. Are they inevitably and solely responsible

08:40.080 --> 08:50.080
 for what then begins to happen in a major way? I think not. It depends. You can go very far back

08:50.080 --> 08:59.920
 with this even into antiquity to see what goes on. The major locus we always talk about from the

08:59.920 --> 09:06.720
 beginning is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion, for example, were there ways of

09:06.720 --> 09:14.640
 accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole scheme? Yes. Did it

09:14.640 --> 09:20.960
 eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do other things with it

09:20.960 --> 09:27.040
 that you couldn't otherwise do? Also, yes. Let me give you an example. The great French

09:27.040 --> 09:34.000
 mathematician philosopher Descartes, who was a mechanical philosopher, he believed the world was

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
 matter in motion. He never thought much of what Galileo had done in respect to motion

09:40.640 --> 09:45.120
 because he thought, well, it bested some sort of approximative scheme or something like that.

09:45.760 --> 09:52.560
 But one of his initial, I wouldn't call him a disciple, but follower, who then broke with him

09:52.560 --> 09:58.160
 in a number of ways, was a man named Christian Huygens, who was along with Newton, one of the

09:58.160 --> 10:06.560
 two greatest scientists of the 17th century, Huygens is older than Newton, and Huygens nicely

10:06.560 --> 10:13.840
 deployed Galilean relationships in respect to motion to develop all sorts of things,

10:13.840 --> 10:21.360
 including the first pendulum governed clock and even figured out how to build one,

10:21.360 --> 10:27.120
 which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work, but he had the mathematical structure for it.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.440
 How well known is Huygens? Oh, very well known.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.680
 Should I know him well? Yes, you should.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.640
 Interesting. You should definitely know him well.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.160
 No, no, no, no. Can we define should here? Okay.

10:38.160 --> 10:46.880
 Because I don't. Right. So, is this should like a, yeah, can you define should?

10:48.640 --> 10:55.360
 Should means this. If you had taken up to a second year of physics courses, you should,

10:55.360 --> 11:00.640
 you would have heard his name because one of the fundamental principles and optics is called

11:00.640 --> 11:03.680
 Huygens principle. Okay.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.920
 Okay. Yeah, so I have, and I have heard his name. There you go.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.760
 No, but I don't remember. But you don't remember.

11:09.760 --> 11:15.840
 So, I mean, there's, there's a very different thing between names attached to principles and

11:15.840 --> 11:20.640
 laws and so on that you sometimes let go of. You just remember the equations of the principles

11:20.640 --> 11:26.640
 themselves and the personalities of science. And there's certain personalities, certain human

11:26.640 --> 11:33.440
 beings that stand out. And that's why there is a sense to which the lone inventor, the lone

11:33.440 --> 11:39.840
 scientist is the way I personally, I mean, I think a lot of people think about the history of science

11:39.840 --> 11:45.680
 is these lone geniuses without them. The sense is if you remove Newton from the picture,

11:45.680 --> 11:51.440
 if you remove Galileo from the picture, then science would, there's almost a feeling like

11:51.440 --> 11:56.720
 it would just have stopped there. Or at the very least, there's a feeling like it would

11:56.720 --> 12:01.440
 take much longer to develop the things that were developed. Is that a silly way to look at the

12:01.440 --> 12:12.480
 history? That's not entirely incorrect, I suppose. I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo

12:12.480 --> 12:19.680
 not existed, that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance, given the context of the times,

12:20.400 --> 12:27.760
 what was floating around in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on,

12:27.760 --> 12:34.560
 the developments in mathematics and whatnot, that sooner or later, whether it would have been

12:34.560 --> 12:43.840
 exactly the same or not, I cannot say. But would things have evolved? Yes.

12:44.560 --> 12:52.240
 If we look at the long arc of history of science from back when we were in the caves,

12:53.440 --> 12:58.320
 trying to knock two rocks together, or maybe make a basic tool to

12:58.320 --> 13:05.360
 do a long time from now, many centuries from now, when human civilization finally destroys itself.

13:06.240 --> 13:13.200
 If we look at that history, and imagine you're a historian at the end, like with the fire,

13:13.200 --> 13:19.120
 the apocalypse coming upon us, and you look back at this time in the 21st century,

13:20.240 --> 13:27.120
 how far along are we on that arc? Do you sense? Have we invented and discovered everything that's

13:27.120 --> 13:34.720
 to be discovered, or are we at like below 1%? Well, you're going to get a lot of absurd questions

13:34.720 --> 13:40.480
 today. I apologize. It's a Lugubrius picture you're painting there. I don't even know what

13:40.480 --> 13:48.720
 the word Lugubrius is, but I love it. Lugubrius. Well, let me try and separate the question of

13:48.720 --> 13:55.440
 whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse in several hundred years or not, from the question

13:55.440 --> 13:58.960
 of where science may be sitting. Take this as an assumption.

14:02.560 --> 14:12.160
 I find that hard to say, and I find it hard to say because in the deepest sense of the term,

14:13.280 --> 14:21.040
 as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today, I'm not fundamentally a realist.

14:21.040 --> 14:33.280
 That is to say, I think our access to the inner workings of nature is inevitably mediated by

14:33.280 --> 14:42.320
 what we can do with the materials and factors around us. We can probe things in various ways.

14:42.320 --> 14:48.240
 Does that mean that I don't think that the standard model in quantum electrodynamics

14:48.240 --> 14:53.520
 is incorrect? Of course not. I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing. It can do a lot,

14:54.880 --> 14:59.680
 especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening in very large expensive

15:00.480 --> 15:07.280
 particle accelerators and applying results in cosmology and so on as well.

15:09.280 --> 15:16.960
 Do I think that we have inevitably probed the depths of reality through this? I do not agree

15:16.960 --> 15:24.000
 with Steven Weinberg who thinks we have about such things. Do I, on the other hand, think that

15:24.720 --> 15:30.720
 the way in which science has been moving for the last hundred years, physics in particular is what

15:30.720 --> 15:38.080
 I have in mind, will continue on the same course in that sense? I don't because we're not going

15:38.080 --> 15:44.400
 to be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive machines to rip apart particles

15:44.400 --> 15:49.680
 in various ways. In which case, what are physicists going to do? They'll turn their

15:49.680 --> 15:56.640
 attention to other aspects. There are all sorts of things we've never explained about the material

15:56.640 --> 16:02.160
 world. We don't have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things.

16:04.320 --> 16:09.600
 Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical

16:09.600 --> 16:17.200
 transformations? You can make an argument about it and you can justify things, but in chemistry,

16:17.200 --> 16:22.560
 that's not the way people work. They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships

16:22.560 --> 16:33.200
 and so on. This notion of the deep theory to explain everything is a longstanding belief

16:33.200 --> 16:39.840
 which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form

16:41.520 --> 16:47.680
 sometime towards the end of the 19th century. Maybe we just speak to that. You're referring to

16:48.720 --> 16:54.400
 a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.720
 There's a very specific thing that that currently means in physics,

16:58.720 --> 17:06.480
 is the unification of the laws of physics, but I'm sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe

17:06.480 --> 17:11.680
 something else or was it always about physics? I think as you've kind of implied,

17:14.080 --> 17:17.760
 in physics there's a sense once you get to the theory of everything you've understood everything,

17:18.320 --> 17:21.840
 but there's a very deep sense in which you've actually understood not very much at all.

17:22.400 --> 17:27.440
 You've understood at that particular level how things work, but you don't understand how the

17:27.440 --> 17:31.760
 abstractions on top of abstractions form all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind,

17:31.760 --> 17:38.000
 and the human societies, and all those kinds of things. Maybe you can speak to the theory of

17:38.000 --> 17:42.960
 everything in its history and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything.

17:43.600 --> 17:49.760
 Well, I don't think you can go back that far with something like that, maybe at best to the

17:49.760 --> 17:55.600
 17th century. If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are of course discussions about

17:55.600 --> 18:08.160
 the nature of the world, but first of all, you have to recognize that the manipulative

18:08.160 --> 18:18.800
 character of physics and chemistry, the probing of, let me put it this way, we assume and have

18:18.800 --> 18:26.640
 assumed for a long time, I'll come back to when in a moment, that if I take a little device which

18:26.640 --> 18:33.440
 is really complicatedly made out of all kinds of things, and I put a piece of some material in it,

18:34.240 --> 18:39.760
 and I monkey around with it and do all kinds of unnatural things to it, things that wouldn't

18:39.760 --> 18:46.800
 happen naturally, and I find out how it behaves and whatnot, and then I try and make an argument

18:46.800 --> 18:54.240
 about how that really applies even in the natural world without any artificial structures and so on.

18:54.240 --> 19:03.360
 That's not a belief that was widely held by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe in the 1500s,

19:03.360 --> 19:08.000
 and when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.360
 So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of

19:13.360 --> 19:21.200
 everything. I would put it a little differently, I think it's more along the way a dream that by

19:21.200 --> 19:30.080
 probing nature in artificially constructed ways, we can find out what's going on deep down there.

19:32.640 --> 19:39.200
 So that was that's distinct from science being an observing thing, where you observe nature

19:39.200 --> 19:44.800
 and you study nature. You're talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it.

19:45.600 --> 19:52.080
 Indeed I am, and but that of course is the very essence of experimental science. You have to

19:54.000 --> 20:02.640
 manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince others that you

20:02.640 --> 20:09.200
 haven't so manipulated it that what you've done is to produce what amounts to fake

20:09.200 --> 20:14.080
 artifactual behavior that doesn't really hold purely naturally.

20:14.720 --> 20:20.320
 So where are we today in your sense to jump around a little bit with the theory of everything?

20:21.200 --> 20:29.040
 Maybe a quick kind of sense you have about the journey in the world of physics that we're taking

20:29.040 --> 20:35.040
 towards the theory of everything. Well, I'm of course not a practicing physicist. I mean,

20:35.040 --> 20:40.640
 I was trained in physics at Princeton a long time ago. Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away.

20:41.440 --> 20:46.240
 More or less, I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity. I was an

20:46.240 --> 20:52.000
 undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him and... Well, you made the mistake

20:52.000 --> 20:59.360
 of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back. I suppose so in a way.

21:01.920 --> 21:10.560
 From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech, like Kip Thorne and others,

21:12.560 --> 21:18.800
 the fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even at the deepest level we can

21:18.800 --> 21:29.680
 sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are perhaps quite unique to this

21:29.680 --> 21:38.000
 particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang. The question is, how deep does it go?

21:39.360 --> 21:46.000
 If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion for several decades now has

21:46.000 --> 21:55.360
 been what's called string theory, but that has not been able to figure a way to generate

21:56.480 --> 22:01.680
 probative experimental evidence, although it's pretty good apparently at accommodating things.

22:04.160 --> 22:10.240
 Then the question is, what's before the Big Bang? Actually, the word before doesn't mean anything,

22:10.240 --> 22:19.760
 given the nature of time, but why do we have the laws that prevail in our universe?

22:20.640 --> 22:28.080
 Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe because if they didn't, we wouldn't

22:28.080 --> 22:35.200
 be here. That's a bit of a cyclical, but nevertheless a compelling definition. There's

22:35.200 --> 22:41.600
 all kinds of things like, it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered

22:41.600 --> 22:45.520
 by looking inside of a black hole because you get both the general relativity and the quantum

22:45.520 --> 22:51.040
 mechanics, quantum field theory in there. Experimentally, of course, there's a lot of

22:51.040 --> 22:55.440
 interesting ideas. We can't really look close to the Big Bang. We can look that far back.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.600
 This in Caltech and MIT will lie go looking at gravitational waves, perhaps allows us to march

23:01.600 --> 23:07.200
 backwards and so on. Yeah, it's really exciting space. There's, of course, the theory of everything

23:08.320 --> 23:13.200
 with a lot of things in science captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely

23:13.200 --> 23:20.160
 outside of science. It's the dream of discovering the key to how the nature of how everything works.

23:21.520 --> 23:30.240
 That feels deeply human. That's perhaps the thing, the basic elements of what makes up

23:30.240 --> 23:34.400
 a scientist in the end is that curiosity, that longing to understand.

23:37.440 --> 23:44.000
 Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement with Weinberg on reality. Could you elaborate a little

23:44.000 --> 23:51.760
 bit? Well, obviously, I don't disagree with Steve Weinberg on physics itself. I wouldn't

23:51.760 --> 23:58.080
 know enough to even begin to do that. Clearly, he's one of the founders of the standard model

23:58.080 --> 24:05.200
 and so on. It works to a level of accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before.

24:06.640 --> 24:15.520
 I suppose the question in my mind is something that, in one way, could go back to the philosopher

24:15.520 --> 24:25.040
 Immanuel Kant in the 18th century. Namely, can we really ever convince ourselves that we have

24:25.040 --> 24:39.760
 come to grips with something that is not in itself knowable to us by our senses or even except in

24:39.760 --> 24:46.720
 the most remote way through the complex instruments that we make as to what it is that underlies

24:46.720 --> 24:55.680
 everything? Can we corral it with mathematics and experimental structures? Yes. Do I think that

24:55.680 --> 25:02.560
 a particular way of corraling nature will inevitably play itself out? I don't know.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.240
 It always has. I'll put it to you that way.

25:06.240 --> 25:19.040
 All right. The basic question is, can we know reality? Is that the Kant question? Is that

25:19.040 --> 25:30.400
 the Weinberg question? We humans with our brains, can we comprehend reality? Sounds like a very

25:30.400 --> 25:36.080
 trippy question because a lot of it rests on definitions of know and comprehend and reality, but

25:37.120 --> 25:43.680
 get to the bottom of it. It's turtles on top of turtles. Can we get to the bottom turtle?

25:45.280 --> 25:58.320
 Well, maybe I can put it to you this way in a way that I often begin discussions in a class on

25:58.320 --> 26:09.120
 the history of science and so on and say, I'm looking at you. Yes. You are in fact a figment of

26:09.120 --> 26:17.040
 my imagination. You have a messed up imagination. Yes. Well, what do I mean by that? If I were a

26:17.040 --> 26:30.960
 dragonfly looking at you, whatever my nervous system would form by way of a perceptual structure

26:30.960 --> 26:40.880
 would clearly be utterly different from what my brain and perceptual system altogether is forming

26:40.880 --> 26:50.400
 when I look at you. Who's right? Is it me or the dragonfly?

26:54.080 --> 26:59.840
 Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive, so I don't know. But yes, it's the observer matters.

27:04.240 --> 27:08.720
 Well, what is that supposed to tell us about objective reality?

27:08.720 --> 27:18.560
 Well, I think it means that it's very difficult to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual

27:18.560 --> 27:26.880
 system is leading us to. When we make apparatus and devices and so on, we're still making things,

27:27.520 --> 27:33.040
 the results of which or the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways.

27:33.040 --> 27:39.440
 An analogy I like to use with the students sometimes is this. All right, they all have their

27:39.440 --> 27:47.920
 laptops open in front of them, of course. And I've sent them something to read and I say,

27:47.920 --> 27:52.720
 okay, click on it and open it up. So PDF opens up. I said, what are you looking at?

27:53.520 --> 27:57.840
 I said, well, I'm looking at the paper that you sent me. I said, no, you're not.

27:57.840 --> 28:06.000
 What you're looking at is a stream of light coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen.

28:06.640 --> 28:13.760
 And I said, what happens when you use your mouse and move that fake piece of paper on the screen

28:13.760 --> 28:18.320
 around? What are you doing? You're not moving a piece of paper around, are you? You're moving a

28:18.320 --> 28:25.280
 construct around, a construct that's being processed so that our perceptual system can

28:25.280 --> 28:32.720
 interact with it in the way we interact with pieces of paper. But it's not real.

28:34.800 --> 28:44.000
 So are there things outside of the reach of science? Can you maybe, as an example, talk about

28:44.000 --> 28:47.600
 consciousness, masking for a friend, trying to figure this thing out?

28:47.600 --> 28:58.320
 Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly can't really say much about it.

29:02.880 --> 29:08.640
 I'm a materialist in the deepest sense of the term. I don't think there is anything out there

29:09.280 --> 29:16.480
 except material structures which interact in various ways. Do I think, for example,

29:16.480 --> 29:24.080
 that this bottle of water is conscious? No, I do not. Although how would I know? I can't talk to it.

29:24.960 --> 29:30.480
 But so what do… It's a hypothesis, yeah. It's an opinion, an educated opinion that may be very

29:30.480 --> 29:35.200
 wrong. Well, I know that you're conscious because I can interact directly with you.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.120
 But am I? Well, unless you're a figment of my imagination, of course.

29:39.120 --> 29:47.360
 Nor am I a robot that's able to generate the illusion of consciousness effectively enough

29:47.360 --> 29:51.440
 to facilitate a good conversation because we humans do want to pretend that we're talking

29:51.440 --> 29:54.640
 to other conscious beings because that's how we respect them. If it's not conscious,

29:54.640 --> 29:57.360
 we don't respect them. We're not good at talking to robots.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.680
 That's true. Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense, which is the kind of thing Des

30:01.680 --> 30:10.000
 Cartes said from the beginning. We generalize from that. But I do think that consciousness must be

30:10.880 --> 30:17.520
 something, whatever it is, that occurs as a result of some particular organizational structure of

30:19.440 --> 30:26.640
 material elements. Does materialism mean that it's all within the reach of science?

30:26.640 --> 30:37.760
 My sense would be that especially as neuroscience progresses more and more, and at Caltech,

30:37.760 --> 30:46.560
 we just built a whole neuroscience arena and so on. And as more knowledge is gained about the ways

30:46.560 --> 30:55.200
 in which animals, when they behave, what patterns show up at various parts of the brain and nervous

30:55.200 --> 31:02.160
 system, and perhaps extending it to humans eventually as well, we'll get more of a handle

31:02.880 --> 31:14.800
 on what brain activity is associated with experiences that we have as humans. Can we move

31:14.800 --> 31:22.400
 from the brain activity to the experiences in terms of our person? No, you can't. Perception

31:22.400 --> 31:33.120
 is perception. That's a hypothesis once again. Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of

31:33.120 --> 31:40.800
 physics that's yet to be discovered. Maybe it permeates all matter. Maybe it's as simple as

31:40.800 --> 31:48.320
 trying to plug it in and plug into the ability to generate and control that kind of law of physics

31:48.320 --> 31:54.640
 that would crack open where we would understand that the bottle of water is in fact conscious,

31:54.640 --> 32:00.240
 just much less conscious than us humans, and then we would be able to then generate beings that are

32:00.240 --> 32:05.520
 more conscious. Well, that'll be unfortunate. I'd have to stop drinking the water after that.

32:06.400 --> 32:13.200
 Every time you take a sip, there's a little bit of a suffering going on. What to use the

32:13.200 --> 32:18.240
 most interesting beautiful moments in the history of science? What stands out?

32:19.360 --> 32:27.520
 And then we can pull at that thread. Right. Well, I like to think of events that have

32:29.040 --> 32:38.480
 a major impact and involve both beautiful conceptual, mathematical, if we're talking

32:38.480 --> 32:45.840
 physical structures work and are associated as well with probing experimental situations.

32:46.640 --> 32:56.240
 So among my favorites is one of the most famous, which was the young Isaac Newton's work with

32:56.240 --> 33:02.480
 the colors produced when you pass sunlight through a prism. And why do I like that?

33:02.480 --> 33:10.480
 It's not profoundly mathematical in one sense. It doesn't need it initially. It needs the

33:10.480 --> 33:15.440
 following though, which begins to show you, I think, a little bit about what gets involved

33:15.440 --> 33:20.400
 when you've got a smart individual who's trying to monkey around with stuff and finds new things

33:20.400 --> 33:26.560
 about it. First, let me say that the notion, the prevailing notion going back to antiquity,

33:26.560 --> 33:34.720
 was that colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light, that they're

33:34.720 --> 33:41.200
 modifications of white light. In other words, the colors are not in the sunlight in any way.

33:43.520 --> 33:49.760
 Now, what Newton did following experiments done by Descartes before him, who came to very different

33:49.760 --> 33:59.680
 conclusions, he took a prism, you might ask, where do you get prisms in the 1660s, county fairs.

33:59.680 --> 34:03.840
 They were very popular. They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything,

34:03.840 --> 34:08.160
 but they produced colors. So you could buy them at county fairs and things very popular.

34:08.160 --> 34:11.360
 So they were modifying the white light to create colors.

34:11.360 --> 34:18.720
 Well, they were creating colors from it, well known. And what he did was the following. He was

34:18.720 --> 34:26.640
 by this time, even though he's very young, a very good mathematician. And he could use the then

34:26.640 --> 34:32.400
 known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen

34:32.960 --> 34:39.680
 if you took light from the sun, passed it from a hole through a little hole, then hit the prism,

34:40.240 --> 34:45.600
 goes out of the prism, goes, strikes a wall a long distance away, and makes a splash of light.

34:45.600 --> 34:50.240
 Never mind the colors for a moment. Makes a splash of light there. He was very smart.

34:51.040 --> 34:56.720
 First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that's what everybody's

34:56.720 --> 35:02.800
 paying attention to initially. Because what he knows is this. He knows that if you take this

35:02.800 --> 35:10.240
 prism and you turn it to a certain particular angle, that he knew what it should be because he

35:10.240 --> 35:16.400
 could calculate things. Very few other people in Europe at the time could calculate things

35:16.400 --> 35:23.120
 like he could. That if you turn the prism to that particular angle, then the sun, which is,

35:23.120 --> 35:29.360
 of course, a circle, when its light passes through this little hole and then into the prism,

35:29.360 --> 35:39.120
 on the far distant wall, should still make a circle. But it doesn't. It makes a very long

35:39.120 --> 35:46.800
 image. And this led him to a very different conception of light, indicating that there are

35:46.800 --> 35:52.960
 different types of light in the sunlight. Now, to go beyond that, what's particularly interesting,

35:52.960 --> 36:00.400
 I think, is the following. When he published this paper, which got him into a controversy,

36:01.120 --> 36:05.040
 he really didn't describe at all what he did. He just gave you some numbers.

36:05.040 --> 36:12.240
 Now, I just told you that you had to set this prism at a certain angle. You would think,

36:12.240 --> 36:19.360
 because we do have his notes and so on, you would think that he took some kind of complicated

36:19.920 --> 36:26.640
 measuring device to set the prism. He didn't. He held it in his hand. That's all. And he

36:26.640 --> 36:34.240
 twiddled it around. And what was he doing? It turns out that when you twiddled the prism around,

36:34.240 --> 36:40.960
 at the point where you should get a circle from a circle, it also is the place where the image

36:40.960 --> 36:47.920
 does not move very fast. So if you want to get close to there, you just twiddle it. This is

36:47.920 --> 36:57.680
 manipulative experimentation, taking advantage through his mathematical knowledge of the inherent

36:57.680 --> 37:05.360
 inaccuracies that let you come to exact conclusions, regardless of the built in

37:05.360 --> 37:12.240
 problematics of measurement. He's the only one I know of doing anything like that at this time.

37:13.840 --> 37:18.880
 Well, even still, there's very few people that are able to have, to calculate as well as he did,

37:18.880 --> 37:29.520
 to be a theoretician and an experimentalist in the same moment. Right? It's true, although until

37:30.640 --> 37:39.280
 the, really, well into the 20th century, maybe the beginning of the 20th century, really,

37:40.160 --> 37:46.880
 most of the most significant experimental results produced in the 1800s,

37:46.880 --> 37:53.280
 which laid the foundations for light, electricity, electrodynamics, and so on, even

37:54.320 --> 38:02.960
 hydrodynamics and whatnot, were also produced by people who were both excellent calculators,

38:03.680 --> 38:09.360
 very talented mathematicians, and good with their hands experimentally.

38:09.360 --> 38:18.640
 And then that led to the 21st century with Enrico Fermi, that one of the last people that

38:18.640 --> 38:25.200
 was able to do that, both of those things very well, and that he built a little device

38:25.200 --> 38:28.960
 called an atomic bomb that has some positives and negatives.

38:29.920 --> 38:35.200
 Right. Of course, that actually did involve some pretty large scale elaborate equipment.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.800
 Yeah. Well, holding a president in your hands, same thing.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.520
 Right, no.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.480
 What's the controversy that Newton got into with that paper when he published it?

38:45.840 --> 38:54.560
 Well, in a number of ways, it's a complicated story. There was a very talented character

38:55.200 --> 39:00.800
 known as a mechanic. Mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman who could build and make

39:00.800 --> 39:06.480
 really good stuff, and he was very talented. His name was Robert Hook, and he was the guy who,

39:07.040 --> 39:11.360
 at the weekly meetings of the Royal Society in London, and Newton's not in London,

39:11.360 --> 39:16.000
 you know, he's at Cambridge, he's a young guy, he would demonstrate new things,

39:16.000 --> 39:21.840
 and he was very clever. And he had written a book, in fact, called The Micrographia,

39:21.840 --> 39:30.000
 which, by the way, he used a microscope to make the first depictions of things like a fly's eye,

39:30.000 --> 39:34.960
 the structure of, you know, and had a big influence. And in there, he also talked about light.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.080
 And so he had a different view of light. And when he read what Newton was

39:38.720 --> 39:45.600
 wrote, he had a double reaction. On the one hand, he said, anything in there that is correct,

39:45.600 --> 39:51.680
 I already knew, and anything that I didn't already know is probably not right anyway.

39:51.680 --> 40:01.360
 Got a love egos. Okay. Can we just step back? Can you say who was Isaac Newton?

40:02.480 --> 40:06.480
 What are the things he contributed to this world in the space of ideas?

40:06.480 --> 40:22.400
 Wow. Who was he? He was born in 1642, and near the small town of Grantham in England.

40:23.520 --> 40:29.280
 In fact, the house he was born in, and that his mother died in, is still there and can be visited.

40:29.280 --> 40:42.160
 His father died before he was born, and his mother eventually remarried a man named Reverend

40:42.160 --> 40:52.000
 Smith, whom Newton did not like at all. Because Reverend Smith took his mother away

40:52.000 --> 40:56.560
 to live with him a few miles away, leaving Newton to be brought up more or less by his

40:56.560 --> 41:02.000
 grandmother over there. And he had huge resentment about that his whole life.

41:02.880 --> 41:08.320
 I think that gives you a little inkling that a little bit of trauma in childhood,

41:08.320 --> 41:13.200
 maybe a complicated father son relationship can be useful to create a good scientist.

41:13.920 --> 41:17.520
 Could be, although this case, it would be right, the absent father,

41:17.520 --> 41:23.520
 nonfather relationship, so to speak. He was known as a kid, little that we do know for

41:23.520 --> 41:32.640
 being very clever about flying kites, and there are stories about him putting candles and putting

41:33.360 --> 41:37.920
 flying kites and scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and

41:37.920 --> 41:46.400
 things like that, making things. Most of the physicists and natural philosophers I've dealt

41:46.400 --> 41:53.440
 with, actually, as children, were very fond of making and playing with things. I can't think of

41:53.440 --> 41:58.640
 one I know of who wasn't actually. They were very good with their hands and whatnot.

42:03.600 --> 42:09.840
 His mother wanted him to take over the manner. It was a kind of farming manner. They were

42:09.840 --> 42:14.320
 the class of what are known as yeomans. There are stories that he wasn't very good at that.

42:14.320 --> 42:20.480
 One day, one of the stories is he's sitting out in the field and the cows come home without him,

42:21.040 --> 42:28.560
 and he doesn't know what's going on. Anyway, add relatives, and he manages to get to Cambridge,

42:28.560 --> 42:33.360
 sent to Cambridge, because he's known to be smart. He's read books that he got from local

42:33.360 --> 42:40.000
 dignitaries and some relatives. He goes there as what's known as a subsizer. What does that mean?

42:40.000 --> 42:46.400
 Well, it's not too pleasant. Basically, a subsizer was a student who had to clean the bedpans of the

42:46.400 --> 42:57.440
 richer kids. That didn't last too long. He makes his way and he becomes absorbed in some of the new

42:57.440 --> 43:04.080
 ways of thinking that are being talked about on the parts of Descartes and others as well.

43:04.080 --> 43:10.800
 There's also the traditional curriculum which he follows. We have his notes. We have his student

43:10.800 --> 43:17.840
 notebooks and so on. We can see gradually this young man's mind focusing and coming to grips

43:17.840 --> 43:25.120
 with deeper questions of the nature of the world and perception even, and how we know things,

43:25.120 --> 43:32.800
 and also probing and learning mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds

43:32.800 --> 43:40.080
 on some of the investigations that had been done in the period before him to create the foundations

43:40.080 --> 43:47.360
 of a way of investigating processes that happen and change continuously, instead of

43:47.360 --> 43:52.400
 by leaps and bounds and so on, forming the foundation of what we now call the calculus.

43:54.640 --> 43:59.120
 Can you maybe just paint a little bit of a picture? You've already started of

43:59.120 --> 44:08.720
 what were the things that bothered him the most that stood out to him the most about the traditional

44:08.720 --> 44:14.960
 curriculum, about the way people saw the world. You mentioned discreet versus continuous. Is there

44:14.960 --> 44:20.640
 something where he began thinking in a revolutionary way? Because it's fascinating. Most of us go to

44:20.640 --> 44:30.640
 college, Cambridge or otherwise, and we just take what we hear as gospel, not gospel, but

44:32.080 --> 44:40.400
 as facts. You don't begin to see how can I expand on this aggressively or how can I challenge

44:40.400 --> 44:48.160
 everything that I hear rigorously, mathematically through the—I mean, I don't even know how

44:48.160 --> 44:53.360
 rigorous the mathematics was at that point. I'm sure it was geometry and so on, no calculus, huh?

44:55.200 --> 45:00.480
 There are elements of what turned into the calculus that predate Newton, but—

45:00.480 --> 45:02.320
 How much rigor was there? How much—

45:03.040 --> 45:04.240
 Well, rigor, no.

45:04.800 --> 45:12.480
 And then, of course, no scientific method, not really. I mean, appreciation of data.

45:12.480 --> 45:18.800
 Ah, that is a separate question from a question of method. Appreciation of data is a significant

45:18.800 --> 45:22.640
 question as to what you do with data. There's lots of things you're asking.

45:22.640 --> 45:27.840
 I apologize. So maybe let's backtrack in the first question. Was there something that was

45:27.840 --> 45:33.120
 bothering him that he especially thought he could contribute or work on?

45:34.400 --> 45:39.360
 Well, of course, we can't go back and talk to him, but we do have these student notebooks.

45:39.360 --> 45:45.200
 There's two of them. One's called the Philosophical Questions and the other is called the Waste Book.

45:45.200 --> 45:49.840
 The Philosophical Questions has discussions of the nature of reality and

45:49.840 --> 45:55.120
 various issues concerning it. And the Waste Book has things that have to do with motion

45:55.120 --> 45:59.280
 in various ways, what happens in collisions and things of that sort.

45:59.840 --> 46:04.800
 And it's a complicated story. But what's—among the things that I think are interesting is

46:04.800 --> 46:11.040
 he took notes in the Philosophical Questions on stuff that was traditionally

46:13.120 --> 46:22.080
 given to you in the curriculums going back several hundred years, namely on what scholars refer to

46:22.080 --> 46:29.200
 as scholastic or neoscholastic ways of thinking about the world, dating back to the reformulation

46:29.200 --> 46:35.040
 of Aristotle in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas in the church. And this is a totally

46:35.040 --> 46:38.640
 different way of thinking about things, which actually connects to something we were saying

46:38.640 --> 46:47.360
 a moment ago. For instance, so I'm wearing a blue shirt and I will sometimes ask students,

46:47.360 --> 46:53.120
 where is the blue? And they'll usually say, well, it's in your shirt. And then some of them get

46:53.120 --> 46:58.320
 clear and they say, well, no, you know, light is striking. Photons are reemitted. They strike

46:58.320 --> 47:04.320
 the back of your retina and et cetera, et cetera. And I said, yes. You—what that means is that the

47:04.320 --> 47:14.640
 blue is actually an artifact of our perceptual system considered as the percept of blue. It's not

47:14.640 --> 47:22.880
 out there, it's in here, right? That's not how things were thought about well into the 16th

47:22.880 --> 47:30.320
 century. The general notion dating back even to Aristotelian antiquity and formalized by the

47:30.320 --> 47:40.080
 12th century at the Paris, Oxford, and elsewhere is that qualities are there in the world.

47:41.200 --> 47:48.480
 They're not in us. We have senses and our senses can be wrong. You know, you could get blind,

47:48.480 --> 47:55.520
 things like that. But if they're working properly, you get the actual qualities of the world.

47:55.520 --> 48:03.040
 Now, that break, which is occurring towards the end of the 16th century and is most visible in

48:03.040 --> 48:11.360
 Descartes, is the break between conceiving that the qualities of the world are very different

48:11.360 --> 48:17.920
 from the qualities that we perceive. That, in fact, the qualities of the world consist almost

48:17.920 --> 48:28.640
 entirely in shapes of various kinds and maybe hard particles or whatever, but not colors,

48:28.640 --> 48:36.240
 not sounds, not smells, not softness and hardness. They're not in the world. They're in us.

48:36.240 --> 48:43.360
 That break, Newton is picking up as he reads Descartes. He's going to disagree with a lot in

48:43.360 --> 48:52.080
 Descartes, but that break, he is, among other things, picking up very strongly. That underlies a lot

48:52.800 --> 48:59.040
 of the way he works later on when he becomes skeptical of the evidence provided by the senses.

48:59.040 --> 49:05.040
 Yeah, that's actually, I don't know, the way you're describing is so powerful,

49:05.040 --> 49:12.080
 it just makes me realize how liberating that is as a scientist, as somebody who's trying to

49:12.080 --> 49:24.480
 understand reality, that our senses are not to be trusted, that reality is to be investigated

49:24.480 --> 49:30.800
 through tools that are beyond our senses. Yes. Or that improve our senses.

49:30.800 --> 49:36.320
 Improve our senses, in some ways. That's pretty powerful. I mean, that is,

49:37.680 --> 49:47.680
 for a human being, that's like Einstein level. For a human being to realize, I can't trust

49:47.680 --> 49:58.240
 my own senses at that time. That's pretty trippy. It's coming in. It's coming in. I think it arises

49:58.240 --> 50:05.840
 probably a fair number of decades before that, perhaps in part with all chemical experimentation

50:05.840 --> 50:13.280
 and manipulations, that you have to go through elaborate structures to produce things and ways

50:13.280 --> 50:18.960
 you think about it. But let me give you an example that I think you might find interesting because

50:18.960 --> 50:27.280
 it involves that guy named Hook that Newton had an argument with. He had lots of arguments with

50:27.280 --> 50:32.800
 Hook, although Hook was a very clever guy and gave him some things that stimulated him later.

50:32.800 --> 50:41.200
 Anyway, Hook, who was argumentative, and he really was convinced that the only way to gain

50:41.200 --> 50:50.960
 real knowledge of nature is through carefully constructed devices. He was an expert mechanic,

50:50.960 --> 50:58.160
 if you will, at building such things. Now, there was a rather wealthy man

51:00.000 --> 51:08.560
 in Danzig by the name of Hevelius, Latinized name. He was a brewer in town. He had become

51:08.560 --> 51:17.120
 fascinated with the telescope. This is 30 years or so, 20 or 30 years after the telescope had moved

51:17.120 --> 51:24.480
 out and become more common. He built a large observatory on the top of his brewery, actually,

51:25.440 --> 51:34.800
 and working with his wife, they used these very elaborately constructed grass and metal

51:34.800 --> 51:40.880
 instruments to make observations of positions of the stars. He published a whole new catalog of

51:40.880 --> 51:47.840
 where the stars are. He claimed it was incredibly accurate. He claimed it was so accurate that

51:47.840 --> 51:54.240
 nothing had ever come close to it. Hook reads this, and he says, wait a minute. You didn't use

51:54.240 --> 51:59.600
 a telescope here of any kind because what's the point? Unless you do something to the telescope,

51:59.600 --> 52:05.040
 all you see are dots with stars, you just use your eyes. Your eyes can't be that good. It's

52:05.040 --> 52:10.320
 impossible. So, what did Hook do to prove this? He said, what you should have done is you should

52:10.320 --> 52:15.600
 have put a little device in the telescope that lets you measure distances between these dots.

52:15.600 --> 52:19.600
 You didn't do that, and because you didn't, there's no way you could have been that good.

52:19.600 --> 52:28.960
 At two successive meetings of the Royal Society, he hauls the members out into the courtyard,

52:29.840 --> 52:36.000
 and he takes a card, and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card,

52:36.000 --> 52:40.080
 and he pastes the card up on a wall, and he takes them one by one. He says, now,

52:40.720 --> 52:47.440
 move back, looking at it, presumably with one eye, until you can't tell the black ones from the

52:47.440 --> 52:54.560
 white stripes. He says, that I can then measure the distance. I can see the angles. I can give a

52:54.560 --> 53:03.360
 number then for what is the best possible, what we would call perceptual acuity of human vision.

53:04.080 --> 53:11.680
 And it turned out, he thought, to be something like 10 or more times worse than this guy,

53:11.680 --> 53:21.120
 Hevelius had claimed. So, obviously, he says, well, years ago, I calculated Hevelius's numbers and

53:21.120 --> 53:28.000
 so on using modern tables from NASA and so on, and they are even more accurate than Hevelius

53:28.000 --> 53:35.360
 claimed, and worse than that, the Royal Society sent a young astronomer named Halley over to

53:35.360 --> 53:41.760
 Danzig to work with him, and Halley writes back, and he says, I couldn't believe it, but he taught

53:41.760 --> 53:47.040
 me how to do it, and I could get just as good as he, how is it possible? Well, here, and this

53:47.040 --> 53:52.080
 shows you something very interesting about experiments, perception, and everything else.

53:52.080 --> 53:59.200
 Hooke was right, but he was also wrong. He was wrong for the right reasons, and he was right

53:59.200 --> 54:07.680
 for the wrong reasons, and what do I mean by that? What he actually found was the number

54:07.680 --> 54:14.960
 for what we now call 2020 vision. He was right. You can't tell, except a few people, much better

54:14.960 --> 54:23.840
 than that. But he was observing the wrong thing. What Hevelius was observing was a bright dot,

54:23.840 --> 54:34.560
 a star moving past a pointer. Our eyes are rather similar to frog's eyes. You know,

54:34.560 --> 54:40.880
 I'm sure you've heard the story, if I hold a dead fly on a string in front of a frog and don't

54:40.880 --> 54:47.680
 move it, the frog pays no attention. As soon as I move the fly, the frog immediately tongue

54:47.680 --> 54:54.640
 latches out because the visual system of the frog responds to motion. So does ours, and our

54:55.200 --> 55:00.960
 acuity for distinguishing motion from statics, five or more times better.

55:00.960 --> 55:09.920
 Yeah, that's fascinating. Damn. Of course, maybe you can comment on their understanding

55:10.560 --> 55:13.520
 of the human perceptual system at the time. It's probably really terrible.

55:13.520 --> 55:19.200
 Like, yeah, like I've recently been working with just almost as a fun side thing with vision

55:19.200 --> 55:25.680
 scientists and peripheral vision. It's a beautiful complex mess, that whole thing.

55:25.680 --> 55:30.800
 We still don't understand all the weird ways that human perception works, and they were probably

55:31.440 --> 55:38.000
 terrible at it. They probably didn't even have any conceptual peripheral vision or the fovea or

55:38.000 --> 55:44.880
 I mean, basically anything. They had some, I mean, because actually it was Newton himself

55:44.880 --> 55:51.840
 who probed a lot of this. For instance, Newton, the young Newton, trying to work his way around

55:51.840 --> 55:58.240
 what's going on with colors, wanted to try and distinguish colors that occur through

55:58.240 --> 56:04.480
 natural processes out there, and colors that are a result of our eyes not operating rights.

56:04.480 --> 56:11.040
 You know what he did? It's a famous thing. He took a stick, and he stuck that stick under

56:11.040 --> 56:19.040
 his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball, and what that did would produce colored circles

56:19.920 --> 56:24.960
 at diametrically opposite positions of the stick in the eyeball, and he moved it around to see

56:24.960 --> 56:32.160
 how they moved, trying to distinguish. Legit. Right? I always have to tell my students, don't do this,

56:32.160 --> 56:40.880
 but... Or do it if you want to be great and remembered by human history. There's a lot

56:40.880 --> 56:47.520
 of equivalent to sticking to your eye in modern day that may pay off in the end. Okay.

56:51.360 --> 56:55.280
 As a small aside, is the Newton and the Apple story true? No.

56:55.280 --> 57:04.080
 No. Was it a different fruit? As a colleague of mine named Simon Schaffer in England

57:04.640 --> 57:11.360
 once said on a NOVA program that we were both on, the role of fruit in the history of science has

57:11.360 --> 57:19.840
 been vastly exaggerated. Okay. So was there any, I mean, to zoom out, moments of epiphany?

57:19.840 --> 57:26.880
 Is there something to moments of epiphany? Again, this is the paradigm shift versus the

57:26.880 --> 57:33.040
 gradualism. There is a shift. It's a much more complex one than that, and we...

57:36.160 --> 57:41.440
 As it happens, a colleague of mine and I are writing a paper right now on one of the aspects

57:41.440 --> 57:49.840
 of these things based on the work that many of our colleagues have done over the last 30 and 40 years.

57:49.840 --> 57:58.400
 Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way. Newton, until the early 1670s,

58:00.320 --> 58:06.880
 and probably really until a fair time after that, first of all, was not very interested in

58:06.880 --> 58:13.600
 questions of motion. He was working actually in all chemical relationships, or what is called

58:13.600 --> 58:20.480
 by historians, chymistry, a kind of early modern chemical structure. Colleagues of ours at Indiana

58:20.480 --> 58:29.760
 have even reproduced the amalgams that... Anyway, his way of thinking about motion involved a certain

58:29.760 --> 58:40.960
 set of relationships, which was not conducive to any application that would yield

58:42.080 --> 58:48.320
 computationally direct results for things like planetary motions, which he wasn't terribly

58:48.320 --> 58:58.640
 interested in anyway. He enters a correspondence with his original nemesis, Robert Hook, and

58:58.640 --> 59:03.040
 Hook says, well, have you ever thought about, and then Hook tells him a certain way you might

59:03.040 --> 59:10.560
 think about it, and when Newton hears that, he recognizes that there is a way to inject time

59:10.560 --> 59:17.280
 that would enable him to solve certain problems. It's not that he... That there was anything he

59:17.280 --> 59:23.280
 thought before that was contrary to that way of thinking. It's just that that particular

59:23.280 --> 59:32.480
 technical insight was not something that, for a lot of reasons that are complex, had never occurred to

59:32.480 --> 59:38.960
 him at all, and that sent him a different way of thinking. But to answer your question about the

59:38.960 --> 59:46.080
 Apple business, which is always about gravity and the moon and all of that being... No. The

59:46.080 --> 59:54.960
 reason there is that the idea that what goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth and what goes

59:54.960 --> 1:00:03.360
 on at the moon, let us say, remind the sun and the planets, can be due to a direct relationship

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:13.520
 between the earth, let's say, and the moon is contrary to fundamental beliefs held by many of

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.640
 the mechanical philosophers, as they're called at the time, in which everything has to involve

1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:23.280
 at least a sequence of direct contacts. It has to be something between here and there

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:33.440
 that's involved. And Hook, probably not thinking terribly deeply about it based on what he said,

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:37.200
 along with others like the architect and mathematician Christopher Wren,

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:44.240
 a harken back to the notion that, well, maybe there is a kind of magnetic relationship between the

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.600
 moon and maybe the planets and the earth and gravity and so on, vague, but establishing a

1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:56.240
 direct connection somehow, however it's happening, forget about it. Newton wouldn't have cared about

1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:01.440
 that, if that's all they said, but it was when Hook mentioned this different way of thinking about

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:08.560
 the motion, a way he could certainly have thought of because it does not contradict anything. Newton

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:15.440
 is a brilliant mathematician and he could see that you could suddenly start to do things with that,

1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:21.360
 that you otherwise wouldn't connect. And this led eventually to another controversy with Hook,

1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:27.040
 in which Hook said, well, after Newton published his great Principia, I gave him how to do this.

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:32.320
 And then Newton, of course, got ticked off about that and said, well, listen to this, I did everything

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:36.320
 and because he had a Picayune little idea, he thinks he can take credit for it.

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:44.480
 Okay. So his ability to play with these ideas mathematically is what solidified the initial

1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:48.800
 intuition that you could have, was that the first time he was born the idea that you have

1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:55.280
 action at a distance, that you can have forces without contact, which is another revolutionary

1:01:55.280 --> 1:02:07.680
 idea. I would say that in the sense of dealing with the mechanics of force like effects,

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:18.000
 considered to act at some distance, it is novel with both Hook and Newton at the time,

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.280
 the notion that two things might interact at a distance with one another without direct contact,

1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:28.720
 that goes back to antiquity. Only there it would thought of more as a sympathetic reaction

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:36.480
 to a magnet and a piece of iron. They have a kind of mutual sympathy for one another.

1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:42.000
 Like what, love? What are we talking about? Well, actually, they do sometimes talk like that.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:50.400
 That is love. See, now I talk like that all the time. I think love is somehow in consciousness

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:59.120
 or forces of physics that yet to be discovered. Okay. Now there's the other side of things,

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:04.320
 which is calculus that you began to talk about. So Newton brought a lot of things to this world.

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:13.120
 One of them is calculus. What is calculus? And what was Newton's role in bringing it

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.720
 to life? What was it like? What was the story of bringing calculus to this world?

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:27.680
 Well, since the publication starting many decades ago by Tom Whiteside, who's now deceased of

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:33.520
 Newton's mathematical papers, we know a lot about how he was pushing things and how he was

1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:40.880
 developing things. It's a complex question to say what calculus is. Calculus is the set of

1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:48.960
 mathematical techniques that enable you to investigate what we now call functions, mathematical

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:57.360
 functions, which are continuous. That is, that are not formed out of discrete sets like the

1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:10.960
 counting numbers, for instance. Newton, there were already procedures for solving problems

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:18.560
 involving such things as finding areas to under curves and tangents to curves by using

1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:28.960
 geometrical structures, but only for certain limited types of curves, if you will. Newton as

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:39.920
 a young man, we know this is what happened, is looking at a formula which involves an expansion

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:47.200
 in separate terms, polynomial terms, as we say, for certain functions. I know I don't want to get

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:54.960
 complicated here about this, but he realizes it could be generalized and he tries the generalization

1:04:54.960 --> 1:05:03.600
 and that leads him to an expansion formula called the binomial theorem. That enables him to move

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:10.560
 ahead with the notion that if I take something that has a certain value and I add a little bit

1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:17.760
 to it and I use this binomial theorem and expand things out, I can begin to do new things. The

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:24.720
 new things that he begins to do leads him to a recognition that the calculations of areas

1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:33.760
 and the calculations of tangents to curves are reciprocal to one another. The procedures that

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:43.680
 he develops is a particular form of the calculus in which he considers small increments and then

1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:52.640
 continuous flows and changes of curves and so on. We have relics of it in physics today,

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:59.280
 the notation in which you put a dot over a variable indicating the rate of change of the

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:12.960
 variable. That's Newton's original type of notation. Possibly independently of Newton

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:19.120
 because he didn't publish this thing, although he became quite well known as quite a brilliant

1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:30.240
 young man in part because people heard about his work and so on. When another young man by the

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:38.240
 name of Gottfried Leibniz visited London and he heard about these things, it is said that he

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:45.200
 independently develops his form of the calculus, which is actually the form we use today,

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:51.600
 both in notation and perhaps in certain fundamental ways of thinking. It has remained a

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:59.040
 controversial point as to where exactly and how much independently Leibniz did it. Leibniz

1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:04.720
 aficionados think and continue to maintain. He did it completely independently. Newton,

1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:10.560
 when he became president of the Royal Society, put together a group to go on the attack saying,

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:19.520
 no, he must have taken everything. We don't know, but I will tell you this. About 25 or so years ago,

1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:29.840
 a scholar who's a professor at Indiana now named Domenico Melly got his hands on a Leibniz manuscript

1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:36.800
 called the Ten Taman, which was Leibniz's attempt to produce an alternative to Newton's mechanics.

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:43.360
 It comes to some conclusions that you have in the Newton's mechanics. Well, he published that,

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:49.680
 but Melly got the manuscript. What Melly found out was that Leibniz reverse engineered the

1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:55.040
 Principia and cooked it backwards so that he could get the results he wanted.

1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:59.520
 That was for the mechanics. That means his mind allows for that kind of thing.

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:07.840
 You're breaking some use today. Some people think so. I think most historians of mathematics

1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:14.080
 do not agree with that. A friend of mine, a rather well known physicist, unfortunately,

1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:20.640
 died a couple of years ago named Mike Nowenberg at UC Santa Cruz, had some evidence along those

1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:26.720
 lines. Didn't pass mustard with many of my friends who are historians of math. In fact,

1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:32.640
 I edit with a historian of math, a technical journal, and we were unable to publish it in

1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:39.680
 there because we couldn't get it through any of our colleagues, but I remain suspicious.

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.440
 What is it about those tense relationships and that kind of drama? Einstein doesn't appear to

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:54.080
 have much of that drama. Nobody claims, I haven't heard claims that they've, perhaps because it's

1:08:54.080 --> 1:09:04.000
 such crazy ideas of any of his major inventions, major ideas being those that are, basically,

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:09.680
 I came up with it first or independently. There's not, as far as I'm aware, not many people talk

1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:15.200
 about general relativity, especially in those terms, but with Newton that was the case.

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:23.200
 Is that just a natural algorithm of how science works? Is there going to be personalities that,

1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:29.280
 I'm not saying this about Linus, but maybe I am, that there's people who steal ideas for the,

1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:35.120
 because of ego, because of all those kinds of things?

1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:42.480
 I don't think it's all that common, frankly. The Newton hook, Leibniz, Contratomps, and so on.

1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:48.960
 Well, you're at the beginnings of a lot of things there and so on. These are difficult and complex

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:58.640
 times as well. These are times in which science as an activity pursued by other than, let us say,

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:06.960
 interested aristocrats is becoming somewhat different. It's not a professional community

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:17.680
 of investigators in the same way. It's also a period in which procedures and rules are

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:24.400
 practiced or being developed to avoid attacking one another directly and pulling out a sword to

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:30.880
 cut off the other guy's head if he disagrees with you and so on. There's a very different period.

1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:36.000
 Controversies happen. People get angry. I can think of a number of others,

1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:43.280
 including in the development of optics in the 19th century and so on. It can get hot under the collar.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:50.960
 Sometimes one character who's worked an area extensively, whether they've come up with

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:58.320
 something terribly novel or not, and somebody else moves in and does completely different

1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:05.040
 novel things. The first guy gets upset about it because he's muscled into what I thought was my

1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:11.040
 area. You find that sort of stuff. Do you have examples of cases where it worked out well,

1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:14.720
 like that competition is good for the progress of science?

1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:17.280
 Yeah. It almost always is good in that sense.

1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:20.000
 It's just painful for the individuals involved.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.800
 It can be. It doesn't have to be nasty, although sometimes it is.

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:28.640
 So on the space, for example, with optics, could you comment on that one?

1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:32.320
 Well, yeah, sure. There are several, but I could give you...

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:40.320
 All right. So I'll give you this example that probably is the most pertinent.

1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:50.880
 The first polytechnic school, like MIT or Caltech, was actually founded in France during

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:54.640
 the French Revolution. It exists today. It's the egg called polytechnique.

1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:05.200
 All right. Two people who were there were two young men in the 90s, 1790s, named,

1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:11.440
 on the one hand, François Aragot and the other Jean Baptiste Biot. They both lived a long time,

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:19.680
 well into the 1850s. Aragot became a major administrator of science, and Biot's career

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:28.160
 started to peter out after about the late teens. Now, they are sent on an expedition,

1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:33.680
 which was one of the expeditions involving measuring things to start the metric system.

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:39.200
 There's a lot more to that story. Anyway, they come back. Aragot gets separated.

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:51.360
 He's captured by pirates, actually. Wounds up in Tangier, escapes, is captured again.

1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:57.120
 Everybody thinks he's dead. He gets back to Paris, and so on. He's greeted as a hero,

1:12:57.120 --> 1:13:01.680
 and whatnot. In the meantime, Biot has pretty much published some of the stuff that he's done.

1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:06.080
 An Aragot doesn't get much credit for it. An Aragot starts to get very angry.

1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:11.600
 Biot is known for this kind of thing. Aragot, anyway,

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:20.560
 Biot starts investigating a new phenomenon and optics involving something called polarization,

1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:29.440
 and he writes all kinds of stuff on it. Aragot looks into this and decides to write some things

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:35.440
 as well. And actually, Biot gets mostly interested in it when he finds out that Aragot is doing stuff.

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:42.880
 Now, Biot is actually the better scientist in a lot of ways, but Aragot is furious about this.

1:13:43.440 --> 1:13:50.000
 So furious that he actually demands and forces the leader of French science, Laplace,

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:59.280
 the Marquis de la Place, and cohorts to write a note in the published journal saying,

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:08.720
 oh, excuse us. Actually, Aragot, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah. So Aragot continues

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:16.080
 to just hold this antipathy and fear of Biot. So what happens? 1815,

1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:24.240
 Napoleon is finished at Waterloo. A young Frenchman by the name of Augustin Fresnel

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:31.440
 was in the army, is going back to his home on the north coast of France in Normandy. He passes

1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:39.600
 through Paris. Aragot is friends with Fresnel's uncle, who's the head of the École des Beaux

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:46.880
 at the time. Anyway, Fresnel is already interested in certain things in light. And he talks to Aragot.

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:53.040
 Aragot tells him a few things. Fresnel goes home, and Fresnel is a brilliant experimenter.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:00.480
 He observes things, and he's a very good mathematician, calculates things. He writes

1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:05.520
 something up. He sends it to Aragot. Aragot looks at it, and Aragot says to himself,

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:14.080
 I can use this to get back at Beaux. He brings Fresnel to Paris, sets him up in a room at the

1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:20.240
 observatory where Aragot is for Fresnel to continue his work paper after paper comes out,

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:25.520
 undercutting everything Beaux had done.

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:33.600
 What is it about jealousy and just envy that could be an engine of creativity

1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:42.160
 and productivity versus an Einstein where it seems like not? I don't know which one is better.

1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:45.440
 I guess it depends on the personality. Both are useful engines in science.

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:52.400
 Well, in this particular story, it's maybe even more interesting because Fresnel himself,

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:59.840
 the young guy, he knew what Aragot was doing with him, and he didn't like it. He wrote his

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:06.000
 brother said, I don't want to get an argument with Beaux. I just want to do my stuff. Aragot

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:13.200
 is using him, but it's because Aragot kept pushing him to go into certain areas that stuff kept coming

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:24.720
 out. Ego is beautiful. Back to Newton. There's a bunch of things I want to ask, but let's say

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:30.320
 since we're on the Leibniz and the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question. Why was

1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:39.920
 Newton a complicated man? We're breaking news today. This is like... Right. Why was it complicated?

1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:47.120
 His brain structure was different. I don't know why. He had a complicated young life, as we've said.

1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:56.800
 He had always been very self contained and solitary. He had acquaintances and friends,

1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:02.640
 and when he moved to London eventually, he had quite a career. A career, for instance,

1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:09.120
 that led him when he was famous by then, the 1690s. He moves to London. He becomes first

1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:15.840
 warden of the Mint. The Mint is what produces coins, and coinage was a complicated thing because

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:23.600
 there was counterfeiting going on. He becomes master of the Mint to the extent. A guy at MIT

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:28.400
 wrote a book about this a little bit. We wrote something on it too. I forget his name was Levin.

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:35.760
 That Newton sent investigators out to catch these guys and sent at least one of them,

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:45.040
 a famous one named Chalender, to the gallows. One of the reasons he probably was so

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:51.520
 particularly angry at Chalender was Chalender had apparently said some nasty things about Newton

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:57.520
 in front of Parliament at some point. Fair enough. Yeah. That was apparently not a good idea.

1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:01.280
 Well, he had a bit of a temper, so he didn't have a bit of a temper. Clearly. Okay. Clearly.

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:10.560
 But he, even as a young man at Cambridge, though he doesn't come from wealth, he attracts

1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:17.200
 people who recognize his smarts. There's a young fellow named Humphrey Newton.

1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:21.840
 Shared his rooms. You know, these students always shared rooms with one another.

1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:29.760
 Became his kind of eminuences to write down what Newton was doing and so on.

1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:38.400
 And there were others over time who he befriended in various ways and so on. He was solitary.

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:44.240
 He had, as far as we know, no relationships with either women or men

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:51.360
 in anything other than a formal way. Those get in the way relationships.

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:57.120
 Right. Well, I mean, he was, I don't know if he was close to his mother. I mean,

1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:03.520
 she passed away. Everything left him. He went to be with her after she died. He was close to

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:08.400
 his niece, Catherine Barton, who basically came to run his household

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:17.680
 when he moved to London and so on. And she married a man named Conduit, who became one of the

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:27.280
 people who controlled Newton's legacy later on and so on. And you can even see the house that

1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:30.400
 the townhouse that Newton lived in in those days still there.

1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:37.200
 All right. So there's the story of Newton coming up with quite a few ideas during a pandemic.

1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:43.040
 We're on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves. Right.

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:48.400
 And a lot of people use that example as motivation for everybody while they're in lockdown to get

1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:52.560
 stuff done. So what's that about? Can you tell the story of that?

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:58.080
 Well, I can. Let me first say that, of course, we've been teaching over Zoom lately.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:02.480
 There was no Zoom back then? There was no Zoom back then. Although,

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:05.920
 it wouldn't have made much difference because the story was Newton was so complicated in his

1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:10.800
 lectures that at one point, Humphrey Newton actually said that he might as well have just

1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:16.240
 been lecturing to the walls because nobody was there to listen to it. So what difference, but...

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:22.960
 Also not a great teacher, huh? If you look at his optical notes, if that's what he's reading from...

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:32.240
 Oh, boy. Okay. No. So what can you say about that whole journey through the pandemic

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:37.440
 that resulted in so much innovation in such a short amount of time?

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:44.560
 Well, I mean, there's two times that he goes home. Would he have been able to do it and do

1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:49.680
 do it if he'd stayed at Cambridge? I think he would have. I don't think it really...

1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:54.160
 Although, I do like to tell my advanced students when I lecture on the history of physics to the

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:59.040
 physics and chemistry students, especially we've been doing it over Zoom the last year,

1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:05.040
 when we get to Newton and so on because these kids are 21, 22. I like to say, well, you know,

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:11.200
 when Newton was your age and he had to go home during an epidemic, do you know what he produced?

1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:16.320
 So can you actually summarize this for people who don't know how old was Newton and what did

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:23.520
 he produce? Well, Newton goes up to Cambridge, as it said, when he's 18 years old, in the 1660.

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:32.400
 And the so called miraculous year, the Annus Mirabilis, where you get the development in

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:42.560
 the calculus and in optical discoveries especially, is 1666. Right? So he's what, 24 years old at the

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:49.840
 time, but judging from his, the notebooks that I mentioned, he's already, before that, come to

1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:58.160
 an awful lot of developments over the previous couple of years. Doesn't have much to do with

1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:05.200
 the fact that he twice went home. It is true that the optical experiments that we talked of a while

1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:10.480
 ago with the light on the wall moving up and down, were done at home. In fact, you can visit the

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:16.800
 very room he did it in to this day. Yeah, it's very cool. And if you look through the window

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:22.640
 in that room, there is an apple tree out there in the garden. So you might be wrong about this.

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:28.400
 You're lying to me. Maybe there's an apple involved after all. Well, it's not the same

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:34.640
 apple tree, but it's cuttings. How do you know? They don't last that long, but it's 400 years ago.

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:42.240
 Oh, not this. Oh, wow. I continue with the dumbest questions. Okay. So you're saying that perhaps

1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:49.440
 going home was not... It may have given him an opportunity to work things through. And after

1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:54.240
 all, he did make use of that room and he could do things like put a, you know, a shade over the

1:22:54.240 --> 1:23:00.560
 window, move things around, cut holes in it and do stuff. Probably in his rooms at Cambridge,

1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:07.200
 he maybe not, although when he stayed at Cambridge, subsequently, he became a fellow.

1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:13.120
 And then the first, actually the second Lucasian professor there, he was actually really the

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:19.840
 first one because Isaac Barrow, who was the mathematician, professor of optics, recognized

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:25.520
 Newton's genius, gave up what would have been his position because he recognized,

1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:32.400
 not, Newton may not have learned too much from him, although they did interact. And so Newton was

1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:39.360
 the first Lucasian professor, really, the one that Stephen Hawking held till he died. And we know

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:46.240
 that the rooms that he had there at Cambridge, subsequently, because rooms are still there,

1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:50.160
 he built an all chemical furnace outside, did all sorts of stuff in those rooms.

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:58.160
 And don't forget, you didn't have to do too much as a Lucasian professor. Every so often,

1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:03.200
 you had to go give these lectures, whether anybody was there or not, and deposit the notes

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:08.320
 for the future, which is how we have all those things.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.280
 Oh, they were stored and now we have them and now we know just how terrible of a teacher Newton

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:20.560
 was. Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are. In fact, the second volume of Newton's

1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:26.720
 of the notes, really, on the great book that he published, The Optics, which he published in

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:34.880
 1704, that has just been finished with full annotations and analysis by the greatest

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:40.560
 analyst of Newton's optics, Alan Shapiro, who retired a few years ago at the University of

1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:46.800
 Minnesota and been working on Newton's optics ever since I knew him and before, and I've known him

1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:56.080
 since 1976. Is there something you could say broadly about either that work on optics or

1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:04.960
 print KPA itself as something that I've never actually looked at as a piece of work? Is it

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:12.800
 powerful in itself or is it just an important moment in history in terms of the amount of

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:19.520
 inventions that are within, the amount of ideas that are within, or is it a really powerful work

1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:28.000
 in itself? Well, it is a powerful work in itself. You can see this guy coming to grips with and

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:34.880
 pushing through and working his way around complicated and difficult issues, melding

1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:42.400
 experimental situations which nobody had worked with before, even discovering new things,

1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.320
 trying to figure out ways of putting this together with mathematical structures,

1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.720
 succeeding and failing at the same time, and we can see him doing that.

1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:58.960
 I mean, what is contained within print KPA? I don't even know in terms of the scope

1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:04.240
 of the work. All right. Is it the entirety of the body of work of Newton?

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:07.440
 No, no, no, no. The print KPA Mathematica. Is it calculus?

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:14.800
 Well, all right. So the print KPA is divided into three books.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:23.440
 Excellent. Book one contains his version of the laws of motion and the application of those laws

1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:30.320
 to figure out when a body moves in certain curves and is forced to move in those curves

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:37.680
 by forces directed to certain fixed points, what is the nature of the mathematical formula

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:44.560
 for those forces? That's all that book one is about, and it contains not the kind of version of the

1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:53.040
 calculus that uses algebra of the sort that I was trying to explain before, but is done in terms of

1:26:54.720 --> 1:27:02.000
 ratios between geometric line segments when one of the line segments goes very, very small.

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.800
 It's called the kind of limiting procedure, which is calculus, but it's a geometrically structured,

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:15.600
 although it's clearly got algebraic elements in it as well. And that makes the print KPA's

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:23.040
 mathematical structure rather hard for people who aren't studying it today to go back to.

1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:34.000
 Book two contains his work on what we now call hydrostatics and a little bit about hydrodynamics,

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:41.680
 hydrodynamics, a fuller development of the concept of pressure, which is a complicated concept.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:50.320
 And book three applies what he did in book one to the solar system. And it is successful

1:27:50.320 --> 1:28:00.000
 partially, because the only way that you can exactly solve, the only types of problems you

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:08.400
 can exactly solve in terms of the interactions of two particles governed by gravitational force

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:15.520
 between them is for only two bodies. If there's more than two, let's say it's A, B, and C,

1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:24.160
 A acts on B, B acts on C, C acts on A, you cannot solve it exactly. You have to develop techniques.

1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:29.840
 The fullest sets of techniques are really only developed about 30 or 40 years after Newton's

1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:39.360
 death by French mathematicians like Laplace. Newton tried to apply his structure to the

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:46.160
 sun, earth, moon, because the moon's motion is very complicated. The moon, for instance,

1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:53.520
 exactly repeats its observable position among the stars only every 19 years.

1:28:55.040 --> 1:29:01.200
 That is, if you look up where the moon is among the stars at certain times and it changes,

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:07.360
 it's complicated. That's, by the way, that was discovered by the Babylonians.

1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:10.080
 That fact in 19 years.

1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:11.600
 That was a few years ago, yes.

1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:14.960
 And then you have to develop a piece of data and how do you make sense of it?

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:17.120
 Let me know. That is data and you have to fit in.

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:23.520
 And it's complicated. So Newton actually kind of reverse engineered a technique that had been

1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:30.000
 developed by a man named Horrocks using certain laws of Kepler's to try and get around this thing.

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:36.560
 And Newton then sort of, my understanding, I've never studied this, has reversed it

1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:40.960
 and fit it together with his force calculations by way of an approximation.

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.720
 And was able to construct a model to make some predictions?

1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:51.360
 It fit things backwards pretty well.

1:29:53.440 --> 1:29:58.800
 Okay. Where does data fit into this? We kind of earlier in the discussion

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:08.080
 mentioned data as part of the scientific method. How important was data to Newton?

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:14.400
 So like you mentioned Prisman playing with it and looking at stuff and then coming up

1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:18.160
 with calculations and so on. Where does data fit into any of his ideas?

1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:24.720
 All right. Well, let me say two things first. One, we rarely use the phrase scientific method

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:33.200
 anymore because there is no one easily describable such method. I mean, humans have been playing

1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:38.080
 around with the world and learning how to repetitively do things and make things happen

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:45.040
 ever since humans became humans. Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method?

1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:49.200
 What are the various? No, I don't. I prefer to talk about

1:30:49.200 --> 1:31:01.120
 the considered manipulation of artificial structures to produce results that can be

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:08.160
 worked together with schemes to construct other devices and make

1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:13.840
 predictions, if you will, about the way such things will work.

1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:19.040
 So ultimately, it's about producing other devices. It's like leads you down a...

1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:26.720
 I think so, principally. I mean, you may have data, if you will, like astronomical data obtained

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:33.440
 otherwise and so on, but yes. But number two here is this question of data. What is data?

1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:41.680
 In that sense, see, when we talk about data today, we have a kind of complex notion which

1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:50.960
 reverts to even issues of statistics and measurement procedures and so on. So let me put it to you

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:58.400
 this way. So let's say I had a ruler in front of me. Go on. And it's marked off in little black marks

1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:05.440
 separated by, let's say, distances called a millimeter. Now, I make a mark on this piece

1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:12.720
 of paper here. So I made a nice black mark, right? Nice black mark. And I ask you, I want you to

1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:18.480
 measure that and tell me how long it is. You're going to take the ruler, you're going to put it

1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:26.480
 next to it, and you're going to look. And it's not going to sit, even if you put one in as close as

1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:31.840
 you can on one black mark, the other end probably isn't going to be exactly on a black mark. Well,

1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:36.960
 you'll say it's closer to this or that. You'll write down a number. And I say, okay, take the ruler

1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:42.000
 away a minute. I take this away, come back in five minutes, put the piece of paper down, do it again.

1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:47.280
 You're going to probably come up with a different number. And you're going to do that a lot of times.

1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:53.040
 And then if I tell you, I want you to give me your best estimate of what the actual length of that

1:32:53.040 --> 1:33:02.800
 thing is, what are you going to do? You're going to average all of these numbers? Why?

1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:12.720
 Statistics. Well, yes, statistics. There's lots of ways of going around it. But the average is the

1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:18.640
 best estimate on the basis of what's called the central limit theorem, a statistical theorem.

1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:25.280
 We're talking about things that were not really developed until the 1750s, 60s, and 70s. Newton

1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:31.440
 died in 1727. The intuition perhaps was there. Not really. I'll tell you what people did,

1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:36.880
 including Newton, although Newton is partially the one exception. We talked a while ago about

1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:43.920
 this guy, Christian Huygens. He measured lots of things. And he was a good mechanic himself.

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:49.520
 He and his brother ground lenses. Huygens, I told you, developed the first pendulum mechanism,

1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:56.560
 pendulum driven clock with a mechanism and so on. Also a spring watch, where he got into a

1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:02.720
 controversy with Hook over that, by the way. What's with these mechanics and the controversy?

1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:12.880
 Well, we also have Huygens's notes. They're preserved at Leiden University in Holland.

1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:18.960
 He's Dutch for his work in optics, which was extensive. We don't have time to go into that,

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.320
 except the following. A number of years ago, I went through those things, because in this

1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:31.760
 optical theory that he had, there are four numbers that you've got to be able to get good numbers on

1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:38.160
 to be able to predict other things. So what would we do today? What in fact was done at the end of

1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:42.800
 the 18th century, when somebody went back to this? You do what you just, I told you to do with the

1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:48.880
 ruler. You make a lot of measurements and average results. We have Huygens's notes. He did make

1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:56.880
 a lot of measurements, one after the other after the other. But when he came to use the numbers

1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:04.000
 for calculations, and indeed when he published things at the end of his life, he gives you one

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:10.720
 number, and it's not the average of any of them. It's just one of them. Which one was it? The one

1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:20.560
 that he thought he got so good at working by practice that he put down the one he was most

1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:28.320
 confident in. That was the general procedure at the time. You wouldn't publish a paper in which you

1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:33.600
 wrote down six numbers and said, well, I measured this six times. Let me put them together.

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:39.360
 None of them is really, they would have said the right number, but I'll put them together

1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:44.240
 and give you a good number. No, you would have been thought of that. You don't know what you're

1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:54.640
 doing. Yeah. By the way, there's just an inkling of value to that approach. Just an inkling. We

1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:59.920
 sometimes use statistics as like a thing that like, oh, that solves all the problems. We'll

1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:04.560
 just do a lot of it and we'll take the average or whatever it is as many excellent books on

1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:12.560
 mathematics have highlighted the flaws in our approach to certain sciences that rely heavily

1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:20.960
 on statistics. Let me ask you again for a friend about this alchemy thing. It'd be nice to create

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:26.640
 gold, but it also seems to come into play quite a bit throughout the history of science,

1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:33.360
 perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact. Can you say something to the history of alchemy?

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:44.640
 A little bit. Sure. It used to be thought two things. One, that alchemy, which dates certainly

1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:53.760
 back to the Islamic period in Islam, you're talking 11th, 12th, 13th centuries among Islamic

1:36:53.760 --> 1:37:00.880
 natural philosophers and experimenters, but it used to be thought that alchemy, which picked up

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:09.680
 strikingly in the 15th, 16th century, 1500s and thereabouts, was a sort of mystical procedure

1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:16.880
 involving all sorts of strange notions and so on. That's not entirely untrue,

1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:25.840
 but it is substantially untrue in that all chemists were engaged in what was known as

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:35.520
 Chrisl Poyer. That is looking for ways to transform invaluable materials into valuable ones,

1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:46.480
 but in the process of doing so or attempting to do so, they learned how to create complex

1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:54.880
 amalgams of various kinds. They used very elaborate apparatus, glass olympics in which they would

1:37:54.880 --> 1:38:02.080
 use heat to produce chemical decompositions. They would write down and observe these compositions

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:07.760
 and many of the so called really strange looking alchemical formulas and statements where they'll

1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:14.640
 say something like, I can't produce it, but it'll be built. The soul of Mars will combine with the

1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:24.240
 this, etc., etc. It has been shown are almost all actual formulas for how to engage in the

1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:32.880
 production of complex amalgams and what to do. By the time of Newton, Newton was reading the works

1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:41.520
 of a fellow by the name of Starkey, who actually came from Harvard shortly before,

1:38:42.800 --> 1:38:49.680
 in which things had progressed, if you will, to the point where the procedure turns into what

1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:57.120
 historians call Chrisl Poyer, which basically runs into the notion of thinking that these

1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:04.480
 things are made out of particles. This is the mechanical philosophy. Can we engage in processes,

1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:10.960
 chemical processes, to rearrange these things, which is not so stupid after all. We do it,

1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:16.480
 except we happen to do it in reactors, not in chemical processes, unless, of course,

1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:19.200
 it had happened that cold fusion had worked, which it didn't.

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:28.560
 That's the way they're thinking about these things. There's a kind of mix. Newton engages

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:36.320
 extensively in those sorts of manipulations. In fact, more in that than almost anything else,

1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:44.320
 except for his optical investigations, if you look through the latter parts of the 1670s,

1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:50.800
 the last five, six, seven years or so of that, there's more on that than there is on anything

1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:56.560
 else. He's not working on mechanics. He's pretty much gone pretty far in optics. He'll turn back

1:39:56.560 --> 1:40:03.600
 to optics later on. Optics and alchemy. What you're saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things.

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:11.680
 Actually, if you go online and look at what Bill Newman, the professor at Bloomington,

1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:17.440
 Indiana has produced, you'll find the very shiny thing called the Star Regulus, which

1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:22.640
 Newton describes as having produced according to a particular way, which Newman figured out and

1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:30.160
 was able to do it. It's very shiny. There you go. Proves the theorem. Can I ask you about God,

1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:42.640
 religion, and its role in Newton's life? Was there helpful, constructive, or destructive

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:50.000
 influences of religion in his work and in his life? Well, there you begin to touch on a complex

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:58.080
 question. The role that God played would be an interesting question to answer. Should one go

1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:02.800
 and be able to speak with this invisible character who doesn't exist, but putting that aside for

1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:06.240
 the moment? Yeah, we don't like to talk about others while they're not here.

1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:13.680
 Newton is a deeply religious man, not unusually so, of course, with assignment.

1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:27.680
 Clearly, his upbringing and perhaps his early experiences have exacerbated that in a number

1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:35.520
 of ways, that he takes a lot of things personally, and he finds perhaps solace in thinking about

1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:47.680
 a sort of governing, abstract, rulemaking, exacting deity. I think there is little question

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:59.520
 that his conviction that you can figure things out has a fair bit to do with his

1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:08.320
 profound belief that this rulemaker doesn't do things arbitrarily. Newton does not think that

1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:16.000
 miracles have happened since maybe the time of Christ, if then, and not in the same way. He was,

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:21.360
 for instance, an anti Trinitarian. He did not hold that Christ had a divine being,

1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:32.560
 but was rather endowed with certain powers by the rulemaker and whatnot. He did not think that some

1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:40.320
 of the tales of the Old Testament with various miracles and so on occurred in anything like that

1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:46.400
 way. Some may have, some may not have. Like everybody else, of course, he did think that creation

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:54.400
 had happened about 6,000 years ago. Wait, really? Oh, yeah, sure. Well, biblical chronology can give

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.760
 you a little bit about that. It's a little controversial, but sure. Interesting. Wow.

1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:09.200
 The deity created the universe 6,000 years ago. That didn't interfere with his playing around with

1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:13.760
 the sun and the moon and the network. Oh, no, because he's figuring out, he's watching

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:22.640
 the brilliant construction that this perfect entity did 6,000 years ago. Yeah, has produced.

1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:27.760
 Buster minus a few years. Well, if you go with Bishop Buster, it's 4,004 BCE.

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:36.160
 Want to be precise about it. We always, this is a serious program. We always want to be precise.

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:44.480
 Okay, let me ask another ridiculous question. If Newton were to travel forward in time

1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:55.040
 and visit with Einstein and have a discussion about space time and general relativity, that

1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:01.360
 conception of time and that conception of gravity, what do you think that discussion will go like?

1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:07.120
 Put that way, I think Newton would sit there and shock and say, I have no idea what you're

1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:13.440
 talking about. If, on the other hand, there's a time machine, you go back and bring a somewhat

1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:21.600
 younger Newton, not a man my age, say. I mean, he lived a long time into his mid 80s,

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:27.680
 but take him when he's in his 40s, let's say. Bring him forward and don't immediately introduce

1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:34.160
 him to Einstein. Let's take him for a ride on a railroad. Let him experience the railroad.

1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:45.920
 Oh, that's right. Take him around and show him a sparking machine. He knows about sparks,

1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:52.320
 sending off sparks. Show him wires, have him touch the wires and get a little shock.

1:44:52.320 --> 1:45:01.600
 Show him a clicking telegraph machine of the kind. Then let him hear the clicks in a telephone

1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.200
 receiver and so on. Do that for a couple of months. Let him get accustomed to things.

1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:14.960
 Then take him into, not Einstein yet, let's say we're taking him into the 1890s. Einstein is a

1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:21.040
 young man then. We take him into some of the laboratories. We show him some of the equipment,

1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.880
 the devices, not the most elaborate ones. We show him certain things. We educate him

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:33.680
 bit by bit. The optics, maybe focus on that. Certainly on optics. You begin to show him things.

1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:40.640
 He's a brilliant human being. I think bit by bit, he would begin to see what's going on.

1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.640
 But if you just dumped him in front of Einstein, he'd sit there as eyes would glaze over.

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:57.760
 I mean, I guess it's almost a question of how big of a leap, how many leaps have been taken

1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:02.960
 in science that go from Newton to Einstein? We sometimes in a compressed version of history

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:13.200
 think that not much. Oh, that's totally wrong. A lot. Huge amounts in multifarious ways,

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:19.440
 involving fundamental conceptions, mathematical structures, the evolution of novel experimentation

1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:25.600
 and devices, the organization. It's not everything. Everything. I mean, to a point where I wonder,

1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:35.120
 even if Newton was like, you said 40, but even like 30, so he's very, like if you would be able

1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:42.160
 to catch up with the conception of everything. I wonder as a scientist, how much you load in from

1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:50.160
 age five about this world in order to be able to conceive of the world of ideas that push

1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:54.160
 that science forward. I mean, you mentioned the railroad and all those kinds of things.

1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:00.640
 That might be fundamental to our ability to invent even when it doesn't directly

1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:12.400
 obviously seem relevant. Well, yes. I mean, the railroad, the steam engine, the watt engine,

1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:17.920
 et cetera. I mean, that was really the watt engine was developed pretty although what

1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:23.760
 knew Joseph Black, a chemist, scientist, and so on, did stuff on heat, was developed pretty

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:34.240
 much independently of the developing thoughts about heat at the time. But what it's not independent of

1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:42.320
 is the evolution of practice in the manufacture and construction of devices,

1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:49.200
 which can do things in extraordinarily novel ways and the premium being gradually placed

1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:56.800
 on calculating how you can make them more efficient. That is of a piece with a way of

1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:03.920
 thinking about the world in which you're controlling things and working. It's something that humans

1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:12.720
 have been doing for a long time, but in this more concerted and structured way, I think you really

1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:21.920
 don't find it in the fullest sense until well into the 1500s and really not fully until the

1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:32.000
 17th century later on. Newton had this year of miracles. I wonder if I could ask you briefly

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:39.840
 about Einstein and his year of miracles. I've been rereading, revisiting the brilliance of

1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:46.240
 the papers that Einstein published in the year 1905, one of which one of the Nobel Prize,

1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:52.880
 the photoelectric effect, but also Brownian motion, special theory of relativity, and of

1:48:52.880 --> 1:49:04.640
 course the old E equals MC squared. Does that make sense to you that these two figures had such

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:12.800
 productive years that there's this moment of genius? Maybe if we zoom out, my work is very

1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:20.960
 much in artificial intelligence, wondering about the nature of intelligence. How did evolution

1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:29.920
 on earth produce genius that could come up with so much in so little time? To me, that gives me hope

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:35.120
 that one person can change the world in such a small amount of time.

1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:44.720
 Well, of course, there are precedents in both Newton's and Einstein's cases for elements of

1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:51.120
 what we're finding there and so on. Well, I have no idea. You know, I'm sure you must have read,

1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:57.760
 it was a kind of a famous story that after Einstein died, he donated his brain and they sliced it up

1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:07.600
 to see if they could find something unusual there, nothing unusual visibly in there. Clearly,

1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:15.680
 there are people who for various reasons, maybe both intrinsic and extrinsic in the sense of

1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:23.680
 experience and so on, are capable of coming up with these extraordinary results. Many years ago,

1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:29.520
 when I was a student, a friend of mine came in and said, did you read about? Did you read this?

1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:37.200
 I forget. Anyway, there was a story in the paper. It was about, I think it was a young woman who

1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:45.680
 was, she couldn't speak and she was somewhere on the autism spectrum. She could not

1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:59.120
 read other people's affect, in any ways, but she could sit down at a piano and having heard it once

1:50:59.120 --> 1:51:10.240
 and then run variations on the most complex, pianistic works of Chopin and others. Right. Now, how?

1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:20.960
 Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in some aspect of reality and become a master of it.

1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:28.160
 And every once in a while, that means coming up with breakthrough ideas in physics. Yep. How

1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:33.680
 the heck does that happen? Who knows? Jed, I'd like to say thank you so much for spending your

1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:37.680
 valuable time with me today. It was a really fascinating conversation. I've learned so much

1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:42.320
 about Isaac Newton, who's one of the most fascinating figures in human history. So thank you so much

1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:47.840
 for talking to me. A pleasure. I enjoyed it very much. Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:53.440
 with Jed Buchwald. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:59.520
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science.

1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:07.200
 The answers you get depend on the questions you ask. Thank you for listening and hope to see you

1:52:07.200 --> 1:52:11.200
 next time.
