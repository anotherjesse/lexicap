00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Codkin, his second time in the podcast.

00:04.760 --> 00:10.480
 Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time, specializing in 20th and 21st

00:10.480 --> 00:15.960
 century history of Russia and Eastern Europe, and he has written what is widely considered

00:15.960 --> 00:22.040
 to be the definitive biography of Stalin in three volumes, two of which have been published,

00:22.040 --> 00:28.200
 and the third focused on World War II and the years after he is in the midst of writing

00:28.200 --> 00:29.840
 now.

00:29.840 --> 00:34.600
 This conversation includes a response to my previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone

00:34.600 --> 00:39.000
 that was focused on Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.280
 Stephen provides a heart hitting criticism of Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

00:44.280 --> 00:50.880
 weighed and contextualized deeply in the complex geopolitics and history of our world, all

00:50.880 --> 00:57.440
 with an intensity and rigor, but also wit and humor that makes Stephen one of my favorite

00:57.440 --> 01:00.760
 human beings.

01:00.760 --> 01:06.200
 Please also allow me to mention something that has been apparent and has weighed heavy

01:06.200 --> 01:09.360
 on my heart and mind.

01:09.360 --> 01:15.560
 This conversation with Stephen Codkin makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Russia.

01:15.560 --> 01:20.560
 The previous conversation with Oliver Stone makes it more dangerous for me to travel

01:20.560 --> 01:22.980
 in Ukraine.

01:22.980 --> 01:27.400
 This makes me sad, but it is the way of the world.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.600
 I will nevertheless travel to both Ukraine and Russia.

01:32.600 --> 01:38.880
 I need to once again see with my own eyes the land of my ancestors, where they suffered

01:38.880 --> 01:46.240
 but flourished and eventually gave birth to silly old me.

01:46.240 --> 01:52.160
 I need to hear directly the pain, anger and hope from both Ukrainians and Russians.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.080
 I won't give details to my travel plans in terms of location and timing, but the trip

01:57.080 --> 01:59.040
 is very soon.

01:59.040 --> 02:05.880
 Whatever happens, I'm truly grateful for every day I'm alive and I hope to spend each such

02:05.880 --> 02:09.280
 day adding a bit of love to the world.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.280
 I love you all.

02:11.280 --> 02:19.640
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and now dear friends, here's Stephen Codkin.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.720
 You are one of the great historians of our time specializing in the man, the leader,

02:24.720 --> 02:26.840
 the historical figure of Stalin.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.800
 So let me ask a challenging question.

02:29.800 --> 02:39.400
 If you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years between Joseph Stalin and Vladimir

02:39.400 --> 02:44.640
 Putin, what are the similarities and differences between the man and the historical figure,

02:44.640 --> 02:48.880
 the historical trajectory of Stalin and Putin?

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
 Thank you, Lex.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.600
 It's very nice to be here again with you.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.200
 It's been a while.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
 Good to see you.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
 Good to see you as well.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
 You're looking good.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
 You as well.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.640
 I see this podcast stuff is doing you right.

03:02.640 --> 03:10.640
 So we can't really put very easily Vladimir Putin in the same sentence with Joseph Stalin.

03:10.640 --> 03:17.040
 Stalin is a singular figure and his category is really small.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.440
 Hitler, Mao, that's really about it.

03:21.440 --> 03:27.360
 And even in that category, Stalin is the dominant figure, both by how long he was in

03:27.360 --> 03:33.080
 power and also by the amount of power, the military industrial complex he helped build

03:33.080 --> 03:35.320
 and commanded.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.960
 So Putin can't be compared to that.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.400
 However, Putin's in the same building as Stalin.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.640
 He uses some of the same offices as Stalin used.

03:46.640 --> 03:53.080
 On some of those television broadcasts that we see of Putin at meetings and Putin inside

03:53.080 --> 03:59.000
 the Kremlin, Stalin used to sit in those rooms and hold meetings in those rooms.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
 That's the Imperial Senate built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building inside

04:05.000 --> 04:06.880
 the Kremlin.

04:06.880 --> 04:13.400
 It's a domed building and you can see it on the panorama, the top of the building, at

04:13.400 --> 04:18.840
 least you can see it on the panorama when you look over the Kremlin wall from many sites

04:18.840 --> 04:21.440
 inside Moscow.

04:21.440 --> 04:28.840
 So if he's not comparable to Stalin, he still works, as I said, in those same buildings,

04:28.840 --> 04:31.840
 those same offices partly.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.720
 And so therefore, he's got some of the problems that Stalin had, which was managing Russian

04:37.720 --> 04:46.160
 power in the world from a position of weakness vis a vis the West, but from an ambition,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.680
 a grandiosity, in fact.

04:49.680 --> 04:58.720
 And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, of not being as strong as the West, but aspiring

04:58.720 --> 05:01.560
 to be as great or greater than the West.

05:01.560 --> 05:06.240
 That's the dilemma of Russian history for the past many centuries.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.320
 It was the dilemma for the Tsars, it was the dilemma for Peter the Great, it was the dilemma

05:10.320 --> 05:17.080
 for Alexander, it was the dilemma for Stalin, and it's the dilemma for Putin.

05:17.080 --> 05:22.280
 Russia is smaller now compared to when Stalin was in that Kremlin.

05:22.280 --> 05:29.280
 It's got pushed back to borders almost the time of Peter the Great, its father from the

05:29.280 --> 05:35.920
 main European capitals now than any time since that 18th century.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.240
 And the West has only grown stronger in that period of time.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.760
 So the dilemma is greater than ever.

05:43.760 --> 05:49.640
 The irony of being in that position, of sitting in the Kremlin, trying to manage Russian power

05:49.640 --> 05:55.600
 in the world, trying to be a providential power, a country with a special mission in

05:55.600 --> 06:02.320
 the world, a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization, and yet not having

06:02.320 --> 06:09.240
 the capabilities to meet those aspirations, and falling father and father behind the West.

06:09.240 --> 06:15.360
 The irony of all of that is the attempted solutions put Russia in a worse place every

06:15.360 --> 06:17.120
 single time.

06:17.120 --> 06:23.880
 So you try to manage the gap with the West, you try to realize these aspirations, you

06:23.880 --> 06:29.960
 try to raise your capabilities, and you build a strong state, the quest to build a strong

06:29.960 --> 06:37.960
 state and use coercive modernization, to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the

06:37.960 --> 06:40.920
 West, at least to manage it.

06:40.920 --> 06:46.640
 And the result is different versions of personalist rule.

06:46.640 --> 06:53.240
 So they don't build a strong state, they build a personal dictatorship, they build an autocracy.

06:53.240 --> 06:59.600
 And moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma

06:59.600 --> 07:05.240
 that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place.

07:05.240 --> 07:10.240
 And so I call this Russia's perpetual geopolitics, I've been writing about this for many, many

07:10.240 --> 07:11.480
 years.

07:11.480 --> 07:21.280
 What's important about this analysis is this is not a story of eternal Russian cultural

07:21.280 --> 07:24.720
 proclivity to aggression.

07:24.720 --> 07:29.560
 It's not something that's in the mother's milk, it's not something that can't be changed

07:29.560 --> 07:35.960
 â€“ Russia doesn't have an innate cultural tendency to aggression.

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
 This is a choice.

07:36.960 --> 07:44.560
 It's a strategic choice to try to match the power of the West, which from Russia's vantage

07:44.560 --> 07:46.680
 point is actually unmatchable.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.720
 But it's a choice that's made again and again, and Putin has made this choice just

07:50.720 --> 07:53.400
 as Stalin made the choice.

07:53.400 --> 07:59.480
 Stalin presided over the World War II victory, and then he lost the peace.

07:59.480 --> 08:06.720
 After he died in 1953, there was, of course, other rulers who succeeded him.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.640
 He was still the most important person in the country after he died, because they were

08:11.640 --> 08:16.280
 trying to manage that system that he built, and more importantly, manage that growing

08:16.280 --> 08:18.520
 gap with the West.

08:18.520 --> 08:25.920
 By the time the 90s rolled around, former Soviet troops, now Russian troops, withdrew

08:25.920 --> 08:31.000
 from all those advanced positions that they had achieved as a result of the World War

08:31.000 --> 08:34.680
 II victory, and it was Napoleon in reverse.

08:34.680 --> 08:42.520
 They went on the same roads, but not from Moscow back to Paris, but instead from Warsaw

08:42.520 --> 08:50.160
 and from East Berlin and from Tallinn and Riga and all the other places of former Warsaw

08:50.160 --> 08:55.560
 Pact and former Soviet republics in the Baltic region.

08:55.560 --> 09:02.160
 They went back to Russia in retreat, and so Stalin in the fullness of time lost the peace.

09:02.160 --> 09:10.480
 And Putin, in his own way, inheriting some of this, attempting to reverse it when, as

09:10.480 --> 09:16.680
 I said, Russia was smaller, farther away, weaker, the West was bigger and stronger,

09:16.680 --> 09:25.480
 and had absorbed those former Warsaw Pact countries and Baltic states because they voluntarily

09:25.480 --> 09:28.040
 begged to join the West.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.520
 The West didn't impose itself on them.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.680
 It's a voluntary sphere of influence that the West conducts.

09:34.680 --> 09:41.400
 And so that dilemma is where you can put Putin and Stalin in the same sentence and the terrible

09:41.400 --> 09:46.800
 outcome for Russia in the fullness of time also has echoes.

09:46.800 --> 09:53.640
 But of course, Putin hasn't murdered 18 to 20 million people, and the scale of his abilities

09:53.640 --> 10:00.120
 to cause grief with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing like Stalin's.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.400
 And so we have to be careful, right?

10:02.400 --> 10:08.320
 Only Mao put bigger numbers on the board from a tragic point of view than Stalin.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.440
 And numbers matter here if we compare these singular figures.

10:13.440 --> 10:20.560
 Yeah, Mao killed more people in Stalin because Mao had more people to kill.

10:20.560 --> 10:26.280
 The most amazing thing about Mao is he watched Stalin do it.

10:26.280 --> 10:31.040
 He watched Stalin collectivize agriculture and famine result.

10:31.040 --> 10:38.240
 He watched Stalin impose this communist monopoly, and all of those people sent to prison or

10:38.240 --> 10:42.560
 given a bullet in the back of the neck, he watched all of that, and then he did it again

10:42.560 --> 10:43.560
 himself in China.

10:43.560 --> 10:48.720
 Do you think he saw the human cost directly that when you say he saw, do you think he

10:48.720 --> 10:55.800
 was focused on the policies or was he also aware distinctly as a human being of the human

10:55.800 --> 11:00.480
 costs and the lives of peasants and the lives of the working class and the lives of the

11:00.480 --> 11:01.720
 poor?

11:01.720 --> 11:06.600
 I think the prima facie evidence is that he didn't value human life.

11:06.600 --> 11:11.680
 Otherwise, I don't think after seeing the amount of lives that were taken in the Soviet

11:11.680 --> 11:16.280
 experiment, he would have done something similar after that.

11:16.280 --> 11:22.000
 I think the answer, Lex, is it's very hard to get inside Mao's head and figure out what

11:22.000 --> 11:24.200
 he was really thinking.

11:24.200 --> 11:29.280
 But if you just look at the results that happened, the policies that were undertaken and the

11:29.280 --> 11:36.080
 consequences of them, you would have to conclude that there was, let's say, no value or little

11:36.080 --> 11:38.680
 value placed on human life.

11:38.680 --> 11:44.000
 Unfortunately, that's characteristic not only of communist dictators, of post communist

11:44.000 --> 11:53.000
 dictators as well, but the scale of the horrors that they inflict, as horrific as they are,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.680
 just can't compare.

11:54.680 --> 12:01.520
 And so we're in a situation where Eurasia, that is to say, the ancient civilizations

12:01.520 --> 12:13.120
 of Eurasia, which would be Russia, Iran, China, all have some version of non democratic,

12:13.120 --> 12:16.400
 you know, illiberal, autocratic regimes.

12:16.400 --> 12:21.640
 And they're all pushing up against the greater power of the West in some form.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.400
 Sometimes they coordinate their actions and sometimes they don't.

12:25.400 --> 12:33.200
 But this is a very long standing phenomenon, Lex, that predates Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping

12:33.200 --> 12:37.640
 or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in Iran.

12:37.640 --> 12:45.480
 So we'll talk about this, I think, really powerful framework of five dimensions of authoritarian

12:45.480 --> 12:47.200
 regimes that you've put together.

12:47.200 --> 12:56.560
 But first, let's go to this Napoleon and reverse retreat from Warsaw back.

12:56.560 --> 13:02.920
 Putin is called, from the perspective of Putin, this retreat, this collapse of Stalin is one

13:02.920 --> 13:09.360
 of the great tragedies of that region of Russia.

13:09.360 --> 13:18.440
 Do you think there's a sense where as Putin sits now in power for 22 plus years, he really

13:18.440 --> 13:31.440
 dreams of a return to the power that influence the land of Stalin?

13:31.440 --> 13:38.480
 So while you said that they're not in the same place in terms of the numbers of people

13:38.480 --> 13:44.840
 that suffer due to their regime, do you think he hopes to have the same power, the same

13:44.840 --> 13:52.720
 influence for a nation that was in the 30s and the 40s and the 50s of the 20th century

13:52.720 --> 13:54.080
 under Stalin?

13:54.080 --> 13:57.800
 If he does, Lex, he's deluding himself.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.040
 We don't know for sure.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.640
 Very few people talk to him.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.520
 Very few people have access to him.

14:05.520 --> 14:12.400
 A handful of Western leaders have met with him for short periods of time.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.760
 Those inside Russia barely meet with him.

14:14.760 --> 14:20.360
 His own minions in the regime barely have face time with him.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.560
 We don't know exactly what he thinks.

14:22.560 --> 14:32.560
 It could be that he has delusions of reconquering Russian influence, if not direct control over

14:32.560 --> 14:38.560
 the territories that broke away, but it's not going to happen.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.560
 Let's talk a little bit about this guy, Nikolai Potroshev.

14:42.560 --> 14:47.760
 Nikolai Potroshev is probably not well known to your listeners.

14:47.760 --> 14:54.760
 He's the head of Russia's Security Council, and so you could probably call him the second

14:54.760 --> 14:59.640
 most important or second most powerful man in Russia.

14:59.640 --> 15:06.120
 Only inside the regime, arguably Navalny is the second most important person in the country,

15:06.120 --> 15:07.960
 and we'll talk about that later, I'm sure.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.280
 In terms of influence.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.280
 Yes.

15:10.280 --> 15:21.720
 But Potroshev is a version of Putin's right hand man, and Potroshev has been giving interviews

15:21.720 --> 15:22.720
 in the press.

15:22.720 --> 15:27.760
 You probably saw the interview with Niza Vesemaya Gazeta not that long ago.

15:27.760 --> 15:36.520
 He writes also his own blog like interventions in the public sphere using the few channels

15:36.520 --> 15:39.000
 that are left.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.880
 What's interesting about Potroshev, and this could well reflect similar thinking to Putin's,

15:45.880 --> 15:53.280
 which is why I'm bringing this up, is that he's got this conspiratorial theory that

15:53.280 --> 16:00.920
 the West has been on a forever campaign to destroy Russia, just like it destroyed the

16:00.920 --> 16:07.680
 Soviet Union, and that everything the West does is meant to dismember Russia, and that

16:07.680 --> 16:13.600
 Russia is fighting an existential battle against the West.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.240
 For example, the CIA and the American government wanted to bring down the Soviet Union.

16:19.240 --> 16:24.400
 The mind that the Bush administration, the first Bush, the father, was trying desperately

16:24.400 --> 16:30.440
 to hold the Soviet Union together because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue

16:30.440 --> 16:37.640
 and the nukes that might get loose as a result of a Soviet collapse.

16:37.640 --> 16:44.840
 It wasn't until the very last moment where Bush decided, his administration decided to

16:44.840 --> 16:52.240
 back those Republican leaders who were breaking away from Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet

16:52.240 --> 16:54.480
 Union.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.520
 Never mind the empirics of it.

16:56.520 --> 17:03.680
 Never mind that Bill Clinton's administration, following George Bush, sent boatloads of money,

17:03.680 --> 17:06.720
 Western taxpayer money to Russia.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.800
 We don't know exactly how much because it came from different sources.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.320
 People talk about how there was no Marshall Plan.

17:13.320 --> 17:20.400
 It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources, from the IMF and other sources, and

17:20.400 --> 17:22.040
 Lexa disappeared.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.040
 It's gone.

17:23.040 --> 17:27.360
 Just like the German money that went to Gorbachev for unification disappeared even before the

17:27.360 --> 17:30.040
 Soviet collapse, the money disappeared.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.320
 But the West sent the money.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.040
 So how was that applied?

17:34.040 --> 17:39.200
 And then you could go all the way, Obama's administration, George Bush trying to do business

17:39.200 --> 17:46.640
 deals and reset the relations and Obama administration trying to reset the relations and doing nothing

17:46.640 --> 17:55.120
 after the Georgian war and slapping Putin on the wrist, following the seizure force.

17:55.120 --> 17:59.320
 And you could go on and you could go on all the way through the Trump administration telling

17:59.320 --> 18:05.240
 Putin that he's right, Trump believes Putin and doesn't believe U.S. intelligence about

18:05.240 --> 18:08.920
 Russian efforts to interfere in American domestic politics.

18:08.920 --> 18:16.720
 So despite all the empirics of it, you have Potoshev and likely Putin talking about this

18:16.720 --> 18:21.600
 multi decade Western conspiracy to bring Russia down.

18:21.600 --> 18:27.840
 At the same time as that's happening, the Germans are voluntarily increasing their dependence

18:27.840 --> 18:33.080
 on Russian energy, voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russian.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.040
 So here's the conspiracy to bring Russia down.

18:36.040 --> 18:43.160
 The French who fantasize about themselves as a diplomatic superpower are constantly,

18:43.160 --> 18:48.360
 the French leaders are constantly running to the Kremlin to ask what Russian needs,

18:48.360 --> 18:53.800
 what concessions from the West Russian needs to feel respected again.

18:53.800 --> 19:01.760
 The British provide all manner of money laundering and reputation laundering services for the

19:01.760 --> 19:08.360
 whole Russian oligarchy, including the state officials who are looting the state and using

19:08.360 --> 19:12.000
 the West British institutions to launder their money.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.840
 So all of this is happening and yet Potoshev imagines this conspiracy to bring Russia down

19:17.840 --> 19:19.320
 by the West.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.240
 And so that's what we've got in the Kremlin again.

19:22.240 --> 19:27.280
 Stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the West.

19:27.280 --> 19:31.400
 Everything that happened in the world was part of a Western conspiracy directed against

19:31.400 --> 19:34.480
 the Soviet Union and now directed against Russia.

19:34.480 --> 19:39.960
 Even though the West is trying to appease, the West is offering its services, the West

19:39.960 --> 19:45.720
 is trying to change Russia through investment in a positive way, but instead the West is

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
 what's changing.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.840
 The West is becoming more corrupt.

19:48.840 --> 19:53.240
 Western services are being corrupted by the relationship with Russia.

19:53.240 --> 19:59.840
 So you have to ask yourself, who are these people in power in the Kremlin who imagine

19:59.840 --> 20:06.680
 that while they're availing themselves of every service and every blandishment of the

20:06.680 --> 20:11.880
 West, while they're availing themselves of this, that they're fighting a conspiracy

20:11.880 --> 20:14.580
 by the West to bring them down.

20:14.580 --> 20:23.720
 So this is what they call the Abyssinia in Russian, which is a term, as you know, that

20:23.720 --> 20:31.940
 means those who are resentful or you might call them the losers, the losers in the transition.

20:31.940 --> 20:39.520
 So when the Soviet Union fell and there was a very substantial diminution in Russian power

20:39.520 --> 20:44.080
 and influence in the world, a lot of people lost out.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.020
 They weren't able to steal the property.

20:47.020 --> 20:50.700
 They weren't able to loot the state in the 90s.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.840
 And they were on the outside.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.340
 They gradually came back in.

20:55.340 --> 20:59.380
 They were the losers in the transition domestically.

20:59.380 --> 21:06.060
 And for them, right, they wanted to reverse being on the losing side.

21:06.060 --> 21:13.780
 And so they began to expropriate, to steal the money, steal the property from those first

21:13.780 --> 21:17.060
 thieves who stole in the 90s.

21:17.060 --> 21:23.500
 And the 2000s and on have been about re stealing, taking the losers in the transition, taking

21:23.500 --> 21:30.820
 the money from the winners, and reversing this resentment, this loser status.

21:30.820 --> 21:33.780
 Those are your Patrushevs and your Putin's.

21:33.780 --> 21:41.740
 But at the same time, this blows out to let's reverse the losses being on the losing side,

21:41.740 --> 21:47.260
 the roiling resentment at the decline of their power internationally.

21:47.260 --> 21:49.740
 Let's try to reverse that too.

21:49.740 --> 21:57.260
 So you have a profound psychological whole generation of people who are on the losing

21:57.260 --> 22:00.660
 end domestically and reverse that domestically.

22:00.660 --> 22:02.660
 That's what the Putin regime is about.

22:02.660 --> 22:06.580
 Remember Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos.

22:06.580 --> 22:12.420
 Remember all the companies that are now owned by Putin cronies because they were taken away

22:12.420 --> 22:15.900
 from whoever stole them in the first place.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.340
 And now they're trying to do that on the international scale.

22:19.340 --> 22:23.060
 It's one thing to put domestic opponents in jail.

22:23.060 --> 22:27.180
 It's one thing to take away someone's property domestically.

22:27.180 --> 22:32.300
 But you're not going to reverse the power of the West with the diminished Russia that

22:32.300 --> 22:34.380
 you have.

22:34.380 --> 22:42.260
 And so that project, that Patrushev project, which we see him expressing again and again,

22:42.260 --> 22:43.980
 he speaks about it publicly.

22:43.980 --> 22:50.380
 It's not something that we need to go looking for a quest, the secret.

22:50.380 --> 22:51.380
 We can't find it.

22:51.380 --> 22:52.620
 What are they thinking?

22:52.620 --> 22:54.900
 It's right there in front of our face.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.860
 And Putin has spoken the same way for a long time.

22:57.860 --> 23:03.620
 People point to the 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference that Putin delivered and

23:03.620 --> 23:08.340
 certainly your listeners could use a snippet or two of that, just like they could use a

23:08.340 --> 23:14.060
 couple of quotes from Patrushev to contextualize what we're talking about.

23:14.060 --> 23:24.220
 But it predates the 2007 Munich speech, the reaction to Ukraine's uprising in 2004 attempt

23:24.220 --> 23:32.300
 to steal the election inside Ukraine, which the Ukrainian people rose up valiantly against

23:32.300 --> 23:35.060
 and risked their lives and overturned.

23:35.060 --> 23:40.100
 So there were public statements from Putin already back then, the statements about Harkovsky

23:40.100 --> 23:44.140
 in 2003 when he was arrested and expropriated.

23:44.140 --> 23:52.360
 This is a longstanding psychological, deeply psychological issue, which is about managing

23:52.360 --> 23:56.900
 Russian power in the world, as I was saying, the gap with the West, but has this further

23:56.900 --> 24:03.060
 dimension of feeling like losers and wanting to reverse that, that's their life experience.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.660
 Abyssinia.

24:04.660 --> 24:13.860
 So there's that resentment that fuels this narrative, fuels this geopolitics and internal

24:13.860 --> 24:14.860
 policy.

24:14.860 --> 24:19.540
 But so resentment is behind some of the worst things that have ever been done in human history.

24:19.540 --> 24:22.700
 Hitler was probably fueled by resentment.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.220
 So resentment is a really powerful force, yes.

24:26.220 --> 24:33.300
 Just to maybe not push back, but to give fuller context on the West.

24:33.300 --> 24:42.300
 He said there's a narrative from Putin's Russia that the West is somehow an enemy.

24:42.300 --> 24:47.860
 You position everything against the West, but is there a degree, and to what degree

24:47.860 --> 24:52.820
 is the West willing to feed that narrative, that it's also convenient for the West to

24:52.820 --> 24:54.100
 have an enemy?

24:54.100 --> 25:02.620
 It seems like in the place, in the span, it seems like in geopolitics, having an enemy

25:02.620 --> 25:06.500
 is useful for forming a narrative.

25:06.500 --> 25:12.260
 Now having an enemy for the basic perspective of humanity is not good, but in terms of maintaining

25:12.260 --> 25:18.660
 power, if you're a leader in a game of geopolitics, it seems to be good to have an enemy.

25:18.660 --> 25:21.820
 It seems to be good to have something like a Cold War.

25:21.820 --> 25:27.500
 You can always point your finger and says, all our actions are fighting this evil, whatever

25:27.500 --> 25:28.660
 that evil is.

25:28.660 --> 25:33.740
 It could be like with George W. Bush, the war on terrorism is this evil.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.500
 You can always point that something.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.180
 So you've made it seem that the West is trying.

25:38.180 --> 25:43.020
 There's a lot of forces within the West that are trying to reach out a friendly hand, trying

25:43.020 --> 25:48.220
 to help, sending money, sending compassion, trying to sort of...

25:48.220 --> 25:51.060
 Trying to integrate Russia into global institutions.

25:51.060 --> 25:51.560
 Exactly.

25:51.560 --> 25:58.380
...which was a longstanding multi decade effort across multiple countries and multiple administrations

25:58.380 --> 25:59.740
 in those countries.

25:59.740 --> 26:02.420
 But is there also warmongers on the West that would want more?

26:02.420 --> 26:06.340
 Of course, Lex, of course you're right about that, but let's put it this way.

26:06.340 --> 26:12.940
 People talk about the Cold War and they usually looking to assign blame for the Cold War as

26:12.940 --> 26:19.980
 if it's some kind of mistake, a misunderstanding, or a search for an enemy that was convenient

26:19.980 --> 26:23.180
 to rally domestic politics.

26:23.180 --> 26:30.980
 So Lex, there's a coup in Czechoslovakia and somebody installs a communist regime in

26:30.980 --> 26:33.780
 February 1948.

26:33.780 --> 26:36.780
 No reaction to that, that's just okay.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.140
 There's a blockade of Berlin.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.740
 Is that cool by you?

26:40.740 --> 26:46.860
 Where they try to strangle West Berlin so that they can swallow West Berlin and add

26:46.860 --> 26:48.140
 it to East Berlin.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.380
 You cool with that?

26:50.380 --> 26:57.180
 How about Korean War, invasion of North Korea, invasion of South Korea by North Korea.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.080
 You cool with that?

26:59.080 --> 27:05.220
 How about the murders and the show trials up and down Eastern Europe in the late 40s

27:05.220 --> 27:08.140
 after the imposition of the clone regimes?

27:08.140 --> 27:09.140
 You good with that?

27:09.140 --> 27:13.820
 Yeah, it's very convenient to have an enemy, I agree with you.

27:13.820 --> 27:17.180
 But you know, there was some actions, Lex.

27:17.180 --> 27:19.940
 There was some threats to people's freedom.

27:19.940 --> 27:21.940
 There was some invasions.

27:21.940 --> 27:27.680
 There was some aggression and violence on a mass scale, like collectivization of Eastern

27:27.680 --> 27:28.680
 Europe.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.580
 We could go on, Lex, with the examples.

27:30.580 --> 27:33.380
 I'm just giving a few of them.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.100
 And so the Cold War was not a mistake.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.100
 It was not a misunderstanding.

27:37.100 --> 27:41.380
 You don't have to blame someone for the Cold War.

27:41.380 --> 27:44.100
 We have to give credit for the Cold War.

27:44.100 --> 27:51.220
 The Truman administration deserves credit for standing up to Stalin's regime, for standing

27:51.220 --> 27:57.100
 up to these actions, for saying, yeah, we're not just going to take this.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.140
 We're not going to let this go on.

27:59.140 --> 28:02.780
 We're not going to let this expand to further territories.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.260
 We're going to create the NATO alliance.

28:05.260 --> 28:12.260
 And we're going to rally democratic liberal regimes to stand up to this illiberalism,

28:12.260 --> 28:14.820
 this violence, and this aggression.

28:14.820 --> 28:19.340
 And so, yeah, Lex, it's always convenient to have an enemy.

28:19.340 --> 28:24.140
 But there was an enemy, Nikolai Leonov, who recently died.

28:24.140 --> 28:29.180
 He died in April, 2022, and he had a major funeral.

28:29.180 --> 28:36.620
 He was the last head analyst of the Soviet KGB.

28:36.620 --> 28:41.860
 And Leonov is one of the most important figures for understanding the Soviet collapse.

28:41.860 --> 28:49.100
 And he has the best memoir on the Soviet collapse, which is known in Russian as Lycholetia.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.660
 You will understand that.

28:51.660 --> 28:56.260
 And you'll help your podcast listeners understand.

28:56.260 --> 29:01.100
 There's a singularity to that kind of expression, Lycholetia.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.340
 Leonov just died.

29:02.340 --> 29:10.340
 But one of the things, and in fact, the people who were supposedly arrested by Putin as scapegoats

29:10.340 --> 29:17.500
 for the Ukraine war, the main one, Sergei Besheda, gave the eulogy at Leonov's funeral

29:17.500 --> 29:23.100
 in April, 2022, showing that it's a lie that all of these people have been arrested and

29:23.100 --> 29:27.580
 purged in another nonsense in social media.

29:27.580 --> 29:33.100
 But to get back to what Leonov said and get back to your enemy point, Leonov said, you

29:33.100 --> 29:39.220
 know, the West spent all this time blackening the image of the Soviet Union.

29:39.220 --> 29:45.940
 All these resources and propaganda and covert operations to blacken the Soviet image.

29:45.940 --> 29:46.940
 And they did, Lex.

29:46.940 --> 29:48.420
 The West did do that.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.760
 And then Leonov wrote in the next sentence, and you know what?

29:51.760 --> 29:57.900
 We gave them a lot of material to work with to blacken our image.

29:57.900 --> 30:04.780
 So you're saying a kind of sobering reality, which it is possible to some degree to draw

30:04.780 --> 30:07.940
 line between the good guys and the bad guys.

30:07.940 --> 30:11.180
 Freedom is better than unfreedom, Lex.

30:11.180 --> 30:15.860
 It's a lot better than unfreedom, and a guy like you understands that really well.

30:15.860 --> 30:25.140
 Well, so yes, but those are all, you know, there's words like justice, freedom.

30:25.140 --> 30:26.140
 What else?

30:26.140 --> 30:27.140
 Love.

30:27.140 --> 30:34.860
 You can use a lot of words that Hitler himself used to describe why he is actually creating

30:34.860 --> 30:37.940
 a better world than those he's fighting.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.300
 So some of it is propaganda.

30:39.300 --> 30:44.980
 The question is on the ground, what is actually increasing the amount of freedom in the world?

30:44.980 --> 30:45.980
 Institution's Lex, right?

30:45.980 --> 30:48.620
 We're not talking about propaganda here.

30:48.620 --> 30:53.460
 When we use words like freedom, we're talking about rule of law.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.020
 We're talking about protection of civil liberties.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.100
 We're talking about protection of private property.

30:59.100 --> 31:03.580
 We're talking about an independent and well funded judiciary.

31:03.580 --> 31:09.460
 We're talking about an impartial, non corrupt, competent civil service.

31:09.460 --> 31:15.140
 We're talking about separation of powers where the executive branch's power is limited, usually

31:15.140 --> 31:17.340
 by an elected parliament.

31:17.340 --> 31:21.260
 In fact, yes, let's talk about elections.

31:21.260 --> 31:25.340
 Let's talk about freedom of speech and freedom of the public sphere.

31:25.340 --> 31:28.180
 We're not talking about freedom as a slogan here.

31:28.180 --> 31:35.460
 We're talking about a huge array of institutions and practices and norms ultimately, right?

31:35.460 --> 31:39.260
 And if they exist, you know and you live under them.

31:39.260 --> 31:43.940
 And if they don't exist, you fully understand that as well, right?

31:43.940 --> 31:49.820
 Ukraine was a flawed democracy before Russia invaded.

31:49.820 --> 31:58.580
 It's utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional, especially the elites were dysfunctional.

31:58.580 --> 32:03.860
 The gas industry in Ukraine was absolutely terrible because of the corruption that it

32:03.860 --> 32:10.380
 generated, the oligarch problem, a handful of people stealing the state resources.

32:10.380 --> 32:16.740
 And yet Ukraine had an open public sphere and it had a parliament that functioned.

32:16.740 --> 32:23.500
 And so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy.

32:23.500 --> 32:27.700
 The regime in Moscow, you can't say that Lex.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.580
 It's not a comparable regime to Ukraine.

32:30.580 --> 32:34.620
 You could say, oh, well, there are oligarchs in Ukraine and there are oligarchs in Russia.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.260
 There's corruption in Ukraine, there's corruption in Russia.

32:37.260 --> 32:38.980
 So really, what's the big difference?

32:38.980 --> 32:44.420
 And the answer is, well, Ukraine had the open public sphere, Ukraine had a real parliament.

32:44.420 --> 32:47.700
 Can you call Russia's Duma a real parliament?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.340
 I don't think so.

32:49.340 --> 32:51.100
 I don't think you can.

32:51.100 --> 32:57.460
 Can you say that there were any checks whatsoever on the executive branch in Russia?

32:57.460 --> 33:06.100
 Can you say that the Russian judiciary had any independence or really full level of competence,

33:06.100 --> 33:09.940
 even compared to the Ukrainian judiciary, which was nothing to brag about?

33:09.940 --> 33:12.140
 No, you can't say that, Lex.

33:12.140 --> 33:22.180
 So we can differentiate between the very flawed, corrupt oligarchic democracy in Ukraine and

33:22.180 --> 33:26.300
 the very corrupt oligarchic autocracy in Russia.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.660
 I think that's a fair distinction.

33:28.660 --> 33:34.060
 Yeah, we should say that Russia and Ukraine have the great honor of being the number one

33:34.060 --> 33:38.780
 and the number two most corrupt nations in Europe by many measures.

33:38.780 --> 33:42.220
 But there is a fundamental difference as you're highlighting.

33:42.220 --> 33:48.380
 Russia is a corrupt autocracy, Ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy.

33:48.380 --> 33:54.100
 And to that level, there's a fundamental difference.

33:54.100 --> 33:59.800
 Ukraine is not murdering its own journalists in systematic fashion.

33:59.800 --> 34:03.460
 If journalists are killed in Ukraine, it's a tragedy.

34:03.460 --> 34:07.660
 If journalists are killed in Russia or Russian journalists are killed abroad, it's regime

34:07.660 --> 34:08.660
 policy.

34:08.660 --> 34:16.020
 And the degree to which a nation is authoritarian means that it's suffocating its own spirit,

34:16.020 --> 34:19.300
 its capacity to flourish.

34:19.300 --> 34:27.740
 We're not just talking about sort of the freedom of the press, those kinds of things, but basically

34:27.740 --> 34:34.060
 all industries get suffocated and you're no longer being able to, yeah, flourish as

34:34.060 --> 34:38.500
 a nation, grow the production, the GDP, the scientists, the art, the culture, all those

34:38.500 --> 34:39.500
 kinds of things.

34:39.500 --> 34:40.900
 Yes, Lex, you're absolutely right.

34:40.900 --> 34:47.580
 And so before the invasion, the full blown invasion of February 2022 into Ukraine, because

34:47.580 --> 34:52.740
 as you know, the war has been going on for many years at a lower level compared to what

34:52.740 --> 35:00.700
 it is these days, but still a tragic war with many deaths prior to February 2022.

35:00.700 --> 35:05.740
 Before this latest war, we could have said that the greatest victims of the Putin regime

35:05.740 --> 35:13.540
 are Russian domestic, that the people who are suffering the most from the Putin regime

35:13.540 --> 35:18.980
 are not sitting here in New York City, but in fact are sitting there in Russia.

35:18.980 --> 35:27.100
 Now of course, with the invasion of Ukraine and really the atrocities that have been well

35:27.100 --> 35:34.860
 documented and more are being investigated, we can't easily say anymore that Russians

35:34.860 --> 35:41.820
 are the greatest victims of the Putin regime, but in ways other than bombing and murdering

35:41.820 --> 35:51.780
 civilians, children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers, after you include that, then

35:51.780 --> 35:57.380
 of course the larger number of victims of the Putin regime are not Ukrainians, but ultimately

35:57.380 --> 36:02.260
 Russians and there's how many of them now that have fled?

36:02.260 --> 36:11.900
 So your powerful, precise, rigorous words are then in a stark contrast, I would say,

36:11.900 --> 36:17.420
 to my very recent conversation with Oliver Stone, and I would love you to elaborate

36:17.420 --> 36:25.540
 to this agreement you have here with his words and maybe words of people like John Miersheimer.

36:25.540 --> 36:34.220
 The idea is that Putin's hand in this invasion of 2022 was forced by the expansion of NATO,

36:34.220 --> 36:44.020
 the imperialist imperative of the United States and the NATO forces.

36:44.020 --> 36:52.420
 You disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame somehow on the invasion on forces

36:52.420 --> 36:59.700
 larger than the particular two nations involved, but more on the geopolitics of the world that's

36:59.700 --> 37:03.860
 driven by the most powerful military nation in the world, which is the United States.

37:03.860 --> 37:04.860
 Yeah, Lex.

37:04.860 --> 37:14.020
 So let's imagine that a tragedy has happened here in New York and a woman got raped.

37:14.020 --> 37:19.860
 We know the perpetrator, they go to trial and Oliver Stone gets up and says, you know

37:19.860 --> 37:27.140
 what, the woman was wearing a short skirt and there was no option but for the rapist

37:27.140 --> 37:28.820
 to rape her.

37:28.820 --> 37:35.500
 The woman was wearing lipstick or the woman was applying for NATO membership and just

37:35.500 --> 37:37.660
 had to be raped.

37:37.660 --> 37:44.740
 I mean, didn't want a raper, but was compelled because of what she was doing and what she

37:44.740 --> 37:50.660
 looked like and the clothes she was wearing and the alliances that she was under international

37:50.660 --> 37:57.460
 law signed by Moscow, all the treaties that sovereign countries get to choose whatever

37:57.460 --> 38:06.420
 alliance they belong to, treaties that the UN Charter signed by Russia, Soviet Union.

38:06.420 --> 38:15.220
 The 1975 Helsinki agreement signed by the Soviet Union, the 1990 Charter of Paris for

38:15.220 --> 38:22.140
 a new Europe signed by the Soviet Union, the 1997 NATO Russia founding act signed by the

38:22.140 --> 38:29.420
 Russian government, the post Soviet Russia, all of those documents signed by either the

38:29.420 --> 38:35.420
 Soviet regime or the Russian regime, which is the legally recognized international inheritor,

38:35.420 --> 38:40.460
 right, successor of the Soviet state, all of those agreements are still in force and

38:40.460 --> 38:48.220
 all of them say that countries are sovereign and can freely choose their foreign policy

38:48.220 --> 38:51.020
 and what alliances they want to join.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.580
 Let's even go farther than that.

38:52.580 --> 38:58.100
 I mean, you don't have to go farther than that, but let's go farther than that Lex.

38:58.100 --> 39:05.140
 Is an autocratic repressive regime that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security,

39:05.140 --> 39:07.100
 being new in Russian history?

39:07.100 --> 39:09.060
 Did we not see this before?

39:09.060 --> 39:13.660
 Is this, does this not predate NATO expansion?

39:13.660 --> 39:17.260
 Does this not predate the existence of NATO?

39:17.260 --> 39:22.580
 Would Oliver Stone sit here in this chair and say to you, you know, they had to impose

39:22.580 --> 39:30.140
 serfdom in the 17th century because NATO expanded, they had no choice, their hands were tied,

39:30.140 --> 39:37.540
 they were compelled to treat their own population like slaves because, you know, NATO expanded.

39:37.540 --> 39:43.620
 I mean, I could go on through the examples of Russian history that predate the existence,

39:43.620 --> 39:52.620
 let alone the expansion of NATO, where you have behavior, policies, actions very similar

39:52.620 --> 39:56.300
 to what we see now from the Kremlin.

39:56.300 --> 40:00.120
 And you can't explain those by NATO expansion, can you?

40:00.120 --> 40:07.620
 And so that argument doesn't wash for me because I have a pattern here that predates NATO expansion.

40:07.620 --> 40:14.460
 I have international agreements, founding documents signed by the Kremlin over many,

40:14.460 --> 40:20.740
 many decades, acknowledging the freedom of countries to choose their alliances.

40:20.740 --> 40:25.580
 And then I have this problem where when you rape somebody, it's not because they're wearing

40:25.580 --> 40:27.060
 a short skirt.

40:27.060 --> 40:32.540
 It's because you have raped them.

40:32.540 --> 40:36.140
 You've committed a criminal act, Lex.

40:36.140 --> 40:40.940
 I think there's a lot of people listening to this that will agree to the emotion, the

40:40.940 --> 40:43.180
 power and the spirit of this metaphor.

40:43.180 --> 40:49.420
 And I was struggling to think how to dance within this metaphor because it feels like

40:49.420 --> 40:55.020
 it wasn't precisely the right one, but I think that it captures the spirit.

40:55.020 --> 41:03.380
 I'm not suggesting, Lex, that everything the West has done has been honorable or intelligent.

41:03.380 --> 41:06.340
 Fortunately, we live in a democracy.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.980
 We live in liberal regimes.

41:07.980 --> 41:14.100
 We live under rule of law, liberal in the classical sense of rule of law, not liberal

41:14.100 --> 41:17.180
 in the leftist sense.

41:17.180 --> 41:22.180
 We live in places like that, and we can criticize ourselves, and we can criticize the mistakes

41:22.180 --> 41:27.020
 that we made or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken.

41:27.020 --> 41:34.700
 And there are a whole lot of things to answer for, and you can now discuss the ones that

41:34.700 --> 41:42.500
 are your favorites, the dishonor or the mistakes, and I could discuss mine, and we could spend

41:42.500 --> 41:47.340
 the whole rest of our meeting today discussing the West's mistakes and problems.

41:47.340 --> 41:49.820
 And we won't end up in prison for it.

41:49.820 --> 41:55.740
 Yeah, Lex, and so I'm thankful for that, and I'm thankful that people may disagree and

41:55.740 --> 42:00.140
 that people make the argument that NATO expansion is to blame.

42:00.140 --> 42:02.780
 But you see, I'm countering two arguments here.

42:02.780 --> 42:09.500
 I'm countering one argument, which is very deeply popular, pervasive, about how Russia

42:09.500 --> 42:16.180
 has this cultural tendency to aggression, and it can help but invade its neighbors and

42:16.180 --> 42:22.100
 it does it again and again, and it's eternal Russian imperialism, and you have to watch

42:22.100 --> 42:23.180
 out for it.

42:23.180 --> 42:28.700
 This very popular argument in the Baltic states, it's really popular in Warsaw.

42:28.700 --> 42:34.460
 It's really popular with the liberal interventionists, and it's very, very popular with those who

42:34.460 --> 42:39.220
 are part of the Iraq War squad that got us into that mess.

42:39.220 --> 42:43.620
 So I'm against that, and the reason I'm against it is because it's not true.

42:43.620 --> 42:44.860
 It's empirically false.

42:44.860 --> 42:50.820
 There is no cultural trait, inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive.

42:50.820 --> 42:53.340
 It's a strategic choice that they make.

42:53.340 --> 42:56.780
 Every time it's a choice made, it's not some kind of momentum.

42:56.780 --> 43:01.380
 Every time it's a choice that we should judge for the choice that it is for the decision.

43:01.380 --> 43:03.180
 And therefore they could make different choices.

43:03.180 --> 43:06.140
 They could say, we don't have to stand up to the West.

43:06.140 --> 43:08.900
 We don't have the capabilities to do that.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.660
 We can still be a great country.

43:10.660 --> 43:13.260
 We can still be a civilization unto itself.

43:13.260 --> 43:15.380
 We can still be Russia.

43:15.380 --> 43:22.740
 We can still worship in Orthodox cathedrals, or we can still be ourselves, but we don't

43:22.740 --> 43:29.380
 have to pursue this chimerical pursuit, this elusive quest to stand up to the West and

43:29.380 --> 43:32.020
 be in the first ranks of powers.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.420
 So I'm countering that argument.

43:33.420 --> 43:36.940
 I'm saying it's perpetual geopolitics.

43:36.940 --> 43:43.420
 It's a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma of the mismatch between aspirations

43:43.420 --> 43:45.140
 and capabilities.

43:45.140 --> 43:48.140
 It's not eternal Russian imperialism.

43:48.140 --> 43:52.940
 And I'm also countering the other argument here, Lex, which is to say that it's the West's

43:52.940 --> 43:54.100
 fault.

43:54.100 --> 43:56.180
 It's Western imperialism.

43:56.180 --> 44:01.700
 I'm very popular on the left, very popular with realist scholars, very popular with some

44:01.700 --> 44:05.020
 of the people recently on your podcast.

44:05.020 --> 44:11.380
 And so it's neither eternal Russian imperialism, nor is it Western imperialism.

44:11.380 --> 44:18.060
 The mere fact that the West is stronger than Russia is not a crime on the part of the West.

44:18.060 --> 44:24.300
 It's not a crime that countries voluntarily want to join the West that beg to get in,

44:24.300 --> 44:31.820
 either the EU or NATO or other bilateral alliances or other trade agreements.

44:31.820 --> 44:35.980
 Those are voluntarily entered into and that's not criminal.

44:35.980 --> 44:41.940
 If the West's sphere of influence, which is open, an open sphere of influence, which as

44:41.940 --> 44:47.220
 I say people voluntarily join, if that expands, that's not a crime, nor is that a threat to

44:47.220 --> 44:50.020
 Russia, ipso facto.

44:50.020 --> 44:55.980
 NATO is a defensive alliance and the countries are largely pacifist who are members of NATO.

44:55.980 --> 44:57.500
 And NATO doesn't attack.

44:57.500 --> 45:00.940
 It defends members if they are attacked.

45:00.940 --> 45:07.220
 And so the idea that Ukraine, which had the legal right, might want to join NATO in the

45:07.220 --> 45:13.300
 EU, which was not going to happen in our lifetimes and was not a direct threat to the Putin regime

45:13.300 --> 45:23.500
 since the Western countries that make up the EU and NATO decided that Ukraine was not ready

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
 for membership.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.620
 There was no consensus.

45:25.620 --> 45:31.540
 It was not going to happen, but Ukraine's free choice to express that desire.

45:31.540 --> 45:38.140
 And if your government is elected by your people, freely elected, meaning you can unelect

45:38.140 --> 45:43.620
 that government in the next election and that government makes foreign policy choices on

45:43.620 --> 45:48.420
 the basis of its perceived interests, that's not a crime, Lex.

45:48.420 --> 45:50.380
 That's not a provocation.

45:50.380 --> 45:56.220
 That's not something that compels the leader of another country to invade you.

45:56.220 --> 46:02.100
 That is legal under international law and it's also a realist fact of life.

46:02.100 --> 46:09.620
 The realists like to tell you that Russia here was disrespected, Russia's interests

46:09.620 --> 46:12.380
 were not taken into account, et cetera, et cetera.

46:12.380 --> 46:19.220
 But the real world works in such a way that treaties matter, that international law matters.

46:19.220 --> 46:26.060
 That's why people like me were not in favor of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, Lex, because

46:26.060 --> 46:32.140
 it wasn't legal in addition to the fact that we thought it might backfire.

46:32.140 --> 46:37.300
 But you know, Lex, like I said, there are a lot of things about the West that we ought

46:37.300 --> 46:44.300
 to criticize as citizens and we do criticize, but we have to be clear about where responsibility

46:44.300 --> 46:48.860
 lies in these events that we're talking about today.

46:48.860 --> 46:54.860
 So you get to trouble, it's largely erroneous to think about both the West or the United

46:54.860 --> 47:00.420
 States from an imperialist perspective and Russia from an imperialist perspective is

47:00.420 --> 47:06.100
 better clear to think about each individual aggressive decision on its own as a choice

47:06.100 --> 47:07.460
 that was made.

47:07.460 --> 47:14.180
 So let's talk about the most recent choice made by Vladimir Putin.

47:14.180 --> 47:22.900
 The choice to invade Ukraine or to escalate the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.

47:22.900 --> 47:28.820
 Now we're a few months removed from that decision, initial decision.

47:28.820 --> 47:30.700
 Why do you think he did it?

47:30.700 --> 47:40.220
 What are the errors in understanding the situation and calculating the outcomes and everything

47:40.220 --> 47:44.860
 else about this decision in your view?

47:44.860 --> 47:51.580
 Yeah, Lex, when a war doesn't go well, it looks like lunacy to have launched it in the

47:51.580 --> 47:52.580
 first place.

47:52.580 --> 47:54.420
 Does it ever go well?

47:54.420 --> 47:56.980
 War never goes according to plan.

47:56.980 --> 48:03.940
 All war is based upon miscalculation, but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation.

48:03.940 --> 48:10.260
 All aggressive war we're talking about, not defensive war, is based upon miscalculation.

48:10.260 --> 48:11.620
 But you can adjust.

48:11.620 --> 48:18.100
 You can recalibrate when you're driving down the road and that very annoying voice is telling

48:18.100 --> 48:26.460
 you in a thousand feet, make a right and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right?

48:26.460 --> 48:31.940
 It tells you, okay, now go turn around or you turn or make a left.

48:31.940 --> 48:37.140
 It doesn't say you're an idiot and turn around and make a U turn, but it does recalibrate.

48:37.140 --> 48:42.460
 So you can miscalculate and the problem is not the miscalculation, usually it's the failure

48:42.460 --> 48:45.740
 to do that adjustment, right?

48:45.740 --> 48:53.020
 People I know who are hedge fund traders, I asked them, what's your favorite trade?

48:53.020 --> 48:57.420
 And the line from them all, and this is a cliche, is my favorite trade is when I made

48:57.420 --> 49:02.760
 a mistake, but I got out early before all the carnage.

49:02.760 --> 49:07.060
 So their favorite trade is not when they made some brilliant choice, but it's when they

49:07.060 --> 49:13.940
 miscalculated, but they reduced the consequences of their miscalculation by recalibrating quickly,

49:13.940 --> 49:14.940
 right?

49:14.940 --> 49:19.580
 So let's talk about the calculation and miscalculation of February.

49:19.580 --> 49:23.540
 Let's imagine, Lex, that you've been getting away with murder.

49:23.540 --> 49:26.380
 I don't mean murder in a figurative sense.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.900
 I mean, you've been murdering people.

49:28.900 --> 49:33.980
 You've been murdering them domestically, and you've been murdering them all across Europe,

49:33.980 --> 49:42.020
 and you've been murdering them not just with, for example, a car accident, a stage car accident,

49:42.020 --> 49:44.660
 or using a handgun.

49:44.660 --> 49:54.740
 You use a novi choke, or you use some other internationally outlawed chemical weapon.

49:54.740 --> 49:58.860
 Now let's imagine that you did it and nothing happened to you.

49:58.860 --> 50:01.460
 It wasn't like you were removed from power.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.900
 It wasn't like you paid a personal price.

50:03.900 --> 50:08.380
 Sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy, but you didn't pay the price of those

50:08.380 --> 50:09.900
 sanctions.

50:09.900 --> 50:12.860
 Little people paid the price of those sanctions.

50:12.860 --> 50:16.020
 Other people in your country paid the price.

50:16.020 --> 50:24.980
 Let's imagine not only were you murdering people, literally, but you decided to entice

50:24.980 --> 50:33.860
 the idiotic ruler of Georgia into a provocation that you could then invade the country.

50:33.860 --> 50:40.180
 You invaded the country, and you bid off these territories, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

50:40.180 --> 50:42.980
 What price did you pay for that?

50:42.980 --> 50:49.340
 Then you decided, you know, I think I'll now invade Crimea, and forcibly annex Crimea,

50:49.340 --> 50:56.180
 and I'll instigate an insurrection in the Donbas, in Eastern Ukraine, in Luhansk.

50:56.180 --> 51:01.940
 Let's imagine you did all that, and then you had to stick out your wrist so that it

51:01.940 --> 51:04.460
 could be slapped a couple of times.

51:04.460 --> 51:08.580
 You said, you know, I can pretty much do what I want.

51:08.580 --> 51:13.420
 I'm putting a sanction here and there, and they're doing this, and they're doing that,

51:13.420 --> 51:17.300
 and you know what, they're more energy dependent on me than before.

51:17.300 --> 51:22.100
 I got better money laundering and reputation services than anybody has.

51:22.100 --> 51:25.980
 Maybe the Middle East and the Chinese would disagree with you that you have better than

51:25.980 --> 51:27.820
 them, but yours are pretty good.

51:27.820 --> 51:34.620
 And the Panama Papers get released revealing all of your offshoring and your corruption,

51:34.620 --> 51:36.820
 and nothing happens, Lex.

51:36.820 --> 51:42.700
 So the first and most important consideration here is, in your own mind, you've been getting

51:42.700 --> 51:49.260
 away with murder, literally, as well as figuratively, and you think, you know, I probably can do

51:49.260 --> 51:52.420
 something again and get away with it.

51:52.420 --> 52:00.140
 And so the failure to respond at scale, in fact, the indulgences, the further dependencies

52:00.140 --> 52:08.340
 that are introduced, the illusion that trade is the mechanism to manage authoritarian regimes.

52:08.340 --> 52:16.700
 You know that great German clichÃ©, a Wandel durch Handel, right, change through trade

52:16.700 --> 52:22.620
 or transformation through trade, one of Angela Merkel's favorite expressions, right, you're

52:22.620 --> 52:27.420
 going to get the other side to be better.

52:27.420 --> 52:33.740
 Better than confront them in a Cold War fashion, where you stand up to their aggressions and

52:33.740 --> 52:37.780
 you punish them severely in order to deter further behavior.

52:37.780 --> 52:41.700
 So that's the first and most important part of the calculation, miscalculation.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.140
 There are a lot of other dimensions.

52:43.140 --> 52:46.020
 Can we pause on that really quick?

52:46.020 --> 52:52.500
 So this is kind of idea of it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, which is a more

52:52.500 --> 53:00.260
 generous description of what you're saying, that you don't incorporate into the calculation

53:00.260 --> 53:07.980
 the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause, but instead you look at sort of the

53:07.980 --> 53:16.100
 success based on some kind of measure for you personally and for the nation, not in terms

53:16.100 --> 53:21.460
 of in the humanitarian sense, but in some kind of economic sense and a power, geopolitical

53:21.460 --> 53:22.460
 power sense.

53:22.460 --> 53:23.460
 Yeah.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.740
 You're not sentimental, Lex.

53:25.740 --> 53:35.380
 You say to yourself, the cause of Russian greatness is greater than any individual life.

53:35.380 --> 53:43.300
 Russia being in the first rank of the great powers, Russia realizing its mission to be

53:43.300 --> 53:49.700
 a special country with a special mission in the world, a civilization unto itself, the

53:49.700 --> 53:54.180
 first rank of the great powers, maybe even the greatest power.

53:54.180 --> 54:01.100
 That's worth the price that we have to pay, especially in other people's lives.

54:01.100 --> 54:06.780
 We have a lot of literature on the Putin regime, which talks about the kleptocracy.

54:06.780 --> 54:11.540
 The place is a kleptocracy and it is a kleptocracy.

54:11.540 --> 54:19.060
 We all can see that and anybody in London live in the high life servicing this kleptocracy

54:19.060 --> 54:24.220
 can testify that it's a kleptocracy and not only in London, of course, right here in the

54:24.220 --> 54:30.980
 United States in New York, but it's not only a kleptocracy, Lex.

54:30.980 --> 54:35.100
 That was the problem of the Russian studies literature.

54:35.100 --> 54:38.780
 It wasn't just about stealing, looting the state.

54:38.780 --> 54:41.140
 It was about Russian greatness.

54:41.140 --> 54:47.820
 You see those rituals in the Kremlin, right in the Grand Kremlin Palace, in the St. George's

54:47.820 --> 54:52.300
 Hall, some of the greatest interiors in the world.

54:52.300 --> 54:58.580
 You see awards ceremonies and you see marking holidays and all of these looters of the state

54:58.580 --> 55:05.580
 have their uniforms on with their medals and someone's given a speech or singing a ballad

55:05.580 --> 55:08.580
 and their eyes are moist.

55:08.580 --> 55:12.500
 Their eyes are moist because they're thieves and looters.

55:12.500 --> 55:16.980
 No, Lex, because they believe in Russian greatness.

55:16.980 --> 55:24.540
 They have a deep and fundamental, passionate commitment to the greatness of Russia, which

55:24.540 --> 55:28.700
 in unsentimental fashion, they're all sentimental to the max.

55:28.700 --> 55:34.620
 That's why their eyes are moistening, but they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice

55:34.620 --> 55:41.540
 is okay, a sacrifice of other people's lives, a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military,

55:41.540 --> 55:46.100
 a sacrifice of Ukrainian women and children and elderly.

55:46.100 --> 55:52.140
 That's a small price to pay for those moist eyes about Russian greatness and Russia's

55:52.140 --> 55:53.340
 position in the world.

55:53.340 --> 55:57.340
 Well, that human thing, that sentimentality is the thing that can get us in trouble in

55:57.340 --> 56:02.660
 the United States as well and lead us to wars, illegal wars and so on.

56:02.660 --> 56:08.300
 But the United States, those are precautions for breaking the law.

56:08.300 --> 56:11.020
 You're going to pay for illegal wars in the end.

56:11.020 --> 56:17.780
 You're saying that in authoritarian regimes, the sentimentality can really get out of hand.

56:17.780 --> 56:23.580
 By charismatic leaders, they can take that to manipulate the populace to make that in

56:23.580 --> 56:30.300
 the span of history led to atrocities and in today's world lead to humanitarian crises.

56:30.300 --> 56:33.460
 It's not just the kleptocracy, it's a belief system.

56:33.460 --> 56:38.020
 It's passion, it's conviction.

56:38.020 --> 56:42.620
 You can call them illusions, you can call them fantasies, whatever you want to call

56:42.620 --> 56:44.260
 them, they're real.

56:44.260 --> 56:46.020
 They're real for those people.

56:46.020 --> 56:50.740
 And so, yes, they're looting that very state that they're trying to make one of the great

56:50.740 --> 56:52.500
 powers in the world.

56:52.500 --> 56:58.260
 And they resent the fact that the West doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers

56:58.260 --> 57:01.460
 and they resent that the West is more powerful.

57:01.460 --> 57:07.740
 People talk about how Putin doesn't understand the world and that he gets really bad information

57:07.740 --> 57:08.740
 from them.

57:08.740 --> 57:13.780
 Lex, if you're sitting there in that Kremlin and you're trying to conduct business in the

57:13.780 --> 57:19.780
 world and you're getting reports from your finance minister or your central bank governor,

57:19.780 --> 57:24.900
 your whole economy, everything that matters, somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars

57:24.900 --> 57:32.740
 and euros, do you have any illusions about who controls the international financial system?

57:32.740 --> 57:35.100
 I don't think so, Lex.

57:35.100 --> 57:40.580
 You're looking over your industrial plan for the next year and you're looking over how

57:40.580 --> 57:44.740
 many tanks you're going to get and how many cruise missiles you're going to get and how

57:44.740 --> 57:49.180
 many submarines you're going to get and fill in the blank.

57:49.180 --> 57:51.300
 And you know what?

57:51.300 --> 57:55.780
 It says right there in the paperwork where the component parts come from, where the software

57:55.780 --> 57:59.180
 comes from, comes from the West, Lex.

57:59.180 --> 58:06.140
 Your whole military industrial complex is dependent on high end Western technology.

58:06.140 --> 58:09.820
 And let's say you're in Beijing, not just in Moscow, and you go to a meeting in your

58:09.820 --> 58:16.940
 own neighborhood, you're the leader of China, you go to a meeting with other Asian leaders.

58:16.940 --> 58:19.620
 Do they all speak in Chinese with you?

58:19.620 --> 58:20.620
 No, Lex.

58:20.620 --> 58:22.900
 They don't speak Chinese.

58:22.900 --> 58:26.620
 You go to an international meeting as the leader of China and guess what language is

58:26.620 --> 58:29.340
 the main language of intercourse?

58:29.340 --> 58:33.180
 Yes, the same one you and I are speaking right now.

58:33.180 --> 58:34.860
 And so you live in that world.

58:34.860 --> 58:39.500
 You live in the Western world and it's very hard to have illusions about what world you

58:39.500 --> 58:42.300
 live in when you're under that pr...

58:42.300 --> 58:44.420
 You need those Western banks.

58:44.420 --> 58:46.900
 You need that foreign currency, right?

58:46.900 --> 58:51.220
 You need that high end Western technology, that technology transfer.

58:51.220 --> 58:55.540
 You're speaking or you're forced to speak or your minions are forced to speak at international

58:55.540 --> 58:57.780
 gatherings in English.

58:57.780 --> 59:03.100
 And I could go on all the indicators that you live in and so Putin lives in that world.

59:03.100 --> 59:04.100
 He's no fool.

59:04.100 --> 59:09.860
 Well, to push back, isn't it possible that, as you said, the minions operate in that

59:09.860 --> 59:15.660
 world, but can't you, if you're the leader of Russia or the leader of China or the leader

59:15.660 --> 59:23.300
 of these different nations, still put up walls where actually when you think in the privacy

59:23.300 --> 59:29.340
 of your own mind, you exist not in the international world, but in a world where there's this great

59:29.340 --> 59:32.620
 Russian empire or this great Chinese empire.

59:32.620 --> 59:34.420
 And then you forget that there's English.

59:34.420 --> 59:37.020
 You forget that there's technology and iPhones.

59:37.020 --> 59:43.660
 You forget that there's all of this US keeps popping up on all different paperwork.

59:43.660 --> 59:48.940
 That just becomes the blurry details that dissipate because what matters is the greatness

59:48.940 --> 59:54.140
 of this dream empire that I have in my mind as a dictator.

59:54.140 --> 1:00:02.860
 I would put it this way, Lex, after you absorb all of that from your minions and it impresses

1:00:02.860 --> 1:00:06.740
 upon your consciousness where you live.

1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:12.860
 You live in a Western dominated world that the multipolar world doesn't exist.

1:00:12.860 --> 1:00:16.420
 Your goal is to make that multipolar world exist.

1:00:16.420 --> 1:00:19.300
 Your goal is to bring down the West.

1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:22.100
 Your goal is for the West to weaken.

1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:26.140
 Your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro.

1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:30.380
 Your goal is an international financial system that you dominate.

1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:36.980
 Your goal is technological self sufficiency made in China 2035.

1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:42.500
 Your goal is a world that you dominate, not that the West dominates.

1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:48.540
 And you're going to do everything you can to try to attain that world, which is a Russian

1:00:48.540 --> 1:00:56.260
 centric world or a Chinese centric world or what we could call a Eurasian centric world.

1:00:56.260 --> 1:01:02.460
 And it's not going to be easy, Lex, just for the reasons that we enumerated before.

1:01:02.460 --> 1:01:05.020
 But maybe you're going to get a helping hand.

1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:08.020
 Maybe the West is going to transfer their best technology to you.

1:01:08.020 --> 1:01:12.060
 They're going to sell you their best stuff.

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:16.940
 And then you're going to absorb it and maybe copy it and reverse engineer it.

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:21.300
 And if they won't sell it to you, maybe you'll just have to steal it.

1:01:21.300 --> 1:01:28.060
 Maybe the West is going to allow you to bank even though you violate many laws that would

1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:32.820
 prohibit the West from extending those banking services to you.

1:01:32.820 --> 1:01:38.420
 Maybe the West is going to buy your energy and your palladium and your titanium and

1:01:38.420 --> 1:01:45.140
 your rare metals like lithium because you're willing to have your poor people mine that

1:01:45.140 --> 1:01:48.740
 stuff and die of disease at an early age.

1:01:48.740 --> 1:01:51.860
 But Western governments, they don't want to do that.

1:01:51.860 --> 1:01:56.540
 They don't want to do that dirty mining of those very important rare earths.

1:01:56.540 --> 1:02:00.020
 But you're willing to do that because it's just people whose lives you don't care about

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:01.540
 as an autocratic regime.

1:02:01.540 --> 1:02:07.460
 So that's the world you live in where you're trying to get to this other world.

1:02:07.460 --> 1:02:11.300
 Or at the center of the other world, you dominate the other world.

1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:18.740
 But the only way to get there, Lex, is the West has to weaken, divide itself, maybe

1:02:18.740 --> 1:02:20.820
 even collapse.

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:29.220
 And so you're encouraging to the extent possible, Western divisions, Western disunity, a Western

1:02:29.220 --> 1:02:37.740
 lack of resolve, Western mistakes and Western invasion of the wrong country and Western

1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:43.220
 destruction of its credibility through international financial crises.

1:02:43.220 --> 1:02:44.300
 One could go on.

1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:50.300
 So if the West weakens itself through its mistakes and its own corruption, you're going

1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:56.100
 to survive and maybe even come out into that world where you're the center.

1:02:56.100 --> 1:03:01.500
 And so Russia's entire grand strategy, just like China's grand strategy, Iran, it's hard

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:08.140
 to say they have a grand strategy because they're so profoundly weak.

1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:11.820
 But Russia's grand strategy is we're a mess.

1:03:11.820 --> 1:03:14.220
 We don't invest in our human capital.

1:03:14.220 --> 1:03:17.980
 Our human capital flees, or we actually drive it out.

1:03:17.980 --> 1:03:23.780
 It goes to MIT like you did, or it goes to fill in the blank, right?

1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:25.860
 We can't invest in our people.

1:03:25.860 --> 1:03:27.540
 Our health care is terrible.

1:03:27.540 --> 1:03:30.660
 Our education system is in decline.

1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:33.500
 We don't build infrastructure lacks.

1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:36.100
 We don't improve our governance.

1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:42.100
 We don't invest in those attributes of modern power that make the West powerful.

1:03:42.100 --> 1:03:46.260
 We can't because when we try, the money is stolen.

1:03:46.260 --> 1:03:50.900
 We try these grandiose projects of national projects they're called.

1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:52.380
 We're going to invest in higher ed.

1:03:52.380 --> 1:03:54.620
 We're going to invest in high tech.

1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:58.860
 We're going to build our own Silicon Valley known as Skolkovo.

1:03:58.860 --> 1:04:01.540
 We're going to do all those things in what happens.

1:04:01.540 --> 1:04:04.780
 They can't even build an airport without the money disappearing.

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:11.180
 The Sochi Olympic selects officially cost them $50 billion.

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:17.220
 You look around at the infrastructure that endured from that $50 billion expense.

1:04:17.220 --> 1:04:21.020
 And you're thinking, you know, that's like the Second Avenue subway.

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:23.980
 You get almost nothing for your money.

1:04:23.980 --> 1:04:28.700
 And so, yeah, it's corruption lacks, but it's also because they don't want to do that.

1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:31.340
 They don't want to invest in their people.

1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:33.620
 They couldn't do it if they wanted to.

1:04:33.620 --> 1:04:36.340
 And when they try, it doesn't work.

1:04:36.340 --> 1:04:39.580
 But why invest in your own people?

1:04:39.580 --> 1:04:47.820
 Invest in your hardware, your military hardware, invest in your cyber capabilities.

1:04:47.820 --> 1:04:56.420
 Invest in all your spoilation techniques and your hard power, and invest in further corrupting

1:04:56.420 --> 1:05:00.460
 and further weakening and further dividing the West.

1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:06.180
 Because as I said, if the West is weak, divided, lacking resolve, you don't invest in your

1:05:06.180 --> 1:05:07.180
 people.

1:05:07.180 --> 1:05:08.380
 You don't build infrastructure.

1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:11.780
 You don't improve your governance, but you'll muddle through.

1:05:11.780 --> 1:05:13.660
 That's Russian grand strategy.

1:05:13.660 --> 1:05:18.300
 So invest in the hard power, weaken the West.

1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:24.740
 Those combined together means you're going to be civilly incentivized to escalate any

1:05:24.740 --> 1:05:30.380
 military aggressive conflicts that are around you or create new ones or just...

1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:32.700
 If you can get away with murder.

1:05:32.700 --> 1:05:37.940
 But what happens, Lex, if it's a Harry Truman like response?

1:05:37.940 --> 1:05:43.180
 What happens if somebody says, you know, we're going to stand up to this?

1:05:43.180 --> 1:05:45.500
 We're not going to allow this to happen.

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:49.180
 We're not going to launder your money anymore.

1:05:49.180 --> 1:05:53.180
 We're not going to be dependent on you for energy in the long term.

1:05:53.180 --> 1:05:56.180
 We're going to make a transition.

1:05:56.180 --> 1:05:59.980
 We're going to punish you for that kind of behavior instead.

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:09.180
 And the West is now switched to that only because of the courage and ingenuity of the

1:06:09.180 --> 1:06:10.860
 Ukrainian people.

1:06:10.860 --> 1:06:18.340
 The Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression was one of the greatest gifts the West has

1:06:18.340 --> 1:06:20.060
 ever received.

1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:28.460
 The sacrifices that the Ukrainians are making right now as we speak, meaning they're fighting

1:06:28.460 --> 1:06:36.380
 a war by themselves against a major military power, their neighbor Russia.

1:06:36.380 --> 1:06:38.060
 Nobody's fighting it with them.

1:06:38.060 --> 1:06:43.900
 Yes, we are giving them weapons so they can conduct self defense, which, by the way, is

1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:46.940
 legal under international law.

1:06:46.940 --> 1:06:52.260
 Unlike the Russian invasion, which is illegal under international law, Western supply of

1:06:52.260 --> 1:06:57.940
 weapons, including heavy weapons, including offensive weapons to Ukraine for its self defense

1:06:57.940 --> 1:07:01.420
 in the invasion by Russia is actually legal under...

1:07:01.420 --> 1:07:08.300
 And so, thank God, the Ukrainians surprised everybody.

1:07:08.300 --> 1:07:09.500
 They surprised me.

1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.140
 They surprised Putin and the Kremlin.

1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:13.140
 They surprised the Biden administration.

1:07:13.140 --> 1:07:18.920
 They surprised the European Union, not with the fact that they would resist.

1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:20.500
 We knew that.

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:23.460
 We had the Orange Revolution in 2004.

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:32.060
 We had Maidan in 2013, 14, where they rose up against a domestic tyrant, and they were

1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:38.020
 willing to die on behalf of their country then, let alone against a foreign tyrant invading

1:07:38.020 --> 1:07:39.660
 their country, right?

1:07:39.660 --> 1:07:40.860
 So we knew they would resist.

1:07:40.860 --> 1:07:46.140
 We didn't know just how successful, certainly I didn't know, they would be on the battlefield.

1:07:46.140 --> 1:07:48.460
 It's been breathtaking to watch.

1:07:48.460 --> 1:07:55.860
 That sacrifice, that gift enabled the West to rediscover itself, to rediscover its power,

1:07:55.860 --> 1:08:00.940
 to revive itself, to say, to hell with this energy dependence in the long term, to hell

1:08:00.940 --> 1:08:05.300
 with this money laundering and reputation laundering, to hell with this running back

1:08:05.300 --> 1:08:11.780
 and forth to Moscow to try to see what Putin needs in order for him to feel respected, what

1:08:11.780 --> 1:08:13.820
 appeasement he needs, right?

1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:21.060
 So we'll see if it endures, but this shift comes from the Ukrainians.

1:08:21.060 --> 1:08:25.660
 And so it's no longer getting away with murder, Lex, and we thank the Ukrainians for that.

1:08:25.660 --> 1:08:33.940
 The people and the leadership and the separate factions that make up Ukraine uniting, it's

1:08:33.940 --> 1:08:40.820
 the unification, the uniting against the common enemy is standing up before anyone knew that

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:44.860
 they would be backed by all of these other nations, by this money and all this kind of

1:08:44.860 --> 1:08:50.780
 stuff, standing there, especially with the president Zelensky, where it makes total

1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:54.620
 sense to flee, he stood his ground.

1:08:54.620 --> 1:08:58.740
 Let's take that point that you just raised, which is a deep and fundamental point, and

1:08:58.740 --> 1:09:00.900
 I thank you for that.

1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:01.900
 Do you guys hear that?

1:09:01.900 --> 1:09:03.140
 I think that was a compliment.

1:09:03.140 --> 1:09:04.140
 There we go.

1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:05.140
 Let's go.

1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:06.140
 Lex.

1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:07.140
 Zelensky unification.

1:09:07.140 --> 1:09:08.700
 I'm sitting here in front of you.

1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:09.700
 Thank you.

1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:10.700
 It's an honor.

1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:13.460
 It's a mutual honor.

1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:20.740
 So Ukraine before the war is run by a TV production company, right?

1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:24.660
 You're one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast.

1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:30.700
 There's 20 guys or so running a country the size of Ukraine, and one's a producer and one's

1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:38.820
 like a makeup person and one's a video editor and they're fantastically talented people.

1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:42.220
 If your country is a TV production.

1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:48.020
 So before the war, Zelensky had what, 25% approval rating, and he couldn't get much

1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:50.380
 done and it wasn't working.

1:09:50.380 --> 1:09:54.660
 He got elected with 73%, as you know, and then he was down to 20.

1:09:54.660 --> 1:09:56.860
 That's a pretty big drop.

1:09:56.860 --> 1:10:04.460
 And so you're thinking maybe having a major, large size, 40 million plus population European

1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:09.960
 country run by a TV production company is not the best choice.

1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:11.660
 And then what do we see?

1:10:11.660 --> 1:10:18.980
 We see President Zelensky decides to risk his life on behalf of his country, Ukraine.

1:10:18.980 --> 1:10:21.940
 He decides to stay in the capital.

1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:23.980
 He's not going to flee.

1:10:23.980 --> 1:10:25.780
 They're going to stay and fight.

1:10:25.780 --> 1:10:26.980
 And he could be killed.

1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:27.980
 He can die.

1:10:27.980 --> 1:10:31.460
 It's a decision where he put his life on the line.

1:10:31.460 --> 1:10:42.460
 Obviously, he's Jewish descent, Russian speaking childhood and upbringing, Russian speaking Jewish

1:10:42.460 --> 1:10:45.980
 descent puts his life on the line for the country of Ukraine.

1:10:45.980 --> 1:10:49.780
 It's a pretty big message, don't you think?

1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:51.500
 And it's crucial.

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:56.820
 And it turns out not only that Lex, but they're good at TV.

1:10:56.820 --> 1:10:59.100
 They're good at information war.

1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:04.780
 And in a war, it's a TV production company and a TV personality.

1:11:04.780 --> 1:11:10.500
 That's exactly what you want running a country because they're crushing in the information

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:11.500
 war.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:19.060
 And he's spectacular, European parliament, US Congress, Israeli parliament.

1:11:19.060 --> 1:11:24.740
 There's no room on Zoom, let alone in person, that he can't win over.

1:11:24.740 --> 1:11:26.660
 He's just so effective.

1:11:26.660 --> 1:11:33.820
 This is the first time reality TV has been about reality instead of fake.

1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:37.140
 Reality TV is just this completely fake nonsense.

1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:41.700
 But Zelensky, this is real reality TV.

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:43.580
 And he means it.

1:11:43.580 --> 1:11:46.100
 And the nation is behind him.

1:11:46.100 --> 1:11:50.420
 And they're just as courageous and just as ingenious in many ways.

1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:52.580
 And it's spectacular.

1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:55.500
 And so, yeah, who saw that coming?

1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:57.820
 I didn't see that coming, Lex.

1:11:57.820 --> 1:12:01.340
 In fact, the Biden, we talk about Putin's miscalculation.

1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:06.780
 The Biden administration, as you alluded to, offered him an exit from the country.

1:12:06.780 --> 1:12:10.660
 They didn't say, you know, you want to stand and fight, we'll back you.

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:12.620
 They said, we'll get you out.

1:12:12.620 --> 1:12:14.180
 You want to come now?

1:12:14.180 --> 1:12:16.980
 And famously, you know that quote, right?

1:12:16.980 --> 1:12:21.020
 What he said about how he doesn't need a ride.

1:12:21.020 --> 1:12:22.780
 Remember that moment?

1:12:22.780 --> 1:12:29.060
 The Biden administration was poised to do another Afghanistan moment.

1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:36.020
 That ignominious exit from Afghanistan was almost what happened in Ukraine when Biden

1:12:36.020 --> 1:12:39.940
 administration offered him that ride out of there.

1:12:39.940 --> 1:12:46.020
 And fortunately, he declined and helped rally in the people from below also rallied to stop

1:12:46.020 --> 1:12:51.340
 the invader without the presidency and without the government in Ukraine.

1:12:51.340 --> 1:12:56.540
 Including the Biden administration and the European leaders who latched on.

1:12:56.540 --> 1:13:02.460
 Fortunately, they had the presence of mind to latch on to this gift, this bravery and

1:13:02.460 --> 1:13:08.140
 ingeniousness of Zelensky and the rest of the Ukrainians, and flipped and decided to

1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:15.980
 support Ukraine's resistance, you know, first with 5,000 helmets only, as the Germans initially

1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:16.980
 promised.

1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:22.780
 Now with really heavy weapons, and so that's something that wasn't foreseen.

1:13:22.780 --> 1:13:24.620
 I certainly didn't foresee that.

1:13:24.620 --> 1:13:30.340
 I foresaw the Ukrainian society being courageous and resisting.

1:13:30.340 --> 1:13:36.740
 But I didn't foresee a television production company being exactly what you want to run

1:13:36.740 --> 1:13:44.820
 a country in a war, a president Zelensky willing to sacrifice, lay down his life and rallying

1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:47.380
 others in the country to do that.

1:13:47.380 --> 1:13:55.340
 And then the country being so effective, not just at courage, but at battlefield resistance

1:13:55.340 --> 1:13:57.060
 to the Russian invasion.

1:13:57.060 --> 1:14:03.620
 So I stand corrected by the Ukrainians, and I'm ecstatic that I was wrong, that I was

1:14:03.620 --> 1:14:04.620
 proven wrong.

1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:09.580
 And like I said, there's clear factions of the West and the East of Ukraine, and here's

1:14:09.580 --> 1:14:16.820
 a person that, like you said, was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage approval in the country

1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:22.220
 before the war, and now was able to use in the 90s.

1:14:22.220 --> 1:14:24.780
 He's in the 90% approval rating.

1:14:24.780 --> 1:14:30.380
 I mean, I think they stopped doing the polling.

1:14:30.380 --> 1:14:34.740
 Once he hit 91% or whatever it was in the previous poll, I think they all understood

1:14:34.740 --> 1:14:39.780
 that for now they didn't need any more polling, that it's pretty clear the nation.

1:14:39.780 --> 1:14:44.060
 So 25% to 90 something percent.

1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:49.900
 And just like the 25% was deserved, the 90 something percent is also deserved, fully

1:14:49.900 --> 1:14:50.900
 deserved.

1:14:50.900 --> 1:14:53.420
 And the question is how that all stabilizes.

1:14:53.420 --> 1:15:02.540
 It feels like this set of events, I may be paying attention to Twitter too much, which

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:11.580
 is a concern of mine, whether the change I see is just surface level or deep level.

1:15:11.580 --> 1:15:17.020
 But it seems like we're in a new world, that something dramatic has shifted.

1:15:17.020 --> 1:15:26.100
 That this power that's rooted, I mean, in your study of the 20th century is so deeply

1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:32.380
 rooted in history, there's this power center of the world is now going to, has been shaken

1:15:32.380 --> 1:15:33.820
 by this event.

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:38.020
 And how that changes the world is unclear.

1:15:38.020 --> 1:15:42.060
 It's unclear what lesson China learns from watching this, what lesson India learns from

1:15:42.060 --> 1:15:43.340
 watching this.

1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:49.200
 Both nations, as far as you can get polls about Chinese population, but both nations

1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:51.920
 are largely in support of Putin.

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:57.380
 So Russia, India and China are still supporting of Putin quietly.

1:15:57.380 --> 1:16:03.340
 I would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, Lex.

1:16:03.340 --> 1:16:10.460
 I think you're right, the feeling that we're in an inflection moment, an inflection point,

1:16:10.460 --> 1:16:12.580
 I think that's widespread.

1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:16.540
 And I think it's widespread for good reason, we might be.

1:16:16.540 --> 1:16:27.860
 But I also share your, let's say, modesty about where it's going and how hard it is to predict

1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:29.700
 where this might go.

1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:36.180
 It's only an inflection point if the trends continue, right, if the trends endure.

1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:39.260
 There are plenty of non inflection points.

1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:45.140
 After 9 11, the whole world rallied around the United States after it was attacked, after

1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:51.340
 the bombing of the towers here in New York City and the hitting of the Pentagon.

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:53.300
 And that didn't last.

1:16:53.300 --> 1:16:56.660
 It was not really an inflection point, was it?

1:16:56.660 --> 1:16:59.740
 It felt like it might be, but it wasn't.

1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:06.500
 And so this is not a comparable moment in terms of what happened, but it has the feeling

1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:09.620
 that it might be a watershed.

1:17:09.620 --> 1:17:18.260
 And maybe we'll squander it the way we squandered the post 9 11 rallying around the United States.

1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:24.300
 Maybe we'll actually consolidate it and it'll endure or maybe it'll endure despite ourselves.

1:17:24.300 --> 1:17:26.900
 And we can't tell and we can't know yet.

1:17:26.900 --> 1:17:30.660
 And it depends in part on what we do and what we don't do.

1:17:30.660 --> 1:17:35.940
 But here's a few things that we understand already.

1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:43.340
 The idea that the West was in decline and that the rest of the world had risen and was

1:17:43.340 --> 1:17:51.140
 more powerful and that we lived in a multipolar world, that turns out to be empirically false.

1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:52.140
 It's not true.

1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:55.420
 I mean, it's just factually not true.

1:17:55.420 --> 1:18:03.220
 There are no major important multinational institutions, organizations that are run on

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:11.700
 behalf of or led by a South African, a Nigerian person from India.

1:18:11.700 --> 1:18:14.900
 Even the Chinese don't run these institutions.

1:18:14.900 --> 1:18:19.380
 They would like to and they're trying, but they don't.

1:18:19.380 --> 1:18:26.780
 And so whatever you pick, the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, which is the most

1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:31.700
 powerful multinational institution, which is actually only a domestic institution and

1:18:31.700 --> 1:18:39.620
 doesn't have a legal mandate to act multilaterally, but does, it's got the most power of any institution

1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:51.140
 in the world, NATO, the bilateral alliances that the U.S. has up and down Asia, what organizations

1:18:51.140 --> 1:19:00.260
 that have tremendous leverage on the international system, on the international order are nonwestern.

1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:07.320
 The U.N. is the most encompassing and of course we know that the five, it has five members

1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:12.500
 of the Security Council with a veto, one of which is Russia, one of which is China and

1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:22.500
 the others are the U.S., Britain and France, not India, not South Africa, not Indonesia,

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:27.100
 not all of these other countries where the people live, right, the bulk of the population

1:19:27.100 --> 1:19:32.300
 of the world and where the population is growing like on the African continent.

1:19:32.300 --> 1:19:34.580
 So it's not a multipolar world.

1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:38.140
 We talked already about the international financial system.

1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:40.340
 That's the Western, not multipolar.

1:19:40.340 --> 1:19:45.100
 We talked about the U.S. military and NATO, or we could talk about the Japanese military,

1:19:45.100 --> 1:19:50.220
 which is just very formidable, enormous number of platforms.

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:54.300
 Even the Australian military, we could talk about that, right?

1:19:54.300 --> 1:19:57.820
 And so it's a Western dominated world.

1:19:57.820 --> 1:20:03.860
 And the West, remember, is not a geographic concept, it is an institutional and values

1:20:03.860 --> 1:20:06.620
 club.

1:20:06.620 --> 1:20:10.180
 The Japanese are not European, but they're Western.

1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:16.900
 Just like Russia is European, but not Western, because European is a cultural category and

1:20:16.900 --> 1:20:22.500
 Western is an institutional category where you have rule of law and separation of powers

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:28.340
 and free and open public sphere and dynamic open market economy and, okay.

1:20:28.340 --> 1:20:31.380
 And then we have another thing, which is pretty clear.

1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:38.900
 The West is powerfully resented, powerfully envied and admired simultaneously.

1:20:38.900 --> 1:20:48.460
 PJ O. Rourke, the comedian who died this year, fantastic, it was a big loss for the culture.

1:20:48.460 --> 1:20:55.060
 He said there are two things that are always characteristic of any American embassy abroad.

1:20:55.060 --> 1:21:02.500
 One is a political protest outside, and the other is the longest line you've ever seen

1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:05.500
 for visas.

1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:11.100
 And those things are true simultaneously, and that's the world we live in, meaning that

1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:19.460
 non Western countries envy and admire the West, but they also resent the power of the

1:21:19.460 --> 1:21:22.980
 West, Western hypocrisy, right?

1:21:22.980 --> 1:21:30.420
 The West invades countries when it wants, but when others do that, it's illegal, right?

1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:39.500
 The West arrests you for money laundering, but it's Western money laundering that is

1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:41.820
 where you go when you need to launder money, right?

1:21:41.820 --> 1:21:50.740
 So they see the hypocrisy, they see the excessive power that the West has, and they resent it,

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:56.300
 and they say, who elected you to run the world?

1:21:56.300 --> 1:22:03.460
 We have a billion plus people, or we have a 200 plus million people, and we don't have

1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:09.780
 a say, you're the self appointed guardians of our world, who did that?

1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:17.220
 And so it's incumbent on the West not only to remember the power that it has, but also

1:22:17.220 --> 1:22:25.220
 to exercise that power legally and with restraint, and also to think about how we can expand

1:22:25.220 --> 1:22:32.700
 institutions to be more encompassing so that other parts of the world are not on the outside

1:22:32.700 --> 1:22:39.580
 being dictated to, but instead are on the inside.

1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:49.940
 Too often, Western power is not consultative in a decision making fashion.

1:22:49.940 --> 1:22:52.260
 It's consultative after the fact.

1:22:52.260 --> 1:22:58.620
 Okay, we got together in the EU, or we got together in NATO, or we got together at the

1:22:58.620 --> 1:23:03.940
 Federal Reserve, and here's our decision, and we're announcing it today.

1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:08.580
 And so your economy gets destroyed because the Federal Reserve decides it has to raise

1:23:08.580 --> 1:23:16.580
 interest rates, or you now go into default, you can't pay your debt because Western banks

1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:26.060
 lent you money, and now the West has changed interest rates or other considerations, and

1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:27.820
 you're in big trouble now.

1:23:27.820 --> 1:23:32.260
 And so this is something which we fail to address.

1:23:32.260 --> 1:23:33.500
 It's very hard to address.

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:37.060
 It's very hard to reform international institutions.

1:23:37.060 --> 1:23:39.940
 It's very hard to share power.

1:23:39.940 --> 1:23:45.500
 It's very hard to acknowledge that you have too much power, and that maybe having too

1:23:45.500 --> 1:23:51.340
 much power is not good, not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself.

1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:57.420
 And so it's great to rediscover the West and rediscover its values and rediscover it's

1:23:57.420 --> 1:24:03.060
 authority and credibility and power, but that's not sufficient.

1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:04.740
 So we know this now.

1:24:04.740 --> 1:24:12.260
 We know that the rest of the world is not necessarily jumping on the Western bandwagon

1:24:12.260 --> 1:24:18.780
 to condemn Russia for its actions, because the West can do things like sanction your

1:24:18.780 --> 1:24:24.700
 central bank, take away your reserves, deny you technology.

1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:29.020
 It pretty much can do whatever it wants, and it can say that it's legal, and it can

1:24:29.020 --> 1:24:35.020
 go through various mechanisms, and it can freeze your property, and you say to yourself,

1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:40.460
 should anybody have that much power, and when do they come after me?

1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:47.660
 Now there's a caveat here, and the caveat, Lex, is they don't like the West having all

1:24:47.660 --> 1:24:54.060
 of that power, and they didn't join in the condemnation of Russia.

1:24:54.060 --> 1:24:59.020
 But they also didn't join in Russia's aggression.

1:24:59.020 --> 1:25:09.300
 So Russia's domestic civilian airspace, aircraft industry, civilian aircraft industry is in

1:25:09.300 --> 1:25:17.420
 big trouble now because of the export controls on spare parts and software.

1:25:17.420 --> 1:25:22.740
 Brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing.

1:25:22.740 --> 1:25:30.780
 So they rush in and say, you know, Vladimir Putin, we didn't condemn necessarily your actions

1:25:30.780 --> 1:25:31.780
 in Ukraine.

1:25:31.780 --> 1:25:33.340
 Okay, that's one thing.

1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:40.340
 And how about we give you all of our aircraft technology, and we help you rebuild your domestic

1:25:40.340 --> 1:25:45.860
 aircraft industry, and you can have the aviation that the West is, did that happen, Lex?

1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:47.500
 Didn't happen.

1:25:47.500 --> 1:25:51.540
 And you can look at India, and you can look at China, and you can look at South Africa,

1:25:51.540 --> 1:25:55.060
 and you can look at what they've done in practical terms.

1:25:55.060 --> 1:26:00.180
 Yes, they haven't always joined in a full throated condemnation.

1:26:00.180 --> 1:26:04.700
 Maybe they've been neutral, or maybe they've been playing both sides of the fence, like

1:26:04.700 --> 1:26:07.380
 Turkey, for example.

1:26:07.380 --> 1:26:14.620
 But are they rushing in to join Russia, to join Russia's aggression, to supply, and

1:26:14.620 --> 1:26:16.740
 the answer is no.

1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:18.980
 And the answer is no for two reasons.

1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:22.900
 One, they actually don't want to be party to that.

1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:28.140
 And two, they understand that Western power, and they don't want to be on the receiving

1:26:28.140 --> 1:26:35.740
 end by crossing the West and then getting caught up in a sanctions regime or worse.

1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:38.020
 Can we go to the mind of Vladimir Putin?

1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:46.180
 Because what you just said, China, India, they seem to sit back and say, we're not going

1:26:46.180 --> 1:26:51.340
 to condemn the actions of Vladimir Putin or Russia, but we would really like for this

1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:53.540
 war to be over.

1:26:53.540 --> 1:26:59.060
 So there's that kind of energy of, we don't just stop this because you're putting us in

1:26:59.060 --> 1:27:00.740
 a very, very bad position.

1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:05.340
 And yet, Vladimir Putin is continuing the aggression.

1:27:05.340 --> 1:27:06.620
 What is he thinking?

1:27:06.620 --> 1:27:08.660
 What information is he getting?

1:27:08.660 --> 1:27:13.420
 Is it the system that you've described of authoritarian regimes that corrupts your flow

1:27:13.420 --> 1:27:19.540
 of information, your ability to make clearheaded decisions, just as a human being when you

1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:21.700
 go to sleep at night?

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:27.380
 Is he not able to see the world clearly, or is this all deliberate systematic action

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:31.300
 that does have some reason behind it?

1:27:31.300 --> 1:27:37.700
 We got to talk a little bit about China too, but let's answer your Putin question directly.

1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:44.980
 So on Twitter, you've lost the war, or as they say, there are these two Russian soldiers

1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:51.420
 having a smoke in Warsaw, and they're taking a break, having a smoke, and they're sitting

1:27:51.420 --> 1:27:56.900
 there in Warsaw on top of their tank, and one says to the other, yeah, we lost the information

1:27:56.900 --> 1:28:03.460
 war, and there they are sitting in Warsaw having that smoke, right?

1:28:03.460 --> 1:28:07.180
 So yeah, on Twitter, Russia has completely lost the war.

1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:12.900
 In reality, they failed to take Kiev, they failed to capture Kiev, and they failed in

1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:21.500
 phase two, as they called it, or plan B, which is to capture the entirety of the Donbass.

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.580
 We're three months into the war.

1:28:23.580 --> 1:28:28.420
 If you had made a judgment about, let's say, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, a definitive

1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:32.980
 judgment after three months, you might have got the outcome wrong there.

1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:40.140
 If you had judged the Winter War, the 1939-'40 Soviet invasion of Finland after three months,

1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:43.220
 you would have got that wrong too of what the outcome was going to be.

1:28:43.220 --> 1:28:49.980
 So we're early in the game here, and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments.

1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:55.340
 But it is the case that so far, they failed to take Kiev, and they failed to capture the

1:28:55.340 --> 1:28:57.660
 entirety of the Donbass.

1:28:57.660 --> 1:29:05.660
 Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, eastern Ukraine, a part of eastern Ukraine.

1:29:05.660 --> 1:29:13.500
 And they've been driven out of Kharkiv and the area immediately surrounding Kharkiv.

1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:18.380
 They never captured Kharkiv, but they came close, but now the Ukrainians drove them back

1:29:18.380 --> 1:29:22.140
 to the Russian border in that very large and important region.

1:29:22.140 --> 1:29:29.340
 So those look like battlefield losses that are impossible to explain away if you're the

1:29:29.340 --> 1:29:33.820
 regime in Russia, except by suppression of information.

1:29:33.820 --> 1:29:40.860
 And as you know from Russian history, like leaders in Russia have an easier time with

1:29:40.860 --> 1:29:49.460
 a state of siege and deprivation than they do with explaining a lost war.

1:29:49.460 --> 1:29:56.340
 But let's look at some other facts that are important to take into account.

1:29:56.340 --> 1:30:05.900
 One, the Russian army has penetrated further into Ukrainian territory since February 2022,

1:30:05.900 --> 1:30:14.020
 including in Herson region, the famous Mariupol siege that just ended.

1:30:14.020 --> 1:30:26.380
 They have built a large presence in areas north of Crimea on the Sea of Azov, the Black

1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:31.100
 Sea latoral ultimately, that they didn't previously hold.

1:30:31.100 --> 1:30:38.660
 They're still fighting in Luhansk for full control over at least half of the Donbass,

1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:41.500
 and Ukrainians are resisting fiercely.

1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:49.460
 But nonetheless, you can say that they've been driven out on the contrary, farther penetration

1:30:49.460 --> 1:30:51.900
 than the beginning.

1:30:51.900 --> 1:30:54.740
 Ukraine doesn't have any economy anymore.

1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:58.420
 They have somewhere between 33 and 50% unemployment.

1:30:58.420 --> 1:31:04.060
 It's hard to measure unemployment in a war economy, but they're a metallurgical industry

1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:11.340
 that Azov style steel plant in Mariupol is a ruin now.

1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:15.740
 And a lot of farmers are not planting the fields because the harvest from the previous

1:31:15.740 --> 1:31:24.460
 year still hasn't been sent, sold abroad because the ports are blockaded or destroyed.

1:31:24.460 --> 1:31:29.820
 And so you don't have any economy, and you need $5 billion or $7 billion or $8 billion

1:31:29.820 --> 1:31:39.060
 a month to meet your payroll, to feed your people, to keep your army in the field, that's

1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:41.580
 a lot of money per month.

1:31:41.580 --> 1:31:43.180
 And that's indefinite.

1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:46.080
 That's as long as this blockade lasts.

1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:49.420
 And so you don't have any economy anymore, you're indigent.

1:31:49.420 --> 1:31:54.620
 And even if you take the lower number, $5 billion as opposed to Zelensky's ask for $7

1:31:54.620 --> 1:31:58.060
 billion, $5 billion is $60 billion a year.

1:31:58.060 --> 1:32:01.820
 That's $60 billion this year, that's $60 billion next year.

1:32:01.820 --> 1:32:03.700
 And so who's got that kind of money?

1:32:03.700 --> 1:32:06.460
 Which Western taxpayers are ready?

1:32:06.460 --> 1:32:14.380
 If you use the $7 billion or $8 billion, you get up to $100 billion a year.

1:32:14.380 --> 1:32:22.820
 President Joe Biden just signed the bill making it law, $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.

1:32:22.820 --> 1:32:25.660
 It's just an enormous sum.

1:32:25.660 --> 1:32:33.500
 The economic piece of that is a month and a half, two months of Ukrainians covering

1:32:33.500 --> 1:32:35.620
 Ukrainian expenditures.

1:32:35.620 --> 1:32:36.700
 That's it.

1:32:36.700 --> 1:32:40.140
 And they're asking the G7, they're asking everybody for this.

1:32:40.140 --> 1:32:45.740
 So you have no economy and no prospect of an economy until you evict the Russians from

1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:47.980
 your territory.

1:32:47.980 --> 1:32:56.180
 And then you have a Western unity, Western resolve, it lasts or it doesn't last, Lex.

1:32:56.180 --> 1:33:02.860
 So you're President Putin, and you've got more territory than before, and you've got

1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:10.140
 a stranglehold over the Ukrainian economy, and you've got a lot of the world neutral,

1:33:10.140 --> 1:33:17.380
 and you've got the Chinese propaganda supporting you to the hilt with those Oliver Stone and

1:33:17.380 --> 1:33:23.540
 Mir Sharma lines about how this is really NATO's fault.

1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:30.180
 And you've got Hungary dragging its feet on the oil embargo against Russia, and you've

1:33:30.180 --> 1:33:36.340
 got Turkey dragging its feet on the recent applications of Sweden and Finland for NATO

1:33:36.340 --> 1:33:37.340
 expand.

1:33:37.340 --> 1:33:41.180
 And you're saying to yourself, Lex, maybe I can ride this out.

1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:45.660
 I got a lot of problems of my own, and we can go into the details on the Russian side's

1:33:45.660 --> 1:33:54.460
 challenges, but he's on Ukrainian territory unless he's evicted, and he's got a stranglehold

1:33:54.460 --> 1:34:02.340
 on their economy, and he's got the possibility that the West doesn't stay resolved and doesn't

1:34:02.340 --> 1:34:08.220
 continue to pay for Ukraine's economy or supply those heavy weapons.

1:34:08.220 --> 1:34:13.660
 And so you could argue that maybe he's deluded about all of this, and maybe he should go

1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:14.660
 on Twitter.

1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:18.300
 You know, I'm not on Twitter, but maybe Putin, who famously doesn't use the internet, should

1:34:18.300 --> 1:34:21.180
 go on Twitter and see he's losing the war.

1:34:21.180 --> 1:34:28.060
 Or you can argue that maybe he's calculating here that he's got a chance to still prevail.

1:34:28.060 --> 1:34:33.500
 Wow, that is darkly insightful.

1:34:33.500 --> 1:34:40.820
 If I could go to Henry Kissinger for a brief moment, and people should read this op ed

1:34:40.820 --> 1:34:48.380
 he wrote in the Washington Post in March 5th, 2014, after the start of the war between Russia

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:55.300
 and Ukraine, but before Crimea was annexed, there's a lot of interesting historical description

1:34:55.300 --> 1:35:01.580
 about the division within Ukraine, the corruption within Ukraine, that will, if people read

1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:07.340
 this article, will give context to how incredible it is, what Zelensky was able to accomplish

1:35:07.340 --> 1:35:08.620
 in uniting the country.

1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:13.900
 But I just want to comment, because Henry Kissinger is an interesting figure in American

1:35:13.900 --> 1:35:20.340
 history, he opens the article with, in my life, I have seen four wars begun with great

1:35:20.340 --> 1:35:26.100
 enthusiasm and public support, all of which we did not know how to end, and from three

1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:29.860
 of which we withdrew unilaterally.

1:35:29.860 --> 1:35:35.540
 The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.

1:35:35.540 --> 1:35:42.780
 So he's giving this cold hard truth that we get, we go into wars excited, are able to

1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:53.620
 send $40 billion financial aid, military aid, our own men and women, but the excitement fades,

1:35:53.620 --> 1:36:03.060
 Twitter outrage fades, and then a country that's willing to wait patiently is willing to pay

1:36:03.060 --> 1:36:09.020
 the cost of siege versus the cost of explaining to its own people that the war is lost, that

1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:12.660
 country just might win, outlast.

1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:21.420
 Let's hope not, because the Ukrainians resistance deserves to prevail here.

1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:23.580
 Russia deserves to lose.

1:36:23.580 --> 1:36:28.900
 No war of aggression, like they've committed here against Ukraine, should prevail if we

1:36:28.900 --> 1:36:30.660
 can do anything about it.

1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:38.100
 I support a thousand percent the continued supply of heavy weapons, including offensive

1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:44.620
 weapons to the Ukrainians, as long as they're willing to resist, and it's their choice,

1:36:44.620 --> 1:36:48.940
 it's their choice when to negotiate, it's their choice how much to resist, it's their

1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:56.740
 choice what kind of sacrifices to make, and it's our responsibility to meet their requests

1:36:56.740 --> 1:37:01.820
 more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale.

1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:07.700
 But ultimately wars only have political ends, they never have military ends.

1:37:07.700 --> 1:37:10.420
 You need a political solution here.

1:37:10.420 --> 1:37:20.500
 So if the Ukrainians are able to conduct a successful counter offensive at scale in

1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:26.740
 July or August whenever they launch, right now the heavy weapons are coming in and they're

1:37:26.740 --> 1:37:32.260
 being moved to the battlefield and more are coming, you know the dynamic, Russia bombs

1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:38.900
 a school, Russia bombs a hospital, Americans and Europeans decide to send even more heavy

1:37:38.900 --> 1:37:43.900
 weapons to Ukraine, right, that's the self defeating dynamic from the Russian side.

1:37:43.900 --> 1:37:48.580
 They commit the atrocities, we send more heavy weapons.

1:37:48.580 --> 1:37:53.860
 Once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines, we'll see if Ukrainians cannot just

1:37:53.860 --> 1:38:00.380
 defend, which they've proven they're able to do in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct

1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:08.020
 counter attacks, where the enemy moves forward and you cut behind the enemy's lines, and

1:38:08.020 --> 1:38:12.660
 you counter attack and push the enemy back a little bit.

1:38:12.660 --> 1:38:20.580
 But whether you can evict the Russians from your territory with a combined arms operation,

1:38:20.580 --> 1:38:26.980
 where you have a massive superiority in infantry and heavy weapons, but more importantly, you

1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:34.580
 coordinate your air power, your tanks, your drones, your infantry at scale, which is something

1:38:34.580 --> 1:38:36.580
 the Ukrainians have not done yet.

1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:41.020
 It's something the Russians failed at in Ukraine, and they come from the same place,

1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:43.020
 the Soviet military.

1:38:43.020 --> 1:38:50.460
 We hope this Ukrainian counter offensive at scale, this combined arms operation, succeeds.

1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:55.380
 And if it does succeed, there's the possibility of a battlefield victory.

1:38:55.380 --> 1:39:03.180
 Whether that also includes Crimea, which as you know is not hostile on the contrary to

1:39:03.180 --> 1:39:07.500
 the Russian military, remains to be seen.

1:39:07.500 --> 1:39:16.100
 But however much they regain, territorially, back towards the 1991 borders, which is their

1:39:16.100 --> 1:39:22.740
 goal, their stated goal, and which we support them properly in trying to achieve, however

1:39:22.740 --> 1:39:28.540
 much they achieve of that in this counter offensive that we're anticipating, that will

1:39:28.540 --> 1:39:31.180
 set the stage for the next phase.

1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:40.060
 And either Russia, which is to say, one person, Vladimir Putin, will acknowledge that he's

1:39:40.060 --> 1:39:47.980
 lost the war because the Ukrainians won it on the battlefield, or he'll try to announce

1:39:47.980 --> 1:39:54.780
 a full scale mobilization, conscript the whole country, go back, and instead of acknowledging

1:39:54.780 --> 1:40:00.580
 defeat, try to win with a different plan, recalibrate, remains to be seen.

1:40:00.580 --> 1:40:07.660
 Will the Ukrainians negotiate any territory away, or must they capture also Crimea, which

1:40:07.660 --> 1:40:14.380
 puts a very high bar on the summer counter offensive that we're going to see, which could

1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:17.700
 last through the fall and into the winter as a result?

1:40:17.700 --> 1:40:19.300
 We don't know the answers to that.

1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:21.340
 Nobody knows the answers to that.

1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:22.340
 People are guessing.

1:40:22.340 --> 1:40:28.940
 Some people are better informed because they have inside intelligence.

1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:34.980
 People are also worried about Russian escalation to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons if

1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:38.380
 they begin to lose on the battlefield to Ukraine.

1:40:38.380 --> 1:40:44.660
 Are you worried about nuclear war, the possibility of nuclear war?

1:40:44.660 --> 1:40:49.180
 I think it's necessary to pay attention to that possibility.

1:40:49.180 --> 1:40:57.340
 That possibility existed before the February 2022 full blown invasion of Ukraine.

1:40:57.340 --> 1:41:02.500
 The doomsday arsenal that Russia possesses is enough to destroy the world many times

1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:08.620
 over, and that's been the case every year since the collapse of the Soviet Union in

1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:10.420
 1991.

1:41:10.420 --> 1:41:14.060
 And so, of course, we're concerned about that.

1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:19.780
 We do know, however, Alex, that they have a system known as dual key.

1:41:19.780 --> 1:41:24.420
 Dual key for the strategic nuclear weapons.

1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:31.140
 Strategic nuclear weapons means the ones fired from silos, the missiles, the ones delivered

1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:34.500
 from bombers, or the ones fired from submarines, right?

1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:35.980
 And they're ready to go.

1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:37.820
 They're intercontinental.

1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:40.580
 We watch that very, very closely.

1:41:40.580 --> 1:41:44.500
 We watch all the movement of that and the alerts, et cetera.

1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:51.220
 We have tremendously, let's say, tremendous inside intelligence on that.

1:41:51.220 --> 1:41:55.640
 But dual key means that President Putin alone cannot fire them.

1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:57.860
 He has one key which he must insert.

1:41:57.860 --> 1:42:04.420
 He must then insert the codes for a command to launch.

1:42:04.420 --> 1:42:11.500
 That then goes to the head of the general staff who has his own key and separate codes

1:42:11.500 --> 1:42:16.340
 and must do the same, insert that key and codes for them to launch.

1:42:16.340 --> 1:42:23.940
 And so, will the general staff chief go along with the destruction of the world over a battlefield

1:42:23.940 --> 1:42:26.540
 loss in Ukraine?

1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:30.420
 I don't know the answer to that, and I don't know if anybody knows the answer to that.

1:42:30.420 --> 1:42:33.500
 Will those people flying those bombers?

1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:38.820
 If they get the order from, if the dual key system goes into action and both keys are

1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:46.820
 used and all the codes are implemented, will those young guys flying those bombers let

1:42:46.820 --> 1:42:48.540
 those bombs go?

1:42:48.540 --> 1:42:54.540
 Will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire?

1:42:54.540 --> 1:42:59.420
 We don't know, but you can see that it's more than one man making the decision here in a

1:42:59.420 --> 1:43:02.440
 system of strategic nuclear weapons.

1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:08.780
 As far as the tactical, the so called low yield or battlefield nuclear weapons, we're

1:43:08.780 --> 1:43:15.620
 not sure the system that they have in Russia these days for their use of such tactical

1:43:15.620 --> 1:43:17.740
 nuclear weapons.

1:43:17.740 --> 1:43:27.020
 It could well be that Putin and just himself, he alone can fire them or order them to be

1:43:27.020 --> 1:43:28.020
 fired.

1:43:28.020 --> 1:43:35.260
 You know, there's no tactical nuclear weapon fired at Ukraine that's not also fired simultaneously

1:43:35.260 --> 1:43:38.300
 at Russia.

1:43:38.300 --> 1:43:46.660
 If the Kremlin is 600 miles from Ukraine and if the wind changes direction or the wind

1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:54.860
 happens to be blowing northeast, the fallout hits your Kremlin, not just Ukraine.

1:43:54.860 --> 1:44:00.020
 Moreover, you have all those border regions, which are staging regions for the Russian

1:44:00.020 --> 1:44:04.260
 offensive, and they're a lot closer than 600 miles.

1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:06.420
 They're actually right there.

1:44:06.420 --> 1:44:12.380
 And so you fire that weapon on Ukrainian territory and you can get the fallout, just like the

1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:20.740
 Chernobyl fallout, spread to Sweden, which is how we got the Kremlin to finally, first

1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:25.340
 they denied, they said, oh, we don't know why there's a big nuclear cloud over Sweden.

1:44:25.340 --> 1:44:29.700
 We don't know where that came from, but eventually they admitted it.

1:44:29.700 --> 1:44:36.100
 So Russia can't actually use a nuclear weapon tactical battlefield, one in Ukraine, without

1:44:36.100 --> 1:44:39.140
 also firing it at itself.

1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:45.340
 And in addition, it's that same dynamic I alluded to earlier, which is to say, you bomb

1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:52.660
 a hospital, you bomb a school, there's more heavy weapons going to Ukraine from the west.

1:44:52.660 --> 1:44:56.780
 You can't get away with any of the, there's always going to be a response that's either

1:44:56.780 --> 1:44:59.300
 proportional or greater than proportional.

1:44:59.300 --> 1:45:06.900
 You could well have Europe signing on to NATO direct engagement, both Washington and

1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:13.420
 Brussels direct engagement of the Russian army on the territory of Ukraine.

1:45:13.420 --> 1:45:18.980
 Do you think that's possible to do that without dramatic escalation from the Russian side?

1:45:18.980 --> 1:45:24.700
 Yes, I do think it's possible, but it's very worrisome, just like you're saying.

1:45:24.700 --> 1:45:32.460
 But if Putin were to escalate like that, he's firing that weapon at himself and he's potentially

1:45:32.460 --> 1:45:39.340
 provoking a direct clash with NATO's military, not just with the Ukrainian military.

1:45:39.340 --> 1:45:46.580
 If you're sitting in the Kremlin looking at those charts, Lex, of NATO capabilities, and

1:45:46.580 --> 1:45:53.660
 you can't conquer Ukraine, which didn't really have heavy weapons before February, 2022,

1:45:53.660 --> 1:46:00.940
 at scale, and you're thinking, okay, now I'm going to take on NATO, that would be a bold

1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:04.820
 step on the part of a Russian leader.

1:46:04.820 --> 1:46:09.100
 And let's also remember, Lex, that there's another variable here.

1:46:09.100 --> 1:46:16.260
 They're a desperate as long as everyone implements your orders.

1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:23.660
 And so if people start to say quietly, not necessarily publicly, I may not implement

1:46:23.660 --> 1:46:31.380
 that order, because that's maybe a criminal order, or my grandma is Ukrainian, or my wife

1:46:31.380 --> 1:46:37.660
 is Ukrainian, or I don't want to go to the hog, I don't want to spend the rest of my

1:46:37.660 --> 1:46:43.500
 life in the hog, or whatever it might be, at any point along the chain of command, from

1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:50.220
 the general staff all the way down, right, to the platoon, you're a desperate provider

1:46:50.220 --> 1:46:52.900
 they implement your orders.

1:46:52.900 --> 1:46:59.620
 But who's to say that somewhere along the chain of command, people start to say, you

1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:06.700
 know, I'm going to ignore that order, or I'm going to sabotage that order, or I'm going

1:47:06.700 --> 1:47:13.700
 to flee the battlefield, or I'm going to injure myself so that I don't have to fight, or I'm

1:47:13.700 --> 1:47:16.860
 going to join the Ukrainian side.

1:47:16.860 --> 1:47:24.920
 And so it could be that's what's left of the Russian army in the field begins to disintegrate.

1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:30.180
 Even if the Ukrainians are not able to mount that counter offensive at scale that combined

1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:36.660
 arms operation, the Russian military in the field, which has taken horrendous casualties

1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:41.540
 as far as we understand, something like a third of the original force.

1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:45.880
 So you're talking about 50 to 60,000.

1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:51.900
 That includes both dead and wounded to the point of being unable to return to the battlefield.

1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:53.780
 Those are big numbers.

1:47:53.780 --> 1:47:55.860
 Those were a lot of families.

1:47:55.860 --> 1:48:02.860
 A lot of families affected, their sons, or their husbands, or their fathers are either

1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:07.940
 missing in action, or the regime won't tell them that they're dead, as you know, from

1:48:07.940 --> 1:48:15.380
 the sinking of that flagship Moskva, right, by the Ukrainians.

1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:20.620
 And so a disintegration of the Russian military, because there are orders that they either

1:48:20.620 --> 1:48:26.980
 can't implement or don't want to implement, is also not excluded.

1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:31.980
 And so you have these two big variables, the Ukrainian army in the field and its ability

1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:37.500
 to move from defense to offense at scale, and we're going to test that soon.

1:48:37.500 --> 1:48:45.100
 And then the Russian ability in the field to hold together in a war of conquest and aggression,

1:48:45.100 --> 1:48:52.940
 where they're conscripts, or they're fed dog food, or they don't have any weapons anymore

1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:56.420
 because there's no resupply.

1:48:56.420 --> 1:48:59.380
 So the disintegration of the army can't be excluded.

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:02.980
 And then, of course, all bets are off on the Putin regime.

1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:07.900
 More long term, there are these technology export controls.

1:49:07.900 --> 1:49:14.020
 We were talking about how the military industrial complex in Russia is dependent on foreign

1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:16.820
 component parts and software.

1:49:16.820 --> 1:49:21.940
 And so if you have export controls, and you have firms voluntarily, even when they don't

1:49:21.940 --> 1:49:29.100
 fall under export controls, leaving Russian business, refusing to do business with Russia,

1:49:29.100 --> 1:49:35.420
 and we see this not just in the civilian sector like with McDonald's or many other companies,

1:49:35.420 --> 1:49:43.540
 we see this in the key areas like the oil industry, with the executives fleeing, that

1:49:43.540 --> 1:49:48.080
 is the Western executives fleeing, giving up their positions.

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:58.860
 So Russia's ability to resupply its tanks, to resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms,

1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:04.820
 resupply its food to its soldiers in the field, and then their boots.

1:50:04.820 --> 1:50:11.260
 We see a lot of stuff under tremendous stress, and in the long term, there's no obvious way.

1:50:11.260 --> 1:50:18.980
 They can rebuild the military industrial complex to produce those weapons because they're reliant

1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:24.220
 on foreign parts that they can't get anymore, and there are no domestic substitutes on the

1:50:24.220 --> 1:50:26.580
 immediate horizon.

1:50:26.580 --> 1:50:32.460
 It's at the earliest a two year proposition to have domestic substitutes.

1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:37.540
 And for some things like microelectronics, they've never had domestic substitutes going

1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:40.900
 back to the Soviet times, as you know well.

1:50:40.900 --> 1:50:47.460
 And so there's that pressure on Russia from the technology export controls, which if you're

1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:54.580
 in the security ministry or the defense ministry, if you're in that side of the regime, you're

1:50:54.580 --> 1:51:02.100
 feeling that pain as we speak, and you're wondering about the strategy.

1:51:02.100 --> 1:51:08.300
 Let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history, and it frustrates me in part when

1:51:08.300 --> 1:51:14.340
 people draw these parallels, but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels.

1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:32.140
 So there's a song that goes, the operation Barbarossa, the bombing of Kiev by Hitler,

1:51:32.140 --> 1:51:38.380
 there is sort of an eerie parallel, and you have to be extremely careful drawing such

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:50.740
 parallels and such connections to this unexplainable war that is World War II.

1:51:50.740 --> 1:51:59.220
 But is there elements of this that do echo in the actions of Vladimir Putin?

1:51:59.220 --> 1:52:06.420
 And more specifically, do you think that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal?

1:52:06.420 --> 1:52:10.100
 Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?

1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:17.980
 Well, war criminal is a legal determination, and it requires evidence and due process and

1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:21.440
 the ability to defend oneself.

1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:28.860
 We don't just decide in the Twitter sphere or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.

1:52:28.860 --> 1:52:34.660
 They can be a suspected war criminal, and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute

1:52:34.660 --> 1:52:42.100
 that case, and then the issue for us, Alex, is which court does it go to?

1:52:42.100 --> 1:52:44.180
 What's the appropriate place?

1:52:44.180 --> 1:52:46.780
 Does it happen in Ukraine because they're the victims?

1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:51.260
 Does it happen in the Hague because there's an international criminal court there?

1:52:51.260 --> 1:52:56.700
 Does it happen inside Russia because there's regime change at some point, and some of these

1:52:56.700 --> 1:53:05.220
 people become, let's say, they get arrested by their own people inside Russia?

1:53:05.220 --> 1:53:09.820
 So those are all important questions that have to be pursued with resources and with

1:53:09.820 --> 1:53:17.100
 determination and by skilled people who are excellent at gathering that evidence, and

1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:19.060
 that process is underway.

1:53:19.060 --> 1:53:26.420
 And Ukraine has a trial underway now of one alleged war criminal who's pleaded guilty

1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:32.340
 and we'll see what the outcome of that trial inside Ukraine is of a lower level official,

1:53:32.340 --> 1:53:39.100
 not obviously Vladimir Putin, but the commander of a tank group.

1:53:39.100 --> 1:53:54.740
 So yes, the names are eerily familiar, Izyum, Harkiv, Kyiv, those are the names we know

1:53:54.740 --> 1:54:01.060
 from the Nazi invasion and the Nazi occupation of Ukraine.

1:54:01.060 --> 1:54:07.220
 And it's very deeply troubling to think that this could happen again.

1:54:07.220 --> 1:54:15.580
 And there's a bizarre sense that the Russians claiming, as Putin says, to denazify Ukraine

1:54:15.580 --> 1:54:22.020
 have invaded the same places that the Nazis invaded back in 1941.

1:54:22.020 --> 1:54:28.900
 As somebody who's working on volume three of your work on Stalin going through this

1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:32.060
 period, is it eerie to you?

1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:34.580
 Yes, it is, Lex.

1:54:34.580 --> 1:54:41.660
 I've written the chapters of volume three, I've drafted the chapters on the war, and

1:54:41.660 --> 1:54:47.500
 as I say, the place names are very evocative, unfortunately.

1:54:47.500 --> 1:54:52.940
 But you know, the Nazis failed ultimately.

1:54:52.940 --> 1:54:59.820
 They captured Ukraine for a time, but they were evicted from Ukraine.

1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:08.900
 There was massive partisan or guerrilla warfare resistance behind Nazi lines the whole time

1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:13.100
 that they were allegedly in control of Ukraine.

1:55:13.100 --> 1:55:17.660
 If you look at the maps on cable TV, they show you the sign of Russia, they show you

1:55:17.660 --> 1:55:22.460
 the coloring, Russian control, and they draw a line and then it's colored in.

1:55:22.460 --> 1:55:25.740
 But the word control is misplaced.

1:55:25.740 --> 1:55:27.220
 They don't actually control it.

1:55:27.220 --> 1:55:34.820
 It's Russian claimed or extent of farthest Russian troop advancement.

1:55:34.820 --> 1:55:41.020
 Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine, Crimea accepted, you have insurgencies, you

1:55:41.020 --> 1:55:43.420
 have armed insurgency.

1:55:43.420 --> 1:55:50.540
 In Militopov, for example, which is a place that you know in southeastern Ukraine.

1:55:50.540 --> 1:55:58.100
 There is a guerrilla war now underway to hurt the Russians who are in occupation of that

1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:00.380
 city and region.

1:56:00.380 --> 1:56:08.020
 And we're going to see that continue even if the war becomes a stalemate, even if it

1:56:08.020 --> 1:56:15.140
 stalemates more or less at the lines we're at now, which would mean that anticipated

1:56:15.140 --> 1:56:19.460
 Ukrainian counter offensive at scale proves unsuccessful.

1:56:19.460 --> 1:56:22.940
 The Russian army doesn't disintegrate.

1:56:22.940 --> 1:56:28.540
 And you end up with a stalemate where there could be a ceasefire, not a ceasefire, but

1:56:28.540 --> 1:56:32.500
 neither side is attempting an offensive for the time being.

1:56:32.500 --> 1:56:38.740
 There will be resistance behind those Russian lines, and it will be fierce resistance, the

1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:43.700
 kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi occupation.

1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:52.620
 Ultimately it took the Red Army reinvading the territory of Ukraine and succeeding at

1:56:52.620 --> 1:56:59.180
 combined arms operations at scale, a massive counter offensive much larger than anything

1:56:59.180 --> 1:57:01.700
 we're talking about today.

1:57:01.700 --> 1:57:05.620
 Ultimately it required that to evict the Nazis from Ukraine.

1:57:05.620 --> 1:57:12.460
 But in the meantime, they did not have an easy occupation regime there.

1:57:12.460 --> 1:57:22.940
 Ukrainian Soviet partisans killed Nazi officials, Wehrmacht soldiers, Wehrmacht officers, blew

1:57:22.940 --> 1:57:31.180
 up the infrastructure they were using, made them pay a price for their occupation.

1:57:31.180 --> 1:57:38.500
 We could well see, if unfortunately this ends in a stalemate for the time being, we could

1:57:38.500 --> 1:57:46.540
 well see that type of insurgency gain momentum behind Russian lines and try to evict the

1:57:46.540 --> 1:57:54.540
 Russians that way and then remount the counter offensive at scale later on in the future

1:57:54.540 --> 1:57:57.580
 if the first one doesn't succeed.

1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:03.060
 So that would be further echoes of the World War II experience.

1:58:03.060 --> 1:58:05.900
 The scale once again is much smaller.

1:58:05.900 --> 1:58:15.540
 The size of the armies here, they're not in the many 800,000, 700,000, 1,002, 1,004,

1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:18.140
 that's not what we're talking about today.

1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:27.300
 But the weapons, the cruise missiles, artillery fire, artillery fire used to be very inaccurate

1:58:27.300 --> 1:58:29.500
 and it was like saturation.

1:58:29.500 --> 1:58:33.460
 You would just fire towards the enemy lines and if you hit something, you hit something

1:58:33.460 --> 1:58:36.980
 and if you didn't, you just kept firing.

1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:39.660
 Now you have drones, Lex.

1:58:39.660 --> 1:58:46.700
 And so artillery fire is now sniper fire because you can coordinate the direction of the artillery

1:58:46.700 --> 1:58:49.580
 fire with the drones.

1:58:49.580 --> 1:58:55.580
 The drones can take a picture and show you where the enemy is precisely located.

1:58:55.580 --> 1:59:01.140
 And you can align that artillery to hit them instead of just indiscriminately bombing an

1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:04.180
 area, a territory.

1:59:04.180 --> 1:59:11.500
 And the NATO supplied artillery goes really far and you can fire into Russian positions

1:59:11.500 --> 1:59:20.700
 and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire because your artillery fires farther than theirs.

1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:22.380
 So that's coming.

1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:24.780
 And we're going to see that in action.

1:59:24.780 --> 1:59:30.380
 And so the scale is not the same, but the weapons, the precision of some of the weapons

1:59:30.380 --> 1:59:34.100
 and some of the NATO, we're not sending all of our stuff.

1:59:34.100 --> 1:59:39.540
 But as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities, Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs

1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:47.580
 hospitals, Russia kills civilians and more and heavier and more lethal Western weapons

1:59:47.580 --> 1:59:49.100
 go to Ukraine.

1:59:49.100 --> 1:59:53.700
 Their willingness to risk their lives is really so impressive.

1:59:53.700 --> 2:00:01.060
 And the reason that it's our duty, we're obliged to supply those weapons.

2:00:01.060 --> 2:00:06.180
 And so the Russians don't have that resupply and the Ukrainians do.

2:00:06.180 --> 2:00:09.540
 And so the Russians are now digging in, Lex.

2:00:09.540 --> 2:00:14.420
 They're digging in deeply in the areas that they've penetrated.

2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:21.900
 And they're trying to build unassailable positions for when the Ukrainians transition

2:00:21.900 --> 2:00:26.580
 from mostly defense to full scale offense.

2:00:26.580 --> 2:00:31.460
 And we'll see if that now, I mean, they're digging everywhere.

2:00:31.460 --> 2:00:34.780
 As they say, kapayut, kapayut, right?

2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:36.500
 They're digging everywhere behind.

2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:37.980
 Your Russian is beautiful.

2:00:37.980 --> 2:00:41.300
 Digging in, I wish, Lex, like yours.

2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:45.700
 But so there are these things that we can't predict, but there are these things we're

2:00:45.700 --> 2:00:50.180
 watching and watching closely.

2:00:50.180 --> 2:00:54.620
 And on top of that, something that's not in World War II, or for the most part, is cyber

2:00:54.620 --> 2:01:05.520
 attacks and cyber warfare, which is much less, perhaps, convertible into human words because

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:09.940
 it happens so quickly, such large scales, so difficult to trace and all those kinds

2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:10.940
 of things.

2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:11.940
 It's not bullets.

2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:14.300
 It's electrical signals and that.

2:01:14.300 --> 2:01:15.300
 Yeah.

2:01:15.300 --> 2:01:18.540
 But those Ukrainian people, they're like you, Lex.

2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:23.220
 They're young and they're technically really proficient.

2:01:23.220 --> 2:01:25.060
 And they've been amazing.

2:01:25.060 --> 2:01:32.040
 You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement, playing video games, it's useful

2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:33.040
 after all.

2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:35.180
 It turns out it's more than useful.

2:01:35.180 --> 2:01:37.700
 You can save your country that way.

2:01:37.700 --> 2:01:43.500
 And so they're not alone, they're getting support, and that support is important.

2:01:43.500 --> 2:01:49.060
 But really, predominantly, it's Ukrainians on the cyber battlefield, and their skills

2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:53.640
 have been very impressive, and they've been preparing for this for a number of years,

2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:58.700
 and they have a whole army of young people on the cyber side.

2:01:58.700 --> 2:02:00.420
 It's their civilian population.

2:02:00.420 --> 2:02:06.040
 These are not people conscripted into the military or volunteering, wearing the uniform.

2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:11.580
 And so even in cyber warfare, the Ukrainians have been extremely impressive.

2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:21.980
 And so let's remember that all of these aspects of warfare, whether it's how far your cruise

2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:29.900
 missiles go and how accurate they are, what size your cyber capabilities are, it's really

2:02:29.900 --> 2:02:32.020
 ultimately about the people.

2:02:32.020 --> 2:02:34.780
 It's about the human capital, right?

2:02:34.780 --> 2:02:41.500
 It's about their willingness, their skill level, but also their willingness to fight

2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:43.700
 and to put their lives on the line.

2:02:43.700 --> 2:02:45.860
 And there's no substitute for that.

2:02:45.860 --> 2:02:53.260
 And so what's called morale or courage or bravery or valor, that's really the ultimately

2:02:53.260 --> 2:03:01.260
 decisive provided you have enough sufficient arms to conduct the fight.

2:03:01.260 --> 2:03:05.020
 And if you don't, you use a Molotov cocktail, right?

2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:12.700
 Grandma calls in the coordinates of the Russian tank on her iPhone, and you have a Molotov

2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:20.300
 cocktail that the people who used to work in the cafeteria are now stuffing flammable

2:03:20.300 --> 2:03:25.020
 liquid into bottles, and you carry one right up to the tank and you smash it against the

2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:30.860
 tank or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank, right?

2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:36.700
 There's no substitute for that kind of stuff, that level of resolve, willingness to die

2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:38.340
 for your country.

2:03:38.340 --> 2:03:43.780
 That's a really big lesson that we need to absorb in our own country.

2:03:43.780 --> 2:03:49.460
 We've been going to war more frequently than we should, and like you said, without the

2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:54.980
 justification all the time, and then like Henry Kissinger said, without understanding how

2:03:54.980 --> 2:03:57.180
 this was going to end.

2:03:57.180 --> 2:04:02.660
 It's easy to start a war, it's very difficult to win a war, prevail in a war or end a war

2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:08.780
 on terms that meet your original expectations, right?

2:04:08.780 --> 2:04:13.780
 We've been fighting wars, but we haven't been fighting wars as societies.

2:04:13.780 --> 2:04:18.820
 We've been fighting wars as a small sliver of our population.

2:04:18.820 --> 2:04:22.940
 Something like one percent of our population is involved with the military because we have

2:04:22.940 --> 2:04:26.060
 an all volunteer force.

2:04:26.060 --> 2:04:34.900
 And that means that it's easier for our politicians to go to war because they don't face conscription,

2:04:34.900 --> 2:04:43.180
 they don't have the draft, which affects every family in the country, and because the number

2:04:43.180 --> 2:04:49.620
 of people in the volunteer force is such a narrow stratum of the population.

2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:54.300
 And so they've been getting away with this because the professional army is much better

2:04:54.300 --> 2:05:00.060
 than the conscript army, and an all volunteer force is much preferable from a military point

2:05:00.060 --> 2:05:07.700
 of view, but from a societal point of view, it enables you to go to war too easily as

2:05:07.700 --> 2:05:14.180
 a politician, and it doesn't engage the society the same way that the Ukrainian society is

2:05:14.180 --> 2:05:20.060
 completely engaged from those young hackers all the way up to those grandmothers.

2:05:20.060 --> 2:05:28.460
 Let me ask you, you're a scholar of history, a scholar of geopolitics, and you're also

2:05:28.460 --> 2:05:30.260
 a human being.

2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:31.740
 That's kind of you, Lex.

2:05:31.740 --> 2:05:33.940
 I'll take that.

2:05:33.940 --> 2:05:39.740
 What's the value, what's the hope, what's the power of conversation here?

2:05:39.740 --> 2:05:47.700
 If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin and have a conversation versus bullets, human

2:05:47.700 --> 2:05:51.260
 exchange words, is there hope for those?

2:05:51.260 --> 2:05:53.180
 And if so, what would you talk about?

2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:55.740
 What would you ask him?

2:05:55.740 --> 2:05:58.860
 Well, Henry Kissinger, you alluded to his op ed.

2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:11.140
 He's had many private meetings with President Putin over a long time, and President Biden,

2:06:11.140 --> 2:06:19.220
 the previous presidents, secretaries of state, officials below secretary of state, the head

2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:27.100
 of the CIA evidently met with President Putin in the fall when he was massing the troops

2:06:27.100 --> 2:06:35.340
 on the border before he invaded, and we sent the head of the CIA, and Putin received him.

2:06:35.340 --> 2:06:40.260
 Somebody he evidently respects or was at least willing to meet, unlike other members of the

2:06:40.260 --> 2:06:42.700
 administration.

2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:48.980
 So a lot of people are talking to him in some form or another for the 22 years he's been

2:06:48.980 --> 2:06:56.940
 in power, and I'm not sure it's had what I would call their desired effect.

2:06:56.940 --> 2:07:02.700
 Well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too, and also the timing, which is post February

2:07:02.700 --> 2:07:13.020
 22nd is a different time, and also another aspect, which Oliver Stone mentioned interestingly,

2:07:13.020 --> 2:07:18.700
 that there's something about COVID and the pandemic that creates isolation, the distancing.

2:07:18.700 --> 2:07:25.660
 It's such a silly little nuance thing, but maybe it's actually has a profound impact

2:07:25.660 --> 2:07:30.820
 on the human being, the human mind of Vladimir Putin, that there is something about an in

2:07:30.820 --> 2:07:38.340
 person meeting, and not across a table that's far too large, but the intimacy of one human

2:07:38.340 --> 2:07:44.980
 to human in person conversation, that there's something distinctly powerful about that reminder

2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:52.340
 that as Putin says in the narrative in the propaganda, that we're all one people.

2:07:52.340 --> 2:07:57.780
 There is truth to that, that this entirety of humanity is one people, and you kind of

2:07:57.780 --> 2:08:02.480
 reminded by that when you're sitting together.

2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:11.980
 People who have sat across the table from him, whether at 30 yards or at three, have

2:08:11.980 --> 2:08:18.820
 remarked upon this feeling of isolation that has affected him, the pandemic.

2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:24.660
 I think there must be something to that if several people who've been in the room with

2:08:24.660 --> 2:08:28.300
 him are remarking on it.

2:08:28.300 --> 2:08:32.700
 Everybody that I know, and I've been able to talk to, who's had a meeting with him in

2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:43.140
 the past 10 years, including Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, has said that

2:08:43.140 --> 2:08:49.220
 Putin spends a lot of time enumerating his grievances.

2:08:49.220 --> 2:08:55.340
 He goes through a monologue of his grievances, and then the West did this, and then the West

2:08:55.340 --> 2:09:01.540
 lied to us about that, and then the West cheated us on this.

2:09:01.540 --> 2:09:08.100
 It's not the conversation that you're encouraging of common humanity.

2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:15.420
 It's that roiling resentment volcano that's just exploding and exploding.

2:09:15.420 --> 2:09:22.140
 By the time he gets through the monologue of the grievances, the time of the meeting

2:09:22.140 --> 2:09:25.500
 is expired or over time.

2:09:25.500 --> 2:09:29.900
 That's a brilliant statement, but that's where the skill of conversation comes in.

2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:34.540
 When you're facing a bull with a red cloth, you have to learn how to avoid the long list

2:09:34.540 --> 2:09:37.820
 of grievances and get to the humanity.

2:09:37.820 --> 2:09:39.660
 That's a really important skill.

2:09:39.660 --> 2:09:45.340
 For sure it's a skill, and it's the highest level skill of a diplomat to be able to reach

2:09:45.340 --> 2:09:51.660
 some type of common understanding when interests and worldviews clash so much.

2:09:51.660 --> 2:09:54.900
 But here's your challenge, Lex.

2:09:54.900 --> 2:10:05.540
 Your challenge is Russia wants to impose a closed sphere of influence on its neighbors.

2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:10.540
 It wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can't do.

2:10:10.540 --> 2:10:17.180
 It wants to exert influence not by the power of its example, not by the freedom of its

2:10:17.180 --> 2:10:24.620
 people, not by the dynamism of its diversified economy, but it wants to exert influence

2:10:24.620 --> 2:10:32.180
 just because it deserves that, just because it's a great power, just because, and on and

2:10:32.180 --> 2:10:36.260
 on and on, it's a civilization unto itself.

2:10:36.260 --> 2:10:40.700
 And it wants that, and we can't give that.

2:10:40.700 --> 2:10:47.420
 The reason that Russia was not integrated into the West was not for lack of trying.

2:10:47.420 --> 2:10:54.140
 It was because Russia ultimately spurned the integration because it was about what terms

2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:56.660
 the integration would come on.

2:10:56.660 --> 2:11:04.820
 Would you come into the West and observe Western rules and be another country, meaning just

2:11:04.820 --> 2:11:06.580
 another country?

2:11:06.580 --> 2:11:16.820
 There's Poland, and there's Austria, and there's little tiny Monaco, and there's Russia.

2:11:16.820 --> 2:11:19.620
 And you're just one of those countries.

2:11:19.620 --> 2:11:24.540
 And Russia's answer to that was no, we're not just one of those countries.

2:11:24.540 --> 2:11:26.780
 We need special rules.

2:11:26.780 --> 2:11:29.580
 We need special conditions.

2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:37.300
 We'll integrate, but only as a special country, meaning like at the UN, where all countries

2:11:37.300 --> 2:11:43.420
 are sovereign, all countries are members, but Russia has a veto on what countries can

2:11:43.420 --> 2:11:45.020
 and can't do.

2:11:45.020 --> 2:11:48.980
 Those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate.

2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:54.100
 And those were the terms that no leader of a Western country or the United States or

2:11:54.100 --> 2:12:00.180
 the G7 or fill in the blank can grant to Russia.

2:12:00.180 --> 2:12:06.740
 It's very well known that Vladimir Putin was one of the first, maybe the first person,

2:12:06.740 --> 2:12:13.460
 first leader, foreign leader to call President Bush after the 911 tragedy.

2:12:13.460 --> 2:12:15.420
 They didn't connect right away.

2:12:15.420 --> 2:12:20.380
 President Bush was not in Washington, but eventually they did speak.

2:12:20.380 --> 2:12:26.500
 He condemned the terrorist attack, he offered Russian support, which he delivered on the

2:12:26.500 --> 2:12:33.420
 use of some Russian logistics for our Afghanistan operations.

2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:39.140
 And a lot of people point to that and they say, there it is, Russia wanted to cooperate

2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:47.740
 and did cooperate and we spurned them, or we failed to appreciate Russia's cooperation.

2:12:47.740 --> 2:12:54.620
 And so therefore Russia was cheated, or Russia was lied to, or Russia's grievances are legitimate.

2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:58.140
 But here's the problem with that argument, Lex.

2:12:58.140 --> 2:13:06.380
 In exchange for that support, Vladimir Putin asked in return from President Bush for a

2:13:06.380 --> 2:13:13.420
 free hand in the former Soviet space that closed hierarchical sphere of influence, where

2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:20.300
 Russia would exert influence coercively over countries that were sovereign.

2:13:20.300 --> 2:13:25.100
 And no American president could grant that and President Bush was right.

2:13:25.100 --> 2:13:27.060
 He said no.

2:13:27.060 --> 2:13:32.020
 And so the attempted cooperation blew up.

2:13:32.020 --> 2:13:36.060
 But who's at fault there?

2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:40.820
 Should there be a nonvoluntary sphere of influence?

2:13:40.820 --> 2:13:48.020
 Should that be granted, or should you face up to attempts to do that?

2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:54.700
 Let's take a little detour here into China for a second.

2:13:54.700 --> 2:14:02.660
 China had this brilliant grand strategy, which was, sure, America is hostile because America

2:14:02.660 --> 2:14:08.260
 is hegemonic, America wants to control the world, America will never let China rise,

2:14:08.260 --> 2:14:11.580
 America will do everything it can to hold China down.

2:14:11.580 --> 2:14:15.060
 So we're going to have hostility from America.

2:14:15.060 --> 2:14:20.740
 We don't want to decouple, because we need that high end technology transfer, either

2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:25.460
 we buy it or we steal it, because America and the rest of the West has all the technology

2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:26.760
 that we need.

2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:32.220
 We have some of it domestically, more than before by a lot, but we're still dependent

2:14:32.220 --> 2:14:34.100
 so we can't decouple.

2:14:34.100 --> 2:14:38.340
 So we'll have the hostility, but there'll be a line we don't cross just so that we don't

2:14:38.340 --> 2:14:41.580
 lose the technology transfer.

2:14:41.580 --> 2:14:49.060
 Till made in China 2035 is accomplished, and we're self sufficient domestically and AI

2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:52.660
 in every other area that's critical.

2:14:52.660 --> 2:14:54.020
 But hostility from America.

2:14:54.020 --> 2:14:56.060
 But we have an ace in the hole.

2:14:56.060 --> 2:14:58.420
 Our ace in the hole is Europe.

2:14:58.420 --> 2:15:00.300
 Europe hates conflict.

2:15:00.300 --> 2:15:01.980
 They're all about trade.

2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:04.820
 It doesn't matter how evil you are.

2:15:04.820 --> 2:15:10.660
 They love to trade because van der door handel, change through trade.

2:15:10.660 --> 2:15:15.140
 They have this illusion that you're going to become a better country if they trade with

2:15:15.140 --> 2:15:19.780
 you and you won't have conflict, war and hostilities if you trade.

2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:22.620
 And so we have this European ace in the hole.

2:15:22.620 --> 2:15:24.420
 We're hostile with the Americans.

2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:28.300
 We're still buying or stealing their technology.

2:15:28.300 --> 2:15:32.780
 And better than that, even the Europeans are not hostile to us at all.

2:15:32.780 --> 2:15:35.980
 They love to trade with us and they want to trade more and they're our biggest trading

2:15:35.980 --> 2:15:38.380
 partner already.

2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:45.220
 And lo and behold, Xi Jinping sides with Vladimir Putin in the aggression in Ukraine.

2:15:45.220 --> 2:15:49.540
 He doesn't side with him providing military equipment.

2:15:49.540 --> 2:15:56.820
 He doesn't provide technology transfer, but he provides public support and massive pro

2:15:56.820 --> 2:16:02.060
 Russian propaganda to the whole Chinese population.

2:16:02.060 --> 2:16:07.780
 And the Europeans say, wait a minute, this is an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe.

2:16:07.780 --> 2:16:09.820
 What do you mean?

2:16:09.820 --> 2:16:13.140
 You're not condemning Vladimir Putin's invasion.

2:16:13.140 --> 2:16:18.540
 And so that wedge that the Chinese had, that was the basis of their grand strategy, that

2:16:18.540 --> 2:16:24.900
 wedge between the US and Europe when it came to China policy, that wedge is gone now.

2:16:24.900 --> 2:16:27.500
 Xi Jinping destroyed it.

2:16:27.500 --> 2:16:33.220
 And the Europeans and the Americans are coming close together on Ukraine and Russia policy

2:16:33.220 --> 2:16:38.900
 for sure, but also more and more on China policy.

2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:42.940
 And so that was a pretty big sacrifice for the Chinese leader to make.

2:16:42.940 --> 2:16:45.740
 And what did he get in return?

2:16:45.740 --> 2:16:50.540
 He gets hydrocarbons from Russia at reduced prices.

2:16:50.540 --> 2:16:54.660
 And the Chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries.

2:16:54.660 --> 2:16:59.540
 They have a completely diverse supply chain for their energy.

2:16:59.540 --> 2:17:02.980
 So what do you think Xi Jinping is thinking now?

2:17:02.980 --> 2:17:04.380
 Was it a mistake?

2:17:04.380 --> 2:17:05.380
 Or if...

2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:06.380
 I'd like to know, Lex.

2:17:06.380 --> 2:17:11.580
 I'd like you to be able to sit down with him across from this table here on your podcast

2:17:11.580 --> 2:17:14.580
 and pose that same question to him, because we have no idea.

2:17:14.580 --> 2:17:16.820
 There's a language barrier that's fascinating.

2:17:16.820 --> 2:17:22.100
 By the way, you as a scholar of Stalin, do you think we'll ever break through the language

2:17:22.100 --> 2:17:27.380
 barrier to China, not ever, I apologize, in the next few years?

2:17:27.380 --> 2:17:32.340
 Because there is a gigantic cultural and language barrier between the West and the

2:17:32.340 --> 2:17:33.340
 China.

2:17:33.340 --> 2:17:34.820
 China's a great civilization.

2:17:34.820 --> 2:17:40.060
 China predates the United States by millennia.

2:17:40.060 --> 2:17:42.660
 China's accomplishments are breathtaking.

2:17:42.660 --> 2:17:51.380
 But China's also led by, let's be honest, a Communist Party monopoly, which engages in

2:17:51.380 --> 2:17:53.460
 a lot of criminal behavior.

2:17:53.460 --> 2:18:06.140
 Lex, Tibet is Ukraine, Xinjiang is Ukraine, Hong Kong is Ukraine, let alone support for

2:18:06.140 --> 2:18:07.340
 Putin, Ukraine.

2:18:07.340 --> 2:18:10.580
 This is before we've even discussed Taiwan.

2:18:10.580 --> 2:18:15.220
 And so now the Europeans are coming to see this, and the Americans are coming to understand

2:18:15.220 --> 2:18:25.900
 this, that maybe trading with a regime like that, morally, politically, criminally, Tibet,

2:18:25.900 --> 2:18:31.780
 Xinjiang, Hong Kong, how is that different from what Putin is doing in Ukraine?

2:18:31.780 --> 2:18:37.140
 I'd be hard pressed to differentiate that ultimately, even though the analogies are

2:18:37.140 --> 2:18:38.940
 not exact.

2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:49.100
 And so the Chinese, it's like that guy, Leonov, the author of Li Haletia, the great memoir

2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:55.060
 of the late Soviet period, the end of the Soviet Union, that they spend all this time

2:18:55.060 --> 2:19:00.540
 and all these resources blackening our image, but we supply them with endless material to

2:19:00.540 --> 2:19:02.500
 blacken our image.

2:19:02.500 --> 2:19:05.940
 That's where Xi Jinping's regime is right now, Lex.

2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:09.780
 And so they have a big dilemma on their side.

2:19:09.780 --> 2:19:19.300
 It's a Western world, and they've united the Western world and reawaken the Western world

2:19:19.300 --> 2:19:27.180
 to the fact that China is a threat to the values, the institutions and values of the

2:19:27.180 --> 2:19:32.180
 West, and that trade is not transforming China quite the opposite.

2:19:32.180 --> 2:19:34.420
 We'll see if this endures.

2:19:34.420 --> 2:19:39.860
 Maybe it doesn't endure, maybe it's a fleeting moment, maybe this is not an inflection point.

2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:45.700
 Maybe the war in Ukraine ends more quickly than we think, and maybe, like you said,

2:19:45.700 --> 2:19:49.820
 the Chinese and the Indians and the rest of them, the leaders there, they get their wish

2:19:49.820 --> 2:20:00.820
 that it ends and the world moves on and forgets or says, let's try again to resume our mutual

2:20:00.820 --> 2:20:05.180
 understanding, our mutually beneficial trade and everything else.

2:20:05.180 --> 2:20:06.460
 Maybe it's a passing phase.

2:20:06.460 --> 2:20:07.460
 We can't exclude that.

2:20:07.460 --> 2:20:10.660
 I'm very poor at predicting the future.

2:20:10.660 --> 2:20:17.500
 But the moment is not a good one for the Chinese regime, let alone the fact that he's trying

2:20:17.500 --> 2:20:25.620
 to impose an unprecedented in the modern era third term for himself as president in the

2:20:25.620 --> 2:20:36.020
 fall at the next party Congress becoming president for life, a de facto, a Mao like figure,

2:20:36.020 --> 2:20:44.980
 and he's now got to do that within this environment where he has damaged Chinese grand strategy

2:20:44.980 --> 2:20:51.540
 and damaged the reputation of China and its relationships across the world, maybe not

2:20:51.540 --> 2:20:59.060
 permanently, but significantly in addition to the problems they have at home, demography,

2:20:59.060 --> 2:21:06.980
 as you know, a middle income trap, and then the regulatory insanity of Chinese communist

2:21:06.980 --> 2:21:11.620
 rule that we've seen with the tech companies that you know well, where they've destroyed

2:21:11.620 --> 2:21:19.580
 all of that value with the blow up of their property sector because it was a massive bubble

2:21:19.580 --> 2:21:22.100
 and that's still playing out.

2:21:22.100 --> 2:21:27.180
 And this time it's the same, meaning this time it's not different.

2:21:27.180 --> 2:21:33.100
 When it comes to a property blowout, it has enormous effects on middle class balance sheets

2:21:33.100 --> 2:21:40.020
 and their ability to be to remain consumers and drive the economy, which is the model

2:21:40.020 --> 2:21:41.020
 that they have to share.

2:21:41.020 --> 2:21:49.540
 So he's got a litany of challenges independent even of the fact that he sided with his past

2:21:49.540 --> 2:21:56.100
 pal, Vladimir Putin, and their bromance is costing China very, very significantly.

2:21:56.100 --> 2:22:06.300
 If you close your eyes, and 100 years ago, 1922, and you think about the future, I wonder

2:22:06.300 --> 2:22:15.940
 if you can hear the drums of war predicting the 30s, predicting the Great Depression and

2:22:15.940 --> 2:22:22.180
 the resentment that builds the economic resentment, the cultural resentment, the geopolitical

2:22:22.180 --> 2:22:26.260
 resentment that builds at least the World War II.

2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:32.060
 It at least to me, when I close my eyes, I can hear the drums of war that are still ahead

2:22:32.060 --> 2:22:33.060
 of us.

2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:45.140
 And it's possible that 2022 will materialize in a similar way as did 1922.

2:22:45.140 --> 2:22:51.980
 I have my eyes closed, legs, and I sure hope that that's not what happens.

2:22:51.980 --> 2:23:00.180
 But I'm looking at 1922, it's an epoch I know well, and I don't see the future that unfolds.

2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:03.900
 I would not have predicted it had I been alive then.

2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:07.580
 I see the war behind us.

2:23:07.580 --> 2:23:16.860
 I see a prosperity on the horizon, yes, inflation in Germany and many other difficult issues,

2:23:16.860 --> 2:23:21.740
 but there are more democracies now than there were before the war, and the old empires are

2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:28.300
 gone, and there's a cultural efflorescence, and there's modernism in the arts, and there's

2:23:28.300 --> 2:23:34.700
 women entering the public sphere, and there's all this fantastic new technology like automobiles.

2:23:34.700 --> 2:23:40.860
 I'm looking at the future from 1922, and I'm not seeing the Great Depression, and I'm

2:23:40.860 --> 2:23:47.380
 not seeing World War II, and I'm not seeing the Holocaust, because I don't predict the

2:23:47.380 --> 2:23:54.140
 future, and nobody in 1922 could see that future, although I guess there were some clairvoyance

2:23:54.140 --> 2:23:55.740
 who predicted it.

2:23:55.740 --> 2:23:57.620
 But you're not one of them?

2:23:57.620 --> 2:24:03.460
 I'm not one of them, but this is what I know, Lex, from studying history.

2:24:03.460 --> 2:24:07.140
 What I know is stuff happens.

2:24:07.140 --> 2:24:15.340
 In other words, we're watching Ukraine war right now, and all of our attention is focused

2:24:15.340 --> 2:24:22.340
 on that, and it's like the economists say in their textbooks when their powerful models

2:24:22.340 --> 2:24:31.340
 are employed, and there's this line that says, all other factors held constant, comma, and

2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:35.180
 then the model works, and you get this really great result.

2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:42.500
 It's very powerful predictor and analysis the model, and the whole game is all other

2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:45.500
 factors held constant.

2:24:45.500 --> 2:24:49.340
 So the Russian Ukraine war that we've been discussing, and this could happen, and that

2:24:49.340 --> 2:24:53.220
 could happen, but you know what stuff could happen, Lex?

2:24:53.220 --> 2:24:58.900
 For example, the Israeli government could decide this summer that it's going to bomb

2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:06.180
 Iran because no Israeli government will tolerate Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, and since

2:25:06.180 --> 2:25:14.860
 President Trump exited, unilaterally exited from the multi power nuclear agreement, Iran

2:25:14.860 --> 2:25:22.220
 is now much closer to the bomb than they were when the United States was still in that agreement.

2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:26.060
 And you tell me the Israeli government that says, sure, it's fine, it's okay, Iran can

2:25:26.060 --> 2:25:28.220
 get the bomb.

2:25:28.220 --> 2:25:32.420
 And so maybe that happens, and maybe that happens as early as this summer as Iran gets

2:25:32.420 --> 2:25:36.020
 closer and closer and closer.

2:25:36.020 --> 2:25:45.180
 Maybe that guy in North Korea decides it's his time, just like his grandfather in 1950

2:25:45.180 --> 2:25:53.140
 decided it's time we're going to quote reunify unquote the Korean Peninsula.

2:25:53.140 --> 2:25:56.460
 Maybe, I don't know, Lex, fill in the blank.

2:25:56.460 --> 2:26:00.140
 Iran's going to happen, it's not going to be what I predict, it's not going to be what

2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:07.180
 I'm watching, it's going to be obvious only after it happens, not before, and then it's

2:26:07.180 --> 2:26:10.220
 going to upend the table.

2:26:10.220 --> 2:26:16.020
 And all of a sudden, we're going to be in a different environment, different circumstances,

2:26:16.020 --> 2:26:23.140
 and is Ukraine still as central at that point as it seems to be right now?

2:26:23.140 --> 2:26:24.980
 I don't know the answer to that question.

2:26:24.980 --> 2:26:30.100
 Let me ask two rapid fire questions, you're only allowed to have one minute and it's about

2:26:30.100 --> 2:26:32.260
 predicting the future.

2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:40.260
 Okay, question one, Vladimir Putin, when will he no longer be in office?

2:26:40.260 --> 2:26:45.460
 And will he step down or be overthrown?

2:26:45.460 --> 2:26:49.500
 What's your prediction and a brief explanation of that prediction?

2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:53.740
 Now, nobody can predict the future, but what's your sense now?

2:26:53.740 --> 2:26:59.460
 Some people are saying the pressure is building, he's going to be overthrown or stepped down

2:26:59.460 --> 2:27:01.180
 at the end of this year.

2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:09.340
 And some people say, surely he's going to outlast Stalin's rule of 30 plus years.

2:27:09.340 --> 2:27:18.660
 No evidence of a coup yet, none whatsoever yet.

2:27:18.660 --> 2:27:25.780
 He's pretty much at life expectancy for a Russian male, those are bad numbers.

2:27:25.780 --> 2:27:29.420
 He's 69, going to be 70.

2:27:29.420 --> 2:27:36.060
 So he's lived the life of a Russian male already, but he's got better doctors than the majority

2:27:36.060 --> 2:27:42.820
 of the Russian males in that, let's say, comparison set.

2:27:42.820 --> 2:27:47.700
 So he could live a very long time with good doctors.

2:27:47.700 --> 2:27:54.500
 So there could be a coup at some point, but there's none today in evidence.

2:27:54.500 --> 2:28:01.060
 He could go because he's reached the life expectancy or he could stay for a long time.

2:28:01.060 --> 2:28:09.980
 The thing to watch about this is an organization that nobody pays attention to, the FSL, the

2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:21.740
 Pratorian Guard, the Self Standing Bodyguard Directorate, the only organization in Russia

2:28:21.740 --> 2:28:24.340
 that has any access to him.

2:28:24.340 --> 2:28:31.380
 We've seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks, no defections, nothing in the public

2:28:31.380 --> 2:28:39.940
 realm in open sources about any divisions or problems in the FSO in the Pratorian Guard.

2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:49.460
 So if you can't break that, change that, elicit defections there, you can't overturn

2:28:49.460 --> 2:28:50.460
 him.

2:28:50.460 --> 2:28:55.460
 Authoritarian regimes, like they're terrible, they fail at everything.

2:28:55.460 --> 2:29:00.740
 They can't feed their people, they have trouble achieving any goals.

2:29:00.740 --> 2:29:04.220
 They only have to be good, however, at one thing.

2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:09.060
 They only have to be good at the complete suppression of political alternatives.

2:29:09.060 --> 2:29:14.940
 If you can suppress political alternatives, you can fail at everything else, but you can

2:29:14.940 --> 2:29:17.740
 survive as an authoritarian regime.

2:29:17.740 --> 2:29:20.260
 So you watch Navalny.

2:29:20.260 --> 2:29:22.140
 That's question number two.

2:29:22.140 --> 2:29:28.460
 That's my second rapid fire question, is what happens to Navalny?

2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:33.740
 What are the possible conclusions of, what you said quite possibly the second most influential

2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:41.100
 powerful figure in Russia, is he going to die in jail?

2:29:41.100 --> 2:29:44.700
 Will he become the next president of Russia?

2:29:44.700 --> 2:29:45.700
 What are the possible?

2:29:45.700 --> 2:29:47.420
 I wish I knew Lex.

2:29:47.420 --> 2:29:50.460
 I've been surprised that he's still alive.

2:29:50.460 --> 2:29:57.300
 I've been worried that he will be killed in prison in a staged fight.

2:29:57.300 --> 2:30:04.740
 A security officer, prison guard puts on a prison outfit, takes a lead pipe, goes into

2:30:04.740 --> 2:30:08.620
 the cell, they have a, quote, fight, and Navalny is killed.

2:30:08.620 --> 2:30:14.620
 I've been afraid of that, but he's still alive, even though he's serving a long sentence.

2:30:14.620 --> 2:30:21.260
 So that leads me to guess that people inside the Putin regime and maybe President Putin

2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:29.420
 himself understand that Navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions.

2:30:29.420 --> 2:30:35.100
 That Navalny is even more popular outside of Russia than he is inside of Russia.

2:30:35.100 --> 2:30:41.260
 You know, he's the leader in many ways of the political opposition in the country, even

2:30:41.260 --> 2:30:42.860
 while still in prison.

2:30:42.860 --> 2:30:48.660
 His organization's been destroyed, but he doesn't have majority support in the population

2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:50.460
 by any stretch of the imagination.

2:30:50.460 --> 2:30:55.340
 But he's a big figure in the West, including here in the U.S.

2:30:55.340 --> 2:31:00.500
 And so Navalny could be their ticket, their kind of get out of jail card, meaning they

2:31:00.500 --> 2:31:02.700
 release him from prison.

2:31:02.700 --> 2:31:07.980
 He gets appointed, I don't know, prime minister, even by the Putin regime, if he were willing

2:31:07.980 --> 2:31:09.540
 to accept such a position.

2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:11.980
 And I have my doubts about that.

2:31:11.980 --> 2:31:17.340
 And then that's how they lobby to remove the sanctions against them.

2:31:17.340 --> 2:31:21.820
 So he's a card that President Putin could play.

2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:26.860
 And so maybe that's the reason he's still alive, or maybe there are other reasons that

2:31:26.860 --> 2:31:28.700
 we don't know.

2:31:28.700 --> 2:31:38.860
 And so some alternative to Putin is more likely to arise inside his gang, Putin's kaeshaika,

2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:45.860
 as they say, right inside his gang, where they tire of his mistakes.

2:31:45.860 --> 2:31:49.780
 They tire of his self defeating actions.

2:31:49.780 --> 2:31:55.780
 And they say, patriotically for Russia, we need to do something against, move against

2:31:55.780 --> 2:32:02.420
 this guy because he's hurting our country and also because I could do better.

2:32:02.420 --> 2:32:05.940
 I'm ambitious as well as patriotic.

2:32:05.940 --> 2:32:13.100
 But once again, the problem there, Alex, is Putin is surrounded by this cocoon known

2:32:13.100 --> 2:32:15.740
 as the FSO.

2:32:15.740 --> 2:32:21.180
 He meets on Zoom predominantly with the rest of the government, including with the defense

2:32:21.180 --> 2:32:24.060
 and security officials.

2:32:24.060 --> 2:32:27.980
 They don't have frequent access to his person.

2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:33.620
 And as you were looting earlier to the pandemic, they have to quarantine for two weeks before

2:32:33.620 --> 2:32:35.580
 every meeting with him.

2:32:35.580 --> 2:32:39.740
 And moreover, you know, Alex, they don't know where he is.

2:32:39.740 --> 2:32:47.900
 They see when they're on Zoom with him and in the room, it's the Valdai.

2:32:47.900 --> 2:32:56.020
 His office in the Valdai region looks the same as his office in Sochi or his office

2:32:56.020 --> 2:33:02.620
 outside of Moscow and Nova Agarjova, they're made up to look very similar on Zoom.

2:33:02.620 --> 2:33:08.580
 And sure, some signs, they're looking where is it, but maybe they don't know.

2:33:08.580 --> 2:33:17.420
 And so you're going to move on him and you're going to jump him in his dacha outside Moscow.

2:33:17.420 --> 2:33:20.340
 And it turns out he's in Sochi or vice versa.

2:33:20.340 --> 2:33:25.020
 And it turns out the FSO is loyal to him and won't let you anyway.

2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:33.260
 So Alex, we don't know, but we watch this FSO really closely and we think that the elites,

2:33:33.260 --> 2:33:39.500
 if not Putin, but maybe Putin to understand Navalny as a really big potential political

2:33:39.500 --> 2:33:42.020
 card that they could play.

2:33:42.020 --> 2:33:49.420
 And one last question, the biggest question, you studied some of the darkest aspects of

2:33:49.420 --> 2:33:55.220
 human history, human nature, let me ask the why question.

2:33:55.220 --> 2:33:57.340
 What are we doing here?

2:33:57.340 --> 2:34:01.940
 What's the meaning of our existence, our life here on earth?

2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:04.580
 What are we humans trying to get at here?

2:34:04.580 --> 2:34:12.980
 I can't answer that question either, but I can say that having a purposeful life is

2:34:12.980 --> 2:34:15.780
 actually not that hard.

2:34:15.780 --> 2:34:23.060
 You can't, you're not Gandhi, you're not President Roosevelt, you're not going to transform a

2:34:23.060 --> 2:34:31.740
 country or a civilization or become immortal because of your courage and your insight and

2:34:31.740 --> 2:34:35.460
 your genius at critical moments.

2:34:35.460 --> 2:34:42.460
 But you live in an environment, you're in a school, you're in a workplace, you're somewhere

2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:46.760
 where you can affect other people in a positive way.

2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:51.140
 It can be not just about yourself, but it can be about them.

2:34:51.140 --> 2:34:57.340
 And you can have a positive impact on other people's lives through the work that you do,

2:34:57.340 --> 2:35:03.300
 whether that's your employment or your charity or your spare time or your work time.

2:35:03.300 --> 2:35:13.140
 It can be by modeling proper behavior, admitting your mistakes, hard to do but necessary, remembering

2:35:13.140 --> 2:35:16.780
 that you don't know everything, you can't predict the future, but you don't even know

2:35:16.780 --> 2:35:24.180
 everything in your areas of expertise, painfully reminded of that humility at times, but remind

2:35:24.180 --> 2:35:26.100
 yourself to.

2:35:26.100 --> 2:35:35.380
 So you can lead a life that can show others what good values are, and you can lead a life

2:35:35.380 --> 2:35:42.340
 that dedicates yourself not only to your own material well being, but to the well being

2:35:42.340 --> 2:35:47.580
 and to the development of others around you, and it can be on a humble scale, it can be

2:35:47.580 --> 2:35:54.820
 in a small classroom or a small workplace, a small work team, but it can be done and

2:35:54.820 --> 2:36:01.460
 you can be reminded that having a positive impact even on one other person gives far

2:36:01.460 --> 2:36:09.460
 greater meaning to your own life and is profoundly satisfying, much more satisfying than the attention

2:36:09.460 --> 2:36:15.420
 you might get, let's say on social media or awards you might receive.

2:36:15.420 --> 2:36:22.580
 There's nothing wrong with pursuing those, people pursue them and it's a free society.

2:36:22.580 --> 2:36:28.220
 But leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible.

2:36:28.220 --> 2:36:35.060
 Even just one person, I love the expression, say one life, save the world, just focusing

2:36:35.060 --> 2:36:40.980
 on the local, on the tiny little difference you can make in the world can somehow ripple.

2:36:40.980 --> 2:36:42.180
 Every day.

2:36:42.180 --> 2:36:49.820
 If you think about that every single day, you're a better person, we're a better society.

2:36:49.820 --> 2:36:54.540
 And maybe you get to add a bit of love to the world after all.

2:36:54.540 --> 2:37:02.540
 Stephen, this is a huge honor for many reasons, one of which is I can just tell how much care

2:37:02.540 --> 2:37:08.980
 you put into this conversation and how much, I use the word love a lot, but I just feel

2:37:08.980 --> 2:37:17.340
 the love that just even the respect you give me, which I can't tell you how energizing

2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:23.860
 that is, how much that gives me strength for my own silly little pursuits.

2:37:23.860 --> 2:37:25.020
 Thank you so much for doing that.

2:37:25.020 --> 2:37:29.900
 Thank you for not just talking today, but giving me so much respect just with everything

2:37:29.900 --> 2:37:33.860
 you're doing is, I really appreciate that, it makes me feel special.

2:37:33.860 --> 2:37:36.500
 So thank you so much for sitting down and talking to me.

2:37:36.500 --> 2:37:41.740
 Mutual Lex, thank you as well, and thank you for the respect that you've shown me.

2:37:41.740 --> 2:37:46.420
 These are really difficult issues that don't have simple answers, but that doesn't mean

2:37:46.420 --> 2:37:48.460
 we give up.

2:37:48.460 --> 2:37:55.580
 We have to keep thinking and learning and trying and finding solutions in everything

2:37:55.580 --> 2:38:01.220
 we do, including on these, these big global tragedies that we live through.

2:38:01.220 --> 2:38:04.900
 And it's heartbreaking what's going on.

2:38:04.900 --> 2:38:06.660
 It just breaks my heart every day.

2:38:06.660 --> 2:38:13.420
 A person who studies this has been studying this for decades and it keeps happening.

2:38:13.420 --> 2:38:19.660
 And you think again, and yes, it is again, but we still have to keep trying and we have

2:38:19.660 --> 2:38:25.340
 to be inspired by those people who are more courageous than we are and sacrifice more

2:38:25.340 --> 2:38:27.340
 than we sacrifice.

2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:33.900
 You know, for me, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the war in Ukraine is experienced

2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:40.580
 in my study at home and in my office at Princeton or my coming office at Stanford when I moved

2:38:40.580 --> 2:38:48.740
 full time to Stanford in September, or it's experienced far away in safety and in comfort.

2:38:48.740 --> 2:38:53.140
 And we have to remember that too, when we talk about these things, when we answer your

2:38:53.140 --> 2:38:59.900
 questions, right, that as we speak and as we comment and think we're experts on these

2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:06.140
 things from the comfort of our existence, that there are people in those tragedies right

2:39:06.140 --> 2:39:07.140
 now.

2:39:07.140 --> 2:39:15.740
 With no power, with no food, with full uncertainty about the future of the health of their children.

2:39:15.740 --> 2:39:24.740
 And I've also seen because I have family in both places, homes that were home for, buildings

2:39:24.740 --> 2:39:29.660
 that were homes for generations now in rubble.

2:39:29.660 --> 2:39:30.660
 So.

2:39:30.660 --> 2:39:31.660
 Yes, Lex.

2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:33.260
 It just, it hurts.

2:39:33.260 --> 2:39:41.660
 And it's, it's, let's, it's Syria, where 350,000 at least by UN estimates died and Russia

2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:44.060
 participated in that.

2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:49.420
 And it's Yemen and, and it's so many other places that don't have the same degree of

2:39:49.420 --> 2:39:53.660
 attention that a European country like Ukraine has.

2:39:53.660 --> 2:40:01.540
 But, but yeah, we have to remember also that in addition to Ukraine, and then there's things

2:40:01.540 --> 2:40:08.900
 right home here in New York city, where children are without food, which is just inexcusable

2:40:08.900 --> 2:40:11.060
 in a country this rich.

2:40:11.060 --> 2:40:15.620
 So we shouldn't forget in our study of leaders and our study of geopolitics that ultimately

2:40:15.620 --> 2:40:20.980
 it's about the humanity, it's about the human beings and, okay, Lex.

2:40:20.980 --> 2:40:21.980
 Human suffering.

2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:22.980
 Thank you so much.

2:40:22.980 --> 2:40:23.980
 Thank you.

2:40:23.980 --> 2:40:24.980
 This is amazing conversation.

2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:25.980
 Talk to you again soon.

2:40:25.980 --> 2:40:26.980
 My pleasure.

2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:32.580
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Stephen Codkin to support this podcast.

2:40:32.580 --> 2:40:35.620
 Please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:40:35.620 --> 2:40:40.820
 And now let me leave you with some words from Mahatma Gandhi.

2:40:40.820 --> 2:40:46.860
 When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love have always

2:40:46.860 --> 2:40:47.860
 won.

2:40:47.860 --> 2:40:54.300
 There have been tyrants and murderers, and for time, they can seem invincible, but in

2:40:54.300 --> 2:40:57.980
 the end, they always fall.

2:40:57.980 --> 2:41:24.940
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
