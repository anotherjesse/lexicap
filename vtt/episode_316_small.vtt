00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 Will there be a war between U.S. and China in the 21st century?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
 If there is, we're finished.

00:08.000 --> 00:18.000
 A war between the U.S. and China would destroy the possibilities of organized life on Earth.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
 The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky, his second time in the podcast.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
 This episode is focused on the war in Ukraine.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
 And it is a departure from the way I usually do this podcast in several ways.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
 Noam is a strong and healthy 93 year old, but this conversation is remote to be cautious.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
 It is brief, only one hour.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
 It is more of an interview than a conversation due to the limitations of our audio and video connection.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
 I decided it's best to get Noam's clear thoughts on this war

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
 and the complicated geopolitics of today and the rest of the 21st century that is unrolling before us

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
 with our decisions and actions fully capable of either helping humanity flourish

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
 or unleashing global destruction and suffering.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
 As a brief aside, perhaps you know this, but let me mention that I traveled to Ukraine

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
 and saw, heard, felt things that are haunting and gave me a lot to think about.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
 Because of that, I've been really struggling to edit the videos I recorded.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
 I hope to finish it soon.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
 I'm sorry for these delays and I'm especially sorry to the people there who gave me their time, their story, their heart.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
 Please be patient with me. I hope you understand.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
 This is the Lex Readman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
 And now, dear friends, here's Noam Chomsky.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
 You have studied and criticized powerful leaders in nations in times of global conflict and struggles for power.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
 So let me ask you, what do you think motivates Vladimir Putin?

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
 Is it power, legacy, fame, geopolitical influence, or the flourishing of a nation he loves and represents?

02:11.000 --> 02:28.000
 I have no particular insight into Putin's mind. I can only watch the actions over the last 20, 25 years and read the statements.

02:28.000 --> 02:51.000
 It took power about almost 25 years ago. He's held it since as Prime Minister, President. His first task was to try to overcome the chaos and disarray of the 1990s.

02:51.000 --> 03:07.000
 During the 90s, Gorbachev had a proposal. He called for a cooperative enterprise with the West.

03:07.000 --> 03:22.000
 They would share an effort to rebuild what he called a common European home in which there would be no military alliances.

03:22.000 --> 03:37.000
 They would turn U.S. accommodation with a move towards social democracy and former USSR and comparable moves in the United States.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
 Well, that was quickly smashed. The United States had no interest in that.

03:43.000 --> 04:04.000
 Clinton came along pretty soon, early 90s. Russia was induced to adopt what was called shock therapy, harsh, quick market transformation, which devastated the economy,

04:04.000 --> 04:18.000
 created enormous social disarray, rise of what are called oligarchs, kleptocrats, high mortality.

04:18.000 --> 04:40.000
 And Clinton started the policy of expanding NATO to the East in violation of firm unambiguous promises to Gorbachev not to do so. Yeltsin, Putin's friend opposed it, other Russian leaders opposed it, but they didn't react.

04:40.000 --> 04:59.000
 They accepted it. When Putin came in, he continued that policy. Meanwhile, did reconstruct the Russian economy, Russian society became a viable, deeply authoritarian society under his tight control.

04:59.000 --> 05:18.000
 He himself was organized a major kleptocracy with him in the middle, barely became very wealthy. On the international front, he pretty much continued the former policies as U.S. diplomats,

05:18.000 --> 05:39.000
 practically every diplomat who had any contact with Russia that didn't dispatch their knew about it, as they all warned from the 90s, that what Clinton was doing, spanned it by his, by Bush, Bush to afterwards, was reckless and provocative.

05:39.000 --> 05:54.000
 That Russia did have a clear red line before Putin, which he adhered to, namely no NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia.

05:54.000 --> 06:19.000
 This is pretty much how things went on through the 2000s, 2014, 2008, George Bush, President Bush did invite Ukraine to join NATO that was vetoed by France and Germany, but under U.S. pressure it was kept on the agenda.

06:19.000 --> 06:37.000
 The Russians continued to object to Western diplomats, including the present current head of the CIA and its predecessors, warned that this was reckless, provocative, shouldn't be done, continued.

06:37.000 --> 06:57.000
 Putin didn't do much, he stayed with it until pretty recently. After 2014, the uprising that threw out the former president who was pro Russian instituted anti Russian laws,

06:57.000 --> 07:18.000
 the United States NATO began to a policy of moving to effectively integrate Ukraine into the NATO command, joint military exercises, training, sending weapons and so on.

07:18.000 --> 07:43.000
 Putin objected, other Russian leaders objected, they're unified on this, but didn't do much, continued with the proposals that Ukraine be excluded from NATO and that there be some form of autonomy for the Donbass region.

07:43.000 --> 08:02.000
 Meanwhile, in reaction to the uprising 2014, Russia moved in and took over Crimea, protecting its warm water base and major naval base.

08:02.000 --> 08:14.000
 The U.S. objected and recognized it, but things continued without notable conflict. Won't go through all the details when Joe Biden came in.

08:14.000 --> 08:42.000
 And he expanded the program of what U.S. military journals called de facto integration of Ukraine within NATO developed proposed September 2021 proposed enhanced program of preparation for NATO mission extended

08:42.000 --> 09:01.000
 formal statement in November. We're now practically up to the invasion. Putin's position hardened. France, mainly France to an extent Germany did make some moves towards possible negotiations.

09:01.000 --> 09:16.000
 Putin dismissed them, moved on to the direct invasion. That's what what are his to get back to your question, what motivates him.

09:16.000 --> 09:42.000
 I presume what he's been saying all along, namely, establishing his legacy as a leader who overcame the extensive destruction of Russia massive weakening over restored his position as a world power, prevented Ukraine from entering NATO,

09:42.000 --> 09:50.000
 may have further ambitions as to dominating and controlling Ukraine very likely.

09:50.000 --> 10:17.000
 There is a theory in the West that he suddenly became a total madman who wants to restore the great Russian Empire. This is combined with the clothing over the fact that the Russian military is a paper tiger that can't even conquer cities a couple of kilometers

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
 from the border but defended not even by a regular army.

10:23.000 --> 10:49.000
 But somehow along with this, he's planning to attack NATO powers, conquer Europe, who knows what. It's impossible to put all these concepts together. They're totally internally contradictory. So what's my judgment? I think what motivates him is what has been demonstrating in his actions.

10:49.000 --> 11:11.000
 Restore Russia as a great power, restore its economy, control it as a total dictatorship, enrich himself and his cronies, establish a legacy as a major figure in Russian history.

11:11.000 --> 11:28.000
 Make sure that Ukraine does not join NATO and probably by now he's hardened the position, maintain Crimea and the southeastern corridor to Russia and

11:28.000 --> 11:55.000
 some ambiguous agreements about the Donbass region. That looks like his motivation. There's much speculation that goes beyond this but it's very hard to reconcile with the assessment of the real world by the same people who are making the grandiose speculations.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
 Putin has been in power for 22 years. Do you think power has corrupted him?

12:01.000 --> 12:26.000
 I don't think anything's changed. It seems to me his policies are about the same as what they were. They've changed in response to change circumstances. So very recently, right before the invasion, a few weeks before, for the first time, Putin announced recognition

12:26.000 --> 12:46.000
 of the independence of the Donbass region. That's a stronger position than before, much stronger. Up till then he had pretty much kept the long standing position of some kind of accommodation within a federal structure in which the

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
 Donbass region would have considerable autonomy. So that's a heartening of the position.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
 Even the human mind of Vladimir Putin, the man.

12:58.000 --> 13:09.000
 I can't read his mind. I can only see the policies that he's pursued and the statements that he's made. There are many people speculating about his mind.

13:09.000 --> 13:31.000
 I say these speculations are, first of all, not based on anything. Never said anything about trying to conquer NATO. But more importantly, they are totally inconsistent with the analyses of Russian power by the same people who are making the speculations.

13:31.000 --> 13:55.000
 So we see the same individual speculating about Putin's grandiose plans to become Peter the Great and conquer, start attacking NATO powers on the one hand saying that, on the other hand, gloating over the fact that his military powers

13:55.000 --> 14:07.000
 so minuscule, he can't even conquer the towns a couple miles from the border. Well, it's impossible to make sense of that position.

14:07.000 --> 14:17.000
 Why did Russia invade Ukraine on February 24th? Who do you think is to blame? Who do you place the blame on?

14:17.000 --> 14:42.000
 Well, who's to blame? Any power that commits aggression is to blame. So I continue to say, as I have been for many months, that the Putin's invasion of Ukraine is on a par with such acts of aggression as the US invasion of Iraq,

14:42.000 --> 14:58.000
 the Stalin, Hitler invasion of Poland, other acts of supreme international crime under international law, aggression. Of course, he's to blame.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
 The US committed 6.9 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion. Should US keep up with the support?

15:08.000 --> 15:18.000
 There are two questions. One has to do with providing support for defense against the invasion, which is certainly legitimate.

15:18.000 --> 15:43.000
 The other is seeking ways to end the crime before even worse disasters arise. Now, that second part is not discussed in the West, barely discussed. Anyone who dares discuss it is immediately subjected to a flood of invective and hysterical condemnation.

15:43.000 --> 15:54.000
 But if you're serious about Ukraine, there are two things you ask. One, what can we do to support Ukraine in defense against aggression?

15:54.000 --> 16:17.000
 Second, how can we end, move to end the war before it leads to even worse destruction of Ukraine, more starvation worldwide, reversing the efforts, the limited efforts to deal with global warming, possibly moving up an escalation out of the war, the nuclear war.

16:17.000 --> 16:38.000
 That's the second half of the borrow phrase attributed to Winston Churchill. There's a lot of war, war, but no joy, joy, joy. And there ought to be joy, joy if you care about Ukraine and the rest of the world.

16:38.000 --> 17:07.000
 Can it be done? We don't know. Official US policy is to reject a diplomatic settlement, to move to weaken Russia severely so that it cannot carry out further aggression, but not do anything on the joy, joy side, not think of how to bring the crimes and atrocities to an end.

17:07.000 --> 17:34.000
 That's the second part of the question. So, yes, the US should continue with the kind of calibrated support that's been given. The Pentagon wisely has vetoed the initiatives to go well beyond support for defense up to attack on Russia.

17:34.000 --> 17:50.000
 So far, the Pentagon, which seems to be the dovish component in the US administration, has vetoed plans which very likely would lead on to nuclear war, which would destroy everything.

17:50.000 --> 18:16.000
 So, calibrated provision of weapons to blunt the offensive, allow Ukraine to defend itself, if sensible, combined with efforts to see if something can be done to bring the crimes and atrocities to an end, inadvertently, much worse consequences that are in store.

18:16.000 --> 18:29.000
 That would be all instead the US only dealing with the first, and all of our discussions limit themselves to the first in the United States and in Britain, not in Europe.

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
 Do you worry about nuclear war in the 21st century? How do we avoid it?

18:35.000 --> 18:55.000
 Anyone who doesn't worry about nuclear war doesn't have a great sale functioning. Of course, everyone is worried about nuclear war, nor should they. It's very easy to see how steps could be taken, they've even been recommended, that would lead to nuclear war.

18:55.000 --> 19:08.000
 So you can read articles even by liberal commentators who say we should drop all the pretenses, just go to war against Russia, they have to be destroyed.

19:08.000 --> 19:37.000
 You can see proposals coming from Congress, the leading figures saying we should establish a no fly zone. Pentagon objects, they point out correctly that to establish a no fly zone, you have to have control of the air, which means destroying Russian air defense systems, which happen to be inside Russia.

19:37.000 --> 19:58.000
 We don't know that Russia won't react. Even the cold, now almost universal, to ensure that Ukraine wins drives out all the Russians, drives them out of the country, sounds nice on paper, but notice the assumption.

19:58.000 --> 20:20.000
 The assumption is that Vladimir Putin, this mad man who just seeks power and is out of control, will sit there quietly, accept defeat, slink away, not use the military means that of course he has to destroy Ukraine.

20:20.000 --> 20:41.000
 One of the interesting comments that came out in today's long article, I think Washington Post reviewing a lot of leaks from, not leaks actually presented by US intelligence and US leaders about the long buildup to the war.

20:41.000 --> 21:05.000
 One of the points that made was surprised on the part of British and US leaders about Putin's strategy and his failure to adopt, to fight the war the way the US and Britain would, with real shock and awe, destruction of communication facilities, energy facilities and so on.

21:05.000 --> 21:25.000
 Can't understand why he hasn't done all that. Well, could. If you want to make it very likely that that'll happen, then insist on fighting until somehow Russia faces total defeat, then it's a gamble.

21:25.000 --> 21:36.000
 But if he's just crazy and insane as you claim, presumably will use weapons that he hasn't used yet to destroy Ukraine.

21:36.000 --> 21:59.000
 So the West is taking an extraordinary gamble with the fate of Ukraine, gambling that the mad man, lunatic, mad Vlad, won't use the weapons he has to destroy Ukraine and set the stage for escalation of the latter, which might lead to nuclear war.

21:59.000 --> 22:09.000
 It's quite a gamble. How much propaganda is there in the world today in Russia in Ukraine in the West? Extraordinary.

22:09.000 --> 22:36.000
 In Russia, of course, it's total. Ukraine is a different story. There are war propaganda in the West. Well, let me quote Graham Fuller, very highly placed in US intelligence, one of the top officials for decades, dealing mostly with Russia and Central Asia.

22:36.000 --> 22:53.000
 He recently said that in all the years of the Cold War, he's never seen any extreme Russophobia to the extent that he sees today. I think that's pretty accurate.

22:53.000 --> 23:14.000
 I mean, the US has even canceled Russian outlets, which means if you want to find out what Seri Lover of the Russian officials are saying, you can't look it up on their own outlets.

23:14.000 --> 23:31.000
 You have to go through Al Jazeera, Indian state television or some place where they still allow Russian positions to be expressed. And of course, the propaganda is just outlandish.

23:31.000 --> 23:46.000
 I think Fuller is quite correct on this. In Russia, of course, you expected total propaganda. There's nothing, any independent outlets such as there were have been crushed.

23:46.000 --> 23:54.000
 If the media is a source of inaccuracies and even lies, then how do we find the truth?

23:54.000 --> 24:10.000
 I don't regard the media as a source of, as a source of inaccuracies and lies. They do exist. But by and large, media reporting is reasonably accurate.

24:10.000 --> 24:27.000
 Reporters, the journalists themselves, as in the past, do courageous, honest work. I've written about this for 50 years. My opinion hasn't changed.

24:27.000 --> 24:46.000
 They do pick certain things and not other things. There's selection, there's framing, there's ways of presenting things, all of that forms a kind of propaganda system, which you have to work your way through.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
 But it's rarely a matter of straight outright lying.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
 So there's a difference between propaganda and lying.

24:54.000 --> 25:07.000
 Of course, propaganda system shapes and limits the material that's presented. It may tell the truth within that framework.

25:07.000 --> 25:20.000
 So let me give you a concrete example, which I wrote about extensively. I have a book called Manufacturing Consent jointly with Edward Herman.

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
 It's about his term, which I had accepted a propaganda model of the media.

25:27.000 --> 25:37.000
 A large part of the book is defense of the media. Defense of the media against harsh attacks by Freedom House.

25:37.000 --> 25:48.000
 Several volumes, they published attacking the media, charging that the media were so adversarial and dishonest that they lost the war in Vietnam.

25:48.000 --> 25:58.000
 Well, it took the trouble of reading through the two volumes. One volume is charges, the next volume is evidence.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
 Turns out that all of the evidence is lies. They had no evidence. They were just lying.

26:06.000 --> 26:25.000
 The media, in fact, the journalists were doing an honest, courageous work, but within a certain framework, a framework of assuming that the American cause was basically just, basically honorable,

26:25.000 --> 26:41.000
 making mistakes, doing bad things. But the idea of questioning that the United States was engaged in a major war crime, that's off the record.

26:41.000 --> 26:50.000
 So unfortunately, there was this crime and that crime, which harmed their effort to do good and so on.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
 Well, that's not lying. It's propaganda. So how do we find the truth?

26:56.000 --> 27:07.000
 How do we find the truth? That's what you have a brain for. It's not deep. It's quite shallow. It's not quantum physics.

27:07.000 --> 27:15.000
 Put a little effort into it. Think about, look for other sources. Think a little about history.

27:15.000 --> 27:25.000
 Look at the documentary record. They're all pretty well fools together and you can get a reasonable understanding of what's happening.

27:25.000 --> 27:35.000
 If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin and ask him a question or talk to him about an idea, what would you say?

27:35.000 --> 27:45.000
 I would walk out of the room just as with almost any other leader. I know what he's going to say. I read the party line. I read his pronouncements.

27:45.000 --> 27:59.000
 Doesn't want to hear from me. Am I going to say, why did you carry out a crime that's comparable to the US invasion of Iraq and the Stalin Hitler invasion of Poland?

27:59.000 --> 28:15.000
 I'm going to ask that question. If I met with John F. Kennedy, say, would I ask, why did you radically escalate the war in Vietnam, launch the US Air Force,

28:15.000 --> 28:33.000
 authorize an APOM, drive launch programs to drive villagers who you know are supporting the National Liberation Front, drive them into concentration camps to separate them from the forces they're defending?

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
 Would I have asked him that? Of course not.

28:37.000 --> 28:51.000
 Do you think the people who led us into the war in Vietnam, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the war in Ukraine are evil?

28:51.000 --> 29:08.000
 I mean, it's very hard to be in a position of leadership, of a violent, aggressive power without carrying out evil acts or the people evil.

29:08.000 --> 29:18.000
 I mean, I'm not their moral advisors. I don't know anything about them. I look at their actions, their statements, their policies,

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
 evaluate those and other families can evaluate their personalities.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
 Will there be a war between US and China in the 21st century?

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
 If there is, we're finished.

29:33.000 --> 29:55.000
 A war between the US and China would destroy the possibilities of organized life on Earth. In fact, we can put it differently unless the US and China reach an accommodation and work together and cooperatively.

29:55.000 --> 30:15.000
 It's very unlikely that organized human society will survive. We are facing enormous problems, problems, destruction of the environment, pandemics, threat of nuclear war.

30:15.000 --> 30:26.000
 None of these decline of democratic functioning of an arena for rational discourse, none of these things have boundaries.

30:26.000 --> 30:37.000
 We either work together to overcome them, which we can do, or we'll all think together. That's the real question we should be asking.

30:37.000 --> 30:53.000
 What the United States is doing is not helping. So the current US policy, which is perfectly open, nothing secret about it, is to what's called encircle China.

30:53.000 --> 31:19.000
 It's the official word with sentinel states, South Korea, Japan, Australia, which will be heavily armed, provided by Biden with precision weapons aimed at China, backed by major naval operations,

31:19.000 --> 31:33.000
 huge naval operation just took place in the Pacific. Many nations participating, RIMPAC, didn't get reported here as far as I know, but an enormous operation threatening China.

31:33.000 --> 31:54.000
 All of this to encircle China, to continue with policies like that. Somebody like Pelosi, just to probably make her look more, I don't know what, what her motives are,

31:54.000 --> 32:10.000
 having a highly provocative, stupid act, opposed by the military, opposed by the White House, yes, acts like that, which of course called for the response of highly dangerous.

32:10.000 --> 32:31.000
 We don't have to do that. We don't have to increase the threat. I mean, right now, the last NATO summit, take a look at it. For the first time, it invited to attend countries that are in the sentinel states surrounding China,

32:31.000 --> 32:56.000
 circling China from the east, and it in fact extended the range of NATO to what's called the Indo Pacific region. So all of us, by now, the North Atlantic includes the whole Indo Pacific region to try to ensure that we can overcome the so called China threat.

32:56.000 --> 33:16.000
 Similarly, we might ask exactly what the China threat is. It's done sometimes. So former Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating, well known international diplomat, had an article a while ago in the Australian press,

33:16.000 --> 33:30.000
 that's right in the claws of the dragon, asking, going through what the China threat is, he ran through the various claims, finally concluded, the China threat is that China exists.

33:30.000 --> 33:49.000
 It exists. It does not follow US orders. It's not like Europe. Europe does what the United States tells it to do, even if it doesn't like it. China just ignores what the US says. There's a formal way of describing this.

33:49.000 --> 34:04.000
 There are two versions of the international order. One version is the UN based international order, which theoretically we subscribe to, but we don't accept.

34:04.000 --> 34:27.000
 The UN based international order is unacceptable to the United States, because it bans US foreign policy. Literally, it explicitly bans the threat or use of force in international affairs, except under circumstances that almost never arise.

34:27.000 --> 34:36.000
 Well, that's US foreign policy. Try to find a president who isn't engaged in the threat or use of force in international affairs.

34:36.000 --> 34:49.000
 Okay, so obviously we can't accept the UN based international system, even though under the Constitution, that's the supreme law of the land. It doesn't matter.

34:49.000 --> 35:02.000
 So the United States has what's called a rule based international order. That's acceptable, because it's the United States that sets the rules.

35:02.000 --> 35:21.000
 So we want a rule based international order where the US sets the rules. In commentary in the United States, even in scholarship, almost 100% calling for a rule based international order.

35:21.000 --> 35:32.000
 Is that false? No, it's true. Is it propaganda? Of course it's propaganda, because of what's not said, and because of what's presupposed.

35:32.000 --> 35:51.000
 An answer to an earlier question. Well, China does not accept the rule based international order. So when the US imposes demands, Europe may not like them, but they follow them. China ignores them.

35:51.000 --> 36:09.000
 I'll take, for example, the US sanctions on Iran. The US has to punish Iran, because the United States pulled out of the, unilaterally pulled out of the Ukraine, the Iran nuclear agreements.

36:09.000 --> 36:30.000
 So in order to punish Iran for our wrecking the agreements in violation of Security Council orders, we impose very harsh sanctions. Europe strongly opposes the sanctions, condemn them harshly, but it adheres to them.

36:30.000 --> 36:47.000
 Because you don't disobey US orders. That's too dangerous. China ignores them. They're not keeping to the rule based international order. Well, that's unacceptable.

36:47.000 --> 37:06.000
 In fact, it's said pretty openly. You can hear the Secretary of State and others saying that China is challenging our global hegemony, as they are. They don't accept US global hegemony, especially in the waters of China.

37:06.000 --> 37:30.000
 So that's a China threat. They do a lot of rotten things, China. I mean, internally, there's all kind of repression, violence, and so on. But first of all, that's not a threat to us. And second, the US doesn't care about it, because it easily accepts and supports comparable crimes and atrocities internal to allies.

37:30.000 --> 37:42.000
 So yes, we should protest it, but without hypocrisy, we have no standing to protest it. We support comparable things in all sorts of other places.

37:42.000 --> 38:05.000
 And just take a look at the US foreign aid. The leading recipient is US foreign aid is Israel, which is engaged in constant terror, violence, and repression, constant almost daily. Second leading recipient is Egypt, under the worst dictatorship in Egypt's history.

38:05.000 --> 38:22.000
 Not 60,000 people in jail, political prisoners, tortured, and so on. Do we care? No. Second leading recipient. I mean, what are we talking about? That's why most of the world just laughs at us.

38:22.000 --> 38:40.000
 There's a lot of failure to understand here about why the global south doesn't join us in our proxy war against Russia, fighting Russia until it's severely weakened. They don't join us.

38:40.000 --> 38:58.000
 Here the question is, what's wrong with them? They look into their minds to figure out what's wrong. They have a different attitude. They say, yes, we oppose the invasion of Ukraine, terrible crime, but what are you talking about?

38:58.000 --> 39:17.000
 This is what you do to us all the time. You don't care about crimes like this. That's most of the global south. We can't comprehend that because we're so insulated that we are just obviously right and everyone who doesn't go along must be wrong.

39:17.000 --> 39:29.000
 Do you think the United States as a global leader, as an empire, may collapse in this century? Why and how will it happen and how can we avoid it?

39:29.000 --> 39:51.000
 The United States can certainly harm itself severely. That's what we're doing right now. Right now, the greatest threat to the United States is internal countries tearing itself apart.

39:51.000 --> 40:12.000
 I mean, I really don't have to run through it with you. Take a look at something as elementary as mortality. The United States is the only country outside of war. Life expectancy is declining. Mortality is increasing.

40:12.000 --> 40:28.000
 This doesn't happen anywhere. You take a look at health outcomes generally. They're among the worst among the developed societies and health spending is about twice as high as the developed societies.

40:28.000 --> 40:50.000
 You look at the charts. All of this starts around the late 1970s, early 80s. If you go back to that point, the United States was pretty much a normal developed country in terms of mortality, incarceration, health expenses, other measures.

40:50.000 --> 41:05.000
 Since then, the United States has fallen off the chart. It's gone way off the chart. Well, that's the neoliberal assault of the last 40 years. It's had a major effect on the United States.

41:05.000 --> 41:21.000
 It's left a lot of anger, resentment, violence. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is simply drifted off the spectrum. It's not a normal political party in any usual sense, not what it used to be.

41:21.000 --> 41:39.000
 Its main policy is to block anything in order to regain power. That's its policy. It's stated almost openly by McConnell, followed religiously by the entire Congress.

41:39.000 --> 42:00.000
 That's not the actual political party. Of course, democracy has declined. The violence has increased. The judgments, the decisions of the Supreme Court, the court is the most reactionary court in memory.

42:00.000 --> 42:17.000
 To go back to the 19th century, decision after decision is an effort to create a country of white supremacist Christian nationalists. I mean, scarcely hidden.

42:17.000 --> 42:36.000
 If you read the opinions of Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, and others. So yes, we can destroy ourselves within. And in fact, the ways we're doing it are almost astonishing.

42:36.000 --> 42:49.000
 So it's well known, for example, everybody knows that U.S. infrastructure, the bridges, subways, and so on, is in terrible shape. It needs a lot of repair.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.000
 The American Association of Engineers gives it a failing mark every year.

42:55.000 --> 43:08.000
 All right, finally, Congress did pass a limited infrastructure bill. They revealed bridges and so on. It has to be called a China Competition Act.

43:08.000 --> 43:19.000
 We can't rebuild their bridges because they're falling apart. We have to rebuild their bridges to beat China. It's pathological.

43:19.000 --> 43:34.000
 And that's what's happening inside the country. Take Thomas's decision in the recent case in which he invalidated a New York law.

43:34.000 --> 43:52.000
 This is last October, a couple of weeks ago, and validated a New York law going back to 1913 that required people to have some justification if they wanted to carry concealed weapons in public.

43:52.000 --> 44:08.000
 He threw that with a very interesting decision. He said, the United States, he said, is such a decaying, collapsing, hateful society that people just have to have guns.

44:08.000 --> 44:18.000
 I mean, how can you expect somebody to go to the grocery store without a gun in a country as disgusting and hideous as this one?

44:18.000 --> 44:25.000
 It's essentially what he said. Those weren't his words, but they were the import.

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
 What gives you hope about the United States, about the future of human civilization?

44:33.000 --> 44:51.000
 Human civilization will not survive unless the United States takes a leading position in dealing with and overcoming the very severe crises that we face.

44:51.000 --> 45:07.000
 The United States is the most powerful country, not only in the world, but in human history. There's nothing to compare with it. What the United States does has an overwhelming impact on what happens in the world.

45:07.000 --> 45:34.000
 When the United States pulls out alone, pulls out of the Paris Agreement on dealing with climate change and insists on maximizing the use of fossil fuels and dismantling the regulatory apparatus that provides some mitigation when the United States does that as it did under Trump.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
 It's a blow to the future of civilization.

45:38.000 --> 45:59.000
 When Republican states today, right now, say they're going to punish corporations that seek to take climate change into account in their investments, the U.S. is telling the world, we want to destroy all of us.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
 Again, not their words, but their import. That's what they mean.

46:04.000 --> 46:23.000
 So as long as we have a political organization dedicated to gaining power at any cost, maximizing profit, no matter what the consequences, no future for human civilization.

46:23.000 --> 46:35.000
 Noam, thank you for talking today. Thank you for talking once again. And thank you for fighting for the future of human civilization. Again, thank you.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
 Thank you.

46:37.000 --> 46:45.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Noam Chomsky. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

46:45.000 --> 46:59.000
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Voltaire. It is forbidden to kill. Therefore, all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.

46:59.000 --> 47:15.000
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
