00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
 The following is a conversation with Kamran Vafa, a theoretical physicist at Harvard specializing

00:05.440 --> 00:07.320
 in strength theory.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.680
 He is the winner of the 2017 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, which is the

00:12.680 --> 00:15.920
 most lucrative academic prize in the world.

00:15.920 --> 00:23.080
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Headspace, Jordan Harmergeshow, Squarespace, and Alform.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.120
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:26.120 --> 00:30.040
 As a side note, let me say that strength theory is a theory of quantum gravity that

00:30.040 --> 00:33.400
 unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.800
 It says that quarks, electrons, and all other particles are made up of much tinier strings

00:38.800 --> 00:40.440
 of vibrating energy.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.400
 They vibrate in 10 or more dimensions, depending on the flavor of the theory.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.760
 Different vibrating patterns result in different particles.

00:48.760 --> 00:54.840
 From its origins, for a long time, strength theory was seen as too good not to be true,

00:54.840 --> 00:58.840
 but has recently fallen out of favor in the physics community, partly because over the

00:58.840 --> 01:04.640
 past 40 years, it has not been able to make any novel predictions that could then be validated

01:04.640 --> 01:06.040
 through experiment.

01:06.040 --> 01:12.320
 Nevertheless, to this day, it remains one of our best candidates for a theory of everything,

01:12.320 --> 01:15.640
 or a theory that unifies the laws of physics.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.960
 Let me mention that a similar story happened with neural networks in the field of artificial

01:19.960 --> 01:25.200
 intelligence, where it fell out of favor after decades of promise and research, but found

01:25.200 --> 01:30.480
 success, again, in the past decade, as part of the deep learning revolution.

01:30.480 --> 01:35.560
 So I think it pays to keep an open mind, since we don't know which of the ideas in

01:35.560 --> 01:40.600
 physics may be brought back decades later and be found to solve the biggest mysteries

01:40.600 --> 01:42.680
 in theoretical physics.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.160
 Strength theory still has that promise.

01:46.160 --> 01:52.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here's my conversation with Kamran Vafa.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.440
 What is the difference between mathematics and physics?

01:55.440 --> 02:00.960
 Well, that's a difficult question, because in many ways, math and physics are unified

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
 in many ways.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.480
 So to distinguish them is not an easy task.

02:04.480 --> 02:10.000
 I would say that perhaps the goals of math and physics are different.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.680
 Math does not care to describe reality.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
 Physics does.

02:14.680 --> 02:19.760
 It's a major difference, but a lot of the thoughts, processes, and so on, which goes

02:19.760 --> 02:24.800
 to understanding the nature and reality are the same things that mathematicians do.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.920
 So in many ways, they are similar.

02:27.920 --> 02:35.720
 Mathematicians care about deductive reasoning, and physicists or physics in general, we care

02:35.720 --> 02:37.760
 less about that.

02:37.760 --> 02:43.080
 We care more about interconnection of ideas, about how ideas support each other, or if

02:43.080 --> 02:48.360
 there's a puzzle discord between ideas, that's more interesting for us.

02:48.360 --> 02:53.440
 And part of the reason is that we have learned in physics that the ideas are not sequential,

02:53.440 --> 02:56.800
 and if we think that there's one idea which is more important, and we start with there

02:56.800 --> 03:01.680
 and go to the next idea and next one and deduce things from that like mathematicians do, we

03:01.680 --> 03:06.280
 have learned that the third or fourth thing we deduce from that principle turns out later

03:06.280 --> 03:11.680
 on to be the actual principle, and from a different perspective, starting from there

03:11.680 --> 03:16.040
 leads to new ideas which the original one didn't lead to, and that's the beginning of

03:16.040 --> 03:18.240
 a new revolution in science.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.200
 So this kind of thing we have seen again and again in the history of science, we have learned

03:22.200 --> 03:27.720
 to not like deductive reasoning, because that gives us a bad starting point to think that

03:27.720 --> 03:32.360
 we actually have the original thought process should be viewed as the primary thought, and

03:32.360 --> 03:35.680
 all these are deductions, like the way mathematicians sometimes do.

03:35.680 --> 03:39.000
 So in physics, we have learned to be skeptical of that way of thinking.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.280
 We have to be a bit open to the possibility that what we thought is a deduction of a hypothesis

03:44.280 --> 03:49.000
 actually the reason that's true is the opposite, and so we reverse the order.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.680
 And so this switching back and forth between ideas makes us more fluid about deductive fashion.

03:56.680 --> 04:02.000
 Of course, it sometimes gives a wrong impression like physicists don't care about rigor, they

04:02.000 --> 04:07.320
 just say random things, they are willing to say things that are not backed by the logical

04:07.320 --> 04:09.360
 reasoning, that's not true at all.

04:09.360 --> 04:15.920
 So despite this fluidity in saying which one is the primary thought, we are very careful

04:15.920 --> 04:20.120
 about trying to understand what we have really understood in terms of relationship between

04:20.120 --> 04:21.280
 ideas.

04:21.280 --> 04:27.520
 So that's an important ingredient, and in fact, solid math, being behind physics is,

04:27.520 --> 04:32.280
 I think, one of the attractive features of a physical law.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.360
 So we look for beautiful math underpinning it.

04:35.360 --> 04:42.480
 Can we dig into that process of starting from one place and then ending up at the fourth

04:42.480 --> 04:47.080
 step and realizing all along that the place you started at was wrong?

04:47.080 --> 04:53.840
 So is that happened when there's a discrepancy between what the math says and what the physical

04:53.840 --> 04:54.840
 world shows?

04:54.840 --> 05:00.880
 Is that how you then can go back and do the revolutionary idea for a different starting

05:00.880 --> 05:01.880
 place altogether?

05:01.880 --> 05:06.760
 Perhaps I'll give an example to see how it goes, and in fact, the historical example

05:06.760 --> 05:10.360
 is Newton's work on classical mechanics.

05:10.360 --> 05:16.760
 So Newton formulated the laws of mechanics, you know, the force F equals to MA and his

05:16.760 --> 05:21.240
 other laws, and they look very simple, elegant, and so forth.

05:21.240 --> 05:28.400
 Later, when we studied more examples of mechanics and other similar things, physicists came up

05:28.400 --> 05:31.880
 with the idea that the notion of potential is interesting.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.920
 Potential was an abstract idea, which kind of came.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.320
 You could take its gradient and relate it to the force, so you don't really need a

05:38.320 --> 05:41.320
 tapiri, but it solved, helped some thoughts.

05:41.320 --> 05:48.080
 And then later, Euler and Lagrange reformulated Newtonian mechanics in a totally different

05:48.080 --> 05:50.400
 way in the following fashion.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.000
 They said, if you want to know where a particle at this point and at this time, how does it

05:55.000 --> 05:58.980
 get to this point at the later time, is the following.

05:58.980 --> 06:03.120
 You take all possible paths connecting this particle from going from the initial point

06:03.120 --> 06:08.760
 to the final point, and you compute the action on what is an action.

06:08.760 --> 06:15.120
 Action is the integral over time of the kinetic term of the particle minus its potential.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.720
 So you take this integral, and each path will give you some quantity, and the path it actually

06:20.720 --> 06:26.640
 takes, the physical path, is the one which minimizes this integral or this action.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.000
 Now this sounded like a backward step from Newton's.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.760
 Newton's formula seemed very simple.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.920
 F equals to MA, and you can write F is minus the gradient of the potential.

06:36.920 --> 06:41.920
 So why would anybody start formulating such a simple thing in terms of this complicated

06:41.920 --> 06:43.280
 looking principle?

06:43.280 --> 06:47.800
 You have to study the space of all paths and all things and find the minimum, and then

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
 you get the same equation.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.800
 So what's the point?

06:49.800 --> 06:56.120
 So Euler and Lagrange's formulation of Newton, which was kind of a recasting in this language,

06:56.120 --> 06:58.120
 is just a consequence of Newton's law.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.320
 F equals to MA gives you the same fact that this path is a minimal action.

07:02.320 --> 07:08.920
 Now what we learned later, last century, was that when we deal with quantum mechanics,

07:08.920 --> 07:13.280
 Newton's law is only an average correct.

07:13.280 --> 07:17.960
 And the particle going from one to the other doesn't take exactly one path.

07:17.960 --> 07:23.760
 It takes all the paths with the amplitude, which is proportional to the exponential of

07:23.760 --> 07:27.120
 the action times an imaginary number, I.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.760
 And so this fact turned out to be the reformulation of quantum mechanics.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.040
 We should start there as the basis of the new law, which is quantum mechanics.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.600
 And Newton is only an approximation on the average correct.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.000
 When we say amplitude, you mean probability?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
 Yes.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.200
 The amplitude means if you sum up all these paths with the exponential I times the action,

07:45.200 --> 07:50.160
 if you sum this up, you get the number, complex number, you square the norm of this complex

07:50.160 --> 07:52.880
 number gives you a probability to go from one to the other.

07:52.880 --> 07:59.960
 Is there ways in which mathematics can lead us astray when we use it as a tool to understand

07:59.960 --> 08:01.200
 the physical world?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.200
 Yes.

08:02.200 --> 08:08.360
 I would say that mathematics can lead us astray as much as all physical ideas can lead us astray.

08:08.360 --> 08:14.840
 So if you get stuck in something, then you can easily fool yourself that just like the

08:14.840 --> 08:17.720
 thought process, we have to free ourselves of that.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.080
 Sometimes math does that role, like say, oh, this is such a beautiful math, I definitely

08:21.080 --> 08:22.080
 want to use it somewhere.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.880
 And so you just get carried away and you just get maybe carried too far away.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.080
 So that is certainly true.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.700
 But I wouldn't say it's more dangerous than old physical ideas.

08:30.700 --> 08:36.440
 To me, new math ideas is as much potential to lead us astray as old physical ideas,

08:36.440 --> 08:38.840
 which could be long held principles of physics.

08:38.840 --> 08:44.080
 So I'm just saying that we should keep an open mind about the role the math plays, not

08:44.080 --> 08:49.000
 to be antagonistic towards it, and not to over, over welcoming it.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.160
 We should just be open to possibilities.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.760
 What about looking at a particular characteristics of both physical ideas and mathematical ideas,

08:55.760 --> 08:56.760
 which is beauty?

08:56.760 --> 08:59.080
 Do you think beauty leads us astray?

08:59.080 --> 09:05.560
 Meaning, and you offline showed me a really nice puzzle that illustrates this idea a little

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
 bit.

09:06.560 --> 09:12.840
 Now, maybe you can speak to that or another example where beauty makes it tempting for

09:12.840 --> 09:18.720
 us to assume that the law and the theory we found is actually one that perfectly describes

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
 reality.

09:19.720 --> 09:25.840
 I think that beauty does not lead us astray, because I feel that beauty is a requirement

09:25.840 --> 09:27.840
 for principles of physics.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.520
 So beauty is fundamental in the universe?

09:29.520 --> 09:32.760
 I think beauty is fundamental, at least that's the way many of us view it.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
 It's not emergent.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.760
 It's not emergent.

09:34.760 --> 09:40.840
 I think Hardy is the mathematician who said that there's no permanent place for ugly mathematics.

09:40.840 --> 09:47.920
 And so I think the same is true in physics, that if we find a principle which looks ugly,

09:47.920 --> 09:49.680
 we're not going to be, that's not the end stage.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.080
 So therefore, beauty is going to lead us somewhere.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.840
 Now, it doesn't mean beauty is enough.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.360
 It doesn't mean if you just have beauty, if I just look at something as beautiful, then

09:58.360 --> 09:59.360
 I'm fine.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.360
 No, that's not the case.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.600
 Beauty is certainly a criteria that every good physical theory should pass.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
 That's at least the view we have.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.360
 Why do we have this view?

10:08.360 --> 10:09.880
 That's a good question.

10:09.880 --> 10:15.400
 It is partly, you could say, based on experience of science over centuries.

10:15.400 --> 10:20.320
 Partly is a philosophical view of what reality is or should be.

10:20.320 --> 10:25.760
 And in principle, it could have been ugly and we might have had to deal with it, but

10:25.760 --> 10:31.000
 we have gotten maybe confident through examples after examples in the history of science to

10:31.000 --> 10:32.560
 look for beauty.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.920
 And our sense of beauty seems to incorporate a lot of things that are essential for us

10:35.920 --> 10:38.040
 to solve some difficult problems like symmetry.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.360
 We find symmetry beautiful and the breaking of symmetry beautiful.

10:41.360 --> 10:49.280
 Somehow symmetry is a fundamental part of how we conceive of beauty at all layers of

10:49.280 --> 10:52.640
 reality, which is interesting.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.120
 In both the visual space, the way we look at art, we look at each other as human beings,

10:57.120 --> 11:01.560
 the way we look at creatures in the biological space, the way we look at chemistry and then

11:01.560 --> 11:05.720
 to the physics world as the work you do is kind of interesting.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.000
 It makes you wonder like, which one is the chicken or the egg?

11:10.000 --> 11:15.360
 Is symmetry the chicken and our conception of beauty the egg or the other way around?

11:15.360 --> 11:22.280
 Or somehow the fact that the symmetry is part of reality, it somehow creates a brain that

11:22.280 --> 11:32.920
 then is able to perceive it or maybe it's so obvious, it's almost trivial, that symmetry

11:32.920 --> 11:38.080
 of course will be part of every kind of universe that's possible.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.440
 And then any kind of organism that's able to observe that universe is going to appreciate

11:42.440 --> 11:43.440
 symmetry.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.080
 Well, these are good questions.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.920
 We don't have a deep understanding of why we get attracted to symmetry.

11:49.920 --> 11:55.400
 Why do laws of nature seem to have symmetries underlying them?

11:55.400 --> 11:59.760
 And the reasoning or the examples of whether if there wasn't symmetry, we would have understood

11:59.760 --> 12:00.760
 it or not.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.280
 We could have said that, yeah, if there were things which didn't look that great, we could

12:04.280 --> 12:05.280
 understand them.

12:05.280 --> 12:10.880
 For example, we know that symmetries get broken and we have appreciated nature in the broken

12:10.880 --> 12:12.400
 symmetry phase as well.

12:12.400 --> 12:17.840
 The world we live in has many things which do not look symmetric, but even those have

12:17.840 --> 12:20.720
 underlying symmetry when you look at it more deeply.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.880
 So we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps by the appearance of symmetry all over the place

12:25.880 --> 12:27.200
 and we look for it.

12:27.200 --> 12:33.480
 And I think this is perhaps related to the sense of aesthetics that scientists have.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.840
 And we don't usually talk about it among scientists.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.960
 In fact, it's kind of a philosophical view of why do we look for simplicity or beauty

12:41.960 --> 12:43.600
 or so forth.

12:43.600 --> 12:49.420
 And I think in a sense, scientists are a lot like philosophers.

12:49.420 --> 12:53.840
 Sometimes I think especially modern science seems to shun philosophers and philosophical

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
 views.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.360
 And I think at their peril.

12:56.360 --> 13:01.720
 I think in my view, science owes a lot to philosophy.

13:01.720 --> 13:08.920
 And in my view, many scientists, in fact probably all good scientists are perhaps amateur philosophers.

13:08.920 --> 13:13.520
 They may not state that they are philosophers or they may not like to be labeled philosophers,

13:13.520 --> 13:18.960
 but in many ways what they do is like what is philosophical takes of things.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.720
 Looking for simplicity or symmetry is an example of that in my opinion or seeing patterns.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.840
 You see, for example, another example of the symmetry is like how you come up with no ideas

13:28.840 --> 13:29.840
 in science.

13:29.840 --> 13:35.600
 You see, for example, an idea A is connected with an idea B. Okay, so you study this connection

13:35.600 --> 13:36.920
 very deeply.

13:36.920 --> 13:41.240
 And then you find the cousin of an idea A, let me call it A prime.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.200
 And then you immediately look for B prime.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.640
 If A is like B and if there's an A prime, then you look for B prime.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.640
 Why?

13:48.640 --> 13:51.080
 Well, it completes the picture.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.400
 Why? Well, it's philosophically appealing to have more balance in terms of that.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.840
 And then you look for B prime and lo and behold, you find this other phenomenon, which is a

13:58.840 --> 14:01.280
 physical phenomenon, which you call B prime.

14:01.280 --> 14:05.560
 So this kind of thinking motivates asking questions and looking for things.

14:05.560 --> 14:09.800
 And it has guided scientists, I think, through many centuries and I think it continues to

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
 do so today.

14:10.800 --> 14:15.000
 And I think if you look at the long arc of history, I suspect that the things that will

14:15.000 --> 14:22.840
 be remembered is the philosophical flavor of the ideas of physics and chemistry and computer

14:22.840 --> 14:24.680
 science and mathematics.

14:24.680 --> 14:34.280
 Like I think the actual details will be shown to be incomplete or maybe wrong, but the philosophical

14:34.280 --> 14:36.960
 intuitions will carry through much longer.

14:36.960 --> 14:42.080
 There's a sense in which if it's true that we haven't figured out most of how things

14:42.080 --> 14:50.120
 work currently, that it'll all be shown as wrong and silly, almost be a historical artifact.

14:50.120 --> 14:57.120
 But the human spirit, whatever, like the longing to understand the way we perceive the world,

14:57.120 --> 15:02.480
 the way we conceive of it, of our place in the world, those ideas will carry on.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.480
 I completely agree.

15:03.480 --> 15:09.120
 In fact, I believe that almost, well, I believe that none of the principles or laws of physics

15:09.120 --> 15:11.680
 we know today are exactly correct.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.600
 All of them are approximations to something.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.640
 They're better than the previous versions of what we had, but none of them are exactly

15:17.640 --> 15:20.040
 correct and none of them are going to stand forever.

15:20.040 --> 15:24.440
 So I agree that that's the process we are heading, we are improving.

15:24.440 --> 15:28.840
 And yes, indeed, the thought process and that philosophical take is common.

15:28.840 --> 15:35.960
 So when we look at older scientists or maybe even all the way back to Greek philosophers

15:35.960 --> 15:40.760
 and the things that the way they thought and so on, almost everything they said about nature

15:40.760 --> 15:42.360
 was incorrect.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.720
 But the way they thought about it and many things that they were thinking is still valid

15:46.720 --> 15:47.720
 today.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.120
 For example, they thought about symmetry breaking.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.000
 They were trying to explain the following.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.680
 This is a beautiful example, I think.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.960
 They had figured out that the Earth is round and they said, okay, Earth is round.

15:57.960 --> 16:02.240
 They have seen the length of the shadow of a meter stick and they have seen that if you

16:02.240 --> 16:06.680
 go from the equator upwards north, they find that depending on how far away you are, the

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
 length of the shadow changes.

16:07.680 --> 16:12.400
 And from that, they had even measured the radius of the Earth to good accuracy.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.720
 That's brilliant, by the way, the fact that they did that.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.720
 Very brilliant.

16:15.720 --> 16:20.680
 So these Greek philosophers were very smart and so they had taken it to the next step.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.200
 They asked, okay, so the Earth is round.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
 Why doesn't it move?

16:25.200 --> 16:26.360
 They thought it doesn't move.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.360
 They were looking around, nothing seemed to move.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.520
 So they said, okay, we have to have a good explanation.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.360
 It wasn't enough for them to be there.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.200
 So they really want to deeply understand that fact.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.760
 They come up with a symmetry argument.

16:38.760 --> 16:44.320
 And the symmetry argument was, oh, if the Earth is a spherical, it must be at the center

16:44.320 --> 16:45.600
 of the universe, for sure.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.200
 So they said the Earth is at the center of the universe.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.320
 And they said, you know, if the Earth is going to move, which direction does it pick?

16:52.320 --> 16:57.240
 Any direction it picks, it breaks that spherical symmetry because you have to pick a direction.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.360
 And that's not good because it's not symmetrical anymore.

16:59.360 --> 17:04.560
 So therefore, the Earth decides to sit put because it would break the symmetry.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.000
 So they had the incorrect science, they thought Earth doesn't move.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.480
 And they, but they had this beautiful idea that symmetry might explain it, but they were

17:11.480 --> 17:12.600
 even smarter than that.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.000
 Aristotle didn't agree with this argument.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.080
 He said, why do you think symmetry prevents it from moving because it's a preferred position?

17:20.080 --> 17:21.400
 Not so.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
 He gave an example.

17:22.400 --> 17:30.280
 He said, suppose you are a person and we put you at the center of a circle and we spread

17:30.280 --> 17:36.800
 food around you on a circle around you, loaves of bread, let's say, and we say, okay, stay

17:36.800 --> 17:39.120
 at the center of the circle forever.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.400
 Are you going to do that just because it's a symmetric point?

17:42.400 --> 17:47.080
 No, you are going to get hungry, you're going to move towards one of those loaves of bread,

17:47.080 --> 17:49.560
 despite the fact that it breaks the symmetry.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.800
 So from this way, he tried to argue being at the symmetric point may not be the preferred

17:53.800 --> 17:55.480
 thing to do.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.280
 And this idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking is something we just use today to describe

18:00.280 --> 18:01.640
 many physical phenomena.

18:01.640 --> 18:07.440
 So spontaneous symmetry breaking is the feature that we now use, but this idea was there thousands

18:07.440 --> 18:12.080
 of years ago, but applied incorrectly to the physical world, but now we are using it.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.860
 So these ideas are coming back in different forms.

18:14.860 --> 18:19.400
 So I agree very much that the thought process is more important and these ideas are more

18:19.400 --> 18:23.000
 interesting than the actual applications that people may find today.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.600
 Did they use the language of symmetry and the symmetry breaking and spontaneous symmetry

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
 break?

18:27.600 --> 18:32.800
 That's really interesting because I could see a conception of the universe that kind

18:32.800 --> 18:40.040
 of tends towards perfect symmetry and is stuck there, not stuck there, but achieves that

18:40.040 --> 18:42.160
 optimal and stays there.

18:42.160 --> 18:48.520
 The idea that you would spontaneously break out of symmetry, like have these perturbations,

18:48.520 --> 18:56.280
 jump out of symmetry and back, that's a really difficult idea to load into your head.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.280
 Where does that come from?

18:57.280 --> 19:03.600
 And then the idea that you may not be at the center of the universe, that is a really

19:03.600 --> 19:05.240
 tough idea.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.680
 So symmetry sometimes an explanation of being at the symmetric point is sometimes a simple

19:09.680 --> 19:16.520
 explanation of many things like if you have a ball, a circular ball, then the bottom of

19:16.520 --> 19:20.920
 it is the lowest point, so if you put a pebble or something, it will slide down and go there

19:20.920 --> 19:25.200
 at the bottom and stays there at the symmetric point because the preferred point, the lowest

19:25.200 --> 19:26.520
 energy point.

19:26.520 --> 19:33.080
 But if that same symmetric circular ball that you had had a bump on the bottom, the bottom

19:33.080 --> 19:37.920
 might not be at the center, it might be on a circle on the table, in which case the pebble

19:37.920 --> 19:42.520
 would not end up at the center, will be the lower energy point, symmetrical, but it breaks

19:42.520 --> 19:45.880
 a symmetry once it picks a point on that circle.

19:45.880 --> 19:50.800
 So we can have symmetry reasoning for where things end up or symmetry breakings, like

19:50.800 --> 19:52.840
 this example would suggest.

19:52.840 --> 19:58.240
 We talked about beauty, I find geometry to be beautiful.

19:58.240 --> 20:04.600
 You have a few examples that are geometric in nature in your book.

20:04.600 --> 20:09.680
 How can geometry in ancient times or today be used to understand reality?

20:09.680 --> 20:17.280
 And maybe how do you think about geometry as a distinct tool in mathematics and physics?

20:17.280 --> 20:22.560
 Yes, geometry is my favorite part of math as well, and Greeks were enamored by geometry.

20:22.560 --> 20:28.400
 They tried to describe physical reality using geometry and principles of geometry and symmetry.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.280
 Platonic solids, the five solids they had discovered had these beautiful solids.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.640
 They thought it must be good for some reality.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.040
 There must be explaining something.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.760
 They attached one to air, one to fire, and so forth.

20:40.760 --> 20:45.520
 They tried to give physical reality to symmetric objects.

20:45.520 --> 20:50.240
 These symmetric objects are symmetries of rotation and discrete symmetry groups we call

20:50.240 --> 20:53.480
 today of rotation group in three dimensions.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.800
 Now we know, now we kind of laugh at the way they were trying to connect that symmetry

20:57.800 --> 21:07.000
 to the realities of physics, but actually it turns out in modern days we use symmetry

21:07.000 --> 21:13.720
 in not too far away, exactly in these kind of thought processes in the following way.

21:13.720 --> 21:19.400
 In the context of string theory, which is the field light study, we have these extra

21:19.400 --> 21:24.400
 dimensions, and these extra dimensions are compact tiny spaces typically, but they have

21:24.400 --> 21:27.320
 different shapes and sizes.

21:27.320 --> 21:32.360
 We have learned that if these extra shapes and sizes have symmetries which are related

21:32.360 --> 21:36.960
 to the same rotation symmetries that the Greek were talking about, if they enjoy those

21:36.960 --> 21:41.840
 discrete symmetries, and if you take that symmetry and caution the space by that, in

21:41.840 --> 21:47.800
 other words, identify points under these symmetries, you get properties of that space at the singular

21:47.800 --> 21:51.520
 points which force emanates from them.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.640
 What forces?

21:52.640 --> 21:57.720
 Forces like the ones we have seen in nature today, like electric forces, like strong forces,

21:57.720 --> 21:59.400
 like weak forces.

21:59.400 --> 22:06.560
 These same principles that were driving them to connect geometry and symmetries to nature

22:06.560 --> 22:14.800
 is driving today's physics, now much more modern ideas, but nevertheless the symmetries

22:14.800 --> 22:17.080
 connecting geometry to physics.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.960
 In fact, often sometimes we ask the following question.

22:20.960 --> 22:26.240
 Suppose I want to get this particular physical reality, I want to have these particles with

22:26.240 --> 22:28.880
 these forces and so on, what do I do?

22:28.880 --> 22:33.240
 It turns out that you can geometrically design the space to give you that.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.760
 You say, oh, I put the sphere here, I will do this, I will shrink them.

22:36.760 --> 22:42.240
 So if you have two spheres touching each other and shrinking to zero size, that gives you

22:42.240 --> 22:43.960
 strong forces.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.760
 If you have one of them, it gives you the weak forces.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.160
 If you have this, you get that, and if you want to unify forces, do the other thing.

22:49.160 --> 22:54.280
 So these geometrical translation of physics is one of my favorite things that we have

22:54.280 --> 22:57.640
 discovered in modern physics in the context of strength theory.

22:57.640 --> 23:02.800
 The sad thing is when you go into multiple dimensions and we'll talk about it is we start

23:02.800 --> 23:10.320
 to lose our capacity to visually intuit the world we're discussing, and then we go into

23:10.320 --> 23:12.840
 the realm of mathematics, and we'll lose that.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.880
 Unfortunately, our brains are such that we're limited.

23:15.880 --> 23:21.560
 But before we go into that mysterious, beautiful world, let's take a small step back.

23:21.560 --> 23:26.760
 You also in your book have this kind of through the space of puzzles, through the space of

23:26.760 --> 23:32.120
 ideas have a brief history of physics, of physical ideas.

23:32.120 --> 23:38.280
 Now we talked about Newtonian mechanics, leading all through different Lagrangian, Hamiltonian

23:38.280 --> 23:39.280
 mechanics.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.840
 Can you describe some of the key ideas in the history of physics, maybe lingering on

23:43.840 --> 23:50.080
 each from electromagnetism to relativity to quantum mechanics and to today, as we'll talk

23:50.080 --> 23:53.200
 about with quantum gravity and strength theory?

23:53.200 --> 23:59.640
 So I mentioned the classical mechanics and the Euler Lagrangian formulation.

23:59.640 --> 24:05.800
 One of the next important milestones for physics were the discoveries of laws of electricity

24:05.800 --> 24:07.400
 and magnetism.

24:07.400 --> 24:12.720
 So Maxwell put the discoveries all together in the context of what we call the Maxwell's

24:12.720 --> 24:13.960
 equations.

24:13.960 --> 24:20.480
 And he noticed that when he put these discoveries that Faraday's and others had made about electric

24:20.480 --> 24:24.800
 and magnetic phenomena in terms of mathematical equations, it didn't quite work.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.880
 There was a mathematical inconsistency.

24:27.880 --> 24:32.720
 Now, you know, one could have two attitudes, one say, okay, who cares about math?

24:32.720 --> 24:36.960
 I'm doing nature, you know, electric force, magnetic force, math, I don't care about.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.960
 But it bothered him.

24:37.960 --> 24:38.960
 It was inconsistent.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.360
 The equations he were writing, the two equations he had written down did not agree with each

24:42.360 --> 24:43.360
 other.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.360
 And this bothered him.

24:44.360 --> 24:48.120
 But he figured out, you know, if you add this jiggle, this equation by adding one little

24:48.120 --> 24:50.160
 term there, it works.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.680
 At least it's consistent.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.080
 What is the motivation for that term?

24:53.080 --> 24:54.640
 He said, I don't know.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.280
 Have we seen it in experiments?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.280
 No.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.280
 Why did you add it?

24:58.280 --> 24:59.920
 Well, because of mathematical consistency.

24:59.920 --> 25:04.600
 So he said, okay, math forced him to do this term.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.560
 He added this term, which we now today call the Maxwell term.

25:08.560 --> 25:12.960
 And once he added that term, his equations were nice, you know, differential equations,

25:12.960 --> 25:14.560
 mathematically consistent, beautiful.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.200
 But he also found a new physical phenomena.

25:17.200 --> 25:24.760
 He found that because of that term, he could now get electric and magnetic waves moving

25:24.760 --> 25:27.400
 through space at a speed that he could calculate.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.720
 So he calculated the speed of the wave.

25:29.720 --> 25:33.680
 And lo and behold, he found it's the same as the speed of light, which puzzled him because

25:33.680 --> 25:37.920
 he didn't think light had anything to do with electricity and magnetism.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.840
 But then he was courageous enough to say, well, maybe light is nothing but these electric

25:41.840 --> 25:44.880
 and magnetic fields moving around.

25:44.880 --> 25:50.520
 And he wasn't alive to see the verification of that prediction, and indeed it was true.

25:50.520 --> 25:56.480
 So this mathematical inconsistency, which we could say, you know, this mathematical beauty

25:56.480 --> 26:04.000
 drove him to this physical, very important connection between light and electric and

26:04.000 --> 26:07.720
 magnetic phenomena, which was later confirmed.

26:07.720 --> 26:11.160
 So then physics progresses, and it comes to Einstein.

26:11.160 --> 26:16.200
 Einstein looks at Maxwell's equation, says, beautiful, these are nice equations, except

26:16.200 --> 26:18.200
 we get one speed light.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.760
 Who measures this light speed?

26:20.760 --> 26:23.560
 And he asks the question, are you moving?

26:23.560 --> 26:24.560
 Are you not moving?

26:24.560 --> 26:28.640
 If you move, the speed of light changes, but Maxwell's equation has no hint of different

26:28.640 --> 26:29.640
 speeds of light.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.560
 It doesn't say, oh, only if you're not moving, you get the speed.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.720
 It's just you always get the speed.

26:33.720 --> 26:38.920
 So Einstein was very puzzled, and he was daring enough to say, well, you know, maybe everybody

26:38.920 --> 26:41.120
 gets the same speed for light.

26:41.120 --> 26:44.600
 And that motivated his theory of special relativity.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.480
 And this is an interesting example, because the idea was motivated from physics, from

26:48.480 --> 26:56.840
 Maxwell's equations, from the fact that people tried to measure the properties of ether,

26:56.840 --> 27:01.040
 which was supposed to be the medium in which the light travels through.

27:01.040 --> 27:06.200
 And the idea was that only in that medium, the speed of light, if you're at rest with

27:06.200 --> 27:10.640
 respect to the ether, the speed of light, and if you're moving, the speed changes,

27:10.640 --> 27:11.960
 and people did not discover it.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.240
 So Michael Sonan Morley's experiment showed there is no ether.

27:15.240 --> 27:20.080
 So then Einstein was courageous enough to say, you know, light is the same speed for everybody

27:20.080 --> 27:22.800
 regardless of whether you're moving or not.

27:22.800 --> 27:28.720
 And the interesting thing is about special theory of relativity is that the math underpinning

27:28.720 --> 27:31.440
 it is very simple.

27:31.440 --> 27:35.760
 It's a linear algebra, nothing terribly deep.

27:35.760 --> 27:39.200
 You can teach it at a high school level, if not earlier.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.200
 Okay.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.560
 So does that mean Einstein's special relativity is boring?

27:43.560 --> 27:44.720
 Not at all.

27:44.720 --> 27:51.360
 So this is an example where simple math, you know, linear algebra leads to deep physics.

27:51.360 --> 27:56.640
 Einstein's theory of special relativity, motivated by this inconsistency at Maxwell's equation

27:56.640 --> 27:59.400
 would suggest for the speed of light depending on who observes it.

27:59.400 --> 28:04.120
 What's the most daring idea there, that the speed of light could be the same everywhere?

28:04.120 --> 28:05.880
 That's the basic, that's the guts of it.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.280
 That's the core of Einstein's theory.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.760
 That statement underlies the whole thing.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.400
 Speed of light is the same for everybody, it's hard to swallow and doesn't sound right.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.600
 It sounds completely wrong on the face of it.

28:16.600 --> 28:20.360
 And it took Einstein to make this daring statement.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.640
 It would be laughing in some sense.

28:22.640 --> 28:27.880
 How could anybody make this possibly ridiculous claim and it turned out to be true?

28:27.880 --> 28:28.880
 How does that make you feel?

28:28.880 --> 28:31.600
 Because it still sounds ridiculous.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.800
 It sounds ridiculous until you learn that our intuition is at fault about the way we

28:35.800 --> 28:37.640
 conceive of space and time.

28:37.640 --> 28:41.640
 The way we think about space and time is wrong, because we think about the nature of time

28:41.640 --> 28:43.640
 as absolute.

28:43.640 --> 28:49.520
 And part of it is because we live in a situation where we don't go with very high speeds.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.160
 There are speeds that are small compared to the speed of light.

28:52.160 --> 28:57.520
 And therefore the phenomena we observe does not distinguish the relativity of time.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.320
 The time also depends on who measures it.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
 There's no absolute time.

29:00.320 --> 29:05.800
 When you say it's noon today, now, it depends on who's measuring it and not everybody would

29:05.800 --> 29:11.520
 agree with that statement and to see that, you would have to have fast observer moving

29:11.520 --> 29:13.440
 speeds close to the speed of light.

29:13.440 --> 29:16.040
 So this shows that our intuition is at fault.

29:16.040 --> 29:23.880
 And a lot of the discoveries in physics precisely is getting rid of the wrong old intuition.

29:23.880 --> 29:28.920
 And it is funny because we get rid of it, but it's always lingers in us in some form.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.800
 Even when I'm describing it, I feel like a little bit funny as you're just feeling the

29:33.800 --> 29:34.800
 same way.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
 It is.

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
 It is.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.720
 But we kind of replace it by an intuition.

29:40.720 --> 29:45.400
 And actually there's a very beautiful example of this, how physicists do this, try to replace

29:45.400 --> 29:46.400
 their intuition.

29:46.400 --> 29:52.200
 And I think this is one of my favorite examples about how physicists develop intuition.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.120
 It goes to the work of Galileo.

29:55.120 --> 30:00.560
 So again, let's go back to Greek philosophers or maybe Aristotle in this case.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.640
 Now again, let's make a criticism.

30:02.640 --> 30:07.120
 He thought that objects, the heavier objects fall faster than the lighter objects.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
 Makes sense.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.120
 It kind of makes sense.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.760
 And you know, people say about feather and so on, but that's because of the air resistance.

30:12.760 --> 30:17.760
 But you might think like if you have a heavy stone and a light pebble, the heavy one will

30:17.760 --> 30:18.760
 fall first.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.440
 If you don't, you know, do any experiments, that's the first gut reaction.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.920
 I would say everybody would say that's the natural thing.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.720
 Galileo did not believe this.

30:25.720 --> 30:30.360
 And he kind of did the experiment.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.840
 Obviously it said he went on the top of Pisa Tower and he dropped, you know, these heavy

30:33.840 --> 30:38.320
 and light stones and they fell at the same time when he dropped it at the same time from

30:38.320 --> 30:39.320
 the same height.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.320
 Okay, good.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.320
 So he said, I'm done.

30:41.320 --> 30:44.440
 You know, I've showed that the heavy and lighter objects fall at the same time.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.560
 I did the experiment.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.600
 Scientists at that time did not accept it.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.080
 Why was that?

30:51.080 --> 30:54.360
 Because at that time science was not just experimental.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.840
 The experiment was not enough.

30:56.840 --> 31:01.960
 They didn't think that they have to sort their hands in doing experiments to get to the reality.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.080
 They said, why is it the case?

31:04.080 --> 31:08.400
 So Galileo had to come up with an explanation of why heavier and lighter objects fall at

31:08.400 --> 31:09.680
 the same rate.

31:09.680 --> 31:13.360
 This is the way he convinced them using symmetry.

31:13.360 --> 31:21.520
 He said, suppose you have three bricks, the same shape, the same size, same mass, everything.

31:21.520 --> 31:27.400
 And we hold these three bricks at the same height and drop them.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.560
 Which one will fall to the ground first?

31:30.560 --> 31:33.480
 Everybody said, of course, we know that symmetry tells you, you know, they're all the same

31:33.480 --> 31:35.520
 shapes, same size, same height.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.920
 Of course they fall at the same time.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.560
 Yeah, we know that next, next, this trivia.

31:39.560 --> 31:43.000
 He said, okay, what if we move these bricks around with the same height?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.440
 Does it change the time they hit the ground?

31:45.440 --> 31:48.560
 They said, if it's the same height again by the symmetry principle because the height

31:48.560 --> 31:52.320
 translation, horizontal translation is a symmetry, no, it doesn't matter.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.560
 They all fall at the same rate.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
 Good.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.000
 Does it matter how close I bring them together?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
 No, it doesn't.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
 Okay.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.840
 Suppose I make the two bricks touch and then let them go.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.200
 Do they fall at the same rate?

32:01.200 --> 32:02.200
 Yes, they do.

32:02.200 --> 32:06.640
 But then he said, well, the two bricks that touch are twice more mass than this other

32:06.640 --> 32:07.640
 brick.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.240
 And you just agreed that they fall at the same rate.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.960
 They say, yeah, yeah, we just agreed.

32:10.960 --> 32:11.960
 That's right.

32:11.960 --> 32:12.960
 That's great.

32:12.960 --> 32:13.960
 Yes.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.560
 So he deconfused them by the symmetry reasoning.

32:15.560 --> 32:20.720
 So this way of repackaging some intuition, a different intuition, when the intuitions

32:20.720 --> 32:25.200
 clash, then you, then you slide on the, you replace the intuition.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.200
 That's brilliant.

32:26.200 --> 32:33.080
 I, in some of these diff, more difficult physical ideas, physics ideas in the 20th century

32:33.080 --> 32:38.120
 and the 21st century, it starts becoming more and more difficult to then replace the intuition.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.680
 You know, what, what does the world look like for an object traveling close to the speed

32:41.680 --> 32:43.180
 of light?

32:43.180 --> 32:47.960
 You start to think about like the edges of supermassive black holes and you start to

32:47.960 --> 32:51.160
 think like, what, what's that look like?

32:51.160 --> 32:55.880
 Or a, I've been read into gravitational ways or something.

32:55.880 --> 33:02.080
 It's like when the fabric of space time is being morphed by gravity, like what's that

33:02.080 --> 33:03.560
 actually feel like?

33:03.560 --> 33:09.120
 If I'm riding a gravitational wave, what's that feel like?

33:09.120 --> 33:16.040
 I mean, I think some of those are more sort of hippie, not useful intuitions to have.

33:16.040 --> 33:21.280
 But if you're an actual physicist or whatever the particular discipline is, I wonder if

33:21.280 --> 33:29.520
 it's possible to meditate, to sort of escape through thinking, prolonged thinking and meditation

33:29.520 --> 33:35.840
 on a war on a world like live in a visualized world that's not like our own in order to

33:35.840 --> 33:38.240
 understand a phenomenon deeply.

33:38.240 --> 33:45.600
 Or like replace the intuition, like through rigorous meditation on the idea in order to

33:45.600 --> 33:46.600
 conceive of it.

33:46.600 --> 33:51.960
 I mean, if we talk about multiple dimensions, I wonder if there's a way to escape with a

33:51.960 --> 33:56.440
 three dimensional world in our mind in order to then start to reason about it.

33:56.440 --> 34:04.800
 It's, the more I talk to topologists, the more they seem to not operate at all in the visual

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
 space.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.920
 They really trust the mathematics.

34:07.920 --> 34:14.840
 Like which is really annoying to me because topology and differential geometry feels like

34:14.840 --> 34:17.200
 it has a lot of potential for beautiful pictures.

34:17.200 --> 34:18.200
 Yes.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.200
 I think they do.

34:19.200 --> 34:26.480
 Actually, I would not be able to do my research if I don't have an intuitive feel about geometry.

34:26.480 --> 34:32.200
 And we'll get to it as you mentioned before, that's how, for example, in string theory,

34:32.200 --> 34:35.640
 you deal with these extra dimensions and I'll be very happy to describe how we do it because

34:35.640 --> 34:40.440
 with that intuition, we will not get anywhere and I don't think you can just rely on formalism.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.440
 I don't.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.320
 I don't think any physicist just relies on formalism.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.320
 That's not physics.

34:45.320 --> 34:46.800
 That's not understanding.

34:46.800 --> 34:51.240
 So we have to intuit it and that's crucial and there are steps of doing it and we learned

34:51.240 --> 34:54.320
 it might not be trivial, but we learn how to do it.

34:54.320 --> 34:59.560
 Similar to what this Galileo picture I just told you, you have to build these gradually.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.640
 But you have to connect the bricks.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.640
 Yeah, exactly.

35:02.640 --> 35:07.680
 You have to connect the bricks, literally, so yeah, so then, so going back to your question

35:07.680 --> 35:12.280
 about the path of the history of the science, so I was saying about the electrician magnetism

35:12.280 --> 35:17.360
 and the special relativity where simple idea led to special relativity, but then he went

35:17.360 --> 35:22.360
 further thinking about acceleration in the context of relativity and he came up with

35:22.360 --> 35:26.120
 general relativity, where he talked about, you know, the fabric of space, time being

35:26.120 --> 35:32.120
 curved and so forth and matter affecting the curvature of the space and time.

35:32.120 --> 35:40.680
 So this gradually became a connection between geometry and physics, namely he replaced Newton's,

35:40.680 --> 35:46.080
 you know, gravitational force with a very geometrical beautiful picture.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.680
 It's much more elegant than Newton's, but much more complicated mathematically.

35:50.680 --> 35:56.800
 So when we say simpler, we mean in some form it's simpler, but not in pragmatic terms of

35:56.800 --> 35:57.800
 equation solving.

35:57.800 --> 36:01.440
 The equations are much harder to solve in Einstein's theory.

36:01.440 --> 36:05.360
 And in fact, so much, so much harder that Einstein himself couldn't solve many of his,

36:05.360 --> 36:08.880
 many of the cases he thought, for example, he couldn't solve the equation for a spherical

36:08.880 --> 36:13.920
 symmetric matter, like, like if you had a symmetric sun, he didn't think you can actually

36:13.920 --> 36:15.760
 write the solve his equation for that.

36:15.760 --> 36:19.400
 And a year after he said that it was solved by, by Schwarzschild.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.960
 So it was, it was that hard that he didn't think it's going to be that easy.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.120
 So yeah, the formism is hard.

36:25.120 --> 36:28.960
 But the contrast between the special relativity and general relativity is very interesting

36:28.960 --> 36:34.800
 because one of them has almost trivial math and the other one has super complicated math.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.720
 Both are physically amazingly important.

36:37.720 --> 36:43.920
 And so, so we have learned that, you know, the physics may or may not require complicated

36:43.920 --> 36:45.000
 math.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.680
 We should not shy from using complicated math like Einstein did.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.120
 Nobody, Einstein wouldn't say, I'm not going to touch this math because it's too much,

36:52.120 --> 36:56.160
 you know, tensors or, you know, curvature and I don't like the four dimensional space

36:56.160 --> 36:59.160
 time because I can't see four dimension, he wasn't doing that.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.760
 He was willing to abstract from that because physics drove him in that direction.

37:03.760 --> 37:09.880
 But his motivation was physics, physics pushed him just like Newton pushed to develop calculus

37:09.880 --> 37:12.560
 because physics pushed him that he didn't have the tools.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.080
 So he had to develop the tools to answer his physics questions.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.840
 So his motivation was physics again.

37:18.840 --> 37:24.520
 So to me, those are examples would show that math and physics have this symbiotic relationship

37:24.520 --> 37:27.120
 which kind of reinforced each other.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.920
 Here I'm using, I'm giving you examples of both of them, namely Newton's work led to

37:31.920 --> 37:34.680
 development of mathematics, calculus.

37:34.680 --> 37:38.840
 And in the case of Einstein, he didn't develop the Riemannian geometry, just use them.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.600
 So, so it goes both ways.

37:40.600 --> 37:44.360
 And in the context of modern physics, we see that again and again, it goes both ways.

37:44.360 --> 37:48.800
 Let me ask a ridiculous question, you know, you talk about your favorite soccer player

37:48.800 --> 37:49.800
 to bar.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.640
 I'll ask the same question about Einstein's ideas, which is, which one do you think is

37:54.640 --> 37:56.600
 the biggest leap of genius?

37:56.600 --> 37:59.960
 Is it the E equals MC squared?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.680
 Is it Brownian motion?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.120
 Is it special relativity?

38:03.120 --> 38:05.600
 Is it general relativity?

38:05.600 --> 38:12.160
 Which of the famous set of papers he's written in 1905 and in general, his work was the biggest

38:12.160 --> 38:13.760
 leap of genius.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.280
 In my opinion is special relativity.

38:16.280 --> 38:20.160
 The idea that speed of light is the same for everybody is the beginning of everything

38:20.160 --> 38:21.160
 he did.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.160
 The beginning is the beginning.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.160
 It's the beginning.

38:23.160 --> 38:27.280
 Once you embrace that weirdness, all the weirdness, I would say that's, that's, even

38:27.280 --> 38:31.120
 though he says the most beautiful moment for him, he says that is when he realized that

38:31.120 --> 38:35.560
 if you fall in an elevator, you don't know if you're falling or whether you're in the

38:35.560 --> 38:39.600
 falling elevator or whether you're next to the earth gravitational.

38:39.600 --> 38:45.000
 That to him was his aha moment, which inertial mass and gravitational mass being identical

38:45.000 --> 38:52.480
 geometrically and so forth as part of the theory, not because of some funny coincidence.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.480
 That's for him.

38:53.480 --> 38:57.480
 But I feel from outside, at least, it feels like the speed of light being the same is

38:57.480 --> 38:59.240
 the really aha moment.

38:59.240 --> 39:05.040
 The general relativity to you is not like a conception of space time.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.680
 In a sense, the conception of space time already was part of the special relativity when we

39:08.680 --> 39:11.000
 talked about length contraction.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.440
 So general relativity takes that to the next step, but beginning of it was already space

39:15.440 --> 39:17.640
 length contracts, time dilates.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.680
 So once you talk about those, then yeah, you can dilate more or less different places

39:20.680 --> 39:22.040
 than it's curvature.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.040
 So you don't have a choice.

39:23.040 --> 39:26.720
 So it's kind of started just with that same simple thought.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.960
 Speed of light is the same for all.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.200
 Where does quantum mechanics come into view?

39:32.200 --> 39:33.200
 Exactly.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.200
 So this is the next step.

39:34.200 --> 39:38.440
 So Einstein's developed general relativity and he's beginning to develop the foundation

39:38.440 --> 39:39.960
 of quantum mechanics at the same time.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.480
 The photoelectric effects on others.

39:42.480 --> 39:47.200
 And so quantum mechanics overtakes, in fact, Einstein in many ways, because he doesn't

39:47.200 --> 39:52.480
 like the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics and the formulas that's emerging.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.360
 What fits his march on?

39:54.360 --> 40:01.160
 And try to, for example, combine Einstein's theory of relativity with quantum mechanics.

40:01.160 --> 40:07.880
 So Dirac takes special relativity, tries to see how is it compatible with quantum mechanics.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.440
 Can we pause and briefly say what is quantum mechanics?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
 Oh yes, sure.

40:11.440 --> 40:16.720
 So quantum mechanics, so I discussed briefly when I talked about the connection between

40:16.720 --> 40:22.400
 Newtonian mechanics and the Euler Lagrange formulation of the Newtonian mechanics and

40:22.400 --> 40:28.680
 interpretation of this Euler Lagrange formulas in terms of the paths that the particle take.

40:28.680 --> 40:34.440
 So when we say a particle goes from here to here, we usually think it, classically, follows

40:34.440 --> 40:41.240
 a specific trajectory, but actually in quantum mechanics, it follows every trajectory with

40:41.240 --> 40:43.080
 different probabilities.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.040
 And so there's this fuzziness.

40:45.040 --> 40:50.680
 Now most probable, it's the path that you actually see and the deviation from that is

40:50.680 --> 40:53.920
 very, very unlikely and probabilistically very minuscule.

40:53.920 --> 40:58.240
 So in everyday experiments, we don't see anything deviated from what we expect.

40:58.240 --> 41:01.720
 But quantum mechanics tells us that things are more fuzzy.

41:01.720 --> 41:06.040
 Things are not as precise as the line you draw.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.880
 Things are a bit like cloud.

41:07.880 --> 41:13.440
 So if you go to microscopic scales, like atomic scales, and though these phenomena become

41:13.440 --> 41:16.360
 more pronounced, you can see it much better.

41:16.360 --> 41:21.440
 The electron is not at the point, but the cloud spread out around the nucleus.

41:21.440 --> 41:26.880
 And so this fuzziness, this probabilistic aspect of reality is what quantum mechanics

41:26.880 --> 41:27.880
 describes.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.760
 Can I briefly pause on that idea?

41:31.760 --> 41:38.320
 Do you think this is quantum mechanics is just a really damn good approximation, a tool

41:38.320 --> 41:43.480
 for predicting reality, or does it actually describe reality?

41:43.480 --> 41:45.720
 Do you think reality is fuzzy at that level?

41:45.720 --> 41:49.800
 Well, I think that reality is fuzzy at that level, but I don't think quantum mechanics

41:49.800 --> 41:51.960
 is necessarily the end of the story.

41:51.960 --> 41:57.640
 So quantum mechanics is certainly an improvement over classical physics.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.440
 That much we know by experiments and so forth.

42:00.440 --> 42:05.040
 Whether I'm happy with quantum mechanics, whether I view quantum mechanics, for example,

42:05.040 --> 42:10.080
 the thought, the measurement description of quantum mechanics, am I happy with it?

42:10.080 --> 42:11.760
 Am I thinking that's the end stage or not?

42:11.760 --> 42:12.760
 I don't.

42:12.760 --> 42:17.240
 I don't think we're at the end of that story, and many physicists may or may not view this

42:17.240 --> 42:18.240
 way.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
 Some do, some don't.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.840
 But I think that it's the best we have right now, that's for sure.

42:22.840 --> 42:27.000
 It's the best approximation for reality we know today, and so far, we don't know what

42:27.000 --> 42:30.640
 it is, the next thing that improves it, replaces it, and so on.

42:30.640 --> 42:34.920
 But as I mentioned before, I don't believe any of the laws of physics we know today are

42:34.920 --> 42:36.440
 currently exactly correct.

42:36.440 --> 42:38.080
 It doesn't bother me.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.960
 I'm not like dogmatic, saying, I have figured out this is the law of nature.

42:41.960 --> 42:42.960
 I know everything.

42:42.960 --> 42:43.960
 No.

42:43.960 --> 42:47.840
 No, that's the beauty about science that we are not dogmatic.

42:47.840 --> 42:53.480
 And we are willing to, in fact, we are encouraged to be skeptical of what we ourselves do.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.120
 So you were talking about Dirac.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.520
 Yes, I was talking about Dirac.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.520
 Right.

42:57.520 --> 43:03.360
 So Dirac was trying to now combine this Schrodinger's equations, which was described in the context

43:03.360 --> 43:07.960
 of trying to talk about how these probabilistic waves of electrons move for the atom, which

43:07.960 --> 43:12.640
 was good for speeds which were not too close to the speed of light, to what happens when

43:12.640 --> 43:15.000
 you get to the near the speed of light.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.600
 So then you need relativity.

43:16.600 --> 43:20.840
 So then Dirac tried to combine Einstein's relativity with quantum mechanics.

43:20.840 --> 43:27.040
 So he tried to combine them, and he wrote this beautiful equation, the Dirac equation,

43:27.040 --> 43:32.320
 which roughly speaking, take the square root of the Einstein's equation in order to connect

43:32.320 --> 43:37.320
 it to Schrodinger's time evolution operator, which is first order in time derivative, to

43:37.320 --> 43:41.120
 get rid of the naive thing that Einstein's equation would have given, which is second

43:41.120 --> 43:42.120
 order.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.120
 So you have to take a square root.

43:43.120 --> 43:47.760
 Now, square root usually has a plus or minus sign when you take it.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.720
 And when he did this, he originally didn't notice this, didn't pay attention to this

43:51.720 --> 43:55.920
 plus or minus sign, but later physicists pointed out to Dirac, says, look, there's also this

43:55.920 --> 43:56.920
 minus sign.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.080
 And if you use this minus sign, you get negative energy.

44:00.080 --> 44:05.960
 In fact, it was very, very annoying that, you know, somebody else tells you this obvious

44:05.960 --> 44:06.960
 mistake you make.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.600
 Pauly, famous physicist, told Dirac, this is nonsense, you're going to get negative

44:10.600 --> 44:13.960
 energy with your equation, which negative energy without any bottom, you can go all

44:13.960 --> 44:16.600
 the way down to negative infinite energy.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.440
 So it doesn't make any sense.

44:18.440 --> 44:19.440
 Dirac thought about it.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.480
 And then he remembered Pauly's exclusion principle.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.880
 Just before him, Pauly had said, you know, there's this principle called the exclusion

44:25.880 --> 44:30.640
 principle that, you know, two or two electrons cannot be on the same orbit.

44:30.640 --> 44:36.640
 And so Dirac said, okay, you know what, all these negative energy states are filled orbits

44:36.640 --> 44:39.080
 occupied.

44:39.080 --> 44:45.080
 So according to you, Mr. Pauly, there's no place to go.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.560
 So therefore, they only have to go positive.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.400
 Sounded like a big cheat.

44:49.400 --> 44:54.080
 And then Pauly said, oh, you know what, we can change orbits from one orbit to another.

44:54.080 --> 44:57.760
 What if I take one of these negative energy orbits and put it up there?

44:57.760 --> 45:03.400
 Then it seems to be a new particle, which has opposite properties to the electron, has

45:03.400 --> 45:06.320
 positive energy, but it has positive charge.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.320
 What is that?

45:08.320 --> 45:13.680
 Dirac was a bit worried, he said, maybe that's proton because proton has plus charge.

45:13.680 --> 45:14.960
 He wasn't sure.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.720
 But then he said, oh, maybe it's proton.

45:16.720 --> 45:20.200
 But then they said, no, no, no, it has the same mass as the electron cannot be proton

45:20.200 --> 45:22.600
 because proton is heavier.

45:22.600 --> 45:23.600
 Dirac was stuck.

45:23.600 --> 45:27.920
 He says, well, then maybe another particle we haven't seen.

45:27.920 --> 45:32.080
 By that time, Dirac himself was getting a little bit worried about his own equation

45:32.080 --> 45:34.800
 and his own crazy interpretation.

45:34.800 --> 45:40.880
 After a few years later, Anderson, in the photographic place that he had gotten from

45:40.880 --> 45:47.120
 these cosmic rays, he discovered a particle which goes in the opposite direction that

45:47.120 --> 45:53.280
 the electron goes when there's a magnetic field and with the same mass, exactly like

45:53.280 --> 45:55.360
 what Dirac had predicted.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.800
 And this was what we call now positron.

45:57.800 --> 46:03.360
 And in fact, beginning with the work of Dirac, we know that every particle has an anti particle.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.960
 And so this idea that there's an anti particle came from the simple math, you know, there's

46:06.960 --> 46:12.920
 a plus and a minus from the Dirac's quote unquote mistake.

46:12.920 --> 46:18.520
 So again, trying to combine ideas, sometimes the math is smarter than the person who uses

46:18.520 --> 46:23.760
 them to apply it and you try to resist it and then you kind of confronted by criticism,

46:23.760 --> 46:25.160
 which is the way it should be.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.880
 So physicists comes and said, no, no, that's wrong and you corrected and so on.

46:27.880 --> 46:32.920
 So that is a development of the idea there's particle, there's anti particle and so on.

46:32.920 --> 46:36.880
 So this is the beginning of development of quantum mechanics and the connection with

46:36.880 --> 46:37.880
 relativity.

46:37.880 --> 46:41.400
 But the thing was more challenging because we had to also describe how electric and

46:41.400 --> 46:44.880
 magnetic fields work with quantum mechanics.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.680
 This was much more complicated because it's not just one point, electric and magnetic

46:48.680 --> 46:50.480
 fields were everywhere.

46:50.480 --> 46:54.680
 So you had to talk about fluctuating and a fuzziness of electrical field and magnetic

46:54.680 --> 46:56.560
 fields everywhere.

46:56.560 --> 47:00.800
 And the math for that was very difficult to deal with.

47:00.800 --> 47:03.880
 And this led to a subject called quantum field theory.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.760
 Fields like electric and magnetic fields had to be quantum, had to be described also in

47:07.760 --> 47:09.360
 a wavy way.

47:09.360 --> 47:15.680
 Fine men in particular was one of the pioneers along with Schringer's and others to try to

47:15.680 --> 47:21.360
 come up with a formalism to deal with fields like electric and magnetic fields interacting

47:21.360 --> 47:26.200
 with electrons in a consistent quantum fashion and they developed this beautiful theory quantum

47:26.200 --> 47:31.240
 electrodynamics from that and later on that same formalism quantum field theory led to

47:31.240 --> 47:37.920
 the discovery of other forces and other particles all consistent with the idea of quantum mechanics.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.920
 So that was how physics progressed.

47:40.920 --> 47:47.400
 And so basically we learned that all particles and all the forces are in some sense related

47:47.400 --> 47:49.880
 to particle exchanges.

47:49.880 --> 47:56.040
 And so for example, electromagnetic forces are mediated by a particle we call photon.

47:56.040 --> 48:00.400
 And so forth and the same for other forces that they discovered strong forces and the

48:00.400 --> 48:01.400
 weak forces.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.920
 So we got the sense of what quantum field theory is.

48:03.920 --> 48:12.280
 Is that a big leap of an idea that particles are fluctuations in the field?

48:12.280 --> 48:18.920
 Like the idea that everything is a field is the old Einstein light is a wave, both a particle

48:18.920 --> 48:20.400
 and a wave kind of idea.

48:20.400 --> 48:26.320
 Is that a huge leap in our understanding of conceiving the universe's fields?

48:26.320 --> 48:27.320
 I would say so.

48:27.320 --> 48:32.400
 I would say that viewing the particles, this duality that Bohr mentioned between particles

48:32.400 --> 48:36.600
 and waves that waves can behave sometimes like particles, sometimes like waves is one

48:36.600 --> 48:42.880
 of the biggest leaps of imagination that quantum mechanics made physicists do.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.560
 So I agree that that is quite remarkable.

48:45.560 --> 48:51.800
 Is duality fundamental to the universe or is it just because we don't understand it

48:51.800 --> 48:52.800
 fully?

48:52.800 --> 48:57.880
 Like will eventually collapse into a clean explanation that doesn't require duality?

48:57.880 --> 49:04.960
 Like that a phenomena could be two things at once and both to be true.

49:04.960 --> 49:05.960
 That seems weird.

49:05.960 --> 49:10.240
 So in fact, I was going to get to that when we get to string theory, but maybe I can comment

49:10.240 --> 49:11.240
 on that now.

49:11.240 --> 49:15.320
 Duality turns out to be running the show today and the whole thing that we are doing in string

49:15.320 --> 49:17.920
 theory, duality is the name of the game.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.920
 So it's the most beautiful subject and I want to talk about it.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.520
 Let's talk about it in the context of string theory then.

49:23.520 --> 49:29.080
 So we do want to take a next step into, because we mentioned general relativity, we mentioned

49:29.080 --> 49:30.580
 quantum mechanics.

49:30.580 --> 49:32.600
 Is there something to be said about quantum gravity?

49:32.600 --> 49:35.080
 Yes, that's exactly the right point to talk about.

49:35.080 --> 49:40.200
 So namely, we have talked about quantum fields and I talked about electric forces, photon

49:40.200 --> 49:42.820
 being the particle carrying those forces.

49:42.820 --> 49:48.160
 So for gravity, quantizing gravitational field, which is this curvature of space time

49:48.160 --> 49:52.680
 according to Einstein, you get another particle called graviton.

49:52.680 --> 49:55.160
 So what about gravitons?

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
 Should be there.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
 No problem.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.320
 So then you start computing it.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.600
 What do I mean by computing it?

50:00.600 --> 50:05.240
 Well you compute scattering of one graviton off another graviton, maybe with graviton

50:05.240 --> 50:08.360
 with an electron and so on, see what you get.

50:08.360 --> 50:14.640
 Even had already mastered this quantum electrodynamics, he said, no problem, let me do it.

50:14.640 --> 50:18.400
 Even though these are such weak forces, the gravity is very weak.

50:18.400 --> 50:23.360
 So therefore to see them, these quantum effects of gravitational waves was impossible.

50:23.360 --> 50:25.600
 It's even impossible today.

50:25.600 --> 50:28.000
 So Feynman just did it for fun.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.280
 He usually had this mindset that I want to do something which I will see in experiment,

50:31.280 --> 50:34.520
 but this one, let's just see what it does.

50:34.520 --> 50:39.920
 And he was surprised because the same techniques he was using for doing the same calculations

50:39.920 --> 50:44.800
 quantum electrodynamics when applied to gravity failed.

50:44.800 --> 50:48.040
 The formulas seemed to make sense, but he had to do some integrals and he found that

50:48.040 --> 50:51.280
 when he does those integrals, he got infinity.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.280
 And it didn't make any sense.

50:52.280 --> 50:55.600
 Now there were similar infinities in the other pieces that, but he had managed to make sense

50:55.600 --> 50:57.120
 out of those before.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.000
 This was no way he could make sense out of it.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.120
 He just didn't know what to do.

51:02.120 --> 51:05.920
 He didn't feel as an urgent issue because nobody could do the experiment.

51:05.920 --> 51:09.120
 So he was kind of said, okay, there's this thing, but okay, we don't know how to exactly

51:09.120 --> 51:11.800
 do it, but that's the way it is.

51:11.800 --> 51:17.000
 So in some sense, a natural conclusion from what Feynman did could have been like gravity

51:17.000 --> 51:21.240
 cannot be consistent with quantum theory, but that cannot be the case because gravity

51:21.240 --> 51:22.240
 is in our universe.

51:22.240 --> 51:25.720
 Quantum mechanics in our universe, they both together somehow should work.

51:25.720 --> 51:29.840
 So it's not acceptable to say they don't work together.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.960
 So that was a puzzle.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.480
 How does it possibly work?

51:32.480 --> 51:35.040
 It was left open.

51:35.040 --> 51:37.200
 And then we get to the string theory.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.920
 So this is the puzzle of quantum gravity.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.480
 The particle description of quantum gravity failed.

51:41.480 --> 51:43.240
 So the infinity shows up.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
 What do we do?

51:44.240 --> 51:46.000
 What do we do with infinity?

51:46.000 --> 51:47.200
 Let's get to the fun part.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.040
 Let's talk about string theory.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
 Yes.

51:51.040 --> 51:56.440
 Let's discuss some technical basics of string theory.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.880
 What is string theory?

51:57.880 --> 51:59.200
 What is the string?

51:59.200 --> 52:01.200
 How many dimensions are we talking about?

52:01.200 --> 52:02.200
 What are the different states?

52:02.200 --> 52:09.880
 How do we represent the elementary particles and the laws of physics using this new framework?

52:09.880 --> 52:17.880
 So string theory is the idea that the fundamental entities are not particles, but extended higher

52:17.880 --> 52:22.480
 dimensional objects, like one dimensional strings, like loops.

52:22.480 --> 52:29.840
 These loops could be open, like two ends, like an interval, or a circle without any ends.

52:29.840 --> 52:32.800
 And they're vibrating and moving around in space.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.680
 So how big they are?

52:34.680 --> 52:39.160
 Well, you can, of course, stretch it and make it big, or you can just let it be whatever

52:39.160 --> 52:40.160
 it wants.

52:40.160 --> 52:45.600
 It can be as small as a point because the circle can shrink to a point and be very light.

52:45.600 --> 52:49.720
 Or you can stretch it and it becomes very massive, or it could oscillate and become massive

52:49.720 --> 52:50.720
 that way.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.520
 It depends on which kind of state you have.

52:52.520 --> 52:56.440
 In fact, this string can have infinitely many modes, depending on which kind of oscillation

52:56.440 --> 52:57.440
 it's doing.

52:57.440 --> 53:01.360
 Like a guitar has different harmonics, string has different harmonics, but for the string,

53:01.360 --> 53:03.080
 each harmonic is a particle.

53:03.080 --> 53:07.560
 So each particle will give you, ah, this is a more massive harmonic, this is a less mass.

53:07.560 --> 53:11.440
 So the lightest harmonic, so to speak, is no harmonics, which means the string shrunk

53:11.440 --> 53:12.960
 to a point.

53:12.960 --> 53:18.720
 And then it becomes like a massless particles, or light particles, like photon and graviton,

53:18.720 --> 53:19.720
 and so forth.

53:19.720 --> 53:25.600
 So when you look at tiny strings, which are shrunk to a point, the lightest ones, they

53:25.600 --> 53:28.600
 look like the particles that we think they are like particles.

53:28.600 --> 53:31.200
 In other words, from far away, they look like a point.

53:31.200 --> 53:35.720
 But of course, if you zoom in, there's this tiny little circle that's there that's shrunk

53:35.720 --> 53:37.280
 to almost a point.

53:37.280 --> 53:42.160
 Should we be imagining, this is through the visual intuition, should we be imagining literally

53:42.160 --> 53:47.360
 strings that are potentially connected as a loop or not?

53:47.360 --> 53:54.000
 Between you and when somebody outside of physics is imagining a basic element of string theory,

53:54.000 --> 53:58.720
 which is a string, should we literally be thinking about a string?

53:58.720 --> 53:59.720
 Yes.

53:59.720 --> 54:02.760
 You should literally think about string, but string with zero thickness.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.080
 With zero thickness.

54:04.080 --> 54:08.880
 So now it's a loop of energy, so to speak, if you can't think of it that way.

54:08.880 --> 54:14.240
 And so there's a tension, like a regular string, if you pull it, you have to stretch it.

54:14.240 --> 54:16.360
 But it's not like a thickness, like a made of something.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.360
 It's just energy.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.800
 It's not made of atoms or something like that.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.800
 But it is very, very tiny.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.800
 Very tiny.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.840
 Much smaller than elementary particles of physics.

54:25.840 --> 54:26.840
 Much smaller.

54:26.840 --> 54:31.560
 So we think if you let the string to be by itself, the lowest state, there will be like

54:31.560 --> 54:36.320
 a fuzziness or a size of that tiny little circle, which is like a point, about, could

54:36.320 --> 54:40.440
 be anything between, we don't know exact size, but in different models have different sizes,

54:40.440 --> 54:44.880
 but something of the order of 10 to the minus, let's say 30 centimeters.

54:44.880 --> 54:48.520
 So 10 to the minus 30 centimeters, just to compare with the size of the atom, which is

54:48.520 --> 54:53.480
 10 to the minus eight centimeters, is 22 orders of magnitude smaller.

54:53.480 --> 54:56.360
 So unimaginably small, I would say.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.360
 Very small.

54:57.360 --> 55:01.040
 So we basically think from far away, string is like a point particle.

55:01.040 --> 55:05.240
 And that's why a lot of the things that we learned about point particle physics carries

55:05.240 --> 55:07.120
 over directly to strings.

55:07.120 --> 55:11.160
 So therefore, there's not much of a mystery why particle physics was successful, because

55:11.160 --> 55:14.680
 a string is like a particle when it's not stretched.

55:14.680 --> 55:20.760
 But it turns out having this size, being able to oscillate, get bigger, turned out to be

55:20.760 --> 55:27.240
 resolving these puzzles that Feynman was having in calculating his diagrams, and it gets rid

55:27.240 --> 55:28.680
 of those infinities.

55:28.680 --> 55:34.440
 So when you're trying to do those infinities, the regions that give infinities to Feynman,

55:34.440 --> 55:38.360
 as soon as you get to those regions, then this string starts to oscillate, and these

55:38.360 --> 55:43.080
 oscillation structure of the strings resolves those infinities to finite answer at the end.

55:43.080 --> 55:47.880
 So the size of the string, the fact that it's one dimensional, gives a finite answer at

55:47.880 --> 55:50.800
 the end, resolves this paradox.

55:50.800 --> 55:57.160
 Now perhaps it's also useful to recount of how string theory came to be, because it wasn't

55:57.160 --> 56:02.760
 like somebody say, well, let me solve the problem of Einstein's, solve the problem that Feynman

56:02.760 --> 56:08.200
 had with unifying Einstein's theory with quantum mechanics by replacing the point by a string.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.200
 No.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.200
 That's not the way the thought process.

56:10.200 --> 56:13.520
 The thought process was much more random.

56:13.520 --> 56:18.360
 Physicists, Venetian in this case, was trying to describe the interactions they were seeing

56:18.360 --> 56:22.240
 in colliders, in accelerators.

56:22.240 --> 56:26.440
 And they were seeing that some process, in some process, when two particles came together

56:26.440 --> 56:32.920
 and joined together and when they were separately in one way, and the opposite way, they behaved

56:32.920 --> 56:34.080
 the same way.

56:34.080 --> 56:38.920
 In some way, there was a symmetry, duality, which she didn't understand.

56:38.920 --> 56:42.000
 The particles didn't seem to have that symmetry.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.360
 He said, I don't know what it is, what's the reason that these colliders and experiments

56:45.360 --> 56:49.920
 we're doing seems to have the symmetry, but let me write the mathematical formula, which

56:49.920 --> 56:51.720
 exhibits that symmetry.

56:51.720 --> 56:56.720
 He used gamma functions, beta functions, and all that, complete math, no physics, other

56:56.720 --> 56:59.360
 than trying to get symmetry out of his equation.

56:59.360 --> 57:04.920
 He just wrote down a formula as the answer for a process, not a method to compute it.

57:04.920 --> 57:08.160
 Just say, wouldn't it be nice if this was the answer?

57:08.160 --> 57:09.160
 Yes.

57:09.160 --> 57:12.880
 Physics looked at this formula, that's intriguing, it has this symmetry, all right, but what

57:12.880 --> 57:13.880
 is this?

57:13.880 --> 57:15.280
 Where is this coming from?

57:15.280 --> 57:16.760
 Which kind of physics gives you this?

57:16.760 --> 57:19.760
 I don't know.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.880
 A few years later, people saw that, oh, the equation that you're writing, the process

57:23.880 --> 57:28.320
 that you're writing in the intermediate channels that particles come together, seems to have

57:28.320 --> 57:30.600
 all the harmonics.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.440
 Harmonics sounds like a string.

57:32.440 --> 57:35.360
 Let me see what you're describing has anything to do with the strings, and people try to

57:35.360 --> 57:37.640
 see what he's doing has anything to do with the strings.

57:37.640 --> 57:39.040
 Yeah, indeed.

57:39.040 --> 57:43.040
 If I study scattering of two strings, I get exactly the formula you wrote down.

57:43.040 --> 57:48.640
 That was the reinterpretation of what he had written in the formula as a string, but

57:48.640 --> 57:51.200
 still had nothing to do with gravity.

57:51.200 --> 57:55.320
 It had nothing to do with resolving the problems of gravity with quantum mechanics.

57:55.320 --> 58:01.280
 It was just trying to explain a process that people were seeing in hadronic physics collisions.

58:01.280 --> 58:08.320
 So it took a few more years to get to that point, they noticed that, physicists noticed

58:08.320 --> 58:13.360
 that whenever you try to find the spectrum of strings, you always get a massless particle

58:13.360 --> 58:18.200
 which has exactly properties that the graviton is supposed to have, and no particle in hadronic

58:18.200 --> 58:20.240
 physics that had that property.

58:20.240 --> 58:25.800
 You are getting a massless graviton as part of this scattering without looking for it.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.720
 It was forced on you.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.920
 People were not trying to solve quantum gravity.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.840
 Quantum gravity was pushed on them.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.480
 I don't want this graviton.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.480
 Get rid of it.

58:34.480 --> 58:36.120
 They couldn't get rid of it.

58:36.120 --> 58:38.640
 They gave up trying to get rid of it.

58:38.640 --> 58:43.360
 Physicists, Sheridan Short said, you know what, string theory is theory of quantum gravity.

58:43.360 --> 58:45.720
 They've changed the perspective altogether.

58:45.720 --> 58:49.880
 We are not describing the hadronic physics, we are describing the theory of quantum gravity.

58:49.880 --> 58:55.360
 And that's one string theory probably got like exciting that this could be the unifying

58:55.360 --> 58:56.360
 theory.

58:56.360 --> 58:57.360
 Exactly.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.640
 It got exciting, but at the same time not so fast.

58:59.640 --> 59:03.080
 Namely, it should have been fast, but it wasn't.

59:03.080 --> 59:07.160
 Because particle physics through quantum field theory were so successful at that time.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.080
 This is mid-'70s.

59:09.080 --> 59:12.760
 Standard model of physics, electromagnetism and unification of electromagnetic forces

59:12.760 --> 59:17.720
 with all the other forces were beginning to take place without the gravity part.

59:17.720 --> 59:21.000
 Everything was working beautifully for particle physics.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.600
 And so that was the shining golden age of quantum field theory and all the experiments,

59:25.600 --> 59:29.920
 solid model, this and that, unification, spontaneous symmetry breaking was taking place.

59:29.920 --> 59:31.160
 All of them was nice.

59:31.160 --> 59:34.480
 This was kind of like a side true and nobody was paying so much attention.

59:34.480 --> 59:37.480
 This exotic string is needed for quantum gravity.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.480
 Maybe there's other ways.

59:38.480 --> 59:39.600
 Maybe we should do something else.

59:39.600 --> 59:42.200
 So anyway, it wasn't paid much attention to.

59:42.200 --> 59:48.200
 And this took a little bit more effort to try to actually connect it to reality.

59:48.200 --> 59:49.280
 There were a few more steps.

59:49.280 --> 59:54.240
 First of all, there was a puzzle that you were getting extra dimensions.

59:54.240 --> 59:57.920
 String was not working well with three spatial dimensions on one time.

59:57.920 --> 1:00:00.240
 It needed extra dimension.

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:04.440
 Now there are different versions of strings, but the version that ended up being related

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:09.440
 to having particles like electron, what we call fermions, needed 10 dimensions, what

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:12.320
 we call super string.

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:13.320
 Now why super?

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:14.320
 Why the word super?

1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:21.440
 It turns out this version of the string, which had fermions, had an extra symmetry,

1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:24.040
 which we call supersymmetry.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:29.720
 This is a symmetry between a particle and another particle with exactly the same property,

1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:31.680
 same mass, same charge, etc.

1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:36.320
 The only difference is that one of them has a little different spin than the other one.

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:40.560
 One of them is a boson, one of them is a fermion because of that shift of spin.

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:41.920
 Otherwise, they're identical.

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:43.880
 So there was this symmetry.

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:45.560
 String theory had the symmetry.

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:51.640
 In fact, supersymmetry was discovered through string theory, theoretically.

1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:55.760
 So theoretically, the first place that this was observed when you were describing these

1:00:55.760 --> 1:00:57.800
 fermionic strings.

1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:02.360
 So that was the beginning of the study of supersymmetry was via string theory.

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:07.880
 And then it had remarkable properties that the symmetry meant and so forth that people

1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:10.840
 began studying supersymmetry after that.

1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:16.120
 And that was a kind of a tangent direction at the beginning for string theory, but people

1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:19.080
 in particle physics started also thinking, oh, supersymmetry is great.

1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:22.520
 Let's see if we can have supersymmetry in particle physics and so forth.

1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:26.320
 Forget about strings and they developed on a different track as well.

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:30.800
 Supersymmetry in different models became a subject on its own right, understanding supersymmetry

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:32.480
 and what does this mean?

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:36.120
 Because it unified bosons and fermions, unified some ideas together.

1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:41.760
 So photon is a boson, electron is a fermion, could things like that be somehow related?

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:46.080
 It was a kind of a natural kind of a question to try to kind of unify because in physics

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:48.160
 we love unification.

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:51.720
 Now gradually string theory was beginning to show signs of unification.

1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:56.760
 It had graviton, but people found that they also have things like photons in them.

1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:58.680
 Different excitations of string behave like photons.

1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:01.160
 Another one behaves like electron.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:05.880
 So a single string was unifying all these particles into one object.

1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:07.440
 That's remarkable.

1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:10.160
 It's in ten dimensions though.

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:13.560
 It is not our universe because we live in three plus one dimension.

1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:15.720
 How could that be possibly true?

1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:18.320
 So this was a conundrum.

1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:19.320
 It was elegant.

1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:23.760
 It was beautiful, but it was very specific about which dimension you're getting, which

1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:25.160
 structure you're getting.

1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:29.040
 It wasn't saying, oh, you just put D equals to four, you'll get your space time dimension

1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:30.040
 that you want.

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:31.040
 No, it didn't like that.

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:34.440
 It said, I want ten dimensions and that's the way it is.

1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:35.800
 So it was very specific.

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:40.880
 Now so people try to reconcile this by the idea that maybe these extra dimensions are

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:42.120
 tiny.

1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:49.560
 So if you take three macroscopic spatial dimensions at one time and six extra tiny spatial dimensions,

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:56.040
 like tiny spheres or tiny circles, then it avoids contradiction with manifest fact that

1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:59.880
 we haven't seen extra dimensions in experiments today.

1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:03.160
 So that was a way to avoid conflict.

1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:09.560
 Now this was a way to avoid conflict, but it was not observed in experiments.

1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:13.080
 Having observed in experiments, no, because it's so small.

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:16.520
 So it's beginning to sound a little bit funny.

1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:21.800
 Similar feeling to the way perhaps Dirac had felt about this positron plus or minus, you

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:25.560
 know, it was beginning to sound a little bit like, oh yeah, not only you have to have ten

1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:28.840
 dimensions, but I also have to have this, I have to also have this.

1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:34.360
 And so conservative physicists would say, hmm, you know, I haven't seen these experiments.

1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:35.960
 I don't know if they are really there.

1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:37.240
 Are you pulling my leg?

1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:40.600
 Do you want me to imagine things that are not there?

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.400
 So this was an attitude of some physicists just towards string theory, despite the fact

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:51.000
 that the puzzle of gravity and quantum mechanics merging together work, but still was a skepticism.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.160
 You're putting all these things that you want me to imagine, there are these extra dimensions

1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:56.160
 that I cannot see.

1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:59.320
 And you want me to believe that string that you have not even seen experiments are real.

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.240
 Okay, what else do you want me to believe?

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.480
 So it was kind of beginning to sound a little funny.

1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:11.240
 Now, I will pass forward a little bit further, if you decades later, when string theory became

1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:16.920
 the mainstream of efforts to unify the forces and particles together, we learned that these

1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:20.840
 extra dimensions actually solved problems.

1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:24.640
 They weren't a nuisance the way they originally appeared.

1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:29.560
 First of all, the properties of these extra dimensions reflected the number of particles

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.600
 we got in four dimensions.

1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:36.080
 If you took these six dimensions to have like six, five holes or four holes, it changed

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:40.680
 the number of particles that you see in four dimensional space time, you get one electron

1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:44.640
 and one muon if you had this, but if you did the other J shape, you get something else.

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:47.720
 So geometrically, you could get different kinds of physics.

1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:53.440
 So it was kind of a mirroring of geometry by physics down in the macroscopic space.

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:56.280
 So these extra dimension were becoming useful.

1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:00.640
 Fine, but we didn't need extra dimensions to just write an electron in three dimensions.

1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:03.000
 We did rewrote it, so what?

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.200
 Was there any other puzzle?

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:06.320
 Yes, there were.

1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:07.480
 Hawking.

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:12.960
 Hawking had been studying black holes in mid seventies, following the work of Beckenstein,

1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:18.080
 what predicted that black holes have entropy.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:21.640
 So Beckenstein had tried to attach entropy to the black hole.

1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:25.800
 If you throw something into the black hole, the entropy seems to go down because you had

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:29.240
 something entropy outside the black hole and you throw it.

1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:33.600
 The black hole was unique, so the entropy did not have any black hole at no entropy.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:36.080
 So the entropy seemed to go down.

1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:38.080
 And so that's against the laws of thermodynamics.

1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:42.200
 So Beckenstein was trying to say, no, no, therefore black hole must have an entropy.

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:47.160
 So he was trying to understand that he found that if you assign entropy to be proportional

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:49.320
 to the area of the black hole, it seems to work.

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:54.320
 And then Hawking found not only that's correct, he found the correct proportionality factor

1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:59.560
 of factor of one quarter of the area and Planck units is the correct amount of entropy.

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:05.520
 And he gave an argument using semi classical arguments, which means basically using a little

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:09.400
 bit of quantum mechanics because he didn't have the full quantum mechanics of string

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:10.400
 there.

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:13.040
 He could do some aspects of approximate quantum arguments.

1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:17.560
 So he risked quantum arguments that led to this entropy formula.

1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:20.880
 But then he didn't answer the following question.

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:25.000
 He was getting a big entropy for the black hole, the black hole with the size of a horizon

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.960
 of a black hole is huge, has a huge amount of entropy.

1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:29.800
 What are the microstates of this entropy?

1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:34.640
 When you say, for example, the gas of entropy, you count where the atoms are, you count this

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:38.800
 bucket or that bucket, there's that information about there and so on, you count them.

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:41.920
 For the black hole, the way Hawking was thinking, there was no degree of freedom.

1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:44.620
 You throw them in and there was just one solution.

1:06:44.620 --> 1:06:47.360
 So where are these entropy?

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:50.240
 What are these microscopic states?

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.080
 They were hidden somewhere.

1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:58.160
 So later in string theory, the work that we did with my colleague Stromiger in particular

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:06.160
 showed that these ingredients in string theory of black hole arise from the extra dimensions.

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:11.080
 So the degrees of freedom are hidden in terms of things like strings, wrapping these extra

1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:13.800
 circles in this hidden dimensions.

1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:18.080
 And then we started counting how many ways like the strings can wrap around this circle

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:22.040
 and the extra dimension or that circle and counted the microscopic degrees of freedom.

1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:26.480
 And lo and behold, we got the microscopic degrees of freedom that Hawking was predicting

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:27.840
 four dimensions.

1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:32.840
 So the extra dimensions became useful for resolving a puzzle in four dimensions.

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:36.720
 The puzzle was, where are the degrees of freedom of the black hole hidden?

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:41.120
 The answer, hidden in the extra dimensions, the tiny extra dimensions.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:46.200
 So then by this time, it was beginning to, we see aspects that extra dimensions are

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:47.360
 useful for many things.

1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:48.800
 That's not a nuisance.

1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:51.280
 It wasn't to be kind of, you know, be ashamed of.

1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:55.040
 It was actually in the welcome features, new feature, nevertheless.

1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:59.680
 How do you intuit the 10 dimensional world?

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:06.480
 So yes, it's a feature for describing certain phenomena like the entropy in black holes.

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:16.160
 But what you said that to you, a theory becomes real or becomes powerful when you can connect

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:18.280
 it to some deep intuition.

1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:20.600
 So how do we intuit 10 dimensions?

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:21.600
 Yes.

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:25.000
 So I will explain how some of the analogies work.

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.880
 First of all, we do a lot of analogies.

1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:31.120
 And by analogies, we build intuition.

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:33.160
 So I will start with this example.

1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:38.800
 I will try to explain that if we are in 10 dimensional space, if we have a seven dimensional

1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:45.120
 plane and eight dimensional plane, we ask typically in what space do they intersect

1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:46.880
 each other in what dimension?

1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:50.680
 That might sound like, how do you possibly give an answer to this?

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:52.520
 So we start with lower dimensions.

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:53.520
 We start with two dimensions.

1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:58.640
 We say if you have one dimension and a point, do they intersect typically on a plane?

1:08:58.640 --> 1:08:59.640
 The answer is no.

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:04.800
 So a line one dimensional, a point zero dimension on a two dimensional plane, they don't typically

1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:05.880
 meet.

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:10.640
 But if you have a one dimensional line and another line, which is one plus one on a plane,

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:13.920
 they typically intersect at a point.

1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:17.200
 That means if you're not parallel, typically they intersect at a point.

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.600
 So one plus one is two.

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:23.120
 And in two dimension, they intersect at a zero dimensional point.

1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:26.960
 So you see two dimension, one and one two, two minus two is zero.

1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:30.040
 So we get point out of intersection, okay?

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:31.960
 Let's go to three dimension.

1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:33.920
 You have a plane, two dimensional plane and a point.

1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:34.920
 Do they intersect?

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.960
 No, two and zero.

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.360
 How about a plane and a line?

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:44.080
 A plane is two dimensional and a line is one, two plus one is three, in three dimension,

1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:49.880
 a plane and a line meet at points, which is zero dimensional, three minus three is zero.

1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:50.880
 Okay?

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:54.120
 So plane and a line intersect at a point in three dimension.

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.040
 How about a plane and a plane in 3D?

1:09:56.040 --> 1:09:59.280
 A plane is two and this is two, two plus two is four.

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:02.840
 In 3D, four minus three is one, they intersect on a one dimensional line.

1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:03.840
 Okay?

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:04.840
 We're beginning to see the pattern.

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:05.840
 Okay.

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:06.840
 Now come to the question.

1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:07.840
 We're in ten dimensions.

1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:08.840
 Now we have the intuition.

1:10:08.840 --> 1:10:11.620
 One dimensional plane and eight dimensional plane in ten dimension.

1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:13.280
 They intersect on a plane.

1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:14.280
 What's the dimension?

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:16.960
 What's seven plus eight is 15 minus 10 is five.

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:22.640
 We draw the same picture as two planes and we write seven dimension, eight dimension,

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:27.040
 but we have gotten the intuition from the lower dimensional one, what to expect.

1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:28.740
 It doesn't scare us anymore.

1:10:28.740 --> 1:10:30.280
 So we draw this picture.

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:35.320
 We cannot see all the seven dimensions by looking at this two dimensional visualization

1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:38.440
 of it, but it has all the features we want.

1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:42.800
 It has, so we draw this picture, it says seven, seven and they meet at the five dimensional

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:43.800
 plane.

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:44.800
 It says five.

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:48.600
 So we have, we have built this intuition now.

1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.960
 This is an example of how we come up with intuition.

1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:55.920
 Let me give you more examples of it because I think this will show you that people have

1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:00.880
 to come up with intuitions to visualize that otherwise we will be a little bit lost.

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:04.960
 So what you just described is kind of in these high dimensional spaces, focus on the

1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:10.160
 meeting place of two planes in high dimensional spaces.

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:11.160
 Exactly.

1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:14.520
 How the planes meet, for example, what's the dimension of their intersection and so

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:15.520
 on.

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:16.840
 So how do we come up with intuition?

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.800
 We borrow examples from lower dimensions, build up intuition and draw the same pictures

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:26.440
 as if we are talking about 10 dimensions, but we are drawing the same as a two dimensional

1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:28.360
 plane because we cannot do any better.

1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:32.680
 But our, our, our words change, but not our pictures.

1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:39.200
 So your sense is we can have a deep understanding of reality by looking at its, at, at slices,

1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:41.040
 a lower dimensional slices.

1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:42.040
 Exactly.

1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:43.040
 Exactly.

1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.560
 And this, this is the, brings me to the next example I want to mention, which is sphere.

1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:48.320
 Let's think about how do we think about the sphere?

1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:52.920
 Well, the sphere is a sphere, you know, the round nice thing, but sphere has a circular

1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:54.920
 symmetry.

1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:57.880
 Now I can't describe the sphere in the following way.

1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:04.600
 I can describe it by an interval, which is think about this going from the north of the

1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:06.520
 sphere to the south.

1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:09.600
 And at each point, I have a circle attached to it.

1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:13.960
 So you can think about the sphere as a line with a circle attached with each point, the

1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:18.200
 circle shrinks to a, the circle shrinks to a point at end points of the interval.

1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:24.480
 So I can say, oh, one way to think about the sphere is an interval where at each point

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:27.400
 on that interval, there's another circle I'm not drawing.

1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:30.240
 But if you like, you can just draw it, say, okay, I want to draw it.

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:34.520
 So from now on, there's this mnemonic, I draw an interval when I want to talk about the

1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:35.520
 sphere.

1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:38.680
 And you remember that the end points of the interval mean a strong circle.

1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:39.680
 That's all.

1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:41.120
 And then you say, yeah, I see, that's a sphere.

1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:42.120
 Good.

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.440
 Now we want to talk about the product of two spheres.

1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:45.440
 That's four dimensional.

1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:46.880
 How can I visualize it?

1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:47.880
 Easy.

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:54.600
 You just take an interval and another interval, that's just going to be a square.

1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:56.600
 Square is a four dimensional space.

1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:57.600
 Yeah.

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:58.600
 Why is that?

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.320
 Well, at each point on the square, there's two circles, one for each of those directions

1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.040
 you drew.

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:08.520
 And when you get to the boundaries of each direction, one of the circle shrinks on each

1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:09.520
 edge of that square.

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:14.840
 And when you get to the corners of the square, all both circle shrinks, this is a sphere

1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:15.840
 time the sphere.

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:16.840
 I have divine interval.

1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:19.840
 I just described for you a four dimensional space.

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:21.720
 Do you want a six dimensional space?

1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:23.160
 No problem.

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:25.840
 Take the, take a corner of a room.

1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:28.840
 In fact, if you want to have a sphere times a stick, take sphere times a sphere times

1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:30.440
 a sphere.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:32.320
 Take a cube.

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:38.480
 A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space, two sphere times another sphere times

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:41.920
 another sphere, where three of the circles I'm not drawing for you.

1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:43.840
 For each one of those directions, there's another circle.

1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:47.160
 But each time you get to the boundary of the cube, one circle shrinks.

1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:50.880
 When the boundaries meet two circle shrinks, when three boundaries meet all the three

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:52.040
 circle shrinks.

1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:53.400
 So I just give you a picture.

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:56.720
 Now, mathematicians come up with amazing things like, you know what?

1:13:56.720 --> 1:13:59.480
 I want to take a point in space and blow it up.

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:02.560
 You know, these concepts like topology and geometry, complicated.

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:03.560
 How do you do?

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.480
 In this picture, it's very easy.

1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:06.480
 Blow it up.

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:07.960
 In this picture, means the following.

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:12.960
 You think about this cube, you go to the corner and you chop off a corner.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:17.680
 Chopping off the corner replaces the point, it's a point by a triangle.

1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:19.040
 That's called blowing up a point.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:22.440
 And then this triangle is what they call P2, projective two space.

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:25.160
 But these pictures are very physical and you feel it.

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:26.160
 There's nothing amazing.

1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:28.320
 I'm not talking about six dimensions.

1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:30.600
 Four plus six is ten, the dimension of string theory.

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.240
 So we can visualize it, no problem.

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:36.960
 Okay, so that's building the intuition to a complicated world of string theory.

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.280
 Nevertheless, these objects are really small.

1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:44.280
 And just like you said, experimental validation is very difficult because the objects are

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:49.600
 way smaller than anything that we currently have the tools and accelerators and so on

1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:53.920
 to reveal through experiment.

1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:59.520
 So there's a kind of skepticism that's not just about the nature of the theory because

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:04.280
 of the ten dimensions as you've explained, but in that we can't experimentally validate

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:10.640
 it and it doesn't necessarily to date, maybe you can correct me, predict something fundamentally

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:12.160
 new.

1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:18.400
 So it's beautiful as an explaining theory, which means that it's very possible that it

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:23.200
 is a fundamental theory that describes reality and unifies the laws, but there's still a

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:31.720
 kind of skepticism and me from sort of an odd side observer perspective have been observing

1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:37.380
 a little bit of a growing cynicism about string theory in the recent few years.

1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:43.960
 Can you describe the cynicism about sort of by cynicism, I mean a cynicism about the

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:50.920
 hope for this theory of pushing theoretical physics forward.

1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:56.600
 Can you do describe why the cynicism and how do we reverse that trend?

1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:05.440
 First of all, the criticism for string theory is healthy in a sense that in science, we

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:10.240
 have to have different viewpoints and that's good, so I welcome criticism.

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:14.460
 And the reason for criticism and I think that is a valid reason is that there has been

1:16:14.460 --> 1:16:20.520
 zero experimental evidence for string theory, that is no experiment has been done to show

1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:24.280
 that there's this loop of energy moving around.

1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.600
 And so that's a valid objection and valid worry.

1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:32.520
 And if I were to say, you know what, string theory can never be verified or experimentally

1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:36.760
 checked, that's the way it is, they would have every right to say what you're talking

1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:40.940
 about is not science because in science, we will have to have experimental consequences

1:16:40.940 --> 1:16:42.440
 and checks.

1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:46.280
 The difference between string theory and something which is not scientific is that string theory

1:16:46.280 --> 1:16:47.720
 has predictions.

1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:52.040
 The problem is that the predictions we have today of string theory is hard to access by

1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:56.400
 experiments available with the energies we can achieve with the colliders today.

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:59.960
 It doesn't mean there's a problem with string theory, it just means technologically we're

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.760
 not that far ahead.

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:06.840
 Now, we can have two attitudes, you say, well, if that's the case, why are you studying this

1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:09.560
 subject because you can't do experiment today.

1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:14.720
 Now this is becoming a little bit more like mathematics in that sense, you say, well,

1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:18.480
 I want to learn, I want to know what the nature works, even though I cannot prove it today

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:21.200
 that this is it because of experiments.

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:24.360
 That should not prevent my mind not to think about that.

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:28.320
 So that's the attitude many string theories follow that that should be like this.

1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:32.480
 Now, so that's the answer to the criticism, but there's actually a better answer to the

1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:34.200
 criticism, I would say.

1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:38.800
 We don't have experimental evidence for string theory, but we have theoretical evidence for

1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:39.800
 string theory.

1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:43.280
 And what do I mean by theoretical evidence for string theory?

1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:47.640
 String theory has connected different parts of physics together.

1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:49.840
 It didn't have to.

1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:53.560
 It has brought connections between part of physics, although suppose you're just interested

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:55.000
 in particle physics.

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000
 Suppose you're not even interested in gravity at all.

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.800
 It turns out there are part properties of certain particle physics models that string

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:09.080
 theory has been able to solve using gravity, using ideas from string theory, ideas known

1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:13.480
 as holography, which is relating something which has to do with particles to something

1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:15.680
 having to do with gravity.

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:17.800
 Why did it have to be this rich?

1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:20.320
 The subject is very rich.

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:23.080
 It's not something we were smart enough to develop.

1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:24.080
 It came at us.

1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:28.160
 I want to explain to you the development of string theory came from accidental discovery.

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:31.680
 It wasn't because we were smart enough to come up with the idea of string, of course,

1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:32.680
 as gravity.

1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:33.680
 No.

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:34.680
 It was accidental discovery.

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:37.880
 So some people say it's not fair to say we have no evidence for string theory.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:41.440
 Graviton, gravity, is an evidence for string theory.

1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:43.320
 It's predicted by string theory.

1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:44.480
 We didn't put it by hand.

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:45.960
 We got it.

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:51.160
 So there's a qualitative check that, okay, gravity is a prediction of string theory.

1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:56.640
 It's a post fiction because we know gravity existed, but still, logically, it is a prediction

1:18:56.640 --> 1:19:01.440
 because really, we didn't know it had, it's a graviton that we later learned that, oh,

1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:02.800
 that's the same as gravity.

1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.440
 So literally, that's the way it was discovered.

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.600
 It wasn't put in by hand.

1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:12.000
 So there are many things like that that there are different facets of physics, like questions

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.120
 in condensed matter physics, questions of particle physics, questions about this and

1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:23.600
 that has come together to find beautiful answers by using ideas from string theory at the same

1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:27.280
 time as a lot of new math has emerged.

1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:32.160
 That's an aspect which I wouldn't emphasize as evidence to physicists necessarily because

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:35.720
 they would say, okay, great, you got some math, but what does it do with reality?

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:41.160
 But as I explained, many of the physical principles we know of have beautiful math underpinning

1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:42.160
 them.

1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:47.360
 That certainly leads further confidence that we may not be going astray, even though that's

1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:49.600
 not the foolproof as we know.

1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:54.400
 So there are these aspects that give further evidence for string theory, connections between

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:57.600
 each other, connection with the real world, but then there are other things that come

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:01.840
 about and I can try to give examples of that.

1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:05.960
 So these are further evidences and these are certain predictions of string theory.

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:11.880
 They are not as detailed as we want, but there are still predictions.

1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:15.600
 Why is the dimension of space on time 3 plus 1?

1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:23.480
 Say, I don't know, just deal with it, 3 plus 1, but in physics we want to know why.

1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:29.520
 Well, take a random dimension from 1 to infinity, what's your random dimension?

1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:33.400
 A random dimension from 1 to infinity would not be 4.

1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:36.360
 It would most likely be a humongous number if not infinity.

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:41.480
 I mean, there's no, if you choose any reasonable distribution which goes from 1 to infinity,

1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:44.120
 3 or 4 would not be your pick.

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:48.560
 The fact that we are in 3 or 4 dimension is already strange.

1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:52.760
 The fact that strings is, sorry, I cannot go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something.

1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:56.440
 The fact that they're just upper bound, the range is not from 1 to infinity, it's from

1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:58.800
 1 to 10 or 11 or whatnot.

1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:03.200
 It already brings a natural prior, oh yeah, 3 or 4 is, you know, it's just on the average.

1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:06.080
 If you pick some of the compactifications, then it could easily be that.

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.120
 So in other words, it makes it much more possible that it could be 3 of our universe.

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:16.040
 So the fact that the dimension already is so small, it should be surprising.

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:17.440
 We don't ask that question.

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:22.560
 We should be surprised because we could have conceived of universes with our predimension.

1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:24.400
 Why is it that we have such a small dimension?

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:25.400
 That's number one.

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:30.920
 So, oh, so, so good theory of the universe should give you an intuition of the why it's

1:21:30.920 --> 1:21:37.240
 4 or 3 plus 1 and it's not obvious that it should be, that they, that should be explained.

1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:43.160
 We take that as an assumption, but that's a thing that should be explained.

1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:44.160
 Yeah.

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:45.160
 So we haven't explained that in string theory.

1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:49.080
 Actually, I did write a model within string theory to try to describe why we end up with

1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:54.960
 3 plus 1 space time dimensions, which are big compared to the rest of them.

1:21:54.960 --> 1:22:00.280
 And even though this has not been, the technical difficulties to prove it is still not there,

1:22:00.280 --> 1:22:05.400
 but I will explain the idea because the idea connects to some other piece of elegant math,

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:06.400
 which is the following.

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:12.840
 Consider a universe made of a box, a three dimensional box, or in fact, if we set a string

1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:17.280
 theory, nine dimensional box, because we have nine spatial dimensional on time.

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:20.320
 So imagine a nine dimensional box.

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:25.680
 So we should imagine the box of a typical size of the string, which is small.

1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:30.680
 So the universe would naturally small start with a very tiny nine dimensional box.

1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:31.680
 What do strings do?

1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:35.400
 Well, strings go, you know, go around the box and move around and vibrate and all that,

1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:40.920
 but also they can wrap around the one side of the box to the other because I'm imagining

1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:44.640
 a box with periodic boundary conditions, so what we call the torus.

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.960
 So the string can go from one side to the other.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:48.520
 This is what we call a winding string.

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:51.520
 The string can wind around the box.

1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:56.400
 Now, suppose you have, you now evolve the universe because there's energy, the universe

1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:01.320
 starts to expand, but it doesn't, it doesn't expand too far.

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:02.320
 Why is it?

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:06.800
 Well, because there are these strings which are wrapped around from one side of the wall

1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:08.240
 to the other.

1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:13.040
 When the universe, the walls of the universe are growing, it is stretching the string and

1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:16.040
 the strings are becoming very, very massive.

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:17.640
 So it becomes difficult to expand.

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:20.080
 It kind of puts a halt on it.

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:23.680
 In order to not put a halt, a string which is going this way and a string which is going

1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:29.520
 that way should, should intersect each other and disconnect each other and unwind.

1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:33.400
 So a string which is winds this way and the string which finds the opposite way should

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:38.800
 find each other to, to, to reconnect and this way disappear.

1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:43.320
 So if they find each other and they, they, they disappear, but how can strings find each

1:23:43.320 --> 1:23:44.320
 other?

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:48.800
 Well, the string moves and the other string moves, a string is one dimensional, one plus

1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:53.760
 one is two and one plus one is two and two plus two is four.

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:57.120
 In four dimensional space time, they will find each other.

1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:00.320
 In a higher dimensional space time, they typically miss each other.

1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:01.560
 Oh, interesting.

1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:04.160
 So if the dimensions were too big, they would miss each other.

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:05.920
 They wouldn't be able to expand.

1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:10.160
 So in order to expand, they have to find each other and three of them can find each other

1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:12.440
 and those can expand and the other one will be stuck.

1:24:12.440 --> 1:24:16.520
 So that, that explains why within string theory, these particular dimensions are really big

1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:17.880
 and full of exciting stuff.

1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:18.880
 That could be an explanation.

1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:23.040
 That's the model we, we, we suggested with my colleague Brandenberger.

1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:25.080
 But it turns out we relate to the D piece of math.

1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:32.760
 You see, for mathematicians, manifolds of dimension bigger than four are simple.

1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:36.160
 Four dimension is the hardest dimension for math.

1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:39.840
 It turns out, and it turns out the reason it's difficult is the following.

1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:45.600
 It turns out that in higher dimension, you use, you use what's called surgery in mathematical

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:51.480
 terminology where you use these two dimensional tubes to maneuver them off of each other.

1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:56.040
 So you have two plus two becoming four and higher than four dimension, you can pass them

1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:58.960
 through each other without them intersecting.

1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:04.120
 In four dimension, two plus two doesn't allow you to pass them through each other.

1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:08.000
 So the same techniques that work in higher dimension don't work in four dimension because

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.160
 two plus two is four.

1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:13.920
 The same reasoning I was just telling you about strings finding each other in four ends

1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:18.800
 up to be the reason why four is much more complicated to classify for mathematicians

1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:19.800
 as well.

1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:21.160
 So, so there might be these, these things.

1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:25.680
 So I cannot say that this is the reason that string theory is, is giving you three plus

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:27.400
 one, but it could be a model for it.

1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:31.880
 And so, so there are these kinds of ideas that could underlie why we have three extra

1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:34.920
 dimensions which are large and the rest of them are small, but absolutely, we have to

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:35.920
 have a good reason.

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:36.920
 We cannot leave it like that.

1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:40.640
 Can I ask a tricky human question?

1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:44.720
 So you are one of the seminal figures in string theory.

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:46.360
 You got the breakthrough prize.

1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:48.360
 You worked with Edward Witton.

1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:53.440
 There's no Nobel Prize that has been given on string theory.

1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:57.440
 You know, credit assignment is tricky in science.

1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:02.720
 It makes you quite sad, especially big, like LIGO, big experimental projects when so many

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:04.960
 incredible people have been involved.

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.120
 And yet the Nobel Prize is annoying in that it's only given to three people.

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:14.720
 Who do you think gets the Nobel Prize for string theory at first?

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:25.000
 If it turns out that it, if not in full, then in part is, is a good model of the way the

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.600
 physics of the universe works.

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:29.000
 Who are the key figures?

1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.120
 Maybe let's put Nobel Prize aside for the key figures.

1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:33.120
 Okay.

1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:34.120
 I like the second version of the question.

1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:38.560
 I think to try to give a prize to one person in string theory doesn't do justice to the

1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:40.000
 diversity of the subject.

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000
 That to me is.

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:45.200
 There was quite a lot of incredible people in the history, quite a lot of people.

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:49.080
 I mean, starting with Veneziano, who wasn't talking about strings, I mean, he wrote down

1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:50.600
 the, the beginning of the strings.

1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:52.080
 We cannot ignore that for sure.

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:56.160
 And so, so you start with that and you go on with various other figures and so on.

1:26:56.160 --> 1:26:59.800
 So there are different epochs in string theory and different people have been pushing it

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:00.800
 then.

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:05.400
 So for example, the early epoch, we just told you people like, like Veneziano and Nambu

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:09.920
 and the Soskin and others were pushing it green and shorts were pushing it and so forth.

1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:11.720
 So this was or shirk and so on.

1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:16.920
 So these were the initial periods of pioneers, I would say of string theory.

1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:21.960
 And then there were, there were the mid 80s that Edward Whitten was the major proponent

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:22.960
 of string theory.

1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:27.600
 And he really changed the landscape of string theory in terms of what people do and how,

1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:28.600
 how we view it.

1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:34.560
 And I think his efforts brought a lot of attention to the community about high energy community

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:38.520
 to focus on this effort as the correct theory of unification of forces.

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:43.120
 So he brought a lot of research as well as of course the first rate work he himself did

1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:44.120
 to this area.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:49.000
 So that's in mid 80s and onwards and also in mid 90s where he was one of the proponents

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.960
 of the duality revolution in string theory.

1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:57.320
 And with that came a lot of these other ideas that, you know, led to breakthroughs involving,

1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:02.000
 for example, the example I told you about black holes and holography and the work that

1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.480
 was later done by Maldesena about the properties of duality between particle physics and quantum

1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:13.240
 gravity and the connections, deeper connections of holography and it continues.

1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.840
 And there are many people within this range, which I haven't even mentioned, they have

1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:20.320
 done fantastic important things.

1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:25.760
 How it gets recognized, I think is secondary in my opinion than the appreciation that the

1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:30.800
 effort is collective, that in fact, that to me is the more important part of science

1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:32.360
 that gets forgotten.

1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:37.520
 For some reason, humanity likes heroes and science is no exception, we like heroes.

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:40.480
 But I personally try to avoid that trap.

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:44.760
 I feel in my work, most of my work is with colleagues.

1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:50.680
 I have much more collaborations than sole author papers and I enjoy it.

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:55.600
 And I think that that's to me one of the most satisfying aspects of science is to interact

1:28:55.600 --> 1:29:02.480
 and learn and debate ideas with colleagues because that influx of ideas enriches it.

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:05.760
 And that's why I find it interesting.

1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:10.320
 To me, science, if I was in an island and if I was developing string theory by myself

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:14.360
 and had nothing to do with anybody, it would be much less satisfying in my opinion.

1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:17.320
 Even if I could take credit, I did it.

1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:18.680
 It won't be as satisfying.

1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:22.200
 Sitting alone with a big metal drinking champagne?

1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:23.200
 No.

1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:27.680
 I think to me, the collective work is more exciting and you mentioned my getting the

1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:28.680
 breakthrough.

1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:32.400
 When I was getting it, I made sure to mention that it is because of the joint work that

1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:37.520
 I've done with colleagues at that time, it was around 180 or so collaborators and I acknowledged

1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:42.200
 them in the web page for them, I wrote all of their names and the collaborations that

1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:43.200
 led to this.

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:46.800
 So to me, science is fun when it's collaboration.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:51.440
 And yes, there are more important and less important figures as in any field.

1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:53.480
 And that's true, that's true in string theory as well.

1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:57.080
 But I think that I would like to view this as a collective effort.

1:29:57.080 --> 1:30:04.880
 So setting the heroes aside, the Nobel Prize is a celebration of, what's the right way

1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:08.520
 to put it, that this idea turned out to be right.

1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:13.960
 So like you look at Einstein didn't believe in black holes.

1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:18.000
 And then black holes got their Nobel Prize.

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:23.880
 Do you think string theory will get its Nobel Prize, Nobel Prizes?

1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:28.120
 If you were to bet money, if this was like, if this was an investment meeting and we had

1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:31.960
 to bet all our money, do you think he gets the Nobel Prizes?

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:35.640
 I think it's possible that none of the living physicists will get the Nobel Prize on string

1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:42.240
 theory, but somebody will because unfortunately the technology available today is not very

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:46.360
 encouraging in terms of seeing directly evidence for string theory.

1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:51.120
 Do you think it ultimately boils down to the Nobel Prize will be given when there is some

1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:53.560
 direct or indirect evidence?

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:58.720
 There would be, but I think that part of this breakthrough prize was precisely the appreciation

1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:04.480
 that when we have sufficient evidence, theoretical as it is, not experiment.

1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:09.080
 Because of this technology lag, you appreciate what you think is the correct path.

1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:14.400
 So there are many people who have been recognized precisely because they may not be around when

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:18.480
 it actually gets experimented, even though they discovered it.

1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:21.560
 So there are many things like that that's going on in science.

1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:28.320
 So I think that I would want to attach less significance to the recognitions of people.

1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:35.520
 And I have a second review on this, which is there are people who look at these works

1:31:35.520 --> 1:31:40.160
 that people have done and put them together and make the next big breakthrough.

1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:48.400
 And they get identified with, perhaps rightly with many of these new visions, but they are

1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:54.280
 on the shoulders of these little scientists, which don't get any recognition, you know,

1:31:54.280 --> 1:31:57.480
 yeah, you did this little work, oh, yeah, you did this little work, oh, yeah, yeah, five

1:31:57.480 --> 1:32:01.880
 of you, oh, yeah, these show this pattern and then somebody else, it's not fair.

1:32:01.880 --> 1:32:07.160
 To me, to me, those little guys, which kind of like, like seem to do a little calculation

1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:10.840
 here, a little thing there, which is not doesn't doesn't rise to the occasion of this grandiose

1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:16.080
 kind of thing, doesn't make it to the New York Times headlines and so on deserve a lot

1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:17.160
 of recognition.

1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:18.360
 And I think they don't get enough.

1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:23.160
 I would say that there should be this Nobel Prize for, you know, they have these doctors

1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:26.960
 without borders, a huge group, they should be similar thing and the string tears without

1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:29.280
 borders kind of everybody is doing a lot of work.

1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:32.800
 And I think that I would like to see that efforts to recognize.

1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:38.800
 I think in the long arc of history, we're all little guys and girls standing on the

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:40.600
 shoulders of each other.

1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:44.600
 I mean, it's all going to look tiny in retrospect.

1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:53.360
 We celebrate New York Times, you know, as a newspaper or the idea of a newspaper in a

1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:56.160
 few centuries from now will be long forgotten.

1:32:56.160 --> 1:32:57.680
 Yes, I agree with that.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:00.680
 Especially in the countries of string there, we should have very long term view.

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:02.080
 Yes, exactly.

1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:08.520
 Just as a tiny tangent, we mentioned Edward Whitton and he in a bunch of walks of life

1:33:08.520 --> 1:33:15.480
 for me as an outsider comes up as a person who is widely considered as like one of the

1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:21.680
 most brilliant people in the history of physics, just as a powerhouse of a human.

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:28.960
 Like the exceptional places that a human mind can rise to, you've gotten a chance to work

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:29.960
 with him.

1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:30.960
 What's he like?

1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:36.640
 More than that, he was my advisor, a PhD advisor, so I got to know him very well and I benefited

1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:37.640
 from his insights.

1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:40.200
 In fact, what you said about him is accurate.

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:47.400
 He's not only brilliant, but he's also multifaceted in terms of the impact he has had in not only

1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:49.720
 physics but also mathematics.

1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:54.960
 He's gotten the fields medal because of his work in mathematics and rightly so, he has

1:33:54.960 --> 1:34:01.760
 used his knowledge of physics in a way which impacted deep ideas in modern mathematics and

1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:07.920
 that's an example of the power of these ideas in modern high energy physics and string theory

1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:12.960
 that the applicability of it to modern mathematics.

1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:16.880
 He's quite an exceptional individual.

1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:19.680
 We don't come across such people a lot in history.

1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:25.080
 So I think, yes, indeed, he's one of the rare figures in this history of subject, he has

1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:28.320
 great impact on a lot of aspects of not just string theory, a lot of different areas in

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:32.840
 physics and also, yes, in mathematics as well.

1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:34.960
 So I think what you said about him is accurate.

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:39.840
 I had the pleasure of interacting with him as a student and later on as colleagues writing

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:41.680
 papers together and so on.

1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:44.640
 What impact did he have on your life?

1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:46.120
 What have you learned from him?

1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.960
 If you were to look at the trajectory of your mind of the way you approach science and physics

1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:54.680
 and mathematics, how did he perturb that trajectory in a way?

1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:55.680
 Yes, he did actually.

1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:01.280
 So I can explain because when I was a student, I had the biggest impact by him clearly as

1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:02.440
 a grad student at Princeton.

1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:07.760
 So I think that was the time where I was a little bit confused about the relation between

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:08.760
 math and physics.

1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:14.680
 I got a double major in mathematics and physics at MIT and because I really enjoyed both and

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:21.120
 I liked the elegance and the rigor of mathematics and I liked the power of ideas in physics

1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:26.520
 and its applicability to reality and what it teaches about the real world around us.

1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:33.400
 But I saw this tension between rigorous thinking in mathematics and lack thereof in physics

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:36.160
 and this troubled me to no end.

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.200
 I was troubled by that.

1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:42.920
 So I was at crossroads when I decided to go to graduate school in physics because I did

1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:47.240
 not like some of the lack of rigors I was seeing in physics.

1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:52.360
 On the other hand, to me, mathematics, even though it was rigorous, I didn't see the

1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:53.360
 point of it.

1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:57.840
 In other words, when I see the math theorem by itself could be beautiful, but I really

1:35:57.840 --> 1:35:58.840
 wanted more than that.

1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:02.000
 I wanted to say, okay, what does it teach us about something else, something more than

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.000
 just math?

1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:07.440
 So I wasn't that enamored with just math, but physics was a little bit bothersome.

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:11.720
 Nevertheless, I decided to go to physics and I decided to go to Princeton and I started

1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:20.400
 working with Edward Whitten as my thesis advisor and at that time I was trying to put physics

1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:22.360
 in rigorous mathematical terms.

1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:27.000
 I took one of field theory, I tried to make rigorous out of it and so on.

1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:32.600
 And no matter how hard I was trying, I was not being able to do that and I was falling

1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:33.760
 behind from my classes.

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:38.560
 I was not learning much physics and I was not making it rigorous and to me, it was this

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.720
 dichotomy between math and physics.

1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:41.720
 What am I doing?

1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:45.840
 I like math, but this is not exact risk.

1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:51.080
 There comes Edward Whitten as my advisor and I see him in action, thinking about math and

1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:52.160
 physics.

1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:56.360
 He was amazing in math, he knew all about the math, it was no problem with him.

1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:02.440
 But he thought about physics in a way which did not find this tension between the two.

1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:04.160
 It was much more harmonious.

1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.960
 For him, he would draw the Feynman diagrams, but he wouldn't view it as a formalism.

1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:11.600
 He was viewed, oh yeah, the particle goes over there and this is what's going on.

1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:15.840
 And so wait, you're thinking really, is this particle, this is really electron going there?

1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:20.000
 Yeah, yeah, it's not the form of perturbation.

1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.280
 You just feel like the electron, you're moving with this guy and do that and so on and you're

1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:28.440
 thinking invariantly about physics or the way he thought about relativity, like I was

1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:32.600
 thinking about this momentum, he was thinking invariantly about physics, just like the way

1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:36.600
 you think about invariant concepts in relativity which don't depend on the frame of reference.

1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:41.960
 He was thinking about the physics in invariant ways, the way that doesn't, that gives you

1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:43.040
 a bigger perspective.

1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:50.200
 So this gradually helped me appreciate that interconnections between ideas and physics

1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:57.160
 replaces mathematical rigor, that the different facets reinforce each other, you say, oh,

1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:00.800
 I cannot rigorously define what I mean by this, but this thing connects with this other

1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:06.520
 physics I've seen and this other thing and they together form an elegant story.

1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:11.400
 And that's replaced for me what I believed as a solidness, which I found in math as a

1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:16.280
 rigor, solid, I found that replaced the rigor and solidness in physics.

1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:20.440
 So I found, okay, that's the way you can hang on to it is not wishy washy.

1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:24.840
 It's not like somebody is just not being able to prove it, just making up a story.

1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:25.840
 It was more than that.

1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:28.600
 And it was no tension with mathematics.

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.840
 In fact, mathematics was helping it, like friends.

1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:34.920
 And so much more harmonious and gives insights to physics.

1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:38.960
 So that's, I think, one of the main things I learned from interaction with Whitton.

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.320
 And I think that now perhaps I have taken that far extreme, maybe he wouldn't go this

1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:45.320
 far as I have.

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:50.840
 Namely, I use physics to define new mathematics in a way which would be far less rigorous

1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:56.680
 than a physics might necessarily believe because I take the physical intuition, perhaps literally

1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:58.960
 in many ways that could teach us about.

1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:03.680
 So now I've gained so much confidence in physical intuition that I make bold statements

1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.520
 that sometimes takes math friends off guard.

1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:11.080
 So an example of it is mirror symmetry.

1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:15.560
 So we were studying these compactivational string geometries.

1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:19.640
 This is after my PhD now, by the time I had come to Harvard.

1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:24.040
 We're studying these aspects of string compactivation on these complicated manifolds, six dimensional

1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:28.400
 spaces called Kalalbyel manifolds, very complicated.

1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:35.120
 And I noticed with a couple other colleagues that there was a symmetry in physics suggested

1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:40.840
 between different Kalabias that suggested that you couldn't actually compute the Euler

1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.720
 characteristic of a Kalabia.

1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:47.280
 Euler characteristic is counting the number of points minus the number of edges plus the

1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:48.280
 number of faces minus.

1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:52.800
 So you can count the alternating sequence of properties of the space, which is the topological

1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:54.840
 property of a space.

1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:59.920
 So Euler characteristic of the Kalabia was a property of the space, and so we noticed

1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:05.560
 that from the physics formalism, if string moves in a Kalabia, you cannot distinguish,

1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:07.400
 we cannot compute the Euler characteristic.

1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:10.400
 You can only compute the absolute value of it.

1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:16.320
 Now this bothered us because how could you not compute the actual sign unless the both

1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:19.040
 sides were the same?

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:22.440
 So I conjectured maybe for every Kalabia with the Euler characteristic positive, there's

1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:23.440
 one with negative.

1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:31.880
 I told this to my colleague Yao, whose namesake is Kalabia, that I'm making this conjecture.

1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:36.880
 Is it possible that for every Kalabia, there's one with the opposite Euler characteristic?

1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:37.880
 Sounds not reasonable.

1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:38.880
 I said, why?

1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:44.520
 He said, well, we know more Kalabias with negative Euler characteristics than positive.

1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:47.960
 I said, but physics says we cannot distinguish them, at least I don't see how.

1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:52.320
 So we conjectured that for every Kalabia with one sign, there's the other one, despite

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:57.520
 the mathematical evidence, despite the mathematical evidence, despite the expert telling us this

1:40:57.520 --> 1:40:58.800
 is not the right idea.

1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:04.640
 A few years later, this symmetry, mirror symmetry between the sign with the opposite sign was

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.100
 later confirmed by mathematicians.

1:41:07.100 --> 1:41:09.360
 So this is actually the opposite view.

1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:13.960
 That is physics is so sure about it that you're going against the mathematical wisdom telling

1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:15.520
 them they better look for it.

1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:22.760
 So taking the physical intuition literally and then having that drive the mathematics.

1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:23.760
 Exactly.

1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:28.960
 And by now, we are so confident about many such examples that has affected modern mathematics

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:33.800
 in ways like this, that we are much more confident about our understanding of what string theory

1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:34.800
 is.

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:37.640
 These are another aspects, other aspects of why we feel string theory is correct.

1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:39.880
 It's doing these kind of things.

1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:46.040
 I've been hearing your talk quite a bit about string theory, landscape and the swampland.

1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:47.480
 What the heck are those two concepts?

1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:48.480
 Okay.

1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:49.480
 Very good question.

1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:51.360
 So let's go back to what I was describing about Feynman.

1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:52.360
 Yes.

1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.320
 Feynman was trying to do these diagrams for graviton and electrons and all that.

1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:00.360
 He found that he's getting infinities he cannot resolve.

1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:01.360
 Okay.

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:06.520
 The natural conclusion is that field theories and gravity and quantum theory don't go together

1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:07.760
 and you cannot have it.

1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:14.520
 So in other words, field theories and gravity are inconsistent with quantum mechanics, period.

1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:21.560
 String theory came up with examples, but didn't address the question more broadly that is it

1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:27.480
 true that every field theory can be coupled to gravity in a quantum mechanical way?

1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:31.480
 It turns out that Feynman was essentially right.

1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:36.320
 Almost all particle physics theories, no matter what you add to it, when you put gravity

1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:38.680
 in it, doesn't work.

1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:41.560
 Only rare exceptions work.

1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:44.280
 So string theory are those rare exceptions.

1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:48.040
 So therefore, the general principle that Feynman found was correct.

1:42:48.040 --> 1:42:53.680
 Quantum field theory and gravity and quantum mechanics don't go together except for joules,

1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:54.680
 exceptional cases.

1:42:54.680 --> 1:42:56.440
 There are exceptional cases.

1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:57.440
 Okay.

1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:03.360
 The total vastness of quantum field theories that are there, we call the set of quantum

1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:05.480
 field theories, possible things.

1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:10.000
 Each one can be consistently coupled to gravity.

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:13.200
 We call that subspace, the landscape.

1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:16.280
 The rest of them, we call the swamp land.

1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:20.080
 It doesn't mean they are bad quantum field theories, they are perfectly fine.

1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:24.400
 But when you couple them to gravity, they don't make sense, unfortunately.

1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:29.000
 And it turns out that the ratio of them, the number of theories which are consistent with

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:34.840
 gravity to the ones without, the ratio of the area of the landscape to the swamp land,

1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:38.000
 in other words, is measure zero.

1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.280
 So the swamp land is infinitely large?

1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:41.680
 The swamp land is infinitely large.

1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:43.360
 So let me give you one example.

1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:49.000
 Take a theory in four dimension with matter, with maximal amount of supersymmetry.

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:53.760
 Can you get, it turns out a theory in four dimension with maximal amount of supersymmetry

1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:58.520
 is characterized just with one thing, a group, what we call the gauge group.

1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:01.520
 Once you pick a group, you have to find the theory.

1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:02.520
 Okay.

1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:04.200
 So does every group make sense?

1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:05.200
 Yeah.

1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:07.560
 As far as quantum field theory, every group makes sense.

1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:10.800
 There are infinitely many groups, there are infinitely many quantum field theories.

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:15.040
 But it turns out there are only finite number of them which are consistent with gravity

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:16.960
 out of that same list.

1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:20.560
 So you can take any group, but only finite number of them, the ones who's what we call

1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:26.360
 the rank of the group, the ones whose rank is less than 23.

1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:31.320
 Any one bigger than rank 23 belongs to the swamp land, there are infinitely many of them.

1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:36.240
 They're beautiful field theories, but not when you include gravity.

1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:37.880
 So then this becomes a hopeful thing.

1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:43.960
 So in other words, in our universe, we have gravity, therefore, we are part of that joule

1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:44.960
 subset.

1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:50.320
 Now, is this joule subset small or large?

1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:57.520
 It turns out that subset is humongous, but we believe still finite.

1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:02.720
 The set of possibilities is infinite, but the set of consistent ones, I mean, the set

1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:08.080
 of quantum field theories are infinite, but the consistent ones are finite, but humongous.

1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:12.720
 The fact that they're humongous is the problem we are facing in string theory, because we

1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:18.280
 do not know which one of these possibilities is the universe we live in.

1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:22.520
 If we knew we could make more specific predictions about our universe, we don't know.

1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:26.160
 And that is one of the challenges with string theory, which point on the landscape, which

1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:28.760
 corner of this landscape do we live in?

1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:30.280
 We don't know.

1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:31.880
 So what do we do?

1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:35.800
 Well, there are principles that are beginning to emerge.

1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:38.120
 So I will give you one example of it.

1:45:38.120 --> 1:45:42.440
 You look at the patterns of what you're getting in terms of these good ones, the ones which

1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:45.600
 are in the landscape, compared to the ones which are not.

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:46.600
 You find certain patterns.

1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:49.360
 I'll give you one pattern.

1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:54.320
 You find in the all the ones that you get from string theory, gravitational force is

1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:59.320
 always there, but it's always, always the weakest force.

1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:05.800
 However, you could easily imagine field theories for which gravity is not the weakest force.

1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:09.040
 For example, take our universe.

1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:12.600
 If you take a mass of the electron, if you increase the mass of the electron by a huge

1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:17.200
 factor, the gravitational attraction of the electrons will be bigger than the electric

1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:21.040
 repulsion between two electrons, and the gravity will be stronger.

1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:23.040
 That's all.

1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:26.520
 But it happens that it's not the case in our universe, because the electron is very tiny

1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:28.840
 in mass compared to that.

1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:33.880
 Just like our universe, gravity is the weakest force we find in all these other ones, which

1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:38.960
 are part of the good ones, the gravity is the weakest force.

1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:40.760
 This is called the weak gravity conjecture.

1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:46.040
 We conjecture that all the points in the landscape have this property.

1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:47.760
 Our universe being just an example of it.

1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:51.080
 So there are these qualitative features that we are beginning to see.

1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:54.120
 But how do we argue for this just by looking patterns?

1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:55.760
 Just by looking string theory has this?

1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:58.160
 No, that's not enough.

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:01.920
 We need more reason, more better reasoning, and it turns out there is.

1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:05.560
 The reasoning for this turns out to be studying black holes.

1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:10.960
 Ideas of black holes turn out to put certain restrictions of what a good quantum field theory

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:12.120
 should be.

1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:18.200
 It turns out using black hole, the fact that the black holes evaporate, the fact that the

1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:24.840
 black holes evaporate gives you a way to check the relation between the mass and the charge

1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:28.760
 of elementary particle, because what you can do, you can take a charged particle and throw

1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:32.240
 it into a charged black hole and wait it to evaporate.

1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:37.760
 And by looking at the properties of evaporation, you find that if it cannot evaporate particles

1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:40.920
 whose mass is less than their charge, then it will never evaporate.

1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:41.920
 You will be stuck.

1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:47.200
 And so the possibility of a black hole evaporation forces you to have particles whose mass is

1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:50.600
 sufficiently small so that the gravity is weaker.

1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:52.960
 So you connect this fact to the other fact.

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:56.400
 So we begin to find different facts that reinforce each other.

1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:01.840
 So different parts of the physics reinforce each other, and once they all kind of come

1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:04.360
 together, you believe that you're getting the principle correct.

1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:09.840
 So weak gravity conjecture is one of the principles we believe in, as a necessity of these conditions.

1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:12.360
 So these are the predictions string theory are making.

1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:13.360
 Is that enough?

1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:14.360
 Well, it's qualitative.

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:19.680
 It's a semi quantity, it's just that mass of the electron should be less than some number.

1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:24.160
 But that number is, if I call that number one, the mass of the electron turns out to

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:25.680
 be 10 to the minus 20, actually.

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:28.160
 So it's much less than one, it's not one.

1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:34.120
 But on the other hand, there's a similar reasoning for a big black hole in our universe.

1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:38.000
 And if that evaporation should take place, gives you another restriction, tells you mass

1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.880
 of the electron is bigger than 10 to the, is now in this case, bigger than something.

1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:45.840
 It shows bigger than 10 to the minus 30 in the thank unit.

1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:50.160
 So you find the mass of the electron should be less than one, but bigger than 10 to the

1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:51.400
 minus 30.

1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:54.360
 In our universe, the mass of the electrons tends to minus 20.

1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:55.360
 Okay.

1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:59.080
 Now, this kind of you could call post fiction, but I would say it follows from principles

1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:01.560
 that we now understand from string theory.

1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:02.560
 First principle.

1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:08.360
 So we are beginning to make these kinds of predictions, which are very much connected

1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:12.320
 to aspects of particle physics that we didn't think are related to gravity.

1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:15.080
 We thought, just take any electron mass you want.

1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:16.080
 What's the problem?

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:17.680
 It has a problem with gravity.

1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:24.840
 And so that conjecture has also a happy consequence that it explains that our universe, like

1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:31.120
 why the heck is gravity so weak as a force, and that's not only an accident, but almost

1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:35.440
 a necessity if these forces are to coexist effectively.

1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:36.440
 Exactly.

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.840
 So that's the reinforcement of what we know in our universe.

1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:43.320
 What we are finding that as a general principle.

1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:49.440
 So we want to know what aspects of our universe is forced on us, like the weak gravity conjecture

1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:50.440
 and other aspects.

1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:52.840
 Do we understand how much of them do we understand?

1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:54.840
 Can we have particles lighter than neutrinos?

1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.400
 Or maybe that's not possible.

1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:00.400
 You see the neutrino mass, it turns out to be related to dark energy in a mysterious

1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:01.400
 way.

1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:06.600
 Naively, there's no relation between dark energy and a mass of a particle.

1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:12.760
 We have found arguments from within the swampland kind of ideas why it has to be related.

1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:18.240
 And so they're beginning to be these connections between consistency of quantum gravity and

1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:22.440
 aspects of our universe gradually being sharpened.

1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:26.920
 But we are still far from a precise quantitative prediction like we have to have such and such,

1:50:26.920 --> 1:50:29.680
 but that's the hope that we are going in that direction.

1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:33.840
 Coming up with a theory of everything that unifies general relativity and quantum field

1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:41.600
 theories is one of the big dreams of human civilization, us descendants of apes wondering

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:43.480
 about how this world works.

1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:52.720
 So a lot of people dream, what are your thoughts about other out there ideas, theories of everything

1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:56.280
 or unifying theories?

1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:00.080
 So there's quantum loop gravity.

1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:05.440
 There's also more sort of like a friend of mine, Eric Weinstein, beginning to propose

1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:07.640
 something called geometric unity.

1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:12.600
 So these kinds of attempts, whether it's through mathematical physics or through other avenues,

1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:16.440
 or with Stephen Wolfram, a more computational view of the universe.

1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:22.320
 Again, in his case, it's these hypergraphs that are very tiny objects as well, similarly

1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.080
 a string theory, and trying to grapple with this world.

1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:31.640
 What do you think, is there any of these theories that are compelling to you, that are interesting,

1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:36.240
 that may turn out to be true, or at least may turn out to contain ideas that are useful?

1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:37.240
 Yes, I think the latter.

1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:42.800
 I would say that the containing ideas that are true is my opinion was what some of these

1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:43.800
 ideas might be.

1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:48.000
 For example, loop quantum gravity is to me not a complete theory of gravity in any sense,

1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.560
 but they have some nuggets of truth in them.

1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:56.160
 And typically what I expect happen, and I have seen examples of this within string theory,

1:51:56.160 --> 1:51:58.880
 aspects which we didn't think are part of string theory come to be part of it.

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:01.040
 For example, I'll give you one example.

1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:04.880
 String was believed to be 10 dimensional, and then there was this 11 dimensional super

1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:08.240
 gravity, and nobody know what the heck is that.

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:11.920
 Why are we getting 11 dimensional super gravity, whereas string is saying it should be 10 dimensional.

1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:16.160
 11 was the maximum dimension, you can have super gravity, but string was saying, sorry,

1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:18.040
 we're 10 dimensional.

1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:21.560
 So for a while we thought that theory is wrong, because how could it be?

1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:23.440
 Because string theory is definitely a theory of everything.

1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:28.840
 We later learned that one of the circles of string theory itself was tiny, that we had

1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:30.280
 not appreciated that fact.

1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:33.760
 And we discovered by doing thought experiments of string theory that there's got to be an

1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:38.480
 extra circle, and that circle is connected to an 11 dimensional perspective.

1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:41.960
 And that's what later on got called M theory.

1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:45.920
 So there are these kind of things that we do not know what exactly string theory is.

1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:47.480
 We're still learning.

1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:50.640
 So we do not have a final formulation of string theory.

1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:54.240
 It's very well could be that different facets of different ideas come together, like loop

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:55.400
 quantum gravity or whatnot.

1:52:55.400 --> 1:53:01.520
 But I wouldn't put them on par, namely loop quantum gravity is a scatter of ideas about

1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:03.880
 what happens to space when they get very tiny.

1:53:03.880 --> 1:53:09.000
 For example, you replace things by discrete data and try to quantize it and so on.

1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:13.640
 And it sounds like a natural idea to quantize space.

1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:17.240
 If you were naively trying to do quantum space, you might think about trying to take points

1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:22.320
 and put them together in some discrete fashion in some way that is reminiscent of loop quantum

1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:25.080
 gravity.

1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:27.120
 String theory is more subtle than that.

1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:29.240
 For example, I will just give you an example.

1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:31.240
 And this is the kind of thing that we didn't put in by hand.

1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:32.560
 We got it out.

1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:37.040
 And so it's more subtle than, so what happens if you squeeze the space to be smaller and

1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:38.040
 smaller?

1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:43.480
 Well, you think that after a certain distance, the notion of distance should break down.

1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:48.840
 No, when it goes smaller than Planck scale, it should break down.

1:53:48.840 --> 1:53:50.720
 What happens in string theory?

1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:53.120
 We do not know the full answer to that, but we know the following.

1:53:53.120 --> 1:53:57.840
 Namely, if you take a space and bring it smaller and smaller, if the box gets smaller than

1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:04.560
 the Planck scale by a factor of 10, it is equivalent by the duality transformation to a space which

1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:07.480
 is 10 times bigger.

1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:13.280
 So there's a symmetry called t duality, which takes L to 1 over L, where L is measured in

1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:16.320
 Planck units or more precisely string units.

1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:20.640
 This inversion is a very subtle effect.

1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:23.640
 And I would not have been, or any physicist would not have been able to design a theory

1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:28.000
 which has this property, that when you make the space smaller, it is as if you're making

1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:29.000
 it bigger.

1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:30.000
 That's right.

1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.920
 That means there is no experiment you can do to distinguish the size of the space.

1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:35.920
 This is remarkable.

1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:39.480
 For example, Einstein would have said, of course I can measure the size of the space.

1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:40.480
 What do I do?

1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:41.480
 Well, I take a flashlight.

1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:45.200
 I send the light around, measure how long it takes for the light to go around the space

1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:48.880
 and bring back and find the radius or circumference of the universe.

1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:49.880
 What's the problem?

1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:53.520
 I said, well, suppose you do that and you shrink it and say, well, they get smaller

1:54:53.520 --> 1:54:54.520
 and smaller.

1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:55.520
 So what?

1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:00.640
 I said, well, it turns out in string theory, there are two different kinds of photons.

1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:06.760
 One photon measures 1 over L. The other one measures L. And so this duality reformulates.

1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:07.760
 Oh, fascinating.

1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:10.640
 And when the space gets smaller, it says, oh, no, you better use the bigger perspective

1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.080
 because the smaller one is harder to deal with.

1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:14.080
 So you do this one.

1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:17.320
 So these examples of loop quantum gravity have none of these features.

1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:20.320
 These features that I'm telling you about, we have learned from string theory.

1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:25.080
 But they nevertheless have some of these ideas like topological gravity aspects are emphasized

1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:28.720
 in the context of loop quantum gravity in some form.

1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.360
 And so these ideas might be there in some kernel, in some corners of string theory.

1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:37.240
 In fact, I wrote a paper about topological string theory and some connections with potentially

1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:39.280
 loop quantum gravity, which could be part of that.

1:55:39.280 --> 1:55:41.560
 So they're little facets of connections.

1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:46.320
 I wouldn't say they're complete, but I would say most probably what would happen to some

1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:51.080
 of these ideas, the good ones at least, they will be absorbed to string theory if they

1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:52.080
 are correct.

1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:54.480
 Let me ask a crazy out there question.

1:55:54.480 --> 1:56:00.040
 Can physics help us understand life?

1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:07.760
 So we spoke so confidently about the laws of physics being able to explain reality,

1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:13.360
 but, and we even said words like theory of everything, implying that the word everything

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:15.920
 is actually describing everything.

1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:22.240
 Is it possible that the four laws we've been talking about are actually missing?

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:26.160
 They are accurate in describing what they're describing, but they're missing the description

1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:35.160
 of a lot of other things like emergence of life and emergence of perhaps consciousness.

1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:42.280
 So is there, do you ever think about this kind of stuff where we would need to understand

1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:52.200
 extra physics to try to explain the emergence of these complex pockets of interesting weird

1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:58.800
 stuff that we call life and consciousness in this big homogeneous universe that's mostly

1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:00.480
 boring and nothing is happening in.

1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:05.160
 So first of all, we don't claim that string theory is the theory of everything in the

1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:07.760
 sense that we know enough what this theory is.

1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:09.280
 We don't know enough about string theory itself.

1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:10.280
 We are learning it.

1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:14.200
 So I wouldn't say, okay, give me whatever I will tell you what it's hard to work.

1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:15.200
 No.

1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:20.840
 However, I would say by definition, by definition to me physics is checking all reality.

1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:22.640
 Any form of reality, I call it physics.

1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:23.640
 That's my definition.

1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:28.240
 I mean, I may not know a lot of it, like maybe the origin of life and so on, maybe a piece

1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:30.960
 of that, but I would call that as part of physics.

1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:33.520
 To me, reality is what we're after.

1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:35.680
 I don't claim I know everything about reality.

1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:40.080
 I don't claim string theory necessarily has the tools right now to describe all the reality

1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:42.440
 either, but we are learning what it is.

1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:46.320
 So I would say that I would not put a border to say, no, you know, from this point onwards,

1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:48.560
 it's not my territory, somebody else's.

1:57:48.560 --> 1:57:53.440
 But whether we need new ideas and string theory to describe other reality features, for sure

1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:56.560
 I believe, as I mentioned, I don't believe anything.

1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:58.160
 Any of the laws we know today is final.

1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:00.920
 So therefore, yes, we will need new ideas.

1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:08.320
 This is a very tricky thing for us to understand and be precise about.

1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:16.960
 But just because you understand the physics doesn't necessarily mean that you understand

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:23.920
 the emergence of chemistry, biology, life, intelligence, consciousness.

1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:26.000
 So those are built.

1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.640
 It's like you might understand the way bricks work.

1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:37.640
 But to understand what it means to have a happy family, you don't get from the bricks.

1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:46.080
 So directly, in theory, you could if you ran the universe over again, but just understanding

1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:51.520
 the rules of the universe doesn't necessarily give you a sense of the weird, beautiful things

1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:52.520
 that emerge.

1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:53.520
 Right.

1:58:53.520 --> 1:58:54.520
 No.

1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:55.520
 So let me describe what you just said.

1:58:55.520 --> 1:58:56.520
 There are two questions.

1:58:56.520 --> 1:59:00.120
 One is whether or not the techniques are used in, let's say, quantum field theory and so

1:59:00.120 --> 1:59:02.600
 on will describe how the society works.

1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:03.600
 Yes.

1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:04.600
 Okay.

1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:08.320
 That's far different scales of questions that we're asking here.

1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:13.400
 The question is, is there a change of, is there a new law which takes over that cannot

1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:18.160
 be connected to all their laws that we know or more fundamental laws that we know?

1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:20.320
 Do you need new laws to describe it?

1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:23.520
 I don't think that's necessarily the case in many of these phenomena like chemistry

1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:25.360
 or so on you mentioned.

1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:29.680
 So we do expect, you know, in principle, chemistry can be described by quantum mechanics.

1:59:29.680 --> 1:59:32.960
 We don't think there's going to be a magical thing, but chemistry is complicated.

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:33.960
 Yeah.

1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:36.800
 Indeed, there are rules of chemistry that, you know, chemists have put down which has

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:39.520
 not been explained yet using quantum mechanics.

1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:42.120
 Do I believe that they will be at something described by quantum mechanics?

1:59:42.120 --> 1:59:43.120
 Yes, I do.

1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:46.200
 I don't think they are going to be sitting there in the shells forever, but maybe it's

1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:50.320
 too complicated and maybe, you know, we will wait for very powerful quantum computers or

1:59:50.320 --> 1:59:51.600
 what not to solve those problems.

1:59:51.600 --> 1:59:52.760
 I don't know.

1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:58.040
 But I don't think in that context we have no principles to be added to fix those.

1:59:58.040 --> 2:00:03.960
 So I'm perfectly fine in the intermediate situation to have rules of thumb or principles

2:00:03.960 --> 2:00:08.280
 that chemists have found which are reworking, which are not founded on the basis of quantum

2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:10.800
 mechanical laws, which does the job.

2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:14.920
 Similarly as biologists do not found everything in terms of chemistry, but they think, you

2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:16.760
 know, there's no reason why chemistry cannot.

2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:21.200
 They don't think necessarily they're doing something amazingly not possible with chemistry.

2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:26.320
 Coming back to your question, does consciousness, for example, bring this new ingredient?

2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:30.560
 If indeed it needs a new ingredient, I will call that new ingredient part of physical law.

2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:32.600
 We have to understand it to meet that.

2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:37.520
 So I wouldn't put a line to say, okay, from this point onwards, you cannot, it's disconnected.

2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:39.560
 It's totally disconnected from string theory or whatever.

2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:41.240
 We have to do something else.

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:42.480
 It's not a line.

2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:47.120
 What I'm referring to is can physics of a few centuries from now that doesn't understand

2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:53.880
 consciousness be much bigger than the physics of today where the textbook grows?

2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:54.880
 It definitely will.

2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:55.880
 I would say I will grow.

2:00:55.880 --> 2:00:56.880
 I would not.

2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:00.240
 I don't know if it grows because of consciousness being part of it, or we have different view

2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:01.240
 of consciousness.

2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:03.040
 I do not know where the consciousness will fit.

2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:04.040
 I'm not.

2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:07.520
 It's going to be hard for me to guess.

2:01:07.520 --> 2:01:11.680
 I mean, I can make random guesses now, which probably most likely is wrong, but let me

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:14.520
 just do just for the sake of discussion.

2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:19.000
 You know, I could say, you know, brain could be their quantum computer, classical computer.

2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:20.800
 Their arguments against it's being a quantum thing.

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.800
 So it's probably classical.

2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:24.840
 And if it's classical, it could be like what we are doing in machine learning, slightly

2:01:24.840 --> 2:01:26.080
 more fancy and so on.

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:27.080
 Okay.

2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.120
 People can go to this argument to no end and to see whether consciousness exists or not.

2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:32.360
 Or life, does it have any meaning?

2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:36.720
 Or is there a phase transition where you can say, does electron have a life or not?

2:01:36.720 --> 2:01:39.280
 At what level does the particle become life?

2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:43.160
 Maybe there's no definite definition of life in that same way that, you know, we cannot

2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:49.320
 say electron, if you, you know, I like this example quite a bit, you know, we distinguish

2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:53.640
 between liquid and a gas phase, like water is liquid or vapor is gas.

2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:54.640
 And we say they're different.

2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:55.640
 You can distinguish them.

2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:57.560
 Actually, that's not true.

2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:01.800
 It's not true because we know from physics that you can change temperatures and pressure

2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:05.720
 to go from liquid to the gas without making any phase transition.

2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:10.200
 So there is no point that you can say this was a liquid and this was a gas.

2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:13.920
 You can continuously change the parameters to go from one to the other.

2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:17.400
 So at the end, it's very different looking like, you know, I know that water is different

2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:21.200
 from vapor, but, you know, there's no precise point this happens.

2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:25.920
 I feel many of these things that we think, like consciousness, clearly that person is

2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:30.560
 not conscious on the other one is, so there's a difference like water and vapor.

2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:32.920
 But there's no point you could say that this is conscious.

2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:34.200
 There's no sharp transition.

2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:40.240
 So it could very well be that what we call heuristically in daily life, consciousness

2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:43.080
 is similar or life is similar to that.

2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:44.440
 I don't know if it's like that or not.

2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:49.360
 I'm just hypothesizing as possible that there's no, there's no discrete phases.

2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:51.080
 There's no discrete phase transition like that.

2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:52.080
 Yeah.

2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:53.080
 Yeah.

2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:59.240
 But there might be, you know, concepts of temperature and pressure that we need to understand

2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:04.520
 what to describe what the head consciousness in life is that we're totally missing.

2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:05.520
 Yes.

2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:07.640
 I think that's not a useless question.

2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:11.920
 Even those questions that is back to our original discussion of philosophy, I would

2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:19.520
 say consciousness and free will, for example, are topics that are very much so in the realm

2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:20.520
 of philosophy currently.

2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:21.520
 Yes.

2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:22.880
 But I don't think they will always be.

2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:23.880
 I agree with you.

2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:24.880
 I agree with you.

2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:29.960
 I think I'm fine with some topics being part of a different realm than physics today because

2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:32.360
 we don't have the right tools.

2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:33.360
 Just like biology was.

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:37.600
 I mean, before we had DNA and all that genetics and all that gradually began to take hold.

2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:43.720
 I mean, when people were beginning with various experiments with biology and chemistry and

2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:46.080
 so on, gradually they came together.

2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:47.320
 So it wasn't like together.

2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:51.600
 So yeah, I'd be perfectly understanding of a situation where we don't have the tools.

2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:55.040
 Also do the experiments that you think is defines the consciousness in different form

2:03:55.040 --> 2:03:57.320
 and gradually we will build it and connect it.

2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:01.040
 And yes, we might discover new principles of nature that we didn't know.

2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:02.040
 I don't know.

2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:05.160
 But I would say that if they are, they will be deeply connected with us.

2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:08.280
 We have never, we have seen in physics, we don't have things in isolation.

2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:11.600
 You cannot compartmentalize, you know, this is gravity.

2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:12.600
 This is electricity.

2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:15.360
 This is that we have learned they all talk to each other.

2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:19.120
 There's no way to make them, you know, in one corner and don't talk.

2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:21.360
 So same thing with anything, anything which is real.

2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:22.440
 So consciousness is real.

2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.280
 So therefore we have to connect it to everything else.

2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:28.600
 So to me, once you connect it, you cannot say it's not reality and once it's reality

2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:29.600
 is physics.

2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:30.600
 It's physics.

2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:31.600
 I call it physics.

2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:32.600
 It may not be the physics I know today.

2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:33.600
 For sure it's not.

2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:37.440
 But, but I wouldn't, I would, I would be surprised if there's disconnected realities that,

2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:41.320
 you know, you cannot, you cannot imagine them as part of the same soup.

2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:47.760
 So I guess God doesn't have a biology or chemistry textbook and mostly, or maybe here

2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:52.120
 she reads it for fun, biology and chemistry, but when you're trying to get some work done,

2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:54.600
 it'll be going to the physics textbook.

2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:56.100
 Okay.

2:04:56.100 --> 2:05:01.000
 What advice, let's put on your wise visionary hat.

2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:04.160
 What advice do you have for young people today?

2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:09.840
 You've, you've dedicated your book actually to, to your kids, to your family.

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:11.600
 What advice would you give to them?

2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:15.520
 What advice would you give to young people today thinking about their career, thinking

2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:16.520
 about life?

2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:21.120
 Of how to live a successful life, how to live a good life?

2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:22.120
 Yes.

2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:23.120
 Yes.

2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:24.120
 I have three sons.

2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:28.360
 And in fact, to them, I have, I have tried not to give too much advice.

2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:32.880
 So even though I've tried to kind of not give advice, maybe indirectly it has been some

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:33.880
 impact.

2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:38.160
 My oldest one is doing biophysics, for example, and the second one is doing machine learning

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:40.600
 and the third one is doing theoretical computer science.

2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:44.720
 So there are, there are these facets of interest which, which are not too far from my area,

2:05:44.720 --> 2:05:49.320
 but I have not tried to, to impact them in, in that way, but, and they have followed their

2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:50.320
 own interests.

2:05:50.320 --> 2:05:54.880
 And I think that's the advice I would give to any young person, follow your own interest

2:05:54.880 --> 2:05:58.800
 and let it, that take you wherever it takes you.

2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:06.160
 And this I did in my own case that I was planning to study economics and electrical engineering

2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:08.320
 when I started MIT.

2:06:08.320 --> 2:06:11.880
 And you know, I discovered that I'm more passionate about math and physics.

2:06:11.880 --> 2:06:16.040
 And at that time, I didn't feel math and physics would make a good career.

2:06:16.040 --> 2:06:18.600
 And so I was kind of hesitant to go in that direction.

2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:22.680
 But I did because I kind of felt that that's what I'm driven to do.

2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:24.880
 So I didn't, I don't regret it.

2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:28.360
 And I'm, I'm lucky in the sense that, you know, society supports people like me, we're

2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:32.440
 doing, you know, these abstract stuff, which, which may or may not be experimentally verified

2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:36.280
 even if you don't apply to the daily technology in our lifetime.

2:06:36.280 --> 2:06:37.720
 I'm lucky I'm doing that.

2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:44.160
 And I feel that if people follow their interests, they will find a niche that they're good at.

2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:52.120
 And this coincidence of hopefully their interests and, and abilities are kind of aligned, at

2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:56.360
 least some extent, to be able to drive them to something which is successful.

2:06:56.360 --> 2:07:00.440
 And not to be driven by things like, you know, this doesn't make a good career or this doesn't

2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:01.440
 do that.

2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:03.200
 And my parents expect that or what about this?

2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:07.560
 And I think ultimately you have to live with yourself and you only have one life and it's

2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:08.560
 short.

2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:09.560
 Very short.

2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:10.560
 I can tell you, I'm getting, I'm getting there.

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:11.560
 So I know it's short.

2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:16.000
 So you really want not to, not to, not to do things that you don't want to do.

2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:19.040
 So I think follow your interests, my strongest advice to young people.

2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:25.640
 Yeah, it's scary when your interest doesn't directly map to a career of the past or of

2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:26.640
 the day.

2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:32.640
 So you're almost anticipating future careers that could be created is scary.

2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:37.040
 But yeah, there's something to that, especially when the interest and the ability align, that

2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:41.880
 you'll pay, you will pave a path that will find a way to make money, especially in this

2:07:41.880 --> 2:07:50.160
 society, in, in, in the capitalistic United States society, it feels like ability and

2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:52.360
 passion paves the way.

2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:53.360
 Yes.

2:07:53.360 --> 2:07:56.840
 At the very least you can sell funny t shirts.

2:07:56.840 --> 2:07:57.840
 Yes.

2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:00.920
 You've mentioned life is short.

2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:03.360
 Do you think about your mortality?

2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:05.840
 Are you afraid of death?

2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:09.760
 I don't think about my mortality.

2:08:09.760 --> 2:08:13.760
 I think that I don't think about my death and I don't think about death in general too

2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:14.760
 much.

2:08:14.760 --> 2:08:17.120
 First of all, it's something that I can't too much about.

2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:21.720
 And I think it's something that it doesn't, it doesn't drive my everyday action.

2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:25.960
 It is natural to expect that it's somewhat like the time reversal situation.

2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:29.600
 So we believe that we have this approximate symmetry in nature, time reversal.

2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:30.600
 Going forward, we die.

2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:32.440
 Going backwards, we get born.

2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:35.080
 So what was it to get born?

2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:37.360
 It wasn't such a good or bad feeling.

2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:38.960
 I have no feeling of it.

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:43.480
 So you know, who knows what the death will feel like, the moment of death or whatnot.

2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:44.480
 So I don't know.

2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:49.720
 It is not known, but in what form do we exist before or after?

2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:53.640
 Again, it's something that it's partly philosophical maybe.

2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:56.000
 I like how you draw comfort from symmetry.

2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:01.720
 It does seem that there is something asymmetric here, breaking of symmetry because there's

2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:10.640
 something to the creative force of the human spirit that goes only one way.

2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:16.160
 That it seems the finiteness of life is the thing that drives the creativity.

2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:23.240
 And so it does seem that that, at least the contemplation of the finiteness of life of

2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:27.000
 mortality is the thing that helps you get your stuff together.

2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:28.000
 Yes.

2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:29.000
 I think that's true.

2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000
 But actually I have a different perspective on that a little bit.

2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:34.920
 And the, suppose I told you, you have your immortal.

2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:37.080
 Yes.

2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:42.880
 I think your life will be totally boring after that because you will not, there's, I think

2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:48.360
 part of the reason we have enjoyment in life is the finiteness of it.

2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:54.160
 And so I think mortality might be a blessing and immortality may not.

2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:58.440
 So I think that we value things because we have that finite life.

2:09:58.440 --> 2:09:59.440
 We appreciate things.

2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:00.440
 We want to do this.

2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:01.440
 We have motivation.

2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:04.280
 If I told you, you know, you have infinite life, oh, I don't, I don't need to do this

2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:05.280
 today.

2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:08.560
 I have another billion or trillion or infinite life.

2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:10.280
 So why do I do now?

2:10:10.280 --> 2:10:11.800
 There is no motivation.

2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:17.040
 A lot of the things that we do are driven by that finiteness of this resources.

2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:20.080
 So I think it is a blessing in disguise.

2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:23.640
 I don't regret it that we have a more finite life.

2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:33.160
 And I think, I think that the process of being part of this thing that, you know, the reality,

2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:39.680
 to me, part of what attracts me to science is to connect to that immortality kind of

2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:44.000
 namely the loss, the reality beyond us.

2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:49.920
 To me, I'm, I'm, I'm resigned to the fact that not only me, everybody's going to die.

2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:54.040
 So this is a little bit of a consolation, none of us are going to be around.

2:10:54.040 --> 2:10:57.480
 So therefore, okay, and none of, none of the few before me are around.

2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:00.760
 So therefore, yeah, okay, this is, this is something everybody goes through.

2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:06.280
 So, so taking that minuscule version of, okay, how tiny we are and how short time it is and

2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:14.880
 so on to connect to the deeper truth beyond us, the reality beyond us is what sense of

2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:19.680
 quote unquote immortality I would get, namely, I at least I can hang on to this little piece

2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:23.160
 of truth, even though I know, I know it's not complete.

2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:25.760
 I know it's going to be imperfect.

2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:28.560
 I know it's going to change and it's going to be improved.

2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:32.960
 But having a little bit deeper insight than, than just the naive thing around us little

2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:39.400
 earth here and little galaxy and so on, makes me feel a little bit more, more pleasure to,

2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:40.400
 to live this life.

2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:43.280
 So I think that's the way I view my, my role as a scientist.

2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:50.240
 Yeah, this, the scarcity of this life helps us appreciate the beauty of the, the immortal,

2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:57.960
 the universal truths of that physics present us and maybe, maybe one day physics will have

2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:06.480
 something to say about that, that beauty in itself, explaining why the heck it's so beautiful

2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:14.120
 to appreciate the laws of physics and yet why it's so tragic that we would die so quickly.

2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:15.120
 Yes.

2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:16.200
 We die so quickly.

2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:17.200
 So that can be a bit longer.

2:12:17.200 --> 2:12:18.200
 That's for sure.

2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:19.440
 It would be very nice.

2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:20.960
 Maybe physics will help out.

2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:21.960
 Well come on.

2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:24.040
 It was an incredible conversation.

 Thank you so much once again for painting a beautiful picture of the history of physics

2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:33.600
 and kind of presents a hopeful view of the future of physics.
